# Division settles language controversy
## Departments adopt joint program to foster cooperation, maintain independence 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Division of Literatures, Cultures, and
Languages recently adopted a policy aimed at
maintaining the independence of its depart
ments while enhancing coordination between
them. This decision ends several months of de
bate over whether the University's foreign lan
guage and literature departments should be
consolidated into one larger unit.
In addition to creating a more cooperative
structure within the division, the plan also ere

ates a research unit to help faculty members co
ordinate activities and procure funding.
I lie acceptance of this propositi has also allowed
the division to move forward with the search for two
new faculty members — a process that was frozen
last spring when plans fora complete merger of the
departments were put on hold.
Six departments — French and Italian,
Spanish and Portuguese, Slavic Languages and
Literatures, Asian Languages, German Studies
and Comparative Literature — constitute the
division, along with the Language Center,
which coordinates foreign language teaching.
Committees restructured
"If you go back seven or eight years ago, the
division was established as kind of an umbrella
over the departments," said English and Com
parative Literature Prof. Roland Greene, who

also served as chair of the division's executive
committee. "When you looked at that umbrella
carefully, you realized that the things that it
promised never really came into action."
Greene had this in mind last October when
he joined with two other professors to draft an
alternative plan to the proposed "complete"
merger. They presented their proposal to
Provost John Etchemendy early this year.
The primary change enacted by the new
plan, which Greene drafted with Humanities
Prof. Mary Pratt and Comparative Literature
Prof . Ramon Saldfvar, is a new structure for in
teractions within the Division.
Three new committees — an under
graduate affairs committee, a graduate
affairs committee and a planning and
personnel committee — will
replace the executive commit
tee, which is currently the
only body within the division
that represents all of its de
partments and the only one
charged with coordinating ac
tivities among them.
While the executive committee
was composed of the chairs of the
departments and the Language
Center, and several at-large mem
bers, the new committees will in
clude a wider range of professors
to set policies that will be consistent
across all departments.
According to Greene, these
new committees will be more
conducive to cooperation
among departments, as their
constituents will not feel the
pressure to "define turf' that
department chairs faced.
The executive committee has
already been renamed the plan
ning and personnel committee,
which in the future will jointly as
sess the hiring needs of each de
partment and will decide as one
body how they should be met.
The undergraduate and gradu
ate affairs committees will handle
curricula, enrollment and degree
programs, among other issues, lor
the division's students.
'Coordinated but independent'
Greene emphasized that de
partments would still have their
own deans and administrators and
that individual departments
would remain intact.
" I he actual solution is really
not a merger. It's crucial that
people remember the depart
ments remain coordinated but
independent," Greene said.
"One of several sticking points
was the abolition of actual depart
ments. Right here, right now,
we're just not ready for that.
"()n paper, the status quo looks
very similar to what the new struc

tine is," he said.
Comparative Literature Prof.
Sepp Gumbrecht described the
changes as "very, very subtle."
Enhancing research, connecting
faculty
In addition, the plan created a
new research unit, meant to help
humanities faculty acquire grants
in greater quantity than they have
traditionally been able, Greene
said. It is also intended to enhance
the research activities already pre
sent in the division.
"We added it to this plan be
cause we wanted to make it clear
to everyone that this division was
not going to lose its research em
phasis," Greene said. He said
they intend it to "give people a
home for their research in a way
that the departments are the
home for their teaching."
Another consequence of
agreeing upon the plan is that (he
division may now move ahead
with faculty appointments that
had been put on hold last year.
The uncertainty surrounding the
future structure of the divi
sion — which peaked last spring
— had been a hindrance to re
cruiting faculty and graduate stu
dents, causing Ktchemendy to
order that the appointments wait
until the issue was settled.
The plan also ensures that the
total number of faculty in the divi
sion will not fall below the June
2001 figure of 43.5. Additions are
forthcoming.
"There are at least eight new
positions that are coming into the
Division," Greene said. "A couple
of the eight positions are envi
sioned as potentially divisional fac
ulty or can be housed in some way
that does not involve a depart
ment." He also said that some fac
ulty might ultimately be housed in
the research unit.
A satisfactory compromise
Greene said that the new plan
has faced little opposition.
"1 support the plan, though 1

worry about the complexity of the
administrative structures that are
being put in place," Italian Liter
ature Prof. Jeffrey Schnapp told
the Stanford Report. "Any orga
nizational scheme is only as good
as the leadership of the organiza
tion in question, and many of the
[division] departments are on the
brink of starvation [iu terms of
faculty]," he said.
Gumbrecht, who compared the
debate to "trench warfare," ex
pressed relief that the issue was fi
nally settled, but acknowledged
that this was not an ideal solution
for everyone.
"While I was strongly in favor
of the more comprehensive
merger, I think (this plan is] a
good solution because the real
bad thing was that lor I Oof the 13
years | I've been at Stanford], this
issue has been debated," he said.
"We had gotten to the point

where this whole light was a big
impediment.
"1 think that it's a completely rea
sonable proposal. I do not think that
what the system is now is what the
majority of the people wanted."
Gumbrecht sees the recent
agreement as a compromise be
tween two camps: that which
strongly opposed any centraliza
tion and that which wanted to cre
ate one department.
"I think it is fair to say that the
basic model of the structure has
been maintained, which is why it is
a compromise," he said.
Greene said that he is confident
that plan will be beneficial.
"I guess it could be character
ized as a lot of people's second
choice, but so are a lot of things
that work," he said. "I think in a
year people will think it's more
successful than their first choice
would have been."

positions that are coming into the
Division," Greene said. "A couple
of the eight positions are envi
sioned as potentially divisional fac
ulty or can be housed in some way
that does not involve a depart
ment." He also said that some fac
ulty might ultimately be housed in
the research unit.
A satisfactory compromise
Greene said that the new plan
has faced little opposition.
"1 support the plan, though 1

worry about the complexity of the
administrative structures that are
being put in place," Italian Liter
ature Prof. Jeffrey Schnapp told
the Stanford Report. "Any orga
nizational scheme is only as good
as the leadership of the organiza
tion in question, and many of the
[division] departments are on the
brink of starvation [iu terms of
faculty]," he said.
Gumbrecht, who compared the
debate to "trench warfare," ex
pressed relief that the issue was fi
nally settled, but acknowledged
that this was not an ideal solution
for everyone.
"While I was strongly in favor
of the more comprehensive
merger, I think (this plan is] a
good solution because the real
bad thing was that lor I Oof the 13
years | I've been at Stanford], this
issue has been debated," he said.
"We had gotten to the point

where this whole light was a big
impediment.
"1 think that it's a completely rea
sonable proposal. I do not think that
what the system is now is what the
majority of the people wanted."
Gumbrecht sees the recent
agreement as a compromise be
tween two camps: that which
strongly opposed any centraliza
tion and that which wanted to cre
ate one department.
"I think it is fair to say that the
basic model of the structure has
been maintained, which is why it is
a compromise," he said.
Greene said that he is confident
that plan will be beneficial.
"I guess it could be character
ized as a lot of people's second
choice, but so are a lot of things
that work," he said. "I think in a
year people will think it's more
successful than their first choice
would have been."

The Division of Literatures, Cultures, and
Languages recently adopted a policy aimed at
maintaining the independence of its depart
ments while enhancing coordination between
them. This decision ends several months of de
bate over whether the University's foreign lan
guage and literature departments should be
consolidated into one larger unit.
In addition to creating a more cooperative
structure within the division, the plan also ere

ates a research unit to help faculty members co
ordinate activities and procure funding.
I lie acceptance of this propositi has also allowed
the division to move forward with the search for two
new faculty members — a process that was frozen
last spring when plans fora complete merger of the
departments were put on hold.
Six departments — French and Italian,
Spanish and Portuguese, Slavic Languages and
Literatures, Asian Languages, German Studies
and Comparative Literature — constitute the
division, along with the Language Center,
which coordinates foreign language teaching.
Committees restructured
"If you go back seven or eight years ago, the
division was established as kind of an umbrella
over the departments," said English and Com
parative Literature Prof. Roland Greene, who

also served as chair of the division's executive
committee. "When you looked at that umbrella
carefully, you realized that the things that it
promised never really came into action."
Greene had this in mind last October when
he joined with two other professors to draft an
alternative plan to the proposed "complete"
merger. They presented their proposal to
Provost John Etchemendy early this year.
The primary change enacted by the new
plan, which Greene drafted with Humanities
Prof. Mary Pratt and Comparative Literature
Prof . Ramon Saldfvar, is a new structure for in
teractions within the Division.
Three new committees — an under
graduate affairs committee, a graduate
affairs committee and a planning and
personnel committee — will
replace the executive commit
tee, which is currently the
only body within the division
that represents all of its de
partments and the only one
charged with coordinating ac
tivities among them.
While the executive committee
was composed of the chairs of the
departments and the Language
Center, and several at-large mem
bers, the new committees will in
clude a wider range of professors
to set policies that will be consistent
across all departments.
According to Greene, these
new committees will be more
conducive to cooperation
among departments, as their
constituents will not feel the
pressure to "define turf' that
department chairs faced.
The executive committee has
already been renamed the plan
ning and personnel committee,
which in the future will jointly as
sess the hiring needs of each de
partment and will decide as one
body how they should be met.
The undergraduate and gradu
ate affairs committees will handle
curricula, enrollment and degree
programs, among other issues, lor
the division's students.
'Coordinated but independent'
Greene emphasized that de
partments would still have their
own deans and administrators and
that individual departments
would remain intact.
" I he actual solution is really
not a merger. It's crucial that
people remember the depart
ments remain coordinated but
independent," Greene said.
"One of several sticking points
was the abolition of actual depart
ments. Right here, right now,
we're just not ready for that.
"()n paper, the status quo looks
very similar to what the new struc

tine is," he said.
Comparative Literature Prof.
Sepp Gumbrecht described the
changes as "very, very subtle."
Enhancing research, connecting
faculty
In addition, the plan created a
new research unit, meant to help
humanities faculty acquire grants
in greater quantity than they have
traditionally been able, Greene
said. It is also intended to enhance
the research activities already pre
sent in the division.
"We added it to this plan be
cause we wanted to make it clear
to everyone that this division was
not going to lose its research em
phasis," Greene said. He said
they intend it to "give people a
home for their research in a way
that the departments are the
home for their teaching."
Another consequence of
agreeing upon the plan is that (he
division may now move ahead
with faculty appointments that
had been put on hold last year.
The uncertainty surrounding the
future structure of the divi
sion — which peaked last spring
— had been a hindrance to re
cruiting faculty and graduate stu
dents, causing Ktchemendy to
order that the appointments wait
until the issue was settled.
The plan also ensures that the
total number of faculty in the divi
sion will not fall below the June
2001 figure of 43.5. Additions are
forthcoming.
"There are at least eight new
positions that are coming into the
Division," Greene said. "A couple
of the eight positions are envi
sioned as potentially divisional fac
ulty or can be housed in some way
that does not involve a depart
