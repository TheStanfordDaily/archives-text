he joined with two other professors to draft an
alternative plan to the proposed "complete"
merger. They presented their proposal to
Provost John Etchemendy early this year.
The primary change enacted by the new
plan, which Greene drafted with Humanities
Prof. Mary Pratt and Comparative Literature
Prof . Ramon Saldfvar, is a new structure for in

Three new committees — an under
graduate affairs committee, a graduate
affairs committee and a planning and
