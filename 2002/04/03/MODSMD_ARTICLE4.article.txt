### VAUHINI VARA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford has offered admis
sion to 2,320 students for the
Class of 2006, University officials
announced Thursday. The 1,764
recently chosen applicants will
join 556 students who have al
ready been admitted through the
early decision program. Togeth
er, they make up the most ethni
cally diverse ( lass ever admitted
to Stanford.
For the first time in the Univer
sity's history, more than hall the ad
mitted students are from minority
groups: 13 percent are African-
American, 24 percent are Asian-
American, 10 percent are Mexican-
American, 3 percent are from other
Latino groups, and 2 percent are
Native American or Native I lawai
ian. Last year, 49.9 percent of ad
mitted students represented racial
minorities.
It is these students' individual
accomplishments, though, that
make them stand out, according to
Robin Mamlet, dean of admissions
and financial aid.

"I have been continually
bowled over by the academic and
personal accomplishments of our
applicants," Mamlet said. "I keep
expecting that this excellence will
begin to feel ordinary, but it never
does: l hese young people are ab
solutely phenomenal."
1 his year, the admissions office
was even more selective than in
previous years. It accepted only
12.4 percent of applicants, as com
pared with 12.7 percent last year
and 13.2 percent the previous
year. After increasing steadily fora
few years, the number of appli
cants has leveled off at about
19,000, like last year.
The admitted students repre
sent all 50 states and the District
of Columbia, as well as 40 other
countries â€” international stu
dents make up 5 percent of the
admitted class.
Just over one-third of the ad
mitted students are from Califor
nia, followed by Texas, New York,
Illinois and Washington.
