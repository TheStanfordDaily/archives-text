lege, has attracted 1,462 international
students via aggressive marketing. A

graduate, citing Stanford and Harvard

George Beers, dean of international edu
cation, said in an interview that Foothill
placed two graduates at Harvard and
one at Yale last year, and that Stanford
takes more transfers from Foothill than
anywhere else.
"Actually, Harvard has rejected all 15 of
Foothill's transfer applicants in the past
five years. Nobody from Foothill has en
tered Yale since 1998. And Stanford enrolls
an average of three Foothill graduates a
year, counting domestic and international
students — fewer than it does from at least
eight other schools.

Mr. Beers acknowledged in a later inter

Carr, director of FoothiU's honor program,

brochure to mean 'that's where they'd like to
go. It doesn't mean they get there.
