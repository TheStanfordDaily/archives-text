1985
On April 3, 1985, The Daily printed an article
about students protesting Playboy.
"Campus anti-pornography groups have begun
their fight — currently embodied in three petition
drives — against a Playboy magazine visit to campus
scheduled for later this month.
"Playboy officials had no comment on the pro
posed protest yesterday but said their plans for in
terviewing and photographing women here were
progressing uneventfully.
"Two groups, one from the Law School and
the other comprising undergraduates, hope to
discourage Stanford women from interview
ing and posing for Playboy's planned 'Women
of the Pac-10' pictorial.
'"We want women who decide to pose to reach an
educated decision,' keeping in mind 'that pornog
raphy relates to violence against women,' said
Vanessa Poster, a spokeswoman for Stanford Stu
dents Opposed to Pornography (STOP).
"'The values that allow society to accept
Playboy allow it to accept violence against
women,' she added.
"STOP was created late last quarter when Poster
and other students learned of Playboy's scheduled
visit to campus. STOP member Laurie Wedemeyer
said he was 'outraged' when she heard of Playboy's
plans. 'I know someone will pose, and in doing so
[she'll] be representing me,' she said.
"The effort by law students, sponsored by
Women at Stanford Law and also conceived last
month, involves circulating a petition supporting
the use of 'legal and administrative' pressure to
block Playboy's use of the Stanford name, according
to group spokeswoman Hedy McAdams.
"'We don't want Playboy to exploit Stanford's
name,' she said. 'We believe the administration
doesn't want that to happen.'
"McAdams said her group collected between
500 and 600 signatures on a petition Monday and
yesterday afternoons, with signatories divided
nearly evenly between women and men. 'We're
delighted that people are so sensitive to the issue,'
she said.
"The petition states that Playboy, 'while not
the most heinous of pornographers . . . rein
forces sex stereotypes by portraying women as
sexual objects and thus furthers sexual inequali
ty in our society.'
Bottom Line: Ifs hard to believe there were men protesting
Playboy.
