Üborakm Vs. Socialism
In France
Proudhon To The Present
Monique Canto-Sperber, CNRS-EHESS (Paris)
Spring Quarter 2001/2002
Ever since the first appearance of the word "socialism" in France in
the 1830s, the issue has been raised of the compatibility of socialism
with the defense of individualism and liberty, including economic
freedom. The author who first understood the problem and shaped
its possible solutions for more than two centuries was Pierre-Joseph
Proudhon. The seminar will make a careful study of Proudhon's and
others' works on this question and plcae them in the perspective of
contemporary political thought. It will be conducted in English for
students able to read French.
The class will meet twice a week, for 90 minute sessions, during the
first five weeks of the quarter, and may be taken for 4 units. Students
will be expected to write a seminar paper to be submitted by the
tenth week of the quarter.
