On April 4, 1933, The Daily printed an article
about the continued illegality of alcohol on campus
after Prohibition was repealed.
"Sale of beer on the Stanford campus will not be
come legal after April 7.
"Advertisements of beer and other liquors and the
places whose main business is to sell them, will not ap
pear in University publications.
"These two facts stood out clearly today in the
conllict between recent Congressional legislation le
galizing the sale of 3.2 per cent beer and old local
standing statutes and rules pertaining to the same
subject.
"Queried on the sale of beer on the Stanford cam
pus, President Ray Lyman Wilbur yesterday referred
to section 172a in the California Penal Code. This
section provides that to 'sell, give away, or expose lor
sale any vinous or alcoholic liquors within one and
one-half miles' of University grounds, of a classifica
tion under which Stanford falls, is a misdemeanor.
"A professor in the Stanford law department as
serted that subsequent enactments have not affected

1933
this provision in the penal code.
"The California law upon sales of liquor near
campi is clearly unaffected by the question of whether
or not the liquor is intoxicating.
"That 'advertisements of beer and other liquors
and the places whose main business is to sell them'
will not appear in campus publications, was made
clear by President Wilbur in letters to the business
managers of campus publications. The letters mere
ly stated that to allow such advertising is 'contrary to
University policy.'
"The power of the student government to punish
students for drinking 3.2 per cent beer on the Farm is
not explicitly provided for by its Constitution.
"Article I, Section 5 of the A.S.S.U. By-Laws
states: 'The possession, transportation, or use of in
toxicating liquors by Stanford students in the Uni
versity, or elsewhere, shall be grounds for expulsion
from the University.'
Bottom Line: Wanna meet at the CoHo or the Treehouse? Ifs
only 3.1 percent beer, honest. Eh, lefs go to Ernie's.
