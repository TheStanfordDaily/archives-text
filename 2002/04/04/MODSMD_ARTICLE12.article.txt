## Stanford Genome Technology Center makes breakthrough discoveries 
### MARK BOWERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Tucked just off campus on California Ave., the
Stanford Genome 1 echnology Center plays a
prominent role in developing human genome tech
nology and initiating biotech companies. Recently, it
has participated in finding breakthrough technolo
gies that are "revolutionizing" human genome se
quencing, according to Chris Webb, who is a senior
scientist at the center.
The center was initially started to develop a tech
nology to sequence bacteria. Now that this project is
nearly complete, the center's focus has shifted to de
termining the actual function of the sequence genes.
"The technology development is almost done for
sequencing. Our focus has moved towards what is
known as functional genomics, meaning we are try
ing to determine what those genes that we now have
the sequence for actually do," Webb said.
Webb's research involves developing an extreme
ly high-powered sequencing technology known as
nanopore sequencing. The process uses an electric
field to pull DNA through a tiny pore barely wider
than the DNA itself. While the DNA moves through
the pore, an electric current runs across it, so that
the electrical resistance can determine the sequence.
This finding could eventually allow researchers to
sequence the length of an entire human genome in
less than an hour and with one machine, rather than
requiring many years and lab workers, as in the orig
inal human genome project. The nanopore se
quencer's speed would make it possible to sequence
the genes of nearly every organism and human
being quickly and inexpensively.
The center works toward making common exper
imental tools and processes faster and cheaper. For
example, it developed an automated oligonucleotide
synthesis machine, which builds small strips of DNA
commonly used in biology experiments. Without
these machines, many experiments would not be
possible due to funding and time constraints.
Recently, the center has also increased its connec
tions with the business world. Approximately 12
companies or divisions of existing companies have

arisen from the Center's developments, including
Affymetrix, Gene Machines, and Double Twist.
"There has been an emphasis at the Genome
Technology Center to not just do the proof of prin
ciple experiments, publish a paper and then leave it
at that. The best way to make the technology avail
able is to start a company that has the quality control
and manufacturing to scale up the projects so it can
just be bought off the shelf," Webb said.
The Center brings together experts from many
scientific disciplines, whose cooperation results in a
larger number of technological breakthroughs.
"1 believe that science is heading towards inter
disciplinary projects," Webb said. "Having the
physicists, chemists and biologists all in the same
building lead to breakthroughs. I think it is a good
model for Bio-X [the interdisciplinary program at
Stanford]."
However, this model of cooperation between dis
ciplines leads to challenging funding requirements.
"Funding has been difficult because it is general
ly for traditional biology experiments. Often biolo
gists do not think technology development is critical,
creative or worth rewarding. You are going after
funding from traditional sources that are used to
doing things in traditional way," Webb said.
Nonetheless, the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency has been more willing to take the
risk of funding higher payoff projects, according to
Webb. DARPA is a Department of Defense funding
agency that funds projects that are long-range,
high-risk, and high-reward, like those taken on by
the Center.
