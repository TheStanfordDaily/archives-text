# Private gifts reach all-time high
## Donations to Stanford are second largest in the nation 
### KRISTIN SCHLEICHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford received the second
highest amount of private dona
tions to any American college or
university last year, a RAND Cor
poration study recently reported.
Stanford, with contributions to
taling $469 million, slipped from
its top position on the 2000 list to
second behin i Harvard's $683
million in 2001.
Overall, private contributions
to United Suites colleges and uni
versities reached an all-time high
of $24.2 billion in 2001. That sum
represents an increase of approx
imately $ 1 billion, or 4.3 percent,
over the 2000 figure.
"The total is surprisingly large in
light of the overall sharp decline in
stock market values over this peri
od," RAND's Council for Aid to Ed
ucation said. The non-profit Coun
cil for Aid to Education has tracked

gifts to institutes of higher educa
tion in an annual survey since 1952.
Although total giving reached
a record dollar amount, the rate of
increase actually slowed in 2001.
In fiscal year 2000, giving had in
creased by 13.7 percent.
"It wasn't a banner year, but it
was still a lot better than it might
have been," Ann E. Kaplan, the
study director, told The New
York limes.
Most of the growth in dona
lions came from non-corporate
foundations, which increased
their contributions by 18.1 per
cent in the last year, fora total of
$6 billion. Foundations now com
prise a quarter of all voluntary giv
ing to colleges and universities, in
part due to a growing trend on
the part of families to establish
their own foundadons. Still, this
year's surge defied even re
searchers' predictions.
"1 expected growth in giving
by foundations to be there, but 1
didn't expect it to be nearly as
high as it was," Kaplan said.
"There was so much bad news in
the stock market, especially dur
ing that fiscal period, with the

Standard 8c Poor's index, the New
York Stock Exchange and the
Nasdaq [index] all down."
Alumni gifts, traditionally the
largest segment of private fund
ing, held nearly steady in 2001.
Alumni still edged out founda
tions with a 28 percent share,
but grew only 0.4 percent to
$6.83 billion.
Non-alumni individuals, cor
porations and religious and other
organizations accounted for $5.2
billion, $4.35 billion, and $1.82
billion respectively.
Nationwide, the gifts were split
fairly evenly between current op
erating expenses and capital im
provement programs such as
buildings or endowments. Gifts
for operating purposes had the
slight edge this year, with $12.2
billion versus $ 12.0 billion for cap
ital purposes.
Stanford's highest giving pri
ority now is its Campaign for
Undergraduate Education,
launched by University Presi
dent Hennessy in 2000 with the
goal to raise $ 1 billion over five
years.
This is "the largest campaign
specifically for undergraduate
education ever undertaken by
any university," Hennessy
wrote in a 2000 letter introduc
ing the program.
As of March 31, Stanford's
campaign had already raised
$733 million, although a portion
of that total reflected as-yet unmet
commitments to match dona
tions.
Columbia University, with
$359 million in 2001, was just be
hind Stanford. Indiana Universi
ty was the most-funded public
university, in seventh place with
$301 million.
