## The 						Stanford Daily Leaving early not necessarily the wrong choice 
### 
Published Since 1891

Some in the Stanford community may be
tempted to condemn junior swingman
Casey Jacobsen for his decision to de
clare his eligibility for the National Bas
ketball Association draft, arguing that the choice
is money-motivated and indicates a lack of re
spect for the value of education. However, in
light of the many other Stanford students who
stop out or leave school early to pursue exciting
and unique career opportunities, we believe
such condemnation would be hypocritical.
We appreciate the contributions Jacobsen
has made to the team and the community dur
ing his three years at Stanford, and we support
him in his decision to test the waters in the June
draft. Yet we also strongly hope that, if Jacobsen
does leave, he returns to Stanford in the future
to complete his bachelor's degree, as he has
promised his coach and his parents he will do.

Since Jacobsen has not hired an agent, he can
still withdraw from the draft following the pre
draft camps if he feels his he will not be chosen
highly enough. While fans would obviously pre
fer to see Jacobsen back at school and leading
the Cardinal squad next year, having players
turn professional early is a necessary conse
quence of the strong athletic program on which
we pride ourselves. The 100 percent gradua
tion rate of men's basketball players at the Uni
versity is a laudable record, but that does not
mean that it is always wrong for an athlete to
leave before the completion of his or her degree.
Cardinal athletes in other sports, including
golfer Tiger Woods and women's tennis star
Laura Granville, have left before graduating
without much fuss from the general student
body. We wonder why Stanford players in
other sports are not scrutinized for decisions to

leave early, while basketball fans have been wor
ried for some time about the possibility of Ja
cobsen's departure.
Students come to Stanford for the education
offered here and the career opportunities that
education will afford them. Any student who
has the opportunity to pursue his or her child
hood career dreams, as Jacobsen does, would
certainly be tempted to take advantage of it.
Jacobsen's talent has earned him this chance,
and we can see why he wouldn't want to squan
der it. Consider the many computer science
students of the dot-com era who left the Farm
for greener pastures.
However, we would love to see Jacobsen
honor his promise to earn his degree at some
point, even if he leaves Stanford now. Stanford
continually emphasizes that our athletes are
students first; their scholarships give them the

chance to earn a great education while con
tributing to a strong sports program.
Just as Stanford values Jacobsen's contribu
tions on the court, we hope that Jacobsen val
ues the education he has received here
enough to graduate. If Jacobsen does not
complete his degree, it would show disregard
for the top-notch education he was offered in
conjunction with his basketball scholarship,
indicating that his athletic endeavors are more
important to him than his academics. This at
titude seems out of place at Stanford.
While many athletes at other institutions
have left college and never bothered to com
plete their degrees, Jacobsen should buck this
trend and prove that Stanford players truly
value both aspects of their scholar-athlete expe
rience. In doing so, he could set a fine example
for other basketball stars around the country.
