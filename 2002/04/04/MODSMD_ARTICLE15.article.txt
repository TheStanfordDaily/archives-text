## Building a wall of shame 
### 
The constant violence in the Mid
dle East is outrageous. Every
day a Palestinian suicide
bomber enters an Israeli mar
ket, a nightclub, a pizzeria, a roadblock, a
bus or a hotel. He (or now she) kills one,
three, five, nine, 15, 30, who cares how
many people. The result is the same —
the blood flows, the terror spreads.
In response, the Israeli military rum
bles into a new town and destroys a new
building and kills more Palestinians.
Which town, which building, how many
people? The result is the same — the
blood flows, the terror spreads.
All the blood and bullets axnd burn
ing buildings are so numbing that, right
now, some believe the only solution for

Israel and Palestine is to
throw in the towel, at
least temporarily. The
Saudi peace-for-land
proposal is attractive
and I hope against hope
that it becomes reality.
But how does it deal
with the rage that fes
ters in the poverty of
Palestinian refugee

camps? Could it be that the only way
out right now is to build a wall between
Israel and the West Bank?
Charles Krauthammer, a conservative
columnist for the Washington Post, was
the first person I've heard articulate this
view, though I'm sure he wasn't the first
to come up with the idea.
In his column, "Mideast Violence: the
Only Way ()ut," published Aug. 16,2001,
well into the current 18-month intifada
but predating the recent spasm of ultravi
olence, Krauthammer wrote that the only
way to ensure the survival of Israel is for
the Israelis to destroy the Palestinian state
structure, what he calls "Arafat's police
state infrastructure." Then he recom
mends that they stay in the Palestinian
territory just long enough to build a wall
between it and Israel.
In August, the wall sounded absurd to
me. At the time, just a year removed from
the promise of Camp David, which nearly
brought a comprehensive solution to the
Israeli-Palestinian issue, who could argue
against engagement and negotiation?
But when I read a similar suggestion
this week, I was more open.
Last week, Martin Van Creveld, a his
torian at ihe Hebrew University in
Jerusalem and a noted expert on the
changing nature of warfare, published an
essay in Newsweek called "Build a Wall to
the Sky.. His theory is that to keep Is
rael from internal destruction, from
crumbling into the chaos of a Jew-versus-
Jew civil war that would invite Arab ag
gression. "it is necessary to pull out of the
occupied areas and build a wall. In theory,
that wall should be so tall that not even the
birds can fly over it."
I doubt that such a solution will stop all

the violence. I doubt that it will solve all of
Israel's security problems or will lead to
demonstrably better lives for the people
of Palestine or Israel.
But, without a wall, I have no doubt
that the death and terror of recent weeks
and months will continue unabated until
more extreme solutions are found. Al
ready, there are loud calls within Israel
that to solve the problem, Israel must
move the 2 million Palestinians out of the
West Bank. Such plans for relocation
echo the language of ethnic cleansing we
have heard used in Rwanda and Yu
goslavia and, 60 years ago, against the
Jews of Europe.
Maybe a wall could help avoid such a
ruinous ending. A wall, or fence, has al
ready proven effective along the Israeli
border with the Gaza Strip. Palestinians
routinely lob mortars and, occasionally,
fire rockets over the Gaza border, but the
impact has been muted compared to the
destruction inflicted from Ramallah and
elsewhere in the West Bank.
While the overwhelming benefit of
such a plan would go to Israel, the Pales
tinians could also gain. In recent years,
they have often ignored reality. While
Arafat and others mouth the words of
peace, great portions of the society re
main committed to the complete de
struction of Israel. To that end, the
Palestinians have neglected developing
their own state and society. And, simi
larly, their oil-rich Arab neighbors have
ignored their complicity in the Palestini
ans' problems by throwing all of the
blame on Israel. Hopefully, then, sepa
ration would give Palestine time to grow
on its own and would give the Arab
world the opportunity to embrace the
Palestinians.
It's easy to see a wall as a cop-out, a way
to avoid tlie hard work and hard choices
necessary to resolve a conflict such as this
one. Eventually, the underlying issues
will have to be dealt with again, for as his
tory has shown us, no wall keeps people
apart forever.
This aspect of the idea troubles me to
no end. I am a firm believer that the inte
gration and mixing of peoples leads to
constructive conflict that, eventually, cre
ates a stronger, richer, livelier society.
Our own country is a perfect example of
how diversity breeds strength.
But the U.S. is not a universally appli
cable example. One need look no fur
ther than the Star of David on the Israeli
flag to see how far diversity flies there.
And even if Israel somehow morphed
into a truly pluralistic democracy, with
out similar transformations by its Mus
lim neighbors, Israel's new democratic
institutions would likely be taken advan
tage of until Jews were an inconsequen
tial minority in the state they themselves
founded. Cosmopolitan dreams don't al
