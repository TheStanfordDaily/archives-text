'Rage' guitarist urges students to
sign WRC petition
I'm writing to support the concerned
student-athletes at Stanford. These ath
letes are asking for your help to hold
your school accountable to its own ethi
cal standards.
The issue at hand is sweatshops. There
is a good chance that any hat, t-shirt or
jacket that bears the Stanford logo —
and, in fact, most manufactured cloth
ing—was made by poorly paid factory
workers laboring in terrible conditions.
Had your own life story been slightly dif
ferent, perhaps a little shorter on luck and
opportunity, that factory worker could
have been you.
I'm willing to bet that every one of you
would feel a little more comfortable shop
ping in the student store if you knew that
the products within were not made by ex
ploiting people.
The Stanford athletes are asking you to
do one simple thing: sign a petition. The
petition calls for Stanford to affiliate with
an organization called the Workers'
Rights Consortium.
The consortium is an independent
monitoring agency which checks to make
sure that the workers who manufacture
university merchandise are being treated
and paid fairly. As its current means of
"ensuring" fair labor practices, Stanford is
relying on Nike's affiliation with a sham
organization called the Fair Labor Associ
ation , which was created, and is controlled
by, the very same corporations who are
being monitored.
In other words, Stanford is trusting the
fox to guard the henhouse. That's fine if
you just want to maintain the appearance
of caring, but if you want truth and real
justice, your best bet is to back the Work
ers' Rights Consortium.
College campuses across the county

liave followed this same path, students
telling their university that they don't
want their schools to exploit workers in
their names. Sometimes this call turns
into a grueling battle between stubborn
administrators and passionate advocates
of justice — when money is involved, uni
versities often have trouble reading their
own codes of conduct.
Maybe you would be willing to join a
long struggle like that and fight until
you've won. Or maybe you wouldn't. But
signing a petition seems like a pretty easy
first step, both to try to help improve the
lives of factory workers and to let your ad
ministration know that you're not so
blinded by tests and lectures that you don't
care about your fellow human beings.

Palestinian refugees must have
right of return
I write in response to Oded Wurman's
letter ("Luckovich cartoon accurate," 3/3).
First, the Palestinian refugees must
have the right of return. As historian Nor
man Finkelstein has conclusively demon
strated, Israel deliberately drove hun
dreds of thousands of Palestinians from
their land in 1948. The right of these peo
ple to resume their lives in their homes
and the homes of their parents certainly
outweighs the Zionist desire to maintain a
Jewish majority in Israel. Furthermore,
there is no evidence that suicide bombings
will continue once Israel respects the
rights of Palestinians, such as giving them
the right of return.
Second, Arafat had no choice hut to re
ject the "peace" offers made by Israel of
late. Ehud Barak's proposals at Camp
David, for instance, did not give the pro

posed Palestinian statelet the right to con
trol its own air space, borders, water or
trade. Further, under Barak's proposal the
West Bank would not be a contiguous
piece of land, but would be cut into ribbons
by Israeli roads. Some generous offer!
Lastly, I will point out that historically
the seeds of the current conflict lay at the
feet ol Zionists. Indeed, as Zionists such as
Herzel, Weizmann and Jabotinsky laid
plans for the colonization of Mandatory
Palestine, they refused to recognize the
right ol the Arabs who already lived there
and had done so for hundreds of years.
Instead, they denied the existence of the
Palestinians by repeating the ludicrous
slogan, "A land without people fora peo
ple without land."

St. Louis resident not thrilled by
Stanford Band performance
I am writing to express my gratitude
for the opportunity to hear the Stanford
Band here in St. Louis.
I was in the middle of an important
telephone interview when the school's
band chose to grace the sidewalk outside
my office with spirited renderings of pop
ular pep songs. What fun!
I was really bummed out that 1 didn't
have the chance to make it to the Edward
Jones Home for the basketball games that
day, so you can only imagine how pleased
I was that your band took the time to
bring their music to my workplace sever
al miles away.
I m sure others who had to drop every
thing they were doing so they could be en
tertained felt the same way. After all, I can
think of no more appropriate place for
this sort of thing than in a business district
on a Thursday afternoon.
Unfortunately, the person I was inter
viewing didn't quite get the joke. I tried to
explain, but he couldn't hear me, and I
couldn't hear him either. And so my inter
view turned into a disaster.
But never mind. What could be more
important than watching a bunch of self
absorbed, coddled, never-worked-a-real
job-in-their-lives college students prance
around with your school's mascot proudly

leading the way? I am certain that your
school's administration welcomes such an
tics during finals, perhaps in the library
where students under heavy deadline
pressure are working, much as I was when
the Band showed up.
My regard for Stanford, which I had al
ways believed to be a place where people
respected the rights of others and acted
accordingly, is now at an all-time high.
Your Band members should be congratu
lated for being such fine ambassadors.
In closing, this crap may fly in Palo Alto,
but you've got one hell of a nerve to bring
it here.
