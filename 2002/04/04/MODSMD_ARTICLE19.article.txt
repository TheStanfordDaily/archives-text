## Dr. Cheryl Walker has been charged with her grandmother's murder 
### YASI HASHEMI EDITORIAL STAFF 
Cheryl Walker, an assistant
professor of gynecology and ob
stetrics at the Stanford Medical
Center, was recently charged
along with her mother, Janice
Walker, in the death of her 95-
year-old grandmother, Mary
Koleber.
The police claim Koleber was
found dead last year in Walker's
San Jose home after being
pumped full of a combination of
morphine and other painkillers.
Police said the mother-daughter
pair had drained Koleber's bank
accounts prior to her death and
changed her will to allow her
$400,000 estate to be be
queathed to them.
A 1,200-page transcript of the
grand jury testimony in the case
was released on Monday.
Walker's brother, Grant,
and her cousin, Joanne Pi
otrowski, were among those to
testify before the grand jury.
Both revealed that Walker suf
fered a miserable childhood
and attributed it to the physi
cal abuse of her mother and
the alcoholism and adultery of
her father.
Grant Walker, now a stock
broker in the Midwest, also ex
plained that their mother had
an intensely hostile relation
ship with the late Koleber, her
own mother.
"There was never a lot of
love," Grant Walker said to the
Mercury News. "I grew up with
her violent. I have chipped
teeth, probably a couple of
scars. She [Janice Walker] was

pretty much wacky with all of
us, particularly my younger sis
ter, Cheryl."
Cheryl Walker reunited with
her mother in 1997 after over
coming the trauma of her child
hood and achieving academic
success. She attended Prince
ton University and Smith Col
lege in Massachusetts, and re
ceived a medical degree from
UC-San Francisco.
Walker went on to con
tribute to the fight against
AIDS in Uganda and eventual
ly received a teaching position
at the hospital.
In 1999 Walker moved to
San Jose with her mother, and
the two began to travel back
and forth to South Florida to
visit Koleber.
According to the testimony,
during one of the trips they
arranged for Janice Walker to be
granted power of attorney and
eventually put all of Koleber's
estate under their names.
In February 2001, Walker
and her mother moved Kole
ber to their San Jose home.
Koleber passed away three
months later.
Charges were not filed until
after Piotrowski notified author
ities of Koleber's move to Cali
fornia — which she considered
sudden —just before her sched
uled cremation. It was then that
an autopsy revealed her body
was full of morphine.
Walker had told police that
Koleber had died of pneumo
nia and wak not under any
medication.
Cheryl and Janice Walker's
lawyers have maintained that
their clients are innocent. Cheryl
was released on a $1 million
bond this month, but is on ad
ministrative leave from Stan
ford. Janice remains in jail on a
$2.5 million bond.
