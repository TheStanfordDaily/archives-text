# Controversy arises in academic decathlon
## 
### 
LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) —
The question of who won the
Texas Academic Decathlon has
stumped some of the finest minds
in the state.
Is it Lubbock High, which was
declared the winner? Or is it
Pasadena's J. Frank Dobie High,
which says there were scoring
problems and wants a retest to
determine who will represent
Texas at next week's national
competition?
The battle of the brains is now
in court.
"It's blowing our minds, as you
can imagine," said Shonna Diste
fano, coordinator of the Texas De
cathlon Organization, a defen
dant in lawsuits filed by both
schools. "This pains me because
we're using this scholarship
money that we normally give to
students for litigation."
Officials at Dobie High say they
won the competition, in which
nine-member teams match wits in
such subjects as language, litera
ture, art and economics on written
tests, essays and quiz show-like oral
exams. The winners get $1,200
apiece for college; second place is
worth $800 each.
After the meet ended last
month, Dobie High's coach real
ized that one of student Kevin Ho's
score sheets was misplaced and had
been excluded from his school's

final tally, which would have
pushed his team into first place.
Decathlon officials said the sheet
was not turned in properly, mean
ing Lubbock High had won and
Dobie High was second.
Dobie High took its case to
court in Houston last week, with
coach Richard Golenko arguing
that Ho's test should have been
counted and that at least one
other test was not tallied correctly.
Questions also were raised about
whether a score was missing fora
Lubbock student.
A state judge found "serious is
sues in the validity of the scores" of
both schools and ordered a re
match.
Meanwhile, Ho's score sheet
was shredded as part of the de
cathlon association's standard
procedure.
Two days later, the Lubbock
school district went to court in
Lubbock and was granted a tem
porary restraining order to keep
the decathlon association from
holding a rematch and certifying
those results.
"We're not going to sit back and
let someone take the champi
onship from Lubbock because
Lubbock's team did not feel they
did one thing wrong," Superinten
dent Jack Clemmons said. "We're
going to fight to let the kids retain
the championship."
