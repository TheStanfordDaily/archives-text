# White House explains rising gasoline prices

### 
WASHING I ON (AP) â€”
President George Bush's
spokesman yesterday blamed
climbing U.S. pump prices on
Mideast tension, the recovering
economy and seasonal factors,
but expressed no concern about
a possible Iraqi-led oil embargo
against the United States.
Gasoline prices have jumped
23 cents per gallon over the last
month, and U.S. crude prices
have jumped by 3(i percent
since the beginning of Febru
ary. Motorists are likely to see
higher prices at the pump as the
peak summer driving season
approaches, energy analysts
said Wednesday.
White House spokesman Ari
Fleischer said Bush "has noted"

the rising gasoline prices, and
said escalating violence in Israel
is partly responsible. The fact
that the economy is in the early
stages of a recovery is also to
blame, Fleischer said, because it
can drive up demand, which
can drive up prices.
And he said this year's in
crease follows similar spring
spikes in the last several years.
Fleischer used the rising
prices to renew his call for the
Senate to pass Bush's energy
plan, which stalled after House
passage last year. Bush's pro
posal would expand domestic
petroleum sources, a step the
White House says would de
crease the nation's reliance on
imported oil.
