"Hail to the Chief' after No. 2
Stanford defeated the Universi
ty of San Francisco 4-1 on Tues
day night, but it certainly
would have been appropriate.

MEN'S BASEBALL
Tuesday: No. 2 Stanford 4,
San Francisco 1
Friday: No. 2 Stanford vs. Ari
zona, 6:00 p.m., Tuscon, Ariz.

Junior Cardinal reliever Darrin
Naatjes — known by his team
mates as "Chief" — sparkled in a
three-inning stint on the hill and
subdued the Dons lineup fora key
stretch to earn his second victory of
the season.
Naatjes, a 6-foot-7, 240-pound
tight end on the Stanford football
team, lowered his ERA to 1.17 in
seven appearances, during which
opponents have hit at a paltry .143
clip. He has successfully made the
transition from a rarely utilized in
field reserve for the past two sea

sons to an important member of
the Cardinal bullpen this year.
"He hasn't pitched before but
he's got a great arm, he's very ath
letic and he's a great competitor,"
said head coach Mark Marquess.
"So we felt like we would try [to use
him as a pitcher] and he's taken to
it. And he's going to get nothing
but better."
Naatjes notched a career
high tying four strikeouts in
three innings of scoreless relief
against the Dons. He mixed
curveballs into his fastball
dominated pitch selection,
dropping several of them in for
strikes while reaching up to 94
m.p.h. on the radar gun with
his heat.
"I've been working a lot on the
oIT-speed, which was the biggest
transition for me to make," Naatjes
said. "I've been working with
[pitching coach Tom Kunis] a lot
and I think he's gaining a little
more confidence with me throw
ing off-speed."
The "Chief' wasn't the only
Cardinal reliever to impress the
Sunken Diamond crowd of 2,187.
Sophomore Drew Erlich started
the game with three innings of

one-hit ball, while junior Ryan Mc-
Cally earned his fourth save of the
season by closing out the final two
innings without allowing a hit.
Sophomore David O'Hagan al
lowed one run and two hits in one
inning of work.
"I thought we pitched well,"
Marguess said. "That's what we
wanted to try to accomplish
tonight, to get three or four guys
some work, and we were able to do
that so it was good."
Sophomore outfielder Johnny
Ash slapped a two-out, two-RBI
single in the sixth to give Stanford
a 4-0 advantage. His role has di
minished this season, but he's pro
duced 5 RBI while batting .357 in
just 14 at-bats in 2002.
"Mentally, I have to prepare
myself the entire game to know
that I might be needed to help the
team win in any situation possi
ble," said Ash. "I just have to pre
pare myself to excel in that one
brief moment I get out there on
the field."
Stanford scored all four of its
runs in the sixth off Dons starter
T.J. Franco. After he allowed just
two hits in five innings, Franco's
evening soured as he walked two,
gave up three singles and threw a
wild pitch en route to his fifth loss
of the year.
While Ash's pinch-hit secured
the Stanford win, the Cardinal tal
lied just six hits all night, just four
days after it managed only five hits
in a 2-0,10-inningloss to Texas. As
Stanford heads into its first Pacific
10 Conference series this weekend
in Tucson, Marquess acknowl
edged that the recent lack of offen
sive production is a minor cause
for concern.
"I'd love to be scoring 10 runs
and playing great defense and
shutting 'em all out, but that
doesn't always happen," he said.
"But if I had to pick one thing then
having the hitting down a little bit
is a lot better than having the
pitching down or the defense."
Riding a streak of 10 consecu
tive regular season series wins,
Stanford travels to Tucson to take
on Arizona and will become the
last Pac-10 team to start 2002
league play.

shutting 'em all out, but that
doesn't always happen," he said.
"But if I had to pick one thing then
having the hitting down a little bit
is a lot better than having the
pitching down or the defense."

Junior Cardinal reliever Darrin
Naatjes — known by his team
mates as "Chief" — sparkled in a
three-inning stint on the hill and
subdued the Dons lineup fora key
stretch to earn his second victory of
the season.
Naatjes, a 6-foot-7, 240-pound
tight end on the Stanford football
team, lowered his ERA to 1.17 in
seven appearances, during which
opponents have hit at a paltry .143
clip. He has successfully made the
transition from a rarely utilized in
field reserve for the past two sea

sons to an important member of
the Cardinal bullpen this year.
"He hasn't pitched before but
he's got a great arm, he's very ath
letic and he's a great competitor,"
said head coach Mark Marquess.
"So we felt like we would try [to use
him as a pitcher] and he's taken to
it. And he's going to get nothing
but better."
Naatjes notched a career
high tying four strikeouts in
three innings of scoreless relief
against the Dons. He mixed
curveballs into his fastball
dominated pitch selection,
dropping several of them in for
strikes while reaching up to 94
m.p.h. on the radar gun with
his heat.
"I've been working a lot on the
oIT-speed, which was the biggest
transition for me to make," Naatjes
said. "I've been working with
[pitching coach Tom Kunis] a lot
and I think he's gaining a little
more confidence with me throw
ing off-speed."
The "Chief' wasn't the only
Cardinal reliever to impress the
Sunken Diamond crowd of 2,187.
Sophomore Drew Erlich started
the game with three innings of

one-hit ball, while junior Ryan Mc-
Cally earned his fourth save of the
season by closing out the final two
innings without allowing a hit.
Sophomore David O'Hagan al
lowed one run and two hits in one
inning of work.
"I thought we pitched well,"
Marguess said. "That's what we
wanted to try to accomplish
tonight, to get three or four guys
some work, and we were able to do
that so it was good."
Sophomore outfielder Johnny
Ash slapped a two-out, two-RBI
single in the sixth to give Stanford
a 4-0 advantage. His role has di
minished this season, but he's pro
duced 5 RBI while batting .357 in
just 14 at-bats in 2002.
"Mentally, I have to prepare
myself the entire game to know
that I might be needed to help the
team win in any situation possi
ble," said Ash. "I just have to pre
pare myself to excel in that one
brief moment I get out there on
the field."
Stanford scored all four of its
runs in the sixth off Dons starter
T.J. Franco. After he allowed just
two hits in five innings, Franco's
evening soured as he walked two,
gave up three singles and threw a
wild pitch en route to his fifth loss
of the year.
While Ash's pinch-hit secured
the Stanford win, the Cardinal tal
lied just six hits all night, just four
days after it managed only five hits
in a 2-0,10-inningloss to Texas. As
Stanford heads into its first Pacific
10 Conference series this weekend
in Tucson, Marquess acknowl
edged that the recent lack of offen
sive production is a minor cause
for concern.
"I'd love to be scoring 10 runs
and playing great defense and
shutting 'em all out, but that
doesn't always happen," he said.
"But if I had to pick one thing then
having the hitting down a little bit
is a lot better than having the
pitching down or the defense."

tive regular season series wins,
