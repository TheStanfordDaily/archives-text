reer-best time of 1:55.58.

and she always brings the best out of me," said Rip
ple. "I swam my career-best time so I can't be dis
appointed with that, even though I would obvious
ly have liked to have won."

credible," Quick said. "It was her last chance, and it
was a great victory. Nobody's ever given Stanford
swimming more than Shelly Ripple."
Kirk beat Olympic champion Agnes Kovacs of
Arizona State to win the 200 breaststroke with a time
