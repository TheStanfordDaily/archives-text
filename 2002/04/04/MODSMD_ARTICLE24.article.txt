Forget everything.
Forget the nine losses, forget the
mediocre third-place finish at the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation champi
onships, forget the No. 11 ranking.
Forget the nine wins, forget the win
over No. 2 Oklahoma, forgetjunior Mar
shall Erwin's No. 1 national ranking on
the rings.
Forget it all.
* However unfair it may seem, the lega
cy of the 2002 men's gymnastics season
will be largely determined starting today,
as the Cardinal faces 11 other teams in
the NCAA Championships at the Lloyd

MEN'S GYMNASTICS
Thursday-Saturday: No. 10
Stanford competes in the NCAA
Championships, Norman, Okla.

Noble Center in Norman, Okla.
Compete well and the team will es
cape last year's 2-8 record, send their se
niors and 30-year-veteran head coach off
with a hearty farewell, and set a founda
tion for next year's seven returning
members.
Perform poorly, and the nine losses
will be justified, and a season's worth of
work will come to precious little.
"We've been counting down the days
for the NCAA championships, and now

it's here," said senior Ricardo Andrade.
"It will be a dog fight."
"Even though two or three teams
dominated the regular season, there are
12 legitimate title contenders going into
the meet."
The field will be highlighted by
powerhouses No. 1 Penn State and de
fending champion No. 2 Ohio State, as
well as the MPSF champion No. 3 Ok
lahoma, who the Cardinal upset three
weeks ago.
The 2002 squad, led by nine upper
classmen, six of whom are seniors, and
veteran Coach Sadao Hamada will have
no shortage of experience when they
compete in Oklahoma.
The team will also have a healthy
number of nationally ranked competi
tors leading it to nationals. Junior Mar
shall Erwin tops the list as the nation's
No. 1 rings specialist, after claiming
three 9.950s this season as well as claim
ing a tie for the MPSF championship in
that event.
Sophomore Dan Gill is ranked No. 2
nationally on the vault, while Andrade is
sixth on the horizontal bar. Adding some
stability during the whole meet will be se
nior David Durante, No. 4 on the all
around, who also claimed third on the
parallel bars at the conference champi
onships.
The Cardinal will need all four to be
in top form in Norman. For as much as
the team has battled this season, its two
biggest problems have been maintaining
a consistent effort and having the team's
supporting members hold their own
against other teams.
As the team has progressed through
this season, two events have emerged
as an Achilles heel: the pommel horse
and the parallel bars. On the pommel
horse, seniors Justin Berkman and
Cade Raggio and juniors Erwin and


KATHERINE LIU/The Stanford Daily File
Senior David Durante concentrates on nailing his routine. The pommel horse has been a
problem event for the Cardinal in past competitions this season.
Matt McLean will be key in sup
porting Gill and Durante.
On the parallel bars, Raggio
and McLean will again have to
support Gill and Durante. But
just as importantly, junior Paul
O'Leary and freshman Kelly
Lang will need to turn in sea
son-high performances to give
the team a chance.
Lang, along with fellow fresh
men Daniel Torres-Rangel and
Bryan McColgan will especially

have to be waryof any mental mis
takes, having never competed at
the NCAA championships.
The team will be going to na
tionals after coming off" a disap
pointing third-place finish at the
MPSF championships, in which
the Cardinal earned a total score
of 207.650.
Having beaten Oklahoma the
week before, Stanford was blown
out of the water by that same
team, as Oklahoma resounding
ly beat the Cardinal with a score
of 219.225. California also out
performed Stanford for the
fourth time this season, earning
a 217.200.

"The conference meet was a lit
tle disappointing because we
didn't get many hits, but not com
pletely unexpected because
[ Hamada] increased our difficulty
yet again," Andrade said.
"We've been doing these rou
tines in practice, and there will be
little room for error at nationals,"
he added.
Near-perfect routines, a bit of
grit, strong performances by the
supporting cast, and, to an extent,
some old-fashioned luck will be re
quired for the team to compete
well at nationals.
.And they'll have to remember
to forget the regular season.
