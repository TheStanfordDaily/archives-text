fensive contributors were junior
outside hitter Will Curtis, who post

Over spring break, the Car
dinal began preparing for the
conference tournament with
victories over No. 14 Long
Beach State (11-16, 7-12) and
UC-San Diego (5-9, 1-18).
In the match-up against the
49ers on March 1, a heated
five-game match ended in Car
dinal favor, 30-27, 26-30, 26-
30, 30-28, 15-11. Last Friday's
victory, however, was a far eas
ier battle for the Cardinal.
Junior opposite Curt Toppel
was a major contributor with a
match-high 23 kills and a hit
ting percentage of .450. Red
shirt freshman setter Kevin
Hansen added 62 assists, 5
kills, and 3 aces.
These efforts helped Stan
ford to overpower Long Beach
State .500 to .171 in the first
game and .392 to .323 overall.
On Saturday, a victory over
UC-San Diego secured a place
for Stanford at the MPSF Con
ference Tournament, putting
the team one step closer to the
NCAA Tournament.
Stanford overpowered the
Tritons, 30-24, 30-23, 30-20,
outhitting them .464 to .155 in
the match. Stanford posted a

hitting percentage as high as
.800 while UC-San Diego hit as
low as .035 in an impressive dis
play of Cardinal dominance.
Having lost only one of its past
seven matches, the Stanford squad
looks to storm into the MPSF tour
nament on a four-game winning
streak, and a record 7-1 in its last
eight games.
If the last matchup is any indi
cation, Stanford can expect to end
the regular season on a high note.
In the last match against the
Anteaters on March Bth, the Car
dinal swept, 30-23, 30-21,30-24.
UC-Irvine fell to Hawaii in
three short matches last week, for
feiting its chance to play at the
MPSF tournament.
Just being able to participate in
the MPSF Tournament is victory
itself; since the MPSF brags 10 of
the country's top fifteen teams.
And although the MPSF con
tains many of the most competi
tive teams, only two can qualify
for the national tournament.
The winner of the conference
tournament will earn an auto
matic bid along with the selec
tion of another team on the basis
of this season's performance.
"If we put our best string of
volleyball together in April, we
definitely have a shot at win
ning the tournament," said
head coach Don Shaw.
Stanford's regular season
record makes it unlikely that it
will win the second bid, but the
Cardinal can secure a spot in
the NCAAs by winning the up
coming Tournament.

Just being able to participate in
the MPSF Tournament is victory
itself; since the MPSF brags 10 of
the country's top fifteen teams.
And although the MPSF con
tains many of the most competi
tive teams, only two can qualify
for the national tournament.
The winner of the conference
tournament will earn an auto
matic bid along with the selec
tion of another team on the basis
of this season's performance.
"If we put our best string of
volleyball together in April, we
definitely have a shot at win
ning the tournament," said
head coach Don Shaw.
Stanford's regular season
record makes it unlikely that it
will win the second bid, but the
Cardinal can secure a spot in
the NCAAs by winning the up
coming Tournament.
