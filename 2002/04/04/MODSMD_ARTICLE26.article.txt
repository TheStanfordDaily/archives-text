The trip will mark the second weekend of
Pac-10 play for the Cardinal, which is riding
high off of two big wins Tuesday night at home
against No. 11 Fresno State (28-13).
The double header was the second meeting
for the teams, as Stanford beat the Bulldogs
across the country at the prestigious NFCA
('.lassie earlier in the season, where the Cardinal
finished third.
The Bulldogs traveled the Farm seeking re
venge, but would not even be able to produce a
run as junior pitchers Tori Nyberg and Mau
reen LeCocq both threw shutouts to record
Stanford's 29th and 30th victories of the season.

In the first contest Nyberg and Fresno
State starter Jamie Southern dueled for the
first three innings, holding both lineups
silent at the plate.
But, Southern would not be able to quell the
bats of" the Cardinal any longer as Stanford ex
ploded at the plate in the bottom of the fourth,
scoring three runs.
The senior combination of shortstop Robin

Walker, centerfielder Jessica Mendozaand first
baseman Sarah Beeson produced three consec
utive singles to lead off the inning and load the
bases with no outs.
junior second baseman Kira Ching then
came through in the clutch, sending a deep sac
rifice fly ball to right field plating Walker.

Senior Jessica Draemel takes a hard swing, but Stanford showed its defensive prowess this past week
end as it shutout Fresno State twice.
Sophomore catcher Jessica Allister
followed Calling's lead by sending
her own sacrifice fly out to center
scoring Mendoza and making the
score 2-0.
The Cardinal would continue
to rally as junior leftfielder Cassie
Brangham roped a single to left
field and drove in Beeson to push
the third run across the plate.
Southern would then retire the
side, but not for good as Stanford
came back in the sixth to tack on
two runs and make the score 5-0.
Nyberg would continue to

dominate the game, allowing no
runs and scattering just four hits
for her 18th victory of the season.
LeCocq then took over the cir
cle for the Cardinal in the second
game of the evening and proceed
ed to dominate and shutout the
Bulldogs in a 1-0 Stanford victory.
The Cardinal scored its only
run in the third when Mendoza
roped a double, scoring Walker,
who reached base on a single
through the infield.
Stanford will look to recap
ture the explosive offense of
the first game of the series and
the dominant pitching perfor
mances of both matchups this
weekend in its contests against
the Oregon schools.
