## 
### KIMBERLY ROBERTS STAFF WRITER 
The USC. women's water polo team handed
the Cardinal its first loss of the season with a
goal in the final minutes of their match on
March 30.
Stanford had opened its 2002 campaign
with a 13-match winning streak that included
three wins over the defending national cham
pion UCLA Bruins and a victory over the Tro
jans earlier in the year.

WOMEN'S WATER POLO
Friday: No. 1 Stanford vs. San Diego St.,
7:00 p.m., Avery Aquatics Center
Sunday: No. 1 Stanford vs. Long Beach
St., 10:00 a.m., Avery Aquatics Center
Sunday: No. 1 Stanford vs. UC-lrvine,
2:00 p.m., Avery Aquatics Center

However, in Los Angeles this past week
end, USC edged out the victory, 7-6, to
take sole possession of first place in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation ahead
of Stanford (13-1, 5-1 MPSF) and UCLA,
who have one loss apiece.
"USC was very fired up for this match,"
said junior Jackie Frank. "They've been ex
cited to play us again since we beat them
earlier this year. An undefeated team is al
ways a target for everyone else and we
came out flat. We were behind the whole
game and were never able to come back
after we fell behind."
The Trojans jumped out to an early 3-1
lead. But before the Cardinal responded in
the second period with two goals by sopho
more Brenda Villa and one by senior
Margie Dingeldein to send the game into
halftime deadlocked at 4-4.
USC again took the lead after the break,
scoring two goals to go up 6-4. Stanford earned
the two goals back to tie the game at 6-6 with
only 1:15 left in the game. The Trojans re
sponded, however, scoring the winning goal
with only 1:03 on the clock.
"USC's winning goal was a great shot on a
six-on-five situation," Frank said. "We had a lot
of opportunities in the game that we didn't con
vert, especially our six-on-five advantages."

Prior to the USC match, the Cardinal
had been very successful over the spring
break, defeating both Northridge and Pa
cific by scores of 15-1.
On March 29 against the Matadors (3-
13, 0-8 MPSF), the Cardinal scored six
goals in the first period en route to its 13th
victory of the season.
Stanford did not let up, scoring another
three goals in the second period to have a nine
-goal lead at halftime. Villa had three goals in
the opening half while junior Ellen Lstes and
freshman Hanna Luber had one apiece.
One half and six Stanford goals later,
both Villa and sophomore Wendy Watkins
had scored hat tricks in the game, while
two others had two goals.
Less than a week earlier, on March 23,
Stanford recorded its first win of the break
with a 15-1 win over Pacific (3-8, 1-5 MPSF).
Stanford went on a rampage in the first
half, scoring 13 goals after only two peri
ods. The win included hat tricks by both

Watkins and Villa while Estes and junior
Julie Gardner both had two goals.
The team's loss to USC makes this week
end's action crucial for the Cardinal. It will
not only influence the team's standing en
tering the MPSF tournament. Also the
team has to keep as good a record as possi
ble in order to receive the automatic at
large bid to the NCAA tournament.
This weekend, the Cardinal will play
three of these crucial MPSF matches
against San Diego State, Long Beach State
and UC-Irvine. All three games will be at
Stanford at 7 p.m. on Friday and Stanford
will play a double-header on Sunday at 10
a.m. and 2 p.m.
"I hope we are able to learn from this
loss to USC," Frank said. "We play three
MPSF games this weekend and they're all
really important. Long Beach State is a
very good team and we need to make sure
not to let up against anyone in order to stay
in position to get the automatic bid."
