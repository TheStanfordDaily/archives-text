# Dean criticizes campaign reform act
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Law School Dean Kathleen M. Sulli
van has joined the legal team of U.S.
Senator Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to
challenge the constitutionality of the Bi
partisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002,
a bill signed by President George W.
Bush late last month that prohibits un
limited donations to national political
parties and charges the nation's system
of campaign finance.
Sullivan accepted McConnell's invi
tation on March 21, t he day after the bill
passed the Senate. McConnell filed his
official complaint on March 27, the
same day Bush signed the act into law.
"I've been writing about this issue for
five years, so this is a major issue of my
scholarship," Sullivan said. "I feel very
committed to these principles. 1 think
lawyers have an obligation of public ser
vice and 1 thought this was a place 1
could meaningfully contribute to."
Sullivan joins five other prominent
American legal experts, including Ken
neth Starr, the independent counsel for
the Whitewater case; and Floyd Abrams,
who defended The New York Times in
the Pentagon Papers case.
"To wage this fight for freedom in

the courts, 1 have brought together the
strongest team of skilled, successful and
experienced constitutional lawyers in
America," McConnell said in a March 21
statement. "Hailing from the East
Coast, West Coast and in between, this
team's noted ideological and political
diversity is transcended by their shared
commitment as Americans to defend
the Constitution."
McConnell described Sullivan as
"one of the foremost experts on the First
Amendment," citing books and articles
she has written.
"I think it's fair to say that most of us
at the podium today learned much of
what we know about the First Amend
ment from the eloquent and incisive
writing of Dean Sullivan," he said.
Stanford Law Prof. Thomas Camp
bell, who principally studies the eco
nomic analysis of legal issues and an
titrust matters, said that Sullivan's pre
eminence in First Amendment law
made her an obvious choice for Mc-
Connell's litigation.
"She's among the very, very few any
one would name as the top Constitu
tional scholars in the world, and you
can't get any better than that," he said.
Sullivan said she has previously testi
fied before the Senate on campaign ft

nance issues and has been writing jour
nal articles and op-ed pieces since 1997.
Regarding the current legislation,
Sullivan argued that it drives money
out of the hands of actual candidates
and into secondary bodies like political
parties or even tertiary organizations
like public interest groups. Additional
ly, she argues that it poses First Amend
ment questions since its effect is to limit
free speech.
"It's bad public policy, it's horrible
constitutional law," she said.
Sullivan said she believed in some
kinds of campaign finance reform, such
as public finance and rapid disclosure.
However, she elaborated on her rea
sons for opposing this legislation in a
letter to McConnell.
"[T]here can be no doubt that re
strictions on political money are re
strictions on political speech," she
wrote. "A law barring newspapers from
accepting paid political advertise
ments, or limiting the sale price of po
litical books, would likewise limit only
the exchange of money. Yet 110 one
would question that such laws inhibit
political speech â€” as do restrictions on
campaign funding."
Some see Sullivan's decision to
join forces with conservative Mc-
Connell as strange, as she does
not align with the senator on
many political issues such as
health care. However, the two do
agree on some matters.
"I think McConnell is very de
voted to free speech and I'm with
him on those causes," she said.
Sullivan said she received ap
proximately 40 letters from
alumni asking about her deci
sion, to which she responded by
explaining that Constitutional is
sues sometimes take precedence
over partisan concerns.
"It is not fun to be at odds
with so many of my usual politi
cal allies, but I believe that this
legislation is plainly unconstitu
tional," she wrote in a letter to
alumni. "1 teach my students
that law and politics are not the
same thing; that integrity means
calling constitutional cases as
you see them based on the issues
and not their popularity."
Sullivan said that she sees her
role within the McConnell legal
team as to provide scholarship
and a connection to the Universi
ty. She said that Stanford and
UC-Berkeley professors might be
called upon in the process of con
structing the team's case.
"This is the kind of thing
where I can contribute intellec

tually," Sullivan said. "The im
portant tiling about the Consti
tution is that it doesn't belong to
any party."
Sullivan emphasized that, in
choosing her work outside of
Stanford, she focuses on pro
bono work and tries to select ini
tiatives that serve as good role
models for students.
"Not everybody is going to
agree with your choice of public
service," she said. "I really do
think this fits that criteria."
Sullivan said that she does not
see her involvement in the case as
a conflict of interest with her role
as dean of the Law School and
that she has received many letters
of support from alumni. In the
letter to alumni, Sullivan ex
plained that her involvement was
personal, not representative of
the Law School, and that she does
not use the Law School's name in
any of her pleadings.
Some Law School professors
refused to comment on Sullivan's
decision to participate in the legal
action.
Campbell said that, despite
political differences, he support
ed her choice to become involved
in the complaint.
"She's representing a point of
view with which I personally dis
agree, but I think she's very clear
it's personal," he said. "I can only
speak for myself, but I do not think
it is inappropriate at all. She's not
claiming to speak for Stanford or
for Stanford Law, so she's com
pletely within her rights."
