## 
### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford junior swingman Casey Jacob
sen has come to the decision that many Car
dinal fans dreaded but anticipated nonethe
less. Jacobsen announced late Tuesday
night that he will declare eligibility for the
NBA draft but will not sign with an agent.
Jacobsen will still have the option of with
drawing from the draft by June 19 and re
turning to Stanford next year. It has been
projected that he will be drafted late in the
first round.
"I have nothing to lose and everything to
gain by 'testing the waters' this spring," Ja
cobsen said. "If I have any doubts of
whether or not it is time to move on, those
doubts will be answered shortly.
"This is a win-win situation. If I feel like
I'm not ready for the NBA, I will get an
amazing opportunity to finish my Stanford
career the old-fashioned way. Either way,
the next year of my life is going to be a lot
of fun."
A first-team All-American as a sopho
more, Jacobsen averaged a team-high 21.9
points, 35.3 minutes and 3.5 assists this sea
son to garner second team All-American
status. He ranks third on the all-time Stan
ford career scoring list with 1,723 points,
behind Todd Lichti (2,336) and Adam
Keefe (2,319).
If Jacobsen does leave, *he will be the
first Stanford men's basketball player to
leave before graduation. Last year, center
Jason Collins completed his academic pro
gram even though he still had athletic eli
gibility remaining.
Still, Jacobsen said that he has promised
head coach Mike Montgomery and his par
ents that regardless of what happens, he will
eventually graduate.
"That has always been a goal of mine,
much longer than being an NBA player
has," said Jacobsen, who is majoring in com
munication. "Coach Montgomery and the
Athletic Department, have been very sup
portive in my decision."
Montgomery was still on vacation yester
day and was unavailable for comment.
Jacobsen's decision will be similar to that

of Collins, who declared for the draft after
last season but did not hire an agent. Collins
was a first-round draft pick by the New Jer
sey Nets.
"I don't want to regret not giving it a de
cent shot," added Jacobsen, who is possibly
the biggest recruit in Stanford basketball
history. "I feel like I've worked too hard to
let an opportunity like this go by. I at least
need to try it and see what happens.
"I just hope that Stanford, the Bay Area
community, and college basketball fans will
support me in this very difficult decision."
Junior center Curtis Borchardt has yet to
make a statement regarding his future but it
is expected that he will also take advantage
of the "test the waters" policy by declaring
for the draft without hiring an agent. The
deadline to declare for the draft is May 12
and the NBA draft is June 26.
