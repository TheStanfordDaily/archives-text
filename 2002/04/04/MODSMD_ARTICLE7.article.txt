# Corner Pocket fully revamped
## 
### JOHN HUETTER EDITORIAL STAFF 
Hie Corner Pocket recently re
ceived a major overhaul to bring it
in line with its neighbors, the Coffee
House and the Treehouse, which
also underwent recent changes to
their menu and atmosphere.
On Wednesday, the Corner
Pocket officially debuted its newly
expanded hours, decor and menu.
The Coffee House will begin offer
ing sushi from Miyake tomorrow at
cheaper prices than the actual
restaurant. For its part, the Tree
house has already launched a twice
weekly program of live music and a
half-priced menu.
"This is a huge revamp," said
ASSU Undergraduate Senate
Deputy Chair Mike Osofsky, who
spearheaded the recent menu, at
mospheric and schedule changes.
He worked with Bon Appetit admin

istrators, Treehouse owner Ray
Klein, Dean of Students Marc Wais
and Director of Meeting Services
Jeanette Sinith-I^aws.
"This is my pet project," Osofsky
said. "I'm a chef— I love doing
things with food."
The largest changes occurred at
the Corner Pocket, which will now

be open from noon to midnight
four days a week and will offer Ben
8c Jerry's ice cream, Noah's Bagels
and pearl milk tea. Lee Roy Fitch, di
rector of retail for Bon Appetit,
spent Wednesday bustling about
Tresidder preparing for the


AARON STAPLE/The Stanford Daily
changes.
"I'm getting everything going
right now ... looking forward to it,"
Fitch said.
"It's sort of a step past Stan
ford After Midnight," Osofsky
said, explaining that when the
Corner Pocket expanded its
hours to midnight before, it
never did well Financially.
Osofsky said that by offering
new menu options, the previously
"immensely outdated" eatery
would succeed as a late-night
Tresidder attraction.
"Tresidder is a very space-limited
place," he said. "Revamping the
food is a no-brainer."
A total remodeling of the down
stairs part of Tresidder would not
occur for at least a year. "We want to

do something now," he said.
I lie (x>rner Pocket, despite of ler
ing items like pizza at cheaper prices
than the Coffee House, would not
detract from the Coffee House's
sales, he said, noting that since Bon
Appetit owns lx>th places, this pre
sumably was not a concern anyway.
"We're competing with our
selves," Fitch said, laughing. "It's
fun."
In addition, Osofsky noted that
both eateries attract different
crowds. Fhe Corner Pocket would
target those desiring to grab a snack
or talk and study in a quieter at
mosphere.
Fhe new menu would help soft
en the atmosphere and attract
more people to what he called the
"institutionalized" Tresidder
downstairs.
Meanwhile, the Treehouse has
gained a new regular of sorts in mu
sician Mauricio Bertin, who will per
form for patrons alike on Tuesdays

and Wednesdays.
Beitin, who plays "everything
from salsa to the Rolling Stones," has
already performed twice at the
Treehouse, once last week and once
Tuesday night.
Ray Klein, Treehouse owner, dis
covered Beitin at a San Francisco gig
and offered the musician a place at
Stanford.
"A lot of kids came over just
for the music," said Treehouse
night manager Rafael (Fernan
do) Rodriguez, who called it a
"good initiation" for the recent
ly-renewed Treehouse.
Bertin hoped to "make this place
real noisy," he said, calling the at
mosphere "cool."
"I miss that," he said. "I play
too much in ballrooms — 1 miss
the bohemian."
He claimed to enjoy Tuesday's
crowd. "All the guys here are very
respectful — they are fun, they are
respectful." During his set, diners

(whom he likened to a "brewery")
were drinking and singing along,
he said.
"They go to class the next day?"
Bertin marveled.
"It was cool they had entertain
ment here," said junior Crystal
Maglio, who listened to Bertin
while drinking with friends Tues
day night. "It was nice to have that
atmosphere here ... he was real
ly good."
Senior John West noted that the
new music didn't overpower the
Treehouse's diners. "You can
choose to get into it or not," he said.
Junior Sheela Subramanian
called Bertin's music a "good addi
tion to the dynamic of the Tree
house," but said that while she
didn't want to "run him out of busi
ness," she would rather have alter
nating bands.
"It was nice to have live music,"
said senior John Eddy. "It's really
nice to have die energy."

Tuesday night.
Ray Klein, Treehouse owner, dis
covered Beitin at a San Francisco gig
and offered the musician a place at
Stanford.
"A lot of kids came over just
for the music," said Treehouse
night manager Rafael (Fernan
do) Rodriguez, who called it a
"good initiation" for the recent
ly-renewed Treehouse.
Bertin hoped to "make this place
real noisy," he said, calling the at
mosphere "cool."
"I miss that," he said. "I play
too much in ballrooms — 1 miss
the bohemian."
He claimed to enjoy Tuesday's
crowd. "All the guys here are very
respectful — they are fun, they are
respectful." During his set, diners

(whom he likened to a "brewery")
were drinking and singing along,
he said.
"They go to class the next day?"
Bertin marveled.
"It was cool they had entertain
ment here," said junior Crystal
Maglio, who listened to Bertin
while drinking with friends Tues
day night. "It was nice to have that
atmosphere here ... he was real
ly good."
Senior John West noted that the
new music didn't overpower the
Treehouse's diners. "You can
choose to get into it or not," he said.
Junior Sheela Subramanian
called Bertin's music a "good addi
tion to the dynamic of the Tree
house," but said that while she
didn't want to "run him out of busi
ness," she would rather have alter
nating bands.
"It was nice to have live music,"
said senior John Eddy. "It's really
nice to have die energy."
