The I)ean of Students Office
announced it will be accepting
nominations from students, fac
ulty and staff for the James W.
Lyons Award and the Dean of
Students Outstanding Achieve
ment Award until Friday.
The Lyons Award recognizes
the service contributions of stu

side community, according to
Nanci Howe, assistant dean of
students. Students cannot nomi

The award was named after
James Lyons, a former dean of
students. Assoc. Dean of Stu

that Lyons is extremely well-re
spected nationwide for his con
tributions to student affairs.
The Dean's Achievement
Award honors "singular contri

enriched the quality of student
life on campus," Howe said. In
contrast, students are encour

are involved in for unique
achievement over the past year.
A selection committee com

student affairs has been assem

11 is chaired by James Jordan, as

sistant director of the Black
Community Service Center.
"One of the most important
qualities that the selection com

at Stanford and in the larger
community," Graves said.
Ten winners will be accepted
for each award.
