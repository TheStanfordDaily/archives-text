Summer 2002
Archaeological Research Opportunity,
In the USA
The Department of Anthropological Sciences is pleased to offer a special
opportunity for student conservation research this summer:
Greater Yellowstone Archaeology (GYA) Internships
in Montana and Wyoming, June to August 2002
Two 8-10 week internships are available for Stanford students (undergrad or grad) interested in working on a
team attempting to locate and investigate Paleoindian and prehistoric Native American sites near Yellowstone Park
in the Madison Valley area of Montana. High sensitivity to Native American rights and culture is essential. It is
anticipated that the study of high plains hunter and gatherer lifeways can help inform modern social and envi
ronmental issues including; wildlife migration and management (including wolf, grizzly bear, elk, antelope, and
moose), habitat fragmentation, subdivision and commercial development, land management, invasion of noxious
weeds and introduced fish species.
Internship awards cover living expenses, research costs, round trip travel to internship site, and summer earnings off
set up to a maximum of $3000. Interested students should coordinate their ideas and place with a GYE conservation
organization before the application deadline.
For further information or clarification, please contact Mary Cahill, Student Services Coordinator, Anthropological
Sciences, Building 360, Room 361F (mcahill@stanford), 736-0734) or Prof. John Rick, B-360
