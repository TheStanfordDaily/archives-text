1951
On April 5, 1951, The Daily printed an article about
ASSU elections.
"Excom last night discussed and then sent to com
mittee a suggestion that winter quarter elections be
eliminated in an attempt to arouse student interest in
the remaining spring and fall elections.
"In other business, the Executive committee hashed
over the Rome fiasco and also appointed Dick YVeis
mann and Phil Saeta as co-chairmen of the Foreign
Scholarship Committee for next year.
"George Denny cited the 1-i percent turn-out of vot
ers at the polls last quarter as illustrating the lack of in
terest on the part of candidates, students, and the Elec
tion Board in fall and winter quarter elections. He be
lieved the students were tired of having a vote three
times a year.
"At present, candidates for Men's and Women's
Councils vie in the winter election, along with any can
didates for positions vacated since the previous election.
Under Denny's proposal, two posts for each council
would be filled in the fall and three in the spring.
"Sue Dekker, Union Unit representative, inquired as
to the possibility of improving the present system by
looking into the election and campaign procedures.
"ASSU President Ted Buttner sent the problem to
the Constitution Committee under Carol Penney,
Woman's Row representative, to consider all the aspects
and report back to Excom next week. A change in the
number of elections would require a vote of the student
body to amend the ASSU Constitution."
Bottom Line: The ASSU has been aware of problems with student
interest fora while, but getting rid of winter elections doesn't
seem to have helped.
