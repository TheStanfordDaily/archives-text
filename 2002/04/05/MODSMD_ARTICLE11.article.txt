# Winner declared in Assassins
## Campus-wide event attracts 35 competitors armed with water guns 
### ERIN ARCHERD STAFF WRITER 
Last quarter, 35 brave sharp
shooters armed with water guns
battled in the first campus-wide
game of Assassins, sponsored by
the ASSU Student Life Committee.
Sophomore Chris Wallis
emerged as the winner.
"It's pretty sweet, I guess," Wal
lis said, who lives in Kucalipto.
The top finishers after Wallis
were freshman Joe Fairbanks from
Freshman-Sophomore (College,
and.freshman Albert Hsu from
(iranada.
Representing 19 dormitories
across Stanford, the assassins had
96 hours to hit each targets or be
terminated from the game. Play
ers were given the name, resi
dence and a photo of each of
their targets.
After the first round, 1 1 players
were terminated, and 14 had al
ready been assassinated.
Junior Eric Lai, the ASSU Sena
tor responsible for organizing the
event, tbund that participation in
the game defied people's expecta
tions.
"Many people had expected
there to be more terminations
than assassinations, so at that point
I was already pleased with the way
things were progressing," he said.
Lai's best advice for 112 uture play
ers was to stay away from your res
idence dining halls.
"You're going to end up vul
nerable while you're eating or
picking up food," he pointed out.
Wallis, who stopped going to
dining halls during the game, also
commented on their danger.
"It was really easy to kill people
once you finally found them,
thanks to a rule that a kill counts if
the gun is hidden," he said. "So we

had people sitting down in dining
halls and getting shot in plain view
of everybody by somebody with
binder paper wrapped around
their water guns."
But eating in other dining halls
during the game may have some
perks.
"Your assassin probably won't
be able to find yon during meals,
and you also get a chance to meet
some new peopleâ€”so it's a double
benefit," Lai explained.
Wallis found that the game did
keep him from attending class
regularly.
"There was certainly a huge
chunk of time ripped from the
hands of studying in class in the
name of not being tracked down,"
he said. "If I was fairly sure that I
would be traced to a certain class, I
didn't go."
Wallis suggested forming a
"goon squad" of people you trust
during the game and using the
window often.
"And for the love of everything
that is good and pure, don't accept
invitations to meet with people
who you aren't really that good of
friends with who call you up rail

domly," he added.
Fairbanks involved his friends
in the game.
"I had two full-time body
guards and two others who
worked to find out information
about my target," he said. "It was
kind of frightening seeing how
much we could find out about a
person on the Internet."
Fairbanks was Wallis' assassin,
but discovered his own assassin
lived in the same dorm as Wallis.
"My target and my assassin
were not less than 100 feet away
from each other at the same time,"
he said. "Also, their dorm had
some kind of secret code to alert all
Ihe residents that 1 was there with
my group of people."
Some players felt that the game
was too difficult, but Lai said be be
lieved the game went smoothly,
given the logistical difficulties of a
ci oss campus event.
"1 definitely agree that a game
of this scope presents some unique
challenges, but judging from the
number of players who were able
to successful assassinate their tar-

gets, 1 don't think those challenges
were insurmountable," he said.
Wallis thought the game was
well organized, but found it very
different from intra-dormitory
Assassins.
"It had quite a different feel

than dorm assassins, more of a
finding game than one where the
main challenge is to catch your vic
tim alone," said Wallis.
If Campus-wide Assassins takes
place again, Lai said he wants
greater participation
"At a school with thousands of
students, 1 know there must be
more than 35 people paranoid
enough to enjoy a campus-wide
version of Assassins," he said.
