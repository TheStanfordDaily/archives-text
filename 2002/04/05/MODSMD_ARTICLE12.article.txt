# Hate mail targets El Centro
## 
### SARAH SCHULMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last month, a student slat!'member at El Centro
Chicano received a letter that claimed to contain
anthrax and expressed anti-Latino profanities.
1 he FBI has since investigated the contents and
determined that the letter does not contain anthrax,
li had been specifically addressed to LI Centro.
"The hate mail was postmarked in Oakland on
March 8 and had no return address," said LI Cen
tro Director Frances Morales. "The letter was
opened by a student stall member who was ap
palled by the derogatory and hate-filled content ol
the letter."
l'he name ol the student who opened the letter
was not released because of safety concerns.
Freshman (iaspar Rivera, another LI (Centro stu
dent staff member, read the letter at a staff meeting
earlier this week. I le said he was shocked by iis ex
plicit nature.
"I was so surprised that someone would send
a letter to the plate I worked," he said. "You
hear about this happening to other people, but
it hit so dose to me. l'he letter was just so racist
and really scary."
Dean of Students Mart Wais immediately re
sponded to the incident by sending out a notice to
Stanford faculty.
"An FBI spokesperson said the powder appears
to be benign but was clearly intended to stare the

recipients," Wais said. "Staff in I I Centro did not
observe any visible traces of white powder."
El Centro was not the only target of the threat
ening hate mail.
More than 50 Latino attorneys and communi
ty groups in the Bay Area, Sacramento and
Washington, I).( 1., have received such letters. At
torney Ceneral John Ashcroft and Gov. Gray
Davis have promised to pursue a thorough in
vestigation.
I wo other incidents involving hate threats took
place in the last week.
On Monday, a student reported that he received
an offensive e-mail directed ai (lliicanos.
"We are following up with students and we have
notified the computer security office," said Wais in
a written statement.
I lie next day, another student reported that 14
out of 15 posters advertising an event sponsored by
the GLBT Medical Student Group had been torn
down and shredded.
After Sept. 1 1 and the subsequent anthrax
scares, hate crimes against ethnic groups increased,
said Wais. Yet most of the hate mail was directed at
Muslims. Wais said he believes the recent messages
directed against Latinos cannot be traced to a spe
cific event in the news.
" I he letters directed against Latinos cannot be
explained as easily as the post-Sept. 11 attacks
against Arabs and Muslim stu
dents," Wais said.
As a result of these incidents,
the University has established a
set of rules against hate mail
called the Student Affairs Proto
col to Address Acts of Intoler
ance. A Web site is also being de

veloped to allow students and
community members to report
and respond to hate-motivated
incidents.
"We hope this site will provide
the community with an educa
tional resource to mobilize all the
good will that exists on campus to
minimize acts of intolerance,"
Wais said.
