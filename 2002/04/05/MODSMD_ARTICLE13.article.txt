WASHINGTON (AP) â€”Under pressure to curb
Middle East violence, President Bush urged Israel
on yesterday to pull its troops back lrom Palestinian
cities and dismissed Palestinian leader N asser Aralat
as a failed leader who "betrayed the hopes of his
people." I Ie ordered Secretary of State Colin Pow
ell to the region next week seeking a cease-fire.
With Powell standing at his side in the Rose
Garden, Bush pressed Arab leaders to do more to
end terrorism and emulate the peacemaking tra
ditions begun by the late President Anwar Sadat o!
Egypt and King Hussein of Jordan and carried
forward by their successors, Hosni Mubarak and
King Abdullah.
"As Israel steps back, responsible Palestinian
leaders and Israel's Arab neighbors must step for
ward and show the world that they are truly on the
side of peace," Hush said. "The choice and the bur
den will be theirs."
As Bush spoke, Mubarak urged the administra

tion to "exert its maximum effort" to secure an Is
raeli withdrawal. In an address to his nation,
Mubarak said Israel's military campaign will cre
ate hatred among 300 million Arabs.
1 he Mideast crisis was sure to dominate Bush's
weekend meeting with British Prime Minister
Tony Blair at the president's ranch near Craw
ford, Texas.
Nie Israel-Palestinian bloodshed has put Bush
under enormous political and diplomatic pressure
to do something to stem the violence. He sought
yesterday to spread blame and issue challenges
evenly between the parties.
Aralat and his Cabinet issued a statement today
unconditionally accepting the renewed U.S. effort,
but Cabinet minister Saeb Erekat rejected Bush's
criticism of Arafat as "unjustified and unacceptable."
