# Bush urges Israeli troops to leave

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€”Under pressure to curb
Middle East violence, President Bush urged Israel
on yesterday to pull its troops back lrom Palestinian
cities and dismissed Palestinian leader N asser Aralat
as a failed leader who "betrayed the hopes of his
people." I Ie ordered Secretary of State Colin Pow
ell to the region next week seeking a cease-fire.
With Powell standing at his side in the Rose
Garden, Bush pressed Arab leaders to do more to
end terrorism and emulate the peacemaking tra
ditions begun by the late President Anwar Sadat o!
Egypt and King Hussein of Jordan and carried
forward by their successors, Hosni Mubarak and
King Abdullah.
"As Israel steps back, responsible Palestinian
leaders and Israel's Arab neighbors must step for
ward and show the world that they are truly on the
side of peace," Hush said. "The choice and the bur
den will be theirs."
As Bush spoke, Mubarak urged the administra

tion to "exert its maximum effort" to secure an Is
raeli withdrawal. In an address to his nation,
Mubarak said Israel's military campaign will cre
ate hatred among 300 million Arabs.
1 he Mideast crisis was sure to dominate Bush's
weekend meeting with British Prime Minister
Tony Blair at the president's ranch near Craw
ford, Texas.
Nie Israel-Palestinian bloodshed has put Bush
under enormous political and diplomatic pressure
to do something to stem the violence. He sought
yesterday to spread blame and issue challenges
evenly between the parties.
Aralat and his Cabinet issued a statement today
unconditionally accepting the renewed U.S. effort,
but Cabinet minister Saeb Erekat rejected Bush's
criticism of Arafat as "unjustified and unacceptable."
While invoking a "right to defend ourselves"
against "this aggression against
our people, against our towns,
our refugee camps,"the Cabinet
statement said: "From our side,
we are committed without condi
tions to the declaration of Presi
dent Bush."
Powell called Arafat and dis
cussed Bush's proposals, said
Arafat aide Nabil Abu Rdeneh.
1 le said Arafat accepted the pro
posals.
Israel's Foreign Ministry wel
comed Powell's visit and promised
"to do everything so that his mis
sion will be successful." Defense
Minister Binyamin Ben-Flie/er is
sued a separate statement offering
cooperation in ending the vio
lence but adding, "In the absence
of a true willingness to do the
same on the Palestinian side, Is
rael will continue in its actions to
stop terror."
There was no immediate reac
tion from Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon, although Sharon
agreed to permit a U.S. envoy to
meet with the besieged Arafat.
The li.N. Security Council
unanimously endorsed Powell's

Mideast mission and demanded
an Israeli withdrawal from Pales
tinian cities "without delay."
Officials said Bush purposely
did not mention a timetable for
Israel's withdrawal or for an end
to settlements, which Israel had
conditionally agreed to as part of
the derailed peace process.
Powell's mission could expose
Bush to the risk of failure, but
U.S. officials suggested they had
reason to believe Israel would not
snub his request to pull back.
Bush aides said that optimism was
based, in part, on Israeli state
ments that the military offensives
were temporary and on conversa
tions between U.S. and Israeli of
ficials before Bush's speech.
Bush urged Arab leaders to
curb terrorism, disrupt terrorist
financing and "stop inciting vio
lence by glorifying terror in
state-owned media or telling sui
cide bombers they are martyrs."
By turning to Arab countries
for help, Bush was tacitly acknowl
edging that Arafat had failed to
stop terrorism and was unlikely to
succeed alone, senior officials said.
There were other signs that Bush
was casting about for an alterna
tive to Arafat, such as Powell's
plans to talk to other Palestinian
leaders during his trip.
