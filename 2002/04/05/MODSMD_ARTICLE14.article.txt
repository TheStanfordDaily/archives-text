## The 						Stanford Daily U.S. should strengthen efforts in Middle East 
### 
Published Since 1891

The recent escalating violence in the
Middle East is obviously a cause of
concern for the whole world. In the
current world climate, achieving a
just and lasting peace between Israelis and
Palestinians is especially important for the
United States.
Because of its current war on terrorism,
the United States needs support from the
Arab and international communities, many
of whom have viewed the United States as a
biased mediator of the conflict.
If the United States wants to begin military
operations against Iraq, as many experts
have speculated, it will undoubtedly need the
support of its Arab allies. That support will

unlikely be garnered unless the United States
makes a strong push to reach a settlement be
tween the Palestinians and the Israelis.
Because of the importance of the conflict,
the United States should play a larger role at
stopping the violence. President George W.
Bush's comments yesterday asking Israel to
halt its "incursions into Palestinian-con
trolled areas and begin the withdrawal from
those cities it has recently occupied," as well
as calling on Palestinian Authority Chairman
Yasser Arafat to "do everything in [his] power
to stop terrorist activities" against Israel were
steps in the right direction.
It is also encouraging that the president
decided to send Secretary of State Colin Pow

ell to the region. Such high-level interven
tion is essential to bring about an end to the
cycle of violence and the mutual hatred it
generates.
These actions are also a welcome response
to the increasing international scrutiny of the
U.S. position in recent days, when the U.S.
refused to criticize the Israeli attacks. For ex
ample, yesterday the U.N. Security Council
voted 15-0 to demand Israel pullout from
Palestinian towns "without delay."
President Bush's constructive state
ments must now be followed by concrete
and sustained diplomatic action. As Israel's
closest friend and ally, the United States
has the ability to influence Israel more

than any other country in the world. The
United States currently gives Israel around
$2 billion in military aid each year. If Israel,
does not comply with U.S. requests, the
United States should not be afraid to halt
or cut back this assistance.
All countries should also assist in the effort
to achieve peace in the Middle East. Sending
a U.N. peacekeeping force to the region
would demonstrate a global concern for the
conflict and could reduce the tension and vi
olence in the region.
Unless both the United States and other in
ternational powers make stronger efforts to
resolve the situation, the violence will unfor
tunately continue.
