Barry Bonds hit 73 home runs last
season, shattering the single sea
son mark set in 1998 by Mark
McGwire. Tuesday, opening day
for the Giants, Bonds hit two more. And
Wednesday, he hit two more. Writing this
Thursday morning, 1 don't know how
many homers he is going to hit in tonight's
final game of this Giants-Dodgers series,
but I wouldn't be surprised to see a couple
more. Bonds is widely acknowledged to be
the greatest player in the game today and
has been called by many one of the great
est players ever.
Michael Jordan is without a doubt the
greatest basketball player ever. More specif l
ically, he was the greatest player ever. Still,

it's a privilege to watch
him play and it was sad to
see his season end with
one of his worst games
ever due to a knee injury.
Bonds is hill i n g
homers left and right.
Tuesday, he hit one off a
left-handed pitcher to
right field and one off a
right-handed pitcher to

left field. Wednesday, his homers were off
two other Dodger pitchers. After the sec
ond game of the season, lie was on pace to
hit 324 home runs (really). "Pretty soon,"
said Giants Manager Dusty Baker, "he'll
be able to levitate."
Jordan used to be able to levitate, but
he had a hard time this season, finishing
with the second-lowest scoring average of
his career. But even after his long "retire
ment" layoff and even with his injuries, he
was able to lead one of the most woeful
teams of last season, the Washington Wiz
ards, to being a contender for the playoffs
(they still have a chance of getting in). 1 fe
made some more game winning shots
and gave the world reminders of his Air
ness's championship glory.
Why bother paying attention to
wealthy athletes like Bonds and Jordan,
you ask? There's war in the Middle East,
terrorism is still a threat, and people are
starving across the world. Why give any
heed at all to the sportsmen's feats?
Because — besides giving being a
common conversation topic and a fasci
nating story — it gives us a chance to see
people who are the best at what they do
do their best. It's like being able to see
Mozart compose or Ramanujam calcu
late or Desmond Tutu preach or Ein
stein think. It shows us the height of
human achievement in a given sphere,
and just how much man can do.
You probably don't know who Tyler

Yoshiyama is. But if I told you that Tyler
— an eighth-grader who has won two
straight Big Island Spelling Bee champi
onships— is "the Michael Jordan of
Hawaii spelling," you'd understand my
point. That is how great Jordan is. He is
a part of our language: his name denotes
superiority and excellence in the clutch.
Watching great athletes like Barry
Bonds and Michael Jordan offers an es
cape. Instead of constantly witnessing
man destroying fellow man or man self
destructing, we get a chance to see man
fulfill his maximum potential in a skill,
make maximum use of a gift instead of
squander it. While we may not be able to
hit home runs or slash to the hoop past
seven-footers, we can take away that
much from remarkable players.
We have Bonds and Jordans here at
Stanford in several areas. Leaving aside
the professors, many of whom could cer
tainly be called the Jordans of their re
spective fields, many of the students are,
or in a few years will be, the best at what
they do. They sometimes make it hard
for the rest of us in terms of grades
(they're my excuse anyway) and prob
lem-set difficulty, but it will be nice to say
that I studied with that Nobel Prize win
ner or played ball with that Olympic gold
medalist or lent a dollar to that richest ty
coon in the world.
There's always the hope that some of
the skill and success might somehow
have rubbed off on me. Actually, the real
hope is that others may think that it
rubbed off, just like teams apparently
thought when they gave Michael Jor
dan's teammates on his Bulls teams
huge, undeserved contracts or like TV
executives thought when they gave
shows to Seinfeld's secondary stars.
Virtually every culture has numerous
tales about the greatest warrior, greatest
prophet, greatest ruler and greatest artist.
I he stories are timeless, because they
serve as inspirations of what can be. Bonds
and Jordan are characters in our modern
tales. Their field of competition may not
be the most consequential, but the great
ness part of the allure is the same.
Jordan in all likelihood has just one
year left to play and Bonds, while in his
prime, does not have more than a few.
They may not be "heroes," but they
certainly do provide examples of the
highest excellence. And we are lucky to
be able to watch them play.
