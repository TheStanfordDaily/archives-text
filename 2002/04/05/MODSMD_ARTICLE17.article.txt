Hawaiian column misleading
In response to Corinne Purtill's Apr. 3
column, I would like to make some points
about her description of "paradise" in
Waikiki, Hawai'i. Images of Hawai'i,
which are represented in her article, inac
curately romanticize the islands as a per
fect paradise with people "sprawled in the
sand," "swaying palm trees," "sparkling
turquoise waves," "tropical sun" and
"fruity beverages with little umbrellas in
the glass."
Don't get me wrong: the islands are
beautiful place; after all, I, too, was in
I lawai'i over the break. But the typical im
ages of the islands mask t he real beauty of
the islands.
My experience was incredibly different.
As one of the trip leaders of the Alternative
Spring Break trip, "Beyond Paradise:
Contemporary Native Hawaiian Issues",
I'd like to say that while there may have
been Stanford students everywhere "on
mopeds", "gyrating at clubs", and "jump
ing out of planes", there were also 14 other
Stanford students on O'alni exploring
and learning about the island through a
different lens.
I'm not saying my experience was bet
ter, as people have different expectations
for the time in I lawai'i, but I do think it is
important to acknowledge that the article
is not representative of all Stanford student
experiences. Most importantly, the islands
are home to many Stanford students.
Beyond these Utopian images of a par
adise in Hawai'i lies a beautiful and rich
culture, both local and Hawaiian, that vis
itors neglect to explore and appreciate. I
would strongly hesitate to describe sailors
as a component of "local culture" as was
noted later in the article. Local culture re
flects the mixture of all the different ethnic
groups that moved to the islands when

plantations became a profitable business
in the past few centuries; a few groups in
clude the Japanese, Chinese, Okinawans,
Filipinos and Portuguese. Sailors, rather
than being a part of "local culture," repre
sent the seizing of sovereignty of Native
Hawaiians by the United States in 1898.
I'here is also a Native Hawaiian cul
ture that fails to be recognized and ap
preciated; many mainland visitors fail to
even realize the existence of the Native
Hawaiians, who, like many ethnic
groups, were socially, culturally, eco
nomically and politically displaced from
their own 'aina, or land.
The Native Hawaiians are the indige
nous people of the land, with their own
history and culture. They are still in the is
lands. Moreover, disenfranchised in their
own land, they are struggling in various
ways: health, education, political rights
and cultural preservation ate among the
few. The packaged and commodified im
ages fed to tourists of the paradise with
hula girls, swaying palm trees, and beaut i
ful trees mask the fact that there are issues
among Native Hawaiians.
One small but important point: I would
also hesitate to describe McDonalds as
being a "Hawaiian McDonalds." McDon
alds is not Hawaiian. While I understand
that the term may have been used to de
scribe the setting of the McDonalds as
being in Hawai'i, the implications of the
adjective used to describe such an Ameri
can cultural icon are many.
In conclusion, I would like to say I hope
that the next time Stanford students visit
1 lawai'i they think at least just a little bit be
yond what is fed to them about the islands
as merely a place of "gentle balmy breezes,"
"gyrating" visitors and "beach mats."

Bush should have acted earlier
George Bush's assertion for months
that he could "do nothing" in the Middle
East is now disproven by his decision to act
today. Untold numbers of Iraelis and
Palestinians are now dead in the wake of
unfathomable destruction.
If lie can act in this environment of ex
treme destruction then he could have
more easily acted in the previous environ
ment â€” if his elementary understanding
of the world had prompted him to do
what everyone else has known he should
have done.
He blames Yasir Arafat fora "failure of
leadership" and mildly rebukes Ariel
Sharon. The most egregious failure of
leadership is that of Bush. Three billion
dollars of American taxes every year cer
tainly suggest that we have direct influ
ence in Israel.
Months before the current mayhem
the Palestinians begged for U.S. involve
ment. The record shows that when an
American president speaks with knowl
edge and authority,
Israel listens. Since he is the one man
on Earth whose actions could have pre
cluded this carnage and conflagration,
Bush should not be allowed to now bask
in the glow of the fires of the Middle
East.
