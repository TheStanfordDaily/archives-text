# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## There is truth to both pro-choice and pro-life arguments 
### JULIE RUVOLO GUEST COLUMNIST 
Before this turns into a full-Hedged "sta
tus of the fetus" debate, allow me to pro
vide a shift in perspective. Pro-life and pro
choice constituencies both support impor
tant values: the value of life, and the value
of freedom.
1, for one, have never made the mistake
of excluding a good alternative. If I want
vanilla and chocolate, 1 am going to get a
scoop of both. Or a half-scoop of both, or
whatever. Why do we feel like we need to
either exclusively support life or choice, or
bicker as to why one value is invalid?
Nobody likes abortions. Medical stu
dents don't like learning the procedure
(many opt out of it); women don't like

getting abortions; babies don't like get
ting aborted. No one here is advocating
more abortions.
And let's look at this whole rhetoric of
choice. There are about 1.5 million abor
tions a year. That means 1.5 million
women who don't want to get pregnant
are. And I lie number hasn't substantially
changed in 20 years, despite everyone's ef
forts to the contrary. That's hardly free
dom of choice.
Why is this entire debate focused on the
aftereffect? Why isn't it focused on the
causes of the unwanted pregnancy?
Let's look at the facts. The world is
not going to stop having sex because a
parent or a church or Dr. Dobson told
them to. People are not going to stop
having sex if you hide condoms from

them. And a lot of people are going to
have unprotected sex even when a new,
wonderful condom is sitting in the draw
er. And before you condemn all these
"stupid" people, ask yourself if you've
never foregone protection, just that one
time, and been lucky. Abortions are not
exclusive to the poor and uneducated â€”
surprise, they even happen among the
smart and promising youth at Stanford.
What about oral contraception? The Pill
is not accessible. Scared teenage girls don't
want to have it show up on their parents'
insurance bill. Or they're afraid of getting a
Pap smear at Planned Parenthood. Or the
lady behind the counter gets lost in paper
work tells her she was already given the
next month's Pill and refuses to give her
protection. And before you think these are

far-fetched scenarios, they have happened
to friends of mine.
Unless you're willing to say that all these
scared girls and irresponsible teens and
unaware or uneducated people deserve
what they get, then we need to get off Our
rhetorical high horses and address the big
ger social problems. We need to address
the baffling problem that some girls really
don't think they will get pregnant. That the
Pill isn't as accessible as it should be. That
maybe we should all have access to a kind
of birth control like Norplant that we don't
have to take every day or every time we
have sex.
If we want to increase responsibility, ed
ucation, and awareness, we need to start
engaging in real dialogue about real issues,
we need to clarify our goals and re-center

the issue, we need l>e critical of the system
in place, and we need to put our heads to
gether and think about alternatives.
We can value both life and choice by
preventing unwanted conception. Let's
not forget all the people who have come
before us, and let's not forget our power
to enact change. Prof. Carl Djerassi in
vented the first oral contraceptive. The
founders of Planned Parenthood and
family-planning groups put their heads
together to address the system's insuffi
ciencies at the time.
Now it is our turn to refocus the issues
and do something effective to prevent
1.5 million unwanted pregnancies.
