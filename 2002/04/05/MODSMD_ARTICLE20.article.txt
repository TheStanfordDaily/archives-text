# Scientists develop genetic blueprint of rice plant genome
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” New maps of
the rice genome will make it easier for
plant breeders to develop hardy, high
yielding versions of a variety of crops
without the use of genetic engineering,
scientists say.
The genetic blueprint of rice is simi
lar to the genomes for corn, wheat and
other plants descended from wild
grasses. Plant geneticists say the rice
map will make it much quicker to iden
tify genetic traits and create new ver
sions of crops by the old-fashioned
method of cross breeding.
"The future of agriculture will be nav
igated using the rice genome map," said
Steve Briggs, president ofSyngenta AG's
Torrey Mesa Research Institute.
Syngenta and a China-based group of

researchers published in Science maga
zine yesterday draft maps of the
genomes of separate subspecies of rice. A
more complete map of the rice genome is
nearing completion by an international
consortium of scientists.
Rice is a staple for half the world's
population, and the decoding of its
genes is expected to help alleviate world
hunger by making it easier for scientists
to come up with varieties that are more
nutritious and have higher yields.
I his will be the first genetic mapping
project "to yield tangible results for hu
mankind from the standpoints of food se
curih and combating malnutrition," the
directors of two major international crop
research centers wrote in a Science article
accompanying the genome reports.

Stephen Goff, leader of the Syngenta
team, said the variety it studied, known
as japonica, should reveal the gene that
causes production of vitamin A. That in
formation could speed the development
ofrice varieties that have higher levels of
the nutrient. Vitamin A deficiency is a
major cause of blindness in Asia.
But the rice genome also is impor
tant because of the road map it pro
vides for other crops with much more
complex genomes, such as corn and
wheat. Genes for traits such as resis
tance to heat or disease appear at simi
lar locations in the genomes of all the
related crops.
Conventional plant breeding is a labo
rious process, sometimes requiring a
decade or more of crossing and back

crossing plants to ensure that the result
ing crop variety has the best traits possi
ble. Scientists say knowledge of the rice
genome will enable them to find the ge
netic traits they want in seed banks and
then to track those traits through the
new plant varieties they're developing.
"It takes what is usually a 12 to 15-year
activity to something that takes three or
four years. That's pretty major," said Jef
frey Bennetzen, a biologist at Purdue
University.
By using conventional breeding
methods, crop developers avoid the has
sle of getting government approval to
test and commercialize genetically engi
neered crops. Biotech crops have met
strong consumer resistance in Europe,
and some U.S. food companies have

shied from using them.
Syngenta plans to start field testing
this summer a variety of corn that was
developed using the rice data to be
more resistant to cold, damp weather in
the spring.
"Conventional plant breeding is
going to be the major benefactor of the
genomics era," said Benjamin Burr, a
plant geneticist at the Brookhaven Na
tional Laboratory in New York.
The genome mapping suggests rice
may have more genes than humans. I he
genome of the indica type studied by the
Chinese group is believed to contain
45,000 to 56,000 genes, compared to
30,000 to 40,000 for humans. Thejapon
ica subspecies is believed to have 42,000
to 63,000.
