# Hydrogen leak forces NASA shuttle delay

### 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) —A leak of
highly flammable hydrogen fuel at the launch
pad forced NASA to postpone space shuttle At
lantis' lif toff yesterday for at least three days.
The fuel spewed from a broken pipe fora
minute, but the white cloud dissipated and did
not pose any danger, said launch director Mike
Leinbach.
I he pad had already had been evacuated for
the hazardous fueling operation, and the shut
tle was dozens of feet from the leak. The seven
astronauts were hours away from boarding At
lantis and had not even begun to suit up.
"We didn't ever consider this a threat to the
vehicle," Leinbach said.
Atlantis' liftoff on a space station construc
tion mission was postponed until at least Sun-

day so that the leak .H7 feet above the pad can be
repaired. Atlantis had been scheduled to lilt oil
in late afternoon with the newest piece of the
space station, an elaborate 44-foot girder.
An engineer spotted the leak on a screen via
camera, and the fueling immediately was halt
ed about an hour after it had begun.
It appears a weld gave way because of the
shock of the cold fuel on the 16-inch-diameter
aluminum pipe, Leinbach said. The pipes
and their welds date to at least the 1980s, and
age is believed to have contributed to the
problem.
Technicians will put a clamshell-like clamp
over the crack that formed in the weld. The
crack is about one-fourth of an inch wide and
covers almost the entire circumference of the

pipe.
NASA does not intend to inspect other welds
in the line, Leinbach said.
"This mobile launcher has gone through 80-
some tankings and has performed perfectly
line, so we do not leel we have a generic prob
lem with all of our welds out there," he said.
1 lie leak was not in the plumbing that leeds
liquid hydrogen into the shuttle's big external
tank, but rather in a line that vents fuel vapors
out of the tank to prevent a buildup of excess
pressure.
The fact that the leak occurred outside the
shuttle makes the repairs much easier-and
quicker. Fuel leaks grounded the shuttle lleet
for months in 1990, but those leaks happened
inside the spaceships.
