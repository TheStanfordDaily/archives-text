7 UCLA (10-4, 6-1) on Saturday at noon at the
Taube Family Tennis Stadium.
" These are the matches we've been looking for
ward to all year," senior Lauren Kalvaria said. "These
are probably the two best teams in the Pac-10."
This weekend, Stanford will try to show that,
good as they are, USC and UCLA aren't of the
Cardinal's caliber.
"We're really going to get pumped up for this
weekend," sophomore Emilia Anderson said.
Although Stanford has lx>en looking forward to

this weekend fora long time, their minds and bodies
did not wander from the task at hand yesterday, as the
team won all three doubles and all six singles matches.
"We didn't want to look past this one," Ander
son said.
The C Cardinal won the doubles point handily to get
off to a 1 -0 team point advantage. Kalvaria and senior
Gabriela Lastra, the nation's No. 3 duo, defeated Cal's
No. 44 Raquel Kops-Jones and Jody Scheldt, 8-3.
Also, the No. 15 tandem of sophomore Lauren
Barnikow and freshman Erin Burdette held off
Christina Fusano and Jieun Jacobs, 8-5. Senior Keiko
Tokuda and freshman Story Tweedie- Yates iced the
doubles cake with a hard-fought 9-7 win over (Cather
ine Lynch and Carla Arguellas.
Singles proved equally sweet for Stanford.
Kalvaria, ranked No. 10 in the country, outclassed
No. 36 Kops-Jones, 6-1,6-4, to lead the squad. No. 18
Lastra shut down No. 73 Lynch, 6-1, 6-1, and
Barnikow outlasted No. 71 Jacobs in a marathon 7-6,
1-6, 6-2 match. No. 24 Burdette outdueled No. 60
Fusano, 7-5, 6-3, Tokuda beat Scheldt 6-2, 6-3; and
Anderson put away Arguellas, 6-1,6-3.
Burdette remained perfect when playing fourth
flight singles (9-0), as did Tokuda in the fifth flight
(10-0). Overall, the team is an impressive 90-12 in all
singles competitions played during dual matches.
The Cardinal's dominance yesterday was not the
result of a weak opponent, however, but rather of a
strong team effort.
"Cal is a tough team, and they get pretty fired up
when they come over to Palo Alto," Kalvaria said. "We
had a good performance today."
The match, which had a 4 p.m. start time, posed a
slight challenge for both teams.
"It's definitely different playing under the
lights, when it's a little colder," Anderson said. "All
of us are used to playing in different conditions,
though, so we can handle it."
"It's kind of tough because we feel like we're wait
ing all day to play the matches," Kalvaria said. "It's
definitely an adjustment."
The team believes that yesterday's results bode
well for the Cardinal's chances this weekend against
the Los Angeles schools. Both USC and UCLA are ca
pable of upending any opponent in the nation, but
Stanford hopes to be on top of its game.
"We're looking forward to it," Anderson said.
"Everyone will get a tough match."
US(C is led by the nation's No. 5 singles player,
Jewel Peterson, and also has strong competitors in
No. 31 Luana Magnani, No. 72 Katarina Markovski
and No. 88 Maureen Diaz. In doubles, Peterson and
Tiffany Brymer form the country's No. 8 team, and
Anita Loyola and Magnani come in at No. 25.
UCLA offers a similarly stiff singles slate, led by
freshman phenom Megan Bradley at No. 4. She is fol
lowed by No. 7 Sara Walker, and No. 70 Petya Mari
nova. Marinova and Walker team up to form the No.
5 doubles tandem. Bradley and Lauren Fisher come
in at No. 6.
USC beat UCLA 4-3 this year on the road but lost
to them 5-2 at home.
So far, Stanford has the best record in the Pac-10
and arguably the best talent pool, and this weekend
offers the team a proving ground as it continue it.s de
fense of their 2001 NCAA championship.
"I feel confident that we can come out victori
ous," Kalvaria said.
