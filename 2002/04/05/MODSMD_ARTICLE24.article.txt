### JERRY LU STAFF WRITER 
Any student will tell you that the ulti
mate in college experiences is the time
honored road trip. This weekend, the No.
6 Stanford men's tennis team will begin
what would be an otherwise pleasant week
of traveling around California and Ari
zona, if it weren't for the two very big road
blocks of USC and UCLA.

MEN'S TENNIS
Today: No. 5 Stanford at No. 18 USC,
Los Angeles
Saturday: No. 4 Stanford at No. 2
UCLA, Los Angeles

Stanford (15-1, 2-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) starts the five-game road series with a
difficult weekend of match-ups against No.
18 USC (14-4, 2-0) today and No. 2 UCLA
(16-1, 2-0) on tomorrow. The three schools
are tied atop the leaderboard with two con
ference wins apiece. Although this week
end's games will not count towards Pac-10
standings, the victor will have a decisive
edge in the title race.
The contest could also have wider ram
ifications for the schools involved. Stan
ford, UCLA, and USC are the three domi
nant tennis powerhouses in the NCAA.
Combined, the schools have won an as
tounding 47 of the last 58 men's team
championships (Stanford 17, UCLA 15,
USC 15). A victory here could signify a
push towards another title.
The matchup against USC will mark
the 155 th time the two schools have
played since they began playing in 1925.

Stanford holds a 50-42 record against
USC since 1967, with Stanford winning
the last competition Feb. 0 at the National
Team Indoor Championships.
Last weekend, the Trojans defeated a
pair of conference rivals, downing Arizona,
5-2 and crushing Arizona State, 6-1. Al
though the Trojans are ranked a season
low 18th, the team still possesses formidable
depth and ability. The Trojans boast four
ranked singles players on its squad, inc hid
ing No. 33 Andrew Park, as well as the sev
enth-ranked doubles team of Ryan Moore
and Nick Rainy.
Saturday's contest against UCLA proves
to be a more challenging competition. The
Bruins, who also overpowered the Arizona
schools last weekend for conference victo
ries, own a 10-game winning streak stretch
ing back to Feb. 7, which includes three
wins over top-10 opponents.
UCIA's team credentials are even more
impressive than USC's.
The Bruin squad has four ranked play
ers, including two, Tobais Clemens and
Marcin Matkowski, in the top 25. In addi
tion, the No. 2 doubles team of Marcin
Matkowski and Jean-Julien Rojer and the
No. 39 duo of Tobais Clemens and Lissi Ke
tola pose a significant threat to recent Car
dinal doubles dominance.
Stanford enters this weekend's matches
coining off a dominant four-game homcs
tand over spring break. Despite the current
eight-game winning streak that includes
four shutout victories, Stanford fell one po
sition in the latest rankings to No. 0, the
lowest rating of the year for the Cardinal.
