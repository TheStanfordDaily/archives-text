# Stanford heads to SoCal

### JERRY LU STAFF WRITER 
Any student will tell you that the ulti
mate in college experiences is the time
honored road trip. This weekend, the No.
6 Stanford men's tennis team will begin
what would be an otherwise pleasant week
of traveling around California and Ari
zona, if it weren't for the two very big road
blocks of USC and UCLA.

MEN'S TENNIS
Today: No. 5 Stanford at No. 18 USC,
Los Angeles
Saturday: No. 4 Stanford at No. 2
UCLA, Los Angeles

Stanford (15-1, 2-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) starts the five-game road series with a
difficult weekend of match-ups against No.
18 USC (14-4, 2-0) today and No. 2 UCLA
(16-1, 2-0) on tomorrow. The three schools
are tied atop the leaderboard with two con
ference wins apiece. Although this week
end's games will not count towards Pac-10
standings, the victor will have a decisive
edge in the title race.
The contest could also have wider ram
ifications for the schools involved. Stan
ford, UCLA, and USC are the three domi
nant tennis powerhouses in the NCAA.
Combined, the schools have won an as
tounding 47 of the last 58 men's team
championships (Stanford 17, UCLA 15,
USC 15). A victory here could signify a
push towards another title.
The matchup against USC will mark
the 155 th time the two schools have
played since they began playing in 1925.

Stanford holds a 50-42 record against
USC since 1967, with Stanford winning
the last competition Feb. 0 at the National
Team Indoor Championships.
Last weekend, the Trojans defeated a
pair of conference rivals, downing Arizona,
5-2 and crushing Arizona State, 6-1. Al
though the Trojans are ranked a season
low 18th, the team still possesses formidable
depth and ability. The Trojans boast four
ranked singles players on its squad, inc hid
ing No. 33 Andrew Park, as well as the sev
enth-ranked doubles team of Ryan Moore
and Nick Rainy.
Saturday's contest against UCLA proves
to be a more challenging competition. The
Bruins, who also overpowered the Arizona
schools last weekend for conference victo
ries, own a 10-game winning streak stretch
ing back to Feb. 7, which includes three
wins over top-10 opponents.
UCIA's team credentials are even more
impressive than USC's.
The Bruin squad has four ranked play
ers, including two, Tobais Clemens and
Marcin Matkowski, in the top 25. In addi
tion, the No. 2 doubles team of Marcin
Matkowski and Jean-Julien Rojer and the
No. 39 duo of Tobais Clemens and Lissi Ke
tola pose a significant threat to recent Car
dinal doubles dominance.
Stanford enters this weekend's matches
coining off a dominant four-game homcs
tand over spring break. Despite the current
eight-game winning streak that includes
four shutout victories, Stanford fell one po
sition in the latest rankings to No. 0, the
lowest rating of the year for the Cardinal.
The team kicked off spring break by
hosting Hawaii (12-7) on March
23. In an impressive display, the
Cardinal won 2 of 3 doubles
matches and 5 of 6 singles matt li
es to convincingly put away the
Warriors 6-1. During the match,
No. 4 K.J. Hippensteel, No. 46
David Martin and No. 57 Ryan
Haviland all chalked up impres
sive straight-set victories. The
losses at No. 6 singles and No. 3
doubles were closely contested
with freshman Phil Sheng falling
in third-set tiebreak, 7-6, 2-6,6-7,
and the team of Joe Kao and
Chris Meyer losing, 8-6.
flie Cardinal next blitzed
through Brigham Young on
March 27 with a deceptively diffi
cult 7-0 blanking of the Cougars.
An extended battle at No.l dou
bles erupted between the top
ranked Stanford tandem of Scott
Lipskyand David Martin and the
No. 10 team of Carlos Lozano and
Cert Vilms. Although the Cougar
duo was able to pull ahead to a 5-
4 lead against the Cardinal, Lip
sky / Martin took the next four
games and the set. At No. 3 dou
bles, l'liil Sheng and fellow fresh
man Sam Warburg outlasted Nit
Losee and Eric Nguyen, 9-8.

The Cougars put up similar
resistance in singles play. At the
conclusion of the first sets, BYU
held even with Stanford, with
both schools leading three
games. However, all three Stan
ford players, Martin, Haviland,
and Kao, rallied to eventual
three-set victories.
Compared to BYU, Stanford's
March 29th victory over Oregon
(11-5) was a cakewalk. The Car
dinal massacred the Ducks in a
match that saw the Cardinal only
dropping one set. Stanford swept
the doubles matches, capped off
by an impressive performance by
Sheng/ Warburg to defeat Chris
King and Manuel Kost, 8-2. flu-
Cardinal then swept the first five
singles matches in straight sets,
with Sheng, playing sixth singles,
finally outlasting Creg Dubour
dieu 7-6, 2-6, 7-(>.
In the last of the four matches,
and the only one against a ranked
team, Stanford posted a 6-1 victory
over No. 31 Washington (14-4,0-2).
In a battle of ranked players,
Hippensteel (18-2, 12-2 dual
match) continued his recent dom
ination by taking down No. 39
Alex Vlaski, 6-3,6-3, while Martin
tackled No. 84 Malt Hanlin, 6-3,
6-7, 6-3. Warburg (20-7, 12-2
dual match), winning at No. 5 sin
gles, also continued his red-hot
eight-match winning streak.
