# Cardinal stages upset in prelims
## Cardinal will face Iowa Michigan Ohio State and California in finals 
### NEMIL DALAL EDITORIAL STAFF 
In a decadent fairy world of
flowers and bells and leprechauns,
things would go as planned, Duke
and Florida State would win na
tional titles every year and the soft
caress of Cinderella would be an
unknown feeling.
Believe the rankings, and the
men's gymnastics team members
shouldn't have slept last night with
smiles on their faces. Believe the
rankings, and the team should
have been solely thinking beyond
team competition and plotting on
how best to compete in the indi
vidual finals. Believe the rankings,
and the Cardinal should not have
upset this fairy tale world.
Fortunately, the men's gymnas
tics team disrupted this world as
they outperformed and outclassed
three other teams to finish third in
the afternoon session at the pre
liminary round of the NCAA
championships, held in Norman,
Okla. at the Lloyd Noble Center.
Posting its second highest
score of the season, 214.000,
during the qualifying session, the

team resoundingly beat No. 4
Illinois, No. 5 Minnesota and No.
10 Temple. Even more surpris
ingly, the team was within 1.375
points of defending national
champion No. 2 Ohio State, and
a scant 0.075 points behind No. 8
Michigan. Both Illinois and Min
nesota had beaten the Cardinal
previously this season.
Highlighting the upset was
sophomore Ail-American Dan Gill,
who finished first on the parallel
bars and vault, with a 9.100 and a
9.700 respectively. Ranked No. 1
in the country on the vault, his
score on the event was the highest
of his career.
Junior Marshall Erwin, in
something that is becoming a bit of
a habit, claimed first place on the
rings with a 9.500, while also assist
ing senior David Durante on the
pommel horse with a 9.150. Du
rante led the team on the horse
with a 9.350, good for fourth place.
Despite the strength of the
marquee Cardinal players, it was
the strong routines of a freshman
and several seniors that allowed
the team to claim a spot in to
morrow's finals.
Freshman Kelly Lang, begin
ning to show his true potential, was
rock-solid as he performed last on
the parallel bars. After watching
two of his teammates struggle on
the event, he scored a collegiate

best 8.925, claiming third place on
the event.
Senior co-captain Rico Andrade
faced a similar situation on the
horizontal bar, but earned a 9.250
as he took third. Senior Jason Blitz,
competing for the second time this
season, earned sixth place on the
event, while fellow senior David
Ludlow claimed ninth.
Senior Cade Raggio claimed
seventh on the floor exercise and
tied for fourth on the vault, while
junior Matt McLean tied for 10th
place on the vault.
For Coach Sadao Hamada, a
30-year veteran, this meet was a bit
of a heart-stopper.
"I don't know how much I
can take," said Hamada. "It re
ally was scary."
The competition stiffens tomor
row, as the team again faces Michi
gan and Ohio State, in addition to
No. 2 Oklahoma, No. 6 California,
and No. 7 lowa.
While the Cardinal faces an up
hill battle, it can take comfort that,
a decade ago, the Cardinal fin
ished behind top-ranked Nebras
ka in the preliminary round but
went onto edge out the Corn
huskers for the national champi
onship in one of the most exciting
finals in Cardinal history.
After all, what is a little more dis
order in this already topsy-turvy
world?
