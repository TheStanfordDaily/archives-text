Saturday: No. 10 Stanford at NCAA North
Central Regional Championships, Denver

But in order to meet that goal, the Cardinal
needs to place first or second in the regional meet.
Stanford will face five other schools, including
No. 3 Georgia (22-2), No. 14 Denver (10-3), No. 23
Missouri (2-5), Air Force (8-8) and Utah State (8-8)
in Denver tomorrow.
"We have a wonderful opportunity with the re
gional in Denver," said junior Alissa Cooper. "Since
we won't have to travel too far, it will help keep us
feeling rested and ready for the meet."
Not only do they have the advantage of close
ness, but Stanford also has a strong team competing
this weekend.
"Since everyone is strong and healthy and we
have so much depth, we have a lot of options going
into Denver, which is great," said head coach Kris
ten Smyth.

Other key gymnasts are Lise Leveille, the indi
vidually-ranked sophomore who is ranked 10th
nationally on the balance beam with a 9.900 aver
age, and senior Becky Meldrum, who is in a
three-way tie for 11th on the uneven bars with a
9.910 overall score.
Cioing into Denver with this strong, healthy
team, Stanford is focusing on the little things.
"Over spring break we have really been iron
ing out all of the little details in our routines, and
that gives all of us a bit of extra confidence head
ing into Denver," Cooper said.
Stanford will need this confidence going into
the regional championships. Three of the teams
competing this year in the North Central Region
al Meet qualified for the national championships
last year (Georgia, Denver and Stanford), but
only two will advance this year.
If Stanford makes the cut, it will he compet
ing against 12 other schools, six of whom will
compete in the morning while the other six
compete in the afternoon. 1 lie top three teams
from each session advance to what is known as
the Super Six.
If Stanford sends any individual team mem
bers to the national championships, it will com
pete in individual events the next day.
While the Cardinal keeps its eyes on its ulti
mate goal of reaching the national champi
onships, they will have to maintain their focus
and energy in order to cross the final hurdle in
Denver.
."Denver has great tans and will put on a great
meetT'said Smyth. "We're really excited because
ultimately, we can control our own destiny
there."
