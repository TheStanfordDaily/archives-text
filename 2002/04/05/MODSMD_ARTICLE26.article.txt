Saturday: No. 10 Stanford at NCAA North
Central Regional Championships, Denver

But in order to meet that goal, the Cardinal
needs to place first or second in the regional meet.
Stanford will face five other schools, including
No. 3 Georgia (22-2), No. 14 Denver (10-3), No. 23
Missouri (2-5), Air Force (8-8) and Utah State (8-8)
in Denver tomorrow.
"We have a wonderful opportunity with the re
gional in Denver," said junior Alissa Cooper. "Since
we won't have to travel too far, it will help keep us
feeling rested and ready for the meet."
Not only do they have the advantage of close
ness, but Stanford also has a strong team competing
this weekend.
"Since everyone is strong and healthy and we
have so much depth, we have a lot of options going
into Denver, which is great," said head coach Kris
ten Smyth.
