## 'Glamour' girl Glamour magazine recognizes Sagar for achievements 
### IRENE NOGUCHI STAFF WRITER 
Between "How to Size Up a
Man in Five Minutes" and
"Dream Solutions for Hair
Nightmares," there's one test in
Glamour magazine that doesn't
require a fashion manual:
Glamour's Top 10 College
Womeji of the Year.
Senior Ashwini Sagar
passed that test with flying col
ors when she won one of five
honorable mentions, edging
out over 700 other applicants
nationwide.
"It's really great when a mag
azine recognizes women based
on academics and personal
goals, rather than the more su
perficial reasons you might see,"
said Sagar, who was notified

about the award over the sum
mer. She didn't get $1,000 or
the free trip to New York—
those prizes went to the top ten
winners—but she did get the
recognition of the magazine's
12-million person readership.
Known for its fashion "Dos
and Don'ts" feature, Glamour
showcases a different side of
femininity with its "Top Ten"
competition. The annual con
test honors female seniors with a
dedication to academics, com
munity and inspiring goals.
"Celebrate your achieve
ments!" the ad reads in pink and
orange. But fancy lettering
aside, the contest chooses
women who do everything from
gene research to founding
hunger outreach programs. It
lias evolved from 1957, when it
was called, "Glamour's 10 Best-
Dressed College Girls."

Senior Ashwini Sagar won one of five honorable mentions in Glam
our magazine's Top 10 College Women of the Year issue. She edged
out more than 700 applicants.
their hair and make-up
"glammed" lip beside their lists of
accomplishments.
"We look for someone who has
gone beyond the average one
night-a-week volunteer thing,"
said Lynda Laux-Bachand, an edi
tor and contest coordinator at
Glamour. "We don't always pick
young women who are going to
save the world, but quite often,
that's what their goal is."
Sagar's focus is a world issue:
women's health. For her honors
thesis, she researched aggressive
behavior in women with bulimia
nervosa.
Sagar, a psychology major, test
ed 50 women from Stanford and
local areas over the past year. The
results were surprising, she said.
"International students tended
to have more serious problems,
partially because international
countries lack [women's health] re
sources," Sagar said.
But even though the U.S. is "in
undated" with information,

"there's a lot of societal and cultur
al pressure to stray away from
healthy behaviors. We know
what's healthy, but we do some
thing different," Sagar said.
This fall Sagar will be taking
her research on the road, pre
senting at the American Associa
tion of Child and Adolescent Psy
chiatry Conference in September,
and publishing in a Stanford re
search journal.
"She's a whirlwind," said psy
chiatry professor Hans Steiner,
who is Sagar's thesis advisor.
"When you give students
feedback, you get a one-to-two
week breather, but with her, you
get a 24-to-48 hour turn
around," Steiner said, laughing.
"I [tell] my assistant, 'I can't be
lieve it, she's back!"'
Sagar has worked in his lab for
the past year and a half and will
contribute one of the chapters to
Steiner's textbook, "Child and
Adolescent Psychiatry," set to
come out in English and German
in 2003.
Next year she's going to Colum
bia to begin work on a master's in
Human Nutrition. And after that,
Maybe obstetrics or gynecology or

anything relating to women's
health, Sagar said.
"She's got five things on her
plate at once and is always on 'go'
mode," said senior Lyclia Poon,
Sagar's co-worker at the Women's
Center for the past three years.
Sagar is the Body Image/Health
Wellness CCoordinator there, and is
the founder of B.E.S.T. (Body
image and Eating Concerns Sup
port Team).
Teaching aerobics on the side
helps her find a "happy medium,"
she said. "My 7 a.m. class and the
women [there] are my pride and
joy," she said.
Sagar joins the ranks of hon
orees from the Class of 2000, Rita
Ng and H'sien Hayward, as well as
Glamour's most famous winner:
Martha Stewart from 1961.
To promote issues like women's
health and body image, Glamour's
visibility is key, Sagar said.
"You can't deny the fact main
stream magazines are a big part of
popular culture," Sagar said. "So
if you can infuse this message it's
not just about looks, that'll get
across to the target audience that
needs to see it. That's what this
contest is about."

perficial reasons you might see,"
said Sagar, who was notified

about the award over the sum
mer. She didn't get $1,000 or
the free trip to New York—
those prizes went to the top ten
winners—but she did get the
recognition of the magazine's
12-million person readership.
Known for its fashion "Dos
and Don'ts" feature, Glamour
showcases a different side of
femininity with its "Top Ten"
competition. The annual con
test honors female seniors with a
dedication to academics, com
munity and inspiring goals.
"Celebrate your achieve
ments!" the ad reads in pink and
orange. But fancy lettering
aside, the contest chooses
women who do everything from
gene research to founding
hunger outreach programs. It
lias evolved from 1957, when it
was called, "Glamour's 10 Best-
Dressed College Girls."

Senior Ashwini Sagar won one of five honorable mentions in Glam
our magazine's Top 10 College Women of the Year issue. She edged
out more than 700 applicants.

"glammed" lip beside their lists of
accomplishments.
"We look for someone who has
gone beyond the average one
night-a-week volunteer thing,"
said Lynda Laux-Bachand, an edi
tor and contest coordinator at
Glamour. "We don't always pick
young women who are going to
save the world, but quite often,
that's what their goal is."
Sagar's focus is a world issue:
women's health. For her honors
thesis, she researched aggressive
behavior in women with bulimia
nervosa.
Sagar, a psychology major, test
ed 50 women from Stanford and
local areas over the past year. The
results were surprising, she said.
"International students tended
to have more serious problems,
partially because international
countries lack [women's health] re
sources," Sagar said.
But even though the U.S. is "in
undated" with information,

"there's a lot of societal and cultur
al pressure to stray away from
healthy behaviors. We know
what's healthy, but we do some
thing different," Sagar said.
This fall Sagar will be taking
her research on the road, pre
senting at the American Associa
tion of Child and Adolescent Psy
chiatry Conference in September,
and publishing in a Stanford re
search journal.
"She's a whirlwind," said psy
chiatry professor Hans Steiner,
who is Sagar's thesis advisor.
"When you give students
feedback, you get a one-to-two
week breather, but with her, you
get a 24-to-48 hour turn
around," Steiner said, laughing.
"I [tell] my assistant, 'I can't be
lieve it, she's back!"'
Sagar has worked in his lab for
the past year and a half and will
contribute one of the chapters to
Steiner's textbook, "Child and
Adolescent Psychiatry," set to
come out in English and German
in 2003.
Next year she's going to Colum
bia to begin work on a master's in
Human Nutrition. And after that,
Maybe obstetrics or gynecology or

anything relating to women's
health, Sagar said.
"She's got five things on her
plate at once and is always on 'go'
mode," said senior Lyclia Poon,
Sagar's co-worker at the Women's
Center for the past three years.
Sagar is the Body Image/Health
Wellness CCoordinator there, and is
the founder of B.E.S.T. (Body
image and Eating Concerns Sup
port Team).
Teaching aerobics on the side
helps her find a "happy medium,"
she said. "My 7 a.m. class and the
women [there] are my pride and
joy," she said.
Sagar joins the ranks of hon
orees from the Class of 2000, Rita
Ng and H'sien Hayward, as well as
Glamour's most famous winner:
Martha Stewart from 1961.
To promote issues like women's
health and body image, Glamour's
visibility is key, Sagar said.
"You can't deny the fact main
stream magazines are a big part of
popular culture," Sagar said. "So
if you can infuse this message it's
not just about looks, that'll get
across to the target audience that
needs to see it. That's what this
contest is about."
