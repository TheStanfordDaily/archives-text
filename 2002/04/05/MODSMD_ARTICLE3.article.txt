## 'Glamour' girl Glamour magazine recognizes Sagar for achievements 
### IRENE NOGUCHI STAFF WRITER 
Between "How to Size Up a
Man in Five Minutes" and
"Dream Solutions for Hair
Nightmares," there's one test in
Glamour magazine that doesn't
require a fashion manual:
Glamour's Top 10 College
Womeji of the Year.
Senior Ashwini Sagar
passed that test with flying col
ors when she won one of five
honorable mentions, edging
out over 700 other applicants
nationwide.
"It's really great when a mag
azine recognizes women based
on academics and personal
goals, rather than the more su
perficial reasons you might see,"
said Sagar, who was notified

about the award over the sum
mer. She didn't get $1,000 or
the free trip to New York—
those prizes went to the top ten
winners—but she did get the
recognition of the magazine's
12-million person readership.
Known for its fashion "Dos
and Don'ts" feature, Glamour
showcases a different side of
femininity with its "Top Ten"
competition. The annual con
test honors female seniors with a
dedication to academics, com
munity and inspiring goals.
"Celebrate your achieve
ments!" the ad reads in pink and
orange. But fancy lettering
aside, the contest chooses
women who do everything from
gene research to founding
hunger outreach programs. It
lias evolved from 1957, when it
was called, "Glamour's 10 Best-
Dressed College Girls."
Winners were featured in
Glamour's October issue, with
