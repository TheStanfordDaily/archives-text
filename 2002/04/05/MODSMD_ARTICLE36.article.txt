# 'Blade II': Supermodels kick ass
## 
### ALICE KIM 
Goddammit. "Blade II"
is not a baby movie. It was
not made for babies, it was
not marketed towards ba
bies, so don't bring your
baby to see it. Nothing is
more unsettling than bear
ing a baby's screeching cry

after every wham-bam fight or gore fest.
You hear that, stupid parent who was at the
Century Cinema 16 Saturday night?
However, stupid parenting did not spoil
the odd pleasures of "Blade II"for me. It
begins in high gear, with a decked-out
Blade kicking everyone's ass to rescue
Whistler (Kris Kristofferson). Yes, Whistler
is back, and he lives and works with Blade
along with a new occupant called Scud
(Norman Reedus), a greasy and mulleted
armory expert.
Shortly after Whistler's return, Blade is
visited by a vampire group called "Blood
pack," who wish to form an alliance with
him. There is a new threat in town in the
form of Reapers, a new group of vampires
who feed on vampires as well as humans,
and are impervious to silver and garlic.
Originally, "Bloodpack" was created to
hunt Blade, but because of the fearsome
threat of the Reapers' exponential repro
duction (the victims of Reapers become
Reapers), they and Blade grudgingly join
forces to fight... never mind.

The plot, ridiculous and riddled with
holes, doesn't really matter. Just be as-

sured that there will
be double crosses.
There will be mo
torcycles. There
will be curmud
geonly grumbling
from Whistler. And
most definitely,

there will be a slo-mo shot of the gang
decked out in their wicked, cyberpunk/
goth-lite black leather, walking towards a
vampire rave, also full of cool and amaz
ingly skinny people.
What is more important about "Blade 11"
is how cool everyone and everything is sup
posed to look.
The pure look of the movie is excellent,
as created by director Guillermo del Toro.
His fascination with medical horror is evi
dent â€” in the murky botdes of fluid that lit
ter some scenes, a row of bottles full of fetus
es, and a spectacularly disgusting, fascinat
ing medical dissection. Everything looks
dark and clammy, and things you'd rather
not look at seem to be lurking in corners,
just out of sight.
The fighting was ridiculous and enter
taining as hell, as it only can be when you
combine kung-fu and crazy ass WWF-style
moves. The action scenes had everything
known to man thrown in, from karate kicks
to the People's Elbow to the suplex. Some
one also gets cut in half.

Blade and the
Bloodpack fight
with an ungodly
professional
wrestling-meets-
kung-fu technique,
but they also look
like supermodels.
Which is to be ex
pected. The "real"
vampires have a
snobbish disdain for
the unsightly
Reapers, who are
classically ugly in the
Nosferatu / Dr. Evil
sort of manner.
Not only do they
look utterly homely
next to the sleek,
trendy vampires, but
they also have anoth
er strange feature.
When feeding, their

chins open up to reveal appendages that
have a uniquely vulval and insect-like ap
pearance. At a preview showing of "Blade
II," when del Toro was asked, "Could you
comment on the vaginal influence of the
Reapers?," he responded, "You have to un
derstand make-up artists, they never get
any pussy, so they are always creating it!"
As for the cast, Wesley Snipes as Blade is
highly enjoyable to behold. His fighting is
strong and dangerously graceful, and lie

can hold a series of striking poses very well.
That is pretty much all there is to do.
Vampire princess Nyssa (Leonor Varela)
wears her black leather very nicely, but is
too tight-lipped and school-marmish to be
interesting.
In my opinion, "Blade II" is best enjoyed
without too much concern to plot or dia
logue. Instead, watch the nice fighting, the
pretty costumes and revel in the stylized
horror of it all. And don't bring your baby.
