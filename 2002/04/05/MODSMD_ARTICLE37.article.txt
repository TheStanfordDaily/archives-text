# 'Panic Room' can't join the 'Club'

### ANTHONY HA 
"Panic Room" is not "Fight Club."
Remember this, and everything
should go reasonably well.
"Fight Club," director David
Fincher's previous movie (and by far
his best), was an out-of-control, de
structive film, one that reached out
and smacked the viewer in the face.
Some hated it for its macho-fascist

pseudo-philosophizing and the adoring eye with which it cap
tured grown men beating each other to a bloody pulp. Others,
myself included, adored the film for the savage, nihilistic glee
with which it attacked corporate lifestyles, for the rich, dark
world Fincher painted with his camera and for the fact that the
movie was willing to take risks, even if that occasionally meant
falling flat on its face.
The point? "Fight Club" demanded that those who
watched it give a damn, one way or another.
"Panic Room," on the other hand, is tightly constructed en
tertainment, a two-hour thrill ride — nothing more, nothing
less. You walk in, you enjoy (or don't enjoy) the movie, then
you walk out and forget about it.
Unlike "Fight Club," it's unlikely that you'll care enough to
have a strong opinion about "Panic Room," or that any of its
images, ideas or lines of dialogue will lodge themselves per
manently into your brain and pop up unpredictably, like the
pornographic pictures that "Fight Club" s Tyler Durden
splices into kiddie flicks. 1 Uglily competent escapism is hardly
something to take for granted, but viewed in light of "Fight
Club" 's commercial failure, "Panic Room" appears to be ex
actly what some feared — a strategic retreat.
So now that I've spent half the review whining about how

"Panic Room" falls short of "Fight Club," let's talk about why
it's a worthwhile movie anyway.

It begins with an impressive credit sequence
that gradually descends into the man-made
canyons of Manhattan, easing the viewer into
the film's claustrophobic world. Recent di
vorcee Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) and her
teenage daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart)
move into a new house on the Upper West
Side, only to have it broken into on their very
first night.

When they realize that there are burglars in their home,
mother and daughter hide themselves in the house's "panic
room," a solid steel enclosure armed with a state-of-the-art-se
curity system. Unfortunately, the loot the burglars want is in
the panic room, so an elaborate cat-and-mouse game begins,
staged entirely within the confines of the Altmans' new home.
Even though nothing can completely hide "Panic Room" 's
deeply derivative and formulaic nature, the entire film is or
chestrated with talent and care. David Koepp's ("Stir of
Echoes") script, lightly tapping the same wellspring of urban
unease that fueled "Fight Club," adequately supplies a few
twists and turns, and his terse dialogue, while uninspired, gets
the job done.
His characterization is likewise "just good enough," and ex
cellent performances fill in the gaps. Forest Whitaker, playing
the smartest, most humane burglar (the "good bad guy"), bal
ances a hangdog expression with grim determination; he
gives pathos and sympathy to his familiar role. As always, Jodie
Foster — still icily beautiful as she approaches 40, in case any
one was wondering — carefully modulates her performance,
but as the tense, fiercely protective Meg, this style works and
really pays off when she finally explodes.
Fincher's swooping camera manages to capture the cav

ei nous, labyrinth nature of the house while maintaining an
ever-tightening atmosphere of claustrophobia and, yes, panic.
Occasionally, he goes overboard in his fondness for computer
aided camera trickery. I mean, it's nice that the camera's free to
move through rather than around walls and furniture, but it
becomes unnecessarily distracting after a while. And is there
any reason we need to actually see the inner workings of a flash
light as it's turned on? Still, Fincher deserves credit for keeping
things visually interesting despite the unchanging setting.
All of these elements come together in one nerve-wracking,
painfully drawn out scene after another. Make no mistake —
Fincher has created an intense film, one that will demand your
undivided attention while making you squirm and jump. The
finale is a bit of a letdown, both as entertainment and as a
wrap-up of the story, but like any roller coaster, it isn't the end
ing the matters. Even if "Panic Room" doesn't lead anywhere,
it's still a fun ride.
