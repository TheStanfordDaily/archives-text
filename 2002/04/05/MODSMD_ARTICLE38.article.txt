# Holy enraged cow! It's 'Love's Fire'

### RAPHAEL GINSBURG 
Shakespeare's sonnets
have, over the years,
gained a reputation as the
ultimate love poems; for
better or worse, they are
the pinnacles of their
genre. But not many peo
ple today are familiar
with them, either because
of their intimidating sta
tus, their cryptic lan
guage or simply the pub-

lie's lack of interest in poetry; certainly, people do not
know them as well as Shakespeare's plays. "Love's
Fire" is an attempt by seven leading American play
wrights to flesh out how the sonnets are interpreted
and what they mean today, and to make some interest
ing theater while doing it; each author was given one
sonnet to be an inspiration fora play.
La Vache Enragee's recent production of five of the
one-acts, along with Tennessee Williams' short play,
"Talk to Me Like the Rain and Let Me Listen," high
lighted the richness and diversity of the sonnets, love
and contemporary American theater.
Marsha Norman's "140," a literal take on Shake
speare's description of infidelity, creates a chain of
lovers, each of whom betrays and is betrayed. Claire
Canavan and Scott Fluhrer act their parts particularly
well; in their tirades against their lovers, they are al
ternately angry, questioning, pleading and depressed,
bringing to life the mix of emotions that their charac
ters experience. Jennifer Dean's direction physically
complements the action of the play, having the actors
recite the sonnet in portions, mimicking the circular
nature of their relationships.
Tony Kushner took a less literal approach to his
interpretation, setting Sonnet 75 in the context of a
therapy session between a neurotic patient and a de-

pressed therapist. The former was played wonderfully
by Morris Naish, who reveled in his part as a quirky

gay man with a thought disor
der; the latter was equally well
done by Wendy Taylor, convinc
ing as a therapist with problems
of her own.
Ntozake Shange's "Hydraulics
Phat Like Mean" was the love-it
or-hate-it piece of the group, with
Michael Todd Clark as a suave,
horny lover circling and wooing
an African dancer in touch with
her identity, played by Rami Mar-

gon. Margon showed formidable dancing powers and
rhythm throwing her body across the stage and creating
her own beats, and the effect was hip and refreshing,

though one can't help but wonder
what Shakespeare would think.
"Bitter Sauce" is Eric Bogosian's
take on a woman who needs both
extreme sentimentality and hostility
in her life, with Jennifer Dean mem
orably playing a trashy bride who
can't decide between her square, ro
mantic fiance and her biker-gang
lover. It contained one of the
comedic high points of the night,
with Durand Ford in the role of
Red, the biker given the uncomfort
able task of reciting Sonnet 118.
John Guare brought the cycle
to a close with his "The General of
Hot Desire," which presented the
sonnets in the setting of students,
the context in which most people
know them. In showing students
struggling with what to make of
these mysteries in fourteen lines, he
highlighted not only the task of the

playwrights, but of every reader of Shakespeare.
The one disappointment of the night was the pro
duction of Williams' "Talk to Me Like the Rain and Let
Me Listen" The play, which is a miniature example of
Williams' trademark melancholy mood and escapist
themes, was corrupted by department-store-quality
piano music.
Jennifer Dean was unexciting as a Depression-era
lover who dreams of escape from New York to a simple
life on the beach where she can grow old and flee the
realities of every day life; worse, though, was Paul Men
doza's direction, which called for her to shout and cry
in the midst of describing her dream, as though she
were rejecting the dream rather than her actual life.
Anyone who has read Williams should know that a land
marked by whiteness and translucence should be an
object of desire, not one of hatred.
