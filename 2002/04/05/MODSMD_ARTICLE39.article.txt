# Another good show gets the axe
## 
### CHRIS LEE 
It's becoming damn
hard to launch a televi
sion show these days.
Fickle networks are
overeager to yank new
shows after just a few
episodes if they don't im
mediately perform well.
The result is an alarming

dearth of new programming — a situation
that forces the networks to pay increasing
ly exorbitant rates to keep producing
aging hits. "Friends," anyone?
So I guess it shouldn't be too surprising
that the show I'm writing about, UPN's
mid-season replacement "The Random
Years," has already debuted to ho-hum
numbers and been given the axe after just
three airings. This is a cutthroat industry,
after all.
I've always wondered about the kinds of
numbers that a show has to garner to get
dropped from the WB or UPN, whose
"hit" shows never even crack the top 50.
Regardless, please indulge my journalistic
ego as I attempt to sway your opinion
a*bout something that no longer matters.
"The Random Years" is about three sin
gle guys sharing a Chinatown apartment
in New York City during the "random
years" of their lives that happen right after
college. Will Friedle ("Boy Meets World")

plays Alex, an aspiring music critic who
runs an ambiguous Web site. He's joined

by his roommates
Todd (Sean Murray),
a debonair slacker
who nevertheless con
stantly has opportuni
ties falling into his lap,
and Wiseman (Joshua
Ackerman), a goof
ball dental technician.

In the pilot episode, Alex hires a temp
named Casey (the lovely Natalia Cigliuti) to
help with work on his web site. The press
release and the credits seem to indicate
that Casey eventually becomes a regular on
the show, though the pilot does nothing to
explain this.
" The Random Years" turns out to be
pretty likable. By this, I mean there's noth
ing flagrantly offensive or annoying about
it. Friedle is the immediately lovable center
of the group, but Murray and Ackerman
portray their own unique identities with
equal charm, and Cigliuti seems to rise
above her simple status as the show's
source of sex appeal. The scenes segue
with sped-up street scenes of New York,
like something straight out of a Ryan
Adams video.
So many pilots nowadays struggle to
sell and establish themselves as much as
possible with the opening episode — the
dialogue and situations seem too forced

and contrived, and viewers
are often left not so much
entertained as informed.
This show does a pretty
good job of maintaining
that balance between set
ting up the series and still
remaining interesting.
The situations in the
pilot aren't fantastic —
Alex suddenly learns that
his favorite former girl
friend has a penchant for
telling lies, Wiseman meets
a domineering woman at
the laundry place, and
Todd and Casey bond over
a session of strip "Antiques
Roadshow." But by the
end, you realize you
wouldn't mind following
up on these characters
week after week. Particu
larly considering the other
crap that usually ends up
on UPN, it's a shame that
Paramount didn't have
enough faith in its own
show to keep it around a
little longer and give it a
better chance. As it is, I
guess we'll just have to set
tle for more episodes of
"Smackdown."
