# University welcomes its neighbors
## First community day will take place on Sunday along with Founder's Day 
### HELEN KIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The first-ever Community Day, an open
house for Stanford's neighbors and residents of
adjoining towns, will be held on Sunday from
10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
This new event will be held in conjunction
with Founder's Day, an annual ceremony that
commemorates the lives of founders Jane and
Leland Stanford and their son, Leland, Jr.
"My hope is that this day will underline our
commitment to working closely with our neigh
bors to meet many of the challenges of living
and working together in the mid-Peninsula,"
said University President John Hennessy.
"It will also allow us to share information
about our community-related programs â€”
many of which may not be familiar to our
neighbors."
The idea of hosting Community Day was
first floated after the University won approval
for its general use permit from Santa Clara
County in December 2000. This permit, which

governs the University's growth lor the next 10
years, left some sour feelings among neigh
boring communities and environmentalists.
"The president hopes that Community Day
will promote partnerships and increase under
standing among and between Stanford and its
neighbors," said Assoc. Director of University
Communications Kate Chesley.
Various campus organizations, such as Stan
lord Events and Events Labor Services, helped
organize Community Day with the office of
University Communications.
However, students from the Coalition for
Labor Action are planning a protest during the
afternoon, calling for "labor justice" at Stanford
and in the Bay Area. According to an e-mail
sent by the Coalition, they are protesting to "tell
President 1 lennessy that one day is not enough
to make Stanford a good neighbor in the South
Bay" and that they want to "remind Stanford
that workers are part of the community too."
Sunday will begin with a multi-faith service
at Memorial Church focusing on the theme of
"community."
Then, at 11 a.m., various programs and ex
hibits will open throughout campus. There will
be science and research exhibits in the Science
and Engineering Quad; athletic events at the
Arrillaga Family Sports Center, Cobb Track
and Elliot Field; and art exhibits and musical

performances near the Cantor Center for Visu
al Arts.
There will also be student cultural exhibits
near the Main Quad on Serra Mall, health dis
plays and child car seat ( hecks around Encina
I lall, and a community carnival for youngsters
behind the Ford Center.
At 2:30 p.m., a procession will be led down
Palm Drive to the Mausoleum by Hennessy,
Provost John Etchemendy, Dean of Religious
Life Scotty McLennan, members of the Board
ofTrustees, faculty, staff and students, in addi
tion to the Green Street Mortuary Band and
the original Stanford 1 lorse Carriage.
The doors of the Mausoleum will then be
opened to show the interior resting place of the
Stanford family, which is clone only on
Founder's Day.
But this year, a new wrinkle is added. A time
capsule planted by Jane Stanford more than a
century ago and found last July w ill be opened
for the first time.
There was a contest held early this year to
guess the objects contained inside the copper
box.
After the contents of the time capsule are re
vealed to the public, sophomore Cody Page
and Sarah Shaw Middleton, a doctoral candi-
date in Civil and Environmental
engineering, will give speeches
about founder's day.
The event will culminate with
Hennessy's closing remarks.
"We're very grateful to all the

student groups and University of
fices that will be participating,"
Chesley said, rellecting on t lit*
campus-wide support.
"We appreciate their efforts,
and we know visitors to campus
will as well," she said. "We also
have many stall members who will
volunteer their time on April 7,
and we are deeply thankful to
them, too."
