# 'Once' and Never Ever 'Again'
## 
### RAMIN SETOODEH 
When 1 say that "Once and
Again" (ABC, Monday, 10 p.m.) is
the best show on network TV, I
am not saying it in the same vein as
those jump-on-the-bandwagon
critics who change their minds as
often as Whoopi changes gowns at
the Oscars.

"Once and Again" is a thrilling show, a charming
show, a beautifully written and acted treasure that
sparkles like only a handful of programs in the histo
ry of the small screen. And now, in its third season,
"Once and Again" is even more mature, stretching its
elbows past the original courtship between 40-some
thing single parents Rick Sammler (Billy Campbell)
and Lily Manning (Sela Ward).
The two were married (in the world of TV land, of
course) at the end of season two, and since their wed
ding, the program has worked at developing the
supporting characters.
Never before has a television show (not even "The
Wonder Years") so faithfully depicted the insecuri
ties associated with teen-age angst.
Take a glimpse at Rick's son, Eli (Shane West),
who was the star of his high school basketball team,
but suffered from a learning disability in the class
room and didn't have the test scores to get accepted
into college. Or his daughter, Jessie (the beautiful
and invaluable Evan Rachel Wood), who does have
the test scores, but is anorexic.
Now look at the adult supporting characters. Su
sanna Thompson shines as Rick's workaholic ex-wife
Karen, an attorney who is alone and ashamed and

fighting depression. The performance is so flawless,
not only does the actress deserve an Emmy, she de-

serves her own television show.
And there's a delightful
push-and-pull romance between
Lilly's sister, Judy (Marin Hinkle)
and Rick's business partner, Sam
Blue (Steven Weber).
All this, and 1 have not even
mentioned the show's strongest

point: the ability to drift into the psyches of each
character through black-and-white shots where they
openly address the camera.
My only concern is that "Once and Again" is once
again an endangered show, as it fails to get the type
of Nielsen ratings that make the studio executives go
ga-ga. It was yanked off its Friday time slot in Janu
ary and, after a few weeks on the shelf, was moved to
Monday, where viewers are more available — but the
ratings still aren't high enough to ensure the show
will escape getting cancelled in May.
The folks at ABC aren't happy. This is the same
network, mind you, that fires off promotional ads
for the inept semi-reality program "The Bache
lor" with more ferocity than a Britney Spears
Pepsi commercial.
I'm not happy either. "Once and Again" has had
seven time slots in its three-year run. What it needs
now is an advertising campaign strong enough to
show viewers what they have been missing. The rat
ings will come.
Editors' Note: Sorry, Rarnin. ABC has amiounced that
"Once and Again" will not he returning next season. It
seems those ratings won't he coming after all.
