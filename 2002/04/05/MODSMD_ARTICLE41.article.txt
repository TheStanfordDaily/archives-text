# Ben Kweller finds the things he loves
## 
### VAUHINI VARA 
Remember a band called Radish?
Probably not. We were all in early high
school when they were christened the
Next Big Thing — and so were they, ac
tually. The Dallas grunge band, led by
16-year old Ben Kweller, represented
just about every high school kid's dream
come true. While we were all daydream
ing about Rolling Stone, Radish was fea
tured in its pages. While our moms were
driving us to rock shows, Kweller was
jamming with rock stars. They were
compared to Nirvana. They were com
pared to Everclear. They were com
pared to Silverchair (how could you re
sist?). In retrospect, the hype may have
been just that: hype. But then again, it
was 1996. Kids still skateboarded.
Courtney Love was still cool. Seattle was
still Planet Hollywood-free.
So what happened?
Well, nothing, really. After an em
barrassingly intense bidding war,
Radish signed with Mercury Records.
And then . . . that was it. As is usually
true of the Next Big Thing, Radish
drowned in its own hype. Its reviews
were lukewarm, its music was passe and
its members — including Kweller —
were forgotten. Grunge rock was dying
and the infant Radish would be one of
the first casualties.
Fast-forward five years. Kweller is 20
now, has just released his debut solo

album, "Sha Sha," on Dave Matthews'
ATO Records and is touring with the
much-hyped Dashboard Confessional
and Anniversary. Half a decade later,
he's in Rolling Stone again — this time

with a three-star review that calls his
melodies "impressive" and his slight
Texan drawl "fetching." The Mar. 14
Dashboard concert he opened at the
Great American Music Hall sold out
weeks in advance.
A lot has happened between now and
1996, according to Kweller. After
Radish disappeared, he grew up,
packed up, moved to New York City
and started over the old-fashioned way:
booking his own shows from the driver's
seat of a gray Volvo, with an acoustic
guitar in his trunk.
"The difference between this and
Radish is that I'm really doing every
thing 1 want to do, and I'm running the
show, and it's all coming from some real
place instead of from some A&R guy's
desk." Is it different being on the tiny
ATO label? "So different," said Kweller.
"They give everybody complete creative
control."
Ben Kweller looks his age. He is a pre
cocious, stripy-shirted, Chris Van Dyke
like boy, and onstage, he leaps around
like a child with ADD. The sound com
ing from the speakers, though, is unde
niably grown-up.
Kweller says his influences range
from the Beatles to the Violent Femmes,
from Marvin Gaye to Weezer, from Neil
Young to Nirvana.
"I like heavy stuff, I like soft stuff, I
like ballads ... I like everything!"
Kweller laughed. "That probably comes
across in the music."
It does. "Family Tree" is so Beatles
influenced that it is almost a cliche, while
the catchy "Wasted and Ready" could
have been written by Weezer. The
album's best songs, though, are the ones
that you can't quite sort by influence. In
the end, the most authentic songs on the
album are the ones that sound least like
other artists. Songs like "How It Should
Be (Sha Sha)," "Falling," "Walk on Me"

and"In Other Words" are the ones that
you might be pointed to if you were to
ask, "What does Ben Kweller sound
like?" These songs, all deceptively
straightforward tracks, brim with the
kind of wistful joy that only sounds hon
es! coming from a 20-year old, but with a
vocal control and instrumental complex
ity that is remarkably mature — from the
cleverly placed triplets in "Falling" to
the gorgeous melody in "Walk on Me"
(that's the one with the "fetching" vo
cals). It is clear from these songs — and
from the way Kweller performs them
live — that he has a talent that puts him
several rungs above the rest of his peers.
Well, that and a refreshingly dedicat
ed fascination with playing music —
even after an early disappointment.
"From 15 to 20 years old you change
so much. You're still exploring and find
ing yourself. [Radish] was my high
school punk band. Everyone has a
garage band, but, like, mine got signed.
That's the difference. I mean, that's re
ally all it is, just growing up and finding
new things that we all love."
Once again, Kweller's living a life
that the rest of us only daydream about.
He gets to have a beautiful girlfriend
who comes on tour to sell his merchan
dise (see Lizzy). He gets to be indiffer
ent about drugs ("I don't know, I guess
1 feel like everything in moderation's
okay"). He gets to think of songs while
"fucking around in a hotel room." He
gets to have the Moldy Peaches' Kimya
Dawson sing back-np on his album, and
then he gets to say this about it: "It's so
cool to collaborate with friends. That
whole New York scene, the Strokes, the
Moldy Peaches . . . they're all great peo
ple." And he gets to make music. Really
good music.
"I just tried to make shit happen the
best I could, you know?" he says.
It's happening, Ben. It's happening.

Kweller laughed. "That probably comes
across in the music."
It does. "Family Tree" is so Beatles
influenced that it is almost a cliche, while
the catchy "Wasted and Ready" could
have been written by Weezer. The
album's best songs, though, are the ones
that you can't quite sort by influence. In
the end, the most authentic songs on the
album are the ones that sound least like
other artists. Songs like "How It Should
Be (Sha Sha)," "Falling," "Walk on Me"

and"In Other Words" are the ones that
you might be pointed to if you were to
ask, "What does Ben Kweller sound
like?" These songs, all deceptively
straightforward tracks, brim with the
kind of wistful joy that only sounds hon
es! coming from a 20-year old, but with a
vocal control and instrumental complex
ity that is remarkably mature — from the
cleverly placed triplets in "Falling" to
the gorgeous melody in "Walk on Me"
(that's the one with the "fetching" vo
cals). It is clear from these songs — and
from the way Kweller performs them
live — that he has a talent that puts him
several rungs above the rest of his peers.
Well, that and a refreshingly dedicat
ed fascination with playing music —
even after an early disappointment.
"From 15 to 20 years old you change
so much. You're still exploring and find
ing yourself. [Radish] was my high
school punk band. Everyone has a
garage band, but, like, mine got signed.
That's the difference. I mean, that's re
ally all it is, just growing up and finding
new things that we all love."
Once again, Kweller's living a life
that the rest of us only daydream about.
He gets to have a beautiful girlfriend
who comes on tour to sell his merchan
dise (see Lizzy). He gets to be indiffer
ent about drugs ("I don't know, I guess
1 feel like everything in moderation's
okay"). He gets to think of songs while
"fucking around in a hotel room." He
gets to have the Moldy Peaches' Kimya
Dawson sing back-np on his album, and
then he gets to say this about it: "It's so
cool to collaborate with friends. That
whole New York scene, the Strokes, the
Moldy Peaches . . . they're all great peo
ple." And he gets to make music. Really
good music.
"I just tried to make shit happen the
best I could, you know?" he says.
It's happening, Ben. It's happening.


Benny boy's all growed up now


Talking to Vauhini on tfie phone.
Remember a band called Radish?
Probably not. We were all in early high
school when they were christened the
Next Big Thing — and so were they, ac
tually. The Dallas grunge band, led by
16-year old Ben Kweller, represented
just about every high school kid's dream
come true. While we were all daydream
ing about Rolling Stone, Radish was fea
tured in its pages. While our moms were
driving us to rock shows, Kweller was
jamming with rock stars. They were
compared to Nirvana. They were com
pared to Everclear. They were com
pared to Silverchair (how could you re
sist?). In retrospect, the hype may have
been just that: hype. But then again, it
was 1996. Kids still skateboarded.
Courtney Love was still cool. Seattle was
still Planet Hollywood-free.
So what happened?
Well, nothing, really. After an em
barrassingly intense bidding war,
Radish signed with Mercury Records.
And then . . . that was it. As is usually
true of the Next Big Thing, Radish
drowned in its own hype. Its reviews
were lukewarm, its music was passe and
its members — including Kweller —
were forgotten. Grunge rock was dying
and the infant Radish would be one of
the first casualties.
Fast-forward five years. Kweller is 20
now, has just released his debut solo

album, "Sha Sha," on Dave Matthews'
ATO Records and is touring with the
much-hyped Dashboard Confessional
and Anniversary. Half a decade later,
he's in Rolling Stone again — this time

with a three-star review that calls his
melodies "impressive" and his slight
Texan drawl "fetching." The Mar. 14
Dashboard concert he opened at the
Great American Music Hall sold out
weeks in advance.
A lot has happened between now and
1996, according to Kweller. After
Radish disappeared, he grew up,
packed up, moved to New York City
and started over the old-fashioned way:
booking his own shows from the driver's
seat of a gray Volvo, with an acoustic
guitar in his trunk.
"The difference between this and
Radish is that I'm really doing every
thing 1 want to do, and I'm running the
show, and it's all coming from some real
place instead of from some A&R guy's
desk." Is it different being on the tiny
ATO label? "So different," said Kweller.
"They give everybody complete creative
control."
Ben Kweller looks his age. He is a pre
cocious, stripy-shirted, Chris Van Dyke
like boy, and onstage, he leaps around
like a child with ADD. The sound com
ing from the speakers, though, is unde
niably grown-up.
Kweller says his influences range
from the Beatles to the Violent Femmes,
from Marvin Gaye to Weezer, from Neil
Young to Nirvana.
"I like heavy stuff, I like soft stuff, I
like ballads ... I like everything!"
Kweller laughed. "That probably comes
across in the music."

influenced that it is almost a cliche, while
