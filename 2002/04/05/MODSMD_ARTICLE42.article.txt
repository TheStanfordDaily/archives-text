# The 						'nice guys' of modern rock
## 
### NASTASSIA LOPEZ 
Tattoos, surfing, six packs, hip hop, love
ballads and rock 'n' roll. Could you really
ask for anything more from a band? In
cubus, one of the hottest bands in the
world today, is kit king off its 50-date U.S.
tour on April 11th. When people think
"rock star," they typically think "cocaine,
STD's and late-night parties with naked
midgets covered in shaving cream." In
cubus, however, is no Led Zeppelin or
Motley Crue. In fact, they are almost uni
versally known as the "nice guys of rock."
With multi-platinum record sales, the
band, which was formed while its members
were in high school in Calabasas, Calif., are
some of the humblest and most hard
working guys in the industry. 1 spoke with
Incubus's 29 year-old I)J, Chris Kilmore,
about the band's latest album and tour.
INTERMISSION: OK, you guys made an
awesome first album. In the band's bio,
Brandon [Boyd, lead singer] explains that
you wanted the following album "Morning
View" to be more adventurous and to, "tran
scend the confinement of the studio." So you
guys got out of the studio and into a mansion
in Malibu. How did that locality make it a
much cooler creative experience?
CHRIS KILMORE: The environment real
ly affects your creative process." Being in Mal
ibu gave us more space and freedom. In the
studio, it is much more dark and you have a
lot of time constraints. Being on our own, we
had 24 hours — any time of day to work. It
was relaxing and bright. Fora band, you
have to make your first album in the studio
so that you know your space. Then, once you
get your work ethic down, you can decide
what kind of environment you need to make
a more "open" record.
INTERMISSION: Do you consider this to
be the best album vou have made?

KILMORE: Yes. No question.
INTERMISSION: What is your favorite
song on "Morning View?"
KILMORE: You know, everyone asks me
that, and it's so hard to answer because it
changes day to day. Right now I really like
"Warning."
INTERMISSION: "Warning" is your new
single at this time.
KILMORE: Yeah, that's probably why 1 like
it so much ... I've been hearing it constant
ly •
INTERMISSION: How do you think rock
stars are portrayed today? Do you guys con
sider yourself a typical rock band? What
makes you different?
KILMORE: When 1 think of rock stars, I
think of someone like Creed. The leather
pants, the pyrotechnics ... We just got back
from touring with Creed in Australia. They
are definitely rock stars. Scott [Stapp,
Creed's lead singer] is wearing those leather
pants, and they have fire shooting up every
where during their shows. I do consider [In
cubus] to be a typical band, with a twist.
We're not afraid to be creative. We're very
experimental.
INTERMISSION: What kind of instru
ments did you guys experiment with on the
new album?
KILMORE: We used a lot of strings ... We
also integrated Indian instruments, and
flutes —made it very international. [Gui
tarist] MikefEinziger] used some Chinese in
struments. ()n the song "Aqueous Transmis
sion," we tried out a pipa. It was all one step
at a time. Everytime we experimented we
were all like, "Wow. Interesting ..."
INTERMISSION: I read in a recent inter
view in Rolling Stone that you guys really
aren't the passive-aggressive band that
everyone thinks you are. You guys like the
parties, the porn, the women, except sup
posedly, for Brandon. How much do you
hate being called the "nice guys of rock?"

KILMORE: I don't mind being
called the "nice guys" at all. I'd
rather be called that than any
thing else, because the truth is
we really are nice guys. We all
like to have a good time too,
though. After the shows, we
have people back stage, get real
ly drunk, take shots, hang out.
Most of us have girlfriends, but
we all like the occasional strip
club.
INTERMISSION: A couple
months ago, you finished your
European tour. Which country
was your favorite?
KILMORE: We've toured Eu
rope six or seven times. This was
the first time we did Japan and
Australia. Portugal used to be
my favorite country, but now I
think Australia is getting up
there.
INTERMISSION: How recep
tive were the fans compared to
American fans?
KILMORE: The fans are pretty
much the same. Each time, we
play bigger and bigger places.
One of the best shows was in
Wimberley, in London. There
were about 11,000 to 12,000

people there. The best part though, is to be
in a country like Portugal, where hardly no
one speaks English, and see them singing
the words to your songs as loud as they can.
INTERMISSION: What is your favorite
part of touring?
KILMORE: Definitely playing shows and
being on stage. Sometimes you get caught
up with all the photo shoots and video
shoots and press stuff, but when you step
out on stage, that's like your home. You
look out on the crowd and see all the peo
ple that are there to see you, and it's just so
real.
INTERMISSION: What goes through
your head when you see screaming crazed
fans, especially girls, at your concerts?
KILMORE: (1 _aughs) Aw man, it's so funny
because all of those girls are therejust to see
Brandon. And 1 kinda laugh at him when
we're up there, and he gets all embarrassed
about it. Hut it's great to have your fans. It's
very reassuring.
INTERMISSION: Originally you came
from Pennsylvania, then struggled in L.A.,
and joined Incubus in 1997. In comparison
to five or six years ago, how has this rush of
fame changed your life?
KILMORE: My life is less stressful, and I'm
the least-stressed person in the band to
begin with. Before it would just be "check
to check trying to pay rent." But now I have
a car, I'm buying a house; I'm growing up.
We've finally gotten our success. And the
great thing is that it was slow. Each step
along the way made us stop and smell the
roses. We'd get our single played on
KROQ and it was like "Wow! Yeah! All
right!" And then we got a shitty-ass tour
bus, and we'd be excited about that. And
then "Make Yourself' [the band's debut
album] came out. Each step takes you fur
ther. And I appreciate how it all came about
because we could have been like those one
hit wonders where it all comes really fast,
and then leaves. We've worked hard and
been able to appreciate all the little things
that have come with the success.
INTERMISSION: You had said that your
work is all about texture, not hip-hop.
What is the difference?
KILMORE: Where did you hear that?
INTERMISSION: Spin Magazine.
KILMORE: Man, that's bullshit. Hip-hop
is me. I am the epitome of hip-hop. I love
the textures and scratching, but there is a

time and a place for it. Most DJs just come
in with their own style and fit the music to
what they know. I try to find my niche. I am
always experimenting and making my
turntabling fit the sound, while creating
new sounds too.
INTERMISSION: What bands have really
influenced your style or sound?
KILMORE: Public Enemy. They took dif
ferent sounds and rock samples and mixed
them together. Chuck I) and Flavor Flav
were conscious and powerful. They took
the responsibility to back up everything
they said. 1 was really influenced by their
lyrics and their music. Like I was saying, the
newer s today mimic the videos they see,
and then there's no new or creative ideas to
help the art of" DJing. That's why 1 love
making my own sounds
INTERMISSION: Any thoughts on the le
galization of marijuana?
KILMORE: That shit should be legalized.
It is not a crime. If you want to smoke out
with some of your friends or do it on your
own time, 1 see no problem with it. 1 do
think there should be some rules when you
use it,just like with alcohol, but if you're not
offending anyone when you use it, it's not
such a big deal.
INTERMISSION: What bands are you
guys really into now?
KILMORE: Well, we've been out of the
country since January, so I really haven't
had a chance to hear anything new. 1 like
the Strokes and the Hives, but I'm also into
Indian music like Shashila Raymond. A lot
ofsitars and tablas. I guess myjob is to listen
to really weird music so that I can bring new
sound to the band.
INTERMISSION: Anything you have to
say to people at Stanford who don't know
you?
KILMORE: You're in fora surprise. We're
a very diverse group. We're hard and heavy
and melodic and basic, if you can under
stand that. We go in between and outside of
that. At our concerts we have a very giant
mix of people ... But you also have those
moments during our concerts with the
lighters and everyone singing along. "Di
versity" is definitely the word though.
Incubus will be playing the San Jose Event
Center Arena on April 14, the Arco Arena
in Sacramento on April 15, and the Bill
Graham Civic Auditorium on April 16.


That shit should be legalized!
