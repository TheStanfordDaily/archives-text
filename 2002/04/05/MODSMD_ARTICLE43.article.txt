# Richter controls your television
## 
### DAVID WELD 
Actor, writer and comedian Andy Richter achieved
his first big success as Conan O'Brien's sidekick on the
incomparable "Late Night With Conan O'Brien."
Since leaving the show in the spring of 2000, he has
appeared in several movies, including Robert Alt
man's "Dr. T and the Women" and the upcoming en
semble comedy "Big Trouble." He now has his own
show, "Andy Richter Controls the Universe," which
appears Tuesday nights on Fox.
INTERMISSION: How sick are you of hearing the
"Conan O'Brien's Sidekick" tag?
ANDY RICHTER:WeII, "second banana" bothers me,
'cause 1 just think that's a really stupid phrase. But
"Conan O'Brien's Sidekick" 1 don't have any problem
with, because it's something I'm very proud of. I fully
expect for the rest of my life to be referred to as
"Conan O'Brien's Sidekick," and I'm absolutely fine
with that.
INTERMISSION: Has anything surprised you about
switching from the sitcom format from talk shows?
RICHTER: 1 thought the money would come in
wheelbarrows. It comes in paper bags. No, actually
one thing I was surprised by, although I shouldn't
have been, was that — well, I'm extremely proud of
the work I did with the Conan show, and I feel like I
made real contributions to the comedic character of
the show, but when 1 came out here I realized that no
body knows that at all! They just think I'm the guy
that sits on the couch. Maybe that's why a lot of peo
ple were so angry when I left, 'cause it seems like I
had the ultimate lazy slob's job, you know — get paid
money to just sit on a couch.
INTERMISSION: Who came up with the title "Andy
Richter Controls the Universe"?
RICHTER: Me. The show was originally called "Any
thing Can Happen," but we always knew we were
gonna change that. It sounds like a game show. I just
wanted the title to be something that would be kind of
snotty, and that you couldn't possibly take seriously.
Also, because there are so many other people who

have so much more power
over the show than I do, it's
kind of my own private joke
with myself, as far as what I
actually do control. Which is,
at this point, possibly my own
urine stream.
INTERMISSION: What was
your reason for deciding to
do this show?
RICHTER: Well, I liked the
gimmick of it. I liked the
concept of a show that's nar
rated by a guy, and you see
the whole show from his
point of view. A very subjec
tive point of view, which
would include fantasy. And I
liked that, because I had
been pitched so many ideas
like, you know, "you're a
heart surgeon, in a Krazy
Hospital," that were so de
pendent upon the situation.
The "sit" in sitcom. This
show isn't like that. Also, this
show has a gimmick that al
lows you to do a lot of sketch
comedy, which appealed to
me as a nice segue from what
I'd been doing.
INTERMISSION: Have you
had a lot of artistic freedom
with this show?
RICHTER: Yeah, pretty
much. I mean, as far as artis
tic freedom on prime-time
television goes. Anytime
you're gonna provide enter
tainment, the larger the
number gets, the less person-

al it gets. Like if you're performing for 10 people, you
can make inside jokes, and pretty much do what you

want, because what are the stakes? You get to
know the people. But when you're doing it for
millions of people, you've got to really cast a
wide net. Which is the reason why, 1 think, the
Conan show at 12:30 is 10 times more interest
ing than the 1 1:30 shows — because there's less
people watching. You don't have to satisfy as
many people — we were sort of a specialty act,
compared to Dave or Jay. Those guys are mak
ing all of America happy, whereas we were just
making insomniacs and people in prison happy.
INTERMISSION: What are some things that set
this new show apart?
RICHTER: The fantastic presence of me. Um . .
. that's pretty much it. Other than that, it's a rip
off of about eight different shows.
INTERMISSION: How do you like living in
California?
RICHTER: The weather's really nice. It's a per
fectly fine place to live, but I really miss New
York City. It's not California's fault. But there
are some times when it's hard. We live in a beau
tiful area, right by this beach; it's very safe and
it's very clean and sometimes it makes me want
to scream.
INTERMISSION: Do you think you would ever
consider doing a talk show again, maybe as the host?
RICHTER: Sitting here right now, 1 would say
no. That's an awful lot of work, doing a daily
show like that. There are things about that for
mat that are really great, like the immediacy —
you come up with something, and five hours
later it's on TV. That's really amazing, and
you're working with a really great group of peo
ple to churn out this stuff. . . But I don't miss
working in front of a studio audience. I don't

miss topical humor, you know, like doing jokes about
Jennifer Lopez' butt, or about Monica Lewinsky.
When you do that kind of show, you really need to do
that kind of comedy, and it's just not to my taste. 1
don't even think it's to Conan's taste. When the
Conan show started, we all had this high-minded no
tion that we weren't gonna do topical humor, that we
were above it. But as soon as we realized how much
work it all was, we were like "oh, please, Michael Jack
son, do something; give us something to write about."
That's when you realize that topical humor is your
best friend.
INTERMISSION: l)o you have any advice for aspir
ing comedians?
RICHTER: Yeah ... Its hard, because comedian
means so many different things. I'd say try and have a
little integrity. Even if you're doing fart jokes, you can
do 'em with integrity or without integrity.
INTERMISSION: You have a baby son — has he
shown any comic tendencies?
RICHTER: Yeah, my wife and I think he's hilarious.
Babies are sort of natural clowns, 'cause they're so ill
equipped to handle things. They can't walk real well;
they're kind of like little drunks, you know? They fall
down a lot, they make funny faces, they have inap
propriate responses to things . . .
INTERMISSION: If you had your choice right now
between a career in television or a career in the
movies, which one would you choose?
RICHTER: If 1 had to pick just one, it would be the
movies, because . . . it's like joining the circus, you
know? You get to travel around in little houses on
wheels, and things get blown up, and there are ani
mals and special effects ... I never get over the ex
citement of just being on a film set, especially on loca
tion. You bring in this whole little world and set it up
and light it and shoot it, and then you just pack it up
and take it away.

that sits on the couch. Maybe that's why a lot of peo
ple were so angry when I left, 'cause it seems like I
had the ultimate lazy slob's job, you know — get paid
money to just sit on a couch.
INTERMISSION: Who came up with the title "Andy
Richter Controls the Universe"?
RICHTER: Me. The show was originally called "Any
thing Can Happen," but we always knew we were
gonna change that. It sounds like a game show. I just
wanted the title to be something that would be kind of
snotty, and that you couldn't possibly take seriously.
Also, because there are so many other people who

have so much more power
over the show than I do, it's
kind of my own private joke
with myself, as far as what I
actually do control. Which is,
at this point, possibly my own
urine stream.
INTERMISSION: What was
your reason for deciding to
do this show?
RICHTER: Well, I liked the
gimmick of it. I liked the
concept of a show that's nar
rated by a guy, and you see
the whole show from his
point of view. A very subjec
tive point of view, which
would include fantasy. And I
liked that, because I had
been pitched so many ideas
like, you know, "you're a
heart surgeon, in a Krazy
Hospital," that were so de
pendent upon the situation.
The "sit" in sitcom. This
show isn't like that. Also, this
show has a gimmick that al
lows you to do a lot of sketch
comedy, which appealed to
me as a nice segue from what
I'd been doing.
INTERMISSION: Have you
had a lot of artistic freedom
with this show?
RICHTER: Yeah, pretty
much. I mean, as far as artis
tic freedom on prime-time
television goes. Anytime
you're gonna provide enter
tainment, the larger the
number gets, the less person-

al it gets. Like if you're performing for 10 people, you
can make inside jokes, and pretty much do what you

want, because what are the stakes? You get to
know the people. But when you're doing it for
millions of people, you've got to really cast a
wide net. Which is the reason why, 1 think, the
Conan show at 12:30 is 10 times more interest
ing than the 1 1:30 shows — because there's less
people watching. You don't have to satisfy as
many people — we were sort of a specialty act,
compared to Dave or Jay. Those guys are mak
ing all of America happy, whereas we were just
making insomniacs and people in prison happy.
INTERMISSION: What are some things that set
this new show apart?
RICHTER: The fantastic presence of me. Um . .
. that's pretty much it. Other than that, it's a rip
off of about eight different shows.
INTERMISSION: How do you like living in
California?
RICHTER: The weather's really nice. It's a per
fectly fine place to live, but I really miss New
York City. It's not California's fault. But there
are some times when it's hard. We live in a beau
tiful area, right by this beach; it's very safe and
it's very clean and sometimes it makes me want
to scream.
INTERMISSION: Do you think you would ever
consider doing a talk show again, maybe as the host?
RICHTER: Sitting here right now, 1 would say
no. That's an awful lot of work, doing a daily
show like that. There are things about that for
mat that are really great, like the immediacy —
you come up with something, and five hours
later it's on TV. That's really amazing, and
you're working with a really great group of peo
ple to churn out this stuff. . . But I don't miss
working in front of a studio audience. I don't

miss topical humor, you know, like doing jokes about
Jennifer Lopez' butt, or about Monica Lewinsky.
When you do that kind of show, you really need to do
that kind of comedy, and it's just not to my taste. 1
don't even think it's to Conan's taste. When the
Conan show started, we all had this high-minded no
tion that we weren't gonna do topical humor, that we
were above it. But as soon as we realized how much
work it all was, we were like "oh, please, Michael Jack
son, do something; give us something to write about."
That's when you realize that topical humor is your
best friend.
INTERMISSION: l)o you have any advice for aspir
ing comedians?
RICHTER: Yeah ... Its hard, because comedian
means so many different things. I'd say try and have a
little integrity. Even if you're doing fart jokes, you can
do 'em with integrity or without integrity.
INTERMISSION: You have a baby son — has he
shown any comic tendencies?
RICHTER: Yeah, my wife and I think he's hilarious.
Babies are sort of natural clowns, 'cause they're so ill
equipped to handle things. They can't walk real well;
they're kind of like little drunks, you know? They fall
down a lot, they make funny faces, they have inap
propriate responses to things . . .
INTERMISSION: If you had your choice right now
between a career in television or a career in the
movies, which one would you choose?
RICHTER: If 1 had to pick just one, it would be the
movies, because . . . it's like joining the circus, you
know? You get to travel around in little houses on
wheels, and things get blown up, and there are ani
mals and special effects ... I never get over the ex
citement of just being on a film set, especially on loca
tion. You bring in this whole little world and set it up
and light it and shoot it, and then you just pack it up
and take it away.


No longer playing second fiddle


"All right. .. who cut the Provolone?"
Actor, writer and comedian Andy Richter achieved
his first big success as Conan O'Brien's sidekick on the
incomparable "Late Night With Conan O'Brien."
Since leaving the show in the spring of 2000, he has
appeared in several movies, including Robert Alt
man's "Dr. T and the Women" and the upcoming en
semble comedy "Big Trouble." He now has his own
show, "Andy Richter Controls the Universe," which
appears Tuesday nights on Fox.
INTERMISSION: How sick are you of hearing the
"Conan O'Brien's Sidekick" tag?
ANDY RICHTER:WeII, "second banana" bothers me,
'cause 1 just think that's a really stupid phrase. But
"Conan O'Brien's Sidekick" 1 don't have any problem
with, because it's something I'm very proud of. I fully
expect for the rest of my life to be referred to as
"Conan O'Brien's Sidekick," and I'm absolutely fine
with that.
INTERMISSION: Has anything surprised you about
switching from the sitcom format from talk shows?
RICHTER: 1 thought the money would come in
wheelbarrows. It comes in paper bags. No, actually
one thing I was surprised by, although I shouldn't
have been, was that — well, I'm extremely proud of
the work I did with the Conan show, and I feel like I
made real contributions to the comedic character of
the show, but when 1 came out here I realized that no
body knows that at all! They just think I'm the guy
that sits on the couch. Maybe that's why a lot of peo
