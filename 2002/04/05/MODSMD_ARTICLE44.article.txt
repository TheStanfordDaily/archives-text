# A 						little bit of 'Something' Less

### SERENA LAUREN BLODGER 
Ginny Owens, the
winner of the 2000 New
Artist of the Year Dove
Award, released her
sophomore album
"Something More" on
March 19. Reviews of
Ginny's first album,

"Without Condition," praised her sound
with several of them comparing her to the
likes of Sarah McLachlan and Fiona Apple.
One question: What in the world hap
pened on her second album?
Ginny, now 26, describes her new
album as similar to the first, but not quite as
organic. Quite an understatement! After
listening to several songs from "Without
Condition," such as "Symbol of A Lost
Cause," "Own Me" and "Without Condi
tion," there are definite hints of the pas
sionate, soulful voices of Sarah and Fiona,
as well as some beautiful string instrumen
tation. Unfortunately, the "organic" quali
ty of "Without Condition" is nearly vacant
on "Something More."
In other words, Ginny Owens now
sounds like a cross between Mandy Moore
and the very popular Norwegian pop

group, M2M. The deep, emotional piano
and drum lines of "Own Me" and "Some-

thing More" have been
replaced by pulsating
dance beats and a voice
that seems more airy and
childish, perhaps re
pressed by the pressures
of today's secular pop
scene. Mind you, the two

very talented members of M2M are 16
and 17.
Aside from the shift in sound between
the two albums, "Something More" is still a
decent album. Halfway through, Ginny re
gains an organic feel as the computerized
drumbeats fade and the piano takes on a
stronger role. "Something More" and
"This Hand" could compete with any song
currently being playing on pop radio. The
song "Simply Love You" is one of those
"happy tearful" songs that can make tears
fall faster or smiles grow bigger ("I just
wanna love you / Simply love you / They
way it used to be / When your love was new
to me.") The last song on the album "Be
Still, My Soul" contains a very moving vio
lin track with a similar sound to the
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon
Soundtrack," although the song itself is not

incredibly dynamic.
The first four songs on the
album, including the catchy
"With Me" ("I'lie good days
come / Fhe dark days call / But
every day you're with me, with
me through it all /1 will em
brace what every moment
brings / Cause you are with
me") will undoubtedly be mem
orized by nearly every church
attending pre-teen in the na
tion. By the way, the Dove
Awards are specifically for
Christian Music. Ginny may
very well be the favorite singer
of these pre-teens for quite
some time.
However, if parents can sub
stitute for Britney Spears with a
singer that writes such positive
lyrics as the ones from "With
Me," and get away with it, any

regression in musical quality is more than
welcome. In fact, 1 myself will throw a big
party for that regression. There will be
three levels and two dance rooms, one will
be playing "Plus One" (of course) and
there will be plenty of dairy-free dessert to
go around.

So, if you have a pre-teen sibling with a
birthday coming up, grab a copy of "Some
thing More," and send some purely posi
tive messages and catchy tunes their way!
Hint: Try sticking the CD in a Mandy
Moore cover because they might not know
the difference.
