# Daashuur shows remarkable talent
## 
### MICHAEL BAER 
After spinning a dozen or so
mediocre discs, it's always a dis
tinct pleasure to come across
something that is truly enjoyable,
even if it isn't exactly ground
breaking. Aja Daashuur's debut
album, "Before the Beginning"
qualifies. With thoughtful lyrics
and joyful music, Daashuur

makes a solid album the first time out, no doubt partly due to
a posse of veteran musicians and producers, but also due to
the quality of her self-penned songs. Only 21, she's already at
the level of, if not better than, fellow wunderkinds Jewel and
Fiona Apple.

mother and American father, Aja, like Alicia Keys, has synthe
sized a variety of genres (with the help of her musical collabo-

rators) into her own style. Granted, sometimes the
album sounds a little too slicked down by produc
ers or a little too '90s; Natalie Imbruglia jumps out
as a reference ("Tremble," which actually would be
an improvement on Imbruglia), and there is also a
trace of Ani DiFranco in "Stronger Now."
Nevertheless "Before" is more solid a piece
of work than one has any right to expect from
someone of her age. Among the studio vets help-

ing her in this are session drummers Matt Chamberlain and
Vinnie Coliauta, each with impressive resumes of their own,
and song producer Eric Rosse, best known as'fori Amos' pro
ducer for her first two solo albums.
Aja Daashuur has the same deft combination of warmth
and bite as Tori Amos did, although, being younger, not to
quite the same extent. And with more straightforward lyrics,
it's easier for Aja to fall into cliche, but never overly so. The
chorus of the talky yet catchy and flowing "You Promised"
goes, "I said, 'You promised to be real,' and then you lied /
You said, 'I never made a promise,' and then I sighed /1 said,
'You promised me love,' and then you smiled / You said, 'I
never made a promise,' and then 1 cried." This is one of the
most notable cliches on the album, but it isn't too bad, and, in
the context, it actually works.
"Wearing Maybelline" is another song with music that gets
stuck in one's head in spite of the fact that its anti-consumerist
barbs were passe before Aja even entered adulthood.
"Shadow of the Saints," the starter, is more representative
of the louder songs, a '90s spiritually-influenced female an
them that nevertheless captures (and is worthy of) the listen
er's attention, "Walking in the shadows of the saints / Can't live
up to the visions that they paint/ An idol's life is hard to twist
and bend / But hopefully there will be a happy end."
And "Tremble," the only song with co-authors and a seem
ing attempt at a single, provides a positive, lovely and buoyant
ending, as she joyously tells the song's subject, "Baby you
make me tremble inside." In between, there are a dozen songs
that range from quiet longing to defiance, each influenced by
the mixing of genres that has become a hallmark of the best

music of the last decade.
In spite of the slightly derivative nature of "Before the Be
ginning," Aja has more originality in her little finger than one
can find in most of the "artists" currently on radio, so it would
indeed be (]iiite an improvement if the beautiful songs of Aja
Daashuur found themselves on the airwaves. It would also be
an improvement to a CD collection to add this disc, and she's
definitely one to watch for the future.
