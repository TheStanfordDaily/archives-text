# Alumna takes on NYC folk scene
## 
### MICHAEL BAER 
Jennifer Lindsay, Stanford Class of
2001, is currently back on-campus for
An Art Affair. After graduating, she
made herself a part of the New York
City folk-singer scene. She performed at
the Coffee House on Wednesday night
and, tonight, will be performing at An
Art Affair at 8:00 p.m. and Donner at
10:00 p.m. Since many readers may not
have heard of this singer / songwriter, I
asked her a few questions to let Stanford
circa 2002 know what she's all about.
INTERMISSION: What is the first
thing people should know about you?
JENN LINDSAY: The first thing is that
my music has been described by myself
and others as percussive folk with a po
litical edge. 1 think that as a folk singer
it is important to me, the more I go out
into the world, to try to broaden my ma
terial. I think there's so much more to
write about than emotional experiences,
and the folk singer's role is to be a sto
ryteller and a communicator with audi
ences. I think that maybe it's a luxury to
really connect with someone on a really
intense or personal level. But 1 think as
a performer, it's important to be com
municating, being personal and sincere
and open.
INTERMISSION: When you're with an
audience, though, it may be difficult to
perceive how you're connecting; how do
you deal with that?
LINDSAY: 1 talk a lot with people about
what it's like to be in front of an audience
that's giving back, or what I'm getting
back from an audience, and usually it
conies down to a simple matter of pres
ence. 1 feel there's so much stigma about
openness; I think that, potentially every
one has the same story, everyone has the
same fears and the same dangers about

them. As a performer it's my responsibil
ity to put that stuff on the table and hope
that people respond. If they don't then
it's just a matter of me committing to my
self on stage and being there for myself.
That's scary, but that's part of the deal,
because you never know whether people
will be with you or not.
INTERMISSION: So, of the things you
sing about, what do you think holds the
biggest stigma?
LINDSAY: 1 address domestic violence
quite a bit, and 1 think that makes a lot
of people uncomfortable, as I write
about not only myself, but about friends
I have or people that I've met. But often
I find that if I sit down with someone
and say, "Hey this is my story," I will
find that they have the same story and
that's a point of connecting.
INTERMISSION: Do you have any big
influences, that a person would think,
"Hmm, she sounds a lot 1ike...."
LINDSAY: . . . Ani DiFranco?
INTERMISSION: Yeah, that's a stereo
type of a lot of indie folk women.
LINDSAY: Yeah, I've heard of lot of
"sounds like a combo between Ani
DiFranco and Joni Mitchell," "Ani
DiFranco and Sarah McLachlan," "Ani
DiFranco and Jewel." I think people see
a strong, politically-inclined woman on
stage and that's the immediate associa
tion. All this and the leftist angle cause
people to compare me to Ani DiFranco,
but I think we sound super-different.
I've got a brighter voice, for one. But
I've really tried to let everything be an
influence, even comments in public
places and such.
People laud originality so much, but I
don't know if it's even a possibility any
more to be truly original, so it's important
to have to be open to influences. You
have to learn what works in others' story
telling and sounds. As long as you're com

ing from an honest place from within
yourself, 1 think it's valid. I think most
people's problems are universal, with
their own specific context, but there's an
incredible potential for people to re
spond "me too," so if you're honest, writ
ing for yourself will work for others.
INTERMISSION: What do you identify as?
LINDSAY: First, I write as a woman.
Gender informs one's entire experi
ence, but my music in particular. I grew
up in a conservative family, and, as
someone of different opinions, I needed
to assert myself. And I'm a feminist and
I take that seriously, but you have to
able to joke about stuff; people take
themselves too seriously. I have some
funnier songs. Folk singers can be real
ly goofy, even sloppy.
INTERMISSION: What area of New
York are you in?
LINDSAY: I m in Brooklyn and I had a
steady gig in Manhattan, but that build
ing doesn't exist anymore, so I've had to
start over. East Village is where I most
ly play. I think living in New York is a
huge compromise between paying enor
mous rent fora place you rarely visit,
and the exposure and growth you en
counter in New York. Every day you
meet someone who humbles you. It's
also a matter of community. I've been
super-lucky to have supportive fans and
crew at Stanford, and the support I've
garnered here gives me hope that I
might be able to build something sus
tainable there.
In some ways, though, I've felt Stan
ford was very frustrating, that people
sacrifice themselves. But the people
here are so creative and bright and im
press me. Most places, there are people
who get it and some people who don't.
Here, most do.
Still, I've been recognizing that on
the Stanford campus there is a case of

myopic liberalism where people start
thinking that liberal is the only way to
be. I found my very first rejection of
that when 1 got back from New York at
the beginning of October after seeing
crazy shit, like I saw a finger on the
ground and people crying on the sub
ways and people just terrified. New
York is so changed now. After being in
the middle of that, I came back here
where the kids from the co-op were
protesting, saying, "Make love, not
war." And I have been with those kids
all the time, out there shouting,
"Peace!" but suddenly I just felt there
was no sense of the privilege of being
able to be out in the California sunshine
and this beautiful weather and saying,
"Make love, not war." If they had been
breathing in ashes and human bodies,
would they be saying that? 1 think it's
really complicated and we can't reduce
it to "Make love, not war."
I saw some crazy stuff in New York
and it's really been in my head and I'm
trying to work it out on paper because
that's the way I work out things. I wrote
a ballad about what went on there, and
it essentially says that there aren't any
words. How can I put creation upon de
struction?
INTERMISSION: For some people,
tragedy shuts off instead of inspires.
LINDSAY: It is really crippling. How
can I help people by getting up and
singing? But I think now more than
ever people are searching for answers
and for different perspectives. While I
feel that nationalism doesn't necessar
ily mean supporting George Bush, it
does mean trying to get in touch with
the original ideals of the country, no
tions of freedom and solidarity and
personal pursuit. I do the best I can,
but I don't pretend to be an authorita
tive perspective.

a performer, it's important to be com
municating, being personal and sincere
and open.
INTERMISSION: When you're with an
audience, though, it may be difficult to
perceive how you're connecting; how do
you deal with that?
LINDSAY: 1 talk a lot with people about
what it's like to be in front of an audience
that's giving back, or what I'm getting
back from an audience, and usually it
conies down to a simple matter of pres
ence. 1 feel there's so much stigma about
openness; I think that, potentially every
one has the same story, everyone has the
same fears and the same dangers about

them. As a performer it's my responsibil
ity to put that stuff on the table and hope
that people respond. If they don't then
it's just a matter of me committing to my
self on stage and being there for myself.
That's scary, but that's part of the deal,
because you never know whether people
will be with you or not.
INTERMISSION: So, of the things you
sing about, what do you think holds the
biggest stigma?
LINDSAY: 1 address domestic violence
quite a bit, and 1 think that makes a lot
of people uncomfortable, as I write
about not only myself, but about friends
I have or people that I've met. But often
I find that if I sit down with someone
and say, "Hey this is my story," I will
find that they have the same story and
that's a point of connecting.
INTERMISSION: Do you have any big
influences, that a person would think,
"Hmm, she sounds a lot 1ike...."
LINDSAY: . . . Ani DiFranco?
INTERMISSION: Yeah, that's a stereo
type of a lot of indie folk women.
LINDSAY: Yeah, I've heard of lot of
"sounds like a combo between Ani
DiFranco and Joni Mitchell," "Ani
DiFranco and Sarah McLachlan," "Ani
DiFranco and Jewel." I think people see
a strong, politically-inclined woman on
stage and that's the immediate associa
tion. All this and the leftist angle cause
people to compare me to Ani DiFranco,
but I think we sound super-different.
I've got a brighter voice, for one. But
I've really tried to let everything be an
influence, even comments in public
places and such.
People laud originality so much, but I
don't know if it's even a possibility any
more to be truly original, so it's important
to have to be open to influences. You
have to learn what works in others' story
telling and sounds. As long as you're com

ing from an honest place from within
yourself, 1 think it's valid. I think most
people's problems are universal, with
their own specific context, but there's an
incredible potential for people to re
spond "me too," so if you're honest, writ
ing for yourself will work for others.
INTERMISSION: What do you identify as?
LINDSAY: First, I write as a woman.
Gender informs one's entire experi
ence, but my music in particular. I grew
up in a conservative family, and, as
someone of different opinions, I needed
to assert myself. And I'm a feminist and
I take that seriously, but you have to
able to joke about stuff; people take
themselves too seriously. I have some
funnier songs. Folk singers can be real
ly goofy, even sloppy.
INTERMISSION: What area of New
York are you in?
LINDSAY: I m in Brooklyn and I had a
steady gig in Manhattan, but that build
ing doesn't exist anymore, so I've had to
start over. East Village is where I most
ly play. I think living in New York is a
huge compromise between paying enor
mous rent fora place you rarely visit,
and the exposure and growth you en
counter in New York. Every day you
meet someone who humbles you. It's
also a matter of community. I've been
super-lucky to have supportive fans and
crew at Stanford, and the support I've
garnered here gives me hope that I
might be able to build something sus
tainable there.
In some ways, though, I've felt Stan
ford was very frustrating, that people
sacrifice themselves. But the people
here are so creative and bright and im
press me. Most places, there are people
who get it and some people who don't.
Here, most do.
Still, I've been recognizing that on
the Stanford campus there is a case of

myopic liberalism where people start
thinking that liberal is the only way to
be. I found my very first rejection of
that when 1 got back from New York at
the beginning of October after seeing
crazy shit, like I saw a finger on the
ground and people crying on the sub
ways and people just terrified. New
York is so changed now. After being in
the middle of that, I came back here
where the kids from the co-op were
protesting, saying, "Make love, not
war." And I have been with those kids
all the time, out there shouting,
"Peace!" but suddenly I just felt there
was no sense of the privilege of being
able to be out in the California sunshine
and this beautiful weather and saying,
"Make love, not war." If they had been
breathing in ashes and human bodies,
would they be saying that? 1 think it's
really complicated and we can't reduce
it to "Make love, not war."
I saw some crazy stuff in New York
and it's really been in my head and I'm
trying to work it out on paper because
that's the way I work out things. I wrote
a ballad about what went on there, and
it essentially says that there aren't any
words. How can I put creation upon de
struction?
INTERMISSION: For some people,
tragedy shuts off instead of inspires.
LINDSAY: It is really crippling. How
can I help people by getting up and
singing? But I think now more than
ever people are searching for answers
and for different perspectives. While I
feel that nationalism doesn't necessar
ily mean supporting George Bush, it
does mean trying to get in touch with
the original ideals of the country, no
tions of freedom and solidarity and
personal pursuit. I do the best I can,
but I don't pretend to be an authorita
tive perspective.
Jennifer Lindsay, Stanford Class of
2001, is currently back on-campus for
An Art Affair. After graduating, she
made herself a part of the New York
City folk-singer scene. She performed at
the Coffee House on Wednesday night
and, tonight, will be performing at An
Art Affair at 8:00 p.m. and Donner at
10:00 p.m. Since many readers may not
have heard of this singer / songwriter, I
asked her a few questions to let Stanford
circa 2002 know what she's all about.
INTERMISSION: What is the first
thing people should know about you?
JENN LINDSAY: The first thing is that
my music has been described by myself
and others as percussive folk with a po
litical edge. 1 think that as a folk singer
it is important to me, the more I go out
into the world, to try to broaden my ma
terial. I think there's so much more to
write about than emotional experiences,
and the folk singer's role is to be a sto
ryteller and a communicator with audi
ences. I think that maybe it's a luxury to
really connect with someone on a really
intense or personal level. But 1 think as
a performer, it's important to be com
municating, being personal and sincere
and open.
