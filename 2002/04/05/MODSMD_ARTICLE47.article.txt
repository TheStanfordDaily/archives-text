### TIFFANY LEE 
Performed in the
style of 1950s and
1960s pulp novel,
Lavender Lockeroom
focuses on the coming
out of a young man
into the gay communi-

ty, and the trials he
faces in the process. F. Allen Sawyer tries to
reclaim the gay pulp novel with humor and
sexuality.
I'he style of the play is refreshingly mini
malist. The scenery, consisting of a few
chairs and odd end props, is sparse leaving
a lot to the viewer's imagination and focus
ing the viewer's attention on the acting. The
acting is generally good, though a bit exag
gerated. I en joyed the female / male role re
versals that happened occasionally, with a
woman playing the part of a father and a
man playing the part of his / her wife. This
reversal added comedy and humor to the
play as a whole.
Also enjoyable is the overly ridiculous

storyline, which adds comic aspects to the
play. The story's dysfunctional family, al-

though very disturbing, is so ab
surd as to be slightly amusing.
The main character's bisexual sis
ter walks around the house sup
posedly skimpily clad and the
mother tries to "turn" her homo
sexual stepson straight, offering

herself as an example. Although
somewhat troublesome to think about,
these unpleasant characters leave a lot of
room open for comedy.
One of the problems with the play, how
ever, is the tone the playwright occasionally
uses. There is a sense of didacticism, as if
the playwright is telling the viewer the right
or wrong way to treat gay people and the
right or wrong way to be gay. At times, this
became rather offensive. For example, the
play violently denounces those who were
gay and refused to admit it to the world,
going so far as to paint the villain as a gay
who is "in the closet." The ironic aspect of
the play, however, is that the "heroes" of
the play are also, in some sense, "in the clos-

et," leaving the audience a bit con
fused as to what the playwright is
trying to laud and what he is trying
to denounce.
The play also overemphasizes
sexuality and sex scenes. Given that
no clothes came off and nothing was
revealed, the implication and imita
tion of sex and groping was
nonetheless detracting as a whole
and added very little if anything at
all to the play itself. In fact, the over
played sex was perhaps the biggest
problem I had with the play because
it seemed so unnecessary and in
many ways ridiculous. There are
more than a few scenes where one
person has his head buried in the
groin of another, and all this exces
sive pretending, although it did
have a purpose, was unnecessary
after the first time. The play ends
with an org)' scene among a bunch
of gay men that I felt was unneces
sarily drawn out, although most
likely necessary for the play itself.
