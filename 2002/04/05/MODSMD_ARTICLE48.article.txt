# A 						sometimes bland 'little pill'

### KIM SAMEK 
She was only 21 when her
"debut" record, "Jagged Little
Pill," came out. The album,
which sold 28 million copies
worldwide, was not actually her
first release. No foreigner to the
entertainment industry, Alanis
Morissette began her career on
Nickelodeon's "You Can't Do

That On Television." She released a pop album at age 14
which went platinum. Her subsequent releases, however,
did not fare so well.
At this point, she moved to L.A. and hooked up with
songwriter / producer Glen Ballard, who encouraged her

Alanis Morissette
"Under Rug Swept"
Maverick Records (Jt
irkir£r£z

to bring out her darker side in music. The result was
"Jagged Little Pill." Morissette emerged as an angry chick

rocker, famous for her scathing lyrics — her '80s
pop star image (and yes, she had the bangs,
frizzy hair and probably owned a crimper) al
most entirely forgotten.
"Under Rug Swept," which debuted at No.
lin 12 countries last week, features similar song
writing to that of"Jagged Little Pill." Written and
produced by Morissette this time around,
"Under Rug Swept" contains at least a few sure

hits in tracks like "Hands Clean" and "Precious Illusions."
The lyrics are a little less angry, as she has transformed
from an emotionally mature young woman to a wiser, more
pensive songwriter. Much of this album is comprised of bal
lads, which musically are quite similar. "Under Rug Swept"
begins with a harder rock song called "21 Things" followed
up by the most unique sounding song, "Narcissus," and the
catchy single "Hands Clean." The album gets tiring about
halfway through, when the songs start to move too much at
the same pace.
The most interesting aspect of the album is the stories
told by Morissette's lyrics, which although not terribly in
novative, narrate her life in an admirably honest way. Her
new lyrics focus on themes from her past, revealing her
deepest secrets.
The first single, "Hands Clean," which can currently be
heard all over pop / modern rock radio, is written in the for
mat of a conversation between her and her ex-lover from
when she was 14-18 years old and just getting started in the
industry. In the lyrics, the former lover says to her, " You're
essentially an employee / and I like having you depend on
me / you're kind of a protege / and one day you'll say you 1
earned all you know from me /1 know you depend on me /
like a young thing would to a guardian /1 know you sexual
ize me / like a young thing would and I think I like it."
Her lover was 15 years older than her — rumor has it, an
industry executive who contributed to her success. Ten
years later, she has finally begun speaking about the experi
ence. It's a hot topic among journalists lately. Every inter
view with Morissette features a discussion about the lyrics,

and she is all too happy to disclose a limited amount of de
tails. Is it revenge? Is she capitalizing upon the gossip by
speaking about the song? Or is it merely therapeutic to let it
out after all of these years?
The next track, "Flinch," presumably addresses the same
relationship. "How long before my dignity is reclaimed/
How long can a girl stay haunted by you / Soon I'll grow up
and I won't even flinch at your name / Where've you been?
I heard you moved to my city ... I'd be paralyzed if I ran
into you / My tongue would seize up if we were to meet
again / What are you my god? You touch me like you are my
god." Something about the lyrics simply ring true, but often
times they are obscured by the bland songwriting. You have
to listen closely to appreciate the album.
