# Rouse leaves listeners out in the 'cold'
## 
### BENJAMIN L. FRIEDLAND 
Josh Rouse's latest record,
"Under Cold Blue Stars,"
showcases the singer / song
writer's drippy, melancholy
and very much whiny voice.
Unfortunately, despite mo
ments of masterful songwrit
ing, Rouse's soft rock and

simple arrangements prevent those mo
ments from expanding into an album of
mastery.
Rouse's music will please anyone who
lists David Gray, Jack Johnson (though
without the groove) or even Dave Matthews
as a favorite artist. Perfect for KFOG,
"Under Cold Blue Stars" balances tasteful
pop and sappy melodies.
After a brief cello and trumpet introduc
tion (see "Badly Drawn Boy"), the record
opens with "Nothing Gives Me Pleasure," a
ballad with his whiny vocals over a toe-tap
ping beat.
Clearly a man of Craft. Rouse has penned
a catchy chorus with delicate background vo
cals. However, like the rest of the album,
"Nothing Gives Me Pleasure" leaves listeners
feeling empty. Though Rouse's music strug
gles to sound heartfelt and honest, the songs
are simply too clean. Rouse never mumbles

or screams and just sounds rehearsed and
forced. He should have mixed his vocals so

they slide amidst (lie
guitar and piano.
The album's first
single, "Feeling No
Pain," has already
appeared on televi
sion and movie
soundtracks. And for

good reason: it's the record's finest. The
song captures Rouse at his best as the track
combines his pop sensibility, a familiar
melody and the record's loudest guitars.
The background vocals, though consistent
throughout the album, sound the best here.
Still Rouse's vocals disappoint after the
song's indie opening bars.
The keyboards on "Miracle," track three,
lock this song as one of the album's elite. With
traces of Coldplay, its chorus reflects Rouse's
ear for pleasantry. Like much of the eleven
tracks, this one addresses romance. Rouse
sings: "On the drive, you did not care /
You're sun-tired and your stomach's bare /
When your eyes light up and out of the blue
you scream."
Out on Rykodisc / Slow River Records,
"Under Cold Blue Stars" marks Rouse's third
release and his most critical success. The
Nashville-via-Nebraska singer / songwriter

says the 11 songs
comprise a loose
concept album. "I
was writing the
songs when 1 was
on the road," he
said. "It's almost
like a short film or
a little screenplay."
Rouse, as well as
his record, is sim
ply toocliched. His
half-groan / half
hoarse vocals
prompt listeners to
wonder if he really
sings like that. In
stead of realizing
the full potential of
these songs, Rouse
settles on a light
FM cheese that
reeks of contrition.
Still, these
songs contain
something de
lightful and listen
ers shouldn't

worry if they can't resist Rouse's sound. But
fora juicier and more heartfelt folk-rock, fans
should check out Red House Painters, Aimee

Mann or Wilco. Rouse's record lacks the
emotional charge that ranks these artists at
the top of contemporary songwriting.
