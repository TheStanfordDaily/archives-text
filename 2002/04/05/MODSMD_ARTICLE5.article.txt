# Campus art event celebrates student work
## 
### RAMIN SETOODEH EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Student Committee for the
Arts will host the third annual Art
Affair, a celebration of visual arts,
performing arts and creating writ
ing, at White Plaza today.
The all-day event begins this
morning and ends at around 11
p.m.
"We have a phenomenal
arrangement of things that are
going on," said senior Seth
Cohen, the committee president.
"There's visual arts, a festival [of
short films], live performances
and creative writing spoken art
performances."
This year, roughly 620 students
are involved in the event — either
as coordinators or artists with
showcased work.
Cohen said that what makes the
event different from other art
events is that no one is rejected
from showing their work. Three
stages are set up around White
Plaza for different performances.
"The basic premise of this event
is that it's extremely non-competi
tive," he said. "This is supposed to
be for the love of the art and a time
when people can just get
together — that's really one of our
guiding philosophies."
The entrees are not judged,
and no awards are given.
Senior David Layfer, who has
helped coordinate the event for
three years, said he was in charge
of the film festival this year.
"What's cool is that the films
start at 8 p.m. tonight, but at the
same time there are bands playing
at the other stage."

The films will be played out
doors in the courtyard of White
Plaza. They have been produc ed by
students and range in length from
45 seconds to 15 minutes.
Cohen, who also founded the
event three years ago, said the di
versity of the showcased art
should appeal to everyone. I lie
bands that perform vary over dif
ferent genres.
"It's gotten bigger every year,"
he said. "The demand for it has
been overwhelming."
Sophomore Lauren Wechsler,

the performance coordinator, also
stressed the diversity of the groups
registered to perform this year.
"They include everything from
salsa, swing dance, bands and solo
musical performers* to baton
twirling, monologues, Korean
drumming, martial arts and
more," Wechsler said.
One new addition this year is
the distribution of a CD that fea
tures recorded music from differ
ent Stanford bands.
About 2,000 free copies will be
handed out all dav.

"We had submissions from 40
bands, and we picked 19 of
them," said junior Scott Cannon,
the event's technical director.
"We'll try to manage the How of
the CDs effectively throughout
the day."
Cannon said he has no idea
whet her or not they will run out.
"We'll see how the demand is
this year," he said.
The event is sponsored by nu
merous student organizations.
