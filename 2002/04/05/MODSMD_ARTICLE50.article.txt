# 'Television' you should tune into

This is the third in a series of articles called 'The Record Bin" ex
ploring classic album from the past: pop music for people who like
pop music.

When Television was playing
gigs at New York's legendary
CBGB club in the late 19705, it was
already clear that its music was un
like anything ever heard before.
Since the band emerged from the
same scene as the Ramones,

Blondie and the Talking Heads, it
is often labeled as one of the first punk bands. Its legacy, how
ever, is very different from that of its peers at the time.
For one thing, Television's debut album, the enduring

masterpiece "Marquee Moon,"
never made much of a splash.
Though the band scored minor hits
in the United Kingdom, it never
made so much as a dent on the U.S.

commercial scene.
While most people
recognize hits by the
Ramones ("I Wanna
Be Sedated"), Blondie
("One Way Or Anoth
er") or the Talking
Heads ("Psycho
Killer"), the same can-

not be said of Television.
Nonetheless, the influence of
"Marquee Moon" on rock 'n' roll
music is indisputable. It is one of those
rare albums that change the way you
listen to music forever because
whether they are aware of it or not,
every intelligent, ambitious rock mu
sician since has borrowed something

from Television, no matter how slight. That comment isn't
meant to deride or belittle other musicians, though; Televi
sion itself drew tremendous inspiration from its predeces
sors. Rather, the band was able to utilize those inspirations
with unique flair and genius.
Figuratively speaking, "Marquee Moon" has several mu
sical personalities that reveal themselves at different points
on the album. On the one hand, there is the bluesy, free-jazz
guitar work of Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd on songs
like "Venus." On the other hand, many of the songs have a
coolly calculated pop feel. Dark and mysterious, yet also de
ceptively melodic, Verlaine's songwriting takes on a Lou
Reed-like quality.
"Friction," for example, contains the cryptic lyrics, ""My
eyes are like telescopes/I sit up backwards, but who wants
hope?" and "1 don't want to grow up / It's too much contra
diction / And too much friction." Like Reed, Verlaine had a
gift for penning mesmerizing observations about the contra
dictions of people and life, all delivered in a slightly out-of

tune whine. The album's title alone, "Marquee Moon," hints
at the complexities involved when the natural and the man
made come together to render our view of the world.
Musically, Television could trade licks with the greatest of
rock bands. "Marquee Moon" 's title track showed off the
group's technical competence in a dizzying l()-minute com
position that climaxes around the ninth minute with a twin
kle of guitars and drums before a brief descent back into a
tangled, but controlled, sonic jungle. As a foursome, Ver
laine, Lloyd, bassist Fred Smith and drummer Billy Ficca
could play circles around most of their peers from the late
70s New York City scene.
Television's debut remains a musical revelation whose
echoes can be heard directly in the music of bands as diverse
as Sonic Youth, Echo and the Bunnymenand R.E.M.,as well
as later bands like Pearl Jam, the Pixies, Nirvana and Pave
ment. Nearly a quarter-century since its release, "Marquee
Moon" is a terribly under-appreciated treasure among rock
albums that is just waiting to be discovered.
