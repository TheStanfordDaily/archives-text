# S.F. Symphony plays two masterpieces
## 
### RAPHAEL GINSBURG 
The events of Sept.
11 have had the curi
ous effect of making
just about anything
seem relevant; nearly
anything can be, and
has been, said to be "es
pecially relevant in

light of the recent tragedies," or something
along those lines. So when an artistic event
comes along that is actually significantly re
lated to the terrorist attacks, it is all the
more poignant.
This was the case with the San Francisco
Symphony's recent performance of two
war-themed works, Benjamin Britten's
"Sinfonia da RequienT'and Aaron Jay Ker
nis' Second Symphony. Regardless of one's
opinion of "music with a message" or even
of 20th-century music, one could not have
left the concert hall without being touched
by the power and scope of these two mas
terpieces, performed magnificently under
the direction of Donald Runnicles.
Britten's "Sinfonia" is one of the com
poser's most moving works. It was written

with a double close of despair, as it was Brit
ten's response both to the death of his parents

and the increasingly dis
turbing war that was en
gulfing the world in 1940.
The first move
ment opens with the
fierce, war-like pounding
of the timpani, which has
probably never been beat-

en so before; David Herbert's masterful
playing set a backbone for the entire sym
phony. The strings responded with as
much fervor, bringing out the extreme
melancholy and mourning in the music.
The second movement, an angry and
martial yet exuberant danse macabre,
showcased the technical prowess of the
symphony; the perfect control of the strings
during their extended passages of tricky
spicatto defied possibility.
The symphony ends with a resigned, sad
third movement. The pure, beautiful play
ing of the orchestra, especially the flutes,
was all the more peaceful after the violent
second movement.
Under Runnicles, the orchestra was able
to take the music to the extreme without

ever losing direction or control and without
overdoing it; the sheer power of the music
was overwhelming. He pushed the orches
tra to such excesses that it seemed like it
might get away from him at any moment,
but he never let the music become sloppy.
Kernis was inspired to write his Second
Symphony by the tragic events of the early
'90s, notably the Persian Gulf War, the
Rodney King riots and the escalating con
flict in Bosnia. It shares with Britten's "Sin
fonia" an extreme sense of urgency and
tragedy.
The music often pulls in many direc
tions at once, and Runnicles again showed
great skill in getting the most out of the
orchestra without losing control. Kernis
creates many wonderfully colorful sound
effects, which the orchestra rendered per
fectly. The slippery, silvery strings; the
magical, otherworldly bells and chimes;
the crashes and bangs of the percussion;
and the sad, serene violin solos all were
delivered perfectly.
Perhaps the most powerful effect of all
comes at the close of the symphony; when
the epic, expansive playing of the strings
has receded to a lull, the tremendous crash

ing of a metal gong breaks the serenity, the
sound building until it gradually takes over
all else. The sound must be described as
noise, but it was phenomenal music
nonetheless. After the playing had ceased,
Runnicles held off the applause for more
than thirty seconds; he allowed far more
than the standard amount of time for the
sound to subside, perhaps to force people
to think of the significance of the music.
The program also included a more
traditional work, Brahms's Violin Con
certo. The soloist was rising star Julian
Rachlin, who gave a lyrical interpretation
of this concert hall staple. His virtuoso
playing brought out the powerful and
flashy elements of the music, but he also
made the most of the Romantic character
of the concerto.
In the end, though, he didn't have any
thing nni(|iie to contribute to the long list of
masterful performances of this work; I can't
help but accuse his performance of being
standard, keeping in mind that it is a very
high standard that has been set by his pre
decessors. Nevertheless, his encore by
Ysaye left nobody doubting his technical
expertise.
