# BART-Caltrain expansion will offer new travel opportunities
## 
### VICTOR REKLAITIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The new BART-Caltrain connecting
platform at the Millbrae Station will open
in late fall, allowing Stanford students to
travel straight into downtown San Francis
co, or directly into a San Francisco Inter
national Airport terminal.
The new platform means the long walk
to Market Street from the King St. Cal
train station and the often-crowded shut
tle ride to the airport from the Millbrae
station will no longer be necessary.
Instead, students can take the Calttain
to Millbrae, walk across the platform, and
hop onto a BAR I train. In about two min

utes they can t each the departure level of
the airport's new international terminal,
and in about 20 minutes they can be in (he
downtown San Francisco corridor ser
viced by BART.
The Millbrae cross-platform connec
tion between commuter rail and rapid rail
is the first of its kind for cities west of the
Mississippi, and is part of the $1.5 billion
BART-SFO Extension project. The new
102,000-square foot Millbrae hub station
will have five tracks and an overhead con
course for ticketing.
Overall, new BAR I stations are being
built in Millbrae, San Francisco Interna
tional Airport, San Bruno and South San
Francisco. Al the already operating

Colma station just north of the South San
Francisco station, the new track will con
nect to the rest of the BART network,
which extends from the Peninsula to the
Fast Bay. When the extension is finished,
five counties of the Bay Area will be con
nected through 182 miles of virtually
seamless rail service.
"We are trying to link up existing sys
tems, where we've already invested the
money," said Molly McArthur, manager
of government and community relations
for the BART-SFO Extension. "We have
the infrastructures, now let's make them
work together."
Between the four new stations, cS.7
miles of rail track are being builtâ€”mostly

subway track but also 1.2 miles of aerial
track at San Francisco International Air
port. According to BAR I officials, by 2010
the extension will carry nearly 70.000 pas
sengers each weekday, and will eliminate
10,000 auto trips per day to San Francisco
International Airport. I lie Millbrae sta
tion alone is projected to handle about
.'13,000 passengers daily.
The BART-SF() Kxtension isa partner
ship between BAR I , the Federal Transit
Administration, Sam I Vans of Santa Clara
County, San Francisco International Air
port and the California Transportation
Commission and the Metropolitan Trans
portation (Commission.
With a contribution of $750 million in

1997, the federal government has provid
ed half of the total budget.
Officials at the commission said the hat
tie to obtain funding from Washington was
"painful" and "intense," since many metro
politan areas proposed similar plans.
"One of the most important things in
getting funding for our project was being
able to demonstrate the cross-regional
benefit," McArthur said. "Cross-regional
ism really resonated in Washington, and
the connection into the airport was the
other thing that really resonated."
BAR I officials said the extension is
scheduled to open in the late fall of this
year. They, will set an exact opening day in
the late spring.
