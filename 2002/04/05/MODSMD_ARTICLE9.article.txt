Salmonella poisoning
linked to soft white
cheese
SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — More than 50 re
ported cases of salmonella poisoning since Jan
uary have prompted state health officials to
warn consumers to avoid an illegally produced
cheese popular among Latinos.
Many of the cases linked to the soft white
cheese — queso fresco — occurred in San
Mateo, Santa Clara and Alameda counties.
Of the 36 cases studied so far by health olfi
cials, 14 were hospitalized, including seven chil
dren, according to epidemiologist Dr. Michele
Cheung, who is overseeing the investigation.
Officials have been unable to identify the
maker or distributor of the contaminated
cheese. The strain of salmonella bacteria caus
ing the outbreak, called Newport, worries epi
demiologists because it is known to be resistant
to certain antibiotics.
