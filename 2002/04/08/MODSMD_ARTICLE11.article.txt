1992
On April 8, 1992, The Daily print
ed an article about a county ban on
skateboarding.
"Landing a '360' off the Quad steps
could cost skateboarders up to $100
alter yesterday's approval of an ordi
nance banning skateboarding on
campus.
"The Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors voted unanimously to
prohibit the use of'skateboards, coast
ers or similar devices within the cen
tral academic campus' of Stanford.
"The ordinance was written by
County Counsel James Lewis in re
sponse to a Feb. 21 letter written by
University Vice President for Public
Affairs Bob Freelen.
"Freelen described a 'virtual invasion
of the University,' pointing out that
since other cities have passed ordi
nances banning skateboarding, the
youths ilock to Stanford.
"The skateboarders 'cause substan
tial damage to University property,
and their noise has caused at least one
faculty member to cut short his classes,'
Freelen wrote.
Bottom Line: So they've found a way to keep
Paly kids out of the Quad, but will they ever
figure out how to keep them out of our par
ties?
