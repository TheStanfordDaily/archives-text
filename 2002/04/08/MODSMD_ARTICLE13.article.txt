Fresno police deny profiling
FRESNO, Calif. (/Vl') — A racial profiling study
shows 08 percent of people arrested by Fresno police
in February were Hispanics, who make up about 40
percent of the c ity's population 0f427,652.
Chief Jerry Dyer said the numbers rellect recent
gang crackdowns in south Fresno, home to a high
proportion of Hispanics.
The study prompted Ben Benavidez, president
of the Mexican American Political Association and a
member of Dyer's advisory board, to question
whether Hispanics are being stereotyped as gang
members.
"If lie doesn't give more answers by the next board
meeting, then we'll do our own investigation," Be
navidez said at the board's monthly meeting.
Dyer denied any racial profiling by his officers.
A roundup of alleged gang members and parole
violators resulted in 162 arrests in February, and
68 percent of those booked were Hispanic. Lt.
Keith Foster, Dyer's administrative assistant, said
the percentage will fall as (he crackdown ends next
month.
