# Destroyed U.S. spy plane to undergo repairs

MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) â€” A year after a col
lision with a lighter jet forced it to make an
emergency landing in China, a U.S spy plane
that was picked over and cut apart is being put
back together and could be back in the air
next month.
The Navy EP-3 electronic surveillance
plane is undergoing repairs at Lockheed-
Martin in Marietta.
That work should be completed in May,
when the plane is to be flown to a Raytheon
Co. plant at Waco, Texas, for electronic up
dates, Navy spokesman Hob Coble said.
After that, the four-engine plane is sched
uled to return to Navy service by the end of
the year.
"The inventory of EP-3 aircraft is 11, so it's
not like there's tons and tons of these things
around," Coble said. "It's a surveillance and
reconnaissance airplane, and we've got lots of
missions for that kind of airplane."
The plane was flying over the South China
Sea on April 1, 2001, when it collided with a
Chinese fighter. The EP-3, with an ew of 24,
made an emergency landing on China's

Hainan island, where the crew members
were detained for 11 days. The Chinese pilot
was lost.
Each side blamed the other for the collision.
China accused the U.S. plane of violating in
ternational law by landing without permission,
and it refused to let American technicians fix it
and fly it out. The U.S. crew destroyed much
of the plane's sensitive eavesdropping devices,
but China is believed to have removed some
equipment when it seized the plane and may
have gleaned some useful information.
Three months after the crash, the U.S. spy
plane was released to the United States and,
with its wings and tail cut off, loaded onto a
cargo plane for the flight home.
The incident further strained relations be
tween China and the United States which
were already tense over issues including Tai
wan, arms proliferation and human rights.
China also has demanded $1 million to com
pensate for expenses related to housing the
spy plane and its crew. It rejected a U.S. offer
of $34,000 as unacceptable.
Coble said that because of security he

couldn't disc uss the repairs now being made
or what the Chinese might have learned from
the plane. But analysts say equipment left on
board could have provided some information.
"What they would get most of all is a very,
very powerful sense of what we are capable of
listening to and what we are capable of finding
out," said Bates Gill, a senior fellow at the
Brookings Institution. "I think they would be
very interested to find that out."
The EP-3 is basically a "giant electronics
signals vacuum cleaner" that can monitor
communications data from telephones, radios
and even walkie-talkies, Gill said.
By monitoring radar, infrared and other
weapons-tracking systems, it can determine
how a country detects and then reacts to air
craft in or near its airspace.
" The U.S. has spent an enormous amount
of time and money to enhance and upgrade
their intelligence systems, and any time an
opposing force can get their hands on the end
result of those years and money, it's in their
best interest," former military intelligence of
ficer Roland Schumann said.
