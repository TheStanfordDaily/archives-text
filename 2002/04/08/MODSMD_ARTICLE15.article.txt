# Bits & Bytes: stem cells, volcanoes, new vaccines

Proponents of stem cells ob
tained a victory last month, thanks
to a video clip shown to the Cali
fornia State Senate by Hans
Keirstead, a professor at the UC-
Irvine College of Medicine. 1 he
video portrayed a mouse recover
ing from spinal injury.
Keirstead and colleagues inject
ed human embryonic stem cells
into the injured spines. Stem cells
are totipotent, meaning that they
can develop into other kinds of
cells that are not easily replaced by
the adult organism. They are usu
ally obtained from discarded in
vitro fertilization.
A state hearing last month
brought forth testimonies of sever
al people suffering from multiple
paralysis or sclerosis, who support
ed a continuation of stem-cell re
search. The Senate upheld a bill al
lowing research in California, with
some restrictions.
A University of Buffalo team is
trying to develop ways to predict
when a volcano will erupt, as well
as the lava's path of destruction.
The research involves a combina
tion of mathematical modeling,
geological simulation, scientific
computing and virtual reality.
The scientists have been using

three-dimensional simulations of
three Mexican volcanoes: Coli
ma, Popocatepetl and Pico de
Orizaba. Popocatepetl in located
outside Mexico City and is cur
rently considered to be the most
at-risk in the world.
Researchers have obtained 50
percent accuracy in their predic
tions by now, but are hoping to
improve the model. Eventually
the data might be available on
the Internet at no cost and used
by authorities to determine safe
ty conditions.
Hepatitis affects almost 2 bil
lion people worldwide. For the
past two years, the Boyce
Thompson Institute in associa
tion with Cornell University has
been clinically testing an edible
vaccine against hepatitis.
The researchers used engineer
ing techniques to introduce the
hepatitis-B surface antigen into
the common potato. Antigens are
proteins that induce immunity, so
that when the actual virus attacks
the person, his immune system
will be ready to defend.
However, potatoes might not
be ideal carriers since people do
not eat them raw. The team is cur
rently testing the effects of cooking
and looking into alternate carriers

such as bananas.
Researchers from the Universi
ties of Pavia and of Ancona in Italy
have recently found that coffee
may help prevent cavities.
Coffee from roasted beans has
anti-bacterial agents, including
agents that fight S-mutans, which
are a major cause of dental prob
lems. The scientists found that
coffee molecules prevent adhe
sion of the bacteria on tooth

enamel. Both the antibacterial
and anti-adhesive properties
could thus help prevent coloniza
tion of the tooth by S-mutans.
The leading author Gabriels
Gazzani has been skeptical about
whether the same results apply to
animals, since the experiment was
conducted in flasks and tubes — so
don't use this to justify that extra
Frappuccino — at least not yet!
China is building a channel to
transport water from its wet south
to its dry north. Aside from the
mounting cost, currently at $22
billion, ecological concerns are
also pressing.

Environmental experts predict
the leviathan project could spark
enormous human hardship, since
6 million people have already been
relocated — and it could also dry
the Yangtze River in 30 years.
Many have urged China to take
more basic steps to alleviate the
water problem, such as improving
the current water supply and curb
ing water leaks.
This project is following China's
even larger construction of the
Three Gorges Dam. The huge
dam along the Yangtze will supply
the energy of four Hoover Dams,
and has already displaced 6 million
people.
