## The
						Stanford Daily Use of term 'hate crime' must be re-examined 
### 
Published Since 1891

During March a letter was mailed to El
Centro Chicano that contained a
white, anthrax-like powder. We con
demn this act of hate, and support
the actions that the University and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation have taken to counter it
and find the perpetrators.
These sorts of threats to members of the
Stanford community are unacceptable. Pre
tending to mail anthrax to a person is a seri
ous crime and it is being dealt with seriously.
However, we have some reservations about
the University's Acts of Intolerance Protocol.
The wording of the document is non-specific
and allows many crimes that we believe are not
necessarily hate crimes to be classified as such.
The protocol says that "an act of intoler
ance is conduct that adversely targets an in
dividual or group on the basis or sex, race,

color, disability, religion, sexual orientation
and/or national / ethnic origin." Campus
police are given jurisdiction over investigat
ing acts of intolerance.
We believe, however, that for an action
against an individual to be classified as a "hate
crime," a number of factors not listed in the
protocol must be present.
First and foremost, the crime must be out
of the ordinary. A passing remark of bigotry
is not a hate crime. It is wrong and unaccept
able, but it does not rise to the level of seri
ousness that the term "hate crime" connotes.
Bigotry, sadly, exists in America today. Many
were raised in households that were racist or
sexist or homophobic, to choose just a few ex
amples. Sometimes, remarks that may be
hurtful to members of minorities are unin
tended, offhand statements voiced by gener

ally good people.
The action should also be premeditated.
An off-hand remark often comes out
thoughtlessly. Hate, however, is well-planned
and well-coordinated.
The crime must also be targeted at a person
or number of persons. There is a difference be
tween graffiti that is very visible and that which
goes virtually unnoticed. Graffiti scrawled
across the front door of the History Corner, for
example, is likely premeditated and malicious,
while that scrawled on a classroom desk may
just be the destructive behavior of a bored —
and perhaps bigoted — student.
While acts of bigotry are certainly exam
ples of intolerance, they are not hate crimes.
The police do not need to investigate every
politically incorrect remark made around
campus, as former University President Ger

hard Casper seemed to suggest with his push
for banning "hate speech." Freedom of
speech comes at a price: sometimes people
say things that others don't like. As long as
the words or actions of an individual do not
cause direct, tangible harm to another, there
is no hate crime to investigate.
At the side of freedom of speech stands part
of the institutional mission of Stanford: to pro
mote rational, intellectual dialogue. We can
not prohibit people from airing unpopular
beliefs so long as they do not infringe on the
freedoms of others. Freedom is a valuable pos
session. We should guard it with care.
The term "hate crime" is a strong, loaded
term. It should be reserved for the most
shocking and horrible of incidents. If it is
used too frequently and too loosely, then it
will lose its effect when it is needed most.
