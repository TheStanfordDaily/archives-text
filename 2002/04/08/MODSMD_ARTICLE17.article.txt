# DANCING IN CIRCLES
## Acceptance day: Illusions 
### 
Do you remember the clay you
were accepted to Stanford? You
received that packet —on the
outside it applauded you "for all
the nights you stayed up that extra hour to
get it right...On the inside it promised
all the opportunities listed in the brochure:
world-class professors, some of the brightest
classmates in the world, and the opportuni
ty to spend lazy Sundays basking in the sun
on the Oval. That packet called to you, and
you knew where you had to go. Welcome to
Stanford, the Happiest Place on Earth.
Stanford really is a Disneyland of sorts.
You wait and wait and when you come,
you pay an exorbitant amount of money in
exchange for access to the university's of-

ferings. Once inside, you
look around, and there
are more attractions than
you could ever hope to
ride. You name it, Stan
ford has it.
But one thing about
Disneyland: it's a land of
illusions. If you think that
guy in the Donald Duck

suit enjoys roasting on the corner of Main
Street all afternoon, you've got another
thing coming.
At Stanford (and even before) we learn
the illusion of a meritocracy, as though our
position as students were based entirely on
individual merit. Then there is the illusion
that everyone is happy here, working hard
and playing hard in the sunshine.
Most striking to me is the illusion that
when the needs of "the Stanford Commu
nity" are addressed, it really is the whole
community that we're talking about.
Who is part of Our community? John
Hennessy? Yes. My Statics prof.? Yup.
Students? Uh-huh. People who clean the
floors in FloMo Dining? Mm-hmm. Ad
ministrative assistants? You bet. Mar
guerite drivers, groundskeepers, depart
ment heads, hospital workers — all of us
spend our days here at Stanford.
But looking back on it, my "Approach
ing Stanford" booklet didn't mention
some of those people. I wasn't aware that
my meals might be prepared by tempo
rary workers who had no job security, let
alone health insurance.
And it's funny, I don't see many house
keepers from Stanford Hospital tossing Iris
bies around on the Oval. Not many dorm
janitors participate in "Crossing the Line."
Ilien again, I don't see many students sit
ting at the cooks' table in the dining hall.
What is it that divides our communities,
when we have so much to learn from each
other? And why does such a veil of silence
surround that question?
I think it's because we know the answer
already. We'd have to admit that power
and resources are not distributed equally
among us. How can we bridge those com
munities? Affording us equal respect
would be a start.
I'm not going to try to convince you
that everyone deserves to make enough to

provide for their families — that is, a liv
ing wage. If you don't believe that, there is
nothing more 1 can say.
But if you buy the idea that we all have
this basic right, the University becomes a
strangely illogical place.
How is it that Stanford requires its stu
dents to have health insurance, and at the
same time will not make a commitment to
providing it for all who work here?
Now let's be fair. Stanford has offered
to raise its minimum wage to $10.10 per
hour for workers with benefits and $ 11.35
for those without.
But is that a real commitment to re
specting workers, or is it just another illu
sion, something to keep us quiet?
When you consider that the average
rent in Santa Clara county is $1,542 per
month, how are people to pay for food,
utilities, medical expenses, birthday pre
sents, gas or bus fare, clothes.... And
what about saving for retirement? Ha! Re
tirement? What's that?
What we need is a comprehensive code
for Stanford employment practices to fol
low, one that guarantees a livable standard
for workers for years to come.
But, Stanford says, we just can't afford
to increase wages. Academic opportunities
would have to suffer.
First of all, if you've ever tried to obtain
accurate information from the University
on how its spends its money, you know it's
hard to come by. Second, the University's
greatness is not solely determined by its
sheer volume of resources; the allocation
of those funds is important as well.
Are you really going to tell me you'd
rather take a freshman seminar than allow
someone's toddler to have access to a doc
tor? Not likely.
There is something wrong when the
CEO of our University makes nearly $1
million a year and the President is offering
$10.10 as a living wage. If the University is
strapped for cash, maybe we need to cut the
salaries of its top earners. And that's not a
personal attack, nor is it a joke. It's just the
facts, simple arithmetic.
And don't give me the business about
how raising the minimum wage increases
inflation. You can't make me believe that
there is no possible way we can have ev
eryone make enough to survive.
You know, I'm willing to bet that this
column has appeared in The Daily many
times before. Really, there is nothing new
to say on the issue of economic justice.
Every time workers call for fair treat
ment, they're told it's impossible. And
every time students rally in support, Stan
ford chalks it up to our "youthful ideal
ism," and assures us that that's just not the
way the world works.
When will we realize that the world is
however we make it? Until then, I
guess, you'll just have to keep reading
these columns.

would be a start.
I'm not going to try to convince you
that everyone deserves to make enough to

provide for their families — that is, a liv
ing wage. If you don't believe that, there is
nothing more 1 can say.
But if you buy the idea that we all have
this basic right, the University becomes a
strangely illogical place.
How is it that Stanford requires its stu
dents to have health insurance, and at the
same time will not make a commitment to
providing it for all who work here?
Now let's be fair. Stanford has offered
to raise its minimum wage to $10.10 per
hour for workers with benefits and $ 11.35
for those without.
But is that a real commitment to re
specting workers, or is it just another illu
sion, something to keep us quiet?
When you consider that the average
rent in Santa Clara county is $1,542 per
month, how are people to pay for food,
utilities, medical expenses, birthday pre
sents, gas or bus fare, clothes.... And
what about saving for retirement? Ha! Re
tirement? What's that?
What we need is a comprehensive code
for Stanford employment practices to fol
low, one that guarantees a livable standard
for workers for years to come.
But, Stanford says, we just can't afford
to increase wages. Academic opportunities
would have to suffer.
First of all, if you've ever tried to obtain
accurate information from the University
on how its spends its money, you know it's
hard to come by. Second, the University's
greatness is not solely determined by its
sheer volume of resources; the allocation
of those funds is important as well.
Are you really going to tell me you'd
rather take a freshman seminar than allow
someone's toddler to have access to a doc
tor? Not likely.
There is something wrong when the
CEO of our University makes nearly $1
million a year and the President is offering
$10.10 as a living wage. If the University is
strapped for cash, maybe we need to cut the
salaries of its top earners. And that's not a
personal attack, nor is it a joke. It's just the
facts, simple arithmetic.
And don't give me the business about
how raising the minimum wage increases
inflation. You can't make me believe that
there is no possible way we can have ev
eryone make enough to survive.
You know, I'm willing to bet that this
column has appeared in The Daily many
times before. Really, there is nothing new
to say on the issue of economic justice.
Every time workers call for fair treat
ment, they're told it's impossible. And
every time students rally in support, Stan
ford chalks it up to our "youthful ideal
ism," and assures us that that's just not the
way the world works.
When will we realize that the world is
however we make it? Until then, I
guess, you'll just have to keep reading
these columns.

Do you remember the clay you
were accepted to Stanford? You
received that packet —on the
outside it applauded you "for all
the nights you stayed up that extra hour to
get it right...On the inside it promised
all the opportunities listed in the brochure:
world-class professors, some of the brightest
classmates in the world, and the opportuni
ty to spend lazy Sundays basking in the sun
on the Oval. That packet called to you, and
you knew where you had to go. Welcome to
Stanford, the Happiest Place on Earth.
Stanford really is a Disneyland of sorts.
You wait and wait and when you come,
you pay an exorbitant amount of money in
exchange for access to the university's of-

ferings. Once inside, you
look around, and there
are more attractions than
you could ever hope to
ride. You name it, Stan
ford has it.
But one thing about
Disneyland: it's a land of
illusions. If you think that
guy in the Donald Duck

suit enjoys roasting on the corner of Main
Street all afternoon, you've got another
thing coming.
At Stanford (and even before) we learn
the illusion of a meritocracy, as though our
position as students were based entirely on
individual merit. Then there is the illusion
that everyone is happy here, working hard
and playing hard in the sunshine.
Most striking to me is the illusion that
when the needs of "the Stanford Commu
nity" are addressed, it really is the whole
community that we're talking about.
Who is part of Our community? John
Hennessy? Yes. My Statics prof.? Yup.
Students? Uh-huh. People who clean the
floors in FloMo Dining? Mm-hmm. Ad
ministrative assistants? You bet. Mar
guerite drivers, groundskeepers, depart
ment heads, hospital workers — all of us
spend our days here at Stanford.
But looking back on it, my "Approach
ing Stanford" booklet didn't mention
some of those people. I wasn't aware that
my meals might be prepared by tempo
rary workers who had no job security, let
alone health insurance.
And it's funny, I don't see many house
keepers from Stanford Hospital tossing Iris
bies around on the Oval. Not many dorm
janitors participate in "Crossing the Line."
Ilien again, I don't see many students sit
ting at the cooks' table in the dining hall.
What is it that divides our communities,
when we have so much to learn from each
other? And why does such a veil of silence
surround that question?
I think it's because we know the answer
already. We'd have to admit that power
and resources are not distributed equally
among us. How can we bridge those com
munities? Affording us equal respect
would be a start.
I'm not going to try to convince you
that everyone deserves to make enough to

provide for their families — that is, a liv
ing wage. If you don't believe that, there is
nothing more 1 can say.
