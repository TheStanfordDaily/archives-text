Whites underrepresented minority
in Class of '06
I read your article, "Stanford admits
most diverse class" and was disturbed to
see that the while Caucasians represent
approximately 69 percent of the U.S. pop
ulation (2000 U.S. Census), they make up
only 48 percent of the class that was ad
mitted this year to Stanford.
Doesn't this statement sound familiar?
It is the same argument that special inter
est groups have made for many years
about minority student college admis
sions. It is based on the assumption that
representation of any group in the gener
al population should be the representa
tion of that group in those admitted to col
lege. If this assumption is valid then why
isn't your headline "Caucasians Under
represented in Stanford's Class"?
Equating diversity with skin color fur
ther flaws your article. The hallmarks of
true diversity are difference of opinion,
wide range of talent, and inherent merit.
Dean of Undergraduate Admission and
Financial Aid Robin Mamlet's comments
about the academic achievements of the
tlass appear merely as an afterthought.
Mamlet's comments should be the center
piece, the headline, of the story. The
graphic attached to the story reveals that
race is your primary focus.
You have made an error in judgment
by focusing on race in your article. Such an
article only fuels racial divisions. By con
tinually making each of us aware of our
racial differences you are undermining
the objective of a truly colorblind society.
Wouldn't you be more proud to write
an article entitled "Stanford Admits Most
Academically Gifted Class" or "Stanford
Admits Most Talented Class"?

Ruvolo 'oversimplifies
the issue of abortion'
In her guest column of April 5, Julie
Ruvolo greatly oversimplifies the issue of
abortion. Ruvolo feels that she is bring
ing a different perspective to the abor
tion issue by talking about the need for
women to realize that they can get preg
nant and to improve the accessibility of
contraception. I think that both pro-life
and pro-choice advocates would agree
that education is absolutely vital, even if
they do not agree on what the education
should entail.
However, this belief in education in no
way solves the issue of abortion. What does
education and accessibility of contracep
tion mean for victims of rape, who many
pro-lifers do not think should have the
right to an abortion?
As Ruvolo points out, freedom and
life are opposed to each other in the case
of abortion. If I understand the pro-life
argument, which I do not support, it says
that the killing of a fetus is wrong. There
fore, it is not possible to have both sides,
in the pro-lifer's opinion. They want to
remove the woman's freedom to choose.
Furthermore, the assertion that the
"1.5 million abortions each year" trans
lates into 1.5 million unwanted pregnan
cies is preposterous. What of the women
who want children, but face complica
tions in their pregnancies? These
women are forced to weigh between
abortion of a possibly still-born child
against their own safety.
I fail to see how Ruvolo, in sidestep
ping the "full-fledged fetus debate," has
really done anything other than remind
us all of the value of education, which
should not be understated.
Instead, she has obscured the intrica
cies of an issue that has too much emo
tional baggage for too many people to be

solved with an analogy about vanilla and
chocolate ice cream.

'Y tu mama tambien' sends
wrong message
Last Friday, my wife and I had the op
portunity to visit your beautiful campus
and view the Mexican movie, "Y tu mama
tambien." I wish to share two thoughts we
had when we left the campus:
1. In spite of the official capacity of 400,
Cubberley Auditorium was stuffed with
people well in excess of 500, if not more.
This constitutes a gross fire safety violation.
2. It seems the fans totally overlooked
the profane, vulgar and graphic nature of
the film, enjoyed the movie, and felt that it
was funny and well-made.
Considering the fact that the movie was
shown under the auspicesof a School of Ed
ucation setting, we feel such movies should
not be shown where child or teen pornog
raphy is so vividly used to make whatever
point there is to make. One has to remem
ber that in today's heterogeneous society,
there is still a large number of pupils to
whom this is awkward and unacceptable
because of t he messages it sends as to what
is acceptable. Moreover, these films do not
represent good old American values either.
As a mat ter of coincidence, I read a de
scription on the wall of the auditorium that
quotes the then-University President Ray
Lyman Wilbur and then-Dean Cubberley
just before entering the auditorium. It says:
"Our democracy depends upon what we
do in school and whfrt is done there is de
termined by teachers .... "
The responsibility and the judgment of
