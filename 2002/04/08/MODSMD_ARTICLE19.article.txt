Whites underrepresented minority
in Class of '06
I read your article, "Stanford admits
most diverse class" and was disturbed to
see that the while Caucasians represent
approximately 69 percent of the U.S. pop
ulation (2000 U.S. Census), they make up
only 48 percent of the class that was ad
mitted this year to Stanford.
Doesn't this statement sound familiar?
It is the same argument that special inter
est groups have made for many years
about minority student college admis
sions. It is based on the assumption that
representation of any group in the gener
al population should be the representa
tion of that group in those admitted to col
lege. If this assumption is valid then why
isn't your headline "Caucasians Under
represented in Stanford's Class"?
Equating diversity with skin color fur
ther flaws your article. The hallmarks of
true diversity are difference of opinion,
wide range of talent, and inherent merit.
Dean of Undergraduate Admission and
Financial Aid Robin Mamlet's comments
about the academic achievements of the
tlass appear merely as an afterthought.
Mamlet's comments should be the center
piece, the headline, of the story. The
graphic attached to the story reveals that
race is your primary focus.
You have made an error in judgment
by focusing on race in your article. Such an
article only fuels racial divisions. By con
tinually making each of us aware of our
racial differences you are undermining
the objective of a truly colorblind society.
Wouldn't you be more proud to write
an article entitled "Stanford Admits Most
Academically Gifted Class" or "Stanford
Admits Most Talented Class"?

Ruvolo 'oversimplifies
the issue of abortion'
In her guest column of April 5, Julie
Ruvolo greatly oversimplifies the issue of
abortion. Ruvolo feels that she is bring
ing a different perspective to the abor
tion issue by talking about the need for
women to realize that they can get preg
nant and to improve the accessibility of
contraception. I think that both pro-life
and pro-choice advocates would agree
that education is absolutely vital, even if
they do not agree on what the education
should entail.
However, this belief in education in no
way solves the issue of abortion. What does
education and accessibility of contracep
tion mean for victims of rape, who many
pro-lifers do not think should have the
right to an abortion?
As Ruvolo points out, freedom and
life are opposed to each other in the case
of abortion. If I understand the pro-life
argument, which I do not support, it says
that the killing of a fetus is wrong. There
fore, it is not possible to have both sides,
in the pro-lifer's opinion. They want to
remove the woman's freedom to choose.
Furthermore, the assertion that the
"1.5 million abortions each year" trans
lates into 1.5 million unwanted pregnan
cies is preposterous. What of the women
who want children, but face complica
tions in their pregnancies? These
women are forced to weigh between
abortion of a possibly still-born child
against their own safety.
I fail to see how Ruvolo, in sidestep
ping the "full-fledged fetus debate," has
really done anything other than remind
us all of the value of education, which
should not be understated.
Instead, she has obscured the intrica
cies of an issue that has too much emo
tional baggage for too many people to be

solved with an analogy about vanilla and
chocolate ice cream.

'Y tu mama tambien' sends
wrong message
Last Friday, my wife and I had the op
portunity to visit your beautiful campus
and view the Mexican movie, "Y tu mama
tambien." I wish to share two thoughts we
had when we left the campus:
1. In spite of the official capacity of 400,
Cubberley Auditorium was stuffed with
people well in excess of 500, if not more.
This constitutes a gross fire safety violation.
2. It seems the fans totally overlooked
the profane, vulgar and graphic nature of
the film, enjoyed the movie, and felt that it
was funny and well-made.
Considering the fact that the movie was
shown under the auspicesof a School of Ed
ucation setting, we feel such movies should
not be shown where child or teen pornog
raphy is so vividly used to make whatever
point there is to make. One has to remem
ber that in today's heterogeneous society,
there is still a large number of pupils to
whom this is awkward and unacceptable
because of t he messages it sends as to what
is acceptable. Moreover, these films do not
represent good old American values either.
As a mat ter of coincidence, I read a de
scription on the wall of the auditorium that
quotes the then-University President Ray
Lyman Wilbur and then-Dean Cubberley
just before entering the auditorium. It says:
"Our democracy depends upon what we
do in school and whfrt is done there is de
termined by teachers .... "
The responsibility and the judgment of
what we promote in schools will determine
what we will see in future. This applies not
only to democracy, but also to moral back
bone, health and well-being of the society.

Dean Sullivan's decision 'courageous'
It was disappointing to read letters from
two graduates of Stanford l-aw School, who
should know better, attacking Dean Kath
leen Sullivan's courageous stand in favor of
the First Amendment. Most disappointing
was the failure of these two lawyers even to
read the seminal Supreme C lourt case, Buck
ley v. Valeo. 1 lad they bothered to do so, t hey
would have learned that the"the concept
that the government may resti ic t the speech

of some elements of society in order to en
hance the relative voice of others is wholly
foreign to the First Amendment.... The
First Amendment's protection against gov
ernmental abridgment of free expression
cannot properly be made to depend on a
person's financial ability to engage in public
discussion" (424 U.S. 1,24 (197(i)).
The First Amendment protects the
freedom of everyone to engage in political
debate and to use any and all of their re
sources (whether of wealth, charisma,
writing ability or ownership of a newspa
per) to enlist the support of the public on
the great issues of the day. It does not pro
vide for everyone to have equal influence
over the political process and indeed the
only way to do so would be to restrict the
speech of those with greater resources in
order to enhance the relative voice of
those without resources, which would di
rectly violate Buckley v. Valeo.
Notably, the only societies in this world
that guarantee such equal influence to ev
eryone are those (such as Cuba) where no
one has any influence at all on government
policy. Sullivan well understands this prin

ciple and deserves commendation for her
stand in favor of freedom and against state
controlled political speech.

Ph.D. student responds to Rassam
I am writing to correct the misrepresen
tations made in Mashh<x)d Rassam's recent
letter to The Daily ("Palestinian refugees
must have right of return," 4/4).
First, his contention that Israel deliber
ately drove hundreds of thousands of
Palestinians from their land is false. During
the Israeli War of Independence, the
Palestinians were encouraged by Arab
states to leave Israeli territory with the
promise of triumphant return following a
swift Arab victory. On the other hand, the
Israeli government encouraged them to
stay and work together to build a new state.
Many of them did, but even more of them
left to create today's millions of Palestinian
self-made "refugees."

Second, granting the right of return to
millions of Palestinians and their descen
dants would mean the end of the state of Is
rael as a Jewish state. The fact that Israel is
meant to be a Jewish state and not the 23rd
Arab suite is not just some Zionist pipe
dream, as Rassam would like us to believe.
It is actually enshrined in U.N. Resolution
181 that created Israel in 1947.
Third, the refugee problem is perpetu
ated by Arab suites who, for political rea
sons, refuse to provide any rights to the
Palestinian refugees currently living within
their borders. Instead, like Lebanon, they
confine them to refugee camps, often sur
rounded by fences and guarded by armed
troops, and deny them the tight to work,
own property and become citizens. By re
fusing to integrate their fellow Arab
brethren into their soc iet ies, the Arab suites
continue to stoke the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Fourth, the refugee problem is not limit
ed to Palestinians. After 1948, Jews living in
the Middle East were expelled from the
Arab states in which they had lived for gen
erations and forced to emigrate to Israel.
Not only did they lose most of their proper

ty and have their businesses expropriated,
but they were lucky just to escape with their
lives. For example, out of a pre-1948 pop
ulation of 60,000 Egyptian Jews, only about
100 remain in Egypt. Why do we not hear
alxmt the right of return for these refugees
and their right to reclaim, or be compen
sated for, their lost property?
Finally, Rassam's contention that
Barak's peace offer at Camp David was not
generous is completely preposterous. The
fact of the matter is that Israel agreed to
create a Palestinian state on 97 percent of
the West Bank and Gaza, with additional
Israeli territory to compensate the Pales
tinians for the loss of 3 percent of their
land. This is the most generous offer that
has ever been offered to the Palestinians
and is probably the most generous that
can possibly be offered.
By rejecting an Israeli offer that met the
overwhelming majority of Palestinian de
mands, Arafat clearly indicated that he
prefers war to peace.

Ruvolo 'oversimplifies
the issue of abortion'
In her guest column of April 5, Julie
Ruvolo greatly oversimplifies the issue of
abortion. Ruvolo feels that she is bring
ing a different perspective to the abor
tion issue by talking about the need for
women to realize that they can get preg
nant and to improve the accessibility of
contraception. I think that both pro-life
and pro-choice advocates would agree
that education is absolutely vital, even if
they do not agree on what the education
should entail.
However, this belief in education in no
way solves the issue of abortion. What does
education and accessibility of contracep
tion mean for victims of rape, who many
pro-lifers do not think should have the
right to an abortion?
As Ruvolo points out, freedom and
life are opposed to each other in the case
of abortion. If I understand the pro-life
argument, which I do not support, it says
that the killing of a fetus is wrong. There
fore, it is not possible to have both sides,
in the pro-lifer's opinion. They want to
remove the woman's freedom to choose.
Furthermore, the assertion that the
"1.5 million abortions each year" trans
lates into 1.5 million unwanted pregnan
cies is preposterous. What of the women
who want children, but face complica
tions in their pregnancies? These
women are forced to weigh between
abortion of a possibly still-born child
against their own safety.
I fail to see how Ruvolo, in sidestep
ping the "full-fledged fetus debate," has
really done anything other than remind
us all of the value of education, which
should not be understated.
Instead, she has obscured the intrica
cies of an issue that has too much emo
tional baggage for too many people to be

solved with an analogy about vanilla and
chocolate ice cream.

'Y tu mama tambien' sends
wrong message
Last Friday, my wife and I had the op
portunity to visit your beautiful campus
and view the Mexican movie, "Y tu mama
tambien." I wish to share two thoughts we
had when we left the campus:
1. In spite of the official capacity of 400,
Cubberley Auditorium was stuffed with
people well in excess of 500, if not more.
This constitutes a gross fire safety violation.
2. It seems the fans totally overlooked
the profane, vulgar and graphic nature of
the film, enjoyed the movie, and felt that it
was funny and well-made.
Considering the fact that the movie was
shown under the auspicesof a School of Ed
ucation setting, we feel such movies should
not be shown where child or teen pornog
raphy is so vividly used to make whatever
point there is to make. One has to remem
ber that in today's heterogeneous society,
there is still a large number of pupils to
whom this is awkward and unacceptable
because of t he messages it sends as to what
is acceptable. Moreover, these films do not
represent good old American values either.
As a mat ter of coincidence, I read a de
scription on the wall of the auditorium that
quotes the then-University President Ray
Lyman Wilbur and then-Dean Cubberley
just before entering the auditorium. It says:
"Our democracy depends upon what we
do in school and whfrt is done there is de
termined by teachers .... "
The responsibility and the judgment of
what we promote in schools will determine
what we will see in future. This applies not
only to democracy, but also to moral back
bone, health and well-being of the society.

Dean Sullivan's decision 'courageous'
It was disappointing to read letters from
two graduates of Stanford l-aw School, who
should know better, attacking Dean Kath
leen Sullivan's courageous stand in favor of
the First Amendment. Most disappointing
was the failure of these two lawyers even to
read the seminal Supreme C lourt case, Buck
ley v. Valeo. 1 lad they bothered to do so, t hey
would have learned that the"the concept
that the government may resti ic t the speech

of some elements of society in order to en
hance the relative voice of others is wholly
foreign to the First Amendment.... The
First Amendment's protection against gov
ernmental abridgment of free expression
cannot properly be made to depend on a
person's financial ability to engage in public
discussion" (424 U.S. 1,24 (197(i)).
The First Amendment protects the
freedom of everyone to engage in political
debate and to use any and all of their re
sources (whether of wealth, charisma,
writing ability or ownership of a newspa
per) to enlist the support of the public on
the great issues of the day. It does not pro
vide for everyone to have equal influence
over the political process and indeed the
only way to do so would be to restrict the
speech of those with greater resources in
order to enhance the relative voice of
those without resources, which would di
rectly violate Buckley v. Valeo.
Notably, the only societies in this world
that guarantee such equal influence to ev
eryone are those (such as Cuba) where no
one has any influence at all on government
policy. Sullivan well understands this prin

ciple and deserves commendation for her
stand in favor of freedom and against state
controlled political speech.

Wilton, ( mii n.

Ph.D. student responds to Rassam
I am writing to correct the misrepresen
tations made in Mashh<x)d Rassam's recent
letter to The Daily ("Palestinian refugees
must have right of return," 4/4).
First, his contention that Israel deliber
ately drove hundreds of thousands of
Palestinians from their land is false. During
the Israeli War of Independence, the
Palestinians were encouraged by Arab
states to leave Israeli territory with the
promise of triumphant return following a
swift Arab victory. On the other hand, the
Israeli government encouraged them to
stay and work together to build a new state.
Many of them did, but even more of them
left to create today's millions of Palestinian
self-made "refugees."

Second, granting the right of return to
millions of Palestinians and their descen
dants would mean the end of the state of Is
rael as a Jewish state. The fact that Israel is
meant to be a Jewish state and not the 23rd
Arab suite is not just some Zionist pipe
dream, as Rassam would like us to believe.
It is actually enshrined in U.N. Resolution
181 that created Israel in 1947.
Third, the refugee problem is perpetu
ated by Arab suites who, for political rea
sons, refuse to provide any rights to the
Palestinian refugees currently living within
their borders. Instead, like Lebanon, they
confine them to refugee camps, often sur
rounded by fences and guarded by armed
troops, and deny them the tight to work,
own property and become citizens. By re
fusing to integrate their fellow Arab
brethren into their soc iet ies, the Arab suites
continue to stoke the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Fourth, the refugee problem is not limit
ed to Palestinians. After 1948, Jews living in
the Middle East were expelled from the
Arab states in which they had lived for gen
erations and forced to emigrate to Israel.
Not only did they lose most of their proper

ty and have their businesses expropriated,
but they were lucky just to escape with their
lives. For example, out of a pre-1948 pop
ulation of 60,000 Egyptian Jews, only about
100 remain in Egypt. Why do we not hear
alxmt the right of return for these refugees
and their right to reclaim, or be compen
sated for, their lost property?
Finally, Rassam's contention that
Barak's peace offer at Camp David was not
generous is completely preposterous. The
fact of the matter is that Israel agreed to
create a Palestinian state on 97 percent of
the West Bank and Gaza, with additional
Israeli territory to compensate the Pales
tinians for the loss of 3 percent of their
land. This is the most generous offer that
has ever been offered to the Palestinians
and is probably the most generous that
can possibly be offered.
By rejecting an Israeli offer that met the
overwhelming majority of Palestinian de
mands, Arafat clearly indicated that he
prefers war to peace.

I read your article, "Stanford admits

see that the while Caucasians represent
approximately 69 percent of the U.S. pop
ulation (2000 U.S. Census), they make up
only 48 percent of the class that was ad

Doesn't this statement sound familiar?
It is the same argument that special inter

about minority student college admis

representation of any group in the gener

isn't your headline "Caucasians Under

women are forced to weigh between
abortion of a possibly still-born child
against their own safety.
I fail to see how Ruvolo, in sidestep
ping the "full-fledged fetus debate," has
really done anything other than remind
us all of the value of education, which
should not be understated.
Instead, she has obscured the intrica
cies of an issue that has too much emo
tional baggage for too many people to be

solved with an analogy about vanilla and
chocolate ice cream.

'Y tu mama tambien' sends
wrong message
Last Friday, my wife and I had the op
portunity to visit your beautiful campus
and view the Mexican movie, "Y tu mama
tambien." I wish to share two thoughts we
had when we left the campus:
1. In spite of the official capacity of 400,
Cubberley Auditorium was stuffed with
people well in excess of 500, if not more.
This constitutes a gross fire safety violation.
2. It seems the fans totally overlooked
the profane, vulgar and graphic nature of
the film, enjoyed the movie, and felt that it
was funny and well-made.
Considering the fact that the movie was
shown under the auspicesof a School of Ed
ucation setting, we feel such movies should
not be shown where child or teen pornog
raphy is so vividly used to make whatever
point there is to make. One has to remem
ber that in today's heterogeneous society,
there is still a large number of pupils to
whom this is awkward and unacceptable
because of t he messages it sends as to what
is acceptable. Moreover, these films do not
represent good old American values either.
As a mat ter of coincidence, I read a de
scription on the wall of the auditorium that
quotes the then-University President Ray
Lyman Wilbur and then-Dean Cubberley
just before entering the auditorium. It says:
"Our democracy depends upon what we
do in school and whfrt is done there is de
termined by teachers .... "
The responsibility and the judgment of
what we promote in schools will determine
what we will see in future. This applies not
only to democracy, but also to moral back
bone, health and well-being of the society.

Dean Sullivan's decision 'courageous'
It was disappointing to read letters from
two graduates of Stanford l-aw School, who
should know better, attacking Dean Kath
leen Sullivan's courageous stand in favor of
the First Amendment. Most disappointing
was the failure of these two lawyers even to
read the seminal Supreme C lourt case, Buck
ley v. Valeo. 1 lad they bothered to do so, t hey
would have learned that the"the concept
that the government may resti ic t the speech

of some elements of society in order to en
hance the relative voice of others is wholly
foreign to the First Amendment.... The
First Amendment's protection against gov
ernmental abridgment of free expression
cannot properly be made to depend on a
person's financial ability to engage in public
discussion" (424 U.S. 1,24 (197(i)).
The First Amendment protects the
freedom of everyone to engage in political
debate and to use any and all of their re
sources (whether of wealth, charisma,
writing ability or ownership of a newspa
per) to enlist the support of the public on
the great issues of the day. It does not pro
vide for everyone to have equal influence
over the political process and indeed the
only way to do so would be to restrict the
speech of those with greater resources in
order to enhance the relative voice of
those without resources, which would di
rectly violate Buckley v. Valeo.
Notably, the only societies in this world
that guarantee such equal influence to ev
eryone are those (such as Cuba) where no
one has any influence at all on government
policy. Sullivan well understands this prin

ciple and deserves commendation for her
stand in favor of freedom and against state
controlled political speech.

Ph.D. student responds to Rassam
I am writing to correct the misrepresen
tations made in Mashh<x)d Rassam's recent
letter to The Daily ("Palestinian refugees
must have right of return," 4/4).
First, his contention that Israel deliber
ately drove hundreds of thousands of
Palestinians from their land is false. During
the Israeli War of Independence, the
Palestinians were encouraged by Arab
states to leave Israeli territory with the
promise of triumphant return following a
swift Arab victory. On the other hand, the
Israeli government encouraged them to
stay and work together to build a new state.
Many of them did, but even more of them
left to create today's millions of Palestinian
self-made "refugees."

Second, granting the right of return to
millions of Palestinians and their descen
dants would mean the end of the state of Is
rael as a Jewish state. The fact that Israel is
meant to be a Jewish state and not the 23rd
Arab suite is not just some Zionist pipe
dream, as Rassam would like us to believe.
It is actually enshrined in U.N. Resolution
181 that created Israel in 1947.
Third, the refugee problem is perpetu
ated by Arab suites who, for political rea
sons, refuse to provide any rights to the
Palestinian refugees currently living within
their borders. Instead, like Lebanon, they
confine them to refugee camps, often sur
rounded by fences and guarded by armed
troops, and deny them the tight to work,
own property and become citizens. By re
fusing to integrate their fellow Arab
brethren into their soc iet ies, the Arab suites
continue to stoke the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Fourth, the refugee problem is not limit
ed to Palestinians. After 1948, Jews living in
the Middle East were expelled from the
Arab states in which they had lived for gen
erations and forced to emigrate to Israel.
Not only did they lose most of their proper

ty and have their businesses expropriated,
but they were lucky just to escape with their
lives. For example, out of a pre-1948 pop
ulation of 60,000 Egyptian Jews, only about
100 remain in Egypt. Why do we not hear
alxmt the right of return for these refugees
and their right to reclaim, or be compen
sated for, their lost property?
Finally, Rassam's contention that
Barak's peace offer at Camp David was not
generous is completely preposterous. The
fact of the matter is that Israel agreed to
create a Palestinian state on 97 percent of
the West Bank and Gaza, with additional
Israeli territory to compensate the Pales
tinians for the loss of 3 percent of their
land. This is the most generous offer that
has ever been offered to the Palestinians
and is probably the most generous that
can possibly be offered.
By rejecting an Israeli offer that met the
overwhelming majority of Palestinian de
mands, Arafat clearly indicated that he
prefers war to peace.
