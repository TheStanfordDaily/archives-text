BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) â€” Sad
dam Hussein, the defiant Iraqi
president, vowed yesterday to de
feat the United States if it attacks
Iraq and to continue supplying
the Palestinians "with every
means by which they can defend
themselves."
"VVe will fight [the Americans]
with missiles, warplanes, marsh
reeds and even stones and they
will be defeated," Saddam was
quoted as saying by state-run
media.
He rejected U.S. criticism over
payments to families of Palestinian
suicide bombers, saying: "If Iraq

has the chance and the capability
to supply the Palestinians with
evei7 means by which they can de
fend themselves in a better way, we
will not hesitate to do so."
Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld last week accused Iran
and Syria of smuggling arms to
terrorists and criticized Iraq for of
fering payments of up to $25,000
to the families of Palestinian sui
cide bombers.
President George W. Bush has
said Saddam had to go, and did
not rule out military action if Iraq
continues to refuse the return of
U.N. weapons inspectors to verify

if Iraq has dismantled its weapons
of mass destruction, as it claims to
have done.
Meanwhile Sunday, Saddam's
son, Qusai, commander of the elite
Republican Guards, pledged alle
giance to his father a day after
Bush reaffirmed that the policy of
his government "is the removal of
Saddam."
"Your sons in the armed forces
and the brave Republican Guards
are swords ready to confront any
evil external aggression against
our beloved country," Qusai Hus
sein, 35, wrote in an open letter to
his father in Al-Iraq newspaper.
