# Battles continue in West Bank

NABLUS, West Bank (AP) â€” Israeli troops
fought fierce battles with Palestinians in the West
Bank yesterday, encountering stiff resistance in the
crowded Jenin refugee camp and in the winding al
leyways of Nablus' Old City.
At least 14 Palestinians were killed in Nablus,
where dead bodies were sprawled along narrow,
rubble-filied streets on the 10th day of Israel's of
fensive to weed out militants.
The renewed fighting came as Secretary of State
Colin Powell, due in the region this week to try to
resolve the crisis, said that Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon has "taken very much to heart" Presi
dent George W. Bush's call Saturday for an imme
diate withdrawal from Palestinian areas.
In a phone conversation late Sunday, Israeli
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres asked Powell to in
tervene with Lebanon and Syria to calm the border.
They also discussed possibilities fora cease-fire be
tween Israel and the Palestinians, according to a
statement from Peres' office.
With international pressure mounting and the
U.N. Security Council scheduling consultations on
the crisis later Sunday, there were hints of friction
between the Israeli government and its military
command. Officers sought more time for the West
Bank military operation, but Cabinet ministers
talked of bringing it to an end.
Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said the
military should operate as long as possible to "clean
out terrorism" in the West Bank, but acknowledged
that in light of Bush's demand, "our hourglass is
running out."
However, the army's Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Shaul

Mofaz told the Cabinet he needed eight weeks to
complete the job, according to Israel Radio.
Maj. Gen. Dan Harel, chief of military plan
ning, warned that if the army pulls out too soon,
"then another series of devastating terror attacks
will hit Israel's cities and streets. And then we'll go
(back)in."
Israeli troops have taken over most Palestinian
population'centers in the West Bank in their 10-
day-old offensive, Israel's biggest in two decades.
But the fighters in Jenin and Nablus have prevent
ed the Israelis from taking full control of the cities
and conducting house-to-house searches for mili
tants, as has been the case elsewhere in the West
Bank.
Powell said both sides would have to do more to
end the fighting. He said he would meet with Pales
tinian leader Yasser Arafat "if circumstances per
mit," depending on security, access and the meeting
agenda.
Israeli soldiers fought their way to the center of
the Jenin camp Since the Israeli incursion began
March 29, more than 95 Palestinians have been
killed in West Bank fighting, along with more than
10 Israeli soldiers. Also, 1,413 Palestinians have
been detained, including 361 who were on Israel's
wanted lists, and more than 1,400 rifles have been
confiscated, the military said in a statement.
Also, guerrillas in Lebanon opened fire on Israeli
border posts, wounding six soldiers, including four
women, the military said. The Israelis responded
with artillery and tank fire. Sharon charged that
Iran and Syria were trying to widen the Palestinian-
Israeli fighting to another front.
