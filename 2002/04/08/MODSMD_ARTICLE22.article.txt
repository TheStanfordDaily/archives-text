# Students advance to Top Coders finals

Computer programming can
still be profitable in today's weak
ened economy, three Stanford
students recently proved. The
graduate students were all
named finalists in a national pro
gramming contest and will com
pete fora top prize of $100,000.
Coterminal computer science
student Daniel Wright and doc
toral candidates in computer sci
ence, Eugene Davydov and Ante
Derek, are three of 16 finalists in
the 2002 Sun Microsystems and
Top Coder Collegiate Challenge
tournament. The competition
will be at the University Park
Hotel at MIT on April 19 and 20.
"Obviously, we're very excit
ed to have these three Stanford
University students among the
final 16 of our second Colle
giate Challenge," said Jack
Hughes, Top Coder founder
and chairman. "It should be

noted that they have scaled
steep odds to get to this point.
Out of over 500 of the country's
best developers, they have
made it to the final 16. The
competition has been fierce,
and we wish all three the best of
luck in the finals."
Top Coder organizes competi
tions for programmers from all
over the nation to try their skills
against each other.
Each participant's score is de
termined in two ways: an objec
tive scoring from the Top Coder
system and a challenge phase in
which any contestant can chal
lenge any other contestant's code
for errors. Therefore, the ability
to write good code is just as im
portant as the ability to write
code quickly.
All Ihe finalists have demon
strated mastery of these skills,
but Wright seems to be in the
best position, as he entered the
tournament as the second seed in
the west. He also is the only Top-

Coder member to ever make it to
the semifinals of each of fop-
Coder's first three major tourna
ments and he was the runner-up
in the 2001 Top Coder Invita
tional. During his time as a mem
ber of Top Coder, Wright has
won a total of $41,991 in three
types of competitions: the Colle
giate Challenge, the Invitational
and the company's weekly single
round matches.
"I enjoy coding and I enjoy
competition — perhaps in the
same way that many people
enjoy competitive sports,"
Wright said. "Especially given
that I am now familiar with most
of the highly ranked Top Coder
members, I enjoy matching my
skills against theirs. I like the
recognition that I believe this will
bring when I look for jobs. Of
course, I also like the substantial
prize money — that is perhaps
the main factor that has kept me
competing for so long."
Hughes agrees that fop-

Coder helps students find jobs
since it rewards the most talented
in the programming field.
"Given the pedigree of these
outstanding students, it is clear
that we have identified the future
leaders of software development
and the technology industry," he
said. "Top Coder has over 6,000
collegiate members. These 16 [fi
nalists] have put in a tremendous
effort in order to elevate above a
crowded field of the best and the
brightest. The energy and excite
ment during the online elimina
tion rounds was amazing. VVe
look forward to seeing them all at
MIT in April."
Wright encourages interest
ed students to compete.
"I know many people who
thought they had no chance of
doing well, so they didn't compete
fora long time," he said. "But
when they did start, they did very
well."
