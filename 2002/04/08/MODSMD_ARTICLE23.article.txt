MEN'S GYMNASTICS
Saturday: No. 11 Stanford finished in
sixth place at the NCAA championships
with 2] 2.775 points

After two upsets in the preliminaries, the
Cardinal's impressive Cinderella run com
ing to a close as the team earned its fourth
highest score of the season and finished the
year as the only squad to defeat the national
champion, Oklahoma.
Rankings held to form in the individual
championships as well, as Erwin and Gill,
both top-ranked, took first place in their
events. The last time the Cardinal had an in
dividual national champion was in 1996,
when lan Bachrach and Jamie Ellis claimed
national titles on the floor and parallel bars,
respectively.
Erwin, who earned a 9.950 three times
this season, claimed a 9.825 on the event as
he finished as Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration champion and the Cardinal's first
national champion on the rings.
"I was healthy all year as opposed to past
years, where I have had shoulder problems,"
said Envin. "I felt really good going into

tonight's final, I was nervous but confident."
GUI, who just recently ascended to the top
of the national vault rankings, finished with
a 9.487, edging out Oklahoma's Jock
Stevens' 9.437. Stevens had beaten Gill the
night before in the team finals. Unlike
Erwin, Gill wasn't so sure of his performance
going into the individual finals.
"Actually I didn't feel good and warmed
up terribly, so 1 was a little nervous," said
Gills, a two-time All-American. "But 1 pulled
through and 1 was really happy with the way
things worked out."
Going into the team finals on Friday,
head coach Sadao Hamada seemed very
relaxed.
"There was much more pressure today
[during the preliminaries] because you just
want to qualify," said Hamada, who finished
his last meet as head coach this weekend.
"Tomorrow [at team finals] there will be less
pressure because we will just go for it and see

dinal fared decently, claiming a
fourth-place finish in each event.
Erwin led all competitors with a
9.775 on the rings, while Gill fin
ished third on the vault with a
9.475. Senior Cade Raggio and ju
nior Paul O'Leary also helped ilie
Cardinal on the vault, earning a
9.175 and a 9.075, respectively.
The floor exercise was high
lighted by the 9.000s from senior
co-captain David Durante and
freshman Bryan McColgan. Par
ticularly impressive was McCol
gan s store, as lliis was his first and
only event at the NCAA champi
onships.
Durante led the team's lilth
place showing on the high bar, as
he earned a team-high 9.025 on
the event.

Competing for the third time
this season, senior Jason Blitz -
coming back from a stress frac
ture - was able to assist the team
on what was a problem event this
season, the pommel horse, as he
earned a 9.050 on the event.
Raggio assisted Blit/.'s gutsy per
formance with his 8.950 on the
event.
Going into its last event of the
night in fourth place, the Cardinal
was unable to close out the meet on
;i strong note as it stumbled on the
parallel bars, another problem
event for the team. Durante and
freshman Kelly Pang led the team
with iin 8.775 and 8.750, respec
tively. fhe poor performance on
this event eventually dropped the
Cardinal to its final sixth-place
showing.
Durante went on to compete
the next day at the individual li

horizontal bar, to finish in filth
place and close out his collegiate
career.
