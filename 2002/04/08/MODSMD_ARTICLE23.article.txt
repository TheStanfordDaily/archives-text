### NEMIL DALAL EDITORIAL STAFF 
Finishing its most successful season in re
cent memory, the men's gymnastics team
claimed sixth place at the NCAA champi
onships, as junior Marshall Ervvin and
sophomore Daniel Gill claimed national ti
tles on the l ings and vault, respectively.
After defying the rankings during the
NCAA preliminaries, the No. 11 Cardinal -
the lowest ranked team in the finals - was
brought back to earth, finishing in last place
at the finals with a 212.775. Oklahoma took
the team championship with a 219.300.

Saturday: No. 11 Stanford finished in
sixth place at the NCAA championships
with 2] 2.775 points

After two upsets in the preliminaries, the
Cardinal's impressive Cinderella run com
ing to a close as the team earned its fourth
highest score of the season and finished the
year as the only squad to defeat the national
champion, Oklahoma.
Rankings held to form in the individual
championships as well, as Erwin and Gill,
both top-ranked, took first place in their
events. The last time the Cardinal had an in
dividual national champion was in 1996,
when lan Bachrach and Jamie Ellis claimed
national titles on the floor and parallel bars,
respectively.
Erwin, who earned a 9.950 three times
this season, claimed a 9.825 on the event as
he finished as Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration champion and the Cardinal's first
national champion on the rings.
"I was healthy all year as opposed to past
years, where I have had shoulder problems,"
said Envin. "I felt really good going into

tonight's final, I was nervous but confident."
GUI, who just recently ascended to the top
of the national vault rankings, finished with
a 9.487, edging out Oklahoma's Jock
Stevens' 9.437. Stevens had beaten Gill the
night before in the team finals. Unlike
Erwin, Gill wasn't so sure of his performance
going into the individual finals.
"Actually I didn't feel good and warmed
up terribly, so 1 was a little nervous," said
Gills, a two-time All-American. "But 1 pulled
through and 1 was really happy with the way
things worked out."
Going into the team finals on Friday,
head coach Sadao Hamada seemed very
relaxed.
"There was much more pressure today
[during the preliminaries] because you just
want to qualify," said Hamada, who finished
his last meet as head coach this weekend.
"Tomorrow [at team finals] there will be less
pressure because we will just go for it and see
