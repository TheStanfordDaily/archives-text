# Wild weekend for Card, 'Cats
## 
### MAC LEVINE STAFF WRITER 
With its highs, lows, and unpre
dictable turns, the long baseball season
is a lot like a roller coaster ride. The No.
2 Cardinal's (22-6, 2-0 Pacific 10 Con
ference) first conference series this
weekend down in Tucson pretty much
confirmed the analogy as the Pac-10
season got off to its usual wild start for
Stanford.

The crazy weekend began on Friday
night, as the Cardinal defeated Arizona
(21-14, 2-6 Pac-10) 5-4 in an 18-inning
marathon that lasted live hours and 19
minutes. Freshman Chris Carter
scored from third base on a passed ball
with two outs in the top half of the 18th
inning, and junior reliever Ryan Mc-
Cally (2-0) retired the Wildcats in the
bottom half to do what most were be
ginning' to believe was impossible â€”
end the game.
In what was an amazing pitching
performance for the Cardinal, junior
ace Jeremy Guthrie threw the first 10 in
nings, giving up only two runs. McCally
picked up where Guthrie left off, pitch
ing eight innings, allowing only two
runs while striking out seven Wildcat
batters. Both Cardinal hurlers set career
highs in innings pitched, keeping their
team in the game until Carter's run fi
nally sealed the deal.
Senior third baseman Andy Topham
led the Cardinal with five hits, including
a solo home run in the top of the 12th in
ning. It gave the Cardinal a lead that was

quickly erased as Arizona's Marc
Raiser scored on a fielder's choice
by teammate John Hardy in the
bottom half of the inning.
In an odd statistical note, Ari
zona first baseman Pat Reilly set
an NCAA Division I single-game
record with 29 putouts, perhaps
giving the Wildcats a little to
cheer about in their heartbreak
ing defeat.
Both teams were back on the di
amond bright and early on Satur
day, although it seemed as if the
Wildcats didn't even realize it, as
Stanford clobbered Arizona, 19-1.
Junior lefty Tim Cunningham (5-
1) got the win for the Cardinal, al
lowing only one run and five hits
in his seven strong innings.
Needless to say, Cunningham
got some run support from his of
fense, as the Cardinal set season
highs with 19 runs and 26 hits.
Sophomore centerfielder Sam
Fuld was only a single away from
the cycle as he knocked in a career
high 6 RBI with his three hits,
while senior second baseman Chris
O'Riordan had his first-ever multi
homer game. He knocked two
long balls out of the extremely
windy confines of Frank Sancet
Field.
In only his second start ever
for the Cardinal, junior infielder
Tobin Swope took full advan
tage of his increased playing
time, going a perfect 5 for 5
while knocking in three more
runs for Stanford.
"Baseball is a funny game,"
said head coach Mark Marquess
after the Cardinal's offensive bar

rage. Each starter had at least one
hit while eight of the nine starters
had multi-hit games. "We got
some balls up in the air today and
they carried well the way the wind
was blowing."
Saturday's win guaranteed the
series victory for Stanford, extend
ing the team's streak of consecu
tive series wins to 11, dating back
to last year.
Sunday's contest capped off the
wild weekend with a pretty rare
occurrence, as the game was halt
ed after eight innings due to a time
limit agreed upon by both coaches.
Arizona is currently winning 15-
13, and the Cardinal will come to
bat in the top of the ninth when the
two teams reconvene on Monday,
April 15 at Sunken Diamond.
By all accounts, the Cardinal
should never have gotten itself
this predicament in the first
place, as the team gave up 8-0 and
10-2 leads to the overmatched
Wildcats.
In the game's first eight in
nings, the Cardinal continued to
hit the leather off the ball, with
Topham and junior designated
hitter Jason Cooper hitting home
runs and O'Riordan leading the
team with four hits.
Sophomore reliever David
O'Hagan was on the mound for
the Cardinal, while Wes ZlotofT
was throwing for Arizona as the
game was suspended.
With unfinished business hang
ing over the team's head, the Car
dinal will have a chance to quickly
move on as local rival San Jose
State (26-1 1, 6-6 Western Athletic
Conference) will be at Sunken Di
amond (in Tuesday night .
The game will get underway at
6 p.m. and will be broadcast on
KZSU, 90.1 FM.
