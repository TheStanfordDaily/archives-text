## The 						Marshall Plan 
### KENNETH GARRETT STAFF WRITER 
Neither fatigue nor jet lag nor the
freezing weather in Moscow could slow
down sophomore swimming phenome
non Peter Marshall. Me traveled to Russia
this week intending to make the United
States proud, and he didn't disappoint.
Just a few days before his first race in
Moscow and before he set a world
record in the 400-meter medley relay,
Marshall was stunning the competition
at the NCAA Men's Swimming Champi
onship in Athens, Ga. In addition to
winning his first individual N(L\A title in

the 100-yard backstroke, Marshall
joined Randall Bal, Andrew Schnell and
Bobby O'Bryan to set American and
NCAA records in the 200-yard freestyle
relay with a time of 1:16.49.
In fact, Marshall entered 7 races at
the NCAA Championships, and never
finished lower than second place.
"He had 14 swims at NCAAs includ
ing prelims, and that was a big example
of how much we depended on him
throughout the season," said sopho
more Nick Bott. "He was the workhorse
of the team, and we could count on him
to swim back, fly or free. No matter
what, he's able to get up on the blocks

and get the job done."
Team USA also feels the same way
about Marshall's versatility and stamina.
I le is bringing home a medal of each
color from Russia, including two golds.
"It's fun to get a little more experi
ence on the world level, and that's what
this meet is about for me," said Marshall.
Marshall made his first splash on the
international scene last summer at the
World University Games in Beijing.

record relay team.
broke three World University
Games records.
This week, in his first interna
tional meet in ihe short-course me
ters format, Marshall made a huge
impression on the swimming world.
The very first night, Marshall was a
member of the men's 400-meter
free relay along with Scott Tucker,
Jason Lezak and Southern Califor
nia's Klete Keller, which won gold
and set an American record in
3:10.(>4 seconds.
Later, Marshall took bronze in
die 100-meter backstroke behind
two world record holders, Aussie
Matt Welsh and teammate Aaron
I'iersol. I lis silver medal came in the
50-meter backstroke, which he
swam in 24.04 seconds.
"1 was trying to lie relaxed be
fore the race," said Marshall. "1
wanted to get the crowd into it to

get me ready, because it's only a 50
[meter race]."
But it was on the last day, in front
of a huge crowd, which included
Marshall's entire family, that the
sophomore really helped Team
USA shine.
In a race that saw the top two
teams swim under the previous
world-record time, the American
team of Aaron Peirsol, David Den
niston, Marshall and Jason Lezak
touched the wall at 3:29.00, setting a
new world record in the 400 meter
medley relay.
"This is just an amazing feeling,
I've never had anything like this,"
said ream USA's David Denniston.
"I don't know how to describe it; I'm
floating right now."
Marshall's Stanford teammates
are excited for him, and are also
very proud.
"The fact that he traveled nine
time zones, adjusted to that within
one day, set American and world
records, and took home all three
colors of medals is hard to fathom,"

said sophomore Michael Bruce.
"Peter really put in the work this
year to build the base to be able to do
that. It's veiy impressive."
Mar s h all's per form a nces
throughout the season have in
spired his teammates, and his per
formance this week just adds to
their respect for him.
"I le has definitely been a corner
stone for our team this year, said
Bott. "When we needed a big swim
to get people motivated, we could
count on him to have one of those
huge swims everybody could rally
behind."
Marshall arrives home tonight,
happy to have had a great experi
ence in Moscow and looking toward
the future.
"It's great to come here and get
into this meet, see where I am on the
world scene, and get set more
preparation for this summer's
meets," said Marshall.
Meets where Marshall is sure to
blow the competition out of the
water once again.

and set an American record in
3:10.(>4 seconds.
Later, Marshall took bronze in
die 100-meter backstroke behind
two world record holders, Aussie
Matt Welsh and teammate Aaron
I'iersol. I lis silver medal came in the
50-meter backstroke, which he
swam in 24.04 seconds.
"1 was trying to lie relaxed be
fore the race," said Marshall. "1
wanted to get the crowd into it to

get me ready, because it's only a 50
[meter race]."
But it was on the last day, in front
of a huge crowd, which included
Marshall's entire family, that the
sophomore really helped Team
USA shine.
In a race that saw the top two
teams swim under the previous
world-record time, the American
team of Aaron Peirsol, David Den
niston, Marshall and Jason Lezak
touched the wall at 3:29.00, setting a
new world record in the 400 meter
medley relay.
"This is just an amazing feeling,
I've never had anything like this,"
said ream USA's David Denniston.
"I don't know how to describe it; I'm
floating right now."
Marshall's Stanford teammates
are excited for him, and are also
very proud.
"The fact that he traveled nine
time zones, adjusted to that within
one day, set American and world
records, and took home all three
colors of medals is hard to fathom,"

said sophomore Michael Bruce.
"Peter really put in the work this
year to build the base to be able to do
that. It's veiy impressive."
Mar s h all's per form a nces
throughout the season have in
spired his teammates, and his per
formance this week just adds to
their respect for him.
"I le has definitely been a corner
stone for our team this year, said
Bott. "When we needed a big swim
to get people motivated, we could
count on him to have one of those
huge swims everybody could rally
behind."
Marshall arrives home tonight,
happy to have had a great experi
ence in Moscow and looking toward
the future.
"It's great to come here and get
into this meet, see where I am on the
world scene, and get set more
preparation for this summer's
meets," said Marshall.
Meets where Marshall is sure to
blow the competition out of the
water once again.
