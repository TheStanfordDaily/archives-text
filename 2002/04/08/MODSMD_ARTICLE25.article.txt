						Marshall Plan

Neither fatigue nor jet lag nor the
freezing weather in Moscow could slow
down sophomore swimming phenome
non Peter Marshall. Me traveled to Russia
this week intending to make the United
States proud, and he didn't disappoint.
Just a few days before his first race in
Moscow and before he set a world
record in the 400-meter medley relay,
Marshall was stunning the competition
at the NCAA Men's Swimming Champi
onship in Athens, Ga. In addition to
winning his first individual N(L\A title in

the 100-yard backstroke, Marshall
joined Randall Bal, Andrew Schnell and
Bobby O'Bryan to set American and
NCAA records in the 200-yard freestyle
relay with a time of 1:16.49.
In fact, Marshall entered 7 races at
the NCAA Championships, and never
finished lower than second place.
"He had 14 swims at NCAAs includ
ing prelims, and that was a big example
of how much we depended on him
throughout the season," said sopho
more Nick Bott. "He was the workhorse
of the team, and we could count on him
to swim back, fly or free. No matter
what, he's able to get up on the blocks

and get the job done."
Team USA also feels the same way
about Marshall's versatility and stamina.
I le is bringing home a medal of each
color from Russia, including two golds.
"It's fun to get a little more experi
ence on the world level, and that's what
this meet is about for me," said Marshall.
Marshall made his first splash on the
international scene last summer at the
World University Games in Beijing.
