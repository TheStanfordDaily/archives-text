### SARAH LINDSEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For most people, their first year on the job is
spent learning the ropes and struggling to keep
their head above water. But head coach Kristen
Smyth has done much more than just survive.
She has led her team to its second consecutive
trip to the NCAA Women's Gymnastics Cham
pionships in her first year at the Farm.

Saturday: No. 10 Stanford tied for first
place at the NCAA North Central Regional
Championships with 191.25 points

On Saturday, No. 10 Stanford tied for first
with No. 3 Georgia in the NCAA North Cen
tral Regional Championships with a team total
of 196.125.
The host school, No. 14 Denver, took third
at 196.000, followed by No. 23 Missouri in
fourth at 195.000, Air Force in fifth place with
a 193.775 and Utah State took sixth at 193.400.
"This was a tremendous meet, with an ex
ceptional effort," Smyth said. "Especially with
the help of the outstanding assistant coaches,
who teach the team new skills and keep them

excited and motivated."
This help from the assistant coaches was ev
ident on Saturday as the Cardinal came to
gether as a team and had an excellent meet.
Stanford started out strong on the floor
exercises, scoring a 49.300 to finish second
overall in the event and get its momentum
rolling. Following the floor routine, Stan
ford continued its strong performance, scor
ing a 49.075 in the vault to tie with Georgia
for first place.
After a bye in the rotation, Stanford picked
right hack up where it started on the bars. The
Cardinal scored a 49.325 to further its lead.
Sophomore Caroline Fluhrer, participating in
her first meet in almost two months due to an in
jury, t<K)k first place with a 9.925.
The Cardinal ended the night on the
beam. Although this is usually Stanford's
strongest event, it struggled somewhat in
Denver. Thanks to sophomores, Lise Fev
eille, Lindsay Wing, and Kendall Beck, Stan
ford was able to place third in the event and
tie for first place overall.
"The team's energy was great, and the team
dynamics were awesome," Wing said. "While it
was exciting that we tied for first, it is great that
we still have room to get better going into the
NCAA Championships."
Wing and senior Katy Herbert were the
only two Stanford gymnasts to compete in the
all-around. Scoring a 39.500, Wing led all com
petitors in the regional meet for the second
year in a row. Herbert earned a 38.825 score

and performed in her sixth all-around compe
tition of the season.
"I am so proud of the team," Smyth said.
"They fought the whole way and were aggres
sive from the start. Like Becky Meldrum said,
t hey were not going to let regionals be their last
meet."
Now that Stanford lias made it this far, it is
already preparing for what NCAA Champi
onships will be like. After getting into the hotel
at midnight on Saturday night and waking up
at 5 a.m. to make it to the airport, the team
went straight to the gym to practice.
"We are practicing for what is will be like for
the Super Six," Smyth said. "We have such an
unbelievable group of girls. They never com
plain, they work hard, they have high expecta
tions for themselves and it is an absolute plea
sure to work with them."
If the Cardinal places in the top three of the
six teams that they face in the morning session
of the NCAA Championships, it will advance to
the Super Six championship round, which will
be held the following day. By practicing so
soon after returning this weekend, it was simu
lating what that second day will feel like.
These determined gymnasts and coaches are
working hard because they have their eyes set on
not only proving themselves to the gymnastics
world, but also to everyone at Stanford.
"I am excited that we have two more op
portunities, with Nationals and the Super Six,
to show the community what Stanford gym
nastics is all about," Smyth said.
