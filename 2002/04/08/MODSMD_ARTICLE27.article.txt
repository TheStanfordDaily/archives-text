### KIRSTEN BOURNE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Obviously, scoring the most
goals is the key to winning a
lacrosse game. Then, the key to
scoring the most goals, is keeping
possession of the ball. The Stan
ford lacrosse team realized this im
portant strategy when it returned
home from Denver this Saturday
with a well-deserved 1 (5-8 win over
the Denver Pioneers.

LACROSSE
Saturday: Stanford 16, Denver 8

Saturday's game finally deliv
ered the level of possession the
Cardinal has been working all sea
son to achieve. When interviewed
after losing to Notre Dame on
March 9, head coach Michele
Uhlfelder voiced her discontent
with the team's ability to hold on to
the ball and, in doing so, to control
the momentum of the game.
"We just didn't maximize each
possession," she said.
Uhlfelder had also cited the
need for the Cardinal to get con
trol oft 1 le draws and maintain con
trol of the ball on offense in order
to dictate the momentum of the
game.
This Saturday's game should
have pleased Uhlfelder and her
team, which remained undefeated
in the Mountain Pacific Lacrosse
League (4-0) with an overall
record of 4-6. The win also put an
end to the four-game losing streak
the Cardinal had carried over
from spring break.
A highlight of the game came in

the stellar performances of 112 resh
man attackers Julia Calzonetti and
Kelsey Twist, who scored four and
three goals, respectively. Their
strong play has been a huge boost
to Stanford's attack this year, as
they lead the team in goals and as
sists. Calzonetti has 16 goals and 5
assists while Twist has 19 goals and
7 assists.
The Cardinal's success in con
trolling the momentum of the
game through maintaining posses

sion really kicked in when Stan
ford called a timeout with five min
utes remaining in the first half and
the score tied at four.
"Michele gave us a wakeup call
and urged us to step it up to the
higher level we were capable of,"
said sophomore defender Larissa
Conte.
From that pivotal point on it was
evident that the Cardinal was ready
to take control of the game. The
team netted four unanswered goals

in the last five minutes of the first
half and began the second halt with
three quick goals. The Cardinal
carried this momentum and kept
the ball on its scoring end for the
majority of the second half.
"We got momentum swinging our
way in the second half," said senior
attacker Liz Britt. "The attack held
on to the ball really well."
Conte also cited the team's abil-

ity to hold on to the ball as the key
to its success."
"Draw control was a huge lac
tor in the game," said Conte. "We
capitalized on draw controls and
ground balls, which had been our
big goal in practice the past few
weeks. This led to more possession
overall."
Next weekend, the Cardinal will
be put to the test again as it faces
rival California on Friday at 7 p.m.
before hosting a rematch against
Denver at 1 p.m. on Sunday.
