Each win was an essential victory, but
the last of the weekend proved to be the
clincher in the series sweep.
In its second game with Oregon State
the Cardinal took the field eager to fin
ish the weekend with a victory and its
first sweep of the conference season.
But the Cardinal entered the seventh
inning down 2-0.
Oregon State starter Monica Hoff
man had not given up an earned run in
her last 34 innings of pitching, includ
ing the first six of this game against the
hungry Stanford lineup.

However, the Cardinal offense
erupted in its last at-bat, scoring seven
runs on a seven-hit rally.
The attack began when senior first
baseman Sarah Beeson knocked a sin
gle up the middle to lead of the inning.
Junior second baseman Kira Ching fol
lowed Beeson by rocking her sixth
homer of the year over the left-field
fence, scoring freshman pinch-runner
Heather Shook, who had taken over for
Beeson on the bases.
Sophomore catcher Jessica Allister
stepped into the box and kept the rally
going with a single up the middle. Ju
nior leftfielder Cassi Brangham, no
stranger to producing in the clutch, fol
lowed with her own single, advancing
Allister to second.
Oregon State then replaced Hoff
man with Kristen Hunter on the rub
ber. Hunter struck out the next two
batters.
With the winning run on second base
and two outs, senior right fielder Jessica
Draemel produced under the pressure
with a single to left, loading the bases.
Shortstop Robin Walker continued
the senior-led rally at the plate as she
sent a shot to right center, driving in
three runs, placing herself on second
base and making the score 5-2.
Senior centerfielder Jessica Men
do/a topped off the offensive attack

with her 11th homer of the season,
knocking in Walker to increase the Car
dinal lead to 7-2.
Junior pitcher Tori Nyberg returned
to the circle for the final Beaver at-bat.
Nyberg shut down the opposition with
three straight outs to finish off the victo
ry for the Cardinal.
The Cardinal kicked off its ram
page against the Ducks on Friday af
ternoon. The Ducks, the only nn
ranked team in the Pac-10, were eager
to try and steal a victory from the
third-ranked Stanford squad and
notch what would be their first win of
the conference season.
Oregon put forth a battle, but the
Cardinal would not allow the upset as it
posted its first win of the weekend with
a 4-3 victory.
The next day, Stanford had its first
match-up'with Oregon State — a face
off that demonstrated the Cardinal's
ability to dominate.
Stanford scored seven runs while ju
nior pitcher Maureen LeCocq would not
allow a single Beaver to cross the plate to
earn her 13th win of the season and tuck
another shutout under her belt.
The Cardinal heads back to the Farm
with a winning conference record eager
to grab its first upset when it faces No.
