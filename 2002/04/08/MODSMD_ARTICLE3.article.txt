Yesterday, the Stanford
Coalition for Labor Justice un
veiled a mock time capsule as the
surprise finale to its rally protest
ing the treatment of Stanford
workers. Over 1000 Stanford
students, workers and members
of the local community marched
from Memorial Auditorium
down Palm Drive to the court
yard of Littlefield Management

Center at the Graduate School of
Business.
The procession was headed by
students carrying three large
puppets representing a worker,
passion for justice and the unifi
cation of students and workers.
Several students held a banner in
front of the puppets that read,
"Make Community a Priority:
Code of Conduct Now!" Protest
ers chanted for worker rights in

both English and Spanish.
"We're not protesting Commu
nity Day. We're excited that [Uni
versity] President [John] Hennessy
is making an effort to include the
community," said coalition press
contact Molly Goldberg. "We're
saying that one day isn't enough.
There are more people that
should be included in the Stanford
community than Hennessy is look
ing at right now."
"One day is not enough," said
Meghana Reddy, a member of the
coalition. "Right now at Stanford,
there are far too many workers
who serve our community and yet
are not paid enough to support
their families. This is no way to run
a world-class institution."
The goal of the protest, accord
ing to Goldberg, was to obtain the
right for students and workers to
meet with Hennessy to discuss a
worker code of conduct.
"[Hennessy] is not responsive
[to] the Code of Conduct and he
won't meet with workers to fliscuss
it," Goldberg said. "We're asking

lor a meeting with Hennessy with
workers included."
Hennessy said that student per
ception of his unwillingness to meet
with workers was "simply untrue."
"We have reiterated our com
mitment to meet with union repre
sentatives to discuss any aspect of
our existing contract at any time,"
Hennessy said. "We have not been
asked to meet with workers who
work with subcontractors."
Hennessy did not say whether he
would meet with students and
workers together or separately.
Juniors Carlmais Johnson and
Anwar Ragep saitl they found the
protest informative. "It's good
they're raising awareness for stu
dents and the entire Stanford com
munity which expands into Palo
Alto," they said.
Another student, Katherine
Eng, disagreed.
"I find when people present is
sues in a loud and disruptive man
ner, the message is lost," Eng said.
"I don't think it's an effective way
to get their message across."
Hennessy also said lie
thought the protest was ineffec
tive. "Protests do not seem like
the best way to express detailed
concerns," he said. "I think a

written document would be
more effective.".
At the end of the march, Pro
testers gathered at Littlefield to lis
ten to workers and students give a
set of speeches about the issues
faced by Stanford workers. Some
speakers provided information
about the labor campaign and the
reasons for the afternoon's protest ,
some discussed the purpose of
Community Day and others
shared similar worker issues that
they laced in work environments
other than Stanford.
The speeches concluded with
the opening of a mock time cap
sule. Each item in the capsule
symbolized an important mo
ment in history for each of the
groups which comprise the Stan
ford Coalition for Labor Justice:
the Stanford Labor Action Com
mittee, MEChA, the Black Stu
dent Union, the National Associa
tion for the Advancement of Col
ored People, Stanford Communi
ty for Peace and Justice, Students
for Environmental Action at Stan
lord, the Asian-American Stu
dents Association, the Queer-
Straight Social and Political Al
liance and the Pilipino-Ameiican
Student Union.
