# Stanford reaches out to community

### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford has been celebrating its founders
for over 100 years. Yesterday, though, the cel
ebration of the Stanford family became Com
munity Day for the first time. In recognition of
this, the University and the community heard
from Jane Stanford herselfâ€” by way of a time
capsule planted by Stanford in 1898 and
found in 2001 during the renovation of Build
ing 160.
Well over 1,000 people took part in the day's
festivities, as the campus was full of cultural,
academic and athletic events free for the public.
The celebration began at 10 a.m. with a special
service at Memorial Church and ran for five
hours before the closing Founders' Celebration
took place at the Mausoleum.
The ceremony featured remarks by Dean
for Religious Life Scotty McLennan, University
President John Hennessy and Chairman of the
Board of Trustees Isaac Stein, as well as two stu
dent speakers, sophomore Cody Page and
Sarah Shaw Middleton, a doctoral candidate in
civil and environmental engineering.
"I thought they did a marvelous job," said
Palo Alto resident Judy Frost, who came to see
the opening of the time capsule. "The com
ments were very nice."
Senior lecturer Patricia Ryan from the
Drama Department played the role of Jane
Stanford opening the capsule. She was assisted
by University Archivist Margaret Kimball and
Stein, who announced to the crowd each item
in the capsule.
The capsule contained two Bibles, University
coursebooks, a series of 1898 U.S. coins, assorted
newspapers, a long letter from Jane Stanford de
scribing the disputes over Leland Stanford's es
tate, a photograph of Thomas Welton Stanford,
who gave his inheritance to the University, a
hymn, University entrance examinations, com

mencement programs and a crucifix.
Like many in the crowd, Helms and his wife
Teri came to Community Day largely because
of the time capsule.
"We both entered guesses as to what was in
it," Helms said. Prior to the official opening of
the capsule, people could guess its contents on
line and potentially win prizes based on their
prognostications.
The afternoon had a relaxed, pleasant
mood, as visitors strolled the campus.

"The weather's fantastic and the crowd is
mellow," Mountain View resident Michael
Helms said. "This is like 'small town USA.'"
Although the time capsule was the biggest at
traction, there was no shortage of other things
to do and see. Visitors also sampled events like
concerts, art exhibits, a carnival for kids, facul
ty lectures and a health fair.
"I just heard a wonderful lecture," said Geor-

gia Schwarr of Palo Alto. "I think
it's a very good idea for the Uni
versity to use its resources to bene
fit the surrounding community."
The Founders' Celebration
was focused almost entirely on
Jane Stanford and her time cap
sule. Hennessy quoted Jane Stan
ford's vision: " Through all the
years ... 1 could see 100 years
ahead when all these trials were
forgotten and all that remained
was the institution."
