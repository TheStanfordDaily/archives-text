# ASSU initiates News Readership Program
## Brewer: 'Bridging the gap between Stanford and the larger community' 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
In an effort to burst the Stanford bubble, the
ASSU last week initiated the Stanford News
Readership Program, which provides free
copies of The New York Times and the San
Jose Mercury News to students.

Currently, approximately 500 copies of both
The Times and the Mercury News are being
distributed from Monday through Friday to 10
locations on campus, along with the copies of
The Daily usually placed there.
The ASSU worked in conjunction with
Housing and Dining Services and The Daily to
initiate the program, currently in a test period
that will last until April 30. Based upon the suc
cess of the one-month pilot program, the ASSU
will determine whether to continue the pro
gram permanently.
"One of the big things we talked about was
bridging the gap between Stanford and the
larger community," said junior Matt Brewer,

the ASSU president. "We wanted to burst the
bubble between student perspectives and
what's going on in the larger world."
Six of the 10 racks — at Wilbur, Florence
Moore, Lakeside, Manzanita, Rickerand Stern
— are dining halls. The other four — Building
260, the Gates Computer Science Building, the
Landau Economic Building and the Braun
Music Center — are locations that generate
substantial student traffic.
Based on ASSU statistics, the first four days
of the program have been overwhelmingly suc
cessful. Last Tuesday, the program's first day,
only 20 copies of The Times and
115 of The Mercury News were
left unread.
"I haven't heard any nega
tive feedback," Brewer said.
After being approached by USA
Today earlier this year, the ASSU
decided to initiate a campus news
readership program but opted for
one ollered by The New York
Times. According to Brewer, such
a program lit with one ol the goals
he discussed during his campaign
— connecting Stanford with com
munities outside of it — so the
ASSU looked into this program
and others like it.
Brewer explained that the
ASSU selected three newspapers
to offer a local, regional and na
tional perspective.
The ASSU has pnx ured the ma
jority of the funding for the pilot
program from the Provost's Office.
11 the program continues, it will
apply fora special lee. The ASSU is
also working to receive contribu
tions from outside the University.
According to freshman Joseph
Natoli, an ASSU executive aide,
the partnership allows the ASSU
to pay the lowest possible price for
the papers — 40 cents for each
copy ofThe Times and eight cents
for each copy of The Mercury
News, which sell on the newsstand
fbrsl and 25 cents, respectively.
Hie ASSU will use the results
from two surveys to gauge t he per
formance of the program, one in
the program's first week and one
at the end.
"If both of these [surveys] are
favorable — and the trend sug
gests they're overwhelmingly fa
vorable — we'll continue the

program," Brewer said.
Natoli said that the ASSU de
cided that the distribution of the
newspapers would most effectively
serve the purposes of the program
ii placed in the dining halls.
"Instead of it really causing lack
of discussion, it did the reverse,"
Natoli said, in response to the con
cern that providing the papers
would diminish socialization at
meals. "It caused more focused
discussion about issues outside of
Stanford," he said.
If the program continues, the
University will begin to receive ad
ditional benefits offered through
The Times program.
Freshman Sarah Schulman,
also an executive aide, said that
The limes program includes
sending journalists to campus to
talk with students as well as run
ning seminars with campus publi
cations such as The Daily.
"A part of it that I'm really in
terested in is the educational com
ponent," she said. "I'm really ex
cited at the prospect of having
these professionals come and
share their view of the world."
While the pilot program has
not brought papers to many
houses on the Row, students
who receive the papers in dining
halls overwhelmingly approved
of the program.
"Being here in the Stanford
bubble, you don't hear about any
thing that's going on," said fresh
man Silvia Cruz. "It's hard to
order a newspaper and read it,"
she said.
By and large, students ex
pressed gratitude at having access
to liee papers. Upon hearing that
if the program were to continue, it
would do so at marginal cost to stu
dents, freshman Dan Anthony
said, "Then keep it going. I love
my New York Times."
