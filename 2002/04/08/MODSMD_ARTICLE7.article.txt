### MICHELLE KELLER 
Starting today, the Muslim Stu
dents Awareness Network will hold
a series of events as part of a pro
gram, called Islam Awareness
Week, to provide the Stanford
community with a better under
standing of Islam. This year's
theme is "Islam in America"and
various activities will spotlight the
diverse Muslim community in the
United States and other countries.
Islam Awareness Week is a joint
effort between Stanford students
and local community members
and will feature a student panel
and several prominent speakers.
Imran Moinuddin, the week's
program coordinator, hopes stu
dents will take time to learn from
the activities.
"Although Islam is one of the
major religions of the world, peo
ple don't know enough about it.
We wish to reach out to our

neighbors and community and
show that Islam is an integral
part of this country," said Moin
uddin. "At the same time, we
wish to raise awareness about the
diversity of Muslims present in
every quarter of the world, such
as Latin America and China."
On Wednesday, Shaykh Ham/a
Yusuf Hanson, who served as an
advisor to President George W.
Bush after Sept. 11, will deliver the
keynote address. He is a lead orga
nizer of annual conferences and in
tensive Islamic study programs
and has dedicated himself to study
ing Arabic and Islam in the Middle
East. He will address issues raised
by the Sept. 11 tragedies.
Islam Awareness Week will
also feature Salat Al-Jum'ah',
congregational prayers led by
Hisham Abdallah at the Oval, as
well as a civil rights panel. Sohail
Yousuf, the spokesperson for the
network, says Friday's panelists
will discuss the "profiling of Arab
Americans, Muslim Americans
and people from the Indian sub
continent since Sept. 11Yousuf
will be a speaker in Monday's stu
dent panel addressing the differ
ent experiences students have
practicing Islam on campus.
The events kicked off with a
booth yesterday at Community
Day. Students were able to try on
different clothes from Muslim
countries around the world and
have their picture taken. By expos

ing the community to Islamic cul
tures and traditions, the Network
hopes to dispel negative stereo
types that exist about Muslims.
On Tuesday Religious Studies
Prof. Jacqueline Armijo-Hussein
will discuss Islam in China, where
over 50 million Muslims reside. On
Thursday, Daniel Denton, former
president and co-chair of MECIiA
of the University of the Pacific, will
speak about the Islamic communi

The network has worked hard
to organize this week to create an
atmosphere of acceptance in the
Stanford community. "We hope
to foster understanding and tol
erance and 1 think our program
will be successful in our goal,"
said Yousuf.
