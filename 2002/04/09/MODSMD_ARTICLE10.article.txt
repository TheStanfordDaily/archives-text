## The 						Stanford Daily Islam Awareness Week benefits University 
### 
Published Since 1891

The Muslim Students Awareness
Network yesterday launched a
week-long series of presentations,
workshops and panel discussions
on "Islam in America," part of a broader pro
gram called Islam Awareness Week. Stanford
Muslim students' desire to share their faith
— what they believe and how they practice
their convictions —is laudable. We hope
many people will avail themselves of the op
portunity to learn more about one of the
world's largest religions.
The network's effort, in addition to offering
a valuable chance to learn about Islam, is also
an encouraging sign. It exemplifies a healthy
trend on this campus towards increased reli
gious awareness among all students and in
creased involvement by religious students in
Stanford's community life. The fact is, religion
is relevant to the University.

Many of the issues and debates that have
touched Stanford just in the past year have a
decidedly religious component, or religious
implications. The horrors of Sept. 11 are but
the most ready example. Osama bin Laden
and his followers claim their terrorism is
prompted by the Koran. Millions of Muslims
around the world, including Muslims on this
campus, rightly dispute bin Laden's assertions.
Islam Awareness Week is being conducted in
the shadow of Sept. 11. Many of the program's
discussions will address the consequences of
that day's mass killings. This is appropriate.
What the Koran actually teaches and main
stream Muslims actually believe is vitally im
portant information for many students whose
only contact with Islamic doctrine would oth
erwise be the claims of al-Qaeda.
Sept. 11 and the struggle against terrorism
are certainly not the only issues with religious

implications. Homosexual rights, the rights
of laborers, cloning and the abortion debate,
which have so recently swirled across these
pages, are all topics strongly influenced by
various, often opposing, religious teachings.
It is difficult to carry on open-minded cam
pus conversation about these and similar is
sues without making room for the religious
views held by students, faculty and other dis
cussion participants.
When it comes to talking and even arguing
about controversial topics or current events,
students should welcome expressions of reli
gious viewpoints by their peers, not as a con
clusion to the conversation, but as a starting
point. Students of faith should be willing to ex
plain and defend their views, so that believer
and non-believer alike can participate in dia
logue and learn together.
In this regard, Dean of Religious Life Scotty

McLennan's ambition to make religious explo
ration and practice an integrated part ot cam
pus life is an important one. The Office of Re
ligious Life should continue to facilitate the
ability of religious groups to meet on campus
and encourage them to reach out to and inter
act with the broader community in a construc
tive manner.
The Religious Dean's office should devise
new ways and places for Stanford students to
explore various faiths — be it Islam, Judaism,
Hinduism — Christianity or any number of
others, and learn about their traditions and
doctrinal claims. This is a part of the broader
educational mission of the university.
Spiritual beliefs are a crucial aspect of the in
tellectual life and personal identities of many
members of the Stanford community. Events
like Islamic Awareness Week are encouraging
signs of that community's vitality.

I liis editorial represents the views of the members ofThe Daily's editorial board, 'l'he board consists of I he Daily's editor in chief, managing editor for daily special sections, two opinions
editors and three community members at-large. Signed columns and contributions are the view of the writer and do not necessarily represent the view of the editorial board.
