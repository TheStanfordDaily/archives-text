# SHOOTING FROM THE HIP
## Mountain biking fun 
### 
Take three parts exhilaration, two
parts concentration and one
part fear. Add a dash of sun
burn, a tablespoon of soreness,
and liberally garnish with cuts and bruises.
Shake well, and serve at upwards of 30
miles per hour. This is the basic recipe for
one of the coolest activities that you can do
around Stanford: mountain biking.
I went mountain biking for the first time
a few weeks ago. To be honest, it wasn't my
idea. A friend of mine, Duncan, talked me
into it. Duncan is a "hard-core" mountain
biker, a somewhat common breed around

here. I'm sure you all
know at least one of these
hard-core bikers. They're
the guys and gals who tool
around campus on
ridiculously high-tech
bikes, bikes that appear as
complex as Formula One
race cars but can travel
much faster. Of course,

hard-core bikers don't buy their bikes in
border to make boring trips across campus.
They buy them in order to raise holy hell in
-the mountains above Stanford.
I'd seen Duncan and his compatriots
return from their Saturday morning
rides, muddy and bloody, looking like
survivors of Iwojima. Their whole life is
a giant Mountain Dew commercial. In
fact, your average hard-core biker is liv
ing proof that Darwin was wrong â€” be
cause, by all logic, these people should
have been naturally selected out a long
time ago.
So at first 1 was a little apprehensive
when Duncan asked me to go riding with
him. I have a strong self-preservation in
stinct and have never had a desire to
break bones, tear tendons and collect
scars like some kind of perverse body art.
But Duncan can be very persuasive, and
my only alternative on that particular
Sunday was to write a term paper. Be
sides, I was a little curious as to what this
mountain biking deal was really all about.
And so it was that on a bright March
afternoon, Duncan and I took Page Mill
Rd. up into the mountains, parking at
the Montebello Preserve up on Skyline.
It's beautiful, wild country up there,
seemingly half a world away from the
manicured yuppieville of Palo Alto. Up
to this point, I was feeling good. I was
loose, I was eager, I had a Powerbar in
my pocket and a spring in my step.
Then I realized the actual ride hadn't
started yet.
The tough thing about mountain bik
ing is that it (obviously) takes place on
mountains, and gravity took the oppor
tunity to screw me over going up and

coming down. On the downhills, I
reached breakneck speeds, hurtling
down the rocky trails, my body shaking
like I was in some kind of giant popcorn
machine. Particularly on the steep down
hills, I developed a deep, almost reli
gious attachment to my brakes, as they
were the only things standing between
me and a long stay in Stanford Hospital.
The uphills were just the opposite. I'd
throw my bike into the lowest gear and
inch my way up the trail, pedaling furi
ously just to keep from falling over.
Meanwhile, I'd routinely get passed by
joggers, walkers, small insects, etc.
After a half an hour, I had come to the
conclusion that mountain biking is a very
exhausting and painful activity. However,
I should also add that it is a hell of a lot of
fun. The adrenaline rush you get from ca
reening down the trail is a fantastic natural
high. And even the grueling uphills have
a certain delicious anticipation about
them. It's like the long, slow ascent at the
start of roller coasters. No one likes the as
cent for its own sake, but it's exciting
nonetheless, because you know what's
waiting for you on the other side.
Plus, the mountain biking community
is a great group of people, and if you show
up at Skyline with a bike and a go-get 'em
attitude, you're automatically included. At
one trail junction, Duncan and I came
across another couple of bikers resting on
the shoulder. We sized each other up,
nodding approvingly at each other's
scrapes, bruises and mud splatters, and
then just sat down and shot the breeze for
about five minutes. Because after all, they
weren't really strangers. They were just
mountain biking buddies that we hadn't
actually met before.
So for anyone who's in a rut, feeling a
little bored with the routine of college, I
recommend grabbing your bike and
high-tailing it up to Skyline. Spend an af
ternoon pounding the trails, feeling the
adrenaline rush, even taking a few spills
in the name of good, clean fun. Scare the
bejesus out of some unsuspecting
wildlife. Forget about the normal cares
and worries of college, and devote all
your energy and concentration to beat
ing your friend up the next rise.
And if you happen to see me the next
day, be sure to flag me down and tell me
how it went. I'm pretty easy to spot. I'll
be the guy with the gash on his shin, rid
ing a mud-splattered bike with brake
pads worn down to the nub. Come to
think of it, you'll be another person who
fits that same description.
