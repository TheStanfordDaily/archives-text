Class of '06 represents
California's population
I read Paul Martino's letter in Mon
day's Daily, and I noticed a glaring logi
cal error. While Martino may be correct
that Caucasians represent 69 percent of
the U.S. population, white [non-hispan
ic] Caucasians represent less than half of
the population of California. Given that
California is the best represented region
in Stanford's undergraduate student
body, and that Stanford attracts students
from across the country who often find
California's diversity appealing, it is not
surprising that the admits of the Class of
2006 are 48 percent white.
Given that the ethnic distribution at
Stanford is actually quite similar to the eth
nic distribution of California, it would
seem that Martino's criticism is moot.

Foreign aid should be used
as leverage in Middle East
I applaud your willingness, through
the editorial published on April 5, to grap
ple with the tragic events that have beset
the Middle East in recent weeks. That
blighted region assuredly deserves our at
tention. Your suggestion that the United
States pursue a policy of greater engage
ment in the Levant is an important, if oft
repeated, observation.
You correcdy seize upon American for
eign aid largess as a possible basis for giv
ing incentive to Israel to consider again
the difficult concessions it proposed near
ly 22 months ago at the Camp David ne
gotiations engineered by Clinton and his
State Department.

To be certain, Sharon will he difficult to
persuade. Yet he has, at times, evidenced
a desire to maintain The United States'
favor by obliging its key demands.
It will he necessary to impress upon
Sharon the emerging American view
that the conflict is at a critical crossroads.
Hie United States should insist on cre
ative and bold compromise that per
suades Palestinians that statehood is not
long in the offing.
In a related vein, as Washington ex
tends its generosity to Middle East states
other than Israel, the fiscal lever should
be employed more broadly. Egypt,
which receives an annual American be
quest of approximately $2 billion, has re
cently all but eliminated its ties with Is
rael and distanced itself from the diplo
matic murmurings that must be nur
tured if the Israelis and Palestinians are
to extricate themselves from the present
grim cycle of tribal truculence.
Egypt is the most populous Arab state
and is an important Arab cultural center.
Its regional influence is unquestioned.
Jordan is another significant beneficiary
of American aid that has, over the past
several months, remained largely unin
volved in efforts to facilitate Israeli-
Palestinian negotiation.
Neither Hosni Mubarak nor King Ab
dullah II attended the Arab League
Summit in Beirut last month. On Satur
day in Cairo, in an unabashed rebuff of
repeated entreaties by President George
W. Bush to repudiate terror attacks
against innocents, both Egypt and Jor
dan signed on to a statement of Arab for
eign ministers which characterized mass
murder of Israeli civilians as "resistance"
by "courageous" Palestinians.
American funding of these two
regimes, initiated as a reward for estab
lishing relations with Israel, is meant, in

the main, to purchase regional stability
in the Middle East promote public advo
cacy ol peace negotiations. The United
States must demand a greater return on
this investment.
As virtually every regime in the Middle
East appears to have appropriated the Is
raeli-Palestinian conflict as its own, a me
diated resolution will only succeed if it en
joys broad regional support. The central
lesson that must be drawn from the failed
Camp David negotiations is that, in the ab
sence of meaningful political cover from
the Arab world, Arafat cannot or will not
accept a deal with Ehud Barak / Abdullah
contours. It is appropriate to make plain
to Egypt and Jordan an American expec
tation that the two countries denounce
Palestinian terrorism as illegitimate while
strongly and publicly lobbying Arafat and
the Arab public in behalf of Secretary of
State Colin Powell's upcoming diplomatic
initiative in the Middle East.
Hopefully, such efforts will forge a
sense of inevitability throughout the re
gion with respect to Powell's mission. Per
haps peace, at long last, will be at hand.
1 he alternative is unspeakably ruinous.
With the dispatch of Powell, the United
States is investing significant diplomatic
prestige in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
It is doing so even as regional volatility es
calates alarmingly. This is a moment of
truth for all parties concerned.
If Powell's effort is seen to founder,
Bush may again honor his minimalist im
pulse concerning Middle East diplomatic
engagement and withdraw the American
peacemaking apparatus from the region.
As a consequence, the beleaguered people
of the region would be plunged into what
will seem a final chapter of darkness.
