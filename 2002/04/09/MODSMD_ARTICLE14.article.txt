The No. 4 Stanford women's
tennis team's matches against No.
13 Southern California and No. 7
UCLA last weekend at the Taube
Family Tennis Center did not
count in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence standings.

WOMEN'S TENNIS
Friday: No. 4 Stanford defeat
ed No. 13 USQ 6-1
Saturday: No. 4 Stanford de
feated No. 7 UCLA, 6-1

But given the chance to make a
statement against its toughest op
ponents in the Pac-10, the Cardi
nal (18-1) rackets were out in full
force on Friday and Saturday, as
Stanford rolled to 6-1 victories
over the Women of Troy (14-5)
and the Bruins (13-3).
"The bigger the match, the bet
ter we are," senior Keiko Tokuda
said. "A lot of teams get intimidat
ed and you can sense it out there.
There are very few teams that
come out looking and feeling con
fident against us."
Both teams came out confident

ly, but iii the end, Stanford left
both visiting schools frustrated.
On Friday, Stanford slugged it
out with the Women of Troy and
jumped ahead early with wins in
all three doubles matches.
Seniors Lauren Kalvaria and
Gabriela Lastra, the nation's No. 2
doubles team, outlasted USC's No.
4 Tiffany Brymer and Jewel Peter
son, 8-6, in an excellently played
first flight match.
The No. 14 team of sophomore
Lauren Barnikow and freshman
Erin Burdette also prevailed
against No. 19 Anita Loyola and
Luana Magnani by an 8-6 margin.
Tokuda and freshman Story
Tweedie-Yates overmatched Mau
reen Diaz and Melissa Esmero, 8-3.
At the No. 1 singles spot, No. 5
Peterson came from behind to de
feat No. 10 Kalvaria, 1-6, 6-4, 6-4,
for USC's only team point.
No. 18 Lastra went three sets
against No. 31 Magnani, winning
6-1,3-6, 6-1, and No. 14 Barnikow
put away No. 88 Diaz, 6-2,6-2.
As it has been all year, Stan
ford's depth was apparent as the
Cardinal easily won the bottom
three singles matches. No. 24 Bur
dette beat Loyola, 6-0, 6-7, 6-3;
Tokuda outplayed Brymer, 6-2,6-

2; and sophomore Emilia Ander
son took care of Esmero, 6-2, 6-2.
Having already seen both the
Bruins and the Women of Troy
this year, the Cardinal was already
familiar with both squads and was
well-prepared for the weekend.
"They were about as good as we
expected," Burdette said.
Nonetheless, UCLA surprised
the Cardinal on Saturday, winning
two of three doubles matches to
grab a 1 -0 lead.
Kalvaria and Lastra looked
sharp against UCLA's No. 3 tan
dem of Petya Marinova and Sara
Walker, winning 8-4.
However, Barnikow and Bur
dette struggled against No. 6
Megan Bradley and Lauren Fish
er, falling behind 4-0 and 6-1. The
Cardinal pair battled back to 7-6,
but UCLA closed out the match on
its serve, 8-6.
Tokuda and Tweedie-Yates
also fell, losing 8-3 to Mariko Fritz-
Krockow and Catherine Hawley.
"We were definitely a little ner
vous," Burdette said. "It got us
pumped up for singles, though."
I he Cardinal was very impressive
in singles play, dismantling their op
ponents and any confidence they had
built in doubles play.

"We won all the first sets in our
singles matches, which really made
a statement to them," Tokuda said.
Kalvaria led the squad in sin
gles, frustrating the powerful
Megan Bradley, ranked No. 4,
with a 6-4, 2-6, 6-3 win.
Lastra stunned No. 7 Walker,
swiftly recording a 6-0, 6-3 victory,
and Barnikow persevered against
Marinova, 6-1, 4-6, 6-1.
The bottom half of the lineup
did its part as well, as Burdette out
classed Fisher, 6-3, 6-2, and Toku
da dealt with Hawley in straight
sets, 6-3,6-4.
Anderson withstood Fritz-
Krockow's late rally, sewing up a 6-
3, 5-7, 6-3 win.
"It was great," Burdette said.
"[Losing the doubles point] was a
good situation for us to be put into."
"This was one of our first tests,"
Tokuda said. "This team has al
ways been a strong team in regards
to tough matches."
As always, though, the Cardi
nal squad must avoid compla
cency as this weekend's home
matches against No. 34 Arizona
and No. 11 Arizona State loom
on the horizon.
"Everyone's going to be ready
to go," Tokuda said.

expected," Burdette said.
Nonetheless, UCLA surprised
the Cardinal on Saturday, winning
two of three doubles matches to
grab a 1 -0 lead.
Kalvaria and Lastra looked
sharp against UCLA's No. 3 tan
dem of Petya Marinova and Sara
Walker, winning 8-4.
However, Barnikow and Bur
dette struggled against No. 6
Megan Bradley and Lauren Fish
er, falling behind 4-0 and 6-1. The
Cardinal pair battled back to 7-6,
but UCLA closed out the match on
its serve, 8-6.
Tokuda and Tweedie-Yates
also fell, losing 8-3 to Mariko Fritz-
Krockow and Catherine Hawley.
"We were definitely a little ner
vous," Burdette said. "It got us
pumped up for singles, though."
I he Cardinal was very impressive
in singles play, dismantling their op
ponents and any confidence they had
built in doubles play.

"We won all the first sets in our
singles matches, which really made
a statement to them," Tokuda said.
Kalvaria led the squad in sin
gles, frustrating the powerful
Megan Bradley, ranked No. 4,
with a 6-4, 2-6, 6-3 win.
Lastra stunned No. 7 Walker,
swiftly recording a 6-0, 6-3 victory,
and Barnikow persevered against
Marinova, 6-1, 4-6, 6-1.
The bottom half of the lineup
did its part as well, as Burdette out
classed Fisher, 6-3, 6-2, and Toku
da dealt with Hawley in straight
sets, 6-3,6-4.
Anderson withstood Fritz-
Krockow's late rally, sewing up a 6-
3, 5-7, 6-3 win.
"It was great," Burdette said.
"[Losing the doubles point] was a
good situation for us to be put into."
"This was one of our first tests,"
Tokuda said. "This team has al
ways been a strong team in regards
to tough matches."
As always, though, the Cardi
nal squad must avoid compla
cency as this weekend's home
matches against No. 34 Arizona
and No. 11 Arizona State loom
on the horizon.
"Everyone's going to be ready
to go," Tokuda said.

No. 14 Lauren Barnikow and the No. 4 Stanford women's tennis team cruised past No. 7 UCLA and No. 13 (JSC at the Taube Family Tennis Center this
weekend. Barnikow won both her singles matches, defeating No. 88 Maureen Diaz of USC on Friday and UCLA's Petya Marinova on Saturday.
The No. 4 Stanford women's
tennis team's matches against No.
13 Southern California and No. 7
UCLA last weekend at the Taube
Family Tennis Center did not
count in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence standings.

WOMEN'S TENNIS
Friday: No. 4 Stanford defeat
ed No. 13 USQ 6-1
Saturday: No. 4 Stanford de
feated No. 7 UCLA, 6-1

But given the chance to make a
statement against its toughest op
ponents in the Pac-10, the Cardi
nal (18-1) rackets were out in full
force on Friday and Saturday, as
Stanford rolled to 6-1 victories
over the Women of Troy (14-5)
and the Bruins (13-3).
"The bigger the match, the bet
ter we are," senior Keiko Tokuda
said. "A lot of teams get intimidat
ed and you can sense it out there.
There are very few teams that
come out looking and feeling con
fident against us."
Both teams came out confident

ly, but iii the end, Stanford left
both visiting schools frustrated.
On Friday, Stanford slugged it
out with the Women of Troy and
jumped ahead early with wins in
all three doubles matches.
Seniors Lauren Kalvaria and
Gabriela Lastra, the nation's No. 2
doubles team, outlasted USC's No.
4 Tiffany Brymer and Jewel Peter
son, 8-6, in an excellently played
first flight match.
The No. 14 team of sophomore
Lauren Barnikow and freshman
Erin Burdette also prevailed
against No. 19 Anita Loyola and
Luana Magnani by an 8-6 margin.
Tokuda and freshman Story
Tweedie-Yates overmatched Mau
reen Diaz and Melissa Esmero, 8-3.
At the No. 1 singles spot, No. 5
Peterson came from behind to de
feat No. 10 Kalvaria, 1-6, 6-4, 6-4,
for USC's only team point.
No. 18 Lastra went three sets
against No. 31 Magnani, winning
6-1,3-6, 6-1, and No. 14 Barnikow
put away No. 88 Diaz, 6-2,6-2.
As it has been all year, Stan
ford's depth was apparent as the
Cardinal easily won the bottom
three singles matches. No. 24 Bur
dette beat Loyola, 6-0, 6-7, 6-3;
Tokuda outplayed Brymer, 6-2,6-

2; and sophomore Emilia Ander
son took care of Esmero, 6-2, 6-2.
Having already seen both the
Bruins and the Women of Troy
this year, the Cardinal was already
familiar with both squads and was
well-prepared for the weekend.
"They were about as good as we
expected," Burdette said.
Nonetheless, UCLA surprised
the Cardinal on Saturday, winning
two of three doubles matches to
grab a 1 -0 lead.
Kalvaria and Lastra looked
sharp against UCLA's No. 3 tan
dem of Petya Marinova and Sara
