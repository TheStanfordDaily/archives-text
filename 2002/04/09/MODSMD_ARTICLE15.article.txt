meet to represent their home
state in the California vs. Ari

ed the Grand Canyon state, but
both the men's and women's
teams from California prevailed
by scores of 106-97 and 130.5-
71.5, respectively.
High winds made fast times
difficult to achieve, but the Car
dinal was still able to post sever
al NCAA qualifying marks.
"The race on Saturday
turned out to be more of an op
portunity for competitive efforts
than for qualifying times," said
senior middle-distance runner
Maurica Carlucci. "The wind in
Tucson was unbelievably bad.
As a result, the races were more
about position than time."
Carlucci obviously managed
her own position quite well, tak
ing first place in the women's
800 meters in a time of 2 min
utes, 11.47 seconds.

173 feet, 4 inches, placing sec

her provisionally for the NCAA
Championships.
Also grabbing a provisional
mark was sophomore Jessica
Pinth, who placed fourth in the
hammer with a throw of 180-11.
Sophomore J illian Camarena
again delivered an outstanding
performance in the shot put.
Camarena earned an NCAA au
tomatic qualifying mark, which

she had already attained coming
into this weekend, with a sec
ond-place throw of 52-11 1/2.
Another member of Stan
ford's strong throwing contin

placed second in the javelin with
a throw of 134-2.
Rounding off the Stanford
women's slew of provisional
qualifiers was junior Kathleen
Donoghue with her jump of 13-
1 1/2 in the pole vault.
Several Cardinal perfor
mances did not make NCAA
qualifying standards but
nonetheless placed high in the
standings and helped lift the
California team over Arizona.
Junior Kimberly Stone fin
ished second in the high jump
with a mark of 5-5, while Shan
non Overly's mark of3B-9 3/4 in
the triple jump earned her
fourth place.
