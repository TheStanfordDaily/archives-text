### MAUREEN MULLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
After securing six of the past seven Pacific 10 Con
ference titles, and live of the past seven NCAA cham
pionships, sometimes it is a little hard for fans to real
ize that the Stanford men's tennis team (16-2) is vul
nerable to one of the founding principles of sport —
losing.

However, while things may usually seem to simply
fall into place from the fan's perspective, the Stanford
men know they can never take anything for granted —
especially during the annual trip down to Los Angeles
to face UCLA and Southern California.
As the perennial powers of men's tennis, these big
three of sorts have been beating up on each other since
the 19605, attempting to establish a singular domi
nance over collegiate tennis.
Last weekend's trip was no exception, as the No.
6 Stanford squad was brutalized by No. 19 (JSC, 6-
1, on Friday, only to come back on Saturday to pull
an upset of its own with a 5-2 defeat of the No. 2 Bru
ins. Both matches did not count toward the Pac-10
standings.

MEN'S TENNIS
Friday: No. 19 USC defeated No. 6 Stanford, 6-1
Saturday: No. 6 Stanford defeated No. 2
UCLA, 5-2
Today: No. 6 Stanford vs. No. 22 California,
3:00 p.m., Berkeley

Junior David Martin was the premier Cardinal per
former, emerging as the only Stanford player to re
main undefeated in both singles and doubles play on
the weekend.
In arguably the most exciting match of the week
end, Martin teamed with junior Scott Lipsky to nar
rowly notch a 9-8 win over the seventh-ranked USC
duo of Ryan Moore and Nick Rainey.
However, while Lipsky / Martin notched the win
and largely secured their status as the top-ranked pair
in the country, the other Stanford doubles teams fell in
tight matches, allowing the Trojans to claim the dou
bles point.
The Cardinal woes continued into singles competi
tion, as Martin was the only Stanford player to record
a victory. Martin pushed past Moore in straight sets, 6-
4, 6-3.
But Saturday was a different day for Stanford, and
while Martin continued his hot ways, this time his
teammates mostly followed suit.
All three of the Cardinal doubles teams record
ed wins over the Bruin pairs, with the freshmen
duo of Phil Sheng and Sam Warburg putting up
the most impressive victory, sailing past the UCIA
pair of Nick Kreiss and Ryan McNaughton, 8-0, at
the No. 3 spot.
In singles play the Stanford domination continued
as the Cardinal won four of the six matches to secure
the win on the day.
Again, No. 46 Martin stole the highlights, capping
an impressive weekend with an upset of 15th-ranked
Marcin Matkowski, 6-4,1-6,6-3. Lipsky, Warburg and
Sheng also recorded wins for Stanford.

No. 4 KJ. Hippensteel lost both his singles matches as No.
6 Stanford was hot and cold against No. 19 USC and No.
2 UCLA. The Trojans crushed the Cardinal, 6-1, on Friday,
but Stanford blew away UCLA, 5-2, on Saturday.
