# ASSU starts outreach program
## 
### JOHN HUETTER EDITORIAL STAFF 
A week ago, ASSU President Matt Brewer initiated
what he called one of the biggest publicity campaigns
since the ASSU split into the Undergraduate Senate
and the Graduate Student Council in 1999. One
thousand color postcards and 1000 flyers — in color
and on expensive paper stock — were distributed
around campus to inform students what the ASSU
does for them.
The question now, on the eve of the ASSU elections
campaign, is whether or not the students have even
noticed. Have Stanford students responded to the
ASSU's increased efforts to reach them this year?
Brewer believes they have. "We've worked a lot
more with the average non-elected student," he said.
"If you don't work with students, you can't work for
students."
Brewer cited his new ASSU Community Team as
one example of outsiders taking a new interest in
the ASSU. Initially, ASSU staff had to encourage
students to join programs like the team. However,
students soon began joining of their own volition.
"Once we did that initial pull, a lot of people got in
volved and told their friends and it kind of perpet
uated," Brewer said.
Currendy, the team consists of 50 members. Ten
were recruited and about 15 more are ASSU staffers
such as freshman executive aides. The remaining 25,
however, joined on their own accord. The group has

worked on such items as campus transportation, the
News Readership Program and the Faculty Diversity
Task Force.
"I think that small group of students has a new
faith in the ASSU," Brewer said.
Fhe Senate has also been working to bring non
elected students to participate, said senior Alex
Shvartsman, Senate Deputy Chair, though he recog
nized that inspiring students wasn't easy.
"No one in the ASSU is exasperated that we're not
getting student. . . responses to the ASSU," Shvarts
man said. "If the Athletics Department is having diffi
culty exciting students, it's difficult to excite people
about student government."
Nevertheless, Shvartsman has noticed a greater re
sponse to the ASSU in the student body. "People are
starting to get a better understanding of what the
ASSU performs," Shvartsman said.
Shvartsman felt that this year's freshmen and fu
ture students might respond in a more positive way
and bring "a fresh look to the ASSU, one that hasn't
been beat up by all the criticism."
" Fhe cynical generation is graduating or on their
way to graduation," Shvartsman said.
Me said this year's freshman Senate associates have
been very active, "arguably more so than most of the
senators," he said.
Nevertheless, some students give up on the body as
early as sophomore year.
"The organization is kind of a
mystery to me," said sophomore
Andy Chen, who said the ASSU
ought to expand communication
with students. Chen admitted,
however, that he couldn't come up
with an easy way to bring non
elected student interest to the
ASSU.
"Honestly, I suppose from a
practical point of view, there's no
way they can get to the entire stu
dent [body]," Chen said.
He said that students who forfeit
ed their right to speak to the ASSU
couldn't necessarily complain.
Chen offered a few potential so
lutions, such as holding more
prominent events and attempting
to reach students early in their
Stanford careers.

"If you try and introduce them
to the organization later, they
might not care," Chen said.
The graduate response
Though finding 15 candidates
to sit on the Graduate Student
Council can be problematic, the
body — the third branch of the
ASSU — has generally received
greater response from its con
stituency than the Undergraduate
Senate has experienced.
"The [council] has a lot more
leverage with graduate students
than the Undergraduate Senate
has with undergraduates,"
Brewer said.
According to Brewer, though,
only 16 percent of the graduate
population votes in ASSU elec
tions. One of the ASSU's goals
will be to bring this percentage
up to 30 percent in next week's
election.
Felipe Santos, the Graduate

Student Council chair, said the
council "strives to be very close to
the graduate population."
He said the council sends
quarterly bulletins to each gradu
ate student's home and uses de
partmental mailing lists for time
sensitive information. "We cur
rently send about one e-mail per
week," said Santos, a doctoral
candidate in management sci
ence and engineering.
Santos said that non-elected
graduate students are often partic
ipants in the council. While the
core council consists of 15 elected
members, Santos noted that about
10 to 15 graduate students serve
consistently as active council mem
bers, "showing up regularly at the
meetings and working on specific
issues or events."
"It is frequent to have new stu
dents coming to our meetings to
express particular problems or
concerns or just to get involved in

the [council]," Santos said.
Florian Jaeger, a first-year doc
toral candidate in linguistics, said
he currently doesn't know too
much about the council or its work,
though he does read its e-mails.
However, he said he has consid
ered running for"the body" next
year.
Jaeger said he didn't have much
contact with the council but that he
would use it if necessary.
Santos said that his fellow grad
uate students contact him and
other council members with both
praise and criticism.
"Usually students contact us by
e-mail, compliment on our current
efforts on a specific area and pre
sent their own views on the issue,
which are sometimes different
from the positions we've taken at
the council," Santos said. "We take
this feedback very seriously into
considerations when we discuss
the issue again."

Nevertheless, some students give up on the body as
early as sophomore year.
"The organization is kind of a
mystery to me," said sophomore
Andy Chen, who said the ASSU
ought to expand communication
with students. Chen admitted,
however, that he couldn't come up
with an easy way to bring non
elected student interest to the
ASSU.
"Honestly, I suppose from a
practical point of view, there's no
way they can get to the entire stu
dent [body]," Chen said.
He said that students who forfeit
ed their right to speak to the ASSU
couldn't necessarily complain.
Chen offered a few potential so
lutions, such as holding more
prominent events and attempting
to reach students early in their
Stanford careers.

"If you try and introduce them
to the organization later, they
might not care," Chen said.
The graduate response
Though finding 15 candidates
to sit on the Graduate Student
Council can be problematic, the
body — the third branch of the
ASSU — has generally received
greater response from its con
stituency than the Undergraduate
Senate has experienced.
"The [council] has a lot more
leverage with graduate students
than the Undergraduate Senate
has with undergraduates,"
Brewer said.
According to Brewer, though,
only 16 percent of the graduate
population votes in ASSU elec
tions. One of the ASSU's goals
will be to bring this percentage
up to 30 percent in next week's
election.
Felipe Santos, the Graduate

Student Council chair, said the
council "strives to be very close to
the graduate population."
He said the council sends
quarterly bulletins to each gradu
ate student's home and uses de
partmental mailing lists for time
sensitive information. "We cur
rently send about one e-mail per
week," said Santos, a doctoral
candidate in management sci
ence and engineering.
Santos said that non-elected
graduate students are often partic
ipants in the council. While the
core council consists of 15 elected
members, Santos noted that about
10 to 15 graduate students serve
consistently as active council mem
bers, "showing up regularly at the
meetings and working on specific
issues or events."
"It is frequent to have new stu
dents coming to our meetings to
express particular problems or
concerns or just to get involved in

the [council]," Santos said.
Florian Jaeger, a first-year doc
toral candidate in linguistics, said
he currently doesn't know too
much about the council or its work,
though he does read its e-mails.
However, he said he has consid
ered running for"the body" next
year.
Jaeger said he didn't have much
contact with the council but that he
would use it if necessary.
Santos said that his fellow grad
uate students contact him and
other council members with both
praise and criticism.
"Usually students contact us by
e-mail, compliment on our current
efforts on a specific area and pre
sent their own views on the issue,
which are sometimes different
from the positions we've taken at
the council," Santos said. "We take
this feedback very seriously into
considerations when we discuss
the issue again."
A week ago, ASSU President Matt Brewer initiated
what he called one of the biggest publicity campaigns
since the ASSU split into the Undergraduate Senate
and the Graduate Student Council in 1999. One
thousand color postcards and 1000 flyers — in color
and on expensive paper stock — were distributed
around campus to inform students what the ASSU
does for them.
The question now, on the eve of the ASSU elections
campaign, is whether or not the students have even
noticed. Have Stanford students responded to the
ASSU's increased efforts to reach them this year?
Brewer believes they have. "We've worked a lot
more with the average non-elected student," he said.
"If you don't work with students, you can't work for
students."
Brewer cited his new ASSU Community Team as
one example of outsiders taking a new interest in
the ASSU. Initially, ASSU staff had to encourage
students to join programs like the team. However,
students soon began joining of their own volition.
"Once we did that initial pull, a lot of people got in
volved and told their friends and it kind of perpet
uated," Brewer said.
Currendy, the team consists of 50 members. Ten
were recruited and about 15 more are ASSU staffers
such as freshman executive aides. The remaining 25,
however, joined on their own accord. The group has

worked on such items as campus transportation, the
News Readership Program and the Faculty Diversity
Task Force.
"I think that small group of students has a new
faith in the ASSU," Brewer said.
Fhe Senate has also been working to bring non
elected students to participate, said senior Alex
Shvartsman, Senate Deputy Chair, though he recog
nized that inspiring students wasn't easy.
"No one in the ASSU is exasperated that we're not
getting student. . . responses to the ASSU," Shvarts
man said. "If the Athletics Department is having diffi
culty exciting students, it's difficult to excite people
about student government."
Nevertheless, Shvartsman has noticed a greater re
sponse to the ASSU in the student body. "People are
starting to get a better understanding of what the
ASSU performs," Shvartsman said.
Shvartsman felt that this year's freshmen and fu
ture students might respond in a more positive way
and bring "a fresh look to the ASSU, one that hasn't
been beat up by all the criticism."
" Fhe cynical generation is graduating or on their
way to graduation," Shvartsman said.
Me said this year's freshman Senate associates have
been very active, "arguably more so than most of the
senators," he said.
Nevertheless, some students give up on the body as
early as sophomore year.
"The organization is kind of a
mystery to me," said sophomore
Andy Chen, who said the ASSU
