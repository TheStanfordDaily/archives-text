# ASSU starts outreach program
## 
### JOHN HUETTER EDITORIAL STAFF 
A week ago, ASSU President Matt Brewer initiated
what he called one of the biggest publicity campaigns
since the ASSU split into the Undergraduate Senate
and the Graduate Student Council in 1999. One
thousand color postcards and 1000 flyers — in color
and on expensive paper stock — were distributed
around campus to inform students what the ASSU
does for them.
The question now, on the eve of the ASSU elections
campaign, is whether or not the students have even
noticed. Have Stanford students responded to the
ASSU's increased efforts to reach them this year?
Brewer believes they have. "We've worked a lot
more with the average non-elected student," he said.
"If you don't work with students, you can't work for
students."
Brewer cited his new ASSU Community Team as
one example of outsiders taking a new interest in
the ASSU. Initially, ASSU staff had to encourage
students to join programs like the team. However,
students soon began joining of their own volition.
"Once we did that initial pull, a lot of people got in
volved and told their friends and it kind of perpet
uated," Brewer said.
Currendy, the team consists of 50 members. Ten
were recruited and about 15 more are ASSU staffers
such as freshman executive aides. The remaining 25,
however, joined on their own accord. The group has

worked on such items as campus transportation, the
News Readership Program and the Faculty Diversity
Task Force.
"I think that small group of students has a new
faith in the ASSU," Brewer said.
Fhe Senate has also been working to bring non
elected students to participate, said senior Alex
Shvartsman, Senate Deputy Chair, though he recog
nized that inspiring students wasn't easy.
"No one in the ASSU is exasperated that we're not
getting student. . . responses to the ASSU," Shvarts
man said. "If the Athletics Department is having diffi
culty exciting students, it's difficult to excite people
about student government."
Nevertheless, Shvartsman has noticed a greater re
sponse to the ASSU in the student body. "People are
starting to get a better understanding of what the
ASSU performs," Shvartsman said.
Shvartsman felt that this year's freshmen and fu
ture students might respond in a more positive way
and bring "a fresh look to the ASSU, one that hasn't
been beat up by all the criticism."
" Fhe cynical generation is graduating or on their
way to graduation," Shvartsman said.
Me said this year's freshman Senate associates have
been very active, "arguably more so than most of the
senators," he said.
Nevertheless, some students give up on the body as
early as sophomore year.
