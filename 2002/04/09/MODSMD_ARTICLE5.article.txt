Flying water balloons, garish
chalk slogans, megaphones, and il
legally parked cars — if the first
day is any indication, it ought to be
a rather interesting election.
Representatives of 53 special fee
candidates, 5 ASSU Presidential
slates, 27 ASSU Undergraduate
Senate candidates, and nine class
presidential slates converged on
White Plaza yesterday, some camp
ing out from as early as 7:30 a.m. for
the 2002 ASSU election's midnight
kickoff.

for the ASSU Undergraduate Sen

"It's been a pretty intense scene
out here," said presidential candi
date Mike Osofsky, a junior. "In the
two years that I've been around, this
is the craziest."
" It's kind of crazy, but it's the way
the system seems to work," said ju

presidential slate 4-Play.

somewhat ironic moment, the
Elections Commission removed
the Kids With Dreams banner to
make way for those of aspiring
candidates.
In addition, a banner reminis
cent of a baseball card holder was
hung, allowing space for all 27 Sen
ate candidates to hang a flyer.
The campaigning was made
even more hectic by the last-sec
ond lifting by Residential Educa
tion of the ban on flyers on resi
dence bathroom stalls. Thanks to
negotiations by Brewer, candi
dates may now hang one (Iyer per
every two bathroom stalls on inte
rior bathroom stall doors.
Given that students can sudden

ering really matter?
"1 think this matters," Osofsky
said. "I thinkit'scertainly important
to have a presence in White Plaza."
"This gets so saturated that it re
ally ceases to have any efficacy on
voters," said Benson.
"I'm more in it lor the tradition,"
agreed Senate candidate Dan
Wendlandt, a freshman. '
"People expect it out here,"
said junior led Williams, who
was wandering about visiting fly
ering friends.
Rodriguez said it depended on
who was flyering. "For Senate can
didates, it matters hugely. For Pres
idential candidates, [students] are
going to know our names after a lit
tle while after being pounded over
the head with them."
Stanford Chaparral candidates
Perry and Steinberg arrived late,
brandishing a megaphone and
shouting "Violation!" at all the fly
erers nervously waiting the 12:01
start time.

Staying and flyering would be
a further violation, he said.
"You're going to have to go home
or do whatever you want," Perry
proclaimed.
Throughout the night, they con
tinued to make bullhorn-amplified
announcements. " This Edwin
Drood guy is going to win whatever
he [expletive] wants," Perry noted
to the crowd, referring to a Rams'
Head poster. "His posters are all
over the place."
Finally, midnight occurred. With
a cheer, students taped flyers to
every available surface in White
Plaza and began campaigns which
would last late into the night.
"This is fun," Brewer said, laugh
ing, "1 love this."
"Sweet Lord!" exclaimed a
passerby before cycling away.
"I've never seen such mayhem,
so many people," said junior Renee
Cafaro, a junior running for the

fee contributions by students will
climb to as much as $ 120.

somewhat ironic moment, the
Elections Commission removed
the Kids With Dreams banner to
make way for those of aspiring
candidates.
In addition, a banner reminis
cent of a baseball card holder was
hung, allowing space for all 27 Sen
ate candidates to hang a flyer.
The campaigning was made
even more hectic by the last-sec

Given that students can sudden
ly bring their campaigns into stu
dents' stalls, did the White Plaza II v

ering really matter?
"1 think this matters," Osofsky
said. "I thinkit'scertainly important
to have a presence in White Plaza."
"This gets so saturated that it re
ally ceases to have any efficacy on
voters," said Benson.
"I'm more in it lor the tradition,"
agreed Senate candidate Dan
Wendlandt, a freshman. '
"People expect it out here,"
said junior led Williams, who
was wandering about visiting fly
ering friends.
Rodriguez said it depended on
who was flyering. "For Senate can
didates, it matters hugely. For Pres
idential candidates, [students] are
going to know our names after a lit
tle while after being pounded over
the head with them."

Perry and Steinberg arrived late,
brandishing a megaphone and
shouting "Violation!" at all the fly
erers nervously waiting the 12:01
start time.

Staying and flyering would be
a further violation, he said.
"You're going to have to go home
or do whatever you want," Perry
proclaimed.
Throughout the night, they con
tinued to make bullhorn-amplified
announcements. " This Edwin
Drood guy is going to win whatever
he [expletive] wants," Perry noted
to the crowd, referring to a Rams'
Head poster. "His posters are all
over the place."
Finally, midnight occurred. With
a cheer, students taped flyers to
every available surface in White
Plaza and began campaigns which
would last late into the night.
"This is fun," Brewer said, laugh
ing, "1 love this."
"Sweet Lord!" exclaimed a
passerby before cycling away.
"I've never seen such mayhem,
so many people," said junior Renee
Cafaro, a junior running for the
Senate. "This is where the action
happens; this is exciting."
