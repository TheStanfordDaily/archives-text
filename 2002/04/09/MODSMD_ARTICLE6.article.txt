# Queer community raises awareness
## QuAD 2002 to feature speeches, social functions 
### SARAH PAPÉ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The gay, lesbian, bisexual and
transsexual communities at Stan
ford are hoping to raise more
awareness for queer issues on cam
pus through Queer Awareness
Days 2002, known as QuAD.
The event, which began last
week and will end April 25, is a se
ries of speeches, performances
and social gatherings that empha
size the contributions lesbians,
gays, bisexuals and transsexuals
make to the world.
"While there haven't been any
high-profile homophobic acts re
cently, 1 think there is still a lot of
fear and misunderstanding of
people who have different sexual
orientations or gender identities
here on the Stanford campus,"
said sophomore Brian Collins, di
rector of the event. "A primary
reason we put it on is to provide an
opportunity for straight kids to
better understand people of dif
ferent sexual orientations and
gender identities."
The event is organized by a
steering committee made up of

gay and straight students on cam
pus and sponsored by the Lesbian,
Gay, Bisexual and Transgender
Community Resources Center.
Groups such as the Gay and Les
bian Alumni Club and the Queer /
Straight Social and Political Al
liance will host events during the
month.
Two years ago, the name of the
event changed from Bisexual,
Gay, Lesbian Awareness Days, or

Queer activist Riki Wilchins was the
keynote speaker at Queer Aware
ness Days 2002.
BGLAD, to its current name, be
cause organizers felt that the origi
nal name excluded the transgen
der and transsexual communities.
"Queer" was chosen as a more in
clusive name, and this year the
keynote speaker, Riki Wilchins, is a
transsexual.
Wilchins, who spoke last night,
is the executive director for the
Gender Public Advocacy Coalition
and was the first transsexual to
lead a significant lobbying organi
zation in Washington, D.C. Gen
derPAC is working to end discrim
ination and violence caused by
gender stereotypes. In June 2001,
Wilchins was named one of Time
Magazine's 100 innovators of the
21st Century.
According to Collins, Wilchins
was invited because she is a prolific
speaker and author with new ideas

on how to approach gender rights.
"She's guaranteed to challenge
you to rethink the way that you see
gender," Collins said. "She has fas
cinating new ideas and she's prac
tical and has built an effective or
ganization in Washington, D.C. to
light for these principles."
In addition to Wilchins'
keynote address, the event will
also feature book readings by
Gabrielle Calvocoressi, Lysley
Tenorio and Brian Teare on
April 10, 17 and 18, respectively,
at 7 p.m. in the Stanford Book
store. All three writers belong to
the Wallace Stegner program,
which is a creative writing fellow
ship program at Stanford.
"As a writer, it is my job to write
out of an awareness of the world —
of society and politics as well as my
own inner life," Teare said. "As a
gay writer, 1 inevitably become
conscious of the differences be
tween the world outside myself
and the world inside myself." As
part of the event, Teare said he

hopes to communicate these dif
ferences to others.
Teare attended last year's read
ings and found "an atmosphere of
support, good humor and com
monality [that is] very rare on
Stanford's campus."
A first-time event w ill be an in
teractive anti-oppression exhibit
called Boxes and Walls. The ex
hibit will be housed in the Man
zanita Dining Commons on April
20 and 21 from noon to 10 p.m.
According to Collins, partici
pants will be guided through sev
eral rooms designed to show how
people of different backgrounds
see the world.
"It is, obviously, inclusive of
many different backgrounds and
issues, not just the [lesbian, gay,
bisexual and transgender] com
munities," Collins said. "But we
thought that was a positive
thing."
Junior Jesse Evans, one of the
co-founders of the Queer /
Straight Social and Political .Al

liance, hopes that the awareness
aspect of the event will be its
biggest accomplishment. Evans's
organization will host the closing
party on April 25.
"I want to see these speakers
and readings boost discourse on
the subject of queerness that will
last at least until the next QuAD
rolls around." Evans said. "I think
people are generally glad that it's
around, but I also think that its
perceived necessity is generally
downplayed."
Collins agreed with Evans on
the level of awareness on campus.
"I think there is a subtle dis
crimination and more strikingly,
not a very strong show of support
for people who are openly gay, les
bian, whatever," Collins said. "I
think that is reflected in a gay com
munity that is fairly small and lack
ing in visibility for a university the
size of Stanford."
