# Queer community raises awareness
## QuAD 2002 to feature speeches, social functions 
### SARAH PAPÃ‰ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The gay, lesbian, bisexual and
transsexual communities at Stan
ford are hoping to raise more
awareness for queer issues on cam
pus through Queer Awareness
Days 2002, known as QuAD.
The event, which began last
week and will end April 25, is a se
ries of speeches, performances
and social gatherings that empha
size the contributions lesbians,
gays, bisexuals and transsexuals
make to the world.
"While there haven't been any
high-profile homophobic acts re
cently, 1 think there is still a lot of
fear and misunderstanding of
people who have different sexual
orientations or gender identities
here on the Stanford campus,"
said sophomore Brian Collins, di
rector of the event. "A primary
reason we put it on is to provide an
opportunity for straight kids to
better understand people of dif
ferent sexual orientations and
gender identities."
The event is organized by a
steering committee made up of

gay and straight students on cam
pus and sponsored by the Lesbian,
Gay, Bisexual and Transgender
Community Resources Center.
Groups such as the Gay and Les
bian Alumni Club and the Queer /
Straight Social and Political Al
liance will host events during the
month.
Two years ago, the name of the
event changed from Bisexual,
Gay, Lesbian Awareness Days, or
