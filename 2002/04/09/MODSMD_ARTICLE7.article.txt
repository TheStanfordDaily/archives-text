# Examining the varied perceptions of Stanford's alcohol policy
## Drinking on campus 
### MATT BRICKER 
While many Stanford students are
acquainted with red cups containing
cheap beer or poorly mixed rum and
Coke, fewer are aware of the detailed
policy that governs the consumption of
these drinks.
"I'm not really sure what the adminis
tration's aims are," said junior Jules Ca
pers. "I think they should find some way
to get the word out about what they're
trying to do. That way, students can put
all of [the administration's] actions, no
matter how unpopular, into some sort of
context."
The official University policy on drug
and alcohol use can be found on page

702 of the Stanford Bulletin. The policy
is based primarily on federal and state
laws.
"Really, everyone is expected to follow
California state law," said Asst. Dean of
Students Nanci Howe.
Assoc. Dean of Students Morris
Graves, said that universities are not al
ways at complete liberty to make their
own decisions regarding alcohol issues.
"One of the things that students never
think about are the outside pressures,
even at the federal level, that are put on
all universities," Graves said. "For exam
ple, during his presidency President
[Bill] Clinton signed a mandate that re
quires universities to notify parents when
their child violates state alcohol laws."

I lowe and Graves admit that under
age drinking is a reality despite the ex
pectation that students will follow state
law. They also stressed that the admin
istration does not turn a blind eye to
this fact.
Sophomore Tara Ramachandra said,
"The fact is that college students are
going to drink, and I feel that the school's
policies are effective in making sure that
they do so responsibly."
Instead of relying on rigid enforce
ment, administrators treat the drinking
policy as part of the Fundamental Stan
dard of the University.
"Our policies hinge on a couple ofcor-
nerstones," Graves said. "First, the culture of Stanford
is such that we treat undergrads as adults. We believe
that students will make the right decisions with the
right information. And second, students will have to
face the consequences when they make the wrong de
cisions."
Many students seem to agree with this type of out
look. "Allowing students to make choices for them
selves is what Stanford is about," said junior Josh Ben
son. "1 don't think anyone wants an administration
that plays babysitter."
' Howe explained that the administration's alcohol
program goes beyond its official policy.
"When students think about the policy, they think
about the things that they can't do," Howe said. "The
program is what allows alcohol on campus, encour
ages responsible drinking and provides outlets that
aren't centered on alcohol."
These outlets include programs such as
"Equally Attractive Non-Alcoholic Beverage"
support, where registered parties can get subsi
dies for half the cost of high-quality non-alcoholic
beverages like Jainba Juice.
Howe insisted the main goal of both the policy
and the program is to encourage responsible ac
tions by students.
"The basic philosophy is front-loading with educa
tion," Howe said. "Many students think throwing up
from drinking is a normal, expected part of alcohol
consumption. We are trying to teach students that this
is absolutely not the case. We want students to inter
vene with friends earlier and keep the community re
sponsible about drinking."
Stanford's extremely residential campus makes
the drinking situation unique, according to I fowe.
"We are different than other campuses in that we
have [resident assistants] working with students to
create a safe and open environment," Howe said.
"One of our hopes is that students will look out for one
another."
Junior Nancy Fu, the house manager at Storey,
concurs. "I like that RAs aren't policeman like at Uni
versity of California schools."
According to both Howe and Graves, outside criti
cisms of Stanford's policy and program are minimal.
"Sure there are some criticisms, but that's natural,"
Graves said. "It's not really that big of an issue."
Many student criticisms stem from the seemingly
sudden crackdown on the Greek system at the end of
last year.
"The University has been candid about its laissez
faire alcohol program," said sophomore fraternity

member Keaton Miller. "However, recently the
University seems to be looking for a scapegoat for
alcohol-related problems. Unfortunately, the fra
ternity system has been the recipient of the Univer
sity's attention."
Howe and Graves also dispelled popular rumors
that Stanford can maintain its policy only because there
have been no recent alcohol-related deaths on campus.
" That type of defense of the program would never
be used by the administration," 1 lowe said.
Howe said that the Stanford program is effective.
"Fewer students drink excessively than the nation
al norm and more students report themselves as non
drinkers than the national average for universities,"
she said.
Graves also believes the Fundamental Standard
based approach is a good one.
"Prohibition just doesn't seem to work," Graves
said. "Except in a few limited cases like the Univer
sity of Delaware. Ultimately, no one knows for sure
what the best policy is, but we view our program as
a success."

istration does not turn a blind eye to
this fact.
Sophomore Tara Ramachandra said,
"The fact is that college students are
going to drink, and I feel that the school's
policies are effective in making sure that
they do so responsibly."
Instead of relying on rigid enforce
ment, administrators treat the drinking
policy as part of the Fundamental Stan
dard of the University.
"Our policies hinge on a couple ofcor-
nerstones," Graves said. "First, the culture of Stanford
is such that we treat undergrads as adults. We believe
that students will make the right decisions with the
right information. And second, students will have to
face the consequences when they make the wrong de
cisions."
Many students seem to agree with this type of out
look. "Allowing students to make choices for them
selves is what Stanford is about," said junior Josh Ben
son. "1 don't think anyone wants an administration
that plays babysitter."
' Howe explained that the administration's alcohol
program goes beyond its official policy.
"When students think about the policy, they think
about the things that they can't do," Howe said. "The
program is what allows alcohol on campus, encour
ages responsible drinking and provides outlets that
aren't centered on alcohol."
These outlets include programs such as
"Equally Attractive Non-Alcoholic Beverage"
support, where registered parties can get subsi
dies for half the cost of high-quality non-alcoholic
beverages like Jainba Juice.
Howe insisted the main goal of both the policy
and the program is to encourage responsible ac
tions by students.
"The basic philosophy is front-loading with educa
tion," Howe said. "Many students think throwing up
from drinking is a normal, expected part of alcohol
consumption. We are trying to teach students that this
is absolutely not the case. We want students to inter
vene with friends earlier and keep the community re
sponsible about drinking."
Stanford's extremely residential campus makes
the drinking situation unique, according to I fowe.
"We are different than other campuses in that we
have [resident assistants] working with students to
create a safe and open environment," Howe said.
"One of our hopes is that students will look out for one
another."
Junior Nancy Fu, the house manager at Storey,
concurs. "I like that RAs aren't policeman like at Uni
versity of California schools."
According to both Howe and Graves, outside criti
cisms of Stanford's policy and program are minimal.
"Sure there are some criticisms, but that's natural,"
Graves said. "It's not really that big of an issue."
Many student criticisms stem from the seemingly
sudden crackdown on the Greek system at the end of
last year.
"The University has been candid about its laissez
faire alcohol program," said sophomore fraternity

member Keaton Miller. "However, recently the
University seems to be looking for a scapegoat for
alcohol-related problems. Unfortunately, the fra
ternity system has been the recipient of the Univer
sity's attention."
Howe and Graves also dispelled popular rumors
that Stanford can maintain its policy only because there
have been no recent alcohol-related deaths on campus.
" That type of defense of the program would never
be used by the administration," 1 lowe said.
Howe said that the Stanford program is effective.
"Fewer students drink excessively than the nation
al norm and more students report themselves as non
drinkers than the national average for universities,"
she said.
Graves also believes the Fundamental Standard
based approach is a good one.
"Prohibition just doesn't seem to work," Graves
said. "Except in a few limited cases like the Univer
sity of Delaware. Ultimately, no one knows for sure
what the best policy is, but we view our program as
a success."
