# Students prepare for Rush
## Fraternity Rush, sorority Recruitment will take place this month 
### ANNA GALAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ahhh . . . spring is here. After the
dreary days of winter, it is finally time for
barbeques, carnivals and car smashing.
Car smashing? That can only mean that
it is time for fraternity Rush and sorority
Recruitment.
However, most events don't involve
sledgehammers, golf clubs and crow
bars. Car smashing is limited only to the
Helta Kappa Epsilon fraternity.
Junior Josh Bartel, who helped plan

Rush for DKE last year, described the
event, known as "Smashy Smashy," as a
30-year tradition in which an old car
from a salvage lot is brought to a parking
lot and rushees have the chance to "take
a swing."
"The administration is hesitant to let
us do it every year," Bartel said, "but we
take the precautions so that no one gets
hurt." According to Battel, there have
never been any injuries or other proper
ty damage in the tradition's history.
The Inter-Fraternity Council and
Inter-Sorority Council oversee the
events planned for the upcoming weeks,
ensuring that they follow University
policies. Rush and Recruitment events
are dry and it is strictly prohibited that
alcohol be present at any time
during this period.
Senior Kristy Harrison, the ISC
Recruitment co-chair, helps plan re
cruitment for the five ISC sororities,
which include Chi Omega, Delta
Delta Delta, Kappa Alpha Theta,
Kappa Kappa Gamma and Pi Beta
Phi.
Harrison described ISC recruit
ment as a four-day process for po
tential new members to check out —
and potentially join — Greek life.
Recruitment begins with ori
entation on Tuesday, April 9,
from 8 to 9 p.m. in the Tresid
der Memorial Union Oak
rooms.
The rest of the events will
take place the following Friday,
Saturday, Sunday and Monday.
Potential new members (for
merly known as "rushees") at
tend events hosted by the soror
ities in Tresidder, Old Union
and Bechtel International Cen
ter.
Harrison noted that this year,
the ISC will include highlights of
sorority philanthropy during a
philanthropy exposition after
orientation and during the open
house night of Recruitment.
She described her experience
with Recruitment three years ago
as an exciting time in which she
met a lot of upperclass women as
well as women in her class.
"I had never planned to be
come involved in Greek life be
cause of my impressions of life at
the University of Texas in
Austin," Harrison said. "As I par
ticipated in activities freshman
year, though, I met a lot of great
women and realized that sorority
life at Stanford is a lot different
from any other university I had
seen. I decided to try it out —
many of the women participating
are just checking it out — and see
how it would go. I had a great
time, met a lot of amazing women

in my class and ended up choos
ing to join one of the groups."
IFC President Martin
Ruano, a senior, also stressed
that Rush was a chance lor peo
ple on campus to see what
Greek life involves.
"A lot of people see Rush as [a
process in which] if you do it,
you're already a part of Greek
life," Ruano said. "But that is not
necessarily true." He recom
mended that everyone try rush, if
only to see what it was about.
"Some people feel like it's a
commitment, but during rush
you get to meet people and I
think that it's beneficial to check
it out," he said.
Rush kicks off on Sunday,
April 14 at 8 p.m. at the Elliot
Program Center. Ruano de
scribed the kickoff ceremony as
an open forum, in which all the
fraternities will be represented
and rushees will have the chance
to meet people, ask questions and
listen to a brief introduction and
discussion.
After the kickoff, fraternities
will hold open houses. Fraternity
Rush is a two week process end
ing with rush retreats on April
27.
Junior Benjamin Trevino, IFC
vice-president and a member of
the Rush committee for his frater
nity, Phi Kappa Psi, said, "We
want to create a party atmosphere
at our Rush events. These events
are primarily for socialization so
we need to make it as convenient
and easy for people to mingle and
talk to each other. Consequently,
you can expect our entire chapter
to be there, smiling and ready to
meet people."
Sophomore Adam Piotrowski,
co-rush chair for I3KE, thought
that while rush events like
Smashy Smashy are exciting, for
him, the best part of Rush will be
to have the opportunity to meet
new people and prospective
rushees.
"It's an all-around great time,"
he said. "We hang out, eat some
food and the guys are a lot of fun."

well as women in her class.
"I had never planned to be
come involved in Greek life be
cause of my impressions of life at
the University of Texas in
Austin," Harrison said. "As I par
ticipated in activities freshman
year, though, I met a lot of great
women and realized that sorority
life at Stanford is a lot different
from any other university I had
seen. I decided to try it out —
many of the women participating
are just checking it out — and see
how it would go. I had a great
time, met a lot of amazing women

in my class and ended up choos
ing to join one of the groups."
IFC President Martin
Ruano, a senior, also stressed
that Rush was a chance lor peo
ple on campus to see what
Greek life involves.
"A lot of people see Rush as [a
process in which] if you do it,
you're already a part of Greek
life," Ruano said. "But that is not
necessarily true." He recom
mended that everyone try rush, if
only to see what it was about.
"Some people feel like it's a
commitment, but during rush
you get to meet people and I
think that it's beneficial to check
it out," he said.
Rush kicks off on Sunday,
April 14 at 8 p.m. at the Elliot
Program Center. Ruano de
scribed the kickoff ceremony as
an open forum, in which all the
fraternities will be represented
and rushees will have the chance
to meet people, ask questions and
listen to a brief introduction and
discussion.
After the kickoff, fraternities
will hold open houses. Fraternity
Rush is a two week process end
ing with rush retreats on April
27.
Junior Benjamin Trevino, IFC
vice-president and a member of
the Rush committee for his frater
nity, Phi Kappa Psi, said, "We
want to create a party atmosphere
at our Rush events. These events
are primarily for socialization so
we need to make it as convenient
and easy for people to mingle and
talk to each other. Consequently,
you can expect our entire chapter
to be there, smiling and ready to
meet people."
Sophomore Adam Piotrowski,
co-rush chair for I3KE, thought
that while rush events like
Smashy Smashy are exciting, for
him, the best part of Rush will be
to have the opportunity to meet
new people and prospective
rushees.
"It's an all-around great time,"
he said. "We hang out, eat some
food and the guys are a lot of fun."
