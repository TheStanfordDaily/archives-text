speech contest: $500 Prizes!
The Oral Communication Program at the Center for Teaching & Learning is proud to
announce its second annual Speech Contest:
Riskful Thinking
Allowed
cllvJ Li Li
"The core task of college is intellectual complexification. That means... we are not about find
ing or transmitting solutions; we are not about recipes; we are not about making intellectual life
easy. We are about making intellectual life difficult...because confrontation with complexity is what
expands your mind... A metaphor for this confrontation with intellectual complexity, /is what! I call
Riskful Thinking.'" -Professor H ans Ulrich Gumbrecht, Comparative Literature
Now is your chance to pay tribute to teaching that challenged you: your thinking, your intellectual lim
its, your sense of what was possible. Tell us about a teacher who emphasized complex questions rather
than easy answers. Tell us about the hardest class you ever loved. Tell us about someone who stimulat
ed you to pursue Riskful Thinking.
We want to hear these stories in the form of a manuscript speech'that takes no longer than five minutes
to deliver. We encourage you to approach the topic in the spirit of Riskful Thinking: be daring in your
approach, your writing, and your subject matter. Multimedia* entries are encouraged and will be consid
ered in a separate prize category. Speeches can be about a class, a particular professor, a TA, or perhaps
an unexpected teacher in your university career. Surprise us with powerful speeches that illustrate the
impact of Riskful Thinking on your learning experience.
*We define multimedia broadly to include any supplemental use of sound or image.
