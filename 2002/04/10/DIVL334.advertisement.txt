To Edward Cohen, it seemed the entire
world was Jewish. Then he went to school,
where he was the only child who didn't bow
his head during Christian prayers, the only
child not invited to dance class. As the polite
50's segued into the racially explosive 60's,
Jackson, Mississippi, would never be the same.
And Edward would escape to the University
of Miami in search of a new identity. There,
he thought he would find other Jews and finally
gain the acceptance he never had. But once
again he found himself as an outsider-this time
as a southerner. A stirring memoir for anyone
who's ever felt a loss of identity or pressure
to conform, The Peddler's Grandson is sure to
touch readers everywhere who have
grappled with who they are.
