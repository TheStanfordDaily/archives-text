# University settles trademark suits
## 
### JENNIFER KONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Office of the General Counsel
and three companies using the name
Stanford recently "resolved their dif
ferences" and agreed to discontinue
using the term "Stanford." The compa
nies, Stanford Chemical Corporation,
Stanford Engineering and Testing and
Stanford Technologies USA will
change their company names by the
end of the month.
According to General Counsel Debt a
Zumwalt, the Office of the General
Counsel keeps track of "who is using
Stanford's name." The office employs a
search company to find illegal uses of
Stanford's name, she said.
"Usually, we ask [the companies] to
cease using the name," Zumwalt said.
"Many companies agree, but some
don't. When they don't, we file suits."
Zumwalt said that people may use
Stanford's name to boost the image of
their companies without being aware
of the trademark violation they are
committing.
"Stanford is a very well-known name,
which stands for excellence and high
quality because of its reputation,"
Zumwalt said. "We don't want compa
nies using the name because they might
tarnish it."

According to Zumwalt, each year the
office liles several suits based on trade
mark infringement, as Stanford is a fed
erally registered trademark.
She also pointed out that domain
names that include Stanford also con
stitute trademark infringement.
Zumwalt said the Office deals with
dozens of trademark cases each year,
most of which are settled outside of
the courtroom.
In the case of the former Stanford
Chemical Corp., however, the compa
ny failed to change its name after the
University specifically requested it to.
According to Richard Ligon, the cor
porate secretary, the company re
ceived a letter from Stanford express
ing the University's concern and ask
ing it to change its name. He said the
company was "startled" to find that the
University considered the matter such
a big issue.
"We didn't take it seriously because
we thought it was so foolish," he said. "It
seemed ridiculous that they would be so
concerned about our name, that any
one would mistake what were doing for
[the University]."
Based in Vancouver, Washington,
Pacific Chemical Corp. was formed to
develop a fertilizer plant in Oregon, ac
cording to Ligon. When the company
was founded in 2000, the "arbitrary"

name Stanford was selected, Ligon said,
partly because company members often
ate at restaurants in the Portland area
that bore the name of Stanford.
When Stanford Chemical Corp.
failed to change its name, the Universi
ty tiled suit against the company. In
stead of hiring a lawyer, Ligon said the
company sent him to discuss the matters
with the University's law firm.
"1 wouldn't say there were any con
cessions made," Ligon said. " There was
a settlement agreement that was draft
ed, and we agreed that we would
change our name and not use Stan-
name] again in the future."
After the settlement, the company
adopted its new name, Pacific Chemical
Corp. Ligon added that the University
provided the company monetary con
sideration to assist in the process of
changing its name. These payments in
cluded the company's costs of sending
out notices about the name change and
printing new letterheads.
Despite what the intentions of Pacific
Chemical Corp. may have been,
Zumwalt said she feels that Stanford's
name should not be casually used for
legal reasons as well as others.
"We don't want consumers to be
confused, to think that Stanford
stands behind a product or a compa
ny," she said.
