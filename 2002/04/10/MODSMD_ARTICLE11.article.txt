# Green-card policy affects Muslims
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) _ Pro
longed security checks since Sept.
1 1 have caused a slowdown of al
most 14 percent in the number of
overseas Muslims granted permis
sion to live in the United States
through a special green card pro
gram, officials say.
Under the program, citizens of
countries with low rates of migra
tion to the United States can try
their luck in obtaining permanent
U.S. residence visas through a lot
tery conducted annually by the
State Department
Visa approvals were granted to

16,308 lottery winners worldwide
from Oct. 1, 2000 to Feb. 28,
2001, according to official figures.
But for the identical period a year
later, which occurred after the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks, the number ap
proved was just 14,074 â€” a decline
0f2,234 or about 14 percent.
Almost all of that was the result of
lower numbers from Muslim coun
tries, said a State Department offi
cial, who asked not to be identified.
But it's unclear whether the more
extensive background checks will, in
the end, result in an increase in re
jection rates for would-be immi

grants from Egypt, Jordan, Sudan,
Saudi Arabia and other Muslim
countries.
James Zogby, who heads the
Arab-American Institute, said
there is no doubt that the Sept. 11
fallout has "negatively affected
hundreds of good people from
Arab and Muslim countries who
wanted to come and in most situa
tions would immediately have
qualified to come to U.S."
Everyone, he added, "will un
derstand the need for increased
vigilance as long as the process is
transparent and fair."
