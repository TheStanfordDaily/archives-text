## The
						Stanford Daily Alcohol policy sensible, but could use fine-tuning 
### 
The National Institute on Alcohol
Abuse and Alcoholism released a
study today that severely criticized
the "culture of drinking" prevalent
at many colleges. The study hysterically de
picted college life as saturated with alcohol
and claimed that alcohol contributes to 1,400
deaths and 500,000 injuries among college
students each year. It also recommended,
among other things, Friday evening and Sat
urday morning classes as a way to cut down
on drinking.
We hope that Stanford will resist sensa
tionalistic studies like these and continue to
take a sensible approach to student alcohol
consumption that treats students as adults. At
the same time, we encourage the University
to further define the conditions under which
groups will be responsible for their members'
alcohol consumption.

Unfortunately, the University's hands are
tied in many matters relating to alcohol. The
legal drinking age is 21 years old and the Uni
versity can do nothing to change that. Under
federal law, the University must tell parents
when students are cited fora violation of state
alcohol laws, even though it may feel that un
derage possession, for example, is not a seri
ous crime.
It seems that a lot of the problems with the
alcohol policy would simply vanish if the drink
ing age were lowered to 18, but it is unrealistic
to expect such an enlightened public-policy
move from the U.S. Congress and the Califor
nia Legislature.
Given these constraints and other laws, the
University must sometimes discipline stu
dents and student groups for violating laws
and policies. This year, it has placed the Stan
ford Band and Kappa Sigma on alcohol pro

bat ion in response to a specific series of
events involving excessive alcohol consump
tion. Alcohol probation was probably the best
punishment in these circumstances and we
feel it is generally a valid method of penaliz
ing groups for offenses or problems involv
ing alcohol.
However, the mechanics by which alcohol
probations ,are handed out need some refine
ment. First, a policy should be developed
defining the circumstances under which a
group is responsible for its members' behav
ior. If one group member drinks to excess at
a group function, the Fundamental Standard
implies that this person — not the whole
group — should bear the responsibility for
his conduct.
A specific policy would help groups plan
safe, responsible events involving alcohol with
out the chilling fear that one misstep could get

them suspended or disbanded.
Likewise, when violations are alleged, some
sort of impartial disciplinary board should be
formed to adjudicate, as the Greek Judicial
Board docs. This board would decide whether
a violation has occurred and ascertain its sever
ity. It would then issue the group a fair pun
ishment based on all the circumstances. This
method would be fairer than tension-filled
"negotiations" between a student group and
University administrators.
All in all, we feel the University has done a
good job in creating a fair, respectful alcohol
policy that emphasizes education and modera
tion. Stanford must reconcile a flawed law with
individual student behavior that always has —
and always will — blatantly violate that law. We
encourage the University to continue this tra
dition of fairness by outlining a similarly rea
sonable policy for student groups.
