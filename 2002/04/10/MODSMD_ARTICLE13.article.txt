# RUNNING ON EMPTY
## The 						Horde of the Rings 
### 
When I first saw ihe line I
thought it was a protest. I
had gone to the movies last
winter and found the the
ater encircled by a line of dark-clothed
young white people with greasy ponytails
and abundant facial hair. They had set
up a sort of geek squatter's camp around
the theater, complete with sleeping bags,
small coolers and cloaks.
1 thought maybe it was a statement
against the crass commercialization of
this particular megaplex-shopping cen
ter-entertainment venue. Or perhaps
they were all returning home from a
Dungeons and Dragons convention and
had stopped to use the restroom.
As I got closer it became clear that the
group was not agitated. They clustered in

small groups, quietly
playing "Magic: The
Gathering" or reading
thick paperbacks with
men in suede loincloths
slaying dragons on the
cover. Many looked as
though they had not
showered in days, hut
thev shivered bravelv in

the December air with the quiet determi
nation of religious pilgrims.
My friend and I approached a portly,
bearded gentleman dressed in a baggy
olive tunic and wearing an unreasonably
large amulet, and asked what everyone
was waiting for.
He looked at us with an expression so
full of joy and anticipation that I hall ex
pected him to say "God." Instead, he
grinned wildly and in a voice trembling
with excitement said, "The Lord of
the Rings."
I he movie was not scheduled to open
for three days. Impressed, my friend and
I backed away, slowly.
"The Lord of the Rings" is an example
of the epic, special effects-laden style of
film that falls into the genre of Movies
that People (Jet Weird About. To clarify,
"Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom
Menace" also belongs in this category.
"Zoolander" does not.
In part because I was intimidated by
the cultlike devotion of its fans, I didn't
go to see " The Lord of the Rings." I
watched with interest as it received sev
eral Oscars, many of which were claimed
by people who looked suspiciously like
the ones I saw waiting outside the movie
theater.
I haven't read Tolkien's novel be
cause, as a rule, I don't read books that
feature as main characters trolls, uni
corns or inanimate articles with magical
powers — exceptions are made for
Harry Potter.
I am aware that there are many excel
lent novels that contain one or more of
these items; however, there are far too
many books in the world for one person
to read in a lifetime. Lines must

be drawn.
When the movie came to Flicks last
weekend, 1 decided that it was time to
embrace my inner geek and go see it.
I jumped in suspense. I cringed in
horror. 1 shifted countless times to re
lieve the numbness in my buttocks. And
after sharing in this landmark cinematic
experience, all I can say is — huh.
It's not that I didn't like it. It'sjust that
I left the theater confused. I grasp the
basic plot, thanks to the saint-like pa
tience of the guy sitting next to me, who
kindly provided answers to "Wait —
what's going on?" and "Gross! What are
they doing?" This was a treat. In my fam
ily, talking during a movie is one step
above manslaughter.
Maybe you can tell me what I'm miss
ing. The movie has all of the elements of
the classic epic picture: sweeping land
scapes, boy coming of age, dwarves with
swords. But I couldn't get past the fact
that all of the fuss is over ... a ring.
How emotional can you get when the
music swells dramatically, the tension
rises and the camera focuses tightly
on . . . a ring? There are only so many
ways you can show a close-up of a little
gold circle and keep hearts pounding.
I kept waiting for the ring to do some
thing, like bite someone or sing a show
tune. But no dice.
However, the packed, cheering crowd
at Memorial Auditorium reminded me
of one of the things that I love most
about Stanford: that each of us is geeky
in our own unique way.
It is the one commonality of Stanford
students (besides the inability to replace
the toilet paper in the dorm bath
rooms — for the love of God, is it so
hard?) that for each of us there is at least
one beloved hobby or intellectual pursuit
that has the power to turn us into a wide
eyed, gleeful, full-blown dork.
Our nerdiness comes in so many beau
tiful colors and shapes. We are a cornu
copia of geekdom.
No matter how hip you are on the sur
face, no matter how cool your crowd,
deep down everyone harbors a secret
and uncontrollable passion for the Bron
tes, Star Trek or worms.
I have found that my favorite people
are the ones who aren't afraid to let their
dweebiness run free. Also, they are the
only ones who will play Scrabble with me.
Maybe you did line up a week in ad
vance to be the first to see Bilbo Baggins.
Maybe there's a life-size cutout of Gan
dalf in your room right now. Good for
you. I am proud to be your fellow geek.
And save me a spot in line for the next
Harry Potter movie.
