Hate-crime editorial 'confused
and absurd'
The Daily editorial that ran on April 8
("Use of term 'hate crime' must be exam
ined") was confused and absurd.
A hate crime is defined in 15 states as a
criminal act directed against a person(s) or
property based on the victim's actual or
perceived race, national origin, religion,
sexual orientation, disability or gender —
other states have less complete defini
tions. If the hate act is not a criminal of
fense, then it is legally described as a hate
incident, or simply an "ac t of intolerance."
The Stanford Acts of Intolerance Pro
tocol's wording is simply "legalese." There
is nothing contentious about the wording,
nor are there any new or arbitrary state
ments being made concerning hate crimes
or hate incidents. Obviously, non-serious
acts of hatred are not "crimes." The edito
rial, then, isn't ostensibly saying anything,
except perhaps drawing attention to the
protocol's brevity.
Despite the editorial's predictable
rhetoric of tolerance, however, the sub
text suggests that (he University's proto
col is too harsh. This is ridiculous, consid
ering the inadequacy of the protocol.
Until recently, the campus communi
ty couldn't even access the wording of
the protocol or University tracking of
acts of hatred on campus. Just last year,
students held a large rally to address the
inadequacy of the protocol, pointing to
federal guidelines for state universities
and former University President Ger
hard Casper's unwillingness to care
about the issue.
The editorial suggests that the police
investigate every "politically incorrect" re
mark, which doesn't happen. The editori
al also suggests that investigating hate
crimes — in the last few years, this in
cludes graffiti in the History coiner, ho

mophobic assault, and verbal threats,
among other incidents — would infringe
on "intellectual dialogue." A death threat
is simply not an attempt to engage in "ra
tional, intellectual dialogue."
While the text of the editorial borders
on being incoherent, the underlying mes
sage remains clear, especially if we assume
that some of it was written in hyperbole.
The Daily apparently does not care about
tolerance, diversity or the safety of stu
dents on campus.
The editorial was inappropriate, coun
terproductive, and, some may say, offen
sive. In case the editorial board is still con
fused, this does not mean the editorial was
a "hate crime" or that the police will "in
vestigate" it.

Cubberley screening not sponsored
by School of Education
In response to Himanshoo Navangul's
April 8 letter regarding the screening of
the movie "Y Tu Mama Tambien" ("'Y Tu
Mama Tambien' sends wrong message,")
we would like to clarify that the School of
Kducation does not sponsor the movies
shown in Cubberley Auditorium.
The auditorium is often used by stu
dent organizations and the movies are ap
proved by the Office of Student Activities.
In this case the event was targeted only to
members of the Stanford community and
was sponsored by a number of Mexican
student groups. The event was clearly an
educational one and included a discussion
with the director that was facilitated by two
faculty members.
It is true that the attendance was larger
than anticipated. We have reminded these
groups that room capacity must be fol

lowed since we are committed to ensuring
the health and safety of the participants at
all events on campus.

Film should be applauded for challenging
traditional values
I would like to respond to Himanshoo
V.B. Navangul's letter claiming that "YTu
Mama I ambien" does not "represent
good old American values" ('"Y Tu Mama
Tambien' sends wrong message," 4/8/02).
I could go on and on about how Mr. Na
vangul's statement is ambiguous and sub
jective to his own idea of American values,
but I think that would give his claim too
much credit.
Instead, I would like to point out that
the film should not have to exemplify his
ideas of American values, as it is a Mexican
film. He introduces "Y Tu Mama Tam
bien" as a Mexican movie, yet forgets this
important fact by the fourth paragraph of
his letter and believes that only movies
which "represent good old American val
ues" should be screened at our University.
To say that the movie represents tradi
tional Mexican values would be just as ab
surd. The coming-of-age story of two best
friends takes place in a nation which also
happens to be coming of age, but it is not
about any nation's traditional values.
Although the film is highly sexual, I do
not believe that it rises to the level of
pornography that Navangul claims. The
sexual themes — masturbation, homosex
ual experimentation, threesomes — are
