## You too could play Stanford football 
### MAUREEN MULLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
One of the the most com
mon characteristics of Stan
ford students is their realiza
tion that anything is possible.
From starting multi-million
dollar companies to writing
brilliant song lyrics, there are
few limits placed on the Stan
ford undergraduate.
However, the one area
that many Stanford students
are forced to concede defeat
is the realm of varsity athlet
ics. While many were athletic
standouts in highschool, the
Farm has convinced them to
hang up their cleats as a wave
of scholarship athletes domi
nate collegiate athletics on a
national stage.
But head football coach
Buddy Teevens and his new
coaching staff think colle
giate sports do not need to be
like that.
Recognizing the wide
range of talent available on
campus, Teevens is looking
to recruit new players for the
team, much like other clubs
recruit participant's, by hold
ing campus-wide tryouts.
"There are so many talented
students at Stanford," said spe
cial teams coach Tom Quinn.
"There are some great high
school athletes. As a new head
coach, Buddy is looking to

reach this talent and get some
new guys in the program."
Teevens and his stall are
most interested in recruiting
athletes for special teams, es
pecially in the punter position.
"We are used to programs
that have four or live guys
per position," Quinn said.
"Right now we only have a
couple punters."
Quinn is quick to point out
that the push for tryouts does
not indicate discontent with
the current punter, junior
Eric Johnson. Rather, it is
simply an attempt to get some
more people on the roster.
So what is the coaching
staff looking for?
"If people have played
special teams in high school
and are eager to participate
at the next level, we want
them to come out," said
Quinn. "If these guys are
good enough, they will play."
With a wealth of talented
athletes across other sports,
Teevens and his staff would
also entertain the prospect of
some dual-sport athletes, al
lowing them to tap into the
high level of competion that
pervades every sport on the
Farm. Tryouts can be
arranged by contacting the
football office.
Ever dreamed onto the
field decked out in Cardinal
red? Maybe it isn't too late.
