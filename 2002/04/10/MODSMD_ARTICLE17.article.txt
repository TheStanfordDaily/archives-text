# Crew shows good form in San Diego

### MAUREEN MULLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Not many people would give up a day
out on the water down in San Diego. How
ever, when such a day involves pushing
and grinding huge oars through the water
at breakneck speeds while maintaining
perfect synchrony with eight teammates,
some people might give such idea a second
thought. Add battling flu symptoms to the
mix and it would be a wonder if one could
find any takers.
However, despite being wrought with
hardship, for the Stanford men's crew team,
Sunday's opportunity to take on some of the
nation's best collegiate crew teams in the
Grand Finals of the San Diego Crew Classic
was something that they had been looking
forward to for the entire season.
Sunday marked the first time that all
three crews — the Varsity Eight, the Ju
nior Varsity Eight, and the Freshman
Eight — reserved a spot in the Grand Final
at the prestigious regatta.
"San Diego is the premier race of the
preseason and I am pleased to see how the
crews responded," said head coach Craig
Amerkhanian. "We will build on the posi
tive points from this regatta with tenacity

and conviction."
The Freshman Eight led the way for the
Cardinal, finishing third in the Grand Final
behind Washington and California. The
impressive Finish marked the first time the

Stanford crew had finished in front of Ore
gon State in seven years. The Beavers fell
two spots behind the Cardinal in fifth place.
The Stanford freshman didn't spare the
spectators a bit of drama, as they staged a
dramatic finish, pulling in front of fourth
place Orange Coast College in the final 500
yards, placing third by just two seconds.
While the freshman fared well, the Varsity
Eight didn't experience such good fortune.
Qualifying for its first Grand Final since
1988, the varsity crew was forced to compete
in spite of illness.
Sophomore stroke Matt Altman battled a
fever in the 100 sand junior bow Stuart
Scolley suffered flu symptoms as the Stan
ford Crew finished a disapointing sixth
place.
However, while the Grand Final was a
bit of disappointment, the Varsity Eight
distinguished themselves earlier in the
meet, as they beat Yale for the first time in
school history to qualify for the final.
"We see this as a mometary setback,"
said sophomore four seat Jamie Schroed
er. "Our racing on Saturday proved we
have competive speed. We are excited
about beating Yale."
