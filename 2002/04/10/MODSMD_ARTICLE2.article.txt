# University releases environmentally friendly building tips
## 
### ALEX BLEYLEBEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a move solidifying its commitment
toward environmental issues, the Univer
sity last month published "The Guideline
for Sustainable Buildings," a set of Stan
ford-specific guidelines for sustainable
building on campus.
Sustainable building, also known as
"green" building, takes future environ
mental issues into account during each
phase of a building project.
"The release of the guideline is a
tremendous step forward for Stanford,"

said coterminal engineering student Au
drey Chang, co-coordinator for Students
fora Sustainable Stanford, the group
that had lobbied for the guidelines for
over a year.
"This is the farthest ever that Stanford
has taken the idea of green buildings and
embraced the endless possibilities for sav
ing money while being environmentally
friendly," she said.
The University has faced much criti
cism during the past year over its plans for
the Foothills, particularly the location of
two trails that it is required to dedicate
under the General Use Permit. Local envi-

ronmental groups have said that Stan
ford's proposed alignments are environ
mentally insensitive.
The Guideline marks the first-ever com
mitment by the University to practice sus
tainable building. Authors of the document
hope that it will lead to more environmen
tally sound building practices as well as
more efficient water and energy usage.
This comes a year after Vice Provost of
Land and Buildings Robert Reidy formed
the Environmental Stewardship Commit
tee, which was responsible for creating a
set of Stanford-specific sustainable-build
ing guidelines.

According to the document, "The
guideline demonstrates Stanford Univer
sity's commitment to plan and develop
high-value, quality, long-term, cost-effec
tive facilities and landscapes that enhance
the academic mission of the University,
embrace our partnership with our com
munity and reinforce our stewardship of
Stanford lands."
The guideline cites rising energy costs
and an increased concern for the effects of
building projects on the environment as
primary motives in creating the new
guidelines. It highlights five sustainability
categories which the University will take

into account in future construction and
renovations: site design and planning, en
ergy use, water management, indoor envi
ronmental quality and materials, re
sources and waste.
While the new sustainability guidelines
mark a commitment by the University to
take the environment into account for
each building it constructs or renovates,
there are no specific building require
ments that it must fulfill in order to make
its building projects "sustainable."
Because it lacks specific criteria for the
University to follow, some caution
that the University will have to
show independent initiative and
eflbrt to follow the spirit of the
guidelines.
"As long as it's a coherent,
meaningful effort to make specific
changes in Stanford's environ
mental policies — and not just a
nebulous PR move — then yes,
it's definitely the right thing to do
to make sure we're looking for
ward environmentally," said
freshman Eerik Hantsoo.
The guideline may help allevi
ate worries about the University's
environmental commitment, but
Stanford officials caution not to
expect a complete revolution in
the way buildings are constructed.
"As stewards of Stanford's land,
we want to make a contribution [to
the environment]," said Reidy,
pointing out that the University
understands that environmental
issues are a topic of great impor
tance and sensitivity to the sur
rounding community. "[But] I'm
concerned that people still won't
be satisfied. We're trying very
hard to balance [all of the factors
involved in building projects]."
