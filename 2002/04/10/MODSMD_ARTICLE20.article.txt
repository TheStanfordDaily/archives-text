# Stanford athletics need some spice
## 
### 
In all the time that I have been
writing this column, I don't
believe that I've ever once
written about Stanford sports.
I usually try to keep this column as
light and entertaining as possible,
and Stanford sporting events gen
erally have just never made the cut.
But with all of the successes
and national championships and
great athletes we have at this
school, it's a strange phenome
non that not one Cardinal athlet
ic moment has inspired one of my
semi-coherent rants.
I wonder why it is that I'd rather
make fun of cheerleaders and
NASCAR fans than expound upon
the numerous triumphs of Stan
ford athletics?
The Cardinal is (or should I say
the Cardinal are â€” even the team
name prohibits proper subject
verb agreement) completely lack
ing in the one area that made
Michigan's Fab Five, Notre
Dame's Fearsome Foursome, and
Oklahoma's Brian Bosworth such
media favorites: showmanship.
To put it plainly, Stanford
teams are good.
Just good.
And that's all.
While that may put ;i lot of na
tional c hampionship banners in the
rafters, it sure doesn't make for very

sexy column- writ
ing material. II
Stanford wants to
elevate the popu
lar perception of
its athletic pro
gram to the same
level as schools
like Michigan,
North Carolina,

or Florida State, ii needs a serious
infusion of showmanship.
So for the sake of the reputation
of the school, I hope Buddy
Teevens' new gameday strategy
includes Luke Powell doing a
Houston Oilers-esque electric
slide in the end zone whenever he
scores a touchdown.
Or, failing that, how about just
one Lam beau Leap into the stu
dent section. I know it's a dan
gerous idea given the fact that the
ridiculously oversized Stanford
Stadium has a student section
with about 100 students in it on a
good day. Still this may be just the
shot in the arm the fans need to
stop cheering as if they were
watching Dean VVais hand out
more alcohol probations.
And it's not just the football
team that could use a little tweak
here and there. I lie men's basket
ball team would be well oil to shed
the image of workman-like, ineat

and-potatoes basketball that it has
come to engender over the past
few seasons.
Maybe it's time to get a few
more Josh Childress and Julius
Barnes ankle-breaking drives to
the lane instead of boring post-up,
kick-out threes.
And Remember last season
when Justin Davis was benched
after a failed attempt at a 360 slam?
Okay, so his dunk attempt failed
miserably, per se, but at least he was
making an effort. Monty would
have been better served to tell him
to try a little bit harder next time
than to bench him for (trying to)
give the fans what they want to see.
And speaking of giving the fans
what they want to see, would it kill
the school to bring the cheerlead
ers back?
Now I'm not saying that the Dol
lies aren't doing a great job (well, at
least I'm not explicitly saying it,
imply what you will), but it's an out
rage that a California school known
for sunshine and palm trees can't
field a real cheerleading squad.
If you're ever wondering
why Stanford events attract old
crowds and non-enthusiastic
fans, this could be a good rea
son. Ihe athletic department
