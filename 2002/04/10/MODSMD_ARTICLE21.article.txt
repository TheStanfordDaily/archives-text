# Wing soars as leader of Cardinal team
## 
### SARAH LINDSEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Consistency is one of the most
important tests facing any sports
team. This past weekend in Den
ver, the Stanford gymnasts passed
the test with Hying colors.
The regional meet, which can in
one night, make or break a squad,
is a critical time fora team to be
consistent. Sophomore Lindsay
Wing helped keep the team in con
tention with a stellar perlbnnance.
For the second year in a row,
Wing won the Ail-Around compe
tition at the regional meet.
In last year's regional meet
held in Athens, Ga. she scored a
39.525, claiming First on the
beam with a 9.950, third on the
floor with a 9.900, fifth on the
vault with a 9.850, and 10th on
the bars with a 9.825.
This year in Denver, the
sophomore had a similar per
formance, scoring a season-best
39.500 in the Ail-Around. She
was a co-champion on the beam
with a 9.900, eighth on the
floor with 9.875, sixth on the
vault scoring a 9.825 and sec
ond on bars with a 9.900.

The beam was the biggest
event for Wing since the team
had problems closing out their
last event. Un fazed, she nailed
her routine to help the Cardi
nal end the night.
"Regionals was exciting," she
said. "It was pretty intense
going into our last event, but it
helped a lot to know that my
teammates and coaches were
right there with me."
While the sophomore se
cured individual glory, it was
equally rewarding that the team
followed her lead and ended up
in a tie with No. 3 Georgia, scor
ing a 196.125 overall.
"While regionals was a team
effort, Lindsay did beautifully,"
head coach kristen Smyth said.
"She is coming along at the per
fect time."
Considering how long Wing
has been in gymnastics, it would
seem as though knowing when to
peak would just come naturally.
At the early age of five and a half,
Wing first entered the gym, mean
ing. three-fourths of her life has
been largely been spent working on
routines and practicing moves.
But despite the long hours

put in, Wing said it was the
careful calculation of her
coaches which ultimately allow
her to perform so well.
"I think that our coaches train
us really well," she said. "1 hey pre
pare us to be consistent and to
peak at certain times by practicing
all different types of situations."
These different situations can
either be on any of the four events,
as Wing is expected to step up for
the Cardinal in each of them on
any given night. Unlike many col
legiate gymnasts, she doesn't real
ly have an event preference.
"The vault is so powerful,
while the bars feel so free, like
you are flying," explains Wing.
"The beam is beautiful to watch,
and the floor is really fun be
cause you can connect with the
crowd, kind of like you're telling
a story with your routine."
Perhaps Wing's favorite event is
any in which she hits her routines.
"My goal is to have my best
performance on the final day of
the season," she said.
Whether the last day of the
season is the NCAA champi
onships, the Super Six team
round, or the individual competi

tion, Wing has her sights set high.
Wing recognizes that the in
dividual and team goals will
only he possible through hard
work and dedication. However
when it comes to the national
level, success sometimes comes
in the intangibles.
"Everyone on the team has so
much heart this year; we've all
worked really hard and have
been able to create a lot ol
depth," she said. "Some of my
most fun memories of gymnas
tics are the times that I've spent
with them. We have so much fun
together and get along so well."
Just a sophomore, Wing and
many of her teammates hope that
this trip could become a regular
tiling for the Cardinal. Qualify
ing last year as a team, Wing's
class has the potential to be the
first class in Stanford gymnastics
history to qualify for the national
championship meet in each sea
son they compete.
"1 think Stanford gymnastics
will keep getting better," Wing
said. "With our wonderful
coaching staff and great new re
cruits, I think we have a lot to
look forward to."
