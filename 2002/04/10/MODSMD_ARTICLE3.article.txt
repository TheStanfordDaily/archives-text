### ELIZABETH MADJLESSI STAFF WRITER 
At yesterday's extended Board of
Trustees meeting, the trustees took an in
depth look into the status of Stanford's en
dowment and elected two new members.
Annually, the board focuses on an
issue at an extended meeting; this year
they analyzed the endowment.
Board Chair Isaac Stein's conclusion
"was not that Stanford is in trouble, but
that we are enormously strong."
A recent pro bono study was commis
sioned, "to understand how our endow
ment stands in relation to peer institu
tions," Stein said. "The focus is in the
long-term, not this year's budget, but
what will happen in the next 25 years,
based on various assumptions."
Stanford's endowment is substantially
smaller per student than its peers.
Though an $8 billion endowment is an
"astonishing amount . . . [the endow
ment] covers a smaller fraction of the op
erating budget than Harvard and Prince
ton," Stein said.
For example, with $18 billion, Harvard
more than doubles Stanford's endowment.

"Even though they have a larger num
ber of students, there is still a great differ
ence," Stein said. "Though Princeton has a
more comparable endowment [roughly .$8
billion], they have fewer students and their
graduate programs are not of the same
magnitude as ours."
The ramification of this discrepancy is
the annual challenge of raising more
money through contributions ancl money
management to maintain the budget.
The goal i$ to maintain the excellence
the University exhibits "with breadth and
balance," Stein said. "We do many things
with a small scale to do it in, compared to
other institutions."
For example, "you find NCAA champs
and Nobel Laureates here," Stein said.
"[ There is also a] great balance in under
graduate majors and interdisciplinary
programs. The most distinctive difference
Stanford has is its productive behavior."
The board also announced that it has
elected two new trustees.
"We are delighted to have both of
them," Stein said.
