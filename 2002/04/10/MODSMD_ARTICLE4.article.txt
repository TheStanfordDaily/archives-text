# Meet candidates Henestroza and Rodriguez

"If you asked me two
months ago if I'd run for
the ASSU, the response
would have been a re
sounding, 'No,'" de
clared junior Monica
Henestroza with a smile.

But a few weeks ago, the response changed a bit.
Henestroza's tenure for the Stanford Labor Action
Coalition (she served as coordinator this year) was
corning to a close, and she was looking for some
thing new for her senior year.
vSo, when the Students of Color Coalition asked
Henestroza to submit her name for the 2002 ASSU
presidential race along with sophomore Nic k Ro
driguez, she dec ided to run, seeing the ASSU as a
chance to consolidate and focus her interests.
Though Henestroza has little ASSU experience,
Rodriguez has worked in the organization. Cur
rently co-chair of the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
Student Life Committee, he has spent the last year
getting to know the body from the inside.
"I've been fairly active in there," Rodriguez said.
"I've done my share of pretty productive projects,
but I've also done a lot of learning."
An ASSU insider and an outsider, "Nick and I
were a good match of idealism and pragmatism,"
Henestroza said, noting "Lac h of us was seeking to
find this balance within ourselves."
Graduate students' quality of life is a primary
concern of the duo, and it promises to be a major
issue in the election. Henestroza indicated the ex
tent of graduate students' financial problems by
noting that "the University was pushing families to

go on welfare" but sugar-coating it, saying, "Mi's
public assistance programs, not welfare."'
Next year, Cardinal Care costs to graduate stu
dents will jump between 40 and 50 percent, I lene
stroza said, prompting Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Gene Awakuni to address the issue. Awakuni,
she said, was able to announce an <S() percent in
crease in graduate health care subsidies.
"The problem is, since then, the administration
c ame back and said, 'Sorry, not NO percent, 40 per
cent,'" she continued.
"Forty percent will just leave them at the same
point as last summer," Henestroza concluded. "All
they're doing is just not making things worse . . .
