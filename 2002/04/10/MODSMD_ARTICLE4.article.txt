# Meet candidates Henestroza and Rodriguez

"If you asked me two
months ago if I'd run for
the ASSU, the response
would have been a re
sounding, 'No,'" de
clared junior Monica
Henestroza with a smile.

But a few weeks ago, the response changed a bit.
Henestroza's tenure for the Stanford Labor Action
Coalition (she served as coordinator this year) was
corning to a close, and she was looking for some
thing new for her senior year.
vSo, when the Students of Color Coalition asked
Henestroza to submit her name for the 2002 ASSU
presidential race along with sophomore Nic k Ro
driguez, she dec ided to run, seeing the ASSU as a
chance to consolidate and focus her interests.
Though Henestroza has little ASSU experience,
Rodriguez has worked in the organization. Cur
rently co-chair of the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
Student Life Committee, he has spent the last year
getting to know the body from the inside.
"I've been fairly active in there," Rodriguez said.
"I've done my share of pretty productive projects,
but I've also done a lot of learning."
An ASSU insider and an outsider, "Nick and I
were a good match of idealism and pragmatism,"
Henestroza said, noting "Lac h of us was seeking to
find this balance within ourselves."
Graduate students' quality of life is a primary
concern of the duo, and it promises to be a major
issue in the election. Henestroza indicated the ex
tent of graduate students' financial problems by
noting that "the University was pushing families to

go on welfare" but sugar-coating it, saying, "Mi's
public assistance programs, not welfare."'
Next year, Cardinal Care costs to graduate stu
dents will jump between 40 and 50 percent, I lene
stroza said, prompting Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Gene Awakuni to address the issue. Awakuni,
she said, was able to announce an <S() percent in
crease in graduate health care subsidies.
"The problem is, since then, the administration
c ame back and said, 'Sorry, not NO percent, 40 per
cent,'" she continued.
"Forty percent will just leave them at the same
point as last summer," Henestroza concluded. "All
they're doing is just not making things worse . . .



MARIO SCUSSEL/The Stanford Daily
I he ultimate issue is that the sta
tus cjuo is not enough."
Henestroza noted that her expe
riences examining workers' rights
with the coalition had parallels to
the graduate student problems.
"For workers, it's wages. For
graduate students, it's stipends,
health care, child care," Hene
stroza said.
Her successful negotiations
with the University for the work
ers would parallel the work need
ed to gain administration sup
port for graduate student needs,
she said.
"Fhe University says it
doesn't have money," Hene
stroza said, but noted "it does
(ind these resources when it be
comes a priority."
One of Henestroza and Ro
driguez's largest issues is reduc
ing campus prices. Due to mo

nopolies like the Stanford Hook
store and Bon Appetit, they said,
prices remain high. To solve
problems with the Bookstore,
particularly the low buyback rate
of used textbooks, the duo pro
posed a textbook exchange. Sim
ilar past exchanges tailed due to a
lack of resources, they said. "We
think it's important to invest
Stanford Student Enterprises re
sources to bring this about," Ro
driguez said.
Both sought better discounts
at the Bookstore, and felt that it
was plausible that the University
would join the students' side on
expanding the student discount
to other basic school supplies or
even increasing the student dis
count. "If Stanford wants to
gouge its tourists, 1 guess that's
okay," Rodriguez said, laughing,
"but not for students."
"I shouldn't have to go and get
a ride from one of my friends to
Wal-Mart to buy binders for some
of my classes," Henestroza noted.
"A stipend just isn't enough if

you're paying for tilings on this
campus."
The ASSU throwing its weight
behind such issues would pro
duce results, Henestroza and Ro
driguez feel. As to obtaining
enough student involvement to
back the ASSU, Henestroza
noted that she and the coalition
were able to get hundreds to
come out for coalition rallies.
Stanford students would rally
around campus-wide issues even
more, she said, if the ASSU could
state, "This is a student issue
without any subdivision."
In this vein, Henestroza and
Rodriguez said that they saw
themselves as bridging the gap
between student life and advoca
cy, using the latter to improve
the former.
"Students are a low priority
with the administration," the
slate's Election Handbook state
ment reads. "... we all have a
common interest to attend a uni
versity that respects and address
es our concerns."

more, she said, if the ASSU could
state, "This is a student issue
without any subdivision."
In this vein, Henestroza and
Rodriguez said that they saw
themselves as bridging the gap
between student life and advoca
cy, using the latter to improve
the former.
"Students are a low priority
with the administration," the
slate's Election Handbook state
ment reads. "... we all have a
common interest to attend a uni
versity that respects and address
es our concerns."
"If you asked me two
months ago if I'd run for
the ASSU, the response
would have been a re
sounding, 'No,'" de
clared junior Monica
Henestroza with a smile.

But a few weeks ago, the response changed a bit.
Henestroza's tenure for the Stanford Labor Action
Coalition (she served as coordinator this year) was
corning to a close, and she was looking for some
thing new for her senior year.
vSo, when the Students of Color Coalition asked
Henestroza to submit her name for the 2002 ASSU
presidential race along with sophomore Nic k Ro
driguez, she dec ided to run, seeing the ASSU as a
chance to consolidate and focus her interests.
Though Henestroza has little ASSU experience,
Rodriguez has worked in the organization. Cur
rently co-chair of the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
Student Life Committee, he has spent the last year
getting to know the body from the inside.
"I've been fairly active in there," Rodriguez said.
"I've done my share of pretty productive projects,
but I've also done a lot of learning."
An ASSU insider and an outsider, "Nick and I
were a good match of idealism and pragmatism,"
Henestroza said, noting "Lac h of us was seeking to
find this balance within ourselves."
Graduate students' quality of life is a primary
concern of the duo, and it promises to be a major
issue in the election. Henestroza indicated the ex
tent of graduate students' financial problems by
noting that "the University was pushing families to

go on welfare" but sugar-coating it, saying, "Mi's
public assistance programs, not welfare."'
Next year, Cardinal Care costs to graduate stu
dents will jump between 40 and 50 percent, I lene
stroza said, prompting Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Gene Awakuni to address the issue. Awakuni,
she said, was able to announce an <S() percent in
crease in graduate health care subsidies.
"The problem is, since then, the administration
c ame back and said, 'Sorry, not NO percent, 40 per
cent,'" she continued.
"Forty percent will just leave them at the same
point as last summer," Henestroza concluded. "All
they're doing is just not making things worse . . .

I he ultimate issue is that the sta
tus cjuo is not enough."
Henestroza noted that her expe
riences examining workers' rights
with the coalition had parallels to
the graduate student problems.
"For workers, it's wages. For
graduate students, it's stipends,
health care, child care," Hene
stroza said.
Her successful negotiations
with the University for the work
ers would parallel the work need
ed to gain administration sup
port for graduate student needs,
she said.
"Fhe University says it
doesn't have money," Hene
stroza said, but noted "it does
(ind these resources when it be
comes a priority."
One of Henestroza and Ro
driguez's largest issues is reduc
ing campus prices. Due to mo

nopolies like the Stanford Hook
store and Bon Appetit, they said,
prices remain high. To solve
problems with the Bookstore,
particularly the low buyback rate
of used textbooks, the duo pro
posed a textbook exchange. Sim
ilar past exchanges tailed due to a
lack of resources, they said. "We
think it's important to invest
Stanford Student Enterprises re
sources to bring this about," Ro
driguez said.
Both sought better discounts
at the Bookstore, and felt that it
was plausible that the University
would join the students' side on
expanding the student discount
to other basic school supplies or
even increasing the student dis
count. "If Stanford wants to
gouge its tourists, 1 guess that's
okay," Rodriguez said, laughing,
"but not for students."
"I shouldn't have to go and get
a ride from one of my friends to
Wal-Mart to buy binders for some
of my classes," Henestroza noted.
"A stipend just isn't enough if

you're paying for tilings on this
campus."
The ASSU throwing its weight
behind such issues would pro
duce results, Henestroza and Ro
driguez feel. As to obtaining
enough student involvement to
back the ASSU, Henestroza
noted that she and the coalition
were able to get hundreds to
come out for coalition rallies.
Stanford students would rally
around campus-wide issues even
more, she said, if the ASSU could
state, "This is a student issue
without any subdivision."

Rodriguez said that they saw
