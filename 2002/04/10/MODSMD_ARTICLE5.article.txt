Juniors Josh Benson and
Kendra Arimoto didn't even gel
along when they were first intro
duced by a mutual friend.
"We clashed," Arimoto said,
laughing.
Now, not only are they friends,
they're running together for ASSU
president and vice president.
"I wanted to run because I had
finally reached the point where
everything I had up to this point I
could bring to the ASSU," Arimoto
said, "as idealistic as that might
sound."
Benson said his work on stu
dent groups and University com
mittees allowed him to notice the
ASSU's successes, failures and po
tential. "I started to get a sense of
how the ASSU could better serve,"
Benson said, and opted for that
t he executive branch, noting that it
set the tone for the ASSU.
"1 think it was we both kind of
had the idea on the same night,"
Arimoto said, but noted each ini
tially thought the other was joking.
"| Later| he came to me and said,
'I'm serious,'and I said,'Me too.' "
"What we think we have here,
and what we feel our campaign is
about, is solution," Benson said.
Benson figured one of the main
problems with the ASSU was its
lack of communication with stu
dents about its functions. Ask a stu
dent what the ASSU does, Benson
said, "Half the time they say, 'I
don't know,' and I he other half say
'I don't care.'"

Founder of The
Stanford Progres
sive, Benson plans to
use his publishing ex
perience to better in
form students about

what types of issues
the ASSU is dealing wit h.
"We want to completely re
vamp the newsletter," Benson
said. "Bring some students with
publishing experience and bring it
out bi-quarterly, tri-quarterly and
get it to every door on campus."
He noted that after the San
Jose Mercury News ran an article
about the Progressive, its Stan
ford beat reporter continued to
call him about student-related
items such as Stanford Labor Ac
tion Coalition protests, because it
had no solid contacts within the

ASSU. He planned
to change that in his
administration.
"The media's cru
cial to how things get
done in the ASSU,"

Benson said, noting
that media coverage would give
students more leverage over the
University. He planned to send
press releases and keep in contact
with every publication "in a 50-
mile radius."
The administration would have
to confront student issues and be
more accountable, Benson said,
once the media was better in
formed of them by the ASSU.
On the graduate student front,
the two plan to focus upon gradu
