# Westly runs for state controller
## 
### JEFFREY TAM STAFF WRITER 
Steve Westly, Class of 1978 and former eßay senior
vice president, international, is running for (California
state controller as the Democratic Party's candidate.
Most Californians are probably unfamiliar with (ho poli
cies of the current state controller, Kathleen Connell,
and her function. *
I he controller exerts a large influence over state gov
ernment, and the office has been used by other politi
cians— such as current governor Gray Davis — as a
stepping stone for higher office. I lowever, Westly denies
that there is a hidden agenda behind his campaign for
the office.
"Right now, [1 am] solely focused on running for con
troller," Westly said. "I've always been focused on the
controller's seat, mostly because I have the business and
financial background. It's one of the most interesting
and challenging positions in government."
Though it's surprising that Wesdy is quitting a top po
sition at one of the most successful companies in Silicon
Valley to run fora more unknown state office, public of
fice has always been in his blood.
He served as student body co-president while at Stan
ford, and later became vice-chair of the California De
mocratic Party. Wesdy has also worked for the city of San
Jose and the Department of Energy in Washington, DC.
Wllen he left eßay to run for office, eßay spokesman
Kevin Purglove noted how "everyone has always known
that somewhere along the line, Steve would leave and
pursue a political future."
The Race
According to the State Controller's Office Web site,
the controller or "Chief Financial Officer of the State of
California ... [strengthens] California's financial condi
tion by being the leader in economic policy develop
ment, providing financial management services to state
and local government and being the independent pro
tector of taxpayer dollars."
Wesdy said that he will use his background as a high
tech executive to transform state government.
"Controller is one of the chief people that helps set
standards for information technology in government,"
Westly said. "The state needs to improve its information
technology infrastructure and I think I've got the skill set
to do t hat."
Westly cited the example that in Milpitas one can re
ceive a building permit online. Westly said that he would
like more state government transactions, such as renew
ing one's driver's license, to be accessible online in order
to "move California into the technology age."
Westly also listed his other priorities as controller.
" I want to make sure we tighten government, balance
the budget, [and that] we do that without reducing our
commitment to public education in this suite," he said. "1
want to use some of my business background to make
our state a better place to do business."
Westly tried to differentiate himself from his oppo
nent, Republic an Assemblyman Tom McClintock.
1 here could not be a starker difference between the
two candidates," he said. "I'm the only candidate raised

with a background in both finance and government. My
opponent has spent his entire life in government. I'm
the only pro-choice, pro-public education, pro-envi
ronment candidate. My opponent opposes all those
things... ['He is] possibly the most conservative person
in Sacramento."
"I'm very much where the mainstream California
voter is, my opponent is veiy much at the right wing of
the Republican Party and is proud of that," he said.
Background
Westly was a history majorat Stanford, with History
Prof. David Kennedy as his advisor. He was active in
Swopsi, the program for student-initiated courses at that
time. Westly also received an MBA from Stanford and
taught at the Graduate School of Business for five years.
For the past 19 years, he has been a freshmen advisor in
West Ligunita. Steven Aronowitz, class of2ooo and for
mer ASSU undergraduate senate chair, is running
Wesdy's campaign in Northern California.
It was also through a Stanford connection that West
ly joined eßay.
"One of the co-founders of e Bay, Jef ISjoll, was a stu
dent at the GSB when 1 was on the faculty, and he went
off to start eßay," Westly said. "I went into the private
sector [with him]... it's been a great experience. 1
worked fora company that's been profitable for every
quarter of its existence."
Westly was employee number 23 at eßay, before the
arrival of current CEO Meg Whitman. He served as vice
president of marketing, business development and
mergers and acquisitions before his last posting as senior
vice president, international. He helped manage eßay's
acquisition of the auction house Butterfield and put to
gether partnerships with major companies like AOL,
Yahoo and Compaq. I lealso managed eßay Great Col
lections and the newly acquired Butterfields.
Motives
As a former eßay executive, Westly follows a trend of
greater political involvement by Silicon Valley movers in
the last few years. During the 2000 election campaign,
people and companies from Silicon Valley gave much
more to political campaigns than in 1996, for example.
When asked about this trend, Westly said, "I think Sil
icon Valley is becoming more engaged with politics.
Technology is becoming bigger and bigger in industry.
I hope more people from Silicon Valley will run for of
fice in general. Silicon Valley stands for entrepreneur
ship, and it's the cradle of the new economy."
lhe physical part of campaigning has taken a toll on
Westly, a first-time public office seeker.
"Running for office is one of the tougher, more gruel
ing things you can do ... requires a lot of determination.
"It's also one of the most satisfying things. It requires
caring about issues, and basically liking people," he said.
"I'm absolutely passionate about public service, it's one of
the most important things a person can do. I'm very for
tunate to have been successful in business ... Controller
is one of the most important, influential positions instate
government. You're not only the [chief financial officer],
you also sit on over 50 boards that affect almost every as
pect of life in California."
