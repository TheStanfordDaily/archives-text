I lowever, Wilfred Emonts seems to have
found a solution to the problem with Robo
falcon, a robotic bird of prey designed to cir
cle airports, scaring oil everything with
leathers. Emonts' company called Intercept
Technologies offers Robofalcon in various
sizes and species. They range from a Pere
grine Falcon that scares off small birds to a
Golden Eagle that intimidates birds as large
as turkey vultures.

Robofalcon gets almost all of its lift and
thrust from its flapping wings, while the tail
acts as both elevator and rudder. It can
brave 25 mph winds and uses a mechanism
adapted fi oni radio-controlled boats to lock
its wings and soar.
1 Iybrid cars are usually for people willing
to sacrifice driving pleasure for fuel econo
my. I lowever, I londa wants to change that.
Ihe company's prototype called Dual
notes is a gas-electric powertrain that gen
erates 400 horsepower, but still gets 42
miles per gallon. The hybrid powertrain
uses an electric motor to help t he standard
internal combustion engine. Although
Honda has no plans to commercialize the
Dualnote, Detroit automakers are now
closer to being able to produce high-per
formance hybrids.
