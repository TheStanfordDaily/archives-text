John Robinson Pierce, the fa
ther of communications satellites
and a visiting professor of music at
Stanford for 12 years, died April 2
at the El Camino Hospital in Moun
tain View. He was 92.
The cause of death was compli
cations from pneumonia, family
members told The Stanford Re
port.
Pierce began working at Stan
ford's Center lor Computer Re
search i in Music and Acoustics in the
early 1980s, yet he never asked for
a salary, according to John Chown
ing, an emeritus Osgood Hooker
professor of fine arts.
Pierce had the unusual title of a
visiting emeritus professor of
music". He taught for 12 years, and
during his tenure brought much
needed financial support to the
center.

"He was someone who really
loved his work," said his wife, Bren
da Woodward-Pierce, who lives in
Palo Alto.
Pierce was born March 27,1910,
in Des Moines, lowa. He graduated
from the California Institute of
Technology, where he studied elec
trical engineering and earned a
bachelor's in 1933, master's in
1934, and doctorate in 1936.
In 1936, he took a job with Bell
Telephone laboratories in Murray
Hill, N.J. He held various positions
there until 1971.
In 1948, Pierce coined the term
"transistor" for the electronic
switch invented at Bell Labs.
He is probably most famous for
proposing the scientific ground
work that made unmanned com
munications satellites a reality. He
urged NASA to build a satellite
based on his design, and it was

launched in 1960.
The success of the project led to
the construction and launch of the
first commercial communications
satellite, Telstar I, in 1962, which
broadcast the first live television sig
nals across the Atlantic.
Later, he became executive di
rector of Bell Labs' communication
sciences division. His work focused
on electron devices, especially trav
eling-wave tubes and microwaves.

He was inventor of the Pierce Gun,
a vacuum tube that transmits elec
trons and is used in satellites and
the klystrons that powers the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator.
"Pierce Guns are used contin
ually to this day in all linear-beam
microwave tubes," said Glenn
Scheitrum, an engineering
physicist at the Stanford Lineal-
Accelerator Center. "He was a
real genius."
At Stanford, Pierce worked in
the area of psychoacoustics as well as
computer music. He was interested
in pitch perception but looked into
all aspects of acoustics- how a sound

is produced, how it travels through
the air and how it is processed by the
ear and brain.
"John was part of a tradition t ly
ing to understand better the intri
cacies of the whole chain, and he
wrote a lot about it," said Music
Prof. Chris Chafe.
Chafe said he has used Pierce's
"The Science of Musical Sound" as
a textbook for many of the courses
he has taught at Stanford.
In all, Pierce wrote or co-wrote
roughly 20 books and authored
more than 300 papers and book
sections, Also, he was granted about
90 patents.

He was a prolific author of sci
ence fiction, sometimes under the
pen name J. J. Coupling.
Roughly 25 of his short stories
were published in prominent jour
nals and magazines.
Pierce is survived by his wife; a
son, John Jeremy Pierce of
Bloom field, N.J.; and a daugh
ter, Elizabeth Anne Pierce of
Summit, N.J.
A memorial service is scheduled
for 2 to 3 p.m. on Friday, May 3, at
Memorial Church.
