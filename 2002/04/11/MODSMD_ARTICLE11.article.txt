## The 						Stanford Daily ASSU candidates' mess mars campus beauty 
### 
Published Since 1891

Although the University recently de
cided to erect environmentally
friendly buildings, some campaign
ing in the ASSU election seem to
have littering as their main goal. Brightly
colored flyers strewn throughout White
Plaza appear more like a bag of Skittles than
a campaign for public office.
Campaigners should stick to the issues
and exercise wisdom and discretion in their
usage and placement of both flyers and
chalk advertisements.
Although flyering and name recognition
are very important parts of campaigning,
candidates have gone too far in their efforts
to attract the student voter. They should
focus on voicing their issues rather than cre

ating hundreds of flyers with their names
plastered all over them.
This overt effort to publicize their names,
instead of the issues, implies candidates think
little of their constituency's ability to look at
student issues seriously. Flyers should high
light the names of those running, as well as
the office they are running for, but should
emphasize their plans while in office. A silly,
rhyming catch phrase; completely unrelated
to their platform, fails to give students a rea
son to vote.
Also over the top was the beginning of cam
paigning on Monday night with candidates
staking out flyering space hours beforehand.
There is plenty of space around campus for
everyone's flyers. We feel it is unnecessary to

wait so long to stake out a few spots.
This visual eyesore of flimsy flyers strewn
about campus bollards and shoddily taped up
around the Claw creates a chaotic atmo
sphere. White Plaza's current appearance, as
a mess left after a party gone awry, devalues
the election process and litters the campus.
Poor advertising strategies go beyond the
overuse of flyering. Chalk drawings serve as a
this year's secondary choice of campaign ad
vertising. While one or two chalk drawings for
an event or performance may be a cute or a
creative means of attracting an audience, can
didates' overuse of this colorful medium just
litters the campus further.
The chalk drawings re-emphasize that
many candidates believe their main goal and

means of attaining an election victory is to get
their names out in the forefront as much as
possible. All this mass visual campaign strate
gizing detracts from the substantive issues.
Misusing campus boulevards for cam
paign-related chalk scribbles, wasting money
on ridiculous, often senseless flyers, while
wasting paper demonstrates the irresponsi
bility of many ASSU election candidates. The
wasteful nature of many of these campaigns
for ASSU offices should cause alarm bells to
ring when voting.
We agree that flyering is a significant part of
campaigning, but some candidates have taken
it too far. Voters should question candidates
who have proven themselves already irre
sponsible by overflyering while campaigning.
