## The
						Osbournes revisited 
### 
I'd rather not engage in self-con
gratulation, because I know how
boring it can be. But, with that said,
I take full credit for the burgeoning
Ozzy Osbourne phenomenon. In a par
ticularly poorly written column published
Feb. 28, five days before the premiere of
"The Osbournes," I proclaimed that the
new reality show had all the characteris
tics of a hit.
My prediction has proven true, but
not simply for the reasons I set forth.
The Osbournes' first show on March 5
was the highest-rated premiere in the

21-year history of MTV.
According to the N ielsen
Ratings, the April 2
episode attracted 4.1
million total house
holds, making Ozzy and
family basically the
biggest hit in the net
work's history. MTV has
taken notice, running

the show 15 times a week to take advan
tage of its popularity. All this has helped
propel MTV to its highest first-quarter
ratings ever.
The popularity of the show has also
been reflected in sales of Ozzy's latest
album. After "The Osbournes" began air
ing, sales of "Down to Earth" increased by
40 percent per week. Since being released
in October, the album has now sold over
705,000 copies. Not bad fora jittery,
arthritic, dough-bodied hard rocker.
Part of the show's success certainly lies
in the fascination with watching former
hell-raisers trying to live by society's
rules. But, after watching the show reli
giously, I have come to a new conclusion.
The steady stream of f-bombs, the
strange hairstyles, the food fights with in
considerate neighbors, the constant ani
mal crap on the carpets and the unintelli
gible stutter of Ozzy are the spoonful of
sugar. The familial love is the medicine.
By that, 1 don't mean that the family
aspect of the show is something that is
forced down our throats. Instead, 1 think
the oddity of the Osbournes' life and
their quirky personalities is just the fluff
that allows us to pretend we're not
watching wholesome entertainment.
Meanwhile, the loving interactions be
tween husband and wife, brother and sis
ter and father and son are the true sub
stance of the show.
For instance, in one episode, Ozzy sat
watching the television in his usual outfit
of black t-shirt and black warm-up pants
with his long stringy black hair flowing
down past his shoulders. Next to him sat
16-year-old Jack, sporting a new Mo
hawk', two black ear lobe plugs and a
black t-shirt with a death-metal band's
logo on the front.
As they sat together watching the Dis
covery Channel, Ozzy casually put his
arm around Jack and pulled him tighter

â€” a nonchalant, normal expression of
affection between the Prince of Darkness
and his brooding son.
Another time, when daughter Kelly
got her first tattoo, she tried to play one
parent off of the other so that she could
get off without punishment. It didn't
work. After Ozzy and his tattoo-covered
torso saw the centimeter-tall heart on
Kelly's hip, he said that he had to tell
Sharon, the family's resident disciplinar
ian. Kelly hoped she could convince
Ozzy not to say anything. But Ozzy was
firm. "Got to," he said in his thick En
glish accent.
Sharon, reached at the beauty parlor,
yelled at Kelly and reminded her of the
family's rules. Until she was out of the
house, Kelly couldn't get any more tattoos.
Then, last Tuesday, fed up with the
late-night noise and frequent partying of
their kids, the Osbournes held a posi
tively Stull-family-like meeting in the liv
ing room to air their complaints. Sure, it
ended up with Jack storming out of the
room, upset because he felt he was being
ganged up on by Kelly and his parents.
But the meeting was an expression of
how much dialogue there is within the
family and how much everyone in the
family loves and cares for one another.
It's true that best friends often make
the worst parents. It's important to have
a large degree of discipline and a well
recognized authority structure within a
family. But it's also true that there are
many ways to raise children that are
happy, healthy and well-adjusted.
So, even when Ozzy and Sharon are
screwing up, even when they know
they're screwing up, it's impossible not to
like them. When I watch Ozzy stammer
ing through a misguided lecture on
teenage sex as his daughter blushes un
controllably or when Kelly rummages
through her purse to find dad's missing
credit card before he finds out, I can't
help but think that these are truly good
people giving it their best, doing whatev
er they can to live their lives the best way
they know how.
And, no matter how much money we
have or how many degrees are on our
wall, that's what we're all trying to do, to
give it our best and live our lives the best
way we know how.
Sure, Ozzy wouldn't be a hit without
his rock-star trappings. It's what keeps
the show light and approachable. But
the show is truly about a real-life family
doing its best to stay strong and doing a
damn good job at that.
And if you get to see the Osbournes
cuss out their neighbors and throw
whole hams over the fence in anger, all
the better. Who says a wholesome family
comedy can't actually be funny?
