U.S. should not support
apartheid in Israel
I am writing in response to the letter
from Adam Moses published on Apr. 9.
The argument of Moses's letter was that
the United States should use the leverage
of American aid to force Egypt and Jordan
to denounce Palestinian violence and to
lobby Arafat to accept peace on Israel's
terms. This suggestion appears to be exact
ly what our administration is attempting.
Moses's re-iteration of the
Sharon / Bush viewpoint ignores impor
tant facts regarding Israel. Israel is an
apartheid country. I do not make this anal
ogy lighdy — I lived fora time in South
Africa and I know that country's history
well. Within the green line, Arab citizens
attend segregated schools, are kept from
the military and cannot buy state land.
Beyond the 1967 borders, Arab subjects
have no civil rights and suspects are exe
cuted without trial. Israel evicts Arab
homeowners to build settlements for Jews
only, builds roads for Jews only, supplies
water from the West Bank to Jewish settle
ments that were built at an ever-increasing
rate during the so-called peace process.
This is apartheid.
Within the "green line," Arab citizens
have rights only slightly above those of
blacks under apartheid. In the Occupied
Territories, the level of Israeli repression
exceeds even that of the South African Na
tionalists. South Africa never fired missiles
at black townships or enforced curfews for
months at a time. South Africa, too, was a
democracy for one set of citizens.
Moses refers to Barak's "difficult con
cessions" at Camp David. To anyone famil

iar with the proposals, it is obvious that the
solution proposed by the United States
and Israel was the exact same solution that
the South African Nationalists wanted in
South Africa: Puppet-state bantustans with
no control of their own borders and no
control of their own resources such as
groundwater a resource of which the im
portance should be well-known to any stu
dent of the history of the American West.
Although our government strongly
supported South African apartheid (Dick
Cheney agreed with the Afrikaner nation
alists in considering Nelson Mandela a ter
rorist), most Americans came to reject the
legitimacy of an exclusionist nation-state.
Israel has a right to exist in exactly the same
way that South Africa has a right to exist:
not as an apartheid state.
To gerrymander a white majority in
designated "white" areas, South Africa
created the homeland system. Israel at
tempts the same thing through racially
biased immigration laws and refusing to
consider any right of return for refugees
forced from their homes on the grounds
that it would upset the "Jewish nature"
of Israel. Did we defer to South Africa's
desire to maintain the "Afrikaaner na
ture" of South Africa?
Moses desires that Arab states denounce
Palestinian terrorism. Perhaps he would
feel better if we armed the Palestinians to the
same degree we do the Israelis so that they
could wear uniforms, have tanks and mis
siles, and kill their enemies in a "legitimate"
manner. Terrorism (targeting civilians) is a
common strategy of warfare — and one
that I abhor. No country has any monopoly
on terror, however. The United States and
our allies used terror with success in World

War II (Dresden, Hiroshima, Nagasaki),
the early Zionist militias used terrorism
against the British in Palestine with great
success, Israeli uses tenor against the civil
ian population in Occupied Territories and,
given its firepower, is much more effective
in its killing than are Palestinian militants.
Every colonial war of independence has
involved terrorism. Terror is a strategy of
warfare — to eliminate it we must elimi
nate the war.
Moses's letter is meant to put an air of re
spectability upon the American and Israeli
insistence that "peace" means surrender of
all human rights. I urge Americans to lobby
fora just — and therefore lasting — peace.
One built upon human rights, internation
al law and the rejection of the notion of
ethnically pure' nation-states.
Moses rightly points out that Arab dic
tatorships have used the Israeli-Palestinain
conflict to deflect attention from their own
abuses. Yes, let us use the leverage of for
eign aid with Egypt and Jordan — but to
encourage democracy in those countries
rather than as a reward for collaboration
with Israeli apartheid.

Racial problems still exist
Paul Martino's letter to the editor as
serts that focusing on race fuels racial di
visions and that a commitment to cultural
diversity undermines a "truly colorblind
society." His reasoning is naive, however;
we cannot get past race without talking
about race. Without data and groupings,
we won't be able to accurately assess prob
lems of discrimination and take appropri
ate steps toward achieving a "colorblind
society."
Furthermore, racial divisions are not
fueled by a commitment to cultural di
versity, but by bigotry and ignorance.
Creating diverse environments helps
dispel stereotypical images and educate

against ignorance, while also creating
rich learning environments. As many
would agree, college is not only about
academic achievements, as Marti'no
seems to suggest it should be, but about
growth and learning outside of the class
room.
Ironically, Martino's annoyance with
what he alleges to be a "primary focus" on
race doesn't preclude him from begin
ning his letter with his own preoccupation
with race, in his assertion that whites will
be underrepresented in next year's fresh
man class.

U.S. should not support
apartheid in Israel
I am writing in response to the letter
from Adam Moses published on Apr. 9.
The argument of Moses's letter was that
the United States should use the leverage
of American aid to force Egypt and Jordan
to denounce Palestinian violence and to
lobby Arafat to accept peace on Israel's
terms. This suggestion appears to be exact
ly what our administration is attempting.
Moses's re-iteration of the
Sharon / Bush viewpoint ignores impor
tant facts regarding Israel. Israel is an
apartheid country. I do not make this anal
ogy lighdy — I lived fora time in South
Africa and I know that country's history
well. Within the green line, Arab citizens
attend segregated schools, are kept from
the military and cannot buy state land.
Beyond the 1967 borders, Arab subjects
have no civil rights and suspects are exe
cuted without trial. Israel evicts Arab
homeowners to build settlements for Jews
only, builds roads for Jews only, supplies
water from the West Bank to Jewish settle
ments that were built at an ever-increasing
rate during the so-called peace process.
This is apartheid.
Within the "green line," Arab citizens
have rights only slightly above those of
blacks under apartheid. In the Occupied
Territories, the level of Israeli repression
exceeds even that of the South African Na
tionalists. South Africa never fired missiles
at black townships or enforced curfews for
months at a time. South Africa, too, was a
democracy for one set of citizens.
Moses refers to Barak's "difficult con
cessions" at Camp David. To anyone famil

iar with the proposals, it is obvious that the
solution proposed by the United States
and Israel was the exact same solution that
the South African Nationalists wanted in
South Africa: Puppet-state bantustans with
no control of their own borders and no
control of their own resources such as
groundwater a resource of which the im
portance should be well-known to any stu
dent of the history of the American West.
Although our government strongly
supported South African apartheid (Dick
Cheney agreed with the Afrikaner nation
alists in considering Nelson Mandela a ter
rorist), most Americans came to reject the
legitimacy of an exclusionist nation-state.
Israel has a right to exist in exactly the same
way that South Africa has a right to exist:
not as an apartheid state.
To gerrymander a white majority in
designated "white" areas, South Africa
created the homeland system. Israel at
tempts the same thing through racially
biased immigration laws and refusing to
consider any right of return for refugees
forced from their homes on the grounds
that it would upset the "Jewish nature"
of Israel. Did we defer to South Africa's
desire to maintain the "Afrikaaner na
ture" of South Africa?
Moses desires that Arab states denounce
Palestinian terrorism. Perhaps he would
feel better if we armed the Palestinians to the
same degree we do the Israelis so that they
could wear uniforms, have tanks and mis
siles, and kill their enemies in a "legitimate"
manner. Terrorism (targeting civilians) is a
common strategy of warfare — and one
that I abhor. No country has any monopoly
on terror, however. The United States and
our allies used terror with success in World

War II (Dresden, Hiroshima, Nagasaki),
the early Zionist militias used terrorism
against the British in Palestine with great
success, Israeli uses tenor against the civil
ian population in Occupied Territories and,
given its firepower, is much more effective
in its killing than are Palestinian militants.
Every colonial war of independence has
involved terrorism. Terror is a strategy of
warfare — to eliminate it we must elimi
nate the war.
Moses's letter is meant to put an air of re
spectability upon the American and Israeli
insistence that "peace" means surrender of
all human rights. I urge Americans to lobby
fora just — and therefore lasting — peace.
One built upon human rights, internation
al law and the rejection of the notion of
ethnically pure' nation-states.
Moses rightly points out that Arab dic
tatorships have used the Israeli-Palestinain
conflict to deflect attention from their own
abuses. Yes, let us use the leverage of for
eign aid with Egypt and Jordan — but to
encourage democracy in those countries
rather than as a reward for collaboration
with Israeli apartheid.

Racial problems still exist
Paul Martino's letter to the editor as
serts that focusing on race fuels racial di
visions and that a commitment to cultural
diversity undermines a "truly colorblind
society." His reasoning is naive, however;
we cannot get past race without talking
about race. Without data and groupings,
we won't be able to accurately assess prob
lems of discrimination and take appropri
ate steps toward achieving a "colorblind
society."
Furthermore, racial divisions are not
fueled by a commitment to cultural di
versity, but by bigotry and ignorance.
Creating diverse environments helps
dispel stereotypical images and educate

against ignorance, while also creating
rich learning environments. As many
would agree, college is not only about
academic achievements, as Marti'no
seems to suggest it should be, but about
growth and learning outside of the class
room.
Ironically, Martino's annoyance with
what he alleges to be a "primary focus" on

ning his letter with his own preoccupation
with race, in his assertion that whites will
