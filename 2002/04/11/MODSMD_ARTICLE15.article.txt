## Ahead of the pack: Stanford releases sustainable building guidelines 
### BEN ABADI GUEST COLUMNIST 
Alongside Harvard and MIT, Stanford
has propelled itself into a leading role
among pre-eminent universities that are
working to jointly maximize their environ
mental and financial performance. The
University's most recent move on this front
was its release of the Stanford Guidelines
for Sustainable Building, which are the
product of nearly a year of work by the En
vironmental Stewardship Management
Group, a committee comprised of land and
buildings staff, faculty and students.
The release of the guidelines marks an
important change In the University's ap
proach to building design. For the first
time, environmental sustainability will be
on the same playing field as other build
ing considerations at Stanford, such as
cost, construction schedule, and pro
grammatic needs. The guidelines also
emphasize the ways in which "green" de
sign can yield healthier, more productive
and enjoyable areas for working and
learning. Some highlights of the guide
lines, which are available in full at
http://cpm.stanford.edu, include:
• The integration of sustainability in
every design phase of the Stanford build

ing process, an end-to-end review that is
critical if the principles of sustainability
are to successfully complement other
building requirements.
• Technical sustainability recommen
dations in five different areas: site design
and planning; energy use; water manage
ment; materials, resources and waste; and
indoor environmental quality.
• Funding, decision tools and metrics
to document the sustainability of Stan
ford buildings.
• A library of information about sus
tainable building design and construction.
Our group, Students fora Sustainable
Stanford, has encouraged this process
from its inception, and we now congrat
ulate the University for its commitment
to actively apply the guidelines and to
benchmark the performance of its build
ings. We thank the land and buildings
staff, their associates in the provost's of
fice, the Board of Trustees and various
faculty members for their willingness to
cooperate with students on this impor
tant effort.
We commend the University for devel
oping the guidelines through a transparent
and well-informed process that epitomizes
the principles of applied education upon
which Stanford was founded. These princi

ples were aptly reflected in die November
2001 symposium sponsored by land and
buildings on "Greening the Universities: A
Focus on Buildings," which was attended
by 500 people, and we hope that such out
reach will remain a core feature of Stan
ford's continued sustainability efforts.
Looking ahead to implementation of
the Guidelines, we suggest that Stanford
should designate a full-time Sustainabili
ty Goordinator.
While we applaud the designat ion of a
new part-time sustainability coordinator
to facilitate the implementation of the
guidelines, we believe that appointment of
a full-time coordinator is necessary to most
effectively promote sustainability in the
Stanford building process.
Because successful implementation
hinges upon the adoption of sustainabil
ity principles at the project manager
level, the sustainability coordinator must
work to ensure that every project man
ager is both kept apprised of best prac
tices in sustainable design and receives
the experiential training experiences
first-hand how to integrate those prac
tices throughout the building process.
Such a cultural shift within the adminis
tration toward sustainability is vital to the
guidelines' success.

Besides this operational role, the sus
tainability coordinator should investi
gate innovative ways to address sustain
ability issues, such as bridging the prob
lem of split incentives that arises when
different stakeholders bear upfront and
operating costs.
Also, the University should periodically
update the guidelines in an open review
process to reflect the University's own expe
rience and new developments elsewhere.
As Stanford and other leading universi
ties gather experience with sustainable
building, a formal process should be es
tablished for the guidelines to be regularly
reviewed, perhaps semiannually. We also
strongly recommend that land and build
ings regularly report on its sustainability
progress to the Board of Trustees, the
provost and the University Committee on
Land and Building Development.
To maintain a forward-thinking set of
guidelines, this review process should be
democratic and open to suggestions for
ongoing improvements.
Finally, Let's not rest on our laurels.
Stanford already outperforms other
colleges and universities in areas such as
energy and water conservation and trans
portation services, a leadership position
which it should promote and leverage

more fully to generate dialogue in neigh
boring communities and at other universi
ties about the economic, environmental,
and social benefits of sustainable design.
We suggest that Stanford create a publicly
available report on its historical environ
mental performance and planned im
provements — this would prove invalu
able to Stanford as it prepares to commis
sion the sustainability study required by its
General Use Permit.
We hope that the process of creating
the Stanford Guidelines for Sustainable
Building is only the beginning of a Stan
ford initiative to reap the benefits of envi
ronmentally and socially responsible de
sign. The least of these benefits is the eco
nomic efficiencies that will result. More
over, we hope that direct student involve
ment and opportunities for applied learn
ing will continue to characterize Stanford's
sustainability effort.

Students fora Sustainable Stanford is an interdis
ciplinary coalition of graduates and undergradu
ates that serves as an umbrella organization for
students interested in green building, green busi
ness, the general interplay between sustainable en
vironmental practices and sustainable economics,
and moving these interests into reality on campus
through a practical and professional approach.
