## Card women gain postseason honors 
### TERRY HURLBUTT STAFF WRITER 
The women's basketball team
has been busy since the season
ended a few weeks ago.
After a stellar sophomore
season that included being
named the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Player of the Year, the
Women's Basketball Coaches
Association selected Nicole
Powell to the 2002 NCAA Divi
sion I Kodak All-America
Women's Basketball Team.
Powell finished the season
averaging 16.6 points, 9.3 re
bounds and 6.3 assists a game.
The guard / forward put up
five triple-doubles this season
alone, including two in the
opening rounds of NCAA play.
Powell now owns six of the
eight triple-doubles in Stanford
women's basketball's 28-year
history. She also became the
first Pac-10 player of either
gender to lead the league in
both assists and rebounds.
Meanwhile, her teammate and
the Cardinal's leading scorer, se
nior Lindsey Yamasaki, traveled to
San Antonio to participate in the
WBCA All-Star Challenge.
The Stanford senior started
against the likes of Lisa Leslie, Sh
eryl Swoops and Dawn Staley, all
members of the 2002 U.S. Nation
al Team.
The National Team handily de
feated the College All-Stars by a
score of 100-57. Leslie, the second
leading scorer in the WNBA last
season, led the national team with
a double-double of 30 points and

10 boards.
Yamasaki got her name in the
scoring books by draining a trey to
finish with three points.
Her successful season brought
Honorable Mention Ail-American
recognition.
Also, seniors Bethany Donaphin
and Lauren St. Clair demonstrated
both athletic and academic accom
plishments in their final season on
the Farm.
Donaphin, a public policy
major, averaged 8.7 points a game
and was named to the Pac-10 All-
Academic Team. St. Clair, who will
graduate this year with a degree in
science, technology and society, av
eraged 4.6 points a game and was a
second-team selection.
The 2002-2003 Cardinal squad
will have a different look from its
predecessor.
In addition to losing its talented
five-woman senior core — who
finished with a 90-35 record in
their four years here — Stanford
will also be without sophomore
Becky Bonner.
The forward played two sea
sons for the Cardinal, averag
ing one point and 0.8 re
bounds, and has announced
her intentions to transfer out of
Stanford, likely back to the New
England area.
The team will look to its recruit
ing class to fill some of these rather
large shoes.
The four members of the
2006 class are 5-foot-8 guard
Clare Bodensteiner, 6-5 center
Shelley Nweke, and Street &
Smith's Honorable Mention
Preseason Ail-American selec

tions Eziamaka Okafor and
Krista Rappahahn.
Head coach Tara VanDerveer
expressed early confidence in the
group.
"I'm very excited about these

four signees," VanDerveer said.
"This is an excellent class and it will
compliment the two great recruit
ing classes ahead of them. The
class has excellent size, athleticism
and skill."
