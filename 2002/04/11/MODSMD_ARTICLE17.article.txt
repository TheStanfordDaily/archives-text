With only one Stanford run
and two hits on the board enter
ing the eighth inning Tuesday
night, just about the only guys

Tuesday: No. 2 Stanford 5,
San Jose State 4

But after a four-run Cardi
nal inning snatched a 4-1 lead
from the visiting San Jose State
Spartans (26-12), everyone else
exited Sunken Diamond won
dering why they ever doubted
such a dramatic comeback in
the first place.
"We keep battling and even
tually we have the confidence
that we'll get it," said one of the
evening's heroes, freshman
pinch hitter Danny Putnam.

ground-ball single in the fifth —
against four Spartan hurlers
through the first 7 1/3 innings.
Cooper said the Cardinal was
boosted in the late innings by a
raucous Stanford dugout, which
wasn't silenced by San Jose
State, pitching the same way its
bats were.
"Our bench has been fantas

non-starters, just pulling for
everybody, keeping the energy
