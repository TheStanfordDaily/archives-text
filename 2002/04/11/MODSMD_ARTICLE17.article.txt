# Baseball wins in late-game thriller
## Four-run eighth inning sparks comeback victory 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With only one Stanford run
and two hits on the board enter
ing the eighth inning Tuesday
night, just about the only guys
that expected what came next
were wearing 19705-style
pullovers. And really, can you
trust guys wearing 4 705-style
pullovers?

BASEBALL

Tuesday: No. 2 Stanford 5,
San Jose State 4

But after a four-run Cardi
nal inning snatched a 4-1 lead
from the visiting San Jose State
Spartans (26-12), everyone else
exited Sunken Diamond won
dering why they ever doubted
such a dramatic comeback in
the first place.
"We keep battling and even
tually we have the confidence
that we'll get it," said one of the
evening's heroes, freshman
pinch hitter Danny Putnam.
Called on to pinch hit with
the game tied, a runner on first
and two outs in the eighth, Put
nam ripped a double to score
sophomore right fielder Carlos
Quentin and put No. 2 Stanford

(23-7) ahead in the 5-4 win.
Putnam's game-winning hit
came on the heels of the con
test's most clutch performance
— a three-run, game-tying
homer with two outs by junior
designated hitter Jason Cooper.
Cooper knotted the game with
one swing, his seventh bomb of
the season, and turned what had
been a miserable night for Car
dinal batters into an ecstatic one.
"To be in that spot where we
need a hit is just huge," said
Cooper, who now leads the team
in batting average, home runs
and RBI. "And to come
through, I mean, it made my
night. It's the greatest feeling
you can have."
Before the magic eighth,
though, Spartan pitching thor
oughly dominated the Stanford
bats. The Cardinal managed
just two hits— Quentin's fifth
home run of the season in the
second inning and senior short
stop Scott Dragicevich's
ground-ball single in the fifth —
against four Spartan hurlers
through the first 7 1/3 innings.
Cooper said the Cardinal was
boosted in the late innings by a
raucous Stanford dugout, which
wasn't silenced by San Jose
State, pitching the same way its
bats were.
"Our bench has been fantas
tic this whole year, starters and
non-starters, just pulling for
everybody, keeping the energy
high in the dugout all nine in
nings," Cooper said. "It's a testa
ment to our entire team that we
battled back like this."
On the hill, freshman Mark Jet
man performed admirably, going
four innings and holding San Jose
State to just one run on two hits.
"It's been a while since he's been
out there and he did a good job
tonight," said head coach Mark
Marquess. "Jecman gave us four
good innings when we weren't
doing very much [offensively],
and, fora freshman, it was very im
pressive. They had a chance to
break it open early, and he held on
pretty good."
In his first inning of work, Jec
man allowed a single, a walk and a
sacrifice bunt before ending the
Spartan threat with an unusual
double play. After sophomore cen
terfielder Sam Fuld caught a sacri
fice fly, he threw to a strike to third
to nab a streaking runner and
complete the twin killing.
After the fourth, Jecman al
lowed just one hit the rest of the
way.
While freshman pitcher Jonny
Dyer grabbed the victory with a 1-
2-3, eight-pitch eighth inning, ju
nior Darin Naatjes impressed the
home crowd again by collecting his
second save of the season. The 6-
foot-7 lowa native used his domi
nating fastball to mow down the
Spartans in the ninth.
Despite taking the San Jose
State contest, the Cardinal had just
a .500 day on Tuesday. Stanford
received word from the Pacific 10
Conference office that its previous
ly suspended game at Arizona was

officially ended after eight innings,
handing Stanford a 15-13 loss.
While both coaches had agreed
to finish the game at a later date
due to Stanford's travel plans, after
two days of consultation with Pac

10 officials, both schools an
nounced that the game would be
permanently halted.
The Cardinal now sits 1 1/2
games behind Southern California
in the league standings.

sacrifice bunt before ending the
Spartan threat with an unusual
double play. After sophomore cen
terfielder Sam Fuld caught a sacri
fice fly, he threw to a strike to third
to nab a streaking runner and
complete the twin killing.
After the fourth, Jecman al
lowed just one hit the rest of the
way.
While freshman pitcher Jonny
Dyer grabbed the victory with a 1-
2-3, eight-pitch eighth inning, ju
nior Darin Naatjes impressed the
home crowd again by collecting his
second save of the season. The 6-
foot-7 lowa native used his domi
nating fastball to mow down the
Spartans in the ninth.
Despite taking the San Jose
State contest, the Cardinal had just
a .500 day on Tuesday. Stanford
received word from the Pacific 10
Conference office that its previous
ly suspended game at Arizona was

officially ended after eight innings,
handing Stanford a 15-13 loss.
While both coaches had agreed
to finish the game at a later date
due to Stanford's travel plans, after
two days of consultation with Pac

10 officials, both schools an
nounced that the game would be
permanently halted.
The Cardinal now sits 1 1/2
games behind Southern California
in the league standings.
