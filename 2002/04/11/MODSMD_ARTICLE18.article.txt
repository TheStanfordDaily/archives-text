Stanford Cardinal, the
second-ranked (but not necessari

team in the nation, provided an in

dramatics to fill an hour of ESPN's
Baseball Tonight, all in one of the

San Jose State team. The Cardinal proved yet again

crowd of 2,200 actually saw it. While the official stu

couldn't have been more than 25 scattered through

the press box.
Therein lies the greatness — and embarrassment

People outside of Stanford are dumbfounded

played in the national championship game two
years running! They're perennially in the nation's
top five and have made the postseason 19 of the
