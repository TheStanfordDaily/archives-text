# Go to Sunken Diamond, please!
## 
### 
Nights like Tuesday de
fine a program, for bet
ter or for worse. The
Stanford Cardinal, the
second-ranked (but not necessari
ly second-best) collegiate baseball
team in the nation, provided an in
timate home crowd with enough
dramatics to fill an hour of ESPN's
Baseball Tonight, all in one of the

most beautiful ballparks in the land. But, it was al
most empty.
On a preseason All-American's three-run bomb
and a freshman's RBI double, Stanford stormed back
to steal what looked to be a sure thing for an excellent
San Jose State team. The Cardinal proved yet again
why it is among the elite baseball programs in the na
tion.
But on a night heavily promoted as free for Stan
ford students, only about a third of the announced

crowd of 2,200 actually saw it. While the official stu
dent attendance number was unavailable, it certainly
couldn't have been more than 25 scattered through
out the park — and four of them were working in
the press box.
Therein lies the greatness — and embarrassment
— ofa two-time national champion that has made 13
trips to the College World Series, including three
straight. Despite consistent winning, an old-school,
gold-medal winning coach and an annual cast of ut
terly likeable stars and role players, scenic Sunken Di
amond just can't get any love.
People outside of Stanford are dumbfounded
when told that Cardinal baseball is the Universi
ty's best-kept secret. A secret? These guys have
played in the national championship game two
years running! They're perennially in the nation's
top five and have made the postseason 19 of the


Brett Kaufman
past 21 seasons! As much as I hate
to even say it, they're Duke bas
ketball on grass.
And almost 30 times a year, in the
friendliest confines this side of
YVrigley Field and against some of
the best competition in the nation,
these guys do battle in front of a half
packed house. Sure, an 8()-degree
day in May brings out a capacity
crowd, as does the annual fireworks
display, but the team? Nah, nobody
cares to see that.
We're talking about major
league talent 50 feet from your face,
a chance to see future stars before
the future. Don't believe me?
Sunken saw Mike Mussina before
he was the "Moose" and Jack Mc-
Dowell before he was "Blackjack."
It has seen a host of other current
major leaguers play ball, including
the Royals' Tony Cogan and the
Brewers' Kyle Peterson.

Arid that's just from our team.
Oakland A's pitcher Barry Zito,
once a Southern California star, still
talks about his one-run, two-hit per
formance — in a loss — in a 1999
Super Regional duel with former
Cardinal Jason Young at Sunken.
The Angels' Troy Glaus passed
through with UCLA, and even
Barry Bonds challenged Cardinal
pitching as an Arizona State Sun
Devil.
And what about Mark Prior? Just
over a year ago, the former Trojan
struck out 13 Stanford batters in 7
1/3 innings at Sunken; in just over a
month, he'll likely be the fifth starter
for the Chicago Cubs.
And this year's team? The Pi
rates selected starter Jeremy
Guthrie in the third round last
year; slugger Jason Cooper (Tues
day's hero) went in the second
round out of high school; and
catcher Ryan Garko is doing his
best to make his self-proclaimed
label as "a young Brad Ausmus"
look like an insult.
In short, these guys are good —

real good — and to think that not
one of them will be lighting it up in
the bigs several years down the line
would be naive.
And this is all happening on your
campus almost 30 times a year, for
bargain prices. In the words of the
Holiday Inn guy, "Why not?"
The bottom line is that a real
student presence at Sunken Dia
mond could do for Stanford base
ball what it did for the basketball
team that plays just two minutes
away. Even as few as 100 students
sitting together, razzing opposing
pitchers, clapping it up for great
plays and celebrating dramatic
wins like Tuesday night's would
be an amazing enhancement to
Sunken Diamond.
Stanford baseball is a program
defined by nothing but winning and
class. Here's to hoping it can be re
defined by a student body eager to
become a part ol it.

Brett Kaufman is a junior majoring in
international relations and Spanish. He
hates theJ***in' Mets. And USC.

one of them will be lighting it up in

The bottom line is that a real
student presence at Sunken Dia
mond could do for Stanford base
ball what it did for the basketball
team that plays just two minutes
away. Even as few as 100 students

pitchers, clapping it up for great
plays and celebrating dramatic
wins like Tuesday night's would
be an amazing enhancement to
Sunken Diamond.
Stanford baseball is a program
defined by nothing but winning and
class. Here's to hoping it can be re
defined by a student body eager to
become a part ol it.
