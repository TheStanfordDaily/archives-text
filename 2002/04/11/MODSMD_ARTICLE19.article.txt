With a few days of practice
under its belt since last weekend,
the Stanford lacrosse team will
need to turn up the heat for an in
tense weekend with two games on
its home turf.

LACROSSE

Friday: Stanford vs. Califor
nia, 7 p.m., New Moloney Field
Sunday: Stanford versus Den
ver, 1 p.m., New Moloney Field

These two league games will be
key to the Cardinal's success in
maintaining its untarnished
record in the Mountain Pacific
Lacrosse League.
The first obstacle that the Car
dinal (4-6, 4-0 MPLL) will need to
overcome on its path to a victori
ous weekend is ever-impressive
Bay Area rival California. Despite
losing to the Cardinal in all five
games between the two teams over
the past two years, Cal never ceas
es to present fierce competition.
The game against the Bears will
take place at 7 p.m. on Friday
night, under the lights at New
Maloney Field.
