ver, 1 p.m., New Moloney Field

key to the Cardinal's success in
maintaining its untarnished
record in the Mountain Pacific
Lacrosse League.
The first obstacle that the Car
dinal (4-6, 4-0 MPLL) will need to
overcome on its path to a victori
ous weekend is ever-impressive
Bay Area rival California. Despite
losing to the Cardinal in all five
games between the two teams over

"The team is really excited to
play under the lights on Friday,"
Cahill said. "After a long stretch
of away games, it's going to be
great to kick Cal's butt in front of
our fans."

the University of Denver, the Car
dinal will have to face the Pioneers

Stanford will have to replicate
and build on the success of last
weekend. The Cardinal was fueled
by the emergence of a strong attack,
which was able to keep possession of
the ball fora majority of the game.
The momentum of the game
was largely controlled by the Car
dinal. The team scored four goals
in the final five minutes of the
first half. The offense was com
bined with the typically strong
Stanford defense, anchored by
junior goalies Rachael Neumann
(seven saves) and Virginia

Solomon (four saves) who split
time in the cage.
The rematch with the Pioneers
will take place at New Maloney
Field at 1 p.m.
Besides having to prepare for
