## 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
The challenges just keep
coming for the No. 4 Stanford
women's tennis team (18-1, 4-0
Pacific 10 conference). Having
dispatched No. 13 Southern
California and No. 7 UCLA last
weekend, the Cardinal hosts
No. 34 Arizona (10-8, 3-5) at
1:30 p.m. on Friday and No. 1 1
Arizona State (12-5, 5-3) at noon
on Saturday.
Although the team is pleased
with its 6-1 victories over the Los
Angeles schools last weekend, the
Cardinal is not about to overlook
the Arizona schools.
"Everything from last weekend
until the [NCAA] Championships is
extremely important," freshman
Story Tweedie-Yates said.
Indeed, things only get more
difficult after this weekend. Stan
lord hits the road to play USC
and UCLA April 19 and 20, and,
after that, it's time for Pac-10 in
dividuals and finally the NCAA
championships.
I he Cardinal has been wait
ing all year for this stretch
though, and is excited about the
opportunity to play such talent
ed opponents.
"The team is definitely looking

forward to having a similar experi
ence as this past weekend," fresh
man Erin Burdette said. "I'm sure
they'll be tough matches."
Stanford matches up well with
the Arizona schools. The Cardinal
boasts four ranked singles play
ers: No. 10 senior Lauren
Kalvaria (11-2 in the first flight).
No. 14 sophomore Lauren
Barnikow (10-2 in the third posi
tion), No. 18 senior Gabriela Las
tra (11-1 in the second slot), and
No. 24 Burdette.
And, should the top of the lineup
falter, the Cardinal's tremendous
depth can lxÂ» counted on to win the
bottom-flight matches. Burdette
(11 -0) and senior Keiko Tokuda
(12-0) are undefeated in the fourth
and tilth flights, respectively, and
sophomore Emilia Anderson is 10-1
in the sixth slot.
In doubles, Kalvaria and Lastra
(12-1 in the top flight) form the No.
2 team, and Barnikow and Burdette

(10-2 in the second flight) are No.
14. Tokuda and Tweedie-Yates are
9-3 as the third tandem.
Arizona offers No. 13 Maja
Mlakar, No. 87 Debbie Larocque
and No. 95 Dianne Hollands.
Mlakar and Larocque are No. 13 in
doubles.
Arizona State's lineup is led by
No. 20 Adria Engel, No. 29 Dora
Krstulovic and No. 74 Mhairi
Brown. Engel and Krstulovic rank
No. 24 in doubles.
Having faced both schools earlier
this year in Arizona, Stanford knows
what to expect.
Arizona's players "all hit hard,
deep ground shots," Tweedie-Yates
said. "Arizona State has more all
around players."
The Cardinal is also glad that,
this time, it is the host school.
"We don't like going down to
Arizona," Tokuda said, citing ex
tensive travel and often harsh
conditions.
Added Tweedie-Yates: "Any
thing at home is better than on the
road. We get to see how lucky we
are here."
Stanford hasn't lost at home dur
ing the new millennium, and it
doesn't intend to do so in its match
es this weekend.
"It'll be tough, but we'll be
tougher," Tweedie-Yates said.
