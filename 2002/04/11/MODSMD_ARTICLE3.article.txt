lslamic scholar Shaykh Hamza
Yusuf Hanson spoke to a packed
lecture hall about religious toler
ance after Sept. 11 last night in the
basement of Building 420.
He drew connections between
major world religions with his
openness, humor and erudition.
"We've inherited prejudices, ha
treds, desires, loves," Hanson said,
"Previous world views force assimi
lation to an existing paradigm."
As the room was full, some
listeners'sat in the aisles as
Hanson addressed students,
adults, parents with children,
Muslims and curious attendees
of other faiths.
He began his lecture with a
blessing in Arabic and intro
duced his main theme about the
role ot religion as an explana
tion to "questions of ultimate

concern."
Hanson began with the cosmo
logical question, "Where did all
this come from?" He continued by
asking "Who am I?" and conclud
ed by discussing "What do we do
while we're here?"
It was this final question that
occupied the majority of this
speech.
"Every civilization has devel
oped some code of ethics," Han
son said.
He highlighted the universal
ity of the Golden Rule and the
collapse of religious authority in
the West as a loss of a mecha
nism that makes people follow
such rules.
He also emphasized the indi
vidual's perception of himself.
"You must see yourself as a rep
resentative of God," he said.

lamic thought and the Catholic
concept of the Seven Deadly Sins.
Sin is a universal phenomenon,
he argued.
"The word sin means 'to miss
the mark' in Old English and in
Arabic," he said, and amused the
audience with a the Japanese say
ing, "When you miss the target,
you can't blame the target."
He discussed lust as desire re
moved from love and the result of
disillusionment.
"In a spiritual vacuum, sex be
comes degenerate, passion is re
placed with drugs and degeneracy."
He spoke about gluttony and
its role in mass consumption,
envy, covetousness, wrath, sloth
and pride.
He cautioned not to allow anger
to turn into wrath.
"Don't allow anger to fill you
with a desire for vengeance," he
said.
Hanson differentiated sloth
from our modern concept of lazi
ness and instead described it as a

type of indifference to the sur
rounding world.
"People can be so busy they
never think about what they are
doing," he said.
The major topic of his lecture
was the sin of pride as the cause of
religious intolerance.
"Religious intolerance is spiri
tual pride," Hanson said.
If Muslims believe that their re
ligion is special, he explained, they
will not feel contempt for other re
ligions, but a desire that others
share their experience. The sin of
hatred of others becomes an attack
on (k>d, he said. It is important to
recognize, Hanson said, "every
body is here because God created
them."
"There is no coercion in reli
gion," Hanson quoted from the
Koran.
He ended his speech with an
other quote from the prophet Mo
hammad.
"You can't get into paradise if
you have a mustard seed's worth of
pride."
After the lecture, he opened the
forum to questions from the audi
ence. One student asked him to
clarify why he thought religion

had not been more successful in
upholding the Ciolden Rule.
Hanson answered, "The ques
tion is not to ask why isn't there
more being done but why am I not
doing it."
He related his own childhood
religious background and his con
version to Islam at the age of 18.
His mother played an important
role in cultivating his openness to
many religions.
"We went to a Unitarian
Church, " he said, "My mom told
me, 'If you were born in Sri Lanka,
you'd be a Buddhist.'"
He also addressed modem con
flicts and the United States' part in
global terrorism.
"You want to talk about evil, it
gets thrown on all sides," he said.
"State terrorism, individual terror
ism, it all goes around. There is a
lot of collective guilt."
Many members of the audience
came based to hear Hanson speak
based on his reputation.
"I heard about him from my
mom, who's taken classes with
him," said Sabah Kahn, a senior at
Homestead High School in Cu
pertino. "He's a big name in Mus
lim households."
