# Astronaut Ride gives space speech
## Stanford alumna and first U.S. woman in space shares ideas 
### HELEN KIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sally Ride, the first American
woman in space and a Stanford
alumna, spoke about the inception
of the Space Age in 1957 and recent
improvements in U.S. technology
to a crowd of roughly 300 people
yesterday afternoon in Kresge Au
ditorium.
"There is definitely an over
ture of control in space and it is a
real priority for national securi
ty," Ride said during her 80-
minute speech titled "Space and
National Security."
Space took center stage and has
held national security and military
overtones ever since the inception

of the Space Age in 1957, when the
Soviet Union launched into orbit
the first radio signal transmitter,
Sputnik, Ride said.
"First [accomplishments] in
space appeared to measure how
well a country was doing, and the
incessant beeps that the Sputnik
emitted served as constant re
minders to the United States of
their vulnerability," Ride said.
Sputnik had a great psychologi
cal impact for the United States,
Ride said, especially because it was
in the middle of the Cold War
against the Soviet Union.
"Because the Soviet Union had
the ability to launch Sputnik into
orbit, it also had the capability to
launch an Intercontinental Ballis
tic Missile into orbit, [thereby
threatening national security],"
Ride said.
She then spoke about the para
noia and vulnerability that perme
ated U.S. citizens and politicians.

Ride also discussed the speech
former President John F. Kennedy
delivered to a joint congressional
committee declaring his plan to
send a man to the moon.
"It's absolutely amazing that
Kennedy said we were going to
send a man to the moon before the
decade was over and even before
we would send a' man into orbit,"
Ride said. She remarked on
Kennedy's determination to set a

precedent that the Soviets could
not defeat .
While most of Ride's speech fo
cused on space and national securi
ty, she also showed slides of pic
tures from space. At one point, she
showed a slide with the Earth en
circled by a thin blue line.
"It is the only thing that sepa
rates all that there is on this planet
