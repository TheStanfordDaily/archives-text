wide ranging influence of the farm workers
movement," it said.

"We wanted to get different organizations

involved," said sophomore Caroline Kuntz, El

ways played an important part in the celebra
tion, and this year other groups, like Gamma
Zeta Alpha and Ballet Folklorico participated
by hosting different events."
Last week featured a screening of the film "A
Fight in the Fields," which gave a history of
Chavez and his movement. Other events in
cluded a Norteno dance party and a forum on
the role of Filipinos in the United Farm Work
ers Union.
Upcoming events focus on the struggles that
farm workers continue to face.
On April 17, Engineering Prof. Jim Leckie

farmers and their families.
"It's not something of the past at all," Vizcar-
ra said of the issue. "There are still
workers out there who are not get
ting their rights."
El Centro is also holding a "Fast
for Life Rally" on April 22, honor
ing Chavez's non-violent tactics.
Finally, the month will culmi
nate on April 23 with "La Lucha
Continua," or "the struggle con
