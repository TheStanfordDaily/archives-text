To honor labor leader Cesar Chavez and his
non-violent fight for worker's rights, El Centro
Chicano is sponsoring Cesar Chavez Com
memoration Month this April.
"We extended the month just for purpos
es of trying to outreach more," said sopho
more Diana Vizcarra, program coordinator
at El Centro. .
In past years, the official celebration of
Chavez's achievements has been limited to one
day. This year, however, El Centro decided to

extend the commemoration over the period of
a month to better educate the community about
Chavez's life and work.
The events will culminate on April 23 with
Jesse Jackson, Sr. speaking at the ninth annual
Cesar Chavez Commemorative Celebration.
A press release issued by El Centro said that
the lengthened commemoration allowed it to
offer more diverse programming to educate
people at Stanford.
"Together the programs will share with the
Stanford community the life and achievements
of Cesar Chavez, the history and importance of
the [United Farm Workers Union] and the
wide ranging influence of the farm workers
movement," it said.
This year's celebration is also characterized
by greater collaboration with other groups than
in years past.
"We wanted to get different organizations

involved," said sophomore Caroline Kuntz, El
Centra's publicity coordinator. "MEChA has al
ways played an important part in the celebra
tion, and this year other groups, like Gamma
Zeta Alpha and Ballet Folklorico participated
by hosting different events."
Last week featured a screening of the film "A
Fight in the Fields," which gave a history of
Chavez and his movement. Other events in
cluded a Norteno dance party and a forum on
the role of Filipinos in the United Farm Work
ers Union.
Upcoming events focus on the struggles that
farm workers continue to face.
On April 17, Engineering Prof. Jim Leckie
will speak about the effects pesticides have on
farmers and their families.
"It's not something of the past at all," Vizcar-
