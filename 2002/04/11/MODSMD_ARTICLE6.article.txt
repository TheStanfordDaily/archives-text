# Meet candidates Osofsky and Root

### JOHN HUETTER EDITORIAL STAFF 
True to their ASSU upbringing,
junior Mike Osofsky and sopho
more Megan Root's decision to
run for ASSU president and vice
president was made by consulting
a University committee of sorts.

"We talked to all the key people
over all the major organizations,"
Osofsky said, recalling meetings
with current ASSU undergradu
ate senators and Graduate Stu
dent Council members, among
others, to discover their opinions
on who they felt should pursue
the executive positions.
"Overwhelmingly, they
thought that Megan and I
would be a very representa
tive . . . very valid . . . very
strong slate," he said.

They decided to run two weeks
before spring quarter, the two
said.
Osofsky and Root are the only
pair of ASSU insiders running for
the top slot. Though some stu
dents may see that as a drawback,
they said they see it as the oppo
site, having proven to each other
that they can work together with
in the ASSU.
"We both work in the same
way," Root said.
"We feel the two of us comple
ment each other extremely well,"
Osofsky said. "We're not repre
senting any group, we're not rep
resenting any organization."

Osofsky's ASSU background is
in student life issues, such as orga
nizing campus events and re
forming the post office. He has
been a senator and Senate deputy
chaii Root has dealt with internal
ASSU work in her funding of stu
dent groups as Senate Advocacy
Committee chair.
"I'm an organizational freak,"
Rortt said, grinning.
After working within the ASSU
fora combined five years as sena
tors and senate associates, the pair
said they had a sense of the posi
tive and negative aspects of the



MARIO SCUSSEL/The Stanford Daily
organization.
"We have a critical eye of the
ASSU," Osofsky said. "We have
an ability to reform the internal
structure."
Out on the general campus,
the duo has promised to renovate
Tresidder Memorial Union. Os
ofsky has already written a pro
posal fora new student union,
"which will be submitted to top
administrators by the end of the
academic year," he said.
"We have a direct proposal," he
said. "It will be guaranteed to be
put on the agenda if I am in office."
For now, Tresidder will be in
ternally renovated with a less "in
stitutionalized" feel to the dining
area. New restaurants, including
a fully-licensed Starbucks and a
pizza parlor are planned as well.
"I've already seen the blue
prints," Osofsky said.

Meal plan points will be al
lowed to be used at Tresidder as
well, according to Osofsky. He
said that Asst. Director of Dining
Services Shirley Everett was will
ing to work with the ASSU.
"Her primary interest is the
quality of life of students," Osof
sky said.
Verbal agreements with Bon
Appetit and the Treehouse to ac
cept points have been made, he
said, even if Housing and Dining
Services required a percentage of
the point sales.
The two pledged to also apply
their contacts toward solving
graduate student problems.
"Our slate features the most
experience and contacts for the
successful implementation of so
lutions to graduate students," Os
ofsky and Root wrote in the elec
tion handbook.
"Graduate students have real
life issues that undergrads aren't
even aware of," Osofsky said. "It
seems time that a significant
amount of attention is given to

them."
The pair said that graduate
specific issues are "integral" to
their plans for student space.
They plan to put the proposed
Graduate Student Community
Center at the forefront.
"The [graduate student popu
lation] has been working with ad
ministrators to receive approval
fora new center in the Escondido
area," Osofsky and Root wrote.
"We will push this project up the
agenda so it will be a reality two to
three years from now."
"Student government at Stan
ford has oftentimes become a
laundry list of promises and
empty words," the group's slate
reads. "We personify a different
type of experience â€” in our five
years, we have gotten things done
to improve student life."
"That's the bottom line," Os
ofksy said. "We might be the es
tablishment, we might be internal
. . . but also, we're busting our
butts and doing what it takes to
make this change."
