"Not many people are comfort
able about going out and talking to
people randomly," said junior
Malavika Mohanan, when trying to
recall why the student group
Think! picked her to run as their
ASSU presidential candidate.

But Monahan is quick to point
out that she doesn't speak for the
loose student group. "We oper

this wasted ink ... 1 don't think
they're being very respectful to me.
When it's the same thing, every
year, maybe we should try a differ

Miller offered a similar per

much paper they can spend is a lit

said, adding that she had ap
