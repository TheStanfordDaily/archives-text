# Meet candidates Monahan and Miller

"Not many people are comfort
able about going out and talking to
people randomly," said junior
Malavika Mohanan, when trying to
recall why the student group
Think! picked her to run as their
ASSU presidential candidate.

But Monahan is quick to point
out that she doesn't speak for the
loose student group. "We oper
ate by consensus," a member ex
plained. Nor are she and her
running mate, sophomore Kel
lea Miller (who described
Thinkl's selection process jok
ingly as "roped in is much too
gentle"), running a campaign in
the usual sense.
Nor for that matter, do they
even intend to take office if elected.
Are you wondering what's
going on? That's just what they
want you to do.
"We don't have a concrete mes
sage," Monahan said. "We dis
cussed that."
Instead, Monahan and Miller
and the rest of the group said they
merely wish to get students to ex
amine themselves and their world

instead of the campus during the
time of the ASSU elections.
"Someone asked me when the
election was, and I was like,
'Uh. .Monahan said, laughing.
"What does it mean when,
each year, the candidates are say
ing the same things and trying to
address the same issues?" asked
junior Peter Stair, another
Think! member. "I ran for [the
ASSU Senate] freshman year and
realized the reason I ran was ego
trip.
"All of this is just noise," Stair

said. "I see all this wasted paper, all
this wasted ink ... 1 don't think
they're being very respectful to me.
When it's the same thing, every
year, maybe we should try a differ
ent way."
Miller offered a similar per
spective.
"To elect people based on how
much paper they can spend is a lit
tle disheartening to me," Miller
said, adding that she had ap
proached candidates about using

recycled paper for the traditional
White Plaza flyering mayhem.
"Tradition to kill trees!" she
said, laughing.
Monahan also criticized the
campaigning process.
"Right now, there's so much
campaigning, this whole week just
takes away from ourselves," Mona
han said.
The slate has merely a single
campaign sign — a ballpoint
drawn question mark and excla
mation point on a sheet of poster
board taped to a folding table.
"We're the only people who
have one sign which is not affixed
to anything," Stair said proudly.
Monahan and Miller plan to
stick out the race, although they
cheerfully admit, "I'm guessing
we're not getting enough votes."
In what they said was the un
likely chance they did win, they
would resign, and said they
would make sure voters knew be
forehand.

The duo will use bathroom
llyers, although Mohanan noted,
"I still have something against
the idea of flyering because it
takes away from the personal
communication."
They said that communication
to inspire reflection is key to the
group and to the point of the
.campaign.
"We're interested in connecting
. . . connecting mind and
body . . . connecting people and
people," Stair said. "Intelligence is
connection."
They do plan events to increase
this communication and reflection,
however.
"[We're] trying to find quality
and interactions with other human
beings," Mohanan said.
The group can often be found,
as they were for the interview, eat
ing lunch in White Plaza in a series
of "überpicnics." Mohanan also
noted the group would be partici
pating in a"Day of Infectious
Smiles," in which members would
smile at those they passed by on
their way to class every day.
The group did hit a few campus
issues in the queries they posted in

response to the questions in the
elections handbook:
"When you see this form con
tains a 'students' section and a
'graduate students' section, do you
[graduate students] feel like a sec
ond-class citizen?
"Is it too convenient for us, elect
ed leaders, and University admin
istrators, to allow a few to regularly
speak for thousands?
"Why are there more dogs
and babies than Stanford com
munity members sitting outside
on weekends?
"As paying clients of this Uni
versity, do we exercise as much
control over our learning environ
ment as we'd like to?
"Are the most pressing issues
facing Stanford's graduate student
community even on-campus is
sues? Are the most pressing issues
for any of us even on-campus is
sues?
"It's really good to see that there
are other people out there who are
really happy with their lives," said
junior Nick Handler, another
Think! member, "but are just not
content with the way things work in
general."
