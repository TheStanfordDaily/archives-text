# New gravity-probe satellite almost completed

After over 40 years of research, construction
and anticipation, the satellite Gravity Probe B is
finally nearing completion. GP-B, as it is com
monly called, will test Einstein's general theory
of relativity. The project is a consortium between
Stanford and NASA.
GP-B tests two effects called space-time frame
dragging and geodetic precession.
"We are trying to test, to a very high degree
of accuracy, two new effects of Einstein's gener
al theory of relativity," said Physics Prof. Francis
Everitt, principal investigator of GP-B. "For
this, we have a gyroscope in orbit and we will
look for changes of direction of our gyroscope's
spin axis with respect to a star that is pointed at
with a telescope. We actually have not one gyro
scope, but four."
The earth and its rotation distort space-time.
As the gyroscopes move around the earth, their
direction of spin will gradually change in the di
rection of the orbit. As the earth rotates, it drags

space and time around with it, and scientists
measure these effects.
At gyroscopes' simplest level, they are toys on
a string that keep their balance when released;
at the most complex, they function as naviga
tional guidance instruments in airplanes and
submarines. Now, they will test a 20th-century
revolutionary theory.
"If you spin a gyroscope up, it will maintain
its spin axes in a fixed direction unless acted
upon, as far as Newton is concerned, by out
side . . . forces," said Aeronautics Prof. Emer
itus Brad Parkinson, co-principal investigator
of GP-B.
"It turns out that the spin axis, when you say
it doesn't move, you still have to say relative to
what, and it turns out the big revolution between
Newton and Einstein was that there are distor
tions in the gravity field that cause it to move.
This means they are not forces in the ordinary
sense. What they really are is a change in the co
ordinate frame. This is the first time there will be
a direct measurement of that," he said.
This experiment is as significant as the no

table Michelson-Morley ether wind experiment
in 1887. That test proved that unlike sound, light
does not travel through a medium, a so-called
"ether." If successful, (iP-B will be in every high
sch(X)l textbook, according to Caltech professor
Kip Thorne.
GP-B was originally proposed at Stanford by
three professors, theoretical physicist lx*onard
Schiff, experimental physicist Bill Fairbank, and
engineer Bob Cannon.
Cannon originally suggested that the experi
ment be done in a spacecraft satellite where the
error sources could be reduced.
While the precision in space is greater
than that on Earth by several magnitudes,
measuring the effect is still challenging,
which is one of the reasons the project has
taken so long to perfect. The frame dragging
is expected to change the gyroscope's direc
tion of spin by 42 milliarc-seconds in one
year. This is about the width of a human hair
as seen from 10 miles away.
