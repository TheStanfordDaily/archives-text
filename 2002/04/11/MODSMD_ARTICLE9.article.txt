# New gravity-probe satellite almost completed
## 
### JOHN SHAPIRO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After over 40 years of research, construction
and anticipation, the satellite Gravity Probe B is
finally nearing completion. GP-B, as it is com
monly called, will test Einstein's general theory
of relativity. The project is a consortium between
Stanford and NASA.
GP-B tests two effects called space-time frame
dragging and geodetic precession.
"We are trying to test, to a very high degree
of accuracy, two new effects of Einstein's gener
al theory of relativity," said Physics Prof. Francis
Everitt, principal investigator of GP-B. "For
this, we have a gyroscope in orbit and we will
look for changes of direction of our gyroscope's
spin axis with respect to a star that is pointed at
with a telescope. We actually have not one gyro
scope, but four."
The earth and its rotation distort space-time.
As the gyroscopes move around the earth, their
direction of spin will gradually change in the di
rection of the orbit. As the earth rotates, it drags

space and time around with it, and scientists
measure these effects.
At gyroscopes' simplest level, they are toys on
a string that keep their balance when released;
at the most complex, they function as naviga
tional guidance instruments in airplanes and
submarines. Now, they will test a 20th-century
revolutionary theory.
"If you spin a gyroscope up, it will maintain
its spin axes in a fixed direction unless acted
upon, as far as Newton is concerned, by out
side . . . forces," said Aeronautics Prof. Emer
itus Brad Parkinson, co-principal investigator
of GP-B.
"It turns out that the spin axis, when you say
it doesn't move, you still have to say relative to
what, and it turns out the big revolution between
Newton and Einstein was that there are distor
tions in the gravity field that cause it to move.
This means they are not forces in the ordinary
sense. What they really are is a change in the co
ordinate frame. This is the first time there will be
a direct measurement of that," he said.
This experiment is as significant as the no

table Michelson-Morley ether wind experiment
in 1887. That test proved that unlike sound, light
does not travel through a medium, a so-called
"ether." If successful, (iP-B will be in every high
sch(X)l textbook, according to Caltech professor
Kip Thorne.
GP-B was originally proposed at Stanford by
three professors, theoretical physicist lx*onard
Schiff, experimental physicist Bill Fairbank, and
engineer Bob Cannon.
Cannon originally suggested that the experi
ment be done in a spacecraft satellite where the
error sources could be reduced.
While the precision in space is greater
than that on Earth by several magnitudes,
measuring the effect is still challenging,
which is one of the reasons the project has
taken so long to perfect. The frame dragging
is expected to change the gyroscope's direc
tion of spin by 42 milliarc-seconds in one
year. This is about the width of a human hair
as seen from 10 miles away.

Physics Prof. Francis Everitt and Aeronautics Prof. Emeritus Brad Parkison
worked together the satellite Gravity Probe B.
"[Everitt and Parkinson] have
really made this project work,"
Cannon said. "They have it all
working. It'sjust taken a long, long
time to get from a concept to a sys
tem that works in every respect."
The implications of the results
will be of great importance to the
world of science. If the result differs
from Einstein's predictions, there
will be a flurry of activity.
"Much of what we understand
about the whole universe is based
on Einstein's theories, so if
they're proven incorrect, there's
a lot of fundamental physics that
will have to be reassessed," Can
non said. "However, at this point
in time, they are generally be
lieved."
Problems arise when Einstein's
general theory of relativity, an ex
planation on the scale of the grand
cosmos, and quantum mechanics,
an explanation on the scale of the
atom, are attempted to be meshed.
They should mesh at some level,
yet they do not.
"Einstein's general theory of rel
ativity cannot be quantized in any
clear way," Everitt said.
"When we get down to the
quantum level, every theory must
be quantized," Everitt said.
"There are some very deep tech
nical problems with how to [com
bine relativity and quantum me
chanics]. Somewhere, something
has to break down.
"Either Einstein's theory
breaks, or else there's something
we don't understand about
quantum mechanics," Everitt
said. "No one knows how to get
beyond where we seem to be
stuck now. Lots of people have
interesting ideas, but we don't

have the answer." #
Another unique aspect of the
project is the inter-department col
laboration that has allowed such a
complex undertaking to succeed.
"1 think that Stanford is one ol
the few places that such a collabora
tion would work," Parkinson said.
"The reason is there is a deliberate
policy at Stanford which the lines
between departments are not as
strongly drawn as at other universi
ties. I think that reflects the real
world."
"This mission could only have
been done by a collaboration be
tween the physics department and
the aeronautics and aestronautics
department," Everitt said.
Over the 40 years of the pro
gram, much of the time has been
spent inventing technology that
was necessary for the probe.
Various advanced technolo
gies have come out of the GP-B
project, including tractor guid
ance, improved GPS navigation,
and completely automatic land
ing of airplanes.
Now, the project has almost
reached completion and everyone
involved is anticipating the upcom
ing launch.
"The satisfaction, joy, and tri
umph you feel is when you know
the spacecraft is working the way
you thought it was going to work,"
Parkinson said.
"This will be 41 days after the
launch," said Everitt. "Results
will start coming back very rapid
ly. But, we will be extremely re
served talking about results until
we are sure of our ground.
"The last thing you want to do
is make some claim about the re
sults of an experiment and find
out the day after that you made a
mistake and it's something differ
ent," Everitt said. "It will be 18
months before we are ready to
announce results."
