Students will eat, watch performances and
view artwork today at the Asian American Stu
dents Association's annual Extravaganza in
White Plaza from 11:45 to 1:0() p.m.
Extravaganza is a celebration of diversity with
in the Asian American community, said junior
Jean Liao, the AASA secretary.
"T he event manifests the different groups and
the range of cultural backgrounds that come
under the label of' Asian American,"' she said.
According to sophomore Jeffrey Chang, the
AASA treasurer, eight of AASA's subgroups will
host booths at the event. Most groups will sell
food, while Sanskriti will host a henna-drawing
table. Several student groups will also hold
booths to promote their organizations for spe
cial fees.
In addition, student groups including the
Philipino American Student Union, DVB,
Hwimori and Wushu, will showcase their talents
in cultural and modern performances.
Junior Michael Chang, the AASA vice chair,
emphasized that the event serves as a celebra
tion of multiculturalism.
"If we do not celebrate multiculturalism, we
are saying that Asian Americans as a minority

group are going to assimilate into mainstream
culture," he said. "So we are trying to retain the
roots of our previous generations."
Although Extravaganza focuses on the theme
of Asian and Pacific Islander culture, many
members of AASA core expressed their hope for
a diverse turnout. *
"Oftentimes, the Asian American community
is criticized for being too exclusive," said sopho
more Bryan Kim, the AASA chair. "I hope peo
ple of more diverse backgrounds will feel com
fortable coming to this event because we look
forward to seeing them there."
According to Jeffrey Chang, AASA core hope
fora turnout of about 300 to 500 students.
Preparations for Extravaganza began in Feb
ruary, Michael Chang said, when the AASA core
started to recruit AASA subgroups and Stanford
performance groups to participate in the event.
Special fees provided the funding. According to
Michael Chang, the costs for the event were com
pensated by profits made from the booths.
Despite the exhaustive work that the AASA
core dedicated to the preparation of Extravagan
za, Jeffrey Chang said they felt that the event was
worthwhile, because it served as a great outreach
opportunity for the Asian American community.
"We really hope to give back to the Stanford
community in an easily accessible event,"he said.
