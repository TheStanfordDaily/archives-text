## The 						Stanford Daily Sustainable guidelines a fine example of collaboration 
### 
Published Since 1891

There are plenty of occasions on
which the uncompromising ideal
ism of a student group's agenda is
simply incompatible with the bot
tom-line pragmatism that must govern Uni
versity decisions involving allocation of re
sources. This fact makes the Stanford's recent
adoption of a set of guidelines for sustainable
building all the more commendable.
Months of work by the University's Envi
ronmental Stewardship Management Group
in conjunction with the environmental group
Students fora Sustainable Stanford culminat
ed in the release of the guidelines, which rep
resent a substantive move toward environ
mentally responsible building on the Stan
ford campus.
The Daily commends both the students in
volved and administrators such as Vice
Provost for Land and Buildings Robert Reidy,
who took a stand that signifies a concern for
more than just the bottom line. The quietly
constructive collaboration between students
and administrators on the sustainable build-

ing issue should serve as an example for other
groups who have turned their quest to influ
ence University policy into a full-fledged pro
paganda battle.
The building guidelines are the latest, but
not the only, example of forward-looking en
vironmental action on the part of the Univer
sity. Its energy and water usage is also gener
ally commendable, and its respect for the en
vironmental value of the Foothills is evidenced
by its commitment to the General Use Permit
it signed in 2000.
Yet neither students nor administrators
should be entirely satisfied by the progress
that has been made thus far in building an en
vironmentally responsible campus. We believe
that Stanford has the opportunity to be a true
environmental leader. By creating incentives
for and highlighting the advantages of green
development, and by continuing to enact en
vironmentally friendly policies of its own, the
University can minimize its impact on the en
vironment while generating dialogue and
positive publicity in the community.

It is through such publicity — and the ac
companying opportunity for applied educa
tion — that the University could stand to gain
in the long run by engaging in environmental
initiatives that may involve substantial risk or
capital outlay. For instance, looking into fuel
cell or hybrid-electric vehicles for the next gen
eration of Marguerite shuttles might involve a
greater risk than sticking with gas-guzzlers, but
the indirect benefits could be substantial.
Other opportunities for environmental pi
oneering might include incentive programs
for conservation by students and faculty or in
creased research into sources of renewable
energy. Such programs would help to pre
pare students for the challenges that third
world development and global population
growth will pose to the environment in the
coming years.
Students must also play a role in making
Stanford a bastion of sound environmental
decision-making. There is currently no group
on campus that regularly puts together well
publicized all-campus events and programs

focusing on issues of sustainability.
Moreover, there seems to be a low aware
ness among students of the importance of con
serving resources — theoretically, a student
group could work with dormitory environ
mental representatives to coordinate a cam
paign to turn off lights and computers and
save water. While such admonitions may re
mind some of fourth-grade science class, the
recent energy crisis demonstrated that cutting
down on wasteful practices has never been
more crucial.
Obviously, not every student has the time to
devote herself to learning everything that is
involved in green building or renewable ener
gy. Nor is the University in a position to throw
money away on costly programs that do not
produce tangible benefits. However, we hope
that students and administrators alike recog
nize the need for sustainable practices, and we
encourage both to actively seek creative ways
to reinforce Stanford's standing as an envi
ronmentally responsible institution and work
toward productive change in other areas.
