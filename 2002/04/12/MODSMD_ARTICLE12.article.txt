Crawford, Texas: one gas station,
one traffic light, 700 people.
Earlier this week, Great Britain's
Prime Minister Tony Blair came
to Crawford to discuss important matters
of state. Two weeks from now, Crown
Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia will be
visiting the town to discuss a plan for
Mideast peace.
Mexican President Vicente Fox and
Russian President Vladimir Putin are
among the many other dignitaries to pre
viously make the trek to Crawford. And
Secretary Colin Powell, Condoleeza Rice,
and General Tommy Franks are among
the officials who held sensitive meetings

there recently.
Three years ago, all
this hullabaloo would
have been entirely un
thinkable—not just be
cause Crawford has a
population about a third
the size of my high school
or because, at the inter
section of Highway 317
and Farm Road 185, it
covers just 1.023 square

kilometers — but because then-Governor
George W. Bush had yet not bought his
ranch outside Crawford.
This past summer, Bush spent two
months at his ranch and even gave a na
tionally televised address from there. The
summertime "working vacation" prompt
ed reporters covering him, accustomed to
life in Washington D.C., to file stories on
the small town and how hot and uncom
fortable it was for them.
Being in Texas for an internship last
year, I was curious what the fuss was all
about. So I drove the two hours from
Austin to Crawford and took a quick drive
through.
I can report that it is a nice enough
place. There are ranches all over the area.
There was a big handwritten sign on one
of the buildings welcoming Bush and First
Lady Laura Bush. Overall, the people
seemed to welcome their newfound
prominence. In short, it was, as adver
tised, a nice place with small-town charm
that has really hot weather. Not the place I
would guess historic meetings would be
held, but hey, it's not my home.
If it were, I might not be able to think of
a better place.
Almost everyone likes his or her home
town, or at least has a sense of pride and
loyalty towards it — if not while they're
there, then after they've left and hear oth
ers speak ill of it. Where we are from is a
part of who we are, and we tend to take at
tacks personally.
I*he importance of hometowns to us is
demonstrated by the fact that one of the

first questions we ask when we meet some
one is, "Where are you from?" The im
portance is also signified by the presence
of hometown right below name on the
signs most Resident Assistants put on each
dorm-room door.
In parts of India, and I am sure other
countries as well, there is a practice of
prepending one's hometown to one's
name. Here, whenever football starting
lineups are shown on television, each play
er's hometown is always listed with with his
photo. Elvis's Memphis is a tourist hub to
those who want to see the area where he
spent his days.
Far from Graceland, one of the major
issues in the conflict between Israelis and
Palestinians is that of whether Palestinian
refugees will be able to return to Israel.
Regardless of the merits of either side's ar
gument, the matter highlights how in
grained a place can become in the essence
of a family. People pass down stories of
how they grew up — the landmarks
around them, the neighbors, the spots
they used to shop and play — to the next
generation, instilling a vicarious attach
ment to a hometown that descendents
may or may not ever see.
Through much of the world, genera
tions spanning hundreds of years have
lived in the same locale. A newborn may
enter the world just walking distance from
where her great-great-grandfather did.
This is changing with the massive migra
tion from rural to urban settings, and, as
residents of a relatively new country,
Americans are more mobile than others.
An additional reason for the mobility in
this country is that these days, American
society is more geographically homoge
nous than ever. There may be greater di
versity in population, but each place is
more similar to each other place than be
fore. There are hundreds and hundreds
of Wal-Marts, and essentially the same
television programming is beamed into
homes across the nation. A person could
go anywhere in the country and see more
familiar sights than unfamiliar. The only
useful thing you can really count on learn
ing about a person from their hometown
is what sports teams they follow.
Industry type, weather and demo
graphics are among the major areas
where differences do exist from place to
place in this country — and all of these are
spheres in which the Bay Area has a lot to
offer. That is probably why so many Stan
ford graduates make the area their home.
Be it ever so humble, there's no place
like home, even if it's not the President's
