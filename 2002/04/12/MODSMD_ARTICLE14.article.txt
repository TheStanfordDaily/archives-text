Hate-crime protocol discourages
misuse of the term
I am writing in response to Monday's
editorial about the use of the term "hate
crime" and how it applies to the recently
established University Acts of Intolerance
Protocol ("Use of term 'hate crime' must
be examined," 4/8/02). I want to assure the
Stanford community that we share The
Daily's view that the term "hate crime"
needs to be used with care and caution.
It is important to understand that the
Protocol does not attempt to define a hate
crime, but instead provides a procedure
for individuals to raise concerns about acts
of intolerance with the appropriate Uni
versity officials.
If an act of intolerance has the appear
ance or potential of being a hate crime, the
police are immediately notified, but the
University does not automatically ask the
Stanford Police to investigate every inci
dent. In fact, many acts of intolerance do
not require police intervention, in part be
cause the Protocol enables the University
to provide a rapid, coordinated, support
ive response that prevents these acts from
rising to the level of hate crimes.
Please be aware that when staff mem
bers take reports of incidents, we are very
careful to frame them accurately to dis
courage the consequences against free
speech that The Daily cited in the editori
al. And, in fact, we already do what the ed
itorial suggests by conducting orientation
programs on our Protocol in which we

strongly counsel people to avoid misusing
the term "hate crime."

Pedestrian damage to Foothills evident
Steve Doane asserts that the environ
ment of the foothills is not in danger
("Senior laments loss of foothills trails,"
4/10/02). This statement is not true. The
damage done by years of encroachment
by humans and unleashed dogs is read
ily apparent when one compares the
area around the dish to Jasper Ridge,
which has been preserved by carefully
restricting human access. There is no
question that heavy human pressure is
evident around the Dish, whereas
Jasper Ridge is pristine. The difference
is striking.
While I used to enjoy tramping around
this sensitive area myself over the past 20
years, I realize that, to preserve the en
voronment, my selfish interests must
sometimes come second. Such sacrifices
constitute the very nature of environmen
talism. Greater human impact is always
more destructive.
Stanford has provided sufficient access
to enjoy this area, while preventing the
unwitting abuse of the many thousands of
people who go there. Paths that allow ac
cess and reduce impact are commonly em
ployed by conservationists all over the
world, and they work. Give the birds, foxes

and flowers some privacy, stick to the
paths and have a nice run.

Jacobsen / Borchardt slate would
address crucial 'Pac-10 Title' issue in
upcoming election
With the deluge that is ASSU election
week firmly upon us, it has given me a
chance to reflect on the things that Stan
ford students truly cart about and want to
see as a part of their Stanford future.
Empowering reform ... I guess. A new
student union ... sure. Taller buildings
on campus ... not really. Another men's
basketball Pacific 10 Conference champi
onship ... You bet!
Because of this clear ordering of stu
dent preferences, there stands one clear
choice for ASSU president and vice-presi
dent for next year: the unbeatable write-in
combination of Jacobsen / Borchardt.
I mean, how could these two choose the
NBA over the awesome power of the
ASSU presidency? We get another shot at
the Final Four, and they get that fun little
office in Tresidder to talk to NBA repre
sentatives next year. And they should be
shoo-ins to win.
Perry and Steinberg want a popularity
contest? Who could be more popular than
