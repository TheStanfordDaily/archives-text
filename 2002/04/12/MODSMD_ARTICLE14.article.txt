Hate-crime protocol discourages
misuse of the term
I am writing in response to Monday's
editorial about the use of the term "hate
crime" and how it applies to the recently
established University Acts of Intolerance
Protocol ("Use of term 'hate crime' must
be examined," 4/8/02). I want to assure the
Stanford community that we share The
Daily's view that the term "hate crime"
needs to be used with care and caution.
It is important to understand that the
Protocol does not attempt to define a hate
crime, but instead provides a procedure
for individuals to raise concerns about acts
of intolerance with the appropriate Uni
versity officials.
If an act of intolerance has the appear
ance or potential of being a hate crime, the
police are immediately notified, but the
University does not automatically ask the
Stanford Police to investigate every inci
dent. In fact, many acts of intolerance do
not require police intervention, in part be
cause the Protocol enables the University
to provide a rapid, coordinated, support
ive response that prevents these acts from
rising to the level of hate crimes.
Please be aware that when staff mem
bers take reports of incidents, we are very
careful to frame them accurately to dis
courage the consequences against free
speech that The Daily cited in the editori
al. And, in fact, we already do what the ed
itorial suggests by conducting orientation
programs on our Protocol in which we

strongly counsel people to avoid misusing
the term "hate crime."

Pedestrian damage to Foothills evident
Steve Doane asserts that the environ
ment of the foothills is not in danger
("Senior laments loss of foothills trails,"
4/10/02). This statement is not true. The
damage done by years of encroachment
by humans and unleashed dogs is read
ily apparent when one compares the
area around the dish to Jasper Ridge,
which has been preserved by carefully
restricting human access. There is no
question that heavy human pressure is
evident around the Dish, whereas
Jasper Ridge is pristine. The difference
is striking.
While I used to enjoy tramping around
this sensitive area myself over the past 20
years, I realize that, to preserve the en
voronment, my selfish interests must
sometimes come second. Such sacrifices
constitute the very nature of environmen
talism. Greater human impact is always
more destructive.
Stanford has provided sufficient access
to enjoy this area, while preventing the
unwitting abuse of the many thousands of
people who go there. Paths that allow ac
cess and reduce impact are commonly em
ployed by conservationists all over the
world, and they work. Give the birds, foxes

and flowers some privacy, stick to the
paths and have a nice run.

Jacobsen / Borchardt slate would
address crucial 'Pac-10 Title' issue in
upcoming election
With the deluge that is ASSU election
week firmly upon us, it has given me a
chance to reflect on the things that Stan
ford students truly cart about and want to
see as a part of their Stanford future.
Empowering reform ... I guess. A new
student union ... sure. Taller buildings
on campus ... not really. Another men's
basketball Pacific 10 Conference champi
onship ... You bet!
Because of this clear ordering of stu
dent preferences, there stands one clear
choice for ASSU president and vice-presi
dent for next year: the unbeatable write-in
combination of Jacobsen / Borchardt.
I mean, how could these two choose the
NBA over the awesome power of the
ASSU presidency? We get another shot at
the Final Four, and they get that fun little
office in Tresidder to talk to NBA repre
sentatives next year. And they should be
shoo-ins to win.
Perry and Steinberg want a popularity
contest? Who could be more popular than
our bleach-blond three-point assassin and
his gr inning seven-foot monster-jam run
ning mate? They have experience with
teamwork and dedication, and each has a
much better fade-away than Mike Osof
sky, Nick Rodriguez or Josh Benson.
So remember, next Tuesday or
Wednesday when you log on to vote, a
write-in for Jacobsen / Borchardt is an
other vote to wipe that cocky grin off
Luke Walton's lace. 1 know who I'm vot
ing for, and if you love your basketball, so
should you.

South African Jew responds to
'apartheid' letter
As a South African Jew — I lived there
for the first seven years of my life and have
been back many times since — and an ar
dent supporter of the state of Israel — I
lived there for six months as well — I feel
compelled to respond to Dylan Schwilk's
letter comparing Israel to apartheid South
Africa ("U.S. should not support
apartheid in Israel," 4/11/02). Though
Schwilk claims to "know [South Africa's]
history well," he clearly does not know it as
well as he thinks, and he clearly misunder
stands the situation in Israel.
Schwilk claims that within the green
line Arab students attend segregated

schools and are kept from the military. He
neglects to mention that this is
voluntary — Muslim Arabs in Israel do
not want to attend Jewish schools, and
they do not want to light in an Israeli army
that they resent.
Schwilk states that beyond the 1967
borders — meaning in the West Bank and
(iaza — Arab subjects have no civil rights.
This sad situation, however, is the fault of
the Palestinian Authority. Alter all, it is in
charge of political administration in the
territories, not Israel.
He also argues that suspects are execut
ed without trial. Targeted assassinations
carried out by Israel are only against
known Hamas and Fatah terrorists, and
only occur because the Palestinian Author
ity it self refuses to reign in those terrorists.
Schwilk really gets his South African
and Israeli history wrong when he writes
that "Arab citizens have rights only slight
ly above those of blacks under apartheid."
Blacks under apartheid could not vote —
or their votes were counted for less — and
Arab Israelis can.
Blacks under apartheid had to carry
around passes and had to get permits to
work in white areas — this is not true for
Arab Israelis. South Africa was a racially
compartmentalized nation, with benches,
buses and bathrooms for whites only. This
is just not the case in Israel. In fact, Israeli
Arabs are some of the freest Arabs in the
Middle East.
Schwilk tries to excuse Palestinian ter
ror as just a fact of war, comparing Pales
tinian terror with early Zionist terror. He
conveniently leaves out two important
facts.
First, when the Zionist Stern gang did

commit acts of terror, Israeli Prime Minis
ter David Ben-Gurion demanded: "Arrest
all Stern gang leaders. Surround all Stern
bases. Confiscate all arms. Kill any who re
sist." This is in stark contrast to Yasser
Arafat's revolving-door prisons.
Second, when a ship called the "Altale
na," which was carrying arms for Jewish
terrorists, tried to dock in Tel Aviv, Ben-
Gurion ordered the ship destroyed. Yass
er Arafat did no such thing with the
"Karine A" carrying arms from Iran to the
territories.
Schwilk is right that terror is often used
as a war tactic, but the difference is that
while Ben-Gurion condemned and rooted
out terror, Palestinian society celebrates
and perpetuates it. One needs only to look
at huge financial rewards given to the fam
ilies of suicide bombers or to Palestinian
childrens' TV shows that call on young
sters to become martyrs to realize this.
Schwilk condemns the "Jewish nature"
of the state of Israel. The burning of syn
agogues in France, rabid anti-Semitism in
the Arab world, and even the fact that
swastikas were drawn on UC-Berkeley's
Hillel all prove the necessity of a Jewish
homeland. There are numerous Palestini
an and Muslim states; there is no reason
Israel should not be able to exist as a Jew
ish state.
People of color in South Africa bear a
huge burden of grief and pain on their
shoulders. The last thing they need is peo
ple like Schwilk climbing 011 top of all that
and misusing South Africans' suffering for
their own political purposes.
