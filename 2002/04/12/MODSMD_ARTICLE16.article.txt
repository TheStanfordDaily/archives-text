# A
						challenge to the five ASSU presidential slates

### ALEX SHVARTSMAN HENRY TOWSNER 
White Plaza campaining and debates
make it easy for charisma to dominate
knowledge and issues in an ASSU cam
paign. Thanks to last night's debate, we
know that every slate promises to micro
manage Stanford from their office. From
our years of ASSU experience, we know
this is impossible. Presidents come and
go, while the same issues come up every
year with slight variations.
Having worked in the ASSU, we've
seen plenty of progress and accomplish
ments go unnoticed by the student body.
While no student can be fully informed
without making a personal effort, this
campaign offers the candidates a chance
to educate the student body about how
the ASSU (and Stanford) really works, not
to mention demonstrate that they under
stand it well enough to be effective.
And in that area, we've found the cam
paigns so far to be lacking. Lofty promis
es sound good, but the habit of presiden
tial candidates to promise more than they
can offer is a large part of the negative rep
utation the ASSU has acquired.
We therefore challenge all the candi
dates to answer some questions about the
ASSU:
• What are the constitutional limits to
the ASSU's role in advocacy, and how will
your presidency remain within those
bounds without sacrificing the integrity of
your goals?
• Name two decisions made by the
Board of Trustees in the last year which
have had a direct impact on student life.
Name two decisions made by the Faculty
Senate in the last year which have had a
direct impact on student life. How much
power do these two bodies have, and how
is that reflected in your platform?
• There is, currently, a fixed amount of
space at Stanford, and new buildings will
take years to be finished, ff you plan to in
crease student space, where will the space
come from?
• Fhe ASSU President and Vice-Presi

dent are two out of 32 elected political of
ficials in the ASSU. How do the other 30
— the Undergraduate Senate and the
Graduate Student Council — fit into your
plans, and what will you do if those bodies
do not support your vision?
• Most candidates are advocating more
financial support for students in a variety
of forms: healthcare subsidies, Mar
guerite expanstion, more generous park
ing permits. Especially if you are also ad
vocating policies which would decrease
revenue — like cheaper prices at on-cam
pus retailers — where will this money
come from? Would you support an in
crease in tuition to pay for it?
• Most candidates are making promis
es which have been made for years — a
new student union, online banking, and
greater "ASSU accountability" to the stu
dent body among others. Why will you be
able to accomplish these goals where oth
ers have failed?
We're not suggesting that the ASSU is
an ineffective organization, fn our time at
Stanford we've seen not just the short list
of flashy programs like Stanford After
Midnight, but many smaller things which
have improved student life: the business
es run by SSE, the money allocated
through the General and Special Fees,
which supports most of the student run
events and organizations on this campus
or the News Readership Program.
We believe that the ASSU president
and vice-president have a unique oppor
tunity to improve Stanford. But the can
didates should make honest, feasible and
informed proposals during their cam
paigns. We have not seen much of this so
far, but hope the candidates will take this
weekend to consider how their ideas will
work within the framework they will in
herit if elected.
