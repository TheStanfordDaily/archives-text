## Cardinal hopes to be third team to knock off Bruins 
### DEBORAH SPLANSKY STAFF WRITER 
The No. 3 Stanford softball team (33-5,4-
2 Pac-10) is still riding high off of its series
sweep in Oregon heading into this weekend,
while No. 2 UCLA and No. 10 Washington
are eager to prove themselves following a
weekend of upsets and tough losses.
UCLA has sat perched at the No. 1 slot
since late January, but all that changed this
past weekend when it suffered two big loss
es, one to now-No. 1 Arizona and the other
to No. 6 Arizona State.
This Friday, the No. 3 Cardinal will at
tempt to keep the upsets coming when it
takes on the No. 2 Bruins.
Stanford is confident heading down to
Los Angeles.
"I think we can beat UCLA," said senior
first baseman Sarah Beeson. "I think it is
going to be a really good game. I'm just ex
cited to see what they have and show them
what we have."
Both teams have quite a lot.
The Bruins sport the only collegiate soft
ball Olympian, senior catcher Stacey Nuev
man, who is currently batting .543 with 57

for UCLA is junior shortstop Natasha Wat

batting average at the plate with 75 hits.
However, the Bruin bats will be dealt a
challenge this weekend as Cardinal junior
hurlers Maureen LeCocq and Tori Nyberg
are at the collegiate peaks in circle.
LeCocq currently boasts the Pacific 10
Pitcher of the Week honor, following a
two-shutout performance this past
week, versus No. 14 Oregon State and
No. 12 Fresno State.

The Huskies are a strong team
and the Cardinal realizes that it
must play to its full potential to
take two in the Seattle stadium.
