# Track heads to Berkeley for NCAA qualifying meet
## 
### DANIEL URBAN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford and UCLA teamed up last
weekend against the Arizona schools,
putting aside petty rivalries for the larger
goal of demonstrating the superiority of the
state of California.

TRACK & FIELD
Friday-Saturday: Stanford competes
at the Brutus Hamilton Invitational, all
day, Berkeley

It's doubtful that the Cardinal will
get any such support from the Uni
versity of California.
Nevertheless, the Stanford track
squad will venture into hostile territory
to compete at Berkeley twice this year
once this weekend for the Brutus
Hamilton Invitational and once for the
annual Big Meet, the track equivalent of
Big Game.
Teams from Cal, Stanford, UC-Davis,
Nevada, Sacramento State, Cal-State

Fullerton and San Francisco State will com
pete at the Invitational.
Though the meet will not be
scored, many athletes will still be
looking for Pac-10 and NCAA auto
matic qualifying marks.
Several qualifying marks were
achieved at last weekend's California vs.
Arizona Challenge in Arizona, despite
heavy winds.
With hopefully more mild conditions across
the Bay this weekend, the Cardinal will be
looking for faster times, bigger jumps and
longer throws.
"We'll focus more on attaining
NCAA times in the next two week
ends," said senior Maurica Carlucci
after her win in the 800 meters at last
weekend's meet.
"At Berkeley on Saturday and the fol
lowing weekend at Mt. Sac, we should be set
to really rack up the qualifiers. Our hope is
to get 15 men and 15 women qualified for
the NCAAs by the end of May."
