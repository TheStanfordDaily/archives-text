# Track heads to Berkeley for NCAA qualifying meet
## 
### DANIEL URBAN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford and UCLA teamed up last
weekend against the Arizona schools,
putting aside petty rivalries for the larger
goal of demonstrating the superiority of the
state of California.

TRACK & FIELD
Friday-Saturday: Stanford competes
at the Brutus Hamilton Invitational, all
day, Berkeley

It's doubtful that the Cardinal will
get any such support from the Uni
versity of California.
Nevertheless, the Stanford track
squad will venture into hostile territory
to compete at Berkeley twice this year
once this weekend for the Brutus
Hamilton Invitational and once for the
annual Big Meet, the track equivalent of
Big Game.
Teams from Cal, Stanford, UC-Davis,
Nevada, Sacramento State, Cal-State

Fullerton and San Francisco State will com
pete at the Invitational.
Though the meet will not be
scored, many athletes will still be
looking for Pac-10 and NCAA auto
matic qualifying marks.
Several qualifying marks were
achieved at last weekend's California vs.
Arizona Challenge in Arizona, despite
heavy winds.
With hopefully more mild conditions across
the Bay this weekend, the Cardinal will be
looking for faster times, bigger jumps and
longer throws.
"We'll focus more on attaining
NCAA times in the next two week
ends," said senior Maurica Carlucci
after her win in the 800 meters at last
weekend's meet.
"At Berkeley on Saturday and the fol
lowing weekend at Mt. Sac, we should be set
to really rack up the qualifiers. Our hope is
to get 15 men and 15 women qualified for
the NCAAs by the end of May."
Even this early in the season,
the Cardinal is well on its way,
with five athletes already owning
NCAA automatic marks-senior
Caroline Annis (10,000 meters,
34:09.40), sophomore Jillian Ca
marena (shot put, 53 feet, 10
inches), junior Louis Luchini
(10,000 meters, 28:49.86), se
nior Jonathon Riley (5,000 me
ters, 13:40.59) and sophomore
Don Sage (10,000 meters,
28:40.12).
All five of these marks rank sev
enth or better in Stanford's history.
While always pushing for the
automatic qualifier and a guaran

teed trip to Baton Rouge for the
NCAA Championship, many
other Stanford athletes own
strong provisional qualifying
marks that would stand a very
good chance of making the na
tional championships.
While technically a two-day meet,
most of the action will take place on
Saturday. The only Friday event will
be the hammer throw, taking place
at 2 p.m.
The rest of the field events will
be held on Saturday, starting with
the women's javelin at 9 a.m.
The gun will go off for the first
running event, the women's 4 x
100 meters, at noon on Saturday,
and the men's 4 x 400 meters will
conclude the meet at 4:10. All
events will be held at Berkeley's
Edwards Stadium.
