# Baseball hosts top-ranked USC
## The 						team looks to bounce back after Pac-10 rules Arizona game a loss 
### MALCOLM LEVINE STAFF WRITER 
With a gaudy 22-7 (2-1 Pacific 10
Conference) record and a No. 2
ranking in the nation, it is quite odd
that the Cardinal is looking up in the
standings at an opponent.

MEN'S BASEBALL
Tonight: No. 2 Stanford vs. No. 1
USC, 6:00 p.m., Sunken Diamond
Saturday: No. 2 Stanford vs. No. 1
USC, 1:00 p.m., Sunken Diamond
Sunday: No. 2 Stanford vs. No.l
USC, 1:00 p.m., Sunken Diamond

But that unfamiliar place is exactly
where Stanford finds itself this weekend,
as No. 1 Southern California (18-14, 5-1
Pac-10) comes to Sunken Diamond sit
ting atop the Pac-10 conference in the
early going.
Since Pac-10 officials have since decid
ed that last Sunday's eight-inning game
between Stanford and Arizona — which
was halted with Arizona leading 15-13 —
is a done deal, the Cardinal was handed
its first conference loss, putting the team
a game and a half behind the Trojans.
Shaking off a tough start that saw
USC drop from a preseason No. 4
ranking all the way out of the
top2s — highlighted by the storied
program's worst loss ever, a 31-7 de
feat at the hands of Loyola Mary

mount — the Trojans have rebound
ed, peaking just in time for Pac-10.
The Cardinal and the Trojans have al
ready met this season, fora three-game
non-conference series down in Los An
geles. For the first time since 1997, Stan
ford completed a sweep of the Trojans at
USC, with all three of the victories com
ing in close games.
The Trojans come into this weekend
hot, having won seven of their last eight
games. But the Cardinal is in no way to
be outdone, having won 15 of its last 18
games as well as 11 consecutive regular
season series.
Junior designated hitter Jason Coop

er has been on a tear lately, taking the
team lead in batting average (.394),
home runs (7), and RBI (32) — a true
Triple Crown threat. After last week
end's eruption in Arizona, the Cardinal
is now averaging an awesome 8.3 runs
per game, while hitting at a .324 clip.
While the team's. offensive prowess
has been highly documented, it has been
the Cardinal's pitching that has tvmied
opponents all season long.
Much of the Cardinal's success in re
cent weeks can be attributed to the so
lidification of the bullpen, which has

been able to complement the
much-vaunted starting rotation.
Junior Ryan McCally (2-0, 4
saves) has anchored the relatively
inexperienced relieving core, giv
ing up only two runs in 23 innings
of relief work, while hurlers such
as junior Darin Naatjes (2-0, 2

saves), freshman Johnny Dyer (2-
0, 5 2/3 IP, 0.00 ERA) and sopho
more David O' Hagan (0-0, 10 1/3
IP, 3.48 ERA) have developed
much better and faster than head
coach Mark Marquess could ever
have hoped for.
This weekend, the bullpen will
be able to perform in front of its
biggest audience of the year, as
Saturday's showdown will be tele
vised live on Fox Sports Net. The
network has chosen to highlight

one of the greatest rivalries in all of
collegiate baseball.
The series gets underway on
Friday at 6 p.m. when Cardinal ace
Jeremy Guthrie (6-0,3.08) will bat
tle Trojan righthander Anthony
Reyes (1-0, 1.38). Guthrie, a ju
nior, will be going for his 12th con
secutive victory, dating back to last
season. This streak has stayed alive
with no-decisions in each of his last
two starts.
Saturday's televised matchup be

gins at 1 p.m., as Stanford will send
junior southpaw Tim Cunningham
(5-1, 2.67) to the hill to face USC
lefty Matt Chico (4-3,5.24).
The Trojans have yet to an
nounce their starter for Sunday's 1
p.m. game, but be will be facing
sophomore righty John Hudgins
(5-0, 4.70), who is tied for second
on the Cardinal in both victories
and strikeouts.
As always, all three games will
be broadcast on KZSU, 90.1 FM.

been able to complement the
much-vaunted starting rotation.
Junior Ryan McCally (2-0, 4
saves) has anchored the relatively
inexperienced relieving core, giv
ing up only two runs in 23 innings
of relief work, while hurlers such
as junior Darin Naatjes (2-0, 2

saves), freshman Johnny Dyer (2-
0, 5 2/3 IP, 0.00 ERA) and sopho
more David O' Hagan (0-0, 10 1/3
IP, 3.48 ERA) have developed
much better and faster than head
coach Mark Marquess could ever
have hoped for.
This weekend, the bullpen will
be able to perform in front of its
biggest audience of the year, as
Saturday's showdown will be tele
vised live on Fox Sports Net. The
network has chosen to highlight

one of the greatest rivalries in all of

secutive victory, dating back to last
