## 
### KATRINA LAKE STAFF WRITER 
One last pre-tournament question will
be resolved this weekend:
Home or away?
The No. 7 Stanford (15-8, 14-6,
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)

ranked Pepperdine (23-4, 18-2) this

weekend will answer that question.
The Cardinal played in its last reg
ular-season home match last week,
but if all goes well this weekend, Stan
ford fans will have one last opportu
nity to see the team in action.
The Cardinal currently occupies
fifth place in conference standings.
Teams occupying the one through
four spots will have home-court ad
vantage in the MPSF Tournament,
making this weekend's matches espe
cially critical for Stanford.
Though Pepperdine has success
fully secured the top spot, UCLA,
Hawaii, Brigham Young, and Stan
ford are within two games of each
other, whether Stanford will still be
fifth after this weekend is uncertain.
For example, if Stanford wins at
least one of its two games and ties
with BYU, Stanford will gain home
court advantage for the first round of
the playoffs.

likely to face — BYU and Hawaii —

are also the two teams whose
fans have the worst reputation
of heckling, taunting, and mak
ing matches difficult in general
to play. The home-court advan
tage will likely be a determining
factor in matches against any of
these closely matched teams.
"Having the home court is
always important, but it is espe
cially important in these match
es to have the home court," said

Coach Don Shaw. "Not only do
BYU and Hawaii both require a
lot of travel, but their crowds
tend to be merciless hecklers."
In its last home match
against No. 15 UC-Irvine (11-
15, 5-15) last week, the Cardi
nal came back after a first game
loss to win the match 27-30, 30-
27, 30-21, 30-26.
Junior opposite Curt Toppel
contributed to the team's third
consecutive conference victory
by posting a match-high 23 kills.
Spectacular performances
from junior libero Seth Ring
and junior outside hitter Mar

cus Skacel added splendor to a
routine Cardinal victory. Ring
tied a career and match-high 14
digs while Skacel finished a
well-rounded game with two
aces, four digs and 16 kills.
The Cardinal outhit the
Anteaters .350 to .296 for the
match. Stanford hopes fora
similar victory against USC on
Friday, whom they shut out (3-
0) on February 26th.
On Saturday, the Cardinal
will wrap up the season with a
tough match against top
ranked Pepperdine.
Though Stanford successful

ly pushed the Waves to five
games in their last match, the
Cardinal fates an uphill battle
on Pepperdine turf against the
best team in the country.
After this weekend, the ques
tion of where and who will be
answered— but Stanford vol
leyball's not done yet.
"The season's not over," said
Shaw. "We've improved over
the course of this season, we've
been playing well, and we know
that we can play competitively.
But, the bottom line is, after
this week, we win and we keep
playing, we lose, and we stop."
