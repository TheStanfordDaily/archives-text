# Water polo opens weekend with a 'Big Splash'
## 
### KIMBERLY ROBERTS STAFF WRITER 
As it approaches the end of its regular sea
son, the No. 2 Stanford women's water polo
team has suffered only one loss in its 17 regular
season games.
On Friday the women will look to end
their season undefeated at home as they
compete in their final match at Avery
Aquatic Center this year in the "Big
Splash," against California.
Last weekend, Stanford went three for three
at Avery Aquatics Center, defeating San Diego
State (12-4), Long Beach State (11-5) and UC-
Irvine (13-3).
On Friday, Stanford will look to continue

WOMEN'S WATER POLO
Tonight: No. 2 Stanford vs. No. 4 Cali
fornia, 7:00 p.m., Avery Aquatics Center
Sunday: No. 2 Stanford vs. UC-Davis,
1:00 p.m., Davis

this streak as it faces No. 4 California (14-6,7-2
MPSF) at 7:00 p.m.
Even though Stanford defeated the Bears in
a dominating 9-4 victory earlier this season in
their first meeting, Cal is currently on a hot
streak, having won 10 of its last 11 games.
Big Splash is more than just a match between
bitter Bay Area rivals. This year it will be the
final home game for Stanford's three seniors:
driver Margie Dingeldein and setters Kate Petit

and Ellen Estes.
While Big Splash represents the first of
many "ends" for Cardinal seniors, it is not the
final time Dingeldein, Petit and Estes will ever
suit up.
After the Big Splash, the Cardinal will travel
north on Sunday to take on UC-Davis (18-10),
who went one for one last weekend, defeating
San Diego and losing to Loyola Marymount.
Stanford willbe looking to sophomore Bren
da Villa in its matches this weekend. Villa has
scored 44 goals in only 17 games this season for
an average of 2.59 goals per game.
Due in part to Villa's offensive presence,
Stanford has been on a scoring rampage,
outscoring its opponents 178-60 and 57-12 in
the first quarter.
