in double digits in 28 of her last 32
games as a Cardinal. The 6-foot-1
forward was an Honorable Men
tion AP All-American selection this
season and participated with En
ghusen on the gold-medal win
ning United States World Univer
sity Games Team last summer.
Enghusen, a 6-foot-7 center,
broke the school's blocked-shot
record by rejecting 58 potential
buckets during the season to finish
her collegiate career with 136. She
averaged 5.3 points and 3.4 re
bounds a game this season.
