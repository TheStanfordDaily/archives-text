# ASSU candidates debate
## 
### JOHN HUETTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's doubtful
anyone thought
campus politics
was boring after
the 2002 ASSU
Presidential De
bate last night, as

the five presidential slates discussed them
selves and election issues before a rowdy,
heckling crowd at the Coffee House.
"It was really intense," said sophomore
Chris Cox, who watched the show.
The debate opened as junior Peter
Stair, a member of the organization
Think!, took the microphone unexpected
ly from the audience.
"I would like to respect the thought that
went to organizing the debate," he said,
but then asked the crowd, "I'm curious
what you would like the format of the de
bate to be."
"I like it the way it is," an audience mem
ber called, and Stair eventually resumed his
seat after asking a few more questions.
Candidates then had two minutes to
make opening statements.
"Kendra [Arimoto] and I are running to
address student suspicions that the ASSU
means little to student life," candidate Josh
Benson, a junior, said. The answer to diis
problem — as well as increasing student
input into the ASSU and university — he

said, started with communication.
"[Our] function is representing student
interests to the University administration,
said candidate Monica Henestroza, a junior.
"We also want to make sure that you have
the opportunity to represent yourselves."
"Students need to be more involved,"
Henestroza said.
She and her running mate Nick Ro
driguez, a sophomore, discussed such items
as Stanford Bookstore prices, the Universi
ty decision-making process and the alcohol
policy.
Sophomore Kellea Miller and junior
Malavika Monahan, members of the Think!
organization, spoke next, declaring their
plans to withdraw if elected. "This not out of
disrespect for the ASSU, but out of deep re
spect for the process," Miller said. She said
they desired to create an open forum for dis
cussion with their campaign.
"We're trying to discuss issues that affect
all of us at Stanford," Miller said, and invit
ed everyone to an "überpicnic" in White
Plaza on Monday.
Junior Adrian Perry of the Chappie slate
unveiled his Popularity Contest platform
next, recalling his popularity partially ob
tained by "scoring a touchdown" for "Lin
coln High." "This is the game ball," he said,
holding up a football. "If you want to touch
it, talk to me out of the debate."
