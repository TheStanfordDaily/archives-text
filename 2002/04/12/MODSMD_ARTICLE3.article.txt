# ASSU candidates debate
## 
### JOHN HUETTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's doubtful
anyone thought
campus politics
was boring after
the 2002 ASSU
Presidential De
bate last night, as

the five presidential slates discussed them
selves and election issues before a rowdy,
heckling crowd at the Coffee House.
"It was really intense," said sophomore
Chris Cox, who watched the show.
The debate opened as junior Peter
Stair, a member of the organization
Think!, took the microphone unexpected
ly from the audience.
"I would like to respect the thought that
went to organizing the debate," he said,
but then asked the crowd, "I'm curious
what you would like the format of the de
bate to be."
"I like it the way it is," an audience mem
ber called, and Stair eventually resumed his
seat after asking a few more questions.
Candidates then had two minutes to
make opening statements.
"Kendra [Arimoto] and I are running to
address student suspicions that the ASSU
means little to student life," candidate Josh
Benson, a junior, said. The answer to diis
problem — as well as increasing student
input into the ASSU and university — he

said, started with communication.
"[Our] function is representing student
interests to the University administration,
said candidate Monica Henestroza, a junior.
"We also want to make sure that you have
the opportunity to represent yourselves."
"Students need to be more involved,"
Henestroza said.
She and her running mate Nick Ro
driguez, a sophomore, discussed such items
as Stanford Bookstore prices, the Universi
ty decision-making process and the alcohol
policy.
Sophomore Kellea Miller and junior
Malavika Monahan, members of the Think!
organization, spoke next, declaring their
plans to withdraw if elected. "This not out of
disrespect for the ASSU, but out of deep re
spect for the process," Miller said. She said
they desired to create an open forum for dis
cussion with their campaign.
"We're trying to discuss issues that affect
all of us at Stanford," Miller said, and invit
ed everyone to an "überpicnic" in White
Plaza on Monday.
Junior Adrian Perry of the Chappie slate
unveiled his Popularity Contest platform
next, recalling his popularity partially ob
tained by "scoring a touchdown" for "Lin
coln High." "This is the game ball," he said,
holding up a football. "If you want to touch
it, talk to me out of the debate."

Candidate Josh Benson addressed the crowd at the ASSU Presidential Debate held at the
Coffee House last night. Candidates engaged in a moderated question-and-answer session.

Steinberg, urged the crowd to hold
up signs bearing "buzzwords." "If
you hear 'accountability,' hold up
the sign and take a drink," Perry
said, telling an audience member,
"Finish your beer, nerd."
Throughout the debate, audi
ence members continued to heckle
the debaters with similar signs, such
as "transparency" and"the".
"We are the most representative
slate of all 15,000 students at this
school," junior Mike Osofsky, who
spoke next, said. "We represent the
internal and external interests of
the ASSU."
"[We have] 30 issues in our
campaign," running mate sopho
more Megan Root said, noting
with a smile, "and yes, it is a lot of
issues." They said their ASSU ex
perience gave them the contacts
and experience to improve the
school and ask students, "What's
the problem, what can we do to
solve that problem?"
All candidates were asked during
one point to relate their first "three
issues they would tackle."
"The quarterback doesn't tack
le," Perry said. "I throw the
touchdowns."
Perry and Steinberg's issues
would be popularity, space at Stan
ford (which they plan to make
"taller") and surveys. Steinberg
vowed to keep changing things until
over 99 percent of Stanford stu

dents were satisfied.
Osofsky and Root wanted to
focus on University accountability
to the Stanford community, the
lack of Stanford spirit (they will
work to bring students together to
celebrate Stanford, Root said) and
student space improvements, in
cluding building a graduate stu
dent center and renovating
Tresidder Union. Their work, Os
ofsky said, would be "finding cre
ative solutions with tangible results
for next year."
Benson and Arimoto said ASSU
reforms and student representation
on the Board of Trustees would be
their first two concerns.
"It's absurd that students don't
have a seat at that table," Benson
said in an earlier Daily interview.
Benson said their third objec
tive would be to improve trans
portation. They would allow stu
dents to park in other residence
lots at night and obtain parking
subsidies for off-campus graduate
students, he said.
Rodriguez and Henestroza plan
to engage in a cost-of-living cam
paign to lower Stanford prices.
"How many of you think you pay
too much?" Rodriguez said.
Henestroza said they would dia
logue with community centers to
create a "community supportive of
all students," focusing particularly
on student retention and safety.
Lasdy, they would work more to in
crease University accountability to
students.
Finally, Mohanan and Miller
spoke. "We obviously don't have a

super structured [set of issues],"
Miller said.
"Love!" someone from the
crowd shouted, prompting die duo
to repeat it and jokingly sing "Kum
baya." Instead, the group urged for
a greater living in harmony and
called the crowd to come visit them
so each could get to know each
other better.
"VVe aren't that freakish," Mo
hanan said. "Please come talk to
us, please!"
"1 think the issues actually got
out there," said ASSU Undergrad
uate Senator Sonrisa Lucero, on
hand to watch the debate, "no mat
ter how much the students actually
heard them.
"I'm impressed at the balance
that all the slates are try ing to put
in," Lucero said. "I think people
should concentrate on the top three
issues each candidate said."
Lucero said it was interesting to
see the demeanor and presentation
of each slate. "For me, it's definitely
all issues," Lucero said, "but fora
general audience ... the demeanor
is very important."
Cox, who said he wasn't affiliated
with any group, said he thought all
the slates did well, particularly
under constant heckling, boos and
cheers from the audience.
"I think they were making [the
candidates] do their job," Cox said.
"I think the really critical audi
ence really made people think
about what they were saying," he
continued. "| It] made it harder to
[lie] because people here are quick
to shoot at them."

ofsky said, would be "finding cre
ative solutions with tangible results
for next year."
Benson and Arimoto said ASSU
reforms and student representation
on the Board of Trustees would be
their first two concerns.
"It's absurd that students don't
have a seat at that table," Benson
said in an earlier Daily interview.
Benson said their third objec
tive would be to improve trans
portation. They would allow stu
dents to park in other residence
lots at night and obtain parking
subsidies for off-campus graduate
students, he said.
Rodriguez and Henestroza plan
to engage in a cost-of-living cam
paign to lower Stanford prices.
"How many of you think you pay
too much?" Rodriguez said.
Henestroza said they would dia
logue with community centers to
create a "community supportive of
all students," focusing particularly
on student retention and safety.
Lasdy, they would work more to in
crease University accountability to
students.
Finally, Mohanan and Miller
spoke. "We obviously don't have a

super structured [set of issues],"
Miller said.
"Love!" someone from the
crowd shouted, prompting die duo
to repeat it and jokingly sing "Kum
baya." Instead, the group urged for
a greater living in harmony and
called the crowd to come visit them
so each could get to know each
other better.
"VVe aren't that freakish," Mo
hanan said. "Please come talk to
us, please!"
"1 think the issues actually got
out there," said ASSU Undergrad
uate Senator Sonrisa Lucero, on
hand to watch the debate, "no mat
ter how much the students actually
heard them.
"I'm impressed at the balance
that all the slates are try ing to put
in," Lucero said. "I think people
should concentrate on the top three
issues each candidate said."
Lucero said it was interesting to
see the demeanor and presentation
of each slate. "For me, it's definitely
all issues," Lucero said, "but fora
general audience ... the demeanor
is very important."
Cox, who said he wasn't affiliated
with any group, said he thought all
the slates did well, particularly
under constant heckling, boos and
cheers from the audience.
"I think they were making [the
candidates] do their job," Cox said.
"I think the really critical audi
ence really made people think
about what they were saying," he
continued. "| It] made it harder to
[lie] because people here are quick
to shoot at them."
It's doubtful
anyone thought
campus politics
was boring after
the 2002 ASSU
Presidential De
bate last night, as

the five presidential slates discussed them
selves and election issues before a rowdy,
heckling crowd at the Coffee House.
"It was really intense," said sophomore
Chris Cox, who watched the show.
The debate opened as junior Peter
Stair, a member of the organization
Think!, took the microphone unexpected
ly from the audience.
"I would like to respect the thought that
went to organizing the debate," he said,
but then asked the crowd, "I'm curious
what you would like the format of the de
bate to be."
"I like it the way it is," an audience mem
ber called, and Stair eventually resumed his
seat after asking a few more questions.
Candidates then had two minutes to
make opening statements.
"Kendra [Arimoto] and I are running to
address student suspicions that the ASSU
means little to student life," candidate Josh
Benson, a junior, said. The answer to diis
problem — as well as increasing student
input into the ASSU and university — he

said, started with communication.
"[Our] function is representing student
interests to the University administration,
said candidate Monica Henestroza, a junior.
"We also want to make sure that you have
the opportunity to represent yourselves."
"Students need to be more involved,"
Henestroza said.
She and her running mate Nick Ro
driguez, a sophomore, discussed such items
as Stanford Bookstore prices, the Universi
ty decision-making process and the alcohol
policy.
Sophomore Kellea Miller and junior
Malavika Monahan, members of the Think!
organization, spoke next, declaring their
plans to withdraw if elected. "This not out of
disrespect for the ASSU, but out of deep re
spect for the process," Miller said. She said
they desired to create an open forum for dis
cussion with their campaign.
"We're trying to discuss issues that affect
all of us at Stanford," Miller said, and invit
ed everyone to an "überpicnic" in White
Plaza on Monday.
Junior Adrian Perry of the Chappie slate
unveiled his Popularity Contest platform
next, recalling his popularity partially ob
tained by "scoring a touchdown" for "Lin
coln High." "This is the game ball," he said,
holding up a football. "If you want to touch
it, talk to me out of the debate."

Candidate Josh Benson addressed the crowd at the ASSU Presidential Debate held at the
Coffee House last night. Candidates engaged in a moderated question-and-answer session.

Steinberg, urged the crowd to hold
up signs bearing "buzzwords." "If
you hear 'accountability,' hold up
the sign and take a drink," Perry
said, telling an audience member,
"Finish your beer, nerd."
Throughout the debate, audi
ence members continued to heckle
the debaters with similar signs, such
as "transparency" and"the".
"We are the most representative
slate of all 15,000 students at this
school," junior Mike Osofsky, who
spoke next, said. "We represent the
internal and external interests of
the ASSU."
"[We have] 30 issues in our
campaign," running mate sopho
more Megan Root said, noting
with a smile, "and yes, it is a lot of
issues." They said their ASSU ex
perience gave them the contacts
and experience to improve the
school and ask students, "What's
the problem, what can we do to
solve that problem?"
All candidates were asked during
one point to relate their first "three
issues they would tackle."
"The quarterback doesn't tack
le," Perry said. "I throw the
touchdowns."
Perry and Steinberg's issues
would be popularity, space at Stan
ford (which they plan to make
"taller") and surveys. Steinberg
vowed to keep changing things until
over 99 percent of Stanford stu

dents were satisfied.
Osofsky and Root wanted to
focus on University accountability
to the Stanford community, the
lack of Stanford spirit (they will
work to bring students together to
celebrate Stanford, Root said) and
student space improvements, in
cluding building a graduate stu
dent center and renovating
Tresidder Union. Their work, Os
ofsky said, would be "finding cre
ative solutions with tangible results
for next year."
