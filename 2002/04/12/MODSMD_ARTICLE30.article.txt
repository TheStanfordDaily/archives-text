# Capitol Years: both '60s throwback and indie torchbearer
## 
### BENJAMIN L. FRIEDLAND 
Music for hipsters with aviator sunglass
es and a nicotine addiction, the Philadel-

phia indie band, The
Capitol Years, blends
"Abbey Road"-era Beatles
with "Midnight Vul
tures"-esque Beck. On
"Meet Yr Acres," the
group's debut record,
songwriter Shai, Son of
Eli, impressively inter-

twines the best of'6os pop with the best of
contemporary indie rock.
Despite relatively basic arrangements and
unremarkable playing, "Meet Yr Acres," de
serves attention. Buried within each track's
simplicity lies wonderful, edgy pop that is as
catchy and as cool as most anything else.

The album opens with the stripped
down scorcher "Roller's Row," a low fideli
ty Big Star-style beauty. Combining a
catchy pop melody and chorus with raw

guitar, the track cap
tures Shai's talent, his
influences and his
sound. This gritty,
bare-bones rock song
will move heads and
roll up sleeves. 1
Shifting through
out the record from

ballads to bad-ass, "Meet Yr Acres" consis
tently impresses. Standouts include "Star
Fixer" and "May." An acoustic gem, the for
mer recalls the best of Badfinger while re
taining the group's refreshingly modern
sound. A borderline country tune, "Star
Fixer" will unite classic rock collectors as well

as KZSU diehards. The song serves as a wel
come exhale, as the next track, "May,"
sounds like Beck on heroin shortly after
Vietnam. Psychedelic melodies and a fuzzy,
white-noise chorus combine to rank "May"
as one of the album's best songs.
"Gonna leave your friends behind /
Gonna have a good time / Gonna drink all
kinds of wine / Come on come down to the
rolling hills," sings Shai in the slow Beatle-y
lullaby, "Rolling Hills." Although the song
writer's lyrics may not attract new listeners,
the complete product will. The song is
equal parts stoner rock and Nick Lowe-era
'70's pop and will stay with you well after
you've pushed the stop button.
Although Shai plays all the instruments
on the album, he has reunited with former
bandmates Freel Freine and Dave Wayne
Daniels in order to take the act on the road.

Hie three started playing together in 1997
as the art-rockers Mastercaster; however the
trio quickly disbanded after its debut release.
Shai recorded "Meet Yr Acres" with pro
duction and mixing help from Thorn Mon
ahan, former Lily bassist and current Per
nice Brother. Monahan's impressive pro
duction list includes Beachwood Sparks
and The Silver Jews. The tandem created a
record that is both a '00'r throwback and an
indie torchbearer.
The album's main shortcoming is that
each song sounds strangely familiar: drops of
Pink Floyd, glasses of the Beach Boys and gill
lons of the Beatles — it's all there. That said,
Shai succeeds in claiming these melodies as
his own. Unlike many, die songwriter leans
on his influences to move forward, and "Meet
Yr Acres" stands as a dynamic, inspired and
noteworthy record.
