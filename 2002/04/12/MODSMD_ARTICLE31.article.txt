# Paul live: 'We have come here to rock you tonight!'

The set
ting was
proverbial
and the at
mosphere
was restless as
a sold-out

crowd at San Jose's Compaq Cen
ter waited for the night's feature
attraction on April 3 — the only
surviving Beatle with real talent.
There are few musicians who
are majestic enough not to need
an opening band and Paul Mc-
Cartney is one of them. In place
of an opening band, there was an
interesting theatrical production
involving costumed dancers and
performers. The procession
highlighted America's diverse
history, starting with performers
in British colonial dress and later
joined by Spanish dancers and
Samurais. The act stressed unity
when performers ambled onto
stage carrying balloons painted as
globes. The commencement was
fitting given McCartney's efforts
to raise money for the victims of
the Sept. 11 attacks.
As the act drew to a close, a
huge white curtain engulfed the
stage with McCartney standing
behind it, revealing his silhou
ette. As the curtain was raised he
was standing, holding his classic
Rickenbacker bass guitar from
the early Beatles days. McCart
ney then began to play the open
ing measures of "Hello Good
bye" from 1967's "Magical Mys
tery Tour." He then wasted no
time playing "Jet" by Wings and
the Beatles classic "All My Lov
ing." McCartney then addressed
screaming audience saying, "We
have come here to rock you
tonight!" Then he played 1967's
"Getting Better" from "Sgt. Pep-

per's Lonely Hearts Club,"a
song he had not previously per-

formed live.
Sir Paul played
a total of 37 tunes, half
of which were from his
Beatles days. During a
brief pause between
songs he said, "I won't

ask you if you are en joying your
selves. It's obvious." He contin
ued with numbers from his cur
rent "Driving Rain" album. Fol
lowing these numbers he entered
into a three-song set featuring
him alone on acoustic guitar. He
then invited his band back on
stage for "Vanilla Sky" before
branching off into another solo
set featuring him on his custom
psychedelic painted piano.
The concert hit a somber
note when Paul dedicated two
songs to his deceased friends
and former bandmates, John
Lennon and George Harrison.
He lamented that "Sometimes
in life you do not get a chance to
say everything you wanted to."
He shouted "Let's hear it for
John!" as he introduced "Here
Today," his tribute to Lennon.
At the end of the song, McCart
ney was evidently shaken as
tears began to bead up in his
eyes. He then began to describe
a time when George played a
song for him on ukulele and
how George was always experi
menting with different instru
ments, before playing Harri
son's landmark 1969 song
"Something" on ukulele.
McCartney livened up the at
mosphere after the tributes by
playing an assortment of songs
including "Freedom," "Eleanor
Rigby," and "Let it Be." He
capped off the set by asking
everyone to join in as he played
the opening chords to "Hey

Jude." Paul and his backup musi
cians then left the stage as the
crowd begged for an encore.
That encore came in the form of
1970's "The Long and Winding
Road," "Lady Madonna," and"I
Saw Her Standing There." Paul
surprised the packed house by
playing a second encore includ
ing "Yesterday"and "Sgt. Pep
per's' Lonely Hearts Club Band."
He morphed 1969's "The End"
into "Sgt. Pepper's" to cap ofTan
extraordinary concert.
It is rare that one person can
put on such a great show, but
Paul pulled it off. Playing almost
40 songs while frequently ad
dressing Che crowd and cracking
jokes, Paul was obviously enjoy
ing himself too. The concert was
a testament to Paul's success and
a tribute to not only the victims of
Sept. 11, but to fellow bandmates
Lennon and Harrison. The only
complaint I have is that he had to
stop playing.


Come on, Paul, don't you know that
cigarettes kill?
