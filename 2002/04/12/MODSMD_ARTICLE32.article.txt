If there were some way to com
bine Lou Reed's lazy introspection
with Marvin Gaye's sex appeal, you
might be able to capture the essence
of Eric Gregory. As lead singer of
Portland's Crack City Rockers, he

Dennis Mitchell (guitar) and Curt Schultz (drums) twist old and new, happi
ness and frustration and love and lust on "Joyce Hotel," their debut album.
Through tales of urban angst and lethargic, bittersweet love, "Joyce
Hotel" boiTows liberally from the punk rock masters of late 1970's New York
City. "Rolling Yr Eyes Blue" combines these two themes in lyrics like, "I
spend my days in the city / And the nights are for yr arms / The sun never
looks better after a night of yr dancing charms."

With shades of the New
York Dolls, Richard Hell, the
Talking Heads and a late-era
Velvet Underground, each of
the songs pays subde tribute to
the past without appearing too
imitative. This definitely is not
the Strokes we're talking
about. And though there are
plenty of cool, indolent tracks
on "Joyce Hotel," there are just
as many that burst with

unadulterated manic anxiety.
"Born Nervous" and " Beggar and a Chooser" could have been written by
a more disciplined version of the Stooges that wasn't so obsessed with rabid
destruction and screaming. It's fairly easy to imagine Iggy Pop yelling the
lyrics from "Born Nervous," "I'm lust-driven and I like it that way." "Hey
World" is a neurotic, paranoid fuck-you to anyone and everything. Gregory
sounds like a possessed man as he yells, "I go out of my skin / To prove that
I'm here / Hoping for the best / And gasping for air."
And as you might expect from a band that takes its cues from Iggy Pop
and Lou Reed, sex and lust are frequent themes throughout the album. Dur
ing "Rolling Yr Eyes Blue," Gregory announces to a woman that "If you'd
only take me home you can cum all nite long/And I swear I'll pass out on
the floor." Sounds appealing, doesn't it?
In the hands of a lesser band, the active pining for sex in many of the songs
might seem self-indulgent or sleazy. "Joyce Hotel," however, is laced with an
attitude of intense self-criticism that at times borders on self-loathing. Lou
Reed's ghost creeps through these songs. You can almost hear his voice from
the Velvet Underground classic, "Heroin," a song about a visit to a heroin
dealer in uptown New York City: "Up to Lexington / One-two-five / Feel
sick, and dirty / More dead than alive." In fact, many of the slower songs add
to this atmosphere with hazy, melancholy blues guitar licks that are reminis
cent of Robert Johnson.
flie Crack City Rockers might be students of the past but they are defi
nitely creating something special fora new generation.


Could this band really be from Portland?
