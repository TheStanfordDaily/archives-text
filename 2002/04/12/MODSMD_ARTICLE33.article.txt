# Film not just for 'Beginners'

In the bleak, wintry suburbs ofCopen-

hagen, six singles
seek romance and
companionship in
the face of death,
hardship and loneli
ness in the unique
and gorgeous Dan
ish film "Italian for
Beginners."

Most striking about the film is its ex
quisite rawness. Screenwriter and direc
tor Lone Scherfig brings to the canvas a
palette of ordinary people who, when
filmed closely, are not exceptional by ap
pearance or by virtue. Their faces, bodies
and psychoses are not made over or
touched up on camera, and as a result,
the emotional vulnerabilities of each
character appear as an extension of his or
her physical imperfections. Such an ap
proach on the part of Scherfig in both vi
sual technique and characterization
charms the audience, and while the film is
in Danish with English subtitles, the
quirkiness and real-life believability of the
characters and their problems are not lost
in the translation.
The film documents six characters
whose lives gradually become inter
twined, beginning with Andreas (Anders
W. Berthelsen). A mousy yet loveable pas
tor whose wife has just died, Andreas has
taken a job as a temporary pastor in a
church while also dealing with his new
found status as a widower.

Andreas soon meets Jorgen

Mortensen (Peter Gautzler), a hotel
clerk who learns from manage-

ment that he must
fire his co-worker
and best friend
Hal-Finn (Lars
Kaalund), a hilari
ously rude waiter.
Enter three more
characters — a

klutzy and socially
awkward pastry-shop girl who is
verbally abused by her ailing fa
ther, a sultry hairdresser dealing
with her mother's terminal illness
and a spirited but lonely Italian
waitress — and the stage is set for

comedy and romance when the lot of
them find themselves enrolled in a be
ginning Italian class.
Each character, in one way or another,
is seeking to escape aspects of dreariness
in his or her own life through learning
Italian, which to them represents the
love, passion and excitement missing
from their day-to-day existence. While it
does become fairly obvious which charac
ters will end up together early in the film,
the unlikely matches of their personalities
and the quick wit of the dialogue in "Ital
ian for Beginners" compensates for jokes
and situations that, in English, would
probably be viewed as cheesy.
The settings inhabited by each charac
ter are rather mundane — the sterile
community college classroom, dark
wood-paneled hair salon and run-down

church are not at all glamorous, but it is

this realness that gives the characters fla
vor. Unlike the calculated, "Sixth Sense"-
esque character entanglements that fall
so neatly together in major American
blockbusters, Scherfig utilizes a light
sense of humor and irony with the mis
fortunes of every character as well as in
geniously intricate relational ties among
them that brings their stories together in
a realistic way. In this vein, "Italian for
Beginners" brings a certain freshness to
the table by focusing upon something
that has been missing in mainstream
movies for years: characterization.
While it may be devoid of designer
clothing, explosions, perfect makeup jobs
and big Hollywood names, this film high
lights a delightful, enchanting quirkiness
and a certain beauty of the ordinary that
is not to be missed.
