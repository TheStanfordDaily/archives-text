"Kissing Jessica
Dir. Charles (W 112 IV/
Herman-Wurmfeld
Fox Searchlight

The screen
blackens. The giggly
female couple finally
gels it on, and this is
your view: nonexis
tent! They turned
the lights out on you.
You will get over

your disappointment though, as "Kissing Jessica Stein" en
tertains you with recognizable characters and a well-written
script that does not patronize your intelligence.
After dating a series of male losers, neurotic and perfec
tionistic journalist Jessica Stein (Jennifer Westfeldt) answers a
women-seeking-women ad on an impulse, meeting horny art
curator Helen Cooper (Heather Juergensen). The film uses

their ensuing relationship to take an in
timidating topic and challenge defini
tions and boundaries of sexuality.
Actresses Jennifer Westfeldt and
Juergensen wrote the script, which
began as a theater production while
they were at Yale.
The couple is accompanied on
screen by Tovah Feldshuh's excellent
performance as Jessica's all-knowing
Jewish mother and Jackie Hoffman as
her hilarious, pregnant best friend. A
throng of pathetically amusing men
punctuates the film.
Details distinguish this movie from
your average flick. The words have
meaning, the felicitous soundtrack

provides subtle humor, and the cinematography enhances
the story line. It's like Dr. Seuss: so well-done there's some
thing for everyone.
This coherent package makes the movie appeal to all
audiences — young, old, male, female, homosexual,
straight or somewhere in between, everyone in the theater
laughed. Some cried.
Why only four stars fora funny, fantastic movie that
prompted me to go back a second time with my girl
friends? Consider Stephen Spielberg's "Artificial Intelli
gence" — if he had not screwed up the ending, it would
have been much better.
One out-of-place line delivered by Jessica in the last 10 min
utes changed the viewer's entire perception of the movie. The
writers spent an hour and a half capturing the audience and
blurring concepts of straight and gay in favor of one universal
concept of love, and one line ruins it all. Who pissed off the

writers at the end?
While Jessica's sexuality is
in question, one wonders if
she lias any sexuality at all.
One gets the impression that
the gender of her significant
other is not the real issue; she
would just rather go to bed
with a book.
"Kissing Jessica Stein" is
far superior to its drab classi
fication as a romantic come
dy, so do not let that stop
you from buying a ticket. It
plays in San Francisco and at
the newly remodeled Palo
Alto Square theater.
