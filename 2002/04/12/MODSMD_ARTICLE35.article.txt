It's a sad state of
affairs when Leonard
Maltin — that übiqui
tous critic who after all
these years of watching
movies still can't seem to
offer insightful analysis

about any of them — is your saving grace. But that's
exactly the sort of trouble Barry Sonnenfeld's "Big
Trouble" finds itself in.
Originally slated for release last September, the
film was necessarily pushed back because of its cli
max, which features a nuclear bomb making its
way on board a commercial airplane. Because of
its plot, many critics seem to be giving the film
short shrift, unwilling to admit that it's the slight
est bit funny — Mr. Maltin is in the minority that
thinks it is. Thanks, Leonard. For once you may
be on to something.
"Big Trouble" is based on Dave Barry's 1998
novel of the same name and boasts a jaw-dropping
cast of familiar actors. A detailed plot synopsis would
be impossible, but the story is set off when a high
schooler (Ben Foster) attacks a classmate (Zooey De
schanel of "Almost Famous") at her home with a
water gun as part of a school Assassins game. Unbe
knownst to either of them, a pair of real hitmen
(Dennis Farina and Jack Kehler) are attempting to
make a hit on the victim's father (a manic Stanley
Tucci) at the same time.
Tim Allen provides the narrative center of the
story as the father of the high school assassin, but this
label is arbitrarily applied; the mayhem thai ensues
incorporates an endless cast of zany characters por
trayed by the likes of Rene Russo, Jason Lee, Tom
Sizemore, Janeane Garofalo, Patrick Warburton,
Omar Epps and even Andy Richter and MTV Jack
ass Johnny Knoxville thrown in for g(X)d measure.
Sonnenfeld also directed the superb "Get
Shorty," another comedy set in Miami that benefit
ed from superior source material (Elmore
Leonard's novel), and it's clear he's trying to repli
cate that success here — both Russo and Farina are
welcome holdovers from that film.
Aside from the unspeakable crudity of "Wild
Wild West," most of Sonnenfeld's movies have a dis
tinct visual flair that makes them appealing to look
at. "Big Trouble" holds to that rule.
But what really makes it work is the huge cast,
who all do a great job of building off each other.
The haphazard plot spreads their characteriza
tions excruciatingly thin, but almost every mo
ment spent with each is a delight. From Garofalo
and Warburton's amusing team of police officers
to Sizemore and Knoxville's bumbling idiots, each
actor maintains a presence even while the plot at
tempts to whisk them away from us. Many carica
tures are completely over the top (Omar Epps and
Dwight Myers as a pair of gung-ho FBI agents, and
Lee as a Frito-chomping Jesus figure), but the fun
is in seeing how they all come together in the
screwball storyline.
1 can see how some might balk at the style of
humor or likely simplification of the novel, but to
completely dismiss "Big Trouble" is an injustice to
Sonnenfeld and his cast. The ending setpiece in
volving airport security is not offensive but simply
unfortunate. Considering what normally passes for
comedy these days, this is a studio film that actual
ly works, and shouldn't have this small weakness
held against it.
