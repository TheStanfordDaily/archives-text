Trying to squeeze

Tambien" and the fol
lowing talk by writer/
director Alfonso

Cuaron lacked none of the pleasures an
elephant experiences while squeezing it
self into tin can. Supine bodies lined the
stage like rows of rapt sardines, and aisles
were crowded with viewers standing
shoulder to shoulder, sometimes three
bodies deep. Nonetheless, the wild laugh
ter, reverential silences and the final ex
plosion of applause at the film's conclu
sion testified to the enormously powerful,
as well as enjoyable, impression the film
made on even the most inconvenienced
viewer. In other words, the cramped legs
and sore necks were worth it.
Cuaron, originally from Mexico but cur
rently living in New York, is not new to
filmmaking. "A Little Princess" and "Creat
Expectations," his most widely known
films, were attempts at the Hollywood stu
dio film and received mixed critical reac
tions. Though Cuaron said he identifies
himself as a lover of movies and not a mem
ber of any particular national or regional
cinema, that "Y Tu Mama Tambien" rep
resents his embrace of a distinctly non-Hol
lywood sensibility. While he modestly hesi
tated to accept the labels of historical, artis
tic and political importance the night's
other speakers kept lavishing on him, his
film does indeed seem a definitive moment
for what was being described that night as
"The New Latin American Cinema" and as
a cinema of liberation.

and recognizable story. It is the classic trav
el narrative, the adolescent buddy movie,

the sexual coming-of-age
story. Tenoch (Diego
Luna) and Julio (Cael Gar
cia Bernal) are two pot
smoking, butt-scratching,
wanker-whacking, hor
mone-happy adolescents
whose girlfriends have just

left for Europe. After jokingly inviting
Tenoch's sexy 28-year-old cousin, Luisa
(Maribel Verdu), to accompany them to a
mythical beach, a catalyzing event in Luisa's
own life causes her to call them the next day,
asking when they plan on leaving. As they
make their way to a beach that may not exist,
sexual romps and revelations are ex
changed among the three.
Part of the genius of Cuaron is that he uses
many conventions of cinematic form, giving
the audience a way into die text and all the
pleasures one expects when going to the
movies, and then, ever so delicately, explodes
those conventions. While there are some titil
lating sex scenes, die sex is never gratuitous
and is by no means the focus of the movie.
Cuaron said his movie, ultimately, is about an
inner journey for identity, and that as this
journey unfolds "the characters start to real
ize there is something outside of them that is
beyond their control, and that is life." In this
context, sex serves as one among many are
nas in which these forces can play out. Sex
comes to be an experience which is both ego
tistical and overpowering, both innocent and
painful, both a badge of manhood and a tes
timony to adolescent immaturity, both an ex
pression of love and a tool for revenge.
This much would have made a successful
film, but it is the way that this film transcends
its genre that truly makes it a masterpiece.
Cuaron described his film as an attempt to
break away from the more subjective narra-

tions of his previous works
and to present a more ob
jective reality, to "observe
reality from a distance"
and not let the viewer "get
too comfy in the narra
tive." Indeed, the camera
often pans away from the
characters to show us the
inner workings of a
kitchen in the restaurant
where they eat, or peas
ants being stopped by
armed police as the car
drives by, placing more
emphasis on the context
than on subject.
Cuaron parallels the
camera's objective gaze
with a voice-over narra
tion, a notoriously un
wieldy device diat he pulls
off with uninterrupted

grace. In no way does "Y Tu Mama Tam
bien" shy away from raising from very serious
issues, ranging from the political and eco
nomic condition of Mexico, to the human ex
perience of pain, identity and mortality, to
questions of gender and sexual identity and
behavior. As the camera moves from individ
uals to a larger view, the narration serves to
expand the film's reality, whether it be speak
ing of economic and political strife in Mexico,
the way Luisa feels at dinner parties or the
small gestures of dassism the friends enact.
Cuaron balances the tensions between indi
vidual experience and greater social forces
with great sensitivity, without either glorify
ing or degrading the individual.
The film's conclusion only heightens the
importance of such issues. While the ending
will no doubt strike some as abrupt and in
clusive, I believe this is the point. Cuaron's re
jection of a Hollywood tendency to reduce, to

wrap up all the loose, fragmented strings and
to resolve very simply and superficially prob
lems that, in the real world, have not been,
and perhaps cannot be, resolved, strikes me
as peculiarly Brechtian. "Y Tu Mama Tam
bien" does not allow the viewer to walk away
without giving some serious consideration,
and possibly even action, to real world prob
lems that are very, very serious.
This is not to give the impression that "Y
Tu Mama Tambien" is didactic, dry or un
relentingly depressing. It is a visual plea
sure, from its lineup of exquisite and ex
quisitely talented actors to its beautiful land
scapes of Mexico. It is emotionally very en
gaging, and, quite often, bitingly, wonder
fully funny. Oscar Wilde wrote, "It takes
courage to see the world in all its tainted
glory and still love it." Cuaron doesjust that,
and, what is more, gives his audience the gift
of being able to see it and to love it too.

tated to accept the labels of historical, artis
tic and political importance the night's
other speakers kept lavishing on him, his
film does indeed seem a definitive moment
for what was being described that night as
"The New Latin American Cinema" and as
a cinema of liberation.

and recognizable story. It is the classic trav
el narrative, the adolescent buddy movie,

the sexual coming-of-age
story. Tenoch (Diego
Luna) and Julio (Cael Gar
cia Bernal) are two pot
smoking, butt-scratching,
wanker-whacking, hor
mone-happy adolescents
whose girlfriends have just

left for Europe. After jokingly inviting
Tenoch's sexy 28-year-old cousin, Luisa
(Maribel Verdu), to accompany them to a
mythical beach, a catalyzing event in Luisa's
own life causes her to call them the next day,
asking when they plan on leaving. As they
make their way to a beach that may not exist,
sexual romps and revelations are ex
changed among the three.
Part of the genius of Cuaron is that he uses
many conventions of cinematic form, giving
the audience a way into die text and all the
pleasures one expects when going to the
movies, and then, ever so delicately, explodes
those conventions. While there are some titil
lating sex scenes, die sex is never gratuitous
and is by no means the focus of the movie.
Cuaron said his movie, ultimately, is about an
inner journey for identity, and that as this
journey unfolds "the characters start to real
ize there is something outside of them that is
beyond their control, and that is life." In this
context, sex serves as one among many are
nas in which these forces can play out. Sex
comes to be an experience which is both ego
tistical and overpowering, both innocent and
painful, both a badge of manhood and a tes
timony to adolescent immaturity, both an ex
pression of love and a tool for revenge.
This much would have made a successful
film, but it is the way that this film transcends
its genre that truly makes it a masterpiece.
Cuaron described his film as an attempt to
break away from the more subjective narra-

tions of his previous works
and to present a more ob
jective reality, to "observe
reality from a distance"
and not let the viewer "get
too comfy in the narra
tive." Indeed, the camera
often pans away from the
characters to show us the
inner workings of a
kitchen in the restaurant
where they eat, or peas
ants being stopped by
armed police as the car
drives by, placing more
emphasis on the context
than on subject.
Cuaron parallels the
camera's objective gaze
with a voice-over narra
tion, a notoriously un
wieldy device diat he pulls
off with uninterrupted

grace. In no way does "Y Tu Mama Tam
bien" shy away from raising from very serious
issues, ranging from the political and eco
nomic condition of Mexico, to the human ex
perience of pain, identity and mortality, to
questions of gender and sexual identity and
behavior. As the camera moves from individ
uals to a larger view, the narration serves to
expand the film's reality, whether it be speak
ing of economic and political strife in Mexico,
the way Luisa feels at dinner parties or the
small gestures of dassism the friends enact.
Cuaron balances the tensions between indi
vidual experience and greater social forces
with great sensitivity, without either glorify
ing or degrading the individual.
The film's conclusion only heightens the
importance of such issues. While the ending
will no doubt strike some as abrupt and in
clusive, I believe this is the point. Cuaron's re
jection of a Hollywood tendency to reduce, to

wrap up all the loose, fragmented strings and
to resolve very simply and superficially prob
lems that, in the real world, have not been,
and perhaps cannot be, resolved, strikes me
as peculiarly Brechtian. "Y Tu Mama Tam
bien" does not allow the viewer to walk away
without giving some serious consideration,
and possibly even action, to real world prob
lems that are very, very serious.
This is not to give the impression that "Y
Tu Mama Tambien" is didactic, dry or un
relentingly depressing. It is a visual plea
sure, from its lineup of exquisite and ex
quisitely talented actors to its beautiful land
scapes of Mexico. It is emotionally very en
gaging, and, quite often, bitingly, wonder
fully funny. Oscar Wilde wrote, "It takes
courage to see the world in all its tainted
glory and still love it." Cuaron doesjust that,
and, what is more, gives his audience the gift
of being able to see it and to love it too.

Cuaron lacked none of the pleasures an
elephant experiences while squeezing it
self into tin can. Supine bodies lined the
stage like rows of rapt sardines, and aisles
were crowded with viewers standing
shoulder to shoulder, sometimes three
bodies deep. Nonetheless, the wild laugh
ter, reverential silences and the final ex
plosion of applause at the film's conclu
sion testified to the enormously powerful,
as well as enjoyable, impression the film
made on even the most inconvenienced
viewer. In other words, the cramped legs
and sore necks were worth it.
Cuaron, originally from Mexico but cur
rently living in New York, is not new to
filmmaking. "A Little Princess" and "Creat
Expectations," his most widely known
films, were attempts at the Hollywood stu
dio film and received mixed critical reac
tions. Though Cuaron said he identifies
himself as a lover of movies and not a mem
ber of any particular national or regional
cinema, that "Y Tu Mama Tambien" rep
resents his embrace of a distinctly non-Hol
