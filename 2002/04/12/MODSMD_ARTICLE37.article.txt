For Ashley Judd, the bad
luck all started with 1997's "Kiss
the Girls," in which her charac
ter is kidnapped, drugged and
imprisoned hy a sadistic serial
killer. In 1999's "Double Jeop
ardy," her character is beaten
savagely and stuffed alive into a
wooden coffin.

"High Crimes" proves yet again that nobody looks better
with a black eye than Ashley J udd. In this passably entertain
ing military courtroom thriller, J udd — who has become Hol
lywood's equivalent of a crash-test dummy — finds her on
screen bad-luck streak shows no signs of letting up.
In "High Crimes," Judd picks up right where she left off as
Claire Kubik, a hot shot San Francisco attorney, who happily
resides with husband Tom (Jim Caviezel) in a picturesque
Marin County cottage. One night when the Kubiks are out
Christmas shopping, the FBI arrests Tom, charging him with
the cold-blooded murder of nine innocent El Salvadorian vil
lagers back in his secret life as a Marine.
Tom is tossed into a military prison; the case is deemed one
of national security. Dissatisfied with the unproven counsel as
signed to Tom, Claire spearheads the defense. Claire finds she

is out of her element in the ethically flexible and intimidating
world of military justice, however, and decides to enlist the aid

of washed-up military attorney Charles Grimes,
played with fiendish gusto by Morgan Freeman. The
two quickly discover that military higher-ups do not
take kindly to cover-up allegations. Needless to say,
there are a couple of good beatings and a hospital stay
in store for Judd.
"Crimes" is buoyed by the performances of Judd
and Freeman. Judd is a rare gem, with enough

c harm and fire to enthrall an audience, even when her
roles look nearly identical. In another signature per
formance, she is independent, smart, brazen and ready
to stick the big lines right in the faces of unscrupulous
and powerful men.
Freeman, who teamed withjudd in "Kiss the Girls",
shines as his cool and endearing self. Though disguised
behind a wild streak, a drinking problem, a motorbike,
an entourage of prostitutes and a clip-on courtroom tie,
it's still good old Morgan — calm and dependable, out
witting the bad guys and loving every minute.
The rest of the cast serves a functional role. Amanda
I'eet makes an appearance as Claire's tlaky younger sis
ter and is a waste of a perfectly good actor's trailer. Peet's
irreverent character is painfully unnecessary and man
ages to detract from each of her scenes, consistently un

dermining the film's urgency and dramatic momentum.
Part "A Few Good Men," part "The General's Daughter,"
with just a touch of "Presumed Innocent," "High Crimes" is
a well-acted and sturdily made, if not altogether original, sus
pense thriller. Director Carl Franklin ("Devil in a Blue
Dress") is handy with his lurid flashbacks but has to work
with a storyline in which all the evidence doesn't quite add
up. At worst, though, the film is a trusty vehicle for the always
stellar Judd and Freeman. It's surprising just how far their
likeability can go.
