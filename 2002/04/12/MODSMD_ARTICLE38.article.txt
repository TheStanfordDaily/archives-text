# Nothing take about Pseudopod
## 
### ANTHONY HA 
Last year, Pseudopod won a "Best Col
lege Band" contest run by
rollingstone.com and iuma.com, and
used the prize money to record its second
album, "Rest Assured." Now it has signed
on with major label Interscope and will
release its third album this summer.
The band consists of singer / guitarist
Kevin Carlberg, guitarist Ross Grant,
bassist Brian Fox and drummer Tim
McGregor; saxophonist Matt Keegan
has returned to Australia. Pseudopod
plays the Coffee House on April 18.
Carlberg describes the band as
"mainstream rock meets the jam world,"
and that seems about right. Each catchy
song incorporates a wide array of inter
national musical styles, usually taking
time out for long (yet non-masturbato
ry) instrumental solos. The band's en-

thusiasm for riffing and jamming is infectious, and al
though the songs' lyrics are generally less than note
worthy, that seems almost besides the point.
I talked to Carlberg on the phone while the band was
driving to a gig in Laramie, Wyo. I have excised the
bursts of static that constantly interrupted us, leading
Carlberg to exclaim, "This sucks balls!" and "Wyoming
sucks!"
INTERMISSION: So you guys are in Wyoming?
KEVIN CARLBERG: Yeah, we're driving from Col
orado right now, into Laramie. We're going to be playing
some shows in the area for the next couple days. We're
going to have to haul ass from St. Louis so that we can get
back to California in a day and a half.
INTERMISSION: How did you guys get together?
CARLBERG: Tim and Ross have known each other
since like grade school. We all went to UCLA, so they
met Brian there, and they saw me singing in a bar in
Westwood. Matt came to Los Angeles as an exchange
student from Australia. We all got together and
jammed, and it went from there.
INTERMISSION: How long ago was that?
CARLBERG: That was, like, four years ago, three and
a half years ago.
INTERMISSION: How would you describe the band's
sound?
CARLBERG: [laughs] Ah, the famous question. I always
say that we're kind of a combination ofjazz and rock. Like
modern mainstream rock meets the jam world.
INTERMISSION: On your Web site, Brian describes the

rest of you guys as frat boys. Any truth to that?
CARLBERG: [to Brian] Did you say that we were on the
frat boys on the Web site?
BRIAN FOX: Uh...1 think I said something like that.
CARLBERG: Well, yeah, our first practice space was
the basement of a frat house in Los Angeles. The guys
in the frat were our first audience; we hung out with
them a lot. I guess you could say that we were frat dicks
fora little bit. Our first shows were at frat parties, so
our fans were originally the guys there, and it kind of
grew from there to encompass people from all over
UCLA, and so on. But we still have frat guys in the au
dience. The fans at our shows are like a mix of hippies,
with a few frat guys standing around in their Aber
crombie & Fitch.
INTERMISSION: How did you guys get signed with
Interscope?
CARLBERG: Well, we released two CDs before this.
After we came out with the first one, "Pod," we entered
this contest for "Best College Band" run by rolling
stone.com and iuma.com. It was this big Internet contest,
and the final four bands played at the Fillmore in San
Francisco. We ended up winning that and getting a
bunch of money, which we used to make our next CD,
"Rest Assured." It was just step by step from there. We
hired a manager, industry people started to come to our
shows and eventually we ended up with Interscope.
INTERMISSION: How are things different now that
you're working with a major label?.
CARLBERG: Well, they're putting a lot of money into
us. Our next album had a pretty big budget. We flew

down to Memphis and recorded it with producer Paul
Ebersold. It was a pretty different experience —we
recorded our last album in like two weeks, while we had
three months to do the new one.
INTERMISSION: So when's the new CD coming out?
What's it going to be called?
CARLBERG: It'll be out in July. It doesn't have a name
yet; we suck at coming up with names. Our first album
was called "Pod," which was an obvious, easy title, and
"Rest Assured" was named after one of the songs. So
who knows? It might be named after a song on the
album, or a line in a song, or just horse shit.
INTERMISSION: I read that your touring van explod
ed while driving over the Los Angeles Hills. True?
CARLBERG: [laughs] Yeah, that's true. That actually
happened to us twice. We were coming back from San
Francisco — in fact, I think that we were driving back
from Stanford. We were all dying to get home, so we
were going pretty fast, then our engine blew up at the
bottom at Grapevine. So we sat around for an hour,
wondering what we should do, if we should call our girl
friends and ask them to pick us up. We ended up wait
ing for three hours and playing Uno. We must have
looked pretty stupid. Eventually, the engine cooled
down, so we drove back at like five miles an hour.
INTERMISSION: Do you have any major plans for the
future, other than putting out more music and touring?
CARLBERG: Our major goal right now is to tour the
shit out of this country. We also want to get a single on
the radio. And we wanna eventually have a headlining
tour of our own, rather than just opening for other
bands. So those are some short-term goals.
INTERMISSION: How do you guys write your songs?
CARLBERG: We usually write them together. We
might all bring in bits and pieces; you know, me with
some lyrics or bits for the guitar, Brian with some bass,
Tim with something for the drums or keyboard and
Ross with some guitar. But it's a really collaborative
process. Even if someone brings in a full song that they
wrote entirely on their own, we always try to make it our
own — to give it a Pseudopod twist. There's a lot of
messing around and a really collective writing process.
INTERMISSION: Cool, that's all the questions that I
have. Is there anything else that you'd like to add?
CARLBERG: Yeah, we love Stanford. It's really fun
playing there; everyone grooves. At first, everyone's
kind of looking around, like, "What's going otr?" but
after a few minutes they have to clear the tables out of
the way so people can dance, [shouting] Oh yeah, and
I guess I should mention that Ross likes the freshmen
women. He's a dirty, dirty man. Nah, Ross is cool. I
say, "Bring in the freshmen women and we'll hook
them up with Ross."

yet; we suck at coming up with names. Our first album
was called "Pod," which was an obvious, easy title, and
"Rest Assured" was named after one of the songs. So
who knows? It might be named after a song on the
album, or a line in a song, or just horse shit.
INTERMISSION: I read that your touring van explod
ed while driving over the Los Angeles Hills. True?
CARLBERG: [laughs] Yeah, that's true. That actually
happened to us twice. We were coming back from San
Francisco — in fact, I think that we were driving back
from Stanford. We were all dying to get home, so we
were going pretty fast, then our engine blew up at the
bottom at Grapevine. So we sat around for an hour,
wondering what we should do, if we should call our girl
friends and ask them to pick us up. We ended up wait
ing for three hours and playing Uno. We must have
looked pretty stupid. Eventually, the engine cooled
down, so we drove back at like five miles an hour.
INTERMISSION: Do you have any major plans for the
future, other than putting out more music and touring?
CARLBERG: Our major goal right now is to tour the
shit out of this country. We also want to get a single on
the radio. And we wanna eventually have a headlining
tour of our own, rather than just opening for other
bands. So those are some short-term goals.
INTERMISSION: How do you guys write your songs?
CARLBERG: We usually write them together. We
might all bring in bits and pieces; you know, me with
some lyrics or bits for the guitar, Brian with some bass,
Tim with something for the drums or keyboard and
Ross with some guitar. But it's a really collaborative
process. Even if someone brings in a full song that they
wrote entirely on their own, we always try to make it our
own — to give it a Pseudopod twist. There's a lot of
messing around and a really collective writing process.
INTERMISSION: Cool, that's all the questions that I
have. Is there anything else that you'd like to add?
CARLBERG: Yeah, we love Stanford. It's really fun
playing there; everyone grooves. At first, everyone's
kind of looking around, like, "What's going otr?" but
after a few minutes they have to clear the tables out of
the way so people can dance, [shouting] Oh yeah, and
I guess I should mention that Ross likes the freshmen
women. He's a dirty, dirty man. Nah, Ross is cool. I
say, "Bring in the freshmen women and we'll hook
them up with Ross."


"Show me your riffs!"
Last year, Pseudopod won a "Best Col
lege Band" contest run by
rollingstone.com and iuma.com, and
used the prize money to record its second
album, "Rest Assured." Now it has signed
on with major label Interscope and will
release its third album this summer.
The band consists of singer / guitarist
Kevin Carlberg, guitarist Ross Grant,
bassist Brian Fox and drummer Tim
McGregor; saxophonist Matt Keegan
has returned to Australia. Pseudopod
plays the Coffee House on April 18.
Carlberg describes the band as
"mainstream rock meets the jam world,"
and that seems about right. Each catchy
song incorporates a wide array of inter
national musical styles, usually taking
time out for long (yet non-masturbato
ry) instrumental solos. The band's en-

thusiasm for riffing and jamming is infectious, and al
though the songs' lyrics are generally less than note
worthy, that seems almost besides the point.
I talked to Carlberg on the phone while the band was
driving to a gig in Laramie, Wyo. I have excised the
bursts of static that constantly interrupted us, leading
Carlberg to exclaim, "This sucks balls!" and "Wyoming
sucks!"
INTERMISSION: So you guys are in Wyoming?
KEVIN CARLBERG: Yeah, we're driving from Col
orado right now, into Laramie. We're going to be playing
some shows in the area for the next couple days. We're
going to have to haul ass from St. Louis so that we can get
back to California in a day and a half.
INTERMISSION: How did you guys get together?
CARLBERG: Tim and Ross have known each other
since like grade school. We all went to UCLA, so they
met Brian there, and they saw me singing in a bar in
Westwood. Matt came to Los Angeles as an exchange
student from Australia. We all got together and
jammed, and it went from there.
INTERMISSION: How long ago was that?
CARLBERG: That was, like, four years ago, three and
a half years ago.
INTERMISSION: How would you describe the band's
sound?
CARLBERG: [laughs] Ah, the famous question. I always
say that we're kind of a combination ofjazz and rock. Like
modern mainstream rock meets the jam world.
INTERMISSION: On your Web site, Brian describes the

rest of you guys as frat boys. Any truth to that?
CARLBERG: [to Brian] Did you say that we were on the
frat boys on the Web site?
BRIAN FOX: Uh...1 think I said something like that.
CARLBERG: Well, yeah, our first practice space was
the basement of a frat house in Los Angeles. The guys
in the frat were our first audience; we hung out with
them a lot. I guess you could say that we were frat dicks
fora little bit. Our first shows were at frat parties, so
our fans were originally the guys there, and it kind of
grew from there to encompass people from all over
UCLA, and so on. But we still have frat guys in the au
dience. The fans at our shows are like a mix of hippies,
with a few frat guys standing around in their Aber
crombie & Fitch.
INTERMISSION: How did you guys get signed with
Interscope?
CARLBERG: Well, we released two CDs before this.
After we came out with the first one, "Pod," we entered
this contest for "Best College Band" run by rolling
stone.com and iuma.com. It was this big Internet contest,
and the final four bands played at the Fillmore in San
Francisco. We ended up winning that and getting a
bunch of money, which we used to make our next CD,
"Rest Assured." It was just step by step from there. We
hired a manager, industry people started to come to our
shows and eventually we ended up with Interscope.
INTERMISSION: How are things different now that
you're working with a major label?.
CARLBERG: Well, they're putting a lot of money into
us. Our next album had a pretty big budget. We flew

down to Memphis and recorded it with producer Paul
Ebersold. It was a pretty different experience —we
recorded our last album in like two weeks, while we had
three months to do the new one.
INTERMISSION: So when's the new CD coming out?
What's it going to be called?
CARLBERG: It'll be out in July. It doesn't have a name
yet; we suck at coming up with names. Our first album
