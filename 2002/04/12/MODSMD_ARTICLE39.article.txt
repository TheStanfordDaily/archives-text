# Buffalo Daughter returns to the stage

Once again, the
Japanese band Buf
falo Daughter has
released an album
that both breaks
ground artistically
and appeals to the
best of pop sensibili
ties. On their newest

album, "I", the band manages to avoid cate
gorization as it seamlessly mixes analog syn
thesizers, beautiful and sweet female vocals,
sparse flourishes of turntables and hypnotiz
ing guitar riffs. As with its previous releases,
"I" is made to be experienced in its entirety
in a single sitting. The tracks flow and float

together, like a pleasant sailboat trip, leaving
the listener feeling happy and refreshed by

the end of the album's 50 min
utes. Though less experimen
tal and a bit softer than previ
ous Buffalo Daughter records,
"I" still breaks quite a bit of
ground with its unique instru
mentation (bass guitar, moog
synthesizer, theremin) and un
usual song structures.

In the four years since the release of its
last album, "New Rock," Buffalo Daughter
has notoriously stayed out of the musical
spotlight in America. In 1998, Buffalo
Daughter was all over the American and in
ternational indie music scene, performing
at the Tibetan Freedom Concerts, doing

remixes for the likes of Underworld, Cor
nelius, and Air as well as embarking on a
transcontinental U.S. tour with Beastie Boys
keyboardist Money Mark.
After releasing an EP collection of remixes
from "New Rock," the trio of suGar Yoshina
ga, Yumiko Ohno and Moog Yamamoto
went on hiatus, pursuing their interests inde
pendently. suGar formed an all-girl punk
group in Japan, Yumiko had a child and ap
peared on Cibo Matto's amazing album
"Stereotype A" and Moog produced CD
packaging for bands in Japan through his de
sign company, Phonic.
"I,"was recorded in 2001, but became de
layed as the band's American label, Grand
Royal, dropped its artists and declared bank
ruptcy. Oh, Grand Royal, how far you have

fallen! You were once home to Ben Lee, Atari
Teenage Riot, Sean Lennon, Luscious Jack
son, Bis and Buffalo Daughter. Now you've
found yourself penniless with Bran Van 3000
and At the Drive-In!
Buffalo Daughter has since signed to Em
peror Norton Records, a new label that is
home to many synth and experimental artists
and after a considerable wait, its latest full
length is finally available.
The songs "Volcano Girl" and "Ivory"
stand out as the album's best as they feature
lyrics by suGar and Yumiko singing alternat
ing harmonies over catchy guitar melodies.
As with every Buffalo Daughter album,
there is an epic track ("Mirror Ball") that
