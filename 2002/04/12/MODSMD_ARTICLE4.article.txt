# Meet candidates Perry and Steinberg

### JOHN HUETTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Vowing to return the ASSU
Presidential Election to its "pris
tine form," juniors Adrian Perry
and Matt Steinberg entered the
2002 race.
"We believe that the ASSU Pres
idential Election should stay true
to its roots: the good, clean, popu
larity contest," the duo said.

"When
Adrian
first ap
proached
me about
running
for ASSU

President, I thought it was another
one of his practical jokes, like the
time he ran over my. dog," Stein
berg said, but he said Perry had
the kind of "gleam in his eye" over

the election that he does before he
throws a touchdown pass or grabs
his girlfriend's thigh.
Thus, he ran with Perry. "Adri
an was the most popular boy in
school," Steinberg said, "Who was
I to say no as the school bully?"
In addition, Steinberg said, Dean
Moogle was going to kick him out of
school for "smokin' in the boys'
room" unless he did community
service. "I don't care about your
rules," he said to Dean Moogle. "I'm
gonna run for class president and
change your rules, Babylon."
Perry said he ran because that is
what popular kids do, along with
dating cheerleaders like his girl
friend Suzy Popular. He said they
met after he threw a touchdown
pass to win a football game for Lin
coln High in 1985.
"Throw the goddamn TD pass,
baby," Perry said, and called it his
election strategy.
The duo did acknowledge that
campus elections have issues other
than popularity. They also pledged
a commitment to increasing ASSU
accountability to students.
"If we mess up," Steinberg said,
"we promise to wear hats tfiat say
"Bad Idiot" in very big letters, with
terrible graphic design and no

surfer logos at all. We really do not
want to wear these hats. So we won't
screw up."
They will also put up a web
camera in the ASSU office that will
run nonstop and televise them as
sort of an "ASSU Odd Couple."
The two are so different, Steinberg
said, yet they get along so well.
They expect student interest to
be higher for this venture than for
other ASSU outreach projects be
cause they "are popular."
Forcing administrators to re
spond more to student concerns,
shaping up to be a key issue in the
election, was also addressed by
the pair.
"We will beat up Dean Moogle
until he gives everyone a living
wage," Steinberg said. "I made
Ricky Four-Eyes give me his living
wage every day last year. I used it to
buy cigarettes and dog food for
Champ."
Perry broke away from the inter
view to throw a touchdown, win the

game against Lincoln High, and set
a new school record for touchdown
passing on any given Sunday.
"Triple bling!" exclaimed Perry
upon his return, making up a catch
plirase in the "manner of popular
kids." The two plan to release a set
of such phrases, presumably in the
ASSU Newsletter, as well as a more
general list of what's popular and
what's not â€” "causing much riot
ing and many tears."
"Triple bling, dogg," Perry
said. "Triple bling."
They said their leadership expe
rience was developed at Space
Camp. They said they broke orders
from Dean Moogle to launch a
shuttle when conditions were
cloudy, costing hundreds of dollars
in damage. However, due to their
action, a simulated baby in a simu
lated air shaft was saved, and the
two won Space Camper of the
Year.
"We loved Space Camp, and
Space Camp loved us," Steinberg
said.
Perry, guaranteed to win any
popularity contest, he said, attempt
ed to call the election off. "Why is it
even happening?" he said.

The election will still occur on
Tuesday and Wednesday.
Approachability is a major con
cern of the duo.
"You can find [Perry] throwing
touchdown passes or in the back of
his three-wheeled Bronco with
[girlfriend] Suzy Popular," Stein
berg said. The odd, tricyclic Bron
co, the two revealed, epitomized
the type of financial savvy neces
sary in the ASSU.
"It was either one wheel or no
woofers," Perry said, "and no
snake cage in the back."
"Chicks dig snakes," Perry con
tinued, nodding and smirking
knowingly.
"I can be found leaning against
Dean Moogle's car looking mean,
leaning against numerous hand
rails with an unconcerned look,
and carving my name into various
pieces of school property and
memorabilia," Steinberg added.
"If something gets on our desk
to do, it'll be in the 'done box' be
fore you can say, 'Is it done?'"
Steinberg said. "Well, it is, and our
'done box,' is full."
"Hey, is your name Press Pass?"
Steinberg said. "Blow me."
