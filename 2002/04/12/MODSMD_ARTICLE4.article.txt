### JOHN HUETTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Vowing to return the ASSU
Presidential Election to its "pris
tine form," juniors Adrian Perry
and Matt Steinberg entered the
2002 race.
"We believe that the ASSU Pres
idential Election should stay true
to its roots: the good, clean, popu
larity contest," the duo said.

"When
Adrian
first ap
proached
me about
running
for ASSU

President, I thought it was another
one of his practical jokes, like the
time he ran over my. dog," Stein
berg said, but he said Perry had
the kind of "gleam in his eye" over

the election that he does before he
throws a touchdown pass or grabs
his girlfriend's thigh.
Thus, he ran with Perry. "Adri
an was the most popular boy in
school," Steinberg said, "Who was
I to say no as the school bully?"
In addition, Steinberg said, Dean
Moogle was going to kick him out of
school for "smokin' in the boys'
room" unless he did community
service. "I don't care about your
rules," he said to Dean Moogle. "I'm
gonna run for class president and
change your rules, Babylon."
Perry said he ran because that is
what popular kids do, along with
dating cheerleaders like his girl
friend Suzy Popular. He said they
met after he threw a touchdown
pass to win a football game for Lin
coln High in 1985.
"Throw the goddamn TD pass,
baby," Perry said, and called it his
election strategy.
The duo did acknowledge that
campus elections have issues other
than popularity. They also pledged
a commitment to increasing ASSU
accountability to students.
"If we mess up," Steinberg said,
"we promise to wear hats tfiat say
"Bad Idiot" in very big letters, with
terrible graphic design and no
