# ACT's 'Glass Menagerie' sparkles
## 
### RAPHAEL GINSBURG 
In the theater, as in all the
arts, there is a great risk in going
to see the performance of a mas
terpiece. Nobody wants to see
their favorite play butchered,
and the better one knows a
work, the more sensitive one is to

all the elements that could go awry.
But, of course, there is also the pos
sibility of a great reward, and this is
why everyone turns out for the
masterpieces; a well-done produc
tion brings out all the subtle intrica
cies that make a play great and
shows theater at its best. Such was
the case with the American Conser
vatory Theater's production of
"fhe Glass Menagerie," Tennessee
Williams' first successful and per
haps best-loved work.
"The Glass Menagerie" is
Williams' semi-autobiographical
tale of a disintegrating Southern
family. Amanda, the mother, is a
Southern belle trapped in the
memory of her glorious youth and
occupied with worries over the fu
ture of her children. Her daugh
ter, Laura, slightly crippled by a
bad ankle, is so shy and frail that
she spends all her days playing
records and taking care of her col
lection of glass animals, which pro
vide a central symbol, as well as the
title, for the play. Laura's brother,
Tom, who also serves as narrator
for the play, is the most grounded
member of the family and desper
ately wants to escape his dull life at
a shoe warehouse, but is torn by
feelings of obligation towards his
mother and sister. The simplistic
plot revolves around Amanda try
ing to get a gentleman caller to
come see Laura; when Jim, a
friend of Tom's, finally comes to
dinner, he briefly gives both Laura
and Amanda great hope before
crushing them by revealing to
them that he is engaged.

ry. 1 ' The set is deconstructed, with
different objects hanging from the
ceiling and translucent curtains
representing walls. Williamson,
with the help of lighting designer
Peter Maradurin, makes the most
of soft lighting and shadows to cre
ate a poetic atmosphere, which
brings out the frail and romantic
nature of the play. They often use
light to draw the viewer's attention
to certain aspects of the stage (es
pecially to individual characters)
or to highlight the isolation of
those characters.
Williamson also achieves this ef
fect by often having the actors face
the audience, rather than each
other, though they give the im
pression of not speaking to the au
dience but to themselves. Though
he decides not to use Williams' im
ages and phrases projected onto a
screen, he creates a similar effect by
having an actor representing the
ideal gentleman caller wander the
stage during key scenes. In all, he
creates a world where Williams'
nonrealistic, sentimental work can
thrive and where the actors can
bring their characters to life.
And this the actors do with
great success. Robin Moseley par
ticularly flourishes in the role of
Amanda. She makes the most of
Amanda's fussy, obsessive nature
and brings out a comic side of the
play that is often neglected fora
more melodramatic, sentimental
reading. But at the same time, her
portrayal is complex enough to
highlight what is so tragic about

Amanda's situation. When she
fusses over Tom, there is a hint of
desperation that transcends the
comedy of the moment to show
how truly worried Amanda is that
her son will turn into an alcoholic,
like her husband.
Moseley also shows a virtuoistic
ability to switch on a dime between
comedy and melodrama; she goes
from shrieking to being on the verge
of tears in seconds. And in this, the
very nature of Amanda is summa
rized; she is funny until one realizes
just how tragic she is. Moseley and
the rest of the company sometimes
were on the wrong side of the fine
line between comedy and melodra
ma, but the intimate, poetic feel that
they create so well more than makes
up for this problem. When Moseley
does not portray Amanda comically,
the truly desperate Amanda who re
alizes her own tragedy comes out, as
when she demands, "What will be
come of us?"
Joey Collins is also excellent
both as the narrafor and as Tom.
He delivers his lines excellently
and understands the importance
of his role as Williams' voice. Like
Moseley, he is able to switch from a
humorous mood to a serious one
easily, and thus create a deeply
complex character.
Particularly memorable is Heidi
Armbruster as Laura. It is due in
large part to her sensitive acting
and her powerful final scene (with
Neil Hopkins as Jim, her gentle
man caller) that the play remains
grounded in the nuanced, poetic
world that is the stuff of Williams'
plays. She is extremely successful in
bringing out Laura's childish,
dreamy nature, often speaking up
toward no one in particular or to
herself. She also wonderfully por
trays Laura's frail, hysterical nature
— without going overboard —
through simple actions like shaking
her head before speaking. She de-

livers her lines
well, knowing the
full meaning and
implication of
every word, able to
display a wide
range of emotions
while still main
taining her frail,
childlike nature;
this allowed her to
create a complex
character out of
such a simplistic
part and yet to ful
fill her larger role
as a symbol at the
same time.
Armbruster, a
third-year ACT
Master of Fine
Arts student spoke
about her feelings
about making the
leap to the main
stage and about
the production in
general. She has
done several shows
at the ACT before,

though she said, "this feels in some
ways like the beginning of a body
of professional work."
Although she worried about tak
ing on this celebrated role and per
forming in such a demanding
space, she showed a confidence that
came through in her performance;
of the problems of creating such a
complex and famous character. "I
have tried to really approach this
role from myself," she said. "In
order to feel confident and come
up with something truthful and
rich, I will naturally do better work
if I take what I have to the stage,
which is myself." This holistic, nat
ural approach to the role also influ
enced Armbruster's decision not to
create a Laura based on Williams'
real-life sister, Rose. "This feels like
a magical portrayal of his sister, so

in some ways it feels like it is not
very useful to go back and look at
his sister," she said.
" There is no way that I can play
the definitive Laura in The Glass
Menagerie,' but there is a way I can
play my definitive Laura for where
I am now," she said, responding to
the difficulties of playing such a
renowned role.
And this, perhaps, could be said
of the entire production. With such
a masterpiece, one can never ex
pect to find the perfect version, nor
would one want to; seeing great
works being reinvented and rede
fined time and again is what makes
them so exciting. The ACTs pro
duction was not free from faults,
but it still was able to create some
thing amazingly powerful,
poignant and true on stage. And
that is better than perfection.

different objects hanging from the
ceiling and translucent curtains
representing walls. Williamson,
with the help of lighting designer
Peter Maradurin, makes the most
of soft lighting and shadows to cre
ate a poetic atmosphere, which
brings out the frail and romantic
nature of the play. They often use
light to draw the viewer's attention
to certain aspects of the stage (es
pecially to individual characters)
or to highlight the isolation of
those characters.
Williamson also achieves this ef
fect by often having the actors face
the audience, rather than each
other, though they give the im
pression of not speaking to the au
dience but to themselves. Though
he decides not to use Williams' im
ages and phrases projected onto a
screen, he creates a similar effect by
having an actor representing the
ideal gentleman caller wander the
stage during key scenes. In all, he
creates a world where Williams'
nonrealistic, sentimental work can
thrive and where the actors can
bring their characters to life.
And this the actors do with
great success. Robin Moseley par
ticularly flourishes in the role of
Amanda. She makes the most of
Amanda's fussy, obsessive nature
and brings out a comic side of the
play that is often neglected fora
more melodramatic, sentimental
reading. But at the same time, her
portrayal is complex enough to
highlight what is so tragic about

Amanda's situation. When she
fusses over Tom, there is a hint of
desperation that transcends the
comedy of the moment to show
how truly worried Amanda is that
her son will turn into an alcoholic,
like her husband.
Moseley also shows a virtuoistic
ability to switch on a dime between
comedy and melodrama; she goes
from shrieking to being on the verge
of tears in seconds. And in this, the
very nature of Amanda is summa
rized; she is funny until one realizes
just how tragic she is. Moseley and
the rest of the company sometimes
were on the wrong side of the fine
line between comedy and melodra
ma, but the intimate, poetic feel that
they create so well more than makes
up for this problem. When Moseley
does not portray Amanda comically,
the truly desperate Amanda who re
alizes her own tragedy comes out, as
when she demands, "What will be
come of us?"
Joey Collins is also excellent
both as the narrafor and as Tom.
He delivers his lines excellently
and understands the importance
of his role as Williams' voice. Like
Moseley, he is able to switch from a
humorous mood to a serious one
easily, and thus create a deeply
complex character.
Particularly memorable is Heidi
Armbruster as Laura. It is due in
large part to her sensitive acting
and her powerful final scene (with
Neil Hopkins as Jim, her gentle
man caller) that the play remains
grounded in the nuanced, poetic
world that is the stuff of Williams'
plays. She is extremely successful in
bringing out Laura's childish,
dreamy nature, often speaking up
toward no one in particular or to
herself. She also wonderfully por
trays Laura's frail, hysterical nature
— without going overboard —
through simple actions like shaking
her head before speaking. She de-

livers her lines
well, knowing the
full meaning and
implication of
every word, able to
display a wide
range of emotions
while still main
taining her frail,
childlike nature;
this allowed her to
create a complex
character out of
such a simplistic
part and yet to ful
fill her larger role
as a symbol at the
same time.
Armbruster, a
third-year ACT
Master of Fine
Arts student spoke
about her feelings
about making the
leap to the main
stage and about
the production in
general. She has
done several shows
at the ACT before,

though she said, "this feels in some
ways like the beginning of a body
of professional work."
Although she worried about tak
ing on this celebrated role and per
forming in such a demanding
space, she showed a confidence that
came through in her performance;
of the problems of creating such a
complex and famous character. "I
have tried to really approach this
role from myself," she said. "In
order to feel confident and come
up with something truthful and
rich, I will naturally do better work
if I take what I have to the stage,
which is myself." This holistic, nat
ural approach to the role also influ
enced Armbruster's decision not to
create a Laura based on Williams'
real-life sister, Rose. "This feels like
a magical portrayal of his sister, so

in some ways it feels like it is not
very useful to go back and look at
his sister," she said.
" There is no way that I can play
the definitive Laura in The Glass
Menagerie,' but there is a way I can
play my definitive Laura for where
I am now," she said, responding to
the difficulties of playing such a
renowned role.
And this, perhaps, could be said
of the entire production. With such
a masterpiece, one can never ex
pect to find the perfect version, nor
would one want to; seeing great
works being reinvented and rede
fined time and again is what makes
them so exciting. The ACTs pro
duction was not free from faults,
but it still was able to create some
thing amazingly powerful,
poignant and true on stage. And
that is better than perfection.


Back in fhe days before fhe horseless carriage.
In the theater, as in all the
arts, there is a great risk in going
to see the performance of a mas
terpiece. Nobody wants to see
their favorite play butchered,
and the better one knows a
work, the more sensitive one is to

all the elements that could go awry.
But, of course, there is also the pos
sibility of a great reward, and this is
why everyone turns out for the
masterpieces; a well-done produc
tion brings out all the subtle intrica
cies that make a play great and
shows theater at its best. Such was
the case with the American Conser
vatory Theater's production of
"fhe Glass Menagerie," Tennessee
Williams' first successful and per
haps best-loved work.
"The Glass Menagerie" is
Williams' semi-autobiographical
tale of a disintegrating Southern
family. Amanda, the mother, is a
Southern belle trapped in the
memory of her glorious youth and
occupied with worries over the fu
ture of her children. Her daugh
ter, Laura, slightly crippled by a
bad ankle, is so shy and frail that
she spends all her days playing
records and taking care of her col
lection of glass animals, which pro
vide a central symbol, as well as the
title, for the play. Laura's brother,
Tom, who also serves as narrator
for the play, is the most grounded
member of the family and desper
ately wants to escape his dull life at
a shoe warehouse, but is torn by
feelings of obligation towards his
mother and sister. The simplistic
plot revolves around Amanda try
