On April 23, The

rockers. It's only cool to be a pop band if you're not supposed
to be one. Reporters will ask the Milwaukee quartet idiotic
questions about being labeled, and they will respond, of

course, that their music eludes labeling.
The recent unnecessary focus on the
Promise Ring's genre rather than music
is prompted by the band's decision to
leave Jade Tree Records and join Epi
taph's Anti label for the production of
their latest album. Tired of being brand
ed as an "eino" (a subgenre of hardcore
punk music that often deals with emo
tional issues such as romantic angst and
social alienation) and by critics and fans,
the band felt the move was necessary in
order to grow musically.
The members of the Promise Ring
have created "Wood / Water," which
features 12 tracks unlike anything their
fans have heard before. The band de
scribes its new release as the "older

cousin" to its second, critically acclaimed full-length, "Noth
ing Feels Good." The music is mellower, relying less on emo
style heart-tearing vocals and more upon guitar hooks and
layered sounds.
Recorded in England with producer Stephen Street ( The
Smiths, Blur, The Cranberries), "Wood / Water" is packed
with diversity. Although the album is definitely mellower, they
have managed to maintain a distinct sound on each song.
The Promise Ring sometimes experiments with vocal effects

such as on the opening track, "Size of Your Life," and other
times offers very simple, stripped-down acoustic guitar as the
backbone to its songs, such as on "Letters to the Far Reaches"
and "Say Goodbye Good."
With the endearing lispy quality of Isaac Brock, vocalist
Davey von Bohlen delivers single lines of lyric repeatedly as re
frains: "I'm just happy you stuck around," ("Become One
Anything One Time") or even as simple as "Hey, hey, hey,"
which runs throughout "Say Goodbye Good." You can picture
the lighters swaying back and forth on this one. The simplicity
of the "hey" 's, as well as the "yeah, yeah, oh yeah, yeah, oh
yeah" 's of the second track, "Stop Playing Guitar," work well
for this refreshingly interesting and unpretentious album.

With the recent
success of other
"emo" bands such as
Jimmy Lat World,
many are hoping the
Promise King will
now have its chance in
the spotlight, but the
band itself expresses
doubts about the like
lihood its faces will
plaster MTV in the
immediate future. If
the driven emo sound
takes over MTV, The
Promise Ring will not
be a part of this revo
lution. The mellow-

ness of "Wood / Water," in part created in order to escape the
constraints of the emo music label, ironically contributes to cre
ating a less accessible sound. This is not to say it isn't damn
good â€” just that the band is more likely to be compared with
the likes of Pedro the Lion than Weezer, because, hey, we all
know that music journalists love labels and comparisons.

Note: The Promise Ring will play a pair of dates at Slim's in San
Francisco on May 6 and May 7.


So, guys, how does it feel to be the biggest emo band in America?
