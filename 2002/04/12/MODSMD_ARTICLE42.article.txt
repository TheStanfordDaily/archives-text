# Second verse, same as the first

This is the fourth in a series of articles called "The Record Bin " ex
ploring classic albums from the past: pop music for people who love
pop music.

Some say that the Ramones was one of
the ugliest bands in musical history. Its
members definitely looked odd, with their
pudding-bowl haircuts, hoodlum wear and
gangly bodies. None of them really knew
how to play their instruments; their man-

ager had to play the drums because no one else wanted to.
There is a story that once when they went on tour, people
thought that they were a van of retarded men being cared
for by their manager.
But none of this mattered. Not a single bit. The Ra
mones' self-titled first album is a raw, bashy-bashy, tune
ful masterpiece.
When the Ramones first came onto the scene, popular
music was largely populated by rock monoliths who had
big, backlit hair and played never-ending masturbatory
guitar solos in gigantic stadiums. The music was fine, and
many enjoyed it. But some musicians, who were just kids
with cheap guitars, were alienated by this music, which
was exclv : ~nary to those who had neither the technical
proficient/ nor the wealth to ape it. Also, many rock fans
felt this music just. . . sucked. It was rock 'n' roll without
the fun and wildness and excitement.
The rest of the history lesson: the Ramones made their
first record, and rocked the house. Rock music was

changed forever.
The first song on the Ramones is clangy, quick and au
daciously poppy. "Blitzkrieg Bop" is a punk manifesto,

with Joey Ramone proclaiming,
"Hey ho, let's go!" The record
blasts through 13 more songs in a
lean 28 minutes and 52 seconds.
There is no time wasted here. The
Ramones crash through the songs
like they have somewhere else to
be, but hell, this is fun too.
This album seems so simple that

it's dumb. The song lyrics are rudimentary, the most ex
treme example being those of "Now I Wanna Sniff Some
Glue": "Now I wanna sniff some glue / Now 1 wanna have
something to do / All the kids wanna sniff some glue / All
the kids want something to do." Looking for more? That's
it. Plus, there is Joey's head-cold voice, an ungodly, di
alectically confused cross between Queens, N.Y., and
London, England. Bassist Dee Dee and guitarist Johnny
furiously, frantically play their instruments with no tech
nical skill at all, and Tommy beats the hell out of the
drums, as only a manager who plays the drums because
no one else will, can.
But "Ramones" is not dumb. It's so raw and clean that
it attains a sort of pop purity. Although it is thought of as
the premier punk record, but it is also an amazing pop
album. There are elements of surf-rock, girl group music
and Brit rock. In the song "I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend,"
the Ramones, those dirty punk guys, could coo and har
monize like the Ronettes. They combined lyrics about

their lumpen lives with music so intense that it main
tained itself for only a few minutes before moving onto
the next song.
I love "Ramones" enough to say that it is a beautiful
album. This is bubble-gum pop gone horribly wrong.
This is four guys having fun wasting time in the gutter.
And it still kicks my ass every time I hear it, which is what
all great music should do.


Adios, amigos.
