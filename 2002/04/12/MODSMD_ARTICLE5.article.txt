### MICHELLE KELLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last night, leading feminist, author
and political activist Gloria Steinem de
livered a poignant and humorous per
formance to a packed, predominantly fe
male audience at Kresge Hall in a discus
sion called, "Everything you've ever
wanted to know about feminism but
were afraid to ask."
Steinem was invited to speak at Stan
ford through a partnership of the ASSU
Speaker's Bureau and the Women's
Community Center's "Herstory" pro
gram. Bill Falsey, the director of the bu
reau, introduced Steinem as "the spokes
woman on issues of equality . . . one of
the most influential women in America."
Using tunny anecdotes and personal
stories, Steinem quickly put her audience
at ease and debunked many of the stereo
types and myths associated with feminism.
"The word itself— feminism — has
been distorted," she said.
Steinem specifically disputed the no
tion that all feminists are lesbians, stating
that the women's revolution had long
been associated and connected to the les
bian and gay movement.
"These movements have come togeth
er fora reason — women, whatever our
sexuality — must separate sexuality from
reproduction. It is about controlling our
own lives," she said. "The gay and lesbian
movements also stand for die separation
of reproduction and sexuality."
She also spoke about the commonly
held misconception that "feminism is just
a luxury of the white wealthy women." .Al

luding to Ralph Ellison's book, "Invisible
Man," Steinem talked about the invisible
women in America: the women of color,
the working-class women, all who were
working just as hard, if not harder, to
push the women's movement.
"Poor women are more likely to be fight
ing for these issues because they experience
more discrimination and inequality."
Steinem took a moment in her discus
sion of feminism to address the events of
Sept. 11 and the changes that had to be
made in our societies to stop the violence.
"Who were the terrorists?" she said.
"Who are the serial killers? They are all

powerful, rich or middle-class
males... who have been raised with
their masculinity to prove. They are told
that they have the natural right to con
trol other people."
"The truth is that the gender roles, the
cult of masculinity . . . are the deepest
causes of violence in the world today."
After her speech, Steinem answered
many questions from her audience,
ranging from transgender issues to the
effectiveness of single-sex education.
