# Brewer, Cordero reflect on ASSU term
## 
### YASI HASHEMI EDITORIAL STAFF 
Editor's note: The Daily sat down with the cur
rent ASSU president, junior Matt Brewer, and
vice-president, senior Christine Cordero, to talk
about their year in office.
Daily: What are yonr fondest memo
ries of working as ASSU president and
vice president?
Brewer: One of our biggest accom
plishments this year has been our abil
ity to bring individuals together across
different communities and from all
walks of campus life. One of the things
that embodies this is the photo wall in

our office. Every project we've
done . . . we've brought in lots of dif
ferent individuals who represent lots
of different experiences.
"[This has] allowed the ASSU to move
closer to fulfilling its vision of harboring
a vision for every student. In the
process, we have suffered from sleepless
nights and academic martyrdom, but
they pale in comparison with the gratifi
cation of fun, growth and relationships
we have experienced
Cordero: That would be probably the of
fice hours and dinners we had .. just
meeting people has been really great.
And those early moments of planning
when everything is exciting.

Daily: What have been the biggest chal
lenges you've faced?
Brewer: The hardest part of the job is
time. As soon as you learn how to do the
job, how things work in the University,
and how to best approach issues, you're
wrapping up the year. And because of
this, it's really important to take advan
tage of what's already been done and to
build new relationships, strengthen old
relationships and to build new infrastruc
tures and institutionalize mechanisms all
that ultimately leave the association in a
more beneficial condition.
Cordero: A lot of the politicking, the
meetings. 1 thought we'd be able
to do a lot more with students,
and it turned out that we spent a
lot of time in meetings with the
administration.
Daily: How, if at all, were your ex
pectations of the job different from
the job itself?
Brewer: When you think about
running, and you go through the
whole process, you become the
walking manifestation of whatev
er vision or platform you and
your co-candidate
represent. . . When Sept. 11 oc
curred, we couldn't have expect
ed it. It was one example of how
we worked with different stu
dents. Over the summer, there
were a lot of announcements
about changes in health care —
something we had to work with
the Graduate Student Council on.
There were a lot of things that we
couldn't anticipate — things you
couldn't bet on or plan for. Part of
the job is to learn as you do.
Cordero: I thought we'd be work
ing on the ground a lot more.
What we ended up doing, which I
suppose is what the ASSU is sup
posed to do, was a lot more facili
tating for what students want to
get clone... I thought we'd be
able to get into the middle of
things a lot more.
Daily: How do you feel about the
goals you set out at the start of your
campaign and term?
Brewer: All of our focus areas re
volved around the notion that we
would seek to represent a vision
for every student. The specific
areas we focused on were the arts,
diversity, transportation, internal
ASSU improvements and student
group empowerment.
When you look at our report
card, you'll see that with the arts
we were able to launch the Mural

Aits program in conjunction with
SOCA [ The Student Organizing
Committee for the Arts]. With di
versity, we've worked with Sonrisa
Lucero and many other con
cerned students to launch a faculty
diversity task force and research
some of the deeper disparities that
affect all students as they relate to
diverse communities.
One of our larger goals was to
bridge the gap between Sum ford
and the larger community, and the
News Readership Program creates
the opportunity to create a more
informed student community uni
fied behind awareness.
We've also made tons of internal
reform ... Alex Shvartsman has
done a phenomenal job to lead
probably the most productive Sen
ate ever. Filipe Santos has worked
relentlessly with the GSC to further
the ultimate position of graduate
student voice and condition.
Cordero: I'm probably the harsh
est critic. I feel like we accom
plished a lot of the goals we set out
for ourselves — because the goals
we set for ourselves were realistic. I
think we've continued in trying to
balance advocacy and life .. . We
actually did get a lot done.
Daily: What will you miss the most?
Brewer: The relationships we've
formed have been essential to

everything we've accomplished.
Our strong bonds with communi
ties of color have allowed us to
make significant process with di
versity initiatives. Our strong
bonds with [Housing and] Dining
Services allowed us to successfully
execute Thanksgiving Dinner
and the News Readership Pro
gram. Our strong relationship
with SOCA has allowed the Mural
Aits Project to blossom and our
strong connection with the entire
student body has allowed us to
represent a vision for every stu
dent in a way that the ASSU has
not always been able to do.
Cordero: Working with students in
that capacity, and specifically the
internal ASSU people that were re
ally cool.
Daily: Any words of advice to future
presidents and vice presidents?
Brewer: No pocket of campus life
can be ignored or avoided, and
personal interests must be placed
aside for the larger interests of the
entire student body.
Be sure to get to know the ASSU of
fice staff, for they will be your best
friends and strongest allies.
Also, you may find it strategic to
set up an alarm clock in the ASSU
office.
Cordero: Take it all in stride, bits
and pieces.
