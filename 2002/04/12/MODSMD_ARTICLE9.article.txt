### CYNTHIA CHO EDITORIAL STAFF 
For the second year in a row, Kids With Dreams will
hold its Very Special Arts Festival on Saturday. From
11 a.m. to 3 p.m., there will be an art gallery, musical
and dance performances, and arts and crafts work
shops in White Plaza.
"One goal of the festival is to celebrate the achieve
ment of those with disabilities through the arts," said
senior Cathy Lui, the group's president.
"We also want to show the creative potential of
those with disabilities and demonstrate the impor
tance of the arts in enabling learning achievements
among students with special needs," she continued.
The festival will begin with a speech by keynote
speaker actress Andrew Fay Friedman, who has ap
peared on shows such as "Life Goes On" and "Law &
Order."She will talk about her road to Hollywood, so
cial perceptions about disabilities and her work as a
disabled actress with Down's Syndrome.
More than 50 pieces of artwork by professional
artists with disabilities and disabled children from Kids
With Dreams programs will be on display.
The festival will include a wheelchair dance perfor
mance by AXIX Dance Group and a musical perfor
mance by The Dire Makers, a band composed of mu
sicians with disabilities. Stanford's own Mixed Compa
ny and Jam Pac'd will perform as well.
Throughout the afternoon, members will lead nine
different arts and crafts workshops, such as tapestry
making, beaded jewelry-making and face-painting.
"I think that the workshops are a good way for
the kids to experiment with their artistic interests,"
said junior Robin Tsai, the group's director of pro
gram development.
In the tapestry-making workshop, for example, the
kids can decorate their own piece of cloth that will later
be compiled together to make one large tapestry to be
hung at future festivals.
One of the unique aspects of this event is that it is an
opportunity for the disabled children to participate in
an event together with their families.

"Often, it is difficult to find activities for both dis
abled children and their families because most activi
ties are geared only toward disabled children and are
supervised by trained professionals," Tsai said.
"The activities at the festival will allow all disabled
children to participate while allowing parents and sib
lings to enjoy the festival as well," he continued.
Attendance is not limited to disabled children and
their families. It is open to the community at large and
Stanford students. Other community members are ex
pected to attend.
"I hope that the festival will bring together different
communities and generate more awareness about dis
abilities," Lui said. "But perhaps most importantly, 1
hope that the kids have fun exploring the different
types of art at the festival because this day is really
about them and their achievements."
Kids With Dreams is the only organization affiliat
ed with the Haas Center for Public Service that works
with disabled children. Founded in 1997, it runs five
different volunteer programs.
According to Lui, the group's mission is to create
opportunities for disabled children through tutoring,
mentoring and one-on-one interaction in order to in
stil! in each child the belief that he or she can make a
valuable contribution to the world.
