# Spring trip looks at California's precious H2O
## Water, water everywhere 
### ROSE JENKINS 
While many students were splashing
in I lie waves on Waikiki beach, a few took
the road less traveled and spent their
spring break exploring the waters of Cen
tral Valley dams as part of an Alternative
Spring Break trip titled "Every Last
Drop: Protecting California's Most Im
portant Natural Resource."
For some students, i( was precisely
the unconventional aspects that attract
ed them to the trip. Sophomore Bran
den I'arlow was looking to find out
more about an issue that had always
puzzled him.
"(Irowing up on the fringe of the ever
expanding urban-growth boundary back
home, I've found it interesting how soci
eties manage the incentives to expand or
sprawl with a somewhat limited concern
for the natural resources that support
them," fal low said.
Previous experience with conserva
tion issues was not a prerequisite lor the
trip, which was informative for organiz
ers and participants alike.
"We did some preliminary research
before applying, just to know what we

were getting into, but we really were in
lor as much of a learning experience as
our participants," said the trip co-leader,
Kali Stanger, a junior majoring in human
biology.
file actual trip was preceded by a win
ter quarter ( lass organized by Stanger
and her co-leader Alex Greninger, a ju
nior.
"As always, [Alternative Spring Break]
involves a 10-week directed reading on a
service issue, so we did all that with lec
tures from [Assoc. Civil and Environmen
tal Engineer Prof.] David I'reyberg and
[Geophysics Prof.] Rosemary Knight,"
C Ireninger said.
The participants had a chance lo com
pare perspectives from an array of au
thorities that included a Central Valley
Water District manager, a Sierra Club
representative, Stanford's Mousing Re
solute Manager Robert Kolar, as well as
some students with experience working
on environmental issues.
"It was easy to understand the class
room concepts once we were in the field
seeing how they apply in the real world,"
Stanger said.
Stanger cited the example of the

process offish screening, which was fre
quently discussed in the class. Yet, she did
not obtain a firm grasp of it until her
group visited the new $8-million facility
in a Central Valley irrigation district.
()ne of the I rip's highlights lor Stanger
was the first day when the students met
with representatives from agricultural in
terest groups.
"It seems that it's so easy to blame
water shortage problems on farmers, but
the lolks we talked to really seemed to
have a good perspective on water conser
vation, as well as the need to feed Califor
nians," Stanger said.
1 he 10 participants then traveled to
Yosemite fora discussion with a repre
sentative of "Restore I letch I letcliy" — a
group advocating the removal of
O'Shaughnessy Dam from the national
park for the purposes of restoring the
natural state of the I letch I letcliy Valley
in Yosemite National Park. The (lass's
busy schedule continued with a journey
northeast to the Lake Tahoe Kcological
Forum.
"It was a great opportunity to talk with

the key players involved — from
farmers in an irrigation district to
an extreme environmentalist who
wanted to knock down a dam,"
Tarlow said.
The one regret Stanger had
about the trip was not being able to
arrange more service opportunities.
"Our trip definitely slanted to
ward the learning rather than ser
vice side," she said. Snowy weather
in both Yosemite and Tahoe ten

dered the idea impractical.
The trip concluded with a visit
to a state park, where the partici
pants listened lor a goshawk, a bird
that may soon be added to the en
dangered species list.
"And the other high point for
me was watching the sun rise in the
snowy forest as our group sur
veyed a huge area of forest lor
goshawks," Tarlow said.
Getting to know all the group
members was an added bonus of
the trip.
" There was something magical
about the dynamics of our group,"
Stanger explained. "We all loved

what we were learning about and
had a great time doing it."
"It was like going on a trip with
a bunch of friends," Tarlow added.
Stanger found the trip one of
the best experiences she has had at
Stanford, both because of the
friendships she formed and the
unique leadership and teaching
experience she gained.
"Working with environmental
groups around California was also
especially rewarding, lor there are
a ton of knowledgeable, friendly
people out there who are starving
for student interest and (wo)man
power," Stanger said.

" There was something magical
about the dynamics of our group,"
Stanger explained. "We all loved

what we were learning about and
had a great time doing it."
"It was like going on a trip with
a bunch of friends," Tarlow added.
Stanger found the trip one of
the best experiences she has had at
Stanford, both because of the
friendships she formed and the
unique leadership and teaching
experience she gained.
"Working with environmental
groups around California was also
especially rewarding, lor there are
a ton of knowledgeable, friendly
people out there who are starving
for student interest and (wo)man
power," Stanger said.
