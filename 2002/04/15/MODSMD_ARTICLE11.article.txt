# Theta, Sigma Chi given social sanctions
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Because of Greek recruitment and
party-planning violations committed at
an oil-campus event at the end of last
quarter, Sigma Chi fraternity and
Kappa Alpha I beta sorority have been
prohibited from having more than one
oil-campus party this spring and in the
future will have to go through a more
rigorous administrative process to hold
similar parties.
The situation has gained extra atten
tion because of its timing — both organi
zations are in the midst of spring Rush
and Recruitment — but neither organi
zation expects its Rush and Recruitment
processes to be negatively impacted.
At the end of winter quarter, the two
organizations co-sponsored a "level live"
party at Compadre's Restaurant without
correctly registering it. Somewhere be
tween 25 and 40 percent ol the attendees
were freshmen. A level five party is de
lined by the ()llice of Student Activities as
an oil-campus party.
Rules governing fraternity and soror
ity events stipulate that organizations
cannot hold events targeted at freshmen
before the official Rush period, and the
(ireekJudicial Board ruled that the party
violated the spirit of this regulation.

I 'he Board's ruling states that each or
ganization can only hold one oil-campus
party lor the remainder of the academic
year and that they must submit an outline
detailing how they are going to handle
each level live party they throw. In addi
tion, they must collaboratively plan a
campus-wide event increasing University
awareness of the (ireek community. The
decision was announced last Thursday.
Rumors that both organizations had
been put on alcohol probation quickly
surfaced, but members of both Sigma Chi
and I heta as well as the Intersorority
(Council and Interli aternity (Council pres
idents said that alcohol had nothing to do
with the Board's ruling.
"The issue didn't have to do with any
issue of alcohol policy," said senior Katie
Norman, the ISC president.
The presidents of both organizations
said that they considered the sanctions to
be fair.
"I leel very strongly that the (ireek Ju
dicial Board and the [OHice of Student
Activities] made an appropriate decision
regardingTheta's involvement in this so
cial event," said junior Leah Brunski, the
Kappa Alpha Theta president.
"I like the way they considered the na
ture of the event in determining the sanc
tions," she said, noting that each of the
repercussions deals with the specific viola

tions the groups made.
Both Brunski and junior Bobby Jams,
president of Sigma Chi, emphasized that
they broke University policy unintention
ally, which the Board took into consider
ation in making its decision.
"We didn't intend to target freshmen,
but the event ended up being attended by
freshmen," Brunski said.
"We left it open, invite who you want,"
Jams said.
Brunski said that the situation could
ultimately prove beneficial to the campus
at large, as it sheds light on the potential
ly ambiguous rules that Greek organiza
tions work under.
"1 see this as an opportunity to better
understand what University party policy
and Rush policy is," she said.
According to senior Marty Ruano, the
IKC president, organizations are aware of
the policies governing these issues, but it
is not always clear how they should oper
ate under them.
"For the IFC, as of two years ago we
didn't have by-laws written down,"
Ruano said. "We have them now, but we
feel like it's an inibrmal thing, people
know what you can and can't do.
"In most part, all chapters do know,
but there still exists ambiguity in terms of
laws," lie said.
"1 think people know the laws,
the ambiguity comes in implemen
tation," Norman said.
Under normal circumstances,
(lie ISC and IKC presidents
would not have been involved in
with the judicial process lor iliis

sort of violation. However, be
cause of the timing of the viola
tion, the Board and the ISC, and
11C wanted to ensure thai Rush
was not adversely affected.
"| I be Board was) concerned
with how (lie timing of this would
affect the Creek community at
large during rush," Knano said.
The judicial board did a good
job about trying to be fair and not
luuting our Rush," Brunski said.
There were also concerns that

other fraternities or sororities
could use the violations to influ
ence rushees, which Kuano and
Norman both wanted (o avoid
through their involvement.
"It's much harder for one
chapter to tell lies about another
when the truth is known,"
Ruano said.
For Theta, Nrunski said that
the sanctions have little effect on
them and that they are currently
working to move only one of

their traditional parties on cam
pus as a result.
In terms of Recruitment, Nor
man said none of (lie potential
members know which girls were
at the party last quarter and an
announcement was made on the
lirst day of the process to explain
the situation.
Norman added that the situa
tion has not had any ostensible neg
ative ellects on the process.
"This year more than any other

year, we've had less freshman
drop," she said.
Brunski said that the same was
true for Theta's numbers to date.
Ruano said that lie did not plan
to specifically address fraternity
rushees about the incident.
Sigma Chi Rush chairman
Adam Fuller did not think that the
punishment would affect the
Sigma Chi Rush.
"We really don't think it's going
to aflect our Rush adversely in any

way," he said.
"We think we're going to be able
to [Kill just as strong a pledge class
of rushees as in years past."
According to Jaros, it will have
little pragmatic effect on Sigma
Chi's social calendar.
When asked what impact the
punishment would have on
Sigma Chi's year, Jaros respond
ed, "Zero. We only had one off
campus party scheduled the en
tire quarter."
