RAM ALLAH, West Bank (AP) —
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat re
buffed Secretary of State Colin Powell's
demand yesterday fora halt to violence,
saying Israel first must withdraw its
troops from the West Bank.
Powell, shuttling back to Israel fora
meeting in Tel Aviv, then pressed Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon fora complete
pullback, a U.S. official said.
Sharon renewed his proposal for an
international peace conference among
Israel and Arab states including Saudi
Arabia, Syria and Lebanon and the
Palestinians, but not Yasser Arafat.
Sharon said the United States would
lead the conference, and"I imagine that
within a short time a conference of this
sort will convene to debate the diplomat
ic arrangements in the Middle East."
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat
said the proposal was an attempt to
"turn the clock backward."
A senior U.S. oilicial said the idea was
discussed "as part of a way to move for
ward politically," but more talks were
needed.
Arafat, 72, appeared in good health
as lie met with Powell in his rocket
scarred headquarters that is surround
ed by Israeli tanks and troops. Arafat
has been under pressure that is "unre
al for an old man like him," said Zeid
Abu Shawish, a Palestinian doctor in
the compound.

Powell was driven to the besieged
compound in a motorcade of armored
plated SUVs, shielded by U.S. security
personnel with submachine guns.
The headquarters showed the effects
of Israeli bombardment. A gaping hole
marred the facade and the walls were
blackened with bullet marks.
A senior aide, Saeb Erekat, said
Arafat stood by his commitments, in
cluding an end to violence. But, Erekat
said after the three-hoilr meeting, that
meant "once the Israelis complete the
withdrawal we will, as Palestinians, then
carry out our obligations."
Arafat complained bitterly and ex
tensively to Powell about Israel's mili
tary thrust into Palestinian-held towns
and villages, and especially its actions in
Jenin and a refugee camp in the town.
President George W. Bush has de
manded a pullback right away, but
Sharon refused to provide a timetable
when he saw Powell on Friday in
Jerusalem. They met again briefly last
night in fel Aviv.
Powell, in a short statement to re
porters, called his meeting with Arafat
useful «md constructive.
A senior U.S. official said Powell's
"clear message" to Arafat in a 45-minute
presentation was"the bombings have to
stop, that it was a major barrier" to
progress toward a security agreement
or 011 negotiations that Powell has said

should lead to establishment of a Pales
tinian state.
Powell and Arafat directed top aides
to meet today on "a variety of ideas." 1 Ie
provided no details.
Palestinian Parliament Speaker
Ahmed Quriea, who attended the meet
ing around a second-tloor dining room
table, told The Associated Press: "We
told Secretary Powell that we shall not
discuss any subject before Israel pulls
out" from towns and villages occupied
since March 29.
"We told him that it's time to speak
about a Palestinian state along the lines"
that existed before Israel occupied land
seized during the 19(>7 Mideast war, the
Palestinian official said.
I Ie said Arafat and Powell were ex
pected to meet again Tuesday.
A foreign policy adviser to Sharon
said Israel has "already made substan
tial progress in heeding to the presi
dent's request, and we pulled out of sub
stantial areas."
"On the other hand, we have not
seen any movement from the Pales
tinians in what they were requested to
do," Including accepting a meaning
ful cease-fire and cooperating on secu
rity, Danny Ayalon said on ABC's
"This Week."
Initially, Powell was expected to fly
home Tuesday, but preparations are
underway fora longer stay in the region.
