## The
						Stanford Daily Special-fee bids warrant careful consideration 
### 
Published Since J 891

The IRS isn't the only group in the
country receiving money this week;
52 Stanford student groups, includ
ing The Daily, are hoping to get
their special fees requests approved by the stu
dent body. Because of the dramatic increase in
special fees requests — 52 this year compared
to 41 last year — and the possible rise in ASSU
fees next year, we strongly urge students to
vote discriminately this week. We also believe
the ASSU should exert some control over
which groups can request special fees for the
first time or perhaps change the voting proce
dure from a simple yes / no ballot.
For many groups, no special fees means
being unable to continue operations next
year. However, when carefully examining
various budget proposals on the ASSU Web
site, one will find that some groups request
thousands of special-fee dollars for refresh-

ments, and others budget seemingly exorbi
tant sums for photocopying fees. We do not
wish to suggest that these budgeted items are
completely unnecessary, but students should
carefully consider what their special-fee
money is going to be used for.
One item to ponder is whether special-fees
approval would end up benefiting a large de
mographic of Stanford. We wonder, for exam
ple, whether large travel costs that will help a
few students should really be paid for by the
entire student body. Charging membership
dues or alumni membership fees would at
least begin to ease many groups' financial situ
ations. We believe measures such as these
should be taken before the entire student
body is asked to foot the bill for an alumni
newsletter to be sent out.
Part of the problem with the system is how
seemingly easy it is to obtain special fees.

Only one undergraduate group was denied
special fees in last year's election and four
were denied in 1999. From this we infer that,
if a group goes through the procedures set
forth by the ASSU, it is almost certain to get
its request approved. Therefore, while stu
dents should certainly examine their voting
behavior, the ASSU might also want to ex
hibit more caution before approving a group
for special fees.
A large potential increase in ASSU fees
next year should have been a concern for this
year's Undergraduate Senate when review
ing special-fees requests. After all, if students
feel the ASSU fees are too extravagant, there
will likely be an increase in fee-refund re
quests. Since students who receive a refund
on a given group's fee can become ineligible
to participate in that group's activities, this
could cause groups to lose student support at

their events, leading to decreased student in
volvement in the community.
As it stands, students find themselves caught
in the moral dilemma of wanting to support a
group's cause, but not wanting to give the
group as much money as it has requested. We
urge groups to carefully re-examine their bud
geted items, and consider which elements they
could raise on their own. They should take
into account that a request for too much
money might lead to receiving no money at all.
We also believe encouraging groups to
raise money from members, alumni, and the
surrounding community would benefit us all
in the long run. This would help groups be
come financially independent, allowing them
to continue contributing unique qualities to
our campus without relying solely on stu
dents' checkbooks to make those contribu
tions possible.
