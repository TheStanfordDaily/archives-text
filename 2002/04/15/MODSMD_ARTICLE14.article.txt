# CHASING MY TAIL
## Promises, promises 
### 
When 1 grow up, I will let my
kids eat marshmallow
chocolate sandwiches for
breakfast. 1 will watch car
toons and play video games all week
long. My house will be a spaceship —
with a swimming pool, and a roller
coaster, and a chocolate factory,
and ....
Growing up, we make ourselves all
sorts of promises. Some, like the marsh
mallow-chocolate orgy, are better kept in
moderation. But what about the serious
promises, the ones that speak to the basic
values that will govern our interactions
with the other humans whose lives inter
sect ours?
What about, "When I grow up, 1 will
be fair to other people" or " I will not

walk by homeless people
as though they didn't
exist" or "I will look for
partners who appreciate
me for myself and not
my beauty-making
skills." What happened
to those promises?
Somewhere along the
way, life got complicated.

Sometimes, I stop in the streets of San
Francisco to buy the Street Spirit news
paper. Other times, though, I nocl hello
to those homeless people but realize 1
don't have a limitless supply of money. If
I give that guy my change, I won't have
money for bus fare.
And sometimes, I nod "sorry, man" to
the guy begging for change fora differ
ent reason. I 've got money in my pocket,
but I'm saving that money to buy books,
or to pay the cover charge at a club.
And then there's the boy issue. I've
noticed — though perhaps you disagree
—that it's a lot easier to get attention
from the opposite (or same) sex when
you look more like the woman on the
cover of Cosmo and less like the wild
haired, baggy-jeans kid you used to be.
So maybe you have a way of keeping
yourself whole in spite of mainstream
beauty standards. Maybe you reject
makeup or don't shave your legs, or ac
tively love your body at whatever size.
Hut can you honestly say you don't like
to wear slimming clothes? I can't.
And what about fairness, the "Do unto
others" idea that we were taught as chil
dren? There are a million and one ways
we can carry out this value, as there are
that exact number of injustices in the
world.
But even as we organize to change
some of those injustices, we perpetuate
others. We use sexism to fight racism, na
tionalism to fight classism, classism to
fight nationalism.
Historically, movements for human
rights have called on men and women to
participate in the struggle in different

ways. It's no accident that the modern
flurry of women's rights movements
grew out of the civil rights struggle.
Picket-line speakers emphasize that
poverty wages go against our "uniquely
American" values. And movements for
economic justice have emphasized the
unity of the working classes against the
ruling classes in order to point out that
national boundaries should not stand in
the way of solidarity.
On campus, we can run a campaign to
raise wages for University workers. But if
we don't consult those workers on what
is important to them, and if we don't
make sure they hold leadership positions
within the organization, we continue to
withhold power from those we are trying
to help gain respect.
On the other hand, though, if we wait
until we have a perfect idea of the work
ing conditions all over campus, the cam
paign may never get of 112 the ground. Lo
gistic ally, it's impossible to expect perfec
tion at all times.
Heck, even Martin Luther King, Jr.
was a womanizer. But does that negate
the work that he and thousands of other
committed organizers did in the name of
civil rights?
The fact is, if we got angry at every
single thing that was unjust or didn't
conform to our values, we'd never, ever
smile again.
Weid have to be bitter at every James
Bond movie for blatantly glorifying gen
der and race-based power differences.
We'd have to be angry at every movie, pe
riod. We'd have to reject our clothing,
our education, our music, our friends.
Everything we do, every part of society is
shaped by a patriarchal, unequal culture.
So what should we do — hold our
breath and try not to move? That way,
we'd make sure not to perpetuate an un
just society.
Some take this route, for example, by
choosing not to vote at all because they
don't believe in our system of govern
ment. I think it's a mistake, though, to
reject movements for positive change be
cause they are not ideal.
We've just got to learn to deal with the
illogic that seems to rule our lives. We've
got to seek out ways to change the parts
that feel oppressive while still enjoying
the fruits of participation in society. You
and me and our respective mamas —
we're all walking contradictions.
We can strive to dismantle the mas
ter's house without using the master's
tools. We can work to bring about a just
society solely by just means. — but in re
ality, is that possible? Can anyone think
of an example? I hope so.
