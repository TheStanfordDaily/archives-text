WRC campaign leader endorses
Osofsky / Root
I am writing this letter to endorse
Michael Osofsky and Megan Root for
ASSU president/ vice-president. As the stu
dent leader of the campaign for Stanford to
join the Worker Rights Consortium, I am
convinced that Osofsky and Root are the
most capable slate to effectively advocate on
be half of student interests.
For the last few months, I have pushed
the WRC to countless student leaders.
Throughout the entire process, Osofsky
and Root have stood behind me to offer
support and guidance.
However, this supportive approach was
not unique to me. Root has worked with
over 200 student groups as the chair of the
Senate Appropriations Committee, allocat
ing over $350,000 to student groups. While
helping me, Osofsky has embarked on pro
grammatic endeavors like the revamping
of the Corner Pocket and the Treehouse,
producing more tangible results as Senate
Deputy Chair than most previous repre
sentatives who occupied that post.
As a student-athlete and leader of a
large campaign, I know how much time
the two of them have put into the ASSU to
improve things for Stanford students:
They have been true public servants for
the past three years.
Root's approach to dealing with stu
dent groups as appropriations chair is
wonderfully refreshing. Beyond being
exceptionally competent, she is warm
and friendly to student leaders and goes

above and beyond what is necessary with
in the context of her job â€” it is common
to find her working in the ASSU office at
ungodly hours in the middle of the night
or over the weekend.
She knows the ASSU inside and out and
has forged relationships with the CEO of
Stanford Student Enterprises, ASSU Bank
ing and every other internal substructure
of the ASSU. When you complain about the
inefficiencies of misinformation with the
ASSU, Megan is the most qualified candi
date in this campaign to make serious head
way to ameliorate such problems.
It is in this light that I have been sad
dened to hear rumors and character at
tacks on Osofsky. Some have stated they
feel he is a "resume packer" or "under
handed" in his desire to gain the ASSU
presidency. As a student leader who has
worked with Michael for over a year, let me
serve as one to publicly dispel these rumors.
During his time at Stanford, Mike has de
voted hundreds of hours to improving cam
pus establishments and has fought on behalf
of all of us to make things better. Through
his many programmatic endeavors, he has
forged working relationships with adminis
trators in nearly every department and
made the connections necessary to take on
even the largest, most impacting projects,
like a new student union. Already, Osofsky
and Root have authored a proposal fora
new Student Union and will submit it to top
administrators this spring.
In light of both Osofsky's and Root's
true devotion to the Stanford community
and the ASSU, 1 urge you to join me in vot

ing Osofsky/Root for ASSU president /
vice-president this Tuesday and Wednes
day. I am convinced the two of them will
accomplish tangible results and enact true
change as elected officials.

GSC officer urges qrad students to
support Osofsky / Root
I am writing to urge graduate students
to support Michael Osofsky and Megan
Root for ASSU president and vice-presi
dent in the upcoming ASSU elections.
During the last year, 1 have served as Fi
nancial Officer of the Graduate Student
Council, having worked with Osofsky on
the Executive Committee of the ASSU, and
with Root on several ASSU fiscal matters.
Osofsky and Root are the only candi
dates with experience working with gradu
ate students on issues that most affect grad
uate student and student family quality of
life, and the only slate capable of furthering
the advances made by graduate students
this past year.
As a member of the Cowell Insurance
Advisory Committee and one of the
founders of Graduate Student Health
Care Task Force, I have devoted great ef
fort to one of the most complex issues fac
ing Stanford graduate students. This year,
graduate students have made tremendous
progress in obtaining sustainable health
