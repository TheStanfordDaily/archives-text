WRC campaign leader endorses
Osofsky / Root
I am writing this letter to endorse
Michael Osofsky and Megan Root for
ASSU president/ vice-president. As the stu
dent leader of the campaign for Stanford to
join the Worker Rights Consortium, I am
convinced that Osofsky and Root are the
most capable slate to effectively advocate on
be half of student interests.
For the last few months, I have pushed
the WRC to countless student leaders.
Throughout the entire process, Osofsky
and Root have stood behind me to offer
support and guidance.
However, this supportive approach was
not unique to me. Root has worked with
over 200 student groups as the chair of the
Senate Appropriations Committee, allocat
ing over $350,000 to student groups. While
helping me, Osofsky has embarked on pro
grammatic endeavors like the revamping
of the Corner Pocket and the Treehouse,
producing more tangible results as Senate
Deputy Chair than most previous repre
sentatives who occupied that post.
As a student-athlete and leader of a
large campaign, I know how much time
the two of them have put into the ASSU to
improve things for Stanford students:
They have been true public servants for
the past three years.
Root's approach to dealing with stu
dent groups as appropriations chair is
wonderfully refreshing. Beyond being
exceptionally competent, she is warm
and friendly to student leaders and goes

above and beyond what is necessary with
in the context of her job — it is common
to find her working in the ASSU office at
ungodly hours in the middle of the night
or over the weekend.
She knows the ASSU inside and out and
has forged relationships with the CEO of
Stanford Student Enterprises, ASSU Bank
ing and every other internal substructure
of the ASSU. When you complain about the
inefficiencies of misinformation with the
ASSU, Megan is the most qualified candi
date in this campaign to make serious head
way to ameliorate such problems.
It is in this light that I have been sad
dened to hear rumors and character at
tacks on Osofsky. Some have stated they
feel he is a "resume packer" or "under
handed" in his desire to gain the ASSU
presidency. As a student leader who has
worked with Michael for over a year, let me
serve as one to publicly dispel these rumors.
During his time at Stanford, Mike has de
voted hundreds of hours to improving cam
pus establishments and has fought on behalf
of all of us to make things better. Through
his many programmatic endeavors, he has
forged working relationships with adminis
trators in nearly every department and
made the connections necessary to take on
even the largest, most impacting projects,
like a new student union. Already, Osofsky
and Root have authored a proposal fora
new Student Union and will submit it to top
administrators this spring.
In light of both Osofsky's and Root's
true devotion to the Stanford community
and the ASSU, 1 urge you to join me in vot

ing Osofsky/Root for ASSU president /
vice-president this Tuesday and Wednes
day. I am convinced the two of them will
accomplish tangible results and enact true
change as elected officials.

GSC officer urges qrad students to
support Osofsky / Root
I am writing to urge graduate students
to support Michael Osofsky and Megan
Root for ASSU president and vice-presi
dent in the upcoming ASSU elections.
During the last year, 1 have served as Fi
nancial Officer of the Graduate Student
Council, having worked with Osofsky on
the Executive Committee of the ASSU, and
with Root on several ASSU fiscal matters.
Osofsky and Root are the only candi
dates with experience working with gradu
ate students on issues that most affect grad
uate student and student family quality of
life, and the only slate capable of furthering
the advances made by graduate students
this past year.
As a member of the Cowell Insurance
Advisory Committee and one of the
founders of Graduate Student Health
Care Task Force, I have devoted great ef
fort to one of the most complex issues fac
ing Stanford graduate students. This year,
graduate students have made tremendous
progress in obtaining sustainable health
care and housing solutions.
Therefore, I have a great deal of inter
est in seeing the new ASSU executive con
tinue these successes. Osofsky and Root
are the only candidates with both the
knowledge and experience in issues of
graduate-student quality of life needed to
become a partner with graduate students
in making further gains in these areas.
Graduate student issues are frequent
ly tangible, local and non-ideological, re
quiring intensive preparation, good rela
tionships with administrators, sophistica
tion in negotiating and the ability to forge
alliances. Osofsky and Root are unique in
that they have an impressive record of
getting things done that directly impact
student quality of life. In addition, they
have proven their ability to create effec
tive channels of communication among
students, staff, faculty, administrators
and contractors. They are the only candi
dates who will rise above invidious politi
cal ideologies and bromides to seek prac
tical solutions to persistent graduate stu
dent problems.
I can say that Osofsky and Root would
regard it a great honor to have the confi
dence and support of the highest quality
graduate students from around the world.
Their vision is, above all others, that the
best students in the world live, study and
work in the best university environment in
the world. They are the only candidates

with a distinguished record of turning vi
sion into tangible results for students.

Sophomore thanks Osofsky for 'proactive
steps' to improve student fife
As the ASSU elections come each year, I
grow tired looking at laundry lists of unre
alistic promises, catchy slogans and fliers.
But after visiting the revamped Corner
Pocket and reading that ASSU Under
graduate Senator Michael Osofsky was re
sponsible for the reforms, it convinces me
that ASSU members like Osofsky can and
are willing to carry out initiatives that im
prove student life.
As a car-less sophomore, I understand
the frustrations with finding it difficult to
do the most basic things that having the
money for transportation can provide such
as finding places to hang out, or even to
have a casual dinner. I was very frustrated
with the lack of student-orientedness of the
student union since it means that if you do
not have a car, having a social life beyond
drinking parties seems near impossible. I
welcome ()sofsky and the ASSU's proactive
steps to make I residder and Stanford
more student-oriented.
The existence of these changes to the
Corner Pocket are a necessary first step to
improving the social life at Stanford. These
seemingly small additions mean a lot for
someone who in my position, has to rely

solely on public transportation just to find
places to hang out socially.
What is particularly impressive is Osof
sky's initiative to take a good idea and to
implement it for the purpose of helping
the student body We elect student repre
sentation to support such independent
initiatives — to deliver concrete changes
that assist student life.
After seeing that Osofsky is running for
ASSU president, I think about the little bit
that his work has improved my life at Stan
ford as a car-less sophomore and I know
that he definitely has my vote.

Intermission reader defends film critic
1 am writing in response to Chris Lee's
Intermission review of "Big Trouble," in
which he calls Leonard Malt in "that übiq
uitous critic who after all these years of
watching movies si ill can't seem to oiler in
sightful analysis about any of them." Lee
apparently mistakes Maltin's conciseness
and brevity for lack of insight.
1 could point to Maltin's numerous
books on animation, his highly successful
efforts (o popularize overlooked or ignored
films, his admirably eclectic yet disciplined
taste, or his hilarious cameo appearances in
such films as "Gremlins 2" and "Forgotten
Silver" to defend him, but that is not neces
sary. I lis criticism speaks for itself. Exam
ples of insightful comments abound in his
writing; in particular, his olt-cited review of
the 1948 musical "Isn't It Romantic?" is a

model for film critics everywhere.

ASSU Senate 'useless'
ASSU elections are the yearly moment
when Stanford becomes enough aware of
the ASSU to mock it. We criticize our gov
ernment for being detached from students,
ineffective and bureaucratically sluggish.
Senators win on sexy slogans, not poignant
platforms, and once in office, fiiil to deliver
or to respond to important issues.
So what if we got rid of senators entire
ly? What if we instead elected or recruited
people throughout the year to handle cer
tain tasks, such as changing the 1 icehouse
menu, expanding Marguerite service, ne
gotiating workers' wages with the Univer
sity, lowering bookstore prices, distribut
ing free Krispy Kremes at the post office,
and so on?
Then the ASSU would be malleable,
task-oriented and passionate, rather than
power-oriented and retarded by bureau
cracy, ego and nebulous goals. Candidates
who are truly passionate about their issues
would then be able to put that enthusiasm
into solving problems, not drafting posters.
Students who love the paper-pushing
aspects of government, such as allocating
budgets for student groups, could then
sign up for those specific roles. And candi
dates who just want the political ego trip
could take a hike.
Moreover, the whole student body
would be constantly aware of what the stu

dent body was doing, because throughout
the year we would be asked to join in. This
year Matt Brewer and Christine Corclero
created ASSI Community Teams to target
transportation, faculty diversity and the
arts. These committees invited students
into the ASSU to execute specific projects.
It was a great model lor which they should
be commended. These types of commit
tees, created by the president / vice-presi
dent or by students themselves, should re
place the Senate.
We still need the ASSU. The president
and vice-president still have important
roles as student liaisons, drafters of the
ASSU's mission and knowledgeable
sources of guidance.
lUu the Senate is useless. Or is it? Perhaps
the senators need to form another commit
tee to inform us that they are forming com
mittees to inform us that we elected them.

Prior letter requires correction
I would like to make a correction to the
letter I wrote to The Daily on Friday ("South
African Jew responds to 'apartheid' letter").
I mistakenly wrote lh.it "there are numer
ous Palestinian and Muslim states." That's
not what I meant to say, because I definitely
know that there is no Palestinian state yet. I
meant to say "there are numerous Arab and
Muslim states" and that's why the existence
of a Jewish state is justified.
