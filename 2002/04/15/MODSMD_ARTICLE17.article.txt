# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Presidential candidates respond to ASSU officers' challenge 
### 
OSOFSKY / ROOT
1. The ASSU governing bodies cannot represent ihe
student body in "matters not directly affecting Stanford
students." Campaign claims outside this boundary
would be nonsensical. However, the resources, advice
and facilitation skills of the executive office can still be
useful to students interested in broader issues.
2. In the past year, the Board ol Trustees approved in
creases in tuition! room and board. Also notable was its
selection of University President John Hennessy. In
general, its decisions impact student life minimally
when compared with those of the Faculty Senate. The
cancellation of Latin American Studies and allocation of
housing to two fraternities demonstrate the pertinence
of Faculty Senate decisions. Accordingly, increasing stu
dent involvement in and awareness of Faculty Senate
committees is one of our three primary issues. Tangible
improvements can and will be made to student cog
nizance of and efficacy within Faculty Senate if elected.
3. Our vision for student space improvements is separat
ed into four areas: student group space, a new student
union, a graduate student community center and grad
uate student housing. Understanding the fixed amount
of space, our plan of action for next year is realistic. We
have set specific, pragmatic goals in each area. We will
begin by evaluating the current allocations of space to
understand student need. Next, we'll search for creative
solutions, such as Meyer Library or the old Alumni
House. Next, we'll present a larger proposal for alloca
tion of space within the future General Use Permit.
4. The Undergraduate Senate and Graduate Student
Council are extremely important to the success of the
ASSU. Approximately half of our vision for next year is
devoted to extension and improvement of current
ASSU endeavors, many of which were initiated by the
current legislative bodies. Thus, it is critical for us to
maintain close contact with past legislators and solicit the
support of the current legislators for implementation.
For next year, the legislative bodies will develop their
own agendas and it would be unfair to press projects on
them. If vision-oriented disagreement exists, our con
sistent presence at their meetings will act as the starting
point for constructive dialogue. Our vision is not and
will never be inflexible, as we will always respond to stu
dents and elected officials.
5. First, the financial structure and cash Hows of our uni
versity are extremely complex and it is not necessarily
true that decreased revenue at Tresidder Union neces
sitates increased tuition. It is true however that health
care, child care, transportation and space all cost money.
Our plan for the immediate future is reprioritization of
University administration's discretionary funds and so
licitation of outside funds specifically for student life im
provements. An increase in tuition is definitely not in the
interests of students.
6. Every presidential campaign includes buzzwords, like
diversity and accountability. Rather than just dropping
these buzzwords, we have made specific step-by-step plans
for tangible improvements. Campaign promises are often
made without knowledge of the history behind t he issue
and the inherent limitations involved. We have prelimi
narily researched each of our campaign aims to avoid this
problem. Additionally, we've already written and revised
the first-ever actual proposal fora new student union, to
be submitted for inclusion in the administration's agenda.

BENSON / ARIMOTO
1. The ASSU Constitution forbids the ASSU from
commenting on outside matters, so ASSU advocacy is
limited to issues that directly affect students. As for po
litically charged topics, such as the Workers Rights
Consortium, we will focus our advocacy efforts on is
sues that affect everyone: student representation on
the Board of Trustees, ending unilateral action
against student groups such as the Band — there's
simply too much to do next year to spend time play
ing politics on anything else.
2. Ihe Board ofTrustees directs most major Univer
sity policies through such actions as approving the
University's budget in June, setting next year's tu
ition, and, recently, approving a change to Stanford's
tenure process. Thus, we have a detailed plan to get
student representation on the Board, giving students
a say in these decisions.
The Faculty Senate plays a large role in directing aca
demic: programs. It approved the termination of de
gree programs in Latin American Studies but also
voted to renew the LAS honors program, proving
that when students speak with a loud voice, the Uni
versity listens. Thus, we'll work to facilitate communi
cation between student representatives to Faculty
Senate committees and the campus at large.
3. It's simply not feasible for the ASSU to force the ad
ministration to redirect the millions of dollars in
volved in new construction projects — and anyone
who suggests otherwise is being dishonest about the
powers of the ASSU. What the ASSU can do, howev
er, is lobby the administration to speed up existing
construction timelines and work with the administra
tion to make the allocation and reservation of student
space more efficient, introducing online booking at
venues such as Tresidder Union.
4. In talking with the Senate and CSC candidates in
this race, I believe we share a similar vision, and I will
work with all 32 ASSU officers to implement our
ideas. However, if bodies such as the Advocacy Com
mittee continue to waste time on meaningless resolu
tions, we'll use the power and discretionary money of
the executive branch to create special committees to
work on the issues students care about.
5. Again, it's not realistic to pretend the ASSU can di
rect the budget priorities of the administration. Thus, a
number of our proposals work within existing financial
constraints. A San Francisco shuttle to make up for the
loss of weekend CalTrain service, for instance, would
pay for itself through a small fee. Reduced residential
parking enforcement after 8 p.m. would cost nothing.
(j. We'll accomplish our goals because we'll have the
student body on our side, something the ASSU has
lacked recently as an insular and, quite frankly,
mocked institution. By strengthening communica
tion between the ASSU and students, we'll create the
pressure necessary to force administrative action.
That means using local media for publicity, distribut
ing the ASSU newsletter across campus, and expand
ing the depth of ASSU advocacy proposals. Finally,
we'll get our goals accomplished because they are re
alistic — no laundry lists of 30 issues, no promises to
make textbooks cheaper —just six or seven solid so
lutions that will improve Stanford life.

MILLER / MALVEA
We're glad that Henry Towsner and Alex
Shvartsman are asking candidates to show that
they've thought about the history and mechanisms
of the ASSU.
Too often candidates speak of "what" they'll do,
as they think of "who" will do it (themselves), while
neglecting "how" they'll accomplish what they
claim.
We're an interesting slate because we're promis
ing not to serve in the ASSU government next year
(we'll resign or withdraw). We're a slate, so we're
not seeking name recognition for our official
candidates.
We're speaking more broadly about what we
want to accomplish (reconnect and be more cre
ative), and we're all about the "how" : THINK!
As we've been thinkling, we've decided to em
phasize the ways we can all improve our lives here
by operating outside many of institutional struc
tures Towsner and Shvartsman refer to.
So we challenge the presidential and senate can
didates to work towards their stated goals next year,
even if they lose this election. We challenge you to
consider "how the ASSU works," something that
you define.
And we invite you to participate in a Day of In
fectious Smiling today, and to attend an über-picnic
today at noon in White Plaza.
We're glad that Towsner and Shvartsman are
asking about scarcity. (Where will the physical space
come from? Where will the money come from?)
Right on! We have similar questions.
When will Stanford administrators and donors
decide we've built enough buildings and parking
spaces? If you look at satellite photos of the cam
pus over time, you'll see how dramatically we've
been building up this campus.
When will we decide, in one of the most beauti
ful places in the world, to value more highly the
"meeting space" that is outside?
And what niceties are we, as students, willing to
sacrifice in order to ensure that the people who
clean our bathrooms, tend our gardens, and cook
our food are treated respectfully?
Finally, we're glad that Towsner and Shvartsman
are showing respect for the institution that we're
helping to build while at Stanford. We also have
questions about this.
The University founding documents state that
Stanford will serve to benefit humanity.
How can we encourage our professors to do re
search that is less than inane, and more than for
profit? How can we encourage our administrators
to create compassionate employment and environ
mental policies?
And how will we as students — as a generation —
voice our concern for others both around the world
and in future generations?

HENESTROZA/RODRIGUEZ
In order to increase the political capital of the ASSU
executive and honor the leadership of independent
student movements, our projects focus on the needs
and interests of Stanford students.
Like the rest of the ASSU, the Executive Office is
bound by a constitutional clause that prohibits the
ASSU from taking positions on issues not pertaining to
Stanford students. Therefore, our projects to amplify
student voice do not require that we ourselves take po
sitions on non-constitutional issues: we will ensure that
all interested students have an opportunity to speak to
the relevant University decision-makers.
Our relationship with the legislative bodies will be
one of facilitative leadership, in which we keep lines of
communication open and-recruit legislators to help
plan and implement our projects. We want to work
with the Undergraduate Senate Advocacy Committee
by supporting their growth towards more detailed
plans of actions. We will also find ways in which the Un
dergraduate Senate and Graduate Student Council
can work together for common aims such as improved
health care and child care.
As president and vice president, we will never trade
oil the interests of some students for the interests of oth
ers; no plan of ours, therefore, will ever involve an in
crease in tuition costs. Rather than requiring tradeoffs
between students, the ideas in our platform call for the
elimination of inefficiency in University allocation of re
sources. University's expenditure records provide evi
dence of such inefficiency; the Law School spends
$2,000 for chairs in its classrooms. Our campaign to
lower the cost of living on campus hinges on repriori
ti/.ing the University's allocation of funds so that stu
dents' quality oflife takes precedence.
Besides lobbying for long-term capital planning that
better incorporates student interests, in the short-term
wecan increase student activities space by restructuring
University space-reservation policies to include after
hours use of academic buildings by student groups.
To change the system, you must know it: for exam
ple, when the Board of Trustees increases tuition or re
duces the power of students to select committee repre
sentatives, we must use existing committee representa
tive structures to oppose such decisions. The same is
true of decisions made by the Faculty Senate, like the
strengthening of the freshman writing requirement or
the termination of Latin American Studies.
For us, it is not a matter of succeeding where others
have failed, but learning from the past to help guide the
future. We want to build on the work of previous ad
ministrations and use institutional memory while in
corporating fresh ideas born of outside experience.
We have extensive knowledge on these and many
other issues that we have gained through experience
and research; more importantly, we have a record of ef
fective action for every issue on our agenda.
