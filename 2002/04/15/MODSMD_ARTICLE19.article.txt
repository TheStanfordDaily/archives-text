As the NFL undergoes divisional
realignment for next season, the
Seat t le Seahawks are celebrating
their big move to the NFC by un
veiling a long-overdue uniform change.
While only a slightly different design, it's a
positive sign that the Seahawks are making
an effort to get out of the Hideously Ugly
Uniform Club. Unfortunately, there are still
may organizations is dire need of a de-ugli
fication agenda.
Offender # 1: The State of Florida. I'm
referring specifically to the spurious use of
teal by the Marlins, Jaguars, and Dolphins.
What sissified Floridian with a nostalgia for
the Crayola 64-crayon pack decided that
teal shall henceforth be the color most likely
to strike fear into the hearts of men? The
only thing intimidating about a 300-pound
guy in a teal uniform is the possibility that he
may be thinking of becoming the world's
fattest ballerina.
I mean, could these teams have picked a
color anywhere outside of pink less con
ducive to masculine exhortations of athletic
dominance? Every time I see a Dolphins
game on TV I get the urge to go grab some
Vagisil, paint my toenails, and start talking
about my feelings.
Offender # 2: The Cleveland Browns.
OK, so your team is handicapped by a
ridiculously simple name and an equally
ridiculous fan base. That is hardly an excuse
for allowing the team to take the field of bat
tle in uniforms so ugly they make UPS uni
forms look like they come straight out of a
Versace catalog.
The offense is compounded by the fact
that Cleveland was given a second chance
after the defection of the now Baltimore
Ravens, and that they still didn't learn their
lesson. What the deuce is it going to take to

make Cleveland realize that crap and or
ange do not make a winning combination?
Offender # 3: UCLA. Baby blue? Sky
blue? I'm not exactly sure what color the
Bruins wear, but somebody sure blew when
they decided that would make a great color
for their school. It's going to be an awfully
big challenge for the UCLA football team to
shed that soft image it's become known for
when their linebackers are dressed up like
Beaker from the Mupper Babies.
It would be a fascinating research exper
iment to actually detail the thought process
that occurred that ended with the affirma
tion that outfitting an entire athletic depart
ment in the most pansy color available is a
step in the right direction.
Honorable Mention: Los Angeles Clip
pers. No uniform change will ever change
the fact that this is still the Clippers, the worst
franchise in the history of professional sport.
Honorable Mention: Utah Jazz. Do they
even allow music in Utah?
Honorable Mention: New York Yan
kees. There is just nothing good about the
Yankees, period.
These organizations need to take a long
look at the teams that have traditionally
sported fashionable, yet intimidating uni
forms with great success. The Oakland
Raiders, the Dallas Cowboys and the Pitts
burgh Steelers. The uniform is the most
identifiable symbol ofwho the franchises are
and what they stand for. And any team that
can be associated with feminine hygiene
products should take a uniform change into
serious consideration.

Ryan Stewart is junior majoring in economics, and he
cannot fathom why it took the Buccaneers so many
years to get rid of those vomit-inducing yeUcm) uni
forms. He can be reached at iyanstew@stanford.edu.
