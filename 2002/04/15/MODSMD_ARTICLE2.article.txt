# Herstory a chance for awareness
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
After a two-year* hiatus, Herstory re
turns to Stanford this April.
Dubbed "a campus-wide celebration of
all women," the month-long series of
events, organized by the Women's Com
munity Center, is intended to raise aware
ness about women's matters.
"The idea is to try to get not just women
on campus to come together, but for every
body to come together and discuss issues
facing women," said Lisa Moore, assistant
director of the center.
"It spans a wide range of programs,"
said senior Lydia Poon, the academic and
career program coordinator for the center.
"We really think that there's something out
there for everyone."
According to Women's Center Director
Laura 1 larrison, Herstory had been a tra
dition at Stanford until 1999. However,
when several seniors responsible for orga
nizing it graduated, the program faded
away and such a celebration of women was
limited to International Women's Day-a
one-day event.
This year, because of scheduling, the
center could not celebrate International
Women's Day, which falls in March,
which is national women's history
month. Instead, the staff decided to rein
state Herstory.
"Ilerstory is our big programming bo

nan/a of the year," Poon said. "The whole
staff has been looking forward to Herstory
fora while."
Staff members see this month both as an
opportunity to effectively discuss impor
tant issues facing women as well as a critical
event for the center itself.
"[Celebrating women over the course of
a month] gives people a chance to see a
concentrated package of events. People
pay attention more," Moore said.
"All the community centers sort of have
a big time they are spotlighted on campus,
and this is sort of the Women's Center's
time," Harrison said.
1 lerstory programming began on Tues
day with a kick-off party at the center.
The month features more than 10
events, in a combination of large lectures

and performances, small discussions and
educational programs.
In the past week, the first of the pro
gram, the center has held events for
women to share poetry and writing, and
for queer women to share stories at a
dinner discussion. In addition, on
Thursday night a Stanford graduate
performed at the Coffee House and
prominent feminist Gloria Steinem
spoke at Kresge Auditorium.
Upcoming events include lunch with
Ms. Magazine's Woman of the Year, a hike
repair workshop, discussions on obesity
and contraception, an interfaith service, a
rally against sexual assault and a perfor
mance by the Guerrilla Girls, a group of

artists and performers that educate
about sexism and racism.
According to Moore, the center
expects attendance to be between
30 and 50 people for each of the
events, with the exception of larger
events like the (iuerrilla (lirls' per
formance.
"Realistically, Stanford is a busy
plat e," Moore said. "Ifwe get more
1 ti."n that, that's great."
However, Moore said she sees
the likelihood of having a relatively
small turnout as a plus.
"I think more is gained when
you can have smaller events
where people can have discus

sions," she said.
I he center's members also said
that they encouraged men to at
tend the events as well.
l'oon described the overall pur
pose of the month as two-fold: "to
bring awareness to women's issues,
and to have fun."
Moore emphasized that cele
brations like I lerstory are especial
ly important now, when many peo
ple - both women and men - tend
to downplay the issues women
often face.
"A lot of women right now don't
understand the importance of hav
ing women-specific program
ming," Moore said. "One of the
things these events do is force men
and women to sit down and say,
'Oh, there are issues women still
struggle with.'"
