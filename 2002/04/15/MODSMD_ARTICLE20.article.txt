# Wild weekend adds to lore of historic rivalry
## 
### BRETT KAUFMAN STAFF COLUMNIST 
There were six errors and 19 men left on base.
There was a mistake-laden 10th inning and per
formances by an astounding 32 different players.
No, it wasn't exactly Barry Zito and Jason Young
thrilling the crowd with a spectacular pitcher's
duel in 1999, but it was still Stanford-USC at
Sunken Diamond on Friday night, and it left all in
volved saying "Wow."
On a perfect evening for baseball, the sec
ond-ranked Cardinal took a key game in the Pa
cific 10 Conference race without scoring many
style points. However, not one of the 3,001 in
attendance went home disappointed with what
they saw.
As the Cardinal players performed their post
game cleanup after the Cardinal's extra-inning, 6-
5 victory, a buzz reverberated off the deserted
seats at Sunken. Several fans milled around, not
wanting to let goof one ol the most
memorable endings in Stanford
baseball history. 1( was far from a
perfectly played game, but it of
fered precisely what the Cardinal
has provided consistently this sea
son, the kind of drama and emo
tional swings that keep you from
leaving your seat lor a hot dog
after (lie fifth inning.
Few exited Sunken Diamond
with Sam Fuld's game-winning
RBI as their most unforgettable
moment of the game. Hours after
ward, fans continued to discuss
two sequences that are now indeli
bly stamped on the storied history
of the Cardinal-Trojan rivalry.
Fhe first was the most anguish
ing pause of the ballgame for both
teams, coming in the Trojan 10th.
Bases loaded, two outs and an ab
solute truck of a human being in
first baseman Bill Peavey at the
plate. He'd been bombarded all
evening by hecklers lor his hefty
build and his dropped foul ball
earlier in the game, and he was
angry.
Sound the trumpets and start
the parade! Actual Stanford stu
dents showed up and made their
presence felt at Sunken!
Peavey unleashed that emotion
on a Ryan McCally pitch, sending
it into the stratosphere down the
right field line. It hung in the air
for an eternity — which explains
how it traveled more than 450 feet
— and all eyes shot toward first
base umpire Darrel Mason.
Was it fair or foul? l he sound

from the crowd as Mason threw his
arms toward foul territory was
hardly an excited roar; in fact, it
was more of a collective sigh of re
lief, like a sudden gasp after get
ling punched in the stomach. An
ensuing Peavey walk and then a
groundout capped the damage at
one run, setting the stage lor yet
another (lardinal comeback.
While the stadium echoed with
warranted superlative describing
Peavey's moon shot, foul by two
feet at most, it would be rocking
ten minutes later. Three"I can't
believe this!" moments came next:
a bungled lly ball to lelt to lead oil
the inning, an infield single, and a
wild throw to first on a dribbler to
ward the mound oil the end ol
Brian 11 all's bat that tied the game
at five.
McCally, the Cardinal pitcher,
swung a bat in t he on-deck circle as
Fuld stepped into the box. The
Stanford bench was vacant (head
coach Mark Marquess had already
used a pitcher to pinch run) and
the Cardinal lost its designated hit
ter due to several position changes
and substitutions.
So with a pivotal Pac-1() rivalry
game on the line, a pitcher would
hit with two outs and the bases
loaded ifT'uld failed to win it first.
On that wild Friday night, it
seemed the crowd almost expect
ed such unthinkable drama to de
cide the game.
Fuld's single doused those
thoughts, but maybe just for one
night. During a season of improb
able comebacks and wild excite
ment, don't bet against a pitcher's
game-winning RBI later on in yet
another "Wow" evening at
Sunken Diamond.
