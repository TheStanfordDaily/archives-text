With a convincing 3-1 win over
Southern California on Friday, and a
hardfought loss to top-ranked Pepper
dine on Saturday, the No. 7 Stanford
men should have boarded the plane
somewhat satisfied. However as the
post-season looms in the near future,
and the highly-touted Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation Tournament re
mains as the last realistic chance for the
Cardinal to qualify for the NCAA cham
pionships, the team couldn't help but
wish it could have pulled out the upset
over the Waves, and secured itself
home court advantage for the first
round of the conference tournament.
Instead, victims of a topsy-turvy sea
son, the Cardinal finished the season as
the No. 5 team in the MPSF, and will

square off against Brigham Young on
Saturday on the Cougars' home court.
Familiar players highlighted the
Cardinal stat sheet in its 3-1 loss to the
Waves on Saturday night.
Junior opposite Curt Toppel led the
way for Stanford, recording a match
high 24 kills in front of the 1,80(3 fans at
Firestone Fieldhouse.
Junior outside-hitter Billy Strick
land added 15 kills, while senior Mar
cus Skacel chipped in 10.
However the individual numbers

enough to overcome the defensive fire
power of Pepperdine. The Waves out
blocked Stanford by a devastating 24-5
margin.
The Waves narrowly won the first
game 30-28. Stanford came back to tie
the match, winning the second game in
a convincing 30-23 fashion.
However the top-ranked Pepper
dine squad wore down the Cardinal,
taking the third game, 30-28, before
burying Stanford 30-21 to close out the
evening.
Senior outside hitter Lance Walker
led the Waves with 22 kills, who with
the win secured a single-season record
25 wins.
The game came a little easier to the

Cardinal on Friday night, as Stanford
asserted its consistent hitting power
and calculated defense, to largely dom
inate the struggling Trojan squad.
After debuting in a 6-6 tie, the Car
dinal quickly gained speed, scoring
nine of the next 12 points before nab
bing the match point with a 30-18 win.
Building off the momentum, the team
continued its strong play, recording a
30-25 win in the second game.
However in the third game USC
showed just how tough the MPSF can
be, and as the No. 9 team in the confer

a 31-29 win.
But Stanford returned to the court
with concentration, scoring seven con
