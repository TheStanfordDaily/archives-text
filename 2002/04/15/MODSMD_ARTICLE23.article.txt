# Tiger masters domain at Augusta

### 
AUGUSTA, Georgia (AP) — One by one,
the best golfers in the world stepped aside.
It was Sunday at the Masters, and Tiger
Woods was in the lead.
"After the front nine, I knew it was all over
for me," U.S. Open champion Retief Goosen
said.
He wasn't alone.
Woods won his third green jacket by prov
ing he was far more daunting than a tough
ened up, redesigned Augusta National. Ile
seized control with an early burst of birdies
and watched his rivals crash in a desperate
and reckless attempt to catch him.
The result was another march into history,
with Woods becoming only the third player to
win back-to-back titles.
"I think we're going to wear this jacket out
putting it on you before your career is over,"
Augusta National chairman Hootie Johnson
said as he slipped the size 42 long over Woods'
shoulders.
It was Johnson who ordered the biggest
renovation in club history.
It was the 26-year-old Woods who wore
everyone out.
Phil Mickelson muttered through
clenched teeth when his par putt slipped
below the hole on No. 7. Ernie Els took a lone
ly walk through the trees left of the 13th fair
way, shoulders slumped and head down.
Vijay Singh covered his head with his hands
when his ball bounded into a creek on the
same hole.
Woods had the look of a champion all day.
He closed with a 1-under 71 to claim a
three-stroke victory over Goosen, who started,
the final round tied with Woods and spent
most of the day playing for second.
"You just know Tiger is not going to make
any big mistakes," Goosen said.
Woods walked up the 18th fairway in a
victory parade, tugging on the brim of his
cap to acknowledge the applause. When he
tapped in for par a score of 12-under 276,
he hugged his parents, both decked out in
red shirts —the color he wears for every
final round.
"It's awfully special," Woods said. "For
some reason, this seemed a little bit harder.
Maybe cause we played 26 holes yesterday.
I'm gettingjust a little bit older."
So is this storv line.

"We've been over this before," Thomas
Bjorn said when asked if anyone could catch
Woods. "This being the Masters, and him
being up there, it obviously puts you under a
bit of pressure."
Woods became the first player to repeat as
Masters champion since Nick Faldo in 1990.
Jack Nicklaus was the only other, in 1965-66,
and Woods' victory put him halfway to Nick
laus' mark of six Masters.
"(live him a couple of more years, and 1
think Tiger will be greater than even Jack
Nicklaus," Goosen said.
Last year, Woods battled Mickelson and
David Duval down the stretch to win the Mas
ters and become the first player to sweep the
four professional majors.
Another tight finish loomed, with six of the
top seven players in the world all poised to
win I he Masters. By the end of the day, they
were scratching their heads, trying to figure
out what they could do — if anything — to
tame Tiger.
"We were all trying to make something
happen to catch Tiger, because we knew he
wasn't going to falter," said Mickelson, who
closed with a 71 to finish third in fiis 39th
major. He is still regarded as the best to never
win one.
Els tried to make a charge, and wound up
with an 8 by hitting into the trees and into the
creek on the par-5 13th.
Singh, the former Masters and PGA cham
pion, got as close as two strokes before he hit
into a creek, into the crowd, into the trees.
That was before he reached No. 15, where it
really got ugly. Singh hit two wedges into the
water and made 9.
"That was the end of that," he said.
It was over long before.
"I was kind of surprised, no doubt about it,"
Woods said about no one making a run. "But
that doesn't deter me from my concentration."
Woods won his seventh professional
major, joining a list that includes Bobby Jones,
Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead and Arnold
Palmer, who made this Masters his 48th and
last.
Woods became only the third player since
the Masters began in 1934 to win a major four
years in a row. Nicklaus (1970-73) and Tom
Watson (1980-83) also did it.
More than anything, Woods reminded

people how tough he is in the final round. He
is 23-2 when he has at least a share of the 54-
hole lead.
Woods earned $ 1,008,000 for his 31st ca
reer victory, and he became the first two-time
winner on the PGA Tour this year.
Goosen didn't make a birdie until the 15th
hole, but moved into second when everyone
else fell apart. The South African closed with
a 74 and finished at 279.
"1 was asking one of the officials, do I get
the green pants for finishing second?" Goosen
said.
Two-time Masters champion Jose Maria
Olazabal started live strokes back and was
never in the hunt. He felt no pressure and
made no big mistakes, finishing with a 71 to
take fourth place at 281.
It was only the second time this year that
Woods failed to break 70 in the final round,
but Augusta National finally showed some
bite. Shigeki Maruyama of Japan had a 67 and
was the only player to break 70.
Mickelson, playing in the group in front of
Woods, made an early statement by hitting a
9-iron out of the fairway bunker into 14 inch
es on the first hole for birdie, then making an
other birdie on No. 2. Just like that, he was
only two strokes behind.
Els also birdied the first two holes, poised to
make a charge.
Then, poof]
Woods made them all disappear.
He pitched up the slope to 6 feet on No. 2
and made birdie, then spun back his ap
proach to 10 feet on No. 3 and made that for
another birdie.
Alter a bogey on No. 5, only his second in
44 holes, Woods was staring at another when
he went over the green on the par-3 sixth.
Would he buckle? No chance. Woods' chip
from 20 feet (6 meters) went straight into the
cup, and he raised his wedge in mild celebra
tion. There was no list pump, no smiles, just
another methodical day of work at the Mas
ters.
/Ml the emotion came from everyone else.
Even the best of the rest realized that Woods
wins most of his tournaments by letting every
one else fall apart.
"I tried," Els said. "We all tried."
Against Woods, especially at Augusta, that
isn't enough.
