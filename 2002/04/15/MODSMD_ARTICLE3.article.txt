# Borchardt to test the waters in NBA Draft
## 
### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
For the second time in two weeks, a Stanford men's
basketball player confirmed speculation and declared
for the NBA draft.
Junior Curtis Borchardt, a 7-foot, 240-pound cen
ter, declared his eligibility for the NBA Draft on Fri
day morning.
But like junior swingman Casey Jacobsen, Bor
chardt will use the NBA's "test the waters" policy by
not signing with an agent, leaving open the possi
bility that he would return to the Farm for his senior
season.
The final day to withdraw from the draft is June 19
and the draft is June 25.
Borchardt, who averaged 16.9 points, 11.4 re
bounds and 2.N blocks per - game and was a first-team
All-Pacific 10 Conference selection, has been project
ed as a first-round lottery pick.
"1 want to find out for myself and try out for NBA
teams," said Borchardt, who posted 17 double-dou
bles and set a single-season record in blocks with 85.
"1 don't want to rely on where people tell me I'm
going to be picked."
Borchardt's decision was influenced by a variety of
factors, which included bis past foot injuries and his
engagement to sophomore point guard Susan King.
"Realizing my dream to be in the NBA is a big fac
tor, and then there's Susan. It'd really be tough to
leave her fora year," Borchardt said. "We still need to
sit down and talk about what is best for us."
Borchardt added that his right foot, which under
went surgery twice in the past two years, feels fine, and
that he no longer thinks about it on a day-to-day basis.
"But your career can be over in a split second, so I
have to keep that in mind," he added.
Asa full-time student, Borchardt will probably not
participate in pre-NBA draft camps in Chicago. He
said that it would be convenient if NBA scouts came to
the Bay Area. Unlike |acobsen, he is continuing to
work in the off-season with (lie rest of the men's bas
ketball team.
Borchardt also verified that he would eventually
earn his degree if he left for the NBA.

"Whether it's taking courses in the summer or
whenever, I've always worked hard in school and it's
something I will try to get done. Getting my degree is
very important to me," said Borchardt, an American
studies major.
Borchardt ruled out the possibility of King
transferring to a different school in the < ity where
he is drafted.
"We don't think it'd be that good of a dec ision, be
cause she would have to sit out another season and I
could he traded," Borc hardt said.
