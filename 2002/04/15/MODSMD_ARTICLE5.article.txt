# GSC candidates stress housing, student life
## 
### MIKEY LEE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Tuesday and Wednesday's ASSU
election includes 15 spots for Graduate
Student Council representatives. The
major issues that candidates plan to ad
dress this year include housing, health
care, and student life.
According to GSC Chair Filipe

Santos, a doctoral
candidate in man
agement, science
& engineering,
quality of life in
housing is one of

the most important issues for this
year's representatives.
"We are looking to provide every stu
dent with affordable housing," Santos
said. "We also want stability in housing.
We don't want students going through a
housing lottery and have to move from
year to year.
"We'd like to allow them to be
able to renew their assignments.
There are many students with furni
ture, children and other things that
make it inconvenient to have to
move every year."
Health care for graduate students has
stabilized after council members met with
University officials (see story below), but
it is still a large concern, said Ray Rivera,
the GSC financial officer and a doctoral
candidate in the School of Education.
"The University has made a major
commitment to graduate student fam
ilies to provide subsidies," Rivera said.
"We're very pleased that it is respond
ing to this crucial need. We feel that

this move will keep Stanford very at
tractive in the competitive context of
graduate school selection."
Rivera said he hopes the University
will continue to care about the situation.
"We would like to see this continue
with increased subsidies in the com
ing years and we'd also like the addi
tion of dental and vision coverage,
which the current plan does not
have," Rivera said. "Families with de
pendents are among the most finan
cially vulnerable."
fhe GSC hopes that candidates will
also seek to improve graduate social life
on campus.
"We want people to go beyond their
own departments and connect with
people from other departments," said
Santos. "We want them to be active in
the community. It's easy to meet people
in within [one's] department, but we
want people to be able to have events
and social gatherings between depart
ments. We hope this will facilitate hav
ing discussions."
The current GSC has made an
large effort to raise awareness of the
elections among graduate students,
said Santos.
"We also made sure that all executive
slates are aware of the issues and concerns
of the graduate population," he Santos.
"We are happy to see that many of them
have incorporated some of the key issues
in their campaigns and we are encour
aged by the caliber of candidates for both
the GSC and the executive slates."
At press dine, there were 19 candi
dates vying for 15 GSC spots. The dead
line to turn in an application is today.
