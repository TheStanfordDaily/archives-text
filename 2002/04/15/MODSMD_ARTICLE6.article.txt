## Some students will receive a 50 percent subsidy for Cardinal Care premiums 
### ANNA GALÁN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Following (he escalation of rates by private health
insurance carriers, a new University subsidy on grad
uate student health care will begin Sept. 1 of this year,
University officials announced last week. Approxi
mately 4,000 graduate students will be eligible for the

highest subsidy, for which the University will pay up
to half the cost of premiums for graduate students
and nearly hall for their dependents.
"Providing affordable health insurance to students
ranks among the biggest challenges we face," said
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Gene Awakuni. "We
are entirely at the mercy of the health care industry.
We have no control over the dramatic rise in health
care costs that has occurred over the past few years,
yet we must still offer health insurance to students
who can't find coverage elsewhere."
On Sept. 1, the cost of Cardinal Care fora single
student will rise from $243 per
quarter to $.'M)B per quarter.
About 38 percent of under
graduate students and 77 per
cent of graduate students are
currently enrolled in Cardinal
Care, which is a plan created for
the Stanford student communi
ty. It provides access to Stanford
physicians at Cowell Student
Health Center. The remaining
students have health plans other
than Cardinal Care.
For graduate students who are
eligible for the full subsidy, the cost

for Cardinal (>are will be $ 180 per
quarter, with the University pro
viding a $188 subsidy.
Graduate students employed as
research and teaching assistants
with at least 25 percent time ap
pointments and students on fellow
ships who receive sdpend payments
of at least $2,000 per quarter will be
eligible lor the highest subsidies.
Other graduate students will also be
eligible lor lower subsidies.
Directly helping students pay
fora portion of the cost of health
insurance is a new approach for
the University to take, said Provost
John Etchemendy.
"We know that health insur
ance is an expensive necessity,
and difficult to afford on a grad

uate student stipend," he said.
" The new benefit will make in
surance more affordable for
these students."
The subsidies will also help
graduate students who use Cardi
nal Care to cover their spouses and
dependents.
"Dependent health insurance
for students' families is extraordi
narily expensive," said Dr. Ira
Friedman, director of the Cowell
Student Health Service.
The rate fora student and
spouse is $1,370 per quarter, and
for students receiving the lull sub
sidy, that rate will drop to $732 per
quarter. The rate falls from $2,114
to $ 1,026 fora student, spouse and
one child, and from $2,711 to

$1,173 fora student, spouse and
two or more children.
The program will cost the Uni
versity between $3 million and
$3.5 million yearly, said Steve
Olson, a financial analyst in the
budget ollice. The funds will come
from a new benefits rate, expected
to be between 3 and 4 percent if
approved by the federal govern
ment, that will be applied to re
search and teaching assistanlships,
said Olson.
Cynthia Hartley, director of
planning and policy analysis for
the Financial Aid Office, said that
for undergraduate students, the
cost of health care will continue
to be figured into their financial
aid packages.
