as starting lo develop its own Sili
con Valley subculture. He said
that two tilings have allowed lor
this shift: a combination of more
well-educated engineers in India,
and mote Indians gaining valu
able experience working at
American companies in India like
Texas Instruments. Many Indi

ans worked there during the past
10 years and then started their
own companies.

master's in engineering economic
systems in 1995, and is now presi
dent and chief technical officer at

country expected to double its
|(»I)P] in 10 years." Koo said.
"China is really an exciting place to
he. Where delegations from China
used to come to learn about Silicon

Valley, delegations now are coin
ing ... to recruit talent."
The panelists also discussed how
a small company can develop cross-
Pacific ties.
"Know yourself and know your
| international | partner," Koo said.
"(Cross-Pac ilic alliances] are very re
source-intensive, may take a lot of
time ... and cilia t."

In a dinner event at Ming's
Restaurant in Palo Alto on Satur
day, a panel of industry leaders, in
cluding 1 lot mail co-founder Sabeer
Bhatia, discussed the future of cross-
Pacific business opportunities in the
technology arena.
The event was sponsored by two
Stanford student groups, the Stan
ford Asian Technology Group (for
merly the' Stanford Society of Asian
American Engineers) and the Asia-
Pacific: Student Entrepreneurship
Society, as well as a non-Stanford
group, the Asian American Multi-
I "eel l nol( )gy Ass< k i; it i< >n.
Bhatia, who graduated with a
master's in electrical engineering
from Stanford in 1993, said that the
key to success in Asia is putting tal
ented people together in one place.
"Primarily, one of the ingredi
ents for success iu the [Silicon]
Valley is a pool of talented indi
viduals. You need the light people
for creating a new company,"
Bhatia said, referring to Stanford
and UG-Berkeley.
Bhatia also said that the spirit of
Silicon Valley helped him succeed.
" The happiest time in my life

was when somebody gave us
$300,000," Bhatia said. "We were
27-year-olds. This is the real power
of Silic on Valley. Venture capitalists
gave us fmoney) for us to pursue
our dream."

Hhatia said that lie sees India
as starting lo develop its own Sili
con Valley subculture. He said
that two tilings have allowed lor
this shift: a combination of more
well-educated engineers in India,
and mote Indians gaining valu
able experience working at
American companies in India like
Texas Instruments. Many Indi

ans worked there during the past
10 years and then started their
own companies.
Min Zhu, who graduated with a
master's in engineering economic
systems in 1995, and is now presi
dent and chief technical officer at
Web Ex Communications, partici
pated in the panel. I le said he was
optimistic about the future of cross-
Pacific business as it relates to the
high-tech industry.
.According to Zhu, for example,
companies now have American en
gineers write computer c< xledui ing

between the United States and

China, engineers in China lesi the

Ceorge koo, the third panelist
and director ol Chinese Services

that lie sees the technology sector in
China as starting to mature.
"China is now the only trillion
dollar |gross domestic product|
country expected to double its
|(»I)P] in 10 years." Koo said.
"China is really an exciting place to
he. Where delegations from China
used to come to learn about Silicon

Valley, delegations now are coin
ing ... to recruit talent."
The panelists also discussed how
a small company can develop cross-
Pacific ties.
"Know yourself and know your
| international | partner," Koo said.
"(Cross-Pac ilic alliances] are very re
source-intensive, may take a lot of
time ... and cilia t."
/hu agreed that setting up shop
in both ('hina and the I Initecl States
takes a lot of work.
"(lultural dillercnces is very <lil l i

get one market. Cct some market
|sharc|, get more money, then go

overseas. Don't go to lx»th plates (at

Yu-knan I.in, a senior and the
president of the Stanford Asian
Technology Group, said that of
the approximately 100 people
who attended (lie dinner, about
