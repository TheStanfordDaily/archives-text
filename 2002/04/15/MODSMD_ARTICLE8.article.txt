### 
CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Triumphant yet
chastened. President Hugo Chavez returned to oil ice
on the wings of a popular uprising two days alter lit- was
ousted and arrested by Venezuela's military, saying yes
terday that he has reflec ted on his mistakes and was pre
pared to "make corrections."
"I do not come with hate or rancor in my heart, but
we must make dec isions and adjust things," (lhavez said
at dawn yesterday, moments alter landing by helicopter
at the presidential palace, which was surrounded by
tens of thousands cheering his return.
Late yesterday, Chavez, returned to familiar haven:
the 42nd parachutist brigade base where he trained as
an elite paratrooper. Base commander Gen. Jorge
Baduel rebelled against Chavez's ouster Saturday, fuel
ing popular protests to demand his return.
Most opposition leaders — who days ago relentless
ly crammed the airwaves with criticism of Chavez.—
stayed out of the spotlight yesterday.
Chavez was ousted early Friday by his military high
command, which claimed he had resigned under
pressure after gunmen opened lire on opposition pro
testers Thursday. Sixteen people were reported killed
in that demonstration.

Military commanders accused him of ordering the
gunmen to shoot at protesters, but Chavez said the
shooters were plainclothes policemen linked to his op
ponents. Authorities pledged an investigation into the
events that precipitated Chavez's ouster.
A report released by two local human rights groups,
COFAVIC and the Archdiocese of Caracas Human
Rights Vicar, said 23 people were killed Saturday, and
accused security forces of being behind most of the
killings. Witnesses have said police opened fire on pro-
Chavez demonstrators in several poor neighborhoods
of Carac as on Saturday.
In all, about 40 people are known to have been slain
during the upheaval that followed Chavez's ouster.
Venezuelans tried to make sense of the dizzying,
bloody sequence of events that led to Chavez's briel
overthrow and stunning return. Never before has an
elected president been overthrown by military com
manders, his successor inaugurated, and then the
ousted leader returned to power on the wings of a
popular uprising.
Pedro Carmona, an economist and business leader,
was sworn in as interim president on Friday, only to re
sign a clay later amid widespread street protests.
