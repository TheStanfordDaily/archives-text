()iu* in five ol us suffers from ai least
one allergy. Allergies are basically the im
mune system's response to a substance
that is not really dangerous.
Ihe average pet son spends $ 120 a year
to suppress symptoms of allergy, which in
clude sore throat, red, swollen eyes, in
ilamed nasal passages and dripping nose.
Immunotherapy can help

more serious cases but
requires as many as

100 shots through
large needles, thus
creating stress for
the body.

An alternate solu-

tion is to develop tolerance

by placing drops of allergen under
the patient s tongue. Mainstream medi
cine has been slow to embrace the idea, but
recent studies are providing supporting
evidence. One controlled trial found the
tongue method was as effective as shots
and better accepted by patients. In an in
ternational allergy conference last No
vember, experts cautiously backed sublin
gual therapy for patients who did not re
spond well to shots.

Doctors attending the American Col
lege of Cardiology meeting lasi month
presented data revealing different
forms of fat deposits and risks towards
heart attack.
Doctors now recognize two types of
plaque: hard and soft. Hard plaques are
the traditional fatty deposits that accumu
late in a vessel and block il. Soft types are
more prone to rupturing and have a dif
ferent mechanism: they usually do not
bulge tar into the vessel's inner mem
brane, but their rupturing can trigger a
clot that then blocks blood flow. Deposits
in the coronary arteries (coming from the
heart) are a prime example of these vul
nerable plaques.
Researchers are currently experi
menting how to make such plaques
more stable,. focusing on cholesterol
lowering drugs. Leading a healthy
lifestyle, low in fats and without smok
ing, is still good prevention.
Karl Hostetler and colleagues at UC-
San Diego announced that they devel
oped a better vaccine against smallpox.
The researchers cloaked an antiviral drug
in a fat molecule, allowing it to enter the
smallpox virus at a greater concentration.
The product did not create the side effects
of current smallpox medications.
Smallpox has generated renewed inter
est because of its potential for biological
warfare. The last cases of smallpox were
reported about 20 years ago, and govern
ments have since then stopped public in

ex illations. Smallpox used to be a scourge
of public health in the 1 St hand 19th cen
tury, until Edward Jenner discovered that
inculcating a person with the milder cow
pox could prevent smallpox.
Gravitational waves occur when cata
clysmic events such as black-hole collisions
cause the fabric of space to vibrate. Ein
stein first proposed the idea in his theory
of relativity, but to date no one has ob
served it.

Six ultra-precise
interferometers
have recently

been set around
the world to ob
serve gravitation-

al waves, with initial

observations scheduled

for this year. I he detectors use
photos to measure the slightest distur
bance in space-time. The sensors mostly
detect terrestrial noise, which must be fil
tered by computers.
Proponents believe that observing
gravity waves will give new insights on the
nature of the universe. However, oppo
nents claim that the $365 million object is
a waste of funds that could be used in more
popular projects.

A joint project between the American
and Canadian space agencies has mapped
all of Antarctica with a radar satellite for
the first time.
The surprising discovery, announced
at the end of March, is that Antarctica's
massive ice sheets are more active than
previously thought. Twisted patterns of
ice move from the center outward, like
rivers. Near the coasts huge icebergs
crumble underwater, and others take
their place.
This renewed view promises to an
swer important questions about global
environment and reveal some unknown
facts about (he Earth's southern pole.
Antarctica was once a tropical land, as
fossils unearthed in the past years have
shown. Continental drift caused it to
shift southward, draping it in a cloak of
frozen ice.
IBM recently gave the first demonstra
tion of its Xperanto system. The project
uses a combination of technologies to
allow people to conduct better database
searchers.
One of the technologies is XML, a
markup language similar to HTML. An
other technology is XQuery, a proposed
standard language for finding informa
tion in XML-based documents.
The goal is to find and access data
stored anywhere on a network, easily and
quickly. IBM faces competition from Mi
crosoft's SQL and Oracle, which currently
dominates the database market.
