"How I Write" is a series of conversations with faculty and other advanced writers to
explore the nuts and holts, pleasures and pains, of all types of writing, while content
is always an issue, the conversation will primarily focus on worlc styles, such as where,
when, and how a writer composes, allowing us to examine habits, idiosyncrasies, tech
niques, trade secrets, hidden anxieties, and delights. We will discuss how a writer gen
erates ideas, sustains large-scale projects, combines research with composition, over
comes various impediments and bloclcs, and cultivates stylistic innovations. Writing com
munities share experiences (even had ones), so that all writers can learn and grow, and
Stanford is an exceptionally rich community for gaining such insights.
