Historically, coffee has provided significant employment and exports for several Latin American
nations. Over the past year, thousands of coffee farmers have lost their jobs and many farms have
closed due to the current decline in global coffee prices. Sustainable coffee, however, which gar
ners a higher purchase price than regular coffee and includes fair trade, shade grown, & organ
ic coffee, has prospered. Sustainable coffee, especially shade grown coffee, has also been shown
to improve habitat for avian species and is considered an environmentally-friendly product. This
conference will explore the opportunities and obstacles facing the sustainable coffee market at
both production and roaster/retailer levels. It will examine the economic impact of sustainable
coffee on Latin American farmers and the economic viability of sustainable coffee in the US
market.
Free and open to all.
Co-sponsored by Stanfair: Stanford students for fair trade.
