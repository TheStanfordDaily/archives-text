National campaign possible
for avocados
VEN' 1 U RA, ('.alii. (AP) — Avocados may be getting a na
tional ad campaign.
Growers vote this summer on whether to tax themselves
to raise up to $14 million a year for research and promotion,
a campaign that could do for avocados what the "Got Milk?"
ad blitz did for the dairy industry. Some 6,000 growers and
importers will be eligible to vote.
"We've got a good product, and we want to do what we
can to increase demand," said Roger Essick, who farms 200
acres of avocados in Ojai and Fillmore and serves on the
board of directors of the California Avocado Commission.
"If we can get people in the rest of the country eating av
ocados like they do out West, 1 think it will be money well
spent," Essick said.
A 2 1/2 cents a pound assessment would be levied if ap
proved during the voting period June 24 to July 12. If ap
proved, the U.S. Department of Agriculture would assem
ble a national board to set policy for the research and pro
motional effort.
