1959
On April 16, 1959, The Daily printed an
editorial about the benefits of moving the
Greek rush period to the week before rushees
begin their sophomore year.
"There are many arguments for and
against pre-sophomore year rushing;
when they are all considered, we feel the
benefits far outweigh the disadvantages of
such a system and we urge the program's
adoption.
"A chief difficulty with such a program
would be the housing of students who go
through the rush period but don't pledge.
Their number would have to be estimated
and sufficient space held for them in the in
dependent men's houses. Experience with
this rushing system should make estimating
relatively easy.
"The shortening of the length of time a
person would be affiliated with a house or
club is also given as an argument opposing
such a rush program. While this is true, it
might be pointed out that the length of time
a man would live in the house would be the
same as under the present system.
"Presently, any effective freshman pro
grain ends when freshmen pledge a house or
club. It is argued that if a separate program
for freshmen is worth having, it is worth hav
ing for the entire year.
"Pre-sophomore year rushing would also
lessen the likelihood that freshmen would be
dirty rushed â€” at least until they had adjust
ed to the University.
"If fraternities and clubs had just selected
their pledge classes during the week before
autumn quarter started, they would be so
busy orienting these sophomores that they
wouldn't have time or interest to bother the
freshmen.
Bottom Line: The University hasn't been in much of a
rush to change things.
