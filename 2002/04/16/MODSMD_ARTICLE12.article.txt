## 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Secretary of State
(lolin Powell yesterday embraced the idea of an
international conference aimed at stopping
Middle East violence and restarting Israeli-
Palestinian peace negotiations.
Separately, President (ieorge W. Bush wel
comed Israel's announced intention to with
draw troops from two Palestinian areas as "a
positive development," even though it was tar
from the complete pullout Bush wanted.
Sidestepping a clash with Israeli Prime Min
ister Ariel Sharon, who wants to exclude Pales
tinian leader Yasser Arafat from any peace con
ference, Powell said the meeting might be held
at the foreign minister level.
But European and Arab leaders said any
such conference needs Arafat's presence to
be effective.
"It's a way to get the parties together and
talking," Powell said on the ninth day of a
peace mission that has made little progress
so far.
Pressing on, Powell will meet fora third time
with Sharon today and is making arrangements
to visit Arafat fora second time Wednesday in
his battered Ramallah headquarters.
Palestinian officials said they are working on
a joint statement with the United States that
would include a stiff condemnation of suicide
bomb attacks and a ( all for Israel to pull out of

Palestinian controlled areas.
The two sides began putting the document
together during talks yesterday. A copy of the
first draft, obtained by The Associated Press,
shows that Palestinians want to include a call for
international observers and further U.N. Secu
rity Council action.
Bush, who hasn't spoken with Arafat, called
Sharon yesterday.
In their 15-minute conversation, Sharon
told Bush Israeli troops would pull out ofjenin
and Nablus within a week, White House
spokesman Ari Eleischer said. Sharon, in a
CNN interview, said Israeli forces would re
main indefinitely in Ramallah, where they sur
round Arafat's headquarters, and in Bethle
hem until terrorists surrender.
Bush told Sharon that ending the siege at
the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem was
one of Powell's most urgent priorities, Eleis
cher said.
"The Church of Nativity problem has got to
get resolved. That's one of the things that Sec
retary Powell is working very hard on right
now," said Fleischer, who is traveling with
Bush in lowa.
At a fund-raising dinner in lowa, Bush said
he was proud of Powell's peacemaking efforts.
"We're willing to work for peace in regions
of the world where some may say peace never

has a chance," he said.
Powell said the United States would not nec
essarily host such a conference and that Arafat
could send high-level Palestinian officials to
represent him if talks were held at the foreign
minister level.
"We've got to move quickly to a political
track and there are many ways to do that and
one way is with a regional or international con
ference," Powell said.
Powell said he did not broach the idea of
who would attend a conference except that rep
resentatives of both sides would be there. He
said of Arafat, "It doesn't necessarily require his
presence to get started."
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi en
dorsed a conference, saying such a gathering
must include the United States, the European
Union and the Arab League as well as Israel
and the Palestinians.
French President Jacques Chirac said a con
ference could be a "new road leading us in the
right direction." But Prime Minister Uionel
Jospin warned that the conference wouldn't
make sense if it excluded Arafat.
So far, Powell has been stymied on his trip by
both sides. Sharon refused to promise a
timetable to withdraw troops from the West
Bank, and Powell could not win an uncondition
al pledge from Arafat to bring violence down.
