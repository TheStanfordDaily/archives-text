CHICAGO (AP) — A panel formed after
Gov. George Ryan halted executions two
years ago recommended changes yesterday
aimed at keeping innocent people oil death
row, including videotaped police interroga
tions, a DNA database, and a ban on executing
defendants convicted on testimony from a sin
gle eyewitness.
The panel did not call for an end to capital
punishment, but a narrow majority of the 14
commission members said it should end be
cause changes could not guarantee that inno
cent people would not be executed.
"The message from this report is clear. Repair
or repeal. Fix the capital punishment system or
abolish it," said Thomas Sullivan, a former U.S.
attorney and co-chairman of the panel.
The panel's report contains 85 recommen

dations. The panel said it would be up to law
makers to make the recommended changes,
and acknowledged they would be costly.
But the panel said the changes would "an
swer the governor's call to enhance significant
ly the fairness, justice and accuracy of capital
punishment in Illinois."
The report recommends cutting the 20 cir
cumstances that warrant the death penalty to
five: murdering more than one victim, killing a
police officer or firefighter, killing an officer or
inmate in a correctional institution, murdering
to obstruct justice or torturing the victim.
The panel also recommended banning the
death penalty for mentally retarded defen
dants and defendants convicted solely on testi
mony from a single eyewitness, informer or ac
complice. The report also recommends creat

ing a statewide DNA database and independent
forensics lab.
fhe governor said he would study the re
port and discuss it with panelists.
"I'm not going to act in haste; I'm going to
deliberate," Ryan said.
Ryan's moratorium on executions prompt
ed other states to review their procedures.
About 3,700 people await death for crimes com
mitted in the 38 states that allow the death
penalty.
"Many states and national leaders will look
to see the recommendations that Illinois comes
up with as a model for what else needs to be
done in other states," said Richard Dieter, di
rector of the Death Penalty Information Center
in Washington, D.C., which researches capital
punishment.
