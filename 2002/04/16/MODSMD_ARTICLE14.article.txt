## The 						Stanford Daily Make your voice heard: vote in the election 
### 
Published Since 1891

It's April, and that means that ASSU elec
tions are rolling around once again.
Sure, some people are disillusioned
about the ASSU. Perhaps they feel that
all the campaign flyers are a waste of paper or
perhaps they feel that the ASSU does not rep
resent them effectively. We encourage students
to put aside those feelings of apathy — the
ASSU does tangible things for students and
student groups and this year's election could
take next year's ASSU in one of several direc
tions, depending on the results.
Most important to cast are votes for the pres
idential and vice-presidential slates. Of the five
slates, three are veiy strong and each has
pledged to take the ASSU down a different

path next year, with different priorities and
programs. Undergraduates and graduate stu
dents alike should weigh the pros and cons of
each slate and balance those ideas with what is
best for them individually and for Stanford as
a whole. We have chosen the direction that we
feel is best (see page B7) but we encourage you
to think this over for yourself.
Also important are the votes for the special-fee
slates. Fifty-two groups, including The Daily, are
asking students for special fees this year. These
groups run the gamut, from music groups to
club sports to legal counseling. We urge you to
vote seriously and carefully for each group. The
Daily has made its recommendations about
which groups are most deserving (see pages B7

through B9). The ballot does look intimidating
with 52 slots. But the results of your vote will ap
pear next year in the "ASSU Fees" spot on your
University bill and in the presence — or non
presence — of many student groups on campus.
Finally, your votes for the Undergraduate
Senate or the Graduate Student Council also
matter. Although the procedure is somewhat
cumbersome — undergraduates vote for 15
candidates, for example — the result is impor
tant. The Senate and the GSC make impor
tant, often behind-the-scenes funding and pol
icy decisions that can buoy or cripple smaller
student groups or other student initiatives. Al
though the ASSU executives are most visible,
the legislative bodies are also important.

Taken together, these executives, legislators
and student groups represent the student body
at Stanford to the rest of the University and the
outside world. Although some may see the
ASSU as ineffective, it is still the best medium for
transmitting "student voice" and its actions can
be extremely powerful. A strong ASSU will lead
to a stronger student presence on campus; why
should students be given any say in important
University issues when they cannot even be
bothered to care about important student is
sues? Exercise control over your Stanford expe
rience and cast a vote today or tomorrow.
