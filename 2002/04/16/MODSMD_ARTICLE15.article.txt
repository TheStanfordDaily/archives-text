# SHOOTING FROM THE HIP
## Democracy ASSU-style 
### 
Ah, Election Day. The day where
we reaffirm democracy here at
Stanford, and usher in a new
crop of fresh-faced politicos to
run the ASSU. Today marks the end of a
spirited, entertaining presidential cam
paign, and I would like to heartily ap
plaud all five slates for their efforts.
That being said, there has been one cam
paign tactic that I find a little off the mark.
Virtually every slate gleefully tore into the
ASSU like wild dogs into a sirloin. To listen
to them talk, the ASSU is some kind of

aloof, secret cabal, which
ignores student concerns
and fails to stand up for
student issues. All the can
didates promise to reform
the ASSU, bring student
voice into the ASSU, and
make .ASSU dealings ac*
cessible to the public.
They vow to prevent fii-

ture instances of Munich-style appease
ment, such as the ASSU's passivity in letting
frats and theme houses annex prime real
estate on the Row.
Some of these criticisms might be war
ranted. But it is a little ironic when candi
dates rip on the ASSU for being unrepre
sentative of the student body and divorced
from student concerns. Because the truth
of the matter is, the structure of ASSU
elections and the ASSU itself is incredibly
democratic. In fact, the ASSU could teach
our national government a few things
about being of, by and for the people.
For starters, the ASSU has adopted a
novel procedure by which the winning
presidential candidate is the candidate
that gets the most votes. By contrast, the
arcane Electoral College selects U.S.
Presidents, and a candidate can realisti
cally lose the popular vote and still win
the Presidency.
Not only is the Electoral College un
fair, it's also needlessly confusing. Just
imagine if the ASSU was saddled with
such an awkward system. Instead of
speaking to the student body at large,
you 'd have candidates attempting to woo
over specific areas of campus, fretting
about whether they could "pick up"
Suites while still "holding on" to Toyon.
Secondly, each student has equal
power when it comes to electing the Un
dergraduate Senate. In other words, my
vote is just as important as anyone else's
vote. Unfortunately, the same cannot be
said for the U.S. Senate. For example, I
have the distinct misfortune of being
from California, which means I am one
of about 30 million voters who are eligi
ble to elect California's two senators. By
contrast, a friend of mine from Montana
is one of less than a million eligible voters
in that state. So, when it comes to elect
ing U.S. Senators, he's over 30 times
more important than I. This is hardly an
equitable or democratic situation.
Thirdly, the ASSU has the remarkably
good sense to conduct its voting via com
puter. Ibis eliminates the hanging, swing
ing, dimpled, pregnant, elderly, crippled
and otherwise quirky chads that became

so infamous in the 2000 presidential elec
tion. In ASSU elections, no one's vote will
be uncounted because of the peculiar me
chanics of little pieces of paper.
Finally, the "instant runoff" feature of
ASSU elections allows for multiple viable
candidates, and prevents the kind of
two-party stranglehold that exists in our
national elections. For example, suppose
1 really like the Chappie slate for ASSU
president and vice-president, but I don't
think they have a realistic chance of win
ning. Under ASSU rules, I can still vote
for them without worrying about throw
ing my vote away. I simply put my pre
ferred "serious" slate as my second
choice, and if the Chappie slate is elimi
nated, my votes are automatically redis
tributed to that backup slate.
Imagine if we had this procedure on
the national level. In the last election, a
liberal voter could have voted for Nader,
put Core second, and not worried about
indirectly electing Bush to the White
House. In other words, minor parties
can flourish, because their support
doesn't impinge of the support for the
two major parties.
In the name of democracy, I propose
that we send an ASSU delegation to
Washington, to educate those backward,
uncivilized politicians on the way to set
up a proper representative government.
While they're over there, they could
also give our elected leaders a few tips on
how to spice up their campaigns. I'm
sure national voter turnout would be
higher if Congressmen took a page from
their ASSU counterparts and adorned
their campaign posters with a brooding,
chiseled Calvin Klein model or a scowl
ing Bobby Knight. And I have yet to
meet a national politician who has har
nessed the awesome advertising power
of chalk as a campaign tool.
Even when it comes to debates, ASSU
campaigns win hands down over the
dreary national affairs. Last Thursday's
debate in the Coffee House was a rollick
ing, no-holds-barred example of repre
sentative politics at its best. The crowd
featured hecklers and cheerleaders, stu
dents went up on stage to seize the mi
crophone, and candidate speeches
ranged from animated policy discourses
to football-lobbing demagoguery.
It was not the prettiest affair, but seri
ous issues were debated and the audi
ence was entertained at the same time.
In many national debates, neither of
these goals is met.
So when you cast your vote today, do
it with pride. Know that you are sup
porting a great democratic institution, a
far purer system then the shoddy affair
we keep in Washington. We may not
have the biggest government in this
great land of ours, hut damned if we
don't have one of the best.
