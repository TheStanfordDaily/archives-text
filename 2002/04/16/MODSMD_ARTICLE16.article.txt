Undergraduate Senators
respond to Benson / Arimoto
As students with ASSU knowledge
and Student Advocacy experience, we
believe it necessary to clarify the miscon
ceptions about the Student Advocacy
Committee that the Benson / Arimoto
presidential slate is advertising.
Like the United States, the ASSU sep
arates the legislative and executive
branches; while the vice-president is au
thorized to break ties regarding the Sen
ate's overall decisions, neither the Presi
dent nor the vice-president have power
over the individual committees within
the Senate.
The published ideas of the
Benson/Arimoto campaign regarding
ASSU reform are thereby inconsistent
with the ASSU Constitution, and the re
forms the two are proposing have al
ready been made.
As opposed to a mere "one-sentence
resolution" which the Benson/Arimoto
campaign is asserting, our committee's af
firmative action resolution was actually
substantially rearticulated and expanded.
Indeed, recognizing the need fora clear
er resolution protocol, the Senate met on
Dec. 2 to create a new one, which requires
that the author of a resolution must in
clude a substantial amount of information
— including background, arguments and
counter-arguments, and a Constitutional
analysis — before the Senate will even
consider it.
Details of the discussions leading up
to this policy are available under the
meeting minutes on the ASSU Web site,
as well as at assu.stanford.edu/an
nouncements. All the resolutions the
Senate has since passed have followed
the new guidelines.
If any presidential slates want to re
form the Student Advocacy Committee,
they should run for the Senate.

ASSU Undergraduate Senators

Undergraduate Senate is
an effective body
The ASSU has been accused of a lack of
communication with the students by just
about everyone. This, to some extent, is a
very valid assertion, and is probably the
reason why so many candidates and stu
dents are making ignorant assertions. So,
as a Senator, I am going to communicate
with you now.
There have been entirely too many
misrepresentations and misunderstand
ings of what the ASSU and specifically the
senate has done this year. The Senate has
worked incredibly hard to fix many of the
inefficiencies of the body. To name only a
few, there are now codified policies for
funding, a protocol for writing resolu
tions, an entirely revamped Web site, a
more extensive orientation for the sena
tors, and individual committee archives
that will be handed on to the next senate.

The second thing to realize is that the
Advocacy Committee is in only its second
year of existence, and really its first year of
real activity advocating for students. We
have had a number of gr owing pains over
the year, learning how exactly to do the job.
Knowing how to find the issues that af
fect students and how to effectively support
and push for them, which are each unique,
is difficult and tricky. This required learn
ing the way in which the University oper
ates in itself. None of these things are mag
ically learned, and none of them were pre
sented before us. They were all things that
we had to learn over the course of the year.
The knowledge that we have collected,
the contacts we have made, and lessons we
have learned, have culminated in the
Latin American Studies resolution and the
Campaign for Accountability, which has
not yet been largely advertised since it was
the final project of our time in office and is
still largely a work in progress.
In writing the Latin American Studies
resolution, we worked closely with the
student representatives to the Faculty
Senate Committee for Undergraduate
Studies and with the students fighting to
save the program. Together we identi
fied three areas for improvement which
have been commented on as being very
constructive and useful by the deans of
Humanities and Sciences.
Third, the Faculty Diversity Task
Force came out of the Senate, not the ex
ecutive branch; despite what slates and
students have asserted. The NAACP has
done a great deal of the work that has
gone into this difficult issue, along with a
number of other students that have given
of their valuable time.
Fhe current president and vice-presi
dent of the ASSU have been extremely sup
portive, and Matt Brewer has given much
of his time to the task force, but it is an insult
to the students who have worked on the
committee to be so consistently ignored.
The Faculty Diversity Task Force was a
campaign promise by a senator, namely
myself, that came to fruition. Senators do
run on issues and do live up to them.
Fourth, student communication is a
two-way street. Students talk about "com
munication," not lecturing, which is what
I am doing now.
We have received three comments all
year. We have practically begged for com
ments this year at each of the three ASSU
outreach events in White Plaza. The new
Web site has a feedback button and all of
the senators' e-mail addresses are listed.
Two people have used it.
As far as outreach, we need to do a lot
more, but there was a Stanford Daily beat
writer at every Senate meeting and an ar
ticle in the Daily every Thursday. We an
nounced every meeting and the agenda
on the RA lists. Brewer and Vice-Presi
dent Christine Cordero put out an ASSU
newsletter and we sought student input
on the WRC issue through e-mail.
The Senate has a huge task to perform
and it is not always clear how to pursue it.
This is especially true for young groups
such as the Advocacy Committee. The work
that is necessary to make the Senate the
body it needs to be is huge, and will not be
fully accomplished in any one year, espe
cially with such a quick turnover.

This year's Senate did an incredible
amount of work and without any recogni
tion and most without pay. There is much
more that the Senate has done that cannot
be encapsulated in this letter, but none of
the Senators this year deserve some of the
irresponsible and ignorant criticisms that
have gone on during this campaign.

Benson / Arimoto respond
to Undergraduate Senators
In a single meeting last November, the
Undergraduate Senate passed resolutions
from the Advocacy Committee endorsing
Stanford's "labor justice campaign" and, in
recognizing global warming as a "pressing
problem," calling on Stanford to obtain 25
percent of its energy from solar power by
2010. We'll let the readers decide whether
that was the best use of the Senate's time
and resources — especially when student
groups are being summarily put on proba
tion, our Board of Trustees lacks under
graduate or graduate representation, and
community centers are facing temporary
eviction from Old Union next year. In
deed, it's this type of behavior that has
caused the student body to become so disil
lusioned with the ASSU —and its why
we're committed to reforming student gov
ernment and the role of advocacy within it.
Specifically, we intend to work with the
incoming Senate to ensure that the Advoca
cy Committee does real work for all students
— something their new protocol doesn't ad
dress at all. As for the idea of ASSU Consti
tutional restrictions on our proposals: sug
gesting that the ASSU Executives have no
power to direct Senate business is like saying
President Bush can't get a tax cut plan
passed because he has no authority to intro
duce legislation to Congress. As ASSU Exec
utives, we'll work with allies in the incoming
Senate to make these changes — and in
talking with almost everyone currendy run
ning for Senate, we know a tremendous
portion of the incoming Senate does share
our goals for next year.
However, if the Senate Advocacy Com
mittee continues to waste time on one-sen
tence resolutions that don't have anything
to do with the immediate needs of the stu
dent body, we will:
• Use the power of the Executive
branch to veto unnecessary resolutions
that don't address issues important to
most students; a veto can only be overrid
den by 2/3 of the Senate (Article 111, Sec
tion 7, Part 4 of the ASSU Constitution).
• Work with Senators to create special
committees to work on specific issues the
Advocacy Committee refuses to address;
such a move requires only a majority vote
of the Senate (Article 11, Section I, Part 1 of
the ASSU Constitution).
• Use our power to create special exec
utive commissions that would examine
particular issues such as student represen
tation on the Board of Trustees (Article 111,
Sect ion 7, Part 3 of the ASSU Constitution).
