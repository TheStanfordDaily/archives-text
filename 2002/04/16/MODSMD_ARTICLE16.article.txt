Undergraduate Senators
respond to Benson / Arimoto
As students with ASSU knowledge
and Student Advocacy experience, we
believe it necessary to clarify the miscon
ceptions about the Student Advocacy
Committee that the Benson / Arimoto
presidential slate is advertising.
Like the United States, the ASSU sep
arates the legislative and executive
branches; while the vice-president is au
thorized to break ties regarding the Sen
ate's overall decisions, neither the Presi
dent nor the vice-president have power
over the individual committees within
the Senate.
The published ideas of the
Benson/Arimoto campaign regarding
ASSU reform are thereby inconsistent
with the ASSU Constitution, and the re
forms the two are proposing have al
ready been made.
As opposed to a mere "one-sentence
resolution" which the Benson/Arimoto
campaign is asserting, our committee's af
firmative action resolution was actually
substantially rearticulated and expanded.
Indeed, recognizing the need fora clear
er resolution protocol, the Senate met on
Dec. 2 to create a new one, which requires
that the author of a resolution must in
clude a substantial amount of information
— including background, arguments and
counter-arguments, and a Constitutional
analysis — before the Senate will even
consider it.
Details of the discussions leading up
to this policy are available under the
meeting minutes on the ASSU Web site,
as well as at assu.stanford.edu/an
nouncements. All the resolutions the
Senate has since passed have followed
the new guidelines.
If any presidential slates want to re
form the Student Advocacy Committee,
they should run for the Senate.

ASSU Undergraduate Senators

Undergraduate Senate is
an effective body
The ASSU has been accused of a lack of
communication with the students by just
about everyone. This, to some extent, is a
very valid assertion, and is probably the
reason why so many candidates and stu
dents are making ignorant assertions. So,
as a Senator, I am going to communicate
with you now.
There have been entirely too many
misrepresentations and misunderstand
ings of what the ASSU and specifically the
senate has done this year. The Senate has
worked incredibly hard to fix many of the
inefficiencies of the body. To name only a
few, there are now codified policies for
funding, a protocol for writing resolu
tions, an entirely revamped Web site, a
more extensive orientation for the sena
tors, and individual committee archives
that will be handed on to the next senate.

The second thing to realize is that the
Advocacy Committee is in only its second
year of existence, and really its first year of
real activity advocating for students. We
have had a number of gr owing pains over
the year, learning how exactly to do the job.
Knowing how to find the issues that af
fect students and how to effectively support
and push for them, which are each unique,
is difficult and tricky. This required learn
ing the way in which the University oper
ates in itself. None of these things are mag
ically learned, and none of them were pre
sented before us. They were all things that
we had to learn over the course of the year.
The knowledge that we have collected,
the contacts we have made, and lessons we
have learned, have culminated in the
Latin American Studies resolution and the
Campaign for Accountability, which has
not yet been largely advertised since it was
the final project of our time in office and is
still largely a work in progress.
In writing the Latin American Studies
resolution, we worked closely with the
student representatives to the Faculty
Senate Committee for Undergraduate
Studies and with the students fighting to
save the program. Together we identi
fied three areas for improvement which
have been commented on as being very
constructive and useful by the deans of
Humanities and Sciences.
Third, the Faculty Diversity Task
Force came out of the Senate, not the ex
ecutive branch; despite what slates and
students have asserted. The NAACP has
done a great deal of the work that has
gone into this difficult issue, along with a
number of other students that have given
of their valuable time.
Fhe current president and vice-presi
dent of the ASSU have been extremely sup
portive, and Matt Brewer has given much
of his time to the task force, but it is an insult
to the students who have worked on the
committee to be so consistently ignored.
The Faculty Diversity Task Force was a
campaign promise by a senator, namely
myself, that came to fruition. Senators do
run on issues and do live up to them.
Fourth, student communication is a
two-way street. Students talk about "com
munication," not lecturing, which is what
I am doing now.
We have received three comments all
year. We have practically begged for com
ments this year at each of the three ASSU
outreach events in White Plaza. The new
Web site has a feedback button and all of
the senators' e-mail addresses are listed.
Two people have used it.
As far as outreach, we need to do a lot
more, but there was a Stanford Daily beat
writer at every Senate meeting and an ar
ticle in the Daily every Thursday. We an
nounced every meeting and the agenda
on the RA lists. Brewer and Vice-Presi
dent Christine Cordero put out an ASSU
newsletter and we sought student input
on the WRC issue through e-mail.
The Senate has a huge task to perform
and it is not always clear how to pursue it.
This is especially true for young groups
such as the Advocacy Committee. The work
that is necessary to make the Senate the
body it needs to be is huge, and will not be
fully accomplished in any one year, espe
cially with such a quick turnover.

This year's Senate did an incredible
amount of work and without any recogni
tion and most without pay. There is much
more that the Senate has done that cannot
be encapsulated in this letter, but none of
the Senators this year deserve some of the
irresponsible and ignorant criticisms that
have gone on during this campaign.

ASS LI Senator

Benson / Arimoto respond
to Undergraduate Senators
In a single meeting last November, the
Undergraduate Senate passed resolutions
from the Advocacy Committee endorsing
Stanford's "labor justice campaign" and, in
recognizing global warming as a "pressing
problem," calling on Stanford to obtain 25
percent of its energy from solar power by
2010. We'll let the readers decide whether
that was the best use of the Senate's time
and resources — especially when student
groups are being summarily put on proba
tion, our Board of Trustees lacks under
graduate or graduate representation, and
community centers are facing temporary
eviction from Old Union next year. In
deed, it's this type of behavior that has
caused the student body to become so disil
lusioned with the ASSU —and its why
we're committed to reforming student gov
ernment and the role of advocacy within it.
Specifically, we intend to work with the
incoming Senate to ensure that the Advoca
cy Committee does real work for all students
— something their new protocol doesn't ad
dress at all. As for the idea of ASSU Consti
tutional restrictions on our proposals: sug
gesting that the ASSU Executives have no
power to direct Senate business is like saying
President Bush can't get a tax cut plan
passed because he has no authority to intro
duce legislation to Congress. As ASSU Exec
utives, we'll work with allies in the incoming
Senate to make these changes — and in
talking with almost everyone currendy run
ning for Senate, we know a tremendous
portion of the incoming Senate does share
our goals for next year.
However, if the Senate Advocacy Com
mittee continues to waste time on one-sen
tence resolutions that don't have anything
to do with the immediate needs of the stu
dent body, we will:
• Use the power of the Executive
branch to veto unnecessary resolutions
that don't address issues important to
most students; a veto can only be overrid
den by 2/3 of the Senate (Article 111, Sec
tion 7, Part 4 of the ASSU Constitution).
• Work with Senators to create special
committees to work on specific issues the
Advocacy Committee refuses to address;
such a move requires only a majority vote
of the Senate (Article 11, Section I, Part 1 of
the ASSU Constitution).
• Use our power to create special exec
utive commissions that would examine
particular issues such as student represen
tation on the Board of Trustees (Article 111,
Sect ion 7, Part 3 of the ASSU Constitution).
1 liese student-led commissions (which
could be filled through the Nominations
Commission) would be chaired by one of
us and supported by the discretionary
money available to ASSU Executives.
We know some of those steps would be
bold; the continued waste of Senate time
and resources, however, would demand
nothing less.

AASA endorses Henestroza / Rodriguez
The secret ballot conducted at the most
recent AASA Town Hall — attended by
approximately 85 AASA members —
very clearly revealed a mandate for Moni
ca Henestroza and Nick Rodriguez. We
believe this slate follows in the tradition of
the last two ASSU executive slates with
experience both within the communities
and within the institutional framework of
the ASSU.
AASA believes it is in its interest and the
interest of the whole campus to continue
this same successful formula. Hie execu
tives needs an intimate and personal knowl
edge of communities to understand the is
sues of the diverse student population.
Two years ago, the proactive steps
taken by Seth Newton and Malia Villegas
to secure space and increased funding for
the community centers were successful lie
cause of their intimate knowledge, emo
tional investment and personal relation
ships within the communities. T his issue is
again very important to our communities
because the status of the community cen
ters is in jeopardy once again under the
University's renovation plans.
Students of color are often very politi
cized because our rights and comforts as
students often are most threatened. It is
critical for students of color to have repre
sentative leaders at the top of our student
government.
The executive slates must represent
our diversity, because sadly, it's one of our
only forums for student representation. I
do believe the executives need to be multi

faceted beyond students of color issues,
and the Henestroza/Rodriguez,
insider/outsider combination proves to be
the most balanced and qualified slate rep
resenting all students' concerns.
1 do not know Osofsky and Root. 1 do
not know Benson and Arimoto. As the
head of a major student organization with
over 700 sell-subscribed members, I find
this troublesome. 1 know my 112 riends head
ing the other minority organizations feel
the same way.
In contrast, I have had the privilege of
working throughout the year with Ro
driguez and especially Henestroza, and
their inspiring work speaks volumes to
their commitment to our communities' in
terests, issues and concerns. Your vote
matters — please choose wisely.

Arimoto exaggerates her experience at
the Women's Center
ASSU vice presidential candidate
Kendra Arimoto has stated repeatedly,
both at the candidates debate and on her
flyers, that she has worked and held lead
ership roles at the Women's Community
Center. Having been involved with the
women's community for the past three
years and having worked as a student stall
member at the Women's Community
Center for two years, I wish to clarify that
this is not the case.
Like many other women on this cam
pus, Kendra might have been, in some ca
pacity, involved with projects relating to
the women's community, such as the
Coalition Against Sexual Assault.
1 lowever, she has exaggerated her role
by describing herself as a leader in the
community.

Arimoto responds to Muhic
As the President of the Coalition
Against Sexual Assault, coordinator of
this year's lake Back the Night, treasur
er of Stanford's V-Day Campaign, and
co-producer of the "Vagina Mono
logues," I've had the opportunity to

work with Lisa Moore, the assistant di
rector of the Women's Community Cen
ter, a number of times.
Because the center is included in the
Coalition against Sexual Assault, 1 want
ed to emphasize that I had experience as
a student leader working with the
Women's Center. To Majda's credit, she
is correct: my listed background does
imply more direct leadership at the
Women's Center, and I apologize for not
making that clear.

ASSU Vice-Presuleiilial Candidal?

"Think!" candidates disappointed
with Daily coverage
As members of Think! who were disap
pointed by the format of the debate and our
presentation in the Daily, we would like to
clarify our objectives.
First things first, we are not a group of
whimsical, blind and stoned idealists
running exclusively to rebel against the
current electoral system and without a
notion of what effect we could and would
have. Rather, we are idealists challeng
ing our own stigma, arguing that reform
does not have to begin at an ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate meeting or within
the administration. It begins with each
one of us, as long as we are willing to take
the time to think about it.
We are confident that even the most
dedicated students question the extent to
which they exert themselves for the
promise of a comfortable future. As an al
ternative, we encourage a comfortable
present, which can be so simply achieved
by slowing down by a step or two, getting
to know a neighbor and becoming a part
of an ever-growing, diverse, stimulating
community outside the classroom.
And while living in this comfort, we
should ask questions that challenge the
structures of living provided to us by our
school, our country, and our world. Why
do we hesitate to smile at passers-by? Who
cleans up after us on this beautiful cam
pus, and how are they treated? How is the
homeless issue being addressed in the
Bay Area? Why is the voting rate for our
demographic low and declining? What is
the true end to our stressful work and
sleepless nights?
While every moment is an opportunity
to learn, converse, and think, vve have or
ganized a few events to prompt dialogue
and challenge the norm as a larger group.
These include a smile campaign to en
courage friendly exchanges with
"strangers," informal gatherings with pro
fessors and students, and daily picnics in
White Plaza. Please check out our website
at "www.stanford.edu/group/think" to
find out more about who we are and what
we do.
And in the end, we only ask you to join us
in thinking and conversing. Even if you
don't join us, join a friend or stranger. You
will be surprised at how many of your neigh
bors and classmates have the same discon
tents, concerns, fears, joys and hopes as you
do. Please remember that there is so much
more going on personally, locally, regional
ly, nationally and globally than c lass. Pick up
your heads, open up your eyes, and think!
with us.

Osofsky endorsements not impartial
When I first saw that there were three let
ters in yesterday's Daily endorsing Michael
Osofsky and Megan Root for ASSU president
and vice-president, I wasn't sure what to
think initially.
But then I looked at two of the people
who wrote them: Pat Bomhack, one of
Root's good friends, and Anthony Berry
hill, Osofsky's fraternity brother at Sigma
Phi Epsilon. Suddenly the kind words of
these endorsements seemed nothing more
than sleazy pitches from some of the c andi
date's friends meant to look like objective
nods of support from campus leaders and
regular joes.
But that's not surprising at all given how
many people I know that seem to have issues
with Osofsky's character. Bomhack attempt
ed to defend Osofsky in his letter yesterday,

calling widespread "character attacks" on
him "rumors."
Some time ago, I might have bought
Boml lac k's defense since no one seemed to
have any gocxl reason for disliking Osofsky,
even though such a large number seemed to.
But after finally asking my friends and ac
quaintances why they disliked Osofsky so
much, the answers 1 heard thoroughly con
vinced me that while Osofsky might be an
otherwise qualified candidate, he is not at all
the kind of person who deserves to be in any
kind of representative office.
Suddenly 1 understood why so many
people have ill feelings towards this man.
But still I wouldn't have been inclined to
write until I saw the shameless acts of
112 riends of his campaign in writing letters in
yesterday's Daily.
A recommendation fora candidate, writ
ten by a friend or acquaintance in an "ob
jective" style reeks of conflict of interest. I
don't care what qualifications he and his
running mate have in terms of experience
or connections, or how reasonable their
platform may sound.
This pair does not deserve to be ASSU
president and vice-president, plain and
simple.

Junior supports Osofsky
Does anyone who isn't running for office
or supporting someone who is really care
about the ASSU elections? Is theASSU even
representative of the student body? How
many engineers are in the ASSU?
I n a sch< x >1 where at least a gtxxl quarter of
the undergraduates are majoring in engi
neering, one would hope that the same pro
portion are in office. But of course tiiat isn't
I rue. After all, theASSU seems to appeal to the
political types who want to boost their resumes
before heading out into the world.
As a junior, I've never really voted in one
of these elections. Who really cares?
However, this past year I've gotten to
know one (>f the candidates in this year's elec
tion: Mike Osofsky. He's an interesting guy.
There have been various rumors and thinly
veiled campaigns against him by various
sources with the Chappie, perhaps, being
one of them. I've been deeply disappointed
at times with the reactions of many Stanford
students to unfounded hearsay.
I've seen Osofsky act with integrity and

ethics, and I've seen him defend issues and
people who were decidedly unpopular at the
time. I've seen him work 20-hour days for
theASSU in order to get things done. I must
admit, at times, I've not been exactly sin e ol
the efficacy of the means or the usefulness of
the cause, but at least you can't blame the lac k
oftrying.
1 .ike most of you, I've seen the big hoopla
the Chappie made in their stories on Osof
sky. In the past week, I've even seen Web
sites, flyers, and boards with random stu
dents, who don't even know Mike, talking
about his character.
As a person who knows him, I think hav
ing him as the ASSU president would be
great for the Stanford community. I le has
the experience and commitment to do a
phenomenal job in office.
Today and tomorrow we have the
choice of who to pick for ASSU president
and vice-president. It would be against
my principles to endorse a candidate, be
cause I believe that people who do not
make an effort to find out the differences
between the candidates should not rely on
hearsay (in this case, from me) to make
their choices.
But I would strongly urge students not to
disqualify a candidate merely because of an
unfounded negative impression.

Perry / Steinberg should
be taken seriously
In recent discussions of the upcoming
ASSU presidential elections, it seems that
candidates Adrian Perry and Matt Stein
berg of the Stanford Chaparral are not
viewed as legitimate candidates by most
people involved with the election. This
view is no doubt encouraged by their con
sistent use of satire as a part of their cam
paign strategy.
However, Perry and Steinberg are not
joking around; rather, they are demonstrat
ing the inherent impotence of the offices of
ASSU president and vice-president.
The institution of the ASSU is a useful
and vital part of student life at Stanford.
The ASSU is responsible for allocating
money to many deserving student groups
who use the funds productively to im
prove life for all of us. However, the par
ticular year-to-year makeup of the ASSU
in terms of personnel does not greatly af

feet the ASSU's ability to do its job. Rather,
the institutional value of the ASSU tran
scends yearly elections and changes in
composition.
It's no surprise that the same cam
paign issues come up year after year.
I bis is because ASSU presidential candi
dates consistently promise more than
they can deliver.
The limits of their constitutional author
ity, combined with the financial and logisti
cid constraints placed on the annually elect
ed officers, make it nearly impossible for the
ASSU President and Vice-President to ef
fect any major, permanent changes to the
University.
While student representation in the
University administration is important,
it seems all the ASSU needs at its head
are individuals who will not permanent
ly damage the ability of the ASSU to ful
fill its natural functions of allocating
money to student groups and enhancing
student representation on University
committees.
Despite their lack of direct experi
ence, Perry and Steinberg have shown
through their spot-on satire that they
know what theASSU is really about. For
example, Perry and Steinberg's proposal
to solve the campus space crunch by
making existing buildings taller has
about as much chance of being enacted
within the confines of the General Use
Permit as any other proposal that in
volves new construction.
Perry and Steinberg's "Bad Idiot
Hats," which they promise to wear when
they make a mistake, will provide just as
much accountability as currently exists in
theASSU.
Perry and Steinberg are legitimate can
didates who are just as capable as any of the
other candidates in this election.
Students will be more likely to care about
campus issues if they are presented in an
entertaining light — an area in which Perry
and Steinberg consistently rise above the
other candidates. We urge you to reconsid
er Perry and Steinberg for ASSU president
and vice-president because, after all, some
times all you need is someone to throw the
goddamn touchdown pass.

Dean Moogle endorses
Perry / Steinberg slate
When I first learned that Adrian Perry
and Matt Steinberg were running for the
ASSU president and vice-president respec
tively, I was alarmed because of their rebel
lious image and hyper-popularity amongst
the students. Now that I have seen them per
form so admirably in the campaigning pro
cess and Steinberg has stopped breaking
desks and windows around campus, I would
like to officially endorse them.
1 am reminded of the time that Adrian
threw the touchdown pass in the home
coming game against Lincoln High. The
crowd rushed the field that day and held
him high upon their shoulders as a cham
pion. A tear slowly trickled down my nor
mally steadfast scowl, and for just that one
moment, I knew he had something more to
offer to this school than those rock hard abs
and shotgun arm.
When the two began to chant "Dean
Moogle, No! No! No!" at the presidential
debate, 1 knew that deep down they mean,
"Dean Moogle, Yes! Yes! Yes!"
I thus tender my endorsement for the
duo, and wish them the best of luck.
On another note, if I could see MikeOsof
sky, Josh Benson, and Monica Henestroza in
my office later today, 1 ve had some reports of
tomfoolery. You will be punished.

cy Committee does real work for all students
— something their new protocol doesn't ad
dress at all. As for the idea of ASSU Consti

gesting that the ASSU Executives have no
power to direct Senate business is like saying
President Bush can't get a tax cut plan
passed because he has no authority to intro
duce legislation to Congress. As ASSU Exec
utives, we'll work with allies in the incoming
Senate to make these changes — and in
talking with almost everyone currendy run
ning for Senate, we know a tremendous
portion of the incoming Senate does share
our goals for next year.
However, if the Senate Advocacy Com
mittee continues to waste time on one-sen
tence resolutions that don't have anything
to do with the immediate needs of the stu
dent body, we will:
• Use the power of the Executive
branch to veto unnecessary resolutions
that don't address issues important to
most students; a veto can only be overrid
den by 2/3 of the Senate (Article 111, Sec
tion 7, Part 4 of the ASSU Constitution).
• Work with Senators to create special
committees to work on specific issues the
Advocacy Committee refuses to address;
such a move requires only a majority vote
of the Senate (Article 11, Section I, Part 1 of
the ASSU Constitution).
• Use our power to create special exec
utive commissions that would examine
particular issues such as student represen
tation on the Board of Trustees (Article 111,
Sect ion 7, Part 3 of the ASSU Constitution).
1 liese student-led commissions (which
could be filled through the Nominations

us and supported by the discretionary
money available to ASSU Executives.
We know some of those steps would be
bold; the continued waste of Senate time

nothing less.

AASA endorses Henestroza / Rodriguez
The secret ballot conducted at the most
recent AASA Town Hall — attended by
approximately 85 AASA members —
very clearly revealed a mandate for Moni
ca Henestroza and Nick Rodriguez. We
believe this slate follows in the tradition of
the last two ASSU executive slates with
experience both within the communities
and within the institutional framework of
the ASSU.
AASA believes it is in its interest and the
interest of the whole campus to continue
this same successful formula. Hie execu
tives needs an intimate and personal knowl
edge of communities to understand the is
sues of the diverse student population.
Two years ago, the proactive steps
taken by Seth Newton and Malia Villegas
to secure space and increased funding for
the community centers were successful lie
cause of their intimate knowledge, emo
tional investment and personal relation
ships within the communities. T his issue is
again very important to our communities
because the status of the community cen
ters is in jeopardy once again under the
University's renovation plans.
Students of color are often very politi
cized because our rights and comforts as
students often are most threatened. It is
critical for students of color to have repre
sentative leaders at the top of our student
government.
The executive slates must represent
our diversity, because sadly, it's one of our
only forums for student representation. I
do believe the executives need to be multi

faceted beyond students of color issues,
and the Henestroza/Rodriguez,
insider/outsider combination proves to be
the most balanced and qualified slate rep
resenting all students' concerns.
1 do not know Osofsky and Root. 1 do
not know Benson and Arimoto. As the
head of a major student organization with
over 700 sell-subscribed members, I find
this troublesome. 1 know my 112 riends head
ing the other minority organizations feel
the same way.
In contrast, I have had the privilege of
working throughout the year with Ro
driguez and especially Henestroza, and
their inspiring work speaks volumes to
their commitment to our communities' in
terests, issues and concerns. Your vote
matters — please choose wisely.

Arimoto exaggerates her experience at
the Women's Center
ASSU vice presidential candidate
Kendra Arimoto has stated repeatedly,
both at the candidates debate and on her
flyers, that she has worked and held lead

Center. Having been involved with the
women's community for the past three
years and having worked as a student stall
member at the Women's Community
Center for two years, I wish to clarify that
this is not the case.
Like many other women on this cam

pacity, involved with projects relating to
the women's community, such as the
Coalition Against Sexual Assault.
1 lowever, she has exaggerated her role
by describing herself as a leader in the

"Think!" candidates disappointed
with Daily coverage
As members of Think! who were disap
pointed by the format of the debate and our
presentation in the Daily, we would like to
clarify our objectives.
First things first, we are not a group of
whimsical, blind and stoned idealists
running exclusively to rebel against the
current electoral system and without a
notion of what effect we could and would
have. Rather, we are idealists challeng
ing our own stigma, arguing that reform
does not have to begin at an ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate meeting or within
the administration. It begins with each
one of us, as long as we are willing to take
the time to think about it.
We are confident that even the most
dedicated students question the extent to
which they exert themselves for the
promise of a comfortable future. As an al
ternative, we encourage a comfortable
present, which can be so simply achieved
by slowing down by a step or two, getting
to know a neighbor and becoming a part
of an ever-growing, diverse, stimulating
community outside the classroom.
And while living in this comfort, we
should ask questions that challenge the
structures of living provided to us by our
school, our country, and our world. Why
do we hesitate to smile at passers-by? Who
cleans up after us on this beautiful cam
pus, and how are they treated? How is the
homeless issue being addressed in the
Bay Area? Why is the voting rate for our
demographic low and declining? What is
the true end to our stressful work and
sleepless nights?
While every moment is an opportunity
to learn, converse, and think, vve have or
ganized a few events to prompt dialogue
and challenge the norm as a larger group.
These include a smile campaign to en
courage friendly exchanges with
"strangers," informal gatherings with pro
fessors and students, and daily picnics in
White Plaza. Please check out our website
at "www.stanford.edu/group/think" to
find out more about who we are and what
we do.
And in the end, we only ask you to join us
in thinking and conversing. Even if you
don't join us, join a friend or stranger. You
will be surprised at how many of your neigh
bors and classmates have the same discon
tents, concerns, fears, joys and hopes as you
do. Please remember that there is so much
more going on personally, locally, regional
ly, nationally and globally than c lass. Pick up
your heads, open up your eyes, and think!
with us.

Osofsky endorsements not impartial
When I first saw that there were three let
ters in yesterday's Daily endorsing Michael
Osofsky and Megan Root for ASSU president
and vice-president, I wasn't sure what to
think initially.
But then I looked at two of the people
who wrote them: Pat Bomhack, one of
Root's good friends, and Anthony Berry
hill, Osofsky's fraternity brother at Sigma
Phi Epsilon. Suddenly the kind words of
these endorsements seemed nothing more
than sleazy pitches from some of the c andi
date's friends meant to look like objective
nods of support from campus leaders and
regular joes.
But that's not surprising at all given how
many people I know that seem to have issues
with Osofsky's character. Bomhack attempt
ed to defend Osofsky in his letter yesterday,

calling widespread "character attacks" on
him "rumors."
Some time ago, I might have bought
Boml lac k's defense since no one seemed to
have any gocxl reason for disliking Osofsky,
even though such a large number seemed to.
But after finally asking my friends and ac
quaintances why they disliked Osofsky so
much, the answers 1 heard thoroughly con
vinced me that while Osofsky might be an
otherwise qualified candidate, he is not at all
the kind of person who deserves to be in any
kind of representative office.
Suddenly 1 understood why so many
people have ill feelings towards this man.
But still I wouldn't have been inclined to
write until I saw the shameless acts of
112 riends of his campaign in writing letters in
yesterday's Daily.
A recommendation fora candidate, writ
ten by a friend or acquaintance in an "ob
jective" style reeks of conflict of interest. I
don't care what qualifications he and his
running mate have in terms of experience
or connections, or how reasonable their
platform may sound.
This pair does not deserve to be ASSU
president and vice-president, plain and
simple.

Junior supports Osofsky
Does anyone who isn't running for office
or supporting someone who is really care
about the ASSU elections? Is theASSU even
representative of the student body? How
many engineers are in the ASSU?
I n a sch< x >1 where at least a gtxxl quarter of
the undergraduates are majoring in engi
neering, one would hope that the same pro
portion are in office. But of course tiiat isn't
I rue. After all, theASSU seems to appeal to the
political types who want to boost their resumes
before heading out into the world.
As a junior, I've never really voted in one
of these elections. Who really cares?
However, this past year I've gotten to
know one (>f the candidates in this year's elec
tion: Mike Osofsky. He's an interesting guy.
There have been various rumors and thinly
veiled campaigns against him by various
sources with the Chappie, perhaps, being
one of them. I've been deeply disappointed
at times with the reactions of many Stanford
students to unfounded hearsay.
I've seen Osofsky act with integrity and

ethics, and I've seen him defend issues and
people who were decidedly unpopular at the
time. I've seen him work 20-hour days for
theASSU in order to get things done. I must
admit, at times, I've not been exactly sin e ol
the efficacy of the means or the usefulness of
the cause, but at least you can't blame the lac k
oftrying.
1 .ike most of you, I've seen the big hoopla
the Chappie made in their stories on Osof
sky. In the past week, I've even seen Web
sites, flyers, and boards with random stu
dents, who don't even know Mike, talking
about his character.
As a person who knows him, I think hav
ing him as the ASSU president would be
great for the Stanford community. I le has
the experience and commitment to do a
phenomenal job in office.
Today and tomorrow we have the
choice of who to pick for ASSU president
and vice-president. It would be against
my principles to endorse a candidate, be
cause I believe that people who do not
make an effort to find out the differences
between the candidates should not rely on
hearsay (in this case, from me) to make
their choices.
But I would strongly urge students not to
disqualify a candidate merely because of an
unfounded negative impression.

Perry / Steinberg should
be taken seriously
In recent discussions of the upcoming
ASSU presidential elections, it seems that
candidates Adrian Perry and Matt Stein
berg of the Stanford Chaparral are not
viewed as legitimate candidates by most
people involved with the election. This
view is no doubt encouraged by their con
sistent use of satire as a part of their cam
paign strategy.
However, Perry and Steinberg are not
joking around; rather, they are demonstrat
ing the inherent impotence of the offices of
ASSU president and vice-president.
The institution of the ASSU is a useful
and vital part of student life at Stanford.
The ASSU is responsible for allocating
money to many deserving student groups
who use the funds productively to im
prove life for all of us. However, the par
ticular year-to-year makeup of the ASSU
in terms of personnel does not greatly af

feet the ASSU's ability to do its job. Rather,
the institutional value of the ASSU tran
scends yearly elections and changes in
composition.
It's no surprise that the same cam
paign issues come up year after year.
I bis is because ASSU presidential candi
dates consistently promise more than
they can deliver.
The limits of their constitutional author
ity, combined with the financial and logisti
cid constraints placed on the annually elect
ed officers, make it nearly impossible for the
ASSU President and Vice-President to ef
fect any major, permanent changes to the
University.
While student representation in the
University administration is important,
it seems all the ASSU needs at its head
are individuals who will not permanent
ly damage the ability of the ASSU to ful
fill its natural functions of allocating
money to student groups and enhancing
student representation on University
committees.
Despite their lack of direct experi
ence, Perry and Steinberg have shown
through their spot-on satire that they
know what theASSU is really about. For
example, Perry and Steinberg's proposal
to solve the campus space crunch by
making existing buildings taller has
about as much chance of being enacted
within the confines of the General Use
Permit as any other proposal that in
volves new construction.
Perry and Steinberg's "Bad Idiot
Hats," which they promise to wear when
they make a mistake, will provide just as
much accountability as currently exists in
theASSU.
Perry and Steinberg are legitimate can
didates who are just as capable as any of the
other candidates in this election.
Students will be more likely to care about
campus issues if they are presented in an
entertaining light — an area in which Perry
and Steinberg consistently rise above the
other candidates. We urge you to reconsid
er Perry and Steinberg for ASSU president
and vice-president because, after all, some
times all you need is someone to throw the
goddamn touchdown pass.

Dean Moogle endorses
Perry / Steinberg slate
When I first learned that Adrian Perry
and Matt Steinberg were running for the
ASSU president and vice-president respec
tively, I was alarmed because of their rebel
lious image and hyper-popularity amongst
the students. Now that I have seen them per
form so admirably in the campaigning pro
cess and Steinberg has stopped breaking
desks and windows around campus, I would
like to officially endorse them.
1 am reminded of the time that Adrian
threw the touchdown pass in the home
coming game against Lincoln High. The
crowd rushed the field that day and held
him high upon their shoulders as a cham
pion. A tear slowly trickled down my nor
mally steadfast scowl, and for just that one
moment, I knew he had something more to
offer to this school than those rock hard abs
and shotgun arm.
When the two began to chant "Dean
Moogle, No! No! No!" at the presidential
debate, 1 knew that deep down they mean,
"Dean Moogle, Yes! Yes! Yes!"
I thus tender my endorsement for the
duo, and wish them the best of luck.
On another note, if I could see MikeOsof
sky, Josh Benson, and Monica Henestroza in
my office later today, 1 ve had some reports of
tomfoolery. You will be punished.

Undergraduate Senators
respond to Benson / Arimoto
As students with ASSU knowledge
and Student Advocacy experience, we
believe it necessary to clarify the miscon
ceptions about the Student Advocacy
Committee that the Benson / Arimoto
presidential slate is advertising.
Like the United States, the ASSU sep
arates the legislative and executive
branches; while the vice-president is au
thorized to break ties regarding the Sen
ate's overall decisions, neither the Presi
dent nor the vice-president have power
over the individual committees within
the Senate.
The published ideas of the
Benson/Arimoto campaign regarding
ASSU reform are thereby inconsistent
with the ASSU Constitution, and the re
forms the two are proposing have al
ready been made.
As opposed to a mere "one-sentence
resolution" which the Benson/Arimoto
campaign is asserting, our committee's af
firmative action resolution was actually
substantially rearticulated and expanded.
Indeed, recognizing the need fora clear
er resolution protocol, the Senate met on
Dec. 2 to create a new one, which requires
that the author of a resolution must in
clude a substantial amount of information
— including background, arguments and
counter-arguments, and a Constitutional
analysis — before the Senate will even
consider it.
Details of the discussions leading up
to this policy are available under the
meeting minutes on the ASSU Web site,
as well as at assu.stanford.edu/an
nouncements. All the resolutions the
Senate has since passed have followed
the new guidelines.
If any presidential slates want to re
form the Student Advocacy Committee,
they should run for the Senate.

ASSU Undergraduate Senators

Undergraduate Senate is
an effective body
The ASSU has been accused of a lack of
communication with the students by just
about everyone. This, to some extent, is a
very valid assertion, and is probably the
reason why so many candidates and stu
dents are making ignorant assertions. So,
as a Senator, I am going to communicate
with you now.
There have been entirely too many
misrepresentations and misunderstand
ings of what the ASSU and specifically the
senate has done this year. The Senate has
worked incredibly hard to fix many of the
inefficiencies of the body. To name only a
few, there are now codified policies for
funding, a protocol for writing resolu
tions, an entirely revamped Web site, a
more extensive orientation for the sena
tors, and individual committee archives
that will be handed on to the next senate.

The second thing to realize is that the
Advocacy Committee is in only its second
year of existence, and really its first year of
real activity advocating for students. We
have had a number of gr owing pains over
the year, learning how exactly to do the job.
Knowing how to find the issues that af
fect students and how to effectively support
and push for them, which are each unique,
is difficult and tricky. This required learn
ing the way in which the University oper
ates in itself. None of these things are mag
ically learned, and none of them were pre
sented before us. They were all things that
we had to learn over the course of the year.
The knowledge that we have collected,
the contacts we have made, and lessons we
have learned, have culminated in the
Latin American Studies resolution and the
Campaign for Accountability, which has
not yet been largely advertised since it was
the final project of our time in office and is
still largely a work in progress.
In writing the Latin American Studies
resolution, we worked closely with the
student representatives to the Faculty
Senate Committee for Undergraduate
Studies and with the students fighting to
save the program. Together we identi
fied three areas for improvement which
have been commented on as being very
constructive and useful by the deans of
Humanities and Sciences.
Third, the Faculty Diversity Task
Force came out of the Senate, not the ex
ecutive branch; despite what slates and
students have asserted. The NAACP has
done a great deal of the work that has
gone into this difficult issue, along with a
number of other students that have given
of their valuable time.
Fhe current president and vice-presi
dent of the ASSU have been extremely sup
portive, and Matt Brewer has given much
of his time to the task force, but it is an insult
to the students who have worked on the
committee to be so consistently ignored.
The Faculty Diversity Task Force was a
campaign promise by a senator, namely
myself, that came to fruition. Senators do
run on issues and do live up to them.
Fourth, student communication is a
two-way street. Students talk about "com
munication," not lecturing, which is what
I am doing now.
We have received three comments all
year. We have practically begged for com
ments this year at each of the three ASSU
outreach events in White Plaza. The new
Web site has a feedback button and all of
the senators' e-mail addresses are listed.
Two people have used it.
As far as outreach, we need to do a lot
more, but there was a Stanford Daily beat
writer at every Senate meeting and an ar
ticle in the Daily every Thursday. We an
nounced every meeting and the agenda
on the RA lists. Brewer and Vice-Presi
dent Christine Cordero put out an ASSU
newsletter and we sought student input
on the WRC issue through e-mail.
The Senate has a huge task to perform
and it is not always clear how to pursue it.
This is especially true for young groups
such as the Advocacy Committee. The work
that is necessary to make the Senate the
body it needs to be is huge, and will not be
fully accomplished in any one year, espe
cially with such a quick turnover.

This year's Senate did an incredible
amount of work and without any recogni
tion and most without pay. There is much
more that the Senate has done that cannot
be encapsulated in this letter, but none of
the Senators this year deserve some of the
irresponsible and ignorant criticisms that
have gone on during this campaign.

Benson / Arimoto respond
to Undergraduate Senators
In a single meeting last November, the
Undergraduate Senate passed resolutions
from the Advocacy Committee endorsing
Stanford's "labor justice campaign" and, in
recognizing global warming as a "pressing
problem," calling on Stanford to obtain 25
percent of its energy from solar power by
2010. We'll let the readers decide whether
that was the best use of the Senate's time
and resources — especially when student
groups are being summarily put on proba
tion, our Board of Trustees lacks under
graduate or graduate representation, and
community centers are facing temporary
eviction from Old Union next year. In
deed, it's this type of behavior that has
caused the student body to become so disil
lusioned with the ASSU —and its why
we're committed to reforming student gov
ernment and the role of advocacy within it.
Specifically, we intend to work with the
incoming Senate to ensure that the Advoca
cy Committee does real work for all students
— something their new protocol doesn't ad
dress at all. As for the idea of ASSU Consti
tutional restrictions on our proposals: sug

Osofsky endorsements not impartial
When I first saw that there were three let
ters in yesterday's Daily endorsing Michael
Osofsky and Megan Root for ASSU president
and vice-president, I wasn't sure what to
think initially.
But then I looked at two of the people
who wrote them: Pat Bomhack, one of
Root's good friends, and Anthony Berry
hill, Osofsky's fraternity brother at Sigma
Phi Epsilon. Suddenly the kind words of
these endorsements seemed nothing more
than sleazy pitches from some of the c andi
date's friends meant to look like objective
nods of support from campus leaders and
regular joes.
But that's not surprising at all given how
many people I know that seem to have issues
with Osofsky's character. Bomhack attempt
ed to defend Osofsky in his letter yesterday,

calling widespread "character attacks" on
him "rumors."
Some time ago, I might have bought
Boml lac k's defense since no one seemed to
have any gocxl reason for disliking Osofsky,
even though such a large number seemed to.
But after finally asking my friends and ac
quaintances why they disliked Osofsky so
much, the answers 1 heard thoroughly con
vinced me that while Osofsky might be an
otherwise qualified candidate, he is not at all
the kind of person who deserves to be in any
kind of representative office.
Suddenly 1 understood why so many
people have ill feelings towards this man.
But still I wouldn't have been inclined to
write until I saw the shameless acts of
112 riends of his campaign in writing letters in
yesterday's Daily.
A recommendation fora candidate, writ
ten by a friend or acquaintance in an "ob
jective" style reeks of conflict of interest. I
don't care what qualifications he and his
running mate have in terms of experience
or connections, or how reasonable their
platform may sound.
This pair does not deserve to be ASSU
president and vice-president, plain and
simple.

Junior supports Osofsky
Does anyone who isn't running for office
or supporting someone who is really care
about the ASSU elections? Is theASSU even
representative of the student body? How
many engineers are in the ASSU?
I n a sch< x >1 where at least a gtxxl quarter of
the undergraduates are majoring in engi
neering, one would hope that the same pro
portion are in office. But of course tiiat isn't
I rue. After all, theASSU seems to appeal to the
political types who want to boost their resumes
before heading out into the world.
As a junior, I've never really voted in one
of these elections. Who really cares?
However, this past year I've gotten to
know one (>f the candidates in this year's elec
tion: Mike Osofsky. He's an interesting guy.
There have been various rumors and thinly
veiled campaigns against him by various
sources with the Chappie, perhaps, being
one of them. I've been deeply disappointed
at times with the reactions of many Stanford
students to unfounded hearsay.
I've seen Osofsky act with integrity and

ethics, and I've seen him defend issues and
people who were decidedly unpopular at the
time. I've seen him work 20-hour days for
theASSU in order to get things done. I must
admit, at times, I've not been exactly sin e ol
the efficacy of the means or the usefulness of
the cause, but at least you can't blame the lac k
oftrying.
1 .ike most of you, I've seen the big hoopla
the Chappie made in their stories on Osof
sky. In the past week, I've even seen Web
sites, flyers, and boards with random stu
dents, who don't even know Mike, talking
about his character.
As a person who knows him, I think hav
ing him as the ASSU president would be
great for the Stanford community. I le has
the experience and commitment to do a
phenomenal job in office.
Today and tomorrow we have the
choice of who to pick for ASSU president
and vice-president. It would be against
my principles to endorse a candidate, be
cause I believe that people who do not
make an effort to find out the differences
between the candidates should not rely on
hearsay (in this case, from me) to make
their choices.
But I would strongly urge students not to
disqualify a candidate merely because of an
unfounded negative impression.

Perry / Steinberg should
be taken seriously
In recent discussions of the upcoming
ASSU presidential elections, it seems that
candidates Adrian Perry and Matt Stein
berg of the Stanford Chaparral are not
viewed as legitimate candidates by most
people involved with the election. This
view is no doubt encouraged by their con
sistent use of satire as a part of their cam
paign strategy.
However, Perry and Steinberg are not
joking around; rather, they are demonstrat
ing the inherent impotence of the offices of
ASSU president and vice-president.
The institution of the ASSU is a useful
and vital part of student life at Stanford.
The ASSU is responsible for allocating
money to many deserving student groups
who use the funds productively to im
prove life for all of us. However, the par
ticular year-to-year makeup of the ASSU
in terms of personnel does not greatly af

feet the ASSU's ability to do its job. Rather,
the institutional value of the ASSU tran
scends yearly elections and changes in
composition.
It's no surprise that the same cam
paign issues come up year after year.
I bis is because ASSU presidential candi
dates consistently promise more than
they can deliver.
The limits of their constitutional author
ity, combined with the financial and logisti
cid constraints placed on the annually elect
ed officers, make it nearly impossible for the
ASSU President and Vice-President to ef
fect any major, permanent changes to the
University.
While student representation in the
University administration is important,
it seems all the ASSU needs at its head
are individuals who will not permanent
ly damage the ability of the ASSU to ful
fill its natural functions of allocating
money to student groups and enhancing
student representation on University
committees.
Despite their lack of direct experi
ence, Perry and Steinberg have shown
through their spot-on satire that they
know what theASSU is really about. For
example, Perry and Steinberg's proposal
to solve the campus space crunch by
making existing buildings taller has
about as much chance of being enacted
within the confines of the General Use
Permit as any other proposal that in
volves new construction.
Perry and Steinberg's "Bad Idiot
Hats," which they promise to wear when
they make a mistake, will provide just as
much accountability as currently exists in
theASSU.
Perry and Steinberg are legitimate can
didates who are just as capable as any of the
other candidates in this election.
Students will be more likely to care about
campus issues if they are presented in an
entertaining light — an area in which Perry
and Steinberg consistently rise above the
other candidates. We urge you to reconsid
er Perry and Steinberg for ASSU president
and vice-president because, after all, some
times all you need is someone to throw the
goddamn touchdown pass.

Dean Moogle endorses
Perry / Steinberg slate
When I first learned that Adrian Perry
and Matt Steinberg were running for the
ASSU president and vice-president respec
tively, I was alarmed because of their rebel
lious image and hyper-popularity amongst
the students. Now that I have seen them per
form so admirably in the campaigning pro
cess and Steinberg has stopped breaking
desks and windows around campus, I would
like to officially endorse them.
1 am reminded of the time that Adrian
threw the touchdown pass in the home
coming game against Lincoln High. The
crowd rushed the field that day and held
him high upon their shoulders as a cham
pion. A tear slowly trickled down my nor
mally steadfast scowl, and for just that one
moment, I knew he had something more to
offer to this school than those rock hard abs
and shotgun arm.
When the two began to chant "Dean
Moogle, No! No! No!" at the presidential
debate, 1 knew that deep down they mean,
"Dean Moogle, Yes! Yes! Yes!"
I thus tender my endorsement for the
duo, and wish them the best of luck.
On another note, if I could see MikeOsof
sky, Josh Benson, and Monica Henestroza in
my office later today, 1 ve had some reports of
tomfoolery. You will be punished.

The ASSU needs leadership. The exact

get homecoming '87. It was against Lincoln
High and, well, you know the story. Let's
just say Adrian scored after the game as well
as during.
From a cheerleader's perspective
(cheer-spective) Adrian is great because he
gives me lots to cheer about. Like Touch

And that is good for everybody.

Undergraduate Senators
respond to Benson / Arimoto
As students with ASSU knowledge
and Student Advocacy experience, we
believe it necessary to clarify the miscon
ceptions about the Student Advocacy
Committee that the Benson / Arimoto
presidential slate is advertising.
Like the United States, the ASSU sep
arates the legislative and executive
branches; while the vice-president is au
thorized to break ties regarding the Sen
ate's overall decisions, neither the Presi
dent nor the vice-president have power
over the individual committees within
the Senate.
The published ideas of the
Benson/Arimoto campaign regarding
ASSU reform are thereby inconsistent
with the ASSU Constitution, and the re
forms the two are proposing have al
ready been made.
As opposed to a mere "one-sentence
resolution" which the Benson/Arimoto
campaign is asserting, our committee's af
firmative action resolution was actually
substantially rearticulated and expanded.
Indeed, recognizing the need fora clear
er resolution protocol, the Senate met on
Dec. 2 to create a new one, which requires
that the author of a resolution must in
clude a substantial amount of information
— including background, arguments and
counter-arguments, and a Constitutional
analysis — before the Senate will even
consider it.
Details of the discussions leading up
to this policy are available under the
meeting minutes on the ASSU Web site,
as well as at assu.stanford.edu/an
nouncements. All the resolutions the
Senate has since passed have followed
the new guidelines.
If any presidential slates want to re
form the Student Advocacy Committee,
they should run for the Senate.

ASSU Undergraduate Senators

Undergraduate Senate is
an effective body
The ASSU has been accused of a lack of
communication with the students by just
about everyone. This, to some extent, is a
very valid assertion, and is probably the
reason why so many candidates and stu
dents are making ignorant assertions. So,
as a Senator, I am going to communicate
with you now.
There have been entirely too many
misrepresentations and misunderstand
ings of what the ASSU and specifically the
senate has done this year. The Senate has
worked incredibly hard to fix many of the
inefficiencies of the body. To name only a
few, there are now codified policies for
funding, a protocol for writing resolu
tions, an entirely revamped Web site, a
more extensive orientation for the sena
tors, and individual committee archives
that will be handed on to the next senate.

The second thing to realize is that the
Advocacy Committee is in only its second
year of existence, and really its first year of
real activity advocating for students. We
have had a number of gr owing pains over
the year, learning how exactly to do the job.
Knowing how to find the issues that af
fect students and how to effectively support
and push for them, which are each unique,
is difficult and tricky. This required learn
ing the way in which the University oper
ates in itself. None of these things are mag
ically learned, and none of them were pre
sented before us. They were all things that
we had to learn over the course of the year.
The knowledge that we have collected,
the contacts we have made, and lessons we
have learned, have culminated in the
Latin American Studies resolution and the
Campaign for Accountability, which has
not yet been largely advertised since it was
the final project of our time in office and is
still largely a work in progress.
In writing the Latin American Studies
resolution, we worked closely with the
student representatives to the Faculty
Senate Committee for Undergraduate
Studies and with the students fighting to
save the program. Together we identi
fied three areas for improvement which
have been commented on as being very
constructive and useful by the deans of
Humanities and Sciences.
Third, the Faculty Diversity Task
Force came out of the Senate, not the ex
ecutive branch; despite what slates and
students have asserted. The NAACP has
done a great deal of the work that has
gone into this difficult issue, along with a
number of other students that have given
of their valuable time.
Fhe current president and vice-presi
dent of the ASSU have been extremely sup
portive, and Matt Brewer has given much
of his time to the task force, but it is an insult
to the students who have worked on the
committee to be so consistently ignored.
The Faculty Diversity Task Force was a
campaign promise by a senator, namely
myself, that came to fruition. Senators do
run on issues and do live up to them.
Fourth, student communication is a
two-way street. Students talk about "com
munication," not lecturing, which is what
I am doing now.
We have received three comments all
year. We have practically begged for com
ments this year at each of the three ASSU
outreach events in White Plaza. The new
Web site has a feedback button and all of
the senators' e-mail addresses are listed.
Two people have used it.
As far as outreach, we need to do a lot
more, but there was a Stanford Daily beat
writer at every Senate meeting and an ar
ticle in the Daily every Thursday. We an
nounced every meeting and the agenda
on the RA lists. Brewer and Vice-Presi
dent Christine Cordero put out an ASSU
newsletter and we sought student input
on the WRC issue through e-mail.
The Senate has a huge task to perform
and it is not always clear how to pursue it.
This is especially true for young groups
such as the Advocacy Committee. The work
that is necessary to make the Senate the
body it needs to be is huge, and will not be
fully accomplished in any one year, espe
cially with such a quick turnover.

This year's Senate did an incredible
amount of work and without any recogni
tion and most without pay. There is much
more that the Senate has done that cannot
be encapsulated in this letter, but none of
the Senators this year deserve some of the
irresponsible and ignorant criticisms that
have gone on during this campaign.
SONRISA LUCERO
ASS LI Senator

Benson / Arimoto respond
to Undergraduate Senators
In a single meeting last November, the
Undergraduate Senate passed resolutions
from the Advocacy Committee endorsing
Stanford's "labor justice campaign" and, in
recognizing global warming as a "pressing
problem," calling on Stanford to obtain 25
percent of its energy from solar power by
2010. We'll let the readers decide whether
that was the best use of the Senate's time
and resources — especially when student
groups are being summarily put on proba
tion, our Board of Trustees lacks under
graduate or graduate representation, and
community centers are facing temporary
eviction from Old Union next year. In
deed, it's this type of behavior that has
caused the student body to become so disil
lusioned with the ASSU —and its why
we're committed to reforming student gov
ernment and the role of advocacy within it.
Specifically, we intend to work with the
incoming Senate to ensure that the Advoca
cy Committee does real work for all students
— something their new protocol doesn't ad
dress at all. As for the idea of ASSU Consti
tutional restrictions on our proposals: sug
gesting that the ASSU Executives have no
power to direct Senate business is like saying
President Bush can't get a tax cut plan
passed because he has no authority to intro
duce legislation to Congress. As ASSU Exec
utives, we'll work with allies in the incoming
Senate to make these changes — and in
talking with almost everyone currendy run
ning for Senate, we know a tremendous
portion of the incoming Senate does share
our goals for next year.
However, if the Senate Advocacy Com
mittee continues to waste time on one-sen
tence resolutions that don't have anything
to do with the immediate needs of the stu
dent body, we will:
• Use the power of the Executive
branch to veto unnecessary resolutions
that don't address issues important to
most students; a veto can only be overrid
den by 2/3 of the Senate (Article 111, Sec
tion 7, Part 4 of the ASSU Constitution).
• Work with Senators to create special
committees to work on specific issues the
Advocacy Committee refuses to address;
such a move requires only a majority vote
of the Senate (Article 11, Section I, Part 1 of
the ASSU Constitution).
• Use our power to create special exec
utive commissions that would examine
particular issues such as student represen
tation on the Board of Trustees (Article 111,
Sect ion 7, Part 3 of the ASSU Constitution).
1 liese student-led commissions (which
could be filled through the Nominations
Commission) would be chaired by one of
us and supported by the discretionary
money available to ASSU Executives.
We know some of those steps would be
bold; the continued waste of Senate time
and resources, however, would demand
nothing less.

AASA endorses Henestroza / Rodriguez
The secret ballot conducted at the most
recent AASA Town Hall — attended by
approximately 85 AASA members —
very clearly revealed a mandate for Moni
ca Henestroza and Nick Rodriguez. We
believe this slate follows in the tradition of
the last two ASSU executive slates with
experience both within the communities
and within the institutional framework of
the ASSU.
AASA believes it is in its interest and the
interest of the whole campus to continue
this same successful formula. Hie execu
tives needs an intimate and personal knowl
edge of communities to understand the is
sues of the diverse student population.
Two years ago, the proactive steps
taken by Seth Newton and Malia Villegas
to secure space and increased funding for
the community centers were successful lie
cause of their intimate knowledge, emo
tional investment and personal relation
ships within the communities. T his issue is
again very important to our communities
because the status of the community cen
ters is in jeopardy once again under the
University's renovation plans.
Students of color are often very politi
cized because our rights and comforts as
students often are most threatened. It is
critical for students of color to have repre
sentative leaders at the top of our student
government.
The executive slates must represent
our diversity, because sadly, it's one of our
only forums for student representation. I
do believe the executives need to be multi

faceted beyond students of color issues,
and the Henestroza/Rodriguez,
insider/outsider combination proves to be
the most balanced and qualified slate rep
resenting all students' concerns.
1 do not know Osofsky and Root. 1 do
not know Benson and Arimoto. As the
head of a major student organization with
over 700 sell-subscribed members, I find
this troublesome. 1 know my 112 riends head
ing the other minority organizations feel
the same way.
In contrast, I have had the privilege of
working throughout the year with Ro
driguez and especially Henestroza, and
their inspiring work speaks volumes to
their commitment to our communities' in
terests, issues and concerns. Your vote
matters — please choose wisely.

Arimoto exaggerates her experience at
the Women's Center
ASSU vice presidential candidate
Kendra Arimoto has stated repeatedly,
both at the candidates debate and on her
flyers, that she has worked and held lead
ership roles at the Women's Community
Center. Having been involved with the
women's community for the past three
years and having worked as a student stall
member at the Women's Community
Center for two years, I wish to clarify that
this is not the case.
Like many other women on this cam
pus, Kendra might have been, in some ca
pacity, involved with projects relating to
the women's community, such as the
Coalition Against Sexual Assault.
1 lowever, she has exaggerated her role
by describing herself as a leader in the
community.

work with Lisa Moore, the assistant di

Because the center is included in the
Coalition against Sexual Assault, 1 want
ed to emphasize that I had experience as
a student leader working with the

is correct: my listed background does

"Think!" candidates disappointed
with Daily coverage
As members of Think! who were disap
pointed by the format of the debate and our
presentation in the Daily, we would like to
clarify our objectives.
First things first, we are not a group of
whimsical, blind and stoned idealists
running exclusively to rebel against the
current electoral system and without a
notion of what effect we could and would
have. Rather, we are idealists challeng
ing our own stigma, arguing that reform
does not have to begin at an ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate meeting or within
the administration. It begins with each
one of us, as long as we are willing to take
the time to think about it.
We are confident that even the most
dedicated students question the extent to
which they exert themselves for the
promise of a comfortable future. As an al
ternative, we encourage a comfortable
present, which can be so simply achieved
by slowing down by a step or two, getting
to know a neighbor and becoming a part
of an ever-growing, diverse, stimulating
community outside the classroom.
And while living in this comfort, we
should ask questions that challenge the
structures of living provided to us by our
school, our country, and our world. Why
do we hesitate to smile at passers-by? Who
cleans up after us on this beautiful cam
pus, and how are they treated? How is the
homeless issue being addressed in the
Bay Area? Why is the voting rate for our
demographic low and declining? What is
the true end to our stressful work and
sleepless nights?
While every moment is an opportunity
to learn, converse, and think, vve have or
ganized a few events to prompt dialogue
and challenge the norm as a larger group.
These include a smile campaign to en
courage friendly exchanges with
"strangers," informal gatherings with pro
fessors and students, and daily picnics in
White Plaza. Please check out our website

paign issues come up year after year.
I bis is because ASSU presidential candi
dates consistently promise more than
they can deliver.
The limits of their constitutional author
ity, combined with the financial and logisti
cid constraints placed on the annually elect
ed officers, make it nearly impossible for the
ASSU President and Vice-President to ef
fect any major, permanent changes to the
University.
While student representation in the
University administration is important,
it seems all the ASSU needs at its head
are individuals who will not permanent
ly damage the ability of the ASSU to ful
fill its natural functions of allocating
money to student groups and enhancing
student representation on University
committees.
Despite their lack of direct experi
ence, Perry and Steinberg have shown
through their spot-on satire that they
know what theASSU is really about. For
example, Perry and Steinberg's proposal
to solve the campus space crunch by
making existing buildings taller has
about as much chance of being enacted
within the confines of the General Use
Permit as any other proposal that in
volves new construction.
Perry and Steinberg's "Bad Idiot
Hats," which they promise to wear when
they make a mistake, will provide just as
much accountability as currently exists in
theASSU.
Perry and Steinberg are legitimate can
didates who are just as capable as any of the
other candidates in this election.
Students will be more likely to care about
campus issues if they are presented in an
entertaining light — an area in which Perry
and Steinberg consistently rise above the
other candidates. We urge you to reconsid
er Perry and Steinberg for ASSU president
and vice-president because, after all, some
times all you need is someone to throw the
goddamn touchdown pass.

Perry / Steinberg slate
When I first learned that Adrian Perry

lious image and hyper-popularity amongst
the students. Now that I have seen them per
form so admirably in the campaigning pro
cess and Steinberg has stopped breaking
desks and windows around campus, I would
like to officially endorse them.
1 am reminded of the time that Adrian
threw the touchdown pass in the home

crowd rushed the field that day and held
him high upon their shoulders as a cham
pion. A tear slowly trickled down my nor
mally steadfast scowl, and for just that one

offer to this school than those rock hard abs
and shotgun arm.
When the two began to chant "Dean

"Dean Moogle, Yes! Yes! Yes!"
I thus tender my endorsement for the

Undergraduate Senators
respond to Benson / Arimoto
As students with ASSU knowledge
and Student Advocacy experience, we
believe it necessary to clarify the miscon
ceptions about the Student Advocacy
Committee that the Benson / Arimoto
presidential slate is advertising.
Like the United States, the ASSU sep
arates the legislative and executive
branches; while the vice-president is au
thorized to break ties regarding the Sen
ate's overall decisions, neither the Presi
dent nor the vice-president have power
over the individual committees within
the Senate.
The published ideas of the
Benson/Arimoto campaign regarding
ASSU reform are thereby inconsistent
with the ASSU Constitution, and the re
forms the two are proposing have al
ready been made.
As opposed to a mere "one-sentence
resolution" which the Benson/Arimoto
campaign is asserting, our committee's af
firmative action resolution was actually
substantially rearticulated and expanded.
Indeed, recognizing the need fora clear
er resolution protocol, the Senate met on
Dec. 2 to create a new one, which requires
that the author of a resolution must in
clude a substantial amount of information
— including background, arguments and
counter-arguments, and a Constitutional
analysis — before the Senate will even
consider it.
Details of the discussions leading up
to this policy are available under the
meeting minutes on the ASSU Web site,
as well as at assu.stanford.edu/an
nouncements. All the resolutions the
Senate has since passed have followed
the new guidelines.
If any presidential slates want to re
form the Student Advocacy Committee,
they should run for the Senate.

ASSU Undergraduate Senators

Undergraduate Senate is
an effective body
The ASSU has been accused of a lack of
communication with the students by just
about everyone. This, to some extent, is a
very valid assertion, and is probably the
reason why so many candidates and stu
dents are making ignorant assertions. So,
as a Senator, I am going to communicate
with you now.
There have been entirely too many
misrepresentations and misunderstand
ings of what the ASSU and specifically the
senate has done this year. The Senate has
worked incredibly hard to fix many of the
inefficiencies of the body. To name only a
few, there are now codified policies for
funding, a protocol for writing resolu
tions, an entirely revamped Web site, a
more extensive orientation for the sena
tors, and individual committee archives
that will be handed on to the next senate.

The second thing to realize is that the
Advocacy Committee is in only its second
year of existence, and really its first year of
real activity advocating for students. We
have had a number of gr owing pains over
the year, learning how exactly to do the job.
Knowing how to find the issues that af
fect students and how to effectively support
and push for them, which are each unique,
is difficult and tricky. This required learn
ing the way in which the University oper
ates in itself. None of these things are mag
ically learned, and none of them were pre
sented before us. They were all things that
we had to learn over the course of the year.
The knowledge that we have collected,
the contacts we have made, and lessons we
have learned, have culminated in the
Latin American Studies resolution and the
Campaign for Accountability, which has
not yet been largely advertised since it was
the final project of our time in office and is
still largely a work in progress.
In writing the Latin American Studies
resolution, we worked closely with the
student representatives to the Faculty
Senate Committee for Undergraduate
Studies and with the students fighting to
save the program. Together we identi
fied three areas for improvement which
have been commented on as being very
constructive and useful by the deans of
Humanities and Sciences.
Third, the Faculty Diversity Task
Force came out of the Senate, not the ex
ecutive branch; despite what slates and
students have asserted. The NAACP has
done a great deal of the work that has
gone into this difficult issue, along with a
number of other students that have given
of their valuable time.
Fhe current president and vice-presi
dent of the ASSU have been extremely sup
portive, and Matt Brewer has given much
of his time to the task force, but it is an insult
to the students who have worked on the
committee to be so consistently ignored.
The Faculty Diversity Task Force was a
campaign promise by a senator, namely
myself, that came to fruition. Senators do
run on issues and do live up to them.
Fourth, student communication is a
two-way street. Students talk about "com
munication," not lecturing, which is what
I am doing now.
We have received three comments all
year. We have practically begged for com
ments this year at each of the three ASSU
outreach events in White Plaza. The new
Web site has a feedback button and all of
the senators' e-mail addresses are listed.
Two people have used it.
As far as outreach, we need to do a lot
more, but there was a Stanford Daily beat
writer at every Senate meeting and an ar
ticle in the Daily every Thursday. We an
nounced every meeting and the agenda
on the RA lists. Brewer and Vice-Presi
dent Christine Cordero put out an ASSU
newsletter and we sought student input
on the WRC issue through e-mail.
The Senate has a huge task to perform
and it is not always clear how to pursue it.
This is especially true for young groups
such as the Advocacy Committee. The work
that is necessary to make the Senate the
body it needs to be is huge, and will not be
fully accomplished in any one year, espe
cially with such a quick turnover.

This year's Senate did an incredible
amount of work and without any recogni
tion and most without pay. There is much
more that the Senate has done that cannot
be encapsulated in this letter, but none of
the Senators this year deserve some of the
irresponsible and ignorant criticisms that
have gone on during this campaign.
SONRISA LUCERO
ASS LI Senator

Benson / Arimoto respond
to Undergraduate Senators
In a single meeting last November, the
Undergraduate Senate passed resolutions
from the Advocacy Committee endorsing
Stanford's "labor justice campaign" and, in
recognizing global warming as a "pressing
problem," calling on Stanford to obtain 25
percent of its energy from solar power by
2010. We'll let the readers decide whether
that was the best use of the Senate's time
and resources — especially when student
groups are being summarily put on proba
tion, our Board of Trustees lacks under
graduate or graduate representation, and
community centers are facing temporary
eviction from Old Union next year. In
deed, it's this type of behavior that has
caused the student body to become so disil
lusioned with the ASSU —and its why
we're committed to reforming student gov
ernment and the role of advocacy within it.
Specifically, we intend to work with the
incoming Senate to ensure that the Advoca
cy Committee does real work for all students
— something their new protocol doesn't ad
dress at all. As for the idea of ASSU Consti
tutional restrictions on our proposals: sug
gesting that the ASSU Executives have no
power to direct Senate business is like saying
President Bush can't get a tax cut plan
passed because he has no authority to intro
duce legislation to Congress. As ASSU Exec
utives, we'll work with allies in the incoming
Senate to make these changes — and in
talking with almost everyone currendy run
ning for Senate, we know a tremendous
portion of the incoming Senate does share
our goals for next year.
However, if the Senate Advocacy Com
mittee continues to waste time on one-sen
tence resolutions that don't have anything
to do with the immediate needs of the stu
dent body, we will:
• Use the power of the Executive
branch to veto unnecessary resolutions
that don't address issues important to
most students; a veto can only be overrid
den by 2/3 of the Senate (Article 111, Sec
tion 7, Part 4 of the ASSU Constitution).
• Work with Senators to create special
committees to work on specific issues the
Advocacy Committee refuses to address;
such a move requires only a majority vote
of the Senate (Article 11, Section I, Part 1 of
the ASSU Constitution).
• Use our power to create special exec
utive commissions that would examine
particular issues such as student represen
tation on the Board of Trustees (Article 111,
Sect ion 7, Part 3 of the ASSU Constitution).
1 liese student-led commissions (which
could be filled through the Nominations
Commission) would be chaired by one of
us and supported by the discretionary
money available to ASSU Executives.
We know some of those steps would be
bold; the continued waste of Senate time
and resources, however, would demand
nothing less.

AASA endorses Henestroza / Rodriguez
The secret ballot conducted at the most
recent AASA Town Hall — attended by
approximately 85 AASA members —
very clearly revealed a mandate for Moni
ca Henestroza and Nick Rodriguez. We
believe this slate follows in the tradition of
the last two ASSU executive slates with
experience both within the communities
and within the institutional framework of
the ASSU.
AASA believes it is in its interest and the
interest of the whole campus to continue
this same successful formula. Hie execu
tives needs an intimate and personal knowl
edge of communities to understand the is
sues of the diverse student population.
Two years ago, the proactive steps
taken by Seth Newton and Malia Villegas
to secure space and increased funding for
the community centers were successful lie
cause of their intimate knowledge, emo
tional investment and personal relation
ships within the communities. T his issue is
again very important to our communities
because the status of the community cen
ters is in jeopardy once again under the
University's renovation plans.
Students of color are often very politi
cized because our rights and comforts as
students often are most threatened. It is
critical for students of color to have repre
sentative leaders at the top of our student
government.
The executive slates must represent
our diversity, because sadly, it's one of our
only forums for student representation. I
do believe the executives need to be multi

faceted beyond students of color issues,
and the Henestroza/Rodriguez,
insider/outsider combination proves to be
the most balanced and qualified slate rep
resenting all students' concerns.
1 do not know Osofsky and Root. 1 do
not know Benson and Arimoto. As the
head of a major student organization with
over 700 sell-subscribed members, I find
this troublesome. 1 know my 112 riends head
ing the other minority organizations feel
the same way.
In contrast, I have had the privilege of
working throughout the year with Ro
driguez and especially Henestroza, and
their inspiring work speaks volumes to
their commitment to our communities' in
terests, issues and concerns. Your vote
matters — please choose wisely.

Arimoto exaggerates her experience at
the Women's Center
ASSU vice presidential candidate
Kendra Arimoto has stated repeatedly,
both at the candidates debate and on her
flyers, that she has worked and held lead
ership roles at the Women's Community
Center. Having been involved with the
women's community for the past three
years and having worked as a student stall
member at the Women's Community
Center for two years, I wish to clarify that
this is not the case.
Like many other women on this cam
pus, Kendra might have been, in some ca
pacity, involved with projects relating to
the women's community, such as the
Coalition Against Sexual Assault.
1 lowever, she has exaggerated her role
by describing herself as a leader in the
community.

Arimoto responds to Muhic
As the President of the Coalition
Against Sexual Assault, coordinator of
this year's lake Back the Night, treasur
er of Stanford's V-Day Campaign, and
co-producer of the "Vagina Mono
logues," I've had the opportunity to

work with Lisa Moore, the assistant di
rector of the Women's Community Cen
ter, a number of times.
Because the center is included in the
Coalition against Sexual Assault, 1 want
ed to emphasize that I had experience as
a student leader working with the
Women's Center. To Majda's credit, she
is correct: my listed background does
imply more direct leadership at the
Women's Center, and I apologize for not
making that clear.

ASSU Vice-Presuleiilial Candidal?

"Think!" candidates disappointed
with Daily coverage
As members of Think! who were disap
pointed by the format of the debate and our
presentation in the Daily, we would like to
clarify our objectives.
First things first, we are not a group of
whimsical, blind and stoned idealists
running exclusively to rebel against the
current electoral system and without a
notion of what effect we could and would
have. Rather, we are idealists challeng
ing our own stigma, arguing that reform
does not have to begin at an ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate meeting or within
the administration. It begins with each
one of us, as long as we are willing to take
the time to think about it.
We are confident that even the most
dedicated students question the extent to
which they exert themselves for the
promise of a comfortable future. As an al
ternative, we encourage a comfortable
present, which can be so simply achieved
by slowing down by a step or two, getting
to know a neighbor and becoming a part
of an ever-growing, diverse, stimulating
community outside the classroom.
And while living in this comfort, we
should ask questions that challenge the
structures of living provided to us by our
school, our country, and our world. Why
do we hesitate to smile at passers-by? Who
cleans up after us on this beautiful cam
pus, and how are they treated? How is the
homeless issue being addressed in the
Bay Area? Why is the voting rate for our
demographic low and declining? What is
the true end to our stressful work and
sleepless nights?
While every moment is an opportunity
to learn, converse, and think, vve have or
ganized a few events to prompt dialogue
and challenge the norm as a larger group.
These include a smile campaign to en
courage friendly exchanges with
"strangers," informal gatherings with pro
fessors and students, and daily picnics in
White Plaza. Please check out our website
at "www.stanford.edu/group/think" to
find out more about who we are and what
we do.
And in the end, we only ask you to join us
in thinking and conversing. Even if you
don't join us, join a friend or stranger. You
will be surprised at how many of your neigh
bors and classmates have the same discon
tents, concerns, fears, joys and hopes as you
do. Please remember that there is so much
more going on personally, locally, regional
ly, nationally and globally than c lass. Pick up
your heads, open up your eyes, and think!
with us.

Osofsky endorsements not impartial
When I first saw that there were three let
ters in yesterday's Daily endorsing Michael
Osofsky and Megan Root for ASSU president
and vice-president, I wasn't sure what to
think initially.
But then I looked at two of the people
who wrote them: Pat Bomhack, one of
Root's good friends, and Anthony Berry
hill, Osofsky's fraternity brother at Sigma
Phi Epsilon. Suddenly the kind words of
these endorsements seemed nothing more
than sleazy pitches from some of the c andi
date's friends meant to look like objective
nods of support from campus leaders and
regular joes.
But that's not surprising at all given how
many people I know that seem to have issues
with Osofsky's character. Bomhack attempt
ed to defend Osofsky in his letter yesterday,

calling widespread "character attacks" on
him "rumors."
Some time ago, I might have bought
Boml lac k's defense since no one seemed to
have any gocxl reason for disliking Osofsky,
even though such a large number seemed to.
But after finally asking my friends and ac
quaintances why they disliked Osofsky so
much, the answers 1 heard thoroughly con
vinced me that while Osofsky might be an
otherwise qualified candidate, he is not at all
the kind of person who deserves to be in any
kind of representative office.
Suddenly 1 understood why so many
people have ill feelings towards this man.
But still I wouldn't have been inclined to
write until I saw the shameless acts of
112 riends of his campaign in writing letters in
yesterday's Daily.
A recommendation fora candidate, writ
ten by a friend or acquaintance in an "ob
jective" style reeks of conflict of interest. I
don't care what qualifications he and his
running mate have in terms of experience
or connections, or how reasonable their
platform may sound.
This pair does not deserve to be ASSU
president and vice-president, plain and
simple.

Junior supports Osofsky
Does anyone who isn't running for office
or supporting someone who is really care
about the ASSU elections? Is theASSU even
representative of the student body? How
many engineers are in the ASSU?
I n a sch< x >1 where at least a gtxxl quarter of
the undergraduates are majoring in engi
neering, one would hope that the same pro
portion are in office. But of course tiiat isn't
I rue. After all, theASSU seems to appeal to the
political types who want to boost their resumes
before heading out into the world.
As a junior, I've never really voted in one
of these elections. Who really cares?
However, this past year I've gotten to
know one (>f the candidates in this year's elec
tion: Mike Osofsky. He's an interesting guy.
There have been various rumors and thinly
veiled campaigns against him by various
sources with the Chappie, perhaps, being
one of them. I've been deeply disappointed
at times with the reactions of many Stanford
students to unfounded hearsay.
I've seen Osofsky act with integrity and

ethics, and I've seen him defend issues and
people who were decidedly unpopular at the
time. I've seen him work 20-hour days for
theASSU in order to get things done. I must
admit, at times, I've not been exactly sin e ol
the efficacy of the means or the usefulness of
the cause, but at least you can't blame the lac k
oftrying.
1 .ike most of you, I've seen the big hoopla
the Chappie made in their stories on Osof
sky. In the past week, I've even seen Web
sites, flyers, and boards with random stu
dents, who don't even know Mike, talking
about his character.
As a person who knows him, I think hav
ing him as the ASSU president would be
great for the Stanford community. I le has
the experience and commitment to do a
phenomenal job in office.
Today and tomorrow we have the
choice of who to pick for ASSU president
and vice-president. It would be against
my principles to endorse a candidate, be
cause I believe that people who do not
make an effort to find out the differences
between the candidates should not rely on
hearsay (in this case, from me) to make
their choices.
But I would strongly urge students not to
disqualify a candidate merely because of an
unfounded negative impression.

Perry / Steinberg should
be taken seriously
In recent discussions of the upcoming
ASSU presidential elections, it seems that
candidates Adrian Perry and Matt Stein
berg of the Stanford Chaparral are not
viewed as legitimate candidates by most
people involved with the election. This
view is no doubt encouraged by their con
sistent use of satire as a part of their cam
paign strategy.
However, Perry and Steinberg are not
joking around; rather, they are demonstrat
ing the inherent impotence of the offices of
ASSU president and vice-president.
The institution of the ASSU is a useful
and vital part of student life at Stanford.
The ASSU is responsible for allocating
money to many deserving student groups
who use the funds productively to im
prove life for all of us. However, the par
ticular year-to-year makeup of the ASSU
in terms of personnel does not greatly af

feet the ASSU's ability to do its job. Rather,
the institutional value of the ASSU tran
scends yearly elections and changes in
composition.
It's no surprise that the same cam
paign issues come up year after year.
I bis is because ASSU presidential candi
dates consistently promise more than
they can deliver.
The limits of their constitutional author

ates in itself. None of these things are mag
ically learned, and none of them were pre
sented before us. They were all things that
we had to learn over the course of the year.
The knowledge that we have collected,
the contacts we have made, and lessons we
have learned, have culminated in the
Latin American Studies resolution and the
Campaign for Accountability, which has
not yet been largely advertised since it was
the final project of our time in office and is
still largely a work in progress.
In writing the Latin American Studies
resolution, we worked closely with the
student representatives to the Faculty
Senate Committee for Undergraduate
Studies and with the students fighting to
save the program. Together we identi
fied three areas for improvement which
have been commented on as being very
constructive and useful by the deans of
Humanities and Sciences.
Third, the Faculty Diversity Task
Force came out of the Senate, not the ex
ecutive branch; despite what slates and
students have asserted. The NAACP has
done a great deal of the work that has
gone into this difficult issue, along with a
number of other students that have given
of their valuable time.
Fhe current president and vice-presi
dent of the ASSU have been extremely sup
portive, and Matt Brewer has given much
of his time to the task force, but it is an insult
to the students who have worked on the
committee to be so consistently ignored.
The Faculty Diversity Task Force was a
campaign promise by a senator, namely
myself, that came to fruition. Senators do
run on issues and do live up to them.
Fourth, student communication is a
two-way street. Students talk about "com
munication," not lecturing, which is what
I am doing now.
We have received three comments all
year. We have practically begged for com
ments this year at each of the three ASSU
outreach events in White Plaza. The new
Web site has a feedback button and all of
the senators' e-mail addresses are listed.
Two people have used it.
As far as outreach, we need to do a lot
more, but there was a Stanford Daily beat
writer at every Senate meeting and an ar
ticle in the Daily every Thursday. We an
nounced every meeting and the agenda
on the RA lists. Brewer and Vice-Presi
dent Christine Cordero put out an ASSU
newsletter and we sought student input
on the WRC issue through e-mail.
The Senate has a huge task to perform
and it is not always clear how to pursue it.
This is especially true for young groups
such as the Advocacy Committee. The work
that is necessary to make the Senate the
body it needs to be is huge, and will not be
fully accomplished in any one year, espe
cially with such a quick turnover.

This year's Senate did an incredible
amount of work and without any recogni
tion and most without pay. There is much
more that the Senate has done that cannot
be encapsulated in this letter, but none of
the Senators this year deserve some of the
irresponsible and ignorant criticisms that
have gone on during this campaign.

ASS LI Senator

Benson / Arimoto respond
to Undergraduate Senators
In a single meeting last November, the
Undergraduate Senate passed resolutions
from the Advocacy Committee endorsing
Stanford's "labor justice campaign" and, in
recognizing global warming as a "pressing
problem," calling on Stanford to obtain 25
percent of its energy from solar power by
2010. We'll let the readers decide whether
that was the best use of the Senate's time
and resources — especially when student
groups are being summarily put on proba
tion, our Board of Trustees lacks under
graduate or graduate representation, and
community centers are facing temporary
eviction from Old Union next year. In
deed, it's this type of behavior that has
caused the student body to become so disil
lusioned with the ASSU —and its why
we're committed to reforming student gov
ernment and the role of advocacy within it.
Specifically, we intend to work with the
incoming Senate to ensure that the Advoca
cy Committee does real work for all students
— something their new protocol doesn't ad
dress at all. As for the idea of ASSU Consti
tutional restrictions on our proposals: sug
gesting that the ASSU Executives have no
power to direct Senate business is like saying
President Bush can't get a tax cut plan
passed because he has no authority to intro
duce legislation to Congress. As ASSU Exec
utives, we'll work with allies in the incoming
Senate to make these changes — and in
talking with almost everyone currendy run
ning for Senate, we know a tremendous
portion of the incoming Senate does share
our goals for next year.
However, if the Senate Advocacy Com
mittee continues to waste time on one-sen
tence resolutions that don't have anything
to do with the immediate needs of the stu
dent body, we will:
• Use the power of the Executive
branch to veto unnecessary resolutions
that don't address issues important to
most students; a veto can only be overrid
den by 2/3 of the Senate (Article 111, Sec
tion 7, Part 4 of the ASSU Constitution).
• Work with Senators to create special
committees to work on specific issues the
Advocacy Committee refuses to address;
such a move requires only a majority vote
of the Senate (Article 11, Section I, Part 1 of
the ASSU Constitution).
• Use our power to create special exec
utive commissions that would examine
particular issues such as student represen
tation on the Board of Trustees (Article 111,
Sect ion 7, Part 3 of the ASSU Constitution).
1 liese student-led commissions (which
could be filled through the Nominations
Commission) would be chaired by one of
us and supported by the discretionary
money available to ASSU Executives.
We know some of those steps would be
bold; the continued waste of Senate time
and resources, however, would demand
nothing less.

AASA endorses Henestroza / Rodriguez
The secret ballot conducted at the most
recent AASA Town Hall — attended by
approximately 85 AASA members —
very clearly revealed a mandate for Moni
ca Henestroza and Nick Rodriguez. We
believe this slate follows in the tradition of
the last two ASSU executive slates with
experience both within the communities
and within the institutional framework of
the ASSU.
AASA believes it is in its interest and the
interest of the whole campus to continue
this same successful formula. Hie execu
tives needs an intimate and personal knowl
edge of communities to understand the is
sues of the diverse student population.
Two years ago, the proactive steps
taken by Seth Newton and Malia Villegas
to secure space and increased funding for
the community centers were successful lie
cause of their intimate knowledge, emo
tional investment and personal relation
ships within the communities. T his issue is
again very important to our communities
because the status of the community cen
ters is in jeopardy once again under the
University's renovation plans.
Students of color are often very politi
cized because our rights and comforts as
students often are most threatened. It is
critical for students of color to have repre
sentative leaders at the top of our student
government.
The executive slates must represent
our diversity, because sadly, it's one of our
only forums for student representation. I
do believe the executives need to be multi

faceted beyond students of color issues,
and the Henestroza/Rodriguez,
insider/outsider combination proves to be
the most balanced and qualified slate rep
resenting all students' concerns.
1 do not know Osofsky and Root. 1 do
not know Benson and Arimoto. As the
head of a major student organization with
over 700 sell-subscribed members, I find
this troublesome. 1 know my 112 riends head
ing the other minority organizations feel
the same way.
In contrast, I have had the privilege of
working throughout the year with Ro
driguez and especially Henestroza, and
their inspiring work speaks volumes to
their commitment to our communities' in
terests, issues and concerns. Your vote
matters — please choose wisely.

Arimoto exaggerates her experience at
the Women's Center
ASSU vice presidential candidate
Kendra Arimoto has stated repeatedly,
both at the candidates debate and on her
flyers, that she has worked and held lead
ership roles at the Women's Community
Center. Having been involved with the
women's community for the past three
years and having worked as a student stall
member at the Women's Community
Center for two years, I wish to clarify that
this is not the case.
Like many other women on this cam
pus, Kendra might have been, in some ca
pacity, involved with projects relating to
the women's community, such as the
Coalition Against Sexual Assault.
1 lowever, she has exaggerated her role
by describing herself as a leader in the
community.
MAJDA MUHIC

Arimoto responds to Muhic
As the President of the Coalition
Against Sexual Assault, coordinator of
this year's lake Back the Night, treasur
er of Stanford's V-Day Campaign, and
co-producer of the "Vagina Mono
logues," I've had the opportunity to

work with Lisa Moore, the assistant di
rector of the Women's Community Cen
ter, a number of times.
Because the center is included in the
Coalition against Sexual Assault, 1 want
ed to emphasize that I had experience as
a student leader working with the
Women's Center. To Majda's credit, she
is correct: my listed background does
imply more direct leadership at the
Women's Center, and I apologize for not
making that clear.

ASSU Vice-Presuleiilial Candidal?

"Think!" candidates disappointed
with Daily coverage
As members of Think! who were disap
pointed by the format of the debate and our
presentation in the Daily, we would like to
clarify our objectives.
First things first, we are not a group of
whimsical, blind and stoned idealists
running exclusively to rebel against the
current electoral system and without a
notion of what effect we could and would
have. Rather, we are idealists challeng
ing our own stigma, arguing that reform
does not have to begin at an ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate meeting or within
the administration. It begins with each
one of us, as long as we are willing to take
the time to think about it.
We are confident that even the most
dedicated students question the extent to
which they exert themselves for the
promise of a comfortable future. As an al
ternative, we encourage a comfortable
present, which can be so simply achieved
by slowing down by a step or two, getting
to know a neighbor and becoming a part
of an ever-growing, diverse, stimulating
community outside the classroom.
And while living in this comfort, we
should ask questions that challenge the
structures of living provided to us by our
school, our country, and our world. Why
do we hesitate to smile at passers-by? Who
cleans up after us on this beautiful cam
pus, and how are they treated? How is the
homeless issue being addressed in the
Bay Area? Why is the voting rate for our
demographic low and declining? What is
the true end to our stressful work and
sleepless nights?
While every moment is an opportunity
to learn, converse, and think, vve have or
ganized a few events to prompt dialogue
and challenge the norm as a larger group.
These include a smile campaign to en
courage friendly exchanges with
"strangers," informal gatherings with pro
fessors and students, and daily picnics in
White Plaza. Please check out our website
at "www.stanford.edu/group/think" to
find out more about who we are and what
we do.
And in the end, we only ask you to join us
in thinking and conversing. Even if you
don't join us, join a friend or stranger. You
will be surprised at how many of your neigh
bors and classmates have the same discon
tents, concerns, fears, joys and hopes as you
do. Please remember that there is so much
more going on personally, locally, regional
ly, nationally and globally than c lass. Pick up
your heads, open up your eyes, and think!
with us.

Osofsky endorsements not impartial
When I first saw that there were three let
ters in yesterday's Daily endorsing Michael
Osofsky and Megan Root for ASSU president
and vice-president, I wasn't sure what to
think initially.
But then I looked at two of the people
who wrote them: Pat Bomhack, one of
Root's good friends, and Anthony Berry
hill, Osofsky's fraternity brother at Sigma
Phi Epsilon. Suddenly the kind words of
these endorsements seemed nothing more
than sleazy pitches from some of the c andi
date's friends meant to look like objective
nods of support from campus leaders and
regular joes.
But that's not surprising at all given how
many people I know that seem to have issues
with Osofsky's character. Bomhack attempt
ed to defend Osofsky in his letter yesterday,

calling widespread "character attacks" on
him "rumors."
Some time ago, I might have bought
Boml lac k's defense since no one seemed to
have any gocxl reason for disliking Osofsky,
even though such a large number seemed to.
But after finally asking my friends and ac
quaintances why they disliked Osofsky so
much, the answers 1 heard thoroughly con
vinced me that while Osofsky might be an
otherwise qualified candidate, he is not at all
the kind of person who deserves to be in any
kind of representative office.
Suddenly 1 understood why so many
people have ill feelings towards this man.
But still I wouldn't have been inclined to
write until I saw the shameless acts of
112 riends of his campaign in writing letters in
yesterday's Daily.
A recommendation fora candidate, writ
ten by a friend or acquaintance in an "ob
jective" style reeks of conflict of interest. I
don't care what qualifications he and his
running mate have in terms of experience
or connections, or how reasonable their
platform may sound.
This pair does not deserve to be ASSU
president and vice-president, plain and
simple.

Junior supports Osofsky
Does anyone who isn't running for office
or supporting someone who is really care
about the ASSU elections? Is theASSU even
representative of the student body? How
many engineers are in the ASSU?
I n a sch< x >1 where at least a gtxxl quarter of
the undergraduates are majoring in engi
neering, one would hope that the same pro
portion are in office. But of course tiiat isn't
I rue. After all, theASSU seems to appeal to the
political types who want to boost their resumes
before heading out into the world.
As a junior, I've never really voted in one
of these elections. Who really cares?
However, this past year I've gotten to
know one (>f the candidates in this year's elec
tion: Mike Osofsky. He's an interesting guy.
There have been various rumors and thinly
veiled campaigns against him by various
sources with the Chappie, perhaps, being
one of them. I've been deeply disappointed
at times with the reactions of many Stanford
students to unfounded hearsay.
I've seen Osofsky act with integrity and

ethics, and I've seen him defend issues and
people who were decidedly unpopular at the
time. I've seen him work 20-hour days for
theASSU in order to get things done. I must
admit, at times, I've not been exactly sin e ol
the efficacy of the means or the usefulness of
the cause, but at least you can't blame the lac k
oftrying.
1 .ike most of you, I've seen the big hoopla
the Chappie made in their stories on Osof
sky. In the past week, I've even seen Web
sites, flyers, and boards with random stu
dents, who don't even know Mike, talking
about his character.
As a person who knows him, I think hav
ing him as the ASSU president would be
great for the Stanford community. I le has
the experience and commitment to do a
phenomenal job in office.
Today and tomorrow we have the
choice of who to pick for ASSU president
and vice-president. It would be against
my principles to endorse a candidate, be
cause I believe that people who do not
make an effort to find out the differences
between the candidates should not rely on
hearsay (in this case, from me) to make
their choices.
But I would strongly urge students not to
disqualify a candidate merely because of an
unfounded negative impression.

Perry / Steinberg should
be taken seriously
In recent discussions of the upcoming
ASSU presidential elections, it seems that
candidates Adrian Perry and Matt Stein
berg of the Stanford Chaparral are not
viewed as legitimate candidates by most
people involved with the election. This
view is no doubt encouraged by their con
sistent use of satire as a part of their cam
paign strategy.
However, Perry and Steinberg are not
joking around; rather, they are demonstrat
ing the inherent impotence of the offices of
ASSU president and vice-president.
The institution of the ASSU is a useful
and vital part of student life at Stanford.
The ASSU is responsible for allocating
money to many deserving student groups
who use the funds productively to im
prove life for all of us. However, the par
ticular year-to-year makeup of the ASSU
in terms of personnel does not greatly af

feet the ASSU's ability to do its job. Rather,
the institutional value of the ASSU tran
scends yearly elections and changes in
composition.
It's no surprise that the same cam
paign issues come up year after year.
I bis is because ASSU presidential candi
dates consistently promise more than
they can deliver.
The limits of their constitutional author
ity, combined with the financial and logisti
cid constraints placed on the annually elect
ed officers, make it nearly impossible for the
ASSU President and Vice-President to ef
fect any major, permanent changes to the
University.
While student representation in the
University administration is important,
it seems all the ASSU needs at its head
are individuals who will not permanent
ly damage the ability of the ASSU to ful
fill its natural functions of allocating
money to student groups and enhancing
student representation on University
committees.
Despite their lack of direct experi
ence, Perry and Steinberg have shown
through their spot-on satire that they
know what theASSU is really about. For
example, Perry and Steinberg's proposal
to solve the campus space crunch by
making existing buildings taller has
about as much chance of being enacted
within the confines of the General Use
Permit as any other proposal that in
volves new construction.
Perry and Steinberg's "Bad Idiot
Hats," which they promise to wear when
they make a mistake, will provide just as
much accountability as currently exists in
theASSU.
Perry and Steinberg are legitimate can
didates who are just as capable as any of the
other candidates in this election.
Students will be more likely to care about
campus issues if they are presented in an
entertaining light — an area in which Perry
and Steinberg consistently rise above the
other candidates. We urge you to reconsid
er Perry and Steinberg for ASSU president
and vice-president because, after all, some
times all you need is someone to throw the
goddamn touchdown pass.

Dean Moogle endorses
Perry / Steinberg slate
When I first learned that Adrian Perry
and Matt Steinberg were running for the
ASSU president and vice-president respec
tively, I was alarmed because of their rebel
lious image and hyper-popularity amongst
the students. Now that I have seen them per
form so admirably in the campaigning pro
cess and Steinberg has stopped breaking
desks and windows around campus, I would
like to officially endorse them.
1 am reminded of the time that Adrian
threw the touchdown pass in the home
coming game against Lincoln High. The
crowd rushed the field that day and held
him high upon their shoulders as a cham
pion. A tear slowly trickled down my nor
mally steadfast scowl, and for just that one
moment, I knew he had something more to
offer to this school than those rock hard abs
and shotgun arm.
When the two began to chant "Dean
Moogle, No! No! No!" at the presidential
debate, 1 knew that deep down they mean,
"Dean Moogle, Yes! Yes! Yes!"
I thus tender my endorsement for the
duo, and wish them the best of luck.
On another note, if I could see MikeOsof

my office later today, 1 ve had some reports of
tomfoolery. You will be punished.

Undergraduate Senators
respond to Benson / Arimoto
As students with ASSU knowledge
and Student Advocacy experience, we
believe it necessary to clarify the miscon
ceptions about the Student Advocacy
Committee that the Benson / Arimoto
presidential slate is advertising.
Like the United States, the ASSU sep
arates the legislative and executive
branches; while the vice-president is au
thorized to break ties regarding the Sen
ate's overall decisions, neither the Presi
dent nor the vice-president have power
over the individual committees within
the Senate.
The published ideas of the
Benson/Arimoto campaign regarding
ASSU reform are thereby inconsistent
with the ASSU Constitution, and the re
forms the two are proposing have al
ready been made.
As opposed to a mere "one-sentence
resolution" which the Benson/Arimoto
campaign is asserting, our committee's af
firmative action resolution was actually
substantially rearticulated and expanded.
Indeed, recognizing the need fora clear
er resolution protocol, the Senate met on
Dec. 2 to create a new one, which requires
that the author of a resolution must in
clude a substantial amount of information
— including background, arguments and
counter-arguments, and a Constitutional
analysis — before the Senate will even
consider it.
Details of the discussions leading up
to this policy are available under the
meeting minutes on the ASSU Web site,
as well as at assu.stanford.edu/an
nouncements. All the resolutions the
Senate has since passed have followed
the new guidelines.
If any presidential slates want to re
form the Student Advocacy Committee,
they should run for the Senate.

ASSU Undergraduate Senators

Undergraduate Senate is
an effective body
The ASSU has been accused of a lack of
communication with the students by just
about everyone. This, to some extent, is a
very valid assertion, and is probably the
reason why so many candidates and stu
dents are making ignorant assertions. So,
as a Senator, I am going to communicate
with you now.
There have been entirely too many
misrepresentations and misunderstand
ings of what the ASSU and specifically the
senate has done this year. The Senate has
worked incredibly hard to fix many of the
inefficiencies of the body. To name only a
few, there are now codified policies for
funding, a protocol for writing resolu
tions, an entirely revamped Web site, a
more extensive orientation for the sena
tors, and individual committee archives
that will be handed on to the next senate.

The second thing to realize is that the
Advocacy Committee is in only its second
year of existence, and really its first year of
real activity advocating for students. We
have had a number of gr owing pains over
the year, learning how exactly to do the job.
Knowing how to find the issues that af
fect students and how to effectively support
and push for them, which are each unique,
is difficult and tricky. This required learn
ing the way in which the University oper
ates in itself. None of these things are mag

University's renovation plans.
Students of color are often very politi
cized because our rights and comforts as
students often are most threatened. It is
critical for students of color to have repre
sentative leaders at the top of our student
government.
The executive slates must represent
our diversity, because sadly, it's one of our
only forums for student representation. I
do believe the executives need to be multi

faceted beyond students of color issues,
and the Henestroza/Rodriguez,
insider/outsider combination proves to be
the most balanced and qualified slate rep
resenting all students' concerns.
1 do not know Osofsky and Root. 1 do
not know Benson and Arimoto. As the
head of a major student organization with
over 700 sell-subscribed members, I find
this troublesome. 1 know my 112 riends head
ing the other minority organizations feel
the same way.
In contrast, I have had the privilege of
working throughout the year with Ro
driguez and especially Henestroza, and
their inspiring work speaks volumes to
their commitment to our communities' in
terests, issues and concerns. Your vote
matters — please choose wisely.

Arimoto exaggerates her experience at
the Women's Center
ASSU vice presidential candidate
Kendra Arimoto has stated repeatedly,
both at the candidates debate and on her
flyers, that she has worked and held lead
ership roles at the Women's Community
Center. Having been involved with the
women's community for the past three
years and having worked as a student stall
member at the Women's Community
Center for two years, I wish to clarify that
this is not the case.
Like many other women on this cam
pus, Kendra might have been, in some ca
pacity, involved with projects relating to
the women's community, such as the
Coalition Against Sexual Assault.
1 lowever, she has exaggerated her role
by describing herself as a leader in the
community.

Arimoto responds to Muhic
As the President of the Coalition
Against Sexual Assault, coordinator of
this year's lake Back the Night, treasur
er of Stanford's V-Day Campaign, and
co-producer of the "Vagina Mono
logues," I've had the opportunity to

work with Lisa Moore, the assistant di
rector of the Women's Community Cen
ter, a number of times.
Because the center is included in the
Coalition against Sexual Assault, 1 want
ed to emphasize that I had experience as
a student leader working with the
Women's Center. To Majda's credit, she
is correct: my listed background does
imply more direct leadership at the
Women's Center, and I apologize for not
making that clear.

"Think!" candidates disappointed
with Daily coverage
As members of Think! who were disap
pointed by the format of the debate and our
presentation in the Daily, we would like to
clarify our objectives.
First things first, we are not a group of
whimsical, blind and stoned idealists
running exclusively to rebel against the
current electoral system and without a
notion of what effect we could and would
have. Rather, we are idealists challeng
ing our own stigma, arguing that reform
does not have to begin at an ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate meeting or within
the administration. It begins with each
one of us, as long as we are willing to take
the time to think about it.
We are confident that even the most
dedicated students question the extent to
which they exert themselves for the
promise of a comfortable future. As an al
ternative, we encourage a comfortable
present, which can be so simply achieved
by slowing down by a step or two, getting
to know a neighbor and becoming a part
of an ever-growing, diverse, stimulating
community outside the classroom.
And while living in this comfort, we
should ask questions that challenge the
structures of living provided to us by our
school, our country, and our world. Why
do we hesitate to smile at passers-by? Who
cleans up after us on this beautiful cam
pus, and how are they treated? How is the
homeless issue being addressed in the
Bay Area? Why is the voting rate for our
demographic low and declining? What is
the true end to our stressful work and
sleepless nights?
While every moment is an opportunity
to learn, converse, and think, vve have or
ganized a few events to prompt dialogue
and challenge the norm as a larger group.
These include a smile campaign to en
courage friendly exchanges with
"strangers," informal gatherings with pro
fessors and students, and daily picnics in
White Plaza. Please check out our website
at "www.stanford.edu/group/think" to
find out more about who we are and what
we do.
And in the end, we only ask you to join us
in thinking and conversing. Even if you
don't join us, join a friend or stranger. You
will be surprised at how many of your neigh
bors and classmates have the same discon
tents, concerns, fears, joys and hopes as you
do. Please remember that there is so much
more going on personally, locally, regional
ly, nationally and globally than c lass. Pick up
your heads, open up your eyes, and think!
with us.

Osofsky endorsements not impartial
When I first saw that there were three let
ters in yesterday's Daily endorsing Michael
Osofsky and Megan Root for ASSU president
and vice-president, I wasn't sure what to
think initially.
But then I looked at two of the people
who wrote them: Pat Bomhack, one of
Root's good friends, and Anthony Berry
hill, Osofsky's fraternity brother at Sigma
Phi Epsilon. Suddenly the kind words of
these endorsements seemed nothing more
than sleazy pitches from some of the c andi
date's friends meant to look like objective
nods of support from campus leaders and
regular joes.
But that's not surprising at all given how
many people I know that seem to have issues
with Osofsky's character. Bomhack attempt
ed to defend Osofsky in his letter yesterday,

calling widespread "character attacks" on
him "rumors."
Some time ago, I might have bought
Boml lac k's defense since no one seemed to
have any gocxl reason for disliking Osofsky,
even though such a large number seemed to.
But after finally asking my friends and ac
quaintances why they disliked Osofsky so
much, the answers 1 heard thoroughly con
vinced me that while Osofsky might be an
otherwise qualified candidate, he is not at all
the kind of person who deserves to be in any
kind of representative office.
Suddenly 1 understood why so many
people have ill feelings towards this man.
But still I wouldn't have been inclined to
write until I saw the shameless acts of
112 riends of his campaign in writing letters in
yesterday's Daily.
A recommendation fora candidate, writ
ten by a friend or acquaintance in an "ob
jective" style reeks of conflict of interest. I
don't care what qualifications he and his
running mate have in terms of experience
or connections, or how reasonable their
platform may sound.
This pair does not deserve to be ASSU
president and vice-president, plain and
simple.

Junior supports Osofsky
Does anyone who isn't running for office
or supporting someone who is really care
about the ASSU elections? Is theASSU even
representative of the student body? How
many engineers are in the ASSU?
I n a sch< x >1 where at least a gtxxl quarter of
the undergraduates are majoring in engi
neering, one would hope that the same pro
portion are in office. But of course tiiat isn't
I rue. After all, theASSU seems to appeal to the
political types who want to boost their resumes
before heading out into the world.
As a junior, I've never really voted in one
of these elections. Who really cares?
However, this past year I've gotten to
know one (>f the candidates in this year's elec
tion: Mike Osofsky. He's an interesting guy.
There have been various rumors and thinly
veiled campaigns against him by various
sources with the Chappie, perhaps, being
one of them. I've been deeply disappointed
at times with the reactions of many Stanford
students to unfounded hearsay.
I've seen Osofsky act with integrity and

ethics, and I've seen him defend issues and
people who were decidedly unpopular at the
time. I've seen him work 20-hour days for
theASSU in order to get things done. I must
admit, at times, I've not been exactly sin e ol
the efficacy of the means or the usefulness of
the cause, but at least you can't blame the lac k
oftrying.
1 .ike most of you, I've seen the big hoopla
the Chappie made in their stories on Osof
sky. In the past week, I've even seen Web
sites, flyers, and boards with random stu
dents, who don't even know Mike, talking
about his character.
As a person who knows him, I think hav
ing him as the ASSU president would be
great for the Stanford community. I le has
the experience and commitment to do a
phenomenal job in office.
Today and tomorrow we have the
choice of who to pick for ASSU president
and vice-president. It would be against
my principles to endorse a candidate, be
cause I believe that people who do not
make an effort to find out the differences
between the candidates should not rely on
hearsay (in this case, from me) to make
their choices.
But I would strongly urge students not to
disqualify a candidate merely because of an
unfounded negative impression.

Perry / Steinberg should
be taken seriously
In recent discussions of the upcoming
ASSU presidential elections, it seems that
candidates Adrian Perry and Matt Stein
berg of the Stanford Chaparral are not
viewed as legitimate candidates by most
people involved with the election. This
view is no doubt encouraged by their con
sistent use of satire as a part of their cam
paign strategy.
However, Perry and Steinberg are not
joking around; rather, they are demonstrat
ing the inherent impotence of the offices of
ASSU president and vice-president.
The institution of the ASSU is a useful
and vital part of student life at Stanford.
The ASSU is responsible for allocating
money to many deserving student groups
who use the funds productively to im
prove life for all of us. However, the par
ticular year-to-year makeup of the ASSU
in terms of personnel does not greatly af

feet the ASSU's ability to do its job. Rather,
the institutional value of the ASSU tran
scends yearly elections and changes in
composition.
It's no surprise that the same cam
paign issues come up year after year.
I bis is because ASSU presidential candi
dates consistently promise more than
they can deliver.
The limits of their constitutional author
ity, combined with the financial and logisti
cid constraints placed on the annually elect
ed officers, make it nearly impossible for the
ASSU President and Vice-President to ef
fect any major, permanent changes to the
University.
While student representation in the
University administration is important,
it seems all the ASSU needs at its head
are individuals who will not permanent
ly damage the ability of the ASSU to ful
fill its natural functions of allocating
money to student groups and enhancing
student representation on University
committees.
Despite their lack of direct experi
ence, Perry and Steinberg have shown
through their spot-on satire that they
know what theASSU is really about. For
example, Perry and Steinberg's proposal
to solve the campus space crunch by
making existing buildings taller has
about as much chance of being enacted
within the confines of the General Use
Permit as any other proposal that in
volves new construction.
Perry and Steinberg's "Bad Idiot
Hats," which they promise to wear when
they make a mistake, will provide just as
much accountability as currently exists in
theASSU.
Perry and Steinberg are legitimate can
didates who are just as capable as any of the
other candidates in this election.
Students will be more likely to care about
campus issues if they are presented in an
entertaining light — an area in which Perry
and Steinberg consistently rise above the
other candidates. We urge you to reconsid
er Perry and Steinberg for ASSU president
and vice-president because, after all, some
times all you need is someone to throw the
goddamn touchdown pass.

Dean Moogle endorses
Perry / Steinberg slate
When I first learned that Adrian Perry
and Matt Steinberg were running for the
ASSU president and vice-president respec
tively, I was alarmed because of their rebel
lious image and hyper-popularity amongst
the students. Now that I have seen them per
form so admirably in the campaigning pro
cess and Steinberg has stopped breaking
desks and windows around campus, I would
like to officially endorse them.
1 am reminded of the time that Adrian
threw the touchdown pass in the home
coming game against Lincoln High. The
crowd rushed the field that day and held
him high upon their shoulders as a cham
pion. A tear slowly trickled down my nor
mally steadfast scowl, and for just that one
moment, I knew he had something more to
offer to this school than those rock hard abs
and shotgun arm.
When the two began to chant "Dean
Moogle, No! No! No!" at the presidential
debate, 1 knew that deep down they mean,
"Dean Moogle, Yes! Yes! Yes!"
I thus tender my endorsement for the
duo, and wish them the best of luck.
On another note, if I could see MikeOsof
sky, Josh Benson, and Monica Henestroza in
my office later today, 1 ve had some reports of
tomfoolery. You will be punished.

Homecoming queen endorses
Perry/Steinberg
The ASSU needs leadership. The exact
kind of leadership Adrian Perry and Matt
Steinberg bring to the table. I will never for
get homecoming '87. It was against Lincoln
High and, well, you know the story. Let's
just say Adrian scored after the game as well
as during.
From a cheerleader's perspective
(cheer-spective) Adrian is great because he
gives me lots to cheer about. Like Touch
downs. Imagine how many leg kicks I will
get to do if he's president. It will be a lot.
And that is good for everybody.
Vote Perry/Steinberg! Tangible, tangi
ble, tangible.
