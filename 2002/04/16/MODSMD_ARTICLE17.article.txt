# ASSU officers respond
## 
### HENRY TOWSNER ALEX SHVARTSMAN GUEST COLUMNISTS 
To be honest, the responses all the ASSU
Presidential slates gave to the questions we
asked in Friday's Daily were somewhat dis
appointing. We had hoped that they would
take this opportunity not to reiterate their
slogans, but to think more broadly about
how to translate their platforms into results.
Unsurprisingly, every slate tried to twist
the question to lead into their favorite topic,
with a few digs at the other slates thrown in.
Nonetheless, most of the responses did ad
dress the questions accurately, and every
slate demonstrated that its understanding
of the issues went beyond what's written on
their Web pages.
We evaluated the responses based on
their factual accuracy and compatibility
with the operations of the ASSU.
Question 1: All of the candidates showed
familiarity with the Constitutional limits on
ASSU and Presidential advocacy of issues,
and proposed similar methods for address
ing them.
Question 2: While two of the slates seemed
clear on the distribution of power within
the University, the Benson/Arimoto slate
claimed that the Board of Trustees controls
almost every University decision. Ironical
ly, aside from their proposal to put students
on the Board of Trustees, only one of their
issues (graduate housing) might be ad
dressed by the Board.
The Osofsky/Root campaign took the
opportunity to mention their plans to ex
pand student representation. While their
proposal fora Web-based forum is interest
ing, it is one which the Senate Advocacy
Committee and the Nominations Commis
sion have previously discussed and rejected
out of concerns that it was too passive to
substitute for active communication with
students.
Question 3: All three slates made similar
proposals, of varying detail, for finding
more student space. The only mistake was
the claim, made by Henestroza/Rodriguez,
that using academic space during non-aca
demic hours would cost nothing to the Uni
versity. In fact, Stanford would still have to
pay expenses such as light, heating, and
janitorial service.
Question 4: Benson/Arimoto took an ex

tremely tone in regards to
the Undergraduate Senate, threatening to
bypass it entirely if their visions diverged.
This is obviously not conducive to complet
ing their ambitious plans.
At the opposite extreme was Hene
stroza/Rodriguez, who show too little back
bone in holding to their vision, ottering to
concede entirely in conflicts with the Senate.
Incidentally, both slates also made
promises to manipulate SSE's businesses, a
topic well out of Presidential authority.
Question 5: On the difficult question of
funding their projects, Henestroza/Ro
driguez propose to eliminate wasteful
spending. Unfortunately, the example
they offer (overpriced Law School chairs)
comes from a pool of money which could
not he used to fund the projects they are
proposing. In addition, they claim that
the University's tentative offer of an 80-
percent health-care subsidy proves the
University's ability to afford it. However,
that proposal was withdrawn precisely be
cause it was more expensive than origi
nally thought.
Question 6: I very slate this year is repeat
ing promises made in previous years.
Rather than offer ways they can build on
previous work, Benson/Arimoto simply cite
student support for their issues to justify the
feasibility of their campaign. However,
given that many of their issues were raised
as recently as last year, student support
alone is not sufficient.
As the Think! campaign is focused on
raising awareness rather then winning the
election, their responses did not directly ad
dress the questions. I lowever, we strongly
feel that issues raised by the Think! cam
paign are important for students in general,
and particularly the winners of this election.
With 13,000 opinions to consider, the best
time to start is now.

Editor's Note: Shvartswaii is a supporter of the
Osofsky/Root slate and Towsner is a supporter
of the Henestroza/Rodriguez slate. However,
both pledged to write this column neutrally and
fairly to all candidates. This column is in re
