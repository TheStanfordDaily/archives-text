nior year to go.

Saturday: No. 2 Stanford 14, UC-
Davis 3

against California on Friday.
In her last game at t he Avery Aquatics
Center, the senior driver scored four
goals to lead the No. 2 Stanford women's
water polo team to a 7-4 win over Cal in
the Big Splash. Dingeldein added anoth
er goal in the Cardinal's 14-3 win at UC-
Davis on Sunday.
"It was really fun because we were not
only playing Cal, but it was a night game
and it was pretty crowded," Dingeldein
said. "It was also very sad for me, but I just
had to go into the game not thinking
about that and focusing on how important
it was for us in terms of the conference
tournament. There was just a lot of ener
gy that night."

The No. 4 Golden Bears (14-7, 7-3

on the board first with a goal less than a
minute into the game.
Hut the Cardinal (18-1,9-1) resounding
ly responded with six unanswered goals.
The first three Stanford goals came
from Dingeldein, pushing the Cardinal to
4-1 halftime lead.
In the second half, Dingeldein's fourth
goal and sophomore driver Brenda
Villa's second score increased Stanford's
lead to 6-1.
Cal responded with goals from Ericka
Lorenz and Brenna Fleener in the fourth
quarter, but a goal by Stanford senior two
meter defender Kate Petit ended the
Bears' comeback attempt.
"It was a very exciting game for ns se
niors, but we had to approach it like any
other game," said senior two-meter de
fender Ellen Estes. "I {hink that Margie
did what she 1 always does. She has fun
playing with the team and she plays hard.
She counters well and always tries her
best. Things just came together and hap
pened perfectly."

Davis fora non-conference matchup with
the Aggies, but the trip hardly seemed
worthwhile by the end of the first half.

halftime break.
The Aggies finally managed to
beat (lie Cardinal defense to score
three times in the second hall, but
the Cardinal tallied four more to
close out a 14-!J win.

most of the damage as driver Jea
