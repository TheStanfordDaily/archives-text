As the postseason approaches for
women's tennis, players and teams
around the country have to be wonder
ing if defending NCAA champion Stan
ford can be stopped.

WOMEN'S TENNIS

Friday: No. 3 Stanford defeated No.
21 Arizona, 7-0
Saturday: No. 3 Stanford defeated
No. 9 Arizona State, 7-0

If this past weekend was any indica
tion, the answer is probably "No."
The No. 3 Cardinal (19-1, 6-0 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) had little trouble dis
patching two of the better teams in the
Pac-10 — including one of the top 10
teams in the country — last weekend in
its last home matches.
The team blanked No. 21 Arizona
(10-9, 3-3) and No. 9 Arizona State (12-
6,3-3) to extend its winning streak to 14
matches. Twelve of the Cardinal's 19
victories this year have been by 7-0
margins.
"It's definitely just an indication of
how well we're playing," senior Lauren
Kalvaria said.
On Friday against Arizona, the Cardi
nal jumped out to an early lead by easily
capturing all three doubles matches.
Stanford's No. 2 duo of Kalvaria and
senior Cabriela Lastra outplayed Ari
zona's No. 13 Maja Mlakar and Debbie
Larocque, 8-3. No. 14 sophomore Lau
ren Barnikow and freshman Erin Bur
dette put away Laresa Marino and
Marie-Pier Pouliot, 8-2, and senior
Keiko Tokuda and freshman Story

Tweedie-Yates handled Dianne Hol
lands and Brooke Taylor, 8-2.
Singles play was just as lopsided, as
Stanford took all six flights in straight sets.
No. 10 Kalvaria dominated No. 13
Mlakar, 6-1, 6-2; No. 18 Lastra similarly
shut down No. 87 Debbie Larocque, 6-0,
6-1; and No. 14 Barnikow beat Hollands,
7-6 (5), 6-1.
The bottom half of the lineup was
equally successful, as No. 24 Burdette
took care of Perrine Pernin, 6-1, 6-4;

Tokuda defeated Pouliot, 6-4, 6-3; and
sophomore Emilia Anderson shut out
Taylor, 6-0, 6-0.
"It was just so much easier playing
here at our home courts," Tokuda said.
"It was a very routine match."
Saturday's contest was more challeng
ing, but Stanford proved its dominance
in the end.

8-4. Barnikow arid Burdette,
though, suffered through some in
consistent play and were upset by
Mhairi Brown and Cindy Sureep

Fortunately, Tokuda and
Tweedie-Yates battled past Lau
ren Colalillo and Megan Yeats.
After losing an epic match point at
7-6, the Stanford pair rallied back
to claim the 9-8 (7-5) victory.
"We were really determined to
come out there and play a better
doubles," Kalvaria said, referring
to the Cardinal's March 8 match
against the Sun Devils, during
which Stanford dropped the
doubles point.
Throughout the year, the dou
bles point has occasionally given
the Cardinal trouble, partially be
cause of the inexperience of the
bottom two teams —although first
flight mates Kalvaria and Lastra
have been playing doubles togeth
er since they were 16 years old.
"Some of the girls have only
been together fora few months, so
it's difficult," Kalvaria said.
"Everyone's really sure of their
singles game," Tokuda explained.
"But in doubles, because it's short

er, you've got to start off really
quick, and there's a lot of uncer
tainty [about how one's partner
will play]."
In addition to the shorter
length, doubles demands differ
ent skills.
"There's a little natural ability
to it," Kalvaria said. "You have to
have quick hands, soft hands, and
see things a shot beforehand, to be
a little more aware of your sur
roundings than in singles."
Stanford went into singles
armed with the 1-0 team point ad
vantage, but as usual, the Cardinal
stepped it up in singles.
Kalvaria outplayed No. 20 Adria
Engel, 6-3, 6-2; Lastra dismantled
the tall but lumbering No. 29
Krstulovic, 6-2, 7-5; and Barnikow
beat No. 74 Brown, 6-1,6-1.
On the back courts, No. 24 Bur

Sureephong, 6-7, 6-4, 10-5; Toku
da took care of Colalillo 6-3, 6-3;
and Anderson won against Jose
lynn Burkett, 6-1, 7-5.
"Everyone gave it their best,"
Tokuda said.
This upcoming weekend, the
Cardinal travels to Los Angeles to
take on No. 19 Southern Califor
nia and No. 8 UCLA in its final
regular season matches in what
may be the toughest weekend of
the entire dual match season.
"It's important to close it out

though, suffered through some in

Mhairi Brown and Cindy Sureep

Fortunately, Tokuda and
Tweedie-Yates battled past Lau
ren Colalillo and Megan Yeats.
After losing an epic match point at
7-6, the Stanford pair rallied back
to claim the 9-8 (7-5) victory.
"We were really determined to
come out there and play a better
doubles," Kalvaria said, referring
to the Cardinal's March 8 match
against the Sun Devils, during
which Stanford dropped the
doubles point.
Throughout the year, the dou
bles point has occasionally given
the Cardinal trouble, partially be
cause of the inexperience of the
bottom two teams —although first
flight mates Kalvaria and Lastra
have been playing doubles togeth
er since they were 16 years old.
"Some of the girls have only
been together fora few months, so
it's difficult," Kalvaria said.
"Everyone's really sure of their
singles game," Tokuda explained.
"But in doubles, because it's short

er, you've got to start off really
quick, and there's a lot of uncer
tainty [about how one's partner
will play]."
In addition to the shorter
length, doubles demands differ
ent skills.
"There's a little natural ability
to it," Kalvaria said. "You have to
have quick hands, soft hands, and
see things a shot beforehand, to be
a little more aware of your sur
roundings than in singles."
Stanford went into singles
armed with the 1-0 team point ad
vantage, but as usual, the Cardinal
stepped it up in singles.
Kalvaria outplayed No. 20 Adria
Engel, 6-3, 6-2; Lastra dismantled
the tall but lumbering No. 29
Krstulovic, 6-2, 7-5; and Barnikow
beat No. 74 Brown, 6-1,6-1.

"Everyone gave it their best,"
Tokuda said.
This upcoming weekend, the
Cardinal travels to Los Angeles to
take on No. 19 Southern Califor

regular season matches in what
may be the toughest weekend of
the entire dual match season.
"It's important to close it out
with two victories," Tokuda said.
As the postseason approaches for
women's tennis, players and teams
around the country have to be wonder

WOMEN'S TENNIS

Friday: No. 3 Stanford defeated No.
21 Arizona, 7-0
Saturday: No. 3 Stanford defeated
No. 9 Arizona State, 7-0

If this past weekend was any indica
tion, the answer is probably "No."
The No. 3 Cardinal (19-1, 6-0 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) had little trouble dis
patching two of the better teams in the
Pac-10 — including one of the top 10
teams in the country — last weekend in
its last home matches.
The team blanked No. 21 Arizona
(10-9, 3-3) and No. 9 Arizona State (12-
6,3-3) to extend its winning streak to 14
matches. Twelve of the Cardinal's 19
victories this year have been by 7-0
margins.
"It's definitely just an indication of
how well we're playing," senior Lauren
Kalvaria said.
On Friday against Arizona, the Cardi
nal jumped out to an early lead by easily
capturing all three doubles matches.
Stanford's No. 2 duo of Kalvaria and
senior Cabriela Lastra outplayed Ari
zona's No. 13 Maja Mlakar and Debbie
Larocque, 8-3. No. 14 sophomore Lau
ren Barnikow and freshman Erin Bur
dette put away Laresa Marino and
Marie-Pier Pouliot, 8-2, and senior
Keiko Tokuda and freshman Story

Tweedie-Yates handled Dianne Hol
lands and Brooke Taylor, 8-2.
Singles play was just as lopsided, as
Stanford took all six flights in straight sets.
No. 10 Kalvaria dominated No. 13
Mlakar, 6-1, 6-2; No. 18 Lastra similarly
shut down No. 87 Debbie Larocque, 6-0,
6-1; and No. 14 Barnikow beat Hollands,
7-6 (5), 6-1.
The bottom half of the lineup was
equally successful, as No. 24 Burdette
