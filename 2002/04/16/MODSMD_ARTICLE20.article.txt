As the postseason approaches for
women's tennis, players and teams
around the country have to be wonder
ing if defending NCAA champion Stan
ford can be stopped.

WOMEN'S TENNIS

Friday: No. 3 Stanford defeated No.
21 Arizona, 7-0
Saturday: No. 3 Stanford defeated
No. 9 Arizona State, 7-0

If this past weekend was any indica
tion, the answer is probably "No."
The No. 3 Cardinal (19-1, 6-0 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) had little trouble dis
patching two of the better teams in the
Pac-10 — including one of the top 10
teams in the country — last weekend in
its last home matches.
The team blanked No. 21 Arizona
(10-9, 3-3) and No. 9 Arizona State (12-
6,3-3) to extend its winning streak to 14
matches. Twelve of the Cardinal's 19
victories this year have been by 7-0
margins.
"It's definitely just an indication of
how well we're playing," senior Lauren
Kalvaria said.
On Friday against Arizona, the Cardi
nal jumped out to an early lead by easily
capturing all three doubles matches.
Stanford's No. 2 duo of Kalvaria and
senior Cabriela Lastra outplayed Ari
zona's No. 13 Maja Mlakar and Debbie
Larocque, 8-3. No. 14 sophomore Lau
ren Barnikow and freshman Erin Bur
dette put away Laresa Marino and
Marie-Pier Pouliot, 8-2, and senior
Keiko Tokuda and freshman Story

Tweedie-Yates handled Dianne Hol
lands and Brooke Taylor, 8-2.
Singles play was just as lopsided, as
Stanford took all six flights in straight sets.
No. 10 Kalvaria dominated No. 13
Mlakar, 6-1, 6-2; No. 18 Lastra similarly
shut down No. 87 Debbie Larocque, 6-0,
6-1; and No. 14 Barnikow beat Hollands,
7-6 (5), 6-1.
The bottom half of the lineup was
equally successful, as No. 24 Burdette
took care of Perrine Pernin, 6-1, 6-4;

Tokuda defeated Pouliot, 6-4, 6-3; and
sophomore Emilia Anderson shut out
Taylor, 6-0, 6-0.
"It was just so much easier playing
here at our home courts," Tokuda said.
"It was a very routine match."
Saturday's contest was more challeng
ing, but Stanford proved its dominance
in the end.
