### JERRY LU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After slugging through a pair of hard
fought Pacific 10 Conference matches
this weekend and securing two crucial
victories, the No. 6 Stanford men's tennis
team has certainly earned a breather.
Unfortunately, it isn't going to get
one just yet.
Following wins over Arizona State and
Arizona this weekend, Stanford (19-2, 5-
0 Pac-10) now faces No. 5 Pepperdine
(18-4) today at 1:30 in Taube Tennis
Center in its last non-conference match
of this year.
The Waves have had an excellent sea
son, including several easy wins last
week. In their final home match of the
season, the Waves demolished UNLV, 6-
1, extending an eight-match winning
streak and improving to 13-1 at home.

MEN'S TENNIS

Friday: No. 6 Stanford defeated Ari
zona State, 4-3
Saturday: No. 6 Stanford defeated
No. 59 Arizona, 6-1
Today: No. 6 Stanford vs. No. 5
Pepperdine, 1:30 p.m., Taube Family
Tennis Center

"Pepperdine is doing really well this
year," said head coach Dick Gould.
"They're a tough team ranked only
one below UCLA, so it should be a
good match."
But concern has been raised about the
staying power of Pep pen line's top play
er A1 Garland, currently ranked No. 1 in
the nation. On Saturday, UNLV's
Thomas Schneiter upset Garland, 3-6,6-
4, 7-6 (5). The day before, Garland

fought off two match points in a narrow
ly decided game against Fresno State's
Hector Almada.
Besides Garland, the other ranked
player on the Pepperdine squad is No. 64
Stefan Suter, who has been very solid re
cently, dropping only seven games in his
last two matches.
The Waves also boast three ranked
doubles teams, though Garland is a
part of two of the pairs. Pepperdine can
choose from No. 11 Suter and Se
bastien Graeff, No. 15 Garland and
Suter and No. 17 Garland and Johan
Berg. Graeff/Suter and Garland/
Berg will likely play today.
Saturday, Stanford managed a 4-3
win in a closely contested match at No. 38
Arizona State.
For only the second time this season in
