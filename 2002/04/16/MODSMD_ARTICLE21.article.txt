# No. 5 Waves wash up next for Card
## 
### JERRY LU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After slugging through a pair of hard
fought Pacific 10 Conference matches
this weekend and securing two crucial
victories, the No. 6 Stanford men's tennis
team has certainly earned a breather.
Unfortunately, it isn't going to get
one just yet.
Following wins over Arizona State and
Arizona this weekend, Stanford (19-2, 5-
0 Pac-10) now faces No. 5 Pepperdine
(18-4) today at 1:30 in Taube Tennis
Center in its last non-conference match
of this year.
The Waves have had an excellent sea
son, including several easy wins last
week. In their final home match of the
season, the Waves demolished UNLV, 6-
1, extending an eight-match winning
streak and improving to 13-1 at home.

MEN'S TENNIS

Friday: No. 6 Stanford defeated Ari
zona State, 4-3
Saturday: No. 6 Stanford defeated
No. 59 Arizona, 6-1
Today: No. 6 Stanford vs. No. 5
Pepperdine, 1:30 p.m., Taube Family
Tennis Center

"Pepperdine is doing really well this
year," said head coach Dick Gould.
"They're a tough team ranked only
one below UCLA, so it should be a
good match."
But concern has been raised about the
staying power of Pep pen line's top play
er A1 Garland, currently ranked No. 1 in
the nation. On Saturday, UNLV's
Thomas Schneiter upset Garland, 3-6,6-
4, 7-6 (5). The day before, Garland

fought off two match points in a narrow
ly decided game against Fresno State's
Hector Almada.
Besides Garland, the other ranked
player on the Pepperdine squad is No. 64
Stefan Suter, who has been very solid re
cently, dropping only seven games in his
last two matches.
The Waves also boast three ranked
doubles teams, though Garland is a
part of two of the pairs. Pepperdine can
choose from No. 11 Suter and Se
bastien Graeff, No. 15 Garland and
Suter and No. 17 Garland and Johan
Berg. Graeff/Suter and Garland/
Berg will likely play today.
Saturday, Stanford managed a 4-3
win in a closely contested match at No. 38
Arizona State.
For only the second time this season in
dual-match play, the Cardinal lost
the doubles point and was forced
to attempt to catch up in singles.
Compounding Stanford's
troubles, No. 57 Ryan Haviland
was injured with knee tendonitis
and did not play in this week
end's matches.
"We will not have a full lineup
fora while," Gould said. "In addi
tion to Haviland, [senior K.J.] Hip
pensteel re-strained a muscle in his
back, and [freshman] Sam [War
burg] is getting X-rays in his feet."
The top-ranked doubles pair
of juniors Scott Lipsky and David
Martin managed to outlast the
Sun Devils' No. 21 Mitchell
Bowen and Matt Klinger, 9-8 (3),
but the Cardinal dropped the
second and third doubles match
es, with Hippensteel and sopho
more Joe Kao falling, 8-5, and
the freshman pair of Phil Sheng
and Warburg losing, 8-3.
The Cardinal bounced back
from the doubles fiasco, scoring
four of six points in singles play.
"I think the guys have been
playing very well," Gould said.
K.J. avenged the loss he had ear
lier [to Klinger March 9]. Arizona
State can be a tough team to play
in singles and we did a good job."

Alter the close call in Tempe,
Stanford traveled to Tucson to
put away the Wildcats relatively
easily, 6-1.
This time around, Stanford held
the doubles point with victories
from Lipsky / Martin at the No. 1
position and Sheng / Warburg at
No. 3. Hippensteel / Kao, however,
lost a close match, falling 8-6.
"With Haviland out of the
lineup, we had to put Kao and
Hippensteel in together," Gould
said. "They have never played
together before, and we were not
able to practice. Joe showed im
provement between Friday and
Saturday, and they played a
good match."
As added insurance against a
Wildcat comeback, the Cardinal
went on to sweep the first
through fifth singles positions. In
a three-set marathon, Hippen
steel shut down No. 40 Stephen
Capriati, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, marking
his third straight victory over
top-50 rivals.
Sheng, playing at the No. 4 po
sition for only the second time,
also pulled off an impressive 6-4,
4-6, 6-2 win over Arizona's Carl
Hagman. With the victory, Sheng
improved to 9-9 in dual matches
this year.
Martin, Lipsky, and Warburg
all added to the Cardinal victory
list, with the lone loss coming from
Kao at No. 6 singles.

No. 4 K.J. Hippensteel won both his singles matches, helping No. 4 Stanford

"With Haviland out of the
lineup, we had to put Kao and
Hippensteel in together," Gould
said. "They have never played
together before, and we were not
able to practice. Joe showed im
provement between Friday and
Saturday, and they played a
good match."
As added insurance against a
Wildcat comeback, the Cardinal
went on to sweep the first
through fifth singles positions. In
a three-set marathon, Hippen
steel shut down No. 40 Stephen
Capriati, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, marking
his third straight victory over
top-50 rivals.
Sheng, playing at the No. 4 po
sition for only the second time,
also pulled off an impressive 6-4,
4-6, 6-2 win over Arizona's Carl
Hagman. With the victory, Sheng
improved to 9-9 in dual matches
this year.
Martin, Lipsky, and Warburg
all added to the Cardinal victory
list, with the lone loss coming from
Kao at No. 6 singles.

No. 4 K.J. Hippensteel won both his singles matches, helping No. 4 Stanford
defeat Arizona and Arizona State this weekend. Hippensteel defeated No.
40 Stephen Capriati of Arizona and the Sun Devils' No. 31 Matt Klinger.
After slugging through a pair of hard
fought Pacific 10 Conference matches
this weekend and securing two crucial
victories, the No. 6 Stanford men's tennis
team has certainly earned a breather.
Unfortunately, it isn't going to get
one just yet.
Following wins over Arizona State and
Arizona this weekend, Stanford (19-2, 5-
0 Pac-10) now faces No. 5 Pepperdine
(18-4) today at 1:30 in Taube Tennis
Center in its last non-conference match
of this year.
The Waves have had an excellent sea
son, including several easy wins last
week. In their final home match of the
season, the Waves demolished UNLV, 6-
1, extending an eight-match winning
streak and improving to 13-1 at home.

MEN'S TENNIS

Friday: No. 6 Stanford defeated Ari
zona State, 4-3
Saturday: No. 6 Stanford defeated
No. 59 Arizona, 6-1
Today: No. 6 Stanford vs. No. 5
Pepperdine, 1:30 p.m., Taube Family
Tennis Center

"Pepperdine is doing really well this
year," said head coach Dick Gould.
"They're a tough team ranked only
one below UCLA, so it should be a
good match."
But concern has been raised about the
staying power of Pep pen line's top play
er A1 Garland, currently ranked No. 1 in
the nation. On Saturday, UNLV's
Thomas Schneiter upset Garland, 3-6,6-
4, 7-6 (5). The day before, Garland

fought off two match points in a narrow
ly decided game against Fresno State's
Hector Almada.
Besides Garland, the other ranked
player on the Pepperdine squad is No. 64
Stefan Suter, who has been very solid re
cently, dropping only seven games in his
last two matches.
The Waves also boast three ranked
doubles teams, though Garland is a
part of two of the pairs. Pepperdine can
choose from No. 11 Suter and Se
bastien Graeff, No. 15 Garland and
Suter and No. 17 Garland and Johan
Berg. Graeff/Suter and Garland/
Berg will likely play today.
Saturday, Stanford managed a 4-3
win in a closely contested match at No. 38
Arizona State.
For only the second time this season in
dual-match play, the Cardinal lost
the doubles point and was forced
to attempt to catch up in singles.
Compounding Stanford's
troubles, No. 57 Ryan Haviland
was injured with knee tendonitis
and did not play in this week
end's matches.
"We will not have a full lineup
fora while," Gould said. "In addi
tion to Haviland, [senior K.J.] Hip
pensteel re-strained a muscle in his
back, and [freshman] Sam [War
burg] is getting X-rays in his feet."
The top-ranked doubles pair
of juniors Scott Lipsky and David
Martin managed to outlast the
Sun Devils' No. 21 Mitchell
Bowen and Matt Klinger, 9-8 (3),
but the Cardinal dropped the
second and third doubles match
es, with Hippensteel and sopho
more Joe Kao falling, 8-5, and
the freshman pair of Phil Sheng
and Warburg losing, 8-3.
The Cardinal bounced back
from the doubles fiasco, scoring
four of six points in singles play.
"I think the guys have been
playing very well," Gould said.
K.J. avenged the loss he had ear
lier [to Klinger March 9]. Arizona
State can be a tough team to play
in singles and we did a good job."

Alter the close call in Tempe,
Stanford traveled to Tucson to
put away the Wildcats relatively
easily, 6-1.
This time around, Stanford held
the doubles point with victories
from Lipsky / Martin at the No. 1
position and Sheng / Warburg at
No. 3. Hippensteel / Kao, however,
lost a close match, falling 8-6.
"With Haviland out of the
lineup, we had to put Kao and
Hippensteel in together," Gould
said. "They have never played
together before, and we were not
able to practice. Joe showed im
provement between Friday and
Saturday, and they played a
good match."
As added insurance against a
Wildcat comeback, the Cardinal
went on to sweep the first
through fifth singles positions. In
a three-set marathon, Hippen

Capriati, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, marking
his third straight victory over
top-50 rivals.
Sheng, playing at the No. 4 po
sition for only the second time,
also pulled off an impressive 6-4,
4-6, 6-2 win over Arizona's Carl
Hagman. With the victory, Sheng
improved to 9-9 in dual matches
this year.
Martin, Lipsky, and Warburg
all added to the Cardinal victory
list, with the lone loss coming from
