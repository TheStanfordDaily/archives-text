# Lax crushes Denver, Cal at Maloney Field

A disappointing 0-3 road trip
during spring break had left (he
Stanford women's lacrosse team
with the unpleasant task of starting
the quarter — and an important
stretch of Mountain Pacific
Lacrosse League matches — in
the midst of a four-game losing
streak. Fortunately, the Cardinal
players have been no strangers to
the spring quarter rejuvenation
that most Stanford students feel.
With two victories this weekend
the Stanford women (6-6, 6-0
MM.L) extended their post-spring
break winning streak to three. I lat
tricks by freshman attacker Claire
Calzonetti highlighted Friday's
10-4 win over California (9-4, 5-2)
and Sunday's 14-7 win over Den
ver (4-9, 3-5).
Against the Colden Bears on
Friday, Stanford controlled the
tempo for the entire game.
The Cardinal started off the
game on a five-goal run and never
lost control from there. Calzonetti
put Stanford on the scoreboard
just 20 seconds into the game.

Stanford came out slow and un
organized — far different from
the team it was against Cal on Fri
day — as midfield passes did not
connect, shots were missing the
net and the defense was having
problems stopping the Pioneers'

game, Denver was up 4-1.
Stanford attempted to battle

Just before halftime, Conte

more to take a 6-5 lead into the half.
"We fell behind in the first half,
mostly due to the fact that we
didn't come out ready to play,"
said senior attacker Liz Britt. "We
made a conscious decision at half
time to change our game. We did
that for most of the second half
through better, smarter passing
and disciplined defense."
Stanford came back for the sec

Hills started off the half with a goal
