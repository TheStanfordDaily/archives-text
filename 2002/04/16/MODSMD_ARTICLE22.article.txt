A disappointing 0-3 road trip
during spring break had left (he
Stanford women's lacrosse team
with the unpleasant task of starting
the quarter — and an important
stretch of Mountain Pacific
Lacrosse League matches — in
the midst of a four-game losing
streak. Fortunately, the Cardinal
players have been no strangers to
the spring quarter rejuvenation
that most Stanford students feel.
With two victories this weekend
the Stanford women (6-6, 6-0
MM.L) extended their post-spring
break winning streak to three. I lat
tricks by freshman attacker Claire
Calzonetti highlighted Friday's
10-4 win over California (9-4, 5-2)
and Sunday's 14-7 win over Den
ver (4-9, 3-5).
Against the Colden Bears on
Friday, Stanford controlled the
tempo for the entire game.
The Cardinal started off the
game on a five-goal run and never
lost control from there. Calzonetti
put Stanford on the scoreboard
just 20 seconds into the game.

Larissa Conte and freshman mid
fielder Kelsey Twist kept the
transitions moving smoothly.
Stanford also had a strong
game on the defensive end, con
stantly bombarding the Bears with
double-teams and preventing Cal
scoring chances. 1 lie Cardinal
out-shot the Bears, 22-15.
Junior goalkeeper Virginia
Solomon played her usual aggres
sive style, departing from the cage
several times to chase down a loose
ball. Solomon notched eight saves
on the evening.
