"lfyou asked me two months ago if
I'd run tor the ASSU, the response
would have been a resounding 'No,'"
declared junior Monica Henestroza
with a smile.
But a few weeks ago, the response
( hanged a bit. I lenestroza's tenure for
the Stanford Labor Action Coalition
(she served as coordinator this year)
was coming to a close, and she was
looking lor something new lor her se
nior year.
So, when the Students of Color
Coalition asked I lenestroza to submit
her name lor the 2002 ASSU presi
dential race along with sophomore
Nic k Rodtigue'z, she decided to run,
seeing the ASSU as a c hance to consol
idate and focus her interests.
Though I lenestroza has lit tie ASSU
experience, Rodriguez has worked in
the organization. Currently co-chair
of the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
Student Life Committee, he has spent
the last year getting to know the body
from the inside.
"I've been fairly active in there,"
Rodriguez said. "I'veclone my shareol
pretty productive projects, but I've
also done a lot of learning."
An ASSU insider and an outsider,
"Nick and I were a good match of ide
alism and pragmatism," Henestroza
said, noting "Each of us was seeking to

Graduate students' quality of life is

a primary concern of the duo, and ii
promises to be a major issue in the
election.
Henestroza indicated the extent of
graduate students' financial problems
by noting that "(lie University was
pushing families to go on welfare" but
sugar-coating it, saying, "'It's public
assistance programs, not welfare.'"
Next year, Cardinal Care costs to
graduate students will jump between
40 and 50 percent, Henestroza said,
prompting Vice Provost lor Student
Affairs Cene Awakuni to address the
issue. Awakuni, she said, was able to
announce an SO percent increase in
graduate health care subsidies.
"The problem is, since then, the ad
ministration came back and said,
'Sorry, not SO percent, 40 percent,'"
she continued.
"Forty percent will just leave them
at the same point as last summer,"
Henestroza concluded. "All they're
doing is just not making things worse .
. . I he ultimate issue is that the status
quo is not enough."
Henestroza noted that her experi
ences examining workers' rights with
the coalition had parallels to the grad
uate student problems.
"For workers, it's wages. For gradu
ate students, it's stipends, health care,
child care," I lenestroza said.
Her successful negotiations with
the University for the workers would
parallel the work needed to gain ad-

Junior Monica Henestroza and sophomore Nick Rodriguez say they
want to focus the administration's attention on student needs, such as
high prices at on-campus merchants.
