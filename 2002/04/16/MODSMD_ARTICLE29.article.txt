True to their ASSI upbringing,

a University committee ol sorts.
"We talked to all the key people
over all the major organizations,"

dent Council members, among
others, to discover their opinions
on who they felt should pursue
the executive positions.

thought that Megan and I
would be a very representa

strong slate," he said.
They decided to run two weeks
before spring quarter, the two
said. .
Osofsky and Root are the only
pair of ASSU insiders running lor
the top slot. Though some stu

said they had a sense of the posi

ASSU," Osofsky said. "We have
an abilit) to reform the internal
structure."
