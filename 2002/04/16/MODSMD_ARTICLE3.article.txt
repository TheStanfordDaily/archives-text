# ASSU explains balloting process
## Electioneers tell how votes will be tallied tomorrow night 
### DEVON MAYLIE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In this year's close ASSU elec
tion, your vote counts — but
maybe not how yon think it does.
Due to instant runoff voting,
who you rank as your second or
third choices could determine
the winner.
The process works like this:
There are live slates running for
ASSU president and vice presi
dent this year. Voters will rank the
candidates first through fifth. The
first-place votes are then tabulat
ed. If no slate receives 50 percent
of the votes after the first-place
votes are tallied, then the slate

with the fewest first-place votes
will be eliminated.
Next, a program will re-count
the ballots that marked the elim
inated slate as first. The second
place votes will replace the origi
nal first choice.
If a slate still does not have 50
percent of the first-place votes,
then the slate with the next-fewest
votes is eliminated and the process
repeats itself. This is the second
year the ASSU has used instant
runoff voting.

"In 2001, Matt Brewer <yid
Christine Cordero received almost
twice as many votes as the runner
up, so they were the clear favorites,
but they did not have a majority
mandate, because the vote was
split among several other slates,"
said former Graduate Student
Council member Dave Robinson,
a doctoral student in chemistry.
"[Last year], the instant runoff
procedure eliminated the low
ranked slates, and found that
enough of their voters supported
Brewer and Cordero to give them
a majority, so the issue was effi
ciently put to rest," Robinson said.
Junior Gedioen Aloula, the
ASSU election commissioner,
added that "Instant runoff voting
is not just a yes-or-no voting
process. If your number one
choice does not win, you can still
contribute to the number two,
three and four by ranking."

Tim Riemann, tlie assistant
commissioner of elections and a
first-year law student, explained
what this means to voters.
"Essentially, the slate receiving
the voter's first-place ranking will
definitely receive the vote in the
first round," Riemann said.
" The slate receiving the voter's
fifth-place ranking will never re
ceive a [first-place] vote from that
voter. The slates receiving the
voter's second, third and fourth
place rankings may or may not ul
timately receive a [first-place] vote
from that voter depending on the
vote total for the slates ranked
higher by that individual voter."
Due to a controversial runoff
election in 2000, the votes are now
tallied through the computer
ranking system.

majority of the votes to win. As a
result, a runoff is often necessary.
In the old system, the top can
didates in a runoff would have to
campaign for an extra two weeks
after the original election and vot
ers would have to recast their bal
lots. But this process was time-con
suming and lead to a low voter
turnout of only 20 percent —half
the average general election
turnout —during runoff elections,
according to the ASSU.
A bill that instituted instant
runoff voting co-authored by
Robinson and Undergraduate Sen

ator Charlene Ng passed last year.
According to Robinson, the in
stant runoff voting simplified the
previous ASSU presidential elec
tion process.
Since the new election process
had been implemented, Robinson
said it is possible to determine the
winner without having voters re
cast their votes.
Many California counties are
starting to use instant runoff vot
ing as well. In March, San Fran
cisco voters approved an instant
runoff ballot measure and in
1998 Santa Clara County voters
authorized the use of instant
runoff voting.
