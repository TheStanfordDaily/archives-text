# Chappie seeks to win 'Popularity Contest'
## 
### JOHN HUETTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Vowing to return the ASSU
presidential election to its "pristine
form," juniors Adrian Perry and
Matt Steinberg entered the 2002
race.
"We believe that the ASSU pres
idential election should stay true to
its roots: the good, clean, popular
ity contest," the duo said.
"When Adrian first approached
me about running for ASSU presi
dent, I thought it was another one
of his practical jokes, like the time
he ran over my dog," Steinberg
said, but he said Perry had the
kind of "gleam in his eye" over the
election that he does before he
throws a touchdown pass or grabs
his girlfriend's thigh.
Thus, he ran with Perry. "Adri
an was the most popular boy in
school," Steinberg said, "Who was
I to say no as the school bully?"
In addition, Steinberg said, Dean
Moogle was going to kick him out of
school for "smokin' in the boys'
room" unless he did community
service. "I don't care about your
rules," he said to Dean Moogle. "I'm
gonna run for class president and
change your rules, Babylon."
Perry said he ran because that is
what popular kids do, along with
dating cheerleaders like his girl
friend Suzy Popular. He said they
met after he threw a touchdown
pass to win a football game for Lin
coln I ligh in 1985.
"Throw the goddamn TD pass,
baby," Perry said, and called it his
election strategy.
The duo did acknowledge that
campus elections have issues other
than popularity. They also pledged
a commitment to increasing ASSU
accountability to students.
"If we mess up," Steinberg said,

"we promise to wear hats that say
"Bad Idiot" in very big letters, with
terrible graphic design and no
surfer logos at all. We really do not
want to wear these hats. So we won't
screw up."
They will also put up a web
camera in the ASSU office that will
run nonstop and televise them as
sort of an "ASSU Odd Couple."
The two are so different, Steinberg
said, yet they get along so well.
They expect student interest to
be higher for this venture than for
other ASSU outreach projects be
cause they "are popular."
Forcing administrators to re
spond more to student concerns,
shaping up to be a key issue in the
election, was also addressed by
the pair.
"We will beat up Dean Moogle
until he gives everyone a living
wage," Steinberg said. "I made
Ricky Four-Eyes give me his living
wage every clay last year. 1 used it to
buy cigarettes and dog food for
Champ."
Perry broke away from the inter
view to throw a touchdown, win the
game against Lincoln 1 ligli, and set
a new school record for touchdown
passing on any given Sunday.
"Triple bling!" exclaimed
Perry upon his return, making up
a catch phrase in the "manner of
popular kids." The two plan to re
lease a set of such phrases, pre
sumably in the ASSU Newsletter,
as well as a more general list of
what's popular and what's not —
"causing much rioting and many
tears."
"Triple bling, dogg," Perry
said. "Triple bling."
They said their leadership expe
rience was developed at Space
(lamp. They said they broke orders
from Dean Moogle to launch a
shuttle when conditions were

cloudy, costing hundreds of dollars
in damage. However, due to their
action, a simulated baby in a simu
lated air shaft was saved, and the
two won Space Camper of the
Year.
"We loved Space Camp, and
Space Camp loved us," Steinberg
said.
Perry, guaranteed to win any
popularity contest, he said, attempt
ed to call the election oil. "Why is it
even happening?" he said.
The election will still occur on
Tuesday and Wednesday.
Approat liability is a major con
cern ol the duo.
"You can find | Perry] throwing
touchdown passes or in the back of
his three-wheeled Bronco with
[girlfriend] Suzy Popular," Stein
berg said. The odd, tricyclic Bron
co, the two revealed, epitomized

the type of financial savvy neces
sary in the ASSU.
"It was either one wheel or no
woofers," Perry said, "and no
snake cage in the back."
"(lliicks dig snakes," Perry con
tinued, nodding and smirking
knowingly.
"1 can be found leaning
against Dean Moogle's car look
ing mean, leaning against nu
merous hand rails with an uncon
cerned look, and carving my
name into various pieces of
school property and memorabil
ia," Steinberg added.
"If something gets on our desk
to do, it'll be in the 'done box' be
fore you can say, 'Is it done?"
Steinberg said. "Well, it is, and our
'done box,' is full."
"I ley, is your name Press Pass?"
Steinberg said. "Blow me."

he ran over my dog," Steinberg
said, but he said Perry had the
kind of "gleam in his eye" over the
election that he does before he
throws a touchdown pass or grabs
his girlfriend's thigh.
Thus, he ran with Perry. "Adri
an was the most popular boy in
school," Steinberg said, "Who was
I to say no as the school bully?"
In addition, Steinberg said, Dean
Moogle was going to kick him out of
school for "smokin' in the boys'
room" unless he did community
service. "I don't care about your
rules," he said to Dean Moogle. "I'm
gonna run for class president and
change your rules, Babylon."
Perry said he ran because that is
what popular kids do, along with
dating cheerleaders like his girl
friend Suzy Popular. He said they
met after he threw a touchdown
pass to win a football game for Lin
coln I ligh in 1985.
"Throw the goddamn TD pass,
baby," Perry said, and called it his
election strategy.
The duo did acknowledge that
campus elections have issues other
than popularity. They also pledged
a commitment to increasing ASSU
accountability to students.
"If we mess up," Steinberg said,

"we promise to wear hats that say
"Bad Idiot" in very big letters, with
terrible graphic design and no
surfer logos at all. We really do not
want to wear these hats. So we won't
screw up."
They will also put up a web
camera in the ASSU office that will
run nonstop and televise them as
sort of an "ASSU Odd Couple."
The two are so different, Steinberg
said, yet they get along so well.
They expect student interest to
be higher for this venture than for
other ASSU outreach projects be
cause they "are popular."
Forcing administrators to re
spond more to student concerns,
shaping up to be a key issue in the
election, was also addressed by
the pair.
"We will beat up Dean Moogle
until he gives everyone a living
wage," Steinberg said. "I made
Ricky Four-Eyes give me his living
wage every clay last year. 1 used it to
buy cigarettes and dog food for
Champ."
Perry broke away from the inter
view to throw a touchdown, win the
game against Lincoln 1 ligli, and set
a new school record for touchdown
passing on any given Sunday.
"Triple bling!" exclaimed
Perry upon his return, making up
a catch phrase in the "manner of
popular kids." The two plan to re
lease a set of such phrases, pre
sumably in the ASSU Newsletter,
as well as a more general list of
what's popular and what's not —
"causing much rioting and many
tears."
"Triple bling, dogg," Perry
said. "Triple bling."
They said their leadership expe
rience was developed at Space
(lamp. They said they broke orders
from Dean Moogle to launch a
shuttle when conditions were

cloudy, costing hundreds of dollars
in damage. However, due to their
action, a simulated baby in a simu
lated air shaft was saved, and the
two won Space Camper of the
Year.
"We loved Space Camp, and
Space Camp loved us," Steinberg
said.
Perry, guaranteed to win any
popularity contest, he said, attempt
ed to call the election oil. "Why is it
even happening?" he said.
The election will still occur on
Tuesday and Wednesday.
Approat liability is a major con
cern ol the duo.
"You can find | Perry] throwing
touchdown passes or in the back of
his three-wheeled Bronco with
[girlfriend] Suzy Popular," Stein
berg said. The odd, tricyclic Bron
co, the two revealed, epitomized

the type of financial savvy neces
sary in the ASSU.
"It was either one wheel or no
woofers," Perry said, "and no
snake cage in the back."
"(lliicks dig snakes," Perry con
tinued, nodding and smirking
knowingly.
"1 can be found leaning
against Dean Moogle's car look
ing mean, leaning against nu
merous hand rails with an uncon
cerned look, and carving my
name into various pieces of
school property and memorabil
ia," Steinberg added.
"If something gets on our desk
to do, it'll be in the 'done box' be
fore you can say, 'Is it done?"
Steinberg said. "Well, it is, and our
'done box,' is full."
"I ley, is your name Press Pass?"
Steinberg said. "Blow me."
