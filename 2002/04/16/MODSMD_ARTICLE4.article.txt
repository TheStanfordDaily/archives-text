nan will speak tonight on "Bring
ing the War on Terror to Iraq:
Will the Kurds be the Next North
ern Alliance" at7:3o p.m. in R(x>m
190 of the Law School
Nominated fora Pulitzer
Prize, McKiernan has made
more than a dozen trips to
Northern Iraq since the Gulf
War and completed a documen
tary film "Good Kurds, Bad
Kurds" in 2000.
The talk is sponsored by the
Charles Riddell Fund, the John
S. Knight Fellowship Program,
the ASSU Speaker's Bureau and
other campus organization.
"His very recent time in Iraq
should be of great interest to any
one who wants to understand
that part of the world," said Com
munication Prof. Jim Bettinger,
who is also the director of the
Knight Fellowship program at
Stanford.
Although the recent focus of
the U.S. media has been the con
flict between Israel and Palestine,
the Bush administration is now
debating how best to approach
the situation with Saddam Hus
sein in Iraq. A decision will likely
be reached by the end of this year.
McKiernan worked as a re
porter and producer in North
ern Iraq for ABC News. His focus
was determining whether the

Kurds could act like the North
ern Alliance of Afghanistan.
"Put simply, there is a possibil
ity that Bush, in trying to affect
political change in Iraq as part of
the war on terrorism, will use the
Kurdish people residing in
Northern Iraq, just as he used
the Northern Alliance in
Afghanistan against the Tal
iban," saifl Mary Stiles, public in
terest program coordinator at
the Law School.
Stiles said she hoped that
there would be a large turn out
for the event.
Bettinger explained why
McKiernan is a relevant speaker
given current world events.
"We're co-sponsoring because
we think that the perspective of a
journalist on the current
Mideast / Iraq situation is impor
tant," Bettinger said.
The Riddell Fund from the
Office of Residential Education is
the event's biggest sponsor.
"The intent of the Riddell
Fund is to enable visiting profes
sionals to share their expertise
through a major campus address
intended for the entire Stanford
community and through infor
mal interactions with undergrad
uates in the residences," said Eliz
abeth Hiyama, associate director
of Residential Education.
Kevin McKiernan's presenta
tion tonight was arranged
through the help of his daughter,
senior Caitrin McKiernan.
