Published Since 1891

Stanlord students have reason to celebrate
this year when it comes to selecting an ASSU
president and vice-president — the compet
ing slates are some of the strongest in re
cent memory. Students should resist the tempta
tion of apathy and vote. The Daily, after inter
viewing all live slates, endorses Josh Benson and
Kendra Arimoto.
Benson and Arimoto boast proven leadership
ability and valuable, first-hand knowledge of the
challenges, needs and functions of student groups
on campus. They bring a refreshing perspective
on the role of the ASSU vis-a-vis these organiza
tions. As members of the groups rather than the
ASSU, they see better what the ASSU can offer
these groups and how it can most help them.
Monica Henestroza and Nick Rodriguez dis
play an enthusiasm for student involvement in
University decision-making; Michael Osofsky and
Megan Root possess a proven track record of tan
gible accomplishments. In our opinion, however,
Benson and Arimoto know best how to facilitate
students' efforts to change and improve Stanford.
We believe there are few things ASSU executives
need to know that are more important than that.
Student life cannot be micromanaged from the
ASSU executive offices. The most promising re
forms and new initiatives do not come from a small
coterie of elected ASSU officials, but rather from
students themselves. When students join together
around a common cause, whether it is to hold Nike
accountable or reform IHUM, real and lasting

change occurs. Student groups are the lifeblood of
the Stanford community.
It is high time to reconnect student life and stu
dent government. Benson and Arimoto are well
suited to the task. They have been intimately in
volved with an array of student groups on campus:
Benson founded the Stanford Progressive earlier
this year, while Arimoto has worked on the Coali
tion Against Sexual Assault, to cite just two exam
ples. Their leadership experience with such a wide
variety of student associations is a quality common
to no other presidential slate.
Active involvement in student life has given
Benson and Arimoto the skills they need to lead
the ASSU and work with the administration. It has
also given them a healthy sense of student govern
ment's proper role. The ASSU should spend less
time involving itself in political controversies, Ben
son and Arimoto say, and more time developing
feasible proposals to address campus issues that di
rectly affect all students, like transportation. We
agree.
Their position that advocacy groups should be
encouraged and, when appropriate, brought into
contact with the University administration by the
ASSU, is wise. The ASSU should not endorse spe
cific advocacy positions or favor particular groups.
It should provide resources and support to all re
sponsible students who want to make a difference.
We also like their approach to graduate student
issues. They pledge to work with the Graduate
Student Council on issues such as opposite-sex liv

ing arrangements and a single housing lottery.
They are willing to defer to the CSC on these is
sues and do not pretend to have all the answers to
complex problems. We are confident that this re
lationship will be productive as long as Benson
and Arimoto remember the needs of half of Stan
ford's students.
I he Benson / Arimoto slate has its drawbacks,
to be sure. For starters, neither candidate has any
experience within the ASSU. While we are confi
dent they have gained the requisite leadership
skills from serving in other groups and, in Arimo
to's case, from running her own business, they will
need to learn more, and learn quickly, about the
ASSU's internal workings.
The duo's oft-repeated pledge to place students
as voting members on the University Board of
Trustees is a non-starter. Previous ASSU execu
tives have pressed for voting student members, to
no avail. The University administration is unlikely
to change its position now.
Besides, while students already have represen
tation on Board of Trustees committees, there are
plenty of other University committees that would
benefit from greater, more structured student
input. The Area One Governance Board is a good
example. That committee oversees one of Stan
ford's few required sequence of classes—lntro
duction to the Humanities.
Next year, the entire IHUM program will be re
viewed, and so far, formal student input is limited
to the two non-voting members of the Area One

board. If they want to "hold the administration ac
countable," on issues important to student life, as
they say they do, Benson and Arimoto would do
well to seek an expanded role for students in the
I HUM review and on p v anels and committees that
more directly affect students than the Board of
Trustees.
Despite their shortcomings, however, Benson
and Arimoto strike us as the most promising slate
for reinvigorating the ASSU. t hey are open and
approachable, willing to listen and unlikely to he
threatened by those who hold ideas different than
their own. We believe they would seek good advice
and be humble enough to take it — important
qualities in effective leaders. VVe believe they
would bring their own experience in student life to
bear in ways that would make the ASSU more rel
evant than it has been in recent years.
Should they win, we hope Benson and Arimoto
will draw on the ideas and expertise of their for
mer opponents. Megan Root, Nick Rodriguez,
Michael Osofsky and Monica Henestroza all have
valuable insights and experience and would make
good advisors. Benson and Arimoto, however,
would make good executives. In fact, we think
they would make the best executives.
Editor's Note: Josli Benson was a member of the
Daily staff during the fall of the 2000-2001 academic
year. No current member of the Editorial Board worked
with him on the Daily and this fact in no way affected
the endorsement.
