# Special-fee Endorsements
## ELECTIONS 2002 
### 
IN AN EFFORT to make informed
special-lee endorsements, mem
bers of"Hie Daily's editorial board
spent numerous hours during the
past week reviewing budgets and
ASSU Election I landb<x)k statements sub
mitted by student groups requesting
ASSU special fees. The members of the ed
itorial board also met with representatives
of each of the groups to find out about the
group's goals, its accomplishments during
the past year, plans lor expansion or im
provement in the coming academic year
and how special-fee funds would be spent.
We evaluated 50 of the 52 groups apply
ing for special fees this year. We did not
evaluate the Stanford News Readership
Program, in which The Daily is a part
ner, or The Daily itself.
Based on the submitted information
and interview discussions, the board
reached an endorsement decision for
each group based on a consensus of the
board. The Daily encourages all students
to check the Election Handbook online
(http://assu.stanford.edu/election) and
read each group's statement and budget
to reac li their own conclusions.
We felt overwhelmingly that all the
groups were worthwhile and doing
good things. All the group leaders
worked hard to make their group as
good as it could be. Many of them were
trying to expand the group's offerings
and make them more relevant to the
Stanford student. We support these ef
forts.
At the same time, asking the entire
student body for money is a weighty re
sponsibility. Many students have little or
nothing to do with a certain group, so
the group's activities must be especially
deserving for that student to be willing to
fund it. This is true even though the
amount that most groups get from a stu
dent is rather small on a per-term basis.
We evaluated the groups based on
their mission, how well they had achieved
this year's goals, their size, the uses to
which they would put their special-fee
money, the efficiency of their budget,
their willingness to use other sources of
funds and the size of their budget.
Ihe Daily has rated each student
group on a 1 to IS sc ale that assesses the
group's effectiveness and value. Si n
dent groups requesting a special fee for
the lirst time were evaluated on their ex
pected eflec tiveness and value as set forth
in their proposals and presentations.
lk i low is an explanation of the 1 tolerat
ing scale that was used asacompositescore

fora group's eflectiveness and value.
3 — We support a vote for this group's
special fee. Its utility is important to the
Stanford community and its mission is
particularly worthwhile. It makes good
use of its special-fee revenue, and it is
aware of the fact that it is spending stu
dents' money by running its operation
tightly and liberally using other sources
of funding. Its request is close to or
smaller than last year's. It is generally
easier fora group with a small budget to
earn this rating.
2 —A vote for this group's special fee
deserves consideration. Although the
group has a worthwhile mission and has
achieved its goals over the past year, it
still has some problems. Many times, an
excessive budget or poor use of special
fee funds puts a group in this category.
Generally, the group had as many posi
tive aspects as negative aspects. It some
times has large increases in its budget
over last year.
1 — We have serious reservations about
voting for this group's special fee. Many
of the following criteria apply: Its utility
to most students is limited and its mem
bership is small. Its use of special-fee
funds is poor or its budget is bloated. Its
mission is questionable and it had clifli
culty meeting its goals this year, especial
ly in the case of returning groups. Its
budget is often greatly increased over
last year's, for returning groups.
The individual fee group summaries
below aim to convey the group's accom
plishments during the year and its plans
for the coming year.
Annual cost per student is indicated in
parentheses under the group's gross fee
request amount. The per capita amounts
are taken directly from the ASSU Election
I landbook. A "B" prior to the amount in
dicates the fee will be assessed to both the
undergraduate and graduate students
and a "U" indicates the fee will be assessed
to undergraduates only.

Thursday on a space-available basis. Only
those letters received by .'I p.m. today will
be considered for publication tomorrow.
