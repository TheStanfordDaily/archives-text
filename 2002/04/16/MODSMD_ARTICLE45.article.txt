RETURNING GROUPS
ALTERNATIVE $21,700
SPRING BREAK (U $ 1.09)
3
Alternative Spring Break is currently the
only organization on campus that offers
community service opportunities over
spring break, which is a valuable service
for the community. The group relies
heavily on ASSU special fees, but oper
ates on a small budget, considering the
number of trips and events it manages.
We endorse its application for special fees
because of its community service orienta
tion and general tightness of budget.

ASIAN $28,334.50
AMERICAN (U $1.42)
STUDENTS
ASSOCIATION
2
I n a year of upheaval, the Asian American
Students' Association worked to continue
in its mission of providing Stanford stu
dents of Asian descent with a center of
community and serving as a source of
funding for seven subgroups. The group
helps to plan three to four major events
per quarter, notable among which is its
Listen to the Silence Conference dealing
wit h social and political issues facing
racial minorities. Controversy over the
election of the association's president
marred its image this year, as a Caucasian
student won by default and was forced to
resign in the face of popular opposition.
AASA is to be commended for requesting
a lower fee this year than last, hut it could
cut its request even further if its other
subgroups, or the umbrella group itself,
raised funds anywhere near as successful
ly as its Sanskriti subgroup.

ASSU LEGAL $99,285
COUNSELING (B $2.34)
3
This service is an invaluable insurance pol
icy for all Stanford students, as it provides
free legal counseling to them and their
partners. Although the attorneys do not
represent Stanford students in court, they
dispense advice in all types of cases. Al
though many of us may never be in an
auto accident or may never have a dispute
with a landlord, it is comforting to know
that free legal advice is available in case we
do. It is especially valuable given that an at
torney is on call seven days a week and
available for consultation two afternoons
per week. This service is especially impor
tant for graduate students, who use it
more often than undergraduates do. The
group's request is unavoidably high be
cause of the expensive professional ser
vices and the office coordinator it must
hire. Most of its costs are these labor fees.

ASSU ONLINE $11,000
COURSE GUIDE (U $0.55)
1
The ASSU Online Course Guide could be
an invaluable tool for students shopping
courses at the beginning of each quarter
and for faculty looking to assess the effec
tiveness of their teaching. It purports to
function as a vehicle for student involve
ment in the evaluation process of teach
ing at Stanford, providing student com
ments and ratings on a wide variety of
courses and professors. Yet while the
concept is exciting, the execution is sub
par. The site has been plagued by a lack
of consistent updating, and its unreliabil
ity makes it as much a source of frustra
tion for students as it is a source of vain
able information. The amount of the
group's request is reasonable; it simply
needs to do a better job of fulfilling its

promise. A vote for the Online Course
Guide's special fee would be a vote of con
fidence in its ability to improve its service
in the coming year, since in its current
form it is not worth the money.
ASSU SPEAKERS $ 137,525
BUREAU (B $3.23)
3
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a student
run organization that brings prominent,
high-profile speakers to campus. Because
of its limited funds, the Speakers Bureau
cannot always bring the most famous
speakers to campus, like Bill Clinton, who
asked lor hundreds of thousands of dollars
to speak. However, the Speakers Bureau
should continue to seek student input as it
attempts to bring a wide variety of speakers
to reflect the diverse interests of the student
body. The budget primarily reflects the
amount of honoraria needed to give the
speakers.

BARRIO $24,579.46
ASSISTANCE (U51.17)
3
()nc of Stanford's most venerable commu
nity-service groups, Barrio Assistance con
tinues to give Stanford students an oppor
tunity to work as one-on-one mentors with
local Latino and Latina children for an en
tire year. I lie group serves not only the
youth who receive the mentoring and tu
toring, but also the students who partici
pate. Many use the program to continue
their tutoring experiences while some use
it to junipstart teaching careers. The
group's special-fee request lias increased
as a result of rising rental prices, but the
group's officers do everything they can to
mitigate this effect and keep costs as low as
feasible. For this reason, The Daily be
lieves the group deserves the full amount
of its special-fee request.
BLACK STUDENT $30,520
UNION (U $1.53)
1 2 3
While we recognize that the Black Student
Union is an important part of the African-
American community on campus, we have
some concerns about its use of funds col
lected through special fees. The majority of
the BSU's budget comes from Special Fees,
and of its 2002-2003 budget, the single
largest expense is $14,600 for refresh
ments. Although refreshments are some
times necessary for community-building
activity, this expenditure is somewhat ex
travagant and ignores the organization's
responsibility to manage its money wisely.
We believe that the BSU does sponsor
many important events, such as a Kwanzaa
celebration, Freshman Convocation, and a
soul food dinner that we would like to see
preserved, but due to the organization's
questionable use of student funds, we can
not endorse the BSU's special fee applica
tion without reservations.
CLUB SPORTS $195,810.80
(B $4.61)
1 2 3
Club Sports' special-fee request is one of the
most pricey, yet also one of the most valu
able of all of this year's applicants. As it pro
vides a necessary supplement to ticket rev
enue in financing Stanford's 15 club sports
programs. The organization, which re
ceives no funding from the University, em
phasizes student initiative in team manage
ment as well as in competition and perfor
mance. Club teams at Stanford have met
with increasing success on the national
scene in recent years, and the program's
special-fee funding is essential for continu
ing to allow teams to travel and compete at
higher levels.
INTERNATIONAL $11,230
UNDERGRADUATE (U50.56)
COMMUNITY
1 2 3
This group sponsors International Orien
tation, which gives new international stu
dents a few days to become acquainted
with Stanford before freshman orienta
tion. This service is indispensable for these
students, who have enough trouble adapt
ing to a new country and a new lifestyle as
is. Its mission is especially important given
the added scrutiny of foreign students by
the U.S. government after Sept. 11. In ad
dition, the group is lobbying the Universi
ty to extend need-blind admission to inter
national students. The group also hosts
quarterly dinners for international stu
dents, although everyone is invited. This
group's constituency is small but important
and it provides an important service that
should really be paid for by the University.
KIDS WITH $9,082.19
DREAMS (U $0.46)
1 2 3
Kids With Dreams is a community service
organization dedicated to serving develop
mentally and physically handicapped chil
dren throughout the Bay Area. Kids With
Dreams currently runs a swimming pro
gram, an equestrian program, a tutoring
program, a rock climbing program and a
special education program. The organiza
tion does a good job of seeking outside fund
ing to subsidize its costs and is a valuable
asset to the Stanford and local community.
KZSU $98,859
(B $2.33)
1 2 3
As Stanford's only official student-run radio
station, KZSU 90.1 FM prides itself on a
non-commercial, envelope-pushing ap
proach to radio. The station's vision is pri
marily one of creative and diverse music
programming and quality Stanford sports
broadcasting brought to the community by
students interested in the station. Its non
commercial status allows its deejays to ex
plore genres and formats that aren't repre
sented by mainstream radio, but it also
means that the station relies heavily on its
special fee to maintain its equipment. While
the service KZSU provides to the commu
nity is certainly worthwhile, its officers
should explore ways to diversify its sources
of funding in the future, perhaps by seek
ing donations from listeners. Also, the sta
tion might be able to benefit the communi
ty more by heightening outreach efforts.

MARIACHICARDENAL $12,280
DE STANFORD (U $0.62)
12 3
Mariachi Cardenal is requesting a relative
ly small special fee to aid it in its stated goal
of "making Stanford a more culturally
aware campus." The group spends nearly
all of its special fee on employing profes
sional Mariachi instructors for its class,
Music 157. The group should do more to
increase its visibility if it wants to convince
students that their special-fee money is
truly benefitting the entire community, as
opposed to just the 20 or 30 people who
take the class in a given quarter. Mariachi
Cardenal deserves commendation for its
substantial fundraising efforts, but a
greater on-campus presence would make
the group's claim that it is an "integral part
of the Stanford Community" more viable.
MASQUE $5,980
MAGAZINE (U $0.30)
1 2 3
A literary and visual arts magazine, Masque
is the only publication for queer expression
at Stanford. The organization not only
serves the University's gay, lesbian, bisexu
al and transgender communities at Stan
ford, but also represents those communities
to the rest of campus. Masque also helps
unite surrounding queer communities by
bringing queer artists from around the Bay
Area to Stanford and publishing their
work. In recent years, Masque has enacted
several cost-cutting measures, and its spe
cial fee goes only toward producing the
magazine. This group is one of the few that
is fiscally responsible, and serves as an ex
ample to other special fee groups.
MEChA $37,534
(U $1.89)
1 2 3
MEChA is an important umbrella organiza
tion for the Chicano and Latino communi
ty on campus. It sponsors such events as
Zoot Suit Week, Cesar Chavez Commemo
ration and the Dia de los Muertos. The or
ganization does a good job coordinating ac
tivities, but we have reservations about its
use of money. MEChA has budgeted
$10,900 for refreshments next year, in ad
dition to $4,840 for travel fares and $3,310
for accommodations. The accommodation
budget represents a 487 percent increase
over last year. We also cannot completely
endorse MEChA's very large special fee re
quest due to the fact that the organization
did not respond to the Daily's repeated re
quests for an interview. We suggest that
MEChA look into ways to better spend its
money in the future.
NAACP $27,400
(U $1.38)
12 3
The Stanford NAACP is a vocal advocacy
organization on campus. It coordinates
voter drives, and works with the ACLU and
other organizations to promote political
consciousness. The NAACP has also in
creased its membership in the past year.
However, we believe that the 77 percent in
crease in the special fee request from last
year to this year is excessive. We hope that
as the Stanford chapter of the NAACP
grows, its leaders look to innovative sources
to raise funding. We also believe that the
NA\CP sometimes crosses the fine line be
tween acting as a social advocate and being
a political organization. Although the
NAACP is an active, visible and valuable or
ganization on campus, we are concerned it
may cross the line into a political group. Be
cause it treads so close to this line, and po
litical organizations are not allowed to be
funded with special fees, we cannot offer
this organization our complete endorse
ment.
PROJECT $6,737.70
MOTIVATION (U $0.34)
1 2 3
This group works to expose at-risk youth to
the benefits of college by bringing them to
Stanford to spend a day with a student. One
of the group's most popular events, "A Day
with an Undergrad," provides information
packets on applying to college and infor
mation sessions with top University offices.
In addition, the group sets up visits of Stan
ford with more than 1400 students
throughout California. While the group is
an outstanding addition to Stanford, it
should try to team up with other communi

ty service groups to bring a wider variety of
students to campus.
SCBN $19,530
(B $0.46)
1 2 3
SCBN has been recovering from a lack of
leadership at the end of last year and from
SSE's pull-out on the Tele Flicks program.
While we believe that SCBN could be an ef
fective oudet for students interested in tele
vision broadcasting, the organization cur
rendy broadcasts only three shows unique
to Stanford, in addition to a sporadically
produced 10-minute news program. Be
cause of aging equipment, SCBN also fre
quently does not reach certain residences.
We believe that the organization must im
prove its broadcasting dependibility and its
menu of original programming before we
can endorse its Special Fee request.
SEXUALHEALTH $13,675
PEER RESOURCE (U $0.69)
CENTER
1 2 3
The SHPRC is an essential resource for
the student body, providing sexual health
education on a campus where dialogue
about sex is minimal. While the SHPRC is
primarily known for providing 12 free
condoms or its equivalent in other prod
ucts such as massage oils, the group also
offers information on STDs and pregnan
cy testing and has a sexual health library
that is open to everyone. The organiza
tion, however, could trim its budget in a
few areas. For example, it could offer a
smaller amount of free sexual products
because the percentage of Stanford stu
dents that actually use 12 condoms a
quarter is probably small.
STANFORD *$33,031
AMERICAN (U $1.66)
INDIAN
ORGANIZATION
12 3
The Stanford American Indian Organiza
tion sponsors such important campus
events as Indigenous People's Day and the
Powwow, which draws over 30,000 atten
dees each year. The organization also spon
sors tutoring in San Jose and sponsors
speakers as well as funding its constituent
subgroups. The group includes about 20
core members. Its request has increased
nearly 10 percent from last year, which it
explains by referring to the rising costs of
services at Stanford. The group has done
an admirablejob of raising revenues, but its
requests for refreshments and travel fares
are two of its top three budgeted expenses.
Regardless, SAIO's many contributions to
the community make it a worthy recipient
of special-fee money.
STANFORDAXE $10,700
COMMITTEE (U $0.54)
1 2 3
The Stanford Axe Committee was founded
to preserve the traditions of the University,
and it works to increase student spirit at the
annual Big Game and other sporting
events. The Axe Committee's budget is
fairly tight, but this year there was a gener
al apathy preceding the Big Game. Al
though the Axe Committee camped out at
the Birdcage as usual, few students from
outside the committee were drawn into
their efforts, and the committee members
at the cage did not effectively increase Stan
ford spirit. The Axe Committee should also
investigate ways to bring more students
into pre-game activities.
STANFORD BAND $66,460
(U $3.34)
1 2 3
The Stanford Band has had a tumultuous
year, and its alcohol probation and suspen
sion from the Pac-10 basketball tourna
ments has damaged the school's image as
well as its own. Still, the Band fills a unique
role at the school and is unquestionably de
serving of some special-fee funding. The
main problem with the Band's request is
that it relies entirely on its special fee for
funding. Moreover, $3,500 for refresh
ments is indeed, as the group's special-fee
request states, "a lot of doughnuts." The
Band couldn't live without its special fee,
but it should not take that as a license to
avoid cost-cutting or fundraising.

STANFORD $24,576
CHAMBER (B $0.58)
CHORALE
1 2 3
The Stanford Chamber Chorale is a select
choir of 24 voices dedicated to the perfor
mance of virtuosic literature for the small
choral ensemble. Thousands of people,
mostly outside of Stanford, attend their
performances each year, however, the
group should put more effort into increas
ing its campus visibility. The group is also
primarily requesting a special fee to fund its
international tour to England and Wales in
the summer 0f2003. We think the chamber
chorale should not ask the Stanford student
body to pay for their trip, and the group
should try to obtain funds for its tour from
other sources.
STANFORD $22,309.20
CHAPARRAL (U $0.96)
12 3.
The Chappie is the second oldest continu
ously published humor magazine in the na
tion. It continues to grow in terms of variety
and diversity. The Chappie is delivered
free of charge six times a year to every un
dergraduate residence on campus. The
Chappie's budget is extremely tight as all of
its special-fee money request goes solely to
the costs of producing the magazine.
STANFORD $6,196
COMMUNITY (U $0.31)
CARNIVAL
3
The Stanford Community Carnival is an
annual public-service event where elemen
tary school students from East Palo Alto
and East Menlo Park come to the Stanford
campus fora day of free carnival fun.
While the carnival organizers should con
tinue to solicit donations from outside
sources, they definitely deserve their well
administered small special fees request be
cause of their ability to strengthen ties be
tween Stanford students and their sur
rounding community.
STANFORD $87,025
CONCERT (B $2.05)
NETWORK
1 2 3
The Stanford Concert Network continues
to do a great job of bringing in a variety of
entertainers including Jack Johnson, Dis
patch, the Slip and Phil Lesh. Their weekly
CoHo series is an added benefit to the Stan
ford community. While students may be
upset that the Stanford Concert Network
have not been able to bring the most popu
lar musicians (Dave Matthew's Band, Brit
ney Spears, Dr. Dre), many of these stars re
quest hundreds of thousands of dollars,
which the concert network simply does not
have. The group has handled its budget ad
mirably.
STANFORD $38,475
FILM SOCIETY (U51.93)
1 2 3
Among the Stanford Film Society's'yearly
events, the United Nations Association Film
Festival and the Student Film Festival are
two of the most visible. The society's goal is
to foster the appreciation of film and film
making on the Stanford campus by financ
ing and showing student films and putting
together events such as the Student Film
makers Workshop. The group's contribu
tions to the Stanford community are sub
stantial, but its heavy dependence on its
special fee must be remedied in order to
justify its large request. It costs a lot of
money to use facilities such as Annenberg
Auditorium, and fees for technical and jan
itorial services have jumped substantially
this year. Still, revenues for the group
amounted to just over 10 percent of its bud
get, with its special-fee request covering the
remainder.
STANFORD IN $20,138
GOVERNMENT (U $1.01)
1 2 3
Stanford in Government is a non-partisan
student-run organization committed to
promoting an interest in and awareness of
government and political issues. SIG con
tinues to provide a number of services to
the Stanford community, including fellow

ships at the international, national and local
levels; internship resources; a Public Policy
Forum and community service activities.
SIC continues to have a pretty tight budget,
in which honoraria for bringing speakers to
campus is its greatest expense.
STANFORD JAZZ $20,710
ORCHESTRA (U51.04)
2 3
The Stanford Jazz Orchestra performs a
quarterly concert to which it invites
renowned guest artists. The special fee re
quest this year is increasing slightly in order
to offer a higher quality repertoire and to
bring more famous guest artists to campus.
The orchestra also offers free clinics to all
Stanford students. In order to tighten its
budget, the orchestra might want to inves
tigate Stanford Fund letters and selling ad
vertising in its programs.
STANFORD $34,631.45
MARTIAL ARTS (U $ 1.74)
PROGRAM
2
The Stanford Martial Arts Program is a new
collective of campus martial arts organiza
tions. The organization supports 14 cam
pus martial arts groups with money and al
lows the groups to communicate among
themselves. However, we believe that the
19 percent increase in special fee requests
from last year to this year is excessive. The
group's special fee request for refreshments
has increased 86 percent from last year to
this year, with a total of $8,250 budgeted for
that category. Additionally, the special fee
request for accommodations has increased
138 percent. We believe that the organiza
tion should budget its funds more careful
ly, and perhaps should increase the dues it
charges participants in order to reduce its
needs for special fees.
STANFORD $8,250
MOCK TRIAL (U50.41)
1
Stanford Mock Trial practices for and
travels to various intercollegiate mock
trial competitions around the country,
including regional and national compe
titions. The group exists to give interest
ed students a look into the legal system
and to practice their skills in drama and
debate. Each student plays an assigned
courtroom role on one of two teams. The
group does do an admirable job of using
membership fees and Stanford Fund let
ters to raise money outside of Special
Fees. Although the budget is small, 80
percent of it is devoted to travel costs.
The general student body should not
have to bear this type of cost. We feel that
membership dues should be raised to
make ASSU general fee funding a viable
alternative.
SPOON $5,290
(U $0.27)
1 2 3
We enthusiastically endorse the Stanford
Project on Hunger. The organization col
lects unused food from the Faculty Club,
row houses and dining halls and dis
tributes the food to local soup kitchens.
SPOON has slightly increased its special
fee request this year because of changes in
the cost of packaging food. But the orga
nization effectively solicits donations from
corporations and earns a good portion of
its budget from writing Stanford Fund let
ters.
STANFORD SOLAR $33,547
CAR PROJECT (U $1.69)
1 2 3
The Stanford Solar Car Project is com
prised of undergraduate and graduate stu
dents with an interest in engineering who
design and build a solar-powered car,
which competes in races and events
throughout the year. Most of the group's
funding comes from donations from the
School of Engineering and outside sources.
While the group requests a special fee to
build a new two-person solar car, it should
attempt to do more to obtain these funds by
attracting a corporate sponsorship or from
other sources. The Stanford Solar Car Pro
ject already receives more than $200,000
from donations; therefore, it shouldn't be
hard to find enough money from these
sources instead of asking Stanford students
fora special fee.
STUDENTS FOR $9,785.36
ENVIRONMENTAL (U $0.49)
ACTION AT
STANFORD
4
2
SFAS encourages activism on and oil cam
pus and organizes several activist cam
paigns, such as tlie one last year to stop
Stanford Hospital from sending its medi
cal waste to an incinerator in Oakland. It
brings speakers to campus and sends stu
dents to workshops on organizing
protests. The group also does a fair job of
raising funds, soliciting donations from
University departments, for example. We
are wary of supporting this group, since
many students may not agree with its po
litical stances. Also, the group is somewhat
small, considering it has only 10 core
members. It does also fund other, smaller
environmental groups, meaning its con
tribution to the campus is wider-ranging.
At any rate, its relatively small budget
makes a "yes" vote worth considering.
STUDENT $19,614
INITIATED (B $1.01)
COURSES
3
Student Initiated Courses is in its first full
year ofoperation. It allows students to initi
ate and develop classes on issues not cur
rently addressed by University curriculum.
The student initiated class about the events
of Sept. 11 and its aftermath has approxi
mately 70 students during the winter quar
ter. While SIC; officers should continue to
work to ensure the entire Stanford commu
nity is aware of the new courses, the cours
es are a valuable addition to Stanford stu
dents. Also, the majority of its special fee re
quest goes towards running the individual
classes.
STUDENT $17,242.32
ORGANIZING (B$0.41)
COMMITTEE
FOR THE ARTS
3
This year's well-received edition of An Art
Affair, which incorporated the work of
more than twice as many students as last
year's version, highlights the Student Orga
nizing Committee for the Arts' determina
tion to provide opportunities for Stanford
artists to share their work with the commu
nity. Additional planned activities, such as a
project to create a student-designed mural
in Tresidder Union and the "Stanford
Soundtrack" musical compilation, demon
strate the committee's goal of increasing its
offerings to meet demand. With a diverse
funding base, the organization does a solid
job of keeping its special-fee request rea
sonable, and its services clearly benefit the
entire community.
THE MIND'S EYE $14,599
(U $0.73)
2
The Mind's Eye, billed as "a Stanford jour
nal of expression," is working on increasing
its visibility on campus through programs
such as poetry nights and issue-release so
cials. Its special-fee request mainly reflects
the publication's printing costs and the ex
pense of financing such events. The journal
lias been working on procuring donations
and Stanford Fund shifts, but its revenue is
still limited by its commitment to avoiding
commercial advertisement. Thus, its spe
cial fee is integral to its continued publica
tion, but it should continue to actively ex
plore ways to lower its request amount in
the future.

THE STAN FORD $49,752.67
DAILY (B $1.17)
The Stanford Daily is an independent,
non-profit, student-run newspaper that
serves as the primary vehicle for commu
nicating news and events to the 24,000
members of the Stanford community.
Like virtually all other newspapers across
the country, Hie Stanford Daily has expe
rienced a severe decline in advertising
sales this year (nearly 35 percent). The
Daily requests a special fee this year to
maintain its campus news coverage, page
count, and circulation, despite this loss of
revenue. The Daily's special fee is only ap
plied toward the direct cost of providing
the paper to students — printing and dis
tribution costs. Absolutely no other pro
duction, overhead, or administrative cost
is included in the Daily's special lee aside
from the printing and delivery of the
paper.
VIENNESE BALL $11,580.52
COMMITTEE (U $0.58)
1
The Viennese Ball attracts about 1,200 stu
dents, faculty and community members to
its event every year. The ball —celebrated
every year since 1977 — sells tickets as its
primary source of revenue. The ball's Spe
cial Fee does not effect ively lower t he cost of
tickets, and we believe that the additional
cost of tickets without Special Fee support
would be almost negligible.
NEW GROUPS
CARDINAL $20,106
BALLET (U$1.01)
2
Cardinal Ballet is in the process of trying
to raise its on-campus presence and estab
lish itself as a leader in the promotion of
the arts at Stanford. The group is applying
for its first special fee in hopes of devoting
more energy toward raising the visibility
of dance on campus and making its stu
dent-produced spring show a campus tra
dition. This year's highly successful collab
orative dance show, "Urban Nights," at
tracted a large student audience and
demonstrated the group's ability to bring
together other, smaller dance groups fora
high-quality, high-budget show that none
could have afforded on its own. Cardinal
Ballet's special-fee request seems high for
such a small group — it has fewer than 20
core members — but most of the money
would be directed toward the huge cost of
putting on a show at a top Stanford venue
such as Dinkelspiel Auditorium. If this en
ables the group to succeed in its mission of
promoting and celebrating dance at Stan
ford, then some may consider it money
well-spent.
MSAN $9,505.29
(U $0.48)
3
MSAN is a cultural organization dedicat
ed to fostering awareness of Islamic cul
ture in order to enhance cross-cultural
understanding on campus as well as pro
moting understanding and tolerance
within the Stanford community about
the issues relevant to Muslims around
the world. The aftermath of the events
of Sept. 1 1 demonstrated that very few
people in the United States understand
Muslims and their culture. This group's
mission is a needed addition to the Stan
ford community. Their special fee re
quest primarily goes towards bringing
speakers to campus and providing the

Stanford community food at its annual
banquet.
SALSA! $167700
(B $0.39)
1
Salsa! works to promote appreciation and
performance of salsa dancing on campus.
While the group offers occasional dance
lessons in dorms and performances at pub
lic events, it would rely on special fees for
the majority of its budget. We believe that
because of the limited number of students
involved in the organization, the group
should try to think more innovatively about
fundraising. We also believe that the group
should look to other sources of funding to
support its planned salsa parties.
SOCIETY FOR $4,170
INTERNATIONAL (U $0.57)
AFFAIRS AT
STANFORD (SIAS)
3
The Society for International Affairs at
Stanford works to promote awareness of in
ternational issues on campus. The group
sponsors such activities as Model United
Nations conferences. The group raises
more than two-thirds of its budget through
means other than special fees, and has sig
nificantly cut costs in such areas as refresh
ments in the past year. We believe that SIAS
has demonstrated a strong commitment to
responsible budget ing, and endorse its spe

STANFORD $6,711.50
ALLIANCE FOR (U $0.34)
SERVICE THROUGH
THE ARTS (SASTA)
3
SASTA is a community service-oriented
group that seeks to increase arts awareness
on and off campus. SASTA consists of five
programs in which Stanford students vol
unteer to teach local children and senior
citizens different types of art, such as piano
playing and ballet dancing. The group's
budget is small — only $8,000 — and its
mission of community service is worth
while. Furthermore, it supplements its
special-fee revenue with Stanford Fund
letters and dorm contributions. We highly
recommend a vote for this group.
STANFORD-ASIA $24,165
TECHNOLOGY (U $0.57)
INITIATIVE
1
The ATI works to bring together Asians
and Americans interested in technology.
The mission of the ATI is to promote dis
cussion of entrepreneurship and business
around the Pacific Rim. Although the A TI
receives a large portion of its budget from
sources other than Special Fees, we'be
lieve that the organization should trim its
budget. Currently ATI spends $12,942 on
food and refreshments, $18,400 on travel
fares, and $15,000 on accommodations.
While this group is inherently a travel-ori
ented group, we believe that it could save
more money if it were more concerned
with its finances.
STANFORD $10,082.50
BIODESIGN (U $0.51)
1
Stanford Biodesign is the first and only
student organization to complement
Stanford's Bio-X initiative. It aims to

appraise undergraduates of the emerg
ing technologies which biomedical sci
ences will utilize in the near future, to
promote student innovation and to in
form the non-science communities of
recent progress in biomedicine. While
Stanford Biodesign's purpose is ad
mirable, it should look for other ways to
fund its program besides special fees.
Compared to community service and'
cultural organizations, Stanford Biode
sign could fairly easily receive funds
from academic departments or dona
tions from local companies. Before at
tempting to request a special fee, Stan
ford Biodesign should exhaust those
possibilities.
STANFORD $17,232.50
COMMUNITY (U $0.87)
FARM
2
The Stanford Community Farm offers
students a chance to grow fruits and
vegetables in an environmentally sensi
tive manner by providing land, tools
and seeds. About 30 students currently
farm there, some as part of a class spon
sored by the Earth Systems Depart
ment. I he produce — fruits, vegetables
and flowers — is sold to some co-op
houses and farm officers are exploring
greater sales in Palo Alto. The farm
wants to use a large portion of its spe
cial-fee money to hire a part-time coor
dinator to provide a consistent labor
force, which is essential for the farm's
daily upkeep. We feel this is a worthy
expenditure and that the fyrm deserves
student support. We encourage the
farm to sell its food to students and com
munity members, as we feel it would be
a popular item.
STANFORD NEWS $31,200
READERSHIP (U51.57)
PROGRAM
Because The Daily is a partner with the
ASSU in the News Readership Pro
gram, we are not rating the News Read
ership Program to avoid any conflict of
interest. The Stanford News Reader
ship program distributes free copies of
The New York Times and the San Jose
Mercury News to 14 locations around
campus, including 12 dining-rooms
and 3 high-traffic academic areas. The
papers are distributed in the same racks
as Fhe Stanford Daily, giving coverage
of local, regional, national and interna
tional news. Next year, the News Read
ership program plans to bring several
journalism-related speakers to campus.
Most of the fee request, however, goes
to pay for the actual papers, which are
sold at a discount to their newsstand
price, and their distribution.
STANFORD $21,845
SYMPHONY (U $0.51)
ORCHESTRA
1
The Stanford Symphony Orchestra is
an organization comprised of about 75
undergraduate and graduate student
musicians who have approximately five
concerts a year. While the symphony
orchestra provides the Stanford com
munity with a professional level of clas
sical music, its special fee request is pri
marily to rent facilities in New York
and at the University of Paris-Sor
bonne as a part of its summer 2002
tour. We feel that the Stanford Sym
phony Orchestra should attempt to get
these funds from donations and other
sources besides asking Stanford stu
dents.

STANFORD $18,630.31
TAIKO (U $0.94)
1
Taiko is a form of Japanese ensemble
drumming. The talented Stanford group
performs at events on and off campus
and hosts a Taiko symposium as well as
quarterly workshops for community
members on Taiko drumming. The
group also builds its own drums and cos
tumes. This year, the group's special lee
request includes money for legitimate
maintenance and operating expenses,
such as buying material for new uni
forms. As well, it includes $10,000 fora
trip to Maui fora drum-building work
shop. While we are sure the workshop
will be a worthwhile trip, we do not feel it
is proper or fair for all students to under
write it. Those who wish to participate in
the trip should pay for it.
STANFORD $19,725
SHAKESPEARE (U $0.99)
SOCIETY
(THE PLAYERS)
2
The Stanford Shakespeare Society, a.k.a.
The Players, is a new group on campus
which received Drama Department fund
ing in its inaugural year. 'The group hopes
to put on high-caliber student Shake
speare performances at campus venues,
including the extremely expensive Frost
Amphitheater. The group wants to do so
at no charge to any attendees, which
makes its special-fee request higher than it
might otherwise be. We congratulate the
group on taking the initiative to bring fun
drama events to the community, but it
must work to obtain donations and other
sources of funding if it is to put on a show
in Frost each year. The group's relatively
high special-fee request may be useful for
getting it off the ground next year, but it
has yet to prove to students that it is wor
thy of receiving nearly $20,000 of their
money on an annual basis.
WAVES $9^50
(U $0.49)
1 2 'S""" ;
WAVES works to promote connections
between Chinese youth and the Stanford
community. The organization brings
speakers to campus and holds regular
meetings. Although we believe that the
community service work WAVES plans to
do in China during its summer trip there
is valuable and laudable, we cannot sup
port the group until it increases its mem
bership and seeks outside sources of
funding. Currently there are only two
members of the organization, and al
though this group has great potential,
there is no guarantee that it will appeal
to a broad group of Stanford students.
We would be able to give the group a
more enthusiastic recommendation if it
increased its membership.
WOMENSPEAK $6,910
(U $0.35)
3
Womenspeak is a biannual journal, pub
lishing works of poetry, fiction, art and non
fiction addressing a variety of issues of in
terest to women at Stanford. Womenspeak
is an excellent way to give individuals at
Stanford an opportunity to express their
thoughts, feelings and views concerning
women at Stanford and around the world.
Womenspeak has an extremely tight bud
get as 90 percent of its special fees is used to
produce the two magazines per year.
