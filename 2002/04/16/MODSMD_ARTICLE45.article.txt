RETURNING GROUPS
ALTERNATIVE $21,700
SPRING BREAK (U $ 1.09)
3
Alternative Spring Break is currently the
only organization on campus that offers
community service opportunities over
spring break, which is a valuable service
for the community. The group relies
heavily on ASSU special fees, but oper
ates on a small budget, considering the
number of trips and events it manages.
We endorse its application for special fees
because of its community service orienta
tion and general tightness of budget.

ASIAN $28,334.50
AMERICAN (U $1.42)
STUDENTS
ASSOCIATION
2
I n a year of upheaval, the Asian American
Students' Association worked to continue
in its mission of providing Stanford stu
dents of Asian descent with a center of
community and serving as a source of
funding for seven subgroups. The group
helps to plan three to four major events
per quarter, notable among which is its
Listen to the Silence Conference dealing
wit h social and political issues facing
racial minorities. Controversy over the
election of the association's president
marred its image this year, as a Caucasian
student won by default and was forced to
resign in the face of popular opposition.
AASA is to be commended for requesting
a lower fee this year than last, hut it could
cut its request even further if its other
subgroups, or the umbrella group itself,
raised funds anywhere near as successful
ly as its Sanskriti subgroup.

ASSU LEGAL $99,285
COUNSELING (B $2.34)
3
This service is an invaluable insurance pol
icy for all Stanford students, as it provides
free legal counseling to them and their
partners. Although the attorneys do not
represent Stanford students in court, they
dispense advice in all types of cases. Al
though many of us may never be in an
auto accident or may never have a dispute
with a landlord, it is comforting to know
that free legal advice is available in case we
do. It is especially valuable given that an at
torney is on call seven days a week and
available for consultation two afternoons
per week. This service is especially impor
tant for graduate students, who use it
more often than undergraduates do. The
group's request is unavoidably high be
cause of the expensive professional ser
vices and the office coordinator it must
hire. Most of its costs are these labor fees.

ASSU ONLINE $11,000
COURSE GUIDE (U $0.55)
1
The ASSU Online Course Guide could be
an invaluable tool for students shopping
courses at the beginning of each quarter
and for faculty looking to assess the effec
tiveness of their teaching. It purports to
function as a vehicle for student involve
ment in the evaluation process of teach
ing at Stanford, providing student com
ments and ratings on a wide variety of
courses and professors. Yet while the
concept is exciting, the execution is sub
par. The site has been plagued by a lack
of consistent updating, and its unreliabil
ity makes it as much a source of frustra
tion for students as it is a source of vain
able information. The amount of the
group's request is reasonable; it simply
needs to do a better job of fulfilling its

promise. A vote for the Online Course
Guide's special fee would be a vote of con
fidence in its ability to improve its service
in the coming year, since in its current
form it is not worth the money.
ASSU SPEAKERS $ 137,525
BUREAU (B $3.23)
3
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a student
run organization that brings prominent,
high-profile speakers to campus. Because
of its limited funds, the Speakers Bureau
cannot always bring the most famous
speakers to campus, like Bill Clinton, who
asked lor hundreds of thousands of dollars
to speak. However, the Speakers Bureau
should continue to seek student input as it
attempts to bring a wide variety of speakers
to reflect the diverse interests of the student
body. The budget primarily reflects the
amount of honoraria needed to give the
speakers.

BARRIO $24,579.46
ASSISTANCE (U51.17)
3
()nc of Stanford's most venerable commu
nity-service groups, Barrio Assistance con
tinues to give Stanford students an oppor
tunity to work as one-on-one mentors with
local Latino and Latina children for an en
tire year. I lie group serves not only the
youth who receive the mentoring and tu
toring, but also the students who partici
pate. Many use the program to continue
their tutoring experiences while some use
it to junipstart teaching careers. The
group's special-fee request lias increased
as a result of rising rental prices, but the
group's officers do everything they can to
mitigate this effect and keep costs as low as
feasible. For this reason, The Daily be
lieves the group deserves the full amount
of its special-fee request.
