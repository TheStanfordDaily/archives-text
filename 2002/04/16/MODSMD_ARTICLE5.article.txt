# Psychiatry professor begins sleep deprivation campaign
## Dement enlists help of celebrities to promote "red alert" awareness 
### CYNTHIA CHO EDITORIAL STAFF 
What do Ray Barone of "Everybody
Loves Raymond," Jim Fassel, the head coach
of the New York Giants, and University
President John Hennessy have in common?
They are all involved in the "Drowsiness is
Red Alert Campaign" sponsored by William
Dement, professor of psychiatry and behav
ioral sciences.
The goal of the campaign is to "alert people
to the dangers of drowsiness, as well as sleep
deprivation and sleep debt," said Dement.
Barone, Fassel and Hennessy have each
contributed video clips in which they say,
"Drowsiness is Red Alert." The rest of the cast
members of "Everybody Loves Raymond"
and President Emeritus Gerhard Casper
have contributed similar video clips.
While this video campaign is still in its ini
tial stages, Dement has been researching and
educating others about the dangers of
drowsiness for many years. Dement coined
the term "Drowsiness is Red Alert" after a
study he conducted in 1991 in which he and
two research assistants interviewed more
than 600 long-haul truck drivers.
Dement hopes to compile the video clips
into public-service announcements to edu
cate the public about sleep awareness.
"When I asked, 'What is your signal to
stop driving?' more than 80 percent an
swered, 'When I see something in the road
that is not there or when I have a head drop
with a startle,'" Dement said. These mo
ments of drowsiness often lead to fatal acci
dents on the road, according to Dement.
"Drowsiness on the highway and in
other hazardous situations kills people,"
Dement said.
Dement defines drowsiness as a moment
or instant in the continuum of being alert to

falling asleep. "At that moment, we are
aware that staying attentive requires a con
scious effort," he said. "Most people say they
feel the moment in their eyes and eyelids get
heavy, want to close, or won't focus."
Dement said he was inspired to start a
video campaign in order to create aware
ness about drowsiness after viewing a video
that one of his former head teaching assis
tants, Biren Kamdar, made with junior bas
ketball player Curtis Borchardt in 2001. In
the video, the two played basketball against
each other.
When Borchardt was well-rested, he was
able to beat Kamdar but when Borchardt
was drowsy, he lost to Kamdar.
"It was an act, of course," Dement said.
"But [watching the video] led me to believe
there is some real possibility and promise for
videotaping."
Dement has contacted Hollywood pro
ducers in order to get actors and actresses to
take part in the campaign. "I hope to get
Robin Williams," Dement said. He is also ex
pecting author Calvin Trillin and actor Tim
othy Hutton to contribute video clips.
When the video clips of the cast members
of "Everybody Loves Raymond" were shown
in the Sleep and Dreams class, the reactions
were positive.
"I think that the campaign will be success
ful because it catches people's attention and
interest," said junior Kenneth Mali, who was
one of the Sleep and Dream teaching assis
tants during winter quarter. "It's cool that fa
mous people are willing to take the time to
help promote sleep awareness."
Dement is considered the world's leading
authority on sleep, sleep deprivation and the
diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders.
In 1970, he founded the Stanford Universi
ty Sleep Disorders Center, of which he cur
rently serves as director.
I le also launched the American Sleep Dis
orders Association, founded the American
Board of Sleep Medicine and founded the
scientific journal Sleep. Dement has also
served as chairman of the National Commis
sion of Sleep Disorders Research.
