in response to growing interest and
research advances in Huntington's Dis
ease, a group of students and faculty at
Stanford initiated the I hmtington's (Jut
reach Project for Education at Stanford
last year.
The goal of the project is to educate
the public on the disease and to consoli
date the rapidly growing literature on it
into a coherent, reliable Web resource,
thus bringing scientific research on the
disease to the general population. The
project development team is comprised
of undergraduate students from many

academic fields and faculty members
from the Department of Anthropological
Sciences. The project is a non-profit pub
lic service undertaking, funded entirely
by private sources.
Huntington's Disease is a debilitating
and incurable genetic disorder that is
characterized by neurological deteriora
tion and uncontrollable movement. The
disease causes deterioration of nerve cells
in the brain, prompting significant
changes in one's ability to think, feel, and
move. It has been traced to a genetic mu
tation that affects the huntington protein,
whose function is still unknown.
Those affected with the disease nor
mally begin exhibiting symptoms be

tween the ages of 30 and 50, and even
tually die of pneumonia, heart failure
or other complications. Because of the
late onset of the disease, people with
the disease may have children before
discovering that they have the disease,
thus potentially passing the deadly
gene to their kin. For this reason, ge
netic testing for the disease has been
given special consideration.
"Our site focuses on teaching the sci
ence behind the disease and 011 exposing
a public readership to the most current
disease research," said senior and project
leader Amy Hsu. "By presenting scien-
