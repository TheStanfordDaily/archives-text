# Disease outreach program is developed

### DARWIN CHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
in response to growing interest and
research advances in Huntington's Dis
ease, a group of students and faculty at
Stanford initiated the I hmtington's (Jut
reach Project for Education at Stanford
last year.
The goal of the project is to educate
the public on the disease and to consoli
date the rapidly growing literature on it
into a coherent, reliable Web resource,
thus bringing scientific research on the
disease to the general population. The
project development team is comprised
of undergraduate students from many

academic fields and faculty members
from the Department of Anthropological
Sciences. The project is a non-profit pub
lic service undertaking, funded entirely
by private sources.
Huntington's Disease is a debilitating
and incurable genetic disorder that is
characterized by neurological deteriora
tion and uncontrollable movement. The
disease causes deterioration of nerve cells
in the brain, prompting significant
changes in one's ability to think, feel, and
move. It has been traced to a genetic mu
tation that affects the huntington protein,
whose function is still unknown.
Those affected with the disease nor
mally begin exhibiting symptoms be

tween the ages of 30 and 50, and even
tually die of pneumonia, heart failure
or other complications. Because of the
late onset of the disease, people with
the disease may have children before
discovering that they have the disease,
thus potentially passing the deadly
gene to their kin. For this reason, ge
netic testing for the disease has been
given special consideration.
"Our site focuses on teaching the sci
ence behind the disease and 011 exposing
a public readership to the most current
disease research," said senior and project
leader Amy Hsu. "By presenting scien-
tilit information in a user-friend
ly, graphically-enhanced format,
we hope to make information
about the disease accessible to
more people, especially families
affected by it."
The Web site is divided into four
main sections: basics of the disease,
research, potential treatments and
related science. Of particular inter
est to patients is the potential treat
ments section, which explains
many of the drug discovery efforts
currently underway and their sci
entific basis.
"The site aims to demystify and
de-stigmatize Huntington's Dis
ease in our society," said senior
and project Web designer Shawn
Fu. "Those interested in or are af
flicted with the disease will gain a
thorough understanding of the
disease and a realistic assessment

of the current state of knowledge."
Anthropological Sciences Prof .
Bill Durham serves as faculty ad
visor for the project along with
Asst. Prof. Joanna Mountain. He
has high praise for the under
graduate team.
"The project has come fur
ther, faster, better in one year
than 1 ever dreamed possible,"
Durham said. "The student par
ticipants have made truly heroic
efforts to share their knowledge
and insight with a greater audi
ence. It's a major contribution to
the community."
Project leaders are currently
looking for additional students
with backgrounds in biology or
,Web design to fill paid summer
positions with the possibility of
continuing into next academic
year. Those interested in applying
should contact hopesmail@stan
