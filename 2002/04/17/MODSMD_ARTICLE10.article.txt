U
The federal Food and Drug Admin
istration has approved on Friday a
new, laser-less procedure called con
ductive keratoplasty (CK) for the
treatment of farsightedness, a condi
tion that affects about 20 percent of
the U.S. population. Stanford Uni
versity Medical Center, where the first
half-dozen cases in the United States
were performed in a clinical trial, is
one of the only places in the country
to offer the procedure.
"CK opens up a whole new way of
treating patients with hyperopia
( farsightednesssaid Edward
Manche, MD, assistant professor of
ophthalmology and director of
cornea and refractive surgery at
Stanford University's School of Med
icine. "This non-cutting, laser-less
procedure has some real advantages.
It's extremely fast — about three min
utes per eye. It puts treatments on the
periphery of the cornea, leaving the
central portion untouched. And it
leaves no scarring in the central part
of the cornea." The procedure may
also be better suited for older pa
tients who are more prone to having
dry eyes, an occasional problem with
LASIK, a popular laser eye surgery
that corrects vision problems,
Manche said.
