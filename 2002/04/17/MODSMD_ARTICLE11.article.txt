WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Repub
licans yesterday used the threat of an Iraqi
oil embargo and the lure of jobs to try to
boost support for oil drilling in an Arctic
wildlife refuge as the Senate neared a vote
on the issue.
Alaska's two senators on Tuesday intro
duced the long-awaited amendment diat
would lift a congressional ban on drilling in
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's 1.5 mil
lion-acre coastal plain in northeastern Alaska.
Within hours, a group of 15 Democratic
senators promised to filibuster the proposal
and 112 iled a motion to cut off debate, setting
the stage fora vote on the issue Thursday.
Republican senators, as well as the White
House, acknowledged they don't have the
60 votes to overcome the filibuster.
Sen. Frank Minkowski, R-Alaska, ac
cused Democratic leaders of "steamrolling"
the bill, noting that the Democratic maneu
ver to force a vote came "after only three
hours of debate."

Democrats, including by Sens. John
Kerry of Massachusetts and Joe Lieberman
of Connecticut, have vowed to use every
parliamentary maneuver to block the
drilling proposal.
In an attempt to peel away a few senators
from the anti-drilling camp, Republicans
offered to funnel more than $8.1 billion
from oil lease sales in the refuge to a pro
gram that would help the ailing steel indus
try and its workers.
The proposal, offered in an amendment
by Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, fell flat and
failed to get any senators to budge. Democ
rats called it "an act of desperation" and
some GOP senators expressed their opposi
tion. It's "a terrible idea," said Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz.
Sen. Jay Rockefeller, I)-W.Va., said there
was no assurance that the House or Presi
dent Bush would go along with linking Arc
tic drilling to steel industry relief. Rocke
feller said he considered the issue dead.
