# What's Up, Doc? Trackable cell phones, reflective clothes, tools
## 
### UDARA FERNANDO STAFF WRITER 
Federal law has required that all cell
phones be able to track their location by
2005. The first phones with this capabil
ity have already hit the market. Sam
sung has pioneered the effort, with its
new (i PS-enabled SPH-N3ooand SPII
A460. Magnavox's MobiIePAL+GPS
not only has GPS technology but even
boasts a red panic button that immedi
ately connects the user to emergency
services.
The e-DMV concept, designed by
Steiner Design Associates for Vision√üx,

provides a booth where you can renew
your driver's license, replace a lost or
stolen license and change your address,
all without interacting with a DMV
agent. The e-I)MV scans your retina to
verify your identity, gives an eye exam
and takes your photo before dispensing
a new license. A scaled-down version is
scheduled to be tested in New Mexico
starting next month. Wider distribution
is scheduled for later this year.
Worried about biking at night? Illu
miNite helps ease your fears with fabric
that's visible at night. The material used
for the new line of IllumiNite bike-wear
is covered with microscopic dishes,

which act like millions of mirrors to re
flect light back to its source. In tests, par
ticipants were able to identify wearers
from up to 1,000 feet away. The retail
price is $65 for wind pants and $85 for
a jacket.
American Tool's Vise-Grip Toolbox
Multi-Tool is a Swiss army knife gone
heavy duty. It gives you seven tools in
one: a wire cutter, scraper, serrated
knife blade, smooth knife blade, re
versible screwdriver and a quarter-inch
bit holder for hex drivers. And all of this
is stored in the body of your everyday
size pair of locking pliers. The projected
price is $30.
