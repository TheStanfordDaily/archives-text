WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans sought to
nudge Rep. James Traficant toward resignation yes
terday, following his conviction on federal bribery
and tax evasion charges, but the Ohio lawmaker de
clined to say whether he would comply.
"Felons belong in jail and not in Congress," said
Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., who intro
duced legislation to expel the nine-term lawmaker.
"He has broken the public trust by breaking the law
and if he will not voluntarily leave this house, our
duty is to remove him."
Sensenbrenner, the chairman of the House Judi
ciary Committee, acted after House Majority Leader
Dick Armey, R-I exas, said GOP lawmakers feel that
Traficant should resign.
"My own view is that the normal course of events
would probably lead to expulsion," Armey said.
Traficant was found guilty last week of taking kick
backs from staff and bribes and gifts from business
men. The charges, including tax evasion, carry a
maximum penalty of 63 years in prison, but under
federal guidelines he is likely to get much less jail time
when he is sentenced June 27.
Within an hour, House Democratic Leader Dick
Gephardt called for the lawmaker's resignation.

The conviction triggered an automatic discipli
nary investigation by the House ethics committee,
which will decide in private whether House rules
were violated.
Expulsion would require the approval of two
thirds of the 435-member House. Sensenbrenner's
legislation was referred to the House ethics commit
tee with no timetable for consideration.
Only one member has been expelled from the
House since the Civil War. In 1980, Rep. Michael
"Ozzie" Myers, D-Pa., was expelled for accepting
money from undercover FBI agents posing as Arab
sheiks seeking favors from Congress.
Sensenbrenner called on Traficant to resign and
"save the House the need to debate once again
whether felons should continue to serve in Con
gress."
Traficant chief of staff Charlie Straub said Mon
day that the lawmaker had no plans to resign. Traf
icant has also said he will run for re-election in No
vember.
I'he Democratic lawmaker decided not to return
to Washington this week amid warnings his col
leagues would move to expel him if he tried to vote on
the House door, Straub said.
