# Bush to consider vetoes in order to prevent economic meltdown
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — President
George W. Bush told Congress yesterday
he is willing to veto election-year budget
bills to prevent the return of runaway
spending that fueled the Vietnam War in
the 1960s and then caused economic
havoc a decade later.
"If we restrain spending, even though
we're at war, even t hough our economy is
still clunking along, if we react responsi
bly, we can return to a balanced bud
get — something I want — as early as
2004," Bush told the Fiscal Responsibility
Coalition.
He said tough choices must be made
by lawmakers and"I intend to help them
made those choices."
His remarks reflect the hopes of the
White House and some congressional Re

publicans of using this year's budget light
to port ray Democrats as big spenders. De
mocrats, who hope to retain narrow con
trol of the Senate and seize the House,
question Bush's priorities.
"If he's keeping spending in check, it's
only those areas like education and health
care" that will be affected, said Senate Ma
jority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.
Congress must consider 13 spending
bills every year, and veto lights would
come during the campaigns for Novem
ber elections that will determine control
of the House and Senate.
"I've got a tool, and that's called a
veto," Hush said. He added that he didn't
think it would be necessary to use it.
Still, it was his first public veto threat of
the budget cycle, and aides say Bush is

willing to take the risks that would come
with a veto. Many Republican lawmakers
favor higher spending than Bush has
proposed for highways, schools, veterans
and other programs, and they would not
appreciate being forced to choose be
tween supporting spending that appeals
to voters and backing a popular presi
dent.
For Bush, casting a veto would be po
litically complicated because any bill
reaching his desk would have been ap
proved by the GOP House. White I louse
aides say the threat alone could stiffen the
resolve of GOP lawmakers on spending
bills.
"We must not repeat the mistakes in
the '60s, when increased spending re
quired by war was not balanced by slower

spending in the rest of government; that
the appropriators thought, 'What the
heck, we'll just spend it on everything
without any fiscal discipline in Washing
ton, D.C.' And, as a result, in the '70s we
faced unemployment and growing
deficits and spiraling inflation."
Bush's budget calls fora big increase in
military spending to light the war on ter
rorism, and increased funding for home
security programs, too. Most other pro
grams are held to minimal increases,
often less than inflation, and many would
be cut.
This year, it appears unlikely that law
makers will complete a budget because
of differences between the two c ham
bers. While the House's budget largely
echoes Bush's themes, the Senate's

would trim his long-range defense
spending plans and ignore his proposal
to make last year's $1.35 trillion, 10-year
tax cut permanent.
Using Congressional Budget Office
figures, Bush proposed $768 billion for
next year for discretionary programs —
everything but automatic benefits like
Social Security — for an increase of near
ly 7 percent.
The defense portion would grow from
$351 billion this year to $396 billion next
year, a 13 percent increase. Non-defense
would grow from $369 billion to $372 bil
lion, or 0.8 percent.
Democrats say when you factor out do
mestic security, which gets a big increase,
the rest of the non-defense programs
would be cut by 2 percent.
