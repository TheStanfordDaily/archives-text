## The 						Stanford Daily Grad student health care subsidies a worthy cause 
### 
Published Since 1891

We believe that the University's
move to subsidize over half of
graduate-student health insur
ance and a portion of that of
graduate student spouses and children is an
important step toward improving the quality
of graduate student life at Stanford. The $ 188
subsidy that the University plans to gi ant to
each single graduate student applying for Car
dinal Care brings the quarterly enrollment fee
down to a very affordable $ 180.
The approximately $3 million that this
program will cost the University represents a
commitment to its graduate students. Be
cause graduate students are older than un
dergraduates — and because some teach
courses and act as research assistants to pro
fessors — their role straddles the line between
student and employee. Graduate students are
as old as many in the work force, and they de-

serve decent living conditions and affordable
health care. They should not be forced to
trade doctor visits for other necessities.
Health care was one of the three major com
plaints of graduate students on the survey con
ducted by the Graduate Student Council ear
lier this year. The subsidy the University is
proposing does a great deal to alleviate the
problems specified therein.
The costs for spouse and child health
care, however, remain prohibitively expen
sive for many. Relatively few graduate stu
dents take advantage of this program be
cause of its cost. Also, some graduate student
spouses are either students themselves or
are in the workforce and have health care
provided by their employers.
Part of the reason for the high costs is ad
verse selection. Generally, only those spouses
and dependents who have high health-care

costs and are not otherwise covered are part of
Cardinal Care. Others do not find it cost-effi
cient to join at the high premium prices. Be
cause of this, this group is identified as an ex
pensive group and premiums are increased.
This makes Cardinal care less desirable for
spouses and children of graduate students
who do not have or do not anticipate high
health care costs. And so fewer patients with
low payouts opt for this program, driving the
costs up every year.
The University has already committed sig
nificant funding to reduce the quarterly pre
miums: It subsidizes the $1,370 per quarter
rate for graduate students and spouses so that
it costs only $732 for those receiving a full sub
sidy; it subsidizes the $2,114 rate fora gradu
ate student, a spouse and one child to $1,026;
and it subsidizes the $2,711 rate for student,
spouse and two children to $ 1,173.

I his editorial represents the views of the members of'the Daily's editorial board. The board consists of The Daily's editor in chief, managing editor for daily special sections, two opinions
editors and three community members at-large. Signed columns and contributions are the view of the writer and do not necessarily represent the view of the editorial board.

Although the cost is still too high for each
of these programs, the commitment of the
University to lower the cost is commendable.
The exorbitant costs of health care are deter
mined by forces beyond Stanford's control
and the phenomenon of adverse selection is
difficult to overcome in a manner that is eq
uitable to everyone.
These subsidies represent a good first step
in an effort to improve graduate student life
at Stanford. But a lot is still lacking: Cardinal
Care still does not cover dental and vision ex
penses, for example. These holes in cover
age are still serious problems and need Uni
versity attention.
We understand the University's resources
are not infinite, but further improving graduate
student health care and housing should be a fi
nancial priority for Stanford. At any rate, these
subsidies were a good first step.
