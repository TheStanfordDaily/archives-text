# RUNNING ON EMPTY
## The
						view from the top 
### 
Last summer I visited my friend
Brad in New York. Brad had
stopped out from Stanford to
work at a start-up in the city fora
year and live in a very hip apartment in
Greenwich Village, and by "hip" I mean
"the approximate size and shape of a Tup
perware container."
I came to New York with a single re
quest: to go to the top of the Statue of Lib-

erty. I wanted to climb the
approximately 36,894
steps between her spiky
headband and the
world's largest big toe. 1
would step onto the view
ing platform, look out
across the waters that the
huddled masses had
crossed in search of free-

dom, raise my arms and possibly sing
"America the Beautiful."
My ancestors gambled their lives for
the chance to see that statue. The least I
could do was get on a ferry.
When we got off the subway, we discov
ered that the reason the Statue of Liberty
is such an enduring symbol of national
unity is that at any point in time roughly
8.6 percent of the U.S. population is wait
ing in line to see it.
If you look at pictures of Earth from the
moon, you can see the Great Wall of China,
and ifyou look a little to the left you can see
the slightly smaller line of people waiting to
go see the Statue of Liberty. Some of the
people towards the end of the line I saw are
probably still waiting in line, having sur
vived for nine months on roasted chest
nuts and shelters hastily constructed from
postcards and green foam headbands.
We decided to try the next most
climbable object in New York: the World
Trade Center.
To be honest, I was not all that im
pressed by the World Trade Center at
first. We bought our tickets from two stu
dents scalping in the lobby and rounded a
corner to find another line snaking
around a plush carpeted lobby. The hud
dled masses had followed tis.
We were sluggish, as were most of the
American tourists in line. The only energy
came from a group of 20 French high
school students directly behind us.
They were led by a beleaguered-look
ing teacher who frequently shouted
"Arret-ca!" at no one in particular and
who closed his eyes often, possibly visual
izing a glass of Beaujolais.
The group was loud, especially the
boys, all of whom possessed an abundance
of a certain "je ne sais quoi," which trans
lates roughly to "acid-washed denim."
The boys also each sported a head of
shocking pink hair. Rosy smudges arotind
their hairlines indicated that this was a
brand-new look for their U.S. debut. Note
to U.S. Customs: it might Ix* a fun and
helpful form of identification if we re
quired all foreign visitors to color-code

themselves in this manner.
After 40 minutes in line and a ridicu
lously long elevator ride, we arrived at the
top of the tower. I immediately took a
photo of Brad that captures in his face all
the joy and rapturous wonder of having
ridden 92 floors to find a gift shop and a
pizza stand.
But the viewing deck was cool. You
could see the entire city, even the Statue of
Liberty and the line of people waiting to
go see it. It was a balmy day, and from that
height the city looked clean and at peace.
We were looking at the Empire State
Building when brilliance struck. I would
manipulate the lack of depth perception
in the two-dimensional form of photogra
phy to create the optical illusion of squish
ing the Empire State Building with my
hand. It would be the greatest picture of
all time.
I am aware that this is perhaps not a
completely new idea. Had I looked closer,
1 probably would have seen a plaque on
that very spot honoring Olga B. Jorgen
bergen of Zurich as the 1,000,000 th per
son to attempt the Squishing Photo on Oct.
8,1979. But at the time, it seemed exciting.
I handed my camera to one of the pink
haired boys. After some animated gestur
ing, he understood my plan. 1 le was more
excited about the Squishing Photo than I
was. Apparently French culture has
reached a point where squishing the Em
pire State Building is fresh. Maybe if 1
moved to Paris 1 would be hailed as some
sort of pop-art genius, and I could wear
lots of scarves and sunglasses in doors. But
I digress.
The young man — I'll call him Yves —
was determined to capture the shot per
fectly. Squinting through the camera, he
gestured frantically antl shouted com
mands like a fashion photographer: "Zat
way! No, down! I say, up!"
I lis friends gathered around. Small ed
dies of tourists paused on either side of us
to avoid getting in the frame and to watch
this pink-headed realisateur grow flushed
as he tried to guide my hand. His friends
joined in. We were laughing and joking in
broken English and even more broken
French, and fora few moments it was re
ally fun to be on top of the world.
THERE!" Yves shouted. I held my
hand still and the shutter clicked. When I
thanked him and reached for my camera
he was still beaming. We saw him later on
the other side of the platform, and he
threw up his arms and cried, "Ma friends!"
I got the picture back. My hand is
squishing a cloud. The Empire State
Building is in no way visible.
But the photo means a lot more now
than it did in July, when there still was a
view from the top of the world.
