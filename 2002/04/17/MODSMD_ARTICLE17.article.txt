ASSU VP criticizes Benson/Arimoto
Setting my personal distaste for this
slate aside, I have been extremely unim
pressed and dissatisfied with the nature in
which Josh Benson and Kendra Arimoto
have conducted their campaign, with nu
merous campaign violations, fabricated
facts and uninformed speculations that
have undermined the integrity that char
acterizes the ASSU. For these reasons 1 ex
press my lack of confidence in their ability
to serve in the position of ASSU executive.
Furthermore, I encourage students not to
vote for them. If you look at their Web site
in comparison with the other slates, you
will find that they lack the knowledge, sub
stance, and detail necessary to affect
change in the University, specifically in a
one-year term. If you support empty
words and inexperienced ignorance, sup
port Benson/Ariinoto. However, if you
want an ASSU that knows how to work for
you, do not support Benson/Arimoto.

Nom Com chair 'insulted' by
Benson claims
I am insulted by the false claims the
Benson/Arimoto presidential slate lias
made with regards the accomplishments
of my colleagues and myself.
They correctly criticize the only one
sentence resolution passed by the Senate
early this year. Unfortunately, they ne
glect to mention that the senators recog
nized (he problem and, after careful con
sideration. passed a bill guaranteeing that
no such resolution would be passed again.
Since then, the only resolution the Sen
ate passed (the Latin American Studies res
olution, which I co-authored) was quite de
tailed and effective: as a result, the Univer
sity has already changed the way it evalu
ates interdisciplinary programs and is like
ly to make even more changes.
Benson and Arimoto were told of this
error in their platform early last week by
members of the Senate Advocacy Com

mittee, but have refused to correct it.
For the Benson/Arimoto slate to con
tinue to falsely claim that the Senate has
not addressed this issue is dishonest,
and disrespectful to the organization
they wish to head.

Benson picks up professor's endorsement
I am delighted to see that Josh Benson is
running for election as President of ASSU,
and I am writing now to note some of the
many contributions he has made to the Writ
ing Program at Stanford. I first met Josh
when, as a first-year student, he won the
Boothe Prize for excellence in undergrad
uate writing. But I also know Josh as a
founding member of the Undergraduate
Advisory Board of the Program in Writing
and Rhetoric, a group that has helped to
gather information on how to improve the
Program; to redesign the Program Web
site and other materials; to make presen
tations about writing to several groups on
campus; and to bring student concerns
and insights to the Program in an efficient,
effective, and forceful way.
Benson would surely bring the same
enthusiasm, clear-sightedness, and lead
ership to the ASSU. .

MEChA co-chairs criticize Daily's
approach to special-fee endorsements
As the Chairs of Movimiento Estudi
antil Chicano de Aztlan we found it very
disturbing to read The Daily's feature on
student elections and find that "coinciden
tally" the MEChA special fee, along with
almost all of the other student-of-color
umbrella special fees, had been giving a
rating of two, signifying that our credibili
ty, and therefore our right to earn student
group funding, was questionable.
1 also found it quite disheartening,
though not surprising, that part oft he rea
son why The Daily found fault with the
MEChA special fee was that "the organiza
tion did not respond to the Daily's repeat
ed requests for an interview." For the
record, neither the chairs, the treasurer,
nor indeed any of the other membership
within MEChA's core of officers received
phone calls, e-mails or letters from The
Daily requesting an interview.
We also find it quite reflective of The
Daily's level of journalistic integrity that,
rather than work harder to insure there
was formal feedback on a special fee of this
prominence, one that provides funding
for the needs of more than eight individ
ual student groups, The Daily would sat
isfy itself with a negative and unfounded
statement that the organization had been
uncooperative.

All of MEChA's core are highly in
volved within the Chicano/Latino commu
nity, many holding staff positions at El
Centro Chicano. As such, all spend a great
deal of time at this community center and
can in fact be found there on almost a daily
basis. Perhaps if the staff of The Daily
spent more time within the walls of com
munity centers actually reporting on those
events and undertakings of a very large
segment of the Stanford student body,
they would have had no problem securing
the needed interview.
The organizations that the MEChA
special fee supports speak for themselves,
and the Chicano/Latino community con
tinues to provide quality services and
events for the entire Stanford student
body. The Daily would do well to ac
knowledge this fact and commit a greater
portion of its future energies to reporting
with accuracy and integrity about all un
derrepresented or minority communities,
rather than continuing to trivialize them
with the assignment of a number, on the
basis of dollar amounts which have little to
do with the reality of the situation.
Because we assure you, the memberships
of these organizations would like to think
that at least in the eyes of their fellow stu
dents, they are not "just another number."
ADRIANA C. LOPEZ AND LETISIA RAMIREZ
Co-Chairs, MEChA de Stanford
Editor's Note: The Daily contacted MEChA in the same
manner that it contacted every other special-fee group, l>y
using the contact information that the groups supplied to
theASSU with their special-fee application.

Martial Arts Program clarifies finances
First off, I would like to thank The
Daily for taking the time to speak with all
special-fee group representatives and
thoroughly researching the budgets avail
able online. That said, I have a few clarifi
cations and additions to make regarding
the Daily's endorsement of the Stanford
Martial Arts Program.
The increase from last year's request was
approved by the ASSU Appropriations
Committee based on the reasons we've list
ed in the online election handbook. To sum
marize, the encouraging growth of the mar
tial arts at Stanford as well as the popularity
of its dorm-based self-defense seminars has
resulted in the increase from last year's
modest expectations.
The quote of $8250 budgeted for re
freshments overlooks the fact that less than
half that amount is actually requested for
special fee, and then only for events such as
self-defense instructor training sessions and
martial arts leader/representative meetings,
which we fee! are directly related to our pro
gramming goals.
Other funding is generated from the
clubs themselves. Similarly, the cited in
crease in accommodations spending —
from $420 to $099, resulting in the cited
138 percent increase — overlooks the fact
that the entire budgeted amount for ac
commodations is $2720, with only 37 per
cent of that requested from special lees.
This brings up the point not stated by
The Daily but which we stressed in our in
terview that SMAP generates 73 percent of
its budget — which totals nearly
$130,000 — from its own members
through membership fees, sales of uniforms
and equipment, tournament revenues and
other fund raising.
The remaining amount is requested
from special fees as a way to keep member
ship fees reasonable for students and to con
tinue the special initiatives that are designed
for the entire Stanford community, includ
ing our dorm-based self L defense seminars,
public multi-group martial arts demonstra
tions and a handbook describing the martial
arts clubs and resources on campus.
We hope this clarifies the write-up on
SMAP in The Daily and encourages stu
dents to continue supporting the existence
of the martial arts as a vital and distinctive
component of Stanford life.

Clarifications about the Stanford
Chamber Chorale
In yesterday's election special, The
Daily made several comments about the
Stanford Chamber Chorale which could
easily be misinterpreted, and which 1
would like to clarify.
First, it is stated that most of the people
who attend our performances are from
"outside of Stanford." This is certainly
true. Over 25,000 friends and family mem
bers of Stanford graduates heard us sing at
commencement last year, and many of the
9,000 who attended University President
John Hennessy's inauguration, at which
we performed, may also have been from
outside Stanford. At our on-campus con
certs, however, the make-up of the audi
ence is significantly different: in recent
years, the proportion of audience mem
bers that are students has risen from 20

percent to around 60 percent.
The Daily also suggest* that students
should not be asked to fund the Chorale's
touring activities, and that the group
should seek other sources of funding. In
fact, this Special Fee request will fund only
around 30 percent of next year's touring
expenses, the remainder of which comes
from significant member contributions,
The Stanford Fund, and private donations
through the Friends of Music.
Yesterday's article also suggested that
"the group should put more effort into
increasing its campus visibility." The
Chorale in this academic year will per
form at 13 separate events on campus, in
addition to ofT-campus and tour perfor
mances.
As the summary in The Daily correctly
stated, one of our most important goals is
to promote the musical arts outside of
Stanford. However it missed a further im
portant point which is that, in doing so,
the Chamber Chorale can attract musical
ly gifted students to Stanford, and so help
to maintain the high quality of all the mu
sical activities which take place at Stan
ford, to the benefit of the whole student
population.

Benson endorsement paid insufficient
attention to graduate student issues
I believe that The Daily's editorial board
was in error to place such little emphasis on
graduate-student issues in their endorse
ment of the Benson/Arimoto slate yesterday.
Out of die three serious slates in this elec
tion, both the Osofsky/Root slate and the
Henestroza/Rodriguez slate have shown
more interest in, as well as knowledge of
current graduate-student issues than the
Benson/Arimoto slate. I had hoped that the
Daily's planned coronation would have
placed more emphasis on this.
Instead, excuses were made about the is
sues being too complex. It is truly unfortu
nate that around 8,000 students have to
deal with these issues, regardless of their
complexity, and if The Daily covered more
graduate-student news, perhaps its editori
al board would realize this.
I am also surprised that the student
group issue was used as a point given to
wards Benson/Arimoto. Having served as
the (»S(' Funding Committee Chair this
past year, 1 have worked a lot with Megan
R(X)t, the current Appropriations Commit
tee ( hair, which is why I became involved in
this election. She has personally met with
virtually all of the undergraduate and many
of the graduate groups, and with myself ini
tiated joint GSCVSenate funding of student
groups for the first time on this campus.
1 would find it hard to believe that after
meeting with all of these groups and l)eing
personally involved in some, that anyone
else on this campus would have a better
knowledge of what student group needs are
than she.
Finally, the GSC is impartial in support
ing candidates as an organization, but that
doesn't prevent individual members from
supporting candidates. After talking with
several of the candidates, I have chosen to
support Osofsky and Root, and urge all stu
dents, both graduate and undergraduate,
to do the same.

Monday letter oversimplifies purpose of
ASSU Senate
I was highly disturbed to see the letter
to t he editor by Elizabeth Aab in Monday's
Daily, which criticizes the very existence
of the ASSU Senate. I think Aab's view of
the ASSU Senate overly simplifies its pur
pose and neglects the worthwhile tasks ac
complished by the body. These people
dedicate their free time to bettering the
lives of students.
Part of the reason why Aab's view is so
common is that most people have never
seen a Senate meeting. The Senate meet
ings look at the different proposals suggest
ed by Stanford students through a variety
of ideological lenses, ensuring that all views
are considered. Individually convened
panels could never accomplish this level of
diverse thought.
Moreover, the ASSU elections provide

fora way to determine which senators
would be best, and they create a "mal
leable, task-oriented and passionate" body.
The week-long campaign process requires
the dedication and drive necessary to be an
effective senator, and Senators want to
carry out their campaign promises. Those
who run legitimately want to better the stu
dent body, not pad their own egos.
1 urge Aab and everyone else to look at
the platforms and qualifications that sena
tors post on the ASSU Web site and
around campus. One way to ensure that
the Senate does not become ridden with
"nebulous goals" is to elect senators who
you feel are passionate and have well
thought-out objectives.
Many in the student body believe the
ASSU is made up of selfish, ego-driven peo
ple who only perpetuate a joke of an orga
nization, but if one carefully looks at the
work done by the different branches of the
ASSU, they would be astounded. 1 recom
mend people consider what the organiza
tion does, how it represents the different
voices of the student body and betters the
lives of students before they are so quick to
criticize it.

Letters overstate importance of
revamping Tresidder
Once again the Stanford campus has
been plunged into the maelstrom of cam
paign llyers and jingoistic slogans that is
ASSU elections. Despite what some may say,
however, it's still new to most of us, which is
maybe why we complain so much.
While a recent stream of complaints has
decried what some have chosen to call "in
vidious political ideologies and bromides,"
we feel that these seemingly erudite cri
tiques are yet another item on the formula
ic laundry list of campaign propaganda.
Thus we were both shocked and dis
mayed after reading three frighteningly
similar letters, placed side-by-side in Mon
day's Daily. Either someone has been
using one heck of a dictionary or these
pieces are the product of some crude cam
paign letter-writing machine, possibly a
rabid CSIO6 assignment.
Seriously, who uses the term "program
matic endeavors" twice in the same letter?
Most people don't say that twice in the same

lifetime, unless, of course, in reference to
their sex life. Then there is the case
gible results," a term used multiple times by
multiple authors. Microsoft Word does
have a thesaurus.
Aren't results by definition tangible, or
has the ASSU of the past only served to gen
erate an ambiguous sense of well-being?
Furthermore, why plagiarize campaign fly
ers by repeatedly citing the "revamping of
the Corner Pocket?" This brings us to our
next point.
There has been substantial emphasis
throughout this campaign on the need to
overhaul Tresidder Union and on the
progress already made on such fine estab
lishments as the Corner Pocket.
1 ndeed, one letter of support commented
that these changes are a "necessary first step
to improving the social life at Stanford." Since
when has the Corner Pocket been a bell
wether for the social success of Stanford stu
dents? This student, who has to rely solely on
public transportation to find a place to hang
out or even just have a "casual dinner," might
not be the archetypal representative of the
student Ixxiy.
This is not meant to be a personal attack,
but to ignore our vast array of social op
portunities— like a baseball game or the
spring musical — is to insult the very di
versity that makes Stanford so remarkably
unique. If you need to get on a bus to in
teract with other college students, a re
vamped Corner Pocket —or even one
vamped the first time — probably won't
make a bit of difference.
On election day, why vote fora slate
whose main focus won't affect students for
another 10 or 15 years? Our advice: Don't
listen to campaign promises ... unless you
are studying for the SATs.

Daily 'misrepresented' roles of MEChA,
AASA, NAACP and BSU in
special-fee endorsements
As someone familiar with organizations
such as MEChA, AASA, NAACP and the
BSU, I feel that their roles in various com
munities have been misrepresented by

The Daily.
For the Black Student Union, the "ques
tionable use of student funds" The Daily
mentions evokes an image of the officers
going out to dinner on the ASSU's dime,
when nothing could be further from the
truth. The officers of the BSU have been try
ing to cut costs all year, and, as the cost of
producing our larger events rise, some of
our prospective events fall by the wayside.
One of our largest events, Soul F(xxl din
ner, a dinner usually held on Parent's
Weekend, is a time for parents and students
to come together and celebrate Black cul
ture. More than food, Soul Food dinner
tries to create a family atmosphere with a
program, ice breakers, etc. Anyone curious
or hungry is welcome.
While The Daily implies this expense is
frivolous, this tradition is one of the BSU's
oldest and most cherished. As traditions go,
however, it gets more expensive every year
as the price of food in the area increases. For
Kwanzaa, another huge program, for ex
ample, by using Ricker dining hall we were
required to use Stanford Catering, which
cost more than outside firms.
If The Daily would prefer a smaller re
freshment budget, maybe adjusting the
prices on Stanford services would be a more
feasible way of correcting this imbalance,
rather than accusing student groups of
wasting money.
In addition, there is a trend in The
Daily's criticisms of some organizations,
such as the aforementioned, to suggest out
side fundraisers. By applying for special
fees, groups have limited fundraising op
portunities, all through Stanford. For
groups as large as these, the limited Stan
ford fundraising opportunities cannot pre
tend to make up a vast part of the budget.
By publicly encouraging groups to look
outside of the special fees given to them by
students, The Daily is misrepresenting stu
dent groups as greedy and irresponsible,
without examining the feasibility or impact
of such a suggestion.
As for AASA and MEChA, both of the
criticisms offered appear shallow. Without
any further information, it appears that The
Daily is criticizing MEChA for bringing a fa
mous speaker like Jesse Jackson while prais
ing MSAN's budget for prioritizing bring
ing speakers to campus. And mentioning
Andrew McDonald's resignation and the in
ternal AASA issues in the fall distorts the ac

tual issue in McDonald's resignation and de
grades the positive and valuable impact of
AASA this year.
In conclusion, it appears that The Daily,
instead of focusing on actual contributions
in the different communities, gave these or
ganizations a rating on a purely superficial
basis, rather dian offering thoughtful cri
tiques: in the case of AASA, raking up Mc-
Donald; in the case of MEChA, misrepre
senting the chairs' accessibility as well as
their ability to manage funds; in the c ase ol
the BSU, accusing them of fiscal irresponsi
bility; and, in the case of the NAACP, ignor
ing their varied contributions to the Sum
lord campus.

Daily's rankings similar to U.S. News
The Daily's special-fee endorsements re
mind me of the yearly c ollege rankings re
leased by U.S. News & World Report. One
important difference is that U.S. News de
scribes in detail its methodology, assigning a
specific weight to each criterion, while The
Daily uses a more holistic approach.
1 find The Daily's approach inconsistent
and troubling. If, lor example, cultural orga
nizations devote significant portions of their
budgets to food, to what extent is that con
sidered negative?
AASA, the BSU, MEChA and SAIO
work endlessly to educate their respective
communities and the Stanford communi
ty at large; their accomplishments should
not be overlooked by The Daily's sloppy fi
nancial analysis of their budgets.
I would like a detailed explanation ofThe
Daily's methodology in analyzing special fee
requests. The one printed in today's Daily is
not sufficient.
And I would like to know how much
weight the financial analysis has in assigning
a group's ranking. Before today, 1 support
ed The Daily, despite having concerns about
the way it covers events at Stanford. I felt it
made an important contribution to life here
% on campus.
Now, I think I might reconsider my sup
port for The Daily and apply my own holis
tic approach.
