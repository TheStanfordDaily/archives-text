ASSU VP criticizes Benson/Arimoto
Setting my personal distaste for this
slate aside, I have been extremely unim
pressed and dissatisfied with the nature in
which Josh Benson and Kendra Arimoto
have conducted their campaign, with nu
merous campaign violations, fabricated
facts and uninformed speculations that
have undermined the integrity that char
acterizes the ASSU. For these reasons 1 ex
press my lack of confidence in their ability
to serve in the position of ASSU executive.
Furthermore, I encourage students not to
vote for them. If you look at their Web site
in comparison with the other slates, you
will find that they lack the knowledge, sub
stance, and detail necessary to affect
change in the University, specifically in a
one-year term. If you support empty
words and inexperienced ignorance, sup
port Benson/Ariinoto. However, if you
want an ASSU that knows how to work for
you, do not support Benson/Arimoto.

Nom Com chair 'insulted' by
Benson claims
I am insulted by the false claims the
Benson/Arimoto presidential slate lias
made with regards the accomplishments
of my colleagues and myself.
They correctly criticize the only one
sentence resolution passed by the Senate
early this year. Unfortunately, they ne
glect to mention that the senators recog
nized (he problem and, after careful con
sideration. passed a bill guaranteeing that
no such resolution would be passed again.
Since then, the only resolution the Sen
ate passed (the Latin American Studies res
olution, which I co-authored) was quite de
tailed and effective: as a result, the Univer
sity has already changed the way it evalu
ates interdisciplinary programs and is like
ly to make even more changes.
Benson and Arimoto were told of this
error in their platform early last week by
members of the Senate Advocacy Com

mittee, but have refused to correct it.
For the Benson/Arimoto slate to con
tinue to falsely claim that the Senate has
not addressed this issue is dishonest,
and disrespectful to the organization
they wish to head.

Benson picks up professor's endorsement
I am delighted to see that Josh Benson is
running for election as President of ASSU,
and I am writing now to note some of the
many contributions he has made to the Writ
ing Program at Stanford. I first met Josh
when, as a first-year student, he won the
Boothe Prize for excellence in undergrad
uate writing. But I also know Josh as a
founding member of the Undergraduate
Advisory Board of the Program in Writing
and Rhetoric, a group that has helped to
gather information on how to improve the
Program; to redesign the Program Web
site and other materials; to make presen
tations about writing to several groups on
campus; and to bring student concerns
and insights to the Program in an efficient,
effective, and forceful way.
Benson would surely bring the same
enthusiasm, clear-sightedness, and lead
ership to the ASSU. .

MEChA co-chairs criticize Daily's
approach to special-fee endorsements
As the Chairs of Movimiento Estudi
antil Chicano de Aztlan we found it very
disturbing to read The Daily's feature on
student elections and find that "coinciden
tally" the MEChA special fee, along with
almost all of the other student-of-color
umbrella special fees, had been giving a
rating of two, signifying that our credibili
ty, and therefore our right to earn student
group funding, was questionable.
1 also found it quite disheartening,
though not surprising, that part oft he rea
son why The Daily found fault with the
MEChA special fee was that "the organiza
tion did not respond to the Daily's repeat
ed requests for an interview." For the
record, neither the chairs, the treasurer,
nor indeed any of the other membership
within MEChA's core of officers received
phone calls, e-mails or letters from The
Daily requesting an interview.
We also find it quite reflective of The
Daily's level of journalistic integrity that,
rather than work harder to insure there
was formal feedback on a special fee of this
prominence, one that provides funding
for the needs of more than eight individ
ual student groups, The Daily would sat
isfy itself with a negative and unfounded
statement that the organization had been
uncooperative.

All of MEChA's core are highly in
volved within the Chicano/Latino commu
nity, many holding staff positions at El
Centro Chicano. As such, all spend a great
deal of time at this community center and
can in fact be found there on almost a daily
basis. Perhaps if the staff of The Daily
spent more time within the walls of com
munity centers actually reporting on those
events and undertakings of a very large
segment of the Stanford student body,
they would have had no problem securing
the needed interview.
The organizations that the MEChA
special fee supports speak for themselves,
and the Chicano/Latino community con
tinues to provide quality services and
events for the entire Stanford student
body. The Daily would do well to ac
knowledge this fact and commit a greater
portion of its future energies to reporting
with accuracy and integrity about all un
derrepresented or minority communities,
rather than continuing to trivialize them
with the assignment of a number, on the
basis of dollar amounts which have little to
do with the reality of the situation.
Because we assure you, the memberships
of these organizations would like to think
that at least in the eyes of their fellow stu
dents, they are not "just another number."

Co-Chairs, MEChA de Stanford
Editor's Note: The Daily contacted MEChA in the same
manner that it contacted every other special-fee group, l>y
using the contact information that the groups supplied to
theASSU with their special-fee application.

Martial Arts Program clarifies finances
First off, I would like to thank The
Daily for taking the time to speak with all
special-fee group representatives and
thoroughly researching the budgets avail
able online. That said, I have a few clarifi
cations and additions to make regarding
the Daily's endorsement of the Stanford
Martial Arts Program.
The increase from last year's request was
approved by the ASSU Appropriations
Committee based on the reasons we've list
ed in the online election handbook. To sum
marize, the encouraging growth of the mar
tial arts at Stanford as well as the popularity
of its dorm-based self-defense seminars has
resulted in the increase from last year's
modest expectations.
The quote of $8250 budgeted for re
freshments overlooks the fact that less than
half that amount is actually requested for
special fee, and then only for events such as
self-defense instructor training sessions and
martial arts leader/representative meetings,
which we fee! are directly related to our pro
gramming goals.
Other funding is generated from the
clubs themselves. Similarly, the cited in
crease in accommodations spending —
from $420 to $099, resulting in the cited
