# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## GSC officers urge grad students to vote 
### FILIPE SANTOS LAURA BACK GUEST COLUMNISTS 
I'M A GRADUATE STUDENT. WHY
SHOULD I CARE ABOUT THESE
ELECTIONS? WHY SHOULD I BOTH
ER TO VOTE?
The ASSU elections for the 2002-2003
term have begun. Until midnight of today
you can cast your ballot at
http://ballot.stanford.edu. In the past days
you've seen hundreds of fliers, many let
ters and articles in the Daily, a few electoral
e-mails. Everyone is telling you about
whom you should vote for. But you are
probably asking: "What do these elections
have to do with me? Why should 1 vote in
the first place?"
And these are fair questions. Not so long
ago we would have asked the same ques
tions. Let us try to provide you with an an
swer, based on our experience as the cur
rent Chair and Deputy Chair of the Grad
uate Student Council.
WHAT ARE WE VOTING ON?
All graduate students are invited to se
lect next year's GSC members and the
president and vice-president of the ASSU.
You are also asked to vote on a set of spe
cial fees that support different services and
student groups.
WHY SHOULD I CARE?
In past years, GSC members have con
ducted advocacy campaigns leading to
substantial improvements in the Universi
ty's support for graduate student life, in
cluding increased stipends, more on-cam
pus housing, the off-campus subsidized
apartments and housing stipend program
and support for student and dependent
health care. Next year's GSC members can
continue these efforts, in these or other
areas. But it takes skilled, dedicated peo
ple, and their priorities will determine
what gets done. You can help make sure
the people elected will succeed at repre

senting your interests and priorities.
I n addition, every year the CiSC allocates
thousands of dollars of your money. The
current (JSC members organized and
funded the 4th of July Barbecue, Thanks
giving dinner and (Irad Nights at FLiCKS,
and co-sponsored other events including
the Winter Ball and the International Gala.
The GSC also provided support and allo
cated funding to more than sixty student
groups for their programming activities.
Do you think your money was spent well?
Do you want to make sure it will be spent
well next year? Choose candidates you can
trust to make responsible decisions.
The president and vice-president of the
ASSU have an important role in shaping
the priorities of the Student Association.
Given the time commitments involved,
usually only undergraduate students run
for these positions. Nevertheless, the pres
ident and vice-president of the ASSU can
be powerful allies of the Graduate Student
Council in accomplishing many of our
goals and improving the student commu
nity at Stanford. This year there are three
slates that have incorporated important as
pects of the recommendations of our grad
uate quality-of-life survey in their cam
paigns and priorities. Choose an executive
slate that will work well with the GSC and
promote your priorities.
You'll also 112 ind a number of special fees
on the ballot that, if approved, will be
charged to your University bill. These fees
will provide direct funding to support ser
vices and groups ranging from the ASSU's
free legal counseling office to The Daily.
Are these services and groups worth your
money? Do you want to let other students
decide for you?
BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THESE PEOPLE!
Everything you need to know about the
candidates is available in their statements,
which you can access from the ballot.
They've described who they are, their

background, and what they want to ac
complish in office. Read these statements
and choose the people who will do the best
job of serving your interests and the com
munity. The groups who have applied for
special fees have also described their
groups and submitted budgets for next
year. You can read about what they're pro
viding to the community and see how they
plan to spend your money.
BUT VOTING WILL TAKE TIME! I'M
JUST TOO BUSY.
Many people, from the current ASSU execu
tive officers to the members of the elections
commission, have worked very hard to make
sure that casting your vote is an easy and
painless process. The voting takes place on
line and all necessary information is easily ac
cessible. Just visit http://ballot.stanford.edu.
Today you have an opportunity to have
a say about who will represent and advo
cate on behalf of graduate students in par
ticular, and Stanford students in general.
You have an opportunity to shape student
voice and establish priorities. What do you
think is most important? Child-care sup
port for students with families? A new
graduate community center? More afford
able and stable housing options? Better
health care for students and dependents?
A stronger sense of community on campus
among graduate students? Bigger and
louder parties? A sensible but firm voice
representing student views to the Univer
sity administration? More funds and sup
port for students groups?
It's up to you to define next year's GSC
and ASSU priorities. Please cast your vote
today: Visit http://ballot.stanford.edu be
fore midnight.
