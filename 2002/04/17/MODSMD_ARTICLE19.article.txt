## Stanford comes up short against No. 5 Pepperdine 
### JIMMY WU STAFF WRITER 
A 5-2 loss at home seems un
characteristic of the Stanford men's
tennis team.
But when you account for the
fact that three of its top five players
were injured, that it was playing
the No. 5 team in the nation and
also that the short-handed Cardi
nal was actually a few games away
from pulling off the victory, it was a
great effort.
No. 5 Pepperdine (19-5) came
into Taube Family Tennis Stadium
yesterday afternoon and handed
the No. 6 Cardinal (19-3,5-0 Pacif-

MEN'S TENNIS
Tuesday: No. 5 Pepperdine 5,
No. 6 Stanford 2

ic 10 Conference) its second home
loss of the season.
However, even before the match
began, the team was already down
by one doubles match and singles
match. This was because the three
injuries to senior K.J. Hippensteel,
junior Ryan Haviland and fresh
man Sam Warburg limited the Car
dinal to a five-person lineup.
"[They] were all nursing in
juries and therefore decided to sit
out the match," said head coach

Dick Gould. "Hopefully, we'll have
some of them back for this week
end's matches."
At the beginning, the Waves
needed to win one of the two re
maining doubles matches to clinch
the point. However, Stanford's two
pairs of top-ranked juniors Scott
Lipsky and David Martin (30-6)
and sophomore Joe Kao and fresh
man Phil Sheng (0-1) came very
close to capturing it themselves.
Kao and Sheng played well,
considering it was the first time
they played together all season.
They played the llth-ranked Se
bastien Graeff and Stefan Suter to a
close 9-8 loss.
At No. 1 doubles, Lipsky/Martin
played a tough team in the nth
ranked pair of Johan Berg and A1
Garland and were handed only
their sixth defeat of the season, 8-3.
Now down a doubles point and
a singles point by default, the Car
dinal needed to win four of the five
remaining singles matches without
its Nos. 1,4 and 5 players.
Senior Chris Meyer (0-3) played
in his first dual match all season at
No. 5 and gave Graeff a good run,
but succumbed at the end, 6-2,6-3.
Now only one point away from a
loss, the Cardinal needed to win
each of its remaining four singles
matches. It was almost able to pull
it off against one of the best lineups
in the nation.
All four matches went into nail
biting third sets. However, only
two went the Cardinal's way.
The rapidly-improving Kao (7-
6) recovered from a poor first-set
and played well at No. 4 singles de
feating Steve Racioppi 1 -6,6-3,6-2.
Still up 3-1, the Waves clinched
the match when 46th-ranked
Martin (26-5) was unable to reel
in the upset over top-ranked Gar
land, and lost at No. 1 .singles, 2-6,
6-3, 6-4.
At No. 2 singles, 76th-ranked
Lipsky (29-8) fought through a first
set loss and gave the Cardinal its
second point of the night with a 4-
6, 7-6, 6-2 upset victory over 64th
ranked Suter.
Sheng battled hard at No. 3
singles but ended tip on the
short end against Johan Berg, 7-
5, 4-6, 7-6. Regardless of the
loss, Gould was happy with the
team's performance.
"Considering that we only had
five guys, I thought it was a really
good effort," he said. "I was very
pleased that the guys stepped up.
Pepperdine is a good team, and for
a while, I thought that we might

have been able to pull it out."
Kao believed that such a try
ing match showed a lot about
the character of the squad.
"I think it showed that we all

have a lot of confidence in each
other," he said. "With three of
the players out, it was our
chance to solidify the lower half
of the lineup by playing the
younger players and giving
them experience. This way,
when they're called upon in the
future, they will perform well in
big matches."
