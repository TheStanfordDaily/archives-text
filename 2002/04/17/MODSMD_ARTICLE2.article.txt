Students seem excited about
the prospect of another after
dinner alternative.
"It is a great addition to the
downtown; another place stu
dents can go late at night," Kristin
Schleicher, a freshman said.
Srinivas Panguluri, a junior,
said "There aren't that many in
teresting ice cream places in Palo
Alto; it would be nice to have one
that was different."
Chan commented that he had
been looking into store locations
in Palo Alto over the past two
years.
"Traditionally, our stores do
well in college towns. We've been
looking into the downtown area
for quite a while," Chan said.
He came across the Town and
Country store location late last

A new ice cream shop from
the Arizona-based Cold Stone
Creamery opens its doors for
business today in Town and
Country Village.
Though there are numerous
Cold Stone Creamery locations
around the nation, this is the first
one to open in the Palo Alto area.
Owner Alex Chan said the
Cold Stone franchise has tried to
set itself apart from other ice
cream establishments.
"A couple things make us dif
ferent," Chan said. "We make the
products fresh every day, literal
ly making ice cream in the back of
the store. Also, these days the
consumer wants everything cus
tomized, and we're the only store
that allows fora completely cus-

year and construction started
shortly thereafter. .
"We found the space in late
November; it took about two and
a half months to get permits and
then construction began," Chan
said. "Construction took about
two months."
Hideki Hirabayashi, the
store's manager, explained
what factors contributed to the
decision to develop .in the
Town and Country Village
Shopping Center.
"It is a fabulous area,"
Hirabayashi said. "Town and
Country is right across the street
from both Stanford and Palo Alto
High School. It is a great location
with an open-air environment
and good traffic."
Chan and his team have al
ready started spreading the news
of the location's opening.
"We are trying to alert local
newspapers, and also we are
having a grand-opening party
on Tuesday night before the
store opens on Wednesday,"
Chan said.
However, Chan attributed
most of the hype to the store's fu
ture customers.
"A lot of the buzz is from word
of mouth," he said. "The news re
ally gets out quickly when people
are anticipating the opening and
talking about it."
While many students claimed
they were anxiously awaiting the
arrival of the Cold Stone Cream
ery, others were not yet familiar
with the franchise.
"I have no idea what that is,"
said Cindy Lee, a freshman.
Hirabayashi commented that
so far, the response to the up
coming opening has been strong.
"It has been fabulous,"
Hirabayashi said. "Many people
have come by asking when we
will open. Many are also asking
for applications to work, we've
run out of them twice so far."
Chan said he expects the loca
tion will employ approximately
20 to 25 individuals. About half
of those employees will be Stan
ford students.
" People are very excited about
the whole thing," Chan said. "It
will be nice to finally open."
