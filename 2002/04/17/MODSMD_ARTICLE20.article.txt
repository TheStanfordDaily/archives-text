Given the opportunity to spend
this weekend in Tuscaloosa, Ala.,
most Stanford students would in
stead choose to stay on campus
and party, hang out with the
ProFros or just do homework.

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
Thursday-Saturday: No. 10
Stanford competes in tne NCAA
Championships, Tuscaloosa,
Ala., All day

I lowever, the Stanford women's
gymnastics team is looking forward
to its trip to the deep south with
high levels of excitement.
And why, exactly, would a
group of athletes be so eager to
travel to Alabama?
For the opportunity to take on
the nation's best in the NCAA
Championships.
After wrapping up an intense
regional meet on April 0 in Den
ver, (Colorado, the No. 10 (Cardinal
earned the opportunity to com
pete in its second national champi
onship meet in a row and fourth in
Stanford history.

Even though Stanford tied with
No. 3 Georgia at regionals with a
final tally of 196.125, Stanford was
named the regional champion as a
result of an event-score tiebreaker.
Normally, each team performs
with six gymnasts, and the final
team score includes only the top
five scores. However, in the case of
a tie, both teams have to count the
sixth score in each event fora new
average total.
Because of its strong perfor
mance with only one fall on the
night, Stanford's team score wasn't
affected as much as (Georgia's by t he
extra score and the Cardinal was
declared regional champions.
Stanford has been working all
year long in order to have its best
performance this weekend. Since
practices started, head coach Kris
ten Smyth has been emphasizing
constant improvements and peak
ing at the right time.
And what better time to peak
than at the NCAA Championships?
"Especially at this level, every
team is competitive," said Smyth.
"With so many great teams, win
ning comes down to who does the

little things on this one night,
and we have been working con
stantly on these things such as
landings and having unique and
creative routines."
Twelve other schools will be
competing with Stanford in
Tuscaloosa on Thursday. Halt of
these teams will move on to battle
in the Friday competition known
as the Super Six. The individual fi
nals will take place on Saturday.
CBS will televise the meet on a
tape-delayed basis on Sunday
from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.
The 12 teams performing on
Thursday are randomly split into
two groups, either competing in
the morning or evening. The
morning session, scheduled to
start at 10 a.m., includes No. 12
Arizona, No. 3 Georgia, No. 5
Michigan, No. 6 LSU, No. 4 Utah
and No. 8 Nebraska.
Stanford will compete in the
evening session, scheduled lor 4
p.m., along with No. 2 Alabama,
No. 15 Florida, No.'ll Min
nesota, No. 13 Oregon State
and No. 1 UCLA.
In the six rotations, Stanford
will first compete on the bars
and then the beam. Following a
bye, the Cardinal will take to the
floor, test itself on the vault and
culminate the night by watching
the rest of the teams finish their
last rotation as it sits out for an
other bye.
If Stanford places in the top
three (out of six) in the evening
competition, it will continue on to
compete in Friday's Super Six.
Making it to this point in the
competition is a dilFicult task to
achieve. Teams that have already
been established and have com
peted several times in the Super
Six tend to use experience to their
advantage.
However, this could be Stan
ford's year to shine and become
one of the established teams in the
gymnastics world.
"In nationals, you can be com
petitive with anyone in the coun
try," said Smyth. "Just going there
and being able to compete with
these teams will give Stanford na
tional recognition."
Considering the excellent
chance Stanford has of perform
ing in each competition this
weekend, perhaps taking a trip
to Alabama to watch the team
compete doesn't seem like such a
bad idea.
