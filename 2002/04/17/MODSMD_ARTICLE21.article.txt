# Jillian Camarena
## IN THE "THROWS" OF SUCCESS 
### MINAYO NASIALI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After storming the field and dominating last sea
son, Jillian Camarena launches into her sophomore
year as the leading Cardinal shot putter on the
women's track team and one of the top collegiate
throwers. Indeed, she is generating buzz about a pos
sible campaign for the 2004 Olympics.
In her first season at Stanford, Camarena set the
freshman school record in the shot put with a throw
of 53 feet, 9 inches, qualifying automatically for the
NCAA Championships and placing third at the Pacif
ic-10 Conference Championships.
She finished second at the U.S. Junior National
Championships, and earned a spot on Team USA,
which competed at the Junior Pan American Cham
pionships in Argentina. Wining the gold medal at
the Junior Pan American Championships with a
throw of 52-2, Camarena placed"ninth at the USA
Outdoor Championships in Eugene, Ore. and fin
ished third at the indoor Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation Championships.
She is currently ranked second all-time in Stanford
history in the shot put.
Camarena's impressive athletic career began, not
with a shot put, but with a leotard and bare feet. At age
three, she Ijegged her parents to follow in the foot
steps of her older sister by taking gymnastics lessons
in her native town of Woodside.
This three-year-old tyke took gymnastics by storm
- tumbling like mad on the mats - and managing to
earn a first place with her impressive feats.
However, when Camarena remembers this early
victory, she merely smiles and shrugs and with a
laugh says,"I can barely remember those days; I just

have a picture showing me in a leotard on stand."
With her abundant energy and need for activity, Ca
marena spent her elementary years on the play
ground.
She says,"I was always that tall tomboy playing
kickball and tetherball with the guys."
Nearing high school, she channeled this dynamic
athleticism into a passion for sports. At the urging of
her older brother, she began throwing discus and
shot put in seventh grade. Throughout high school,
Camarena divided her athletic time between track
and field, volleyball, and basketball.
In high school, Camarena was the 2000 California
state champion in the discus. In 1999, she was the Cal
ifornia state champion in the shot put, and runner-up
in the discus.
She was a 1999 and 2000 Ail-American, and a
member of the 1999 U.S. Junior National Team. In
1999, she was a Junior Pan American champion in
the discus, the Sacramento Bee Track Woman Per
former of the year, and a four-time state champi
onship qualifier.
With the momentum from her highschool accom
plishments, Camarena entered Stanford ready to
begin the next phase of her career. While characteriz
ing high school track and field as part of her daily rou
tine, and one of her many activities, Camarena recog
nizes that track and field is now the defining factor of
her life in college.
Always conscious of how her choices will affect
her ability to do her best on the field, Camarena
nevertheless recognizes the importance of experi
encing Stanford.

I couldn't stay up past four every
night, I definitely appreciated the
freshman dorm experience."
Academically, Camarena takes
advantage of Stanford's resources
as she focuses her interests on his
tory as her area of study.
After studying the United
States and Europe since World
War 11, and taking Prof. David
Kennedy's history class on Amer
ica in the 20th Century, Camare
na describes American history as
the academic discipline in which
most fascinates her.
"I have an avid interest in
studying the complex relationship
America has with the rest of the
world," she said.
Along with her interest in his
tory, Camarena is learning sign
language, and during the sum
mers spends her time working
with kids in sports camps.
When asked, "Why kids?" Her
eyes light up and smiling again,
she said, "I have always loved
kids. My dream and goal is to one
day coach, teach, and give to chil
dren what I have been so fortu
nate to receive myself."
Camarena looks to former

Stanford basketball player Mark
Madsen and former volleyball
and basketball standout Kristin
Folkyl as the Stanford athletes
who embody the wholesome and
balanced attitude she values.
"I have always looked up to
Mark Madsen and Kristin Folkyl
as they both demonstrated an ex
traordinary sense of what's going
on, and how they are affecting
those around them," she said. "I
admire them for their ethical sen
sibilities in approaching their
sports and their lives."
However, Camarena most ad
mires her parents, older brother
and sister, and coaches as the
models she hopes to emulate.
She remembers the advice her
high school coach gave to her as
she concluded her high school
career and prepared to take on
the Farm.
"My coach said to me, Jillian
just remember that no matter
what, as long as you do your best,
you will succeed and be just fine."
With her focused attitude,
and healthy conception of her
abilities, limitations, and aspi
rations, Camarena is doing
more than "just fine" as she ex
cels both on and off the Held.

"I have always looked up to

However, Camarena most ad
mires her parents, older brother
and sister, and coaches as the
models she hopes to emulate.
She remembers the advice her
high school coach gave to her as
she concluded her high school
career and prepared to take on
the Farm.
"My coach said to me, Jillian
just remember that no matter
what, as long as you do your best,
you will succeed and be just fine."
With her focused attitude,
and healthy conception of her
abilities, limitations, and aspi

She is the athlete to watch as the
Cardinal track and field team
launches onto a promising season.
After storming the field and dominating last sea
son, Jillian Camarena launches into her sophomore
year as the leading Cardinal shot putter on the
women's track team and one of the top collegiate
throwers. Indeed, she is generating buzz about a pos
sible campaign for the 2004 Olympics.
In her first season at Stanford, Camarena set the
freshman school record in the shot put with a throw
of 53 feet, 9 inches, qualifying automatically for the
NCAA Championships and placing third at the Pacif
ic-10 Conference Championships.
She finished second at the U.S. Junior National
Championships, and earned a spot on Team USA,
which competed at the Junior Pan American Cham
pionships in Argentina. Wining the gold medal at
the Junior Pan American Championships with a
throw of 52-2, Camarena placed"ninth at the USA
Outdoor Championships in Eugene, Ore. and fin
ished third at the indoor Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation Championships.
She is currently ranked second all-time in Stanford
history in the shot put.
Camarena's impressive athletic career began, not
with a shot put, but with a leotard and bare feet. At age
three, she Ijegged her parents to follow in the foot
steps of her older sister by taking gymnastics lessons
in her native town of Woodside.
This three-year-old tyke took gymnastics by storm
- tumbling like mad on the mats - and managing to
earn a first place with her impressive feats.
However, when Camarena remembers this early
victory, she merely smiles and shrugs and with a
laugh says,"I can barely remember those days; I just

have a picture showing me in a leotard on stand."
With her abundant energy and need for activity, Ca
marena spent her elementary years on the play
ground.
She says,"I was always that tall tomboy playing
kickball and tetherball with the guys."
Nearing high school, she channeled this dynamic
athleticism into a passion for sports. At the urging of
her older brother, she began throwing discus and
shot put in seventh grade. Throughout high school,
Camarena divided her athletic time between track
and field, volleyball, and basketball.
In high school, Camarena was the 2000 California
state champion in the discus. In 1999, she was the Cal
ifornia state champion in the shot put, and runner-up
in the discus.
She was a 1999 and 2000 Ail-American, and a
member of the 1999 U.S. Junior National Team. In
1999, she was a Junior Pan American champion in
the discus, the Sacramento Bee Track Woman Per
former of the year, and a four-time state champi
onship qualifier.
With the momentum from her highschool accom
plishments, Camarena entered Stanford ready to
begin the next phase of her career. While characteriz
ing high school track and field as part of her daily rou
tine, and one of her many activities, Camarena recog
nizes that track and field is now the defining factor of
her life in college.
Always conscious of how her choices will affect
her ability to do her best on the field, Camarena
nevertheless recognizes the importance of experi
encing Stanford.
She said," I lived in Gavilan freshman year, and while

Academically, Camarena takes
advantage of Stanford's resources
as she focuses her interests on his
