# Card drops three games in a tough road weekend
## 
### DEBORAH SPLANSKY STAFF WRITER 
The No. 3 Stanford softball team (33-
8) was reminded this weekend of the
strength and dominance of the Pacific
10 Conference.
With the Pac-10 filling the top-three
spots of the national ranking, with six
teams in the top 10 and all but one school
in the top 15, every face-off feels like a
championship game.
This kind of competition make the
league one of constant upsets, tough loss
es, and big surprises. This weekend the
No. 3 Cardinal fell victim to a couple of up
sets and one devastating 3-2 lose to No. 2
UCLA Stanford began its most strenuous
travel weekend of the Pac-10 by flying
down to Los Angeles fora single game
against the No. 2 UCLA Bruins.
This match-up between the No. 2 and
No. 3 teams in the nation promised to be a
hard fought battle.
The Cardinal scored first in Bruin terri
tory, in what has become Stanford's trade
mark first-inning attack.
Senior shortstop Robin Walker led off
the inning with a base on balls. She then
advanced to third when senior first base
man Sarah Beeson ripped a single to cen-

ter field. Then with runners on first and
third, junior second baseman Kim Ching
sent a deep sacrifice fly that pushed the
first run across the plate.
Stanford would end the first inning
with a 1-0 advantage and would not wait
long to attack again.
In the top of the second, junior left
fielder Cassi Brangham led off the in
ning with a single before being moved
over when freshman Leah Nelson was
hit by a pitch. Senior right fielder Jessica
Draemel then came through and did her
job when she sacrificed both runners
into scoring position.
Walker would once again be a part of
the scoring machine as she then
knocked in Brangham with a single of
her own, making the score 2-0 for
the Cardinal.
However, the score would not
remain that way for long, as
Olympian senior catcher Stacey
Nuveman answered back in the
bottom half of the second with her
12th homer of the year to close the
gap to 2-1.
Both teams would be silent in
the third, but UCLA would attack
again in the bottom of the fourth
beginning with Tairia Mims reach
ing base on a walk. Then Stacey Nu
veman singled, followed by
Stephanie Ramos' single that drove
in the tying run.
With the game then tied at two
and runners' in scoring position
with no outs, junior Cardinal pitch
er Tori Nyberg took control of the
game. She shut down the following
three batters at the plate.
The Bruins would attempt to
wage an attack again in the bottom
of the sixth but would fail due to

tough Cardinal defense.
With bases loaded and one out,
Stanford made a pitching change
and junior Maureen LeCocq en
tered the circle.
UCLA's Claire Sua came up in
and took, a cut at a 3-1 pitch that
LeCocq fielded and threw home for
the first out. Sophomore catcher
Jessica Allister fired to first for the
double play, ending the inning.
Stanford would get out of the in
ning, and head into the seventh
with the score still tied at two.
The Cardinal bats would once
again be silenced, and UCLA
would come to bat in the bottom of
the seventh with the chance to win
the game.
Monique Mejia led off for the
Bruins with a single and ad
vanced to second base on Erin
Rahn's sacrifice. Natasha Watley
followed with a single, moving
Mejia to third. UCLA's Amanda
Freed then lofted a sacrifice fly to
center field that was just long
enough to score Mejia from third
for the final run of the game.
The game was a true battle be
tween two great teams.

Stanford would then board a
plane again to make the trip up to
Seattle for two games against the
No. 10 Huskies.
Saturday's game would be
come the Cardinal's worst loss of
the 2002 season as it dropped an
11-3 decision to No. 10 Washing
ton in five innings. The Huskies
became the first team to score 10
runs against the Cardinal in one
game since 1999. The defeat was
not reflective of what Stanford is
capable of and the Cardinal was
ready to take back the loss in the
face off the following day. How
ever, the weather would not
allow for revenge to be sought as
the game was postponed until
Monday.
On Monday, Stanford took the
field again hungry fora win, but
Husky pitcher Ashley Boek was
overwhelmingly successful on the
rubber allowing just four hits to the
Cardinal lineup. Draemel led Stan
ford with two hits, while senior Jes
sica Mendoza and Beeson both pro
duced one. Despite the Cardinal's
desire for vengence the game re
sulted in a 3-0 Washington victory.

The No. 3 Stanford softball team (33-
8) was reminded this weekend of the
strength and dominance of the Pacific
10 Conference.
With the Pac-10 filling the top-three
spots of the national ranking, with six
teams in the top 10 and all but one school
in the top 15, every face-off feels like a
championship game.
This kind of competition make the
league one of constant upsets, tough loss

No. 3 Cardinal fell victim to a couple of up
sets and one devastating 3-2 lose to No. 2

against the No. 2 UCLA Bruins.
This match-up between the No. 2 and
No. 3 teams in the nation promised to be a
hard fought battle.

ter field. Then with runners on first and
third, junior second baseman Kim Ching
sent a deep sacrifice fly that pushed the
first run across the plate.
Stanford would end the first inning
with a 1-0 advantage and would not wait
long to attack again.
In the top of the second, junior left
fielder Cassi Brangham led off the in
ning with a single before being moved
over when freshman Leah Nelson was
hit by a pitch. Senior right fielder Jessica
Draemel then came through and did her
job when she sacrificed both runners
into scoring position.
Walker would once again be a part of
the scoring machine as she then
knocked in Brangham with a single of
her own, making the score 2-0 for
the Cardinal.
However, the score would not
remain that way for long, as
Olympian senior catcher Stacey
Nuveman answered back in the
bottom half of the second with her
12th homer of the year to close the
gap to 2-1.
Both teams would be silent in
the third, but UCLA would attack
again in the bottom of the fourth

ing base on a walk. Then Stacey Nu
veman singled, followed by
Stephanie Ramos' single that drove
in the tying run.
With the game then tied at two
and runners' in scoring position
with no outs, junior Cardinal pitch
er Tori Nyberg took control of the
game. She shut down the following
three batters at the plate.
The Bruins would attempt to
wage an attack again in the bottom
of the sixth but would fail due to

tough Cardinal defense.
With bases loaded and one out,
Stanford made a pitching change
and junior Maureen LeCocq en
tered the circle.
UCLA's Claire Sua came up in
and took, a cut at a 3-1 pitch that
LeCocq fielded and threw home for
the first out. Sophomore catcher
Jessica Allister fired to first for the
double play, ending the inning.
Stanford would get out of the in
ning, and head into the seventh
with the score still tied at two.
The Cardinal bats would once
again be silenced, and UCLA
would come to bat in the bottom of
the seventh with the chance to win
the game.
Monique Mejia led off for the
Bruins with a single and ad
vanced to second base on Erin
Rahn's sacrifice. Natasha Watley
followed with a single, moving
Mejia to third. UCLA's Amanda
Freed then lofted a sacrifice fly to
center field that was just long
enough to score Mejia from third
for the final run of the game.
The game was a true battle be
tween two great teams.

Stanford would then board a
plane again to make the trip up to
Seattle for two games against the
No. 10 Huskies.
Saturday's game would be
come the Cardinal's worst loss of
the 2002 season as it dropped an
11-3 decision to No. 10 Washing
ton in five innings. The Huskies
became the first team to score 10
runs against the Cardinal in one
game since 1999. The defeat was
not reflective of what Stanford is
capable of and the Cardinal was
ready to take back the loss in the
face off the following day. How
ever, the weather would not
allow for revenge to be sought as
the game was postponed until
Monday.
On Monday, Stanford took the
field again hungry fora win, but
