# Seniors Liz Britt and Emily Rodriguez
## Beginning a legacy while ending a career 
### KIRSTEN BOURNE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sitting and hearing about the lacrosse
careers of Stanford's two seniors, attack
er Liz Britt and midfielder Emily Ro
driguez, you might think you're listening
to a fairy tale.
The story that unfolds is one of two girls
who came from strong East Coast lacrosse
and could have never dreamed of leading
a Stanford squad as it rockets towards
achieving status as a strong team.
Along with junior Kim Cahill, they de
serve credit for captainihg a team that is
earning more and more respect as each
week passes.
Britt grew up playing lacrosse, and
played on a strong New Jersey team at
Summit High School. She watched as
several of her high school teammates
committed to playing at various near
by East Coast schools, but Britt took
the road less traveled.
"I actually came out to Stanford be
cause it wasn't a highly recognized pro
gram yet, so I knew I could play a big
role," she said.
Her wish was granted as she has
played in every game since her arrival
on the Farm.
Rodriguez relays a slightly different
story about how she ended up playing for
the Cardinal.
Her high school experience was unusu
al in the fact that she went to three differ
ent high schools, including one in San
Diego where lacrosse wasn't played.
This allowed her the opportunity to
focus on her other sports, track and soccer.
Unlike most Stanford athletes, Ro
driguez didn't choose to come here for

the sports. Instead, she calls athletics an
added bonus, saying that playing
lacrosse in college was an "afterthought."
Little did she know that she would
become a captain and key player to an
increasingly strong program.
The beginning of their Stanford
lacrosse careers differ greatly from the
way they way they are ending, largely
due to a different coaching staff, and
accordingly, a different outlook on
team goals.
The Cardinal, under head coach
Heidi Connor lgoe, was enthusiastic,
but lacked the direction and strength
of schedule that current head coach
Michele Uhlfelder brings to the table.
"We wanted to be a nationally ranked
team, but didn't know quite how until
Michele got here," Britt said.
Rodriguez echoed her sentiments,.
"Stanford lacrosse was at that time
happy to be a strong West Coast team,"
she said.
"Michele's goal, and our new goal, is
to make us not a strong West Coast
team, but a strong team all around.
Along with that comes laying a founda
tion for the future, instead of just going
year by year."
It's not easy being at the helm of a
program with such vast goals and while
these two have handled it with grace,
they both admit to feeling the weight of
leadership on their shoulders.
On a team with only four returning
juniors and seniors, the younger play
ers are given lots of accountability.
"Michele wants everyone to share
the same level of responsibility, no
matter how long we've been here,"
said Rodriguez. "She expects a lot

from our freshmen, and as a captain,
it's great to watch the younger girls
step up and fulfill leadership roles on
our team."
Britt says that being a role model
for freshmen has improved her own
game. "I can't believe how much I've

changed in terms of the lacrosse game
itself," Britt said. "I really didn't know
anything when I came, and didn't
have to, but now people come to me
for advice, and I've learned by teach
ing them."
She also realizes the big task the

freshmen have of acting experienced
even when they may not be. She takes to
heart her duty of keeping the team to
gether even when they're not playing.
"I see it as my responsibility to worry
about how thÂ£ freshmen are doing off
the field as well," Britt said.
The seniors will come away from
their experiences on the Farm with
similar fond memories.
When asked about their favorite
memory in the program, both are quick
to respond with the big win against
Vanderbilt in last year's season.
"It was the first time for Stanford
lacrosse to beat a nationally ranked
team and prove how good we really
were," said Rodriguez.
More important may be the friend
ships forged by the two, or as Britt
calls them, "relationships stronger
than just friendship."
Britt says she wishes she could stay
four more years and remain part of this
program that is changing so much.
But for these two, the future holds
new and different challenges.
Rodriguez, a Human Biology major
and Psychology minor, plans to attend
medical school.
Britt, also a Human Biology major,
on the otherhand, will move to Col
orado Springs where she will begin
work as an employee for the United
States Golf Association.
The two seniors leave a team very
different from the one they joined four
years ago as freshmen.
However, these two women will with
out a doubt remain a part of the Stanford
lacrosse family as it continues its hard
work and success after their departure.

better shape than when they started here at Stanford four years ago.
