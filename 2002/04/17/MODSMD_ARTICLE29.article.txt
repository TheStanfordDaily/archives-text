## ELECTIONS 2002 Henestroza, Rodriguez advocate change 
### JOHN HUETTER EDITORIAL STAFF 
"lf you asked me two months ago if
I'd run for the ASSU, the response
would have been a resounding 'No,'"
declared junior Monica Henestroza
with a smile.
But a few weeks ago, the response
changed a bit. Henestroza's tenure for
the Stanford Labor Action Coalition
(she served as coordinator this year)
was coming to a close, and she was
looking for something new for her se
nior year.
So, when the Students of Color
Coalition asked Henestroza to submit
her name for the 2002 ASSU presi
dential race along with sophomore
Nick Rodriguez, she decided to run,
seeing the .ASSU as a chance to consol
idate and focus her interests.
Though Henestroza has little ASSU
experience, Rodriguez has worked in
the organization. Currently co-chair
of the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
Student Life Committee, he has spent
the last year getting to know the body
from the inside.
"I've been fairly active in there,"
Rodriguez said. "I've done my share of
pretty productive projects, but I've
also done a lot of learning."
An ASSU insider and an outsider,
"Nick and I were a good match of ide
alism and pragmatism," Henestroza
said, noting "Each of us was seeking to
find this balance within ourselves."
Graduate students' quality of life is

a primary concern of the duo, and it
promises to be a major issue in the
election.
Henestroza indicated the extent of
graduate students' financial problems
by noting that "the University was
pushing families to go on welfare" but
sugar-coating it, saying, '"It's public
assistance programs, not welfare.'"
Next year, Cardinal Care costs to
graduate students will jump between
40 and 50 percent, Henestroza said,
prompting Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Gene Awakuni to address the
issue. Awakuni, she said, was able to
announce an 80 percent increase in
graduate health care subsidies.
"The problem is, since then, the ad
ministration came back and said,
'Sorry, not 80 percent, 40 percent,'"
she continued.
"Forty percent will just leave them
at the same point as last summer,"
Henestroza concluded. "All they're
doing is just not making things worse .
. . The ultimate issue is that the status
quo is not enough."
Henestroza noted that her experi
ences examining workers' rights with
the coalition had parallels to the grad
uate student problems.
"For workers, it's wages. For gradu
ate students, it's stipends, health care,
child care," Henestroza said.
Her successful negotiations with
the University for the workers would
parallel the work needed to gain ad-

ministration support for graduate
student needs, she said.
"The University says it doesn't
have money," Henestroza said,
but noted "it does find these re
sources when it becomes a priori
ty"
One of Henestroza and Ro
driguez's largest issues is reducing
campus prices. Due to monopolies
like the Stanford Bookstore and
Bon Appetit, they said, prices re
main high.
To solve problems with the
Stanford Bookstore, particularly
the low buyback rate of used text
books, the duo proposed a text
book exchange.
Similar past exchanges failed
due to a lack of resources, they
said. "We think it's important to
invest Stanford Student Enter
prises resources to bring this
about," Rodriguez said.
Both sought better discounts at
the Bookstore, and felt that it was
plausible that the University
would join the students' side on
expanding the student discount to
other basic school supplies or even
increasing the student discount.
"If Stanford wants to gouge its

tourists, I guess that's okay," Ro
driguez said, laughing, "but not
for students."
"I shouldn't have to go and get
a ride from one of my friends to
Wal-Mart to buy binders for some
of my classes," Henestroza noted.
"A stipend just isn't enough if
you're paying for things on this
campus."
The ASSU throwing its weight
behind such issues would produce
results, Henestroza and Ro
driguez feel. As to obtaining
enough student involvement to
back the ASSU, Henestroza noted
that she and the coalition were
able to get hundreds to come out
for coalition rallies. Stanford stu
dents would rally around campus
wide issues even more, she said, if
the ASSU could state, "This is a
student issue without any subdivi
sion."
In this vein, Henestroza and
Rodriguez said that they saw
themselves as bridging the gap be
tween student life and advocacy,
using the latter to improve the for
mer.
"Students are a low priority
with the administration," the
slate's Election Handbook state
ment reads. "... we all have a
common interest to attend a uni
versity that respects and addresses
our concerns."
