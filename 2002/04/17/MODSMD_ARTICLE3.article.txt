# Seniors stressed out over job search
## 
### ANNE BECKER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Senior Misty Espinoza sighed as she
scrolled through the most recent post
ings on the Monstertrak Web site. Es
pinoza, a double major in communica
tion and drama, scours the online em
ployment bulletin board everyday in the
hopes of finding a post-graduation job in
public relations or advertising.
"It's all just really tough," Espinoza
said of her job search process. "As gradu
ation gets closer and closer, my stress
level increases. Things are very competi
tive right now and that puts a lot of pres
sure on a person."
As a result of the current economic re
cession, many graduating seniors are
finding themselves in a similar situation
to Espino/a's. Seniors this year are enter
ing the toughest job market since the last
major recession in 1991, according to Ca
reer Development Center Director
Utnce Choy.
"There's a lot of frustration and anxi
ety about the market tight now," Choy
said. "Clearly it is much more difficult
than in past years."

In a recent survey by the National As
sociation of Colleges and Employers, em
ployers said they planned to hire 20 per
cent fewer college graduates in 2001-02
than in the previous year. Forty-four
percent of respondents planned to cut
back on the number of schools where
they would recruit.
This trend is evident at Stanford.
Choy explained that the number of com
panies recruiting at career fairs has
dropped off significantly and that there
have been fewer postings for permanent
positions on Monstertrak. He also en
couraged seniors to expand their job
search beyond Monstertrak.
"People hate networking, but it is al
ways t lie case that 50 percent of students
get their jobs through contacts they
have through faculty, alumni, friends or
internship experience," he said. "Re
el niters only get 7 percent of hires via
job postings."
Senior Jason Heidema has become a
self-proclaimed at the networking
process in his own search for jobs in com
puter design.
"I'm not a big fan of checking Mon
stertrak and hoping something comes

up," he said. "It's a little too easy."
Heidema, a computer science major,
has been trying to network by sending
letters to contacts of friends and profes
sors and asking for informational inter
views or further contact information.
Though he acknowledged it is a difficult
process, he is optimistic that networking
will yield results.
"There are still a lot of good jobs out
there, you just have to be a good net
worker to get them," he explained.
Choy said that the CDC plans to ease
the networking process for students. The
CDC is currently expanding its Shadow
program, which allows students to spend
the day with a Stanford alumnus work
ing in (Jieir field of interest. The CDC is
also sponsoring an International Forum
on the Internet which allows students to
submit anonymous questions about
working abroad.
At a CDC-sponsored event held yes
terday titled "How to (iet a Job in a Diffi
cult Market," panelists from different ca
reer fields stressed taking an aggressive,
"lateral approach" to the job search.
"Getting a job in itself is proba
bly the hardest job there is," said
Chris Smith, Vice President of
Human Resources at Tularik, a
biotech company. "Exhaust every
possible angle to improve your
odds in the search."
Smith encouraged job-seeking
students to pay attention to detail,
practice interviewing and be persis
tent in their searches. He also sug
gested to "make the search a sys
tem" by setting up a networking
database of industry contacts and
phone numbers.
Michelle Long, a human re
sources oflicer at the U.S. General
Accounting Office, and another
panelist at the event, told students
to thoroughly research companies
in which they are interested.
"One of the biggest problems in
the job search is students not un
derstanding the company and their
own career goals," she said. "Know

yourself and your strengths. Know
that you have something to offer
the company and sell yourself."
Panelists also explained the im
portance of obtaining internships
in their field of interest and con
tacting Stanford alumni for infor
mation.
Though Choy expected stu
dents to be anxious about the job
search, he said traffic at the CDC
has been surprisingly light recently.
"My theory is that it's like the
dentist," he explained. "You have
to make an appointment, but you
don't want to."
Choy also cited the CDC's new
temporary location on Galvez St. as
a reason for the decreased traffic.
He also attributed the decrease in
traffic to the fact that some seniors
are waiting out the recession by
honing their skills in graduate
school or a coterminal program.
Graduate schools nationwide re
ported a large increase in applica
tions this year. UC-Berkeley, lor ex
ample, noted a 76 percent increase
in business school applications.
Lehigh University in Pennsylva

nia reported that undergraduate
student interest in law school was
up HO percent. Choy explained that
the trend illustrates post-Septem
ber 11 student interest in certain
"boom industries" like law, govern
ment and public policy.
Despite the difficult job market,
many seniors remain optimistic
about their searches.
"For whatever reason, I'm
under the illusion that I can get a
job in what I want to do," Heidema
said. "Only when I hit full panic
mode will I think about falling back
on other options."
Steve Doane, a senior chemical
engineering major, has enlisted the
help of a professional recruiting
agency in his job search. He re
mains similarly optimistic.
"We're blessed to be at Stanford
because even if the market is hurt
ing, people still want to hire Stan
ford grads because they're bright
and competent," he said. "If people
are willing to be a little bit flexible
about what exact job they take,
Stanford grads will find work."
Espinoza tries to keep this opti

mism in mind in her continuing
search.
"Everyone's deciding to co-term
now, but for financial reasons I
have to get a job next year," she
said. "It's just really frustrating be
cause companies who used to have
internships don't even have them
anymore. I hey tell you 'We'll keep
your resume on file,' but that
doesn't help me right now."
Espinoza said that even though
she would prefer not to, she is
open to changing her post-gradu
ation plans.
"My default plan is to move
home and try to find a job from
there and save some money," she
said. "It's not my first choice, but
this market doesn't leave me a lot
of options."
Espinoza continues to search for
jobs and hopes that by graduation
her plans will be more certain.
"Something will eventually work
out," she said. "I have faith that I
will do what I want, but in the
meantime it's really hard to be in
this position. It's just a constant
high level of stress."

database of industry contacts and
phone numbers.
Michelle Long, a human re
sources oflicer at the U.S. General
Accounting Office, and another
panelist at the event, told students
to thoroughly research companies
in which they are interested.
"One of the biggest problems in
the job search is students not un
derstanding the company and their
own career goals," she said. "Know

yourself and your strengths. Know
that you have something to offer
the company and sell yourself."
Panelists also explained the im
portance of obtaining internships
in their field of interest and con
tacting Stanford alumni for infor
mation.
Though Choy expected stu
dents to be anxious about the job
search, he said traffic at the CDC
has been surprisingly light recently.
"My theory is that it's like the
dentist," he explained. "You have
to make an appointment, but you
don't want to."
Choy also cited the CDC's new
temporary location on Galvez St. as
a reason for the decreased traffic.
He also attributed the decrease in
traffic to the fact that some seniors
are waiting out the recession by
honing their skills in graduate
school or a coterminal program.
Graduate schools nationwide re
ported a large increase in applica
tions this year. UC-Berkeley, lor ex
ample, noted a 76 percent increase
in business school applications.
Lehigh University in Pennsylva

nia reported that undergraduate
student interest in law school was
up HO percent. Choy explained that
the trend illustrates post-Septem
ber 11 student interest in certain
"boom industries" like law, govern
ment and public policy.
Despite the difficult job market,
many seniors remain optimistic
about their searches.
"For whatever reason, I'm
under the illusion that I can get a
job in what I want to do," Heidema
said. "Only when I hit full panic
mode will I think about falling back
on other options."
Steve Doane, a senior chemical
engineering major, has enlisted the
help of a professional recruiting
agency in his job search. He re
mains similarly optimistic.
"We're blessed to be at Stanford
because even if the market is hurt
ing, people still want to hire Stan
ford grads because they're bright
and competent," he said. "If people
are willing to be a little bit flexible
about what exact job they take,
Stanford grads will find work."
Espinoza tries to keep this opti

mism in mind in her continuing
search.
"Everyone's deciding to co-term
now, but for financial reasons I
have to get a job next year," she
said. "It's just really frustrating be
cause companies who used to have
internships don't even have them
anymore. I hey tell you 'We'll keep
your resume on file,' but that
doesn't help me right now."
Espinoza said that even though
she would prefer not to, she is
open to changing her post-gradu
ation plans.
"My default plan is to move
home and try to find a job from
there and save some money," she
said. "It's not my first choice, but
this market doesn't leave me a lot
of options."
Espinoza continues to search for
jobs and hopes that by graduation
her plans will be more certain.
"Something will eventually work
out," she said. "I have faith that I
will do what I want, but in the
meantime it's really hard to be in
this position. It's just a constant
high level of stress."
Senior Misty Espinoza sighed as she
scrolled through the most recent post
ings on the Monstertrak Web site. Es
pinoza, a double major in communica
tion and drama, scours the online em
ployment bulletin board everyday in the
hopes of finding a post-graduation job in
public relations or advertising.
"It's all just really tough," Espinoza
said of her job search process. "As gradu
ation gets closer and closer, my stress
level increases. Things are very competi
tive right now and that puts a lot of pres
sure on a person."
As a result of the current economic re
cession, many graduating seniors are
finding themselves in a similar situation
to Espino/a's. Seniors this year are enter
ing the toughest job market since the last
major recession in 1991, according to Ca
reer Development Center Director
Utnce Choy.
"There's a lot of frustration and anxi
ety about the market tight now," Choy
said. "Clearly it is much more difficult
than in past years."

In a recent survey by the National As
sociation of Colleges and Employers, em
ployers said they planned to hire 20 per
cent fewer college graduates in 2001-02
than in the previous year. Forty-four
percent of respondents planned to cut
back on the number of schools where
they would recruit.
This trend is evident at Stanford.
Choy explained that the number of com
panies recruiting at career fairs has
dropped off significantly and that there
have been fewer postings for permanent
positions on Monstertrak. He also en
couraged seniors to expand their job
search beyond Monstertrak.
"People hate networking, but it is al
ways t lie case that 50 percent of students
get their jobs through contacts they
have through faculty, alumni, friends or
internship experience," he said. "Re
el niters only get 7 percent of hires via
job postings."
Senior Jason Heidema has become a
self-proclaimed at the networking
process in his own search for jobs in com
puter design.
"I'm not a big fan of checking Mon
stertrak and hoping something comes

up," he said. "It's a little too easy."
Heidema, a computer science major,
has been trying to network by sending
letters to contacts of friends and profes
sors and asking for informational inter
views or further contact information.
Though he acknowledged it is a difficult
process, he is optimistic that networking
will yield results.
"There are still a lot of good jobs out
there, you just have to be a good net
worker to get them," he explained.
Choy said that the CDC plans to ease
the networking process for students. The
CDC is currently expanding its Shadow
program, which allows students to spend
the day with a Stanford alumnus work
ing in (Jieir field of interest. The CDC is
also sponsoring an International Forum
on the Internet which allows students to
submit anonymous questions about
working abroad.
At a CDC-sponsored event held yes
terday titled "How to (iet a Job in a Diffi
cult Market," panelists from different ca
reer fields stressed taking an aggressive,
"lateral approach" to the job search.
"Getting a job in itself is proba
bly the hardest job there is," said
Chris Smith, Vice President of
Human Resources at Tularik, a
biotech company. "Exhaust every
possible angle to improve your
odds in the search."
Smith encouraged job-seeking
students to pay attention to detail,
practice interviewing and be persis
tent in their searches. He also sug
gested to "make the search a sys
tem" by setting up a networking
database of industry contacts and
phone numbers.
