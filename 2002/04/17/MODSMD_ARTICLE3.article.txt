# Seniors stressed out over job search
## 
### ANNE BECKER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Senior Misty Espinoza sighed as she
scrolled through the most recent post
ings on the Monstertrak Web site. Es
pinoza, a double major in communica
tion and drama, scours the online em
ployment bulletin board everyday in the
hopes of finding a post-graduation job in
public relations or advertising.
"It's all just really tough," Espinoza
said of her job search process. "As gradu
ation gets closer and closer, my stress
level increases. Things are very competi
tive right now and that puts a lot of pres
sure on a person."
As a result of the current economic re
cession, many graduating seniors are
finding themselves in a similar situation
to Espino/a's. Seniors this year are enter
ing the toughest job market since the last
major recession in 1991, according to Ca
reer Development Center Director
Utnce Choy.
"There's a lot of frustration and anxi
ety about the market tight now," Choy
said. "Clearly it is much more difficult
than in past years."

In a recent survey by the National As
sociation of Colleges and Employers, em
ployers said they planned to hire 20 per
cent fewer college graduates in 2001-02
than in the previous year. Forty-four
percent of respondents planned to cut
back on the number of schools where
they would recruit.
This trend is evident at Stanford.
Choy explained that the number of com
panies recruiting at career fairs has
dropped off significantly and that there
have been fewer postings for permanent
positions on Monstertrak. He also en
couraged seniors to expand their job
search beyond Monstertrak.
"People hate networking, but it is al
ways t lie case that 50 percent of students
get their jobs through contacts they
have through faculty, alumni, friends or
internship experience," he said. "Re
el niters only get 7 percent of hires via
job postings."
Senior Jason Heidema has become a
self-proclaimed at the networking
process in his own search for jobs in com
puter design.
"I'm not a big fan of checking Mon
stertrak and hoping something comes

up," he said. "It's a little too easy."
Heidema, a computer science major,
has been trying to network by sending
letters to contacts of friends and profes
sors and asking for informational inter
views or further contact information.
Though he acknowledged it is a difficult
process, he is optimistic that networking
will yield results.
"There are still a lot of good jobs out
there, you just have to be a good net
worker to get them," he explained.
Choy said that the CDC plans to ease
the networking process for students. The
CDC is currently expanding its Shadow
program, which allows students to spend
the day with a Stanford alumnus work
ing in (Jieir field of interest. The CDC is
also sponsoring an International Forum
on the Internet which allows students to
submit anonymous questions about
working abroad.
At a CDC-sponsored event held yes
terday titled "How to (iet a Job in a Diffi
cult Market," panelists from different ca
reer fields stressed taking an aggressive,
"lateral approach" to the job search.
