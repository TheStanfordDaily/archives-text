# Benson, Arimoto bring outside view

Juniors Josh Benson and
Kendra Arimoto didn't even get
along when they were first intro
duced by a mutual friend.
"We clashed," Arimoto said,
laughing.
Now, not only are they friends,
they're running together for ASSU
president and vice president.
"I wanted to run because I had
finally reached the point where
everything I had up to this point I
could bring to the ASSU," Arimo
to said, "as idealistic as that might
sound."
Benson said his work on stu
dent groups and University com
mittees allowed him to notice the
ASSU's successes, failures and po
tential. "I started to get a sense of
how the ASSU could better serve,"
Benson said, and opted for that
the executive branch, noting that
it set the tone for the ASSU.
"I think it was we both kind of
had the idea on the same night,"
Arimoto said, but noted each ini
tially thought the other was joking.
"[Litter] he came to me and said,
Tm serious,' and I said, 'Me too.' "
"What we think we have here,
and what we feel our campaign is
about, is solution," Benson said.
Benson figured one of the main
problems with the ASSU was its
lack of communication with stu
dents about its functions. Ask a stu
dent what the ASSU does, Benson
said, "Half the time they say, 'I
don't know,' and the other half say
'1 don't care.'"
Founder of The Stanford Pro
gressive, Benson plans to use his
publishing experience to better in
form students about what types of
issues the ASSU is dealing with.

"We want to completely re
vamp the newsletter," Benson
said. "Bring some students with
publishing experience and bring it
out bi-quarterly, tri-quarterly and
get it to every door on campus."
He noted that after the San
Jose Mercury News ran an article
about the Progressive, its Stan
ford beat reporter continued to
call him about student-related
items such as Stanford Labor Ac
tion Coalition protests, perhaps
because it had no solid contacts
within the ASSU. He planned to
change that in his administra
tion.
"The media's crucial to how
things get done in the ASSU,"
Benson said, noting that media
coverage would give students
more leverage over the University.
He planned to send press releases
and keep in contact with every
publication "in a 50-mile radius."
The administration would have
to confront student issues and be
more accountable, Benson said,
once the media was better in
formed of them by the ASSU.
On the graduate student front,
the two plan to focus upon gradu
ate student housing and help to re
vamp the graduate student hous
ing process.
The current three-stage
housing lottery (spread out over
several months) would be con
solidated into one lottery which
would take into account stu
dents' roommate preferences.
"Grad students need to be able
to live with people who share the
same lifestyle," Benson said.
In addition, he planned to
allow different-sex pairs in gradu
ate housing.

Candidates Josh Benson and Kendra Arimoto, both juniors, want to reform
how the ASSU addresses students and use the power of local media to alert
the University to student interests.
