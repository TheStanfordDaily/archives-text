# Mohanan, Miller urge us to think!

"Not many people are comfort
able about going out and talking to
people randomly," said junior
Malavika Mohanan, when trying
to recall why the student group
Think! picked her to run as their
ASSU presidential candidate.
But Mohanan is quick to
point out that she doesn't speak
for the loose student group. "We
operate by consensus," a mem
ber explained. Nor are she and
her running mate, sophomore
Kellea Miller (who described
Thinkl's selection process jok
ingly as "roped in is much too
gentle"), running a campaign in
the usual sense.
Nor for that matter, do they
even intend to take office if elected.
Are you wondering what's
going on? That's just what they
want you to do.

"We don't have a concrete mes
sage," Mohanan said. "We dis
cussed that."
Instead, Mohanan and Miller
and the rest of the group said they
merely wish to get students to ex
amine themselves and their world
instead of the campus during the
time of the ASSU elections.
"Someone asked me when the
election was, and 1 was like,
'Uh..Mohanan said, laughing.
"What does it mean when,
each year, the candidates are
saying the same things and try
ing to address the same issues?"
asked junior Peter Stair, another
Think! member. "I ran for [the
ASSU Senate] freshman year
and realized the reason I ran was
ego trip.
"All of this is just noise," he said.
"I see all this wasted paper, all this
wasted ink ... I don't think they're
being very respectful to me. When
it's the same thing, every year,

maybe we should try a different
way."
Miller offered a similar per
spective. "To elect people based
on how much paper they can
spend is a little disheartening to
me," she said, adding that she had
approached candidates about
using recycled paper for the tradi
tional White Plaza flyering may
hem.
"Tradition to kill trees!" she
said, laughing.
Mohanan also criticized the
campaigning process. "Right now,
there's so much campaigning, this
whole week just takes away from
ourselves," she said.
The slate has merely a single
campaign sign—a ballpoint
drawn question mark and excla
mation point on a sheet of poster
board taped to a folding table.
"We're the only people who
have one sign which is not affixed
to anything," Stair said proudly.

Mohanan and Miller plan to
stick out the race, although they
cheerfully admit, "I'm guessing
we're not getting enough votes."
In what they said was the un
likely chance they did win, they
would resign, and said they
would make sure voters knew
beforehand.
The duo will use bathroom
flyers, although Mohanan
noted, "I still have something
against the idea of flyering be
cause it takes away from the per
sonal communication."
They said that communication
to inspire reflection is key to the
group and to the point of the cam
paign.
"We're interested in connecting
. .. connecting mind and body ...
connecting people and people,"
Stair said. "Intelligence is connec
tion."

Junior Malaviko Mohanan and Sophomore Kellea Miller wish to call atten
tion to the entire ASSU election, and how it is conducted and perceived, with
their campaign.
They do plan events to increase
this communication and reflec
tion, however.
"[We're] trying to find quality
and interactions with other
human beings," Mohanan said.
The group can often he found,
as they were for the interview, eat
ing lunch in White Plaza in a series
of"uberpicnics."
Mohanan also noted the group
would be participating in a "I)ay of
Infectious Smiles," in which mem
bers would smile at those they
passed by on their way to class
every day.
The group did hit a few campus
issues in the queries they posted in
response to the questions in the
elections handbook:
"When you see this form con
tains a 'students' section and a

'graduate students' section, do you
[graduate students] feel like a sec
ond-class citizen?
"Is it too convenient for us,
elected leaders, and University ad
ministrators, to allow a few to reg
ularly speak for thousands?
"Why are there more dogs
and babies than Stanford com
munity members sitting outside
on weekends?
"As paying clients of this Uni
versity, do we exercise as much
control over our learning environ
ment as we'd like to?
"Are the most pressing issues lac
ing Stanford's graduate student
community even on-campus issues?
Are the most pressing issues for any
of us even on-campus issues?
"It's really good to see that there
are other people out there who are
really happy with their lives," said
junior Nick Handler, another
Think! member, "but are just not
content with the way things work in
general."

'Uh..Mohanan said, laughing.
"What does it mean when,
each year, the candidates are
saying the same things and try
ing to address the same issues?"
asked junior Peter Stair, another
Think! member. "I ran for [the
ASSU Senate] freshman year
and realized the reason I ran was
ego trip.
"All of this is just noise," he said.
"I see all this wasted paper, all this
wasted ink ... I don't think they're
being very respectful to me. When
it's the same thing, every year,

maybe we should try a different
way."
Miller offered a similar per
spective. "To elect people based
on how much paper they can
spend is a little disheartening to
me," she said, adding that she had
approached candidates about
using recycled paper for the tradi
tional White Plaza flyering may
hem.
"Tradition to kill trees!" she
said, laughing.
Mohanan also criticized the
campaigning process. "Right now,
there's so much campaigning, this
whole week just takes away from
ourselves," she said.
The slate has merely a single
campaign sign—a ballpoint
drawn question mark and excla
mation point on a sheet of poster
board taped to a folding table.
"We're the only people who
have one sign which is not affixed
to anything," Stair said proudly.

Mohanan and Miller plan to
stick out the race, although they
cheerfully admit, "I'm guessing
we're not getting enough votes."
In what they said was the un
likely chance they did win, they
would resign, and said they
would make sure voters knew
beforehand.
The duo will use bathroom
flyers, although Mohanan
noted, "I still have something
against the idea of flyering be
cause it takes away from the per
sonal communication."
They said that communication
to inspire reflection is key to the
group and to the point of the cam
paign.
"We're interested in connecting
. .. connecting mind and body ...
connecting people and people,"
Stair said. "Intelligence is connec
tion."

Junior Malaviko Mohanan and Sophomore Kellea Miller wish to call atten
tion to the entire ASSU election, and how it is conducted and perceived, with
their campaign.
They do plan events to increase
this communication and reflec
tion, however.
"[We're] trying to find quality
and interactions with other
human beings," Mohanan said.
The group can often he found,
as they were for the interview, eat
ing lunch in White Plaza in a series
of"uberpicnics."
Mohanan also noted the group
would be participating in a "I)ay of
Infectious Smiles," in which mem
bers would smile at those they
passed by on their way to class
every day.
The group did hit a few campus
issues in the queries they posted in
response to the questions in the
elections handbook:
"When you see this form con
tains a 'students' section and a

'graduate students' section, do you
[graduate students] feel like a sec
ond-class citizen?
"Is it too convenient for us,
elected leaders, and University ad
ministrators, to allow a few to reg
ularly speak for thousands?
"Why are there more dogs
and babies than Stanford com
munity members sitting outside
on weekends?
"As paying clients of this Uni
versity, do we exercise as much
control over our learning environ
ment as we'd like to?
"Are the most pressing issues lac
ing Stanford's graduate student
community even on-campus issues?
Are the most pressing issues for any
of us even on-campus issues?
"It's really good to see that there
are other people out there who are
really happy with their lives," said
junior Nick Handler, another
Think! member, "but are just not
content with the way things work in
general."
