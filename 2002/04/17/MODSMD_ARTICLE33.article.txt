# Brewer, Cordero reflect on past year
## 
### YASI HASHEMI EDITORIAL STAFF 
Editor's note: The Daily sat down with the current
ASSU president, junior Matt Brewer, and vice-pres
ident, senior Christine Cordero, to talk about their
year in office.
Daily: What are your fondest memories of
working as ASSU president and vice presi
dent?
Brewer: One of our biggest accomplish
ments this year has been our ability to bring
individuals together across different com
munities and from all walks of campus life.
One of the things that embodies this is the
photo wall in our office. Every project we've
done . . . we've brought in lots of different
individuals who represent lots of different
experiences.
"[This has] allowed the ASSU to move closer
to fulfilling its vision of harboring a vision for
every student. In the process, we have suf
fered from sleepless nights and academic
martyrdom, but they pale in comparison with
the gratification of fun, growth and relation
ships we have experienced
Cordero: That would be probably the office
hours and dinners we had . . .just meeting
people has been really great. And those early
moments of planning when everything is ex
citing.
Daily: What have been the biggest challenges
you've faced?
Brewer: The hardest part of the job is time. As
soon as you learn how to do the job, how things
work in the University, and how to best ap
proach issues, you're wrapping up the year.
And because of this, it's really important to
take advantage of what's already been done
and to build new relationships, strengthen old
relationships and to build new infrastructures
and institutionalize mechanisms all that ulti
mately association in a more benefi
cial condition.
Cordero: A lot of the politicking, the meet
ings. 1 thought we'd be able to do a lot more
with students, and it turned out that we

spent a lot of time in meetings with the ad
ministration.
Daily: How,.if at all, were your expectations of
the job different from the job itself?
Brewer: When you think about running,
and you go through the whole process, you
become the walking manifestation of what
ever vision or platform you and your co-can
didate represent . . . When Sept. 11 oc
curred, we couldn't have expected it. It was
one example of how we worked with differ
ent students. Over the summer, there were a
lot of announcements about changes in
health care — something we had to work
with the Graduate Student Council on.
There were a lot of things that we couldn't
anticipate — things you couldn't bet on or
plan for. Part of the job is to learn as you do.
Cordero: 1 thought we'd be working on the
ground a lot more. What we ended up doing,
which I suppose is what the ASSU is sup
posed to do, was a lot more facilitating for
what students want to get done ... I thought
we'd be able to get into the middle of things a
lot more.
Daily: How do you feel about the goals you set
out at the start of your campaign and term?
Brewer: All of our focus areas revolved
around the notion that we would seek to rep
resent a vision for every student. The specific
areas we focused on were the arts, diversity,
transportation, internal ASSU improvements
and student group empowerment.
When you look at our report card, you'll
see that with the arts we were able to launch
the Mural Arts program in conjunction with
SOCA [The Student Organizing Committee
for the Arts]. With diversity, we've worked
with Sonrisa Lucero and many other con
cerned students to launch a faculty diversity
task force and research some of the deeper
disparities that affect all students as they relate
to diverse communities.
One of our larger goals was to bridge the gap
between Stanford and the larger communi
ty, and the News Readership Program cre

ates the opportunity to create a more in
formed student community unified behind
awareness.
We've also made tons of internal reform ...
Alex Shvartsman has done a phenomenal job
to lead probably the most productive Senate
ever. Filipe Santos has worked relentlessly
with the GSC to 112 urther the ultimate position
of graduate student voice and condition.
Cordero: I'm probably the harshest critic. I
feel like we accomplished a lot of the goals we
set out for ourselves — because the goals we
set for ourselves were realistic. I think we've
continued in trying to balance advocacy and
life ... We actually did get a lot done.
Daily: What will you miss the most?
Brewer: The relationships we've formed
have been essential to everything we've ac
complished. Our strong bonds with commu
nities of color have allowed us to make sig
nificant process with diversity initiatives.
Our strong bonds with [Housing and] Din
ing Services allowed us to successfully exe
cute Thanksgiving Dinner and the News
Readership Program. Our strong relation
ship with SOCA has allowed the Mural Arts
Project to blossom and our strong connec
tion with the entire student body has allowed
us to represent a vision for every student in a
way that the ASSU has not always been able
to do.
Cordero: Working with students in that ca
pacity, and specifically the internal ASSU peo
ple that were really cool.
Daily: Any words of advice to future presidents
and vice presidents?
Brewer: No pocket of campus life can be ig
nored or avoided, and personal interests must
be placed aside for the larger interests of the
entire student body.
Be sure to get to know the ASSU office staff, for
they will be your best friends and strongest al
lies.
Also, you may find it strategic to set up an
alarm clock in the ASSU office.
Cordero: Take it all in stride, bits and pieces.

Alex Shvartsman has done a phenomenal job
to lead probably the most productive Senate
ever. Filipe Santos has worked relentlessly
with the GSC to 112 urther the ultimate position
of graduate student voice and condition.
Cordero: I'm probably the harshest critic. I
feel like we accomplished a lot of the goals we
set out for ourselves — because the goals we
set for ourselves were realistic. I think we've
continued in trying to balance advocacy and
life ... We actually did get a lot done.
Daily: What will you miss the most?
Brewer: The relationships we've formed
have been essential to everything we've ac
complished. Our strong bonds with commu
nities of color have allowed us to make sig
nificant process with diversity initiatives.
Our strong bonds with [Housing and] Din
ing Services allowed us to successfully exe
cute Thanksgiving Dinner and the News
Readership Program. Our strong relation
ship with SOCA has allowed the Mural Arts
Project to blossom and our strong connec
tion with the entire student body has allowed
us to represent a vision for every student in a
way that the ASSU has not always been able
to do.
Cordero: Working with students in that ca
pacity, and specifically the internal ASSU peo
ple that were really cool.
Daily: Any words of advice to future presidents
and vice presidents?
Brewer: No pocket of campus life can be ig
nored or avoided, and personal interests must
be placed aside for the larger interests of the
entire student body.
Be sure to get to know the ASSU office staff, for
they will be your best friends and strongest al
lies.
Also, you may find it strategic to set up an
alarm clock in the ASSU office.
Cordero: Take it all in stride, bits and pieces.
Editor's note: The Daily sat down with the current
ASSU president, junior Matt Brewer, and vice-pres
ident, senior Christine Cordero, to talk about their
year in office.
Daily: What are your fondest memories of
working as ASSU president and vice presi
dent?
Brewer: One of our biggest accomplish
ments this year has been our ability to bring
individuals together across different com
munities and from all walks of campus life.
One of the things that embodies this is the
photo wall in our office. Every project we've
done . . . we've brought in lots of different
individuals who represent lots of different
experiences.
"[This has] allowed the ASSU to move closer
to fulfilling its vision of harboring a vision for
every student. In the process, we have suf
fered from sleepless nights and academic
martyrdom, but they pale in comparison with
the gratification of fun, growth and relation
ships we have experienced
Cordero: That would be probably the office
hours and dinners we had . . .just meeting
people has been really great. And those early
moments of planning when everything is ex
citing.
Daily: What have been the biggest challenges
you've faced?
Brewer: The hardest part of the job is time. As
soon as you learn how to do the job, how things
work in the University, and how to best ap
proach issues, you're wrapping up the year.
And because of this, it's really important to
take advantage of what's already been done
and to build new relationships, strengthen old
relationships and to build new infrastructures
and institutionalize mechanisms all that ulti
mately association in a more benefi
cial condition.
Cordero: A lot of the politicking, the meet
ings. 1 thought we'd be able to do a lot more
with students, and it turned out that we

spent a lot of time in meetings with the ad
ministration.
Daily: How,.if at all, were your expectations of
the job different from the job itself?
Brewer: When you think about running,
and you go through the whole process, you
become the walking manifestation of what
ever vision or platform you and your co-can
didate represent . . . When Sept. 11 oc
curred, we couldn't have expected it. It was
one example of how we worked with differ
ent students. Over the summer, there were a
lot of announcements about changes in
health care — something we had to work
with the Graduate Student Council on.
There were a lot of things that we couldn't
anticipate — things you couldn't bet on or
plan for. Part of the job is to learn as you do.
Cordero: 1 thought we'd be working on the
ground a lot more. What we ended up doing,
which I suppose is what the ASSU is sup
posed to do, was a lot more facilitating for
what students want to get done ... I thought
we'd be able to get into the middle of things a
lot more.
Daily: How do you feel about the goals you set
out at the start of your campaign and term?
Brewer: All of our focus areas revolved
around the notion that we would seek to rep
resent a vision for every student. The specific
areas we focused on were the arts, diversity,
transportation, internal ASSU improvements
and student group empowerment.
When you look at our report card, you'll
see that with the arts we were able to launch
the Mural Arts program in conjunction with
SOCA [The Student Organizing Committee
for the Arts]. With diversity, we've worked
with Sonrisa Lucero and many other con
cerned students to launch a faculty diversity
task force and research some of the deeper
disparities that affect all students as they relate
to diverse communities.
One of our larger goals was to bridge the gap
between Stanford and the larger communi
ty, and the News Readership Program cre

ates the opportunity to create a more in
formed student community unified behind
awareness.
We've also made tons of internal reform ...
Alex Shvartsman has done a phenomenal job
to lead probably the most productive Senate

with the GSC to 112 urther the ultimate position
of graduate student voice and condition.
