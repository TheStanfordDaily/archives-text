# Brewer / Cordero do not endorse any ASSU presidential slate
## 
### MATT BREWER CHRISTINE CORDERO ASSU PRESIDENT VICE-PRESIDENT 
have done a great job bringing up some is
sues that need to be on the radar of the stu
dent body. As ASSU outsiders, they seek to
bring a fresh and critical approach to the
ASSU. The recognition of and plan for
renovation of ASSU communication with
the student body is a step in the right di
rection. Furthermore, they have recog
nized many other key issues that deserve
ASSU attention and resources such as stu
dent judicial process, faculty diversity and
graduate student housing.
CONS: The full potential of a one-year
term cannot be realized without prior
ASSU experience. In a best-case sce
nario, work can be done to ultimately
"break even" on the year, but the
prospect of profit for student interests is
bleak. I bis lack of experience manifests
itself in the slate's proposed methods of
partnership with both the Graduate Stu
dent Council and Undergraduate Sen
ate. In addition, many valid issues that
are addressed fail to discuss concrete
goals and the "how" that relates to each
issue. Such failure to acknowledge the
"how" demonstrates the lack of Stanford
and internal ASSU experience.

Monica Henestroza/Nick Rodriguez

PROS: Monica Henestroza and Nick Ro
driguez represent a well-balanced execu
tive slate primed with both internal ASSU
and outside experience. Their priorities
are well grounded in areas such as cost of
living and leadership training, they repre
sent areas that affect all students. Further
more, their platform consists of both focus
and innovative yet concrete goals.
We have been told by our predecessors
that you can determine how a candidate
would function in office based on how they
run their election campaign. What is most
attractive about this slate is their ability to
bring in students from all walks of campus
life behind a common vision.
CONS: Although they have notable ASSU
experience, they may need to take a step
back to examine ASSU internal relation
ships and history to best contextualize
their approach to issues and priorities.
Also, if elected, they must follow through
with their platform to dispel myths that
their ASSU would seek to be an interest
group. Finally, their style of leadership is

characterized by decentralization of tasks
and responsibility. They must be sure not
to delegate to the extent that they neglect
the importance of personal and working
relationships with a wide range of Univer
sity functions.
Michael Osofsky/Megan Root

PROS: Michael Osofsky and Megan Root
hold the most internal ASSU experience
of all other slates. They have worked with
in the ASSU to improve funding proce
dures and boost accessibility.
As a result, their ability reflects in their in
formed knowledge about a wide range of
student issues. Also, they have been vocal
with the intent to continue and build upon
current ASSU endeavors (such as Thanks
giving Dinner, Stanford After Midnight).
They also have a keen sense of campus
pulse.
CONS: Osofsky/Root often refer to lots of
issues without shedding insight into their
issue priorities. It is important to consider
many areas of student interest, but more
important to set feasible goals fora small

er group of main concerns. Their past ex
perience is very specific to certain sectors
of campus life and, if elected, would need
to work really hard to substantively en
gage diverse communities into their vi
sion. Also, they will need to think outside
the ASSU box to bring creativity and inno
vation to the office.
In order to address the manifold interests
of a diverse body of students, the executive
branch of the .ASSU must have an uncan
ny ability to work withother students and
engage diverse communities. When a
President or Vice President only repre
sents one pocket of campus interest or one
group of people, then the ASSU fails to
serve its purpose. The ASSU must work
towards the ideal of harboring a vision for
every student by assuring that the ASSU is
a mechanism for voice amplification.
With this said, we hope that our words will
be interpreted by candidates as earnest de
sire to continue the work of the past and
expand foundations for the future of stu
dents at Stanford University.

As the hum of ASSU elections became more
audible, we told ourselves that we would not
endorse any candidate for the ASSU elec
tions. This conclusion was reached with the
desire to both avoid internal division and
maintain open relationships with our succes
sors. However, as we cast our votes to select
our successors, we find it difficult to sit in si
lence without sharing a few thoughts and ob
servations about ASSU representation and
the candidates that seek to further student
voice and condition.
Through conversations, interviews and
long-standing working relationships, we
have become familiarized with each of the
executive slates in varying degrees. As a re
sult, we have narrowed down the pool of
executive candidates to three slates. This
said, we have faith in our ability to work
with whoever is elected.
