# Special-fee Endorsements
## ELECTIONS 2002 
### 
IN AN EFFORT to make informed
special-fee endorsements, mem
bers of The Daily's editorial board
spent numerous horn's during the
past week reviewing budgets and
ASSU Election Handbook statements sub
mitted by student groups requesting
ASSU special fees. The members of the ed
itorial board also met with representatives
of each of the groups to find out about the
group's goals, its accomplishments during
the past year, plans for expansion or im
provement in the coming academic year
and how special-fee funds would be spent.
We evaluated 50 of the 52 groups apply
ing for special fees this year. We did not
evaluate the Stanford News Readership
Program, in which The Daily is a part
ner, or The Daily itself.
Based on the submitted information
and interview discussions, the board
reached an endorsement decision for
each group based on a consensus of the
board. The Daily encourages all students
to check the Election Handbook online
(http://assu.stanford.edu/election) and
read each group's statement and budget
to reach their own conclusions.
We felt overwhelmingly that all the
groups were worthwhile and doing
good things. All the group leaders
worked hard to make their group as
good as it could be. Many of them were
trying to expand the group's offerings
and make them more relevant to the
Stanford student. We support these ef
forts.
At the same time, asking the entire
student body for money is a weighty re
sponsibility. Many students have little or
nothing to do with a certain group, so
the group's activities must be especially
deserving fort hat student to be willing to
fund it. This is true even though the
amount that most groups get from a stu
dent is rather small on a per-term basis.
We evaluated the groups based on
their mission, how well they had achieved
this year's goals, their size, the uses to
which they would put their special-fee
money, the efficiency of their budget,
their willingness to use other sources of
funds and the size of their budget.
The Daily has rated each student
group on a 1 to 3 scale that assesses the
group's effectiveness and value. S t u -
(lent groups requesting a special fee for
the first time were evaluated on their ex
pected effectiveness and value as set forth
in their proposals and presentations.
Below is an explanation of the 1 to 3 rat
ing scale t hat was usee 1 as a composite score

fora group's effectiveness and value.
3 — We support a vote for this group's
special fee. Its utility is important to the
Stanford community and its mission is
particularly worthwhile. It makes good
use of its special-fee revenue, and it is
aware of the fact that it is spending stu
dents' money by running its operation
tightly and liberally using other sources
of funding. Its request is close to or
smaller than last year's. It is generally
easier fora group with a small budget to
earn this rating.
2 — A vote for this group's special fee
deserves consideration. Although the
group has a worthwhile mission and has
achieved its goals over the past year, it
still has some problems. Many times, an
excessive budget or poor use of special
fee funds puts a group in this category.
Generally, the group had as many posi
tive aspects as negative aspects. It some
times has large increases in its budget
over last year.
1 — We have serious reservations about
voting for this group's special fee. Many
of the following criteria apply: Its utility
to most students is limited and its mem
bership is small. Its use of special-fee
funds is poor or its budget is bloated. Its
mission is questionable and it had diffi
culty meeting its goals this year, especial
ly in the case of returning groups. Its
budget is often greatly increased over
last year's, for returning groups.
The individual fee group summaries
below aim to convey the group's accom
plishments during the year and its plans
for the coming year.
Annual cost per student is indicated in
parentheses under the group's gross fee
request amount. The per capita amounts
are taken directly from the ASSU Election
Handbook. A "B" prior to the amount in
dicates the fee will be assessed to both the
undergraduate and graduate students
and a "U" indicates the fee will be assessed
to undergraduates only.

RETURNING GROUPS
ALTERNATIVE $21,700
SPRING BREAK (U $1.09)
1 2 3
Alternative Spring Break is currently the
only organization on campus that offers
community service opportunities over
spring break, which is a valuable service
for the community. The group relies
heavily on ASSU special fees, but oper
ates on a small budget, considering the
number of trips and events it manages.
We endorse its application for special fees
because of its community service orienta
tion and general tightness of budget.
ASIAN $28,334.50
AMERICAN (U $1.42)
STUDENTS
ASSOCIATION
12 3
In a year of upheaval, the Asian American
Students' Association worked to continue
in its mission of providing Stanford stu
dents of Asian descent with a center of
community and serving as a source of
funding for seven subgroups. The group
helps to plan three to four major events
per quarter, notable among which is its
Listen to the Silence Conference dealing
with social and political issues facing
racial minorities. Controversy over the
election of the association's president
marred its image this year, as a Caucasian
student won by default and was forced to
resign in the face of popular opposition.
AASA is to be commended for requesting
a lower fee this year than last, but it could
cut its request even further if its other
subgroups, or the umbrella group itself,
raised funds anywhere near as successful
ly as its Sanskriti subgroup.

ASSU LEGAL $99,285
COUNSELING (B $2.34)
1 2 3
This service is an invaluable insurance pol
icy for all Stanford students, as it provides
free legal counseling to them and their
partners. Although the attorneys do not
represent Stanford students in court, they
dispense advice in all types of cases. Al
though many of us may never be in an
auto accident or may never have a dispute
with a landlord, it is comforting to know
that free legal advice is available in case we
do. It is especially valuable given that an at
torney is on call seven days a week and
available for consultation two afternoons
per week. This service is especially impor
tant for graduate students, who use it
more often than undergraduates do. The
group's request is unavoidably high be
cause of the expensive professional ser
vices and the office coordinator it must
hire. Most of its costs are these labor fees.
ASSU ONLINE $11,000
COURSE GUIDE (U $0.55)
1 2 3
The ASSU Online Course Guide could be
an invaluable tool for students shopping
courses at the beginning of each quarter
and for faculty looking to assess the effec
tiveness of their teaching. It purports to
function as a vehicle for student involve
ment in the evaluation process of teach
ing at Stanford, providing student com
ments and ratings on a wide variety of
courses and professors. Yet while the
concept is exciting, the execution is sub
par. The site has been plagued by a Lack
of consistent updating, and its unreliabil
ity makes it as much a source of frustra
tion for students as it is a source of valu
able information. The amount of the
group's request is reasonable; it simply
needs to do a better job of fulfilling its

promise. A vote for the Online Course
Guide's special fee would be a vote of con
fidence in its ability to improve its service
in the coming year, since in its current
form it is not worth the money.
ASSU SPEAKERS $137,525
BUREAU (B $3.23)
1 2 3
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a student
run organization that brings prominent,
high-profile speakers to campus. Because
of its limited funds, the Speakers Bureau
cannot always bring the most famous
speakers to campus, like Bill Clinton, who
asked for hundreds of thousands of dollars
to speak. However, the Speakers Bureau
should continue to seek student input as it
attempts to bring a wide variety of speakers
to reflect the diverse interests of the student
body. The budget primarily reflects the
amount of honoraria needed to give the
speakers.
BARRIO $24,579.46
ASSISTANCE (U51.17)
1 2 3
One of Stanford's most venerable commu
nity-service groups. Barrio Assistance con
tinues to give Stanford students an oppor
tunity to work as one-on-one mentors with
local Latino and Latina children for an en
tire year. The group serves not only the
youth who receive the mentoring and tu
toring, but also the students who partici
pate. Many use the program to continue
their tutoring experiences while some use
it to jumpstart teaching careers. The
group's special-fee request has increased
as a result of rising rental prices, but the
group's officers do everything they can to
mitigate this effect and keep costs as low as
feasible. For this reason. The Daily be
lieves the group deserves the full amount
of its special-fee request.
