"I thought it made many of us realize now how cheap
life is."
According to photojournalist Kevin McKiernan,
Sept. 11 taught Americans the tragic lesson that Kurds
living in Iraq had the unfortunate experience of learn
ing long before. Last night, in a talk titled "Bringing
the War on Terror to Iraq," McKiernan discussed the
recent experiences of the Kurds, the United States'
probable allies in a war against Iraq, over the last quar
ter century.
Much of McKiernan's recent work involves the
Kurds, including the 2000 documentary "Good Kurds,
Bad Kurds," which was nominated fora Pulitzer Prize.
McKiernan spent 10 years researching the movie, much
of it in Turkey and Iraq.
McKiernan's talk focused on the atrocities commit
ted by the Iraqi government against Kurdish villagers.
There are 20 to 25 million Kurds in the Middle East.
They make up a sizeable portion of the population in
Iraq, Syria, Turkey and Iran, including 20 percent of
Turkey's population and 25 percent of Iraq's popula
tion. During the 1991 Gulf War, 2,000 Kurds died each
day from preventable diseases like typhoid and dysen
tery. Between 1988 and 1996, 3,000 to 3,500 Kurdish
villages were destroyed in northern Iraq. Another 4,000
villages were destroyed by the Turkish government in
Kurdish areas of Turkey.
Said McKiernan of the decimation of Kurdish lands
during the 1991 Gulf War, "In my time as a journalist,
there's no place that I've gone that I've seen such mis
ery." The statement spoke volumes, given that McKier

nan lias also covered the Contra war in Nicaragua, the
fall of the Marcos regime in the Philippines, and the
counter-insurgency war in Guatemala.

While McKiernan noted that the Kurds love the
Americans, he said they would only be willing to fight
for America on two conditions. First, the Kurds would
need to know that the United States was serious - the
Kurds have grown wary due to previous American bro
ken promises.
When the American government aborted a covert
insurrection attempt in 1975, 200,000 Kurds were
forced to flee Iraq and 20.000 were killed. Second, the
Kurds want security and a role in a newly formed Iraqi

government.
McKiernan showed several star
tling pictures including children
with missing limbs, the remnants of
a school which was hit by a tank, and
many forlorn fathers showing pic
tures of their dead children.
McKiernan feared that declaring

a war against Iraq might be hasty
and largely the result of post-Tal
iban war euphoria. But he warned
that declaring an unprovoked war
against Iraq would be a risky propo
sition because of the lack of world
wide support for such a war and the
strength of the Iraqi army.
