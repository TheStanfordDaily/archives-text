# Business frat prepares for Rush
## 
### VESSELA STOYANOVA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Imagine getting tips from your buddies on what to
say and wear to a job interview over a few slices of
pizza. Or calling up your friends at 2 a.m. to ask them
for advice with your resume.
This relaxed and friendly atmosphere combined
with learning professional skills in business is just
what Alpha Kappa Psi, Stanford's only co-ed business
fraternity, has to offer to its members.
The Pi Tau Chapter of the national organization
was founded at Stanford in 1999. Since then, it has fo
cused on providing a wide array of opportunities for
its members. Its professional program includes activ
ities such as resume workshops, case studies, mock in
terviews, speakers on business and educational sub
jects, field and industrial trips and films on business
and educational subjects. Students can attend speak
er panels on job interviews tips about obtaining in

ternships, as well as take advantage of an ever-ex
panding alumni network in seeking advice within
their field of interest.
Although t he members share a common interest in
business, non-economics majors need not be discour
aged. Open to students of all disciplines, AKPsi has at
tracted a diverse membership with a wide array of
academic backgrounds. 111 addition to the more com
mon economics and management science & engi
neering students, common majors range from elec
trical engineering to human biology .
"Stanford doesn't have a business major, so AKPsi
is a good way to meet a lot of people in that field and
find out more about what they're involved with," said
junior and fraternity president Nordia Morris, an
aeronautical engineering major.
AKPsi is a good testing ground for students who
are curious about business possibilities but uncertain
about their career plans.
"As a freshman, you don't nec
essarily know whether you want to
go into business, so this is a way to
get exposed to its different aspects
and to find out earlier what work
ing in certain industries would be
like," said junior Irisa Liu, an elec
trical engineering major.
Recently, the chapter has aimed
its efforts at increasing the diversi
ty of career focuses.
"We're trying to expand and in
clude not just i-banking and con
sulting but also retail, advertising
and marketing," Morris said.
In addition to its professional
skills development aspect, AKPsi
offers numerous research and
service opportunities. Under
faculty supervision, members
can embark on a variety of re
search projects.
"We also do service events,
such as Night Outreach, Soup
Kitchen and Habitat for Humani
ty," Liu said.
What distinguishes AKPsi from
other business-oriented campus
organizations such as the Business
Association of Stanford Engineer
ing Students or the Pre-Business
Society is its alumni network and
the social aspect that stems from its
fraternal status. The organization
has a national governing body and
a large base of alumni contacts in
various career sectors.
"If you want an internship or to

find out more about i-banking,
you can call up one of the alumni,"
Liu said.
According to Morris, AKPsi
provides a different, more social
angle of the business experience.
Its members are equally comfort
able wearing suits during mock in
terview sessions and enjoying pic
nics and dances together.
"We have a strong brother
hood, a strong group of friends in
addition to the acquiring business
knowledge and skills aspect," Liu
said. "We have bi-yearly retreats,
bonding activities such as going to
movies and concerts together,
Miyake's nights, barbeques and
other low-key stuff."
AKPsi is a business fraternity,
which means that its members can
simultaneously join social fraterni
ties and sororities.
"Since [AKPsi's Stanford chap
ter] is fairly new, there's a lot of op
portunity for leadership posi
tions," Morris said.
The fraternity is currently
conducting its annual recruit
ment campaign.
"Rush is basically a time for stu
dents to discover AKPsi — our cul
ture, our members, and our expe
rience," said Rush chair Eileen
Chao, a junior. "If [rushees] are
able to convince us that they want
to become an integral part of the
group and have a genuine interest
in business, then they should have
no problem getting in. We are a se
lective organization, but also feel
that the process is self-selective."
Candidates for membership are

required to submit a resume. The
second step is receiving an inter
view invitation. According to Mor
ris, the process is designed so that
applicants can get some exposure
to these basic professional skills.
"You don't need to have that
much experience — we're here to
teach you," she said. "Fora lot of
people, it's their first interview. It's
also good for the members, be
cause we learn about interviews
from the other side."
The pledge process for those
who are invited to join resembles
its social fraternity counterpart in
that it is designed to forge friend
ship bonds among the newly ac
cepted members. However, it does
not include any of the hazing prac
tices traditionally associated with
social fraternity pledging.
"The pledge class has to com
plete specific business projects,"
Liu said. "Going through it, I
made really good friends and we
became very close."
Freshman Adam Freund, who
is rushing AKPsi, hopes to obtain
valuable experience with inter
views, such as how to dress, talk
and act.
"Just the very act of getting into
the fraternity is like applying to a
business, and then once you're in,
you learn how to run a business.
It's kind of like a microcosm of the
corporate world, which is one of
the best ways to learn," he said.
