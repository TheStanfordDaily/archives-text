## Panel to look at sustainable coffee and its benefits to the environment 
### ALBERT LEUNG 
Are you looking fora chance to sip a hot

cup of free coffee? Sustain
able coffee will be available
today at a conference spon
sored by the Center for
Latin American Studies.
The event aims to discuss
the potential of alternative
types of coffee that may
have an impact on coffee
markets in Latin America.
The conference, "Brewing
Change: Sustainable Coffee
in Latin America," will be
held in the Bolivar House,
located at 582 Alvarado

Row from 11 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and is free
of charge.,
"Coffee is a daily product that directly

impacts people's lives and the economies
of several countries," said Amy Upgren,
the center's events coordinator "That's
what makes coffee products so interesting.
It is an important issue for Latin America
right now."
In particular, sustainable coffee includes,
shade-grown (coffee grown in a way that is
environmentally friendly) and organic cof-

fee. These categories are
still deemed as specially cof
fees, which comprise a
niche market that is still less
than 10 percent of today's
coffee market.
"Sustainable coffee, espe
cially shade-grown coffee,
has also been shown to im
prove the habitats for
avian species and is con
sidered an environmental
ly-friendly product," Up
gren said.
The conference will lea-

ture opening remarks by Human Biology

Prof. William Durham, and host
several keynote individuals who
play prominent roles in the cof
fee market.
Among the first panel of ex
perts that will lead the discussion
are Jaime Azcarate, former head
of the Colombian Coffee Federa
tion's Social and Environmental
Projects; Jim Reynolds, Coffee
Buyer and Roastmaster for
Peet's Coffee and Tea; and
Christopher Bacon, a doctoral
candidate in agroecology from
UC-Santa Cruz.
The second panel will include
talks by Sue Mecklenberg, Star
bucks' director of Environmen
tal and Community Affairs and
Kimberly Easson, the marketing
director for TransFair USA, a
non-profit fair-trade certifica
tion organization.
They will be prepared to dis
cuss the prospects of sustainable

coffee on Latin America's
economies as well as people's
everyday lives.
Coffee's powerful impact on
Latin American countries sparked
Durham's interest.
" I n the past, coffee had a strong
negative influence on Latin Amer
ica's environment," Durham said,
"But with new shade-grown vari
eties, there's a new positive aspect
because of its environmentally
friendly nature."
Students, faculty, and staff are
all encouraged to attend the con
ference in order to explore the op
portunities and obstacles facing
the sustainable coffee market at
both production, roaster and re
tailer levels.
Experts will examine the eco
nomic impact of sustainable coffee
on Latin American farmers and
discuss how the product will fare
in the years to come. Since sustain
able coffee garners a higher pur
chase price than regular coffee,
(hey will also evaluate the econom
ic viability of sustainable coffee in
the U.S. market.
