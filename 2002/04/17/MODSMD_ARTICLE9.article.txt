Homes near SJC to receive
soundproofing
SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) —Residents of a low-income
neighborhood finally may get a break from the noisy planes
at nearby San Jose International Airport.
The San Jose City Council is expected to approve
Tuesday a plan to spend roughly $125 million to insulate
more than 2,000 homes in a neighborhood where resi
dents consistently complain of disrupted conversations
and lost sleep.
The plan is being hailed by some as a long-needed step
toward improving airport relations with nearby residents.
But other neighbors say the plan doesn't go far enough.
Not all homes will be eligible for sound proofing. Feder
al funding to insulate homes is typically authorized only
when the average noise level inside exceeds 65 decibels.
Noise experts say conversations inside homes with the win
dows partly open are disrupted when exterior noise levels
exceed 75 decibels.
The money would come from a $4.50 assessment on San
Jose airport tic kets, as well as federal appropriations. The
project, which will need to be approved by the Federal Avi
ation Administration, is expected to take about nine years.

Oceanographers to place
sensors in Pacific Ocean
NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) — Scientists are
preparing to install ocean sensors beneath the Newport Pier
and six other locations along the California coast to study
changes connected to El Nino, global warming and urban
runoff.
Fhe automated network, stretching from La Jolla to
Bodega Bay, would provide minute-to-minute readings of
ocean temperature, salinity, turbulence, sea level and
chlorophyll fluorescence, which is an indirect measure of
phytoplankton, the base of most marine food chains.
"We have evidence that humans are changing the coastal
ocean, but we don't have adequate information to say how
much of an impact we're having," said John Largier, a re
searcher at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in La
Jolla.
The sensors would use wireless technology to relay the
data to a server in La Jolla, where it would be posted on the
Internet for the benefit of scientists and the public.
