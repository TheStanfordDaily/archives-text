# CANNONBALL COMING
## What it costs to win the race 
### 
By Friday, the mass of posters will
be gone from White Plaza. We'll
have a new President, a new
group of Pub-Night organizers
and a new slate of self-important Senators.
And a whole bunch of people will be a
few thousand dollars poorer.
Until two years ago, ASSU campaigns
were conducted under strict spending
limits and with specific regulations on
the type and nature of campaign activity.
For example, candidates running for
ASSU President could spend only $5OO
on their campaign.
But after' a host of violations and accu
sations in the 2000 presidential campaign,
the ASSU Took a look at its constitution
and decided that imposing limits on ex
penditure and activity actually violated

that document, which
says that "the Association
shall enact no legislation
abridging the freedom of
speech, or of the press."
Following the
Supreme Court's land
mark ruling on cam
paign spending, Buck
ley v. Valeo, cited in ar

guments advanced by Sen. Mitch Mc-
Connell and Law School Dean Kathleen
Sullivan in their ongoing legal challenge
to the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act,
the ASSU equated campaign spending
with speech. Basically, posters cost
money.
So, the ASSU abolished any restrictions
and allowed the scope of campaigns to be
regulated by people's willingness to fund,
and to bear, an onslaught of paper and
posters. Then, after last year, when blimps
buzzed overhead, campaign t-shirts prolif
erated across campus and campaign bud
gets ballooned into the thousands, the
ASSU required all candidates to file ex
penditure reports.
From this, we know that Michael Osof
sky and Megan Root submitted receipts to
taling $1,985.00, Josh Benson and Kendra
Arimoto, $1,582.50, and Monica Hene
stroza and Nick Rodriguez, $1,244.48.
Considering that these totals only repre
sent what the campaign slates voluntarily
reported and, furthermore, do not repre
sent the true cost of services, such as print
ing and copying, received for free or re
duced price, the true value of the cam
paigns is probably far higher.
Regardless, considering that the ASSU
put forward a suggested spending limit of
$350, under which "the Elections Com
mission believes a candidate for any office
is able to run a highly effective and success
ful campaign," it seems like campaign bud
gets have gotten a little out of proportion.
Pretty much everyone agrees, including
the people paying for the campaigns
which, when it comes to ASSU elections,
are usually the candidates themselves.
In most national races, with notable ex
ceptions, candidates rely mosdy on the
largess of a stable of self-interested rich

people, unions and corporations to fill
their campaign war chests.
But at Stanford, who's going to shell out
money to help someone get elected? Not
me. If our best friend were running, most
of us would give them time, energy and
best wishes. But not money.
So who ends up footing the bill here?
According to candidates in the past two
ASSU elections, some money comes from
family friends and home-town "contribu
tors" who have money to burn. Some
comes from parents. But, for most, it
comes from their own pockets. Sure, most
of those pockets are lined with daddy's
money, but not always.
One slate included two students on
"tens of thousands of dollars of financial
aid," including one financially indepen
dent student paying for college without
parental aid.
How'd they manage to pay for their
campaign? Purportedly by draining one
candidate's long-time college fund for a
cool grand. This student will have to re
structure how to pay the tuition bills in the
next few years, win or lose.
But even for those who had ample re
sources, $2,000 isn't chump change. To
enter the race for ASSU president, then,
you have to make a major financial com
mitment.
"Funding the campaign was our biggest
challenge," said Josh Benson.
"Coming into the campaign, I had no
idea of the magnitude," said Michael Osof
sky. "The campaign was pricey."
That's an understatement. Glossy, pro
fessional-looking posters cost anywhere
from $650 to $BOO. Benson/Arimoto's
pretty banners cost another $3OO. Osof
sky/Root's 80 t-shirts cost over $650.
Not everyone thought it would get
this expensive. Last year, in the first cam
paign after the repeal of spending limits,
Brent Barton planned on outspending
the other candidates.
"My plan originally was to blow every
one else out of the water. I was expecting to
outspend everyone 2-to-l," he said.
Instead, Barton and his partner Larry
Estrada might not have outspent anyone.
Though no candidates were required to
report their budgets from last year and
knowledgeable estimates vary consider
ably, each of the three strong slates in last
year's campaign probably spent between
$3,000 and $4,500.
"I was stunned to see others outspend
ing me," Barton said.
While Matt Brewer, the current pres
ident of the ASSU, claims spending was
lower, between $2,000 and $3,500, he is
still disheartened by the trend in cam
paign spending.
"I think day-by-day, the degree to
which people spend is accelerating into
something that could really discredit the
integrity of the organization if this remains
unchecked," Brewer said.

So, while Washington went one way, by
signing a bill that severely restricts contri
butions to political parties and the nature
of issue advocacy in the months preceding
an election, Stanford went the other, open
ing campaigns up to the biggest spenders.

Both have seen backlash. A host of legal
talent is lining up against campaign reform
in D.C. claiming, legitimately in my mind,
that the recendy passed legislation goes
way too far in restricting political discourse
and limiting free speech.
At Stanford, meanwhile, at least two of
three slates plan on implementing some
type of campaign reform if elected.
They're seen campaigns without limits
and, as students often encumbered by

strict financial limits, they don't like what
they see. So, even if spending limits don't
return, something will change.
If not, all the budding, ambitious,
power-starved underclassmen should take
note and start saving. Earning the right to
revamp the Corner Pocket is expensive
business.

paign spending.
"I think day-by-day, the degree to
which people spend is accelerating into
something that could really discredit the
integrity of the organization if this remains
unchecked," Brewer said.

So, while Washington went one way, by
signing a bill that severely restricts contri
butions to political parties and the nature
of issue advocacy in the months preceding
an election, Stanford went the other, open
ing campaigns up to the biggest spenders.

Both have seen backlash. A host of legal
talent is lining up against campaign reform
in D.C. claiming, legitimately in my mind,
that the recendy passed legislation goes
way too far in restricting political discourse
and limiting free speech.
At Stanford, meanwhile, at least two of
three slates plan on implementing some
type of campaign reform if elected.
They're seen campaigns without limits
and, as students often encumbered by

strict financial limits, they don't like what
they see. So, even if spending limits don't
return, something will change.
If not, all the budding, ambitious,
power-starved underclassmen should take
note and start saving. Earning the right to
revamp the Corner Pocket is expensive
business.

By Friday, the mass of posters will
be gone from White Plaza. We'll
have a new President, a new
group of Pub-Night organizers
and a new slate of self-important Senators.
And a whole bunch of people will be a
few thousand dollars poorer.
Until two years ago, ASSU campaigns
were conducted under strict spending
limits and with specific regulations on
the type and nature of campaign activity.
For example, candidates running for
ASSU President could spend only $5OO
on their campaign.
But after' a host of violations and accu
sations in the 2000 presidential campaign,
the ASSU Took a look at its constitution
and decided that imposing limits on ex
penditure and activity actually violated

that document, which
says that "the Association
shall enact no legislation
abridging the freedom of
speech, or of the press."
Following the
Supreme Court's land
mark ruling on cam
paign spending, Buck
ley v. Valeo, cited in ar

guments advanced by Sen. Mitch Mc-
Connell and Law School Dean Kathleen
Sullivan in their ongoing legal challenge
to the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act,
the ASSU equated campaign spending
with speech. Basically, posters cost
money.
So, the ASSU abolished any restrictions
and allowed the scope of campaigns to be
regulated by people's willingness to fund,
and to bear, an onslaught of paper and
posters. Then, after last year, when blimps
buzzed overhead, campaign t-shirts prolif
erated across campus and campaign bud
gets ballooned into the thousands, the
ASSU required all candidates to file ex
penditure reports.
From this, we know that Michael Osof
sky and Megan Root submitted receipts to
taling $1,985.00, Josh Benson and Kendra
Arimoto, $1,582.50, and Monica Hene
stroza and Nick Rodriguez, $1,244.48.
Considering that these totals only repre
sent what the campaign slates voluntarily
reported and, furthermore, do not repre
sent the true cost of services, such as print
ing and copying, received for free or re
duced price, the true value of the cam
paigns is probably far higher.
Regardless, considering that the ASSU
put forward a suggested spending limit of
$350, under which "the Elections Com
mission believes a candidate for any office
is able to run a highly effective and success
ful campaign," it seems like campaign bud
gets have gotten a little out of proportion.
Pretty much everyone agrees, including
the people paying for the campaigns
which, when it comes to ASSU elections,
are usually the candidates themselves.
In most national races, with notable ex
ceptions, candidates rely mosdy on the
largess of a stable of self-interested rich

people, unions and corporations to fill
their campaign war chests.
But at Stanford, who's going to shell out
money to help someone get elected? Not
me. If our best friend were running, most
of us would give them time, energy and
best wishes. But not money.
So who ends up footing the bill here?
According to candidates in the past two
ASSU elections, some money comes from
family friends and home-town "contribu
tors" who have money to burn. Some
comes from parents. But, for most, it
comes from their own pockets. Sure, most
of those pockets are lined with daddy's
money, but not always.
One slate included two students on
"tens of thousands of dollars of financial
aid," including one financially indepen
dent student paying for college without
parental aid.
How'd they manage to pay for their
campaign? Purportedly by draining one
candidate's long-time college fund for a
cool grand. This student will have to re
structure how to pay the tuition bills in the
next few years, win or lose.
But even for those who had ample re
sources, $2,000 isn't chump change. To
enter the race for ASSU president, then,
you have to make a major financial com
mitment.
"Funding the campaign was our biggest
challenge," said Josh Benson.
"Coming into the campaign, I had no
idea of the magnitude," said Michael Osof
sky. "The campaign was pricey."
That's an understatement. Glossy, pro
fessional-looking posters cost anywhere
from $650 to $BOO. Benson/Arimoto's
pretty banners cost another $3OO. Osof
sky/Root's 80 t-shirts cost over $650.
Not everyone thought it would get
this expensive. Last year, in the first cam
paign after the repeal of spending limits,
Brent Barton planned on outspending
the other candidates.
"My plan originally was to blow every
one else out of the water. I was expecting to
outspend everyone 2-to-l," he said.
Instead, Barton and his partner Larry
Estrada might not have outspent anyone.
Though no candidates were required to
report their budgets from last year and
knowledgeable estimates vary consider
ably, each of the three strong slates in last
year's campaign probably spent between
$3,000 and $4,500.
"I was stunned to see others outspend
ing me," Barton said.
While Matt Brewer, the current pres
ident of the ASSU, claims spending was
lower, between $2,000 and $3,500, he is
still disheartened by the trend in cam
paign spending.
"I think day-by-day, the degree to
which people spend is accelerating into
something that could really discredit the
