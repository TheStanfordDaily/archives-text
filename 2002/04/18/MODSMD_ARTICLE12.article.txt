Chair of ASSU Undergraduate Senate
disgusted by 'ignorant 7 behavior
I am writing this letter almost 12
hours before the elections results are to
be announced. Irrespective of who
wins, I would like to make the following
very well known: despite popular
opinion to the contrary, Stanford ad
mits students who, though they per
haps appear smarter on paper, are
nonetheless just as stupid and lack just
as much common sense as students at
other Universities. Not to worry. I
count myself among the stupid people
as well. Most of what is written below
applies to me just as much.
Though the Daily has called this elec
tion one of the most competitive in years,
this past week has been the most atrocious
display of student ignorance I have seen in
four years.
The smear campaigns, the attacks on
character and the attacks on the ASSU
would all be fine, if the people speaking
had any knowledge of the persons and or
ganizations they criticize.
However, it seems the entire campus
decided to do the popular thing, which
has been to blindly repeat accusations
and unquestioningly point finger at slates
and institutions they know nothing
about. How many people that bash
Michael Osofsky on a personal level actu
ally know him or have had an encounter
with him? How many have truly, person
ally been slighted, hurt or made uncom
fortable by his behavior? Well, it seems
the entire campus has.
If that's the case, and Osofsky actually
has victimized the hundreds or even
thousands of people who accuse him of
personal injustice, perhaps the adminis

trations ought to step in and expel him.
After all, he is becoming a menace to this
campus and obviously endangers the
personal welfare of many students on
this campus.
How many people have attended an
ASSU Senate meeting, have stepped into
the executives' office hours or have con
tacted any of the ASSU student officers
to voice opposition, concert and even
doubt of the performance, efficiency or
even necessity of the ASSU? If you have
not, and are complaining about how lit
tle the ASSU does for you, you are igho
rant. Ignorant not because the ASSU
necessarily is doing something for you,
but because you have not taken an hour
of your life to make your complaint an
informed one.
Therefore, it is not surprising to me
that attacks on all the slates have been
uninformed as well. People that pigeon
holed Monica . Henestroza / Nick Ro
driguez as "too activist," "too minority
oriented" have missed their work with
VSOs (do you even know what this term
means?) and student space. Those who
point at Josh Benson / Kendra Arimoto
as having no ASSU experience do not
know that Josh began attending Senate
meetings long before most of the candi
dates even thought about this year's
elections.
So stop yelling about how much you
hate Osofsky or how little the Senate mat
ters. Meet him. Attend a Senate meeting.
And if you still feel the same way, then
wholeheartedly dedicate your days to stop
ping either or both from rising to power.
Until then, you are simply ignorant.

Performing arts groups disappointed
by special fee endorsements
Upon reading the Special Fee en
dorsements in Tuesday's Daily, we were
extremely disappointed to learn that sev
eral musical performing arts groups
Chamber Chorale, Symphony Orches
tra, and Taiko had received the low
est possible rating.
We believe that these ratings showed a
lack of careful consideration of the
groups' contributions on the part of the
Daily, as well as a possibly unintentional,
but nonetheless reproachable, stance
against support for the performing
music groups at Stanford.
The Daily's main complaint with our
groups seemed to be the projected use of
Special Fee money for tours; the editori
al board also argued that we should seek
other avenues of funding.
To address the first point, all of our
groups also intend to use Special Fee
money for other expenditures such as
general operating expenses; without
such funding, we would not be able to
function effectively.
As for the latter point, the fact is that a
tour is an immense undertaking for
which, in the case of the Symphony, the
costs can rise into hundreds of thousands
of dollars, and funding from Special Fees
is by no means sufficient. During the in
terviews, we made sure to stress that we
have all been doing extensive fundrais
ing including Stanford Fund letters,
member dues, private donations, and
benefit concerts.
The Daily also contended that such
tours would only benefit the performing
groups' members. This is far from true;
in an international tour, we represent
Stanford musically and culturally, help
ing to promote the University as an elite
educational institution and an advocate
of the arts. In turn, this favorable public
ity aids in attracting potential faculty and
students and maintaining the high qual
ity of musical life on campus, thus bene
fiting the entire student population.
The Daily's decision to give low rat
ings to these musical performing arts
groups goes beyond a disapproval of
special fee funding and, unfortunately,
helps to further a lack of support for the
arts that significantly benefit the Stan
ford community.
Chamber Chorale, Symphony Or
chestra, and Taiko each make unique
contributions to enrich Stanford culture
and regularly share their talents with the
student body in concert. In a school
renowned for the sciences, support of
performing arts groups is vital to pro
mote intellectual and artistic diversity.

Daily does not recognize
contributions of cultural groups

In spite of glaring mistakes and poor
reporting during the year to date, the
Asian American Students' Association
has never been offended by The Daily as
much as it has been from your review of
our special fees application.
First, you continue to be fixated on the
former chair who was a "Caucasian stu
dent." That sort of obsession is completely
ignorant of the events of this past year. His
resignation occurred in early October,
only weeks into fall quarter. Since then,
we've had almost 10 events of our own,
and the student groups under our um
brella have added countless more.
Although such controversy made
headlines at the beginning of the year,

you've chosen to neglect most of our
work since then.
The general sentiment in the Stan
ford community, even among Andrew
Mac Donald and his friends is that the
issue is no longer relevant. Not only has
the community moved on, but those out
side the community have also moved on.
Second, The Daily's examination of
our funding contradicts itself and shows
further ignorance of funding for Special
Fees umbrella groups such as AASA. The
review praises our group for reducing its
requested fee, yet at the same time, it
blasts us for not trying to reduce it more.
The review further expects AASA to
have "raised funds ... as successfully as
its Sanskriti subgroup."
Special fees groups are severely re
stricted and discouraged from raising
separate funding. AASA already extracts
nearly the maximum from The Stanford
Fund. Moreover, our groups already
take full advantage of raising money at
co-sponsored events, such as AASA Ex
travaganza and TCS Night Market.
The very point of our special fees is to
provide these groups the funds to main
tain their own operations. Our eight
groups should not devote their efforts
and intelligence to fundraising. They
should serve the community.
Third, the lack of attention to detail in
this review is troubling. AASA does not
have a "president" in its leadership
structure but many different chairs. This
is not a trivial point. It is based on the
goal of creating a less hierarchical lead
ership structure.
Additionally, the Listen to the Silence
Conference should be billed as an Asian
American issues conference.
Finally, it should be noted that AASA,
BSU, MEChA, and SAIO were all rated 2
with respect to their Special Fees appli
cations. This is not a coincidence but an
indicator of the Daily's ignorance to
wards the communities of color's issues.
Although you are dedicated to giving
exclusive groups or groups with far
more exorbitant requests higher ratings,
you have neither the generosity nor the
understanding of community causes to
appreciate our groups' requests.

Special fees groups are severely re
stricted and discouraged from raising
separate funding. AASA already extracts
nearly the maximum from The Stanford
Fund. Moreover, our groups already
take full advantage of raising money at
co-sponsored events, such as AASA Ex
travaganza and TCS Night Market.
The very point of our special fees is to
provide these groups the funds to main
tain their own operations. Our eight
groups should not devote their efforts
and intelligence to fundraising. They
should serve the community.
Third, the lack of attention to detail in
this review is troubling. AASA does not
have a "president" in its leadership
structure but many different chairs. This
is not a trivial point. It is based on the
goal of creating a less hierarchical lead

Additionally, the Listen to the Silence
Conference should be billed as an Asian
American issues conference.
Finally, it should be noted that AASA,
BSU, MEChA, and SAIO were all rated 2
with respect to their Special Fees appli

indicator of the Daily's ignorance to

Although you are dedicated to giving

more exorbitant requests higher ratings,
you have neither the generosity nor the
understanding of community causes to
appreciate our groups' requests.

disgusted by 'ignorant 7 behavior
I am writing this letter almost 12
hours before the elections results are to
be announced. Irrespective of who
wins, I would like to make the following
very well known: despite popular
opinion to the contrary, Stanford ad
mits students who, though they per
haps appear smarter on paper, are
nonetheless just as stupid and lack just
as much common sense as students at
other Universities. Not to worry. I
count myself among the stupid people
as well. Most of what is written below
applies to me just as much.
Though the Daily has called this elec
tion one of the most competitive in years,
this past week has been the most atrocious
display of student ignorance I have seen in
four years.
The smear campaigns, the attacks on
character and the attacks on the ASSU
would all be fine, if the people speaking
had any knowledge of the persons and or
ganizations they criticize.
However, it seems the entire campus
decided to do the popular thing, which
has been to blindly repeat accusations
and unquestioningly point finger at slates
and institutions they know nothing
about. How many people that bash
Michael Osofsky on a personal level actu
ally know him or have had an encounter
with him? How many have truly, person
ally been slighted, hurt or made uncom
fortable by his behavior? Well, it seems
the entire campus has.
If that's the case, and Osofsky actually
has victimized the hundreds or even
thousands of people who accuse him of
personal injustice, perhaps the adminis

trations ought to step in and expel him.
After all, he is becoming a menace to this
campus and obviously endangers the
personal welfare of many students on
this campus.
How many people have attended an
ASSU Senate meeting, have stepped into
the executives' office hours or have con
tacted any of the ASSU student officers
to voice opposition, concert and even
doubt of the performance, efficiency or
even necessity of the ASSU? If you have
not, and are complaining about how lit
tle the ASSU does for you, you are igho
rant. Ignorant not because the ASSU
necessarily is doing something for you,
but because you have not taken an hour
of your life to make your complaint an
informed one.
Therefore, it is not surprising to me
that attacks on all the slates have been
uninformed as well. People that pigeon
holed Monica . Henestroza / Nick Ro
driguez as "too activist," "too minority
oriented" have missed their work with
VSOs (do you even know what this term
means?) and student space. Those who
point at Josh Benson / Kendra Arimoto
as having no ASSU experience do not
know that Josh began attending Senate
meetings long before most of the candi
dates even thought about this year's
elections.
So stop yelling about how much you
hate Osofsky or how little the Senate mat
ters. Meet him. Attend a Senate meeting.
And if you still feel the same way, then
wholeheartedly dedicate your days to stop
ping either or both from rising to power.
Until then, you are simply ignorant.

Performing arts groups disappointed
by special fee endorsements
Upon reading the Special Fee en
dorsements in Tuesday's Daily, we were
extremely disappointed to learn that sev
eral musical performing arts groups
Chamber Chorale, Symphony Orches
tra, and Taiko had received the low
est possible rating.
We believe that these ratings showed a
lack of careful consideration of the
groups' contributions on the part of the
Daily, as well as a possibly unintentional,
but nonetheless reproachable, stance
against support for the performing
music groups at Stanford.
The Daily's main complaint with our
groups seemed to be the projected use of
Special Fee money for tours; the editori
al board also argued that we should seek
other avenues of funding.
To address the first point, all of our
groups also intend to use Special Fee
money for other expenditures such as
general operating expenses; without
such funding, we would not be able to
function effectively.
As for the latter point, the fact is that a
tour is an immense undertaking for
which, in the case of the Symphony, the
costs can rise into hundreds of thousands
of dollars, and funding from Special Fees
is by no means sufficient. During the in
terviews, we made sure to stress that we
have all been doing extensive fundrais
ing including Stanford Fund letters,
member dues, private donations, and
benefit concerts.
The Daily also contended that such
tours would only benefit the performing
groups' members. This is far from true;
in an international tour, we represent
Stanford musically and culturally, help
ing to promote the University as an elite
educational institution and an advocate
of the arts. In turn, this favorable public
ity aids in attracting potential faculty and
students and maintaining the high qual
ity of musical life on campus, thus bene
fiting the entire student population.
The Daily's decision to give low rat
ings to these musical performing arts
groups goes beyond a disapproval of
special fee funding and, unfortunately,
helps to further a lack of support for the
arts that significantly benefit the Stan
ford community.
Chamber Chorale, Symphony Or
chestra, and Taiko each make unique
contributions to enrich Stanford culture
and regularly share their talents with the
student body in concert. In a school
renowned for the sciences, support of
performing arts groups is vital to pro
mote intellectual and artistic diversity.

Daily does not recognize
contributions of cultural groups

In spite of glaring mistakes and poor
reporting during the year to date, the
Asian American Students' Association
has never been offended by The Daily as
much as it has been from your review of
our special fees application.
First, you continue to be fixated on the
former chair who was a "Caucasian stu
dent." That sort of obsession is completely
ignorant of the events of this past year. His
resignation occurred in early October,
only weeks into fall quarter. Since then,
we've had almost 10 events of our own,
and the student groups under our um
brella have added countless more.
Although such controversy made
headlines at the beginning of the year,

you've chosen to neglect most of our
work since then.
The general sentiment in the Stan
ford community, even among Andrew
Mac Donald and his friends is that the
issue is no longer relevant. Not only has
the community moved on, but those out
side the community have also moved on.
Second, The Daily's examination of
our funding contradicts itself and shows
further ignorance of funding for Special
Fees umbrella groups such as AASA. The
review praises our group for reducing its
requested fee, yet at the same time, it
blasts us for not trying to reduce it more.
The review further expects AASA to
have "raised funds ... as successfully as
its Sanskriti subgroup."
Special fees groups are severely re
stricted and discouraged from raising
separate funding. AASA already extracts
nearly the maximum from The Stanford
Fund. Moreover, our groups already
take full advantage of raising money at
co-sponsored events, such as AASA Ex
travaganza and TCS Night Market.
