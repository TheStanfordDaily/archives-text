# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Justice and activism at Stanford 
### PATRICK A. SHEA GUEST COLUMNIST 
Recently student activism has had a re
birth at Stanford over the issue of con
tracting janitorial services at the Medical
Center and University labor practices in
general. This column should be consid
ered as a greeting from afar, both in time
(I am from the Class of 1970) and distance
(I live in Salt Lake City distance both in
miles and culture).
The fall of 1966 was when I arrived at the
Farm. Dave Harris had been elected Stu
dent Body President. He was the first stu
dent radical elected to lead the student
body. He and his band of supporters were
veterans of various civil rights protests be
ginning in the mid-1960's when Dean
Dwight Clark and AJ Lowenstein organized
Stanford students to go to Mississippi and
other places in the deep South.
In 1966, Harris told the story of his
freshman convocation at Frost Amphithe
ater. Dean of Students Don Winbigler
said to the assembled freshman, "Turn to
your left, turn to your right, one of the
three people that you are seating with
won't be here next year."
The attitude coming to Stanford in 1966
was one of significant transitions. The war in
Vietnam was going sour, the civil rights
movement was continuing to move under
the leadership of Martin Luther King, Rev.
Coffin and Dean Davie Napier at Stanford.
As freshmen we were encouraged, in and
out of class, to ask questions.
The questions of the day were:
Why were there "boys dorms" and
"girls dorms?"
Why were there lockout hours in the

"girls" dorms?
Why were we taking classes that had
been taught the same way for 30 years,
with little innovation?
The first sit-in at Stanford occurred my
Sophomore year (Spring 1968) at the Stu
dent Union (now Old Union). The protest
was about U.S. policy in Vietnam, and
whether Stanford should allow recruiters
for private corporations, such as Dow
Chemical, on campus. For the first time in
Stanford's history, the faculty voted not to
support the administration.
President Wallace Sterling, Provost Her
bert Packard, and Assoc. Provost Richard
Lyman, were shocked that the faculty would
vote to support a protest effort, initiated by
students. Policies about recruiting were
changed. In the subsequent three years at
Stanford, many things changed: co-educa
tional dormitories came into being; the
Study of Education at Stanford significandy
revised the undergraduate curriculum and
the University began to listen to students'
thoughts, concerns and suggestions. Final
ly, the war in Vietnam became a rallying
point on campus for protest by people chal
lenging national authority and its effort to
dictate U.S. foreign policy.
I developed a set of rules, or a personal
credo, as to what I would or would not do
during periods of protest. I think anyone
wanting to be an activist might well consid
er creating their own credo.
1. You must be responsible for your
own actions.
Covert or unidentified activities, even
for the most just cause, end up being un
just. To be effective, a protest must be
public and the person making the
protest must be accountable.

2. You must think about the larger
picture. One of the questions that I was
encouraged to ask by History prof. Mark
Mancall, my senior thesis advisor, was "is
it just, is it fair, will it result in a positive
and substantive change?"
Don't get sidetracked by notoriety or
short-stage satisfaction. Define the end
you seek and then go for it.
3. You are at Stanford as an honor
and as a privilege.
Jane and Leland may not have anticipat
ed the kind of activist Stanford has pro
duced in the past, and hopefully, will con
tinue to in the future. But on your walk to
your next meal at Wilbur, Stern or Laugni
ta, think of the people who make Stanford
work. The people who serve your meals,
keep the campus clean, and are essential to
Stanford's well-being are of a significandy
different economic class. You need to think
of how your honor and privilege can be
used to connect with or support your fellow
residents of Stanford.
The Stanford Medical Center is one re
cent forum where a conflict of economic in
terests has arisen. The administrator trying
to make his Stanford Hospital budget work
is not the problem.
Admittedly, he will make his decision, but
he is being forced by institutional dictates.
For someone challenging the status quo, you
need to identify the problem, propose the
solutions and work to make it happen.

public and the person making the
protest must be accountable.

2. You must think about the larger
picture. One of the questions that I was
encouraged to ask by History prof. Mark
Mancall, my senior thesis advisor, was "is
it just, is it fair, will it result in a positive
and substantive change?"
Don't get sidetracked by notoriety or
short-stage satisfaction. Define the end
you seek and then go for it.
3. You are at Stanford as an honor
and as a privilege.
Jane and Leland may not have anticipat
ed the kind of activist Stanford has pro
duced in the past, and hopefully, will con
tinue to in the future. But on your walk to
your next meal at Wilbur, Stern or Laugni
ta, think of the people who make Stanford
work. The people who serve your meals,
keep the campus clean, and are essential to
Stanford's well-being are of a significandy
different economic class. You need to think
of how your honor and privilege can be
used to connect with or support your fellow
residents of Stanford.
The Stanford Medical Center is one re
cent forum where a conflict of economic in
terests has arisen. The administrator trying
to make his Stanford Hospital budget work
is not the problem.
Admittedly, he will make his decision, but
he is being forced by institutional dictates.
For someone challenging the status quo, you
need to identify the problem, propose the
solutions and work to make it happen.
