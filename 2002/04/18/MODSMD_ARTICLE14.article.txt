## U.S. misses party for International Court 
### DAVID DAVENPORT HOOVER INSTITUTION 
They threw a party at the United Na
tions recently, but the United States did
not attend. The hoopla, celebrated by 66
nations and hundreds of nongovernmen
tal organizations, marked the birth of the
new International Criminal Court (ICC),
but the United States, by refusing to ratify
the treaty creating the court, sent its re
grets. The establishment of a major world
court without U.S. participation opens a
new and troublesome chapter in interna
tional law and diplomacy.
Only a few years ago, the United
States would have been expected to sup
port the new court. Most of America's
traditional allies, including Great
Britain, Canada, and its European
friends, are key participants. The United
States has been a major supporter of the
temporary international criminal tri
bunals for the former Yugoslavia and
Rwanda (precursors of the permanent
ICC), and was one of the nations helping
to shape the new court.
But a funny thing happened on the
way to the conception of the Interna
tional Criminal Court. A group of "like
minded nations" became highly commit
ted to a court with far more sweeping

powers than ever before seen or envi
sioned, and, in the end, they hijacked the
process, rushing past U.S. concerns. The
Clinton administration was ambivalent,
but the Bush administration has been
steadfastly opposed, and rightly so.
There is plenty not to like about the ICC.
Although the court's primary agenda is war
crimes, crimes against humanity, and geno
cide, it also has jurisdiction over a new, un
defined crime of "aggression." With troops
stationed around the world, the U.S. mili
tary has reason to be concerned.
Instead of cases being referred to the
court by the U.N. Security Council, an
independent prosecutor will make those
highly political decisions. Amazingly, the
ICC purports to have jurisdiction over
citizens of countries that do not partici
pate in the court, an unprecedented ex
pansion of international law.
Why should Americans care? For one
thing, it is highly likely that Americans
will be investigated or charged as crimi
nal defendants. Government officials,
military officers, and soldiers even
corporate executives are all possible
targets. Another concern is that defen
dants cannot rely on the right to a jury
trial, protection against unreasonable
searches, and many other protections af
forded by the U.S. Constitution. With

considerable anti-American sentiment
attending the creation of the court, the
ICC could easily become a forum for try
ing U.S. military and national policy as
criminal matters.
In a larger sense, Americans should
also be concerned that 66 nations, out of
the nearly 200 in the world, have rail
roaded the formation of this court.
Although its humanitarian purposes
may be noble, a criminal court of univer
sal jurisdiction created by one-third of
the nations of the world, representing
one-sixth of its population, constitutes a
major power play.
The party at the United Nations was
not just about a court; it was also a cele
bration of small and medium-sized na
tions and hundreds of nonprofit organi
zations attempting to level the playing
field with the United States and other
world powers.
