## Softball takes two in wins over UCSB 
### DEBORAH SPLANSKY STAFF WRITER 
The No. 3 Stanford softball
team (35-8) came back from a
series of intense Pacific 10 Con
ference battles and immediately
took the field again last night for
a doubleheader against UC-
Santa Barbara (18-29).

Despite the dreary weather
Tuesday night, the Cardinal
made its homecoming an enjoy
able one, as it scored 15 runs in
14 innings, tallied two straight
victories, and broke a season
high three-game losing streak.
In the first face-off of the
evening, the Cardinal once
again scored early by posting
two runs in the first inning.
Senior shortstop Robin Walk
er singled to left field to open
the inning, and was quickly
driven in by senior center
fielder Jessica Mendoza on a
double to left-center field.
Mendoza later scored on a
groundout by sophomore
catcher Jessica Allister, giving
the Cardinal a 2-0 lead.

Stanford attacked again in
the bottom of the fourth in simi
lar fashion when Walker led off
the inning with a single to left
field. This time around, though,
Mendoza rocketed a deep home
run that bounced off the out
field bleachers to increase the
Cardinal advantage to 4-0. The
two-run shot was Mendoza's
team-leading 12th home run of
the season.

The home runs kept coming
in the bottom of the sixth when
freshman third baseman Leah
Nelson sent a deep shot over the
left-field fence that ricocheted
off of the scoreboard. The three
run home run upped Stanford's
lead to 7-0.
The Gauchos' attempt to

come back in the top of the sev
enth fell short. They rallied with
two runs, but were shut down as
freshman reliever Elizabeth
Bendig finished off the 7-2 vic
tory. Bendig, who had previous
ly only pitched four innings this
season, allowed just two runs in
three innings of work.
Junior pitcher Tori Nyberg,
who struck out six batters in four
innings of shutout ball, picked
up her 20th victory, running
her season record to 20-4.
Stanford took the field again
for the second half of the night
cap, but this time, the Gauchos
scored first.
In the top of the third in
ning, UC-Santa Barbara
scored on a sacrifice fly. How
ever, the Cardinal answered
back in the fourth inning with
three runs of its own. With two
outs, Stanford rallied, and Nel
son, Bendig, and senior right
fielder Jessica Draemel all
came across the plate to give
the Cardinal a 3-1 lead.
The Gauchos proved to be
resilient, as they fought back to
tie the game at three in the top
of the sixth inning.
But the Cardinal once again
answered back, this time tak
ing a commanding lead by
scoring five runs in the bottom
of the inning to take an 8-3
lead. Stanford strung together
six singles and two walks en
route to posting the five final
runs of the game.
Junior pitcher Maureen
LeCocq threw a complete
game for the Cardinal, scatter
ing six hits with four strike
outs, and earning her 14th vic
tory of the season.
After displaying its domi
nance in the doubleheader
sweep, Stanford will attempt
to repeat such a perfor
mance this Friday at 7:00
p.m. at Smith Family Stadi
um against the top-ranked
Wildcats of Arizona. The
Cardinal will then face a two
game series against No. 6
Arizona State on Saturday
and Sunday.
