### MAC LEVINE STAFF WRITER 
It was a cold and rainy night.
There could not have been more
than a couple hundred fans in the
spacious stands of Sunken Dia
mond. The team was coming off a
long, draining weekend series
against USC.

Basically, all of the factors were
pointing toward some type of let
down on Tuesday night, as the No.
2 Cardinal (26-8) battled local
rival, Saint Mary's (15-17) in a non
conference game.
But no such collapse occurred,
as Stanford brought the hammer
down on the overmatched Gaels,
winning for the 18th time in its last
22 games, this time by a lopsided
19-2 margin.
Fighting the rain all night, the
game played right into the hands
of Cardinal head coach Mark Mar
quess, who used a total of 22 play
ers, including seven pitchers.
"The main thing was to give
some work to the pitchers who
didn't get enough work this week
end," said Marquess, referring to
the three-game set against USC.
"That was what we wanted to do
and we were able to do that."
Surprisingly, it was Saint Mary's
that got off to the quick start, scor
ing one run in each of the first two
innings to take an early 2-0 lead.
But the Gaels did not stay on
top for long, as the Cardinal quick
ly stormed back with four runs in
the bottom of the second inning,
including two runs on sophomore
rightfielder Carlos Quentin's

home run blast his seventh on
the season over the left-field
fence.
The game remained close, as
the Cardinal was only leading, 6-2,
heading into the bottom of the sev
enth inning.
But Stanford quickly put the

game out of reach with five runs in
the seventh and eight runs in the
eighth, which marked the 17th
and 18th time this season that the
Cardinal scored five or more runs
in an inning.
Senior infielder ,Andy Topham
led the team with five RBI, going 3 for

4 with a double and two triples, and
senior second baseman Chris O'Rior
dan went 3 for 5 with four RBI.
Sophomore centerfielder Sam
Fuld went 4 for 6 with a triple and
an RBI, tying a careerhigh with his

The No. 2 baseball team made easy work of Saint Mary's Tuesday night, as it handed the Gaels a 19-2 loss. The
Cardinal will travel to Seattle to face Washington in a three-game series this weekend.
four hits.
As a team, the Cardinal's 19
runs tied a season high.
After sophomore starter Drew
Erlich and sophomore David
O'Hagan threw the first one-plus
inning, giving up both Gael runs,
the final five Cardinal relievers
kept Saint Mary's scoreless over
the last eight innings, giving up
only four hits.

Senior righthander J.D. Will
cox (2-1) got the win for Stanford,
retiring all three batters he faced in
the second inning.
Gaels' starter Matt Dolen (1-4)
took the loss, giving up six runs on
seven hits in 3 1/3 innings.
As the fifth Cardinal pitcher of
the game, freshman Mark Jecmen
had one of his most positive outings
of the season, throwing two score
less innings while striking out three.
Jecmen, who came into this sea
son as one of the most highly tout
ed pitchers in the history of Stan
ford baseball, has struggled might

ily on the year with an 8.38 ERA,
but the 6-foot-9 righthander could
still be a valuable arm for Marquess
down the stretch if he continues to
show good command like he did
on Tuesday.
"I thought Jecmen threw really
well," said Marquess. "He's been
getting better each time he's gone
out there."
Jecmen and the rest of the Car
dinal will try to continue their hot
play this weekend, as the team
travels to Washington on Friday
for a three-game Pac-10 series
against the Huskies.
