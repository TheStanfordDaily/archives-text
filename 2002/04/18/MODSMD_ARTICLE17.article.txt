# Track and field team heads to Mt. SAC
## With NCAAs looming, athletes look to gain qualifying marks 
### DANIEL URBAN STAFF WRITER 
Track athletes have little time to
prove themselves.
The season seems barely under
way, yet just one month remains
before the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships.
The Cardinal has made the
most of its few meets thus far,
picking up over 20 qualifiers at
the Stanford Invitational, the
California-Arizona challenge and
last weekend's Brutus Hamilton
Invitational.
Now, Stanford will face its
stiffest competition and also its best
opportunity for top performances
at this weekend's Mt. SAC Relays
in Walnut.
The prestigious annual event
will play host to 45 teams from
across the country, including some
of the favorites for Pac-10 and
NCAA tides.
These teams, however, will
compete more against the clock
and tape measure than they
will against each other. The
Mt. SAC Relays is a prime op
portunity for athletes to gain
qualifying marks for the NCAA

Championships.
Stanford athletes who have
qualified automatically already in
clude sophomore Jillian Camare
na (shot put, 53-10.25), junior
Lauren Fleshman (1,500 meters, 4

minutes, 18.52 seconds), senior
Caroline Annis (10,000 meters,
34:09.40), senior Jonathon Riley
(5,000 meters, 13:40.59), sopho
more Don Sage (10,000 meters,
28:40.12) and junior Louis Luchi
ni (10,000 meters, 28:49.86).
Many others hold provisional
marks that are very close to the au
tomatic standard.
Take, for instance, junior Erin
Sullivan's time of 34:10.6, which is

0.6 seconds shy of an automatic
qualifier in the 10,000 meters.
While Sullivan may be a sure bet to
earn a berth, other athletes are
looking to strengthen their provi
sional marks or, ideally, earn an
automatic berth into the NCAA
Championships.
Stanford is focused on sending
the largest group to the champi
onship in school history.
Arkansas and Colorado,
Stanford's two most serious ri
vals in the long-distance
events, will both be present at
the relays.
The quality of compedtion at
Mt. SAC will certainly motivate all
the athletes to perform their best,
as will the fact that the number of
remaining meets is winding down.
"We have quite a few girls ei
ther qualified for nationals al
ready or are in a very good posi
tion to do so in the next few :
meets," Fleshman said. "The next
couple of weeks are crunch time.
Every opportunity to race must
be seized because the season is
flying by."
Expect the talented and mo
tivated Cardinal squad, which is
well accustomed to pressure
and high expectations, to rise to
the occasion.
The women are up for it,"
Fleshman said.
It would be safe to assume the
guys are, too.
