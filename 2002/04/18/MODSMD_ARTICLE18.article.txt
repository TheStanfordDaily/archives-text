# No. 2 women's tennis readies for matches with UCLA, USC
## Cardinal women head to Los Angeles for key rematches 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Just as the No. 2 Stanford women's
tennis team (20-1, 6-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) reaches its highest ranking in
months, it faces the toughest weekend of
its dual-match season.
This Friday and Saturday, the Cardi
nal travels to Los Angeles to take on the
only other teams that are undefeated in

Pac-10 play, No. 5 UCLA (15-3,6-0) and
No. 10 Southern California (16-6, 6-0).
These two teams have been busy reach
ing new heights of their own.
"Personally, I think this is the best that
both those teams have been [in my four
years]," senior Gabriela Lastra said.
Added senior Lauren Kalvaria: "This
is the toughest weekend that.we're going

to face. We're really going to have to
focus."
By all indications the Cardinal is
ready. Stanford's recent performance
has it within a hair's breadth of No. 1
Georgia the only team to beat the
Cardinal this year in the latest ITA
rankings. The Cardinal's individual
rankings also reflect a team that has
dominated all comers lately, including a
7-0 victory over USC and a 6-1 victory
over UCLA two weekends ago at home
in matches that did not count in the Pac
-10 standings. If Stanford sweeps the
L.A. schools for a second time, it will win
the Pac-10 crown.
"If we're able to do that again, that

would add more confidence going into
NCAAs," Lastra said.
Stanford boasts some of its best
individual rankings of the season,
and, as always, the players match up
well with their opponents, particu
larly in singles.
Kalvaria jumped six spots to the No. 4
ranking in singles, Lastra moved up six
spots to No. 12, sophomore Lauren
Barnikow remained at No. 14, and fresh
man Erin Burdette moved up one spot to
No. 23.
In doubles, Kalvaria and Lastra
moved one rung up the ladder and took
a dominant hold of the No. 1 ranking.
Barnikow and Burdette fell three spots

to No. 17/
"Everyone's really confident," Lastra
said.
UCLA and USC have their share of
dominant players, though, as indicated
by matches earlier this month.
UCLA boasts the freshman phenom
Megan Bradley, ranked No. 3 in singles,
as well as No. 8 Sara Walker and No. 71
Petya Marinova.
In doubles, Walker and Marinova are
ranked No. 2, and Bradley and Megan
Fisher come in at No. 3. With a one-two
punch like that, many teams lose the
doubles point to UCLA including

Stanford, which lost it in the first
match.
"It helps that now we've got a
feel for them," senior Keiko
Tokuda said.
USC's Jewel Peterson is No. 6
in singles, and is joined by No. 35
Luana Magnani and No. 99
Maureen Diaz. Peterson and
Tiffany Brymer are No. 6 in dou
bles and Magnani and Anita Loy
ola are No. 28.
Things are made more diffi
cult by the fact that the matches
are played on the road.
"It's very different on the
road," Lastra said. "The weather
will probably be a lot warmer."
Nonetheless, the Cardinal is
confident that it will come out
with two big wins.
"We're all excited to beat up
on them again," Lastra said.
