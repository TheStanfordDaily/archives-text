# Men's swimming keeps heads high
## After taking second at NCAAs, team looks to promising future 
### KENNETH GARRETT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The' Stanford men's swim
ming and diving team did not
start its 2001-02 season at Stan
ford or in a pool. Instead, the
year began on a camping trip in a
remote location near Colorado
Springs, Col., where they not
only gelled as a team, but also re
alized that they had potential to
be the best swim team Stanford
had ever seen.
"They just did everything
right," said head coach Skip Ken
ney. "This team was absolutely a
coach's dream."
After making easy work of its
preseason foes, the Cardinal con
firmed its dominance by crushing
some of the best teams in the coun
try during the dual-meet season.
Simply winning each meet
wasn't enough, though. The Car
dinal also set pool records every
where it went, as if it were the easi
est thing in the world.
"It was an incredibly successful

season even though we didn't
quite reach our goal," said senior
tri-captain Michael O'Neil. "We
learned a lot in getting there, and
we had fun too."

Although the Cardinal may
have made its victories look easy,
nothing could have been farther
from the truth. It was only
through teamwork, leadership
and hours of grueling practice that
the Cardinal became that good.
"It was a lot of fun to see who
would step up and lead every prac
tice because it could have been
anybody from any class," said
sophomore Michael Bruce.
A perfect example of hard work
translating into leadership and
greatness was freshman Matt Mc-
Donald.
"He works so hard in practice
that he loses his lunch in the gutter
and still finishes the set," sopho
more Peter Marshall said.
His hard work paid off. Mc-
Donald surprised everyone by
qualifying first in the 200-yard
butterfly at The NCAA Champi
onship, a race that he had never
swam in high school.
After winning its 21st consecu
tive Pacific 10 Conference Cham
pionship by a comfortable margin,
the Cardinal knew it was good

enough to win at The NCAA
Championship.
In fact, the team seemed invin
cible, which made the second
place finish to Texas that much
harder to swallow.
"It was bittersweet in the end to
win the swimming competition
and lose the overall competition
because we felt we were one of the
best teams ever," Marshall said.
Even though the Cardinal fin
ished with an amazing 501 points,
outscoring the Texas swimmers by
a large margin, the Texas diving
squad scored over 100 points, tip
ping the scales barely in favor of
the Longhorns.
"Even though we swam fast in the
end, it just wasn't fast enough to beat
the Texas divers," Marshall said.
Despite the final score, Kenney
saw the meet as a great accom
plishment for his team.
"We'll remember this year as,
'Wow, that's the year we had the
greatest swim meet.' They did
everything they could. Our guys
just never let up," Kenney said.
One thing the team seems to
agree on is that despite the disap
pointment of being a team of cham
pions but not taking the champi
onship, they learned valuable lessons
that will serve them well in the future.

Perhaps most important is the
lesson expressed by Marshall.
"It'd be great to have rings, but
it's more about hanging out with
the guys on the team and just hav
ing fun, making memories that
you're going to think of when
you're 50 years old."
This year's disappointment will
also fire the team up to be even bet
ter next year.
"If everyone can add their little
piece, whether staying on top or
moving up a position at NCAAs,
we should have a chance to not
only win but be the best team
ever," McDonald said. "It's a goal
we should set for ourselves because
we can definitely achieve it if every
body swims to their potential."
With every single point scorer
returning to the team next year,
chances are excellent that the Car
dinal will be just as dominant. With
the addition of an outstanding re
cruiting class, including Canadian
standout Tobias Oriwol, it is likely
that the Cardinal will be the best it
has ever been.
"Next year we'll have the na
tional championship enough
said," Marshall predicted. "My fa
vorite memory of next year will be
celebrating in Longhorn country
after winning NCAAs."

pions but not taking the champi
onship, they learned valuable lessons
that will serve them well in the future.

Perhaps most important is the
lesson expressed by Marshall.
"It'd be great to have rings, but
it's more about hanging out with
the guys on the team and just hav
ing fun, making memories that
you're going to think of when
you're 50 years old."
This year's disappointment will
also fire the team up to be even bet
ter next year.
"If everyone can add their little
piece, whether staying on top or
moving up a position at NCAAs,
we should have a chance to not
only win but be the best team
ever," McDonald said. "It's a goal
we should set for ourselves because
we can definitely achieve it if every
body swims to their potential."
With every single point scorer
returning to the team next year,
chances are excellent that the Car
dinal will be just as dominant. With
the addition of an outstanding re
cruiting class, including Canadian
standout Tobias Oriwol, it is likely
that the Cardinal will be the best it
has ever been.
"Next year we'll have the na
tional championship enough
said," Marshall predicted. "My fa
vorite memory of next year will be
celebrating in Longhorn country
after winning NCAAs."
