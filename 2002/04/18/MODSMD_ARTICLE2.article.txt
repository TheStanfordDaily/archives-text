# Henestroza/Rodriguez claim victory in ASSU race
## 
### JOHN HUETTER STAFF WRITER 
Exemplary of the grueling
ASSU presidential campaign,
last night's ASSU election results
witnessed a tough and tense
crowd. Numerous onlookers
and candidates were ready to
heckle candidates and special fee
groups who,disagreed with their
philosophies.
Despite the controversies and
cynicism, when the smoke
cleared, nearly all of the Special
Fees groups received funding,
and ASSU presidential slate
Monica Henestroza and Nick Ro
driguez won the highest ASSU
office.

To cries of "One more year"
from onlookers (led by The Stan
ford Chaparral's former editor,
senior Gideon Lewis-Kraus),
ASSU President Matt Brewer
took the stand and introduced the
election results.

Sophomore Connie Chen re
ceived the most votes for a ASSU
Undergraduate Senate candi
date, getting re-elected with 1,229
votes.

Both the new and incumbent
Senates will see more election
drama at the next meeting, as
freshmen executive aides Sarah
Schulman and Ellie Martin were
tied for the last Senate slot, with
825 votes.

This year's Senate will vote to
confirm one of them as next year's
15th senator, presumably at its
Tuesday meeting.
Nearly all of the 52 Special Fee
groups passed, with only Masque
Magazine, Stanford Biodesign,
WAVES, SALSA!, SCBN, Stan
ford Asia Technology Initiative
and Stanford Mock Trial failing to
receive funding.
Students voted to keep Pro
gramming, Community Service,
and Publications Boards at the
same level of funding next year.

All three General Fee Boards re
ceived zero per cent increases.
Sophomore class presidential
slate Your 4-4-0-5 (Alida Garcia.
Ebony Nyenya. Paul Wilkins.
Zach Katagiri) won the freshman
class's votes, beating The Golden
Ticket 495 votes to 436 votes.
Junior class presidential slate
Junior Mints (Mikey Lee, Mary
Himinkool, Michael Scrafford,
Shayna Fernandez) ran unop
posed, and beat junior write-in
slates, 601 votes to 218 votes. Se
nior slate SCORE! (Ruby Ng,
Judi Jackson, Rajaie Batniji,
James Alva ) won the junior class,
defeating runners-up So Fresh,
So Clean, 648 votes to 328 votes.
"We're gonna go eat choco
late," said junior Judi Jackson, of
the winning senior class presiden
tial slate SCORE! "We're really
excited; we're going to go cele
brate."

But the main event was clearly
the intense ASSU presidential

race. Junior Henestroza and
sophomore Rodriguez defeated
the second place slate, juniors Josh
Benson and Kendra Arimoto,
2129 votes to 1927 votes.
The tense crowd exploded, the
slate's supporters lifting Hene
stroza into the air and leading
clapping and cheers to celebrate.
"They're going to hold it
down," said ASSU Vice President
Christine Cordero, smiling. "I
can sleep at night leaving it in
competent hands beyond
competent."
"202 votes," Kendra Arimoto

said. "We couldn't have asked for
better." She said she and Benson
would be around to help with the
ASSU next year.
"I congratulate Nick and Moni
ca on a hard-fought campaign. I
wish them the best in office. It's
been fun working with both of
them, and I'm confident they will
do a fantastic job," said presidential
candidate Mike Osofsky, a junior.
"It Was such a race," said Ro
driguez. "It was so competitive."
He said that it would not do "jus
tice to the other slates" if they
didn't "make sure we do the best

job the ASSU has ever done."
Henestroza, hugging well
wishers after the race, said she
had plans for the beginning of her
term, but for now, her plans were,
"For tonight, and tomorrow
night, sleeping."
"It was a victory for America,"
said senior Jacob Young, former
editor of the Stanford Chaparral,
"and what America needed was a
victory."
"It's going to be an interesting
year next year," said an observer,
shaking his head and smiling as
he left the election mayhem.
