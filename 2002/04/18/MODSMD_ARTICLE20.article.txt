# Red Wings lose first NHL playoff game

### 
DETROIT (AP) A hush fell over
Hockey town.
Henrik Sedin scored an unassisted
goal, off the shoulder of Detroit's Igor
Larionov, at 13:59 of overtime to give
the Vancouver Canucks a 4-3 win over
the Red Wings on Wednesday night in
Game 1 of their first-round series.
A sold-out crowd left Joe Louis
Arena virtually silent as the Red
Wings' collection of future Hall of
Famers stumbled on the first step to
ward its quest for the Stanley Cup.
"Wje're not going to panic, every
body else can panic," Detroit's Darren
McCarty said. "It's what we expect with
the team we have, with what we expect
of ourselves and what people expect
from us. We know what it is."
The "it," is a Stanley Cup, the one
and only result that will be acceptable
for the Red Wings and their rabid fans.
Detroit, which had the NHL's best
record, will play host to the Western
Conference's eighth-seeded Canucks
again Friday, in Game 2 of the best-of

seven series.
"It makes Friday even bigger," Mc-
Carty said.
Sedin said he didn't have a clear path
toward Dominik Hasek, who made just
22 saves, so he just lifted his shot into
traffic from above the right circle.
"I just tried to get it on net," Sedin
said. "I saw it on TV, it hit (Larionov) on
his shoulder."
Detroit coach Scotty Bowman de
fended the play of Hasek, the six-time
Vezina Trophy winner and two-time
league MVP.
"One was deflected and one was in
traffic," Bowman said. "There's not
much you can do on those."
Luc Robitaille, Sergei Fedorov and
Igor Larionov scored for the Red Wings
in regulation to give them 1-0, 2-1 and
3-2 leads.
Todd Warriner, Andrew Cassels and
Trevor Linden scored for Vancouver.
Linden's goal tied it at 3 at 10:47 of the
third period.
Dan Cloutier stopped 32 shots for

the Canucks.
"It's always great to beat the best
goalie in the league," Cloutier said.
"But once the puck drops, I can't
worry about who is in the other net."
A Red Wings miscue allowed the
Canucks to tie the game for a third time.
Linden kept the puck in Detroit's
end after Pavel Datsyuk was unable to
clear it. Linden knocked the puck
ahead to Artem Chubarov, who got it
back to Linden, who flipped it past
Hasek as the red-and-white clad crowd
sighed with disappointment.
The 41-year-old Larionov, the
oldest player in the NHL, scored
early in the third to put the Red
Wings ahead 3-2.
Robitaille scored the game's first goal
at 17:51 of the first. Steve Yzerman
flipped a pass off the boards near the
red line, but defenseman Bryan
Helmer mishandled it, allowing Ro
bitaille to corral the puck above the cir
cles and beat Cloutier with a wrist shot
after faking a backhander.
