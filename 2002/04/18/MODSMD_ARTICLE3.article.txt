# Israel independence day meets protest
## 
### ALI ALEMOZAFAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A celebration commemorating the
founding of Israel met with a peaceful
protest in White Plaza yesterday as a
group of students and members of the sur
rounding community gathered to mourn
the loss of lives in the Israeli and Palestin
ian territories.
The sight of falafel and speakers for
the Israeli Independence Day celebra
tion stood out against a backdrop of signs
and banners proclaiming: "Stop U.S. aid
to Israel."
Coordinators from both sides offered
their viewpoints on the day's events that
together attracted more than 400 individ
uals on White Plaza.
"This is a cultural celebration ... a cel
ebration of Israel's existence," said fresh
man Avi Rotam, who organized the Israeli
Independence Day celebration with se
nior Justine Fisher.
"We thought it was important to pre
sent the other side of the story," said for
mer student Mashhood Rassam, an or
ganizer of the counter-protest. "With
the founding of Israel, a lot of people
were displaced from their homes . . . the
Palestinian oppression has to be a part of
that story."
"I really have a lot of respect for the
Palestinians here," Fisher said. "It's
really good that they get their point
out there."
On Nov. 29, 1947, the U.N. General
Assembly voted to partition Palestine into
an Arab and Jewish state. Israel's Inde

pendence Day, or Yom Ha'atzmaut, falls
on April 17 this year.
"It's our goal to make the event as apo
litical as possible," Fisher said.
The counter-protest was spearhead
ed by Students for Palestine, an organi
zation that recognizes the existence of a
Jewish state and condemns all acts of vi
olence and intolerance. By teaching the
Stanford community about the current

conflict in the Middle East, the organiza
tion hopes to bring an end to the suffer
ing of the Palestinian people in the occu
pied territories.

pie faced in Europe during World
War 11.
"We believe that there are many
reasons for the necessity of a Jewish
state," Rotam said.
"This is a very respectful
counter-protest," an anonymous
member of the crowd said. "We're
celebrating Israel's existence."

These two events take place in
light of the recent violence in this re
gion of the world.
"Students for Palestine wants to
highlight human rights abuses by
Israeli forces and what happened
in Jenin, Ramallah and Bethle
hem," said Ammar Nayfeh, a grad
uate student in electrical engineer
ing and one of the coordinators of
the counter-protest. "We cannot as
normal citizens sit here and watch
Israel do this."
Traditionally the Israeli In

dependence Day celebration
has involved Israeli food, music
and dancing. Fisher explained
that this year's event will not in
clude dancing because that
would be inappropriate in light
of the current situation in the
Middle East.
"Something [has to be] done
because there are a lot of atroci
ties in the Middle East," said
graduate student Hossam
Fahmy. "The state of Palestine
should be recognized."
