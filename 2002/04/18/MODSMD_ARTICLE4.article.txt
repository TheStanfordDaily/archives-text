# 'Magic' set to hit the Farm
## The 						Music Dept. presents Mozart's opera 'The Magic Flute 
### CYNTHIA CHO EDITORIAL STAFF 
Tomorrow night, audience members
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium will be trans
ported to a fantasy world to witness a
tale of two young lovers who face nu
merous struggles as the forces of reason
and passion combat each other.
The Music Department's production
of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's last and

most popular opera, "The Magic Flute,"
will open at 8 p.m. tomorrow with per
formances throughout the weekend.
This is the first time in four years that
the Music Department has organized a
large-scale stage production.
In May of 1998, Stanford students
performed "Dido and Aeneas" in cele
bration of the Music Department's 50th
anniversary. Senior Lecturer in Voice
Jennifer Lane who directed "Dido
and Aeneas" will also direct "The
Magic Flute."
"The music expresses goodness more
powerfully than any other music I've
ever heard," Lane said. "The
vocal demands are wonderfully
carried. The story, like many sto
ries involving a quest, leads the
hero and heroine into surprising
situations in which they must fig
ure out whom they can trust,
learn from and emulate. [lt is]
much like undergraduate life."
Most of the roles are per
formed by Stanford students, but
several professional singers are
involved with the opera.
"The lead tenor part
[Tamino] was written for a 31-
year-old singer and that shows,"
Lane said. It will be played by
Lawrence Jones, a San Francisco
Conservatory student, and
Tapan Bhat, a local young pro
fessional. Both of the Paminas,
the lead soprano, will be played

by Stanford juniors Elyse Nakaji
ma and Jessica Wan.
All of the principals in the
opera are double-casted
which means that there are two
completely separate casts, each of
which will perform twice this
weekend.
The orchestra will be under
the direction of Giancarlo
Aquilanti, lecturer in music and
the conductor of the Stanford
Wind Ensemble.
Aquilanti describes the music
as simple but beautiful.
"Looking at the score, the
music is surprisingly very
straightforward. It isn't what
you would expect from a com
poser so late in his career,"
Aquilanti said.
"But only Mozart could write
something so beautiful with such
simple stuff. He was able to
achieve $o much with so little,"
he continued.
The orchestra includes

members of the Stanford Wind
Ensemble, string players cho
sen by the St. Lawrence String
Quartet and two professional
musicians. It began rehearsing
in early March.
The cast has been rehearsing
since the beginning of winter
quarter. With one more dress re
hearsal left tonight, many in
volved in the show said they were
excited and nervous about open
ing night.
"The production of the Magic
Flute is an incredibly exciting
event for the music community
and for Stanford as a whole," said
freshman Dan Fink, who will
play Monostatos. "The uncount
able hours that have been con
tributed by the directors, cast,
crew, and musicians have been
aimed at creating a professional
opera experience on our own
campus."
Lane also commented on the
effort that went into the pro
duction.
"For me, after four months of
struggling against endless stu
dent academic conflicts and
other significant obstacles to
both produce and direct one of
the most beautiful operas ever
written, in a University depart
ment that has no mechanism for
such productions it's an act of

faith. Faith that the demanding
detailed work the cast and I did
over the last few months will pay
off," Lane said.
"I hope that audience mem
bers will somehow grasp the
beauty and greatness of the
opera," Aquilanti said, "If some
thing doesn't go as planned,
that is the beauty and excite
ment of live music. Otherwise,
we would listen to recordings,"
he continued.
The production of "The
Magic Flute" is sponsored by
Dr. A. Jess Shenson, a long-time
supporter of the School of Med

icine and the Music Depart
ment. Shenson died on Feb. 26;
this production is dedicated to
his memory.
The budget for the opera is
just under $70,000. Proceeds
from the four scheduled perfor
mances will go toward future
opera productions.
Performances will take place
at 8 p.m. on Friday, Saturday
and Sunday. There is also a
matinee performance on Sunday
at 2:30 p.m. Tickets for the opera
can be purchased through the
Stanford Ticket Office in Tresid
der Union or at the door. Ticket

prices are $2O for general admis
sion and $lO with a student ID.

"The Magic Flute is about
young people and posits the idea
that wisdom abides in the young.
I like that idea a lot and the
music is sublime," Lane said.
"Many people know and love this
work and it can be well-per
formed by young singers. I think
it shouldn't be missed."
"It has been an honor to be a
part of this production, and I
hope that Stanford students take
advantage of this opportunity by
coming to experience the magic
for themselves," Fink said.

most popular opera, "The Magic Flute,"
will open at 8 p.m. tomorrow with per
formances throughout the weekend.
This is the first time in four years that
the Music Department has organized a
large-scale stage production.
In May of 1998, Stanford students
performed "Dido and Aeneas" in cele
bration of the Music Department's 50th
anniversary. Senior Lecturer in Voice
Jennifer Lane who directed "Dido
and Aeneas" will also direct "The
Magic Flute."
"The music expresses goodness more
powerfully than any other music I've
ever heard," Lane said. "The
vocal demands are wonderfully
carried. The story, like many sto
ries involving a quest, leads the
hero and heroine into surprising
situations in which they must fig
ure out whom they can trust,
learn from and emulate. [lt is]
much like undergraduate life."
Most of the roles are per
formed by Stanford students, but
several professional singers are
involved with the opera.
"The lead tenor part
[Tamino] was written for a 31-
year-old singer and that shows,"
Lane said. It will be played by
Lawrence Jones, a San Francisco
Conservatory student, and
Tapan Bhat, a local young pro
fessional. Both of the Paminas,
the lead soprano, will be played

by Stanford juniors Elyse Nakaji
ma and Jessica Wan.
All of the principals in the
opera are double-casted
which means that there are two
completely separate casts, each of
which will perform twice this
weekend.
The orchestra will be under
the direction of Giancarlo
Aquilanti, lecturer in music and
the conductor of the Stanford
Wind Ensemble.
Aquilanti describes the music
as simple but beautiful.
"Looking at the score, the
music is surprisingly very
straightforward. It isn't what
you would expect from a com
poser so late in his career,"
Aquilanti said.
"But only Mozart could write
something so beautiful with such
simple stuff. He was able to
achieve $o much with so little,"
he continued.
The orchestra includes

members of the Stanford Wind
Ensemble, string players cho
sen by the St. Lawrence String
Quartet and two professional
musicians. It began rehearsing
in early March.
The cast has been rehearsing
since the beginning of winter
quarter. With one more dress re
hearsal left tonight, many in
volved in the show said they were
excited and nervous about open
ing night.
"The production of the Magic
Flute is an incredibly exciting
event for the music community
and for Stanford as a whole," said
freshman Dan Fink, who will
play Monostatos. "The uncount
able hours that have been con
tributed by the directors, cast,
crew, and musicians have been
aimed at creating a professional
opera experience on our own
campus."
Lane also commented on the
effort that went into the pro
duction.
"For me, after four months of
struggling against endless stu
dent academic conflicts and
other significant obstacles to
both produce and direct one of
the most beautiful operas ever
written, in a University depart
ment that has no mechanism for
such productions it's an act of

faith. Faith that the demanding
detailed work the cast and I did
over the last few months will pay
off," Lane said.
"I hope that audience mem
bers will somehow grasp the
beauty and greatness of the
opera," Aquilanti said, "If some
thing doesn't go as planned,
that is the beauty and excite
ment of live music. Otherwise,
we would listen to recordings,"
he continued.
The production of "The
Magic Flute" is sponsored by
Dr. A. Jess Shenson, a long-time
supporter of the School of Med

icine and the Music Depart
ment. Shenson died on Feb. 26;
this production is dedicated to
his memory.
The budget for the opera is
just under $70,000. Proceeds
from the four scheduled perfor
mances will go toward future
opera productions.
Performances will take place
at 8 p.m. on Friday, Saturday
and Sunday. There is also a
matinee performance on Sunday
at 2:30 p.m. Tickets for the opera
can be purchased through the
Stanford Ticket Office in Tresid
der Union or at the door. Ticket

prices are $2O for general admis
sion and $lO with a student ID.

"The Magic Flute is about
young people and posits the idea
that wisdom abides in the young.
I like that idea a lot and the
music is sublime," Lane said.
"Many people know and love this
work and it can be well-per
formed by young singers. I think
it shouldn't be missed."
"It has been an honor to be a
part of this production, and I
hope that Stanford students take
advantage of this opportunity by
coming to experience the magic
for themselves," Fink said.
