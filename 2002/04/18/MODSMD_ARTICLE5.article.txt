# ASSU petition supports WRC
## 
### JOHN HUETTER EDITORIAL STAFF 
Despite the year rapidly drawing to a
close and the large number of senators in
volved in the 2002 ASSU election, the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate still found time on
Tuesday night to fund a number of student
groups, in addition to discussing the Work
ers' Rights Consortium and signing a peti
tion urging Stanford to join the body.
Though the Graduate Student Council re
jected the endorsement of the campaign,
campaign organizer Pat Bomhack obtained
13 signatures of support (out of 13 senators

present) for
the campaign
from the Sen
ate. He pre

sented them in a meeting with University
President John Hennessy yesterday to dis
cuss Stanford joining the organization, which
monitors potential abuses of athletic apparel
factory workers.
Over 20 professors and 100 student-ath
letes have signed similar petitions urging
the University which has an athletic ap
parel contract with Nike to join the con
sortium instead of the similar Fair Labor

Association, which allows apparel
corporations such as Nike to place
members on its board of direc
tors. Stanford would be able to
have a voice in what the consor
tium did, Bomhack told senators.
Originally, a Senate resolution
in support of the campaign was
planned, but Bomhack, a sopho
more, opted to table the resolu
tion bill and show Senate support
via petition, based on Senate Ad
vocacy Committee advice.
Bomhack said his decision was
also made out of a "concern that
an ASSU resolution might cause a
backlash against our campaign."
In contrast, a letter of support
signed by senators "would sort of
act as a similar representation and
a similar symbol, without the pos
sible backlash of an ASSU resolu
tion," Bomhack said. "Signing
this is basically signing a petition."
Senate Associate Josh Shipp, a
freshman, questioned if individ
ual signatures counted as the sup
port of the Senate, and Bomhack,
at the suggestion of Senate
Deputy Chair Mike Osofsky, said
that he would merely present the
signatures to show that he had the
support of a number of under
graduate senators.
Initially, Bomhack said, the

resolution was intended as away
to gain momentum for the cam
paign; now, it would be used in
case the administration opposed
the campaign.
"This is an added sort of sec
ond round [tactic]," Bomhack
said, although he said after the
Senate meeting he was optimistic
for his talk with Hennessy.
"We're very excited and en
thusiastic to work with Hen
nessy and the rest of the admin
istration," Bomhack said.
"[l'm] confident we're going to
work together."
The Advocacy Committee, ac
cording to Committee Co-Chair
Ximena Martinez, urged
Bomhack to use a petition instead
of a resolution because it wanted
more time to research opposing
viewpoints before presenting a
recommendation to the Senate
on whether or not to endorse the
campaign. In addition, it wanted
to find more ways in which the
committee and the Senate could
be a resource and help with the
campaign beyond a written reso
lution.
"We want to give more than
that," said Martinez, a junior. She
said that although she could not
speak for the committee," she
wanted to involve next year's
input from the Senate in advocat
ing for the students supporting
the consortium.
"We want to add action items

[to the bill] that next year's Senate
may be able to help with," Mar
tinez said.
If necessary, the bill will be re
drafted to include new informa
tion and potential actions for the
Senate to take. ?
However, as Bomhack hoped, j
the University seemed willing to i
examine the issue without the res- |
olution. He met with Hennessy }
yesterday, armed with at least f
1,000 signatures in support of'
Stanford joining the consortium
and a proposal of what the cam
paign at Stanford sought.
"It went very well," Bomhack
said. "They were very responsive
to our concerns." He said that
Hennessy and the other adminis
trators seemed willing to work
with the campaign.
"They're concerned about
these issues," he said. "It's defi
nitely going to be a hand-in
hand process."
Administrators are expected
to informally contact Bomhack
within the next two weeks to
further discuss courses of action
for the University regarding the
issue.
In addition, student groups
Circle K, Stanford Cooking Club,
Stanford Squash Women's Team,
DVB, SURGE, Stanford College
Bowl, Stanford Tennis Club and
Jewish Student Association were
funded by consensus out of the
ASSU General Fee.
