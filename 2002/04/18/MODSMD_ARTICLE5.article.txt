### JOHN HUETTER EDITORIAL STAFF 
Despite the year rapidly drawing to a
close and the large number of senators in
volved in the 2002 ASSU election, the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate still found time on
Tuesday night to fund a number of student
groups, in addition to discussing the Work
ers' Rights Consortium and signing a peti
tion urging Stanford to join the body.
Though the Graduate Student Council re
jected the endorsement of the campaign,
campaign organizer Pat Bomhack obtained
13 signatures of support (out of 13 senators

present) for
the campaign
from the Sen
ate. He pre

sented them in a meeting with University
President John Hennessy yesterday to dis
cuss Stanford joining the organization, which
monitors potential abuses of athletic apparel
factory workers.
Over 20 professors and 100 student-ath
letes have signed similar petitions urging
the University which has an athletic ap
parel contract with Nike to join the con
sortium instead of the similar Fair Labor
