# M-state elixir may be youth potion

According to followers of
"ormus" metals, an exilir called
"M-state" holds the key to ever
lasting life. Web sites indicate
that the mysterious recipe for
this drink contains M-state
monatomic metals. A published
patent application describes how
it can be made through a process
of boiling pure gold in a vat of lye
for several days, replenishing
the water as it boils off, then re
ducing the acidity and collecting
the salts that precipitate.
Web sites such as mountain
manna.com, rangeguide.net
and oceanalchemy.com allow
customers to purchase solutions
that supposedly contain ormus
metals for upwards of $55 per 4-
ounce bottle.
The middle-aged Arizona
farmer who founded the theory
behind the M-state is named
David Hudson. Texts from many
of his speeches from a 1994 to
1996 lecture tour have been
made available. Using numerous
respected scientific references,
he claimed to have taken re

search to a new level, one that
bridges modern science and
metaphysical new age beliefs.
However, investigation into
these exceptional claims leads to
an interesting story of cult-like
activities and new age explana
tions based on misinterpreted
science. Researchers familiar
with Hudson's reference list
confirm the inaccuracies of sev
eral statements Hudson himself
made during a Dallas lecture in
1996.
Unfortunately, this form of
charlatanism preys on desperate
as well as health-conscious peo
ple. According to an article pub
lished in the Sept. 19, 1996 issue
of the Phoenix New Times,
Hudson's teachings may have fu
eled a young Leslie Burroughs
of Tucson, Ariz, to inject herself
with what she believed were M
state metals that would cure her
HIV infection. Instead, she fell
into a coma on her second dose
and died a month later. Her offi
cial cause of death was sepsis,
likely caused by the unsanitary
conditions by which the injec
tions were administered.
Today, Hudson's ideas are

again gaining popularity. Quiet
ly, several online companies are
selling liquids for consumption
that purportedly contain M-state
compounds. According to an
anonymous supporter of M-state
materials, one popular M-state
mailing list reaches out to over
400 people.

Hudson and his followers are
not alone. Another unrelated
site, www.alexchiu.com, profess
es to sell immortality: all you
have to do is purchase and wear
a magnetic ring. Absurdly, Alex
Chiu has a U.S. patent on this
ring "invention."
The exploding popularity of
nutritional supplements and
naturopathic treatments is
leading to a new breed of con
men who feed off gullible Inter
net users.
The business plan is simple: a
con artist develops a profession
al-looking Web site, write scien
tifically sounding and often mis
leading text, and accept the
credit cards of unsuspecting
and misinformed buyers. While
Hudson and Chiu are relatively
easy to spot, others are more
subtle.!

Former Stanford Clinical
Asst. Prof. Heidi Roberts,
M.D., acknowledged the prob
lem. Although her patients
rarely follow harmful informa
tion from the Internet, they
often refer to dubious health
advice received electronically.
"I have people bring stuff off
the Web all the time," she said.
Stanford M.D./Ph.D. candi
date George Scott also said that
future clinicians are going to be
affected.
"This is a huge problem.
[There is] going to be an increas
ing need for education at the pa
tient level," he said.
In an effort to highlight
fraudulent claims, retired psy
chiatrist and leading consumer
advocate Dr. Stephen Barrett
has developed a Web site called
Quackwatch.com.
Barrett advises that it is gen
erally a bad idea to use informa
tion being delivered by someone
who is selling something. Quack
watch.com has set up a listing of
over 180 trustworthy sites that
offer credible information.
