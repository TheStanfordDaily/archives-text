After much waiting and an
ticipation by prospective fresh
men, current students and fac
ulty alike, Stanford's Admit
Weekend for the Class of 2006
begins today.
This year's event promises to
be one of the largest in Stanford
history, with over 1,200 stu
dents and 1,000 parents expect
ed to attend.
Mary Himinkool, the host re
cruitment and publicity coordi
nator for Admit Weekend, ex
plained that the purpose of the
weekend is to let prospective
students discover what a Stan
ford college experience is really
like.
"We hope to provide an accu
rate representation of the many
aspects of Stanford ranging
from academics to campus life,
opportunities beyond the class
room and student social life,"
Himinkool said.
"We want to show Stanford as
it truly is, and allow this magnet
ic campus to speak for itself," he
said.
Adam Haas, a prospective
freshman from southern Cali
fornia said, "I am looking for
ward to getting an idea this
weekend of how Stanford com
pares to and is different from
other colleges."
There are numerous speaker
panels that will attempt to in
form prospective students about
concerns ranging from major se
lection to research opportunities
to residential life. Also, there will
be special events such as activi
ties fairs, a cappella concert per
formances and dances.
"The academic events, cul
tural and social activities, music
and art affairs and the student
social gatherings we have
planned are merely a few of this
weekend's highlights,"

Himinkool said. "The Admit
Weekend team wants to wel
come prospective freshmen into
this community."
Himinkool also explained
that there will be plenty of fun in
the residence halls thanks to the
work by 140 house hosts. The
five different themes for the
house activities are Hip Hop
Night, Casino Night, Cardinal
Carnival, Beach Boardwalk and
Under the Sea.
"These events are completely
student-initiated and run,"
Himinkool said. "We're hoping
that everyone will join us for
great music, entertainment,
food and most of all for the
great company."
As usual, Alcohol is strictly
prohibited this weekend.
"Admit Weekend is a dry
event, with zero tolerance for al
cohol and drugs at our campus
wide events," Himinkool said.
"We ask that students respect
this policy and act responsibly
throughout the weekend.
Two directors, seven student
coordinators and over 1,600 stu
dent volunteers have con
tributed to the effort.
"Preparation for this big
weekend begins early fall quar
ter, with countless hours of team
meetings, event planning, host
recruitment and publicity and
contact with profros and their
families," Himinkool said.
While difficult at times,
Himinkool explained that she
and her fellow members of the
team have enjoyed undertaking
the task of organizing such a
large event.
"Planning and coordinating
Admit Weekend has been one of
the highlights of my year,"
Himinkool said. "We coordina
tors are so excited to be part of
such an amazing team and are
grateful for this chance to give
back to the Stanford community
that has given us so much."
