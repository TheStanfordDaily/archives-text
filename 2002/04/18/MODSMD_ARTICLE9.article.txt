## THE 						STANFORD DAILY Stanford's Mideast protests promote awareness 
### 
Yesterday afternoon in White Plaza,
the conflict in the Middle East arrived
on the Stanford campus. But unlike
the violence that has been terrorizing
Palestinians and Israelis or the angry and de
structive rallies at other college campuses
around the nation, Stanford students repre
sented themselves with dignity and respect
while discussing this emotionally charged topic.
We laud both the willingness of the groups to or
ganize these important events as well as the ci
vility they demonstrated yesterday.
The Stanford community has often been la
beled as apathetic, especially when it comes to
issues of national and international concern.
For example, last year while students at the
UC-Berkeley and Brown University were
protesting David Horowitz's advertisement

about reparations for slavery, the issue drew
little interest among Stanford students outside
of the Black Student Union and The Daily.
However, the more than 400 individuals in
White Plaza yesterday afternoon some cel
ebrating Israel's Independence Day, others
protesting against Israel's occupation of Pales
tinian lands demonstrated that, at least on
this issue, Stanford students really do care.
Events like these are extremely helpful to
educate the Stanford community about what
exactly is going on in the Middle East and
how it is affecting their fellow Stanford stu
dents, some of whom have personal ties to
both sides of the conflict. Without these on
campus activities, the majority of the Stan
ford community's only access to the situation
in the Middle East is through CNN, The New

York Times and other American media ser
vices, which unfortunately do not always ad
dress many of the complexities in issues like
the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Bringing
speakers to campus and holding demonstra
tions gives Stanford students diverse per
spectives, allowing them to think more criti
cally about the issue.
We also praise the civility demonstrated in
yesterday's events. Stanford students showed
that they could disagree on heated, political
issues without screaming vulgarities or phys
ically harming each other. This was a far cry
from Berkeley's campus rallies last week,
during which Israeli and Palestinian sup
porters traded fiery accusations and slurs,
leading to the arrest of 79 students.
The destructive nature of Berkeley's rallies

only spread hatred and anger between both
sides. However, if both sides attempt to under
stand the other's opinions in a peaceful manner,
the two communities will be able to move togeth
er towards achieving the peace they both want.
Friday's multi-campus student walkout
and rally "to promote the safety, dignity and
human rights of all people in the Middle
East" at noon in the Oval is another way in
which the Stanford community can learn
about the tragedy in the Middle East. The
way in which the rally is carried out remains
to be seen, but we believe that yesterday's
events serve as an example to tomorrow's.
We applaud these constructive events
and hope more students will use these re
sources to educate themselves about such a
complex conflict.
