# Senate rejects Bush's oil drilling proposal

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€”
The Senate rejected by a wide
margin President George
Bush's plans for oil drilling in an
Arctic wildlife refuge yesterday,
turning aside arguments that
the oil was needed for the na
tion's security.
The vote was a blow to the ad
ministration, which repeatedly
has cited development of the
Alaska refuge's oil as a center
piece of its energy policy.
Environmentalists waged an
intense campaign to protect the
refuge, calling it a unique eco
logical treasure. Drilling sup
porters said their proposal con
tained environmental safe
guards.
While the House already has
approved legislation to allow de
velopment of the oil-saturated
coastal plain of the Arctic Na
tional Wildlife Refuge, the size
of the anti-drilling vote in the
Senate may doom any prospect
fora drilling measure in Con
gress this year.
Senate Republicans fell 14
votes short, 54-46, of the 60
needed to break a Democratic
filibuster and allow a vote on
putting the refuge provision
into a broader energy bill.
Alaska's two senators, who

had led the fight for drilling, ex
pressed disappointment but did
not formally withdraw their
amendment.
"It's not over yet," insisted
Sen. Frank Min kowski, R-Alas
ka. He and Sen. Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska, told reporters they
planned still other amend
ments involving the refuge but
gave no details.
Democrats said the vote set
tles the drilling issue, and Re
publican leader Trent Lott of
Mississippi said he expects the
amendment to be withdrawn so
the Senate can go ahead and
pass an energy bill.
Eight Republicans and Sen.
James Jeffords, the indepen
dent from Vermont, joined
most Democrats in opposing the
drilling measure. Five Democ
rats supported the drilling
amendment, offered by the
Alaska senators.
Stevens blamed the defeat on
senators who succumbed to
pressure from "reactionary,
radical environmentalists" and
ignored the jobs that drilling in
the refuge would produce.
Murkowski said the votes played
into the hands of Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein and other
Middle East oil producers.
