## The 						Stanford Daily Pro fros: look to students for real picture of Stanford 
### 
Published Since J 891

For some prospective freshmen,
Admit Weekend can be a blur. Class
es, parties and orientation-style pro
grams with screaming HoHos and
dancing Dollies rush by, and at the end of the
weekend one might be left with the impres
sion that Stanford is like a summer camp for
hyper-enthusiastic gifted kids.
But the people who get the most out of
Admit Weekend are the ones who step behind
the seemingly endless parade of icebreakers
and five-person informational panels, look
past the balloons and banners, and take time to
learn from the people who really know what
life at Stanford is all about — the students.
It's not that the presentations on different
majors and University resources aren't valu
able, but to choose between elite colleges sole
ly on the basis of the specific programs or op-

portunities they offer would be misguided.
Likewise, it's not as though the students fake
the enthusiasm and school spirit they so
prominently display in the presence of
prospective freshmen, but University life isn't
really a non-stop barrage of Band runs and
fountain-hopping excursions.
At Stanford, as at any top university, there
will be great classes, flashy facilities, caring
professors and numerous resources: The
magnitude and diversity of the University's
resources are enough to accomodate the most
varied of interests. Any upperclassman will
tell you that what has truly defined the Stan
ford experience is not the presence or ab
sence of a given academic or extra-curricular
program, but rather the relationships that
have been forged with fellow students.
Student life is the wild-card, the one thing

that is impossible to get a sense of by reading
the Fiske Guide. Thus, the quality and lit of the
University's social and intellectual atmosphere
is the element that should most concern
prospective freshmen during their stay here
this weekend.
While the peppy chants and dorm rival
ries highlighted in the official Admit Week
end experience can seem silly and artificial,
the real Stanford experience includes every
thing from impromptu room parties and
thought-provoking late-night conversations
to community-service activities and work
er's-rights rallies.
Even with such unique and valuable pro
grams as Stanford Introductory Seminars,
Sophomore College and Undergraduate Re
search Opportunities, the old cliche ap
plies — it's not the work itself, but the interac-

tion with professors and fellow students that
makes the experience special.
For many Stanford students, it is because of
their classmates that they feel overwhelming
ly satisfied with their college choice. Fora few,
no special University-sponsored program or
wonderful resource can change the fact that
they simply don't feel like they belong.
So to all the pro fros who are visiting this
weekend and have yet to make up their
minds: Go out of your way to meet people
other than your HoHos. Ask your RoHo and
your RoHo's roommates about their experi
ences here: what they love about college, what
frustrates them, what they're passionate
about. You're almost guaranteed to learn
things about Stanford that you wouldn't learn
just by following the red-folder-toting herds
from one planned event to the next.
