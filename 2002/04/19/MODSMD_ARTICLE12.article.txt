## Ants take over world! 
### 
This past week has seen some in
teresting news related to "coop
erative units." On Tuesday,
Swiss, French and Danish scien
tists reported discovering a super-colony
of ants spanning 3,600 miles across Eu
rope. Stretching from northwest Spain to
the Italian Riviera, the colony consists of

billions and billions of Ar
gentine ants in millions
and millions of cooperat
ing nests. Some rumors
suggest that there may be
related colonies continu
ing on under the Atlantic
Ocean, across the United
States and into Stanford
bathrooms, but even lim-

iting it to western Europe, the colony is, ac
cording to the researchers, the largest co
operative unit ever discovered.
I assume that researchers mean that it
is the largest cooperative non-human
unit ever discovered, hut maybe not. Just
look elsewhere in Italy. Distracting peo
ple from the swarms of ants, there was a
general strike in the country on Tuesday.
Millions of Italians, unhappy with gov
ernment plans to make firing workers
easier, took to the streets and stayed away
from work.
Most trains did not run, hospitals only
performed emergency procedures, many
foreign airlines cancelled flights and
schools and post offices stayed shut. Actor
Roberto Benigni said to an energetic
crowd of thousands in Rome, "It'sa grand
demonstration. Everything is beautiful."
The main complaint of the workers is
about a plan to eliminate rules — among
the most stringent in Europe — mandat
ing companies to re-employ workers
found to have been fired for "unjust caus
es." While employers and the government
say that high barriers to the termination of
unneeded employees make Italy less com
petitive in the global economy, labor
unions say that the changes would make
the rich richer at the expense of the mass
es and hurt societal harmony.
The Italian economy, like all economies
and nations and the world as a whole, is a
cooperative unit. And its problems sound
very similar to what entomologists foresee
for the 3,600-mile ant colony.
The experts say that in the vast super
colony, many worker ants are unrelated to
the queens whose lives they support. Over
time, natural selection should select
against such selfless behavior by the work
ers because it does not pass on the sup
portive worker ant's genes. Or, in another
way of looking at it, future worker ants will
say, "Hey, Queen, what's in it for me? I'm
out of here!"
Cooperation, in ants or humans, seems
to work only when the parties feel they are
getting something out of the arrange
ment, getting a fair deal.
At present though, the Ant Nation in
Europe seems to be doing just fine even if

the Italians are not. Experts believe Ar
gentine ants were introduced to Europe
only around 1920, possibly by way of ships
transporting plants from elsewhere in the
world. So, in just about 80 years, the ants
have formed a nation larger than many
human countries and with a population
that could be greater than that of all hu
mans. Not bad for one human lifespan.
No wonder so many sources of wis
dom point to the ant. There are Aesop's
fables extolling the virtues of the ant.
Teachers and parents use ant farms as
lessons. And the Old Testament says, "Go
to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her
ways, and be wise."
We sluggards have a lot to learn from
ants, but our cooperation is fairly remark
able too. There are always signs popping
up .that make it seem like societal coopera
tion is on the verge of falling apart, but
there are also always enough good people
who were trained well in kindergarten or
its equivalent and keep at least some coop
eration going.
Each of us barely knows anything and
can barely do anything, yet our lifestyles
make us look like people who know it all
and can do it all. Capitalism is not the an
tithesis of cooperation, but a roundabout
way of effecting it.
If we didn't cooperate, how would we
eat without gathering food ourselves? Or
get sickness cured? Or have shelter with
out lifting a brick? Or develop a treatment
for facial wrinkles (just approved by the
Food and Drug Administration) that in
volves injecting into the face the toxin that
causes botulism?
Of course, on the other hand, "Non-co
operation with evil is as much a duty as is
cooperation with good," as Mahatma
Gandhi said. And we have plenty of evil
with which to not cooperate.
The ants, genetically related, do not
fight with other members of the colony,
even ones thousands of miles away, but do
fight fiercely with non-member ants.
So, you see, we humans have no choice
but to cooperate. Because of our coopera
tion with each other, we have learned that
the Ant Nation has taken much of Europe.
The indigenous ant populations have
already been decimated, and the super
colony may well take advantage of labor
instability in Italy to take that nation's gov
ernment. France and Spain would doubt
less soon follow. Just one thing stands be
tween them and domination: There is an
other Argentine ant supercolony in
Spain's Catalonia region, and when ants of
the two colonies are put together, they
fight to the death.
Ants really are verv similar to humans.
