Physicist's talk actually a
'brainwashing session'
Tuesday night, I attended the talk enti
tled " The big bang, Stephen Hawking,
and God," given by Dr. Henry Schaefer,
hoping to glean some insights into the
conflict between science and religion. Un
fortunately, I did not notice the miniscule
print on the flyer, which indicated that the
talk was sponsored by the Campus Cru
sade for Christ. It was not until I had taken
my seat in a packed Kresge Auditorium
that 1 became aware of this fact; neverthe
less, I still expected and hoped fora
thoughtful lecture on real issues.
Things started off harmlessly enough,
discussing the basics of modern physics
and the Big Bang, but soon deteriorated
as Schaefer, a prominent quantum
chemist, began to supplement his theoret
ical assertions with quotes from famous
physicists, including Stephen Hawking,
regarding their beliefs on a divine order
or a supreme being. I bis theological di
gression continued until we had com
pletely escaped the realm of physics, and
culminated when Schaefer delivered a
manifesto about finding "one's own per
sonal relationship with Jesus Christ'. After
the talk, members of the group were pass
ing out forms and encouraging attendees
to ask them questions about religion.
I would never criticize the right of a
group to try and attract members or fur
ther its agenda, but certainly this is not the
way to go about doing it. To bill an event
as a legitimate scientific talk, when in ac tu
ality it was a proselytizing and brainwash
ing session, is both extremely misleading
and highly immoral. The ideas put forth

in the speech were intended to confuse as
well as beguile, and in many cases the
quotes were originally intended as flip
pant remarks or taken out of context.
What could have been a very interest
ing exposition on how science and reli
gion intermesh in the modern age quietly
and deceptively mutated into sermoniz
ing. In the future, I sincerely hope that
events such as these will be advertised as
what they are, rather than presenting a
facade with the intent of luring in poten
tial converts.

Students for Palestine demonstration a
protest, not a counter-protest
One minor correction to Ali Alemoza
far's otherwise able coverage of Wednes
day's celebration (with food and music) of
Israel's Independence Day. On two occa
sions, Alemozafar refers to a "counter
protest" organized by the Students for
Palestine. Since the students celebrating
Israel's Independence Day were not
protesting, the response by Students for
Palestine is more appropriately termed a
"protest," rather than a "counter-protest."

New creamery not front-page material
I was delighted to see that your head
line story this Wednesday featured the
opening of a Cold Stone Creamery fran

chise in the Town and Country Village ("A
new place to chill: Cold Stone Creamery
opens").
It's extraordinarily fortunate that we
have a newspaper committed to un
earthing the tastiest treats in the greater
Palo Alto region. I've heard there's a
Starbucks not far down the road. Perhaps
your crack team of news professionals
could let us know in advance just how de
licious the new mocha frappucino is —
after all, those of us without cable might
miss their television ads.
I n fact, why don't we bypass the report
ing process altogether and plaster page
one with coupons to Pizza my Heart and
Jing-Jing? I would certainly "rejoice" in
that change.
Sarcasm aside, I know there are
enough newsworthy stories out there to
keep a shameless public-relations piece,
which might as well have come out of a
corporate marketing office, off the top
corner of the front page. In fact, you had
better material just inches away: why not
give "Seniors stressed out over job search"
prime real estate? Or are Stanford stu
dents more interested in a "completely
customized ice cream product" than full
time employment?
Granted, food and entertainment
pieces have their place in a news daily, but
in the appropriate sections. "A new place
to chill'' doesn't even pass muster as a
restaurant review. I'm sure the Cold
Stone Creamery serves delicious ice
cream, but it's up to the proprietors to let
us know. Infotainment should be relegat
ed to Intermission.
