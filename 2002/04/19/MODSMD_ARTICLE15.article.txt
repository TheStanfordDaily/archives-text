# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Celebrating springtime in a world of crumbling illusions 
### PETER STAIR GUEST COLUMNIST 
Ah, spring! The time we realize that
things don't have to be the way they were
during the winter. We're ready to open
our windows and doors, and to explore
the world outside our home more often.
We're ready to open our eyes and mouths,
and to connect with people more often.
Seasons change, and we change plans.
Especially this spring, I'm ready. Because
we have just experienced a winter of de
spair deeper than any I remember.
Not only the leaves fell this autumn, the
World Trade Center and bombs fell with
them. Not only did snow and rain fall this
winter, illusions did too.
Corporations really aren't as valuable as
the accountants have claimed. Advertisers
really are willing to exploit anything, in
cluding wartime patriotism, in order to get

us to buy their products. And our economy
really does depend on us borrowing money
in order to buy more and more frivolous
products and services. Politicians really are
willing to give retroactive tax cuts to wealthy
corporations before giving aid to their fired
employees. Our constitutional rights really
aren't as sacred as they seemed. Catholic
priests really are engaging in widespread
pedophilia and denial. What happens in Is
rael, Afghanistan and Pakistan really does
matter to our lives. And nuclear war really
is a serious possibility.
It's not fun to realize that you live in a
world with not only weather forecasts, but
also traffic forecasts, air-quality forecasts
and, now, color-coded terrorism forecasts.
It's not fun to live in a world where an in
creasing number of people are both able to
start global war and willing to die in order
to foment such a religiously apocalyptic
scenario. And it's overwhelming when we

start thinking about practical solutions, be
cause they dredge up doubts we may al
ready have had about our society. Are we
falsely assuming that we can suck more and
more resources our way forever, with the
continued consent of the people and
ecosystems we're using for support?
Paying attention to our circumstances
but not thinking broadly about how to
deal with them, "bundling up," is a good
way to get through the winter. But seasons
change, and we change plans.
It's spring now. Instead of decaying, the
plants spontaneously sprout and blossom.
Instead of hibernating, the animals come
out to spontaneously play and mate. The
humans can play and create new things too.
We live in a different context than those
who came before us, and we will have a dif
ferent analysis. We wear clothes from In
donesia and live among billions of people.
We wear watches and think in terms of

minutes. We're coming to understand the
intelligence that lies in connections: net
works, brains, societies and ecosystems.
We understand how we can influence
each other as we make decisions, and how
our decisions influence those of people
both around the world and in the future.
When the sun is out and the people are
laughing, and life is good, we are more
willing to act with care for others. We're
privileged students with the time to think
about people in the third world and in fu
ture generations. And we're intelligent
enough to realize that we can do some
thing for them, probably even starting
with what we do on campus today.
We live in a learning community,
where we can experiment with each other.
We can experiment with creating new pos
sibilities for community. If we want people
to be more kind to each other, we can
make eve contact with more of those we

pass. If we want people to be more consid
erate of future generations, we can leave
the bathroom cleaner than it was when we
entered. If we're tired of being lied to, or
fed formulaic entertainment, we can be
vulnerably honest with each other.
If we think tribalism isn't a good strate
gy anymore, we can try reaching out to
people in other social groups on this cam
pus. If we think romance is under-valued
or over-cliched, we can try developing
something really beautiful and real with
someone. Maybe it will stay small, or maybe
something much bigger and more exciting
will blossom.
If we wanted it to be, this could be the
most rewarding spring of our life.
