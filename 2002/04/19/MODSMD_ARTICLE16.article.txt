### KATRINA LAKE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Flash back to the Stanford men's
volleyball team's first conference
matches of the season. After long
hours of travel, the Cardinal arrived
in Provo, Utah, to face defending
national champion Brigham Young
fora pair of matches.

MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
Saturday: No. 5 Stanford vs.
No. 4 BYU, MPSF Tournament first
round, 7:00 p.m., Provo, Utah

Over 8,000 fans piled into
Smith Fieldhouse for the Cougars'
season-opening matches, filling
the arena with pounding, yelling
and heckling and creating a less
than-ideal atmosphere for the
Stanford squad.
Despite the challenge present
ed by the rowdy crowds, impres
sive performances allowed Stan
ford to split the matches, with the
Cardinal winning on Jan. 11, 3-1,
and falling on Jan. 12, 2-3.
Stanford (16-9, 15-7 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) must
now return to Provo for the first
round of the MPSF tournament,
as the fifth-seeded Cardinal will
face fourth-seeded BYU (22-6, 16-
6) on Saturday.
"It's a whole different story
when we play elsewhere," said
coach Don Shaw. "Crowds like
those at BYU tend to be rowdy,
merciless hecklers."
Since those first matches of the
season, the BYU team has had an
impressive season.
Last weekend, the Cougars, who

have not had a losing streak of more
than two games for over five years,
split a pair of matches with No. 2
Hawaii. The one win secured home
court advantage for the Cougars in
the MPSF tournament.
The Cardinal can easily rival the
Cougars in talent, but the team suf
fers in consistency. The Stanford
squad that upset then-No. 1 UCLA
earlier in the season also fell victim
to a six-game losing streak against a
number of low-ranked teams.
Stanford had hoped for dual vic
tories last weekend, which would
have gained it home-court advan
tage for this weekend's first round.
More importantly, with a trip to
BYU looming, two wins would
have allowed Stanford to avoid a se
vere away-court disadvantage.
Last Friday, the Cardinal put
Southern California (6-22, 3-19)
down with ease. But on Saturday,
Stanford fell to top-ranked Pepper
dine (25-4, 20-2) in four games to
wrap up the regular season, earn
ing it a set of plane tickets to Utah.
Stanford only gets one shot
against the Cougars on Saturday.
"The bottom line is we're going
to have to go out and play really
well," Shaw said.

With the MPSF tournament giv
ing a number of teams their only
shot at an NCAA tournament bid,
the level of competition and hype
surrounding this weekend's play is
reminiscent of that usually reserved
for national tournaments.
The MPSF boasts 10 of the top
15 teams in the country, and the
top eight will fight for the confer
ence championship over the next
two weekends.
Only two teams from the MSPF
can qualify for the NCAA tourna
ment. The team that wins the con
ference tournament is guaranteed
a bid, and the one at-large bid will
be given to team on the basis of
record and performance of the
past year.
At 16-9, Stanford is not a likely
candidate for the at-large bid, rest
ing all of the Cardinal's NCAA
hopes on its play on Saturday.
Last year, Cardinal hopes fora
conference championship and
subsequent national tournament
bid disappeared when Stanford
fell to UCLA in a close five-game
first-round matchup. The Cardi
nal has not won a post-season
match since its 1997 national
championship season.
