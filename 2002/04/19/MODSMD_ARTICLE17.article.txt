this weekend.
Arizona is hitting .327 at the plate, led by Lovieanne
Jung, who boasts a .421 average in the box. But die of
fensive powerhouse of last year's championship team is
much more dependent on veteran senior pitcher Jen
nie Finch.
The Ail-American currently boasts a 22-1 record
with a 0.68 ERA and has picked up an impressive 230
strikeouts this season.
The Cardinal will do all it can this weekend not
only to change these numbers, but also to show that
there is little distance between the No. 1 and No. 3
teams in the nation.
Seniors center fielder Jessica Mendoza and first base
man Sarah Beeson will lead the Stanford attack at the
plate. Mendoza is currendy batting an incredible .426
with 55 hits and 12 home runs, while Beeson is averag
ing .409 with 52 hits and 74 total bases.
Senior shortstop Robin Walker and junior sec
ond baseman Kira Ching will also try to rattle Finch
at the plate. Both are currently hitting over .300
and have proven to be clutch hitters for the Cardi
nal this season.
Following the Friday night game, Stanford will
take on Arizona State on Saturday and Sunday.
Arizona State went 2-1 against die Oregon schools
last weekend, defeating Oregon 9-1 and splitting with
Oregon State, 0-1 and 6-0.
Arizona State is led offensively by Phelan Wright,
who is averaging .443 at the plate with 54 hits and 31
RBI. Following closely is Kara Brun, who is batting .419
with 57 hits and 44 RBI. As a team, die Sun Devils are
hitting at an impressive .316 clip.
The Cardinal will again rely on its strong pitch
ing staff, led by starting juniors Tori Nyberg and
Maureen LeCocq, to shut down the strong Wildcat
and Sun Devil lineups. The two have helped Stan
ford hold its opponents to just a .219 batting aver
age and only 89 runs this season.
Tonight's game is the third of a nine-game
homestand for Stanford, which will look to improve
on its surprisingly slow 4-5 start in conference play.
