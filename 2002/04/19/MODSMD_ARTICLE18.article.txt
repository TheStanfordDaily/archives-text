# Martin, Lipsky form unlikely pair for Cardinal

### JIMMY WU STAFF WRITER 
Could the following two personali
ties ever mesh on the tennis court?
Player one hails from Tulsa, Okla.,
and has a laid-back nature. Teammates
call him "moral," evidenced by his win
ning a handful of Sportsmanship
Awards in his career. He has all the
right shots for the solid all-around ten
nis player.

Player two comes from Merrick,
N.Y., and possesses a more fiery per
sonality on the court. He tends to yell
negative c6mments to himself during
play, and while owning a solid game as
well, he is also a master of the unortho
dox shot.
On first glance, just having the no
tion of pairing up these players in
matches would seem an act of insanity.
But player one is Stanford junior
David Martin and player two is junior
Scott Lipsky, and together they form
one of the most dangerous doubles
pairs in collegiate tennis.
Both parbof the strong four-man re
cruiting class of 1999, Martin and Lip
sky began to make a name for them
selves last year. Since then, they have
compiled a 64-16 record, reached the

semifinals of the NCAA Doubles Cham
pionships, won the National Collegiate
Tennis Classic Doubles Champi
onships and claimed the ITA Northern
California Regional Championships.
Even with their respective yin and
yang qualities, they have managed to
find a "happy medium," and learned
how to be successful with the abilities
they possess.
"Dave keeps me in line," Lipsky said.
"1 tend to get more negative than him
on the court, and 1 think we comple
ment each other on the court that way.
He's the more positive, moral guy, while
I'm the more emotional guy who gets
into arguments with the umpire or op
ponent. He just tries to keep me calm."
Martin agreed with the assessment.
"Scott keeps me loose out there,"
Martin said. "He says negative dry
things that are funny. Sometimes it gets
annoying and I get real pissed, but for
the most part, it's pretty funny."
Fittingly, the two attribute their suc
cess to a shared belief that having a bal
anced mentality is more effective than
being too pumped up or too mellow on
the court.
Their mixed dynamic is well evi
denced by their interactions after win
ning points. According to the two, they
talk about everything except the match
itself, ranging from comments about
the crowd to quips about how badly
head coach Dick Gould needs an Altoid.
Associate head coach John
Whitlinger acknowledged the visible
differences in the two players' person
alities, but said he believed that the di-
