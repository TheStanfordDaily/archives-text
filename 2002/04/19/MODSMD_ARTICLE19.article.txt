Golfers often speak of "members' bounces"
on the fairway, and the "home course roll" on the
greens as euphemisms for the g(x>d fortune one
sometimes gets on his home course. A talented
Cardinal squad wouldn't mind a little local luck
this weekend, as 16 other schools come to the
Stanford Golf Course for what will likely be an
extremely competitive U.S. Intercollegiate this

Saturday and Sunday.
The Cardinal is looking not only to play well
on its own turf, but also to make a statement to
the NCAA selection committee. It's been a mixed
season for Stanford, but one that still has tremen
dous potential if a few important putts fall the
right way.
"Number one, 1 think this is an extremely im-

portant tournament for us. As a bubble team for
the NGAAs, for us to get to regionals we have to
have a pretty high finish here this weekend,"
Coach Jeff Mitchell said.
Stanford will be hoping to improve from
last year's Intercollegiate, where it finished a
strong fifth.
Senior Philip Rowe will be in
strumental in moving the home
team up the leaderboard. After
tying for 14th last year with a
one-over 214, just eight shots
back of the winning score, he is
posting numbers this year that
will demand postseason awards.
"Phil Rowe [has had] another
stellar year," Mitchell said. "[He]
played in nine tournaments and
turned in four top-10s and six top
20s. Definitely first or second team
All-Conference, and on top of that,
All-Conference Academic."
Junior Jim Seki also comes back
to California riding a hot streak out
of the desert, coming off of a sev
enth-place finish in Arizona at last
weekend's ASLI Thunderbird / SA
VANE Invitational.
"He's been playing really good
golf," Mitchell said.
The remaining members of the

squad are dangerous as well, with
sophomore Blake Mastalir bring
ing the experience of four top-20
finishes this year with him to his
home course.
Competition begins with a shot
gun start at 8:00 a.m. on both Sat
urday and Sunday. Saturday in
volves 36 holes of play, while Sun
day will conclude with one round of
18 holes.
The women's team finished up
its regular season last weekend,
posting its fifth top-10 finish of the
year at the Peg Barnard Classic at
the Stanford Golf Course.
This weekend it travels to
Walla Walla, Wash., to prepare
for the Pacific 10 Conference
Women's Golf Championships.
After a practice round on Sun
day, the tournament will begin
early Monday morning.
Currently seeded seventh, the
six golfers representing the Car
dinal head into the tournament
looking to improve on last year's
Pac-10 Championships, where
they finished second to Arizona.
