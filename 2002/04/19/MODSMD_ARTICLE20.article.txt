SEATTLE — The sun has
certainly been shining on the
No. 2 Cardinal this season, so
why shouldn't it continue to do
so as Stanford enters its third
weekend of Pacific 10 Confer
ence play?

BASEBALL
Tonight: No. 2 Stanford vs.
Washington, 6:30 p.m., Seattle
Saturday: No. 2 Stanford vs.
Washington, 1:00 p.m., Seattle
Sunday: No. 2 Stanford vs.
Washington, 1:00 p.m., Seattle

Because the team is going to
Seattle, of course.
In the rainy Northwest, the
Cardinal (26-8, 4-2 Pac-10) will
take on a Washington team that
has struggled as of late, losing 10
of its last 13 ballgames.
Stanford, by contrast, has
emerged victorious in eight of 10
and sits just one game back of
league-leading Arizona State (24-
13, 8-4) in the Pac-10 race while
holding the all-important advan
tage in the loss column.
The Huskies (15-18-1, 3-3),
though, will do their best to
avenge last year's Cardinal sweep
at Sunken Diamond.
Talented senior right-hander
Shawn Kohn will take the
mound tonight , hoping to put an
end to Stanford junior Jeremy
Guthrie's personal 11-game win
ning streak.
Both of tonight's starters boast
comparable numbers and strik
ingly similar styles, relying on
solid control and stamina for
outs. In 2002, Kohn has aver
aged 7 2/3 innings per start and
walked just 13 batters to
Guthrie's 7 1/3 average and 18
walks. The Cardinal hurler holds
the edge in strikeouts, 66 to 50.

Last season, Guthrie held the
Huskies to three runs in eight in
nings, striking out nine at
Sunken Diamond.
With such an even matchup
on the hill, the difference
tonight could be the batters in
the box rather than the arms
they're facing.
Led by last week's National
Player of the Week, junior Jason
Cooper, the Cardinal offense has
put up double-digit runs on the
scoreboard in five of its past seven
games. Cooper has been on a
personal tear, hitting four home
runs and driving in 10 in four
games last week.
The Huskies have amassed a
.309 team batting average that is
almost 20 points below the Cardi
nal's. It's doubtful that Washing
ton's batters can keep up with a
Stanford lineup that has been ex
plosive entering the heart of the
conference season.
The Cardinal should find hits
and runs easier to come by as it
battles against the Pac-10's sec
ond-most generous pitching
staff. Even with Kohn's superb
performances, the Huskies' 6.31
team ERA spells likely success for
Stanford hitting.
Junior Tim Cunningham will
take the ball tomorrow for the
Cardinal with redemption on his
mind. The lefty, who had been
enjoying a phenomenal year as
the team's second starter, retired
just three of the 14 batters he
faced last Saturday against
Southern California while sur
rendering nine runs on eight
hits. His opponent, junior John
White, has gone 3-2 with a bloat
ed 6.07 ERA this season.
On Sunday, sophomore John
Hudgins will look to keep his
perfect 6-0 record intact as he
faces sophomore Clay Johnson.
Johnson, who is just 1-1 in seven
starts with an 8.65 ERA, figures
to have a rough afternoon
against the Stanford order.
