## 
### KIM ROBERTS STAFF WRITER 
Since losing a conference

March 30, the No. 2 Stanford
women's water polo team (18-1,
9-1 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) has rebounded in
grand fashion, sweeping five
straight MPSF games.

vs. No. 7 San Jose State,
noon, San Jose

This Saturday, the Cardinal
will look to continue on this win
ning path and end its regular
season on a good note as it trav
els to take on San Jose State (17-
9,5-5) in what is possibly its most
crucial game of the season.
Currently, Stanford, No. 1
UCLA and No. 2 USC all have
the same record in MPSF play.
And each has beaten one of the
other two, with Stanford defeat
ing UCLA, UCLA beating USC
and USC downing the Cardinal.
Due to this three-way tie, the
MPSF standings are currently
based on goal differentials.
Stanford stands in first place,
one goal up on the Trojans,
while the Bruins are one goal
behind USC.
Saturday's game against San
Jose State will determine the
Cardinal's seed entering the
crucial MPSF tournament,
which decides the recipient of
the conference's automatic bid
to the NCAA tournament.
"If we win this game we'll be
ranked No. 1 entering the
MPSF tournament," senior two
meter defender Kate Petit said.
"This game is very important in
that respect because we need to
secure our seed. Losing the San

Jose [State] game would put us
in a bad'position not only for
MPSFs, but also for the [one] at
large bid to the NCAAs."
Two days after the Cardinal
triumphed over California last
Friday, the Spartans fell to the
Golden Bears, 9-4, on Sunday.
However, San Jose State had
been on a three-game winning
streak before meeting Cal, post
ing wins over UC-San Diego, Cal
State-Hayward and UC-lrvine.
"San Jose Suite is a really solid
team that will definitely chal
lenge us," Petit said. "We'll have
to work together and play the
way that we've played all season
in order to be successful.
They've challenged us in the
past, and they think that they
can play with us, which will
make them excited and ready to
play hard."
Stanford, which has
outscored opponents, 63-13, in
the first quarter this season, will
look to stifle San Jose State from
the suirt.
lhe Cardinal's dominance
has not been limited to the
opening period, as it has a 199-
67 scoring differential in its 19
games this year.
Leading the Stanford attack is
sophomore driver Brenda Villa,
who has 48 goals and has tallied
two four-goal performances.
"We're coming into this game
the way we go into every other
game," Villa said. "In practice,
we've been working on getting
back to our defense and playing
it our way, as opposed to chang
ing our style to match the team
we're playing. We're going back
to our system, which is what
we'll need to do down the road
in order to win."
