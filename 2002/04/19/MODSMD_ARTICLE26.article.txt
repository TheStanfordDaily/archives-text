The frequent flier miles are starting to add up.
On Wednesday the Stanford women's
lacrosse team left for its second East Coast trip to
compete against Boston College on Friday and
No. 20 New I lampshire on Sunday.
Stanford is fired up after its strong perfor
mances this past weekend, when it decisively
beat California, 10-4, on Friday night and
knocked off Denver, 14-7, on Sunday.
The Cardinal stands at 6-6 on the season
and is riding a three-game winning streak. It
is now 6-o.in the Mountain Pacific Lacrosse
League and remains the only undefeated
team in the conference.
Stanford will put its streak on the line against
a pair of talented squads.
Boston College (7-6) has faced some stiff com
petition this year, including No. 2 Georgetown,
but has managed to stay above .500 on the year.
New Hampshire has won six of its last seven
and is holding on to its first national ranking

"We're really excited to get some more East
Coast competition," said sophomore attacker
Jess Scott. "We've come a long way the past cou
ple weeks, and it'll awesome to put into action all
the stuff we've learned."
The past two games against Denver and Cal
demonstrated Stanford's ability to control the
tempo of the game.
The games were also turning points in bring
ing the defense, midfield and offense together.
Settled offense and midfield transition were
problems for the Cardinal earlier the season, but
both are now strong components of the team.
"We're really starting to work as a cohesive
unit, which makes for some beautiful lacrosse,"
said sophomore defender Larissa Conte.

Injury and sickness have recently been
haunting the team, but Stanford has still man
aged to maintain a high level of play.
Starting, sophomore defender Katie Grube
has been out due to illness, but the defense has
performed at a consistently high level despite
losing a key player.
"The team as a whole adjusts and compen
sates really well to unexpected illnesses or in
juries," Grube said. "We now really work as a
unit as opposed to individual players."
The Cardinal's season has not produced the
results it has hoped for in terms of rankings, but
the team has already built a strong foundation
for next year.
Still, with tough competition still looming for
this weekend and the rest of the season, the
Stanford squad still has a lot of fight left in it.
"While being ranked in the top 20 right now
is unlikely, there is a lot of the season left," coach
Michele Uhlfelder said. "We have seen a lot of
parity this year among teams, so until the NCAA
rankings comes out, it is yet to be determined
how our strength of schedule would help us."
