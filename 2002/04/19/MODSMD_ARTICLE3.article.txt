# Pro fros share impressions of life at Stanford
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Is Stanford really as diverse as
the brochures claim? Is college all
about academics? Are Stanford
students really better looking than
those at other schools? These are
some of the questions prospective
freshmen will ask this weekend
when they tour the campus for the
first time as admitted students.
The impressions that are
formed this weekend have serious
consequences for them and the
University — and everyone wants
to put their best foot forward.
But what matters to the poten
tial class of 2006? To find out, The
Daily has followed two students
from their hometowns to the Farm
— check back Monday for how
our students survived their first
weekend at Stanford.
Stanford would be 'good
preparation'
Jennifer Huang, a 17-year-old
from Orange, Calif., arrived at
Stanford last night. A regular-deci
sion applicant, she recalled her ini
tial excitement upon learning that
she had been admitted.
"I was waiting and waiting,"
Huang said. "I was waiting to hear
the postman stop by; finally, my
mom came home and there was a

big envelope. She said 'Guess what
Jennifer, the mail came..l was to
tally thrilled. I jumped up and
down and called all my friends."
Huang said she is not certain
what college's admission offer she
will accept.
"[Stanford] is probably my top
[choice]. I am also considering
UCLA or Berkeley, but it is proba
bly first," Huang said.
Huang explained how Stanford
made sense in relation to her goal
to go to medical school.

"I am interested in biology or
premed. Stanford is good at the
sciences," she said. "I think it
would be good preparation.
Hopefully it would challenge me
but not be too awful that 1 wouldn't
enjoy it."
Huang said a number of other
students from her high school sub
mitted applications as well.
"From what I've heard, a ton of
people applied to Stanford from

day of Admit Weekend.
my school," Huang said. "It is their
dream school, especially since it is
in California. Everyone applies to
Stanford."
She said she hoped to benefit in
many ways from the academic ex
perience at college.
"I hope that it will be a strong
foundation for the rest of my life,"
Huang said. "I hope it will be a
place where people will be excited
about learning, not just a place
where people take classes because
they have to."
Huang hopes her professors
would make the learning process
fun and productive.
"Hopefully a professor would be
hands-on and will be excited about
the subject," Huang said. "Stanford
is cutting edge research-wise, so
hopefully it will not just be learning
knowledge, but participating in the
process of creating knowledge."
She said that she also wants to
have a different social experience in
college than she had in high school.
"One thing about my high school
is that it is a magnet school," Huang
said. "Everyone lives far away, there
is not much social life since it is hard
for people to get together."
Huang said she thinks she
might appreciate the diversity
Stanford might offer.
"I don't want to just hang out
with Asian-Americans," Huang
said. "I want to check out the Chris

tian fellowships, I just want to look,
around and see the campus as it is,
see what it would be like to be a stu
dent here, see if it is somewhere
that 1 want to sink $ 160,000 into."
As for what she hopes to ac
complish over Admit Weekend,
Huang said that she wishes to get
to know the school better as a
whole.
"I don't usually fall in love with
the buildings or the architecture,
but 1 am waiting to meet the peo
ple," she said. "I hear the food is
good. I have heard it is very safe.
What is cool is that the people that
I have talked to here really love it."
'The people here seem really
friendly'
Arden Pennell, 17, arrived last
night from New York City. Since
she was accepted under the early
decision program, Pennell is
bound to matriculate at Stanford
next year.
Like Huang, Pennell was
thrilled when she heard about her
admissions decision.
"My letter still had not come on
Dec. 18, so I called up Stanford and
the woman on the phone said,
'Congratulations,'" she said. "I
started screaming ... a week later
on Dec. 22 my congratulatory let
ter came in the mail. I was ex
tremely joyful; I was very sur
prised. I didn't expect to get in."
Pennell explained how her fel
low high school students view
Stanford.
"They think it is really laid back
and pretty," she said. "They also

say people are better looking here
than Harvard or Yale or the other
New England Ivies."
As fora potential major, Pen
nell, like most prospective fresh
men, is still undecided.
"I know that I don't want to
study math or science, but that had
no influence on choosing Stan
ford. I want to be there because it
is beautiful," she said.
Pennell said she hopes to branch
out from the limited curriculum
her high school had to offer.
"I want to learn about new
things and take classes in areas
that I haven't taken classes in be
fore," Pennell said. " This will give
me the opportunity, because in
my high school there weren't a lot
of choices."
She said that she hopes to meet
new people over Admit Weekend.
"I am not interested in meet
ing a lot of new and different
people; there is a lot of diversity
already in New York. But the
people here seem really friend
ly, so that is good."
Pennell said that she would also
like to explore the campus and get an
idea of where everything is situated.
"I hope to get know to the cam
pus better because it is really
large," Pennell said.
Both Huang and Pennell said
they are looking forward to the
upcoming activities of Admit
Weekend.
"I hope it is an experience to
learn about who I am and my iden
tity and to get to know other peo
ple," Huang said.

pus better because it is really
large," Pennell said.
Both Huang and Pennell said
they are looking forward to the
upcoming activities of Admit
Weekend.
"I hope it is an experience to
learn about who I am and my iden
tity and to get to know other peo
ple," Huang said.
Is Stanford really as diverse as
the brochures claim? Is college all
about academics? Are Stanford
students really better looking than
those at other schools? These are
some of the questions prospective
freshmen will ask this weekend
when they tour the campus for the
first time as admitted students.
The impressions that are
formed this weekend have serious
consequences for them and the
University — and everyone wants
to put their best foot forward.
But what matters to the poten
tial class of 2006? To find out, The
Daily has followed two students
from their hometowns to the Farm
— check back Monday for how
our students survived their first
weekend at Stanford.
Stanford would be 'good
preparation'
Jennifer Huang, a 17-year-old
from Orange, Calif., arrived at
Stanford last night. A regular-deci
sion applicant, she recalled her ini
tial excitement upon learning that
she had been admitted.
"I was waiting and waiting,"
Huang said. "I was waiting to hear
the postman stop by; finally, my
mom came home and there was a

big envelope. She said 'Guess what
Jennifer, the mail came..l was to
tally thrilled. I jumped up and
down and called all my friends."
Huang said she is not certain
what college's admission offer she
will accept.
"[Stanford] is probably my top
[choice]. I am also considering
UCLA or Berkeley, but it is proba
bly first," Huang said.
Huang explained how Stanford
made sense in relation to her goal
to go to medical school.

"I am interested in biology or
premed. Stanford is good at the
sciences," she said. "I think it
would be good preparation.
Hopefully it would challenge me
but not be too awful that 1 wouldn't
enjoy it."
Huang said a number of other
students from her high school sub
mitted applications as well.
"From what I've heard, a ton of
people applied to Stanford from

my school," Huang said. "It is their
dream school, especially since it is
in California. Everyone applies to
Stanford."
She said she hoped to benefit in
many ways from the academic ex
perience at college.
"I hope that it will be a strong
foundation for the rest of my life,"
Huang said. "I hope it will be a
place where people will be excited
about learning, not just a place
where people take classes because
they have to."
Huang hopes her professors
would make the learning process
fun and productive.
"Hopefully a professor would be
hands-on and will be excited about
the subject," Huang said. "Stanford
is cutting edge research-wise, so
hopefully it will not just be learning
knowledge, but participating in the
process of creating knowledge."
She said that she also wants to
have a different social experience in
college than she had in high school.
"One thing about my high school
is that it is a magnet school," Huang
said. "Everyone lives far away, there
is not much social life since it is hard
for people to get together."
Huang said she thinks she
might appreciate the diversity
Stanford might offer.
"I don't want to just hang out
with Asian-Americans," Huang
said. "I want to check out the Chris

tian fellowships, I just want to look,
around and see the campus as it is,
see what it would be like to be a stu
dent here, see if it is somewhere
that 1 want to sink $ 160,000 into."
As for what she hopes to ac
complish over Admit Weekend,
Huang said that she wishes to get
to know the school better as a
whole.
"I don't usually fall in love with
the buildings or the architecture,
but 1 am waiting to meet the peo
ple," she said. "I hear the food is
good. I have heard it is very safe.
What is cool is that the people that
I have talked to here really love it."
'The people here seem really
friendly'
Arden Pennell, 17, arrived last
night from New York City. Since
she was accepted under the early
decision program, Pennell is
bound to matriculate at Stanford
next year.
Like Huang, Pennell was
thrilled when she heard about her
admissions decision.
"My letter still had not come on
Dec. 18, so I called up Stanford and
the woman on the phone said,
'Congratulations,'" she said. "I
started screaming ... a week later
on Dec. 22 my congratulatory let
ter came in the mail. I was ex
tremely joyful; I was very sur
prised. I didn't expect to get in."
Pennell explained how her fel
low high school students view
Stanford.
"They think it is really laid back
and pretty," she said. "They also

say people are better looking here
than Harvard or Yale or the other
New England Ivies."
As fora potential major, Pen
nell, like most prospective fresh
men, is still undecided.
"I know that I don't want to
study math or science, but that had
no influence on choosing Stan
ford. I want to be there because it
is beautiful," she said.
Pennell said she hopes to branch
out from the limited curriculum
her high school had to offer.
"I want to learn about new
things and take classes in areas
that I haven't taken classes in be
fore," Pennell said. " This will give
me the opportunity, because in
my high school there weren't a lot
of choices."
She said that she hopes to meet
new people over Admit Weekend.
"I am not interested in meet
ing a lot of new and different
people; there is a lot of diversity
already in New York. But the
people here seem really friend
ly, so that is good."
Pennell said that she would also
like to explore the campus and get an
idea of where everything is situated.
"I hope to get know to the cam
pus better because it is really
large," Pennell said.
Both Huang and Pennell said
they are looking forward to the
upcoming activities of Admit
Weekend.

learn about who I am and my iden
tity and to get to know other peo
