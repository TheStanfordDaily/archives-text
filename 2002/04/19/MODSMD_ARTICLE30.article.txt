"The Sweetest Thing,"
the new Cameron Diaz
flick directed by Roger
Kumble, touts itself as "a
romantic comedy without
the sugar." However, with
all its trite male-bashing,
"Oil, honey, he's not good

enough for you" girl-talk, exaggerated slap
stick comedy and sickeningly sweet jokes tar
geted toward some sort of mythical Cosmo
girl subculture of an audience, 1 nearly
choked on my Raisinets while watching this
film. Viewing "The Sweetest Thing"
made me feel as if I were trapped inside
some horrifying, real-life version of a
raunchy issue of Cosmopolitan — I cringed
as 1 watched these girls (who call each other
"sweetie") teetering about skittishly on stilet
tos and wearing one-shoulder crop tops, gig
gling and flailing about on the dance fl(x>r as
if they gulped down a few t<x> many uppers
with their apple tartinis.
The film tries hard to play on Cameron
Diaz's past character successes in "Charlie's
Angels" and "There's Something About
Mary" and to recreate the sexually-for
ward female camaraderie of HBO's "Sex
and the City." Unfortunately, the film ends
up tripping on its own Prada heels and
flopping miserably.

["The Sweetest
Thing"
Dir. Roger Kumble
Columbia Pictures
irCrCrCrCi -

Christina (Cameron Diaz) is a hyperac
tive, ditzy heartbreaker who does not look

for "Mr. Right," but for
"Mr. Right-Now." She
and Courtney, (Christi
na Applegate), her best
friend — a relation
ship symbolized per
haps by the ladies'
identical long blond

haircuts — drag their friend Jane (Selma
Blair) to a dance club to help her forget
about the fiancee who has just dumped her.
On the dance floor, Christina meets and
subsequently argues with Peter (Thomas
Jane), who, within 30 seconds, somehow
seems to peg Christina's commitment issues
with men. With the quick close-up of Diaz's
face following this encounter, it is clear that
Peter has struck a nerve and that Christina
likes him. However, the camera approach is
so obvious and deliberate that it comes off as
fake. Regardless, this meeting spurs a spon
taneous road trip as the girls seek out Peter
at his brother's wedding.
On a recent "Conan" interview, Christina
Applegate alluded to the idea that "The
Sweetest Thing" is supposed to showcase a
liberating role for women, one in which they
are carefree, wild and "potty-mouthed" just
like men.
While Applegate got the potty-mouthed
part right, she is all wrong with t he rest of her

statement in that this film paints a picture of
silly, frivolous women who want to seem as if
they are in control of their lives hut in reality
whose existences revolve solely around the
conquests of meeting "cute boys" and wear
ing tight pants to clubs.
While Courtney and Christina scold Jane
for letting a man control her happiness, their
entire concern seems to be getting Christina
together with a man she only spoke to for
five minutes. Their plan is, after all, to stalk
him at a wedding.
What is altogether worse than this embar
rassing hypocrisy is that, while in other films
and television shows, Diaz, Applegate and
Blair have delivered fantastic and hilarious
performances, their jokes and physical com
edy in this film fall flat. The women are not
natural in the skin of their characters — it is
painfully clear that they are acting as they
awkwardly attempt to capture a Sarah Jessi
ca Parker / Kim Catrall type of persona but
end up just l<x>king like themselves, except
really hyper.
Disturbingly, this film was undoubtedly
intended to reach some sort of female target
audience — but who? I dread the moment
when 1 find myself in the ladies room of a
club somewhere, when I will surely en
counter women wearing tube tops and reap
plying their M.A.C. Lipglass, saying that they
are all "ba-jiggity" over some guy, a term
coined from this film.

To all the Cosmo-girls out there who feel
they may relate to this subculture, by all
means, go check out "The Sweetest Thing."
For the rest of the population, please, for the
love of God, do not waste your $9 and two
hours. If you do not believe me and want to
see this movie anyway based on Cameron
Diaz's successful past performances, go
ahead. At least you'll see some beautiful
views of San Francisco, where the film was
shot. These are probably the movie's only re
deeming quality.


"Oh my god, Becky! Her butt is, like, so flat!"
