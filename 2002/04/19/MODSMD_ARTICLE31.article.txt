# 'Frailty' lacks magic, suspense

### MARK ROBBINS 
There are times
when a director tells a
tale so deftly and art
fully that it feels natur
al to buy in. You are
intoxicated by engag
ing dialogue and en
chanting characters,

and absorbed into a fascinating universe of the artist's
rendering.
Then there are times when the magic is missing, and
you are painfully aware you are watching actors reading
lines. You half expect to see a microphone dangling on
screen, to hear the crew cracking jokes in the back
ground, or to see the cameraman's finger over the lens.
Actor / director Bill Paxton's clunky diabolical thriller
"Frailty" falls into this second category.
Paxton has an interesting enough premise to work
with. Mr. Meiks (played by Paxton), a caring single father
in a small Texas town, is cherished and admired by his
two young sons Fenton (Matthew O' Leary) and Adam
(Jeremy Sumpter). One night he wakes them up franti
cally to describe his vision. Judgment Day is fast ap
proaching, and the Meiks family has been chosen to track
down and dispose of demons on earth.
Older brother Fenton does not know what to make of
the whole thing. He hopes it is all just a bad dream. But
before long, Dad comes home with the tools to do G<xl's
work: an axe, a lead pipe and a pair of workers' gloves.
Next he has a list of demons that must be eliminated. Fen
ton objects when he sees that on the list are the names of
real people.
I he story is told clumsily in a series of flashbacks, re
counted by an adult Fenton (Matthew McConaughey) to
FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe), a la "The
Usual Suspects." In these opening scenes alone, there is
enough wotxlen dialogue to construct a nice-looking
patio deck.
"Frailty" is not a flattering film for Paxton or Mc-

Conaughey. While Paxton's role of father-gone-foul may
initially bear some resemblance to Jack Nicholson's un
forgettable Jack Torrence in"The Shining", it does not
allow for near the menace and ferocity. Paxton, instead,
appears to be laboring just to hold the film together.
McConaughey seems equally burdened trying to sell
the story from his end, with little help from Boothe's
dead-weight character. The time sequence and contort
ed storytelling works against the film's strengths and
places t(x> much pressure on child actors O'Leary and
Sumpter, who glimmer but do not shine.
If you appreciated the ingenuity of "Seven" and the
intellect of "The Usual Suspects", this movie is not for
you. It's tcx) bad Paxton didn't borrow more from direc
tor Sam Raimi, with whom he worked on the set of "A
Simple Plan" where plot intricacies, and the subtlety of
character interaction were honed obsessively.
Instead Paxton relies on standard-issue horror mate
rial. With shots of moonlight poking through tree
branches in a graveyard, Paxton's film is too dark, too ex
aggerated, t(X) theatrical. Towards the conclusion, the
story starts swinging a flurry of h<x>ks, each more im
probable and logistically unfounded than the last. By this
time, however, it may be too late to care.
