# 'Changing Lanes' more than 90-minute thrill ride

### LINDSEY GERDES 
I first heard "Changing
Lanes" described as a road
rage thriller starring Ben
Affleck and Samuel L. Jack
son and wrongly assumed it
would be a 90-minute
adrenaline rush of car chas
es and shoot 'em up action

with bits of plot sprinkled in for good effect. Instead, 1 was pleas
antly surprised to discover a thoughtful social commentary that
erred only by being too heavy-handed in its attempts at establishing
greater depth.
The plot revolves around two very different men — up-and
coming young attorney Gavin Banek (Ben Affleck) and struggling
ex-alcoholic Doyle Gibson (Samuel L. Jackson) — whose lives vio
lently collide in a fender-bender on the FDR highway in New York
City. Coincidentally (already walking the tight rope into overstate
ment) the two men are both due in the same courthouse at the same
time but tor very different reasons.
Yuppie lawyer Gavin has been sent as the mouthpiece for his
powerful, morally questionable firm in an entitlement suit while
blue-collar, hard-working Doyle is trying desperately to convince
his ex-wife to stay in New York instead of moving their children to
Oregon. He has just purchased a house for them but because of the
fender-bender — along with the fact that Gavin leaves him stuck by
the side of the road, saying "better luck next time" — he misses his
hearing and any chance of convincing his family to stay.
Gavin's life is similarly thrown into disarray by the accident as he
mistakenly leaves his power of attorney papers by the side of the
road with Doyle, who then uses them as a form of revenge. Thus
begins a day ofback-and-forth retaliation Ix'tween the two men that
moves them to increasingly desperate and violent measures.
Although Gavin's unscrupulous corporate world is often paint
ed as the real villain in the story line, the saving grace of the film is
that the actual characters of Gavin and Doyle are richly sketched
and not just portrayed as merely a cocky little golden boy and an
oppressed, overworked fat her. Gavin struggles with the shallow na
ture of "living on the edge" of the legal world, while Doyle is con
stantly dealing with an overactive temper that has almost ru
ined his life.
The let-down comes though in that this film goes out on a
limb — questioning, poking at, even indicting certain aspects
of society — then runs back for cover, afraid to take that final
step into making an uncomfortable statement. Although this
final compromise does diminish the overall impact of the film,
it is still well worth seeing, if only for at least broaching the
questions. The'wonderful performances from a uniformly
strong cast also provide an added enticement.
On its most basic level, this film is intriguing because of its
overall premise: As much as we like to think that those people
with whom we choose to interact define our existence, a com
plete stranger could come into our lives tomorrow and com
pletely shake our existence if a certain set of circumstances and
timing coincide.

This almost happened to me as I was viewing
the film. 1 was sitting with a friend and the man
next to us began to talk on his cell phone. To my
surprise (and horror) my friend turned over to
him and said, "You better get the hick out of here
with that fucking cell phone right now." I tensed
up, almost expecting a confrontation mirroring
that on the screen, although fortunately the
stranger meekly left the theater to take his call.
I questioned my friend about his tactics and all
he would say is that cell phone talkers were his
worst pet peeve and just tended to push him over
the edge. Although 1 was aghast at his overreac
tion, at its heart this is what this film is all about.

We all have our buttons and when they are pushed as power
fully as in the film, the results can make for an interesting,

somewhat disturbing psychological study into what people art
capable of when their red flag, survival instincts are put up.
