# Long live S.F. strip joints!
## 
### ANTHONY HA JOANNA PETRONE 
On Saturday, April 13, Intermission's intrepid re
porters traveled to San Francisco, determined to
explore the dark, seedy underbelly of the city —
strip clubs. Now, after investigating the Lusty Lady
(1033 Kearny) and the Garden of Eden (529
Broadway), they discuss their findings.
ANTHONY: I was really disappointed in the Lusty
L.ady. I dunno, after reading the description in the
San Francisco Bay Guardian [see their Best of Bay
2000 issue, "Best Place to Fuck While Watching
Feminist Strippers"], 1 thought that it would be ...
classier.
JOANNA: 1 think you have to sort of take as a
given that any strip club in which viewers sit in
dark, solitary booths and watch the dancers
through a glass window is going to be seedy. But
hey, if that's your sort of thing, then the Lusty
Lady is hands-free viewing at its best, and it's very
considerate of them to equip each room with a
free paper towel dispenser. Yes, some might com
plain that there are "gross puddles" on the floor
and "crumpled tissues" on some of the seats, but
I like to think of it as part of the decor. On the
doors to the viewing booths there are vaudeville-

style letterings and sketches that look like they
were taken from an old New Orleans house of
burlesque, and the dancers perform in a red-lit
room where all t he walls are mirrors. The dancers
were attractive, if somewhat bored-looking, and
come right up to the window to shake their tat
toed asses in your face.
ANTHONY: My biggest problem was just the way
in which the strip, particularly with the glass there,
was reduced to this tedious formal exercise. So
you insert some money, I'm estimating a buck for
about a minute, and the covering slides off the
glass window and you get to peek onto the "dance
floor." Ifyou're lucky, once of the dancers will no
tice you before your time is up, saunter over and
casually begin to dance. She was bored, and the
only response that she got out of us when she start
ed spanking herself was stilled laughter. But
everything was done with such indifference that it
wasn't really that funny. If this is voyeurism, then
what the hell am I paying money to watch — a
bored woman, whojust happens to be naked, chat
with her friends? With that in mind, I guess I can
understand how the Lusty Lady's booths with TVs
showing 24 channels of porn might be equally at
tractive. So ... do you want to explain why we just
Imd to watch "Freaky Farm She-Males"?
JOANNA: How could any self-respecting journal
ist neglect the opportunity to study such lost classics
as "Trailer Trash Nurses," or "Horny & Hairy #8?"
And the art of dialogue is lost on you altoget her if

you cannot appreciate such memorable lines as,
"You're lucky you got such a hairy fuh ... vagina]."
(For the record, there had definitely been trim
ming; my God, there are women who would kill for
a bikini wax that good!) I will admit that I found the
concept of going to a strip-club to watch TV more
than a little underwhelming and suggestive of sad,
pimpled middle-schoolers whose parents have
blocked the porn at home. One g(xxf thing about
this place, though, is that all the workers are union
ized, which is super-cool. Support union labor!
Vive la revolucion!
ANTHONY: You're absolutely right, Joanna, peo
ple should go to the Lusty to support the
unionized babes. Sure, you could theoretically have
a better time somewhere else, but only if you're able
to shut out the voice in your head telling you,
"You're exploiting these women, you're exploiting
these women, you're exploiting these women!"
If, however, you're a scumbag with no con
science, you might have a better time at the Garden
of Eden. The layout is a bit more standard —mir-
rored wall, stage with pole and two rows of seats, the
back one for people who like to watch from a dis
tance, the front for those who prefer to get "up close
and personal." Naturally, we sat in the back row.
The first dancer that we saw was pretty hot, in
a slightly frightening sort of way. She was skinny
and blonde, with dark make-up around her eyes;
shimmying to Marilyn Manson. I was kinda-sorta
terrified, but she smiled at us and waved us to the
front. "Come on, I don't bite." Which I'm really
glad was true, considering the fact that she stuck
her head between my legs a few minutes later.
JOANNA: T he Garden of Eden, despite the taste
less and unattractive photographs that adorn the
marquee, is your classic, wholesome, good old
fashioned strip joint. Pretty girls in high heels and
nothing else, dancing, crawling, gyrating, thrust
ing, all mere inches from your face. I thought the
first girl was kind of scary, actually. It was sort of
unsettling, the uncanny resemblance she had to
the singer whose song she was dancing to — Mar
ilyn Manson, singing "Beautiful People." Still, she
had that hot alien / androgyne thing going on.
Like David Bowie a la Ziggy Stardust. But with a
vagina.
The second dancer, who was super-sexy (in that
sorority-girl-gone-wrong sort of way), was a more,
shall we say, traditional performer. Bleached
blonde with visible roots, and clad (but not for very
long) in a 1950'5-style frilly, cherry-print bikini, she
shook her peppy tiling to cheery, bright, bubble
gum pop music. ILie third dancer ... well, I'll get
to her later.
OK, ladies, as far as a female-audience-friendly
performances go, it seemed to vary on a dancer
by-dancer basis, but overall, Garden of Eden rates
pretty high. The first two dancers seemed espe
cially receptive to me, doting on me far more than
on the otherwise all-male audience (and by "dot
ing on me" I mean that one dancer butted her
head against my crotch and pressed her chest
against my face, and the other, apparently con
cerned with my ability to see the show, very kind
ly took my glasses from my face to clean them with
her bare breasts ... funny, I don't remember the
optometrist showing me that one), and asking,
was I enjoying myself, was I comfortable, and so
on. Sadly, the third dancer pretty much ignored
me altogether, directing the majority of her per
formance towards the nasty-looking mafioso-type
men that had just walked in.
Anyway, to sum up, fora fun outing with friends,
choose Garden of Eden. But if you like to jerk off by
yourself in small, dank spaces, the Lusty Lady,
where you can ease your social conscience (among
other things), is the place for you.


One man's reaction to 'Trailer Trash Nurses."

and blonde, with dark make-up around her eyes;
shimmying to Marilyn Manson. I was kinda-sorta
terrified, but she smiled at us and waved us to the
front. "Come on, I don't bite." Which I'm really
glad was true, considering the fact that she stuck
her head between my legs a few minutes later.
JOANNA: T he Garden of Eden, despite the taste
less and unattractive photographs that adorn the
marquee, is your classic, wholesome, good old
fashioned strip joint. Pretty girls in high heels and
nothing else, dancing, crawling, gyrating, thrust
ing, all mere inches from your face. I thought the
first girl was kind of scary, actually. It was sort of
unsettling, the uncanny resemblance she had to
the singer whose song she was dancing to — Mar
ilyn Manson, singing "Beautiful People." Still, she
had that hot alien / androgyne thing going on.
Like David Bowie a la Ziggy Stardust. But with a
vagina.
The second dancer, who was super-sexy (in that
sorority-girl-gone-wrong sort of way), was a more,
shall we say, traditional performer. Bleached
blonde with visible roots, and clad (but not for very
long) in a 1950'5-style frilly, cherry-print bikini, she
shook her peppy tiling to cheery, bright, bubble
gum pop music. ILie third dancer ... well, I'll get
to her later.
OK, ladies, as far as a female-audience-friendly
performances go, it seemed to vary on a dancer
by-dancer basis, but overall, Garden of Eden rates
pretty high. The first two dancers seemed espe
cially receptive to me, doting on me far more than
on the otherwise all-male audience (and by "dot
ing on me" I mean that one dancer butted her
head against my crotch and pressed her chest
against my face, and the other, apparently con
cerned with my ability to see the show, very kind
ly took my glasses from my face to clean them with
her bare breasts ... funny, I don't remember the
optometrist showing me that one), and asking,
was I enjoying myself, was I comfortable, and so
on. Sadly, the third dancer pretty much ignored
me altogether, directing the majority of her per
formance towards the nasty-looking mafioso-type
men that had just walked in.
Anyway, to sum up, fora fun outing with friends,
choose Garden of Eden. But if you like to jerk off by
yourself in small, dank spaces, the Lusty Lady,
where you can ease your social conscience (among
other things), is the place for you.


One man's reaction to 'Trailer Trash Nurses."
On Saturday, April 13, Intermission's intrepid re
porters traveled to San Francisco, determined to
explore the dark, seedy underbelly of the city —
strip clubs. Now, after investigating the Lusty Lady
(1033 Kearny) and the Garden of Eden (529
Broadway), they discuss their findings.
ANTHONY: I was really disappointed in the Lusty
L.ady. I dunno, after reading the description in the
San Francisco Bay Guardian [see their Best of Bay
2000 issue, "Best Place to Fuck While Watching
Feminist Strippers"], 1 thought that it would be ...
classier.
JOANNA: 1 think you have to sort of take as a
given that any strip club in which viewers sit in
dark, solitary booths and watch the dancers
through a glass window is going to be seedy. But
hey, if that's your sort of thing, then the Lusty
Lady is hands-free viewing at its best, and it's very
considerate of them to equip each room with a
free paper towel dispenser. Yes, some might com
plain that there are "gross puddles" on the floor
and "crumpled tissues" on some of the seats, but
I like to think of it as part of the decor. On the
doors to the viewing booths there are vaudeville-

style letterings and sketches that look like they
were taken from an old New Orleans house of
burlesque, and the dancers perform in a red-lit
room where all t he walls are mirrors. The dancers
were attractive, if somewhat bored-looking, and
come right up to the window to shake their tat
toed asses in your face.
ANTHONY: My biggest problem was just the way
in which the strip, particularly with the glass there,
was reduced to this tedious formal exercise. So
you insert some money, I'm estimating a buck for
about a minute, and the covering slides off the
glass window and you get to peek onto the "dance
floor." Ifyou're lucky, once of the dancers will no
tice you before your time is up, saunter over and
casually begin to dance. She was bored, and the
only response that she got out of us when she start
ed spanking herself was stilled laughter. But
everything was done with such indifference that it
wasn't really that funny. If this is voyeurism, then
what the hell am I paying money to watch — a
bored woman, whojust happens to be naked, chat
with her friends? With that in mind, I guess I can
understand how the Lusty Lady's booths with TVs
showing 24 channels of porn might be equally at
tractive. So ... do you want to explain why we just
Imd to watch "Freaky Farm She-Males"?
JOANNA: How could any self-respecting journal
ist neglect the opportunity to study such lost classics
as "Trailer Trash Nurses," or "Horny & Hairy #8?"
And the art of dialogue is lost on you altoget her if

you cannot appreciate such memorable lines as,
"You're lucky you got such a hairy fuh ... vagina]."
(For the record, there had definitely been trim
ming; my God, there are women who would kill for
a bikini wax that good!) I will admit that I found the
concept of going to a strip-club to watch TV more
than a little underwhelming and suggestive of sad,
pimpled middle-schoolers whose parents have
blocked the porn at home. One g(xxf thing about
this place, though, is that all the workers are union
ized, which is super-cool. Support union labor!
Vive la revolucion!
ANTHONY: You're absolutely right, Joanna, peo
ple should go to the Lusty to support the
unionized babes. Sure, you could theoretically have
a better time somewhere else, but only if you're able
to shut out the voice in your head telling you,
"You're exploiting these women, you're exploiting
these women, you're exploiting these women!"
If, however, you're a scumbag with no con
science, you might have a better time at the Garden
of Eden. The layout is a bit more standard —mir-
rored wall, stage with pole and two rows of seats, the
back one for people who like to watch from a dis
tance, the front for those who prefer to get "up close
and personal." Naturally, we sat in the back row.
