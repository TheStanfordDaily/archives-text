# Get in control of your Internet porn habit

Increasingly, it seems, middle-school-aged boys are becoming porn con
noisseurs. It's not as if this is anything new. When I was in the seventh grade,
kids with Internet access at home discovered that they could print nude im
ages of their favorite pin-up girl (usually a "pie-Tommy Ixe" Pamela Ander
son) and then bring them to school to trade with friends. Of course, boys in
adolescence have traded Playboy pictures with each other for years. After all,
nearly ever)' 12-year-old male in this country has at least one friend whose fa
ther kept a stash of porn "hidden" in a relatively obvious place like a filing cab
inet or behind a desk.
No one can deny, however, that die Internet has changed tilings. In a way,
it is somewhat bewildering to consider that Americans have really only been
using the Internet fora decade or so. It makes you wonder where everyone
got their porn from before the online revolution.
Companies like Yahoo! (which has a highly developed index of porno
graphic sites) and America Online (which only adopted content filters a few
years ago) owe much of their initial growth to the proliferation of online
pornography. Given the stigma attached to pornography in our sex iety, it is
not difficult to understand why many have flocked to their computers in order
that they may illicitly satisfy their need for material with which to masturbate.
The results of this are somewhat disturbing.
Since most people believe in their relative anonymity when tliey are online,
many approach the online world without the social consciousness that would
otherwise restrain them from, for example, visiting an adult video store and
asking fora video copy of "Anal Midgets 4." The Internet is a friend that
doesn't judge. Consequently, it caters to every preference, fetish or perversion
imaginable. With a few keystrokes, you can see pictures of Penthouse's Pet of
the Year from 1996 (that would be Elizabeth Ann Hilden), depictions of
bondage, videos ofbestiality or images of Asian women in schoolgirl uniforms.
Asian porn, however, along with bondage, has become so passe, though.
Normal search engines such as Google give you the power to find a verita
ble cornucopia of truly twisted material. "Geriatric" porn, "Disney cartoon
character" porn, "morbidly obese women playing with vegetables" porn â€”
there is a market for all of these things online, and a sizeable one at that. I
know this because one of my close friends is in the habit of plastering my
Windows wallpaper with this material whenever I leave my room. What a
clever kid, huh?
Legions of sexually repressed people (overwhelmingly men) who seek to
mollify their need for sexually aberrant material turn on their computers each
day to this end. In die years since the Internet has come into popular use, doc
umented cases of pornography addiction have rapidly increased. People may
debate over when and if pornography is a vice. One thing is clear, however.
The freedom and anonymity inherent in die Internet necessitate a certain de
gree of individual responsibility. After all, pornography shapes beliefs and be
havior and thus affects us all, not just die porn fiend. The nature of online
pornography, however, makes it difficult to hold people accountable for the
types of material they seek out and they way it can adversely affect their think
ing or actions.
The world of Internet pornography poses numerous conundrums for die
digital age that will not be easily solved. Unul then, I suppose we can only hope
that the youthful curiosity of 12-year-old porn surfers is tempered with age and
maturity. Right now, however, I need to change die image on my desktop.
