# Strippers — women just like any other

Note: For the sab of privacy, the women inter
viewed asked that their real names not be used, so
for the purpose of this article, I will refer to them as
Allison arid Elizabeth.
Meet Allison: in beat-up tennis shoes and
a posture that slumps childishly at her shoul
ders and her hips, she stands just over five
feet. She is wearing baggy, sailor-type blue
jeans rolled over at the waist and a used
looking kid-sized t-shirt with a picture of a
horse and the name of an amusement park.
We are standing in a dimly-lit wood-paneled
hall, and men periodically emerge from
booths and eye us queerly as they walk by,
looking somewhat unnerved at the prospect
of two fully clothed women having an intelli
gent conversation in their midst. I lean on a
wall papered with the jackets to porn videos.
Allison is a professional sex entertainment
worker. She currently works as a nude
dancer at a unionized strip club in San Fran
cisco. She moved here several years ago
from Florida, where she worked as a lingerie

model. When I asked her about the differ
ence between the two work environments
she replied, "In Florida the laws are differ
ent. For example, no nipples. Also, there was
a lot of confusion about how close the cus
tomers could get to the dancers. Here, we
work behind glass so that isn't a problem."
Allison has no doubt that the union has
greatly improved working conditions.
"Where I used to work," she explains, "you
could get fired just because the manager was
having a bad day. Flere, if someone gets
fired, she knows it is coming. We have punch
cards to keep track of our hours, and
whether you get to work on time and if you
continually leave early. If you get fired here
it has to be fora reason; it has to be because
you are not doing your job."
So why would one choose to work as a
stripper? Allison says,"It offers a great deal
of financial freedom. It pays well. I don't
know anyone in the business who is rolling in
money, but, for example, I could work a 12-
hour week, which means just a few days or
evenings of work, and not have to worry
about paying my bills." But Allison, like

many of the workers, does have another job.
"Many of the workers are either artists or
students."
So what are the downsides? Allison says,
"Sex work definitely isn't for everyone. Hav
ing fat, old men masturbate in front of you is
not exacdy everyone's cup of tea, but it just
isn't something that particularly bothers me.
Also, it gets really boring ... really fast."
"But," adds Allison, "these are my experi
ences and reasons. Reasons are going to vary
from girl to girl. If you asked 12 different
girls the same questions, you would get 12
totally different answers."
Indeed. Elizabeth, too, has been a sex en
tertainment worker for some years now. She
has been working in San Francisco as a strip
per in a non-unionized strip club for four
years. Before moving to San Francisco, Eliz
abeth worked at a strip club in Sacramento
for three and a half years, but had to leave
"when work got slow."
Elizabeth is relaxing in a seat near the
dressing room when I talk to her. She has
just been performing and is visibly flushed,
but her makeup — glamorous blue and

black eye liner and glitter on her high
cheekbones —is somehow intact. She is
wearing a simple white tube dress, black un
derwear and enormous high heels with clear
plastic platforms. Minutes ago, I watched as
she descended from the stage, fully nude,
and dressed herself in a corner. Now, we sit
at a table and sip drinks and chat amiably.
We have to speak loudly to hear each other
over the music.
Elizabeth tells me she loves her work. "I
love the dancing, I love the art of it. I love to
be on stage performing, and I love to create
new stuff to perform." Elizabeth has com
plete artistic control over her work. She
chooses the music and choreographs her
dances. "There a some basic things you have
to do," she explains, "like be totally naked by
the end of the dance, do something with the
pole at some point, and make sure that
you've touched yourself, but other than that,
anything goes."
Elizabeth also loves the sense of cama
raderie she feels with other dancers. Site
beams as she tells me about "the really amaz
ing girls" she has met working here. "This
club has really nice girls," she says,"and every
one is just so nice to each other."
Not that there aren't downsides to this

work. There are. "Obviously there are going
to be the gross old men," she says, "but, you
know, you deal." Also, without the protection
of a union, the work can be very unstable.
"You never really know if you are going to
make money or not," she says. Because
dancers here make most of their money from
tips, the amount of money a dancer makes
can vary dramatically from night to night.
And when business gets slow, a lot of women

are out of jobs, as non-unionized jobs have lit
tle, if any, protections. She cites her experi
ence in Sacramento as an example.
As I thank her and stand up to leave, Eliz
abeth gets up and walks with me to the door.
She is very tall standing up. Even without the
shoes, I doubt would stand much taller than
her chin. She is very thin and has a boyish, an
gular confidence in her carriage. I thank her
again and say good-bye. Smiling, she waves

me off. In the dim light, it occurs to me, that I
have no idea what her age might be, and,-in
this lighting, I cannot tell. She turns from the
door, to face the stage, her waist-length hair
fluttering behind her, and the woman in the
simple white dress walks away. In the pink
and gold reflections off the disco ball, she
could be any fashionable young woman going
to a glamorous nightclub. But outside, the
day is still light.

fired, she knows it is coming. We have punch
cards to keep track of our hours, and
whether you get to work on time and if you
continually leave early. If you get fired here
it has to be fora reason; it has to be because
you are not doing your job."
So why would one choose to work as a
stripper? Allison says,"It offers a great deal
of financial freedom. It pays well. I don't
know anyone in the business who is rolling in
money, but, for example, I could work a 12-
hour week, which means just a few days or
evenings of work, and not have to worry
about paying my bills." But Allison, like

many of the workers, does have another job.
"Many of the workers are either artists or
students."
So what are the downsides? Allison says,
"Sex work definitely isn't for everyone. Hav
ing fat, old men masturbate in front of you is
not exacdy everyone's cup of tea, but it just
isn't something that particularly bothers me.
Also, it gets really boring ... really fast."
"But," adds Allison, "these are my experi
ences and reasons. Reasons are going to vary
from girl to girl. If you asked 12 different
girls the same questions, you would get 12
totally different answers."
Indeed. Elizabeth, too, has been a sex en
tertainment worker for some years now. She
has been working in San Francisco as a strip
per in a non-unionized strip club for four
years. Before moving to San Francisco, Eliz
abeth worked at a strip club in Sacramento
for three and a half years, but had to leave
"when work got slow."
Elizabeth is relaxing in a seat near the
dressing room when I talk to her. She has
just been performing and is visibly flushed,
but her makeup — glamorous blue and

black eye liner and glitter on her high
cheekbones —is somehow intact. She is
wearing a simple white tube dress, black un
derwear and enormous high heels with clear
plastic platforms. Minutes ago, I watched as
she descended from the stage, fully nude,
and dressed herself in a corner. Now, we sit
at a table and sip drinks and chat amiably.
We have to speak loudly to hear each other
over the music.
Elizabeth tells me she loves her work. "I
love the dancing, I love the art of it. I love to
be on stage performing, and I love to create
new stuff to perform." Elizabeth has com
plete artistic control over her work. She
chooses the music and choreographs her
dances. "There a some basic things you have
to do," she explains, "like be totally naked by
the end of the dance, do something with the
pole at some point, and make sure that
you've touched yourself, but other than that,
anything goes."
Elizabeth also loves the sense of cama
raderie she feels with other dancers. Site
beams as she tells me about "the really amaz
ing girls" she has met working here. "This
club has really nice girls," she says,"and every
one is just so nice to each other."
Not that there aren't downsides to this

work. There are. "Obviously there are going
to be the gross old men," she says, "but, you
know, you deal." Also, without the protection
of a union, the work can be very unstable.
"You never really know if you are going to
make money or not," she says. Because
dancers here make most of their money from
tips, the amount of money a dancer makes
can vary dramatically from night to night.
And when business gets slow, a lot of women

are out of jobs, as non-unionized jobs have lit
tle, if any, protections. She cites her experi
ence in Sacramento as an example.
As I thank her and stand up to leave, Eliz
abeth gets up and walks with me to the door.
She is very tall standing up. Even without the
shoes, I doubt would stand much taller than
her chin. She is very thin and has a boyish, an
gular confidence in her carriage. I thank her
again and say good-bye. Smiling, she waves

me off. In the dim light, it occurs to me, that I
have no idea what her age might be, and,-in
this lighting, I cannot tell. She turns from the
door, to face the stage, her waist-length hair
fluttering behind her, and the woman in the
simple white dress walks away. In the pink
and gold reflections off the disco ball, she
could be any fashionable young woman going
to a glamorous nightclub. But outside, the
day is still light.
Note: For the sab of privacy, the women inter
viewed asked that their real names not be used, so
for the purpose of this article, I will refer to them as
Allison arid Elizabeth.
Meet Allison: in beat-up tennis shoes and
a posture that slumps childishly at her shoul
ders and her hips, she stands just over five
feet. She is wearing baggy, sailor-type blue
jeans rolled over at the waist and a used
looking kid-sized t-shirt with a picture of a
horse and the name of an amusement park.
We are standing in a dimly-lit wood-paneled
hall, and men periodically emerge from
booths and eye us queerly as they walk by,
looking somewhat unnerved at the prospect
of two fully clothed women having an intelli
gent conversation in their midst. I lean on a
wall papered with the jackets to porn videos.
Allison is a professional sex entertainment
worker. She currently works as a nude
dancer at a unionized strip club in San Fran
cisco. She moved here several years ago
from Florida, where she worked as a lingerie

model. When I asked her about the differ
ence between the two work environments
she replied, "In Florida the laws are differ
ent. For example, no nipples. Also, there was
a lot of confusion about how close the cus
tomers could get to the dancers. Here, we
work behind glass so that isn't a problem."
Allison has no doubt that the union has
greatly improved working conditions.
"Where I used to work," she explains, "you
could get fired just because the manager was
having a bad day. Flere, if someone gets
fired, she knows it is coming. We have punch
cards to keep track of our hours, and
whether you get to work on time and if you
continually leave early. If you get fired here
it has to be fora reason; it has to be because
you are not doing your job."
