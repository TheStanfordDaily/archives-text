# Porno review: 'Happiest Girls on Earth' shouldn't be
## 
### ROBERT MORALES 
They are "The Happiest Girls on Earth!" Well, that's what
the obnoxiously oversized box to "I ,il' Women 3: Adventures
In The Real World" claims. You might wonder how any
body who makes their living by selling their sexuality could
be happy at all. On the other hand, though, it is also easy to
see how someone who is paid to have sex could indeed be
quite content, ecstatic even.
Unfortunately, there is no proof one way or another. This
particular porno is VHS, not DVD, and that means there is
no bonus footage tagged on at the end with in-depth inter
views with the stars.
I guess we will just have to trust what is on the box.
On camera, it is certainly hard to argue with the box's
claims. All eight of the young women in this adult Hick are
genuinely happy to be home from college. In fact, they are
so excited they hunt down every free penis in town. From
sweatshop bosses to piano teachers, there isn't a man in
around that is safe.
Luckily for the girls, they don't run into too much resis-

tance. Everyone seems more than willing
to learn first-hand what the girls have
been learning while away at school.
The girls are the true stars; none of
the men can keep up with them for long
and each male character is limited to a
single scene as the feisty pack of Euro
pean beauties and the frantic pace of
this episodic film leave the men won
dering what hit them.
By the time the tall brunette cleans up
in the laundromat and die eight-girl
swim team gains revenge on their coach,
the viewer might wonder who really has
the upper hand. As the girls turn patri
archal figures on their head one after an-

other with wide grins and heavy moaning, the viewer becomes
a cheerleader for more reasons than the obvious.
Alter all, fortune may be on the side of the men in film.
They just wake up one day and suddenly have to deal with a
pack of horny, young college students.

Still, the prowess of the girls
should not be ignored. They get ex
actly what the want the instant the
want it. And, they get it from the
men who have always had power
over them. As each guy strains to
keep up with the more playful, ener
getic girls, there is no question as to
who has the power in the bedroom.
Sadly, "Lil Women" shows that
the women's influence disappears
once the clothes go back on.
The over-t he-top facial expres
sions that accompany any orgasm
are among the most comical and
memorable. Yet, I found the sense

of pride in Krisztina's eyes and her devilish smile as she
prepared to perform oral sex on a former teacher to be the
most troubling.
Somebody should tell her she's deceiving herself if she
feels powerful with a penis in her hand.
