# One woman's case for setting the fellas free

### NASTASSIA LOPEZ 
"My girlfriend won't let me go to a strip
club." And another sad soul skulks away in
meek desjx >ndency, under the weight of three
bags from Bloomingdales and his empty wal
let. Too many times I have heard this phrase
sadly uttered out of a committed boy's mouth.
Many women believe that strip clubs are inde
cent whore houses where men unreservedly
subject themselves to the whims of carnal plea
sure. I disagree and say, "let them have fun."
You may think that I am betraying my
own sex, but hear me out first. Men are sim
ple, and there are three cardinal rules that
every girl should think about while dating a
boy: First, never take him shopping; second,
always laugh at his jokes; and third, let him
go to a strip club.
Strip clubs!?
First of all, I've never met any man, gay or
straight, who did not appreciate the naked fe

male body. At a strip club, "there is a 100% per
cent guarantee that diere will be women there
without any clothes.
Remember: a stripper is not a hooker. If
your boyfriend knows himself, and is secure
about his relationship with you, there is 110
valid reason for him to engage in any sexual
act with the stripper. If he was smart enough
to pass bis SATs and get this far, he's smart
enough to realize that it's not wotth letting
some silk one-inflated doll who can barely floss
her teeth, come between what he has with you.
More often than not, he's just having a good
time with his buddies, being young, and doing
what men do. Men will be men will be men,
and will carry on with illogical stunts until the
end of time.
Yes, we put up with their belching, farting
and memory lapses, but I think our own sex is
far harder to deal with. 'Uteres the whining,
the menstrual cycles, the corny romance
movies we make them sit through, all the times

he's helped you decide between eight different
pairs of the same color shoe and tiie great
amount of emotional baggage that comes
along with being a female. Naked women
equals "gtxxl time" in the ageless book of man.
You would hope that your boyfriend would
be equally permissive and ;illow you to attend
an event where Brad Pitt stripped down.
I am not wrong or immoral in proposing
this ramble oflogic. My high school boss and his
wife went to strip clubs as a pair. My best
friend's parents watched pomos together. My
mom even tolerates my dad listening to
I loward Stern in die mornings. All are still very
much in love. My last bit of advice before any of
you girls beat, verbally abuse, or maim your
Ixiyfriend for going to a strip club, is simple:
trust your boy.
Finally, I must give credit where credit is
due. Stripping is a very self-consck>us task and
is not for everyone. It's the delight of die tease
t hat the men like; the seduction of having die

female lxx:ly unraveled to "boom boom shak-a
lacka" music in the foreground, Iliis said, I
present all of the girlfriends out there with a
challenge: do a strip tease for your boyfriend,
and see how hard il reallv is.


Come on, ladies, let 'em go!
