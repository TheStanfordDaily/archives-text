# Freed breaks through with debut
## 
### SERENA LAUREN BLODGER 
It might go like this. It's
been a long clay. You throw
your backpack down and
start listening to Jeremiah
Freed's self-titlecl debut. Per
haps you are curious to see if
it's any good. After all, this
band definitely has a buzz

surrounding it — a breeding ground for skepticism in the
minds of those loyally divorced from pop culture.
Then, "Stranded," the first song on "Jeremiah Freed"
begins and puts cynicism to shame. The song builds, slowly
„}(et powerfully, until halfway through the song something
grabs you. You won't know whether to cry your eyes out or
jump around your room banging your head up and down,
trying to harmonize with the passionate voice of lead singer
Joe Smith.
Joe Smith, along with Kerry Ryan, Jake Roche, Matt
Crosby and Nic k Goodale ofYork, Maine, formed Jeremiah
Freed during their sophomore year of high school, just four
short years ago. Their story is one that can inspire or intimi
date: they studied music with so much dedication and deter
mination that talent could not help but be recognized. It
wasn't luck for them. They are simply that good.
Jeremiah Freed, inspired by legends such as Led Zepplin,
Aerosmith, The Who and Lynyrd Skynrd, manage to com-

bine elements of classic rock with elements of
today's pop music to create mini-rock sym-

phonies.
"Ginger" stands out on the album as
an angstful-romantic and heart
wrenching song, preceded by a
minute of acoustic-sounding blues
guitar: an example of the band's abili
ty to sound like southern rock one
minute and Radiohead the next.

"Can't Live" picks up the pace following
"Ginger," with intense drumming by Kerry
Ryan and powerful, harsh vocals by Smith.
"Reasons" is an amazingly catchy song that
sounds both dark and uplifting.
"Eyes, Life, Change," a nearly nine
minute-long song, displays the phenomenal
instrumental capabilities of the band's gui
tarists Jake R(x:he and Nick Goodale. The
song's melody could technically allow for it to
sound like other pop-rock songs on the
radio. But Jeremiah Freed is too smart for
that: skilled and catchy riffs on the electric

guitar fill breaks in Joe Smith's flawless vocals. In doing so,
Jeremiah Freed reawakens elements of classic rock music
desperately needed back in today's Top 40.
While topically the songs of "Jeremiah Freed" are deep
and thought-provoking, there are some lyrical problems. At

times, the band is so wrapped up in the music that a single
line is over-repeated and not varied for quite some time.
However, this is only a small problem. The majority of peo
ple who listen to Jeremiah Freed will probably be too much
in awe of the band's musicianship to notice.


All right... so which one of you is Jeremiah?
