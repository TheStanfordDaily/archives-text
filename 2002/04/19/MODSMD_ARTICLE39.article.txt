# 'Kept' apes off of 'Rent' tradition
## 
### TIFFANY LEE 
Like "Rent," "Kept" tries to take an old
tried-and-true story and modernize it for the

20th century. The difference how
ever, is that "Kept" lacks the radi
cal innovation of "Rent" and
chooses a story that is far more
trite. It presents the classic love
story of a prostitute or courtesan
finding love with a poor boy, and
all the trials and tribulations this
romance brings.

Set in the late '70s or early '80s, this play fo
cuses on the Studio 54 scene with its reputa
tion for sex, drugs and disco. This certainly
makes for an interesting setting and though
there are many interesting side characters, I
thought the script didn't develop these char
acters enough. One such character is Blake,

the gay friend of both lan and Caleigh (a
dude and a prostitute, respectively). His
character is designed to be funny, witty and
interesting, but this did not come out as much

as I would have
liked to see in the
course of the
story. The change
in his character
seems rather
abrupt and it
would have been

nice to see a more subtle transformation in
character.
The villain of the story, Caleigh's sugar
daddy Marshall, did not elicit within me any
feelings of hatred or anger over what he did
to keep Caleigh leashed to his side. Although
I knew on a mental level that what he did was
wrong, at the same time I did not hate him

for it, which reflects how I felt about most of
the characters in the play: apathetic.
The scenery is amazingly well done. When
the scene switches to Caleigh's loft, the props
do a great job of capturing who she is. The
modern-looking furniture shows an attempt
at class, but the zebra-striped pillows cover
ing her bed illustrate otherwise. What I real
ly like most about this scene, however, are the
bare pipe structures surrounding the room
itself. Although the loft itself is done up in a
rich, magnificent style, the bare pipes that
surround it represent what Caleigh really is
underneath all the glitz and glamour.
The costuming is also done quite well, es
pecially Caleigh's. Her hairstyle and outfits
are reminiscent of good housewife clothing
of the time period, but each outfit also had
something that is slightly risque, usually a
very low neckline or very low back. This rep

resents who she is: a girl who wants to be a
housewife, but who cannot escape the cour
tesan life she has embarked upon.
What really disappointed me, at the be
ginning of the play, at least, were the music
and lyrics. Itie first act did not have any
songs that were memorable in anyway. I was
struck also by how the singer's melodies did
not always coincide with the melodies of the
orchestra below. Maybe it was just a style of
music that I didn't understand.
The music, however, takes a drastic turn
for the better at the beginning of the second
half of the play. In fact, the second half of the
play was both entertaining and enjoyable.
The melodies are more interesting, the lyrics
more meaningful and the singing more pow
erful. Though the play is fairly entertaining
after the end of the first act, it greatly suffers
from its slow start.
