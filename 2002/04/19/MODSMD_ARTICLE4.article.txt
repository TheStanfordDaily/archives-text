Last night, documentary film
maker, satirist and activist Michael
Moore spoke at Kresge Auditori
um about the Sept. 11 attacks and
the American public's reaction to
the event.
Moore opened his speech re
garding the attacks on a personal
note. He said that on Sept. 11, he
and his wife were in Los Angeles,
while their daughter was in New
York. "llley immediately rented a
car, to drive out to New York and
make sure she was all right and it
cost them $ 1,500. "Capitalism is not
about compassion," Moore said.
"It's about supply and demand."
Moore described his cross
country journey by car and the
general feelings of the people he
encountered on the way. "What
we found was our fellow Ameri
cans lost in grief and sorrow,"

Moore said. He went on to say that
in the midst of their grief, nobody
seemed to know what exactly had
happened. According to Moore,
not many people were asking
about what happened either.
Moore then provided the audi
ence with information that linked
the bin Laden and Bush families.
According to Moore, the families
have oil-related business ties. He
asked the audience if they knew
about the connection and what
they thought about the bin Laden
and Bush families continuing to do
business.
The talk turned to what Moore
called American media propagan
da. Moore said that much of the in
formation about Osama bin Laden
was designed to cause paranoia.
"Ooooh ... he's everywhere,"
Moore said, waving his arms at the
audience. "Osama bin Laden â€”
he could be here tonight! We
don't know!"

Moore said that Osama bin
Laden had severe medical prob
lems. "Osama bin Laden, for the
last 18 months has been on dialysis,
he has failing kidneys," he said.
"They don't expect him to live
long, but that doesn't fit in with the
scary image."
The discussion of bin Laden
being used to create fear among

Americans led to a parallel in
Moore's speech between the U.S.
and George Orwell's 1984. "In
1984," Moore said, "the leader
needed a permanent war in order
to keep the people in a state of con
stant fear." The creation of fear,
according to Moore, causes free
