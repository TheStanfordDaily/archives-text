# Mates' latest sweetens indie-pop
## 
### RYAN SANDS 
You know an album is fantastic
when the only criticism you can
level against it is that the album
cover is creepy. With "Our Con
stant Concern", the husband-and
wife duo Mates of State have per
fected their own style of pop
music, relying on a "no-guitar"

sound and striking male / female vocals. Kori
Gardner, whose Yamaha electric organ drives
the melody of their songs, and Jason Hammel,
who comprises the band's backbone on drums,
started Mates of State in Kansas in 1997 and
moved to the Bay Area the next year to pursue
music together. The results have been more
than successful, with perhaps the two best indie
pop records of recent years under their belt and
more music on the way.
Hometown heroes of sorts, Mates of State re
side in San Francisco and have developed their
loyal and loving lan base by playing local venues
such as Cafe Du Nord, Bottom of the Hill and
even at Stanford's own Lambda Nu. The band's
popularity continues to grow through word of
mouth among fans and by the strength of their
amazing live shows.
Mates of State have spent the past year or so
touring like mad, tearing tracks across the en
tire United States and even hopping over to

Mates of State •n p,
"Our Constant
Polyvinyl Records

Europe fora lew shows in Germany, England
and Sweden. As solid and lovely as "Our Con-

stant Concern" is, no
recording could really cap
ture the strength of Mates
of State's onstage dynamic.
Truly, it is a band to be ex
perienced live.
First off, this is a
band that can sing. Gard-

tier's voice is my liivorite within the indie and
pop scene, a voice which sounds sweet even as
she belts out lines at the top of her lungs and is
able to maintain its strength as she lulls softly.
Mates of State layer vocal harmonies in a way
that punctuates each member's individual
strengths and conviction while simultaneously
conveys compelling affection and closeness be
tween the two. This becomes even more evident
live, as these partners in crime glance knowing
ly to each other lor visual cues and laugh to each
other when one Hubs a lyric of misses a note.
The songs Gardner and Hammel have cre
ated together, whether romantic, boisterous,
argumentative or reflective, live and breathe
"ours"; listening to their music gives you a pic
ture of a relationship between t wo people that,
despite the pressures of living and playing to
gether, really works.
"Our Constant Concern" was written this
past summer after Gardner and Hammel

tied the knot, and reflects both artistic and
personal growth for the band. Musically, the
tracks are more varied than the Mates' first
album "My Solo Project", trying out new

vocal effects and
arrangements,
and even throw
ing in a trumpet
on one track for
good measure.
The songs' lyrics
read as pleasantly
obtuse, with po
etic contradic
tions and paral
lels which give
the listener only
shards of mean
ing and the im
pression of hav
ing overheard a
personal conver
sation without
being able to de
cipher all the de
tails.
The songs on
"Our Constant
Concern" each
have their own
flare and sparkle,

but still manage to come together to form an
album with a natural continuity that llows frwm
track to track. This album is so good that 1 usu
ally listen to it two or three times through every

time I put it in my
stereo. One highlight is
the hopeful and sober
ly romantic "Über Le
gitimate," which the
band performed at
their own wedding.
Some of the best tracks
on the album, includ
ing "Quit Doin' It,""A
Duel Will Settle T-iris"
and "Halvesand Have
nots" contain super-ro
bust choruses that will
get you singing along,
but still contain the
Mates' signature con
templative and melod
ic breakdowns within.
"Girls Singing" stands
out as the most beauti
ful track on the album,
with Gardner arid
Hammel compliment
ing each other perfect
ly, as only two who are
in love could.


Baby, let's make some beautiful music together.
