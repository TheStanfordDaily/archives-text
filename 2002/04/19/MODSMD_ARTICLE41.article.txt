# Classic day trip from Moody Blues

### STEPHEN VIGIL 
This is the fifth in a series of articles called 'The Record Bin" exploring
classic albums from the past: pap music, for peof)le who love pop music.

The year was 1967. Drugs were
omnipresent and mind expansion
was the ultimate goal of most hip
pies and rock bands. Popular
music was growing increasingly
heavy and psychedelic as progres
sive and acid rock replaced the
blissful pop so common in the '50s.
No longer content with writing

catchy pop songs, bands looked for ways to push the bound
aries of rock 'n' roll music. One of the longest-lasting inno
vations of this time was the concept album.
A concept album is a full-length release whose songs are
all tied around a central theme. Most critics mark its emer
gence with the release of "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club
Band" in 1967 by the Beatles. The Fab Four's landmark
album certainly changed the course of rock music forever
and no one can take that away from them. However, 1967
saw the release of another concept album that also stands as
a landmark to the era. The Moody Blues' "Days of Future
Passed" has remained beneath the radar of music histori
ans and critics for some time. Much like the Beatles and

Pink Floyd, however, the Moodies were pioneers dedicat
ed to taking music further and used the concept album as
their vehicle.
The band, composed of songwriters Mike Finder,
Graeme Edge, John Lodge, Ray Thomas and Justin Hay-

ward, released the album in conjunction
with the London Festival Orchestra con-

ducted by Peter Knight.
Some critics may dissent,
but "Days of Future
Passed" actually marks
the first major collabora
tive effort between a pro
gressive rock band and a

symphony — something that groups like
Led Zeppelin and later Metallica would
only do years later.
Writing about the Moody Blues and the
concept album, critic Bill Holdship said,
"Basically, they created an entire genre
here." Today, such the concept album
seems quite commonplace, with bands
ranging from Train to Metallica dabbling in
the art. However, in 1967 this was a revolu-

tionary and critical advance in the evolution of rock music. It
fostered the evolution of the studio band and made touring
for groups such as the Moodies and the Beatles difficult. The

Moody Blues actually ended up having to use a melotron for
their live concerts to imitate a lull-fledged orchestra, ft is also
seen as the precursor to modern Hollywood soundtracks, a
mix of orchestra and popular music.
Modeled after the general theme of daytime," Days of Fu
ture Passed" progresses from"The Day Begins" to the di
mactic "Nights In White Satin". The music meanders

through periods of orchestral interludes
to rock balladry and even spoken poetry.
To open and close the album, John Lodge
reads the following prose: "Cold-hearted
orb that rules the night / Removes the col
ors from our sight / Red is grey and yellow
white / But we decide which is right / And
which is an illusion."
The Blues use a concept to end a
concept. The day is over and so is the
album. The journey for mental expansion
is not, however, as the album makes one
wonder what the intention of the band
was. It is a perfect ending to a bona fide
work of art. Of course there will be people
who will always dismiss it as an acid trip
(and I don't doubt drugs were involved)^

but they fail to see the musical and lyrical sophistication of it.
Perhaps the Moody Blues put it best: "Just what the truth is
[they] can't say anymore."


Wow. Moody.
