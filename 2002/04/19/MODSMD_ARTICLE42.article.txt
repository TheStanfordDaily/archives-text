# Venus says: "Thumbs up for Anna Nicole Smith!"
## 
### 
Supposedly a woman peaks sexually at
age 40 and a man at age 20. If that's true,
then a 40 year-old woman and a man
half her age would comprise the ideal

couple, wouldn't they? However, we all
know that there is a huge stigma attached to
lovers with such an age difference between
them.
i To most men, the prospect of having sex

with a younger woman is a no-brain
er — after all, ripe breasts and a firm

butt are surely more appealing
than flabby arms and a face that
could use some Botox injections.
In these types of relationships,

however, the young woman is
usually judged as a whore, trading

looks and sex for the allection of her lascivious, but
wealthy older companion. The Anna Nicole Smith
scenario immediately comes to mind: maybe he'll
die soon, leaving her a respectable inheritance.
But why come to this judgement without taking
into account the evidence first?
I must admit that I have had many more pleas
ant experiences with older, more experienced
partners than with young amateurs (though the
latter do often have a greater stamina). First of all
the more mature lover knows exacdy what to do to
give you pleasure. You can totally free yourself of
any worries and restraints you may have. Addi
tionally a more sophisticated and knowledgeable
amani will likely care much more about your or-

gasm than about themselves.
As a person accumulates ro
mantic experience, sexual in
timacy becomes much more
about reciprocating pleasure
than receiving it.

Of course, let's be honest with ourselves. At ei
ther end of the age spectrum, few men will be in

the position to effectively satiate a woman's crav
ings. But one can hardly blame a man for choosing
a sprightly, less-conservative and more experi
mentally-friendly bed side partner. After all, few
will argue that later in life, a man has less and less
to look forward to.
But what about the other way around: an older
woman seducing a younger gentleman? I definite
ly understand the woman — if she is assertive,
knows what she wants and knows how to get it, the
vigor and appetite of a younger fellow is certainly
appealing. And what greater experience for the
guy than to completely give himself to a true sex
goddess, who knows where to touch, lick and suck
to make the encounter as long and as pleasurable
as possible?
It seems that cross-age sex is a possibility you
should at least consider to enrich your sexual
repertoire — perhaps you can learn some new
tricks for future partners. J ust make sure to ask for
some identification. You wouldn't want to get into
trouble for molesting a minor, especially not dur
ing Admit Weekend.
