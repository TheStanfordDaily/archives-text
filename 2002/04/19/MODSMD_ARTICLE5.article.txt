# Ram's Head presents 'Mystery of Edwin Drood'

### SARAH PAPÃ‰ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Forget theater where the audience sits back
and lets the actors do ;ill the work. This year,
Ram's Head's spring musical "The Mystery of
Edwin Drood" requires the audience to solve the
mystery themselves.
"The Mystery of Edwin Drood" is an original
Broadway production based on the unfinished
novel by Charles Dickens. The story is a play
within a play that takes a turn when Edwin
Drood, the fiancee of one characters, disappears
on Christmas Eve. The play turns into a "who
dunnit" mystery where the audience chooses
the ending.
The musical is produced by Ram's 1 lead The

atrical Society, a student-run theatrical group on
campus. Each year in the spring, they produce a
musical and this year they chose "The Mystery of
Edwin Drood" because it is a lesser-known play
and it involves a huge technical crew.
"More students are involved this year than last
because last year's play wasn't as technical," said
sophomore Trang Pham, the play's producer.
"We have seven different sets, designed by stu
dents and with a period piece, we need students to
design costumes as well."
Pan of the challenge for this year's play was
piecing everything together.
"The play is kind of corny," Pham said. "But
when you pull it off. it really looks good and the
play goes well."
The cast began practicing in January and al

ready had two performances last weekend.
"Keeping up with the crazy rehearsal sched
ule, which has been at least six hours a day for the
past two weeks leading up to opening night, is
taxing," said freshman Meredith Kendall, who
plays Rosa Bud, Drood's fiancee. "Staying men
tally and physically fit to perform a high-energy
show such as Edwin Drood requires a lot of focus
and dedication."
The first two performances went well, accord
ing to Pham.
"On Saturday night, the audience really got
into it and the cast fed of that energy," Pham said.
"I think the audience really likes being able to be
a part of the play. They didn't get it at first, but
then people start figuring out the
motives of the characters and identi
fying with different ones."
The cast is prepared to do multi
ple endings, which cast members say
adds to the fun of the play.

"It sure makes the actors stay alert
to see what ending we have pre
pared for at a moment's notice,"
Kendall said. "The mystery and
'anything-can-happen' attitude that
characterizes the show makes it high
energy and exciting."
Pham said that part of the reason
she likes the play so much is the vot
ing that the audience does.
Cast member Nathan Lasche, a

senior, agrees.
" I think it adds a lot of excitement
and unpredictability to the musical,
which is a great way to engage the
audience and give them their own
role."
The play is running April today
and tomorrow at Memorial Audito
rium starting at 8 p.m. each night.
Cost is $9 for Stanford students and
$15 for the general public.
