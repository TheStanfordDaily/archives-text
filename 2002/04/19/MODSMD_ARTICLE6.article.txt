# Students protest clothing line
## 
### CYNTHIA CHO EDITORIAL STAFF 
Early Tuesday morning, se
nior B J Lee was browsing the
Abercrombie 8c Fitch Web site
when he came across a T-shirt
that read, "Wong Brothers
Laundry Service — Two
Wongs Can Make It White."
Next to these words were two
smiling figures, with slanted
eyes and wearing rice-paddy
hats—reminiscent of 1900s
popular-culture depictions of
Chinese men.
Less than 48 hours later, over
75 students — of many racial
backgrounds — gathered
Wednesday night in the lounge
of Okada House, the Asian-
American theme house, to dis
cuss the company's line of T
shirts that portray Asian Ameri
cans in what many students have
called a stereotypical and
derogatory manner.
Another T-shirt reads,
"Wok-N-Bowl — Let the Good
Times Roll — Chinese Food 8c
Bowling."
"Abercrombie and Fitch Bud
dha Bash — Get Your Buddha
on the Floor," reads another.
The meeting was organized
and led by the Asian American
Students Association, at the re
quest of several students, and
lasted until 2 a.m. After Lee
discovered the T-shirts, he
sent out an e-mail to students
and student groups on cam
pus, including AASA, in which

he called the T-shirts a "slap in
the face to the Asian and Asian-
American communities."
Upon receipt of this e
mail — and subsequent e-mails
sent by other students in re
sponse — many students want
ed the opportunity to discuss
how to react to and take action
against Abercrombie 8c Fitch.
Between the time that Lee first
noticed the T-shirts and the
meeting held Wednesday night,
similar e-mails quickly spread
across the country.
"Several universities and or
ganizations learned of these T
shirts through that initial

spark," said AASA Chair Bryan
Kim, a sophomore. "[They]
noted the origin of the emails
and expected Stanford's AASA
to react. Student groups repre
senting dozens of universities
have already contacted me ask
ing what they can do.
"The community here,
which AASA is a part of, is ex
pected to lead some plan of ac
tion," he said.
At Wednesday's meeting,
AASA encouraged students to
call Abercrombie 8c Fitch to file
formal complaints. Yesterday,

the San Jose Mercury News re
ported that the company received
about 60 telephone complaints on
Wednesday, many of them from
Stanford students.
Yesterday, the company an
nounced that it would pull the T
shirts from all of its 300-plus
stores —just one week after they
first went on sale. All but one T
shirt have been pulled from the
Web site.
"If anyone still has doubts
about how valuable community
centers and student groups are to
the Stanford community, they
should consider that in the course
of 48 hours, a group of Stanford
students was able to organize, mo
bilize and activate a campaign to
get a national clothing retailer to
apologize for their racist prod
ucts," said coterminal student
John Lim.
Sophomore Sung Woo Cho
spoke with Hampton Carney, a
spokesperson for the company,
when he called to file a complaint.
" I wanted to get the message out to
Abercrombie that Stanford stu
dents had negative feelings about
the pictures and words on these T
shirts," Cho said.
According lo Cho, Carney of
fered him a personal apology and
said that the T-shirts were de
signed "only to give people a
chuckle."
In an article published in the
San Francisco Chronicle yester
day, Carney said, "We personally
thought Asians would love this T
shirt."
However, many Stanford stu
dents have expressed views con
trary to the expectations of the
company.
"These offensive T-shirts are in
dicative of the blind eye that Amer
ica continues to turn to racist por
trayals of Asian Americans," said
junior Toru Mino. "We should
take this opportunity to finally de

mand that these demeaning im
ages no longer be tolerated in
mainstream culture," he said.
Stanford students wanted not
only to talk about what was hap
pening but also wanted to organize
and plan an effective way to act
against the company. The agenda
for Wednesday night's meeting in
cluded coming up with a list of de
mands. Among these were a for
mal, public apology from the com
pany and a halt on production ol
the T-shirts.
"We are currently in the process
ofstrategizingan effective national
campaign surrounding this issue,"
Kirn said. "I've been talking about
this with student leaders around
the nation and they agree that we
must create a consolidated plan ol
action."
AASA is in the process of draft
ing a list of demands and a mis
sion statement. Once completed,
a "flexible plan of action to pres
sure Abercrombie to accept these
demands" must be created, Kim
said.
At the meeting, there was talk
of other demands. Sophomore
Christine Ku suggested that
Abercrombie & Fitch invest in
community programs that edu
cate the public about Asian-
American issues. There was also a
discussion about the lack of diver
sity iti the company's advertise
ments, quarterly catalogue and
hiring practices.
In the past, Abercrombie &
Fitch has received complaints
about its clothing and advertise
ments. According to the article in
The Chronicle, last year the com
pany "caught flak from some ac
tivist groups, and even state gov
ernments, for what they viewed as
sexually suggestive advertising
campaigns and catalog photos."
Carney admitted that Aber
crombie targets many groups in
their designs and advertisements.
"We poke fun at everybody,
from women, to flight attendants,
to baggage handlers, to football
coaches, to Irish Americans, to
snow skiers. There's reallv no

group we haven't teased." he told
The Chronicle.
AASA has decided to allot up to
$1000 to the campaign against
Abercrombie & Fitch. Most of the
money will be used to produce fly
ers, posters and banners; and to
provide transportation to rallies,
protests and other gatherings.
Sophomore Jeffrey Chang, the
AASA treasurer, expects the ex
penses to add up to around $200
but said AASA is willing to spend
"whatever it takes to support the
activism."
Yesterday, more than 20 Stan
ford students participated in a
rally in front of the Abercrombie &
Fitch store in San Francisco, orga
nized by the Chinatown Commu
nity Development Center. About
200 people were present in total. A
few speeches were made to the
crowd as flyers were handed out to
people on the street.
Kim said that support from
non-Asian-American groups, both
in and outside of Stanford, is es
sential. "Incidents of insensitivity
or outright racism and intolerance
affects all communities," he said.
"In a promising sign, Stanford's
Black Student Union, MEChAand
Students of Color Coalition have
not only offered their support, but
also have been active in the plan
ning and organizing for upcoming
events," Kim said.
A\SA is in the process of plan
ning more events on campus.
Though nothing is yet concrete,
there has been discussion of a
rally in White Plaza and a protest
at local Abercrombie 8c Fitch
stores.
Lee commented on the impor
tance of taking action against the
company immediately. "Asian
Americans were being targeted be
cause we are stereotypically seen as
passive and nonconfrontational.
They thought they'd get away with
it and we have to show them that
they can't.
"I am encouraged by the elec
tricity in the air, not only at Stan
ford but also at college campuses
all over the country," Lee said.

Lee commented on the impor
tance of taking action against the
company immediately. "Asian
Americans were being targeted be
cause we are stereotypically seen as

Early Tuesday morning, se
nior B J Lee was browsing the
Abercrombie 8c Fitch Web site
when he came across a T-shirt
that read, "Wong Brothers
Laundry Service — Two
Wongs Can Make It White."
Next to these words were two
smiling figures, with slanted
eyes and wearing rice-paddy
hats—reminiscent of 1900s
popular-culture depictions of
Chinese men.
Less than 48 hours later, over
75 students — of many racial
backgrounds — gathered
Wednesday night in the lounge
of Okada House, the Asian-
American theme house, to dis
cuss the company's line of T
shirts that portray Asian Ameri
cans in what many students have
called a stereotypical and
derogatory manner.
Another T-shirt reads,
"Wok-N-Bowl — Let the Good
Times Roll — Chinese Food 8c
Bowling."
"Abercrombie and Fitch Bud
dha Bash — Get Your Buddha
on the Floor," reads another.
The meeting was organized
and led by the Asian American
Students Association, at the re
quest of several students, and
lasted until 2 a.m. After Lee
discovered the T-shirts, he
sent out an e-mail to students
and student groups on cam
pus, including AASA, in which

he called the T-shirts a "slap in
the face to the Asian and Asian-
American communities."
Upon receipt of this e
mail — and subsequent e-mails
sent by other students in re
sponse — many students want
ed the opportunity to discuss
how to react to and take action
against Abercrombie 8c Fitch.
Between the time that Lee first
noticed the T-shirts and the
meeting held Wednesday night,
similar e-mails quickly spread
across the country.
"Several universities and or
ganizations learned of these T
shirts through that initial

spark," said AASA Chair Bryan
Kim, a sophomore. "[They]
noted the origin of the emails
and expected Stanford's AASA
to react. Student groups repre
senting dozens of universities
have already contacted me ask
ing what they can do.
"The community here,
which AASA is a part of, is ex
pected to lead some plan of ac
tion," he said.
At Wednesday's meeting,
AASA encouraged students to
call Abercrombie 8c Fitch to file
formal complaints. Yesterday,

the San Jose Mercury News re
ported that the company received
about 60 telephone complaints on
Wednesday, many of them from
Stanford students.
Yesterday, the company an
nounced that it would pull the T
shirts from all of its 300-plus
stores —just one week after they
first went on sale. All but one T
shirt have been pulled from the
Web site.
"If anyone still has doubts
about how valuable community
centers and student groups are to
the Stanford community, they
should consider that in the course
of 48 hours, a group of Stanford
students was able to organize, mo
bilize and activate a campaign to
get a national clothing retailer to
apologize for their racist prod
ucts," said coterminal student
John Lim.
Sophomore Sung Woo Cho
spoke with Hampton Carney, a
spokesperson for the company,
when he called to file a complaint.
" I wanted to get the message out to
Abercrombie that Stanford stu
dents had negative feelings about
the pictures and words on these T
shirts," Cho said.
According lo Cho, Carney of
fered him a personal apology and
said that the T-shirts were de
signed "only to give people a
chuckle."
In an article published in the
San Francisco Chronicle yester
day, Carney said, "We personally
thought Asians would love this T
shirt."
However, many Stanford stu
dents have expressed views con
trary to the expectations of the
company.
"These offensive T-shirts are in
dicative of the blind eye that Amer
ica continues to turn to racist por
trayals of Asian Americans," said
junior Toru Mino. "We should
take this opportunity to finally de

mand that these demeaning im
ages no longer be tolerated in
mainstream culture," he said.
Stanford students wanted not
only to talk about what was hap
pening but also wanted to organize
and plan an effective way to act
against the company. The agenda
for Wednesday night's meeting in
cluded coming up with a list of de
mands. Among these were a for
mal, public apology from the com
pany and a halt on production ol
the T-shirts.
"We are currently in the process
ofstrategizingan effective national
campaign surrounding this issue,"
Kirn said. "I've been talking about
this with student leaders around
the nation and they agree that we
must create a consolidated plan ol
action."
AASA is in the process of draft
ing a list of demands and a mis
sion statement. Once completed,
a "flexible plan of action to pres
sure Abercrombie to accept these
demands" must be created, Kim
said.
At the meeting, there was talk
of other demands. Sophomore
Christine Ku suggested that
Abercrombie & Fitch invest in
community programs that edu
cate the public about Asian-
American issues. There was also a
discussion about the lack of diver
sity iti the company's advertise
ments, quarterly catalogue and
hiring practices.
In the past, Abercrombie &
Fitch has received complaints
about its clothing and advertise
ments. According to the article in
The Chronicle, last year the com
pany "caught flak from some ac
tivist groups, and even state gov
ernments, for what they viewed as
sexually suggestive advertising
campaigns and catalog photos."
Carney admitted that Aber
crombie targets many groups in
their designs and advertisements.
"We poke fun at everybody,
from women, to flight attendants,
to baggage handlers, to football
coaches, to Irish Americans, to
snow skiers. There's reallv no

group we haven't teased." he told
The Chronicle.
AASA has decided to allot up to
$1000 to the campaign against
Abercrombie & Fitch. Most of the
money will be used to produce fly
ers, posters and banners; and to
provide transportation to rallies,
protests and other gatherings.
Sophomore Jeffrey Chang, the
AASA treasurer, expects the ex
penses to add up to around $200
but said AASA is willing to spend
"whatever it takes to support the
activism."
Yesterday, more than 20 Stan
ford students participated in a
rally in front of the Abercrombie &
Fitch store in San Francisco, orga
nized by the Chinatown Commu
nity Development Center. About
200 people were present in total. A
few speeches were made to the
crowd as flyers were handed out to
people on the street.
Kim said that support from
non-Asian-American groups, both
in and outside of Stanford, is es
sential. "Incidents of insensitivity
or outright racism and intolerance
affects all communities," he said.
