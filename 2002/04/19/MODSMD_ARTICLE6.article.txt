# Students protest clothing line

### CYNTHIA CHO EDITORIAL STAFF 
Early Tuesday morning, se
nior B J Lee was browsing the
Abercrombie 8c Fitch Web site
when he came across a T-shirt
that read, "Wong Brothers
Laundry Service — Two
Wongs Can Make It White."
Next to these words were two
smiling figures, with slanted
eyes and wearing rice-paddy
hats—reminiscent of 1900s
popular-culture depictions of
Chinese men.
Less than 48 hours later, over
75 students — of many racial
backgrounds — gathered
Wednesday night in the lounge
of Okada House, the Asian-
American theme house, to dis
cuss the company's line of T
shirts that portray Asian Ameri
cans in what many students have
called a stereotypical and
derogatory manner.
Another T-shirt reads,
"Wok-N-Bowl — Let the Good
Times Roll — Chinese Food 8c
Bowling."
"Abercrombie and Fitch Bud
dha Bash — Get Your Buddha
on the Floor," reads another.
The meeting was organized
and led by the Asian American
Students Association, at the re
quest of several students, and
lasted until 2 a.m. After Lee
discovered the T-shirts, he
sent out an e-mail to students
and student groups on cam
pus, including AASA, in which

he called the T-shirts a "slap in
the face to the Asian and Asian-
American communities."
Upon receipt of this e
mail — and subsequent e-mails
sent by other students in re
sponse — many students want
ed the opportunity to discuss
how to react to and take action
against Abercrombie 8c Fitch.
Between the time that Lee first
noticed the T-shirts and the
meeting held Wednesday night,
similar e-mails quickly spread
across the country.
"Several universities and or
ganizations learned of these T
shirts through that initial

spark," said AASA Chair Bryan
Kim, a sophomore. "[They]
noted the origin of the emails
and expected Stanford's AASA
to react. Student groups repre
senting dozens of universities
have already contacted me ask
ing what they can do.
"The community here,
which AASA is a part of, is ex
pected to lead some plan of ac
tion," he said.
At Wednesday's meeting,
AASA encouraged students to
call Abercrombie 8c Fitch to file
formal complaints. Yesterday,
