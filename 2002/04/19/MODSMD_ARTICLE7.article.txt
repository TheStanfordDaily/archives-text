# Off-campus bands strike a chord with students

While the Stanford Concert
Network is the campus's primary
provider of live music, a large stu
dent demand for independently
organized concerts has prompted
several houses and fraternities to
hunt down smaller bands and
bring them to campus.
This year Kappa Alpha hosted
The KGB and two weeks ago
Alpha Epsilon Pi brought Vegas
DeMilo. Additionally, Sigma Nu's
Moonsplash and Sunsplash par
ties included off-campus bands
The Basement, Viv and Lefter
Jett.
The demand for live music
seems to be as large as ever on cam
pus. Amid some students' grum
blings about the shows organized
by the concert network, some
groups have seen an opportunity
to bring in well-known bands of
their own accord.
'Hie concert network is officially
the only group on campus allowed
to organize concerts and it main
tains an operating budget that is
much larger than other student
groups. Yet there is "a general feel
ing that there aren't enough good
or at least well-known bands that
come to campus," said senior Guy
Marion of KA, who has organized
two KGB concerts at his house.
Because of smaller budgets, cam
pus groups are often limited to invit
ing smaller bands on the rise.
"The hard part is that you often
need a personal connection [to
bring big-name bands to cam
pus]," said Marion.
KA was able to secure The K( *B
last spring and again this fall

through a personal connection,
though it still had to pay a "large"
sum for the performance, accord
ing to Marion.
"Once a band has made it, they
won't usually play for less than
about $ 1,000," he said.
Yet there is substantial room for
negotiation when booking bands
on campus. When AEPi first tried
to get Vegas DeMilo to play, the
asking price was $ 1,000, according
to sophomore social chair Jeremy
Marcus. After a period of bargain
ing, AEPi brought both DeMilo
and its opening band Honeyspot
fora total of $200, not much more
than many houses pay profession
al DJ's. North of Cuba, a student
band, has received up to $350 for
shows in the past.
"A budget of less than $500 will
get you a lot of different bands,"
said sophomore Alejandro Foung
of Sigma Nu. "It takes work, but if
you have someone on the job it's
pretty easy. The hardest part is
knowing what bands to call."
Marion also points out that the
promise of a big venue with a lot of
publicity can significantly reduce
the cost of bringing up-and-com
ing bands to campus.
Students have praised the ef
forts of some houses and student
groups to bring outside bands to
campus and many houses have
found that the process is well
worth the effort.
"It's nice to get an actual band
to play a smaller party, but also fa
band] that's nationally known,"
said Marcus about Vegas DeMilo.
"(At larger venues] they don't
quite interact with the crowd in the
