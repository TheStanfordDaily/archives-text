# From E.T. to crustaceans
## 'Bits & Bytes' explores the wonderful worlds of red blood cells, million-year old skulls and the like 
### AMIT GARG STAFF WRITER 
Stanford researcher Mark A. Krasnow recently
announced evidence that blood vessels may have
evolved from blood cells. While studying how

developing blood cells migrate to

their proper destination in

fruit flies, Krasnow am

c< >lleagues discovered
the role of vascular
endothelial growth
factor proteins.
When the re
searchers blocked

these proteins, new

blood vessels did not form.

The scientists believe that

these proteins may have created a flow

map used by blood cells to reach different proteins
in the body. This map would be at the origin of the
circulatory system.
Krasnow emphasized that this is just the first step
in understanding how blood cells migrate. Studies
indicate there are many other signals involved in
their migration.
A newly found, million year-old skull in Africa
suggests that humans come from a single ancestor.
The skull belongs to a Homo erectus and dates
from the same time as the Homo erectus specimen
found in Asia.
W. Gilbert of UC-Berkeley, who uncovered the
fossil, claims that this provides evidence fort he idea
that a single species evolved into Homo sapiens.
Another theory claims that the Asian and African
hominids were two different species, and that the
Asian hominid died out and the African evolved
into the modern human species.
Anthropologists are excited with the find, but
some disagree with the theory that the African skull
shows differences from Asian equivalents.
Last year NASA announced the discovery of sug
ars in meteorites. Scientists have found sugars in
meteorites since the early 19605, but they were not
sure if these were traces of Earth bacteria.
George Gooper and colleagues confirmed that

some sugars had an extraterrestrial origin. Using
gas techniques such as chromatography and mass
spectography to identify components of a mixture,
the scientists determined that compounds present
in the meteorites had a larger percentage of rare
isotopes and isomers than Earth equivalents. Ihe
discovery confirms that basic nutritional ingredi
ents such as water, protein and sugar, can be car
ried across vast reaches of space.
Does this mean that life on Earth was originally
extraterrestrial? Not necessarily, because the same
processes that created the sugars in the

meteorites probably occurred

on our planet.

After the fall of
the Soviet Union,
many Russian sci
entists saw the dis
appearance of state
funding for their

research. Conse

quently, the United

States has tried to provide em

ployment for scientists, capitalize on
their expertise, and limit research for weapons of
mass destruction.
This has made possible various inventions, in
cluding the development of a high-speed needle
less injector that can vaccinate 600 people in an
hour. Commercialization was approved by the
Food and Drug Administration this year, and will
begin in 2004.
The injector project is one of 120 projects sup
ported by the $30 million Department of Defense
Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention program.
The number of insect species is exceptionally
high compared to others in the natural world. Sci
entists have attributed this diversity to the small size
and high adaptability of insects.
In the 19905, the presence of the Wolbachia bac
terium was discovered to affect an insect species' ca
pacity to reproduce. Researchers found that wasps
infected by the bacterium were unable to mate with
uninfected females, because the zygote component
of the bacterium was incompatible. Wasps infected
with the bacterium could only breed among them
selves, thus creating a new species.
Last year Hurst and colleagues in England an
nounced having observed Wolbachia in crus
taceans. They also estimated that more than 20 mil
lion species may harbor Wolbachia, suggesting that
scientists have only uncovered the tip of the iceberg.
