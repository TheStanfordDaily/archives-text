# Midway through Rush, Frats reflect
## 
### KRISTIN SCHLEICHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Monday marks the halfway
point of Fraternity Rush, and the
approximately 250 male partici
pants must seriously consider —
apart from thoughts of car
smashing, pool and barbeque —
where they would like to pledge.
This year, Rush has been
changed by the awarding of
University housing to Phi
Kappa Psi and Sigma Nu over
the next two years.
With Phi Psi occupying 592
Mayfield starting next fall, and
Sigma Nu moving into 557 May
field in the fall 0f2003, Stanford
will have reached its cap on
Creek houses. The recent
awards will bring the total num
ber of housed fraternities to
seven by 2003. Seven fraterni
ties remained unhoused.
Phi Psi Rush Chair David
Garfield, a junior, said that the
chapter spent an entire summer
"putting together an application
that demonstrates that the fra
ternity will give more to the
Stanford community than it will
take away by removing a house
from the general pool."
Among these benefits, said
Garfield, is a plan to reinstitute
the Phi Psi faculty speaker se
ries, a series of events similar to
faculty nights, but open to the
whole campus.
Garfield said that members
had been concerned about a
"slightly different emphasis" in
Rush fora housed fraternity,
but such concerns did not seem
to materialize.
"Fortunately, it's been much
the same type of people as previ
ous years. The people who are
coming are great."
Evan Fox, a sophomore in

Sigma Nu, also recognized
that challenge.
"This and next year, the
Rush process is really impor
tant to us," Fox said. "We want
to maintain the character of
the fraternity."
Fox predicted that the
promise of nice housing on cam
pus, even deferred a year, would
attract more rushees.
"A house offers a bigger cam
pus presence, better parties, a
central meeting place and a
place for alumni to return to,"
Fox said. "But if people join just
to be in the house it can alter the
composition of the fraternity."
With space for 42 residents,
557 Mayfield still won't house
the entire fraternity. Fox said
that priority would most likely
be given to the newest pledges,
but he didn't anticipate any new
quotas for Rush.
Much ado has been made
about the alcohol probation sta
tus of several fraternities, but
members reassured the student
body that Rush and fraternity
life would be unaffected.
Sigma Chi Rush Chair Brian
Kreiner, a senior, emphasized
that his organization "is not on
any sort of probation" and"the
rushees know that we are not
on probation."
The Creek Judicial Board
imposed a penalty on Sigma
Chi for an incorrectly regis
tered off-campus event at Com
padre's restaurant last quarter,
but this had nothing to do with
alcohol. Fraternity members
maintain that the policy viola
tion was unintentional.
As for the board ruling, the
sanction "does not really affect
us," Kreiner said.
Kappa Sigma had been under
probation for fall and winter
quarters.
"According to the terms of our
current probation, alcohol is pro
hibited at any chapter event
through the successful completion
ofßush," said Kyle Vataha, Kappa
Sig president. "This means that
our chapter will be off probation as
of April 30."
Since all Fraternity Rush events
are dry, Vataha continued, Kappa
Sig did not have to adapt its sched
ule of Rush events.
"Our strategy, similar to every
year, is to provide fun and interac

live events such as Thursday's Tri
cycle-Racing Contest and Mon
day's Mechanical Bull attraction,"
Vataha said. "It appears to me
from the turnout at Kappa
Sigma's events that there is a high
er level of participation this year in
comparison to last year."
Kappa Sig Rush Chair Keaton
Miller agreed.
"We have always relied on de
veloping solid, trusting relation
ships with rushees and showing
them what living in our house is all
about," said Miller, a sophomore.
"Although we have not been able
to host all-campus alcoholic parties
this year, the rushees know how
fun our parties will be and appre
ciate the other aspects of our fra
ternity that we have been able to
focus on this year."
