# Bio-X chief visualizes new lab plans
## Prof. Matthew Scott discusses plans for the Bio-X program and the Clark Center 
### JONATHAN OLSEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Matthew Scott, a professor of develop
mental biology and genetics at the School of
Medicine and the new head of the Bio-X pro
gram, spoke about the program Wednesday
as part of an event hosted by the Stanford
Biodesign club.
Graduate and undergraduate students
packed Herrin Hall to learn aboiit the pro

gram and how it will breathe life into the steel
skeleton of the $147 million James H. Clark
Center for Biomedical Engineering.
Scott explained the philosophy of Bio-X.
" There is a rapidly increasing awareness
that the genetic material is universal and that
animals and special processes give insight into
ns [as humans]," he said. "We must come at
biological problems with a lot of different
tools in fields as diverse as chemistry, com
puter science, engineering, physics and clini
cal science.
"A mutual exchange of ideas and perspec
tive is important, and we have the unique
ability at Stanford to do this," Scott contin
ued.
To overcome the segmented nature of

academia, many different types of labs in the
new center will come equipped with laser, ro
botics and chemistry facilities to foster collab
oration among departments and disciplines.
The School of Humanities and Sciences,
the School of Medicine, the School of Engi
neering and the School of Earth Sciences are
all part of the program, which will also gener
ate new areas of research such as biocompu
tation, biodesign, biophysics, chemical biolo
gy, regenerative medicine and genomics.
" There is an enormous amount of inter
disciplinary work already going on at Stan
ford," Scott said. "There are huge, unex
ploited opportunities that most people sim-
