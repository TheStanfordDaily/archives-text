# Bio-X chief visualizes new lab plans
## Prof. Matthew Scott discusses plans for the Bio-X program and the Clark Center 
### JONATHAN OLSEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Matthew Scott, a professor of develop
mental biology and genetics at the School of
Medicine and the new head of the Bio-X pro
gram, spoke about the program Wednesday
as part of an event hosted by the Stanford
Biodesign club.
Graduate and undergraduate students
packed Herrin Hall to learn aboiit the pro

gram and how it will breathe life into the steel
skeleton of the $147 million James H. Clark
Center for Biomedical Engineering.
Scott explained the philosophy of Bio-X.
" There is a rapidly increasing awareness
that the genetic material is universal and that
animals and special processes give insight into
ns [as humans]," he said. "We must come at
biological problems with a lot of different
tools in fields as diverse as chemistry, com
puter science, engineering, physics and clini
cal science.
"A mutual exchange of ideas and perspec
tive is important, and we have the unique
ability at Stanford to do this," Scott contin
ued.
To overcome the segmented nature of

academia, many different types of labs in the
new center will come equipped with laser, ro
botics and chemistry facilities to foster collab
oration among departments and disciplines.
The School of Humanities and Sciences,
the School of Medicine, the School of Engi
neering and the School of Earth Sciences are
all part of the program, which will also gener
ate new areas of research such as biocompu
tation, biodesign, biophysics, chemical biolo
gy, regenerative medicine and genomics.
" There is an enormous amount of inter
disciplinary work already going on at Stan
ford," Scott said. "There are huge, unex
ploited opportunities that most people sim-
ply don't know about. There are
also a considerable number of
people who want to do interdisci
plinary work."
"But there is a bureaucracy,"
he cautioned.
Scott, who is well known for
finding the genetic cause of basal
cell carcinoma, explained that dis
covery is ill-suited to industrial set
tings that do not allow the chaos
that is part of academic research.
"Discovery and invention are
based on education," Scott said,
stressing the importance of multi
ple mentors for people who want
to learn "a different mix of things

and who need Co know a subset of
what others know."
Research opportunities will be
available to undergraduate,
graduate and medical students
who will work with post-doctoral
and clinical fellows in teams of
multiple students.
Scott emphasized that stu
dents must act as bridges between
academic fields and "drive Bio-X
with their curiosity."
"The Clark Center construc
tion is on time and on budget,"
Scott said, "but it has been a dis
traction that hasn't left a lot of
time for most people to set up this
program and make it useful to
most people."
The building's "collaborato
ries" will hold 40 faculty and
groups from five departments:

physics, engineering, chemistry,
biology and clinical medicine.
"We came to a period of real
ization that you can't have a criti
cal mass of people in the build
ing," Scott said. "Instead, people
must serve as connectors with
others in the field and listen more
to colleagues next door."
To foster connections outside
Stanford, Bio-X is trying to set
aside 13 percent of the building
space lor sabbatical and transient
visitors, especially industrial affil
iates. This space would turn over
every three to 12 months in the
hopes of creating a network be
tween academia and industry.
Other new ideas include a
"bio-product realization lab"
open to all students that would
allow for tissue engineering and

other biological innovations.
Christine Quinn, one of the asso
ciate directors of the Biodesign
Program, described patent cre
ation stations, brainstorming
rooms and faculty offices that
will float as large cubicles in the
middle of the lab to increase col
laboration.
People will also be able to book
space beyond class time to exper
iment for several months.
Currently, four Bio-X fellows
have already been selected for
next year. More will come with
faculty recruitment. Scott and
Quinn spent the last 15 minutes
of the meeting emphasizing that
student feedback — especially
ideas related to the logistics and
design of Bio-X facilities — is es
sential and much appreciated.
