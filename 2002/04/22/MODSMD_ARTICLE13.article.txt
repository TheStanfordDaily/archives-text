## The 						Stanford Daily Join a University committee to make a difference 
### 
Published Since 1891

The deadline lor students to apply to
serve on University committees next
year is approaching. Students must
apply through the ASSU Nomina
tions Commission by April 24. We encourage
students to take advantage of this opportunity
to tangibly affect University policies.
The commission controls the appointment
of graduate and undergraduate students to
over 40 University committees. These com
mittees are under control of many offices,
from the Faculty Senate to the Vice Provost
for Student Affairs to the Board of Trustees.
The committees address topics as diverse as
academic standards, human subjects re
search and the alcohol policy.
These committees have a significant effect
on many aspects of University and student
life. For example, the proposal to eliminate
the major in Latin American Studies re
ceived final approval in the Faculty Senate's

Committee on Undergraduate Studies,
which has three student members. Likewise,
the Greek Judicial Board and its six under
graduate members imposes penalties on fra
ternities and sororities. Student input on
these committees is vital and the University
encourages it. Without student members,
student perspective will not be heard even on
exclusively student matters. Indeed, student
input on these committees is highly valued.
Generally, students are treated as equal
members, and faculty listen carefully to stu
dent concerns.
Often, policies and proposals are discussed
in depth at the committee level. The commit
tee shapes these important ideas in a way that
a larger body, such as the Faculty Senate, can
not. By serving on these committees, students
can make concrete suggestions that have a
good chance of showing up in the final plan.
The time commitment is not that large, ei

ther. Most committees meet only once or
twice per quarter fora couple hours. Some
individual preparation time is also required
to study the topics that the committee plans
to discuss. No student is so busy that he can
not spare an afternoon or two over a ten
week span.
These committees are also a way for stu
dents to serve the University. They work to
improve the University, and students can do
the same by serving on them. By sacrificing
no more than a couple hours of time, they
can make the University better for future stu
dents, faculty and staff.
Some people commonly complain about
the lack of "administrative accountability" in
University decisions, as though important
determinations were usually made by fiat or
formulated by a group of bureaucrats over
brandy and cigars in the back room of some
exclusive club. These people imagine "Win

ston" and "Montgomery," for example, arbi
trarily putting student groups on probation
or eliminating programs, and then chuckling
while downing highballs.
This, obviously, is not the case. In truth,
many decisions are carefully vetted by these
committees, including by the student mem
bers. Students frequently have the opportu
nity to review, comment and vote on these
changes. We can think of few other ways in
which the University could be any more ac
countable to its students.
So we encourage all students to apply fora
position on a University committee. The pro
cess is short and easy and the results, if you are
chosen, will be worthwhile. Applicants fill out
an online form and sit fora short interview with
the six members of the commission. The form
and a brief synopsis of each committee are lo
cated at assu.stanford.edu/nomcom. Apply and
help to shape the Stanford of the future.
