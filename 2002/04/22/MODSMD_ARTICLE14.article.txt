# CHASING MY TAIL
## The 						luxury of distance 
### 
Yesterday morning I woke up
and walked out the front door to
pick up the Sunday Sari Jose
Mercury News. Immediately I
was greeted by the advertising section,
which told me that Kmart is selling knit
tops for $4.99 this week. As 1 rummaged
for the comics, the front page somehow
surfaced, and its headline informed me
that most important thing that happened
today was that "E-mail users [are] plagued
by a rising tide of junk mail."
The "Local" section's "Special Report"
told me a story about a family that re
cently moved from the Bay Area to Ten
nessee and was having a hard time ad
justing. They'd never realized, I learned,
that California had such a wealth of di
versity and cultural events in comparison
to other states.
At the very bottom of the "Sunday" sec -
tion there appeared a much smaller article

entitled " Demonstrators
hit streets in S.F. rally for
Palestinians." Not quite
ready to break my Sunday
morning sleepiness with
news relating to conflict
and violence, I pushed it
aside and returned to my
comics. When I finally did
get around to reading

about the rally, I learned that there had
been 15,000 protesters. It was entirely
peaceful despite disrupting traffic, and a
handful of counter-protesters had thought
it "sad" that the marchers did not under
stand "what America stands for — free
dom." There was no mention of that fact
that "what America stands for" is a matter
under dispute.
I learned about a few of the things
speakers had said to the 15,000 demon
strators, like "Free, free Palestine" and
"It's the people — that's the only tiling
that ever changed things." But I didn't
learrl a thing about the protesters' specif
ic demands, nor about the complexity of
what's going on in the Middle East, just
as well, I thought. Wouldn't want to think
about anything too disturbing this early
in the morning.
But even when 1 decided yesterday af
ternoon to read the Mercury's second
place article on a "Bleak view of Mideast
conflict," it didn't seem to do much good.
I learned a lot about the official U.S. line,
and about whether or not "the public"
thinks peace can be brokered, even with
U.S. involvement. Hut really, I'd rather
not engage myself in such articles because
I know that what is printed I here is neither
the exact nor the whole truth. It's ex
hausting to try to read between the
lines — and in the end I probably won't
learn much more anyway. It's infinitely
more satisfying to read about families
moving to Tennessee — at least I know
they're telling the truth. Or if not, who re
ally cares? It's just not that important.
And that, my friends, is the luxury of

distance. I can get up, drink my orange
juice, and go to school without giving a
fhoughf to the violence that is happening
halfway around the world. Or, I can take
advantage of the freedoms I am told 1 have
— to assemble, to speak my mind in public.
1 can choose to have an opinion or not.
Here in this grand country, 1 can be
friends with someone who strongly op
poses my views on the matter — and
that's ok, we just don't have to talk about
it. We can laugh and gossip and go bar
hopping instead. Who wants to get in a
heated debate that'll just end in anger
and bad feelings? Who wants to put a
friendship on the line for that?
But for some of us, that distance is nonex
istent. For some of us, every stoiy in the
paper about the massacre in a refugee camp
or a suicide bombing directly affects our sis
ters, parents, cousins or friends. And for
some of us, every new development brings
the possibility of more harassment within
the United States. There are places in the
world where you just can't afford to be
friends with someone on the "wrong" side.
But here, where at least we have some
semblance of tolerance, we can do more. I
wish that even — or perhaps especially —
those of us for whom this is intensely per
sonal would take time to engage in con
versation. I see this happening, at rallies
and in dialogue groups, but not nearly
enough. We need not just debate, but re
ally listen, and get educated.
And not just on the facts. Sure, there
is an empirical truth out there — the
number of people who have died, the
number of homes demolished and so
forth. But there exist many, many other
truths in the form of different people's
consciousness. The emotions people feel
and their perceptions of why violence is
happening are important facts too. Emo
tions more than logic are the factors that
inform decisions, even decisions made
by governments and other leaders.
It's more than a little bit ridiculous to be
sitting here writing these thoughts, these
philosophies, when people are dying.
There are demonstrations to be held, calls
to representatives to be made, humanitar
ian volunteer posts to be filled. To think
that we might just sit down and talk things
out is idealistic, perhaps even insulting to
those who are putting themselves on the
line in order to work for their causes.
But better to start somewhere, to ask
questions, than to take to simply take an
opinion without examining the evi
dence. Or worse, do nothing at all.
In many ways, the luxury of distance
is a myth. The time is fast approaching
when acts of violence occur not "over
there," but right here. Oh wait, that's al
ready happening. So come on, it's high
time we started paying attention.
