Emeritus professor urges students to
come to Stanford, not Harvard
This is the time of year when top stu
dents who have been accepted at several
elite universities are wondering which to
choose. My advice: come to Stanford! In
the old days, Harvard was the most pres
tigious American university. It had an
outstanding faculty, and its social life was
traditionally dignified. Stanford was lo
cated in the wild West, whose 19th-cen
tury history was dominated by ruthless
gunmen. Stanford engineering students
boasted of their rough behavior.
How things have changed! Now black
activist Cornel West insults Harvard Pres
ident Lawrence Summers in the grossest
terms. He charged that Summers had in
sulted him by not calling the hospital soon
enough to wish him a prompt recovery
from an operation. To suggest that a uni
versity president should call all faculty
members who have had an operation sug
gests that he was being operated on for an
inflated ego. He contrasted the behavior
of Summers with that of top Princeton ad
ministrators, who called him repeatedly to
wish him well. Judging that the Princeton
climate is good for his moral condition, he
is moving there. Stanford faculty have ego
problems, but I have never seen anything
like this.
I do not know anyone at Stanford
who owns a gun. They are banned on
the Harvard campus, but the Harvard
Law School has a gun club with 120
members. Members go to a shooting
range in New Hampshire, where a sign
entices parents: "Children under 13
shoot for free." The Harvard Law Re
view ran an article "Discovering the joy
of a Semi-Automatic." Harvard men
may date women from Mount Holyoke,
where a gun club has some 50 members.
Moral: If you want a courteous, gun
free environment, come to Stanford!
Both the physical and the social climate
are better than at Harvard. The intel

lectual atmosphere is top-notch too.

• President Emeritus responds to
errors in Shea's letter
I've no quarrel with Patrick A. Shea's
conclusions about responsible student ac
tivism (The Daily, Apr. 18) — which em
body principles that guided his perfor
mance as a member of the ASSU Council
of Presidents over 30 years ago. But his
memory leads him astray on several fac
tual points.
The 1968 Old Union sit-in was not "the
first sit-in at Stanford": That was the occu
pation of the President's Office in the
Spring of 1966, just before Shea arrived as
a freshman. The target then was the ad
ministration by the University of Selective
Service draft examinations.
The 1968 sit-in, a far larger affair, was
not directly about recruiting policies at
the Placement Service, but about the stu
dent judicial system and the convictions
of several students for having tried to
block a CIA interviewer from doing on
campus recruiting.
Shea says that, after the sit-in and facul
ty vote, "Policies about recruiting were
changed." That is not true; on the con
trary, in the largest vote ever cast in an
ASSU primary, a referendum supported
by a nearly 6-to-l margin the proposition
that "all employers — not illegal in the
eyes of the civil courts — be allowed equal
access to recruiting facilities" at Stanford.
That had been and continued to be the
policy of the University.
It is true that the administration was
"shocked" by the faculty vote, but not by
the idea of "a protest effort, initiated by
students." That was, after all, scarcely a
new notion in 1968. What shocked us was
that the faculty would vote for amnesty
for those who had broken into Old Union

by force and occupied it for several days,
against the recommendations of their
own elected Executive Committee.
Finally, Shea demotes me (from
Provost, which I was, to Associate
Provost), and promotes and misnames
the distinguished professor of criminal
law, the late Herbert L. Packer (not
Packard), who was then Vice Provost.
As Yogi Berra might have put it, "Don't
trust your personal memory, especially
about the past."

President Emeritus:

Daily coverage of Israeli
Independence Day 'misleading'
The Daily's coverage of the Israeli Inde
pendence Day celebration and the pro-
Palestinian protest was misleading on sever
al counts. The Daily makes reference to a
"counter-protest" in its news article when, in
fact, the pro-Palestinian demonstrators
were the only protesters. Those who came
out to celebrate Israeli Independence Day
were not engaged in the act of political
protest. Those on the Israeli side of the
event made no direct, organized attempt to
express any partisan feelings regarding the
current operations of the Israeli govern
ment and made no attempt to distort the
history of the Palestinian people or under
mine their political position.
The protest was clearly an organized at
tempt to express feelings of hatred, albeit
restrained hatred, towards Israel. Just to
make sure that everybody understood their
point of view correctly, they made a partic
ular point to turn their backs at the playing
of the Israeli national anthem. They also
displayed mock coffins (only for Palestinian
victims, t hough) which t hey carried around
White plaza. Clearly it was an act only
meant to inflame, not to educate.
