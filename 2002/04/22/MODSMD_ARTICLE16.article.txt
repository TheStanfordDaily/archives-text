Emeritus professor urges students to
come to Stanford, not Harvard
This is the time of year when top stu
dents who have been accepted at several
elite universities are wondering which to
choose. My advice: come to Stanford! In
the old days, Harvard was the most pres
tigious American university. It had an
outstanding faculty, and its social life was
traditionally dignified. Stanford was lo
cated in the wild West, whose 19th-cen
tury history was dominated by ruthless
gunmen. Stanford engineering students
boasted of their rough behavior.
How things have changed! Now black
activist Cornel West insults Harvard Pres
ident Lawrence Summers in the grossest
terms. He charged that Summers had in
sulted him by not calling the hospital soon
enough to wish him a prompt recovery
from an operation. To suggest that a uni
versity president should call all faculty
members who have had an operation sug
gests that he was being operated on for an
inflated ego. He contrasted the behavior
of Summers with that of top Princeton ad
ministrators, who called him repeatedly to
wish him well. Judging that the Princeton
climate is good for his moral condition, he
is moving there. Stanford faculty have ego
problems, but I have never seen anything
like this.
I do not know anyone at Stanford
who owns a gun. They are banned on
the Harvard campus, but the Harvard
Law School has a gun club with 120
members. Members go to a shooting
range in New Hampshire, where a sign
entices parents: "Children under 13
shoot for free." The Harvard Law Re
view ran an article "Discovering the joy
of a Semi-Automatic." Harvard men
may date women from Mount Holyoke,
where a gun club has some 50 members.
Moral: If you want a courteous, gun
free environment, come to Stanford!
Both the physical and the social climate
are better than at Harvard. The intel

lectual atmosphere is top-notch too.

• President Emeritus responds to
errors in Shea's letter
I've no quarrel with Patrick A. Shea's
conclusions about responsible student ac
tivism (The Daily, Apr. 18) — which em
body principles that guided his perfor
mance as a member of the ASSU Council
of Presidents over 30 years ago. But his
memory leads him astray on several fac
tual points.
The 1968 Old Union sit-in was not "the
first sit-in at Stanford": That was the occu
pation of the President's Office in the
Spring of 1966, just before Shea arrived as
a freshman. The target then was the ad
ministration by the University of Selective
Service draft examinations.
The 1968 sit-in, a far larger affair, was
not directly about recruiting policies at
the Placement Service, but about the stu
dent judicial system and the convictions
of several students for having tried to
block a CIA interviewer from doing on
campus recruiting.
Shea says that, after the sit-in and facul
ty vote, "Policies about recruiting were
changed." That is not true; on the con
trary, in the largest vote ever cast in an
ASSU primary, a referendum supported
by a nearly 6-to-l margin the proposition
that "all employers — not illegal in the
eyes of the civil courts — be allowed equal
access to recruiting facilities" at Stanford.
That had been and continued to be the
policy of the University.
It is true that the administration was
"shocked" by the faculty vote, but not by
the idea of "a protest effort, initiated by
students." That was, after all, scarcely a
new notion in 1968. What shocked us was
that the faculty would vote for amnesty
for those who had broken into Old Union

by force and occupied it for several days,
against the recommendations of their
own elected Executive Committee.
Finally, Shea demotes me (from
Provost, which I was, to Associate
Provost), and promotes and misnames
the distinguished professor of criminal
law, the late Herbert L. Packer (not
Packard), who was then Vice Provost.
As Yogi Berra might have put it, "Don't
trust your personal memory, especially
about the past."
RICHARD W. I.YMAN
President Emeritus:

Daily coverage of Israeli
Independence Day 'misleading'
The Daily's coverage of the Israeli Inde
pendence Day celebration and the pro-
Palestinian protest was misleading on sever
al counts. The Daily makes reference to a
"counter-protest" in its news article when, in
fact, the pro-Palestinian demonstrators
were the only protesters. Those who came
out to celebrate Israeli Independence Day
were not engaged in the act of political
protest. Those on the Israeli side of the
event made no direct, organized attempt to
express any partisan feelings regarding the
current operations of the Israeli govern
ment and made no attempt to distort the
history of the Palestinian people or under
mine their political position.
The protest was clearly an organized at
tempt to express feelings of hatred, albeit
restrained hatred, towards Israel. Just to
make sure that everybody understood their
point of view correctly, they made a partic
ular point to turn their backs at the playing
of the Israeli national anthem. They also
displayed mock coffins (only for Palestinian
victims, t hough) which t hey carried around
White plaza. Clearly it was an act only
meant to inflame, not to educate.
The protesters, far from promoting
awareness, failed to articulate any view
point not very widely known by the bulk of
the Stanford community and were clearly
attempting to malign Israeli history.
Other signs making such statements as
"Sharon's a pig — he's not kosher" clearly
do not articulate any coherent arguments.
Regardless of the actual intentions of the
protesters, the message they sent was one of
hostility towards the existence of any sort a
Jewish sovereign state in the Middle East no
matter what the size.
True, Wednesday's protest was a very
positive contrast to the events that took
place on Holocaust Remembrance Day
at Berkeley last week in which the
Berkeley Hillel was vandalized,
protesters carried signs proclaiming

that "Jews are Nazis," and some 80 peo
ple were arrested. We should all be
grateful that those in White Plaza
showed a considerable amount of re
straint. Still, UC-Berkeley should be our
point of comparison on such matters.
The horrors of the Palestinian condition
must not go unnoticed and neither should
the tremendous threats to Israel's security.
The Daily correctly points out that people
do need to have awareness, but people also
need to have understanding.
Partisan sources do very little to gener
ate feelings of mutual respect. I challenge
anybody with strong feelings on these is
sues to go out and read an evenhanded,
scholarly book or two or even to take the
time to listen with respect to somebody
with a different viewpoint.
Peace can only come when people ac
knowledge the humanity of every single
person in this world.

Junior responds to
special fee endorsements
With regard to The Daily ratings of the
ASSLi special fees, I did not find the ratings
nearly as interesting as the responses to
them. Particularly, I found two letters pub
lished in the April 18 edition of The Daily to
be of great interest.
First, to the Stanford performing arts
groups: The presence of these organization
enriches the Stanford community as a
whole by bringing the arts to the local and
Stanford communities, not to mention the
international community. I challenge these
organizations to devote themselves even
more strongly to raising awareness of the
arts on campus.
Hopefully in this way these groups will
establish themselves as an unquestionably
vital and vibrant part of our community,
and will never have to face question in a spe
cial fees election again. These groups
should champion themselves: their hard

work justifies it.
Second, to the leaders of Asian American
Students Association, and to all ethnic and
cultural organizations on campus whose fee
request was listed as deserving "strong con
sideration."
This endorsement is not an attack on the
legitimacy of these organizations. Rather,
the leaders of these organizations should
receive it as a wake up call to re-evaluate
their mission and their role in the Stanford
community as a whole.
Recently the issue of ethnically based
organizations and entities such as ethnic
theme houses promoting insularity at
Stanford has been hotly debated. That
debate continues, as well as others related
to campus "diversity." AASA brought it-r
self to the forefront of this debate with the
events of last year and the adoption of a
conservative, insular stance toward the
community.
Most ethnic- or religious-themed or
ganizations stated in their special fees re

quest that the funds would be used for
programming for members of their spe
cific ethnic or cultural group on campus.
While I support and encourage this as a
means of celebrating your own unique
ness, please don't forget your responsi
bility to reach out to the rest of the com
munity.
I would like to challenge ethnic- and re
ligious-based organizations on campus to
resist the current trend of turning inward,
and instead to try to help "outsiders" un
derstand what makes you unique. If shar
ing with the community is not part of your
organizational mission, then please don't
misrepresent yourselves in your state
ments, bylaws, constitutions, or special
fees requests.
I'd like to encourage discussion of these
issues, so please direct comments to
mmassey@stanford.edu.

RICHARD W. I.YMAN
President Emeritus:

Daily coverage of Israeli
Independence Day 'misleading'
The Daily's coverage of the Israeli Inde
pendence Day celebration and the pro-
Palestinian protest was misleading on sever
al counts. The Daily makes reference to a
"counter-protest" in its news article when, in
fact, the pro-Palestinian demonstrators
were the only protesters. Those who came
out to celebrate Israeli Independence Day
were not engaged in the act of political
protest. Those on the Israeli side of the
event made no direct, organized attempt to
express any partisan feelings regarding the
current operations of the Israeli govern
ment and made no attempt to distort the
history of the Palestinian people or under
mine their political position.
The protest was clearly an organized at
tempt to express feelings of hatred, albeit
restrained hatred, towards Israel. Just to
make sure that everybody understood their
point of view correctly, they made a partic
ular point to turn their backs at the playing
of the Israeli national anthem. They also
displayed mock coffins (only for Palestinian
victims, t hough) which t hey carried around
White plaza. Clearly it was an act only
meant to inflame, not to educate.
The protesters, far from promoting
awareness, failed to articulate any view
point not very widely known by the bulk of
the Stanford community and were clearly
attempting to malign Israeli history.
Other signs making such statements as
"Sharon's a pig — he's not kosher" clearly
do not articulate any coherent arguments.
Regardless of the actual intentions of the
protesters, the message they sent was one of
hostility towards the existence of any sort a
Jewish sovereign state in the Middle East no
matter what the size.
True, Wednesday's protest was a very
positive contrast to the events that took
place on Holocaust Remembrance Day
at Berkeley last week in which the
Berkeley Hillel was vandalized,
protesters carried signs proclaiming

that "Jews are Nazis," and some 80 peo
ple were arrested. We should all be
grateful that those in White Plaza
showed a considerable amount of re
straint. Still, UC-Berkeley should be our
point of comparison on such matters.
The horrors of the Palestinian condition
must not go unnoticed and neither should
the tremendous threats to Israel's security.
The Daily correctly points out that people
do need to have awareness, but people also
need to have understanding.
Partisan sources do very little to gener
ate feelings of mutual respect. I challenge
anybody with strong feelings on these is
sues to go out and read an evenhanded,
scholarly book or two or even to take the
time to listen with respect to somebody
with a different viewpoint.
Peace can only come when people ac
knowledge the humanity of every single
person in this world.

Junior responds to
special fee endorsements
With regard to The Daily ratings of the
ASSLi special fees, I did not find the ratings
nearly as interesting as the responses to
them. Particularly, I found two letters pub
lished in the April 18 edition of The Daily to
be of great interest.
First, to the Stanford performing arts
groups: The presence of these organization
enriches the Stanford community as a
whole by bringing the arts to the local and
Stanford communities, not to mention the
international community. I challenge these
organizations to devote themselves even
more strongly to raising awareness of the
arts on campus.
Hopefully in this way these groups will
establish themselves as an unquestionably
vital and vibrant part of our community,
and will never have to face question in a spe
cial fees election again. These groups
should champion themselves: their hard

work justifies it.
Second, to the leaders of Asian American
Students Association, and to all ethnic and
cultural organizations on campus whose fee
request was listed as deserving "strong con
sideration."
This endorsement is not an attack on the
legitimacy of these organizations. Rather,
the leaders of these organizations should
receive it as a wake up call to re-evaluate
their mission and their role in the Stanford
community as a whole.
Recently the issue of ethnically based
organizations and entities such as ethnic
theme houses promoting insularity at
Stanford has been hotly debated. That
debate continues, as well as others related
to campus "diversity." AASA brought it-r
self to the forefront of this debate with the
events of last year and the adoption of a
conservative, insular stance toward the
community.
Most ethnic- or religious-themed or
ganizations stated in their special fees re

quest that the funds would be used for
programming for members of their spe
cific ethnic or cultural group on campus.
While I support and encourage this as a
means of celebrating your own unique
ness, please don't forget your responsi
bility to reach out to the rest of the com
munity.
I would like to challenge ethnic- and re
ligious-based organizations on campus to
resist the current trend of turning inward,
and instead to try to help "outsiders" un
derstand what makes you unique. If shar
ing with the community is not part of your
organizational mission, then please don't
misrepresent yourselves in your state
ments, bylaws, constitutions, or special
fees requests.
I'd like to encourage discussion of these
issues, so please direct comments to
mmassey@stanford.edu.
MICHAKL MASSEY
Junior, Asian iMngiiages and Literatures
Emeritus professor urges students to
come to Stanford, not Harvard
This is the time of year when top stu
dents who have been accepted at several
elite universities are wondering which to
choose. My advice: come to Stanford! In
the old days, Harvard was the most pres
tigious American university. It had an
outstanding faculty, and its social life was
traditionally dignified. Stanford was lo
cated in the wild West, whose 19th-cen
tury history was dominated by ruthless
gunmen. Stanford engineering students
boasted of their rough behavior.
How things have changed! Now black
activist Cornel West insults Harvard Pres
ident Lawrence Summers in the grossest
terms. He charged that Summers had in
sulted him by not calling the hospital soon
enough to wish him a prompt recovery
from an operation. To suggest that a uni
versity president should call all faculty
members who have had an operation sug
gests that he was being operated on for an
inflated ego. He contrasted the behavior
of Summers with that of top Princeton ad
ministrators, who called him repeatedly to
wish him well. Judging that the Princeton
climate is good for his moral condition, he
is moving there. Stanford faculty have ego
problems, but I have never seen anything
like this.
I do not know anyone at Stanford
who owns a gun. They are banned on
the Harvard campus, but the Harvard
Law School has a gun club with 120
members. Members go to a shooting
range in New Hampshire, where a sign
entices parents: "Children under 13
shoot for free." The Harvard Law Re
view ran an article "Discovering the joy
of a Semi-Automatic." Harvard men
may date women from Mount Holyoke,
where a gun club has some 50 members.
Moral: If you want a courteous, gun
free environment, come to Stanford!
Both the physical and the social climate
are better than at Harvard. The intel

lectual atmosphere is top-notch too.
RONALD HILTON
Professor Emeritus, Humanities and Sciences
• President Emeritus responds to
errors in Shea's letter
I've no quarrel with Patrick A. Shea's
conclusions about responsible student ac
tivism (The Daily, Apr. 18) — which em
body principles that guided his perfor
mance as a member of the ASSU Council
of Presidents over 30 years ago. But his
memory leads him astray on several fac
tual points.
The 1968 Old Union sit-in was not "the
first sit-in at Stanford": That was the occu
pation of the President's Office in the
Spring of 1966, just before Shea arrived as
a freshman. The target then was the ad
ministration by the University of Selective
Service draft examinations.
The 1968 sit-in, a far larger affair, was
not directly about recruiting policies at
the Placement Service, but about the stu
dent judicial system and the convictions
of several students for having tried to
block a CIA interviewer from doing on
campus recruiting.
Shea says that, after the sit-in and facul
ty vote, "Policies about recruiting were
changed." That is not true; on the con
trary, in the largest vote ever cast in an
ASSU primary, a referendum supported
by a nearly 6-to-l margin the proposition
that "all employers — not illegal in the
eyes of the civil courts — be allowed equal
access to recruiting facilities" at Stanford.
That had been and continued to be the
policy of the University.
It is true that the administration was
"shocked" by the faculty vote, but not by
the idea of "a protest effort, initiated by
students." That was, after all, scarcely a
new notion in 1968. What shocked us was
that the faculty would vote for amnesty
for those who had broken into Old Union

by force and occupied it for several days,
against the recommendations of their
own elected Executive Committee.
Finally, Shea demotes me (from
Provost, which I was, to Associate
Provost), and promotes and misnames
the distinguished professor of criminal
law, the late Herbert L. Packer (not

establish themselves as an unquestionably
vital and vibrant part of our community,
and will never have to face question in a spe
cial fees election again. These groups
should champion themselves: their hard

work justifies it.
Second, to the leaders of Asian American
Students Association, and to all ethnic and
cultural organizations on campus whose fee
request was listed as deserving "strong con
sideration."
This endorsement is not an attack on the
legitimacy of these organizations. Rather,
the leaders of these organizations should
receive it as a wake up call to re-evaluate
their mission and their role in the Stanford
community as a whole.
Recently the issue of ethnically based
organizations and entities such as ethnic
theme houses promoting insularity at
Stanford has been hotly debated. That
debate continues, as well as others related
to campus "diversity." AASA brought it-r
self to the forefront of this debate with the
events of last year and the adoption of a
conservative, insular stance toward the
community.
Most ethnic- or religious-themed or
ganizations stated in their special fees re

quest that the funds would be used for
programming for members of their spe
cific ethnic or cultural group on campus.
While I support and encourage this as a
means of celebrating your own unique
ness, please don't forget your responsi
bility to reach out to the rest of the com
munity.
I would like to challenge ethnic- and re
ligious-based organizations on campus to
resist the current trend of turning inward,
and instead to try to help "outsiders" un
derstand what makes you unique. If shar
ing with the community is not part of your
organizational mission, then please don't
misrepresent yourselves in your state
ments, bylaws, constitutions, or special
fees requests.
I'd like to encourage discussion of these
issues, so please direct comments to
mmassey@stanford.edu.
