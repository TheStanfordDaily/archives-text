# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## We're missing out: United States should join the party at the ICC 
### ROB GAUDET GUEST COLUMNIST 
Guest columnist David Davenport of
the Hoover Institution is light to say that
"they threw a party at the United Nations
recently, but the United States did not at
tend" (The Daily, Apr. 18). Sadly, every
thing else iu his column is off the mark and
it does a disservice to the intelligent dis
course that usually appears within the
pages of The Stanford Daily.
The International Criminal Court has
been signed and ratified by almost all of
our major allies: France, Germany, the
United Kingdom, and Canada. The "axis
of evil" nations have not signed on to the
court and that fact, very curiously, places
the United States in the company of Iran,
Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Davenport thinks our omission is a cause
for celebration. 1 find it to be a disgrace.
The court is a party that we should be at
tending. After all, we are responsible for the
precedents — the Nuremberg and Tokyo
trials, the International Criminal Tribune
for the former Yugoslavia, the Internation
al Criminal Tribune for Rwanda — and
the international court has been shaped in

the image of our own legal traditions. It
provides for the right to remain silent, the
right to have legal counsel, the right to due
process and other guarantees from Anglo-
American jurisprudence.
The court is a safety net that ensures dic
tators, war crimes violators and renegades
will not fall through the cracks of incapable
domestic judicial systems. The real targets
of the court are lawless nations and corrupt
environments where justice is no longer
available. The court does not approach civ
ilized countries with an effective judiciary,
competent lawyers and a true sense of jus
tice. Americans are, de facto, excluded
from the authority of the court because
they bring their own criminals to justice.
For three reasons outlined below, Amer
icans would never be hauled into court.
First, our soldiers know how to follow inter
national rules of warfare. The Geneva Con
vention i ules of war are taught in our mili
tary academies and followed in the field of
battle. American soldiers don't even know
how to torture any more. As a result of their
professional training and experience,
American soldiers are not likely to commit
acts that would lead to court investigation.
Second, even if they did, they would be

excluded from the international court's
prosecution because American domestic
and military tribunals would have exclu
sive jurisdiction. The court will not investi
gate when "[t]he case is being investigated
or prosecuted by a State which has juris
diction over it" (Article 17(1 )(a)). TFur
thermore, a case is inadmissible when the
United States has investigated and "decid
ed not to prosecute."
These provisions respect American
sovereignty. Realistically, the only people
subject to the court are warlords in law
less nations, corrupt military officials and
dictators like Saddam Hussein. The only
conditions where it would be able to con
duct an investigation without approval
are in those countries without any com
petent judicial system. Any nation can re
quest the court to defer an investigation.
Fhe U.N. Security Council has unquali
fied power to halt court investigations.
Unfortunately, Davenport omits any ref
erence to these checks and balances.
Third, the court has the power to "make
requests to State Parties for cooperation" by
transmitting such requests through "the
diplomatic channel or any other appropri
ate channel." In addition, it "may" do the

following tilings: "invite" a State to assist,
"ask any interngovernmental organiza
tion" for information, tattle on uncoopera
tive states, "transmit a request" for the ar
rest of a criminal, and make resolutions.
What it may not do is more interest
ing. It cannot enforce resolutions, in
vade American soil to obtain evidence,
take someone into custody with its own
personnel, conduct any "unreasonable
seizure" (one of Davenport's fears), or
haul anyone into jail. There is no real'
power for the court to do anything on its
own without the cooperation of nations.
It has no enforcement mechanism. It
only has the power to "invite" and "ask"
and "request."
One would expect a greater degree of
intellectual honesty from Davenport. As a
lawyer, he should be familiar with these
provisions of the court. Nevertheless, he
tries to frighten readers that they'll lose
"protections afforded by the U.S. Consti
tution." To the contrary, the court woultl
spread Ametican principles around the
world and provide some sense of justice to
people in lawless nations who live under
the mercy of every kid with a gun.
The court is a historic opportunity for

Americans to lead an international coali
tion for the investigation and prosecu
tion of the worst human rights violations
in places like Iraq and Afghanistan. If
the court were up and running today,
there would be no need for Bush's con
troversial military tribunals which have
refused detainees the most basic consti
tutional guarantees such as the right to
counsel. Ironically, Davenport supports
the military tribunals ("Tribunals pro
vide justice terrorists deserve," Ventura
County Star, Dec. 9, 2001) even though
he opposes the court.
The court embodies many of the Amer
ican constitutional values, such as the right
to counsel and the right to remain silent,
that are not present in the American mili
tary tribunals intended for detainees in
Guantanamo Bay. We should not lose
sight of the constitutional values that make
the United States worth fighting for — es
pecially when those values are adopted by
the rest of the world, embodied in a new
institution and reflected back upon us as a
reminder of our better selves.

rest of a criminal, and make resolutions.
What it may not do is more interest
ing. It cannot enforce resolutions, in
vade American soil to obtain evidence,
take someone into custody with its own
personnel, conduct any "unreasonable
seizure" (one of Davenport's fears), or
haul anyone into jail. There is no real'
power for the court to do anything on its
own without the cooperation of nations.
It has no enforcement mechanism. It
only has the power to "invite" and "ask"
and "request."
One would expect a greater degree of
intellectual honesty from Davenport. As a
lawyer, he should be familiar with these
provisions of the court. Nevertheless, he
tries to frighten readers that they'll lose
"protections afforded by the U.S. Consti
tution." To the contrary, the court woultl
spread Ametican principles around the
world and provide some sense of justice to
people in lawless nations who live under
the mercy of every kid with a gun.
The court is a historic opportunity for

Americans to lead an international coali
tion for the investigation and prosecu
tion of the worst human rights violations
in places like Iraq and Afghanistan. If
the court were up and running today,
there would be no need for Bush's con
troversial military tribunals which have
refused detainees the most basic consti
tutional guarantees such as the right to
counsel. Ironically, Davenport supports
the military tribunals ("Tribunals pro
vide justice terrorists deserve," Ventura
County Star, Dec. 9, 2001) even though
he opposes the court.
The court embodies many of the Amer
ican constitutional values, such as the right
to counsel and the right to remain silent,
that are not present in the American mili
tary tribunals intended for detainees in
Guantanamo Bay. We should not lose
sight of the constitutional values that make
the United States worth fighting for — es
pecially when those values are adopted by
the rest of the world, embodied in a new
institution and reflected back upon us as a
reminder of our better selves.

Guest columnist David Davenport of
the Hoover Institution is light to say that
"they threw a party at the United Nations
recently, but the United States did not at
tend" (The Daily, Apr. 18). Sadly, every
thing else iu his column is off the mark and
it does a disservice to the intelligent dis
course that usually appears within the
pages of The Stanford Daily.
The International Criminal Court has
been signed and ratified by almost all of
our major allies: France, Germany, the
United Kingdom, and Canada. The "axis
of evil" nations have not signed on to the
court and that fact, very curiously, places
the United States in the company of Iran,
Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Davenport thinks our omission is a cause
for celebration. 1 find it to be a disgrace.
The court is a party that we should be at
tending. After all, we are responsible for the
precedents — the Nuremberg and Tokyo
trials, the International Criminal Tribune
for the former Yugoslavia, the Internation
al Criminal Tribune for Rwanda — and
the international court has been shaped in

the image of our own legal traditions. It
provides for the right to remain silent, the
right to have legal counsel, the right to due
process and other guarantees from Anglo-
American jurisprudence.
The court is a safety net that ensures dic
tators, war crimes violators and renegades
will not fall through the cracks of incapable
domestic judicial systems. The real targets
of the court are lawless nations and corrupt
environments where justice is no longer
available. The court does not approach civ
ilized countries with an effective judiciary,
competent lawyers and a true sense of jus
tice. Americans are, de facto, excluded
from the authority of the court because
they bring their own criminals to justice.
For three reasons outlined below, Amer
icans would never be hauled into court.
First, our soldiers know how to follow inter
national rules of warfare. The Geneva Con
vention i ules of war are taught in our mili
tary academies and followed in the field of
battle. American soldiers don't even know
how to torture any more. As a result of their
professional training and experience,
American soldiers are not likely to commit
acts that would lead to court investigation.
Second, even if they did, they would be

excluded from the international court's
prosecution because American domestic
and military tribunals would have exclu
sive jurisdiction. The court will not investi
gate when "[t]he case is being investigated
or prosecuted by a State which has juris
diction over it" (Article 17(1 )(a)). TFur
thermore, a case is inadmissible when the
United States has investigated and "decid
ed not to prosecute."
These provisions respect American
sovereignty. Realistically, the only people
subject to the court are warlords in law
less nations, corrupt military officials and
dictators like Saddam Hussein. The only
conditions where it would be able to con
duct an investigation without approval
are in those countries without any com
petent judicial system. Any nation can re
quest the court to defer an investigation.
Fhe U.N. Security Council has unquali
fied power to halt court investigations.
Unfortunately, Davenport omits any ref
erence to these checks and balances.
Third, the court has the power to "make
requests to State Parties for cooperation" by
transmitting such requests through "the
diplomatic channel or any other appropri
ate channel." In addition, it "may" do the

following tilings: "invite" a State to assist,
"ask any interngovernmental organiza
tion" for information, tattle on uncoopera
tive states, "transmit a request" for the ar
rest of a criminal, and make resolutions.
What it may not do is more interest
ing. It cannot enforce resolutions, in
vade American soil to obtain evidence,
take someone into custody with its own
personnel, conduct any "unreasonable
seizure" (one of Davenport's fears), or
haul anyone into jail. There is no real'
power for the court to do anything on its
own without the cooperation of nations.
