## Huskies bite Stanford for series victory 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIORS STAFF WRITER 
SEA'I' I LE — On the scorecard, it looked
like a standard triple. But for the second
ranked Cardinal, freshman outfielder
Danny Putnam's three-bagger down the
right field line on Saturday represented the
turning point in the only game that Stanford
could salvage against Washington in a series
that severely damaged its chances to win the
2002 Pacific 10 Conference crown.
Putnam's first hit of the. series awak
ened the rest of the Stanford bats and
began a late-inning comeback on Saturday
that gave the Cardinal a 9-4 win, the lone
victory for Stanford (27-10, 5-4 Pac-10)
over the weekend in the Northwest. With
the pair of disappointing losses to the
mediocre I luskies (17-18-1,5-4), Stanford
sits 2 1/2 games behind first-place South
ern California in the conference race.
Putnam battled Washington reliever
David Dowling in a magnificent seventh
inning at-bat in the second game of the se
ries, coming back from an 0-2 before final
ly getting Dowling to give in on his eighth
pitch of the at-bat.
"He threw a lot of good pitches and I
was trying to foul them off until I got a good
one that I could handle, and he ended up
bringing one inside," Putnam said. "I bat
tled for that one big time, and it was great
to come through."
Senior second baseman Chris O'Rior
dan drove Putnam home on the next pitch
to tie the game at four, and the Cardinal
would go on to score five more runs on
seven hits in the final two innings to secure
a key Pac-10 victory.
Senior Arik VanZandt, a Seattle native
and playing in front of a throng of family and
friends at Husky Stadium, provided the go
ahead RBI in the eighth inning with a single
to center field.
Sophomore outfielder Brian Hall drove
home two runs with a ninth-inning triple off

the left-center field wall, exploiting an oppo
site-field shift that the Huskies employed for
most of the series.
Washington pitchers worked all Stanford
hitters away and coupled that strategy with
the shift, enticing them with a huge power
field gap but rarely challenging t he Cardinal
on t he inside portion of the plate.
"They've got some good scouting reports
that we're going to hit the ball where it's
pitched, but as soon as they make a mistake
we're going to take advantage of" it," said
Hall, who pounded Husky pitching on his 2-
for-5 Saturday with three hard-hit balls, one
of which he drove deep to left but was
knocked down by die strong wind.
Senior Dan Rich provided 4 2/3 innings of
scoreless relief, piling up a career-high six
strikeouts en route to his first win since 1999.
Rich shut down a Husky offense that chased
junior starter Tim Cunningham after just
two-plus innings.
Cunningham was wild for the second
straight start, surrendering three runs while
walking three and hitting two after giving up
eight runs in one inning against USC last
weekend.
Though lacking solid control, Cunning
ham and freshman reliever Markjecman es
caped jams in the first three Husky innings
and limited the damage to just three runs.
"We got out of a lot of big spots today,"
Marquess said. "They had a chance to break
the game open early, but they didn't."
Putnam's triple and the Saturday win
could not have come at a better time for Sum
ford, which spoiled an outstanding effort
from junior starter Jeremy Cuthrie the night
before to drop its first series opener of the
season, 3-1.
Guthrie motored through six innings of
dominant work on Friday, striking out seven
and holding the Washington order to just
two hits in a pitching duel with Husky starter
Shawn Kohn. However, Marquess replaced
Guthrie in the seventh with junior Ryan Mc-
Cally, who tcx>k the loss after issuing two

walks and allowing two singles that gave the
Huskies a 2-1 lead.
While Guthrie was on his way to his best
performance of the season on the hill, the
cold Seattle temperature and Guthrie's ex
cessive pitch counts the two previous weeks
led Marquess to make the difficult and ques
tionable — but nonetheless justifiable — de
cision to pull his ace in a 1-0 ballgame.
Guthrie "was a little sore, nothing serious,
and it was tough to pitch with the cold weath
er tonight," Marquess siiid. "I didn't want to
take any chances with him."
Guthrie added: "It was cold and it was
hard for me to get stretched out real well, so
1 didn't think it would be good to push it."

Officially listed as bothered by a sore back
muscle, Guthrie did not evidence any visible
signs of pain and both he and Marquess reit
erated that the problem was minor. In
Guthrie's final inning on the mound, the
sixth, he worked through three Washington
batters in little more than two minutes and
looked as sharp as he had been all year.
Guthrie said yesterday that he will
make his scheduled start Friday night at
Oregon State.
The surprise exit by Guthrie opened the
door tor a Washington rally, as the inconsis
tent Stanford bullpen could not slam the

Junior Jason Cooper and the baseball team battled cold weather and stiff competition this
weekend as the Cardinal faced Washington. The team dropped two games to the Huskies
and snapped its streak of 12 consecutive regular-season series victories.
door. McCally surrendered two
runs and junior Darin Naatjes, who
walked two of the three battels he
faced, gave up one.
Kohn, the Huskies' ace, used
pinpoint control to subdue Stan
ford batters in a complete-game six
hitter. Kohn hit almost all of his
spots Friday night, enabling him to
limit a potent Cardinal offense to
one run without featuring any

dominating pitches.
"We couldn't get anything going
off [ Kohn] ail night," Marquess said.
"He changed speeds really well and
pitched a great game."
Yesterday in the series finale,
Kohn's success continued in a 4-3
Washington victory in 10 innings.
He entered a tie ballgame as a reliev
er in the ninth and pitched two
scoreless innings for his second win
of the series.
Kohn baffled the Cardinal fora
combined 11 innings in the series
despite lacking impressive stuff,
only striking out three but limiting

Stanford batters to seven hits
against him.
"I don't really know how to ex
plain it," said junior catcher Ryan
Garko. "1 don't think he's got in
credible stuff. He's not the best pitch
er we've seen this year, but he did a
good job and he's got a weird arm
angle. We just need to pick it up as a
team because we had a pcx>r show
ing all weekend."
Washington won it in the 10th in
ning on freshman Kyle Larsen's
RBI single just past O'Riordan up
the middle with one out, stealing the
game and coming up with a huge

series win over the No. 2 team in the
nation.
The Huskies benefited from a
questionable call in ihe eighth when
Stanford center fielder Sam Fuld
came up with a phenomenal throw
to third base and seemingly cut
down the lead Washington runner
after a single.
However, third base umpire
Kevin Bailey called the runner safe
after what appeared to be a certain
tag from third baseman Van-
Zandt, leaving just one out and
runners at second and third with
the Cardinal dugout steaming.

The Huskies would bring home
the run two batters later to tie the
game at three.
Trailing 1-0 in the seventh, the
Cardinal got a home run off the bat
of Garko to knot the game and pick
up some momentum. An inning
later, Stanford took a 3-1 lead on a
Putnam sacrifice (ly and an O'Rior
dan single.
Hie Huskies then answered in
their half of the inning, getting a
leadoff home run oil McCally and
then taking advantage of the Bailey
call at third before ending it in the
extra frame.
