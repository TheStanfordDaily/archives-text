# Tennis drops third straight
## 
### JERRY LU STAFF WRITER 
After a long and grueling campaign, the
Stanford men's tennis team (19-5, 5-2 Pacific
10 Conference) had one more battle to fight
against conquerors from the south. Unfortu
nately, the attrition of war had already taken
its toll from the defenders of the Farm.
This season, the number of injuries the
Stanford squad has suffered is nothing short
of remarkable. Despite missing No. 4 K..J.
Hippensteel due to a strained back and los
ing junior Carter Morris for the year, Stan
ford managed to play a full roster during
both matches this weekend. The Cardinal
avoided Tuesday's predicament against Pep
perdine, in which it was forced to forfeit two
points'due to a lack of players.
Saturday's loss to Southern California
places Stanford in a three-way tie with
USC and California for second place in
the Pac-10 with a 5-2 record. With Stan
ford's loss, UCLA clinched the conference
championship, despite losing to Califor
nia on Saturday.
Stanford first faced off against No. 2
UCLA (19-4, (i-l Pac-10) in what shaped up
to be a perfect, sunny Friday. Although all
the Stanford players expected a tough
match, the intensity of the doubles games
surpassed everyone's expectations.
"Everybody stepped up," said associate
head coach John Whitlinger. "It's tough
playing without your number-one player,

but we still competed very well and gave (lie
game a great shot."
All three of the doubles matches saw mul
tiple swings of momentum. Backed by a
large and vocal contingent of supporters, the
previously first-ranked duo of juniors Scott
Lipsky and David Martin were extremely
sharp. They quickly raced ahead two breaks
over the current number one tandem of
Mart in Matkowski and Jean-Julien Rojer of
UCLA, only to see their lead evaporate to a
7-7 tie. Pulling out two hard-fought games,
Lipsky and Martin were able to capture the
set, 9-7.
Second and third doubles were as fiercely
contested. Playing on court three, sopho
more Joe Kao and freshman Phil Sheng
jumped to a 3-1 lead, but then struggled to
stem a Bruin resurgence. Down 6-3, the Car
dinal team was able to even the score, but was
finally outdone, 9-7. The final and deciding
doubles match rested on junior Ryan Havi
land and freshman Sam Warburg, who
pulled ahead from a protracted, see-sawing
battle to capture the point, 8-5.
The doubles matches set the devil-may
care mentality that c haracterized the singles
play. In a battle that featured seven ranked
players out of the 12 playing, UCLA was able
to overcome the early deficit and capture
four of six possible singles points.
On court one, No. 37 Martin, covering for
the injured Hippensteel, easily upset No. 6

Freshman Sam Warburg rallied back from a first-set drubbing to crush Trojan Erfan Djahengiri,
0-6, 6-0, 6-0. Stanford fell 4-3 to USC during Saturday's match.
