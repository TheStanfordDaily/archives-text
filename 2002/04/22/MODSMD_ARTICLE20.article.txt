# Tennis drops third straight
## 
### JERRY LU STAFF WRITER 
After a long and grueling campaign, the
Stanford men's tennis team (19-5, 5-2 Pacific
10 Conference) had one more battle to fight
against conquerors from the south. Unfortu
nately, the attrition of war had already taken
its toll from the defenders of the Farm.
This season, the number of injuries the
Stanford squad has suffered is nothing short
of remarkable. Despite missing No. 4 K..J.
Hippensteel due to a strained back and los
ing junior Carter Morris for the year, Stan
ford managed to play a full roster during
both matches this weekend. The Cardinal
avoided Tuesday's predicament against Pep
perdine, in which it was forced to forfeit two
points'due to a lack of players.
Saturday's loss to Southern California
places Stanford in a three-way tie with
USC and California for second place in
the Pac-10 with a 5-2 record. With Stan
ford's loss, UCLA clinched the conference
championship, despite losing to Califor
nia on Saturday.
Stanford first faced off against No. 2
UCLA (19-4, (i-l Pac-10) in what shaped up
to be a perfect, sunny Friday. Although all
the Stanford players expected a tough
match, the intensity of the doubles games
surpassed everyone's expectations.
"Everybody stepped up," said associate
head coach John Whitlinger. "It's tough
playing without your number-one player,

but we still competed very well and gave (lie
game a great shot."
All three of the doubles matches saw mul
tiple swings of momentum. Backed by a
large and vocal contingent of supporters, the
previously first-ranked duo of juniors Scott
Lipsky and David Martin were extremely
sharp. They quickly raced ahead two breaks
over the current number one tandem of
Mart in Matkowski and Jean-Julien Rojer of
UCLA, only to see their lead evaporate to a
7-7 tie. Pulling out two hard-fought games,
Lipsky and Martin were able to capture the
set, 9-7.
Second and third doubles were as fiercely
contested. Playing on court three, sopho
more Joe Kao and freshman Phil Sheng
jumped to a 3-1 lead, but then struggled to
stem a Bruin resurgence. Down 6-3, the Car
dinal team was able to even the score, but was
finally outdone, 9-7. The final and deciding
doubles match rested on junior Ryan Havi
land and freshman Sam Warburg, who
pulled ahead from a protracted, see-sawing
battle to capture the point, 8-5.
The doubles matches set the devil-may
care mentality that c haracterized the singles
play. In a battle that featured seven ranked
players out of the 12 playing, UCLA was able
to overcome the early deficit and capture
four of six possible singles points.
On court one, No. 37 Martin, covering for
the injured Hippensteel, easily upset No. 6


MATT SAYLES/The Stanford Daily
Freshman Sam Warburg rallied back from a first-set drubbing to crush Trojan Erfan Djahengiri,
0-6, 6-0, 6-0. Stanford fell 4-3 to USC during Saturday's match.
Tobias Clemens, 6-3, 6-4. Howev
er, No. 23 Marcin Matkowski
struck quickly and never let al
lowed No. 76 Haviland to climb
back. Sheng, still playing fourth
singles, was outslugged, 6-1,6-3 by
No. 58 Rodrigo Grilli, while Bruin
Lassi Ketola, playing in the sixth
slot, outfought Joe Kao 6-2, 6-1.
With the Cardinal down 3-2 the
match rested on the final two singles
matches. Warburg overcame an 6-0
drubbing the first set, and returned
with a vengeance, crushing Erfan
Djahengiri 6-0, 6-0, taking the
point. However, despite playing
well, No. 59 Lipsky was downed by
No. 115 Rojer, 7-5,6-4.
Hie next day, the Cardinal host
ed No. 13 USC (19-5,5-2 Pac-10) in
another emotionally charged
match that marked the final regu
lar-season game for both teams.
In contrast to the day before, the
Cardinal soon found itself battling
back from an early doubles deficit.
Lipsky and Martin, coming off of
their victory against the top-ranked
doubles team, could not hold off
No. 7 Ryan Moore and Nicholas
Rainy, who outlasted the Stanford
duo, 8-6, while Haviland and War
burg, both battling injuries, were

topped by Teige Sulliven and
Ruben Torres, 8-5. Kao and Sheng
captured the lone (Cardinal doubles
vic tory with a 9-7 win.
With a large crowd looking on,
the Cardinal entered singles play
with the understanding that victo
ry would not be easily wrested from
the experienced Trojan squad.
Martin, once again playing in
the top spot, was defeated by No. 29
Andrew Park, 6-3, 6-4, while Joe
Kao fell to Torres, (i-2, 6-2. The
Cardinal recaptured the points
with Haviland upsetting No. #66
Prakash Amritaj, and Warburg
downing Daniel Langre 6-3,6-4.
In perhaps the most impressive
match of the day, Sheng demon
strated incredible resolve and stay
ing power in a 6-2, 6-7, 6-3 upset
ting of No. 47 Rainy.
"I'm proud of how [Sheng]
played," said Whitlinger. "Phil's
been playing well lately, and is very
capable of beating almost anybody
out there."
Once again, the score was tied
3-3, with one match to play. Last
ing long after all the other games
had been decided, the crowd, play
ers, and coaches concentrated
solely on the gladiatorial battle
being fought on court two between
Lipsky and Moore. After losing the
first set, 6-3, Lipsky came back with
a victory in the second-set
tiebreaker to even the match.

The third set opened with
Moore tripping and tailing to the
cpurt. Despite the injury, the
match continued. In a true battle of
wills, both players refused to give
ground, even as multiple injury
timeouts were taken. As the in
evitable third-set tiebreaker un
folded, Lipsky found himself down
5-4 and facing a Moore serve.
In an inspiring sequence of
shots, Lipsky fended oil several
consecutive Moore overheads to
recapture the point and bring the
crowd to a standing ovation. How
ever, Moore tightened his game,
and downed Lipsky 7-5 for the
point and the match.
Post season play begins this
Thursday, as the Pac-10 Individ
ual Championships kick oil in
Ojai, Calif. Stanford is expected to
field eight singles players and four
doubles teams. However, it is
stressed that the health of the play
ers is the paramount concern.
"We don't know if KJ is going
to play singles," said Whitlinger.
"He may just step down and play
doubles. We still have to make
that decision."
"We just have top get through
Ojai healthy. It is a good tourna
ment to play and is as tough as a
dual match," he added. "It allows a
place for the guys to improve. KJ
will be fine, he's a senior and will be
ready to go for the NCAAs."

both matches this weekend. The Cardinal
avoided Tuesday's predicament against Pep

points'due to a lack of players.
Saturday's loss to Southern California
places Stanford in a three-way tie with
USC and California for second place in
the Pac-10 with a 5-2 record. With Stan
ford's loss, UCLA clinched the conference
championship, despite losing to Califor
nia on Saturday.
Stanford first faced off against No. 2
UCLA (19-4, (i-l Pac-10) in what shaped up
to be a perfect, sunny Friday. Although all
the Stanford players expected a tough
match, the intensity of the doubles games
surpassed everyone's expectations.
"Everybody stepped up," said associate
head coach John Whitlinger. "It's tough
playing without your number-one player,

but we still competed very well and gave (lie
game a great shot."
All three of the doubles matches saw mul
tiple swings of momentum. Backed by a
large and vocal contingent of supporters, the
previously first-ranked duo of juniors Scott
Lipsky and David Martin were extremely
sharp. They quickly raced ahead two breaks
over the current number one tandem of
Mart in Matkowski and Jean-Julien Rojer of
UCLA, only to see their lead evaporate to a
7-7 tie. Pulling out two hard-fought games,
Lipsky and Martin were able to capture the
set, 9-7.
Second and third doubles were as fiercely
contested. Playing on court three, sopho
more Joe Kao and freshman Phil Sheng
jumped to a 3-1 lead, but then struggled to
stem a Bruin resurgence. Down 6-3, the Car
dinal team was able to even the score, but was
finally outdone, 9-7. The final and deciding
doubles match rested on junior Ryan Havi
land and freshman Sam Warburg, who
pulled ahead from a protracted, see-sawing
battle to capture the point, 8-5.
The doubles matches set the devil-may
care mentality that c haracterized the singles
play. In a battle that featured seven ranked
players out of the 12 playing, UCLA was able
to overcome the early deficit and capture
four of six possible singles points.
On court one, No. 37 Martin, covering for
the injured Hippensteel, easily upset No. 6

Freshman Sam Warburg rallied back from a first-set drubbing to crush Trojan Erfan Djahengiri,
0-6, 6-0, 6-0. Stanford fell 4-3 to USC during Saturday's match.
Tobias Clemens, 6-3, 6-4. Howev
er, No. 23 Marcin Matkowski
struck quickly and never let al
lowed No. 76 Haviland to climb
back. Sheng, still playing fourth
singles, was outslugged, 6-1,6-3 by
No. 58 Rodrigo Grilli, while Bruin
Lassi Ketola, playing in the sixth
slot, outfought Joe Kao 6-2, 6-1.
With the Cardinal down 3-2 the
match rested on the final two singles
matches. Warburg overcame an 6-0
drubbing the first set, and returned
with a vengeance, crushing Erfan
Djahengiri 6-0, 6-0, taking the
point. However, despite playing
well, No. 59 Lipsky was downed by
No. 115 Rojer, 7-5,6-4.
Hie next day, the Cardinal host
ed No. 13 USC (19-5,5-2 Pac-10) in
another emotionally charged
match that marked the final regu
lar-season game for both teams.
In contrast to the day before, the
Cardinal soon found itself battling
back from an early doubles deficit.
Lipsky and Martin, coming off of
their victory against the top-ranked
doubles team, could not hold off
No. 7 Ryan Moore and Nicholas
Rainy, who outlasted the Stanford
duo, 8-6, while Haviland and War
burg, both battling injuries, were

topped by Teige Sulliven and
Ruben Torres, 8-5. Kao and Sheng
captured the lone (Cardinal doubles
vic tory with a 9-7 win.
With a large crowd looking on,
the Cardinal entered singles play
with the understanding that victo
ry would not be easily wrested from
the experienced Trojan squad.
Martin, once again playing in
the top spot, was defeated by No. 29
Andrew Park, 6-3, 6-4, while Joe
Kao fell to Torres, (i-2, 6-2. The
Cardinal recaptured the points
with Haviland upsetting No. #66
Prakash Amritaj, and Warburg
downing Daniel Langre 6-3,6-4.
In perhaps the most impressive
match of the day, Sheng demon
strated incredible resolve and stay
ing power in a 6-2, 6-7, 6-3 upset
ting of No. 47 Rainy.
"I'm proud of how [Sheng]
played," said Whitlinger. "Phil's
been playing well lately, and is very
capable of beating almost anybody
out there."
Once again, the score was tied
3-3, with one match to play. Last
ing long after all the other games
had been decided, the crowd, play
ers, and coaches concentrated
solely on the gladiatorial battle
being fought on court two between
Lipsky and Moore. After losing the
first set, 6-3, Lipsky came back with
a victory in the second-set
tiebreaker to even the match.

The third set opened with
Moore tripping and tailing to the
cpurt. Despite the injury, the
match continued. In a true battle of
wills, both players refused to give
ground, even as multiple injury
timeouts were taken. As the in
evitable third-set tiebreaker un
folded, Lipsky found himself down
5-4 and facing a Moore serve.
In an inspiring sequence of
shots, Lipsky fended oil several
consecutive Moore overheads to
recapture the point and bring the
crowd to a standing ovation. How
ever, Moore tightened his game,
and downed Lipsky 7-5 for the
point and the match.
Post season play begins this
Thursday, as the Pac-10 Individ
ual Championships kick oil in
Ojai, Calif. Stanford is expected to
field eight singles players and four
doubles teams. However, it is
stressed that the health of the play
ers is the paramount concern.
"We don't know if KJ is going
to play singles," said Whitlinger.
"He may just step down and play
doubles. We still have to make
that decision."
"We just have top get through
Ojai healthy. It is a good tourna
ment to play and is as tough as a
dual match," he added. "It allows a
place for the guys to improve. KJ
will be fine, he's a senior and will be
ready to go for the NCAAs."
