## 
### DEBORAH SPLANSKY STAFF WRITER 
In sports, sometimes you get the
break and sometimes you don't.
This weekend the No. 3 Stanford soft
ball team (35-11, 4-8 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) didn't get any breaks.
On Friday evening the top-seeded
Arizona Wildcats (37-11, 7-4) made the
trip to the Farm for what was expected to
be a hard-fought battle between two of
the best in college Softball. Fans did not
go home disappointed.
Both pitchers, at the top of their
games, worked hard to keep the oppos
ing side silent .
However, Wildcat pitcher Jennie
Finch cracked first as the Cardinal at
tacked in the bottom of the fourth.
With one out, senior centerfielder
Jessica Mendoza sent a shot to center
field fora double and the first hit of the
game. Senior first baseman Sarah Bee
son followed by ripping a single down
the leftfield line to drive in Mendoza and
give Stanford a 1-0 advantage.
The Cardinal lead remained going
into the top of the seventh, but Arizona
would not be held silent.
With one out and nobody on, Finch
reached first base on an infield error
Then sophomore catcher Mackenzie
Vandergeest belted a two-run homer to
left-centerfield.
The home run, only the second hit of
the game for the Wildcats, was enough
to put Arizona ahead going into the bot
tom of the seventh.

The Cardinal waged a comeback in
the bottom of the inning as the tying run
sat on second base with one out, but a
double play ended the Stanford rally.
Junior pitcher fori Nyberg pitched a
phenomenal game, allowing just two hits
in seven innings to the No. 1 team in the
nation. It would not be enough, as Ari
zona left with the 2-1 win.
The Cardinal returned to the field

the following day to take on No. 6 Ari
zona State.
Stanford's usual first-inning offensive
attack did not occur, but the Sun Devils,
eager fora win after being upset by Cal
ifornia across the Bay, scored immedi
ately. They took a 3-0 lead before the
Cardinal came to bat.

Senior Robin Walker and the women's softball team struggled this weekend when the Ari
zona schools visited the Farm. Stanford dropped a hard-fought game to Arizona, 2-1 be
fore losing two straight to Arizona State.
Sophomore Phelan Wright sin
gled to mount the attack, and was
followed by a double from Nichole
Thompson.
Junior pitcher Maureen
LeCocq ended the rally and con
tinued to shut down Arizona State
until the top of the seventh inning.
However, the Sun Devils would
make a final rally in the top of the
seventh and tack on an insurance
run when Wright picked up her
second RBI of the game.
The Cardinal was unable to
push a run across the plate in the
Saturday night loss.
Sunday brought a second game
for Stanford to beat the Sun Devils
before they went back to Arizona.
However, Stanford was hand
ed its second one-run loss this
weekend, and the Sun Devils
managed to escape with two victo
ries on Cardinal turf.
Nyberg dominated in the circle
for Stanford, while Erica Beach
and Kirsten Voak combined for
Arizona State on the rubber.
Both pitching staffs worked
hard to keep their opposing line
ups from scoring and both suc
ceeded, with the exception of one
Sun Devil run in the top of the
sixth.
But, much as it did on Friday,
one run would prove to be
enough.
The Cardinal left eight runners
stranded on Sunday afternoon
and suffered from some question
able calls.
But, Stanford remains confi
dent looking at the weekend as a
something to apply to the future.
"Wejust need to use this week
end as a learning experience, and
use it to get better," said junior
first baseman Cassi Brangham.
The Cardinal will attempt to
take this outlook into a non-con
ference game this Wednesday
against Sacramento State at 5 p.m.
at home.
