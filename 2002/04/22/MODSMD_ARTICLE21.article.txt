### DEBORAH SPLANSKY STAFF WRITER 
In sports, sometimes you get the
break and sometimes you don't.
This weekend the No. 3 Stanford soft
ball team (35-11, 4-8 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) didn't get any breaks.
On Friday evening the top-seeded
Arizona Wildcats (37-11, 7-4) made the
trip to the Farm for what was expected to
be a hard-fought battle between two of
the best in college Softball. Fans did not
go home disappointed.
Both pitchers, at the top of their
games, worked hard to keep the oppos
ing side silent .
However, Wildcat pitcher Jennie
Finch cracked first as the Cardinal at
tacked in the bottom of the fourth.
With one out, senior centerfielder
Jessica Mendoza sent a shot to center
field fora double and the first hit of the
game. Senior first baseman Sarah Bee
son followed by ripping a single down
the leftfield line to drive in Mendoza and
give Stanford a 1-0 advantage.
The Cardinal lead remained going
into the top of the seventh, but Arizona
would not be held silent.
With one out and nobody on, Finch
reached first base on an infield error
Then sophomore catcher Mackenzie
Vandergeest belted a two-run homer to
left-centerfield.
The home run, only the second hit of
the game for the Wildcats, was enough
to put Arizona ahead going into the bot
tom of the seventh.

The Cardinal waged a comeback in
the bottom of the inning as the tying run
sat on second base with one out, but a
double play ended the Stanford rally.
Junior pitcher fori Nyberg pitched a
phenomenal game, allowing just two hits
in seven innings to the No. 1 team in the
nation. It would not be enough, as Ari
zona left with the 2-1 win.
The Cardinal returned to the field

the following day to take on No. 6 Ari
zona State.
Stanford's usual first-inning offensive
attack did not occur, but the Sun Devils,
eager fora win after being upset by Cal
ifornia across the Bay, scored immedi
ately. They took a 3-0 lead before the
Cardinal came to bat.
