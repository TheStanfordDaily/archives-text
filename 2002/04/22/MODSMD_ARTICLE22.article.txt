I here is A first time for everything and
it looks like it is time for the Stanford
women's gymnastics team to break out its
baby book. This weekend, the Cardinal
made it to the Super Six — the finals of
the NCAA National gymnastics competi
tion— for the first time in Cardinal histo
ry.
On Thursday evening, Stanford com
peted in the preliminary round of the

NCAA Championships in Tuscaloosa,
Ala. Stanford placed third in the second
group with a 196.050, while host Alabama
finished first with a 197.300 and UCLA
claimed second, scoring 197.100. Round
ing out the competition was Minnesota,
who placed fourth, tallying a 195.700
score. Florida received fifth with a
195.675 and Oregon State placed sixth
with .i 192.925.
Since Stanford was in the top three
schools of the group, the team advanced
to the Super Six, joining Alabama, UCLA
and the top three schools from the morn
ing competition — Utah, Georgia and
Nebraska.
"I'm so excited and absolutely in
awe of my team," said head coach Kris
ten Smyth after Thursday's competi

tion. "We started off tight on bars, but
finished with our most spectacular ef
fort of the year on vault. We talked all
year about making a Super Six and,
this weekend, those dreams became a
reality."
Stanford's two opening events on
Thursday, the parallel bars and the bal
ance beam, started a little rough. But the
team was able to pull together and score a
49.025 on the fl<x>r exercise and a season
best 49.200 on the vault.
"Mentally, it was a lot of pressure, but
our focus was on doing everything the
lx*st we could and having fun," senior
Katy Herbert said. "It's not so stressful
when you all work together."
