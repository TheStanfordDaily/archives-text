# Gymnasts finish season at Super Six
## Three sophomore gymnasts earn first-team individual All-American honors 
### SARAH LINDSEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I here is A first time for everything and
it looks like it is time for the Stanford
women's gymnastics team to break out its
baby book. This weekend, the Cardinal
made it to the Super Six — the finals of
the NCAA National gymnastics competi
tion— for the first time in Cardinal histo
ry.
On Thursday evening, Stanford com
peted in the preliminary round of the

NCAA Championships in Tuscaloosa,
Ala. Stanford placed third in the second
group with a 196.050, while host Alabama
finished first with a 197.300 and UCLA
claimed second, scoring 197.100. Round
ing out the competition was Minnesota,
who placed fourth, tallying a 195.700
score. Florida received fifth with a
195.675 and Oregon State placed sixth
with .i 192.925.
Since Stanford was in the top three
schools of the group, the team advanced
to the Super Six, joining Alabama, UCLA
and the top three schools from the morn
ing competition — Utah, Georgia and
Nebraska.
"I'm so excited and absolutely in
awe of my team," said head coach Kris
ten Smyth after Thursday's competi

tion. "We started off tight on bars, but
finished with our most spectacular ef
fort of the year on vault. We talked all
year about making a Super Six and,
this weekend, those dreams became a
reality."
Stanford's two opening events on
Thursday, the parallel bars and the bal
ance beam, started a little rough. But the
team was able to pull together and score a
49.025 on the fl<x>r exercise and a season
best 49.200 on the vault.
"Mentally, it was a lot of pressure, but
our focus was on doing everything the
lx*st we could and having fun," senior
Katy Herbert said. "It's not so stressful
when you all work together."
Individually, sophomores
Kendall Beck, Lise Leveille, and
Lindsay Wing each performed
well enough in their respective
events to earn First Team All-

American status and advance to
the NCAA Individual Event Fi
nals on Saturday.
Heck nailed her vault to score a
9AKH), whirl 11 >la< e< I her in a tie l<>r sec -
ond, while Ix'veilleand Wing tied lor
l< >i nt 11 place on the I x'ain with a 9.875.
Hut helore these- three gymnasts
could perform in the individual
competition, the team had to take

face the Super Six.
Host school Alabama was
crowned 2002 national champion
with a team score of 197.575, fol
ic >wed by (Georgia with 197.250 and
two-time defending champion
UClAat third with 197.150. Utah
took fourth with 196.950, Nebraska
was fifth with 196.425 and Stanford
was sixth with 196.025.
Stanford started off on the bars,
scoring a 48.925 to place sixth over
all in the event. The Cardinal con
tinued to improve on each routine
throughout the evening. On the
beam, Stanford placed fifth with a
score of 49.000.
Next up for Stanford was the
floor, in which it placed sixth with a
49.025, and finally the vault, in
which the Cardinal scored a 49.075
to place fifth in the event.
"I was very pleased with the
team's performance on Friday,"
said Smyth. "We had girls like
Maria Ranieriand KelseyStillinger,
who hadn't competed in weeks and
still were able to step up and con
tribute with,solid performances."
After the team medals were
awarded, three Stanford gymnasts
took to the mats on Saturday for the
individual competition.
Sophomore Leveille earned a
sixth place finish on the balance
beam with a 9.838. Beck took
eighth place on the vault with a
9.7630, while Wing finished 12th
on the balance beam at 9.750.
"We've worked really hard to get
to the Super Six," said Smyth. "It
really paid off for the team and in
dividuals this weekend."
This Cardinal's stellar season
gives future teams the opportunity
to build off of this year's precedent.
"We're really making a name for
ourselves as one of the top pro
grams in the country, and this sta
tus reinforces itself every year,"
Herbert said. "Since gymnastics is
such a subjective sport, it helps to
have other people thinking that
your level of gymnastics is as good
as you know it is."
When the emotional high of this
weekend wears off, the seniors will
have to face the sad task of saying
goodbye to the team.
"I feel so lucky to finish out my
last year of gymnastics with such a
great team," said senior Katy
Herbert.

I here is A first time for everything and
it looks like it is time for the Stanford
women's gymnastics team to break out its
baby book. This weekend, the Cardinal
made it to the Super Six — the finals of
the NCAA National gymnastics competi
tion— for the first time in Cardinal histo
ry.
On Thursday evening, Stanford com
peted in the preliminary round of the

NCAA Championships in Tuscaloosa,
Ala. Stanford placed third in the second
group with a 196.050, while host Alabama
finished first with a 197.300 and UCLA
claimed second, scoring 197.100. Round
ing out the competition was Minnesota,
who placed fourth, tallying a 195.700
score. Florida received fifth with a
195.675 and Oregon State placed sixth
with .i 192.925.
Since Stanford was in the top three
schools of the group, the team advanced
to the Super Six, joining Alabama, UCLA
and the top three schools from the morn
ing competition — Utah, Georgia and
Nebraska.
"I'm so excited and absolutely in
awe of my team," said head coach Kris
ten Smyth after Thursday's competi

tion. "We started off tight on bars, but
finished with our most spectacular ef
fort of the year on vault. We talked all
year about making a Super Six and,
this weekend, those dreams became a
reality."
Stanford's two opening events on
Thursday, the parallel bars and the bal
ance beam, started a little rough. But the
team was able to pull together and score a
49.025 on the fl<x>r exercise and a season
best 49.200 on the vault.
"Mentally, it was a lot of pressure, but
our focus was on doing everything the
lx*st we could and having fun," senior
Katy Herbert said. "It's not so stressful
when you all work together."
Individually, sophomores
Kendall Beck, Lise Leveille, and
Lindsay Wing each performed
well enough in their respective
events to earn First Team All-

American status and advance to
the NCAA Individual Event Fi
nals on Saturday.

Hut helore these- three gymnasts
could perform in the individual
competition, the team had to take

face the Super Six.
Host school Alabama was
crowned 2002 national champion
with a team score of 197.575, fol
ic >wed by (Georgia with 197.250 and
two-time defending champion
UClAat third with 197.150. Utah
took fourth with 196.950, Nebraska
was fifth with 196.425 and Stanford
was sixth with 196.025.
Stanford started off on the bars,
scoring a 48.925 to place sixth over
all in the event. The Cardinal con
tinued to improve on each routine
throughout the evening. On the
beam, Stanford placed fifth with a
score of 49.000.
Next up for Stanford was the
floor, in which it placed sixth with a
49.025, and finally the vault, in
which the Cardinal scored a 49.075
to place fifth in the event.
"I was very pleased with the
team's performance on Friday,"
said Smyth. "We had girls like
Maria Ranieriand KelseyStillinger,
who hadn't competed in weeks and
still were able to step up and con
tribute with,solid performances."
After the team medals were
awarded, three Stanford gymnasts
took to the mats on Saturday for the
individual competition.
Sophomore Leveille earned a
sixth place finish on the balance
beam with a 9.838. Beck took
eighth place on the vault with a
9.7630, while Wing finished 12th
on the balance beam at 9.750.
"We've worked really hard to get
to the Super Six," said Smyth. "It
really paid off for the team and in
dividuals this weekend."
This Cardinal's stellar season
gives future teams the opportunity
to build off of this year's precedent.
"We're really making a name for
ourselves as one of the top pro
grams in the country, and this sta
tus reinforces itself every year,"
Herbert said. "Since gymnastics is
such a subjective sport, it helps to
have other people thinking that
your level of gymnastics is as good
as you know it is."
When the emotional high of this
weekend wears off, the seniors will
have to face the sad task of saying
goodbye to the team.
"I feel so lucky to finish out my
last year of gymnastics with such a
great team," said senior Katy
Herbert.
