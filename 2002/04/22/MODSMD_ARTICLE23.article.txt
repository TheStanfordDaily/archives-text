# Rowe tops leaderboard as Card notches second at Intercollegiate
## 
### MATT BABIN 
I-ist week head coach |efl Mitchell described this
weekend's U.S. Intercollegiate, hold at the Stanford
Golf (lourse, as an "extremely important" tournament,
a chance for the Cardinal squad to make a statement to
its conference foes in the last tournament before post
season play, and more importantly, make a statement
to the NCAA Regional selection committee.
l he players were listening, as they turned in a spec
tacular team effort to place second in a highly compet
itive field of 17 teams. It was the Cardinal's highest fin
ish of the season since (Jctober, when the team tied for
second at the Fresno-Lexus Golf Classic .
Senior Phil Rowe once again led the way for Stan
ford, as he turned in three outstanding rounds to card
a three-day total of 205 (64-72-69), winning the indi
vidual honors of the weekend. I lis first round of the
tournament, a 64 on Saturday morning, was just one
stroke off the course record.
His closest challenger, Kevin Stadler of Southern
California, was five shots back.

In a field filled with strong conference opponents, it
became clear early on that this was a match between
Stanford and USC, as Rowe and Stadler paced their
schools to low scores in the early rounds.
y\s the second round concluded Saturday after
noon, the leaderboard provided a preview of the final
outcome, with USC 1 . over Stanford and Rowe just ahead
of Stadler.
Not content with second place, the Cardinal hit the
links Sunday morning gunning for the Trojans.
"They'll be hard to catch," admitted Mitchell. "We'll
probably have to shoot seven or eight under."
The prediction was correct, but some putts just
didn't fall. The Cardinal ended the tournament with
a team round of 286, two over par, to finish 10 shots
back of USC.
Perhaps the most impressive aspect of the outcome
this weekend was the fact that the Cardinal was able to
concentrate so well on the tournament at hand know
ing fiill well that its postseason fate may have luing in
the balance. In a year that has shown disappointment
one weekend and celebration the next, time was run
ning out.
"It's certainly been more of a roller coaster than I ex
pected," said Mitchell.
The safety feature on that roller coaster this season
has been Rowe, who is heating up at just the right time.
"Phil's had another great year," Mitchell said. "I le's
been very solid, very consistent."
On Sunday, he was ruthless, taking the course with
a two-shot lead over Stadler and promptly carding
birdies on the first two holes. He gave a clinic on the
front nine, missing only one fairway, and making the
turn at three under.
Rowe wasn't the only Stanford player posting good
scores this weekend. Sophomore Blake Mastalir
turned in a 217 (73-68-76), giving him a share of 17th
place, one shot ahead of junior Ron Won. Junior Jim
Seki, playing through the pain of a nagging back in
jury, posted a three-day total of 222, for 41st position,
while freshman Kevin Blue shot a 226.
Four members of the team competed as individuals
over the weekend, with freshman Pat Phillips turning
in the highest finish with 48th place.
The results of this weekend's play give the Cardi
nal something positive to build on as the team pre
pares to travel toCorvallis, Ore. and compete for the
Pacific-10 Conference Championship at Trysting
free next weekend.
The Pac-1 0 appears to be as strong and competitive
as ever.
"We're looking to finish in the top half of the con
ference in Oregon. By all accounts, we might be
ranked ninth in the conference right now," said
Mitchell.
After this weekend, it appears that ranking this Car
dinal team ninth would be a mistake — and asking for
an upset.
