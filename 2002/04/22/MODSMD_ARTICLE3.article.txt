# Mideast conflict sparks rallies
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Palestinian, Israeli and American flags
flew in the Oval at noon Friday when over
200 students, faculty and local community
members gathered in response to current
events in the Middle East — half partici
pating in a rally calling for international
intervention in the Israeli-Palestinian con
flict and a suspension of U.S. aid to Israel,
the other half protesting the message of
the rally.
Organized by an adhoc group of Stan
ford graduate students, the first rally was
advertised as aiming to "promote peace in
t he Middle East" as well as the "safety, dig
nity and human rights of all people" in the
region. It featured speeches by History
Prof. Joel Beinin, Rabbi and Editor of
Tikkun magazine Michael Lerner and
Drama and Classics Prof. Rush Rehm.
Concerned that the rally would be
filled with "anti-Israel messages," Jewish
students and the Stanford Israel Alliance,
supported by Hillel, planned a counter
tally, wary that references to "Israeli vic
tims or to Palestinian terrorism" would be
left out.
"That's our concern, that what's billed
as a pro-peace rally will be a very derisive
anti-Israel rally," said former Stanford Is
rael Alliance President Josh Saidoff, a se
nior, "We're adding a voice that's other

wise omitted from this event."
Those involved in the rally rejected the
notion that it was anti-Israel.
"If they're claiming that [the rally] is in
herently anti-Israel, I hope they would
separate the policies of their country from
the larger issues with Israel," said sociolo
gy graduate student Brian (lolwell, one of
the rally's organizers.
"I don't think that being critical of Is
raeli policy is the same as being anti-Israel
and being critical of Israeli policy is cer
tainly not being anti-peace," said Beinin,
who pointed out that almost all of the
rally's speakers were Jews.
The rally was civil throughout, though
there were extreme views present on both
sides that at times created an atmosphere
oftension.
Some carried signs saying "Nazism =
Zionism," while one student could be
heard shouting "He's a terrorist. Arafat is
a Nazi." Signs held by some counter-ral
liers read, "If it walks with Anti-Semites,
Squawks with Anti-Semites, it must be an
Anti-Semite" and "Israel wants peace. We
have no partner."
Sophomore VVael Salloum, who was
wearing a Palestinian flag draped around
his shoulders, said he initially came
dressed only in black to mourn the deaths
on both sides, but upon seeing the
counter-protesters, went back to get his
flag and signs.

"The reason I came here without a flag
and without posters was because it was
supposed to be a rally for both sides," Sal
loum said. "Unfortunately, it's been
turned into a political rally."
Yitzhak Santis of the Jewish Communi
ty Relations Council expressed dismay
over what he described as the lies being
propagated by the rally's speakers and
what he saw as the one-sidedness of the
rally's supporters.
"They say they're for peace, they say
they're for two suites, but you only see one
(lag here, the Palestinian flag," he said.
Just moments after, Salloum ap
proached Santis about the pronunciation
of the Hebrew in his sign, which read "Yes
to cooperation, no to violence," and Sal
loum assisted Santis with the Arabic.
The rally began with a brief introduc
tion by Colwell, who emphasized that
the University did not endorse the rally
and requested that those present act
with civility.
"We're trying to promote the idea of
peace," Colwell said. "We don't think that
the militant tactics are going to work in the
long term."
Jan Feldman, introduced as a member
ofthe local Jewish community and a peace
activist, then read a letter entitled "After
the outrage and tears," which described
recent events in the West Bank.
" 1 lie overwhelming picture
before us is of death and destruc
tion, wrought by the Israeli army
in Palestinian cities, Jenin above
all," the letter, written by a woman
described as an Israeli peace ac
tivist, said.
"In my history of activism, 1 recall
no parallel sense of urgency in
which lives and daily bread are
Ix'ing set aside to pursue a cause,"
the woman wrote. "But I also recall
no parallel leeling that a calamity of
our own making is unfolding before
our own eyes."
Beinin spoke after Feldman.
His talk called lor a suspension of
U.S. aid to Israel as well as the inser
tion of a non-American, internation
al peace-keeping force in the region,
both of which drew applause.
He spent the bulk of his talk dis
cussing the current U.S. treatment
of the conllict, criticizing Secretary
of State Colin Powell's actions dur

ing his recent visit to the region.
"Powell should have gone to the
Jenin refugee camp to sec for him
self the extent of the death and de
struction wrought by Israel," he
said. "He should publicly have de
clared that the West Bank, the Gaza
Strip and East Jerusalem are occu
pied, not disputed territories ..."
He also called for Powell and
the U.S. government to stop "lec
tin ing [Palestinian leader] Yasir
Arafat about the need to do more
to stop terrorism" while he is re
strained by Israel.
"Arafat is not a charming man
or a skillful leader," Beinin said.
"But he is the elected president of
the Palestinian Authority and the
symbol of Palestinian national as
pirations and should be respected
as such."
Beinin concluded his speech by
associating the U.S.'s alliance with
Israel with the government's treat
ment of the conflict, and the detri
mental repercussions of U.S. aid.
Law student Shahid Buttar,
the rally's emcee, followed
Beinin's talk with a spoken-word
piece condemning U.S. policy

and calling lor freedom for both
Israelis and Palestinians.
Lerner, the second main speak
er, also called lot international me
diators as well as lor the withdrawal
of Israel to its pre-1907 borders,
with modifications. He lixused his
speech on recognizing that both
sides bore responsibility for the con
flict and that to oppose the policies
of Israeli President Ariel Sharon was
not tobeanti-Israel.
He began by unsuccessfully at
tempting to bring the counter
demonstrators over to the area in
fiont of the speakers where the
rally's supporters were situated.
"In one way, the choreography
of today represents, dramatizes the
very problem, and I want to invite
my Jewish brothers and sisters,
come close," Lerner said. "We can
be together, we don't have to Ix? sep
arate. Take a step forward, take a
step forward to reconciliation, this is
not a zero-sum game."
Lerner declared that he was a
Zionist who was proud of and sup
ported Israel, but that he also iden
tified with "the peace forces in Israel
who believe that the current policies

of the state of Israel violate the best
in Jewish tradition, the highest val
ues ofTorah and the highest values
of humanity."
Lerner urged equal treatment of
Palestinians and Israelis. He tailed
for Arafat to reject all forms of vio
lence as the only way to convince Is
raelis that ending the occupation isa
"path to safety." He called for
Sharon to"end the (xcupation" and
provide reparations lor Palestini
ans. 1 le also questioned the true in
tent of the recent Israeli incursion.
"Hie real issue is that Israel does
not want to give up its settlements
and consequently, the act of the
claim that the current incursions
into the West Bank cities is about
dismantling the operations of ter
ror is ridiculous," he said. "It is cre
ating more terrorists, not under
mining terrorists."
Rehm was the final speaker, lo
dising on the meaning of terrorism
and citing previous instances of U.S.
actions that would constitute terror
ism, according to its own definition
as determined by theTJ.S. Congress
in 1984. He also spoke of (he eu
phemisms used lor Israeli actions

propagated by the U.S. media.
I .ike < >ther speakers, Rehm called
for international monitors in the re
gion and suspended U.S. military
assistance to Israel. He went on to
describe the social and economic
strife of the Palestinians.
Though Rehm's speech was
planned to conclude the rally, dur
ing his talk graduate student
Kathryn Syssoyeva.a member of the
counter-rally, approached the
rally's organizers and requested that
the two groups physically join to
sing "(3d Yavo Shalom Alienu,"
which means "eventually peace will
be upon us," in the hopes that it
would give the more moderate rep
resentatives of each group the op
portunity to come together. The
event concluded with the groups
slowly joining and as people filtered
out, p<x kets of students and com
munity members remained for
more personal discussion.
Others opposing the rally cited
the need to stand by Israel despite
its policy.
" It's not as easy as one, two, three,
end occupation, one, two, three,
end U.S. aid to Israel," said second

year law student Daniel
kirschbaum. "Even if we don't sup
port their policy, we must respect
what they do as the legitimate gov
ernment of Israel.
"I think it's disingenuous to say
this was not a pro-Palestinian rally,"
Kirschbaum said.
Some attendees were frustrated
by the event's disunity. Palestinian
supporter freshman Rania Kltom
and freshman Danny Greene, part
of the counter-protest, discussed
their desire to bridge the gap be
tween the two groups, but said they
felt unable to do so.
During Syssoyeva's appeal for
the groups to join, Greene shouted
to the counter-ralliers, "If we feel
that we don't have a partner, we
need to integrate, guys. They're call
ing us over there."
Despite the final union of the
opposing sides on Friday, Rehm
questioned the ultimate meaning
of the gesture.
"It'cl be nice if people on a
sunny clay in Palo Alto could come
together," he said, " fell me what
difference it makes for the occupa
tion of Palestine."

intervention in the Israeli-Palestinian con
flict and a suspension of U.S. aid to Israel,
the other half protesting the message of
the rally.
Organized by an adhoc group of Stan
ford graduate students, the first rally was
advertised as aiming to "promote peace in
t he Middle East" as well as the "safety, dig
nity and human rights of all people" in the
region. It featured speeches by History
Prof. Joel Beinin, Rabbi and Editor of
Tikkun magazine Michael Lerner and
Drama and Classics Prof. Rush Rehm.
Concerned that the rally would be
filled with "anti-Israel messages," Jewish
students and the Stanford Israel Alliance,
supported by Hillel, planned a counter
tally, wary that references to "Israeli vic
tims or to Palestinian terrorism" would be
left out.
"That's our concern, that what's billed
as a pro-peace rally will be a very derisive
anti-Israel rally," said former Stanford Is
rael Alliance President Josh Saidoff, a se
nior, "We're adding a voice that's other

wise omitted from this event."
Those involved in the rally rejected the
notion that it was anti-Israel.
"If they're claiming that [the rally] is in
herently anti-Israel, I hope they would
separate the policies of their country from
the larger issues with Israel," said sociolo
gy graduate student Brian (lolwell, one of
the rally's organizers.
"I don't think that being critical of Is
raeli policy is the same as being anti-Israel
and being critical of Israeli policy is cer
tainly not being anti-peace," said Beinin,
who pointed out that almost all of the
rally's speakers were Jews.
The rally was civil throughout, though
there were extreme views present on both
sides that at times created an atmosphere
oftension.
Some carried signs saying "Nazism =
Zionism," while one student could be
heard shouting "He's a terrorist. Arafat is
a Nazi." Signs held by some counter-ral
liers read, "If it walks with Anti-Semites,
Squawks with Anti-Semites, it must be an
Anti-Semite" and "Israel wants peace. We
have no partner."
Sophomore VVael Salloum, who was
wearing a Palestinian flag draped around
his shoulders, said he initially came
dressed only in black to mourn the deaths
on both sides, but upon seeing the
counter-protesters, went back to get his
flag and signs.

"The reason I came here without a flag
and without posters was because it was
supposed to be a rally for both sides," Sal
loum said. "Unfortunately, it's been
turned into a political rally."
Yitzhak Santis of the Jewish Communi
ty Relations Council expressed dismay
over what he described as the lies being
propagated by the rally's speakers and
what he saw as the one-sidedness of the
rally's supporters.
"They say they're for peace, they say
they're for two suites, but you only see one
(lag here, the Palestinian flag," he said.
Just moments after, Salloum ap
proached Santis about the pronunciation
of the Hebrew in his sign, which read "Yes
to cooperation, no to violence," and Sal
loum assisted Santis with the Arabic.
The rally began with a brief introduc
tion by Colwell, who emphasized that
the University did not endorse the rally
and requested that those present act
with civility.
"We're trying to promote the idea of
peace," Colwell said. "We don't think that
the militant tactics are going to work in the
long term."
Jan Feldman, introduced as a member
ofthe local Jewish community and a peace
activist, then read a letter entitled "After
the outrage and tears," which described
recent events in the West Bank.
" 1 lie overwhelming picture
before us is of death and destruc
tion, wrought by the Israeli army
in Palestinian cities, Jenin above
all," the letter, written by a woman
described as an Israeli peace ac
tivist, said.
"In my history of activism, 1 recall
no parallel sense of urgency in
which lives and daily bread are
Ix'ing set aside to pursue a cause,"
the woman wrote. "But I also recall
no parallel leeling that a calamity of
our own making is unfolding before
our own eyes."
Beinin spoke after Feldman.
His talk called lor a suspension of
U.S. aid to Israel as well as the inser
tion of a non-American, internation
al peace-keeping force in the region,
both of which drew applause.
He spent the bulk of his talk dis
cussing the current U.S. treatment
of the conllict, criticizing Secretary
of State Colin Powell's actions dur

ing his recent visit to the region.
"Powell should have gone to the
Jenin refugee camp to sec for him
self the extent of the death and de
struction wrought by Israel," he
said. "He should publicly have de
clared that the West Bank, the Gaza
Strip and East Jerusalem are occu
pied, not disputed territories ..."
He also called for Powell and
the U.S. government to stop "lec
tin ing [Palestinian leader] Yasir
Arafat about the need to do more
to stop terrorism" while he is re
strained by Israel.
"Arafat is not a charming man
or a skillful leader," Beinin said.
"But he is the elected president of
the Palestinian Authority and the
symbol of Palestinian national as
pirations and should be respected
as such."
Beinin concluded his speech by
associating the U.S.'s alliance with
Israel with the government's treat
ment of the conflict, and the detri
mental repercussions of U.S. aid.
Law student Shahid Buttar,
the rally's emcee, followed
Beinin's talk with a spoken-word
piece condemning U.S. policy

and calling lor freedom for both
Israelis and Palestinians.
Lerner, the second main speak
er, also called lot international me
diators as well as lor the withdrawal
of Israel to its pre-1907 borders,
with modifications. He lixused his
speech on recognizing that both
sides bore responsibility for the con
flict and that to oppose the policies
of Israeli President Ariel Sharon was
not tobeanti-Israel.
He began by unsuccessfully at
tempting to bring the counter
demonstrators over to the area in
fiont of the speakers where the
rally's supporters were situated.
"In one way, the choreography
of today represents, dramatizes the
very problem, and I want to invite
my Jewish brothers and sisters,
come close," Lerner said. "We can
be together, we don't have to Ix? sep
arate. Take a step forward, take a
step forward to reconciliation, this is
not a zero-sum game."
Lerner declared that he was a
Zionist who was proud of and sup
ported Israel, but that he also iden
tified with "the peace forces in Israel
who believe that the current policies

of the state of Israel violate the best
in Jewish tradition, the highest val
ues ofTorah and the highest values
of humanity."
Lerner urged equal treatment of
Palestinians and Israelis. He tailed
for Arafat to reject all forms of vio
lence as the only way to convince Is
raelis that ending the occupation isa
"path to safety." He called for
Sharon to"end the (xcupation" and
provide reparations lor Palestini
ans. 1 le also questioned the true in
tent of the recent Israeli incursion.
"Hie real issue is that Israel does
not want to give up its settlements
and consequently, the act of the
claim that the current incursions
into the West Bank cities is about
dismantling the operations of ter
ror is ridiculous," he said. "It is cre
ating more terrorists, not under
mining terrorists."
Rehm was the final speaker, lo
dising on the meaning of terrorism
and citing previous instances of U.S.
actions that would constitute terror
ism, according to its own definition
as determined by theTJ.S. Congress
in 1984. He also spoke of (he eu
phemisms used lor Israeli actions

propagated by the U.S. media.
I .ike < >ther speakers, Rehm called
for international monitors in the re
gion and suspended U.S. military
assistance to Israel. He went on to
describe the social and economic
strife of the Palestinians.
Though Rehm's speech was
planned to conclude the rally, dur
ing his talk graduate student
Kathryn Syssoyeva.a member of the
counter-rally, approached the
rally's organizers and requested that
the two groups physically join to
sing "(3d Yavo Shalom Alienu,"
which means "eventually peace will
be upon us," in the hopes that it
would give the more moderate rep
resentatives of each group the op
portunity to come together. The
event concluded with the groups
slowly joining and as people filtered
out, p<x kets of students and com
munity members remained for
more personal discussion.
Others opposing the rally cited
the need to stand by Israel despite
its policy.
" It's not as easy as one, two, three,
end occupation, one, two, three,
end U.S. aid to Israel," said second

year law student Daniel
kirschbaum. "Even if we don't sup
port their policy, we must respect
what they do as the legitimate gov
ernment of Israel.
"I think it's disingenuous to say
this was not a pro-Palestinian rally,"
Kirschbaum said.
Some attendees were frustrated
by the event's disunity. Palestinian
supporter freshman Rania Kltom
and freshman Danny Greene, part
of the counter-protest, discussed
their desire to bridge the gap be
tween the two groups, but said they
felt unable to do so.
During Syssoyeva's appeal for
the groups to join, Greene shouted
to the counter-ralliers, "If we feel
that we don't have a partner, we
need to integrate, guys. They're call
ing us over there."
Despite the final union of the
opposing sides on Friday, Rehm
questioned the ultimate meaning
of the gesture.
"It'cl be nice if people on a
sunny clay in Palo Alto could come
together," he said, " fell me what
difference it makes for the occupa
tion of Palestine."
Palestinian, Israeli and American flags
flew in the Oval at noon Friday when over
200 students, faculty and local community
members gathered in response to current
events in the Middle East — half partici
pating in a rally calling for international
intervention in the Israeli-Palestinian con

t he Middle East" as well as the "safety, dig
nity and human rights of all people" in the
region. It featured speeches by History
Prof. Joel Beinin, Rabbi and Editor of
Tikkun magazine Michael Lerner and
Drama and Classics Prof. Rush Rehm.
Concerned that the rally would be
filled with "anti-Israel messages," Jewish
students and the Stanford Israel Alliance,
supported by Hillel, planned a counter
tally, wary that references to "Israeli vic
tims or to Palestinian terrorism" would be
left out.
"That's our concern, that what's billed
as a pro-peace rally will be a very derisive
anti-Israel rally," said former Stanford Is
rael Alliance President Josh Saidoff, a se
nior, "We're adding a voice that's other

wise omitted from this event."
Those involved in the rally rejected the
notion that it was anti-Israel.
"If they're claiming that [the rally] is in
herently anti-Israel, I hope they would
separate the policies of their country from
the larger issues with Israel," said sociolo
gy graduate student Brian (lolwell, one of
the rally's organizers.
"I don't think that being critical of Is
raeli policy is the same as being anti-Israel
and being critical of Israeli policy is cer
tainly not being anti-peace," said Beinin,
who pointed out that almost all of the
rally's speakers were Jews.
The rally was civil throughout, though
there were extreme views present on both
sides that at times created an atmosphere
oftension.
Some carried signs saying "Nazism =
Zionism," while one student could be
heard shouting "He's a terrorist. Arafat is
a Nazi." Signs held by some counter-ral
liers read, "If it walks with Anti-Semites,
Squawks with Anti-Semites, it must be an
Anti-Semite" and "Israel wants peace. We
have no partner."
Sophomore VVael Salloum, who was
wearing a Palestinian flag draped around
his shoulders, said he initially came
dressed only in black to mourn the deaths
on both sides, but upon seeing the
counter-protesters, went back to get his
flag and signs.

"The reason I came here without a flag
and without posters was because it was
supposed to be a rally for both sides," Sal
loum said. "Unfortunately, it's been
turned into a political rally."
Yitzhak Santis of the Jewish Communi
ty Relations Council expressed dismay
over what he described as the lies being
propagated by the rally's speakers and
what he saw as the one-sidedness of the
rally's supporters.
"They say they're for peace, they say
they're for two suites, but you only see one
(lag here, the Palestinian flag," he said.
Just moments after, Salloum ap
proached Santis about the pronunciation
of the Hebrew in his sign, which read "Yes
to cooperation, no to violence," and Sal
loum assisted Santis with the Arabic.
The rally began with a brief introduc
tion by Colwell, who emphasized that
the University did not endorse the rally
and requested that those present act
with civility.
"We're trying to promote the idea of
peace," Colwell said. "We don't think that
the militant tactics are going to work in the
long term."
Jan Feldman, introduced as a member
ofthe local Jewish community and a peace
activist, then read a letter entitled "After
the outrage and tears," which described
recent events in the West Bank.
" 1 lie overwhelming picture
before us is of death and destruc
tion, wrought by the Israeli army
in Palestinian cities, Jenin above
all," the letter, written by a woman
described as an Israeli peace ac
tivist, said.
"In my history of activism, 1 recall
no parallel sense of urgency in
which lives and daily bread are
Ix'ing set aside to pursue a cause,"
the woman wrote. "But I also recall
no parallel leeling that a calamity of
our own making is unfolding before
our own eyes."
Beinin spoke after Feldman.
His talk called lor a suspension of
U.S. aid to Israel as well as the inser
tion of a non-American, internation
al peace-keeping force in the region,
both of which drew applause.
He spent the bulk of his talk dis
cussing the current U.S. treatment
of the conllict, criticizing Secretary
of State Colin Powell's actions dur

ing his recent visit to the region.
"Powell should have gone to the
Jenin refugee camp to sec for him
self the extent of the death and de
struction wrought by Israel," he
said. "He should publicly have de
clared that the West Bank, the Gaza
Strip and East Jerusalem are occu
pied, not disputed territories ..."
He also called for Powell and
the U.S. government to stop "lec
tin ing [Palestinian leader] Yasir
Arafat about the need to do more
to stop terrorism" while he is re
strained by Israel.
"Arafat is not a charming man
or a skillful leader," Beinin said.
"But he is the elected president of
the Palestinian Authority and the
symbol of Palestinian national as
pirations and should be respected
as such."
Beinin concluded his speech by
associating the U.S.'s alliance with
Israel with the government's treat
ment of the conflict, and the detri
mental repercussions of U.S. aid.
Law student Shahid Buttar,
the rally's emcee, followed
Beinin's talk with a spoken-word
piece condemning U.S. policy

and calling lor freedom for both
Israelis and Palestinians.
Lerner, the second main speak
er, also called lot international me
diators as well as lor the withdrawal
of Israel to its pre-1907 borders,
with modifications. He lixused his
speech on recognizing that both
sides bore responsibility for the con
flict and that to oppose the policies
of Israeli President Ariel Sharon was
not tobeanti-Israel.
He began by unsuccessfully at
tempting to bring the counter
demonstrators over to the area in
fiont of the speakers where the
rally's supporters were situated.
"In one way, the choreography
of today represents, dramatizes the
very problem, and I want to invite
my Jewish brothers and sisters,
come close," Lerner said. "We can
be together, we don't have to Ix? sep
arate. Take a step forward, take a
step forward to reconciliation, this is
not a zero-sum game."
Lerner declared that he was a
Zionist who was proud of and sup
ported Israel, but that he also iden
tified with "the peace forces in Israel
who believe that the current policies

of the state of Israel violate the best
in Jewish tradition, the highest val
ues ofTorah and the highest values
of humanity."
Lerner urged equal treatment of
Palestinians and Israelis. He tailed
for Arafat to reject all forms of vio
lence as the only way to convince Is
raelis that ending the occupation isa
"path to safety." He called for
Sharon to"end the (xcupation" and
provide reparations lor Palestini
ans. 1 le also questioned the true in
tent of the recent Israeli incursion.
"Hie real issue is that Israel does
not want to give up its settlements
and consequently, the act of the
claim that the current incursions
into the West Bank cities is about
dismantling the operations of ter
ror is ridiculous," he said. "It is cre
ating more terrorists, not under
mining terrorists."
Rehm was the final speaker, lo
dising on the meaning of terrorism
and citing previous instances of U.S.
actions that would constitute terror
ism, according to its own definition
as determined by theTJ.S. Congress
in 1984. He also spoke of (he eu
phemisms used lor Israeli actions

propagated by the U.S. media.
I .ike < >ther speakers, Rehm called
for international monitors in the re
gion and suspended U.S. military
assistance to Israel. He went on to
describe the social and economic
strife of the Palestinians.
Though Rehm's speech was
planned to conclude the rally, dur
ing his talk graduate student
Kathryn Syssoyeva.a member of the
counter-rally, approached the
rally's organizers and requested that
the two groups physically join to
sing "(3d Yavo Shalom Alienu,"
which means "eventually peace will
be upon us," in the hopes that it
would give the more moderate rep
resentatives of each group the op
portunity to come together. The
event concluded with the groups
slowly joining and as people filtered
out, p<x kets of students and com
munity members remained for
more personal discussion.
Others opposing the rally cited
the need to stand by Israel despite
its policy.
" It's not as easy as one, two, three,
end occupation, one, two, three,
end U.S. aid to Israel," said second

year law student Daniel
kirschbaum. "Even if we don't sup
port their policy, we must respect
what they do as the legitimate gov
ernment of Israel.
"I think it's disingenuous to say
this was not a pro-Palestinian rally,"
Kirschbaum said.
Some attendees were frustrated
by the event's disunity. Palestinian
supporter freshman Rania Kltom
and freshman Danny Greene, part
of the counter-protest, discussed
their desire to bridge the gap be
tween the two groups, but said they
felt unable to do so.
During Syssoyeva's appeal for
the groups to join, Greene shouted
to the counter-ralliers, "If we feel
that we don't have a partner, we
need to integrate, guys. They're call
ing us over there."
Despite the final union of the
opposing sides on Friday, Rehm
questioned the ultimate meaning
of the gesture.
"It'cl be nice if people on a
sunny clay in Palo Alto could come
together," he said, " fell me what
difference it makes for the occupa
tion of Palestine."
