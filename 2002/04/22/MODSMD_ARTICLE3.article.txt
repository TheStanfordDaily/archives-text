# Mideast conflict sparks rallies
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Palestinian, Israeli and American flags
flew in the Oval at noon Friday when over
200 students, faculty and local community
members gathered in response to current
events in the Middle East â€” half partici
pating in a rally calling for international
intervention in the Israeli-Palestinian con
flict and a suspension of U.S. aid to Israel,
the other half protesting the message of
the rally.
Organized by an adhoc group of Stan
ford graduate students, the first rally was
advertised as aiming to "promote peace in
t he Middle East" as well as the "safety, dig
nity and human rights of all people" in the
region. It featured speeches by History
Prof. Joel Beinin, Rabbi and Editor of
Tikkun magazine Michael Lerner and
Drama and Classics Prof. Rush Rehm.
Concerned that the rally would be
filled with "anti-Israel messages," Jewish
students and the Stanford Israel Alliance,
supported by Hillel, planned a counter
tally, wary that references to "Israeli vic
tims or to Palestinian terrorism" would be
left out.
"That's our concern, that what's billed
as a pro-peace rally will be a very derisive
anti-Israel rally," said former Stanford Is
rael Alliance President Josh Saidoff, a se
nior, "We're adding a voice that's other

wise omitted from this event."
Those involved in the rally rejected the
notion that it was anti-Israel.
"If they're claiming that [the rally] is in
herently anti-Israel, I hope they would
separate the policies of their country from
the larger issues with Israel," said sociolo
gy graduate student Brian (lolwell, one of
the rally's organizers.
"I don't think that being critical of Is
raeli policy is the same as being anti-Israel
and being critical of Israeli policy is cer
tainly not being anti-peace," said Beinin,
who pointed out that almost all of the
rally's speakers were Jews.
The rally was civil throughout, though
there were extreme views present on both
sides that at times created an atmosphere
oftension.
Some carried signs saying "Nazism =
Zionism," while one student could be
heard shouting "He's a terrorist. Arafat is
a Nazi." Signs held by some counter-ral
liers read, "If it walks with Anti-Semites,
Squawks with Anti-Semites, it must be an
Anti-Semite" and "Israel wants peace. We
have no partner."
Sophomore VVael Salloum, who was
wearing a Palestinian flag draped around
his shoulders, said he initially came
dressed only in black to mourn the deaths
on both sides, but upon seeing the
counter-protesters, went back to get his
flag and signs.

"The reason I came here without a flag
and without posters was because it was
supposed to be a rally for both sides," Sal
loum said. "Unfortunately, it's been
turned into a political rally."
Yitzhak Santis of the Jewish Communi
ty Relations Council expressed dismay
over what he described as the lies being
propagated by the rally's speakers and
what he saw as the one-sidedness of the
rally's supporters.
"They say they're for peace, they say
they're for two suites, but you only see one
(lag here, the Palestinian flag," he said.
Just moments after, Salloum ap
proached Santis about the pronunciation
of the Hebrew in his sign, which read "Yes
to cooperation, no to violence," and Sal
loum assisted Santis with the Arabic.
The rally began with a brief introduc
tion by Colwell, who emphasized that
the University did not endorse the rally
and requested that those present act
with civility.
"We're trying to promote the idea of
peace," Colwell said. "We don't think that
the militant tactics are going to work in the
long term."
Jan Feldman, introduced as a member
ofthe local Jewish community and a peace
activist, then read a letter entitled "After
the outrage and tears," which described
