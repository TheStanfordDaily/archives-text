## 
### HELEN KIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Since the shooting death of Pedro Calderon
near the Stanford foothills a month ago, the
issue of safety on the Stanford campus has be
come a growing concern.
Calderon, a 20-year-old man from East Palo
Alto, had been suspected in numerous carjack
ings and was allegedly stealing a BMW on Stan
ford Ave. near Raimundo Way in the early af
ternoon of March 20. Palo Alto police officer
Jessica Perryman and Stanford Police Deputy
Jeff Bell both fired at Calderon after he
dragged Perryman with the BMW, but he was
struck with only one bullet.
Perryman and Bell are on administrative
leave while the shooting is investigated.
Safety on the usually calm streets of Stan
ford is a concern now, according to Santa
Clara County Supervisor and former Palo Alto

mayor Liz Kniss.
"I think that a heightened awareness and at
tention to security is evident," Kniss said. "The
sheriff's presence has intensified and there are
plans for more educational material to be dis
tributed to parked cars and to those who fre
quently walk the route.
"The safety issues have been highlighted at
many of our meetings since then. We take this
most seriously and plan to work with the 112 Palo
Alto Police Department] closely as well."
Kniss has asked the county executive to ex
amine safety issues on the Stanford campus, re
ported the Palo Alto Weekly.
Sgt. Dean Baker of the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Office Is investigating the incident, ac
cording to Deputy Terrance Helm of the Sher
iff's Office. The sheriffs office expects the inves
tigation to conclude at the end of April, he said.
"The Stanford campus was safe prior to this
incident and continues to be safe today," Helm

said. "The Stanford Police, like all other police
departments, are public servants. We are con
tinuously looking at ways to improve public
safety in the communities in which we serve."
Items from a car burglary that took place on
the Stanford campus earlier in the day on
March 20 were found in the BMW.
Detectives discovered that the car that
Calderon was driving had been stolen and was
associated with a series of carjackings, kidnap
pings and automobile thefts in San Mateo
County, Helm said. The San Mateo County
Sheriff's Office is investigating a series of crimes
that involve the BMW, he said.
The Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office still
is investigating the March 20 incident, accord
ing to Kniss.
"This was so regrettable," Kniss said. "We
know that all involved are concerned and sad
dened when such an unfortunate occurrence
takes place."
