Potential students from the
Class of 2006 participated in
events as diverse as a lecture panel
on transfer credit, an activity fair in
White Plaza and building sand cas
tles on (he Branner Boardwalk
over the past weekend.
Over 1,350 prospective fresh
men attended Admit Weekend.
The Daily followed two of these
prospective students and chroni
cled how their impressions about
Stanford changed over the last
four days.
Jennifer Huang, a 17-year-old
from Orange, Calif., intends to
study biology and apply to med
ical school after college. After at
tending some academic exposi
tions, she said about Stanford life,
"Meeting the professors and
hearing them, I think it was so neat
because it is nothing like high
school classes."
Huang thinks she will like the
learning environment that col
lege provides.
"These people were funny
and excited," she said. " I hey
were talking about the stuff that
they had discovered; it is so dif
ferent than learning from a
chemistry textbook."
Socially, she said her "horizons
were widened."

"1 saw people that were drink
ing and it was the first time that I
had heard the word 'sexiled,'
and it was a shock to me. 1 think
in my high school 1 was in a bit of
a bubble."

Huang continued, "There isn't
just one kind of person at Stan
ford, there is a whole spectrum."
She explained that meeting
