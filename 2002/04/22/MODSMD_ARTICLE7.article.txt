### BRENDAN MARTEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Potential students from the
Class of 2006 participated in
events as diverse as a lecture panel
on transfer credit, an activity fair in
White Plaza and building sand cas
tles on (he Branner Boardwalk
over the past weekend.
Over 1,350 prospective fresh
men attended Admit Weekend.
The Daily followed two of these
prospective students and chroni
cled how their impressions about
Stanford changed over the last
four days.
Jennifer Huang, a 17-year-old
from Orange, Calif., intends to
study biology and apply to med
ical school after college. After at
tending some academic exposi
tions, she said about Stanford life,
"Meeting the professors and
hearing them, I think it was so neat
because it is nothing like high
school classes."
Huang thinks she will like the
learning environment that col
lege provides.
"These people were funny
and excited," she said. " I hey
were talking about the stuff that
they had discovered; it is so dif
ferent than learning from a
chemistry textbook."
Socially, she said her "horizons
were widened."

"1 saw people that were drink
ing and it was the first time that I
had heard the word 'sexiled,'
and it was a shock to me. 1 think
in my high school 1 was in a bit of
a bubble."

Huang continued, "There isn't
just one kind of person at Stan
ford, there is a whole spectrum."
She explained that meeting

people was a little different than
she had expected it to be.
"At first it was a little scary be
cause it is easy to feel lonely and
like no one knows you," Huang
said. "1 thought my group of
friends would be spanning the en
tire 2,000 people . . . Of course it is
not, hut just in these past three
days I've met tons of people that I
have never met before."
"Admit Weekend may also have
helped her see what kind of won
derful, relaxed, social environ
ment Stanford has," said freshman
Timnit Gebru, who was Huang's
room host over the weekend.
Another thing that took I luang
by surprise was the diversity she
found at Stanford.
"I was talking to some of the
people that we met walking
around that were students here
and they said it was neat how
each person has something spe
cial about them which makes it
that they got into Stanford,"
Huang said. "You realize there is
something about each person
that is unique."
Huang said that the weekend

seemed like it was just a hint to
wards what college life would be
like.
"It was much more than 1 ex
pected it to be. It seems like it is
just a piece of what my life will be
for the next four years," she said.
"But now I know what to expect
and what to look forward to, and
that I should be wearing sandals to
the shower."
She said this weekend helped
her make her final college deci
sion.
"I am going to Stanford next
year," Huang said. "I guess you
want to know if you love it here,
but you can't really answer that
until you come and experience it
for yourself."
Arden Pennell, a 17-year-old
prospective freshman from New
York City, is still not sure what she
wants to study, but as an early de
cision applicant, she's positive that
she's coming.
"1 feel like I know my way
physically around the school a
lot better," she said. "I am start
ing to learn the retarded lingo a
little better and I know the basic
information about housing and
meal plans."
(Jenny Guzman, a freshman
who was Pennell's room host, ex
plained how her roommates and

she approached the task of hosting
a prospective freshman.
"We made her feel at home and
kept an eye out for her," Guzman
said. "I think she appreciated the
support, but (we) let her be inde
pendent too."
Pennell said that despite falling
asleep in a few of the lectures she
attended, she found the events
"well-organized and they gave us a
lot of information if you needed it:
I don't blame them for my lack of
an attention span," she said.
However, despite her personal
lack of interest in some of the
events, Pennell said that she
thought the weekend should re
main unchanged.
"Everyone that came being re
ally obsessed with going to lec
tures and academics got what
they wanted. People that didn't
have much interest in going to
lectures and speeches and things
had the chance to go to sporting
events and picnics," Pennell said.
"It allowed you to do whatever
you wanted."
She said that she liked the flexi
bility and opportunities Stanford
has to offer in terms of curriculum
and extracurricular activities.
"It seems like Stanford tries to
let you take the classes that you
want to take and learn what you

want to learn," Pennell said. "I
was really happy with all the op
tions you get for doing communi
ty service. I he I faas Center seems
really open and willing to work
with you."
J.T. Batson, a freshman house
host who helped said he thought
the goal of the weekend was to
"build relationships between
ProFros and other ProFros and
other students and fostering com
munication," Batson said.
Pennell commented that she
thought the social scene was no
ticeably toned down for the past
weekend, but she still liked it.
"I am sure social life is better on
weekends that are not Admit
Weekend," she said. "But I
thought it was nice how people
come and hang out and talk a lot.
People are always hanging out in
the lounge and I like that."
Pennell said that the weekend
"didn't really change my opinion
but it changed my excitement and
enthusiasm about coming next
year. 1 am definitely more excited
because now I have an idea of what
things will be like.
"I had fun hanging out with
cool people: I feel like 112 got to
know the school better and I am
more excited about going here
next year," Pennell said.

the lounge and I like that."
Pennell said that the weekend
"didn't really change my opinion
but it changed my excitement and
enthusiasm about coming next
year. 1 am definitely more excited
because now I have an idea of what
things will be like.
"I had fun hanging out with
cool people: I feel like 112 got to
know the school better and I am
more excited about going here
next year," Pennell said.
Potential students from the
Class of 2006 participated in
events as diverse as a lecture panel
on transfer credit, an activity fair in
White Plaza and building sand cas
tles on (he Branner Boardwalk
over the past weekend.
Over 1,350 prospective fresh
men attended Admit Weekend.
The Daily followed two of these
prospective students and chroni
cled how their impressions about
Stanford changed over the last
four days.
Jennifer Huang, a 17-year-old
from Orange, Calif., intends to
study biology and apply to med
ical school after college. After at
tending some academic exposi
tions, she said about Stanford life,
"Meeting the professors and
hearing them, I think it was so neat
because it is nothing like high
school classes."
Huang thinks she will like the
learning environment that col
lege provides.
"These people were funny
and excited," she said. " I hey
were talking about the stuff that
they had discovered; it is so dif
ferent than learning from a
chemistry textbook."
Socially, she said her "horizons
were widened."

"1 saw people that were drink
ing and it was the first time that I
had heard the word 'sexiled,'
and it was a shock to me. 1 think
in my high school 1 was in a bit of
a bubble."

Huang continued, "There isn't
just one kind of person at Stan
ford, there is a whole spectrum."
She explained that meeting

people was a little different than
she had expected it to be.
"At first it was a little scary be
cause it is easy to feel lonely and
like no one knows you," Huang
said. "1 thought my group of
friends would be spanning the en
tire 2,000 people . . . Of course it is
not, hut just in these past three
days I've met tons of people that I
have never met before."
"Admit Weekend may also have
helped her see what kind of won
derful, relaxed, social environ
ment Stanford has," said freshman
Timnit Gebru, who was Huang's
room host over the weekend.
Another thing that took I luang
by surprise was the diversity she
found at Stanford.
"I was talking to some of the
people that we met walking
around that were students here
and they said it was neat how
each person has something spe
cial about them which makes it
that they got into Stanford,"
Huang said. "You realize there is
something about each person
that is unique."
Huang said that the weekend

seemed like it was just a hint to
wards what college life would be
like.
"It was much more than 1 ex
pected it to be. It seems like it is
just a piece of what my life will be
for the next four years," she said.
"But now I know what to expect
and what to look forward to, and
that I should be wearing sandals to
the shower."
She said this weekend helped
her make her final college deci
sion.
"I am going to Stanford next
year," Huang said. "I guess you
want to know if you love it here,
but you can't really answer that
until you come and experience it
for yourself."
Arden Pennell, a 17-year-old
prospective freshman from New
York City, is still not sure what she
wants to study, but as an early de
cision applicant, she's positive that
she's coming.
"1 feel like I know my way
physically around the school a
lot better," she said. "I am start
ing to learn the retarded lingo a
little better and I know the basic
information about housing and
meal plans."
(Jenny Guzman, a freshman
who was Pennell's room host, ex
plained how her roommates and

she approached the task of hosting
a prospective freshman.
"We made her feel at home and
kept an eye out for her," Guzman
said. "I think she appreciated the
support, but (we) let her be inde
pendent too."
Pennell said that despite falling
asleep in a few of the lectures she
attended, she found the events
"well-organized and they gave us a
lot of information if you needed it:
I don't blame them for my lack of
an attention span," she said.
However, despite her personal
lack of interest in some of the
events, Pennell said that she
thought the weekend should re
main unchanged.
"Everyone that came being re
ally obsessed with going to lec
tures and academics got what
they wanted. People that didn't
have much interest in going to
lectures and speeches and things
had the chance to go to sporting
events and picnics," Pennell said.
"It allowed you to do whatever
you wanted."
She said that she liked the flexi
bility and opportunities Stanford
has to offer in terms of curriculum
and extracurricular activities.
"It seems like Stanford tries to
let you take the classes that you
want to take and learn what you

want to learn," Pennell said. "I
was really happy with all the op
tions you get for doing communi
ty service. I he I faas Center seems
really open and willing to work
with you."
J.T. Batson, a freshman house
host who helped said he thought
the goal of the weekend was to
"build relationships between
ProFros and other ProFros and
other students and fostering com
munication," Batson said.
Pennell commented that she
thought the social scene was no
ticeably toned down for the past
weekend, but she still liked it.
"I am sure social life is better on
weekends that are not Admit
Weekend," she said. "But I
thought it was nice how people
come and hang out and talk a lot.
People are always hanging out in
