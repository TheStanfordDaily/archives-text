Pastoral Council (Advisory Board)
STATEMENT OF CONCERN AND COMMITMENT
• We are deeply concerned for those who have been
hurt by the child sexual abuse committed by clergy,
as well as for their loved ones and others who feel
betrayed by these events.
• We condemn this abuse and the failure of church
leaders to deal responsibly with this abuse.
• We express our deep appreciations and respect for
the vast majority of clergy who serve their commu
nities with compassion and dedication.
• We remind members of our communities that the
"lay people" (non-clergy members) of the Catholic
Church, as well as the clergy, are at the heart of the
church.
• We commit ourselves to trying to help those hurt by
this abuse, and we invite anyone who wishes to con
tact us regarding this matter to do so; many of us are
listed in Stanford's on-line directory.
• We will be contacting Catholic communities at uni
versities around the country to invite collaboration
in assisting and influencing church leaders to
address the concerns noted above.
As a Catholic community we are moved by the Spirit of the
Gospel message to speak publicly about the recently revealed sins of
sexual abuse by some members of the clergy and about the related
crisis of leadership.
Many have been betrayed and injured by these sexual sins: most
grievously, of course, the victims and their families and friends but
also, by extension, the rest of us in the Church, including the vast
majority of clergy who have offered and continue to offer extraordi
nary pastoral and spiritual care. We commit ourselves to compas
sionate support for any in our community who are hurt or troubled
by any aspect of this scandal.
The failure of leadership by some church authorities is an even
more grievous sin with larger consequences. The problem lies not
just in the sexual abuse by some clergy, but in a system of church
governance that is out of touch with the life and needs of the Church
today.
Vatican II began to articulate an understanding of Church as the
whole people of God. Such an understanding requires careful con
sideration of the distinct but complementary roles of clergy and laity,
and the structures expressive of those roles.
We hope this brief statement is the beginning of a developing dia
logue among Catholics - priests and bishops and by people - about
the process of reform. We call on other Catholic communities to join
this dialogue and on our Catholic bishops to lead us to a newly
inspired and newly inspirited Church.
