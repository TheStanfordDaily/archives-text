## The 						Stanford Daily ASSU should re-evaluate voting procedures 
### 
Published Since 1891

The controversies stemming from last
week's ASSU elections have left a bad
taste in the mouths of some around
campus and partially spoiled an ex
cellently-run election. E-mails bashing certain
candidates and the immature behavior of a
number of students during the announcement
of the winners disappoint us.
What is, perhaps, more distressing is the
fact that the election may not have been
clearly won yet. The ASSU Constitution stip
ulates that the winning slate must garner at
least 50 percent of the votes in a series of in
stant run-offs. This year, the elected candi
dates may not have met the requirements of
the ASSU Constitution.
Although junior Monica Henestroza and
sophomore Nick Rodriguez have apparently
won the election, senior Patrick Crosetto has
filed a complaint with the Elections Commis-

sion that charges that these two candidates
did not receive a majority of all votes cast.
In some sense, Crosetto is right. Hene
stroza / Rodriguez did receive 2129 votes of
the 4056 votes cast in the sixth round. While
they carried a majority of those votes cast in
the sixth round, they did not receive a ma
jority of the 4604 total votes that were cast for
ASSU president / vice-president.
This is because — as many students learned
during the election — it is not necessary to spec
ify a candidate for all the choices presented on
the ASSU ballot. In fact, you can hurt a slate's
chance of being elected more if you do not spec
ify it as one of your choices. This system gives lit
tle incentive for students to specify choices be
yond those candidates who they really do like.
This represents a fundamental flaw in the sys
tem used for electing the ASSU executives.
It is possible that the ASSU will decide that

Henestroza / Rodriguez have legitimately
won, according to the ASSU constitution.
The ASSU is the expert on its documents,
and we do not presume to know them better.
We have no qualms with the election of
Henestroza / Rodriguez, either. We feel that
they will make excellent executives. Our
problem is with the election procedures. We
believe that they should be changed in order
to have more fair, constitutional and clear
cut election results in the future.
We also believe that the idea of an instant
run-off election — while appealing on paper
—must be examined more carefully. Stu
dents often think strategically before voting:
some rank joke candidates and write-ins
above their serious second-choice candidate
in order to improve their first-choice's
chances of winning. And the system simply
confuses other students.

The ASSU election should not be an exer
cise in strategy and game theory. It should be
straightforward, fair, and easy to under
stand. Regardless of the results of Crosetto's
challenge, a re-examination of the voting
procedure is in line.
We hope that the problems with this year's
election will serve as a lesson for next year's
ASSU officers. We suggest an improved,
straightforward voting mechanism be put in
place to prevent a recurrence of this problem.
Democracy, ideally, represents the voice of
the people. However, when the people begin
to play strategy games with their votes, issues
unfortunately become subsumed to popularity
and herd mentality.
We hope that the ASSU will investigate
ways in which it can improve the elections
process in order to foster a more equitable
election next year.
