# SHOOTING FROM THE HIP
## Sinning in the City 
### 
Pound for pound, there's no more
exciting U.S. city than Las Vegas.
The town exerts an almost hyp
notic pull on our national con
sciousness, all out of proportion to its
size. After all, going strictly by the num
bers, Las Vegas is nothing to write home
about. In the 2000 Census it weighed in
as the U.S. city 30th in size, a little bigger
than Cleveland and a tad smaller than
Tucson, Arizona. But how many movie
storylines take place in Tucson? How
many college kids go on raucous road
trips to Cleveland? When it comes to in
tangible measures of importance, you
just can't beat Vegas, baby.
If course, not everyone is a Las Vegas
fan. After all, you don't get the nickname

"Sin City" for being a
warm and fuzzy place.
Some social conservatives
don't particularly like
gambling, drinking and
sex, which are the three
hallmark Vegas pastimes.
But for my money,
Las Vegas is both a
damn fun place to visit

and also a testament to all the best quali
ties of America. Behind the garish neon
and sequined showgirls, (lie underpin
nings of Vegas are as old-fashioned
American as baseball and apple pie.
To begin with, the very fact that Las
Vegas sprung up in the first place is a ster
ling example of American ingenuity. Any
one who's spent time traveling through
the Mojave Desert knows that it's an in
credibly forbidding place, sort of like Hell
with a lot more attitude and a lot less
water. It's the kind of place where you
half-expect to see the bleached skeletons
of former explorers, still clad in their ex
pedition gear a la Far Side cartoons.
But in the midst of this barren waste
land, the famous gangster Bugsy Seigel
decided to build a casino. All common
sense said that such a venture would
never succeed, but lo and behold, it did.
Soon other entrepreneurs followed suit,
and Las Vegas was on its way. You can
keep your Orville Wrights and Thomas
Kdisons — for me, there's no greater ex
ample of American innovation than the
creation of a hedonistic playland out of a
scorching, empty desert.
But not only was the creation of Las
Vegas an audaciously risky venture, the
whole economy of the city is based on
risk. People from all over the world
come to try and score an inside straight,
pull out a 21 to beat the dealer's 20, and
put their cash down on Holy Cross
against Kansas with 50-1 odds. Sure,
they say that the house always wins in
the end. But that doesn't mean that it's
impossible, with a little skill and a little
luck, to take the house every now and
then.
I bis frank acceptance of risk is a criti
cal component of American capitalism; it

is the thing that links Wall Street in
vestors, Silicon Valley venture capitalists
and small-business entrepreneurs all
over the country. And in Las Vegas you
see financial risk in its purest form —
millions of people laying their money on
the line, hoping to turn their cash into
something bigger.
Las Vegas is also a stunning example
of American multiculturalism, even if
the cultural diversity is entirely synthet
ic. Stroll the Las Vegas Strip, and within
10 minutes you'll pass by an Egyptian
pyramid, a Roman temple, an Arabian
palace and a Parisian cityscape. The
only place that could rival this cultural
assortment might be Disney's Epcot
Center, but Las Vegas gets the edge by
having fewer obnoxious kids with Mick
ey Mouse hats on.
Even though this diversity is manufac
tured, it's still enlightening. After all, there
are plenty of authentic touches. Luxor has
an exhibit on mummies that would do any
museum proud, the Bellagio features
dozens of genuine Renaissance paintings,
and the staff at New York, New York is so
concerned with authenticity that they're
actually rude to you.
Finally, the laissez-faire attitude that
Las Vegas takes towards vice is an exam
ple that the rest of the country would do
well to follow. The general attitude of the
municipal and state governments there
is essentially one of: "You can do what
ever you want as long as you don't hurt
other people."
Want to blow your Social Security
check on slot machines? Go right ahead.
Feel like walking around with open con
tainers of alcohol? No skin olf our noses.
Decide to make some extra money by
having sex with strangers? Hey, your
body, your choice.
There's no doubt that Las Vegas and
Nevada laws allow for some really bad
lifestyle choices. Bui when you get right
down to it, it's not the government's job
to prevent people from making bad
lifestyle choices. The freedom to do
stupid things is as important an Ameri
can freedom as any other. And for every
person who wrecks his life riding the Las
Vegas carousel, there are a thousand
more who simply have a great time fora
few days or weeks.
No, social conservatives might not like
Las Vegas very much. But, leaving aside
that unpleasant man running the Justice
Department, social conservatives don't
have the final say in this country. And
I hey certainly don't rule in the glorious
city of Las Vegas, where men and
women have created, like magic, a shim
mering Shangri-La out of a bleak desert.
Their creation is a credit to themselves,
their country, and all of us.

Pound for pound, there's no more
exciting U.S. city than Las Vegas.
The town exerts an almost hyp
notic pull on our national con
sciousness, all out of proportion to its
size. After all, going strictly by the num
bers, Las Vegas is nothing to write home
about. In the 2000 Census it weighed in
as the U.S. city 30th in size, a little bigger
than Cleveland and a tad smaller than
Tucson, Arizona. But how many movie
storylines take place in Tucson? How
many college kids go on raucous road
trips to Cleveland? When it comes to in
tangible measures of importance, you
just can't beat Vegas, baby.
If course, not everyone is a Las Vegas
fan. After all, you don't get the nickname

"Sin City" for being a
warm and fuzzy place.
Some social conservatives
don't particularly like
gambling, drinking and
sex, which are the three
hallmark Vegas pastimes.
But for my money,
Las Vegas is both a
damn fun place to visit

and also a testament to all the best quali
ties of America. Behind the garish neon
and sequined showgirls, (lie underpin
nings of Vegas are as old-fashioned
American as baseball and apple pie.
To begin with, the very fact that Las
Vegas sprung up in the first place is a ster
ling example of American ingenuity. Any
one who's spent time traveling through
the Mojave Desert knows that it's an in
credibly forbidding place, sort of like Hell
with a lot more attitude and a lot less
water. It's the kind of place where you
half-expect to see the bleached skeletons
of former explorers, still clad in their ex
pedition gear a la Far Side cartoons.
But in the midst of this barren waste
land, the famous gangster Bugsy Seigel
decided to build a casino. All common
sense said that such a venture would
never succeed, but lo and behold, it did.
Soon other entrepreneurs followed suit,
and Las Vegas was on its way. You can
keep your Orville Wrights and Thomas
Kdisons — for me, there's no greater ex
ample of American innovation than the
creation of a hedonistic playland out of a
scorching, empty desert.
But not only was the creation of Las
Vegas an audaciously risky venture, the
whole economy of the city is based on
risk. People from all over the world
come to try and score an inside straight,
pull out a 21 to beat the dealer's 20, and
put their cash down on Holy Cross
against Kansas with 50-1 odds. Sure,
they say that the house always wins in
the end. But that doesn't mean that it's
impossible, with a little skill and a little
luck, to take the house every now and
then.
I bis frank acceptance of risk is a criti
cal component of American capitalism; it

is the thing that links Wall Street in
vestors, Silicon Valley venture capitalists
and small-business entrepreneurs all
over the country. And in Las Vegas you
see financial risk in its purest form —
millions of people laying their money on
the line, hoping to turn their cash into
something bigger.
Las Vegas is also a stunning example
of American multiculturalism, even if
the cultural diversity is entirely synthet
ic. Stroll the Las Vegas Strip, and within
10 minutes you'll pass by an Egyptian
pyramid, a Roman temple, an Arabian
palace and a Parisian cityscape. The
only place that could rival this cultural
assortment might be Disney's Epcot
Center, but Las Vegas gets the edge by
having fewer obnoxious kids with Mick
ey Mouse hats on.
Even though this diversity is manufac
tured, it's still enlightening. After all, there
are plenty of authentic touches. Luxor has
an exhibit on mummies that would do any
museum proud, the Bellagio features
dozens of genuine Renaissance paintings,
and the staff at New York, New York is so
concerned with authenticity that they're
actually rude to you.
Finally, the laissez-faire attitude that
Las Vegas takes towards vice is an exam
ple that the rest of the country would do
well to follow. The general attitude of the
municipal and state governments there
is essentially one of: "You can do what
ever you want as long as you don't hurt
other people."
