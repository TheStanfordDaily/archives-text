SLAC member calls for code of conduct
Yesterday, April 22, marked the open
ing of contract negotiations for employees
of Bon Appetit, a food service company at
Stanford whose employees work at Tres
sider, the Graduate School of Business,
and other locations on campus. Service
Employees International Union Local
715, United Stanford Workers, repre
sents most Bon Appetit workers on cam
pus. This year's negotiations will occur in
the midst of the Coalition for Labor Jus
tice's Code of Conduct campaign. In fact,
this current contract negotiation will ad
dress the central issues of the Code of
Conduct, reminding us how important it
is to support a code that would institu
tionalize worker respect through fair
wages and benefits at Stanford.
Bon Appetit employees, who will not
be covered under University President
John Hennessey's new "living wage" pol
icy, are demanding parity wages and
benefits. A parity policy guarantees that
all workers with the same job receive the
same wage, and that in cases where there
is a disparity between wages, the lower
wage should be increased to match the
higher wage. Bon Appetit employees do
(he same work as Stanford Dining Ser
vices employees, who work in residence
dining halls, but they earn in some cases
over $2 per hour less. Some Bon Appetit
workers have been forced to take second
jobs in order to survive and provide for
their family due to the high cost of living
in this area. This is unacceptable.
Another major issue is the cost of health
care for Stanford workers and their fami
lies. Bon Appetit also deserve the same
benefits as directly hired Stanford em
ployees. They have the right to affordable
health insurance for their dependents.
Many currently depend on federal assis
tance for their health care. This is a dis
grace to Stanford. No worker on this cam
pus should be on public assistance for
health care or live under poverty-level
conditions. The Code of Conduct would
provide everyone who works on this cam
pus a living wage, affordable health care,
the right to organize, and job protection
from outsourcing.
Increasingly, Stanford is subcontracting
out labor in order to absolve itself of the re
sponsibility to be a fair employer. Stanford
should not be cutting costs on the backs of
the lowest paid members of this communi
ty. The Code of Conduct states that no sub
contracting will be used in order to under
cut wages and benefits or replace jobs that
are already being performed by directly
hired Stanford employees.
The Bon Appetit contract negotiations
mark a crucial moment for the Stanford
community to show its support for Stan
ford workers. As students, faculty, alumni,
graduate students, and administrators, we
must support not only the people who
prepare and serve our food, but those who
clean our hallways and bathrooms, tend
Stanford grounds, and work in all other
capacities at Stanford. We must commit
ourselves to making this a community
where every employee enjoys a comfort

able standard of living. We need a (lode of
Conduct now!

Alum responds to Kallman
It was painful to read the comments
made by Josh Kallman in The Daily's Let
ters to the Editor (April 19). As a Stanford
graduate and part-time volunteer for
Campus Crusade for Christ who helped to
organize the Henry Schaefer lecture, I felt
the need to clarify and respond to some of
the issues raised by Kallman.
First, the purpose of sponsoring Schae
fer's lecture on "The Big Bang, Stephen
Hawking, and God" was to provide an op
portunity to present a particular issue con
cerning the relationship between religion,
specifically Christianity, and science. The
contentious relationship between science
and religion has a long history. In a pre
sentation of this relationship, there will in
evitably be differing opinions espoused and
disputed. Even among Christians t here are
a wide variety of positions on the religion
science meld. We did not expect everyone
to agree with Schaefer.
However, we would like to address the
serious (yet seemingly pejorative) allega
tions leveled against both the Campus Cru
sade for Christ and Schaefer. Namely, that
the ideas and opinions expressed were
"proselytizing and brainwashing . . . mis
leading and highly immoral... intended
to confuse as well as beguile."
From reading Kallman's letter, 1
thought his most serious objection was
that Schaefer's talk was purposefully and
misleadingly advertised. From my knowl
edge, our advertisements billed this lec
ture as one that would address three
things: The theory of the Big Bang, ideas
from Stephen Hawking, and God.
Perhaps Kallman hoped fora more
thorough discussion on certain ideas. Per
haps Kallman would have agreed with a
different perspective. But that does not
mean that the issues were not addressed.
Even Kallman must acknowledge that
those topics were covered. In his own
words, the lecture began "discussing the
basics of modern physics and the Big
Bang" including "quotes from famous
physicists, including Stephen Hawking,
regarding their beliefs on a divine order
or a supreme being."
We tried to be as upfront as possible
that this lecture was sponsored by Campus
Crusade for Christ. Apart from an unfor
tunate omission in one of The Daily ad
vertisements, we included our name on
every poster and all advertisements. We
also made sure to include our name on
every e-mail announcement and told
members who volunteered to announce
the lecture in various forums to be sure to
identify themselves with Campus Crusade
for CChrist. As Kallman alluded to in his let
ter, we also made sure to announce that
the lecture was sponsored by Campus
Crusade for Christ before it began so that
there would be no confusion.
We also went out of our way to explain

that we wanted feedback on the comment
cards and only if they wanted more infor
mation from Campus Crusade did audi
ence members need to put their name and
e-mail on the bottom of the card. We take
the comments we receive into serious con
sideration. Sponsoring Schaefer was a di
rect result of last year's comment cards in
which the overwhelming majority of stu
dents who attended wanted to hear more
on the topic of the relationship between
science and faith.
Ultimately, I'd like to emphasize that
there was no sinister conspiracy to push an
agenda onto a brainwashed audience. If a
"thoughtful lecture on real issues" was not
what Kail man experienced on Wednesday
night, either I or another Campus Crusade
lor Christ member would be very willing to
have a thoughtful conversation with him.
We want to encourage people to begin
thinking of how their spiritual lives may be
integrated into intellectual spheres.
Whether they continue the discussion with
us or with other people in their lives who
have made those connections, our main
concern is that discussion is encouraged.

SEAS strives to promote justice
While we're happy that SEAS, an orga
nization for social and environmental jus
tice, "won" its special fees campaign, we'd
like to address broader concerns ad
dressed by The Daily's partial endorse
ment of our group.
A main claim was that many students
may not agree with our political stances.
We find it interesting and discomforting
that such a blanket statement was made,
that no examples were given.
We consistently strive to reach out to the
whole campus, to educate others about our
passions, about the problems that we see
and about the need to address them. So
we're desperately wondering: What would
many people disagree with? That we
shouldn't send cancer-causing waste to an
incinerator in a low-income community of
color? That it's a better idea to build more
schools than prisons? That we should stand
up for civil liberties and thoughtfully ques
tion our government's behavior?
We strive to translate gcxxl intentions to
good ac tions in an honest yet strategic way.
Balance and feasibility are consistently on
our mind, and we wish nothing more than
to educate people about problems and help
get those problems solved. We believe that
to reduce suffering, the needs of those
we're trying to help must be addressed. We
encourage people who see problems and
would like to fight for s(xial change to e
mail us at seas@seas.stanford.edu.
