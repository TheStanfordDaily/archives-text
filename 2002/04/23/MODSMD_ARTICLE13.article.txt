feated No. 5 UCLA, 6-1
Saturday: No. 2 Stanford
defeated No. 10 Southern Cal

Stanford beat two previously
undefeated conference foes on
their home courts to win the
Pac-10, knocking off No. 5
UCLA (16-4, (5-2) and No. 10
USC (17-7, 7-1) by the scores of
6-1 and 5-2. respectively.'
Bui the Cardinal's work is
hardly done with the Pac-10
team title. The Pac-10 Individu
als and NCAA Championships
are still on the horizon.
On Friday, the Cardinal took
on a tough UCLA team that had
surprised Stanford by winning
the doubles point earlier this
month in a non-conference
match played at Stanford. Al
though the Cardinal won that
match, 6-1, it nonetheless ap
proached the rematch with
more intensity.
"We came out tougher and

ready to go from the first point,
and that set the tone for the sin
gles matches," freshman Erin
Burdette said. "We were defi
nitely pumped up."
I his time, the Cardinal out
worked the Bruins and won the
doubles point.
Seniors Lauren Kalvaria and
Gabriela Lastra, the No. 1 tan
dem in the nation, held off the
nation's second-best team of
Petya Marinova and Sara Walk
er, winning 8-6.
No. 17 Barnikow and Bur
dette avenged their loss in the
last match by upsetting No. 3
Megan Bradley and Lauren
Fisher, 8-5, securing the team
point lor the Cardinal.
Senior Keiko Tokucla and
freshman Story fweedie-Yates
defeated Mariko Fritz-Krockow
and Sarah Gregg, 8-6, complet
ing the doubles sweep.
"I think it's awesome that we
came out and won doubles,"
Barnikow said. "We really
wanted to show them that we
had gone back and worked on
our doubles."
In singles, the Cardinal
flexed its muscle, winning the
top five flights despite the Bru
ins' shuffling their lineup.
Kalvaria, ranked fourth na
tionally in singles, won a
marathon against No. 8 Walk
er, 5-7, 6-4, 7-5. No. 12 Lastra
was matched up against hard
hitting No. 3 Megan Bradley,

weekend at No. 5 UCLA and No. 10 USC. Stanford wrapped up its
15th consecutive Pac-10 title with wins over the Bruins and the Trojans.
and proceeded to shut her down,
winning 7-5, 6-1. No. 14
Barnikow frustrated Marinova,
6-4, 6-0.
No. 23 Burdette led the second
half of the lineup by outclassing
Gregg, 6-2, 6-1, and Tokuda han
dled Fisher, 6-4, 6-1. UCLA's
Catherine Hawley edged sopho
more Emilia Anderson, 6-7, 6-3,
1-0 (10-6), for the Bruins' only
team point.
The players on both teams had
to adapt because "it was really, re
ally windy," Barnikow Said.
"They weren't pretty matches,
but it was okay."
Having taken care of UCLA, all
that stood between Stanford and
the l'ac-10 crown was USC, the
lone remaining undefeated con
ference foe.

"That match determined the
Pac-10 champion, so were just [as
focused] going into that one," Bur
dette said.
The Cardinal jumped out to
an early lead by winning the dou
bles point.
Kalvaria and Lastra knocked
off No. 6 Tiffany Brymer and
Jewel Peterson, 8-5, and
Barnikow and Burdette domi
nated No. 28 Anita Loyola and
Luana Magnani, 8-1, to clinch the
team point. Tokuda and Tweed
ie-Yates came up short against
Bernadette Bayani and Melissa
Esmero, losing 8-3.
Surprisingly, the Women of
Troy provided a stiller challenge
in singles than in doubles, winning
two of six matches.
No. C) Peterson overpowered
Kalvaria, 6-2,6-2, in first-flight sin
gles, and Esmero defeated Ander
son, 6-0, 7-6, in the sixth flight.
Although sandwiched by USC
victories, the middle flights were

the meat of the victory for Stan
ford, as the four team points won
there secured the victory.
Lastra dismantled No. 35 Mag
nani, 6-2, 6-1, and Barnikow put
away Loyola, 6-2, 6-2. Burdette
came back to defeat No. 99 Diaz, 2-
6, 6-3, 6-4, and Tokuda beat
Brymer, 6-0, 7-5. ♦
"We just took care of our busi
ness," Burdette said.
The Cardinal was not fazed by
the weather, the home crowds, or
the new lineups, all of which bode
well for the rest of the year.
Up next for the Cardinal are
Pac-10 Individuals this Thursday
through Sunday in Ojai, Calif. The
team wants to do well, but the
NCAA Championships remain the
main focus.
"I'm just going to go down
there and work on some things,"
Barnikow said. "What we want is to
peak for NCAAs."
The NCAA Championships
begin May 10.
