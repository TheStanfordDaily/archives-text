more intensity.

ready to go from the first point,
and that set the tone for the sin
gles matches," freshman Erin
Burdette said. "We were defi
nitely pumped up."

worked the Bruins and won the
doubles point.

point lor the Cardinal.

came out and won doubles,"

wanted to show them that we
had gone back and worked on
our doubles."
In singles, the Cardinal
flexed its muscle, winning the
top five flights despite the Bru
ins' shuffling their lineup.

tionally in singles, won a
marathon against No. 8 Walk
er, 5-7, 6-4, 7-5. No. 12 Lastra
