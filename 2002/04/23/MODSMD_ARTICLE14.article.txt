# BYU ends Cardinal's season in MPSFs
## 
### KATRINA LAKE STAFF WRITER 
It was the kind of season where
every point mattered, where there
were no guarantees and where up
sets were so common it seemed
strange to call them upsets.

MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
Saturday: No. 4 BYU defeats
No. 6 Stanford in the first round
of the MPSF Tournament, 30-24,
30-23, 24-30, 29-31,21-19

And it was a game that embodied
all of these characteristics that
ended the season for the Cardinal
volleyball team.
The No. 6 Stanford squad (16-
10, 15-7 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) packed its bags for
Provo, Utah for the first round of
the MPSF tournament against
No. 4 Brigham Young (23-6, 16-
6) on Saturday.
When die dust cleared, the (lardi
nal's season was over, as the (lougars
edged Stanford, 3-2, in a tightly con
tested match that was eerily reminis
cent of UCLA's 3-2 win over the Car
dinal in the lirst round of last year's
MPSF tournament.
The Cougars hosted the Cardi
nal for a pair of matches in January,
and Stanford surprised many by
splitting matches with the defend
ing national champions.

This time around, there was
more on the line than conference
standing, as the winner would con
tinue to the second round of the
tournament, and the loser would
abruptly end its season. With only
one at-large bid available for the
NCAA tournament, both Stanford
and BVU needed to win the MPSF
tournament to get a shot at the
N(<AA title.
In the last week of regular-sea
son play, the Cardinal was unable to
gain home-court advantage with a
loss to No. 1 Pepperdine. BYU split
matches with No. 2 I lawaii to earn
the right to play at Smith Field
house this weekend.
That meant that Stanford would
be playing for its season 011 Satur
day in front of 1,757 of the Cougars'
notoriously loudmouthed fans.
"Crowds at BYU tend to be
rowdy, merciless hecklers," said
Cardinal head coach Don Shaw.
Fhe crowds may have gotten to
Stanford early, as the Cougars
pushed Stanford's season to the
brink with easy wins in the first
two games.
Cougar hitting percentages of
.455 and .577 in the first two games
overpowered the Cardinal, which
could only hit .333 and .273, as
Stanford fell, 30-24 and 30-23, in
the opening frames.
