# BYU ends Cardinal's season in MPSFs

It was the kind of season where
every point mattered, where there
were no guarantees and where up
sets were so common it seemed
strange to call them upsets.

MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
Saturday: No. 4 BYU defeats
No. 6 Stanford in the first round
of the MPSF Tournament, 30-24,
30-23, 24-30, 29-31,21-19

And it was a game that embodied
all of these characteristics that
ended the season for the Cardinal
volleyball team.
The No. 6 Stanford squad (16-
10, 15-7 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) packed its bags for
Provo, Utah for the first round of
the MPSF tournament against
No. 4 Brigham Young (23-6, 16-
6) on Saturday.
When die dust cleared, the (lardi
nal's season was over, as the (lougars
edged Stanford, 3-2, in a tightly con
tested match that was eerily reminis
cent of UCLA's 3-2 win over the Car
dinal in the lirst round of last year's
MPSF tournament.
The Cougars hosted the Cardi
nal for a pair of matches in January,
and Stanford surprised many by
splitting matches with the defend
ing national champions.

This time around, there was
more on the line than conference
standing, as the winner would con
tinue to the second round of the
tournament, and the loser would
abruptly end its season. With only
one at-large bid available for the
NCAA tournament, both Stanford
and BVU needed to win the MPSF
tournament to get a shot at the
N(<AA title.
In the last week of regular-sea
son play, the Cardinal was unable to
gain home-court advantage with a
loss to No. 1 Pepperdine. BYU split
matches with No. 2 I lawaii to earn
the right to play at Smith Field
house this weekend.
That meant that Stanford would
be playing for its season 011 Satur
day in front of 1,757 of the Cougars'
notoriously loudmouthed fans.
"Crowds at BYU tend to be
rowdy, merciless hecklers," said
Cardinal head coach Don Shaw.
Fhe crowds may have gotten to
Stanford early, as the Cougars
pushed Stanford's season to the
brink with easy wins in the first
two games.
Cougar hitting percentages of
.455 and .577 in the first two games
overpowered the Cardinal, which
could only hit .333 and .273, as
Stanford fell, 30-24 and 30-23, in
the opening frames.
BYU's well-rounded team took

advantage of Stanford inconsisten
cy and exhibited its depth. The
Cougars successfully distributed the
ball evenly among the squad with
live Cougars players recording lour
kills apiece in the first game.
With Stanford down by two
games, many assumed that any
optimism from the Cardinal
would have been extinguished
and the team's NCAA aspirations
were over.
But just when it seemed like
BYU had the match completely
under control, the truly topsy-turvy
nature of the MPSF began to show
its lace.
In the third game, the Cardi
nal gave BYU a taste of its own
medicine, distributing the ball
across the team.
Kills from junior setter Kevin
Hansen, junior middle blocker
Paul Bocage, freshman middle
blocker Chris Sandman, junior
opposite Curt Toppel and junior
outside hitter Billy Strickland
pushed Stanford to a 30-24 win in
the third.
On the same vein of energy,
the Cardinal field on fora critical
31-29 win in game four to force a
decisive fifth game. Toppel
demonstrated why he was one of
the top players in the league,
recording a game-high nine kills,

adding to his cumulative team
high of 25 for the night.
Game live began with BYU tak
ing a 0-4 lead, which quickly re
versed to become a Cardinal 9-8
lead. The teams would tie 14 teams
in the final game.
Fifth games are usually played
to 15 points, l>iii the two teams
fought off game point after
game point. Stanford served for
tlie match at 14-13, but the
Cougars stayed alive behind
one of Mike Wall's match-high
33 kills. BYU then served for
the match live times, but the
Cardinal kept its season going
on each rally.
The sixth time, however, Stan
ford was not so fortunate. Joaquin
Acosta's 13th kill of the game
closed out a 21-19 win for BYU.
Stanford outblocked the
Cougars 1 1-5, behind live blocks
each from Bocage and Sandman.
But BYU outdug the Cardinal
50-29 and posted 91 kills to Stan
lord's 7(i, with five Cougar play
ers finishing with double-digit
kill totals.
The Cougars will head to Mal
ibu for the semifinal round of the
MPSK Tournament to face Pep
perdine on Thursday.
Stanford wraps up its season at
16-10. The Cardinal made a first
round exit from the MPSF tour
nament for the third straight
year, as Stanford is winless in
postseason play since its 1997
NCAA championship season.
