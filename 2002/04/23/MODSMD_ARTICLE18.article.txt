# Card splits in East
## 
### ANNIE NYBORG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Most sports buds scoff at the
idea of a "moral" victory, but the
Stanford women's lacrosse team
isn't so quick to discount tfie con
cept. Splitting its games during its
last non-conference trip of the sea
son on the East Coast this week
end, the Cardinal recognized that
the statement it made was perhaps
more enduring than the final
numbers on the scoreboard.

WOMEN'S LACROSSE
Friday: Stanford 13, Boston
College 10
Sunday: No. 20 New Hamp
shire 10, Stanford 9

.The Cardinal (7-7 overall, 6-0
Mountain Pacific Lacrosse League)
played impressive games, beating
Boston College (7-8),. 13-10, and
barely falling to No. 20 New Hamp
shire (10-4),10-9, in a tightly con
tested affair. More importantly,
Stanford showed that its budding
West Coast squad could hang with
some of the East's better programs.
"This weekend was a huge victo
ry for us, especially because last year
we lost these two games by huge
margins," said sophomore attacker
Tiffany Chao.
Stanford's first game of the
trip against the Eagles on Friday
was one of its best performances
of the season.
Freshmen midfielder Julia
Calzonetti put Stanford on the
scoreboard with the first goal just
46 seconds into the game. She
was quickly followed by fellow
freshman midfielder Kelsey
Twist, who netted the first of her
three goals two minutes later.
But the Eagles answered later in
the half, scoring three straight to
take a 5-4 lead. Freshman defender
Nina Pantano's only goal of the
game with 7:26 remaining in the
half sent the teams into halftime
tied at 5-5.

Stanford regained control with a
pair of goals early in the second half
and never looked back.
Calzonetti scored her third of
the game with 3:28 to go, as six dif
ferent Cardinal players combined
to chalk up eight goals for Stanford
in the second half.
Senior attacker Liz Britt and
freshman attacker Claire Calzonet
ti each tallied two goals for Stan
ford. Sophomore midfielders Noor
Dawood and Abbi Hills also found
the back of the net for the Cardinal.
Junior goalkeeper Virginia
Solomon played another strong
game, tallying eight saves in the
Cardinal's first non-league win of
the season.
* " We were excited to be out East,"
said junior attacker Kim Cahill.
"Against Boston College the team
really played up to its potential.
Both teams pushed each other to
play up to higher levels."
Riding a four-game winning
streak into its game against New
Hampshire, Stanford looked like it
might be on its way to its fifth
straight win when Julia Calzonetti
got one past Wildcats' goalie
Danielle Martin just 26 seconds in.
But New Hampshire burst that
bubble quickly, notching five of the
next six goals and heading into the
half with a 5-2 lead. The Wildcats
added three more in the first 5:30
of the second half.
Down 8-2, Stanford finally got
into the game for the final 20 min
utes, making it look like New
Hampshire's first appearance in
the national rankings in 11 years
might be short-lived.
Twist did most of the damage in
the Stanford comeback as she
scored four times in 10 minutes to
bring the Cardinal to within three
with 10 minutes to go.
"Our team has a tendency to
pick it up right at the end and at
UNH we mounted a huge come
back right at the end," Chao said.
"Even though she's just a fresh
man, Kelsey really took control of
the game and inspired everyone.

In the middle of the game she did
a dance at center that got every
one into a better mood and picked
everyone up."
Jessie C Jroszkowski's sixth goal of
t he game with 8:43 to play put New
Hampshire ahead 1 ()-(>, but it was
all Stanford the rest of the way.
Hills, Britt and Pantano scored
for Stanford in a span of 3:20 to pull
the Cardinal within one, but that
was as close as it would get as the
clock ran out with the Wildcats

ahead, 10-9.
Pan til no finished with two goals
and Twist added an assist for five
points in the game for Stanford.
Martin recorded seven saves for
New Hampshire, while Meagan
Gavin added three assists.
Playing back on the West Coast
for the last few weeks of the season,
the Cardinal will battle California
this Saturday and finish off the reg
ular season at home against UC-
Davis on Tuesday.
