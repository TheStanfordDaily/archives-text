# Men's track shines in SoCal
## 
### DANIEL URBAN STAFF WRITER 
l he Stanford men's track squad competed at
the Mt. SAC Relays and the Pomona-Pitzer Invita
tional April 19 to April 21, and while the weekend
in southern (California did not yield as many quali
fiers for the NCAA Championships as the Cardinal
had hoped, it was nonetheless marked by some
stellar individual performances.
Redshirt sophomores Grant Robison and Louis
Luchini lit up the track in the 5,000 meters at Mt.
SAC, both running personal-best times that rank
them near the top of the Stanford record books.
Robison placed 14th in the stacked field, which
included post-collegiate runners such as the race's
winner, Kenyan Bernard Lagat. Robison edged out
Colorado's Dathan Ritzenhein, and his time of 13
minutes, 40.30 seconds is the fourth-fastest time in
school history and an automatic NCAA qualifier.
Luchini followed Ritzenhein for 16th place,
running an automatic qualifying time of
13:42.31, his personal best and the fifth-fastest in
Stanford's history.
Sophomore Seth Hejny followed not far behind,
posting a 19th-place finish in a provisional qualify
ing time of 13:50.77.
Having run a time 0f28:46.88 in the 10,000 me
ters at the Stanford Invitational, Luchini has now
picked up two automatic qualifiers in his only two
races of the season.
Already qualified for the two events he would like

ly run at the NCAAs, Luchini had no need to try to
keep his 100 percent success rate going, and made
the 5,000 meters his only race of the weekend.
Robison, however, ran the 1,500 meters with only
one day to recover from his performance in the 5,000
meters. Showing no signs of being worn out, he ran
another personal best time, 3:42.77, lor fifth place
and a provisional qualification for NCAAs.
Stanford also enjoyed the presence of three of its
best athletes, veteran seniors Jonathon Riley and
Gabe Jennings and junior Michael Ponikvar.
Aside from one appearance during the fall cross
country season, former Olympian and NC lAA cham
pion Jennings has been absent from the Cardinal
roster since last year's track season.
But Jennings announced his return loudly this
weekend with a provisional qualifying time of
3:43.65 in the 1,500 meters at Pomona.
Riley led the Cardinal contingent in the 1,500 me
ters at Mt. SAC;, placing fourth with a time 0f3:42.53.
Robison was less than a step behind. Sophomore Don
Sage finished seventh in 3:44.05, and all three run
ners earned provisional qualifying times in the event.
Stanford will benefit greatly from having Riley
and Jennings back on the track, as well as from
having Ponikvar sailing over the high jump bar
once again.
Ponikvar jumped 7 feet, 2.5 inches, a provisional
qualifier, in his first set of jumps of the season.
Also earning a provisional qualifier was junior
Omer Inan, who placed fourth in the discus with a
throw of 190-1.
