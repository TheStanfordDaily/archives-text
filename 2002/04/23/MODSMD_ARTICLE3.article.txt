# Election results challenged
## 
### JOHN HUETTER EDITORIAL STAFF 
The election ain't over until the
ASSU Constitutional Council sings,
says senior Patrick Crosetto.
Crosetto, who says he has "no
relationship to any campaign in
this race" filed, a challenge to the
2002 ASSU Presidential Election
on April 18, the day after the
event, and asked that a runoff
occur within the ASSU Constitu
tion-prescribed time limit of 14
days after the election.
Crosetto wrote in his challenge
that ASSU President/Vice-Presi
dents-elect Monica Henestroza, a
junior and Nick Rodriguez, a
sophomore, won with 2,129 votes.
This number is less than a majori
ty, which would have been 2,303,
by his calculations, of the 4,604
total votes cast in the ASSU gener
al election. According to the ASSU
Constitution, a presidential slate
must win a majority of the votes in
the general election.
About 12 percent of voters es
sentially waived or lost their right
to vote in the instant runoff by not
giving certain slates any ranking
during the general election. The
final instant runoff round used
4,056 votes. Henestroza/Ro
driguez won a majority of votes in
this round but not a majority of all

votes cast in all rounds.
"Without a majority of all votes
cast, the legitimacy of the election
may be called into question,"
Crosetto wrote. "I do not believe
that Henestroza and Rodriguez
want to serve by winning an illegit
imate mandate."
Crosetto asked the ASSU to
order a run-off between Hene
stroza/Rodriguez and second
place slate of juniors Josh Benson
and Kendra Arimoto, and said
otherwise he would have "no
choice but to file a lawsuit in a
Santa Clara County Court asking a
judge to order a run-off ."
If the ASSU ruled in his favor,
the decision would apparently
overturn the victory of the sopho
more class presidential slate too,
since the 495 votes cast in the final
round for slate "Your 4-4-0-5"
(sophomores Alicia Garcia, Ebony
Nyenya, Paul Wilkins, and Zach
Katagiri) out of 1,101 total votes Ls
less than a majority.
The decision would have to be
made by the ASSU Constitutional
Council, which would convene
only upon a petition signed by ei
ther 5 percent of the student
body or five members of the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate or
Graduate Student Council. A mix
of Senators and GSC members is
permitted.

The current ASSU president or
vice-president may also file a writ
ten request for the Council to ex
amine the case. Though Crosetto
said he hoped that either ASSU
President Matt Brewer, a junior, or
Vice-President Christine Cordero,
a senior, would file the request, he
felt lie could easily obtain five per
cent of the student body's signa
tures on a petition.
"1 have no doubt in my mind
that 1 could get the six to seven
hundred votes necessary," Croset
to said.
The last time the Constitutional
Council convened was in April
2000. Currently, there are two
vancancies in tlie committee, and
no chair exists.
"It could be done by the end of
the year," Ng said. "It was difficult
finding people to do it by the end
of last year."
Crosetto said he hoped the
council, even il formed after the
critical 14 clays, would still rule on
the case for the sake of the record.
The ASSU Joint By-Laws state,
"If necessary, the result of the
final election shall constitute the
result of the Presidential runoff
election."
Crosetto argued that by com
bining the runoff with a general

election, the runoff ought to be
bound to the same rules as the
general election and require a ma
jority of all votes cast, including
those for neither of the two candi
dates.
Crosetto also said that the by
laws were unclear about the runoff
procedure, and that one of the pri
mary goals of his campaign was to
streamline the ASSU's governing
documents to make them more
accessible.
He said he was unaffiliated with
any slate, and scoffed at rumors
that he, a self-proclaimed well
known campus Republican
(Crosetto headed the group Stan
ford Students for Bush), would
side with the liberal Benson/Ari
moto slate.
"The idea that I would do this
for someone who started the Stan
ford Progressive!" he exclaimed.
In fact, Crosetto, who ex
plained that he supported due
process, said he would be satisified
if Benson chose not to enter a
runoff and two-thirds of the Sen
ate (as required) voted against hav
ing one, so long as the ASSU's gov
erning documents were corrected.
Benson said he was "leaning
against" a runoff "but in no way is
that a firm decision."

"Depending on the campus re
sponse to a runofF," Benson said,
"I could be convinced to pursue it.
I'd have to talk it over with my
supporters, with the campus, with
Kendra."
However, he stressed he wasn't
"encouraging nor discouraging
Patrick" "I'm simply saying its an
interesting challenge the ASSU
needs to resolve," Benson said. "A
lot of my campaign was based on
reforming the ASSU."
Ng and Crosetto took opposite
sides on the debate on how democ
racy could best be served. Ng said
that the current system "makes it
more convenient for the people
who do care," while Crosetto ar
gued that democracy shouldn't
necessarily be easy.
" Democracy's not about conve
nience â€” not about minimizing
rules, not about making it easier
for the elections commissioner,"
Crosetto said.
Crosetto filed a second, more ex
tensive complaint yesterday, citing
more evidence and providing hy
pothetical examples to back his
point. As of press time, no decision
on the complaint had been reached
by the Elections Commission.
Elections Commissioner
Cedioen Aloula, a junior, said the
commission planned to meet
Wednesday to make a recom
mendation about the election
"and try to make the best decision
that we can."
