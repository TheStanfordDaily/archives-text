### YASI HASHEMI EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Deans' Awards for Academic Ac
complishment were presented last Tuesday
to recognize the achievements of seven stu
dents from a variety of departments.
Steve Graham, the associate dean for
academic affairs in the School of Earth Sci
ences, gave the welcoming remarks and ex
plained the purpose of t he award.
"The Deans' Award for Academic Ac
complishment, now in its 15th year, is given
to extraordinary undergraduates deserv
ing attention from the Stanford communi
ty," Graham said. "Nominations are sub
mitted by faculty and stall members who
work closely with undergraduates in their
academic endeavors.
"Selection of finalists is made by a
committee established by the deans of
the three schools which offer under
graduate degrees: Earth Sciences, Engi
neering and Humanities and Sciences,"
Graham continued.
Former Dean of Undergraduate Stud
ies Tom Wasow, who created the Dean's

awards in 1988, was present, and Graham
stated Wasow's motivation for establish
ing them.
"Students receive recognition at Stan
ford for so many of their accomplishments
in areas such as athletics and service, but,
except for Commencement awards, most
academic achievements are a private mat
ter," Graham said, quoting Wasow. "We
created this new award to celebrate some of
the exceptional scholarly achievements of
our undergraduate students and to bring
them campus-wide recognition."
The award was renamed to the Deans'
(plural possessive) Award to acknowledge
that responsibility for undergraduate edu
cation is now shared among three schools.
Jim Plummer, the dean of engineering,
presented the awards.
Barry Wark, a senior majoring in
Symbolic Systems, was recognized for his
work in Neurobiology Prof. Ben Barres's
laboratory. He studies the role that as
trocytes — a little-studied brain-cell
type — play in the development of
synaptic connections.
Barres said that "Barry's work in the lab
has been characterized by creativity and
technical rigor: his ability to learn challeng
ing skills and apply them would be impres
sive even in an experienced scientist."
I le continued, "Barry is truly exception-
aland is far and away the single
most outstanding undergraduate
1 have ever had in my lab."
French and Italian Prof. Paula
Kindlon presented the award to se
nior Rachel Scarlett-1 rotter to
recognize her work as the prima
ry translator of unstudied and rel
atively unknown texts.
"During my Renaissance Italy
class, 1 discovered that Rachel
was an excellent Latinist," Find
len said. "1 asked her lo work
with me on a short translation of
a 1727 oration on women's edu
cation given by a 9-year-old girl
in Milan.
"Rachel did a great job rough
ing out the initial version, which
we have since edited. This will
appear in a volume about
women's education in 18th-cen
tury Italy to be published by the
University of Chicago Press,"
Findlen continued. "We do not
have many undergraduates who
have ac hieved this level of schol
arly accomplishment before they
even graduate."
Junior Kenny Lin was nomi
nated by Assoc. Prof, of Medicine
John Cooke.
Lin, who is majoring in biolog
ical sciences and history, was hon
ored for achievements in medical
research in Cooke's vascular biol
ogy laboratory.
Lin wrote a paper that was

published in Circulation, the
most prestigious academic jour
nal in cardiovascular medicine.
1 le was also invited to present his
work at the American College of
Cardiology's annual scientific
meeting in March.
Junior Abigail Shaw, a human
biology major, was nominated by
Psychology Prof. Russ Fernald.
Shaw was recognized for her
work in the sciences as well.
In particular, Shaw has focused
on studies of brain peptides.
"It is fair to say that Abby has ac
complished essentially twice as
much as a typical honors research
student might have done," Fernald
said. "She is working on her thesis
and I anticipate that two manu
scripts will come from the work."
Senior Heidi Boas, a major in
feminist studies, was honored for
her research on women's health
care in Kenya and her work as a
teaching assistant. Boas was cho
sen for this position by Consulting
Prof, of Human Biology Anne
Firth Murray, founder of the
Global Fund for Women.
"1 know from reports from
both Anne and from students in
the class that she has done an in
spiring job, going well beyond the
expected responsibilities of a TA
to engage the students in
women's issues and issues of jus
tice more generally," said Lin
guistics Prof. Penelope Eckert,
the director of the Feminist Stud
ies Program.
Stephen Fried, a senior major
ing in history and drama, was

honored for his senior project on
"Habeas Corpus: Meyerhold,
The Final Chapter, 1932-1940."
" The play is a stellar example
of the way research can join cre
ativity to inform tlie best the
ater," said Assoc. Drama Prof.
Rush Rehm.
Drama I'rof. Carl Weber also
praised l'ried's work.
"Steve is the most outstanding
senior we have had in 10 years, if
not more," Weber said. "Steve's
preparation was on level with any
of our Ph.D. candidates."
Junior Theresa Bridgeman,
who is majoring in human biolo
gy, was nominated by Kathleen
Morrison, the associate director
of the Center for Latin Ameri
can Studies. Bridgeman has
studied birth defects and de
vised educational programs to
prevent them in the Mexican
state of Oaxaca.
Bridgeman and her colleague
were invited back to Oaxaca by
the secretary of health there for
more study and implementation.
"The research proceeded as
well as any field project in Latin
America 1 have seen in over 25
years," Morrison said.
Each recipient was presented
with a certificate and a specially
selected book or books with a per
sonalized bookplate. Pho
tographs of the winners and
copies of citations describing their
work will be displayed fora year
in Sweet Hall and on the Under
graduate Research Programs
Web page.
