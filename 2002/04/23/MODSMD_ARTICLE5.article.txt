### MICHELLE KELLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Each year professors around the country
look forward to a small increase in their
salary, but (his year they had a larger reason
to celebrate. According to a report issued by
the American Association of University Pro
fessors, the average salary of professors went
up 3.8 percent nationwide to the highest it
has been in 1 1 years.
"Stanford's salary raises have been fairly
consistent with the national average over the
last few years," said Robert Weisberg, the
special assistant to the provost for faculty.
Weisberg added that the Provost's Office
has worked to allocate a flexible portion of
the budget to ensure salary increases even in
economic downturns.
At Stanford, the average salary last year
fora full professor was $100,600 in the first

10 or so years after becoming a full profes
sor. Full professors employed by the Uni
versity for more than 20 years earned an av
erage of $127,400.
These figures are calculated by averaging
salaries across departments available in a
yearly report issued by the Provost's ()ffice.
In contrast, professors at public universi
ties that attract mostly regional students
made an average of $40,000 or less per year.
Despite increases, faculty salaries at
Stanford have not adequately reflec ted the
high costs of living in Palo Alto and sur
rounding areas, particularly the exorbitant
housing costs.
"There was a dramatic increase in stan
dard of living costs starting in 190 Sand
there hasn't been a significant salary change
that has accommodated this change," said
