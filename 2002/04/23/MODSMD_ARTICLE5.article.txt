# Professors' salaries increase
## 
### MICHELLE KELLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Each year professors around the country
look forward to a small increase in their
salary, but (his year they had a larger reason
to celebrate. According to a report issued by
the American Association of University Pro
fessors, the average salary of professors went
up 3.8 percent nationwide to the highest it
has been in 1 1 years.
"Stanford's salary raises have been fairly
consistent with the national average over the
last few years," said Robert Weisberg, the
special assistant to the provost for faculty.
Weisberg added that the Provost's Office
has worked to allocate a flexible portion of
the budget to ensure salary increases even in
economic downturns.
At Stanford, the average salary last year
fora full professor was $100,600 in the first

10 or so years after becoming a full profes
sor. Full professors employed by the Uni
versity for more than 20 years earned an av
erage of $127,400.
These figures are calculated by averaging
salaries across departments available in a
yearly report issued by the Provost's ()ffice.
In contrast, professors at public universi
ties that attract mostly regional students
made an average of $40,000 or less per year.
Despite increases, faculty salaries at
Stanford have not adequately reflec ted the
high costs of living in Palo Alto and sur
rounding areas, particularly the exorbitant
housing costs.
"There was a dramatic increase in stan
dard of living costs starting in 190 Sand
there hasn't been a significant salary change
that has accommodated this change," said
Steve Tadelis an, assistant profes
sor of economics.
The University is well aware of
this problem and has implemented
certain programs to aid with hous
ing costs.
"Vou can't substantially solve the
housing problem through salary,"
Weisberg said. "Salary itself would
not be enough for recruitment and
retention of faculty. Instead, the
University has focused on low-in
terest loans, extra-housing supple
ments, and equity sharing."
The salaries of Stanford pro

lessors vary widely across depart
ments, with some professors earn
ing $ 150,000 or more, depending
on their length of employment at
the University and their depart
ment. In general, professors in
the schools of engineering and
natural sciences earned more at
the top levels.
Salaries for full professors in the
schools of law, business and medi
cine were up to two or three times
the amount of the average salary for
lull professors employed by the
schools of Humanities and Sciences
and Engineering. This reflects the
different levels of competition that
graduate schools face against the
job market.
In the United States, doctors

make* about 70 percent more,
lawyers earn 50 percent more and
engineers earn 30 percent more
than lull-time professors in simi
lar fields.
"When people make a choice to
become faculty at Stanlord they are
quite aware that other jobs will pay
more," Tadelis said. "I choose to be
an academic because it is what I
love to do."
"I have basically chosen a pro
fession in academia that makes 60
to 70 percent less than what I
would be making in Wall Street,
but 1 see the rewards of working
with a top group of talented and
brilliant scholars and colleagues as
worth much more than money,"
he continued.
