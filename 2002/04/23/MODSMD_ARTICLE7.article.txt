To many he is a friend, an advisor, an
instructor and a spiritual guide.
What stin ted six years ago as a unique
era in Stanford's history will come to an
end this summer as Assoc. Dean for Reli
gious Life Rev. Maurice diaries prepares
to leave Stanford to pursue a doctorate at
the University of Chicago Divinity
School.
A priest of the Episcopal Church,
(lharles has been an associate dean for re
ligious life since July of 1990.
In the past six years, Charles has per
formed 200 weddings, 100 baptisms, 70
sermons, 00 funerals, two protests, two
television appearances, one same-sex
union and preached to former President
Pill Clinton.
"These are very high numbers fora
clergyperson," Charles said. "The nature
of being a chaplain to [thousands of| stu
dents makes the ordinary duties high."

Aside from his usual duties he lias
helped countless individuals overcome
adversity while offering the Stanford
community with the best of his abilities.
He has worked with the Black Communi
ty Services Center, the Disability Re
sources Center and has served as the
AIDS/HIV liaison in the Office for Reli
gious Life.
He has also been involved with 20 in
terfaith services, like the one in the Main
Quad following Sept. 1 1.
"I've had to think about how I en
gage other religions," Charles said. "For
me, being Christian means allowing
others space to pray in my presence and
me in theirs."
"I'm really sad to lose him," Rev. Scot
ty McLennan, the dean for religious life,
said. "He has been a terrific colleague."
"Maurice's understanding of liturgy,
of ritual and of the priesthood has en
riched the Stanford community and my
own understanding of Christianity im
measurably." said Assoc. Dean for Reli

gious Lite Rabbi Patricia Karlin-Neu
manw. "I look forward to his continued
contributions to the intersection of reli
gion and intellectual life."
Charles initially came to the Bay Area
to complete studies necessary for being
ordained.
"While here, someone at the Kpisco
pal Seminary in Berkeley told me that
there was an opening at Stanford,"
Charles said. "When I came here for an
interview, I was even more impressed
with the (|u;ility of students. . . there
were extremely intelligent students in
the search committee."
"Someone encouraged me to talk to
Boh Gregg," Charles said. "I was s< n
pressed by him both as a scholar and a
priest."
I lie search process led to Charles
being hired by Gregg, a professor in reli
gious studies.
"We met and talked . . . he impressed
all as a solid person who could
make a great contribution,"
Gregg said. "We are lucky to have
had him here as a colleague and
as a friend."
Charles will be leaving Stanford
this summer for Chicago. His doc
toral work in Christian theology
will probe religion and violence.
"My primary field [will be] the

ology . . . the history of Christian
ideas [and] why and how certain
theological tenets support the use
of violence," Charles said.
"What he's going to be doing is
something he's got a lot of passion
about," said Rev. Joanne Sanders,
an assistant dean for religious life.
"I think really where I see
[Charles]. . . he really wants to
teach and write."
"My work with students has
[fostered] my interest in religion
and violence," Charles said. "Sept.
11 confirmed that this was an area

worth pursuing."
"My hope is that he will be a na
tionally recognized scholar, to help
utilize nonviolence both as a
method and as a way of life,"
McLennan said.
Charles' career path falls along
those of other great historical 112 ig
ures like Martin Luther King Jr., a
man he admires greatly.
"[King] deliberately focused his
academic studies to address a so
cial ill," Charles said. "I Ie did all of
his thinking, his research, before
becoming part of the movement."

Charles's departure will leave a
vacancy in the office.
"We want to move ahead with a
search to find an associate dean for
religious life," McLennan said.
"If the opportunity ever
opened up for me I 'd come back to
Stanford in a heartbeat.. . this is a
great place," Charles said.
"I think he'd be a really strong
scholar coming back," McLennan
added.
There will be a farewell Eu
charist ai Memorial Church on
Sunday, June 2 at 10:00 a.m.
