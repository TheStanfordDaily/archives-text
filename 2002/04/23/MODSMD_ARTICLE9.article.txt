# Campus libraries house many treasures

### ANNA GALAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Throw away your notions of a library filled
with musty books and journals. Stanford's li
braries hold some unique historical treasures
yet to be discovered by most students.
This includes notes rumored to be written
by Leland Stanford Jr. from the grave, X-rays
of Hitler's head taken after an assassination
attempt, the first printing of Karl Marx's
Communist Manifesto and the order to bomb
Hiroshima listing types of bombs for the mis
sion as "Special."
For those willing to take the time to seek
such original resources, the results are re
warding. Both Green Library and the Hoover
Institution have extensive collections repre
senting important political events and items
important to Stanford's history.
"I have been working at the Hoover Insti
tution for over 20 years, and 1 still discover
something new each day," said Elena Daniel
son, director of the Hoover Library and
Archives.
With over one million books and 60 million
documents, the Hoover Institution's collec
tion fills all of Hoover Tower.
Founded in 1919 by Herbert Hoover, the
institution is known for having a wide-rang
ing collection of war and propaganda posters,
as well as other politically relevant docu
ments, film footage and photographs.
Danielson said that the library has many
one-of-a-kind items, and that the collection
has grown so much that the institution is now
specializing in unique materials.
There are early diaries of Heinrich Himm
ler, the chief of the Nazi secret police. Origi

nal letters from Lenin. The only known copy
of Fidel Castro's biography. Abdication pa
pers of Czar Nicolas II of Russia. Gestapo ar
rest lists with British residents Virginia Woolf,
Sigmund Freud, Neville Chamberlain and
Winston Churchill as targets.
The archives at Green have a slightly less
political angle, yet still offer a rich history, es
pecially in items related to the University.
The scribbled "notes" from Leland Stan
ford Jr. are included in the archives, and are
part of a larger exhibit on apports, or items
that appear in seances.
Thomas Welton Stanford, Leland Stan
ford Jr.'s younger brother, was especially in
terested in psychic phenomena, and the ap
ports were part of his collection, which fea
tures several "notes from the dead" written
on blank slates normally used in classrooms at
the time.
Margaret Kimball, the university archivist,
explained that the unusual items there are
often a part of someone's collection that the
University acquires.
The collection at Green also includes death
masks taken after the deaths of the entire
Stanford family. Using plaster to capture a
family member's face after their death was a
common Victorian tradition.
With the library consistently acquiring new
items, Kimball said that one of the biggest
challenges of the job was keeping up with col
lecting.
The deep red scarf waved around at the
first Big Game that inspired Stanford's choice
of cardinal red as the school color is proudly
displayed in Kimball's office.
While many of these archives may seem
haphazard, the variety of primary sources

available at the libraries has proved to be an
essential tool for some class work.
Ann Walters, a lecturer in the Program in
Writing and Rhetoric, used the library's vari
ous archives as an aspect of her Writing 2
class.
Last quarter, Watters's class helped pre
pare an exhibit on mass movements in histo
ry for the institution entitled "True Believers"
using items from philosopher Eric Hoffer's
collection, as well as Middle East, New Left,
Radical Right, Poster and Communism Col
lections.
"1 like to give students, as early as first year,
an opportunity to experience the excitement
of hands-on research with primary source
materials," Walters said. "'They connect very
directly with the archival documents and can
experience some of the excitement of re
search early in their academic careers."
Walters said students who hold an original
letter from Gandhi in their hands, or examine
a diary of an imprisoned Bolshevik with "in
visible writing" in the margins or the "terror
ist handbook" that just arrived after Sept. 11,
will have had an academic and personal ex
perience that brings history and research
alive and that transcends their expectations
fora first-year required course such as
IHUM.
While searching out these unique re
sources may seem daunting for some, librari
ans encouraged students to take advantage of
the opportunities.
"Stanford students are my top priority,
and I want to help them," Danielson said.
"Any student who asks for help gets it.
There's a certain mystique about the Hoover
Institution, but we're user-friendly."
