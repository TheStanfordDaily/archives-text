Europe: Winter Quarter 2002-2003
In the quarter that will change your life,
these are the four days that
will matter the most...
The second annual
Stanford World War II Project.
Take a class on World War II at a European center.
Go to Berlin with your classmates.
Cap off your class at a
four-day workshop with faculty.
We pick up your costs.
Same Stanford education.
Same cost as staying on The Farm (plus plane ticket).
Same financial aid.
But you'll never be the same again.
