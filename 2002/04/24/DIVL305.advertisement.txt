Forests
The Shadow
of Civilization
Prof. Robert Harrison
Department of French and Italian
Professor Harrison, author of a book by the same title, will speak
about the role of forests in our collective cultural imagination. Me
traces the mythology and literature of forests from antiquity through
modernity, showing that we depend on forests for both body and spir
it. He frames this pressing environmental issue in the seldom-dis
cussed terms of humanities. While science gives the how, humanities
give the why. Come hear a fresh perspective!

as majestic, and open, and delightful" -Bill McKibben, author of The
End of Nature
