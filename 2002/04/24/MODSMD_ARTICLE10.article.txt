# RUNNING ON EMPTY
## Job-hunt heartbreak 
### 
To my prospective employer:
We need to talk. In the begin
ning it all seemed so perfect.
You were looking for someone
just like me — at least, that's what your
advertisement said. I was everything you
could ask for — young, energetic and
without even a base salary requirement.
What's more, I wanted you so badly
that I put my better judgment aside. In
those crazy first days I was willing to be
anything you wanted, to do anything you
asked. Relocate? Sure. Familiarity with
Microsoft Office? I'll make it happen.
In a carefully worded resume I tried
to make myself into the image of the girl
I thought you wanted to hire. I see now
what, a fool I was.
And then — oh, how it hurts to think
about it! — I poured my soul into a cover

letter. Don't act like yon
don't remember it. I
confessed to yon my at
traction to your recog
nized involvement in the
community. 1 flattered
your title of 1999
Besthesda Corporate
Citizen of the Year. And 1
asked you to please con-

tact me at your earliest convenience fora
personal interview, naively believing that
you would.
I knew something was wrong when
a week went by without even the slight
est acknowledgment that you received
my letter and resume. At first I tried to
tell myself that this was normal.
You're a big busy company. I can't ex
pect too much of your time. You were
probably just waiting fora break in your
schedule so that we could sit down to
gether and have some quality time fora
phone interview.
When I couldn't wait any longer 1 sent
you an e-mail. I tried not to sound needy.
All I wanted to know was that my resume
hadn't been lost in the mail and when
would be a gcxxl time for me to call you and
discuss it. I just wanted you to reassure me
that I still meant something to you.
And what do I get two days later? A
cold, impersonal note from some human
resources snob stating that my informa
tion has been forwarded to the appropri
ate personnel and if there is interest 1 will
be contacted. You couldn't even tell me
yourself, could you? You had some lIR
wench do your dirty work. Typical.
You promised me the world, didn't
you? I he opportunity to build a profes
sional portfolio. Insurance benefits. A
convenient location next to the Metro. 1
see those now for what they really are:
empty promises and lies.
I should have seen the patterns from
the beginning. You don't call. You don't
write. Every five to seven business days I
pick up the phone or sit down at my com

puter with all my rational, self-protective
instincts screaming, "No! Don't do it!"
But again and again I contact you,
tossing out desperate reminders that I
can be reached by phone from 1 p.m. to
5 p.m., your time, or that I've been read
ing your publication and found it quite
interesting. Can we be honest, for once?
It sucks, actually. It's the dullest thing
I've ever read. God, that felt good.
I thought that's what you were look
ing for. I thought if I could prove how
much I wanted this you would take me
seriously and we could begin something
permanent, something meaningful,
something full-time. You were never
ready to commit . In my heart I knew that
but still I kept at it, leaving messages with
your secretary, playing your sick games.
I see it now. I'm not special to you.
You have hundreds, maybe thousands
of young things just like me lined up at
your door, resumes in hand, ready to
fluff up your ego and send and dis
tribute faxes at your whim. You proba
bly can't even pronounce my name. Dis
gusting.
Everyone tells me there will be other
offers, other companies. And I know
they're right. But there will never be an
other one like you. You were the one I
wanted. I saw our whole future together
— the hip office downtown, the 401(k),
the company Christmas party where
we'd all drink too much. And you threw
that dream away like yesterday's memos.
I'm through with you. There are
other employers in the Career Develop
ment Center database, you know. I may
be hurt today, but I will send out my re
sume tomorrow and the next day and
the next until I find a company that
wants me for who I am. 1 will survive. I
will be hired. You'll see.
But if something opens up — call
me?
