Critic of ethnic organizations overlooks
inclusiveness or community events
1 write in regard to Michael Massey's let
ter to The Daily addressing "the leaders of
the Asian American Students Association,
and to all ethnic and cultural organizations
on campus" ("Junior responds to special
fee endorsements," 4/22/01). While I ap
preciate his attempts to constructively crit
icize, I find his remarks to be uninformed.
For whatever it's worth, I want to first
state that I am white. Perhaps because of
my brand of politics, perhaps because of
my social network, or perhaps out of
sheer coincidence, I have had the won
derful opportunity to participate in the
rich culture and community fostered by
ethnic organizations.
1 find no fault in the fact that "most eth
nic- or religious-themed organizations
stated in their special fees request that the
funds would be used for programming for
members of their specific ethnic or cultur
al group on campus." Such ethnic and re
ligious-themed groups are set up and
funded for just that purpose.
Furthermore, Massey challenges these
campus groups to "resist the current trend
of turning inward." However, I have seen
no such trend. I question whether Massey
has been paying much attention to the
happenings around campus, because
these organizations put on a plethora of
events open to the entire community.
All you have to do is look at one of the
many boards plastered with flyers to learn
of the next event being put on. And com
munity groups use every outlet available
to publicize these events. For example, as
Massey specifically points out, AASA flyers
indiscriminately and posts e-mail an
nouncements on Resident Assistant lists,
among other creative avenues of publicity.
Massey seems to imply that AASA's core
members specifically advertise to Asian
Americans, while keeping events a secret
from the rest of Stanford. From my expe
rience, they more than welcome a diverse
audience. II Massey ventured out to some
of these events, he would see that these
events actually do draw "outsiders."
For example, AASA's Extravaganza
drew active, coordinated participation
from the Black Student Union, MEChA,
the Stanford American Indian Organiza
tion, the Muslim Students Awareness Net
work, and the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People. The
Latino and the black communities have
also collaborated on several events this
past year. I simply do not understand
where Massey gets his perception that eth
nic organizations are continuing a "c ur
rent trend of turning inwards".
If by "outsiders," Massey is referring to
white people, then I have to admit he is
right. Despite being part of the white com
munity that makes up approximately half
of the undergraduate population, I find it
pathetic that I am often part of the small
est minority at ethnic community events.
However, instead of taking Massey's
approach of criticizing these community

groups, I encourage the general Stan
ford population to take Massey's letter as
a wakeup call to examine their own as
sumptions of these communities.
Inclusion works from two ends, not
one. From my experience as a white stu
dent that actually participates in commu
nities of color, I only see one end making
the effort. I encourage Massey and others
to let go of their assumptions and break
out of their own insularity and join me in
the next community event.

Music Dept, not SCN, primary provider of
live music on campus

Alex Bleyleben's Friday article ("Be
yond Adrian Perry") opened with a mis
statement of fact. While the Stanford Con
cert Network may be the only student-run
booker of off-campus bands, it is by no
means the "campus's primary provider of
live music."
That claim would rightly be applied to
the Department of Music—with over
150 concerts and recitals by faculty, stu
dents and guest artists, we present a far
greater number of events, featuring
guests such as Jon Nakamatsu, Louie
Bellson, Nicolle Foland and our own St.
Lawrence String Quartet.
While you won't see many bare midriffs
or stacks of amps on our stages, you will
hear talented musicians, some with world
wide reputations, playing not just "the
classics," but a wide range of new reper
toire that pushes the musical envelope.
Most of our music happens because stu
dents care about, study, rehearse and per
form this music for the benefit of the Stan

Focus on Sharon's war crimes unwarranted
Regarding campus visitor Laurie King-
Irani's speech yesterday on "The Case
Against Ariel Sharon," I wholly support
Belgium's efforts to bring war criminals to
justice and the efforts of those Stanford
groups to make our community aware of
wartime tragedies.
Over the past 10 years, respect for rule
of law — especially the laws of armed con
flict — lias increasingly been the bench
mark for participation in the international
community. Stanford Law School students
should applaud attempts to strengthen the
role of law in global politics.
Yet Belgium's selective enforcement of
laws of war grossly undermines this
emerging legal regime. Arafat has as much
blood on his hands as Sharon — and more
directly so — in light of his recent links
with terrorism.
Yet there are no calls in Europe nor
from tonight's sponsoring groups to pros
ecute him for murdering civilians. Similar

ly, no one has yet brought French leaders
to justice for failing to act while France's
proxy army slaughtered 900,000 Tutsis in
Rwanda. Or Iran and Iraq, for that matter,
which have adopted terror against Israeli
and American civilians as a national strate
gy — a frightening and sustained violation
of the laws of armed conflict. If nonfea
sance in war is a crime, then surely there
are others worthy of judicial proceedings
besides Sharon.
Focusing on Sharon during this deli
cate time makes international law look like
a political tool, rather than a defining prin
ciple for global politics. Worse, it stinks of
a double standard that corroborates Is
rael's charges of Anti-Semitism. To attend
this event is to protest against Israel, not
contribute to global justice and stability.

Election runoff would diminish student voice
Don't let formalities of "democracy"
drown out true student voice.
While 1 applaud Pat Crosetto for at
tempting to keep the ASSU election policy
honest, 1 am afraid that his efforts at pro
moting the mechanics of democracy may
well undermine the whole point of cam
pus democracy: student voice.
It is unfortunate that Monica Hene
stroza and Nick Rodriguez did not receive
a majority of the 4,604 votes cast for the
first round of the election. A runoff elec
tion might "legitimize" the results, but it
certainly wouldn't increase the student
voice in the matter.
I find it hard to believe that nearly as
many students would turn out to vote in a
runoff election, without any other issues
on the ballot, well after the ASSU election
hype is over. Henestroza and Rodriguez
did, after all, receive a majority of the
4,056 votes remaining in the final round.
Would it be a real "victory for democracy"
if either slate then won a runoff election in
which probably 50 percent fewer people
would participate?
Imagine, for the sake of argument, that
in the runoff, Josh Benson and Kendra
Arimoto won, with 1,000 votes to 900.
I'his victory would clearly comply with
the letter of the law — but the spirit of stu
dent voice, and the 2,129 votes that even
tually were awarded to Henestroza/Ro
driguez, would have been ignored.
This is of course an unlikely scenario;
however, I believe it illustrates the point
that while a runoff will make the election re
sults comply with the rules of democracy, it
may substitute a much more broadly-based
student voice with a very narrow one.
While Crosetto's idealism is refreshing
on this campus, I can see no way that his
actions will, taking into account the reali
ties of campus life, benefit the spirit of
democracy and representation.

Imagine, for the sake of argument, that
in the runoff, Josh Benson and Kendra

I'his victory would clearly comply with

Critic of ethnic organizations overlooks
inclusiveness or community events
1 write in regard to Michael Massey's let
ter to The Daily addressing "the leaders of
the Asian American Students Association,
and to all ethnic and cultural organizations
on campus" ("Junior responds to special
fee endorsements," 4/22/01). While I ap
preciate his attempts to constructively crit
icize, I find his remarks to be uninformed.
For whatever it's worth, I want to first
state that I am white. Perhaps because of
my brand of politics, perhaps because of
my social network, or perhaps out of
sheer coincidence, I have had the won
derful opportunity to participate in the
rich culture and community fostered by
ethnic organizations.
1 find no fault in the fact that "most eth
nic- or religious-themed organizations
stated in their special fees request that the
funds would be used for programming for
members of their specific ethnic or cultur
al group on campus." Such ethnic and re
ligious-themed groups are set up and
funded for just that purpose.
Furthermore, Massey challenges these
campus groups to "resist the current trend
of turning inward." However, I have seen
no such trend. I question whether Massey
has been paying much attention to the
happenings around campus, because
these organizations put on a plethora of
events open to the entire community.
All you have to do is look at one of the
many boards plastered with flyers to learn
of the next event being put on. And com
munity groups use every outlet available
to publicize these events. For example, as
Massey specifically points out, AASA flyers
indiscriminately and posts e-mail an
nouncements on Resident Assistant lists,
among other creative avenues of publicity.
Massey seems to imply that AASA's core
members specifically advertise to Asian
Americans, while keeping events a secret
from the rest of Stanford. From my expe
rience, they more than welcome a diverse
audience. II Massey ventured out to some
of these events, he would see that these
events actually do draw "outsiders."
For example, AASA's Extravaganza
drew active, coordinated participation
from the Black Student Union, MEChA,
the Stanford American Indian Organiza
tion, the Muslim Students Awareness Net
work, and the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People. The
Latino and the black communities have
also collaborated on several events this
past year. I simply do not understand
where Massey gets his perception that eth
nic organizations are continuing a "c ur
rent trend of turning inwards".
If by "outsiders," Massey is referring to
white people, then I have to admit he is
right. Despite being part of the white com
munity that makes up approximately half
of the undergraduate population, I find it
pathetic that I am often part of the small
est minority at ethnic community events.
However, instead of taking Massey's
approach of criticizing these community

groups, I encourage the general Stan
ford population to take Massey's letter as
a wakeup call to examine their own as
sumptions of these communities.
Inclusion works from two ends, not
one. From my experience as a white stu
dent that actually participates in commu
nities of color, I only see one end making
the effort. I encourage Massey and others
to let go of their assumptions and break
out of their own insularity and join me in
the next community event.

Music Dept, not SCN, primary provider of
live music on campus

Alex Bleyleben's Friday article ("Be
yond Adrian Perry") opened with a mis
statement of fact. While the Stanford Con
cert Network may be the only student-run
booker of off-campus bands, it is by no
means the "campus's primary provider of
live music."
That claim would rightly be applied to
the Department of Music—with over
150 concerts and recitals by faculty, stu
dents and guest artists, we present a far
greater number of events, featuring
guests such as Jon Nakamatsu, Louie
Bellson, Nicolle Foland and our own St.
Lawrence String Quartet.
While you won't see many bare midriffs
or stacks of amps on our stages, you will
hear talented musicians, some with world
wide reputations, playing not just "the
classics," but a wide range of new reper
toire that pushes the musical envelope.
Most of our music happens because stu
dents care about, study, rehearse and per
form this music for the benefit of the Stan
ford community.

Focus on Sharon's war crimes unwarranted
Regarding campus visitor Laurie King-
Irani's speech yesterday on "The Case
Against Ariel Sharon," I wholly support
Belgium's efforts to bring war criminals to
justice and the efforts of those Stanford
groups to make our community aware of
wartime tragedies.
Over the past 10 years, respect for rule
of law — especially the laws of armed con
flict — lias increasingly been the bench
mark for participation in the international
community. Stanford Law School students
should applaud attempts to strengthen the
role of law in global politics.
Yet Belgium's selective enforcement of
laws of war grossly undermines this
emerging legal regime. Arafat has as much
blood on his hands as Sharon — and more
directly so — in light of his recent links
with terrorism.
Yet there are no calls in Europe nor
from tonight's sponsoring groups to pros
ecute him for murdering civilians. Similar

ly, no one has yet brought French leaders
to justice for failing to act while France's
proxy army slaughtered 900,000 Tutsis in
Rwanda. Or Iran and Iraq, for that matter,
which have adopted terror against Israeli
and American civilians as a national strate
gy — a frightening and sustained violation
of the laws of armed conflict. If nonfea
sance in war is a crime, then surely there
are others worthy of judicial proceedings
besides Sharon.
Focusing on Sharon during this deli
cate time makes international law look like
a political tool, rather than a defining prin
ciple for global politics. Worse, it stinks of
a double standard that corroborates Is
rael's charges of Anti-Semitism. To attend
this event is to protest against Israel, not
contribute to global justice and stability.

Election runoff would diminish student voice
Don't let formalities of "democracy"
drown out true student voice.
While 1 applaud Pat Crosetto for at
tempting to keep the ASSU election policy
honest, 1 am afraid that his efforts at pro
moting the mechanics of democracy may
well undermine the whole point of cam
pus democracy: student voice.
It is unfortunate that Monica Hene
stroza and Nick Rodriguez did not receive
a majority of the 4,604 votes cast for the
first round of the election. A runoff elec
tion might "legitimize" the results, but it
certainly wouldn't increase the student
voice in the matter.
I find it hard to believe that nearly as
many students would turn out to vote in a
runoff election, without any other issues
on the ballot, well after the ASSU election
hype is over. Henestroza and Rodriguez
did, after all, receive a majority of the
4,056 votes remaining in the final round.
Would it be a real "victory for democracy"
if either slate then won a runoff election in
which probably 50 percent fewer people
