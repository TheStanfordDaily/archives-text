# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Collective memory of ‘Forgotten Genocide' must be restored 
### CHRIS GUZELIAN GUEST COLUMNIST 
I oday is Armenian Genocide Remem
brance Day. On this date in 1915, 300
prominent Armenians in Constantinople
were arrested. Most were later executed.
The same day, 5,000 other Constantino
ple Armenians were dragged from their
humble homes and slayed in the streets.
This was the beginning of Ottoman
Turkey's "relocation" of its minority Ar
menian population. Historians say the
"relocation" was among the most atro
cious genocides ever perpetrated, extin
guishing some 1.5 million lives. But
Turkey and the American administration
are not historians; neither officially ad
mits, and Turkey vociferously disputes,
the Forgotten Genocide's occurrence.
This amnesia is not universal; a do/en
nations' parliaments and the Vatican City
have formally recognized this genocide.
This month, over 160 U.S. congressmen
have signed a petition to President
George W. Bush, imploring him to ac
knowledge the Armenian Genocide.

Let's observe one small event in the
1915 Ottoman "relocation." This story re
tinites a nice Armenian surname —
"Gibilian," perhaps? And, of course, we
need to give narrative life to the Gibilians.
Meet a peaceful farmer, Mike Gibilian.
Mik,e works his plots in Eastern Turkey
from aurora until vespers, until boils
plague his back, until splintered plow
grips bloody his hands.
Meet Mike's dear wife, Dorothy. Yes
terday she brought her two infant boys to
her parents' home. On this May morning,
Dorothy rises to prepare the day's meals.
She turns an eye to her children's crib,
then to the beds of her slumbering par
ents and younger sisters.
Suddenly the latched door shatters
open under a rifle butt's crude assault.
Hitched to a weathered vegetable cart
outside, the family's sagging burro brays
frantically in ancient gutturals. Four
looming gendarmes enter, another tar
ries nonchalantly to strike a cigarette.
Dorothy's infants howl, but now slivers of
angry bayonet steel glint in morning's
struggling light. Dorothy's children will

wail no more.
The family is told they must relocate to
the south. Now the storm troopers depart
to raze unsuspecting neighbors with the
same crimson blades. Dorothy flings her
self headfirst onto her lifeless babes' blood
spattered crib, but her sobs are too tardy a
prayer to make deaf deities mourn.
Mike and Dorothy Gibilian were my
grandmother's parents. They each sur
vived 1915, a death march and six years of
uncertain separation. But in the course of
mere months, 1.5 million Armenians
were no more.
'They lay, nameless dead on nameless
Anatolian roadways, in their homes,
even nailed to the doors of their church
es. Trudging skeletons were herded by
gendarmes and mercenary rabble into
the searing netherworld of the Syrian
Desert. Armenians collapsed in corpse
mounds along spiny, salt-dowsed boule
vards of oblivion.
Now a gendarme lashes Dorothy's sis
ter. A current of unseeing Armenians
stammer past, fixed only on the inane
brevity of their own futures. The tattered

waif falls into a ditch. She convulses into
unconsciousness, perhaps the best respite
from her attacker. She dies.
Her elderly parents plod on, certain to
be shot if they glance rearward to their ef
faced Kurydice. Dorothy's mother, days
without drink, expires a few miles further
along. Dorothy's father crumbles in eter
nity's clench soon after. I heir sun-bloated
bodies are the nocturnal comestibles of
the slobbering desert jackal.
The Armenian Genocide's memory
turns 87 today. 1 lei truth is now an anxious
taper — a wannish flicker threatened by
time's gallows. Dorothy and Mike are dead.
Their hearsay witness, my grandmother, is
dead. With time, all survivors will die. With
time, so too will we. Life is but a brief and or
dinary vapor, but our collective breath can
construct the eternal and extraordinary.
It is time for Turkey to assume its
rightful place as the Armenian Geno
cide's most resolute denouncer. My
Turkish friends, have the fortitude to
recognize this genocide. Your declara
tion will prove only your benevolence.
My Armenian and many other friends,

accept our Turkish friends' acknowl
edgement without contempt or contin
gency. Their confirmation reveals only a
people gallant enough to conquer their
ancestors' fallibility.
Adolf Hitler justified the Holocaust's
political viability by saying, "After all, who
today remembers the slaughter of the Ar
menians?" We are a better humanity than
to allow madmen to use truth's obscurity
to such ends. My optimism does not falter.
This year, we shall signal that our mu
tual respect of life surmounts fictional di
vides of sovereign Hags, of religions, of
cultures. We shall embrace the 1.5 million
who died in so unkind a loneliness. And in
doing so, Armenians and lurks shall
enter again into a bonded friendship that
might pierce with its exemplary grace this
blackened age of hardened hearts.

I oday is Armenian Genocide Remem
brance Day. On this date in 1915, 300
prominent Armenians in Constantinople
were arrested. Most were later executed.
The same day, 5,000 other Constantino
ple Armenians were dragged from their
humble homes and slayed in the streets.
This was the beginning of Ottoman
Turkey's "relocation" of its minority Ar
menian population. Historians say the
"relocation" was among the most atro
cious genocides ever perpetrated, extin
guishing some 1.5 million lives. But
Turkey and the American administration
are not historians; neither officially ad
mits, and Turkey vociferously disputes,
the Forgotten Genocide's occurrence.
This amnesia is not universal; a do/en
nations' parliaments and the Vatican City
have formally recognized this genocide.
This month, over 160 U.S. congressmen
have signed a petition to President
George W. Bush, imploring him to ac
knowledge the Armenian Genocide.

Let's observe one small event in the
1915 Ottoman "relocation." This story re
tinites a nice Armenian surname —
"Gibilian," perhaps? And, of course, we
need to give narrative life to the Gibilians.
Meet a peaceful farmer, Mike Gibilian.
Mik,e works his plots in Eastern Turkey
from aurora until vespers, until boils
plague his back, until splintered plow
grips bloody his hands.
Meet Mike's dear wife, Dorothy. Yes
terday she brought her two infant boys to
her parents' home. On this May morning,
Dorothy rises to prepare the day's meals.
She turns an eye to her children's crib,
then to the beds of her slumbering par
ents and younger sisters.
Suddenly the latched door shatters
open under a rifle butt's crude assault.
Hitched to a weathered vegetable cart
outside, the family's sagging burro brays
frantically in ancient gutturals. Four
looming gendarmes enter, another tar
ries nonchalantly to strike a cigarette.
Dorothy's infants howl, but now slivers of
angry bayonet steel glint in morning's
struggling light. Dorothy's children will

wail no more.
The family is told they must relocate to
the south. Now the storm troopers depart
to raze unsuspecting neighbors with the
same crimson blades. Dorothy flings her
self headfirst onto her lifeless babes' blood
spattered crib, but her sobs are too tardy a
prayer to make deaf deities mourn.
Mike and Dorothy Gibilian were my
grandmother's parents. They each sur
vived 1915, a death march and six years of
uncertain separation. But in the course of
mere months, 1.5 million Armenians
were no more.
'They lay, nameless dead on nameless
Anatolian roadways, in their homes,
even nailed to the doors of their church
es. Trudging skeletons were herded by
gendarmes and mercenary rabble into
the searing netherworld of the Syrian
Desert. Armenians collapsed in corpse
mounds along spiny, salt-dowsed boule
vards of oblivion.
Now a gendarme lashes Dorothy's sis
ter. A current of unseeing Armenians
stammer past, fixed only on the inane
brevity of their own futures. The tattered

waif falls into a ditch. She convulses into
unconsciousness, perhaps the best respite
from her attacker. She dies.
Her elderly parents plod on, certain to
be shot if they glance rearward to their ef
faced Kurydice. Dorothy's mother, days
without drink, expires a few miles further
along. Dorothy's father crumbles in eter
nity's clench soon after. I heir sun-bloated
bodies are the nocturnal comestibles of
the slobbering desert jackal.
The Armenian Genocide's memory
turns 87 today. 1 lei truth is now an anxious
taper — a wannish flicker threatened by
time's gallows. Dorothy and Mike are dead.
Their hearsay witness, my grandmother, is
dead. With time, all survivors will die. With
time, so too will we. Life is but a brief and or
dinary vapor, but our collective breath can
construct the eternal and extraordinary.
It is time for Turkey to assume its
rightful place as the Armenian Geno
cide's most resolute denouncer. My
Turkish friends, have the fortitude to
recognize this genocide. Your declara
tion will prove only your benevolence.
My Armenian and many other friends,

accept our Turkish friends' acknowl
edgement without contempt or contin
gency. Their confirmation reveals only a
people gallant enough to conquer their
ancestors' fallibility.
Adolf Hitler justified the Holocaust's
political viability by saying, "After all, who
today remembers the slaughter of the Ar
menians?" We are a better humanity than
to allow madmen to use truth's obscurity
to such ends. My optimism does not falter.
This year, we shall signal that our mu
tual respect of life surmounts fictional di

cultures. We shall embrace the 1.5 million
who died in so unkind a loneliness. And in
doing so, Armenians and lurks shall
