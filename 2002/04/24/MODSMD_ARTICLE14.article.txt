Cardinal.

not want to overlook Sacramento
State, which snapped its eight-game
losing streak against Stanford with last
year's win.
"It was disappointing to lose the two in
Washington last weekend," said sopho
more reliever David O'Hagan. "But
we've just got to beat Sacramento State,
get some momentum, and start making
that run at the Pac-10 title."

tonight against a struggling Hornets
team that lias lost three straight games
and 13 of its last 15.
Junior designated hitter Jason Cooper
still paces the Cardinal in all three of the
Triple Crown categories with a .385 hat
ting average, 10 home runs, and 39 RBI,
while centerfielder Sam Fuld has had a
brilliant sophomore campaign, currently
holding the team lead in hits with 57.
In tonight's game, senior second base
man Chris O'Riordan looks to extend his
hitting streak to 12 games, which would
set a career high for the All-American
candidate.

first baseman Chris Kinsey.

sophomore Drew Erlich (0-2,
