### MALCOLM LEVINE STAFF WRITER 
After a disappointing weekend at
Washington that saw the No. 4 Cardinal
(27-10,5-4 Pacific 10 Conference) lose its
first regular season series in almost a full

to more than get right back on the field
and try to get back on track.

when the Cardinal takes on Sacramento
State (15-22) in a non-conference game at

tonight against a struggling Hornets
team that lias lost three straight games
and 13 of its last 15.

still paces the Cardinal in all three of the
Triple Crown categories with a .385 hat
ting average, 10 home runs, and 39 RBI,
