## Stellar pitcher and stellar teammate 
### DEBORAH SPLANSKY STAFF WRITER 
Intense, devoted, hard
working, passionate, commit
ted and motivated.
When asking junior pitcher
Tori Nyberg's teammates to de
scribe the rising star in one word,
these were their responses.

SOFTBALL
Tonight: No. 3 Stanford vs.
Sacramento State, 5:00 p.m.,
Smith Family Stadium.

l here are no greater charac
teristics one can ask for in a pitch
er or teammate than those that
Nyberg's fellow Stanford softball
members gave the junior.
Nyberg did not travel far
when she joined the Stanford
softball team as she is a Bay
Area native. She was raised in
Belmont where she attended
Carlmont High School.
In fact, her earliest softball
memories pay tribute to her love
for Bay Area athletics.
"When I was six years old I
started playing softball and I was
on the A's bobby-sox team," Ny
berg reminisced. "I thought it
was the greatest thing ever be
cause there was actually a real
baseball team called the A's, and
we got to where green and yel
low uniforms just like them. I
felt so cool."
However, Nyberg did not start
out in the circle vowing early on
to never be a pitcher. But, her
softball team at age 11 needed a

pitcher and Tori stepped up.
This transition is all too fa
milial - to the events of this
2002 season.
Nyberg began her college ca
reer as one of four freshmen on

the Cardinal pitching staff and
now, midway through the confer
ence season, is one of only two el
igible hurlers for the No. 8 Stan
ford softball squad.
This situation has thrust Ny

berg into the lead role on the rub
ber and now that she is there, she
has done nothing but shine.
The junior has consistently
earned more innings and im
proved over her time with the
Cardinal. She is truly at the peak
of her career when her team
needs her most.
"1 think we all have heard over
the years how dominant Tori was
in high school," said junior left
fielder Cassi Brangham. "1 don't *
know how many California
records she holds. She has a lot of
great pitches, and a good break
on the ball. This year the combi
nation of her maturing as a pitch
er and her getting the chance to
throw a lot of games has set the
stage for the kind of season she
has had so far this year."
But it is not Nyberg's drop ball,
which has been deemed sick by
many opposing hitters, that
makes her such an integral part of
the Cardinal squad, but rather
the passion and dedication she
brings to the game and her team.
"She is such a hard-worker
and very intense," said junior sec
ond baseman Kira Ching. "Her
attitude rubs off on all of us and
helps the team focus."
Nyberg's leadership is not so
much a conscious one, but
rather a result of her own love
of the game.
"Tori is one of the hardest
workers 1 know," Brangham
said. "You can see on the field
that she has a genuine love for
the game of Softball."
