# Gymnastics finishes memorable season
## 
### NEMIL DALAL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Men who had chalk and honey
on their bands just a few weeks ago
are now armed with trash bags,
brooms, and old T-shirts, as they
embark on a little spring cleaning.
Lockers are emptied, equip
ment moved, and chalk cleaned up,
as the last vestiges of this fairly suc
cessful season are cleared away.
Capping off a mediocre regu
lar season, the No. 1 I ranked
men's gymnastics team surprised
everyone but itself, finishing
sixth in the team competition at
the NCAA championships in
Norman, Okla., with junior Mar
shall Erwin and sophomore
Daniel Gill going on to earn indi
vidual national championships
on rings and vault, respectively.
"It was a pretty good season," re
marks senior co-captain Ricardo
Andrade. "Actually, we exceeded a
lot of expectations, but not quite
our expectations."
(billing into the season after a 2-
8 mark last year, there was quite a
bit of outside doubt that this squad
could compete on the level of the
other gymnastics powerhouses
such as Oklahoma, Ohio State, and
Penn State.
What the critics overlooked was
the return of a third of the roster
from injury, and the added intensi
ty of new assistant coach Thorn
Glielmi. Combine this with a last
chance mentality for the five se
niors on the team, as well as a retir
ing 30-year veteran head coach
Sadao Hamada and the team just
wouldn't acquiesce to its critics.
In the first few months of the

season, the naysayers seemed to be
proven accurate, as the team stum
bled through its first few meets,
being beaten multiple times by the
superior squads of California and
Illinois. All the Cardinal could do
in those early meets was to, in turn,
beat up on a hapless UC-Santa
Barbara squad competing in its
last season.
Despite the lackluster record,
this slow start was hardly an indica
tor of things to come. Due to Mama
da's training regime, hard routines
aren't slowly implemented, but
rather immediately introduced, re
sulting in higher start values. Con
versely, team members have lower
scores earlier in the season because
they lind it harder to hit their rou
tines, but, in theory, their scores
should improve dramatically as the
season progresses.
"We're always [in the gym]
longer than anyone else, training
harder," said senior co-captain
and All-American David Durante.
"And everyone looks at us like
we're crazy because we're in the
gym so much. And they see the
routines that we can't hit. And
they're always like, man, ifthey hit,
they're going to be up there."
Hamada's strategy paid off.
After an 8-9 record, the team
finished the season by knocking
off No. 2 Oklahoma, the only
squad in the nation to do so this
year. The team couldn't dupli
cate that feat in the following
meet, the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation Champi
onships, as it finished in a
mediocre tbird-place.
"After we beat ()klahoma we got
a little t(x) overconfident," Durante
said. "Instead of using it to make us
work harder in the gym, we kind of
relaxed. And then when we got to
MPSFs, we fell all over the place
and we were a little bit of an embar
rassment to ourselves and that kind
of opened our eyes."
During the NCAA preliminar
ies, the team shocked much of the
crowd, finishing third with a
214.000, enough to qualify for the
NCAA, finals. Even more surpris
ingly, the Cardinal was a scant
1.375 points away from defending
national champion Ohio State.
"Nobody expected us to be com
petitive except us," explained Gliel
mi, who will take over the helm next
year. "So we knew we had the ele
ment of surprise on our
side . .. after four events [in the
preliminary round] we were in first.
Even I was surprised."
"On the second day, [Mama
da] told lis we weren't going to
hold anything back because
there really isn't a difference be
tween second and sixth place,"
said Andrade.
Fatigue, injury, and illness all
played a part on the last day of
competition, as the Cardinal's Cin
derella run came to an unheralded
end with it5212.775 score. Confer
ence rival Oklahoma went on to
win the national title with a strong
219.300 score.
Seemingly overmatched by the
other powerhouses, the team didn't
have the hits or breaks that it had
received the night before.
"Our energy level was just not
what it needed to be," said Glielmi.
"We started on high bar and it was
really flat, and that just set the pace
for the rest of the competition."
"I don't think any of the guys
have any regrets about what
happened the second night of
competition because there was
nothing left that they could do
more or that they left to chance,
as far as the timeline we had and
the ability of the athletes."
To add a bit of redemption to
such a lackluster finish, Erwin and
Gill — both top-ranked on the
rings and vault — justified the

rankings, finishing as national
champions on their respective
events. Durante also competed at
the individual finals, finishing fifth
on the horizontal bar.
Losing more than a third of
its team — seniors Andrade,
Justin Berkman, Jason Biltz,
Durante and David Ludlow —
and its head coach next year,
the squad will face an uphill
battle trying to duplicate this
year's feats. Fortunately, both
Erwin and Gill are returning,
as well as senior Cade Raggio
and juniors Paul O'Leary and
Matt McLean.
"We lost a strong group of com
petitors and that's going to hurt us
a lot," said Gill. "We'll have a good
couple of scorers, big team scorers

on every event, but we're just going
to need to fill in those lower scores."
With the small recruiting class of
two, this year's freshmen — Kelly
Lang, Bryan McColgan and Daniel
Torres-Rangel — will be looked
upon to pick up much of the slack.
Glielmi, taking over as head
coach next year, also is looking to
change the training regime.
"We'll be able to shift the training
season by two or three months, so
that their comfort level by the end of
the season is not an issue," said Gliel
nii. "My goal [is to] make Stanford a
powerhouse. I want us to be the
team everyone's gunning for."
For now, the team cleans up.
After all, a new coach, a new
team, and a new season are on
the horizon.
