# Gymnastics finishes memorable season
## 
### NEMIL DALAL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Men who had chalk and honey
on their bands just a few weeks ago
are now armed with trash bags,
brooms, and old T-shirts, as they
embark on a little spring cleaning.
Lockers are emptied, equip
ment moved, and chalk cleaned up,
as the last vestiges of this fairly suc
cessful season are cleared away.
Capping off a mediocre regu
lar season, the No. 1 I ranked
men's gymnastics team surprised
everyone but itself, finishing
sixth in the team competition at
the NCAA championships in
Norman, Okla., with junior Mar
shall Erwin and sophomore
Daniel Gill going on to earn indi
vidual national championships
on rings and vault, respectively.
"It was a pretty good season," re
marks senior co-captain Ricardo
Andrade. "Actually, we exceeded a
lot of expectations, but not quite
our expectations."
(billing into the season after a 2-
8 mark last year, there was quite a
bit of outside doubt that this squad
could compete on the level of the
other gymnastics powerhouses
such as Oklahoma, Ohio State, and
Penn State.
What the critics overlooked was
the return of a third of the roster
from injury, and the added intensi
ty of new assistant coach Thorn
Glielmi. Combine this with a last
chance mentality for the five se
niors on the team, as well as a retir
ing 30-year veteran head coach
Sadao Hamada and the team just
wouldn't acquiesce to its critics.
In the first few months of the

season, the naysayers seemed to be
proven accurate, as the team stum
bled through its first few meets,
being beaten multiple times by the
superior squads of California and
Illinois. All the Cardinal could do
in those early meets was to, in turn,
beat up on a hapless UC-Santa
Barbara squad competing in its
last season.
Despite the lackluster record,
this slow start was hardly an indica
tor of things to come. Due to Mama
da's training regime, hard routines
aren't slowly implemented, but
rather immediately introduced, re
sulting in higher start values. Con
versely, team members have lower
scores earlier in the season because
they lind it harder to hit their rou
tines, but, in theory, their scores
should improve dramatically as the
season progresses.
"We're always [in the gym]
longer than anyone else, training
harder," said senior co-captain
and All-American David Durante.
"And everyone looks at us like
we're crazy because we're in the
gym so much. And they see the
routines that we can't hit. And
they're always like, man, ifthey hit,
they're going to be up there."
Hamada's strategy paid off.
After an 8-9 record, the team
finished the season by knocking
off No. 2 Oklahoma, the only
squad in the nation to do so this
year. The team couldn't dupli
cate that feat in the following
meet, the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation Champi
onships, as it finished in a
mediocre tbird-place.
