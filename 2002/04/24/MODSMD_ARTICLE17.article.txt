This is always an exciting time of the year for
sports fans. The NBA playoffs are starting,
the NFL draft has just taken place and
Major League Baseball is about one-eighth
of the way through it's 162-game marathon season.
But the sports world just doesn't quite seem to be

able to grab the marquee headlines
tight now, for some inexplicable rea
son. Inexplicable in this case refers ei
ther to Middle East violence or pe
dophilic priests, whichever you find
more inexplicable â€” my money's
on Pope John Paul, personally.
Now don't get me wrong, I'm not
one to make light of the situation
brewing overseas that threatens the

livelihoods of millions of people afraid to leave their
homes out of fear of retaliatory strikes. Nor would I
belittle the situation brewing at home that threatens
the livelihoods of millions of people afraid to go to
Mass out of fear of a different of aggression.
Hut why should these incidents get more press
than Kobe dropping !M on the Blazers?
It's been argued that American s<xiety places too
much emphasis on sports, entertainment and other
frivolous endeavors.
Some say that we turn a blind eye to the issues that
are shaping the world in one way or another.
Maybe this is true, maybe not, but I think the more
important issue is, "What's so wrong with that?"
To be perfectly honest, I'd much rather spend an
afternoon watching Dirk Nowit/.kiand Kevin Garnett
battle it out on the basketball court than watch Wolf
Blitzer talk about, well, anything really.
Unfortunately, however, the rules of political cor

redness forbid explicit statement of (he fact that
sometimes people would like to allow human suffer
ing to take a back seat to rim-rockin NBA action.
This is the reason that if I were to say, "the media
hype surrounding the NFL draft is completely
overblown," no one would bat an eye, but if I were to
make the statement that, "the media hype surround
ing a bunch of eight-year old kids getting molested is
completely overblown," my editor would not hesitate
to fire me. (By the way. I II be looking fora new job by
the time you read this if any of you are hiring.)
You can call me inconsiderate, insensitive or apa
thetic, but watching the Middle East death toll rise
amid wave after wave of bloodshed and religious
rhetoric just doesn't do it for me like it used to. I want
to watch Bonds hit some dingers.
There's a good reason why you never have mass
protests in San Francisco for people to voice disap
proval of 49ers front-office polity or the unfair trade
practices of the Giants.
Sports contains an inherent level of detach
ment from reality that allow us, fora few hours in
a day, to escape the atrocities that are occurring
around us; to surround ourselves in an enterprise
that, despite free agency and collective bargaining
agreements, still hasn't lost its purity or penchant
for awe-inspiring moments.
No matter how mad we get when the A's lose, the
Yankees win, or the Warriors play, deep clown we
know that its still just a game, and that life and death
do not hang in the balance.
So when each new day brings with it sordid tales
of suicide bombers, repentant preac hers and finan-

rial scandals, where is the crime
in allowing sports to take center
stage, to detach us from the
dreadful reality that awaits when
the last buzzer sounds or the last
out is recorded?
When your only other choice is
to listen to shame-filled testimony
of a young parishioner against t he
person charged with delivering
the youngster from the world's

wicked ways, suddenly watching
the Bulls doesn't seem that bad.
Ok, Chicago, maybe that's going a
little bit too far.
So why don't we all do ourselves
a self-indulging favor and just
admit that it's okay to be a sports
fan even, and actually especially,
when times are the hardest.
A-Rod, not Ariel. Jaromir, not
Yasser. And, for the love of all
that is decent, anything but
Ashcroft, and I mean anything . .
. even NASCAR.
Sharon and Arafat can continue
bombing each other into oblivion.

I will gladly turn a blind eye. Bui
please be sure to keep your atroci
ties on a reasonably small scale, we
wouldn't want the horriftcally bad
news to pre-empt Mavs-Wolves
game two.
Now that would be a real
human tragedy.
