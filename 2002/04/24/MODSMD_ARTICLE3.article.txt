# U.S. News: Grad schools still on top
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
U.S. News & World Report has
released its graduate school rat
ings for 2003 - and once again,
Stanford placed highly, with the
Graduate School of Business and
the School of Education being
named the best in the country and
the School of Law and the School
of Engineering ranking second.
The annually released figures
are derived from criteria such as
an institution's academic reputa
tion based on the opinions of acad
emics around the country. Other
standards are acceptance rates for
its applicants and statistics on ad
mitted students, including their
undergraduate grade point aver
ages and standardized test scores.
The GSB retained its number
one ranking for the fourth year in
a row. Last year it had shared the
spot with Harvard Business
School, but this year Harvard
slipped to number two. The Whar
ton School of Business at Universi
ty of Pennsylvania and the Sloan
School of Business at MIT received
third and fourth, respectively.
The School of Education
moved up to first place this year
from second last year. I larvard's
program, which was ranked first
last year, slid down to a tie for sec
ond place with UCLA.
The School of Engineering at
Stanford came in second place,
keeping the same position as last
year. MI T took first, also retaining

its standing. While UC-Berkeley
maintained its tie with Stanford for
second, Caltech fell to seventh
place, even though it was tied for
second last year with Stanford and
UC-Berkeley.
The School of Law placed sec
ond for the third consecutive year.
Yale was ranked first and 1 larvard
and Columbia took third and
fourth place, respectively.
The School of Medicine fell to
11th place from its ranking of
ninth in the 2002 rankings. The
school is tied for the position with
Cornell. Harvard was the number
one medical school.
Medical School Dean Philip
Pizzo, in response to Stanford's
drop, questioned the methodolo
gy used for the ranking system.
Pizzo explained that the rankings
for such schools are largely deter
mined by funding from the Na
tional Institutes of Health.
"This obviously favors schools
that have a large faculty size, many
of which have also grown substan
tially during the past several years
in order to take advantage of the
doubling of the [Institutes'] bud
get," Pizzo said in a statement post
ed on the school's Web site. "More
faculty simply means a higher
amount of funding but says noth
ing about the quality of the re
search or the amount of support
per faculty member, the more im
portant measure in which Stan
lord tops the list."

Other prominent University
figures have also discredited such
rankings in the past, including for
mer University President Ger
hard Casper. Casper has alleged
that the ratings are "utterly mis
leading" since the criteria used to
establish them are often changed
each year.
