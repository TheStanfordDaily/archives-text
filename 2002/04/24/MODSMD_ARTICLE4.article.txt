# Jackson speaks as part of celebration
## 
### ANNE BECKER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Rev. Jesse Jackson ener
gized a packed Kresge Auditorium
last night, speaking on topics rang
ing from fair wages at Stanford to
the conflict in the Middle East at
iViva! Cesar Chavez, the concluding
event in El Centro Chicano's Ninth
Annual Commemorative Celebra
tion of Chavez's life.
Acknowledging Chavez as "a
fearless tighter and a magnet for
people seeking justice and fair
ness," Jackson repeatedly urged
Stanford students to advocate for
social justice.
"It is cheap to admire Chavez,"
Jackson said. "It doesn't take much
effort. The challenge is to follow
him. To follow him involves a will to
expand culture, a willingness to risk.
As difficult as things are right now,
we have the capacity to make the
crooked straight."
Jackson said Stanford students
had a special obligation to enact so
cial change.
"Higher opportunity gives high
er obligation to serve," he said "You
really cannot be at a campus so en
dowed and with such wealth and
not do good with it."
Jackson specifically addressed
Stanford's labor situation, saying
Chavez should serve as an inspi
ration for Stanford students to
advocate for higher wages for
their workers.
"This university is not a universi
ty free of cooks and maids and glass
cutters and painters," he said. "It is a
university of common people whose
skills give you comforts. The maid
can't buy bread and meat and gas
cheaper."
"In the end you're not measured

by your grades or your tuition, but
by liow you treat the janitor, and
those who make your comfort zone.
Fight for their living wage and you
are fighting for your own character.
Apply your skills and privilege to
serve them."
Jackson suggested that Stanford
students advocate fora policy that
would give children of University la
borers an advantage in applying for
admission, similar to that of children
of alumni.
"How marvelous the clay would
be when elite campuses have an in
side track for the kids ofjanitors and
maids," he said.
Jackson encouraged Stanford
students to "go beyond color and
culture" and advocate for social
change in general. He said it was
"this generation's challenge to up
hold changeless values in an chang
ing time and grasp the issues of our
time without fear."
Jackson similarly encouraged
advocating for democracy when he
addressed issues not specifically re
lated to Chavez or Stanford. He said
Americans should clearly impart de
mocratic values on the Middle East
to achieve peace.
"We are spreading confusion,
not clarity," he said. "We can't
have [Secretary of State Colin]
Powell in the Middle East shuffling
between Ramallah and Jerusalem
and have his own staff members in
Washington leading a protest
against his mission. We must speak
clearly and have the courage of our
convictions."
Jackson is in the Bay Area for the
2002 Digital Connections confer
ence of his Rainbow/PUSH Silicon
Valley Project, a group that aims to
"bridge the digital divide" and pro
vide minorities with equal access to

technology. He spoke to this issue,
calling equal access to capital, indus
try, and technology the "current
step in the civil rights movement."
"All this technology still does not
change the fact that we have first
class jails and second-class schools,"
he said.
Jackson said he had no plans to
run for any office anytime soon but
said that whoever did run "cannot
be like [President Cieorge W.J Bush
and be driven by fear," criticizing
the president for not addressing
AIDS in Africa in his State of the
Union address and wavering on his
Middle East policy.
Jackson said he believed civil lib
erties of Americans have been con
tinually violated in the investigation
of minorities following Sept. 11.
"[Attorney General John]
Ashcroft is disregarding civil liber
ties," he said "He used the process as
a pretense to harass people and pro

file 'Muslim and Arab-looking peo
ple.' That is absolutely un-Ameri
can. It didn't make us any safer. As
we Americans look for civil order,
we must not become uncivil in our
means to get there."
Calling attention to the fact that
he had been adopted, Jackson
cautioned Stanford students to
"be careful" how they treated "at
risk children."
"The cure for cancer or AIDS, or
world peace might come from an at
risk child whose mother washes
dishes on this campus," he said.
"Give all children a chance."
The event was co-sponsored by
El Centro, MEChA, the ASSU
Speakers Bureau and the Chavez
Commemoration Committee and
marked the end of the month-long
commemoration, entitled "La
Luc ha Continua," or the Struggle


FRANCOIS BRAHIC/The Stanford Daily
Speaking as part of a Cesar Chavez commemoration, the Rev. Jesse Jack
son addressed a wide variety of topics last night. He proposed a program
to give children of Stanford laborers an advantage in admission.
Continues.
El Centra program coordinator
Diana Vizcarra noted the link, be
tween Jackson and Chavez.
"Jackson is a public figure who
embodies the philosophies and
ideas of Chavez and shows us that
these ideas are applicable today,"
she said.
El Centro invited Jackson to
speak at the event due to his asso
ciation with Chavez, according to
Chris Gonzalez Clarke, Assistant
Director of El Centro. Jackson con
vinced Chavez to end his 36-day
East for Eife in support oft he Unit
ed Farm Workers' campaign to
boycott grapes and end the use of
dangerous pesticides. 1 le was also
a pallbearer at Chavez's funeral.
Program coordinator Anthony
Ocampo said he hoped students
remembered the event's focus
was on Chavez and not on Jack

son as a public figure.
"This month has been about
the life and work of Chavez,"
Ocampo said. "Chavez dedicated
his entire lile to the pursuance of
civil liberties and rights for all. His
legacy continues to be a light to
anyone lighting for civil liberties
in the world."
Sarita Ocon, the artistic director
for the program, said though she
was pleased with Jackson's speech,
she was disappointed that the ma
jority of students did not stay for
the rest of the program.
"It's sad that the rest of the Stan
ford community could not be here
to enjoy the purpose of the Chavez
commemoration," she said. "It was
very nice to have Jesse Jackson
speak, but people are forgetting
what the program was for."
Student reaction to Jackson's
speech was largely positive.
"It was an amazing, incredible
speech," said freshman Anna
Mumford. "The feet that he ad
dressed the living wage issue
showed that everything is not just

philosophy, that we at the Universi
ty can do something to help."
In an effort to increase campus
awareness of Chavez's work, this
year El Centro extended the Chavez
commemoration from a week to a
month and co-sponsored events
with other campus groups such as
Gamma /eta Alpha fraternity,
MEChA, and the Filipino American
Student Union.
