Stanford Mock Trial competed
in its first national tournament
April 5 to April 7 at Drake Univer
sity in Des Moines, lowa. The team
placed in the top 20 in its bracket
there. Mock trial is a competition in
which students study a criminal or
civil case and act the parts of
lawyers and witnesses and "try" the
case in court.
President Elizabeth Eraker, a
sophomore, said she was de
lighted to make it to the nation
al competition.
"Considering the age of our

team — six freshmen and two
sophomores — and the level of
competition at the tournament, we
were pleased with our perfor
mance and definitely plan on re
turning to the tournament next
year," Eraker said.
The top three teams in the re
gional tournament, which was
held Feb. 2 to Feb. 4 in Ontario,
Calif., advanced to the national
competition. Stanford Mock Trial
has two teams of eight students
each, hut only one team qualified
for nationals. It placed third at the
regional tournament. The other
team had a chance at qualifying for
the national competition by partic

ipating in a different tournament,
hut decided not to because the
tournament was the week before
winter quarter finals.
At the national competition,
the team lost in its fourth round of
the tournament.
"The fourth round was really
important," said freshman I lanna
Chiou. "We lost both ballots to
George Washington [University]. It
was an amazing school."
Chiou said that the best part of
her experience was bonding with
the team, although the location was
less than desirable.
"My favorite part... definitely
not being in lowa," she joked, "1 en

joyed spending more time with the
people on my team. I didn't know
the people well enough; now we're
really good friends."
She said she also liked the chance
to meet other mock trial teams.
" I liked seeing other schools and
seeing people who care as much as
you about mock trial," she said.
Members of the team returned
during spring break and spent their
days preparing for the tournament.
Law students Dmitry Bam and
Nora Freeman coached the team
that went to Des Moines.
The team practices 10 hours per
