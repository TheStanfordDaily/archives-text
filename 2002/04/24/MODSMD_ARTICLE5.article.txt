### ERIN ARCHERD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford Mock Trial competed
in its first national tournament
April 5 to April 7 at Drake Univer
sity in Des Moines, lowa. The team
placed in the top 20 in its bracket
there. Mock trial is a competition in
which students study a criminal or
civil case and act the parts of
lawyers and witnesses and "try" the
case in court.
President Elizabeth Eraker, a
sophomore, said she was de
lighted to make it to the nation
al competition.
"Considering the age of our

team — six freshmen and two
sophomores — and the level of
competition at the tournament, we
were pleased with our perfor
mance and definitely plan on re
turning to the tournament next
year," Eraker said.
The top three teams in the re
gional tournament, which was
held Feb. 2 to Feb. 4 in Ontario,
Calif., advanced to the national
competition. Stanford Mock Trial
has two teams of eight students
each, hut only one team qualified
for nationals. It placed third at the
regional tournament. The other
team had a chance at qualifying for
the national competition by partic

ipating in a different tournament,
hut decided not to because the
tournament was the week before
winter quarter finals.
At the national competition,
the team lost in its fourth round of
the tournament.
"The fourth round was really
important," said freshman I lanna
Chiou. "We lost both ballots to
George Washington [University]. It
was an amazing school."
Chiou said that the best part of
her experience was bonding with
the team, although the location was
less than desirable.
"My favorite part... definitely
not being in lowa," she joked, "1 en

joyed spending more time with the
people on my team. I didn't know
the people well enough; now we're
really good friends."
She said she also liked the chance
to meet other mock trial teams.
" I liked seeing other schools and
seeing people who care as much as
you about mock trial," she said.
Members of the team returned
during spring break and spent their
days preparing for the tournament.
Law students Dmitry Bam and
Nora Freeman coached the team
that went to Des Moines.
The team practices 10 hours per
week, starting in October. Team
members scrimmage every week
end starting in January to prepare
for the regional tournament. The
program is run largely by students.
Team membership is open to all
undergraduates and the competi
tive teams are selected through a
tryout. It plans on expanding to
three competitive teams and
adding ;ui invitational tournament
at UCLA to its schedule next year.
"Mock trial is a unique opportu
nity to gain firsthand knowledge of
the legal system," Eraker said.
"Students perform as attorneys
and witnesses, developing an ex
ceptional combination of drama
and debate while promoting an
awareness and understanding of
the judicial process."
The members of the Des
Moines team were sophomores
Eraker and Julia Martinez, and
freshmen Chiou, Brendan
Marten, John Kr/.ywicki, Valicia
Saucedo, Jennifer Zimbroff and
Juliet Rose Frerking.
