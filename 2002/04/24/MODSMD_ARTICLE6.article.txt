### ALI ALEMOZAFAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Canadian professor Laurie King-
Irani gave a talk yesterday on the
pending case against the alleged per
petrators of the 1982 Sabra and
Shatila massacre which, according to
her, has earned Israeli Prime Minis
ter Ariel Sharon the nickname "The
Butcher of Beirut." I ler talk was pre
sented by the Coalition for Justice in
Israel/Palestine and attracted a
crowd of 60 people.
A professor of social anthropolo
gy at the University of Victoria,
Canada, King-Irani is the North
American coordinator of the Inter
national Campaign for Justice for the
Victims of Sabra and Shatila.
King-Irani gave an account of the
1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon.
She said that during the invasion
over 1,000 Palestinian civilians were

tortured, raped and murdered in
the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps
in Beirut by Lebanese militiamen
aligned with the Israeli army. Ai that
time the Israeli army was under the
command of then-Defense Minister
Ariel Sharon, and in complete con
trol of Beirut, she said.
"There is currently a case in Bel
gium against Ariel Sharon," said cul
tural and social anthropology gradu
ate student Vael Ben-zvi, one of the
event's coordinators. "Especially
when Israel is currently conducting
war crimes, like in Jenin, it is impor
tant to bring war criminals to justice."
"The 20th century brought us
many examples of genocide," King-
Irani said, referring to the "horrors
of the Na/i holocaust" and"the
atrocities the Jewish people faced."
According to King-Irani, despite
the fact that the killings of the
Lebanese and Palestinian civilians

were carried out by Lebanese militia
units affiliated directly or indirectly
with the Israeli-backed Christian
Lebanese Forces, the legal, military
and decision-making responsibility
ultimately rests with Ariel Sharon
under established and recognized
principles of international law.
"Israel's high command in Beirut
knew what was going on ... there
lore. the Israeli's high command and
Ariel Sharon are guilty," King-Irani
said.
On June 18, 2001, the 23 sur
vivors of the Sabra and Shatila mas
sacres filed a case c harging Sharon
and other Israeli and Lebanese offi
cials with war crimes, crimes against
humanity and genocide related to
the massacres committed in Sabra
and Shatila.
"This is not a case lodged against
Ariel Sharon alone but others as well,"
King-Irani said. "It is not a case moti

vated by any anti-Semitic sentiments."
According to King-Irani, the case
attempts to realize and implement
the principle of universal jurisdiction
under tenets enshrined in the fourth
Geneva Convention and interna
tional law. Similar cases include those
of Chile's ex-president Ceneral Au
gusto Pinochet and former Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic.
"'Hie Belgiumcourt in 1999 passed
a law removing immunity from
heads of state," King-Irani added.
In light of recent world events,
coverage of the genocide in Sabra
and Shatila by the U.S. media is
sparse, she said.
"So many Americans don't even
know that there was a massacre in
Sabra and Shatila," King-Irani said.
"The American public is to a large
degree vested in that," Ben-zvi said.
"They should know how their tax
dollars are used."
