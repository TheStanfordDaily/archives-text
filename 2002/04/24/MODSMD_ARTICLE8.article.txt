The Orbitor Electronic Listen
ing Device is so powerful than it
can pick up conversations from up
to 300 feet away. It also allows you
to record up to 12 seconds on its
built-in digital chip for playback.
The Orbitors viewfinder can mag
nify what you're spying on, and a
pair of padded full-size head
phones is included in the kit. The
unit weighs only 1.5 pounds, and
its retail price is about $(35.
Sony's Vaio MX is a PC, that

is loaded with a Mini Disc drive, a
Memory Stick media slot, and a
Type II PC Card slot. It also
comes with a DVD-R/DVD-RW
drive with 512 MB of memory.
The only catch: with a 15-inch
LCD monitor, the price comes to
a staggering $3,400.
