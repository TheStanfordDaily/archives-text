## The
						Stanford Daily International students deserve need-blind admission 
### 
Published Since 1891

This school year has not been the
nicest to international students in
the United States. After the Sept.
11 attacks, international students
— especially those from Arab countries —
were increasingly scrutinized and many
were unsure if coming to the United States
to study was the right idea. We hope that
many of the prospective international stu
dents who recently came to Admit Weekend
will return to Stanford in the fall.
There is something right now that Stan
ford could do to demonstrate that it highly
values its international students: make an
unequivocal commitment to offer need
blind admission to its international stu

dents. Stanford currently has this policy,
which allows for admission without regard
to financial need, for domestic students.
The curent limitation severely limits
the diversity of the foreign students who
attend Stanford. This is one reason why
Stanford has fewer students from Africa
and Latin America than from Europe
and Asia.
Few students from developing countries
or those who are not part of their country's
elite can afford a Stanford education.
This negatively affects the ability of
Stanford to create a vibrant international
community. If one reason for accepting
international students to Stanford is to in

crease cross-cultural understanding on
campus, by limiting its international stu
dents based on wealth, the University and
its students miss out on the valuable con
tributions of international students from
varied economic backgrounds.
To their credit, University officials have
in principle supported giving Stanford's in
ternational students need-blind admission.
Their major concern is that the University
currently does not have the funds to do
this. According to the Committee on Un
dergraduate Admission and Financial Aid's
20()0-2()()l annual report, Vice President
for Development John Ford, indicated that
a campaign to endow need-blind admission

for international students would take five to
eight years. Some financial aid may become
available sooner. This is a serious obstacle,
given the University's limited financial re
sources and many needs.
Five to eight years is too long, though.
Compared to its East Coast rivals, Stanford
has already fallen behind. Currently Har
vard, Princeton, Yale and MIT all offer com
plete need-blind admission to their interna
tional students. If Stanford does not change
its policy soon, it will lose some of the most
qualified international students because
they don't have enough money to attend
Stanford. We encourage the University to
find a way to begin this program sooner.
