# SOCS provides music, entertainment to the elderly
## Sounds for senior citizens 
### FELIX SU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A Dvorak American String Quar
tet, Rachmaninoff concertos, ex
cerpts from "Danny Boy," Grateful
Dead guitar hits — such a medley will
not be found on the program for an
upcoming musical extravaganza at
Carnegie Hall. Instead, this eclectic
repertoire of classical and contempo
rary tunes will reach the ears of resi
dents at Stanford's VA Hospital in
Menlo Park.
SOCS, a student-run organization
that provides music and entertain
ment to the elderly, will be showcasing
a variety of Stanford performers at the
hospital in early May.
SOCS — one of seven community
service programs affiliated with the
Stanford Alliance for Service Through
the Arts — explains its purpose in its
mission statement: "to provide senior
citizens in the community with excel
lent musical concerts performed by
talented Stanford musicians, and to
provide Stanford musicians an oppor
tunity to perform in a rewarding and
informal concert setting."
SOCS has already held two concerts
this year, both at the Lytton Gardens
Retirement Center in Palo Alto.
The group itself was founded
three years ago, and was recently re
vived by sophomore Cindy Mong, ju
nior Justin Estaris and junior Elyse
Nakajima, who now serve as its co-di
rectors. The three balance their co
ordinating responsibilities with their
own musical talents; Mong and Es
taris play the violin and piano respec
tively, while Nakajima is an accom
plished singer.
"For those who do not know how it
feels to perform, it feels exhilarating,"
Mong said. "To be able to touch other
people, change the way they feel and
see the world fora short while is a in
credible rush. I always felt that you

perform to share something with oth
ers, even if I cannot always articulate
what that something is."
For SOCS participants, this experi
ence is especially rewarding when
singing or playing for the elderly.
"The residents [at Lytton Gar
dens] have been incredibly recfcp
tive," Estaris said. "They're such an
awesome group of people with so
much to share, but they're often un
derappreciated. Performing for
them is our way of showing how
much we appreciate them."
"I really like perforpiing for se
nior citizens — there isn't a nicer au
dience to be found in any other age
group," added sophomore Rebby
Allen, a vocalist who has performed
at the year's two previous events at
Lytton Gardens. She will sing again
at the hospital.
SOCS participants espouse a firm
belief in the enriching and therapeutic
value of listening to live music, partic
ularly for those who are no longer able
to attend concerts and performances
regularly.
"|MusicJ can help us through the
hardest times, and it can provide us
with some temporary relief from the
daily stresses of life," Estaris said.
"The SOCS program is great in that it
gives musicians the opportunity to ac
tually use their musical talents to pro
vide a service for others — to help res
idents at the Lytton Gardens nursing
home and patients at the hospital es
cape their problems fora few hours
through music."
Musicians are contacted via an out
reach effort on the part of the co-di
rectors, who then meet with perform
ers on a personal basis to discuss their
ideas for pieces and ensembles.
"Typically, performers who are in
terested in SOCS are already in pre
formed groups and take the opportu
nity to play in an informal setting. We
try to match up solo performers with

accompanists," Mong said.
While the performers do not gather
together, for formal dress rehearsals,
each is responsible for completing the
amount of practice he or she needs be
fore the event. Besides honing their
own individual crafts, the co-directors
meet weekly to plan both current per
formance agendas and future devel
opments.
"Significant time this quarter was
devoted to expanding SOCS to a suit
able place beyond Lytton Gardens
Community Center," Mong said. "We
really wanted to reach out to individu
als who might not have the chance to
meet Stanford musicians."
When asked about the targeted lis
teners, Mong discussed the residents
at the hospital.
" The majority of our audience is in
the 60 to 80-year old range, and many
at the Menlo Park VAare patients with
significant psychiatric or neurode
generative disorders."
The idea for bringing SOCS to this
group emerged from Mong's volun
teer work at the hospital.
"We wanted to bring our concert
series to other venues in the area, and
the VA seemed like a great place fora
concert," Estaris said.
Both Mong and Estaris encourage
increased support and contribution
from the musical community at Stan
ford, both for this event and for future
performances.
"We definitely need to increase vis
ibility — we know that there are so
many musically gifted students here at
Stanford, and we are really working at
getting more and more of those stu
dents to help our program out," Es
taris said.
Mong added, "We are still seeking
performers, so interested performers
are encouraged to contact Cindy
Mong at cmo.ng@stanford.edu."
The event will be held from 1:30
p.m. to 3 p.m. on May 5.

rary tunes will reach the ears of resi
dents at Stanford's VA Hospital in
Menlo Park.
SOCS, a student-run organization
that provides music and entertain
ment to the elderly, will be showcasing
a variety of Stanford performers at the
hospital in early May.
SOCS — one of seven community
service programs affiliated with the
Stanford Alliance for Service Through
the Arts — explains its purpose in its
mission statement: "to provide senior
citizens in the community with excel
lent musical concerts performed by
talented Stanford musicians, and to
provide Stanford musicians an oppor
tunity to perform in a rewarding and
informal concert setting."
SOCS has already held two concerts
this year, both at the Lytton Gardens
Retirement Center in Palo Alto.
The group itself was founded
three years ago, and was recently re
vived by sophomore Cindy Mong, ju
nior Justin Estaris and junior Elyse
Nakajima, who now serve as its co-di
rectors. The three balance their co
ordinating responsibilities with their
own musical talents; Mong and Es
taris play the violin and piano respec
tively, while Nakajima is an accom
plished singer.
"For those who do not know how it
feels to perform, it feels exhilarating,"
Mong said. "To be able to touch other
people, change the way they feel and
see the world fora short while is a in
credible rush. I always felt that you

perform to share something with oth
ers, even if I cannot always articulate
what that something is."
For SOCS participants, this experi
ence is especially rewarding when
singing or playing for the elderly.
"The residents [at Lytton Gar
dens] have been incredibly recfcp
tive," Estaris said. "They're such an
awesome group of people with so
much to share, but they're often un
derappreciated. Performing for
them is our way of showing how
much we appreciate them."
"I really like perforpiing for se
nior citizens — there isn't a nicer au
dience to be found in any other age
group," added sophomore Rebby
Allen, a vocalist who has performed
at the year's two previous events at
Lytton Gardens. She will sing again
at the hospital.
SOCS participants espouse a firm
belief in the enriching and therapeutic
value of listening to live music, partic
ularly for those who are no longer able
to attend concerts and performances
regularly.
"|MusicJ can help us through the
hardest times, and it can provide us
with some temporary relief from the
daily stresses of life," Estaris said.
"The SOCS program is great in that it
gives musicians the opportunity to ac
tually use their musical talents to pro
vide a service for others — to help res
idents at the Lytton Gardens nursing
home and patients at the hospital es
cape their problems fora few hours
through music."
Musicians are contacted via an out
reach effort on the part of the co-di
rectors, who then meet with perform
ers on a personal basis to discuss their
ideas for pieces and ensembles.
"Typically, performers who are in
terested in SOCS are already in pre
formed groups and take the opportu
nity to play in an informal setting. We
try to match up solo performers with

accompanists," Mong said.
While the performers do not gather
together, for formal dress rehearsals,
each is responsible for completing the
amount of practice he or she needs be
fore the event. Besides honing their
own individual crafts, the co-directors
meet weekly to plan both current per
formance agendas and future devel
opments.
"Significant time this quarter was
devoted to expanding SOCS to a suit
able place beyond Lytton Gardens
Community Center," Mong said. "We
really wanted to reach out to individu
als who might not have the chance to
meet Stanford musicians."
When asked about the targeted lis
teners, Mong discussed the residents
at the hospital.
" The majority of our audience is in
the 60 to 80-year old range, and many
at the Menlo Park VAare patients with
significant psychiatric or neurode
generative disorders."
The idea for bringing SOCS to this
group emerged from Mong's volun
teer work at the hospital.
"We wanted to bring our concert
series to other venues in the area, and
the VA seemed like a great place fora
concert," Estaris said.
Both Mong and Estaris encourage
increased support and contribution
from the musical community at Stan
ford, both for this event and for future
performances.
"We definitely need to increase vis
ibility — we know that there are so
many musically gifted students here at
Stanford, and we are really working at
getting more and more of those stu
dents to help our program out," Es
taris said.
Mong added, "We are still seeking
performers, so interested performers
are encouraged to contact Cindy
Mong at cmo.ng@stanford.edu."
The event will be held from 1:30
p.m. to 3 p.m. on May 5.
