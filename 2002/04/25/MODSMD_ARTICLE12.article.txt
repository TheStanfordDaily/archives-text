## The Stanford Daily RA selection process unfair to returning applicants
### 
Published Since 1891

Spring quarter, besides bringing Yell
Leader tryouts and the infamous
Draw, also marks the beginning of
the Resident Assistant selection pro
cess, through which over 170 students are se
lected from a pool of about 300 applicants to
become RAs for the next academic year.
This month, 25 currently and previously em
ployed RAs applied to become RAs on the Row
next year, and 19 of them were denied a first
round interview. This stands in contrast with
the fact that first-time RA applicants applying to
the Row are automatically guaranteed first
round interviews. We believe that returning ap
plicants are being unfairly treated in this pro
cess and that — for the benefit of the Row,
which prides itself in being largely student-run
— including returning applicants in the Row
interview process would only improve the qual
ity of Row RAs.

A first-time RA applicant is automatically
interviewed through what is known as
"Group Process," in which students are ques
tioned by Residential Education officials and
simultaneously observed by student staff rep
resentatives from the Row Houses.
This aspect was added in part to give Row
staff members the chance to voice their opin
ions on RA applicants. Also, since Row hous
es select their manager teams before RA se
lection begins, the 2002-2003 managerial
staff in each Row house can help choose its
RAin this process.
Nepotism in choosing Row staff has long
been a concern for students and for Residen
tial Education. Row house residents often
pick their friends for staff positions. Howev
er, RA selection, known for being a difficult
process with a self-selected applicant pool,
has always been regarded as objective. On

the Row, managers tend to like RAs —
friends or not — they can see themselves
working with successfully.
Some officials believe that allowing too
many returning RAs in the Row interview pro
cess increases nepotism in Row staff selection.
We wonder why these officials think returning
RAs have more connections on the Row than
any other upperclassman at Stanford.
Returning RA applicants to the Row are
not guaranteed a first-round interview. In
stead, they are being screened before a per
sonal first-round interview conducted only
with an official from Residential Education.
We see this extra level of screening as unnec
essary. Further, we cannot understand why
applicants who are already clearly qualified
to be RAs are being screened more carefully
than those who have never gone through the
selection process before.

The rejected returning applicants were
told that their ability to be RAs was not ques
tioned, but their ability to meet the specific
needs of the Row was considered in the pro
cess. If the Row is a part of Res Ed, we think
its vision ought to be similar to the overarch
ing vision of Res Ed. Reapplying RAs have al
ready projected that vision in the past, so we
feel strongly that the Row cannot dismiss ap
plicants on this basis.
In an area of campus where the communi
ty depends so much on student staffs and res
idents, current RAs bring with them enthusi
asm for residential education and tried-and
true methods of implementing program
ming. In the interview process alone, the
presence of current RAs will make the pro
cess more competitive and dependent on
qualifications, ensuring the best applicants
overall are selected.
