## Building a global village 
### 
If only they could talk to each other.
If only they could get to know their
"enemies" on a personal level. Then
there would be understanding.
Then there would be cooperation. Then
there would be peace.
That's what I lamely like to think about
much of the ethnic conflict in the world. I
like to believe that it's all a lapse in com
munication that can be overcome by a free
press and an open mind. But what I'm
seeing around the world is slowly laying
siege to my idealistic sentiments.
I'm not alone in my naivete, l ed Turn
er, the founder of CNN, once said, "My

main concern is to be a
benefit to the world, to
build up a global commu
nications system that
helps humanity come to
gether."
Supporting such feel
ing is the idea that hu
manity has so much in
common that true, open,

honest discussion can bring many opposing
people and parties together. As Ernest
Hello, a French Catholic philosopher,
wrote, "There are men who would quickly
love each other if once they were speak to
each other; for when they spoke they would
discover that their souls had only separated
by phantoms and delusions."
To me one of the most important ideals
of international journalism is to allow peo
ple to talk to each other and to illuminate
the human condition in such a way as to
breed mutual understanding.
With this in mind, the development of
the Internet and the spread of broadcast
technology spawned hope that people
previously controlled by the whims of
their authoritative governments or held
back by the wretched conditions in which
they lived might renounce the hatred and
misunderstanding of their past.
Maybe eventually this will come to
pass. But the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
has shown that satellites and cameras
and polished news anchors don't magi
cally bring about enlightened discourse
between warring parties.
Al-Jazeera, the satellite Arab news net
work beamed throughout the Middle East
from Qatar, is a perfect example.
The development of such an open and
free source of news has been wonderful
for the region. After the founding of Al-
Jazeera in 1996, Saudis could finally see
critical reports of their authoritative lead
ers, Egyptians could watch something
other than the heavily censored, state-sup
porting drivel they are served on a daily
basis and Iraqis could read more realistic
assessments of their tyrannical leadership.
Because of this, Al-Jazeera has taken
some fire from the Arab world. An Al-
Jazeera reporter was once kicked out by
the Palestinian Authority for broadcasting
reports about Palestinian atrocities and a
Kuwaiti judge wants to prosecute the sta

don fora story concerning Kuwaiti re
criminations after the Gulf War.
Yet Al-Jazeera isn't always an impartial
beacon of justice, exposing the problems
of all sides. Like any journalistic organiza
tion, Al-Jazeera has a slant, in this case a
decidedly pro-Arab stance.
This isn't surprising. CNN takes a decid
edly pro-American stance that has become
even more obvious in the past six months.
The New York Times, the Washington
Post, Newsweek, Time and every other
mainstream American publication is the
same. An organization made up of Ameri
cans reporting news to Americans is going
to reflect mainstream American opinion.
The same is true of an Arab news outlet.
But, especially in times of conflict, this
appears more likely to bring out the most
biased responses in all parties. In this re
gard, instead of calming the outrage and
working towards cooperation, the inter
net and 24-hour television news coverage
have actually led to further misunder
standing and anger. When under attack,
people, including the press, instinctively
cling to their side.
Thus, we see Al-Jazeera refer to every
Palestinian who died at the hands of the Is
raelis as a martyr, including those known to
be responsible for attacks on Israeli civilians.
Not exacdy the mark of an objective debate.
In a sense, it's just another reaffirma
tion of the famous saying, "all politics is
local." Surely the benefits of technology
have not been fully realized, especially in
poorer countries, and the history of such
widespread cross-cultural communication
is still quite young.
But, local histories and fears and out
rages still dominate. Just because we know
each other, read about each other, see
each other acting the same way and doing
the same things doesn't mean we're going
to like each other and live in peace.
We have long heard talk of a global vil
lage, a place where technology allows ev
eryone to interact and live together in co
operation and peace. But, as anyone who
has lived in a small town can tell you, a vil
lage isn't always the Rockwellian picture of
tranquil society.
Instead, as Packer concludes, "at this
halfway point between mutual ignorance
and true understanding, the 'global village'
actually resembles a real one â€” in my expe
rience, not the Utopian community
promised by the boosters of globalization
but a parochial place of manifold suspicions,
rumors, resentments and half-truths."
The Internet and live, satellite televi
sion are not going to bring the world to
gether on their own. Some deeper trans
formation has to occur. Maybe the spread
of information will facilitate these deeper
changes over time. But in ihe short term,
the world has proven to be much more dif
ficult to change.

If only they could talk to each other.
If only they could get to know their
"enemies" on a personal level. Then
there would be understanding.
Then there would be cooperation. Then
there would be peace.
That's what I lamely like to think about
much of the ethnic conflict in the world. I
like to believe that it's all a lapse in com
munication that can be overcome by a free
press and an open mind. But what I'm
seeing around the world is slowly laying
siege to my idealistic sentiments.
I'm not alone in my naivete, l ed Turn
er, the founder of CNN, once said, "My

main concern is to be a
benefit to the world, to
build up a global commu
nications system that
helps humanity come to
gether."
Supporting such feel
ing is the idea that hu
manity has so much in
common that true, open,

honest discussion can bring many opposing
people and parties together. As Ernest
Hello, a French Catholic philosopher,
wrote, "There are men who would quickly
love each other if once they were speak to
each other; for when they spoke they would
discover that their souls had only separated
by phantoms and delusions."
To me one of the most important ideals
of international journalism is to allow peo
ple to talk to each other and to illuminate
the human condition in such a way as to
breed mutual understanding.
With this in mind, the development of
the Internet and the spread of broadcast
technology spawned hope that people
previously controlled by the whims of
their authoritative governments or held
back by the wretched conditions in which
they lived might renounce the hatred and
misunderstanding of their past.
Maybe eventually this will come to
pass. But the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
has shown that satellites and cameras
and polished news anchors don't magi
cally bring about enlightened discourse
between warring parties.
Al-Jazeera, the satellite Arab news net
work beamed throughout the Middle East
from Qatar, is a perfect example.
The development of such an open and
free source of news has been wonderful
for the region. After the founding of Al-
Jazeera in 1996, Saudis could finally see
critical reports of their authoritative lead
ers, Egyptians could watch something
other than the heavily censored, state-sup
porting drivel they are served on a daily
basis and Iraqis could read more realistic
assessments of their tyrannical leadership.
Because of this, Al-Jazeera has taken
some fire from the Arab world. An Al-
Jazeera reporter was once kicked out by
the Palestinian Authority for broadcasting
reports about Palestinian atrocities and a
Kuwaiti judge wants to prosecute the sta

don fora story concerning Kuwaiti re
criminations after the Gulf War.
Yet Al-Jazeera isn't always an impartial
beacon of justice, exposing the problems
of all sides. Like any journalistic organiza
tion, Al-Jazeera has a slant, in this case a
decidedly pro-Arab stance.
This isn't surprising. CNN takes a decid
edly pro-American stance that has become
even more obvious in the past six months.
The New York Times, the Washington
Post, Newsweek, Time and every other
mainstream American publication is the
same. An organization made up of Ameri
cans reporting news to Americans is going
to reflect mainstream American opinion.
The same is true of an Arab news outlet.
But, especially in times of conflict, this
appears more likely to bring out the most
biased responses in all parties. In this re
gard, instead of calming the outrage and
working towards cooperation, the inter
net and 24-hour television news coverage
have actually led to further misunder
standing and anger. When under attack,
people, including the press, instinctively
cling to their side.
Thus, we see Al-Jazeera refer to every
Palestinian who died at the hands of the Is
raelis as a martyr, including those known to
be responsible for attacks on Israeli civilians.
Not exacdy the mark of an objective debate.
In a sense, it's just another reaffirma
tion of the famous saying, "all politics is
local." Surely the benefits of technology
have not been fully realized, especially in
poorer countries, and the history of such
widespread cross-cultural communication
is still quite young.
But, local histories and fears and out
rages still dominate. Just because we know
each other, read about each other, see
each other acting the same way and doing
the same things doesn't mean we're going
to like each other and live in peace.
We have long heard talk of a global vil
lage, a place where technology allows ev
eryone to interact and live together in co
operation and peace. But, as anyone who
has lived in a small town can tell you, a vil
lage isn't always the Rockwellian picture of
tranquil society.
Instead, as Packer concludes, "at this
halfway point between mutual ignorance
and true understanding, the 'global village'
actually resembles a real one â€” in my expe
rience, not the Utopian community
promised by the boosters of globalization
but a parochial place of manifold suspicions,
rumors, resentments and half-truths."
The Internet and live, satellite televi
sion are not going to bring the world to

formation has to occur. Maybe the spread
of information will facilitate these deeper
changes over time. But in ihe short term,
