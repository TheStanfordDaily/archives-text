Israel has destroyed Palestinian lives
with its settlement policies
I am writing in response to Brian
Ball's letter entitled "Daily Coverage of
Israeli Independence Day 'misleading'
(April 22).
The point of the protest by Students
for Palestine was to tell the Palestinian
side of the story.
Israel's founders rendered 700,000
people refugees. As sociologist Lisa Hajjar
and History Prof. Joel Beinin point out,
"one Israeli military intelligence docu
ment indicates that at least 75 percent of
the refugees left due to Zionist or Israeli
military actions, psychological campaigns
aimed at frightening people into leaving,
and direct expulsions."
Fifty-four years later, the situation is
no better. Palestinians either live in exile
or under brutal occupation. Despite out
wardly embracing the formula of "land
for peace," Israel continues to confiscate
Palestinian land to build more and more
illegal settlements on Palestinian land.
Since September 2000, the Palestine
Red Crescent Society reports that in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, 1,474 Pales
tinians have died and 19,051 have been
injured. Most of these were civilians
under the age of 20.
As a result of Israel's recent illegal ag
gression in the Occupied Territories on
March 29, hundreds if not thousands of
Palestinians civilians either died or were
injured. The Israeli human rights orga
nization B'Tselem reports widespread
human rights abuses by the Israeli occu
pation army, such as using innocent
civilians as human shields and barring
the injured from receiving proper medi
cal care.
In addition, there are disturbing re
ports of war crimes in Jenin and Nablus,

with mass graves and people buried in
the rubble alive.
A U.N. envoy has said that the devas
tation left by Israelis in a Palestinian
refugee camp in the West Bank is "hor
rific beyond belief."
"I think I can speak for all in the U.N.
delegation in saying that we are
shocked," said Ter je Roed-Larsen of the
U.N. delegation.
As former President Jimmy Carter
said in letter to The New York Times,
"Ariel Sharon is a strong and forceful
man and has never equivocated in his
public declarations nor deviated from
his ultimate purpose.
"I lis rejection of all peace agreements
that included Israeli withdrawal from
Arab lands, his invasion of Lebanon, his
provocative visit to the Temple Mount,
the destruction of villages and homes,
the arrests of thousands of Palestinians
and his open defiance of President
George W. Bush's demand that he com
ply with international law have all been
orchestrated to accomplish his ultimate
goals: to establish Israeli settlements as
widely as possible throughout occupied
territories and to deny Palestinians a co
hesive political existence."
The truth of the matter is that Israel
has been occupying the West Bank since
1967 in violation of U.N. resolutions 242
and 338.
The fact that Israeli settlements are
still being built in the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip is a violation of U.N. resolu
tions 446, 452 and 465.
These are some of the tragic stories of
Israel's founding, and they deserve to be
told.
And that was the point of our rally.

Need-blind admissions must be
extended to international students
I agree with yesterday's editorial that
Stanford should extend its need-blind ad
missions policy to international students as
soon as possible. I consider it imperative
that the University does so since Stanford
often claims in its promotional literature to
be a need-blind institution that does not dis
criminate against students on the basis of
national and ethnic origin in the adminis
tration of its admissions policies.
As a Mexican undergraduate at Stan
ford, I have questioned former and cur
rent University administrators about this
issue and the feasibility of extending need
blind admissions to international students.
It gives me hope that Dean of Admissions
and Financial Aid Robin Mamlet vocally
supports this policy in principle. I must
commend her for making a commitment to
the International Undergraduate Commu
nity to—finally—waive the $70 undergrad
uate application-processing fee to needy in
ternational applicants as of next year.
But I am disheartened that the Uni
versity has yet to declare it an objective to
become a truly need-blind institution, es
pecially when there's an on-going billion
dollar campaign to enhance undergrad
uate education dedicating 30 percent of
its goal to endowed scholarships.
Just as you encourage the University
to extend its need-blind admissions to in
ternational students, I encourage the
student body to voice its support of this
policy to administrators. I believe that
such pressure is the needed catalyst to
promptly make a Stanford education ac
cessible to the best and the brightest in
the world, not just the richest.
