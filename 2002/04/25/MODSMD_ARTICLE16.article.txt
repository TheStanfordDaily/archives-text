# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Turkish Students Association responds to Armenian genocide 
### TURKISH STUDENT ASSOCIATION GUEST COLUMNISTS 
Modern Turkey is a country of diverse
religions, languages, cultural and ethnic
backgrounds. As a developing nation,
Turkey tries to provide the best for its cit
izens with respect to economic prosperity
and rights.
Currently, about 100,000 Armenians
live in Turkey along with other minorities
such as Greeks and Jews. The rest of the
Turkish population is made of 39 differ
ent ethnicities, 29 different languages, at
least 10 different religions united by the
motherland "Turkey" and our common
language "Turkish."
Most of us who grew up in Turkey had
Armenian neighbors, friends and teachers.

We grew up watching movies and listening
to singers of Armenian origin. We loved
them equally, as we loved others.
However, in the United States, the at
titude we have been exposed to by the
diaspora Armenians was quite odd and
unfriendly. Allegedly, we had killed
their grandfathers.
It deeply saddens us to see allegations
of the diaspora Armenians, targeting the
integrity and pure feelings of the Turkish
nation, discrediting the cultural and his
torical ties and exemplary peace and love
that grew out of cohabiting the same
motherland for more than 1,000 years.
The answer is both emotional and po
litical. Many Armenians feel in their
hearts that Turks were guilty. They have
only heard of the deaths of their ances
tors, not the deaths of Turks. They have

been told only a small part of a compli
cated story for so long that they believe it
to be the unquestionable truth. Their
anger is understandable. The beliefs of
those in Europe and America who have
never heard the truth—which sadly is
the majority—are also understandable.
It is the actions of those who use the
claim of genocide for nationalist political
motives that are inexcusable.
The Armenian genocide propaganda is
a set of fabricated urban legends. Most of
the arguments put forth in the videos, ar
ticles, letters and diaries that they present
with the accusations are hyperlinked to
each other and ultimately hyperlinked to
no historical or scientific truth.
Still, though, the same propaganda
has been used over and over again by the
diaspora Armenians as an investment in

the future to influence the Westerners'
availability and recency biases.
Most sadly, this propaganda has re
sulted in hate crimes in Europe and in
the United States. Turkey still mourns
for the 60 diplomats and their families
killed by Armenian extremists between
1973 and 1984 throughout the world, in
cluding some in Los Angeles.
We also believe that Armenian genocide
allegations hurt the Armenian minority in
Turkey by causing resentment among the
other Turkish nationals, and hurts the rela
tions between Armenia and its surrounding
neighbors, Turkey and Azerbaijan.
The growing friendship between these
countries has halted because of the Arme
nian invasion of Nagarno-Karabakh and
the expulsion of 1.5 million Azeris from
their homes by the Armenians.

False allegations will not help the
prosperity of Armenians who live in Ar
menia. We believe that the best the Ar
menian diaspora could do would be to
help Armenia correct its recent human
rights violations in Nagarno-Karabakh
against the Azeris and let the 1.5 million
Azeris return home.
Diaspora Armenians should try to
match the level of sincerity that already
exists among the Turks and Armenians
in Turkey today. These ac t ions would be
for the peace and happiness of everyone
and for the well-being of the generations
to come.

piece authored by Chris Guzelian, which ap
peared in yesterday's Daily. It can be accessed
