The company reports
largest loss ever
fora U.S. company
AOL Time Warner Inc., the
world's largest media company,
reported a first-quarter loss of
$54.24 billion yesterday — he
biggest quarterly loss ever fora
U.S. company —because of new
accounting rules.
Previously, the biggest quarter
ly loss was $41.8 billion, reported
by the telecommunications com
pany JDS Uniphase in its first
quarter of 2001.
AOL Time Warner's loss was en
tirely due to a writedown equired

by a sharp decline in its stock, which
has fallen by more than half since
the merger of America Online and
Time Warner was announced in
January 2000.
In the same period a year ago,
AOL Time Warner had a net loss of
$1.4 billion.
The new accounting rules wqre
issued by the Financial Account
ing Standards Board, which gov
erns the industry, and took effect
in January.
Under the new rules,
goodwill — the difference be
tween the value of a company's as
sets and the higher amount paid
by an acquiring company — can
no longer be written off gradually
over a period of up to 40 years.

Instead, companies must con
stantly weigh the value of their in
vestment in the acquired company
and write off any reduction in
value as it occurs.
Without die effect of the account
ing change and other one time ef
fects, AOL Time Warner's results
beat analysts' expectations. Earnings
per share rose to 18 cents a share; an
alysts were expecting 14 cents.
The results were announced
after the New York Stock Exchange
had closed. During yesterday's
trading, AOL stock rose 19 cents to
close at $19.30. It rose 72 cents in
after-hours trading.
Revenue rose 7 percent to $9.76
billion compared with $9.12 billion
in the same period a year ago.
