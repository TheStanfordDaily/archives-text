## Stanford preps for final push 
### JERRY LU STAFF WRITER 
Through all the amazing
wins and the few disappointing
losses, the men's tennis team
know that a major indicator of
the success of the season come s
in the postseason, Stanford's
traditional stomping grounds
of success. This weekend, the
team get a chance to test them
selves in the comfortable con
fines of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence before stepping onto the
national stage at the NCAA
Championships.
Stanford (19-5, 5-2 Pac-10)
will be participating in the annu
al Pac-10 Individual Champi
onships, which will be held from
April 25 to April 29 in Ojai,
Calif.
The Cardinal heads into the
tournament without senior K.j.
Hippensteel, who has not played
since facing Arizona in a match
on April 13. Hippensteel is still
out with an injured back and is
taking time to recuperate.
Despite not playing last week,
Hippensteel still managed to rise
two spots in the national rank
ings to No. 2.
The Pac-10 Individuals are
actually two tournaments in
one. Schools are allowed to
enter four singles players and
two doubles teams into each of
two brackets. The competition is
divided into the "Champi
onship" and "Invitational" sec
tions, each with 32 singles and
16 doubles slots. Due to Hip

pensteel's injury, Stanford is
only entering seven singles and
three doubles teams in the en
tire event.
The Cardinal will be repre
sented by four singles players and
two doubles teams in the Champi
onship bracket. Anchoring the
Stanford squad will be juniors
David Martin, Scott Lipsky and
Ryan Haviland, who will play sin
gles along with Sam Warburg.
The second-ranked duo of
Lipsky and Martin will be
joined by the freshman tandem
of Phil Sheng and Warburg,
who have posted a 15-9 record
this year.
In the Pac-1() Invitational
bracket, Stanford will be repre
sented by Sheng, sophomore Joe
Kao and senior Chris Meyer. Kao
and Meyer will also be playing

doubles for the Cardinal.
In national team rankings,
Stanford has dropped from 4th
to Bth place after last week's close
losses to Pepperdine, UCLA and
Southern California. Georgia,
the pre-season favorite, retains
its No. 1 spot, followed by UCLA,
Illinois, Tennessee, and Pepper
dine. Pac-10 rival California is
currently at No. 10, while USC
has moved up two spots to its No.
11 ranking.
Stanford has traditionally
done very well at the Pac-10 In
dividuals. Since the current post
season format was adopted in
1987, Stanford has captured
seven of 15 doubles champi
onships, including four of the
last six and eight of 15 singles
championships
Last year, Hippensteel and se

nior Alex Kim bagged the dou
bles trophy against Arizona
State's Oliver Charrion and Pim
Van Mele.
Hippensteel almost walked
away with the singles trophy but
was edged out by USC's Ryan
Moore, who had defeated Kim,
the defending national champi
on, earlier in the quarterfinals.
In last year's Pac-10 Invita
tional bracket, Lipsky and Mar
tin defeated UCLA's Tobias
Clemens and Lassi Ketola for the
doubles title, while Lipsky went
to defeat fellow Cardinal Ali
Ansari for the singles crown.
The only other schools to
have won titles at the Pac-10 In
dividuals have been USC, with
four singles and three doubles
titles, and UCLA, with four in
each category.
