# Lastra and Kalvaria take advantage of a chance pairing
## Dynamic Duo 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Seniors Lauren Kalvaria and
Gabriela Lastra, the No. 1
women's tennis doubles team in
the nation, have led defending
NCAA champion No. 1 Stanford
to a 22-1 mark this year and have

posted a 24-2 record as a tandem.
For Kalvaria and Lastra, the
road to this year's national cham
pionship began six years ago with
a "why not?" proposition.
"There's a big national tour
nament called the Easter Bowl,
and neither Lauren nor 1 had
doubles partners, so we just de

cided to play together," Lastra
said. "We were 15 or 16 and
everyone was paired off and we'd
both heard of each other. Sur
prisingly enough, we ended up
winning the tournament."
What began as a last-minute
pickup team was already on its
way to becoming much more.
"Wejust decided to stay togeth
er after that," Kalvaria said.
The duo did not let the distance
between them — Kalvaria is from
Florida, Lastra from Nevada— in
terfere with their partnership.
"We would just meet up at
tournaments and play together,"
Kalvaria said.
From the beginning, it was
clear to both players that their
skills complemented each other.
"Lauren was always the one
with the ground strokes and
would just bang from the baseline,
while I was more of the finesse
player at the net," Lastra said.
Kalvaria and Lastra also found
that they helped each other out on
the court psychologically.
"I'm more of a laid-back per
son, whereas Lauren is more in
tense," Lastra said. "She's helped
me to be more vocal on the court."
"Gabby's got a very laid back
mentality and that's important to
have, to be even-keeled," added
Kalvaria. "I've learned that from
her."
While they rolled to more victo
ries on the high school circuit,
Kalvaria and Lastra found that
they complemented each other
well off the court, too.
"Gabby's kind of goofy, and
we're very different people, and
that works pretty well," Kalvaria
said. "I'm more serious."
Added Lastra, "We're just kind
of opposites."
The two bonded by traveling
together around the globe to play
in tournaments.
"We traveled together to Italy,

Seniors Gabriela Lastra and Lauren Kalvaria, currently ranked as the No. 1
doubles team in the nation, have been playing together since circumstance
paired them in an amateur tournament in high school.
Brazil, Paraguay, Australia and
Belgium," Kalvaria said, trying
to recalling all their exotic desti
nations.
As Kalvaria and Lastra wound
up their high school careers,
they each faced the question of
which university to attend. Stan
ford admitted four players that
year: Lastra, Kalvaria, senior
Keiko Tokuda, and Marissa
Irvin, who now plays on the pro
fessional tour.
"Me, Keiko, and Marissa all
gave Lauren a call to try and per
suade her to come here," Lastra
said.
Kalvaria, deliberating between
Stanford and Florida, chose Stan
ford.
"Gabby signed before I did and
once Gabby signed, it was definite
ly an incentive to come to Stan
ford," Kalvaria said.
From the beginning, the pair
was glad they'd both chosen the
Farm.
"Coming into Stanford and not
knowing anyone can be tough,
but having kind of a ready-made
friend was important to me,"
Kalvaria said.
At Stanford, the two honed
their individual games as well as
their doubles skills. Besides form
ing the country's top tandem,
Kalvaria is ranked No. 4 in singles,
while Lastra is ranked No. 10.
On the doubles court, no one
can match their ability and team
work.
"We're a very versatile team as
compared to other teams," Lastra
said.
Explained Kalvaria, "We
know what shot we should take
and what shot our partner can
reach, so it's just a very natural
thing."
Even today, the approach that
got them through their first tour
nament comes in handy.
"Gabby has always been a

very good volleyer with good
hands," Kalvaria said. "I would
set up the point for Gabby to at
tack at the net. That's pretty
much what we do now, only with
more accuracy."
As they improved their chem
istry on the courts, Kalvaria and
Lastra also became closer off the
courts as college progressed They
now room together.
"We've definitely become very
close friends," Lastra said. "With
Keiko also, we've formed a special
bond. We're pretty tight."
Added Kalvaria, "Cabby's defi-
my best friend. She's kind of
a sister to me. We light and we
laugh and we can talk about
things."
Their friendship is especially
tight because it has withstood
challenges on and off the courts.
"You have your other friends
at Stanford, but they can't really
understand what you go through
[on the courts]," Lastra said. "It's
great to have someone who does
the exact same thing; they can
help you out the most."
The Cardinal's season is wind
ing down, as are Kalvaria's and
Lastra's collegiate careers. This
weekend the team competes in
the Pac-10 Individuals in Ojai,
Calif., and the NCAA champi
onships start on May 10. Kalvaria
and Tokuda are taking the week
end off to rest for their final run at
NCAAs.
For most college teammates
and friends, graduation is an end
of things. Not so for Kalvaria and
Lastra, who both plan to play pro
fessional tennis.
"We're going to coordinate our
schedules and play some doubles
together," Kalvaria said. "We're
still going to see each other."
Sometimes, the duo can't be
lieve how far they've come to
gether, as teammates and as
friends.
"Every now and then we'll be
like, 'I can't believe how we started
off playing together,"' Lastra said.
"I guess it was just meant to be, it
was fate for us to play together."
