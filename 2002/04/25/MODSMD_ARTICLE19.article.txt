# Lastra and Kalvaria take advantage of a chance pairing
## Dynamic Duo 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Seniors Lauren Kalvaria and
Gabriela Lastra, the No. 1
women's tennis doubles team in
the nation, have led defending
NCAA champion No. 1 Stanford
to a 22-1 mark this year and have

posted a 24-2 record as a tandem.
For Kalvaria and Lastra, the
road to this year's national cham
pionship began six years ago with
a "why not?" proposition.
"There's a big national tour
nament called the Easter Bowl,
and neither Lauren nor 1 had
doubles partners, so we just de

cided to play together," Lastra
said. "We were 15 or 16 and
everyone was paired off and we'd
both heard of each other. Sur
prisingly enough, we ended up
winning the tournament."
What began as a last-minute
pickup team was already on its
way to becoming much more.
"Wejust decided to stay togeth
er after that," Kalvaria said.
The duo did not let the distance
between them — Kalvaria is from
Florida, Lastra from Nevada— in
terfere with their partnership.
"We would just meet up at
tournaments and play together,"
Kalvaria said.
From the beginning, it was
clear to both players that their
skills complemented each other.
"Lauren was always the one
with the ground strokes and
would just bang from the baseline,
while I was more of the finesse
player at the net," Lastra said.
Kalvaria and Lastra also found
that they helped each other out on
the court psychologically.
"I'm more of a laid-back per
son, whereas Lauren is more in
tense," Lastra said. "She's helped
me to be more vocal on the court."
"Gabby's got a very laid back
mentality and that's important to
have, to be even-keeled," added
Kalvaria. "I've learned that from
her."
While they rolled to more victo
ries on the high school circuit,
Kalvaria and Lastra found that
they complemented each other
well off the court, too.
"Gabby's kind of goofy, and
we're very different people, and
that works pretty well," Kalvaria
said. "I'm more serious."
Added Lastra, "We're just kind
of opposites."
The two bonded by traveling
together around the globe to play
in tournaments.
"We traveled together to Italy,
