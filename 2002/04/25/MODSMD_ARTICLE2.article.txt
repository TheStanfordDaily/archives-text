# Director shows film on schools

Actress Elisabeth Shue presented the
documentary film "The First Year" last
night at Cubberley Auditorium. The film
was created and directed by Shue's hus
band, filmmaker Davis Guggenheim,
and follows five teachers through the Los
Angeles public high school system.
Guggenheim told the audience that
he was inspired to create the film when
he and Shue began thinking about the
future education of their son, now four
years old. "What can I, as a citizen, do
about it?" he asked, referring to the un
fortunate state of the public schools
near his Los Angeles home.
Although education reform has re
cently been the source of much contro
versy, Guggenheim intended for the
film to remain apolitical, concentrating
more on "the journey of five teachers."
Guggenheim said that the biggest
problem in the public school system
today is that the "house is burning
down, and people are debating how
high to clip the hedge."
The film tackled the national de
bate about education by focusing on
its most fundamental aspect: the rela
tionship between teachers and stu
dents. For 110 days, Guggenheim fol
lowed five public school teachers with
a tiny digital camera, recording their
trials and triumphs.
One subject, George, teaches English

as a second language to high school stu
dents. When the school board plans to
cut funding for her class, she encourages
her students to write letters and speak be
fore the board. Ultimately, she is able to
retain her funding.
Joy is less successful in her endeavor
to obtain her own classroom. The
school district will not recognize that a
lack of classroom space exists until one
third of the teachers have no class
rooms of their own. She also struggles
to create a more tolerant environment,
especially for homosexual students,

who she feels are subject to the most
discrimination.
Nate, a fifth-grade teacher, fears he
will lose Juan to the gangs. Despite
Juan's difficult family situation, having
no mother, an unemployed father, and
nine siblings, Nate describes him as a
"beautiful boy" who needs to recognize
his own worth. Although initially re
buked, Nate gains Juan's trust by tak
ing him fishing and driving on the
weekends.
