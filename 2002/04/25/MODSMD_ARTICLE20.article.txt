# Women's volleyball says aloha to season
## 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Off-season exhibition matches
rarely draw much attention in any
college sport and they certainly
don't attract big crowds very often.
But when the Stanford women's
volleyball team takes the court at
the Stan Sheriff Center in Honolu
lu tomorrow to take on Hawaii, the
arena will likely have the feel of an
important mid-season contest.
The defending national cham
pion Cardinal kicks off its spring
exhibition schedule against the
Wahine, who averaged over 6,500
fans per home match this past fall
and expect a comparably sized
crowd tomorrow.
In the fall, Stanford will take a
break from its Pacific 10 Conference
schedule to return to Hawaii for
what could be an' important late-sea
son non-conference match against
the Wahine on Nov. 10. Though
that match is over five months away,
it will certainly be on everyone's
mind during this weekend's trip.
"We thought it would be intel
ligent to schedule something in
the spring that the players would
really look forward to and that
could motivate them," said head
coach John Dunning, who guid
ed the Cardinal to a national
championship in his first season
on the Farm. With back-to-back
championships at Pacific his first
two seasons at the school in 1985
and 1986, Dunning is the only
coach to win NCAA titles at two
different schools.
"Hawaii is going to be one of
the best team's in the country
next year, so it'll be exciting," he
said. "It probably sets the stage
[for the Nov. 10 match] in the
players' minds. I'm sure it does in
the fans' minds."
The contest is being billed as a

matchup between arguably the top
four returning outside hitters in
the nation: Logan Tom and
Ogonna Nnamani of Stanford and
Kim Willoughby and Lily
Kahumoku of Hawaii.
Tom racked up just about every
national honor during her junior
year in 2001, including her third
straight first-team All-American se
lection and the National Player of
the Year Award.
Nnamani had a breakout season
during her freshman year on the
Farm, earning National Freshman
of the Year honors and a second
team All-American nod.
Together, Nnamani and Tom
provided the Cardinal with the
most lethal pair of left-side hitters
in the country, combining for 8.98
kills per game and accounting for
over half of Stanford's total kills.
Tom and Nnamani's numbers
are impressive, but 7.20 kills per
game is an even more impressive
figure. That was the nation-lead
ing average output of Hawaii's
sophomore phenom Willoughby
in the 2001 campaign, putting her
almost a whole kill per game
ahead of second-place Jennifer
Wittenburg of Houston.
Willoughby nearly single-hand
edly led the Wahine to the Western
Athletic Conference champi
onship, the NCAA Regional semifi
nals and a No. 13 final ranking.
Kahumoku returns to Hawaii
after skipping the fall season for
personal reasons. She was a
first-team All-American during
her sophomore season in 2000,
and her return gives the
Wahine a left-side combination
of hitters that could easily rival
Tom and Nnamani.
Despite winning its record fifth
NCAA tide in the fall, Stanford faces
an uphill batde entering tomorrow's
match — if for no other reason than
on account of sheer numbers.
With no seniors on its roster in
2001, Hawaii returns its entire
team from last season.
Stanford, however, has to com
pensate for the loss of five seniors
from its championship squad and
will have only 10 players available
tomorrow.
"We've been practicing hard
on passing and defense this
spring since that's what we lost
the most of with the graduating
seniors," said sophomore reserve
Sara Dukes, who could see time at
middle blocker and outside hit
ter. "Everyone's testing out new
positions and playing roles they
haven't played before."
In fact, the focus of the Cardi
nal's spring season will be to figure
out how to fill in the gaps left by its
graduating players — setter Robyn
Lewis, middle blocker Tara Con
rad and defensive specialists
Michelle Chambers, Sara Sandrik
and Emily Lawrence.
The setter and middle blocker
situations, at least, have fairly obvi
ous solutions.
Sophomore setter Anna Robin
son split time with Lewis early in the
2001 season, starting in six matches
and appearing in 16 of Stanford's
35 contests. But after watching
Lewis run the offense in the latter
parts of the regular season and
throughout the Cardinal's champi
onship run in the NCAA tourna
ment, Robinson is ready to take
over as the team's primary setter.
"I'm having to work as hard as I
can to improve on my hands and
my dynamic with the team," Robin
son said. "There's been a lot of
team focus, even more than last
year. We're trying to get the chem
istry going early on for next year."
Sophomore middle blocker
Jenn Harvey also saw a great deal
of playing time early in the fall be

fore losing her spot to fellow sopho
more Sara McGee. McGee ended
up leading the Pac-10 in blocking
and earning a spot on the All-Con
ference team.
Harvey will join McGee as the
Cardinal's primary middle block
ers for the spring, and both will
look to establish their roles in the
lineup before the much-heralded
arrival of incoming freshman
middle blocker Courtney Schultz
in the fall.
However, the situation in the
backcourt is a little less settled.
ITiroughout the fall, Dunning reg
ularly replaced McGee, Conrad
and Nnamani in the back row with
his senior defensive specialists, who
provided more consistency in the
back row.
The NCAA's introduction of the
libero position for next season will
solve some of the Cardinal's prob
lems. The libero is a freely-substi
tuting back row player that cannot
serve, attack or set inside the three
meter line.
But the Cardinal is also going to
need its younger players to step up
their play in the back row.
Freshman defensive specialist
Leahi Hall could be thrust into the
spotlight after only appearing in six
games last season. Stanford may
also turn to sophomore defensive
specialist Jamie Browneli, who re
turned to the Cardinal this spring
after taking the fall season off.
"I think all of us are working to
make up for the seniors who did
such a great job in the back row,"
Hall said. "The back row is improv
ing, and the girls who hit up front
are playing well in the back too."
Dunning has also been work
ing on getting more of his front
row players comfortable in the
backcourt.
Tom and starting right-side hit
ter junior Ashley Ivy led the Cardi
nal in digs last season, and getting
Nnamani and the other outside hit
ters to that level of defensive play
could make Stanford as dangerous
in the backcourt as it is up front.
" I'm happy with what we're doing
at this point," Dunning said. "We're

working on the ball control level of
the whole team and the real basics of
passing and digging. We're already
laying a foundation for the fell."
The Cardinal will continue its

spring schedule on May 4 with
matches at Santa Clara. The team
will wrap up its spring competition
with a day of matches at California
on May 10.

the Stan Sheriff Center in Honolu
lu tomorrow to take on Hawaii, the
arena will likely have the feel of an
important mid-season contest.
The defending national cham
pion Cardinal kicks off its spring
exhibition schedule against the
Wahine, who averaged over 6,500
fans per home match this past fall
and expect a comparably sized
crowd tomorrow.
In the fall, Stanford will take a
break from its Pacific 10 Conference
schedule to return to Hawaii for
what could be an' important late-sea
son non-conference match against
the Wahine on Nov. 10. Though
that match is over five months away,
it will certainly be on everyone's
mind during this weekend's trip.
"We thought it would be intel
ligent to schedule something in
the spring that the players would
really look forward to and that
could motivate them," said head
coach John Dunning, who guid
ed the Cardinal to a national
championship in his first season
on the Farm. With back-to-back
championships at Pacific his first
two seasons at the school in 1985
and 1986, Dunning is the only
coach to win NCAA titles at two
different schools.
"Hawaii is going to be one of
the best team's in the country
next year, so it'll be exciting," he
said. "It probably sets the stage
[for the Nov. 10 match] in the
players' minds. I'm sure it does in
the fans' minds."
The contest is being billed as a

matchup between arguably the top
four returning outside hitters in
the nation: Logan Tom and
Ogonna Nnamani of Stanford and
Kim Willoughby and Lily
Kahumoku of Hawaii.
Tom racked up just about every
national honor during her junior
year in 2001, including her third
straight first-team All-American se
lection and the National Player of
the Year Award.
Nnamani had a breakout season
during her freshman year on the
Farm, earning National Freshman
of the Year honors and a second
team All-American nod.
Together, Nnamani and Tom
provided the Cardinal with the
most lethal pair of left-side hitters
in the country, combining for 8.98
kills per game and accounting for
over half of Stanford's total kills.
Tom and Nnamani's numbers
are impressive, but 7.20 kills per
game is an even more impressive
figure. That was the nation-lead
ing average output of Hawaii's
sophomore phenom Willoughby
in the 2001 campaign, putting her
almost a whole kill per game
ahead of second-place Jennifer
Wittenburg of Houston.
Willoughby nearly single-hand
edly led the Wahine to the Western
Athletic Conference champi
onship, the NCAA Regional semifi
nals and a No. 13 final ranking.
Kahumoku returns to Hawaii
after skipping the fall season for
personal reasons. She was a
first-team All-American during
her sophomore season in 2000,
and her return gives the
Wahine a left-side combination
of hitters that could easily rival
Tom and Nnamani.
Despite winning its record fifth
NCAA tide in the fall, Stanford faces
an uphill batde entering tomorrow's
match — if for no other reason than
on account of sheer numbers.
With no seniors on its roster in
2001, Hawaii returns its entire
team from last season.
Stanford, however, has to com
pensate for the loss of five seniors
from its championship squad and
will have only 10 players available
tomorrow.
"We've been practicing hard
on passing and defense this
spring since that's what we lost
the most of with the graduating
seniors," said sophomore reserve
Sara Dukes, who could see time at
middle blocker and outside hit
ter. "Everyone's testing out new
positions and playing roles they
haven't played before."
In fact, the focus of the Cardi
nal's spring season will be to figure
out how to fill in the gaps left by its
graduating players — setter Robyn
Lewis, middle blocker Tara Con
rad and defensive specialists
Michelle Chambers, Sara Sandrik
and Emily Lawrence.
The setter and middle blocker
situations, at least, have fairly obvi
ous solutions.
Sophomore setter Anna Robin
son split time with Lewis early in the
2001 season, starting in six matches
and appearing in 16 of Stanford's
35 contests. But after watching
Lewis run the offense in the latter
parts of the regular season and
throughout the Cardinal's champi
onship run in the NCAA tourna
ment, Robinson is ready to take
over as the team's primary setter.
"I'm having to work as hard as I
can to improve on my hands and
my dynamic with the team," Robin
son said. "There's been a lot of
team focus, even more than last
year. We're trying to get the chem
istry going early on for next year."
Sophomore middle blocker
Jenn Harvey also saw a great deal
of playing time early in the fall be

fore losing her spot to fellow sopho
more Sara McGee. McGee ended
up leading the Pac-10 in blocking
and earning a spot on the All-Con
ference team.
Harvey will join McGee as the
Cardinal's primary middle block
ers for the spring, and both will
look to establish their roles in the
lineup before the much-heralded
arrival of incoming freshman
middle blocker Courtney Schultz
in the fall.
However, the situation in the
backcourt is a little less settled.
ITiroughout the fall, Dunning reg
ularly replaced McGee, Conrad
and Nnamani in the back row with
his senior defensive specialists, who
provided more consistency in the
back row.
The NCAA's introduction of the
libero position for next season will
solve some of the Cardinal's prob
lems. The libero is a freely-substi
tuting back row player that cannot
serve, attack or set inside the three
meter line.
But the Cardinal is also going to
need its younger players to step up
their play in the back row.
Freshman defensive specialist
Leahi Hall could be thrust into the
spotlight after only appearing in six
games last season. Stanford may
also turn to sophomore defensive
specialist Jamie Browneli, who re
turned to the Cardinal this spring
after taking the fall season off.
"I think all of us are working to
make up for the seniors who did
such a great job in the back row,"
Hall said. "The back row is improv
ing, and the girls who hit up front
are playing well in the back too."
Dunning has also been work
ing on getting more of his front
row players comfortable in the
backcourt.
Tom and starting right-side hit
ter junior Ashley Ivy led the Cardi
nal in digs last season, and getting
Nnamani and the other outside hit
ters to that level of defensive play
could make Stanford as dangerous
in the backcourt as it is up front.
" I'm happy with what we're doing
at this point," Dunning said. "We're

working on the ball control level of
the whole team and the real basics of
passing and digging. We're already
laying a foundation for the fell."
The Cardinal will continue its

spring schedule on May 4 with
matches at Santa Clara. The team
will wrap up its spring competition
with a day of matches at California
on May 10.
