# Women's volleyball says aloha to season

### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Off-season exhibition matches
rarely draw much attention in any
college sport and they certainly
don't attract big crowds very often.
But when the Stanford women's
volleyball team takes the court at
the Stan Sheriff Center in Honolu
lu tomorrow to take on Hawaii, the
arena will likely have the feel of an
important mid-season contest.
The defending national cham
pion Cardinal kicks off its spring
exhibition schedule against the
Wahine, who averaged over 6,500
fans per home match this past fall
and expect a comparably sized
crowd tomorrow.
In the fall, Stanford will take a
break from its Pacific 10 Conference
schedule to return to Hawaii for
what could be an' important late-sea
son non-conference match against
the Wahine on Nov. 10. Though
that match is over five months away,
it will certainly be on everyone's
mind during this weekend's trip.
"We thought it would be intel
ligent to schedule something in
the spring that the players would
really look forward to and that
could motivate them," said head
coach John Dunning, who guid
ed the Cardinal to a national
championship in his first season
on the Farm. With back-to-back
championships at Pacific his first
two seasons at the school in 1985
and 1986, Dunning is the only
coach to win NCAA titles at two
different schools.
"Hawaii is going to be one of
the best team's in the country
next year, so it'll be exciting," he
said. "It probably sets the stage
[for the Nov. 10 match] in the
players' minds. I'm sure it does in
the fans' minds."
The contest is being billed as a

matchup between arguably the top
four returning outside hitters in
the nation: Logan Tom and
Ogonna Nnamani of Stanford and
Kim Willoughby and Lily
Kahumoku of Hawaii.
Tom racked up just about every
national honor during her junior
year in 2001, including her third
straight first-team All-American se
lection and the National Player of
the Year Award.
Nnamani had a breakout season
during her freshman year on the
Farm, earning National Freshman
of the Year honors and a second
team All-American nod.
Together, Nnamani and Tom
provided the Cardinal with the
most lethal pair of left-side hitters
in the country, combining for 8.98
kills per game and accounting for
over half of Stanford's total kills.
Tom and Nnamani's numbers
are impressive, but 7.20 kills per
game is an even more impressive
figure. That was the nation-lead
ing average output of Hawaii's
sophomore phenom Willoughby
in the 2001 campaign, putting her
almost a whole kill per game
ahead of second-place Jennifer
Wittenburg of Houston.
Willoughby nearly single-hand
edly led the Wahine to the Western
Athletic Conference champi
onship, the NCAA Regional semifi
nals and a No. 13 final ranking.
Kahumoku returns to Hawaii
after skipping the fall season for
personal reasons. She was a
first-team All-American during
her sophomore season in 2000,
and her return gives the
Wahine a left-side combination
of hitters that could easily rival
Tom and Nnamani.
Despite winning its record fifth
NCAA tide in the fall, Stanford faces
