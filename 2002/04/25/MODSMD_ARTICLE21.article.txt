# Men's golf tees off at Pac-10s
## 
### MATT BABIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Most Stanford students see
Thursday as a signal of the end of
the week — assignments due,
problem sets turned in and par
ties to go to. For the Stanford
men's golf team, however, this
Thursday is more of a beginning,
it takes the course today for the
first two rounds of the 43rd an
nual Pacific 10 Conference Men's
Golf Championships at Trysting
Tree Golf Course (Par 72, 7,022
yards) in Corvallis, Ore.
The Pac-10 Championships
present the Cardinal squad with
its last chance to impress the
NCAA selection committee and
secure a bid to the NCAA Region
al Championships, to be held
May 16 through May 18 in New
Mexico.
Stanford dramatically im
proved its chances fora longer
season last weekend, when it rode
the coattails of senior Phil Rowe's
individual title to a second-place
team finish at the U.S. Intercolle
giate. Coming in second only to
Southern California, and ahead
of many competitive conference
foes, the team goes to Oregon
with a newfound confidence.
Fhe other golfers at Trysting
Tree present a formidable chal
lenge. As always, the Pac-10 field
is exceedingly tough. Seven con
ference teams are ranked in the
top 50, and every team in the
conference is ranked in the top
100. USC is still the team to catch,
leading the way with a No. 9 na
tional ranking. Going into play
this weekend, the Cardinal is
ranked No. 61.
However, Stanford has some
recent practice upsetting rank
ings, as the team score last week
end placed the Cardinal ahead of
Washington State (No. 28), Ore
gon (No. 33) and (No. 47).
In what looks to be a tight
pack, the Cardinal will need
more than another low score
from Rowe to succeed. If junior

Jim Seki can play through the
back pain that has plagued him
recently and junior Ron Won and
sophomore Blake Mastalir can
carry their good scores from last
week's tournament up to Ore
gon, things could fall into place
for the Cardinal.
The tournament begins with
two rounds today, followed by
one round Friday and one on
Saturday.
The Cardinal looks to improve
from last year, when it finished
6th, while USC hopes to defend
last season's title. Both schools

will find a much more hospitable
course this year, as the rough has
been trimmed from the three
foot length it had for last year's
NCAA West Regional to a man
ageable four inches.
No matter the length, the Car
dinal will need to avoid the rough
as much as possible. Each player
is fully aware that every stroke
counts, not only towards their
place this weekend and their con
ference finish, but also and more
importantly toward whether
there is more golf to be played
this season.
