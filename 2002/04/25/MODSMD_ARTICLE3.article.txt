# Sophomore College to implement board fee
## 
### VAUHINI VARA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Sophomore College administrators re
cently announced two important changes to
the program. Next year, sophomores must
pay a $400 board fee to participate in the
program — in the past, the program was
free to all students. Also, before applying to
the program, applicants must first meet with
an academic advisor.
The program allows sophomores to take
seminar-style courses with Stanford faculty for
two weeks before fall quarter. Students live in
campus residences and receive two units of
credits for attending morning classes, re
quired field trips and other course activities.
Next year, for the first time, the Fresh
man and Sophomore Programs Office will
impose a $400 board fee for the program,
though tuition, room, books and class-re
quired travel are still covered by the pro
gram. Also, financial aid is available.
"Although Sophomore College has not
previously charged students for participat
ing, it is necessary to ask fora student con
tribution toward the costs of the program
this year in the interest of making the pro
gram sustainable," said Sharon Palmer, di
rector of Sophomore College.
In the past, the program has been fund
ed through a combination of donor gifts and
University funds, Palmer explained. From
now on, though, Palmer and her colleagues
hope to establish "a more permanent finan
cial structure" by raising money for an en
dowment to support the college and by ask
ing students to cover a portion of the cost.
This year, students must also meet with
their academic advisor or another recom

mender, such as a faculty member, to discuss
their application to the program. Advisors
are required to till out a brief form to ac
company the student applications.
"The advisor questionnaire was imple
mented this year in response to faculty re
quests for more information about appli
cants and also in an effort to make sure that
students who apply have an understanding
of the academic goals and expectations of
the program and how it might fit into their
plans for the sophomore year and beyond,"
said Palmer.
Sophomore College course topics next
year will range from Buddhism ("How is a
Buddhist," taught by History Prof. Mark
Mancall) to language ("Understanding Lan
guage," taught by Linguistics Prof. Thomas
Wasow) to the theory of evolution ("Darwin,
Evolution, and Galapagos," taught on the
Galapagos Islands by Human Biology Prof.
William Durham). A few courses, like the
one on evolution, will require an extra fee to
cover travel costs.
"It's a great way to participate in a com
munity of people who are all really excited
about a particular topic, to get to know a fac
ulty member well and to get a jump start on
the sophomore year," said Palmer.
Freshman Dan Fink still plans on apply
ing to the program, despite the board fee.
"I've heard wonderful things about the
program and I hope that the change doesn't
discourage too many students from taking
part in this opportunity," he said. "From
what I've heard, it's more than worth it."
The deadline for applying to Sophomore
College is tomorrow at 5 p.m. More infor
mation can be found on the program's Web
site at soco.stanford.edu.
