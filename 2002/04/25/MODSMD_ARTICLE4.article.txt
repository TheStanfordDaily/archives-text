# Bill Gates to speak at Kresge
## 
### JEFFREY TAM STAFF WRITER 
A full house is expected this af
ternoon at Kresge Auditorium,
where Microsoft chairman Bill
Gates will give a talk on the future
of übiquitous and reliable com
puting. The event will also fea
ture University President John
Hennessy.
According to Elaine Enos, the
director of public events at Stan
ford, Gates' visit came about be
cause of a personal conversation
between he and Hennessy. The
Office of the President and the
ASSU Speakers Bureau are co
sponsoring the talk.
Übiquitous computing is the
concept that in the future, all de
vices, not just computers, will be
connected to wireless computer
networks that will allow people to
improve their everyday lives.
University labs, as well as re
search labs at companies like Mi
crosoft and Hewlett-Packard, have
devoted a great deal of money to
ward achieving this goal.
Despite the fact that the
event was not heavily publicized
until Monday — when tickets

were given away in White Plaza
— all seats were distributed in
20 minutes.
"I was surprised at how quickly
the tickets went and 20 minutes is
a new record," said Bill Falsey, di
rector of the Speakers Bureau.
"But I think the quick distribution
is just indicative of Gates' relevance
to people on this campus."
Within minutes of the ticket
frenzy, at least five e-mails were
posted on the newsgroup su.mar
ket from students wishing to buy
tickets for the talk. One student
offered to sell a ticket to the high
est bidder.
Brad Johanson, a doctoral can
didate in electrical engineering,
has a particular interest in the area
of übiquitous computing. His the
sis, titled "An Application Coordi
nation Infrastructure for Interac
tive Workspaces," is in this area.
"Over the next 10 years, we will
see the continued migration from
the one- to the many-computers
per-person era," Johanson said.
"This is already stin ting to happen
with many people having a [cellu
lar] phone, [personal computer],
laptop and personal data assistant.
As time goes by and touch screens

and computers become cheap, we
will see devices embedded in the
walls in our home and in many of
our applications."
Johanson also said that there
are many challenges to achieving
übiquitous computing, including
figuring out how to allow people to
interact with multiple devices in
the environments and how com
puter engineers will be able to eas
ily write applications that will run
across multiple devices.
"On the commercial side, Mi
crosoft is coming at these changes
from the perspective of single-user
single-device ... [but] the research
side of Microsoft, Microsoft Re
search Labs, has at least one pro
ject, called Easy Living, that is
looking at some of these issues,"
Johanson said.
Johanson explained that Easy
Living looks at how a house
might recognize the house
owner and automatically config
ure devices in the house so that
they are easily and effectively
used together.
But Johanson will most likely
not attend the talk, since he
doesn't have a ticket. "I hadn't
even heard about it,"he said.
