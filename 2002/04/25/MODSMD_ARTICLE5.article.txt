# Senate attempts to resolve tied vote between Schulman, Martin
## Proposed solutions include 16-member Senate, coin toss, run-off vote 
### JOHN HUETTER EDITORIAL STAFF 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate at
tempted to resolve the 825-vote tie be
tween freshman Executive Aides Sarah
Schulman and Ellie Martin for the 15th
and last slot in next year's Senate at its
Tuesday meeting.

"This is kind of hard," Martin said,
"because Sarah and I are good
friends .... Neither wants to be the one
who made it and the other one didn't."
Martin said she'd been involved with
student government for years. She said
that one of her biggest priorities was in
creasing ASSU-student communication,
proposing town hall meetings, among
other plans.
In addition to improving campus trans
portation, Martin said she wanted to imple
ment a recycling program in every dorm.
Schulman, like Martin, has been
heavily involved with the ASSU News

Readership Program. She joined the
ASSU after hearing ASSU officials, in
cluding junior Matt Brewer, ASSU
president, speak about the body during
Orientation.
"1 was inspired by that," she said. "To
see that there are some mechanisms in
place so that students had a voice
was .. . exciting." Schulman later signed
up for the executive aide program.
Schulman's key interests included
consolidating communication between
students, administration and the ASSU.
She also planned to work on cost ofliving
and transportation issues.

" They're both incredibly qualified,"
said Senate Deputy Chair Mike Osofsky.
"I've had the pleasure to work with both
of them." He said Martin and Schulman
stood out among the other candidates
when he interviewed them for the post of
executive aide.
Osofsky proposed a change in Senate
by-laws, which would allow a two-way tie
between 15th place senators to be resolved
by allowing fora 16th senator in such
cases. He said it was "grossly inappropri
ate" for 15 outgoing senators to make such
a decision and"in essence trump 825 stu
dents on this campus."

He said that the ASSU Constitution is
an "archaic document" and that the by
laws (which the constitution supersedes)
actually had more influence on the
ASSU's workings.
The current constitution was ap
proved in 1999 and the by-laws were last
changed in 2001.
Since 16 senators can lead to tied
votes, Osofsky's proposed that the senate
chair would only vote in the case of a tie.
"I feel this to be appropriate," Osofsky
said, "because this is the way we work this
