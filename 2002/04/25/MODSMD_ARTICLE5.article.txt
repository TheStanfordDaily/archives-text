# Senate attempts to resolve tied vote between Schulman, Martin
## Proposed solutions include 16-member Senate, coin toss, run-off vote 
### JOHN HUETTER EDITORIAL STAFF 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate at
tempted to resolve the 825-vote tie be
tween freshman Executive Aides Sarah
Schulman and Ellie Martin for the 15th
and last slot in next year's Senate at its
Tuesday meeting.

"This is kind of hard," Martin said,
"because Sarah and I are good
friends .... Neither wants to be the one
who made it and the other one didn't."
Martin said she'd been involved with
student government for years. She said
that one of her biggest priorities was in
creasing ASSU-student communication,
proposing town hall meetings, among
other plans.
In addition to improving campus trans
portation, Martin said she wanted to imple
ment a recycling program in every dorm.
Schulman, like Martin, has been
heavily involved with the ASSU News

Readership Program. She joined the
ASSU after hearing ASSU officials, in
cluding junior Matt Brewer, ASSU
president, speak about the body during
Orientation.
"1 was inspired by that," she said. "To
see that there are some mechanisms in
place so that students had a voice
was .. . exciting." Schulman later signed
up for the executive aide program.
Schulman's key interests included
consolidating communication between
students, administration and the ASSU.
She also planned to work on cost ofliving
and transportation issues.

" They're both incredibly qualified,"
said Senate Deputy Chair Mike Osofsky.
"I've had the pleasure to work with both
of them." He said Martin and Schulman
stood out among the other candidates
when he interviewed them for the post of
executive aide.
Osofsky proposed a change in Senate
by-laws, which would allow a two-way tie
between 15th place senators to be resolved
by allowing fora 16th senator in such
cases. He said it was "grossly inappropri
ate" for 15 outgoing senators to make such
a decision and"in essence trump 825 stu
dents on this campus."

He said that the ASSU Constitution is
an "archaic document" and that the by
laws (which the constitution supersedes)
actually had more influence on the
ASSU's workings.
The current constitution was ap
proved in 1999 and the by-laws were last
changed in 2001.
Since 16 senators can lead to tied
votes, Osofsky's proposed that the senate
chair would only vote in the case of a tie.
"I feel this to be appropriate," Osofsky
said, "because this is the way we work this
year anyway."
Current Senate Chair Alex
Shvartsman, though a senator,
has barely voted at all this year in
an effort to be impartial. "To be a
good senate chair," Osofsky said,
"you need to be a moderator."
Assoc. Dean of Students Mor
ris Graves said Osofsky's by
laws change is unconstitutional.
The constitution states that the
Senate "shall be composed ofls
members."
"This will require a constitu
tional amendment," Graves said.
"I don't think you can get around
that."
"We were elected by the stu
dent body," said Administration
and Rules Chair Charlene Ng.
"We're supposed to be making
these decisions anyway."
Ng, a senior, asked, "What
would you do if 15 extra people
got the same number of votes
[for the last place slot]?" Osof
sky said that this suggestion was
impractical.

Senator Sandra Liu, a senior,
said that the senate ought to have
the same number of members as
the Graduate Student Council.
Liu offered the suggestion of ran
domly making either Martin or
Schulman an "ex officio"
senator — a member of the Sen
ate who lacks voting privileges.
Schulman was dubious of this
plan. "If anyone can come in and
be voted for the Senate," Schulman
asked, "what's the difference?"
Martin said that though she
liked the idea of a coin toss to de
cide the matter, the students she
talked to did not. Osofsky noted
that picking a candidate random
ly would be a "cop-out."
The question of time was also
raised. Ng said that a runoff be
tween the two — proposed by Sen
ator Sonrisa Lucero — could be
marshaled by next week. However,
she noted, "If you were to do a con
stitutional amendment, it would
take much, much longer." She esti
mated it would take a year.
"There's nothing wrong about
amending the by-laws and work
ing outside the bounds of the con
stitution fora year," Osofsky said.
He said he is prepared to work for

a constitutional amendment.
Lucero challenged this, noting
that for the ASSU to command
power and respect, it has to abide
by its own governing documents.
The decision must be made
soon. According to by-laws, all or
part of an election must be certi
fied at a regular ASSU legislative
meeting between one and five
weeks alter the election, and the
Senate must vote to break the tie.
Another version of the senator
ex officio plan was also discussed,
in which this year's Senate would
direct their successors to replace
Senator-elect Hiro Iwanaga, a ju
nior, who is currently studying
abroad in Japan, with whichever
of Martin or Schulman was cho
sen as Senator ex officio.
Iwanaga was elected to be a
senator with 966 votes. However,
in January, the Senate voted to
issue a document discouraging
future senators from going
abroad, although this was never
incorporated into the by-laws.
Martin urged the Senate to "set
a precedent" for future 15th
place ties. "A lot of people I talked
to were surprised that we didn't
have a precedent," she said.
