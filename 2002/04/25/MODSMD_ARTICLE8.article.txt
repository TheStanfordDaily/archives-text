Ancient human remains
found in hotel parking lot
REDDING, Calif. (AP) — Ancient human remains were
recently unearthed at a hotel construction site here.
Tracy Edwards, tribal chairwoman for the Redding

ican Indians were discovered early last week by crews work
ing on a corner portion of the Hilton Garden Inn parking lot.
Work was immediately halted in that area and archaeol
ogists have been excavating the site to determine if more re
mains are buried there.
The Shasta County coroner's office, the Native American
Heritage Commission and tribal officials were promptly no
tified, Edwards said, adding that fencing has also been in
stalled around the site to protect it.
Authorities are unsure how old the bones are, but Ed
wards said tribal elders will be called upon to determine how
to deal with them.

Woman sentenced to life for
attempt to kill with
poisoned milkshake
REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) — A woman who tried to
kill her husband with a poisoned milkshake was sentenced
to life in prison with the possibility of parole.
Judge Dale Hahn sentenced Elizabeth Fuentes-Ortiz, 32,
after she was convicted in February for feeding her husband
a pesticide-laced chocolate milkshake in 1992, then lleeing
to Mexico with their 2-year-old son.
"It tasted like chocolate, but a little sour, a burning taste,"
Gilbert Ortiz testified during the trial. "It felt funny. It's like
somebody is tearing off your skin from the inside."
Fuentes-Ortiz was found in Mexico and extradited eight
years later.
She admitted giving her former husband the drink,
which left him in a coma for 10 days. His heart, kidneys and
lungs failed. Fuentes-Ortiz said she wanted to incapacitate
him so she could escape, breaking a chain of physical abuse.
She will be eligible for parole in four to seven years, said
defense attorney Joseph O'Sullivan.
