1969
On April 25, 1969, The Daily printed an ar
ticle about a ban on secret research at Stanford.
"In a marathon six-hour meeting yester
day, the Academic Senate approved a sweep
ing ban on secret research at Stanford.
"The new legislation will affect all 12 of
Stanford's classified research programs. Sev
eral contracts at the Applied Electronics Lab,
the target of last week's sit-in, are included.
"Before the Senate's meeting, Dean
Joseph Pettit of the engineering school an
nounced that he had decided to phase out all
classified work in engineering, regardless of
(lie Senate's decision.
"In a letter to President Pitzer, Pettit warns
against enacting 'unworkable and repressive
legislation, together with cumbersome and au
tocratic centralized enforcement procedures.'
"Pettit complains that 'the community
seems unable to assure an adequate mini
mum of protection to faculty offices, person
al files and property, and I have serious
doubts as to the safety of classified docu
ments.' He told Pitzer that 'the Stanford
community is in a crisis of civil government,'
and that his phase-out of secret work was in
tended to 'help free you and the Senate to di
rect your immediate attention to it.'
"Pettit also cites 'the evident loss of faculty
support necessary for the pursuit of this (clas
sified) activity in a university.'
"Pettit's letter was read to the Senate at the
start of yesterday's meeting, according to ob
servers. Then the Senate went ahead to con
sider the new legislation drawn up by the
Committee on Research Policy, chaired by law
professor William F. Baxter. The committee's
version was passed with some changes.
"According to a University spokesman, the
Senate 'unanimously expressed its confi
dence' in Pitzer and Pettit 'to achieve an ef
fective transition' to the new rules."
Bottom Line: Banning secret research is one thing,
but whaf s next, stem cells?
