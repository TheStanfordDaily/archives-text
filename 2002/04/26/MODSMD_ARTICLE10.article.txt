Homeless man to stand trial
in shelter shooting
PALO ALTO (AP) — A judge agreed this week to hear
the case of a homeless man who allegedly killed another man
over a stick of deodorant.
Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Diane North
way ruled Monday there is enough evidence for Ron McK
ean to go to trial for allegedly shooting Joe Carney to death
in a Palo Alto homeless shelter.
Witnesses say Carney complained that McKean had
thrown away his deodorant. They say the men argued about
it, and McKean allegedly grabbed a semiautomatic pistol
and shot Carney.
Prosecutors argue the shooting was premeditated, but
McKean's attorney says his client feared for his life.
McKean is scheduled to be arraigned May 6 on a charge
of murder with a firearm. If convicted, McKean, 48, faces life
in prison.

Central Valley county begins
vanpools for farm workers
HAN FORD, Calif. (AP) — Kings County has launched
the nation's first van-pool program for farm workers.
Officials showed off new white vans Wednesday that
farm workers can lease to drive co-workers to the fields or
packinghouses.
The vans meet new safety regulations required for vehi
cles that transport farm workers.
Commuting safety has been a major topic of concern for
farm workers in recent years after a series of deadly crashes,
including one near Five Points in 1999 that killed 13 tomato
pickers.
Under the $3 million program funded by state and fed
eral money, 48 vans and four buses have been purchased.
The program will initially provide transportation in Kings,
Tulare and Kern counties but will spread to Fresno this sum
mer after funding increases to $5 million.
The program is expected to provide transportation to
100,000 workers.
Drivers who complete a 20-hour class, pass a commercial
license exam and a driving test can rent the vans for about
$750 a month, a fee that covers fuel and maintenance. They
can collect $60 to $70 a month per rider to cover lease costs.
"It's very nice to see that farm-labor deaths are no longer
going to be accepted as a part of doing business," said Lt. Ray
Madrigal of the California Highway Patrol.
