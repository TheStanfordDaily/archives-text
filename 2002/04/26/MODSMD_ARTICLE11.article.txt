1985
On April 26,1985, The Daily printed an ar
ticle about students protesting apartheid.
"Despite the urgings of some 1,000 pro
testers who crowded outside his office in the
second day of demonstrations there, Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy said yesterday
afternoon that divestment is 'not the \vay to re
lieve the appalling situation that we perceive
and that South Africans confront.'
"Kennedy, who spoke to the polite but
largely unpersuaded crowd for about 10 min
utes and then entertained questions, said he
continues to favor pursuing legislative re
form of U.S. foreign policy as 'the route that
offers the best hope of progress for this vex
ing problem.'
"Kennedy's speech followed a festive recep
tion for folk singer Joan Baez and former At
torney General Ramsey Clark, who urged the
crowd to continue its day-old protest in hopes
of ending the University's investments in cor
porations that do business in South Africa.
" The sit-in entered its second night last
night with more than 220 participants sleep
ing in the Quad. Students engaged in a wide
range of group discussions on the past and fu
ture of the protest, viewed films on apartheid
and continued the singing and planning that
characterized the previous night.
"The only sign of discord — a late-night
dispute among several protesters over
charges that Stanford Out of South Africa
(SOSA), the group coordinating the protest,
controlled the Kennedy question-and-answer
session by raising pre-planned question —
was settled when SOSA member Steve Phillips
called on protesters to air their grievances in
an hour-long discussion.
"At the peak of yesterday's protest, Baez
told the crowd, 'This ends the myth that you
are the totally non-thinking, self-centered
generation.' She was greeted with a standing
ovation and signs reading 'We Care' and 'U.S.
Out of South Africa.'
"Baez added, however, that time would
show if the protesters are 'spring vacation rev
olutionaries or whether you are serious about
what you're doing."
Bottom Line: Stanford can't muster the some kind of
activism it did almost 20 /ears ago — crowds of
1,000 in 1985 max out at 200 in 2002.
