## Israeli-Russian writer Shamir will give address on Middle East issues 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
To maintain campus awareness of the on
going conflict in the Middle East, the Muslim
Students Awareness Network will sponsor a
talk by Israeli-Russian journalist Israel
Shamir this evening.
According to members of the network,
the talk, entitled "Resolving the Crisis in
Palestine," will discuss humanitarian and
political issues as well as "U.S. complicity in
the Israeli war crimes committed in Jenin."
"We hope to offer a different perspec
tive, and that's why we'd like as diverse an
audience as possible," said junior Mo
hammed Abdoolcarim, the group's vice
president. He said that he believed the
lecture would cause listeners to realize
that "it's not as simple as the Israelis ver
sus the Palestinians and there's a war

going on."
Senior Randa Serag, a member of the
network, sees the talk as serving the more
specific purpose of shedding light on the
U.S. government's role in the conflict.
"The purpose of this talk is to raise
awareness of America's role in supporting
the massive human catastrophe that is oc
curring in Palestine," she said. "The Israeli
government is using American tax dollars,
'our' tax dollars, to effectively exterminate
an entire nation."
Serag, who helped bring Shamir to Stan
ford, said that the network is excited to host
such a "world-famous" speaker.
Shamir has worked for Israel Radio, the
BBC and various Israeli and Russian news
papers and magazines. He covered the first
Palestinian Intifada during the years 1989
to 1993. He has also written several novels,
including " The Pine and the Olive."
A press release announcing Shamir's talk
describes him as an "ardent advocate for
lasting peace and justice in the Middle East"
and a main proponent, along with Palestin
ian intellectual Edward Said, of the "one
man, one vote, one suite" solution to the con

flict between the Israelis and Palestinians.
Two larger local groups — American
Muslims for Global Peace and Justice and the
Strategic Research Foundation —j invited
Shamir to the Bay Area for other speaking
engagements and proposed to the network
that Shamir make an appearance at
Stanford.
Though this speech comes after Islam
Awareness Week, held earlier in April, Ab
doolcarim said that he felt it was important
to maintain programming throughout the
year to keep the campus engaged.
"It's important to have the consistency
throughout the quarter, so people can keep
touching base on these issues and not forget
about them," he said.
Serag said she hopes that the talk will not
only educate the community, but also in
spire involvement.
"We want members of the Stanford com
munity to take action, to do their part in
pressuring our government to stop sup
porting the ongoing Israeli war crimes," she
said.
Shamir will speak in Cubberley Auditori
um tonight at 8:30 p.m.
