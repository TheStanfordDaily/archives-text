### ERIN ARCHERD STAFF WRITER 
Ballroom dancers and enthusiasts from
throughout California will gather at Roble
Gym on Saturday to show their moves in
the annual Cardinal ("lassie dance compe
tition, an event sponsored by the Stanford
Ballroom Dance l earn.
The competition includes Latin, stan
dard and nightclub dancing. This year,
over 100 competitors are registered for the
event.
"I've been watching the entries come in,
and entering them into our competition
software, so I know that we have dancers
from as close as Berkeley and as lar as UC-
San Diego," said Natalie Kirilcuk, a med

ical student.
The competition is open to everyone,
with a $5 charge for spectators, $ 15 for stu
dent competitors and $20 for non-student
competitors. Registration opens at 11:30
a.m. and the competition runs from 12:30
p.m. to 10:30 p.m.
Many styles of dance will be shown
during the competition including: Latin
dances like the chacha, rumba, samba,
jive and mambo; standard dances like
waltz, tango, Viennese waltz, foxtrot,
quickstep; and nightclub dances like the
West Coast swing, lindy hop, Argentine
tango, hustle and salsa. There will also
be special events throughout the day.
"[ There will be] fun events, such as re
verse-sex rumba, group formation team

competition and general social dancing,"
said sophomore Valerie Do, the president
of the dance team.
Ballroom dancing has gained popu
larity across the country and many
schools have formed dance teams. Col
leges with strong dance teams often host
competitions.
Stanford Ballroom Dance Team
hosts the Cardinal Classic in the spring
and the Beginner's Challenge, a fall
competition that encourages competi
tive ballroom among beginning
dancers.
"Competitions, especially collegiate
ones, are a lot fun," Do said. "You are danc
ing with people your age, from different
schools, and you have fun challenging

your team against the others."
The Dance Team competes at several
competitions throughout the year and has
grown from a group of dance lovers to a
committed team.
"I've watched the team go from a few
random people in a class at a local studio to
a thriving and united team which dances
well wherever we go," Kirilcuk said.
Team members said they enjoy the
team mentality.
"1 love ballroom because it's a kind of
dancing that requires collaborative
effort — it's not just about the individual,
but about the couple," said senior Alisha
Niehaus.
Junior Jessica Kao, with will be compet
ing with a partner, agreed.

"Peoplejoin for the camaraderie, and to
be part of a group that has a common in
terest," Kao said
Senior Alisha Niehaus likes the mix of
people found in the dance community.
"Ballroom is the kookiest combination
of really rich old people,
really talented young teachers and really
poor students who like to dance," Niehaus
said.
While some may not consider dancing
an athletic activity, team members say it is
similar to a varsity sport, lending it the
name "dancesport."
"We have a team," Kao said. "We have a
coach. My partner and I meet with our
coach one to two times a week. We have
practice four to five times a week."
