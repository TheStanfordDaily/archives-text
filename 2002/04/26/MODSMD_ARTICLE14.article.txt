## The 						Stanford Daily SoCo board bill a flawed way to promote responsibility 
### 
Published Since 1891

Sophomore College is one of Stanford's
most creative and successful initiatives
in recent years. Members of the Fresh
man and Sophomore Programs Office
have done an admirable job building a pro
gram that has become a model, admired and
imitated by other universities, for bringing to
gether senior faculty and eager students at the
start of the crucial sophomore year.
The recent decision to charge students $400
for the privilege of participating in Sophomore
College, however, is a mistake.
Sophomore College Director Sharon Palmer
characterizes the $400 fee as a board bill, im
plemented to help cover operating costs. While
we have no doubt the money charged students
will be applied towards program expenses, we
suspect there might be other motives to this de
cision.
Some faculty participants, administrators
and sophomores have complained over the last
two years that an increasing number of stu-

dents behave irresponsibly while attending
Sophomore College. Faculty and administra
tors worry, and rightly so, that students may use
the amenities of the program in the wrong way.
They may view the string of free dinners, field
trips and film nights as a two-week summer
camp for sophomores, devoid of any significant
academic content.
Charging a $400 fee is a method, the logic
goes, of forcing students to be serious and be
have responsibly. The goal of encouraging
student diligence is admirable, but the
method is faulty.
Levying a fee from students addresses
none of the underlying issues that contribute
to student irresponsibility. The problem,
where it exists, is primarily one of expecta
tions brought by particular students and per
petuated by aspects of the program itself. For
whatever reason, some students come to
Sophomore College expecting a summer
camp. This misimpression can and should be

dissipated in the first instance by the Sopho
more College information material mailed to
freshmen. Applicants should have no illu
sions about the fact that they are competing
with their peers for entrance into a funda
mentally academic program.
Yet Sophomore College has always present
ed itself as more than another class, and indeed
it is. The genius of the program is the relation
ship it fosters between the professor and the
student. Dinners in the city and field trips off
campus should serve to reinforce the professor
student connection. These extra-curricular ac
tivities, a vital part of Sophomore College,
ought to demonstrate that the life of the mind
reaches beyond the classroom. When they do
not, problems occur.
Social activities that stray from promoting
the core nexus between professor and student
can encourage a frivolous party atmosphere.
Students may be forgiven for thinking Sopho
more College is a party when their schedules

are chock-full of bowling nights and ice cream
socials and laser tag, all free of charge and all
having little to do with fostering relationships
between professors and students. These types
of activities have become an ever-larger part of
Sophomore College over the last years. They
should be curtailed.
If administrators are charging a fee merely
to try and cover operating expenses, as they say,
then they have chosen a particularly poor ap
proach. Sophomore College is aiming to be
come independently endowed at which point
no fee will need to be charged. If there is a bud
get shortfall, Freshman and Sophomore Pro
grams should reduce expenses in other areas
â€” such as the amount of money given to dorms
to plan social events.
However, if administrators are trying to re
mind students that Sophomore College is a
privilege, they need only better integrate as
pects of their own program with its core mission.
Charging students is not the way to do it.
