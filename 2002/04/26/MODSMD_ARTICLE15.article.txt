# THE 						FRIDAY COLUMN
## Bio-hex: cloning gone mad 
### 
An Italian doctor, Severino Anti
nori, said on Wednesday that
there are, right now on earth,
three women pregnant with
cloned embryos.
He may well be lying, but it seems like
enough people are aiming for human
cloning that it is probably just a matter of
time until we wake up one morning and
hear that a human clone has been born.
When that happens, it will be the biggest in

a sequence of ethically
vexing and just plain
weird biotech doings re
lated to animals over the
past few years.
You don't think it will
happen? Just to review,
here are some of the
things that have been ac
complished that just a

decade ago would have been thought by
most to be science fiction.
Dolly the sheep was cloned. Then, cows,
goats, pigs and mice were cloned.
Then, dinosaurs were cloned from
DNA collected from a 65-million year-old
preserved mosquito (not really). A glowing
mouse was created using the DNA of bio
luminescent North American jellyfish
mouse (really). A mouse was made to have
a human ear growing off its back (really).
A cat was cloned, just this past February.
The little kitten's creators named her CC -
short for either Carbon Copy or Copy Cat
— and the work was funded by multimil
lionaire John Sperling, who wants technol
ogy developed to clone his much-loved
companion, Missy the dog.
A cow was implanted with a spider's
genes for silk, allowing for the production
of artificial spider silk. Scientists plan to
mass-produce the silk with a herd of
transgenic goats from whose milk the silk
can be fabricated.
When these types of bizarre, wacky
things are done with animals, it strikes a
deep chord about what we feel is natural
and right, in a way that work with plants —
no matter how consequential — does not.
And, when the animal in question is the
human animal — though I personally feel
less uncomfortable, as the subject can com
municate how he feels and give his consent
— people seem to get even more
squeamish.
But if recent history is any example,
human cloning will be accomplished, no
matter what international treaties are
signed or what laws Congress passes to try
to prevent it. If something can be done, it
probably will.
The Raelians might be the group to do
the feat first. They are a group claiming
55,000 members in 84 countries and, ac
cording to their Web site, are "working to
ward the first embassy to welcome people
from space." They Inlieve that extrater
restrials created life on earth using genet
ic engineering.
Among the Raelians* other beliefs are

that "God" is a mistranslation of the He
brew "Elohim," which they say is really the
name of the extraterrestrial race that creat
ed us, and that the resurrection of Jesus
was due to advanced cloning techniques
performed by the Elohim.
In 1997, the Raelians founded Clonaid,
motto: "The first human cloning compa
ny!" According to Rael, the group's leader,
"Cloning will enable mankind to reach
eternal life."
Clonaid's first goal is to be the first to an
nounce the birth of a clone. This they may
be able to do in not too long, unbeholden as
they are to mainstream opinion and beliefs.
Their longer term goal should fortunately
be a long way off: Explains Rael, "The next
step.. .will be to direcdy clone an adult per
son without having to go through the
growth process, and to transfer memory
and personality into this person. Then, we
wake up after death in a brand new body
just like after a good night sleep!"
Whoa.
The vast majority of biotechnology
from the past years is entirely unworthy of
controversy, fitting nicely within society's
frameworks. But some of it is so revolu
tionary, not just scientifically but also so
cially, that it cries out for oversight. Public
involvement will not influence the
Raelians, who are to biotechnology what
extranational terrorist networks are to war,
but it will influence what becomes com
monplace.
Politicians are starting to take an inter
est in the issues. Before Sept. 11, President
Bush's one prime-time television address
to the nation, besides addresses to
Congress, was to announce and explain his
decision on federal funding for stem-cell
research. And there is currently a flurry of
advertisements by interest groups seeking
to influence Congress's decision on
whether to ban the cloning of embryos for
medical research, so called "therapeutic
cloning," along with the widely con
demned "reproductive cloning."
With the breaking of each new stoiy, the
ethical and scxial questions come to the fore
front of the public consciousness for just long
enough for people to talk fora day and say,
"This is something we should re;illy be think
ing about," before forgetting. If we keep for
getting much longer, revolutions, for better
or worse, will have already happened, influ
enced not at all by the body politic.
I, for one, will continue touting the
virtues of developing glow-in-the-dark
giant beanstalks and pointing out the dan
gers of super-intelligent, fire-breathing
telepathic mice that wear bulletproof vests
made of spider silk they produce and have
a grudge because of the uncomfortable
human ears on their backs.

An Italian doctor, Severino Anti
nori, said on Wednesday that
there are, right now on earth,
three women pregnant with
cloned embryos.
He may well be lying, but it seems like
enough people are aiming for human
cloning that it is probably just a matter of
time until we wake up one morning and
hear that a human clone has been born.
When that happens, it will be the biggest in

a sequence of ethically
vexing and just plain
weird biotech doings re
lated to animals over the
past few years.
You don't think it will
happen? Just to review,
here are some of the
things that have been ac
complished that just a

decade ago would have been thought by
most to be science fiction.
Dolly the sheep was cloned. Then, cows,
goats, pigs and mice were cloned.
Then, dinosaurs were cloned from
DNA collected from a 65-million year-old
preserved mosquito (not really). A glowing
mouse was created using the DNA of bio
luminescent North American jellyfish
mouse (really). A mouse was made to have
a human ear growing off its back (really).
A cat was cloned, just this past February.
The little kitten's creators named her CC -
short for either Carbon Copy or Copy Cat
— and the work was funded by multimil
lionaire John Sperling, who wants technol
ogy developed to clone his much-loved
companion, Missy the dog.
A cow was implanted with a spider's
genes for silk, allowing for the production
of artificial spider silk. Scientists plan to
mass-produce the silk with a herd of
transgenic goats from whose milk the silk
can be fabricated.
When these types of bizarre, wacky
things are done with animals, it strikes a
deep chord about what we feel is natural
and right, in a way that work with plants —
no matter how consequential — does not.
And, when the animal in question is the
human animal — though I personally feel
less uncomfortable, as the subject can com
municate how he feels and give his consent
— people seem to get even more
squeamish.
But if recent history is any example,
human cloning will be accomplished, no
matter what international treaties are
signed or what laws Congress passes to try
to prevent it. If something can be done, it
probably will.
The Raelians might be the group to do
the feat first. They are a group claiming
55,000 members in 84 countries and, ac
cording to their Web site, are "working to
ward the first embassy to welcome people
from space." They Inlieve that extrater
restrials created life on earth using genet
ic engineering.
Among the Raelians* other beliefs are

that "God" is a mistranslation of the He
brew "Elohim," which they say is really the
name of the extraterrestrial race that creat
ed us, and that the resurrection of Jesus
was due to advanced cloning techniques
performed by the Elohim.
In 1997, the Raelians founded Clonaid,
motto: "The first human cloning compa
ny!" According to Rael, the group's leader,
"Cloning will enable mankind to reach
eternal life."
Clonaid's first goal is to be the first to an
nounce the birth of a clone. This they may
be able to do in not too long, unbeholden as
they are to mainstream opinion and beliefs.
Their longer term goal should fortunately
be a long way off: Explains Rael, "The next
step.. .will be to direcdy clone an adult per
son without having to go through the
growth process, and to transfer memory
and personality into this person. Then, we
wake up after death in a brand new body
just like after a good night sleep!"
Whoa.
The vast majority of biotechnology
from the past years is entirely unworthy of
controversy, fitting nicely within society's
frameworks. But some of it is so revolu
tionary, not just scientifically but also so
cially, that it cries out for oversight. Public
involvement will not influence the
Raelians, who are to biotechnology what
extranational terrorist networks are to war,
but it will influence what becomes com
monplace.
