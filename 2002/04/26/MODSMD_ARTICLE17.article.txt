Call boxes out of order
In honor of "Take Back the Night," I
want to bring an important campus safety
problem to the community's attention.
The emergency call boxes placed around
campus are still 'Out of Order'. I have
been at Stanford for almost eight months,
and these emergency call boxes have not
been fixed. If I get attacked while I am
waiting for the bus late at night, I can only
hope that someone will hear my screams,
because these call boxes will not aid me. I
can't understand how Stanford can put up
new buildings so quickly, yet cannot prior
itize such a small step towards student
safety. This is especially important for the
women of Stanford, for most violence oc
curs against us.
Please get these call boxes online before
a student who could have been helped is
injured, or worse, raped or killed.

Former Row House Manager criticizes
selection process
I am writing in response to yesterday's
editorial regarding the Resident Assistant
selection process ("RA selection process
unfair to returning applicants").
While I agree with your assertion that
returning RA applicants are getting the
short end of the stick, 1 emphatically dis
agree with your statement that the selec
tion process "has always been regarded as
objective." Rather, the process is fraught

with irregularities that are cleverly con
cealed from the majority of the under
graduate population.
As a former staff member in a Row
house, I had the rather dubious distinc
tion of participating in the RA selection
process not once, but twice.
During my first time dealing with RA
selection, the other future house staff
members and I took part in a very lengthy
and difficult discussion in order to list the
RA candidates in order of preference.
This process was made all the more diffi
cult due to the fact that one of the appli
cants was a fairly well-liked house member
who ended up being fourth on our list. 1
was therefore rather surprised to find that
this person ended up being selected.
Apparently, the RA at the time, who
was friends with the fourth-place appli
cant, made a quick phone call to someone
in the upper echelons of Residential Edu
cation in order to solve the selection
"problem." The other applicants, being
neither house residents nor friends of the
RA, were clearly placed at a disadvantage.
My second time through, a number of
people involved in a certain extracurricu
lar sport decided that they all wanted to
live in the house together the next year.
Not being content to cast their lot in the
Draw, as the majority of undergrads did,
these people decided to achieve their goal
by cornering the market on house staff,
starting with the RA position. That year's
RA also happened to be friends with this
group of people, and lo and behold, their
choice for RA was selected. The RA-to-be
then convinced the remainder of the

house's residents that they should vote for
the rest of the staff members on her "tick
et," since "being good friends, they would
work together seamlessly."
The result: the conspirators succeeded
in filling the house's staff positions, exclud
ing better-qualified candidates. Since the
staff also had control over assigning priori
ties, the outcome was not only a corruption
of the house RAand staff selection process,
but also of the Draw. Several people who
did not remotely qualify for priorities, in
cluding the significant other of an elected
staff member, nonetheless received them.
Needless to say, 1 was thoroughly dis
gusted by the blatant unfairness of the
whole undertaking. I voiced concerns
over the process on several occasions, and
was assured by Res Ed that committees
would be convened to address the issue;
however, no action was taken.
112 wonder if those undergrads who
never had the opportunity to live on the
Row would agree with your definition of
"objectivity." 1 know I certainly don't.
