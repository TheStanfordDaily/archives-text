# WORLD VIEWPOINT
## Israel and the United States are not fighting the same war 
### KAREEM GHANEM INTERMISSION EDITOR 
Since the Sept. 11 attacks, we Ameri
cans take the threat of international ter
rorism very seriously. Our resulting men
tality leaves us susceptible to emotional ap
peals whenever the issue of terrorism is a
factor. In equating the moral legitimacy of
the United States' campaign against ter
rorism with Israel's campaign against the
Palestinian people, the Israeli government
and its advocates hope to exploit precisely
this vulnerability.
The simple fact, however, is that there
is no moral parallel between our battle
against al-Qaeda and what the deceptive
ly-tided Israel Defense Forces are current
ly doing in the Palestinian territories.
The story from the Israeli government
is this: Former Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak offered Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat a tremendously
generous deal at the Camp David summit
hosted by then-President Bill Clinton.
Rather than reach for the olive branch of
peace, however, Arafat selfishly and sense
lessly rejected the offer and turned to ter

rpr to achieve his aims. The current Israeli
offensive, it stands to reason, is simply a
defensive measure to root out the terrorist
infrastructure of the Palestinian terror ap
paratus. It is time to confront a complete
appraisal of the current situation.
To begin with, it is foolish to condemn
Arafat for rejecting Barak's offer. In truth,
the Israeli proposal would have included
no guarantee of contiguous borders for
the Palestinian state (Palestine would have
existed as pockets of territory surrounded
by greater Israel), no Israeli withdrawal
from the Jewish settlements within the
Palestinian territories and little control by
the Palestinian government over water re
sources. Additionally, it would have placed
crippling restrictions on the new state's
ability to raise a defensive army.
In short, Barak's proposal amounted to
an economically, politically and militarily
dependent ghost of a self-governing enti
ty. Would Israel ever agree to be bound by
these same restrictions? They'd have to be
crazy to abide by that agreement. And so
would the Palestinians.
This all reveals that the Israeli govern
ment has rarely seen the Palestinian peo

pie as equals to be dealt with fairly. Today,
Ariel Sharon, who could easily be convict
ed as a war criminal, leads Israel. After an
Israeli commission found him responsible
for the infamous massacres at the Sabra
and Shatila refugee camps in Lebanon in
the early '80s, he resigned in shame from
his post as Defense Minister. No one
thought he would ever rise to a politically
prominent position until the Israeli peo
ple elected him prime minister by a land
slide in early 2001. Today, he is an accom
plice to a murderous strategy that has
claimed thousands.
Documentation of Israeli military abus
es against civilians may be hard to come by
in the American press, but it's there if you
look. One need not consult Arab news
sources per se — Israeli papers such as
Ha'aretz have openly challenged Sharon's
barbarism. In its April 17 editorial,
Ha'aretz writes, "The public is ripe for the
emergence of a leader courageous enough
to correct the tragic mistake, made by
every Israeli government since 1967, to
build settlements...Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon is not the person to take on this his
toric role."

Apart from the massive physical blows
the Israelis have dealt the Palestinians,
there is an important component of sheer
personal humiliation in the way the Pales
tinians have been treated. From entire
apartment buildings that have been ra/ed
because they might have housed a terror
ist meeting place to Muslim women who
have had their hijabs (head scarves) torn
of! in public places, the Palestinians have
been thoroughly abused by their occu
piers. This was made especially clear in the
news reports from Arafat's half-demol
ished headquarters where the leader, sur
rounded by Israeli tanks outside, huddled
with aides around a lit candle while trying
to reach world leaders by cell phone.
Charles Krauthammer and now
Richard Cohen (both Washington Post
columnists) speak for more than a few
hard-liners when they advocate physical
Israeli disengagement by building a wall
to hold the Palestinians in Caza and the
West Bank. Apparently someone's been
taking their c ues from the Pat Buchanan
school of foreign diplomacy: Turn the
Palestinian territories into a giant con
centration camp.

Both these pundits and the Israeli gov
ernment, however, are deluding them
selves if they think that continued aggres
sion will end the suicide bombings. Tar
geted civilian attacks are reprehensible
whether they are committed by groups
like Hamas and Islamic Jihad or by a state
government such as that of Ariel Sharon.
In the wake of the devastating siege of
Jenin, the United States must stand with
the rest of the world in strict condemna
tion of the Israeli government's actions.
Only when Israel begins viewing the
Palestinians as a people with legitimate
grievances deserving of dignity and empa
thy, will the first steps have been taken to
ward a lasting peace that respects the aspi
rations of both the Palestinian and Israeli
peoples. The United States must lead the
way by taking action and showing Sharon
that there are real consequences if his gov
ernment continues down this maniacal
and destructive path.

factor. In equating the moral legitimacy of
the United States' campaign against ter
rorism with Israel's campaign against the
Palestinian people, the Israeli government
and its advocates hope to exploit precisely
this vulnerability.
The simple fact, however, is that there
is no moral parallel between our battle
against al-Qaeda and what the deceptive
ly-tided Israel Defense Forces are current
ly doing in the Palestinian territories.
The story from the Israeli government
is this: Former Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak offered Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat a tremendously
generous deal at the Camp David summit
hosted by then-President Bill Clinton.
Rather than reach for the olive branch of
peace, however, Arafat selfishly and sense
lessly rejected the offer and turned to ter

rpr to achieve his aims. The current Israeli
offensive, it stands to reason, is simply a
defensive measure to root out the terrorist
infrastructure of the Palestinian terror ap
paratus. It is time to confront a complete
appraisal of the current situation.
To begin with, it is foolish to condemn
Arafat for rejecting Barak's offer. In truth,
the Israeli proposal would have included
no guarantee of contiguous borders for
the Palestinian state (Palestine would have
existed as pockets of territory surrounded
by greater Israel), no Israeli withdrawal
from the Jewish settlements within the
Palestinian territories and little control by
the Palestinian government over water re
sources. Additionally, it would have placed
crippling restrictions on the new state's
ability to raise a defensive army.
In short, Barak's proposal amounted to
an economically, politically and militarily
dependent ghost of a self-governing enti
ty. Would Israel ever agree to be bound by
these same restrictions? They'd have to be
crazy to abide by that agreement. And so
would the Palestinians.
This all reveals that the Israeli govern
ment has rarely seen the Palestinian peo

pie as equals to be dealt with fairly. Today,
Ariel Sharon, who could easily be convict
ed as a war criminal, leads Israel. After an
Israeli commission found him responsible
for the infamous massacres at the Sabra
and Shatila refugee camps in Lebanon in
the early '80s, he resigned in shame from
his post as Defense Minister. No one
thought he would ever rise to a politically
prominent position until the Israeli peo
ple elected him prime minister by a land
slide in early 2001. Today, he is an accom
plice to a murderous strategy that has
claimed thousands.
Documentation of Israeli military abus
es against civilians may be hard to come by
in the American press, but it's there if you
look. One need not consult Arab news
sources per se — Israeli papers such as
Ha'aretz have openly challenged Sharon's
barbarism. In its April 17 editorial,
Ha'aretz writes, "The public is ripe for the
emergence of a leader courageous enough
to correct the tragic mistake, made by
every Israeli government since 1967, to
build settlements...Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon is not the person to take on this his
toric role."

Apart from the massive physical blows
the Israelis have dealt the Palestinians,
there is an important component of sheer
personal humiliation in the way the Pales
tinians have been treated. From entire
apartment buildings that have been ra/ed
because they might have housed a terror
ist meeting place to Muslim women who
have had their hijabs (head scarves) torn
of! in public places, the Palestinians have
been thoroughly abused by their occu
piers. This was made especially clear in the
news reports from Arafat's half-demol
ished headquarters where the leader, sur
rounded by Israeli tanks outside, huddled
with aides around a lit candle while trying
to reach world leaders by cell phone.
Charles Krauthammer and now
Richard Cohen (both Washington Post
columnists) speak for more than a few
hard-liners when they advocate physical
Israeli disengagement by building a wall
to hold the Palestinians in Caza and the
West Bank. Apparently someone's been
taking their c ues from the Pat Buchanan
school of foreign diplomacy: Turn the
Palestinian territories into a giant con
centration camp.

Both these pundits and the Israeli gov
ernment, however, are deluding them
selves if they think that continued aggres
sion will end the suicide bombings. Tar
geted civilian attacks are reprehensible
whether they are committed by groups
like Hamas and Islamic Jihad or by a state
government such as that of Ariel Sharon.
In the wake of the devastating siege of
Jenin, the United States must stand with
the rest of the world in strict condemna
tion of the Israeli government's actions.
Only when Israel begins viewing the
Palestinians as a people with legitimate
grievances deserving of dignity and empa
thy, will the first steps have been taken to
ward a lasting peace that respects the aspi
rations of both the Palestinian and Israeli
peoples. The United States must lead the
way by taking action and showing Sharon
that there are real consequences if his gov
ernment continues down this maniacal
and destructive path.
