# World War II project brings overseas students to concentration camps
## 
### SEAN VOIGT 
At the end of March, despite
the bitter cold and freezing rain,
junior Brandon Reavis stared at a
row of unassuming ovens that
once burned in the crematori
um of the Sachsenhausen con
centration camp just outside of
Berlin.
"I thought about what it must
have been like to stand there in
the freezing rain, with no shoes
and few clothes, and know that
my fate waited just, inside, irre
versibly sealed," Reavis said. "It
reminded me that, in the end,
all wars are about human suffer
ing, incurring it, stopping it and
preventing it."
Reavis visited the concentra
tion camp with a group of Stan
ford students last quarter from
each of Stanford's European
Overseas centers â€” Moscow,
Paris, Oxford, Florence and
Berlin. Meeting in Berlin in late
March, these students partici
pated in a four-day conference
meant to explore some of the
facets of World War II: its histo
ry, its implications and its in
tractable issues. The program,
initiated by the Overseas Studies
Office, will serve as a pilot for the
newly-created World War II
Project.
While Reavis's trip to Sach
senhausen on the third day of
the conference may have been
one of the most salient exam
ples of the topic, the entire con
ference was marked by mean
ingful exchanges and vigorous
exploration.
" The conference was in
tense," said junior Ben Wyler,
who studied in Paris. "In addi
tion to the emotional and intel
lectual impact of the ideas dis
cussed, activities were scheduled

from early morning through
dinner each day."
Delegates from each overseas
center had enrolled in country
specific World War II seminars
during their studies abroad and
were responsible for presenting
their work to the students, facul
ty and administration attending
the conference. Presentation
topics ranged from military
strategy in Britain to Italian cin
ematic: portrayals of the war, but
some of the greatest learning oc
curred in round table discus
sions, visits to historic sites and
personal conversations with
Stanford faculty.
"It was one of the most valu
able intellectual experiences I've
had at Stanford," Wyler said. "It
was not about coming to any
conclusion or cramming your
head with facts. Instead, it in
volved sharing viewpoints and
experiences, facing the com
plexity of World War I l's causes
and influences and asking ques
tions without always expecting a
satisfying answer."
The topic itself created a
unique forum for discussion.
"I was surprised to see the
way each delegation or center
began to embody nationalist
tendencies," said junior Liz
Cretti, who studied in Flo
rence. "Each center seemed to
be filled with this national
pride; this need to communi
cate how important World War
II had been on their particular
country."
Created by the Overseas
Studies Program and with all ex
penses covered by Stanford, the
World War II program and the
conference that marked its cul
mination were very much in
their infancy when the delegates
arrived in Berlin.

"We wanted to see what syn
ergies are made possible by
bringing Stanford students to
gether from different countries,
to see what we learn about com
monality as well as about differ
ence," said Jacqueline Wender,
Overseas Studies executive di
rector. "This was an ambitious
undertaking, and in some sense,
succeeded beyond anyone's ex
pectations."
With this success, World War
II programs will now be avail
able to all students studying in
Europe, with the Berlin confer
ence falling at the end of winter
quarter. Any student studying in
Europe is eligible to participate
in the program and applications
for the 2002-2003 winter pro
gram are due on May 3.
"If anything, I'd say the con
ference is more of a reason to
apply fora winter quarter
abroad," Cretti said. "It is an ex
cellent way to wrap up the quar
ter and conclude a very intense
period abroad."
On the last day of the confer
ence Reavis stood before the del
egates and gave a concluding
address.
"Yesterday at Sachsen
hausen, I spent a long time star
ing at the row of unassuming
ovens that stood at one corner
of the compound yard. I found
that in between charred brick
and twisted metal, a small
green plant was growing. Out
of an instrument of death and
destruction, out of a crucible of
hate and fire and misery, life
had emerged. Frail, yes, but
present. Plato said that only the
dead have seen the end of war.
The great hope we take from
this conference is that the end
of war may truly see the begin
ning of life."
