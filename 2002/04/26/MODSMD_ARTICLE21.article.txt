## After scare, Card heads to Oregon 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It may have gotten a (5-5 win
on Wednesday night at Sunken
Diamond, but all is not well with
the No. 4 Stanford Cardinal.
Despite coming from behind
for the 14th time this season on
sophomore rightfielder Carlos
Quentin's seventh-inning,
three-run home run to left field
to defeat Sacramento State (15-
24, 0-12 Big West Conference),
the Cardinal (28-10, 5-4 Pacific
10 Conference) heads to Cor
vallis, Ore., this weekend still
trailing conference leader
Southern California by 2 1/2
games in the midst of its poor
est stretch of the season.
In recent weeks, a slumping
off ense, inconsistent relief pitch
ing and spotty defense have
plagued the Cardinal, which has
dropped to fourth in all four
major college baseball polls.
Wednesday evening, head
coach Mark Marquess re
ceived some positive signs in
each of those departments,
but not nearly enough to feel
comfortable as his team en
ters the heart of the Pac-10
race.
"It was good to get a win, but
we were very fortunate to get it,"

Marquess said.
Quentin's home run — his
eighth of the season — off los
ing pitcher Matt Cuckovich, al
lowed the sparse crowd at
Sunken Diamond to breathe a
collective sigh of relief. Fora
while, it seemed as if the erratic
bullpen's fifth-inning woes
would lead to a third tough de
feat in the last four games.
"We've had some guys that
have been effective for us, but
we're not quite sure what we're
getting all the time," Marquess
said.
The Hornets certainly knew
what they were getting and

second straight trip to the Northwest this weekend when they face Ore

four hits and three walks.
Freshman Johnny Dyer, in his
second inning on the hill, was one
strike away from escaping with
out allowing a run with a man on
second base. However, Sacra
mento State's Everet Rincon sin
gled on an 0-2 pitch to start the
Hornet rally.
Senior J.D. Willcox then
walked home a run and also al
lowed a pair of singles on 0-2
counts that brought home three
more, putting Stanford in a big
hole with absolutely nothing
going at the plate.
The three 0-2 RBI hits in the
inning and the three walks epit
omized the struggles of the Stan
ford relief corps this season.
After blowing leads in two games
over the weekend in Seattle, the
ndn-conference game against
thj .256-hitting Hornets gave
thj| bullpen a chance to straight
en itSfelf but and gain some con
fidence heading into Corvallis.
Marquess used seven different
pitchers, and the five apart from
Dyer and Willcox allowed just
two hits in 7 1/3 innings.
"We've got to get a lot of them
work, and most of those guys did a
good job and didn't go too long, so
we can use them this weekend if we

need them," Marquess said. "It
worked out well, and fortunately
we got a win."
Sophomore center fielder Sam
Fuld extended his hitting streak
to six games with a 3-for-4 night
and senior second baseman
Chris O'Riordan pushed his
streak to a career-high 12 games
with a single. O'Riordan has now
reached base in all 38 of Stan
ford's games this season and has
hits in 35 of them.
The performances of
Quentin, Fuld and O'Riordan
overshadowed yet another poor
offensive showing in the early in
nings for Stanford. In its last
four games, Stanford has gone
just 18 for 75 (.240) with only
four runs in the first through
fifth innings.
"I think it's a concern,"
Quentin said, speaking about the
Cardinal's recent lackluster effort
at the plate. "We have struggled,
and that's the truth. We haven't
peaked yet and right now we're
in a little bit of a slide, but we're
looking forward to picking it up
this weekend and getting back on
the right track.
"I think this team has all the po
tential in the world. We haven't
shown what we can do yet so it'll be
something when we do."
Marquess echoed his right field
er's mix of concern and optimism.
"There's no rhyme or reason to
it,"he said. "We could score 20 or

score one. We're unpredictable, but
we're capable of it. But if you pitch
well and play defense then you give
yourself a chance to win those
games when you can't score."
Stanford's skipper surely was
pleased with the defense he saw
Wednesday night. In the fifth,
Hornet Tito Barba lined a rocket
to Arik VanZandt at third that fell
out of the senior's glove. Van-
Zandt grabbed the ball with his
bare hand off one bounce and
threw to first base for an impres
sive putout.
Another senior, shortstop Andy
Topham, made the play of the
game and one of the most spectac
ular plays of the season when he
dove up the middle to grab Bret
LeVier's sharp ground ball.
Topham laid out to his left and re
covered with a solid throw to first,
flashing the leather that has made
such plays seem routine in his last
two years as a starter.
With three key games in the
Northwest for the second consecu
tive weekend, the Cardinal cannot
afford to fall farther back in the
conference race. It must shoot for
a sweep in its games against Ore
gon State.
With tonight's (5 p.m. contest,
Stanford will play the Beavers in
the first night game in the 96-year
history of Goss Stadium at Cole
man Field. Tomorrow's game will
begin at 4 p.m., with the Sunday fi
nale set for 1 p.m.
