## After scare, Card heads to Oregon 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It may have gotten a (5-5 win
on Wednesday night at Sunken
Diamond, but all is not well with
the No. 4 Stanford Cardinal.
Despite coming from behind
for the 14th time this season on
sophomore rightfielder Carlos
Quentin's seventh-inning,
three-run home run to left field
to defeat Sacramento State (15-
24, 0-12 Big West Conference),
the Cardinal (28-10, 5-4 Pacific
10 Conference) heads to Cor
vallis, Ore., this weekend still
trailing conference leader
Southern California by 2 1/2
games in the midst of its poor
est stretch of the season.
In recent weeks, a slumping
off ense, inconsistent relief pitch
ing and spotty defense have
plagued the Cardinal, which has
dropped to fourth in all four
major college baseball polls.
Wednesday evening, head
coach Mark Marquess re
ceived some positive signs in
each of those departments,
but not nearly enough to feel
comfortable as his team en
ters the heart of the Pac-10
race.
"It was good to get a win, but
we were very fortunate to get it,"

Marquess said.
Quentin's home run — his
eighth of the season — off los
ing pitcher Matt Cuckovich, al
lowed the sparse crowd at
Sunken Diamond to breathe a
collective sigh of relief. Fora
while, it seemed as if the erratic
bullpen's fifth-inning woes
would lead to a third tough de
feat in the last four games.
"We've had some guys that
have been effective for us, but
we're not quite sure what we're
getting all the time," Marquess
said.
The Hornets certainly knew
what they were getting and
jumped out to a 5-0 lead, batting
