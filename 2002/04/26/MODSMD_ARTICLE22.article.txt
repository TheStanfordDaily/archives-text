"This conference is going to test
you," said Stanford Softball head
coach John Rittman.
That is exactly what this weekend
will be lor the No. 7 Stanford softball
squad (37-11,4-8 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) as it will take on top-ranked
UCLA and No. 8 Washington in an
important series of rematches.

As Rittman alluded to, the Pac
-10 is the toughest of conferences in
college softball â€” six of the eight
teams rank in the top-10 with Ore
gon State at No. 16.
The level of competition is
that of a national championship
game, every single weekend,
and this weekend's face-offs
promise to be hard-fought bat
tles at the highest level of colle
giate softball.
The Cardinal also has added
motivation, as it heads into this
weekend's series having dropped
its last six conference games. Stan
ford, which picked up two victories
in a nonconference doubleheader
against Sacramento State on lues

day, currently stands seventh in
the eight-team Pac-10 Conference.
The matchups begin Friday
evening when the Huskies will
travel down fora game in which
the Cardinal will attempt to seek
some revenge.
The last time the two teams
met, Washington surprised Stan
ford by taking two games from
the visiting Cardinal in Seattle.
But, this time around, the squad
will be back on the Farm eager to
get a victory and return to its
winning ways.
"We have a team that is very de
termined to win games," Rittman
said. "We go after this by trying to
do the little things and the neces
sary things. We got back to this in
our games against Sacramento
State and we are going to try and
take that good positive energy into
this weekend."
This weekend, Cardinal will try
to focus on the small things, since it
knows that Washington will be
hungry fora win as well.
"Washington is playing very
well right now," Rittman said.
"They are a very good team, and to
win will have to bring our 'A' game
to the field."
After its Friday night game
against the Huskies, Stanford will
take on another softball power
house in UCLA.
The last time the two teams
met, it was a matchup in which
UCIA ranked No. 2 nationally
and the Cardinal ranked No. 3.
This time around, the Bruins
have climbed to No. 1 and Stan
ford has fallen to No. 7.
In their last matchup, the Car
dinal played a solid game behind a
phenomenal performance by ju
nior pitcher Tori Nyberg. The bat

tie ended with Stanford down by
one run, but the difference was
slight and begged fora rematch.
The rematch is now here,
and the Cardinal recognizes its
competition.
"They are the No. 1 team in the
nation," Rittman siacL "They are
loaded with talent. This weekend
will be like playing in the College

World Series."
Stanford, however, is not fo
cusing on the opposition, and
instead on what it needs to do to
be successful.
"We need to play good defense,
not give away outs, and get some
clutch hits," Rittman said.
If it can do these three things
the Cardinal can beat anyone.
