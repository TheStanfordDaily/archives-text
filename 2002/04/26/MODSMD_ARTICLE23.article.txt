# Jonathon Riley
## At the head of the pack 
### DAN URBAN STAFF WRITER 
He's an NCAA champion, a world-record
holder a 14 time Ail-American, and he's not
done yet.
Senior Jonathon Riley has, no doubt, been
one of the most decorated and successful run
ners in Stanford history.
A studio art major, Riley says he may possi
bly design racing shoes one day.
Rut for the time being, he races in other peo
ple's designs, and does so extremely well.
Making an impact since day one on the
Farm, Riley helped the cross country team to
its 1997 National Championship in his fresh
man season.
As the team's fifth and final scorer, Riley's

contribution was crucial, since it allowed Stan
ford to edge rival Arkansas by three points.
"[Running at NCAAs] was definitely some
thing I was working toward," Riley said. "I had
been running varsity but not scoring all season.
To have my best race of the season at nationals
and be part of a national championship my
freshman year, I was very fortunate."
With his tremendous freshman season, Riley
made the tough transition to the college level,
something that not all star high school runners
are able to do.

"I came into college being successful, but I
knew college would be a whole other level and
it would like a lot to reach that," he said." I knew
with the right coaching and training, things
would work out the right way."
Things started working out the right way
very quickly for Riley. In track that year, he
was the top-ranked true freshman in the na
tion in the 5,000 meters. As a sophomore, he
placed ninth at the NCAA Cross Country
Championships.
Though he redshirted what would have
been his sophomore track season, Riley contin
ued to improve.
His time of 13 minutes, 36.69 seconds in
the 5,000 meters that year remains his per-
sonal best to this day, and that
race at the Cardinal Invitational
stands out as a milestone in his
career.
"That 13-second break
through in the [5,000-meters]
showed 1 could make it," Riley
said. " There's a big difference
between guys running 14 min
utes and guys in the 13:30'5.
Doing that as a sophomore got
me fired up."
Riley continued to deliver huge
performances when they mattered
most, placing fifth in the 5,000 me
ters to help Stanford to the 2000
NCAA outdoor track title, as well
as anchoring Stanford's world
record-setting distance medley
relay team.
A consistent and tough com
petitor, Riley made his 2001 track
season even better than the previ
ous years'.
Starting with a 7:48.79 in the
3,000 meters in the indoor season
— the fourth fastest collegiate time
in history— Riley was just getting
warmed up.
In his first ever 10,000-meter
race, Riley ran a 28:33.71, the sec
ond-fastest time in the nation that
year.
Things did not go as well in the
10,000 meters at i lie NCAACham
pionships, where he placed tenth.
Riley was sitting near the
back of the pack midway
through the 5,000 meters just
two days later, and spectators
unaware or Riley's race strategy
feared another disappointing
finish.
Instructed by coach Vin Lanan
na to lay back for the first two
miles, Riley "felt comfortable sit
ting in the pack, 112 was going in with
no expectations, like a weight was
off my shoulders."
When the leaders broke from
the main pack, Riley went with
them, eventually passing the race
favorites in a dramatic final 100
meters for the NCAA title.
Riley has run with some of Stan
ford's greatest all-time runners, in
addition to being one of them.
He says he has been inspired by
senior Gabe Jennings's passion for
racing and by alumnus Brad
Mauser's model of consistency and
hard work.
"When he got to the starting
line, you knew he was going to get
the job done," said Riley of
Hauser. "He showed what it
means to go out there and com

pete even when you're not having
your best day."
Riley has exemplified that
competitiveness and passed it on
to the new generation of Stanford
runners.
"He runs so well consistently
and he's so tough mentally," said
sophomore lan Dobson. "He's the
epitome of a tough competitor,
showing that not everything has to
be perfect to run well."
As evidence, Riley ran a
13:40.52 in the 5,000 meters with
nobody to push him in bis first race
of this season. It was his first colle
giate race of the season after being
forced to sit out the cross country
and indoor track seasons due to el
igibility reasons.
Riley has been an invaluable
contributor to some of Stan
ford's most spectacular, and un
expected, victories. Whether
toppling defending champion

Arkansas in cross country in
1997, winning the National
Outdoor Track Championship
in 2000, or surprising everyone
with a victory in the 2001 Pacific
10 Conference Championships,
Riley has been a point-scorer
and a leader.
Repeating as conference cham
pions will be no easy task for the
Cardinal, but Riley's view of the
team's aggressive training sched
ule and early-season success has
him optimistic.
"The Pac-10's are the measure
of how good a complete team is,
and this year's team is better across
the board than it's ever been,"
Riley said.
Next up for the Cardinal track
squad is the prestigious Penn Re
lays, held in Philadelphia this
weekend. Riley and company will
continue the hunt for personal
bests and NCAA qualifiers.

Senior Jonathon Riley has been an invaluable contributor to the Cardinal
track team. As a freshman in 1997, Riley helped the Cardinal cross country
team to an NCAA Championship. He has also garnered All-American sta
tus 14 times in cross country and track and field.
He's an NCAA champion, a world-record
holder a 14 time Ail-American, and he's not
done yet.
Senior Jonathon Riley has, no doubt, been
one of the most decorated and successful run
ners in Stanford history.
A studio art major, Riley says he may possi
bly design racing shoes one day.
Rut for the time being, he races in other peo
ple's designs, and does so extremely well.
Making an impact since day one on the
Farm, Riley helped the cross country team to
its 1997 National Championship in his fresh
man season.

contribution was crucial, since it allowed Stan
ford to edge rival Arkansas by three points.
"[Running at NCAAs] was definitely some
thing I was working toward," Riley said. "I had
been running varsity but not scoring all season.
To have my best race of the season at nationals
and be part of a national championship my
freshman year, I was very fortunate."
With his tremendous freshman season, Riley
made the tough transition to the college level,
something that not all star high school runners
are able to do.

"I came into college being successful, but I
knew college would be a whole other level and
it would like a lot to reach that," he said." I knew
with the right coaching and training, things
would work out the right way."
Things started working out the right way
very quickly for Riley. In track that year, he
was the top-ranked true freshman in the na
tion in the 5,000 meters. As a sophomore, he
placed ninth at the NCAA Cross Country
Championships.
Though he redshirted what would have
been his sophomore track season, Riley contin
ued to improve.
His time of 13 minutes, 36.69 seconds in
the 5,000 meters that year remains his per-
sonal best to this day, and that
race at the Cardinal Invitational
stands out as a milestone in his
career.
"That 13-second break
through in the [5,000-meters]
showed 1 could make it," Riley
said. " There's a big difference
between guys running 14 min
utes and guys in the 13:30'5.
Doing that as a sophomore got
me fired up."
Riley continued to deliver huge
performances when they mattered
most, placing fifth in the 5,000 me
ters to help Stanford to the 2000
NCAA outdoor track title, as well
as anchoring Stanford's world
record-setting distance medley
relay team.
A consistent and tough com
petitor, Riley made his 2001 track
season even better than the previ
ous years'.
Starting with a 7:48.79 in the
3,000 meters in the indoor season
— the fourth fastest collegiate time
in history— Riley was just getting
warmed up.
In his first ever 10,000-meter
race, Riley ran a 28:33.71, the sec
ond-fastest time in the nation that
year.
Things did not go as well in the
10,000 meters at i lie NCAACham
pionships, where he placed tenth.
Riley was sitting near the
back of the pack midway
through the 5,000 meters just
two days later, and spectators
unaware or Riley's race strategy
feared another disappointing
finish.
Instructed by coach Vin Lanan
na to lay back for the first two
miles, Riley "felt comfortable sit
ting in the pack, 112 was going in with
no expectations, like a weight was
off my shoulders."
When the leaders broke from
the main pack, Riley went with
them, eventually passing the race
favorites in a dramatic final 100
meters for the NCAA title.
Riley has run with some of Stan
ford's greatest all-time runners, in
addition to being one of them.
He says he has been inspired by
senior Gabe Jennings's passion for
racing and by alumnus Brad
Mauser's model of consistency and
hard work.
"When he got to the starting
line, you knew he was going to get
the job done," said Riley of
Hauser. "He showed what it
means to go out there and com

pete even when you're not having
your best day."
Riley has exemplified that
competitiveness and passed it on
to the new generation of Stanford
runners.
"He runs so well consistently
and he's so tough mentally," said
sophomore lan Dobson. "He's the
epitome of a tough competitor,
showing that not everything has to
be perfect to run well."
As evidence, Riley ran a
13:40.52 in the 5,000 meters with
nobody to push him in bis first race
of this season. It was his first colle
giate race of the season after being
forced to sit out the cross country
and indoor track seasons due to el
igibility reasons.
Riley has been an invaluable
contributor to some of Stan
ford's most spectacular, and un
expected, victories. Whether
toppling defending champion

Arkansas in cross country in
1997, winning the National
Outdoor Track Championship
in 2000, or surprising everyone
with a victory in the 2001 Pacific
10 Conference Championships,
Riley has been a point-scorer
and a leader.
Repeating as conference cham
pions will be no easy task for the
Cardinal, but Riley's view of the
team's aggressive training sched
ule and early-season success has
him optimistic.
"The Pac-10's are the measure
of how good a complete team is,
and this year's team is better across
the board than it's ever been,"
Riley said.
Next up for the Cardinal track
squad is the prestigious Penn Re
lays, held in Philadelphia this
weekend. Riley and company will
continue the hunt for personal
bests and NCAA qualifiers.
