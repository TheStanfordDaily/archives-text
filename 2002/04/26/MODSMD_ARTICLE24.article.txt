# Lacrosse readies to play Cal, Davis

A team realizes its potential
when it learns to play its own
game, regardless of what kind of
opponent comes its way.
The Cardinal lacrosse team
learned this important lesson hist
weekend when it traveled to the East
(bast to take on Boston College and
the University of New Hampshire.
It now hopes to capitalize on this
new found knowledge in its final two
regular-season games.
A year after returning home
from the East Coast defeated by
Boston College and New Hamp
shire, the Cardinal came out vic
torious against the Golden Eagles
13-10, and within a goal of tying
the Wildcats.
The team will need to keep the
same type of intensity up when it
plays this weekend against two of
its West Coast rivals. Stanford will
take on California at Berkeley
this Saturday at 2 p.m. and then
UC-Davis next Tuesday at 7 p.m.
at New Maloney Field.
And when the Cardinal takes
on the Golden Bears and the Ag
gies, it will have to keep in mind
many of the positives that
stemmed from last weekend's
matchups.
According to head coach

Michele Uhlfelder, the key to the
Boston College game was
putting together a solid f>() min
utes of play.
"Everything we had prepared
to do came full-circle, and the
scoreboard indicated it,"
Uhlfelder said.
Furthermore, the New Hamp
shire game might have been lost
due to a lack of mental prepara
tion. With a goal only 28 seconds
into the game by freshman at
tacker Julia Calzonetti, Stanford
may have become overconfident.
Still, all was not lost with the
outcome of the game since a
tough lesson was learned. Ac
cording to Uhlfelder, the Cardi
nal builds its philosophy around
coming out to play every game
with a beginner's mindset, with
the attitude that every game is a
chance for the team to work to
gether and play its best, regard
less of the opponent. She also
cited the lack of this mindset as

the main reason for the loss against
New Hampshire.
However, the most important
outcome of the weekend was nei
ther the win nor the loss. Rather, it
was the opportunity for the team
to play to its own standard and ex
ecute its game plan regardless of

the other team.
In addition, each Stanford play
er was able to witness each other's
potential and take pride in seeing
each other's improvement.
"We came together as a team,"
said sophomore defender Katie
Grube. "Although [last] weekend
had its ups and downs, it showed
us what we can do."
Technically, success this week
end will lie in Stanford's ability to
control ground balls and draws,

which translate into controlling
momentum, and therefore, the
outcome of the game. Above all,
the Cardinal hopes that, like it did
in the game against Boston Col
lege, it will be able to connect for 00
minutes of solid play.
No matter who the opponent
may be, the goals for the team re
main the same.
"It doesn't matter who we're
playing as long as we play our
game," Uhlfelder said.
