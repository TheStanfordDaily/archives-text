# Women's water polo goes to L.A. for MPSF Tourney
## 
### KIMBERLY ROBERTS STAFF WRITER 
The No. 2 Cardinal women's water
polo team's strong performances
throughout the regular season have
earned it the No. 1 seed in this week
end's Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation tournament. Ironically, it is
seeded higher than nationally top
ranked UCLA.
The highly competitive 12-team tour
nament will include the top-seven teams
in the nation, all vying for the automatic
NCAA bid awarded to the winner. I'he
field will include the Bruins, co-No. 2
USC, Stanford and No. A California,
which were all bunched together at the
top of the standings in regular-season
conference play.
Despite the Cardinal's loss to USC
earlier in the year, the No. 1 tournament
seed came down to a goal-differential
tiebreaker because the top three teams
had all exchanged losses. The Cardinal
edged out the Trojans, winning the
tiebreaker by one goal.
Behind USC is UCLA with the No. 3
seed. Followed by UCLA will be No. 4
California , No. 5 Long Beach State, No.
0 San Jose State, No. 7 San Diego State,

Today-Sunday: No. 2 Stanford
will compete at the MPSF Champi
onships in Los Angeles

No. 8 Hawaii, No. 9 UC-Santa Barbara,
No: 10 UC-Irvine, No. 11 Pacific and No.
12 Cal State-Nortliridge.
Tournament play begins on Friday
at the McDonald's Swim Stadium on
the campus of USC. In first-round ac
tion, defending MPSF champion
Stanford will receive a bye and then
play the winner of Hawaii and UC-
Santa Barbara.
USC, UCLA and Cal also received
first-game byes.
On Saturday, in the tournament semi
finals, Stanford will most likely face Cali
fornia and then, should the tournament
continue to go by seeding, the Cardinal
will face either USC or UCIA in the
championship game.
Earlier this year, Stanford defeated
UCI A in MPSF play but lost to USC in a
tight 7-6 battle on March 30.
Last week, UCIA defeated USC,
which resulted in the Bruins taking the
top spot in the nation, but the Car
dinal garnering the top seed in the
conference.
In addition to the No. 1 seed,
Stanford goes into this confer
ence tournament with three

MPSF Players of the Week this
season — sophomore Brenda
Villa, junior Julie Gardner and
senior Ellen F.stes. Gardner was
named Player of the Week after
she scored three goals in Stan
ford's last game against UCLA.
Estes received the award after she
scored four goals last weekend.
Villa has been the scoring
leader of the team this year, with

51 goals in only 20 games. Her
goals have also come in very cru
cial situations. She scored the
game-winning goal against UCLA
in February and scored two goals
against the Bruins the last time the
two teams met.
Overall, Stanford has outscored
its opponents 212-72 and will look
to increase that differential this
weekend in Los Angeles.
