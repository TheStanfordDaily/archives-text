### HELEN KIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates
entertained a packed Kresge Audi
torium yesterday during a discus
sion about Microsoft's technologi
cal developments.
"Of the top four people at Mi
crosoft, three of them went to Stan
ford," Gates said. "I, of course, am
the one who didn't."
For the first 40 minutes, Gates
discussed such topics as the birth of
Microsoft, the increasing potential
of the PC, Microsoft's business
challenges, new products and con
cerns. Then University President
John Hennessy posed several
questions to Gates and the two en
gaged in a one-on-one forum.
The discussion culminated with
questions from the audience.
"I enjoy going to work, working
with very smart people on very
complex problems," Gates said as a
closing remark.
But the evening opened with a
more serious discussion about Mi
crosoft and the increasing poten
tial of personal computers.
Microsoft was founded in Albu

querque, N.M. in 1975. At the
company's inception there were
only 16 employees.
Fifty percent of American
homes have PCs, which are the
most important tools of empower
ment, Gates said. He also noted
that if PCs contributed to advance
ments in medicine, even that
would be enough to make a signif
icant impact.
"We're really just at the begin
ning," Gates said. "Right now, PCs
are not that effective ... By the
end of this decade, the amount of
things that can be done will dra
matically increase.
"For instance, music can be
recorded and listened to in several
different forms. The other day, my
daughter and 1 were taking a walk
downtown and we passed by a
record store. She asked me,
'What's a record?'
"Ten years from now, we won't
think about CDs because there will
be much better ways of formatting
our music."
He continued, "there was a
paradox in the original founding
of Microsoft. We stated that we
would place a computer in every

home, yet we had no more than 15
employees and said that we might
double the number of employees
at the most."
Gates said that those who say we
are now living a "Web services
dream," the prototype of that
being e-commerce, are incorrect.
Gates mentioned that he found e
commerce to be more inefficient
than it should be.
"There's more effort spent in
moving the work around than in
doing the work itself, such as im
proving customer service,"
Gates said.
Later, Gates presented a few in
novative products in show-and
tell format. The first one, which
looks like a computer notebook,
doubles as an electronic writing
"tablet."
This new product represented
Gates' interest in handwriting
recognition technology.
Gates also displayed a phone
type device that acts as a phone
and a mini-computer with a rich
color screen. With this product,
one can call a friend, browse the
