# Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates gives technology talk
## 
### HELEN KIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates
entertained a packed Kresge Audi
torium yesterday during a discus
sion about Microsoft's technologi
cal developments.
"Of the top four people at Mi
crosoft, three of them went to Stan
ford," Gates said. "I, of course, am
the one who didn't."
For the first 40 minutes, Gates
discussed such topics as the birth of
Microsoft, the increasing potential
of the PC, Microsoft's business
challenges, new products and con
cerns. Then University President
John Hennessy posed several
questions to Gates and the two en
gaged in a one-on-one forum.
The discussion culminated with
questions from the audience.
"I enjoy going to work, working
with very smart people on very
complex problems," Gates said as a
closing remark.
But the evening opened with a
more serious discussion about Mi
crosoft and the increasing poten
tial of personal computers.
Microsoft was founded in Albu

querque, N.M. in 1975. At the
company's inception there were
only 16 employees.
Fifty percent of American
homes have PCs, which are the
most important tools of empower
ment, Gates said. He also noted
that if PCs contributed to advance
ments in medicine, even that
would be enough to make a signif
icant impact.
"We're really just at the begin
ning," Gates said. "Right now, PCs
are not that effective ... By the
end of this decade, the amount of
things that can be done will dra
matically increase.
"For instance, music can be
recorded and listened to in several
different forms. The other day, my
daughter and 1 were taking a walk
downtown and we passed by a
record store. She asked me,
'What's a record?'
"Ten years from now, we won't
think about CDs because there will
be much better ways of formatting
our music."
He continued, "there was a
paradox in the original founding
of Microsoft. We stated that we
would place a computer in every

home, yet we had no more than 15
employees and said that we might
double the number of employees
at the most."
Gates said that those who say we
are now living a "Web services
dream," the prototype of that
being e-commerce, are incorrect.
Gates mentioned that he found e
commerce to be more inefficient
than it should be.
"There's more effort spent in
moving the work around than in
doing the work itself, such as im
proving customer service,"
Gates said.
Later, Gates presented a few in
novative products in show-and
tell format. The first one, which
looks like a computer notebook,
doubles as an electronic writing
"tablet."
This new product represented
Gates' interest in handwriting
recognition technology.
Gates also displayed a phone
type device that acts as a phone
and a mini-computer with a rich
color screen. With this product,
one can call a friend, browse the

screen and exchange menus and
maps — all at the same time. Its ca
pability for voice recognition high
lights Gates' belief that this decade
will bring many more surprising
technologies.
Gates said he was disappointed
in the reduction of commercial re
search and wants to encourage
leading universities to do funda
mental research that he finds nec
essary fora software company.
According to Gates, PCs have
only recently had the capability to
self-monitor, allowing software
companies to receive feedback
from individual computers with
problems. He finds this key to
making improvements in software
so programs will be more user
friendly and easier to handle.
Gates admitted that security is
among the challenges facing Mi
crosoft.
"[The issue of security] is very
broad and tough, but if we don't
solve it, it may hold back the real
ization of dreams," Gates said.
Gates also said he thinks that

passwords are ineffective methods
of maintaining security. Passwords
can be easily cracked and people
often use the same password for
many non-secure sites, he said.
"This decade is the most inter
esting one the software industry's
ever had," Gates said. "These next
few years will have breadth of im
pact and intellectual vigor."
Gates' one-on-one forum with
Hennessy followed his speech,
fhe discussion posed issues con
cerning illegal possession of music
on computers, the consumer
broadband dichotomy and tech
nology on the horizon.
Gates said he opposed PC soft
ware that would detect illegal
music and send a report to the au
thorities.
"We don't think it's appropriate
for PC manufacturers to be forced
to have that kind of software,"
Gates said.
Hennessy then pointed out that
his office computer is extremely
fast and getting faster, yet when he
goes home, his computer there is
slow by contrast.
"You'll have to move on cam
pus," Gates said.
Gates then stressed that high
costs for broadband access will

never lead to more than 15 per
cent of the population using
broadband. According to Gates,
Korea's broadband costs are down
to about $20 a month and one-half
of all households in Korea have
broadband.
Student reaction to the conver
sation seemed positive.
"I think he definitely had some
interesting comments," said
sophomore Tim Liu. "He had a
very sweeping vision of where
technology was headed."
Senior Jon Wu expressed a sim
ilar sentiment.
"He touched on a lot of things,"
Wu said. "It will be interesting to
see what happens."
During the final minutes of the
conversation, Gates said the inte
gration of speech software with
handwriting software and phone
technology with computers will
bring the next evolutionary step
in technology. He envisions that
such prospects will catch on in
China and Japan, where the key
board is a disadvantage.
"1 think there will be a lot of
progress that will surprise many
people even in the next two years,"
Gates said. The audience respond
ed with an explosion of applause.

with very smart people on very
complex problems," Gates said as a
closing remark.
But the evening opened with a
more serious discussion about Mi
crosoft and the increasing poten
tial of personal computers.
Microsoft was founded in Albu

querque, N.M. in 1975. At the
company's inception there were
only 16 employees.
Fifty percent of American
homes have PCs, which are the
most important tools of empower
ment, Gates said. He also noted
that if PCs contributed to advance
ments in medicine, even that
would be enough to make a signif
icant impact.
"We're really just at the begin
ning," Gates said. "Right now, PCs
are not that effective ... By the
end of this decade, the amount of
things that can be done will dra
matically increase.
"For instance, music can be
recorded and listened to in several
different forms. The other day, my
daughter and 1 were taking a walk
downtown and we passed by a
record store. She asked me,
'What's a record?'
"Ten years from now, we won't
think about CDs because there will
be much better ways of formatting
our music."
He continued, "there was a
paradox in the original founding
of Microsoft. We stated that we
would place a computer in every

home, yet we had no more than 15
employees and said that we might
double the number of employees
at the most."
Gates said that those who say we
are now living a "Web services
dream," the prototype of that
being e-commerce, are incorrect.
Gates mentioned that he found e
commerce to be more inefficient
than it should be.
"There's more effort spent in
moving the work around than in
doing the work itself, such as im
proving customer service,"
Gates said.
Later, Gates presented a few in
novative products in show-and
tell format. The first one, which
looks like a computer notebook,
doubles as an electronic writing
"tablet."
This new product represented
Gates' interest in handwriting
recognition technology.
Gates also displayed a phone
type device that acts as a phone
and a mini-computer with a rich
color screen. With this product,

screen and exchange menus and
maps — all at the same time. Its ca
pability for voice recognition high
lights Gates' belief that this decade
will bring many more surprising
technologies.
Gates said he was disappointed
in the reduction of commercial re
search and wants to encourage
leading universities to do funda
mental research that he finds nec
essary fora software company.
According to Gates, PCs have
only recently had the capability to
self-monitor, allowing software
companies to receive feedback
from individual computers with
problems. He finds this key to
making improvements in software
so programs will be more user
friendly and easier to handle.
Gates admitted that security is
among the challenges facing Mi
crosoft.
"[The issue of security] is very
broad and tough, but if we don't
solve it, it may hold back the real
ization of dreams," Gates said.
Gates also said he thinks that

passwords are ineffective methods
of maintaining security. Passwords
can be easily cracked and people
often use the same password for
many non-secure sites, he said.
"This decade is the most inter
esting one the software industry's
ever had," Gates said. "These next
few years will have breadth of im
pact and intellectual vigor."
Gates' one-on-one forum with
Hennessy followed his speech,
fhe discussion posed issues con
cerning illegal possession of music
on computers, the consumer
broadband dichotomy and tech
nology on the horizon.
Gates said he opposed PC soft
ware that would detect illegal
music and send a report to the au
thorities.
"We don't think it's appropriate
for PC manufacturers to be forced
to have that kind of software,"
Gates said.
Hennessy then pointed out that
his office computer is extremely
fast and getting faster, yet when he
goes home, his computer there is
slow by contrast.
"You'll have to move on cam
pus," Gates said.
Gates then stressed that high
costs for broadband access will

never lead to more than 15 per
cent of the population using
broadband. According to Gates,
Korea's broadband costs are down
to about $20 a month and one-half
of all households in Korea have
broadband.
Student reaction to the conver
sation seemed positive.
"I think he definitely had some
interesting comments," said
sophomore Tim Liu. "He had a
very sweeping vision of where
technology was headed."
Senior Jon Wu expressed a sim
ilar sentiment.
"He touched on a lot of things,"
Wu said. "It will be interesting to
see what happens."
During the final minutes of the
conversation, Gates said the inte
gration of speech software with
handwriting software and phone
technology with computers will
bring the next evolutionary step
in technology. He envisions that
such prospects will catch on in
China and Japan, where the key
board is a disadvantage.
"1 think there will be a lot of
progress that will surprise many
people even in the next two years,"
Gates said. The audience respond
ed with an explosion of applause.
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates
entertained a packed Kresge Audi
torium yesterday during a discus
sion about Microsoft's technologi
cal developments.
"Of the top four people at Mi
crosoft, three of them went to Stan
ford," Gates said. "I, of course, am
the one who didn't."
For the first 40 minutes, Gates
discussed such topics as the birth of
Microsoft, the increasing potential
of the PC, Microsoft's business
challenges, new products and con
cerns. Then University President
John Hennessy posed several
questions to Gates and the two en
gaged in a one-on-one forum.
The discussion culminated with
questions from the audience.
