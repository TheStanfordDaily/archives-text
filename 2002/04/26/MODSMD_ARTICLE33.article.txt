Tweedy's music can always captivate.
An homage to the "Chelsea Hotel," the famed New York
City hangout for '60s creative bohemia, "Chelsea Walls" at
tempts to convey life during the hotel's peak.
Despite Tweedy's reputation, this soundtrack is for
diehards. This collection of mostly instrumental songs will

only appeal to those who've already tacked two "Chelsea
Walls" posters in their room or those who've spun a burned

copy of the new Wilco record for over a year. In short,
don't expect "O, Brother Where 'Art Thou?" or even
"Shrek." Instead think Neil Young's "Dead Man" or
Jerry Garcia's "Smoke."
Equally eerie, engaging and gorgeous, Tweedy's
instrumental compositions likely will provide the per
fect accompaniment to Hawke's picture. However,
pop music fans will relegate these songs to background

music. This is no insult to Tweedy's songwriting, as he
penned these tracks for the movie. They simply cannot
stand on their own.
But, the soundtrack's main appeal lies between Tweedy's
wordless arrangements. The album features one new Wilco
song, an unreleased track from Billy Bragg and Wilco's
"Mermaid Avenue" sessions, star Robert Sean Leonard cov
ering a beauty form Wilco's "Being There," a William
Thompson song and a jazzy version of' John Lennon's "Jeal
ous Guy."
"Promising," the new Wilco tune, recalls the bands AM
era. A slow, acoustic number, the track typifies Tweedy's
ability to turn a seemingly unremarkable country song into
something special. The opening line —"Cross your fingers
behind your back / Squeeze mine until they crack / I must
have known that you were just promising" — reflects a lyri
cist capable of documenting a strange but honest America.
Although Bragg and Wilco passed over "When The
Roses Bloom Again" for both "Mermaid Avenue" albums,
the song remains delightful. The combination of Woodie
Guthrie's lyrics and Tweedy's arrangements again synthe
size to create folk music to rival any decade's.
"Chelsea Walls" lead Robert Sean Leonard sings on two
tracks that sound professional and surprisingly good. Of the
two, "The Lonely 1" is the better since "Softly And Tender
ly Jesus Is Calling" ends before it develops. "The Lonely 1"
uncannily recalls the version Wilco recorded on its 1996
sophomore release. However, the song is so beautiful that
this similarity doesn't harm, and Leonard thankfully keeps
his voice within his limits.

In contrast, Jimmy Scott's rendition of "Jealous Guy" re
tains only the lyrics from Lennon's original recording. Scott
arranges an old-fashioned jazz song with traces of Billie Hol
iday or Ella Fitzgerald over an irresistible piano. This ver
sion erases all the history and bitterness between Lennon
and McCartney and instead highlights the heartfelt apolo
gy tucked into the song; "I was feeling insecure / You might
not love me anymore/ I was shivering inside / 1 didn't mean
to hurt you / I'm sorry that I made you cry / I'm just a jeal
ous guy."
Out on Rykodisc records, this soundtrack marks
Tweedy's first solo release. Like many soundtracks, most of
these songs appear out of context without the images; how
ever, unlike many soundtracks, the other five tracks make
this album worth buying. Especially for extreme fans.
