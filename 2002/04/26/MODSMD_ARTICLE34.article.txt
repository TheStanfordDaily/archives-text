# London-based Cornershop returns with new album

Any album review
worth its byline has to
have at least a few sen
tences crammed with
slick, glossy descriptors
and well-constructed
references to the
band's proper influ-

ences in the grand musical spectrum. I'm a
little new at this, so permit me to lift a line

from this album's press release: "Corner
shop's 'Handcream fora Generation' is the

sound of Booker T and the
MGs landing right in the mid
dle of the 21st century, led by a
man who increasingly seems
like some kind of Lou Reed/
Bob Marley hybrid."
Maybe. I'm not sure what
that means, but the man re-

ferred to here is singer / songwriter Tjinder
Singh, whose personality and stylings seem

to be responsible for most of what the
London-based Cornershop embodies.
That isn't meant to downplay the roles
of guitarists Ben Ayres and Anthony
Saffery, or Nick Simms's drums and
Peter Bengry's percussion. But Singh
— a Sikh born in England — did write
and produce all 13 tracks on this album,
and it's his smooth, round voice that
ushers us through most of the cuts here.
Cornershop's music, like Singh's
background, is in general a unique
amalgamation of several different
genres — all of them made appeal
ing. Its previous album, "When 1 was
Born for the 7th Time," was widely
appreciated for its fusion of Indian
and hip-hop with antiracist messages.
I can't really tell how political this disc
is — Singh seems to fill many songs
with nothing more than catchy non
sequiturs — but the diversity is defi-

nitely there.
The tracks range from ska
based (the opening "Heavy
Soup") to techno-disco ("Music
Plus 1") to the lilting rap of "Wogs
Will Walk" to the Beatles-esque
sitar playing sprinkled through
out. Even the infectious, more
rock-friendly "Staging the Plagu
ing of the Raised Platform" has a
few unique layers, synths and a
children's chorus that you won't
be expecting.
Despite its amazing range of
sounds, however, there are a few
moments of stagnation in some of
the longer cuts — primarily the
techno ones that, like all techno
ones, don't have anywhere to go.
The most blatant, however, has to
be the 14-minute opus "Spectral
Mornings," with guest Oasis
member Noel Gallagher. Begin-

ning with a catchy sitar hook and Singh's
oddly compelling singing in a foreign
tongue, it gradually wears out its welcome. If
this seems a bit self-indulgent, though, be
thankful you missed the 24-hour mix of the
track that Cornershop broadcasted online a
few months ago.
On the whole, though, the music is pleas
antly inspired. "Motion the 11" has an easy
going groove, and"The London Radar" is an
amusing mix of airline-themed voice samples

set to a dance beat. The first single of the
album — "Lessons Learned from Rocky I to
Rocky III" —is a well-constructed ode to
1970s rock that disappoints only in its failure
to demonstrate the true flavor of the band's
eclectic sound. Personally, I'd love to hear
"Staging the Plaguing of the Raised Plat
form" on the radio, and see Cornershop's
idiosyncratic rhythms mixing it up on our
overplayed radio waves.


Oh my God! Samus from "Metroid!"
