# Punk forefather Hell stands die test of 'Time'

### KAREEM GHANEM 
Perhaps the most distinguishing
characteristic of Richard Hell's
voice is the intense loneliness in
which it is soaked. His songs aren't
necessarily depressing, but they
certainly reflect the mind of a man
who defies those who seek to un
derstand his motives or identity.

As one of the most underappreciated figures of the
New York City punk movement of the late '70s, Hell's
recordings are some of the most obscure of that era.
Nonetheless, his legacy is tremendous, as he was a found
ing member of Television (though he left before the
group recorded its debut). Lesser known, however, are
his recordings with the Heartbreakers, a group he
formed with New York Dolls' guitarist Johnny Thunders,
and the Voidoids. "Time," a double CD release from
Matador, culls tracks from both bands to serve as a sort of
retrospective document. Consisting mainly of demos, un
released versions of his songs and live sets, the collection
is a definitive statement of Hell's status as a seminal figure
in modern music.
Songs like "Love Comes in Spurts" and "Can't Keep
My Eyes On You" reveal Hell's knack for twisted, raw
flashes of pop enlightenment. Addled by heroin addiction

throughout the majority of his career (he was, after all, in
a band with junk king Johnny Thunders) he was some-

thing of a damaged intellectual â€” a mangy,
ragged Beatnik fora new generation. "Chinese
Rocks," a previously unreleased track that Hell

penned with Dee Dee Ramone (since the
Ramones reportedly refused to do a song
about heroin), is a gnarled, manic and rel
atively autobiographical overture to the
substance that consumed both men.

The live tracks also give you a good sense of the
mentality behind Hell's music. They are loud,
fuzzed-out, cacophonous, bruising and beautiful.
On a cover of "I Wanna Be Your Dog," Hell debuts
his sociopathic Iggy Pop alter-ego. Later in that set,
he and the Voidoids turn the Rolling Stones' "Ven
tilator Blues" on its head, mutilating its chords with
a sloppiness worthy of the Stooges. The guitar work
gets a little cleaner during the last four songs, taken
from a set with Elvis Costello.
That said, though, the true gem of this collection
is its title track, "Time," which appears on the first
disc. More than "New Pleasure" or "Blank Genera
tion," "Time" is Hell's ultimate statement, ft crystal
lizes the man's intellectual impetus in its penetrat
ing lyrics: "It seems you see the most of what is real
ly true when you're stepping into your hearse /

Only time tan write a song that's really really real / The
most a man can do is say the way its playing feels / And
know he only knows as much as time to him reveals." In
deed, for better or worse, time will be the final arbiter of
Richard Hell's genius.
