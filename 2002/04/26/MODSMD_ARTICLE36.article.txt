dio band, Booker T and the MGs, Young
embarks on a journey that shows be is not

afraid to sail unchart
ed seas. Young has
consistently under
gone makeovers. Re
member in 1995
when he went grunge
touring with rockers
such as Pearl Jam and

released "Mirror Ball?"
In 1993, Young toured
extensively with the MGs,
but his latest release
marks his first studio ven
ture with the group.
The influence of the
MGs is no illusion on the
album. In fact, almost
three songs contain vari
ation of the classic bass
line from MG classic,
"Time is Tight." The
album's opening track,
"You're My Girl," literal
ly takes the guitar riff
from Otis Redding's "I
Can't Turn You Loose"
so as to cause no confu
sion. The effect is
sparkling. Coupled with
Young's classic lead gui
tar and the tight fusion
of the MG sound created
by bassist Donald "Duck"
Dunn (he was in the
filues Brothers), drum
mer Steve "Smokey"
Potts and Booker T him
self on keyboard, the
song creates a mystic toe
tapping groove.
"Differently" follows in
this tradition, but leans
more in the way of
Young's progressive rock

roots. It harks back to his
"Southern Man" days,
emanating with his
trademarked brand of
slightly moody and in
tense rock.
Although the afore
mentioned tracks are in
teresting and well-done,
the best tracks of the
album are unsurprising
ly the ones in which
Young sticks to what he
does best — rocking out.
Songs such as "Let's
Roll" and "Going
Home" show that the old
Young still can rock and
do it pretty darn well at
that. Inspired by the
words of Todd Beamer,
a passenger on Flight 93
during the Sept. 11 at
tacks, "Let's Roll" starts
off with a ringing cell
phone symbolic of the

one Beamer used to call his wife. Young
then launches into a funky Crazy Horse
style riff and proclaims, "I got to put the
phone down and do what we got to do /
Time is money / Let's roll." The song dri
ves ahead, rocking hard to stay true to the
spirit to the brave souls of United Airlines
Flight 93. "Going Home" sounds like clas
sic Neil Young, making the listener won
der if it is really 2002. Maybe that is be
cause Young is joined by the entire Crazy
Horse (Young's traditional backing band)
lineup on the track. Either way, the song
is a definite gem. Powered by dirty guitar
riffs and heavy pounding bass, Young
belts out his traditional pensive vocals, oc
casionally stopping to bust into guitar
solos that sound like a coyote howling into
the desert sky.
"Are You Passionate?" is what one

would expect from a man who rarely re
leases albums that suck. Young's dip into
the arena of soul is successful for the most
part. His bluesy guitar and preoccupied
vocals gives a new twist to the classic
sound of Booker T and the MGs. Howev
er, because the MGs overuse themes from
"Time is light," some songs begin to
sound the same. This can be easily over
looked because the album doesn't let the
listener down for too long, always finding
a funky groove to rock with. "Are You
Passionate?" is best summed up in the
final track, which includes every musical
element possible. Ranging from Booker
T-style grooves to Young's cherished clas
sic rock accompanied by interludes of
piano and saxophone, Young brings it all
home showing that he really is the elder
statesman of rock 'n' roll.
