# Silverberg finds the key to immortality in his writing
## 
### ANTHONY HA 
From the late '60s to the late '70s, one
of the most intensely productive figures in
literary science fiction was Robert Silver
berg. He churned out several books a
year, perhaps because of the dictates of
the market, but by most reports many of

tliese novels were daring and brilliant.
Unfortunately, this brilliance did not equate to sides, and the
works of his early period have long been out of print. Starting
with reprints of "Nightwings" and what is generally acknowl
edged to his best novel, the haunting "Dying Inside," ibooks has
started to rectify this error. Though 1 wish that ibcxik's art de
partment hadn't slapped such a garish, ugly picture on die cover,
I'm mainly glad that "Dying Inside" is available again.
From the beginning, this story of a middle-aged telepath
gradually losing liis powers defies both reader expectation and
easy interpretation. liX)king at the title, one pictures a dark,
melodramatic novel of loss, but David Seleg, die protagonist,
narrates his story with self-deprecating, sarcastic humor and ini-

Sure, his extraordinary ability to read minds is fading, but he

hasn't made too much ofit or himself in die first place —
Seleg makes his living writing term papers for j(x:ks at Co
lumbia University; die only other significant use he
makes of his power is to seduce women.
There are moments of intense joy, sorrow and anger as

ments, particularly a mind-blowing scene in which Seleg
as a boy hops from the mind of a bee to that of a teenage girl in
the middle of copulation, to that of her partner, to that ofa trout,
to diat of an old farmer, are often the novel's most memorable.
But in the "present" of the novel (1976, four years after "Dying
Inside" 's initial publication) feels only like the resigned sigh of a
man who has accepted an inevitable feet of life, no more tragic
than die gradual loss of his hair. Why are we reading this?
Yet 1, at least, couldn't stop. Seleg may be a lazy, shiftless bas
tard (ah, a man after my own heart), but he's also chatty, bitchy
and entertaining. He's filled widi self-pity, but he knows it and
mocks himself for it.
And by the end <)f the first chapter, the reader already realizes

that David Seleg has not one, but two extraordinary gifts — his
telepadiy, of course, but also a fierce, angry intelligence — that
do not enhance each odier but rather cancel each other out. As
the first talent dies, the second emerges and starts to shake the
sleep from its dormant Ixxly. .And as defeated as Seleg and the
reader feel about die ultimate death of his telepathy, there is also
a growing sense of joy as Seleg, his crutch removed, again begins
to interact widi die world around him.
It may Ix* t«) simple to observe the similarities between
Robert Silverberg and David Seleg — they were born iti die
same year, diey both had troubled childhoods and they are per
haps t(x> smart for their own good — and say diat diey are die
same person, but die autobiographical connection between au
thor and character must have something to do widi die complex
and unforgettable inner life that illuminates and filters every
thing we see. John Clute suggests in his excellent introduction
diat Silverberg may himselfhave had a great, terrible gift (his pre
cociousness) that he needed to escape from in order to write a
Ixxik as moving and human as "Dying Inside."
like Seleg, Silveiherg may have discovered diat after some
kinds of death conies rebirth.
