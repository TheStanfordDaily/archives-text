# Film educates about the music biz

### KAREEM GHANEM 
Narrated by Sonic Youth singer Thurston Moore,
"Money for Nothing" does a convincing job of elucidating
the way that the record industry has evolved and the way in
which its domination by a lew giant corporations affects
personal expression in modern times. Over the past centu
ry, popular music has come to be thought of as a medium
lor independent thought and artistic creation. The testi
mony of the artists and experts in "Money for Nothing,"
however, shows how dramatically things have changed
over the past two decades. The point of the documentary
isn't to indoctrinate (()K, maybe it is), but rather to educate.
From the voices of several respected independent musi
cians, the film documents how the profit motive is corrupt
ing our culture.
Those interviewed include hip-hop pioneer Chuck 1),
neo-folk singer Ani DiFranco, Kathleen Hanna (of Le
Tigre and formerly Bikini Kill) and Michael Franti of the
influential San Francisco group Spearhead. From the
mouths of each of these musicians comes a different per
spective on how dangerous corporate monopolies 011 cul-

ture are. As the film describes, five
kingpin companies, which ac
count for over HO percent of
record sales worldwide, rule the
record industry. Of these, two or
three are multi-media entities,
whose holdings include Internet
corporations, television stations
and radio stations.
In short, this allows corpo
rations to maximize their profits
by utilizing cross-media market
ing to sell their products to the
masses. Since each company has
the same motive, they imitate each
other, resulting in musical confor
mity on the airwaves. Very telling
ly, the film cycles through images
of Jessica Simpson, Christina
Aguilera, Britney Spears and
Mandy Moore, illustrating their
identical appearances and music.

As ex-Rolling Stone editor 1 )ave Marsh says,"The nature of mo
nopoly is to recreate itself in its own likeness, not to innovate."
Also vexing is the integration of the music industry into a
greater corporate infrastructure of marketing, advertising and
promotional mechanisms that make it more dillicult lor inde
pendent artists to get exposure. As Robert McChesney, a politi
cal economist, points out, many of America's favorite musicians
would lind it impossible to succeed in today's cutthroat business
climate. He offers the example of Bruce Springsteen, whose first
two albums Hopped before he found a niche and an audience.
Today, if an artist like Springsteen had two Hopped albums, the
record company would almost immediately dump him.
Though I was certainly receptive to the film's message from
the outset, it left me with a bit of an anti-corporate kick. I
couldn't wait to head to Amoeba and pick up a Fuga/.i album.
The documentary's only weakness is the narration of Thurston
Moore, who seems a bit monotone and didactic at times (sheesh,
he's almost bad enough to teach Economics at Stanford!).
Nonetheless, it is incredibly powerful to hear the truth come out
of the mouths of musicians who are widely respected and ad
mired. "Money for Nothing" is certainly worth your time if you
have the opportunity to come across it in the future.
