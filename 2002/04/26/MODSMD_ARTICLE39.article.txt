# Goo Goo's latest is a dud

### ANTHONY HA 
Ever since the mid-'9os suc
cess of the single "Name," the
Goo Goo Dolls have tried to
strike an uneasy balance be
tween the louder, rougher rock
that the band started out playing
and the smooth, predictable pop
that seems to fuel its commercial

The Goo Goo H.
Dolls mJ
"Gutterflower" (W
Warner Bros.

success. I can remember vocalist / guitarist John Rzeznik
protesting a few years ago on the Kevin and Bean show' that
"Name" wasn't an accurate representation of the band's
sound, yet the Goos followed "Name" with "Iris" and "Slide,"
two radio-friendly sound-alike singles that predictably obeyed
"Name'"s formula. And after last year releasing "What I
Learned About Ego, Opinion, Ait and Commerce (1987-
2000)," a retrospective emphasizing the band's early work, the
Goos have now come out with "Gutterflower," an album com
prised almost entirely of soulless "Name" clones.
If I'm being a bit harsh on what is essentially a CD of earnest
but undistinguished songs, it's only because I used to think that
this kind of crap actually constituted intelligent, soulliil music.
Sure, if a song from "Gutterflower" Is playing in the background
and you only received a vague impression of Rzeznik's yearning
voice and the melancholy guitars, you might be tricked into
thinking that the songs are actually about something other than
perpetuating the band's pose of artistic, romantic sensitivity.
But you would only be fooled until you listened closely and
realized that the lyrics rehash the same themes over and over
in predictable, generic ways — there's always the lonely, sen
sitive guy dreaming about the misguided girl. Every lyric is
drawn in the same broad strokes and feels thuddingly obvious.
Despite the band's occasionally grand, yearning tones, there's

no real depth here.
Not that my major complaint
about the Goos is that they're phony
— plenty of good rock can come out
of artists maintaining entirely man
ufactured personas — but rather,
that the role the Goos play is so
damn boring. They don't do pre
tend to be anything nearly as inter
esting as Marilyn Manson's cartoon
Goth, Kylie Minogue's strutting sex
goddess or the gleefully plastic
Backstreet Boys. Instead, they're
posing as sensitive, caring guys
who've seen their share of romantic
angst. In other words, they're play-

ing exactly the same role as an infinite number of other
mediocre pop-rock bands out there right now.

I don't care that the Cms aren't "real." I dislike their
music because it's completely uninteresting. 1 haven't
heard the band's early work, so 1 can't honestly say if it was
much better, but regardless, "Gutterflower" is pure for
mulaic pop-rock, unfortunately the kind of pretentious
tripe that passes for "alternative rock" these days. If you've
heard a Goo Goo Dolls song on the radio before, then you
should instantly recognize the eight Rzeznik-penned

tracks on "Gutterflower"— vague lyrics set to predictable
melodies, all cloyingly slick from overproduction and sung in
Rzeznik's pseudo-angst-ridden voice.
'Hie four songs written and sung by bassist Robby Takac are
marginally better, ifonly because they're faster and Takac's voice
is coarser and more memorable than Rzeznik's generic sensitive
pretty-boy wails, but they still don't justify shelling over any cash
for this album.
Every song blurs into the other and Rzeznik's "woe-is-me" cry
holds steady and unchanging from track to track. In short, the
Goo Goo Dolls lade into the mass of sound-alike bands playing
on the radio, bands with just-slightly-melancholy love songs all
sung in the same tone, a tone they'd probably like to think of as
earnest yearning.
If nothing else, "Name" had a great melody, making it a
guilty pleasure and perhaps even something more. "Gutter
flower"'s tracks don't even have that. All of them go down
smoothly and sound decent (in other words, I didn't go com
pletely insane while listening to this album), but there's noth
ing particularly memorable about any of their hooks or
melodies; they all display the same bland innocuousness that
has become the band's trademark.
The only track approaching standout status is What a Scene,"
a song louder and gratifyingly less polished than anything else on

the album. While singing of the artifi
ciality of pop lifestyles, Rzeznik finally
forsakes his familiar melancholy for
anger, and with lines like "Now you're
a supermarket punk rock television
comedy" and "Yeah I bit down now
there's no hand to feed," the band come
as close as it ever does to genuine self
awareness and self-deprecation. Still,
"What a Scene" isno"Pretty Vacant" —
Rzeznik doesn't have the sneering, sar
castic self-contempt that made Johnny
Rotten so electrifying, and the lyrics
and music eventually retreat from this
brief hint ofadventurousness back into
bland, familiar territory.


hev there, pretty boy.
