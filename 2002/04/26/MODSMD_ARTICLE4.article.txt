# ASSU election still debated
## 
### JOHN HUETTER EDITORIAL STAFF 
So is the ASSU presidential election over
yet? Depends who you ask.
Tuesday's Undergraduate Senate meet
ing featured senior Patrick Grosetto dis
cussing his challenge to the constitutionality
of the 2002 ASSU election's instant runoff
voting.
Grosetto filed an April 22 complaint to
the Elections Commission contesting the
slate of junior Monica Henestroza and
sophomore Nick Rodriguez did not re
ceive a majority of the votes in the gener
al election. He hoped to bring the matter
before the ASSU Constitutional Council
fora ruling.
Also on Tuesday, senators confirmed
physics doctoral candidate Harris Shapiro
to the council. The appointment was
made to obtain a quorum on the council
should Grosetto obtain the necessary sig
natures â€” those of either five ASSU legis
lators, 5 percent of the student body, the
ASSU President, or the ASSU vice presi
dent - to bring his case to council.
ASSU President Matt Brewer also gave an
update on the case to the Senate. "Nothing's
happening right now," said Brewer, a junior.
" Just rumors and allegations."
One of the designers of the instant
runoff process at Stanford has also com
mented on the challenge. Dave Robin
son, an alumni of the Graduate Student
Council, said he thought Crosetto's chal
lenge was unfounded.
Robinson, a doctoral candidate in
chemistry, said that when the ASSU im
plemented instant runoff voting at Stan

ford in 2001 it had already accounted for
Crosetto's concerns.
Legalities
The legal issue is essentially whether or not
an instant runoff counts as a separate election.
That is to say, can an instant runoff "recy
cle" votes from a previous election? If an in
stant runoff is made out of a round of a gen
eral election, should a majority in the instant
runoff be determined by all votes cast in the
general election or just that round's votes?
The only constitutional mention of a
runoff states that it will be held "between the
two slates receiving the most votes in the As
sociation Spring Quarter (ieneral Election."
The constitution also gives the ASSU
the power to make any constitutional
rules and definitions regarding the elec
tion it wants.
Instant runoff voting, according to the by
laws, takes all the votes cast in the ASSU gen
eral election and continues to discard candi
dates based on voters' rankings in a series of
primaries until only two remain.
The two candidates' votes are then tal
lied in a "final election," according to
ASSU joint by-laws. "This result, together
with the number of ballots cast in the Gen
eral Election that do not contribute to this
tally, shall constitute the result of the Pres
idential Election."
Another section reads: "If necessary, the
result of the final election shall constitute the
result of the presidential runoff election."
Finally, the constitution reads, " Ilie Presi
dent and the Vice President shall be elected
by a majority of the Association voting in the
