# ASSU election still debated
## 
### JOHN HUETTER EDITORIAL STAFF 
So is the ASSU presidential election over
yet? Depends who you ask.
Tuesday's Undergraduate Senate meet
ing featured senior Patrick Grosetto dis
cussing his challenge to the constitutionality
of the 2002 ASSU election's instant runoff
voting.
Grosetto filed an April 22 complaint to
the Elections Commission contesting the
slate of junior Monica Henestroza and
sophomore Nick Rodriguez did not re
ceive a majority of the votes in the gener
al election. He hoped to bring the matter
before the ASSU Constitutional Council
fora ruling.
Also on Tuesday, senators confirmed
physics doctoral candidate Harris Shapiro
to the council. The appointment was
made to obtain a quorum on the council
should Grosetto obtain the necessary sig
natures â€” those of either five ASSU legis
lators, 5 percent of the student body, the
ASSU President, or the ASSU vice presi
dent - to bring his case to council.
ASSU President Matt Brewer also gave an
update on the case to the Senate. "Nothing's
happening right now," said Brewer, a junior.
" Just rumors and allegations."
One of the designers of the instant
runoff process at Stanford has also com
mented on the challenge. Dave Robin
son, an alumni of the Graduate Student
Council, said he thought Crosetto's chal
lenge was unfounded.
Robinson, a doctoral candidate in
chemistry, said that when the ASSU im
plemented instant runoff voting at Stan

ford in 2001 it had already accounted for
Crosetto's concerns.
Legalities
The legal issue is essentially whether or not
an instant runoff counts as a separate election.
That is to say, can an instant runoff "recy
cle" votes from a previous election? If an in
stant runoff is made out of a round of a gen
eral election, should a majority in the instant
runoff be determined by all votes cast in the
general election or just that round's votes?
The only constitutional mention of a
runoff states that it will be held "between the
two slates receiving the most votes in the As
sociation Spring Quarter (ieneral Election."
The constitution also gives the ASSU
the power to make any constitutional
rules and definitions regarding the elec
tion it wants.
Instant runoff voting, according to the by
laws, takes all the votes cast in the ASSU gen
eral election and continues to discard candi
dates based on voters' rankings in a series of
primaries until only two remain.
The two candidates' votes are then tal
lied in a "final election," according to
ASSU joint by-laws. "This result, together
with the number of ballots cast in the Gen
eral Election that do not contribute to this
tally, shall constitute the result of the Pres
idential Election."
Another section reads: "If necessary, the
result of the final election shall constitute the
result of the presidential runoff election."
Finally, the constitution reads, " Ilie Presi
dent and the Vice President shall be elected
by a majority of the Association voting in the
Association Spring Quarter General
Election."
And therein lies Crosetto's
challenge. By definition, Croset
to said, a runoff must be a sepa
rate election.
Robinson argued that another
runoff would be redundant.
"Yeah, you're using the same
votes," he said, "but if you asked
everybody to vote again, they'd be
casting the same votes."
Instant runoffs, argue propo
nents, form a separate election by ex
amining only die votes for the top
two candidates.
"It's not as complicated as Fat
actually thinks," said Administra
tion and Rules Committee Chair
Charlene Ng, a senior. "That's the
whole reason why it's called 'in
stant runoff' ballot.'"
Moralities
Hie nature of a democracy is also
in question. Is a separate runoff
more democratic than an instant
runoff? The former sees lowered
voter turnout at Stanford, and die
latter recycles votes from the general
election it's attempting to decide.
In the 2000 presidential elec
tion (the last to use the traditional
runoff system), Ben Liu won the
general election, but not a major

ity of it, while Seth Newton won
the runoff with a majority and
therefore the presidency.
The runoff saw turnout drop by
17 percent from the general elec
tion and the runoff.
Crosetto said that despite
these decreased turnouts, the tra
ditional runoff system was still
more democratic.
"Democracy is not easy," he
said. "Quite often we will be re
quired to have a runoff to have a
more perfect system ... We can
make this sacrifice of voting an ad
ditional time, spending a few more
weeks campaigning, or acting as
an elections commissioner for an
other 14 days in order to have a
better student government."
Robinson, however, said a sys
tem which in practicality lost so
many voters ran contrary to the
democratic ideal.
"Democracy is about making peo
ple's voices heard and making their
voices have an effect," Robinson said.
"How you do that is yriu have a high
turnout election .... And that in
volves making voting as convenient
as possible."
Robinson said that it didn't bother
him that the system arguably caters to
voter apathy.
"It's not for us to judge who is dili
gent and who is not," Robinson said.
With instant runoff, supporters
say, one has an opportunity to pick a
long shot or non-mainstream candi
date without the fear that one is

throwing one's vote away or instigat
ing a runoff.
"This system gives people the
freedom of choice to express what
they truly believe," Robinson said.
Inherent in the process, he
said, is the knowledge that fail
ing to rank two hated candidates
indicates one is waiving one's
right to vote between the two in
the runoff.
"You have the opportunity to
rank them if you want," Robinson
said. "If you have a preference of one
candidate over the other, you should
express it."
Ng, a senior, said that voters
should know from the nature of the
instant runoff system not to try to
"punish" a disliked slate.
"Your lower choices do not hurt
the chances of your higher choic
es," the 2002 presidential ballot
read. "If you don't rank a slate, it
means you would rather not have
your vote count than have it count
for that slate."
Crosetto has threatened to con
test the legality of the election in a
Santa Clara County court as well as
the Constitutional Council.
He said he would claim in court
that the election was a breach of
contract between the ASSU and
the students.
Any decision Crosetto hopes to
obtain would have to occur by May I
to create a runoff. One must happen
within 14 days of the election to be
constitutional.
