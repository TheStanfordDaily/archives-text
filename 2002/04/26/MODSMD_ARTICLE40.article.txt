# Incubus kicks out the jams at Civic Center
## 
### NASTASSIA ROSE LOPEZ 
"The booze is here!" bellowed Incubus's bassist
Dirk Lance, carrying an ice chest full ofßudweisers
to his own band's after-party on Tuesday, April 16.
Incubus, who played San Francisco's Bill Graham
Civic Center, caused not only moshing and spells of
orgasmic screaming, but incited the little old lady in
the front row beside me to bang her head in pure
rock carnage — which truly confirms the broad
range of fans the band attracts. "It's nice to know
that we rock the old people," laughed' guitarist
Mike Einzinger.
Incubus's unyielding chemistry invigorated San
Francisco as it began the night with their convulsive
its, "Circles." Twenty minutes into the set, lead
singer Brandon Boyd obeyed the wishes of every
woman in the audience by taking oil his shirt and
belting out two of his infamous celestial ballads,
"Stellar" and "Mexico." They were lauded into an
encore, closing with the airy, Asian-influenced
song, "Aqueous Transmission."
The concert ended at 11:00 p.m., when the
world-famous "good boys of rock" threw an after
party with no more than 30 guests and a small CI)
player set up in the corner of the room. Ex-strip
pers paid their respects, showed their nipple rings,
and made out with their girlfriends for the band's
utmost pleasure. 1970's disco/jazz sent everyone
into a dance frenzy, reviving the long extinct Run
ning Man and Cabbage Patch, while Boyd stood off
to the side drawing signature tattoo concoctions
with a Sharpie on many of the guests' body parts.
This era's "Sexiest Man of R(Kk 'n' Roll" coyly
showed off the self-designed epidermal art gallery
adorning his arms.
"I wanted to go to art school after I graduated,
but my parents couldn't afford it. I still love to
draw," Boyd explained, his voice oozing with sexu
al sophistication.
Brandon and the rest of the boys of Incubus
need not worry about affording art school; they are
already making a generous living off of their art.
With sold-out shows across the nation, the down
to-earth bandmates who ridicule one another's
dance moves and act more like 15-year-old boys
than strung-out rock stars have creatively found
their niche in the world of rock. They may be one
of the only bands to avoid a cheesy VII-1 "Where
are They Now?" special 20 years from now.
