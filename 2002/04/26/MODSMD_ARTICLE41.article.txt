"lf I could just give her one more inch,
I'm sure she'd love me so much more,"
muses Gary. "I'll bet that two more inches
would really distract girls from my
hideous personality," declaresjohu. "Per
haps an extra three inches would give me
a better shot with that hot girl in my polit
ical science lecture," Raoul wonders.
I've got news for you fellas. Clary, if she
loves you, she'll be satisfied with whatever
you've got. John, nothing in all of God's
creation could distract a woman from the
fact that you're an asshole. And Raoul,
let's face it, in this new age of political cor
rectness and feminist domination, you

can no longer win a woman's affection by
exposing yourself.
Every man, save the true 112 reaks among
us, is paranoid when it comes to the size
of his penis. Conventional wisdom tells
us that the mean length is between five
and six inches erect. However, conven
tional wisdom also tells us that most
young men have measured themselves at
some point in their lives. Most of us have
wondered what we can do to make a man
out of ourselves.
Type in "penis enlargement" in the
Google search field, as I did, and you'll
find several pages of links for everything
from pumps and pills to creams and sur
gical procedures. One site even advertis
es time-honed "Ancient Arab techniques"
for increasing your size. Why didn't my
dad ever tell me about those? Several fea
ture pictures of nerdy-looking doctors
(How big could that guy possibly be?)
who have patented procedures "guaran

teed" to make you a stud. One site even
has pre- and post-surgery pictures for
several men. Why in God's name did I
just look at that?
The most commonly used methods of
penis enlargement are surgery and "pe
nile exercises." In a surgical operation,
the doctor will typically sever two of the
ligaments that connect the muscles in the
penis to your pelvic area. The result is
that more of the penis' length is visible
outside the body.
Though surgical techniques have ad
vanced quite a bit in the past years, they
still remain somewhat dangerous. Even
after a successful surgery, your penis may
still droop down even if you have an erec
tion since the ligaments that would nor
mally keep it standing have been cut.
There is a low percentage of botched
surgeries and most of these surgeries re
sult in penile disfiguration in addition to a
man's inability to have sex or keep an

erection. In especially bad cases, it may
even hurt to urinate. I know, it's an aw
fully high price to pay for an additional
one to three inches.
The other method employed to in
crease penis size is exercises. In this case,
"exercise" is just a fancy word for hanging
weights from your penis and letting grav
ity do the rest. While this often works to
increase the length of the penis, there are
several caveats of which you should be
aware. For one, your girth (the thickness
of the shaft) is likely to decrease. After all,
you're not adding muscle, just stretching
what you've got. Additionally, there is a
very real risk of erectile dysfunction. You
may very well find yourself with a limp
noodle of skin tucked in your trousers.
Remember gentlemen, if a woman re
fuses to be with you because she thinks
you're too small, tell her to get lost. And
while she's walking away, tell her she's fat.
Thev love that one.
