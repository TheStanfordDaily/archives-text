This is the sixth in a series of articles called 'The Record Bin" ex
ploying classic albums from the past: pop music for people who like
pop music.

Gorillaz, a band that has made
waves within the past year with its sin
gle "Clint Eastwood," may be new to
the music scene but Damon Albarn is
definitely not. Albarn, who serves as
frontman for the cartoonish punk-hip
hop hybrid, was also the lead singer of
Blur for the entirety of the '90s.
Though Blur had a few minor hits

stateside (including "Song 2" — "Whee-hoo!"), it was ar
guably one of the most successful bands in England of that
decade. After a fairly generic debut, it put out three great
and influential albums of Brit-pop, a music style character
ized by its time-tested British influences — Bowie, XTC, the
Beatles and the Kinks.
All three albums are full of wit and each further honed
the band's craft. However, the last, "The Great Escape,"
was overshadowed by Blur's "feud" with Oasis, which

filled British tabloids on slow news days
during the mid-'9os. In addition, no song
off the album got a big radio push in the
States, and the album's disdain for con
sumerism had, even by 1995, been per
ceived as trite. That didn't keep "Ameri-

can Beauty" from
winning an Academy
Award five years
later though. Also,
Blur was tired of
Brit-pop after "Es
cape"; its subsequent
albums abandoned
the genre in favor of

American experimentalism, earning them
surprise American success for the tongue
in-cheek ode to dumb American rock,
"Song 2."
All this, however, is really unfair, be-

cause "The Great Escape" is a great album. Over the
course of 15 songs, Blur make gorgeous sing-along music
and subsumes itself in the role of the mid-to-upper-class
es. With kinky sex lives, eccentric but unloved "friends"

and attempts to find salva
tion in materialism and
promises thereof, these are
the people of whom Thore
an was speaking of when he
said "Most men lead lives of
quiet desperation."
The caricatures in the
songs are just that — after
all, it is more fun to hear
about a right-wing Mason
with a naughty sex life than
to dwell on the mundanity
of the short-but-sweet-but
monotonous "Ernold
Same." Blur even recog
nizes this by starting the disc
off with the song, "Stereo
types." However, we all,
rich or not, sometimes fall

for the lottery come-ons of "It Could Be You" and the "Is it
'cause he saw it on a commercial break" of "Globe Alone," as
we are reminded of Third World youth who rail against
western influence, Nikes on foot and Happy Meal in hand.
The cover art, with a happy-go-lucky set of youthful male
boaters, one diving into waters, is perfect, at least once one
opens up the booklet and realizes that said waters are shark
infested.
Still, the lyrics would not be so enjoyable without great
music. "The Great Escape" is one of the great modern pop
albums, one of the few albums that not only makes one
want to sing along, but makes one want to do so with every
song, from the manic "Globe Alone" to the depressive
Japanese worker anthem, "Yuko 8c Hiro." The sweet
melodies are catchy in the best of ways, sinking in and de
manding the "play" button be hit again after the disc ends.
And it is varied enough that one hesitates to name any spe
cific instruments in arrangements that can range from a
light waltz to a wall of sound to all-out punk.
"I he Great Escape" ranks as one of the great over
looked albums of the '90s, and it still holds up today. After
the latest cycle of boom and bust in Silicon Valley, it may
even hit a little too close to home. Even for students. "Yuko
8c Hiro could just as well be overworked undergrads and
"Country House," the minor hit off the album, could de
scribe a disillusioned grad student who decides to drop out
and live in the woods as "the century's remedy for the faint
at heart." After all, it isn't just the British who long to make
"The Great Escape."


I saw these guys on a commercial break


Take the plunge.
