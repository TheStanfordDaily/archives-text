# 'The Mikado' hits the stage
## 
### JENNIFER KONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Savoyards, a student drama
group, will premiere its version of Gilbert and
Sullivan's "The Mikado" tonight at 8 p.m. in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Eight student actors and about two dozen
chorus members appear in the two-hour
comedic operetta.
Freshman Linnea Williams, who plays a
maid, said the show is meant for light humor
and entertainment.
""Hie Mikado' is a comic opera, which
means there are goofy lyrics and a plot that
twists in every direction possible but ends with
all the characters rejoicing, even the antago
nists," Williams said.
Kristofer Jennings, the executive producer

of the show and a doctoral student in statistics,
said the Savoyards held auditions during fall
quarter for cast and chorus parts.
"This production of "Hie Mikado' has come
together in a pretty special way with more so
phisticated blocking and acting, a beautifully
blended musical ensemble, as well as a more
artistic set and lighting design," Jennings said.
The Savoyards is a student group that pre
sents Gilbert and Sullivan operas — as well as
other shows — in the fall and spring quarters
of each year. In addition to student help, Stan
ford faculty, staff and alumni contribute to the
productions.
For many students, this was their first expe
rience singing in an opera.
"There is a great deal of fresh talent and
first-time opera singers," said
vocal director Emily Greble, who is
a doctoral student in history. "It has
been incredibly fun for me to work
with singers who are not used to the
music and watch how they trans
formed over a short period."
The setting of " The Mikado" is
unique in that it combines different
cultural influences.
"Since it is an English opera set in
Japan, a surreal mix if there ever
was one, the show presents a great
creative opportunity for mixing ele
ments from several cultures," Jen
nings said.
Sophomore Ed Iskandar, who
plays an executioner, said he felt
that this mix of cultures was what at
tracted him to this production.
"As an Asian actor who grew up
in England, 1 couldn't very well turn
down an opportunity to play a part
that specifically calls for an Asian
looking actor with a British accent,"
Iskandar said. "The Mikado' must
l)e unique within the dramatic liter

ary canon in this respect."
The uniqueness of the characters
allowed cast members to explore
very different modes of acting.
"It is a somewhat absurd come
dy, so the characters tend to ex
hibit traits that normally remain
quite repressed in day-to-day
life," said freshman Malcolm Mur
dock, who has a lead role. "It's
been a lot of fun playing Pish
Tush. It's good therapy."
For the past eight or nine
weeks, production members
have attended rehearsals three or
four times a week. But in the end,
cast members said they just hope
that the audience will have fun
watching the show.
"It's all very lighthearted and
funny, and that's what I want to get
across," Williams said. As long as
people laugh, I've done my job."
The show begins tonight at 8
p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
General admission is $15, chil
dren and senior citizens are $10,
and the student discount ticket is
$6.50. There are also 8 p.m.
showings tomorrow and May 3
and 4, and a showing at 2:30 p.m.
on May 5.
