# Latin American film festival begins
## 
### RIZWAN SABAR 
Stanford's first Latin American film
festival starts today and runs through
Sunday.
The free event will feature 18 films
from 12 Latin countries. Among the titles
are the Mexican film "Amores Perros"
and the Cuban flick, "La Buena Vista So
cial Club."
Eleven freshman have been organiz
ing the festival for the past two quarters.
The idea for the event was sparked, in
part, by the announcement to cancel the
Latin American Studies program.
Mari 112 layman, a freshman who helped
to organize the festival, was disappointed
by the announcement, which came late
fall quarter.
"We wanted the film festival to serve as
a forum to continue discussion about
Latin America, especially current events,"
Hayman said.
She explained the purpose of the festi
val is to showcase quality works of art.
"Mainly, the idea is just to show good
film," she said. "We are all fanatics of Latin
American film, and we hope to share that
enthusiasm with the community."
Most of the films are recent and high
light current issues and concerns in Latin

American countries. Each film will be in
troduced by a student who will share his
or her experiences in that country to give
the film a context.
"We have a lot of Chicano students
working on our committee," Hayman
said. "We feel that they have a lot of ties
with their film. Most of them are native to
the country from which the film came."
The festival will include films from Ar
gentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia,
Costa Rica, Cuba, Guatemala, Mexico,
Uruguay and the United States.
Freshman Simon Pyle, also involved in
coordinating the festival, cites the panoply
of visions as the hallmark of the event.
"There's a good variety of voices and
messages in the film," Pyle said. " There's
a great deal of diversity that would be ex
citing for the Stanford community to be
exposed to. The viewer should get a sense
of life in Latin America."
The festival will include a mix of social
documentary and entertainment-orient
ed films. For instance, the Argentine film
"Garage Olimpo," which examines the
activities of the government in the 19705,
will be shown right before the Mexican
comedy "Por la Libre," which traces the
journey of two cousins trying to spread
their grandfather's ashes.

Freshman Elizabeth cle Rham char
acterized the festival as a "carefree ex
perience."
"You don't have to have background
in the history of the countries... for most
of the films, you can just come and enjoy
them as stories." Rham said.
Fort hese freshmen, this is the first time
organizing an event of this magnitude.
Freshman Sara fnes said she
applauds the group for their efforts.
"The event was all organized by people
who already had their plates full, so the
fact that we got it together is a real testa
ment to the discipline and dedication of
all parties involved," Calderon said.
The festival is open to the public, and
admission is free. " That's the spirit of the
festival," Pyle said. "We want to have as
many people enjoy these films as possible."
Calderon hopes that those who attend
the film festival will feel the way she did
after watching a few of the films: "1
learned about Guatemala. 1 watched
movies. It was fabulous."
The film festival will run tonight from
6 p.m. to midnight in Building 420 Room
41, and will continue on Saturday and
Sunday from 1 p.m. to midnight. For
