Fernando Birri is the"...grand papa of Latin American Cinema"
-Gabriel Garcia Marquez
A renowned documentary filmmaker who revolutionized the use of cinema to promote
social justice, Birri began his career with the ground-breaking documentary Tire Die,
which focused on the lives of poor barrio residents on the edges of modern urban
Argentina. Birri also founded and directed a documentary film school - the first of its kind
in Latin America - at the Universidad Nacional del Litoral in Argentina, and co-founded and
directed the Escuela Internacionai de Cine y Television de San Antonio de Los Banos in
Cuba. During his time at Stanford, Birri has offered a 3-part course on the "New Latin
American Cinema."
The Center for Latin American Studies will host a conference and film festival, Utopias and
Frontiers/Utopias y Fro rite ras, on May 10 and 11, 2002, to commemorate the work of Fernando
Birri and award-winning Chicana filmmaker Lourdes Portillo, a Visiting Professor in the
Department of Spanish and Portuguese.
