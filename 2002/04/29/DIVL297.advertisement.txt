CALL FOR
SENIOR NOMINATIONS
The Stanford Alumni Association seeks nominations
for seniors who are likely to commit a portion of their energy
and passion to Stanford through the Cardinal Class Core
program. All faculty, staff and students are invited to
submit their nominations. The program was launched
with the purpose of creating a nucleus of alumni
in each graduating class who would become key volunteers
and leaders for their class and for Stanford. As young alumni
in Cardinal Class Core, they will dedicate some of their
enthusiasm to Stanford and help foster a thriving network
amongst all of their Stanford classmates. An induction ceremony
will be held during Commencement weekend to which all
inductees, their families, and nominators will be invited.
