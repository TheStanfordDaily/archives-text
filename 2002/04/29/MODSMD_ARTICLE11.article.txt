## The 						Stanford Daily Diversity Fest and Murray contribute to Stanford 
### 
Published Since 1891

At first, a day celebrating diversity at
Stanford seems like a nice idea, but
not really like a newsworthy event.
It could seem repetitive given the
sheer number of multicultural events, the
number of ethnic theme dorms and the
many diversifying majors. At least it did until
Murray House, the Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity theme dorm, held Diver
sity Fest 2002 on Saturday
To a casual observer, Diversity Fest seems to
be an example of classic Stanford-style diversity
— scripted with costumes, food galore, and bal
loons. They could see it as cultural reduction
ism, minimizing a culture's richness and vi
brance to a single aspect such as food or music.
The fine line between cultural reduction
ism and cultural celebration is hazy. To some,
Diversity Fest may have simply seemed like a
convenient place to grab free food and hear

fun music. But in actuality, such inferences
would be incorrect.
To those who had attended the many events
leading up to the festivities, Diversity Fest was
indeed a celebration of different cultures, races,
and ethnicities and did not cross that fine line.
The intellectual groundwork laid before the
event established it as the culmination to a
year's worth of programs. Theme projects thus
far have included race and American law, Poly
nesian family issues, diversity in academia, food
stereotypes, and interracial gay male dating.
To call such a celebration typical is to fail to
understand Murray's purpose to the Stan
ford community. Murray exists as an exten
sion of the CSRE program that fosters an en
vironment where students and faculty come
together to discuss the issues that divide and
unite student communities.
Although Diversity Fest celebrated unity

among cultures, it did not offer solutions for
all racial and ethnic problems, nor did it try to
mask its inability to do so. Often, students may
look to Murray as a panacea for racial ten
sions. Students should reconsider this per
spective before placing a new stereotype on is
sues of diversity. Murray, in its function as the
CSRE theme dorm, should not be seen as the
alternative to dealing with racial tensions.
Rather, it is a dorm that strives to promote the
academic study of race and ethnicity.
Students expressing interest in such a
theme dorm need to realize that it is a place
where issues of race, ethnicity their relations
to identity and classism can be discussed.
Murray does not represent the cure-all to
racism. People are different. Races have their
differences. These statements are not made
to simplify the issues.
Diversity Fest 2002's appearance should not

be inferred as a simplification of ethnic and
racial issues. Instead, CSRE should be seen as
the means by which intellectual foundations
can be laid so that celebrations like Diversity
Fest 2002, can promote appreciation and ac
knowledgement of all that cultures encompass
— social struggles, oppression, literature, art,
dance, and yes, even food.
To deny that any of these are an important
part of culture and can or should be left out of
such a celebration would not demonstrate to
the average student why Stanford devotes so
much time and energy on teaching under
standing and appreciation to all.
So while Diversity Fest 2002 may not be the
most shocking thing to encounter at Stanford,
it has an important place here and students
should continue to celebrate diversity until all
people and their cultures are appreciated —
and even afterwards as well.
