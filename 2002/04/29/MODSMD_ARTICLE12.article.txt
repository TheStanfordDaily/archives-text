# DANCING IN CIRCLES
## Polyamory: the solution to Stanford's dating problems 
### 
Tune your radio to whatever
frequency you like: you're
more than likely to hear
someone wailing about an in
credible kiss or the unendurable pain
of a breakup.
There are more love songs than any
thing else out there. And no movie is
complete without at least a hint of sex
or romance. We are a society obsessed
with love and mating. This is not at all
surprising: the biological necessity for
such an obsession is obvious.
But what is not so obvious is the ra
tionale behind our paradigm of tradi
tional coupling. »

According to the
movies, we are to seek a
romantic partner, a sex
ual partner, a best
friend, someone for
whom we care more
than anyone else in the
world, someone who re
ciprocates those feel
ings. But why do all

those descriptions have to fit a single
person? Why do "sex" and "caring" have
to go together? We know full well that
they often don't. Or "romance" and
"best friend?" Why couldn't we hold
multiple relationships with multiple peo
ple, each of them fulfilling a different
component of our needs?
In a sense, we do just that — by main
taining friendships and familial relation
ships as well as life partnerships. But why
is it that this one partnership, or marriage,
or whatever you want to call it, over
whelms all others?
For example, why shouldn't I form my
primary life-partnership with my room
mate? We're not lovers but we are friends,
and we do love and care for each other.
Couldn't we just agree to live together and
support each other, and find sexual fulfill
ment outside of our relationship?
I have to admit, the idea sounds a bit
odd. But why? Is there a reason beyond
the fact that we've grown up surrounded
by this strict one man, one woman
paradigm? With the passage of Califor
nia's Proposition 22, which defines mar
riage as a union between a woman and a
man, choosing any other type of relation
ship will continue to entail a sacrifice of
legal rights for years to come.
But inherently, it doesn't seem to make
any difference which of our relationships
comes first. It's -just that we've decided —
or more correctly, it's been decided for us
— that the romantic partner relationship
is most important. Friends can move away,
but if you are in a serious romantic rela
tionship, you try at all costs to make your
moves together. What makes this one re
lationship so different?
There are, no doubt, some practical
benefits to a strong partnership that in

volves love, sex and caring all rolled into
one. Children are, at least in theory, pro
vided with a stable home. And it's a heck of
a lot easier to focus on building a deeper
bond with one person, rather than split
ting your energy among many.
But on the child-rearing issue, there
are many examples — both throughout
the animal kingdom and within our own
species — in which children raised com
munally are happy and healthy and pro
vided with more security than those raised
by only two parents. Kids benefit greatly
from having more than just two main role
models in their lives. Even American nos
talgia recalls a time when every adult in
the neighborhood looked out for every
kid in the street as if that child were his or
her own.
And in regards to the idea of focusing
your relationship-building energy on
one person: is that really necessary? How
many of us actually partner with some
one whose love is the only thing we need?
There's a myth created for us, one that
sets us up for disappointment.
It's the myth that we will find this one
perfect person who will make us happy
and set everything right for the rest of
our lives. The reality seems to be that we
need a whole network of relationships in
order to live fulfilling lives.
And even if we do find that "perfect"
person, why does there have to be only
one? What if there were two or three peo
ple who occupied that "romantic partner
ship" space in our lives?
There are people who live by exactly
this notion. The practice is called
polyamory, which is eloquently defined by
www.polyamorysociety.org as "the non
possessive, honest, responsible and ethical
philosophy and practice of loving multiple
people simultaneously."
For example, a group of three or more
adults may consider themselves to be es
sentially, if not legally, married, and re
main faithful within the group.
There are also partnerships of two
people who are committed to each other,
but who may each have secondary rela
tionships with outside people. There are
as many types of polyamory as there are
polyamorists — each arrangement is dif
ferent, and set up based on consideration
and communication of each person's
feelings on the matter.
Living outside of mainstream societal
norms, with no default model of'relation
ships to follow, polyamorists are forced to
carefully think out their desires and goals
for life — partnerships. Maybe non-tradi
tional relationships are not for everyone,
but all of us should take the time to con
sider what we really want.

Tune your radio to whatever
frequency you like: you're
more than likely to hear
someone wailing about an in
credible kiss or the unendurable pain
of a breakup.
There are more love songs than any
thing else out there. And no movie is
complete without at least a hint of sex
or romance. We are a society obsessed
with love and mating. This is not at all
surprising: the biological necessity for
such an obsession is obvious.
But what is not so obvious is the ra
tionale behind our paradigm of tradi
tional coupling. »

According to the
movies, we are to seek a
romantic partner, a sex
ual partner, a best
friend, someone for
whom we care more
than anyone else in the
world, someone who re
ciprocates those feel
ings. But why do all

those descriptions have to fit a single
person? Why do "sex" and "caring" have
to go together? We know full well that
they often don't. Or "romance" and
"best friend?" Why couldn't we hold
multiple relationships with multiple peo
ple, each of them fulfilling a different
component of our needs?
In a sense, we do just that — by main
taining friendships and familial relation
ships as well as life partnerships. But why
is it that this one partnership, or marriage,
or whatever you want to call it, over
whelms all others?
For example, why shouldn't I form my
primary life-partnership with my room
mate? We're not lovers but we are friends,
and we do love and care for each other.
Couldn't we just agree to live together and
support each other, and find sexual fulfill
ment outside of our relationship?
I have to admit, the idea sounds a bit
odd. But why? Is there a reason beyond
the fact that we've grown up surrounded
by this strict one man, one woman
paradigm? With the passage of Califor
nia's Proposition 22, which defines mar
riage as a union between a woman and a
man, choosing any other type of relation
ship will continue to entail a sacrifice of
legal rights for years to come.
But inherently, it doesn't seem to make
any difference which of our relationships
comes first. It's -just that we've decided —
or more correctly, it's been decided for us
— that the romantic partner relationship
is most important. Friends can move away,
but if you are in a serious romantic rela
tionship, you try at all costs to make your
moves together. What makes this one re
lationship so different?
There are, no doubt, some practical
benefits to a strong partnership that in

volves love, sex and caring all rolled into
one. Children are, at least in theory, pro
vided with a stable home. And it's a heck of
a lot easier to focus on building a deeper
bond with one person, rather than split
ting your energy among many.
But on the child-rearing issue, there
are many examples — both throughout
the animal kingdom and within our own
species — in which children raised com
munally are happy and healthy and pro
vided with more security than those raised
by only two parents. Kids benefit greatly
from having more than just two main role
models in their lives. Even American nos
talgia recalls a time when every adult in
the neighborhood looked out for every
kid in the street as if that child were his or
her own.
And in regards to the idea of focusing
your relationship-building energy on
one person: is that really necessary? How
many of us actually partner with some
one whose love is the only thing we need?
There's a myth created for us, one that
sets us up for disappointment.
It's the myth that we will find this one
perfect person who will make us happy
and set everything right for the rest of
our lives. The reality seems to be that we
need a whole network of relationships in
order to live fulfilling lives.
And even if we do find that "perfect"
person, why does there have to be only
one? What if there were two or three peo
ple who occupied that "romantic partner
ship" space in our lives?
There are people who live by exactly
this notion. The practice is called
polyamory, which is eloquently defined by
www.polyamorysociety.org as "the non
possessive, honest, responsible and ethical
philosophy and practice of loving multiple
people simultaneously."
For example, a group of three or more
adults may consider themselves to be es
sentially, if not legally, married, and re
main faithful within the group.
There are also partnerships of two
people who are committed to each other,
but who may each have secondary rela
tionships with outside people. There are
as many types of polyamory as there are
polyamorists — each arrangement is dif
ferent, and set up based on consideration
and communication of each person's
feelings on the matter.
Living outside of mainstream societal
norms, with no default model of'relation
ships to follow, polyamorists are forced to
carefully think out their desires and goals
for life — partnerships. Maybe non-tradi
tional relationships are not for everyone,
but all of us should take the time to con
sider what we really want.
