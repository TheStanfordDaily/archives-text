Res Ed assistant director responds
As the coordinator of the Resident As
sistant / College Assistant selection pro
cess, I would like to respond to some of the
points made in Thursday's editorial enti
tled, "RA selection process unfair to re
turning applicants."
The selection process is both central
ized and decentralized. There are some
centralized guidelines set out by the Office
of Residential Education for the resident
fellows, college directors and supervisors.
The remainder of the selection process al
lows for these supervisors to determine
which applicants best complement their
own style and goals for their houses and
offer these candidates interviews within
their local processes.
Based on the centralized guidelines, su
pervisors have the flexibility to treat re-ap
plicants and new applicants as two sepa
rate pools or to include them all in one
pool.
While it may seem unfair for the reap
plying RAs to not be guaranteed a first
round interview, it is at the discretion of
the supervisor to develop a selection pro
cess that meets his or her goals. It is like
ly that the Row's selection process is
magnified due to the number of re-ap
plicants it gets compared to other hous
es. More re-applicants may result in
more rejections.
Thursday's editorial tailed into ques
tion the validity of using the re-applicants'
ability to meet the specific needs of the Row
as criteria during the review of re-appli
cants' applications. Ilie truth of the matter
is that different types of houses require dif
ferent skills of the RAs. While these re-ap
plicants are very capable RAs, which was
never in question, it does not mean that
they are necessarily going to meet the spe
cific needs and challenges of the Row.

Being an RA on the Row presents chal
lenges that are not faced in other types of
houses in the same way that being an RAin
an all-frosh house presents challenges that
are not faced in other types of houses.
Res Ed is open to the review of all prac
tices regarding the selection process par
ticularly in light of unintended messages
that could be conveyed. Res Ed values the
skills and experience of all its current staff
who clearly have done a tremendous job.
While in examining the process this
year we find consistency amongst supervi
sors in implementing the selection pro
cess, we will be taking into consideration
the feedback and criticism that has result
ed this year in consultation with supervi
sors and current staff.

Co-terminal student responds to Ghanem
This is in response to. Kareem
Ghanem's guest column, entitled "Israel
and the United States are not lighting the
same war." Near the end of the column, I
was mildly surprised that Ghanem ac
cused the Israeli Defense Force of "target
ed civilian attacks" during the latest incur
sion. I was unaware that there was any ev
idence of this.
This piqued my curiosity enough to go
back through the column and look for any
evidence that Ghanem might have pre
sented. I found only a quote from an Is
raeli newspaper editorial, alleged to be
"documentation of Israeli military abuse
against c ivilians."
It seems to me, however, that editorials
are essays of opinion, and not documenta
tion of anything. Furthermore, the edito
rial did not even bring up the possibility of

targeted civilian attacks, it was simply a
personal attack on Ariel Sharon.
Still no evidence for targeted civilian at
tacks by Israel.
So my question, after reading
Ghanem's editorial, is why would he make
such baseless claims on such an inflamma
tory issue such as the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict? Or raise the specter of the 1 lolo
caust, accusing pro-Israeli columnists of
wanting to "turn the Palestinian territories
into a giant concentration camp"?
Such rhetorical tactics are doubly offen
sive coming from a Stanford student and a
history major.

responds to Hilton
Prof. Ronald Hilton claims not to
"know anyone at Stanford who owns a
gun." I didn't know anyone at Harvard ei
ther who owned a gun — until I started
the Harvard Law School Target Shooting
Club. Gun owners, in social circles where
people are hostile to gun ownership, stay
in the closet. You do know gun owners,
Prof. Hilton. They're regular people, just
like you and me.
As for the Harvard Law Review run
ning an article called "Discovering the
Joys of a Semi-Automatic." The Harvard
Law Review, of which 1 am an executive
editor, is a fine publication. However, we
publish academic legal scholarship, not
odes to guns. The article in question was
written by a reporter at the Harvard Law
Record, our school newspaper.

tion of anything. Furthermore, the edito
rial did not even bring up the possibility of

targeted civilian attacks, it was simply a
personal attack on Ariel Sharon.
Still no evidence for targeted civilian at
tacks by Israel.
So my question, after reading
Ghanem's editorial, is why would he make
such baseless claims on such an inflamma
tory issue such as the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict? Or raise the specter of the 1 lolo
caust, accusing pro-Israeli columnists of
wanting to "turn the Palestinian territories
into a giant concentration camp"?
Such rhetorical tactics are doubly offen
sive coming from a Stanford student and a
history major.

Harvard Law Review editor
responds to Hilton
Prof. Ronald Hilton claims not to
"know anyone at Stanford who owns a
gun." I didn't know anyone at Harvard ei
ther who owned a gun — until I started
the Harvard Law School Target Shooting
Club. Gun owners, in social circles where
people are hostile to gun ownership, stay
in the closet. You do know gun owners,
Prof. Hilton. They're regular people, just
like you and me.
As for the Harvard Law Review run
ning an article called "Discovering the
Joys of a Semi-Automatic." The Harvard
Law Review, of which 1 am an executive
editor, is a fine publication. However, we
publish academic legal scholarship, not
odes to guns. The article in question was
written by a reporter at the Harvard Law
Record, our school newspaper.
