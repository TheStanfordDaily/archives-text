# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Diversity is a gift Stanford should use to benefit the world 
### MAURICE CHARLES GUEST COLUMNIST 
A-well chosen word can change your
lite forever.
On October 11,1993,1 placed a longdis
tance call to my bishop. My heart pounded
when the genteel Eastern voice said hello.
"Your Grace," 1 stammered. "There's
something I need to tell you. I have
watched many of my gay classmates in di
vinity school ground up by the ordination
process. And I don't want to slide through
just because I can pass, especially because of
my daughter. Either I will be a priest in this
church with integrity or not at all. I'm gay."
I lis reply blew me out of the water.
"So, tell me, Maurice," he began
thoughtfully, "How do you suppose God is
calling you to use this gift?"
While my bishop's compassion in that
moment has remained for me one of the
clearest examples of Christian charity,

what I will remember most about the con
versation is a single word: Gift.
My life as a black man in prestigious
universities had fully prepared me for my
sexual identity to be viewed as a problem.
I had grown up hearing about the race
problem. 1 sat through many discussions
of well-meaning people who used words
like acceptance, tolerance, or, the most
bewildering of all, inclusion.
But the good bishop's single word,
"gift," expanded the horizon. Over the
years, particularly my years at Stanford, I
have allowed his question to focus and
center my work. On occasion, when one of
the many couples I have prepared for
marriage says to me, "You sure have given
relationships a lot of thought."
1 don't hesitate to explain that my
thinking has been inspired by being gay,
which has forced me to think deeply
about what it means to risk all in order to
love. It has deepened my understanding

of commitment. Being gay has made me
keenly aware of the value of having one's
loves celebrated and blessed, by virtue of
its very denial to so many.
Where my priesthood has flourished, it
has not been in spite of my sexuality, but
because of it. It is, as my bishop so matter
of-factly suggested, a gift.
On the days when that gift is denigrated
or denied, my African-American ancestors,
are my inspiration and the source of my
courage. Their legacy as a people who
found the seeds of liberation in a Christian
religion offered by some as a tool of oppres
sion has proven one of their greatest gifts to
me. So too, then, my heritage is a gift.
When I first came to Stanford, I was as
sured that this gift would find here an envi
ronment where I could bring the 112 ullness of
my identities as a same-gender-loving,
African American Christian into my life and
work in this place. And I have been fortunate
enough to be disappointed only rarely. That

privilege has shaped how I will remember
my experiences here, and my openness to
returning as a visitor and friend.
When we do a job, read a text, make a
friend or speak our truths, we bring all that
we are and have been to the endeavor. And
only in those environments that are safe,
open and supportive can we flourish. Dur
ing my time here, 1 have walked beside
many who have not shared my good for
tune of flourishing so freely, whether out of
their own private fears or insecurities, or
because of others who perceived their iden
tities as a nuisance rather than a treasure.
My partnerships with those who seek to
ensure that this a safe and open space for all,
particularly the director and advisory board
of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Trans
gender Community Resource Center and
Stanford's African-American administrators
have been a way of offering to students the
privileges that I have enjoyed here. Sum
ford is a very special university. Everyone

deserves to experience it that way.
Recently our Dean of Admission, Robin
Mamlet, announced that Stanford has had
the good fortune of fashioning one of the
most culturally and ethnically diverse en
tering classes in its history.
Some onlookers may protest that this
University is too concerned with things
like inclusion, tolerance, political correct
ness, and doing the right thing to be taken
seriously as an academic institution. But
those who get it will recognize what so
many of us already know.
Diversity is a gift. And the University
that strives to become a place that openly
embraces people for all of who they are
and all of what they bring is a truly superi
or community of scholars.
So tell, me, Stanford, what do you plan
to do with your gift? The world is watching.
