### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
If last weekend's series loss to
Washington was a major setback for
the No. 4 Cardinal, then dropping
two of three games in Conallis,
Ore. this weekend was approach
ing disaster.

Stanford (29-12, 6-6 Pacific 10
Conference) lost back-to-back
games on Friday and Saturday to
Oregon State (27-15, 6-6) and
moved into a tie for fourth place in
the Pac-10, 3 1/2 games behind
league-leader Southern California.
The Cardinal's second consecu
tive series loss and its first losing
streak of the season dealt a major
blow to its hopes fora fifth confer
ence title in the last six years. How
ever, Stanford did gain ground yes
terday by pounding out an impres
sive and potentially momentum
building win against the Beavers
while the Trojans lost to Arizona.
For the first two games of the se
ries, though, the woes of the Cardi
nal batters continued to plague the
team. On Friday night, Stanford lost
the first night game ever played at
Goss Stadium at C loleman Field, 3-1.
The Cardinal managedjust four hits
— a season low — against Beavers
starter Ben Rowe. Half of the hits
coming in tiie game's final inning.
Stanford's Jeremy Guthrie elim
inated all injury doubts stemming
from his early exit last weekend in
Washington by throwing his first
complete game of the season. He al
lowed three runs on eight hits while
striking out five. Despite the solid
outing, Guthrie lost for the first
time in 12 decisions and 17 starts,
and fell to 6-1 on the season.
Rowe, a native Australian, al

lowed a home run by junior catcher
Ryan Garko to lead off the fourth in
ning, but little else. He stymied Car
dinal hitters all evening, retiring the
next 13 batters after Garko until se
nior shortstop Andy Topham
reached on an error in the eighth.
"You just sit back and see them
make pitch after pitch," Oregon
State head coach Pat Casey said of
the pitcher's duel. "We saw the No.
1 right-handed pitcher in the coun
try tonight [Guthrie], and Ben
Rowe matched him."
Rowe added, "It was all rhythm.
Tonight, 1 was trying to relax a little
more but still keep some intensity,
and that's a tough line to find."
Rowe certainly walked that line
Friday night, though he didn't
walk a single Cardinal batter. Also,
Rowe did what no other pitcher in
the nation had done in the Cardi
nal's first 38 games of the season —
keep senior second baseman Chris

O'Riordan from reaching base. In
addition to breaking that incredi
ble streak, Rowe ended O'Rior
dan's 12-game hit streak by forcing
him into an 0-fbr-4 evening.
Stanford threatened in the ninth
inning, putting two men on base
with two away, but Rowe retired
freshman first baseman Danny Put
nam on a fly ball to center to end the
ballgame.
On Saturday the largest crowd at
Oregon State since its 1999 stadium
renovation saw the Beavers hold
down the Cardinal for the second
straight day, 4-3.
"The crowd was awesome, and it
really helped us," Casey said. "It
was a great atmosphere."
Stanford junior Tim Cunning
ham and Oregon State's Stephen
Copeland were locked in a close
pitching matchup for most of an
evening that saw three ties and
two lead changes. The game's

final sequences in the bottom of
the eighth and top of the ninth in
nings, though, were what the
1,838 in attendance took away
from the contest.
Alter senior Dan Rich relieved
Cunningham in the Beavers' halfof
the eighth, he allowed a walk and a
one-out single to put men on first
and second in a 3-3 ballgame. Rich
then struck out an Oregon State
pinch-hitter on a wild pitch that
bounced past catcher Garko, allow
ing both runners to advance a base.
Garko threw to second, hoping
to nail the streaking runner and
end the inning, but his throw rolled
by second base into short center
field and allowed the eventual
game-winning run to cross the
plate for the Beavers.
Like Friday night, the Cardinal

Sophomore Drew Ehrlich hurls a pitch from the mound. As its offensive woes continued, the team's strong pitching

Stanford exploded for 13 runs on Sunday to avoid its first series sweep of the season.
had a chance to tie up the game in
the ninth as Topham singled with
two outs and stole second. Howev
er, Beavers closer Jared Sanders
struck out junior infielder Tobin
Swope on a full-count pitch to end

the ballgame.
Yesterday, Stanford responded
with a 13-0 drubbing of the
Beavers. Junior John Hudgins
threw a four-hit shutout to improve
to a perfect 7-0 on the season and
end the Cardinal's two-game losing
skid. It was the first complete-game
shutout for Stanford since Mike
Gosling's almost one year ago at
California and was Stanford's first

shutout of the season.
O'Riordan and sophomore out
fielder Sam Fuld each collected a
double and a home run on four-hit
afternoons to pace the reawakened
Stanford offense, and Fuld scored
five times in the blowout.
"Hudgins had a masterful per
formance today," said head coach
Mark Marquess. "It was also great
to see our offense get untracked."

Next up for the Cardinal in Pac
-10 play are the California Golden
Bears, who come to Sunken Dia
mond on Friday with an 8-10
league record after getting swept by
Washington over the weekend.
With half the conference schedule
complete, Stanford will need to
very nearly run the table in its final
12 games if it hopes to finish atop
the Pac-10 standings.
