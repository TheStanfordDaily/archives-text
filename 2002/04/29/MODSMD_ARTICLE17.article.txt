FOOTBALL
Saturday: Offense 54,
Defense 33, Cardinal and
While Game

It was the players' first
"game" experience in new
head coach Buddy Teevens' of
fensive system.
It was Coach Teevens' first
look at his new squad, includ
ing an incredibly young defen
sive unit.
At the annual Cardinal and
White Spring Football game, the
team's offensive power was clear
from the beginning. On his first
attempt of the day, quarterback
sophomore Chris i,ewis hit fresh
man Teyo Johnson fora 35-yard
touchdown. The duo was un
stoppable all day, as Johnson fin
ished with 83 yards and two
touchdowns on six catches.
"Johnson is a competitor,"
Teevens said. "He's got deceptive
speed fora big guy, He's almost
250 pounds but lie runs very well.
He has been really disciplined in
the spring, which has really im
pressed us."
Johnson, along with the other
offensive players, has had to ad
just to this year's more wide-open
offense.
"You have to be in great shape,
and there is a high stress on
routes," Johnson said. "But once
you get it right, it's unstoppable."
In the new open attack, quar
terback play is crucial. While
Lewis, sophomore Ryan Eklund
and freshman Kyle Matter all
played on Saturday, it was evi

dent that Lewis was the number
one guy on the team. He finished
the game 12-18 with 17(5 yards
passing and two touchdowns.
"Chris Lewis played well. I
thought he was accurate and I
thought we protected the pass
er well," said Teevens. "We
have guys who can catch the
football, and when it's all going
well, we have the capability to
move the football successfully
against anyone."
Willi expected starter junior
Kerry Carter out with a shoul
der injury, the Cardinal em
ployed numerous running
backs. Junior Justin Faust,
sophomore Kenneth Tolon
and freshman J.R. Lemon all
got a chance to run the ball as
the three players compete for
the backup job. Junior fullback
Casey Moore also ran the foot
ball, ending with 24 yards and
a touchdown on three carries.
The receiver corps is incredi
bly talented and may be the deep
est position on the team. Both ju
nior Ryan Wells and sophomore
Luke Powell return to their start
ing positions from last year, giv
ing the offense experience at the
position. Wells finished the scrim
mage with 58 yards receiving on
three touchdowns and scored a
touchdown on a reverse.
Powell did not play and was
forced to stand on the sidelines
with a groin injury. Including the
starting three, the team is six to
eight deep at the position. Junior
Caleb Bowman, sophomore
Creg Camarillo and freshman
Grant Mason all got time on the
field in Saturday's scrimmage.
On the defensive side of the
ball, the team is comprised pri
marily of new faces. Junior free
safety Colin Branch is the leader,
