# Expectations rise for men's golf
## Seki's win leads team to second-place Pacific 10 Conference finish 
### MATT BABIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's golf team
went into last weekend's Pacific
-10 Conference Championships in
Corvallis, Ore. with a lot of pres
sure on its shoulders.
Going up against nine ex
tremely strong teams, the Cardi

nal knew that if it didn't finish in
t lie top of the field, it might have
the rest of the spring to practice
and wonder what might have
been while its competitors trav
eled to New Mexico for the NCAA
Regional.
Of course, some teams just re
spond better to pressure. And it
seems, more and more, that this
year's golf squad is exactly one of
those teams.
Surprising many opponents
around the conference, the Cardi
nal left Corvallis with the second
place trophy and renewed hope in

the future of the season. Junior
Jim Seki took the top medalist
honors of the weekend, finishing
just one shot ahead of senior team
mate Phil Rowe.
With sophomore Blake
Mastalir also turning in a strong
finish in 11th position, the squad
proved that its second-place finish
two weeks ago at the U.S. Inter
collegiate was no fluke.
After the first round of play,
Stanford found itself in first place,
using great rounds by Seki and
Mastalir to edge ahead of home
team Oregon State. After slip
ping into third place after the sec
ond round, Saturday morning
found Stanford back in first posi
tion, tied with Southern Califor
nia. While USC was able to pull
away in the final round, that
didn't take anything away from
the weekend for head coach Jeff
Mitchell.
"I was really proud of the way
the team battled," he said.
Seki started off quickly, card
ing a first-round six-under 66 that
gave him a lead he would never
relinquish. Showing little evi
dence of the back pain that has
surfaced again and again for him
this year, he was able to hold off
his challengers through the later
rounds of the weekend.
It wasn't easy, as Seki had to
chip in fora birdie on the 18th
hole in the final round for the one
stroke difference that placed him
just ahead of Rowe and Southern
California's Kevin Stadler.
The finish also brings with it an
automatic placement on the First
Team All Conference squad.
Though other schools may
have been surprised by the Cardi
nal this weekend, Mitchell was
not. Pointing to Seki's seventh
place finish in Arizona three
weeks ago he said, "He's had a
couple real good finishes. He's

an individual title at last week's U.S. Intercollegiate, tied for second place at
this weekend's Pacific 10 Conference Championships.
