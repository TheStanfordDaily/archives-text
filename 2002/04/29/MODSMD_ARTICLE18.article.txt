# Expectations rise for men's golf
## Seki's win leads team to second-place Pacific 10 Conference finish 
### MATT BABIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's golf team
went into last weekend's Pacific
-10 Conference Championships in
Corvallis, Ore. with a lot of pres
sure on its shoulders.
Going up against nine ex
tremely strong teams, the Cardi

nal knew that if it didn't finish in
t lie top of the field, it might have
the rest of the spring to practice
and wonder what might have
been while its competitors trav
eled to New Mexico for the NCAA
Regional.
Of course, some teams just re
spond better to pressure. And it
seems, more and more, that this
year's golf squad is exactly one of
those teams.
Surprising many opponents
around the conference, the Cardi
nal left Corvallis with the second
place trophy and renewed hope in

the future of the season. Junior
Jim Seki took the top medalist
honors of the weekend, finishing
just one shot ahead of senior team
mate Phil Rowe.
With sophomore Blake
Mastalir also turning in a strong
finish in 11th position, the squad
proved that its second-place finish
two weeks ago at the U.S. Inter
collegiate was no fluke.
After the first round of play,
Stanford found itself in first place,
using great rounds by Seki and
Mastalir to edge ahead of home
team Oregon State. After slip
ping into third place after the sec
ond round, Saturday morning
found Stanford back in first posi
tion, tied with Southern Califor
nia. While USC was able to pull
away in the final round, that
didn't take anything away from
the weekend for head coach Jeff
Mitchell.
"I was really proud of the way
the team battled," he said.
Seki started off quickly, card
ing a first-round six-under 66 that
gave him a lead he would never
relinquish. Showing little evi
dence of the back pain that has
surfaced again and again for him
this year, he was able to hold off
his challengers through the later
rounds of the weekend.
It wasn't easy, as Seki had to
chip in fora birdie on the 18th
hole in the final round for the one
stroke difference that placed him
just ahead of Rowe and Southern
California's Kevin Stadler.
The finish also brings with it an
automatic placement on the First
Team All Conference squad.
Though other schools may
have been surprised by the Cardi
nal this weekend, Mitchell was
not. Pointing to Seki's seventh
place finish in Arizona three
weeks ago he said, "He's had a
couple real good finishes. He's

been right on the verge of having
a tournament like this all along."
Finishing just a shot behind
Seki was Rowe, who showed no
signs of cooling clown after win
ning the U.S. Intercollegiate at
the Stanford Golf Course. His
score of 285 (72-71-69-73) grant
ed him a share of second place
with Stadler, who finished second
to Rowe last week.
"I'm excited about the year
Phil Rowe has had," said Mitchell.
"He's an exceptional player, and
an exceptional person."
There's a lot of excitement
around the golf course these days,
as it appears that a berth to the
NCAA Regional is now more of an
expectation than a possibility.
"I'd be shocked if we weren't
in the Regionals," said Mitchell.
He presents a strong argu
ment. The Cardinal has now
placed second in its last two tour
naments, losing to USC in both
cases.
Aware of the weight added to
late-season tournaments, the
Cardinal is responding to the
added pressure, and playing
more like the team some people
expected earlier in the year.
Implicit in two second-place
finishes has been the defeat of
many formidable opponents.
Considered by some to be the
ninth team in the conference
going into last week's Intercolle
giate, the Cardinal's recent finish
es have turned the rankings up
side down.
"We've beaten some really
strong teams," explained
Mitchell, "and have a good
record against a lot of teams that
used to be ranked ahead of us.
It'll be interesting to see where
they put us now."
Interesting indeed. The Car
dinal will not have to wait long to
find out — the seedings for the
NCAA Regional will be an
nounced this Sunday.
