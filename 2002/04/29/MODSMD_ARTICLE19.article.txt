"We are just hoping one day things will start going
our way," said junior pitcher Tori Nyberg.
For the past few weekends, the No. 7 Stanford soft
ball team (37-14,4-11, Pacific 10 Conference) has given
some incredible performances, but things are just not
going its way.
The Cardinal is a member of the toughest con
ference in the nation and where it isn't uncommon
fora great team to suffer a tough defeat. In the Pac
-10, the true test is who has the strength to keep
fighting.
"I think everyone is working as hard as they can
right now," said junior pitcher Maureen LeCocq.
"We know that it is going to turn around eventually.
Everyone is giving 110 percent but the breaks just
aren't going our way. Our hits need to find eyes every
once in a while, but we are just going to keep on fight
ing and working hard. It is going to come around
when we need it to, when it matters."
It is this type of positive thinking and commitment to
the game that keeps the (ordinal going as it continues
to try and fight its way out of its current rut.

Friday night's game was one of the closest so far this
conference season.
The Huskies (39-15, 8-7) came down eager to get
some wins in the Bay Area and try to work their way up
in the conference.
Stanford also took (lie field hungry fora win follow
ing two tough weekends at home, but once again things
would not go the Cardinal's way.
Stanford out-hit Washington, but could not score.
Washington scored the winning run on an error by
freshman third baseman Leah Nelson in the top of the
seventh inning.

Cassi Brangham, but was unable to
string any of those hits together to
push a run across the plate.
The Cardinal returned to the
field Saturday to take on the No. 1
UCLA Bruins (44-6,12-3) in a re
match.
The last time the two teams
met it was a battle between the
best, but UCLA claimed victory by
a single'run.
This time around one, the Cardi
nal hoped things would go its way.
Unfortunately, this weekend
Stanford couldn't get a break.
The Bruins waged an attack in
the top of the third inning, scoring
10 runs on 10 hits to take a con
vincing lead. One of those hits was
a 2-run home run by senior catch
er Stacey Nuveman. The home
run tied the NCAA individual ca
reer home run record of 85.
UCLA would tag on three runs
in the next inning but in the top of
the fifth inning, the Cardinal dis
played its true competitive spirit.
After LeCocq reached base on a

walk, Nelson launched the third
home run of her career to post two
runs for the Cardinal.
Those two runs were not enough
as the game was called in the fifth
and the Bruins claimed a 13-2 victo
ry under the "mercy rule.".
But the Cardinal campaign in
the top of the fifth inning is a re
minder of what Stanford softball is
about — the will to keep fighting.
The Sunday face-off between
the two teams looked much dif
ferent, as the Cardinal and the
Bruins toojk. the field again, this
time in a close battle that ended
in a 2-0 UCLA victory.
Nyberg once again pitched an
incredible game, but Stanford was
unable to score.
The Cardinal is looking at this
weekend as a tool for the future.
"We know that the teams we see
every day are the teams we are
going to see in the [College] World
Series," said sophomore catcher Jes
sica aAllister. "And so we just need
to look at these kinds of games as
learning and building experiences."
Despite the outcome of this
weekend, the Cardinal remains
confident and aware of what it
needs to do to succeed —just keep
on fighting.
