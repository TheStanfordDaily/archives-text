### DANIEL URBAN STAFF WRITER 
Next weekend the Cardinal will focus all of
its efforts on defeating rival California in the
Big Meet. But this weekend, the Stanford
men's track and field team spread itself across
the nation and competed in the historic Penn
Relays as well as the UC-San Diego Invitation
al.
The highlight of the weekend came when
one of the longest-held school track records fell
at the hands of sophomore Omer I nan.
I nan has been hurling the discus incredibly
well since the beginning of the season, consis
tently matching his best throws from last year.
Such performances before the peak period
of the season are impressive by themselves, but
in San Diego, Inan launched a throw of 198
feet, seven inches, shattering his own personal
best and the school record.
"This last week has been my best week in
terms of training, and the conditions in San
Diego were perfect, so everything just came to
gether," said Inan.
Though veiy pleased with his throw, Inan
plans to improve even further before the NCAA.
Championship, where he placed eighth last year.
Glenn Shneider's mark of 196-1 held the top
spot in the Stanford record books since 1988.
Irian's throw, the sixth-best in the nation this
year, was his career best by eight feet, a re
markable margin of improvement.
Meanwhile, on the other coast, several Car
dinal runners competed in the annual Penn
Relays, held in Philadelphia.
Twice, Stanford faced distance running rival
Arkansas in a relay, and twice Stanford came
away the runner-up.
The distance medley relay took place on Fri
day with senior Gabe Jennings running the
1,200-meter leg, freshman Curtis Goehring the
400 meter portion, senior Mark Hassell the 800

meter section and senior Jonathon Riley the
mile. The four Cardinal runners finished the
race in a time of 9 minutes, 33.12 seconds, just
two seconds shy of Arkansas.
Riley and Jennings had more work to do, as
the mile relay was held the next day. Joined by
sophomores Don Sage and Grant Robison, the
four milers combined fora time of 16:17.05,
compared to the Razorbacks' 16:09.84.
Robison ran his leg in 3:57, the only Cardi
nal mile time under four minutes.

The 4x400-meter relay team, which has
been turning heads all season, also ran at the re
lays, and turned in yet another strong perfor
mance. junior Milton Little, freshman Curtis
Goehring, sophomore Nick Sebes and senior
Evan Kelty each made one lap around the track
fora team time of 3:09.96 to win their heat at
the Relays.
After much traveling in recent weeks, the
Cardinal will only have to cross the Bay to face
rival Cal on Saturday.
