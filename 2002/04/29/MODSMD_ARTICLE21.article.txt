### MINAYO NASIALI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's track team opened up a three
front offensive this weekend, with competitions at the Penn
Relays, California Open and UC-San Diego Invitational.
With strong individual and overall performances at
each of the two-day events, the Cardinal reemphasized its
depth and strength as both a cohesive unit and self-suffi
cient force.
The team showcased six athletes at the prestigious
Penn Relays in Philadelphia. Traditionally regarded as
the premier track event in the nation, the Penn Relays an
nually draw top-ranked schools to compete in two days of
relay events. Twenty-two hundred competing athletes
drew crowds of 50,000, in this highly publicized and tele
vised competition.
Not to be outdone, the Cardinal broke the school
record in the 4x1500-meter relay, with a time of 17 min
utes, 36.66 seconds. It placed second behind North Car
olina, who recorded a time of 17:33.67.
Stanford beat the old school mark of 17:37.27, which
was set at last year's Penn Relays. This year's team was
comprised of senior Ashley Wysong, redshirt senior Ma
lindi Elmore, sophomore Lauren Fleshman and senior
Maurica Carlucci.
In the distance medley relay, Stanford placed second
with 11:10.00 after a close race with North Carolina who
finished at 11:00.33.
In the 1,200-meter opening leg, Elmore ran a strong
3:24.9 to capture the lead. In the second segment of 400
meters, freshman Christine Moschella ran a 54.4 as North
Carolina took a narrow lead.
In the 800 meter portion, North Carolina continued to
maintain its slim lead while Wysong ran a persuasive
2:06.5. In the final leg, North Carolina finished with a
strong mile but Fleshman ran a consistent 4:44.2.
Meanwhile, on the Pacific coast, the Cardinal sent the
bulk of its forces to the Cal Open, while diverting a small
contingent to the UC-San Diego Invitational. During two
days of competition at Berkeley, the Cardinal maintained
a strong hold on events, with powerful individual perfor
mances in the 200-meter sprint, 100-meter hurdles, ham
mer and pole vault.
Redshirt senior Julie Tinker and freshman Lindsey
Smith monopolized the first and second spots in the 200-
meter sprint, with Tinker finishing first at 25:16.2, and
Smith placing a close second with 25:22.5.
In the 100 meter hurdles, senior Robyn Woolfolk ran a
powerful first place with a time of 14:51.9. Sophomore
Jessica Pluth threw a first place 192 feet, 11 inches, in the
hammer throw, while junior Kathleen Donoghue vaulted
an impressive 13-3 1/2 in the pole vault.
With top ten placings in all other events at the Cal
Open, the Cardinal called attention to its depth and over
all prowess as a contending team.
A shot put and discus contingent competed in the UC-

San Diego Invitational. Sophomores Molly Meyer and Jil
lian Camarena competed in both events, with Meyer plac
ing ninth in the discus with a distance of 172-4 and Ca
marena finishing 12th with 159-11. In the shot put, Ca
marena finished sixth with a length of 49-8 1/4.
So far, this season has been marked by stellar and
school-recording setting performances across the board.
Fleshman's time of 15:35.59 in the 5,000 meters during
last week's Mt. SAC] Invitational moved her to second

place all-time in Stanford school history.
Camarana also holds the second-place all-time distance
in the record books with this season's shot put throw of 5-
10 1/4. Pluth's career best of 192-8 in the hammer throw
is also good fora number two all-time ranking in school
history.
The team will gear up for this Friday's Cardinal Invita
tion held at Stanford followed by the Big Meet at Berkeley
on Saturday.
