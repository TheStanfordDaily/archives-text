# Three juniors prepare for launch of SCBN comedy show
## Sketch TV! 
### VAUHINI VARA EDITORIAL STAFF 
While voters denied the student-run Stanford
Cardinal Broadcasting Network's Special Fee re
quest this year, tonight's premiere of a new student
sketch comedy show is a sign that the station is still
fully operational.
In fact, the debut of "The Lincoln Report," airing
at 10 p.m. on SCBN (Channel 5 on campus televi
sions), represents one of the consequences of the
station's lack of funding — an increase in student
programming.
The students who appear on screen in"The Lin
coln Report" are also the ones behind the camera,
in the editing room and at the drawing board. Ju
niors Ben Friedland, Mike Pappas and Chris Van
Dyke —friends since their freshman year when
they lived in Junipero — do all the writing, filming
and editing themselves, as well as most of the acting.
They have, however, solicited the help of friends to
act in several scenes.
Sophomore Meg Shear said she enjoyed acting on
the show.
"As a neighbor and truly devoted fan of Chris, Ben
and Mike, I got involved because I was one of few will
ing females available during spring break," she said.
"It was the best — they even bought me a steak burg
er with cheese in exchange for many long hours spent
on the set."
LJnlike past sketch comedy shows at Stanford,
"The Lincoln Report" is scripted and more
"movie-like" in its creative process, according to
Pappas.
He added that unlike past shows, this one does not
employ "Stanford humor," such as fake roll-outs or
stunts in the Claw. The show does not address current
events, either, he said.
So what is it about, then?
"It tackles some talw>os," said
Pappas. "Social taboos."
"Some satire," said Van Dyke.
"Some weird," said Friedland.
"It hinges on the ridiculous,"
Pappas agreed. "That's Chris's
stock in trade."
Last year, a friend of the
group had them perform a live
minute comedy spot on his
KZSU radio show.
" That got us writing comedy to
gether," said Friedland. "And then
we just kind of wanted to start a
show. We all like comedy, we all
watch a lot of comedy."
Part of what makes the group
so enthusiastic about the show is
their relationship with each
other.
"1 think the dynamic of know
ing each other pretty well, and
having familiar humor and having
spent a lot of time together works
well," said Van Dyke.
Friedland explained, "Because
we've known each other fora long
time, we have a good dynamic and
there isn't... an ego conflict, so
that's been nice."
The trio said that producing
"The Lincoln Report" has been
surprisingly time-consuming.
Over spring break, they stayed at
Stanford to film sketches for the
first episode, working on the
show from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. for

six days.
"One of the greatest aspects
of the show are the people be
hind it," said senior Ilya Lya
shevsky, SCBN station manag
er. "Mike, Ben and Chris are
driven, dedicated, patient and,
as it happens, very funny. They
appear to enjoy the process of
producing the show for its own
sake, which is extremely impor
tant because it is very time-con
suming and not always as re
warding as it may seem from
the outside."
Matt Brutocao, SCBN's execu
tive producer-at-large, agreed
with Lyashevsky, saying,
" They're all completely dedicat
ed, they complement each other
well and they're funny as hell. 1
can definitely see The Lincoln
Report' becoming to Stanford
what 'Saturday Night Live' has
been on and off to America for the
past 27 years: a treasure chest of
jokes and characters that every
one knows."
So what do the guys hope to ac
complish through "The Lincoln
Report," which will be re-run at
10 p.m. all week and air its next
original episode on May IS?
Pappas: "I think I look taller on
camera."
Friedland: "You think so?"
Pappas: "No."
Van Dyke: "I've always wanted
to be 10 pounds heavier."
Pappas: "We want the show to
be funny and for it to be
watched ... in an ideal world, as a
result of the show, we all become
rock stars."
