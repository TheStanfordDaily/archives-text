While voters denied the student-run Stanford
Cardinal Broadcasting Network's Special Fee re
quest this year, tonight's premiere of a new student
sketch comedy show is a sign that the station is still
fully operational.
In fact, the debut of "The Lincoln Report," airing
at 10 p.m. on SCBN (Channel 5 on campus televi
sions), represents one of the consequences of the
station's lack of funding — an increase in student
programming.
The students who appear on screen in"The Lin
coln Report" are also the ones behind the camera,
in the editing room and at the drawing board. Ju
niors Ben Friedland, Mike Pappas and Chris Van
Dyke —friends since their freshman year when
they lived in Junipero — do all the writing, filming
and editing themselves, as well as most of the acting.
They have, however, solicited the help of friends to
act in several scenes.
Sophomore Meg Shear said she enjoyed acting on
the show.
"As a neighbor and truly devoted fan of Chris, Ben
and Mike, I got involved because I was one of few will
ing females available during spring break," she said.
"It was the best — they even bought me a steak burg
er with cheese in exchange for many long hours spent
on the set."
LJnlike past sketch comedy shows at Stanford,
"The Lincoln Report" is scripted and more
"movie-like" in its creative process, according to
Pappas.
He added that unlike past shows, this one does not
employ "Stanford humor," such as fake roll-outs or
stunts in the Claw. The show does not address current
