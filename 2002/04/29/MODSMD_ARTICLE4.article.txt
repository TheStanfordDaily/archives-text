War movies are good for Molly
wood, according to two-time Academy
Award-winning cinematographer
Haskell Wexler. And Hollywood's at
traction to the genre has, according to
Wexler, increased since Sept. 11.
This was just one of many topics of
conversation covered in a wide-rang
ing interview with Wexler, who will
speak today to students at the Gradu
ate School of Business about the film
maker's social responsibility and role
of corporations in the film industry.
"If a script is approved with [the
military's] changes, then [the produc
ers] get the use of military equipment;
that ups the psychology of militarism,
and that has been good for the box of
fice," said Wexler, whose 60-year ca
reer has spanned more than half the
history of cinema. War movies sell well
worldwide, he added, because they
rely on action, not subtlety.
Wexler's talk is part of a GSB work
shop entitled "The Entertainment In
dustry: Present Realities and Future
Possibilities," a course that invites se
lected television and film leaders —
representing each step in the indus
try from the creative process to mar
keting and distribution — to speak at

Stanford.
"Haskell is one of the greats," ex
plained course founder Bill Gut
tentag, a Hollywood director and
producer. "If you make a list of the
top einematographers, he makes the
short list."
Wexler, who has shot for John
Sayles, George Lucas, the Rolling
Stones and Frank Zappa, is the fourth
cinematographer ever to receive a star
on Hollywood Boulevard's Walk of
Fame. Awarded in 1996, it was the first
star given to a director of photogra
phy in more than 30 years.
Wexler, who has shot more than 40
feature films in Hollywood, has re
ceived five Academy Award nomina
tions resulting in two Oscars. They
were awarded to Mike Nichol's
"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' and
Hal Ashby's "Bound for Glory." Be
cause of his longstanding commit
ment to social documentaries, Wexler
has also been called the "People's Cin
ematographer." But respect for
Wexler's cinematography cuts across
all political lines in Hollywood.
Today's talk, which will be followed
by a question-and-answer period, will
be Wexler's first time speaking at a
business school. A frequent lecturer at
film schools, Wexler said he plans to
ask Stanford students, "If you are suc
cessful at the job you are learning in
this school, will that satisfy you as a
person?"
Wexler began shooting home
movies as a young boy. His first movie,
