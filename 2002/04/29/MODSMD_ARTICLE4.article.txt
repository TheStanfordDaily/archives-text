# Cinematographer to address GSB
## Wexler, who has won two Oscars, to discuss corporate influence in filmmaking 
### CÁITRÍN UNA MCKIERNAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
War movies are good for Molly
wood, according to two-time Academy
Award-winning cinematographer
Haskell Wexler. And Hollywood's at
traction to the genre has, according to
Wexler, increased since Sept. 11.
This was just one of many topics of
conversation covered in a wide-rang
ing interview with Wexler, who will
speak today to students at the Gradu
ate School of Business about the film
maker's social responsibility and role
of corporations in the film industry.
"If a script is approved with [the
military's] changes, then [the produc
ers] get the use of military equipment;
that ups the psychology of militarism,
and that has been good for the box of
fice," said Wexler, whose 60-year ca
reer has spanned more than half the
history of cinema. War movies sell well
worldwide, he added, because they
rely on action, not subtlety.
Wexler's talk is part of a GSB work
shop entitled "The Entertainment In
dustry: Present Realities and Future
Possibilities," a course that invites se
lected television and film leaders —
representing each step in the indus
try from the creative process to mar
keting and distribution — to speak at

Stanford.
"Haskell is one of the greats," ex
plained course founder Bill Gut
tentag, a Hollywood director and
producer. "If you make a list of the
top einematographers, he makes the
short list."
Wexler, who has shot for John
Sayles, George Lucas, the Rolling
Stones and Frank Zappa, is the fourth
cinematographer ever to receive a star
on Hollywood Boulevard's Walk of
Fame. Awarded in 1996, it was the first
star given to a director of photogra
phy in more than 30 years.
Wexler, who has shot more than 40
feature films in Hollywood, has re
ceived five Academy Award nomina
tions resulting in two Oscars. They
were awarded to Mike Nichol's
"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' and
Hal Ashby's "Bound for Glory." Be
cause of his longstanding commit
ment to social documentaries, Wexler
has also been called the "People's Cin
ematographer." But respect for
Wexler's cinematography cuts across
all political lines in Hollywood.
Today's talk, which will be followed
by a question-and-answer period, will
be Wexler's first time speaking at a
business school. A frequent lecturer at
film schools, Wexler said he plans to
ask Stanford students, "If you are suc
cessful at the job you are learning in
this school, will that satisfy you as a
person?"
Wexler began shooting home
movies as a young boy. His first movie,

made at age 12, shows images of
his family visiting Italy juxtaposed
to shots of fascist youths in Mus
solini uniforms.
Alter dropping out of UC-
Berkeley after one year, Wexler
joined the Merchant Marines in
1941, surviving two Nazi torpedo
attacks during his five-year
tenure. Later, his vessel was sunk
off the coast of northern Africa.
He drifted in a life-boat tor sever
al weeks, then lived in native vil
lages fora month.
He returned to Chicago,
where he made documentary and
educational films for 10 years, be
fore moving to California in 1955.
Wexler notes a difference be
tween audiences before the mid
-19505, when television became
popular, and today. Television al
tered audience expectations and,
as a result, the content of film
changed.
"When you sit in front of a TV
set, there is an obligation for them
to interest you ... a level of ex
citement for them to keep you
there for the commercials,"
Wexler explained.
"fit used to be with films that]
you would go with others into a
darkened room . . . the success
was the interaction between you
and the screen. People go in now
and talk more easily, are distract-

Ed . . . they need an overt tiling
to happen early on to grab them.
[This need affects] the cutting
patterns. | It] makes the close-ups
different."
Wexler said he believes films
today often make simplistic divi
sions between the "good guys"
and the "bad guys," or modern
versions of the "cowboy and Indi
an" antipathy.
"The act of doing is no longer
about bad and good but about
who does it and to whom they do
it," according to Wexler.
"Through our drama, we rewrite
history." This kind of moral rela
tivism, Wexler believes, extends
beyond moviemaking.
"Is it a worse deed," Wexler
asked, when a suicide bomber in
Israel blows herself up than
"when an Israeli soldier presses a
button on [a U.S.J Apache [gun
ship and blows up] an array base,
killing 20 people who happert to
be there?"
Wexler said he takes the mes
sages of films very seriously. He
quotes Samuel Goldwyn of MGM
fame, who once said, "If you want
to send a message, call Western
Union."
Wexler responds, "If we just
take messages without examining
them, we're being less honest with
ourselves."
His 40 documentaries have
taken him from Allende's Chile to
Nicaragua in the 1980s, to the Za
patistas in Mexico in 1995. He has
made three "bus" documentaries.

The first chronicled a cross-coun
try journey by bus to the 1963
March on Washington. His sec
ond documentary, finished in
1978, showed a group of people
traveling across the country to a
large peace demonstration in
New York City. His most recent,
finished in 1999, is about the Bus
Riders Union of Los Angeles and
its struggle against the city gov
ernment for funding.
Wexler, who recently celebrat
ed his 80th birthday, says he has
no retirement plans in sight.
"What would I do?" he said.
"We're in bad times right now . . .
this is not the time."
His next project is a documen
tary focusing on recent research
on excessive working hours and
their effect on people's perfor
mance and health, especially in
the film industry.
While the workshop enroll
ment is limited to 6(5 students, a
fixed number of slots are avail
able for non-business school stu
dents. Co-founders Guttentag
and Organizational Psychology
Prof. Rod Kramer plan to again
offer the course next spring

off the coast of northern Africa.
He drifted in a life-boat tor sever
al weeks, then lived in native vil
lages fora month.
He returned to Chicago,
where he made documentary and
educational films for 10 years, be
fore moving to California in 1955.
Wexler notes a difference be
tween audiences before the mid
-19505, when television became
popular, and today. Television al
tered audience expectations and,
as a result, the content of film
changed.
"When you sit in front of a TV
set, there is an obligation for them
to interest you ... a level of ex
citement for them to keep you
there for the commercials,"
Wexler explained.
"fit used to be with films that]
you would go with others into a
darkened room . . . the success
was the interaction between you
and the screen. People go in now
and talk more easily, are distract-

Ed . . . they need an overt tiling
to happen early on to grab them.
[This need affects] the cutting
patterns. | It] makes the close-ups
different."
Wexler said he believes films
today often make simplistic divi
sions between the "good guys"
and the "bad guys," or modern
versions of the "cowboy and Indi
an" antipathy.
"The act of doing is no longer
about bad and good but about
who does it and to whom they do
it," according to Wexler.
"Through our drama, we rewrite
history." This kind of moral rela
tivism, Wexler believes, extends
beyond moviemaking.
"Is it a worse deed," Wexler
asked, when a suicide bomber in
Israel blows herself up than
"when an Israeli soldier presses a
button on [a U.S.J Apache [gun
ship and blows up] an array base,
killing 20 people who happert to
be there?"
Wexler said he takes the mes
sages of films very seriously. He
quotes Samuel Goldwyn of MGM
fame, who once said, "If you want
to send a message, call Western
Union."
Wexler responds, "If we just
take messages without examining
them, we're being less honest with
ourselves."
His 40 documentaries have
taken him from Allende's Chile to
Nicaragua in the 1980s, to the Za
patistas in Mexico in 1995. He has
made three "bus" documentaries.

The first chronicled a cross-coun
try journey by bus to the 1963
March on Washington. His sec
ond documentary, finished in
1978, showed a group of people
traveling across the country to a
large peace demonstration in
New York City. His most recent,
finished in 1999, is about the Bus
Riders Union of Los Angeles and
its struggle against the city gov
ernment for funding.
Wexler, who recently celebrat
ed his 80th birthday, says he has
no retirement plans in sight.
"What would I do?" he said.
"We're in bad times right now . . .
this is not the time."
His next project is a documen
tary focusing on recent research
on excessive working hours and
their effect on people's perfor
mance and health, especially in
the film industry.

War movies are good for Molly
wood, according to two-time Academy
Award-winning cinematographer
Haskell Wexler. And Hollywood's at
traction to the genre has, according to
Wexler, increased since Sept. 11.
This was just one of many topics of
conversation covered in a wide-rang
ing interview with Wexler, who will
speak today to students at the Gradu
ate School of Business about the film
maker's social responsibility and role
of corporations in the film industry.
"If a script is approved with [the
military's] changes, then [the produc
ers] get the use of military equipment;
that ups the psychology of militarism,
and that has been good for the box of
fice," said Wexler, whose 60-year ca
reer has spanned more than half the
history of cinema. War movies sell well
worldwide, he added, because they
rely on action, not subtlety.
Wexler's talk is part of a GSB work
shop entitled "The Entertainment In
dustry: Present Realities and Future
Possibilities," a course that invites se
lected television and film leaders —
representing each step in the indus
try from the creative process to mar
keting and distribution — to speak at

Stanford.
"Haskell is one of the greats," ex
plained course founder Bill Gut
tentag, a Hollywood director and
producer. "If you make a list of the
top einematographers, he makes the
short list."
Wexler, who has shot for John
Sayles, George Lucas, the Rolling
Stones and Frank Zappa, is the fourth
cinematographer ever to receive a star
on Hollywood Boulevard's Walk of
Fame. Awarded in 1996, it was the first
star given to a director of photogra
phy in more than 30 years.
Wexler, who has shot more than 40
feature films in Hollywood, has re
ceived five Academy Award nomina
tions resulting in two Oscars. They
were awarded to Mike Nichol's
"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' and
Hal Ashby's "Bound for Glory." Be
cause of his longstanding commit
ment to social documentaries, Wexler
has also been called the "People's Cin
ematographer." But respect for
Wexler's cinematography cuts across
all political lines in Hollywood.
Today's talk, which will be followed
by a question-and-answer period, will
be Wexler's first time speaking at a
business school. A frequent lecturer at
film schools, Wexler said he plans to
ask Stanford students, "If you are suc
cessful at the job you are learning in
this school, will that satisfy you as a
person?"
Wexler began shooting home
movies as a young boy. His first movie,
