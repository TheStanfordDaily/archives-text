# Student leads course on anarchy
## 
### CHLOE CONGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Galen Weston had a lot of ex
plaining to do over winter break.
He came out to his family — as an
anarchist.
Most of Weston's relatives
thought of anarchism as "synony
mous with violence and chaos."
His aunt pictured "young people
with masks running around, wav
ing their hands in the air and
shouting unintelligibly."
Weston, a senior, does not fit
the stereotypical image of an anar
chist. The earth systems major
does not dress in black or wear a
menacing ski mask. In shorts, hik

ing boots and fuzzy plaid shirts, he
looks as though he's been caught
between a camping trip in the Sier
ras and surfing in Santa Cruz.
Last quarter Weston taught a
student-initiated course on anar
chism. One of the reasons Weston
initiated the course was to counter
popular misperceptions about an
archism. He also wanted to learn
more about its philosophy and its
history, and to expose students to
anarchist ideas.
Weston called the class "lie
hind the Black Mask: The Philos
ophy, History and Practice of An
archism." Eight students en
rolled in the class, and two others
audited. They read a variety of

anarchist authors from William
Godwin to the contemporary
group Crimethlnc.
What is anarchy? The word is a
combination of the Greek nega
tion prefix, "an" and "archos,"
meaning "authority" or "ruler."
Anarchy is the absence of authori
ty, be it political, social, economic
or religious.
But many followers claim anar
chism does more than reject au
thority — it prescribes an alterna
tive mode of living. According to
participant Dan Series, a senior
also majoring in earth systems, an
archism is also about self-determi
nation and "all the ways you act,
consciously trying to cooperate
with people in ways that don't so
lidify or set power relationships in
society."
To Weston, anarchism is "a per
spective that values human free
dom, a modern manifestation of
the ancient struggle to create a
world based on free association
and mutual aid."
So far, Weston is the only mem
ber of the class who calls himself an
anarchist. Freshman class member
David Martinez said, "I am com
munity-oriented, and I do happen
to agree with many of the princi
ples of anarchy."
Series doesn't identify himself
as an anarchist either, though he
agrees with much of its philoso
phy. "The term is really loaded; it
gets in the way. How much time do
you want to spend redefining
something?" he said, adding that
he prefers to define himself
through action, not words.
This presents a challenge for
many anarchists: how to live ac
cording to their ideals in capitalist
America.
"1 was just paying money and
being involved in this economic
system we live in, subjugating hun
dreds of thousands of people
across the globe living in horrible
conditions, and me being someone

who puts them in that position is
indirect violence," Series said.
Still, he explained that he must
compromise enough to get by, be
cause if he lived strictly by his ideals
he would be rendered practically
immobile.
Anarchists are typically criti
cized for being unrealistic. Peo
ple won't cooperate and orga
nize, the argument goes, so they
will be violent, self-serving and
create chaos.
But Weston maintains that
"there are countless examples of
people interacting for mutual
benefit without the intervention
of some type of authority or vio
lent hierarchy."
As an example he cites the con
cept of the pot luck dinner party.
Someone brings the wine, some
one else the salad and everything
works without a boss. He holds
that it is just such happenings, like
knitting circles, book groups and
loose gatherings of friends that
make life tolerable and constitute
the most enjoyable moments of
most people's lives.
Weston also finds it difficult to
reconcile his beliefs with the fact
that he benefits materially from
the dominant capitalist system,
but lie will continue to try by ac
tively opposing it. Weston partic
ipated in protests at the 1999
World Trade Organization in
Seattle and the 2000 Democratic
National Convention in Los An
geles.
He said he will continue his ac

tivism try to extricate himself from
"these relationships with domina
tion in the form of trying to stop
spending money and engaging in
the economic system."
He hopes to do so by develop
ing alternative means of fulfilling
basic needs.
A prominent anarchist thinker,
David Zerzan, spoke to the class on
the authoritarian and hierarchical
nature of technology. I le encour
aged the class to consider the ori
gins of the material goods they
take for granted.
Weston said he thinks of "the
long road back, first to the sweat
shop worker and then to whoever
was growing and picking the cot
ton and then to the tractor that was
made out of metal that was mined
someplace and it's this endless web
of dependence on extremely hor
rible jobs, most likely on squan
dered human lives."
Martinez felt despondent after
Zerzan's talk.
"I thought, I'm stuck here and
I'm screwing up people's lives. I
just want to be nice to people but
the way this whole thing is set up so
that 1 have to be mean to some
body, that I have to subjugate
other people."
Still, Martinez expressed
hope that he could make a small
difference.
"I saw another way that 1 could
live, a way that I could be sensitive
to the relationships that 1 cause
with every product, by interacting
with people."

Anarchists are typically criti
cized for being unrealistic. Peo
ple won't cooperate and orga
nize, the argument goes, so they
will be violent, self-serving and
create chaos.
But Weston maintains that
"there are countless examples of
people interacting for mutual
benefit without the intervention
of some type of authority or vio
lent hierarchy."
As an example he cites the con
cept of the pot luck dinner party.
Someone brings the wine, some
one else the salad and everything
works without a boss. He holds
that it is just such happenings, like
knitting circles, book groups and
loose gatherings of friends that
make life tolerable and constitute
the most enjoyable moments of
most people's lives.
Weston also finds it difficult to
reconcile his beliefs with the fact
that he benefits materially from
the dominant capitalist system,
but lie will continue to try by ac
tively opposing it. Weston partic
ipated in protests at the 1999
World Trade Organization in
Seattle and the 2000 Democratic
National Convention in Los An
geles.
He said he will continue his ac

tivism try to extricate himself from
"these relationships with domina
tion in the form of trying to stop
spending money and engaging in
the economic system."
He hopes to do so by develop
ing alternative means of fulfilling
basic needs.
A prominent anarchist thinker,
David Zerzan, spoke to the class on
the authoritarian and hierarchical
nature of technology. I le encour
aged the class to consider the ori
gins of the material goods they
take for granted.
Weston said he thinks of "the
long road back, first to the sweat
shop worker and then to whoever
was growing and picking the cot
ton and then to the tractor that was
made out of metal that was mined
someplace and it's this endless web
of dependence on extremely hor
rible jobs, most likely on squan
dered human lives."
Martinez felt despondent after
Zerzan's talk.
"I thought, I'm stuck here and
I'm screwing up people's lives. I
just want to be nice to people but
the way this whole thing is set up so
that 1 have to be mean to some
body, that I have to subjugate
other people."
Still, Martinez expressed
hope that he could make a small
difference.
"I saw another way that 1 could
live, a way that I could be sensitive
to the relationships that 1 cause
with every product, by interacting
with people."
Galen Weston had a lot of ex
plaining to do over winter break.
He came out to his family — as an
anarchist.
Most of Weston's relatives
thought of anarchism as "synony
mous with violence and chaos."
His aunt pictured "young people
with masks running around, wav
ing their hands in the air and
shouting unintelligibly."
Weston, a senior, does not fit
the stereotypical image of an anar
chist. The earth systems major
does not dress in black or wear a
menacing ski mask. In shorts, hik

ing boots and fuzzy plaid shirts, he
looks as though he's been caught
between a camping trip in the Sier
ras and surfing in Santa Cruz.
Last quarter Weston taught a
student-initiated course on anar
chism. One of the reasons Weston
initiated the course was to counter
popular misperceptions about an
archism. He also wanted to learn
more about its philosophy and its
history, and to expose students to
anarchist ideas.
Weston called the class "lie
hind the Black Mask: The Philos
ophy, History and Practice of An
archism." Eight students en
rolled in the class, and two others
audited. They read a variety of

anarchist authors from William
Godwin to the contemporary
group Crimethlnc.
What is anarchy? The word is a
combination of the Greek nega
tion prefix, "an" and "archos,"
meaning "authority" or "ruler."
Anarchy is the absence of authori
ty, be it political, social, economic
or religious.
But many followers claim anar
chism does more than reject au
thority — it prescribes an alterna
tive mode of living. According to
participant Dan Series, a senior
also majoring in earth systems, an
archism is also about self-determi
nation and "all the ways you act,
consciously trying to cooperate
with people in ways that don't so
lidify or set power relationships in
society."
To Weston, anarchism is "a per
spective that values human free
dom, a modern manifestation of
the ancient struggle to create a
world based on free association
and mutual aid."
So far, Weston is the only mem
ber of the class who calls himself an
anarchist. Freshman class member
David Martinez said, "I am com
munity-oriented, and I do happen
to agree with many of the princi
ples of anarchy."
Series doesn't identify himself
as an anarchist either, though he
agrees with much of its philoso
phy. "The term is really loaded; it
gets in the way. How much time do
you want to spend redefining
something?" he said, adding that
he prefers to define himself
through action, not words.
This presents a challenge for
many anarchists: how to live ac
cording to their ideals in capitalist
America.
"1 was just paying money and
being involved in this economic
system we live in, subjugating hun
dreds of thousands of people
across the globe living in horrible
conditions, and me being someone

who puts them in that position is
indirect violence," Series said.
Still, he explained that he must
compromise enough to get by, be
cause if he lived strictly by his ideals
he would be rendered practically
immobile.
