# Salsa! spices up dance scene
## Performance group kicks off workshops to teach students moves of sexy Latin dance 
### SARAH PAPÉ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Describe salsa dancing in two words. How about
"intellectualized sensuality"? That's how one member
of Salsa!, a performing arts group, formed in 1999,
characterized the dance style.
Since its creation, Salsa! has livened up the dance
scene at Stanford with sexy performances to high en
ergy salsa music.
"The workshops are very popular," said senior
Vlada Teper, the group's director. "We had over 100
people come last quarter to our beginning class."
Before Salsa! there was no student group on cam
pus that filled this niche. But since the group formed
on campus, students hoped to increase the influence
of a Latino culture at Stanford.
As a performance group, students dance for many
different events on and off campus. Last quarter, the
group also started teaching salsa workshops in addi
tion to performing for the community.
Co-director Nerissa Wong-VanHaren, '95, said,
"It's hard to maintain gender balance because believe
it or not, there are always more men interested than
women."
Teper and Labhesh Patel, '99, are teaching the
classes again this quarter. Though the beginning class
es are filled up, spots for women are still open in the in
termediate class.
Students can also learn by having Salsa! come to
their dormitory to give lessons.
"The music just makes you want to dance," Wong-
VanHaren said. "The rhythms are fun and make you
happy. Also, it's a very sexy dance."
The salsa dance originated in Cuba, but it also has a
combination of African rhythms, and a dance style
called Contra-Danze, which was brought over from
Europe.
"Salsa is actually a hybrid that emerged in the night
clubs of New York in the 19605," Wong-VanHaren
said. "It's faster than a cha-cha and rumba, but
smoother than a samba."
There are several different variations of the dance
under the heading "salsa." The dance style that Salsa!
uses the basic step, which is a back-and-forth motion,
rather than a circular motion.
"Salsa is a living club dance — a street dance —
not just a performance," Wong-VanHaren said.

"It's youthful, but it cuts through all age levels. I
have danced with fat, bald, old men who are fabu
lous salseros and they dipped and spun me with
great style."
Sophomore Tiffany Siles, a member of the group,
said for her the hardest part of dancing was letting go
of the urge to lead.
"I usually like to do individual work," she said.
"And there's not much of an opportunity to do that
with salsa."
But Wong-VanHaren added, "Dancing with a
partner is great because you get that
connection ... and you can play off each other, flirt,
strut, shake your booty."

leper's favorite part of salsa is
when she's at a club"and some
thing just connects with your
partner."
To be a good salsa dancer,
Wong-VanHaren said that "it's
better if you're not an introvert,
just because it's kind of flirtatious.
Anyone with rhythm and desire
can learn, but our best dancers are

either those with previous experi
ence or have grown up dancing
with their families."
Salsa! performs two to three
times per weekend with choreo
graphed dances. They applied for
special fees (his year to help out
with their budget, but they did not
receive it.
"We'd like to have more funds
so that we can throw more or better
campus parties and keep them free
of charge," Wong-Van Haren said.
"We were really disappointed
because we often get compliments

for being one of the more profes
sional and polished groups on
campus."
Salsa! is always looking for com
mitted dancers. Their auditions
will be next fall, but they are hop
ing to hold a workshop this year on
how to audition.
The classes are on Thursday
nights from 9 to 10 p.m. in Man
zanita Dining Hall. Cost is $30 for
students and $40 for non-students.
