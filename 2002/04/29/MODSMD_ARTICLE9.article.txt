# Moderate sunlight may prevent cancer
## Also: Some Americans found to be Aspirin-resistant and new search engine Teoma one-ups Google 
### AMIT GARG STAFF WRITER 
Excess sunlight increases exposure to
ultraviolet radiation and thus the risk of skin
cancer. However, a preliminary study has
found that moderate amounts of sunlight can
actually prevent cancer. Researchers ob
served spec ifically lower incidences of breast
and colon cancer for people who worked out
doors or lived in sunny climates.
They believe this would occur because sun
light stimulates the production of vitamin 1),
which may slow the growth of tumors. If the
hypothesis is correct, a glass of milk fortified
with vitamin I) might also do the job for those
living in colder climates.
Aspirin may not affect everyone equally,
according to a study published by Dr. Salim
Yusul from McMaster University.
Yusuf and colleagues found that about 30
percent of Americans are aspirin-resistant,
which means they have to take more or dif
ferent pills to achieve its effect. When this re
sistance occurs, it is inherent to one's metabo
lism, unlike a tolerance developed as a result
of overuse.
Aspirin is known for dulling headache
pain, but also for other effects such as reduc
ing by 25 percent the risk of cardiovascular
problems. It does this by blocking thrombox
ane, a chemical that promotes clot in arteries.
However, for some people this does not work.
Researchers observed that aspirin induced
significantly higher thromboxane levels in

some patients, increasing their risk of heart
disease almost threefold.
Did the end of the Space Race mean the
end of the Space Age? In recent years funding
for space programs has been insufficient to
meet rising expenses.
For example, NASA and Lockheed
poured $1.2 billion into an ambitious proto
type called X-33, deemed to be a revolution
in reusable launch vehicles. They finally
abandoned the project in March 2001 be
cause of tight budgets. NASA is also review
ing its $4.8 billion Space Launch Initiative
and has relegated more ambitious ideas to
the future.
Some critics suggest the space agency is fal
tering because it is trying to improve technol
ogy too fast, and that instead it should exploit
current methods before attempting some
thing new.
Teoma seems to be the newest revolution
for search engines. Teoma.com, from the
same company that produced Askjeeves,
ranks hits according to how many sites on a
specific subject link to it. This is an improve
ment over Google, which ranks hits according

to the number of sites that link to it.
In the history of search engines, Yahoo
was the first to become really popular, and
originally kept a list of Web sites through
which to search. Google emerged into the
scene in 1999 and within a year, Yahoo was
forced to adopt Google as its underlying
search engine. Gould this happen again with

Global warming could be more dramatic
than the current moderate predictions. Ac
cording to two new climate studies, the long
range outlook seems negative, especially for
the years 2020 to 2030.
A British study predicts earth will be 0.5 to
2.3 degree Fahrenheit warmer, and a Swiss
study predicts it will be 0.9 to 1.9 degrees
warmer. In either case, the increase would be
sufficient to melt substantial portions of the
polar ice caps and flood many coastal cities. It
would also disrupt cycles of rain and drought
and create general havoc in our planet's climate.
The Cold War may be officially over, but
the damage it caused is still evident. Geneti
cist Yuri Dubrova of the University of Leices
ter in Britain studied three family genera
tions in a Russian nuclear test site.
She discovered that the DNA of adults liv
ing between 1949 and 1963, during the
heaviest testing, had twice the mutation rate
of those never exposed to radiation. Chil
dren born long after also showed the effects,
with 50 percent higher mutation rates than
normal.
The researchers estimated that adults had
been exposed to about one sievert of radia
tion. Martin Brown, professor of radiation
oncology at Stanford Medical School, said
that these observations agree with the dou
