Wanted: Major Player
You:
You're a smart, creative individual
with a passion for gaming and a flair
for communicating [in print and in
person]. You hold [or will soon be
graduating] with a BA or equivalent
degree and yearn to put it to good
use. You're a fast learner, a good
collaborator and persistence is your
middle name. You're as comfortable
in Excel as you are in MS Word.
Your Mission:
Build consumer insistence for
Blizzard products by helping to
execute marketing plans based on
research, analysis and your infinite
wisdom of games. The devil is in the
details but that's exactly where you
like to be, coordinating promotions
from print advertising to packaging
to game tournaments. You'll
tirelessly evaluate data from the
world over and you want to push the
envelope when it comes to delivering
high quality, high impact
communications.
Blizzard Entertainment offers a
competitive salary and benefits pack
age. For immediate consideration,
send your resume and a cover letter
that gives us an idea of why you'd call
yourself a major player to:
