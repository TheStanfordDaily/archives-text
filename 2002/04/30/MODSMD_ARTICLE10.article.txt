Hundreds of Internet radio stations
plan to go silent Wednesday to protest
proposed record-label royalty pay
ments they say would endanger their
industry.
Radio Free Virgin, Stanford Uni
versity's KZSU, Choice Radio and
KING of Seattle are some of the Web
radio services that will take part with
either total silence or non-stop public
service announcements on the issue.
This follows last week's move by mem
bers of Congress to take up the cause
of Internet radio — an increasingly
popular form of Web entertainment.
Twenty congressional representa
tives sent a letter urging the U.S.
Copyright Office to make sure the new
rates don't harm Net broadcasters.
The copyright office has until May 21
to accept or reject new rates recom
mended in February by an arbitration
panel.
