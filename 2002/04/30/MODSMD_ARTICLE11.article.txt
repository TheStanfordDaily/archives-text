# New trees planted in record numbers
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford has found itself at the top of the
rankings once again. This time, however, it is
not concerning the University's academic or
sports programs, but for its extensive planting
of trees. No non-governmental organization on
the Peninsula has put in place as many trees as
Stanford has.
With over 8,180 acres of land, including the
Stanford Shopping Center, the Stanford Re
search Park — a corporate park off of Page Mill
Road — various residential areas, the core
campus and the Foothills, there have been
many opportunities to plant.
Ramsey Shuayto, the asset manager for the
Stanford Research Park, discussed how re
cent landscaping designs for the park's devel
oping projects have considered tree place
ment carefully.
"[Stanford] is adding trees when taking
down old buildings. We are adding many more
trees than were there originally," Shuayto said.
Shuayto said that most of the trees planted
were either oak or redwood species.
He then discussed how each tree-placement
decision is made.
"We look at each site individually as opposed
to the whole research park," Shuayto said. "We
are focused primarily on how the site will be
used by the company that will inhabit it.
"We set the building back far from the street
and then plant as many of the native trees as
possible," lie continued.
He said that all the plans for tree placement
must first be examined and approved by the ap
propriate city government departments.
Shuayto explained that trees already present
are sometimes relocated. This is done instead of
planting new seedlings in the more convenient
locations on site.
"Sometimes we relocated [healthy] trees that
were of a desirable spec ies in both ours and the
city of Palo Alto's opinion," Shuayto said. "Typ
ically it is the species of tree and the size of tree
and its health that determines if relocation can
be accomplished."
However, often full-grown trees raise prob

lems in the transportation component of the re
location process.
"Typically oaks and redwoods, when they
reach a certain size, there are very few people
who will move such a tree," Shuayto said.
"When it reaches a certain weight, there are
only so many cranes that can lilt it up; it be
comes logistically very difficult."
Students seem to appreciate that the Stan
ford campus and its surrounding areas are
more densely wooded these days.
"When I first came to Stanford, I was
amazed at the beauty of the campus and sur
rounding area," said freshman Thomas Hana

cla. "The extra trees are a very attractive addi
tion in my opinion."
Not all students felt the trees were an impor
tant part of campus.
"What trees?" asked junior Srinivas Pangu
luri. "I guess the Arboretum is kind of nice, but
1 don't really notice them that much."
I lerb Fong, the grounds manager for Stan
ford, said over 750 trees in the past five years
have been planted on the core campus.
Shuayto estimated that some 3,000 trees had
been added in the Research Park area. He
noted that more were on the way.
"We're doing the best we can," Shuayto said.
