### KATIE TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Junior Daniel Wright took first place
2002 Sun Microsystems, Inc. and Top-
Coder Collegiate Challenge. He won
$100,000 in the contest, held the weekend
of April 19 in Cambridge, Mass.
The Collegiate (challenge is a tournament
consisting of 75-minute rounds in which
contestants must solve three problems.
Wright got involved in the Top Coder
competitions at the time of its first con
test — last year's collegiate challenge —
when a friend told him about a flier he had
seen advertising the competition. He regu
larly competes in Top Coder's biweekly Sin
gle Round Matches.
"I have entered almost every Top Coder
contest since then," Wright said.
Contestants are given points for speed
and accuracy.
Each round contains problems at three
different levels, with the third being the
most difficult and worth more points.
Next, the competitors begin a challenge
round in which they look at other contes
tants' solutions and try to find and correct
bugs, for which they collect more points.
After multiple-elimination competi

dons, the top 16 contestants are flown to
Massachusetts for the semifinals and finals
of the tournament.
Wright made it to the semifinals of the
Collegiate Challenge last year, and came in
second at the Top Coder Invitational, a sep
arate tournament. His prize money from
these previous contests totals $47,064.
As for the $100,000 prize money from
his latest competition, Wright says, "I'm
going to try to be sensible—l'm trying
hard to resist the urge to go on a spending
spree and waste it all."
"I'll pay off all my student loans, and
maybe buy a car," Wright continued. "After
that, I'll invest the remainder, and try to
make it last as long as possible."
In the semi-finals of the Collegiate Chal
lenge, Wright won his room with 1114.91
points, the highest total of the competition.
He was the only contestant to answer all
three of the problems.
In the final round Wright used a slight
ly different strategy from most of the com
petitors. I le began with the level two prob
lem, then moved on to the level three
problem which he left unfinished to work
on the level one problem. All of the other
finalists were able only to complete the
level one problem.
