### KHANH LAI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Students and community leaders
gathered in the Psychology Building on
Saturday to discuss various mental
health issues affecting the Stanford com
munity. Sponsored by United Students
for Veterans' Health, "Going Crazy at
Stanford" featured speakers from local
and county mental health organizations.
The conference highlighted various
topics related to mental health, such as
living with mental illness and the stigma
that prevents students from seeking
help. The Surgeon General estimates
that one in five American adults and chil
dren are affected by mental disorders
each year.
"Many families hide it," according to
Navah Statman, Santa Clara County
president of the Santa Clara Country
Chapter of the National Alliance on
Mental Illness.
The lack of understanding of the bio
logical basis of mental illness leads to the
case where "half of the community
thinks that it's a lifestyle choice, and the
other half of the community thinks that
you can just pull yourself up from your
bootstraps," Statman said.
The conference showcased a panel of
members from the Alliance for Commu
nity Care who testified about how men
tal illness has affected their lives. The
panelists are living with depression,
bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.
They told stories of loneliness and trau
ma, repeated hospitalizations and times
of homelessness. During these times,
street drugs became a form of self-med

ication and escape from the pain of living
with their illnesses.
"Mentally ill people have to function
in society with society's rules, but we
have to function with a chemical imbal
ance," said Jim, one of the panelists.
While mental illness is equally com
mon among Americans of all groups,
"the Bay Area has a particular problem
with mental illness because of the lack of
affordable housing," said Jim Burklo,
the former director of the Urban Min
istry of Palo Alto.
With two VA 1 lospitals near by, "Palo
Alto is a mental health inecca," lie said.
Pablo Garcia-Ganan from the San
Mateo Gounty Department of Mental
1 lealth said that "our mental health sys
tem is immoral; instead of piitting peo
ple with mental illness in hospitals, we're
putting them in jail and on the streets."
Mentally ill patients face difficulties
in obtaining health insurance cover
age, and often must turn to the inade
quate and overburdened public
health system for help. For such peo
ple, the lack of treatment can lead to
homelessness and jail time. According
to the Justice Department, about 30
percent of the homeless and 20 per
cent of prisoners live with some form
of mental illness.
The Stanford student community is
not immune to mental illnesses that are
prevalent among the homeless. Accord
ing to Alejandro Martinez, director of
(counseling and Psychological Services,
there has been a dramatic jump during
the past two years in students seeking
help, and needing medication and hos
pitalization.

"More students coming to Stanford
are coming in with challenging psy
chiatric conditions," said Martinez.
More than before, they are taking
medications to help them cope with
academic pressures.
For most students, college is a time of
many firsts, such as a first love, first
breakup or first time failing a test. These
changes are psychologically challenging
to many students who must learn to
manage their problems while handling a
rigorous academic load.
Despite the free counseling services
that CAPS provides, many students are
reluctant to seek help because of the stig
ma associated with mental illness. The
biggest barrier to students taking advan
tage of Stanford's resources is the belief
that seeking help is a surrender of the
self and admittance of failure.
"Newer students, especially male
freshmen, are the most resistant to get
ting help, because of the focus on self-ef
ficacy and establishing independence,"
said Martinez.
"It's powerful to hear people's testi
monies. For the Stanford community in
particular, there are more incidences of
mental illness than people are aware of,"
said Brady Gordon, a senior and the or
ganizer of the conference.
"Stanford students need to play a role
in addressing and not contributing to
the systematic injustices of our society,"
Gordon said.
"Events like these help me to see
that I'm not a freak, and [to] find
strength to regain my humanity and
dignity," said Peter, a panelist who lives
with depression.
