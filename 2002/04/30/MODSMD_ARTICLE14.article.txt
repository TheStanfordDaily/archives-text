## The 						Stanford Daily Mental illnesses must be treated, understood 
### 
Published Since 1891

The presentation of "Going Crazy at
Stanford" by the United Students
for Veterans' Health is a step in the
right direction to recognizing and
treating mental health issues on campus.
In the past two years, there has been a dra
matic increase in the number of reported cases
of mental illness at Stanford. The stress associ
ated with rigorous classes and pressures to suc
ceed drives many Stanford students to use
medications — prescribed and unprescribed
— and triggers many forms of mental illness.
Depression is an especially common form
of mental illness on campus. According to
Counseling and Psychological Services, the
dramatic changes students experience dur
ing the four years of college trigger many in-

stances of mental illness.
Stanford has many excellent resources to
treat those who suffer from mental illnesses.
CAPS provides free professional counseling,
and the Bridge offers a 24-hour hotline and
peer and group counseling. Both of these or
ganizations provide services that students
suffering from depression or other mental
illnesses should take advantage of.
We are distressed, however, that CAPS re
ports that the stigma attached to mental ill
ness deters many from seeking help. CAPS
and other campus service organizations have
the resources to help students work through
times of difficulty.
We hope that by promoting awareness of
mental illness around campus, people will

begin to treat it less as a disease of shame and
more as a real disease with viable treatment
options that students should seek.
Because Stanford has a heavily residential
support structure, we believe that house staff
and housemates play an important role in
helping their friends through mental illnesses.
These people are the first line of defense
against a problem which may get much more
serious without treatment. We hope that they
will refer their friends to CAPS or other ap
propriate services when they feel that their
friends need treatment.
We also hope that the Peer Health Educa
tors in individual dorms can build on the
events of Saturday with programming for each
residence. Mental health issues should be dis-

ashamed to seek treatment when they realize
that they are suffering from a mental illness.
Stanford has an impressive — yet under
utilized — infrastructure for dealing with
mental illness on campus. Many students

could be treated if they only sought help. We

feel more comfortable seeking help from
mental health professionals.
