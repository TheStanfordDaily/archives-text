# SHOOTING FROM THE HIP
## The 						accomplishments of the quieter activists 
### 
The Reverend Jesse Jackson
rode into town last week and
gave his oft-repeated call lor
activism in the pursuit of social
justice. Jackson, as we all know, has been
a crusader for civil rights and social jus
lice all his life. He has inspired millions
and annoyed the hell out of millions
more. But love him or hate him, you
can't argue with the fact that his bold, in
your-face methods have done a lot to
change American society for the better.
Jackson, Medger Evers, Martin
Luther King — these are the kinds of
men we associate with the civil rights
struggle and social activism in general.

They organized march
es, staged sit-ins, gave
fiery speeches, and
forcefully brought racial
injustice into the nation
al consciousness.
But, as important as
these measures were
and are to the cause of
civil lights, they are not

the only way to achieve this goal. My all
time favorite civil 1 ights leader is a man
cut from a very different cloth.
His name is Sam Cunningham. To the
best of my knowledge, Sam never partici
pated in a single c ivil rights march. He
never engaged in a sit-in, never organized
a boycott, and never wrote a single speech
denouncing racism. And yet, Sam was ar
guably as important as Jackson, Kvers or
King in furthering the cause of civil rights.
Sam Cunningham was a football play
er. More specifically, he was a fleet-foot
ed, strong-as-an-ox tailback for South
ern California in the early 70's. Oh yeah,
he's also black.
On Sept. 12, 1970, Cunningham's
USC squad traveled to I uscaloosa, Ala.
to take on the Alabama Crimson Tide.
Like all prominent college teams in
the Deep South, the Alabama squad was
all white. Segregation may have been
starting to crumble by this time, but loot
ball has always been ;i religion in the land
of Dixie. And Southern white society was
not about to let black athletes become
their gods.
To make a long story short, Sam ran
wild that day. He rumbled for 135 yards
and two touchdowns on just 12 c arries as
USC humiliated Alabama, 41-14. Leg
endary Alabama coach Bear Bryant saw
the writing on the wall. After the game,
he asked (lunningham to stop by the Al
abama locker room. Addressing his all
white squad, I he Bear pointed to Cun
ningham and said "Men, this is what a
football player looks like."
The very next season the Crimson
I ide football team had three black play
ers. And such was the stature of Bear
Bryant that once he recruited black ath
letes, other coaches were quick to follow
suit. |ust like that, segregation in South

ern college football was over.
Some might say: "so what?" In the
grand scheme of things, integration of
football teams doesn't seem all that im
portant. But such people don't under
stand the pull of the gridiron on Alaba
ma society.
Every Alabama boy worth his salt
grows up idolizing Crimson Tide foot
ball players, and this fierce love doesn't
stop until the day lie dies. When blacks
started becoming the objects of this ado
ration, it was a watershed event for race
relations. In fact, it has become a com
mon saying in Alabama that Sam Cun
ningham did more to integrate the state
in (j() minutes than Martin Luther King
did in 20 years.
The point is that its not just the Jesse
Jacksons of the world who are important
in the fight for civil rights. Just as crucial
are the Sam Cunninghams — the quiet,
unassuming individuals who give the lie
to racist attitudes simply by achieving ex
cellence in their chosen fields.
The vocal activists get all the hurrahs,
the statues, and the mention in history
books. And God knows they deserve it
all. But as much as we laud Jesse Jackson
and others like him, we can't forget or
trivialize the contributions of all the doc
tors, lawyers, professors, athletes,
singers, scientists and entrepreneurs
who prove, through their everyday ac
tions, that excellence is color blind.
Of course, there are limits to the Sam
Cunningham style of social activism. It's
great for breaking down racist attitudes,
but not so well-suited for, say, crusading
against pollution or fighting fora living
wage for janitors. Still, there's plenty of
discrimination in this world, against
plenty of different groups, and the sim
ple pursuit of excellence is perhaps our
most powerful tool for fighting it.
Here at Stanford, then, it's not just
the members of our myriad activist
groups who are the civil rights leaders
of tomorrow. It's all of us — the 3,000-
some racially, ethnically and culturally
diverse undergraduate and graduate
students who each year go off into the
world and do great things in a hundred
different fields. Ihe Arab Computer
Science major diligently crunching
code in his room can be as powerful a
voice against rac ism as the Muslim Stu
dent Awareness Network member who
pickets and marches against racial pro
filing.
No doubt, a few of us are destined to
become Jesse Jac ksons. But far more of
us will end up becoming Sam Cunning
hams. And when it comes to lighting
racism and discrimination, the latter are
just as important as the former.

The Reverend Jesse Jackson
rode into town last week and
gave his oft-repeated call lor
activism in the pursuit of social
justice. Jackson, as we all know, has been
a crusader for civil rights and social jus
lice all his life. He has inspired millions
and annoyed the hell out of millions
more. But love him or hate him, you
can't argue with the fact that his bold, in
your-face methods have done a lot to
change American society for the better.
Jackson, Medger Evers, Martin
Luther King — these are the kinds of
men we associate with the civil rights
struggle and social activism in general.

They organized march
es, staged sit-ins, gave
fiery speeches, and
forcefully brought racial
injustice into the nation
al consciousness.
But, as important as
these measures were
and are to the cause of
civil lights, they are not

the only way to achieve this goal. My all
time favorite civil 1 ights leader is a man
cut from a very different cloth.
His name is Sam Cunningham. To the
best of my knowledge, Sam never partici
pated in a single c ivil rights march. He
never engaged in a sit-in, never organized
a boycott, and never wrote a single speech
denouncing racism. And yet, Sam was ar
guably as important as Jackson, Kvers or
King in furthering the cause of civil rights.
Sam Cunningham was a football play
er. More specifically, he was a fleet-foot
ed, strong-as-an-ox tailback for South
ern California in the early 70's. Oh yeah,
he's also black.
On Sept. 12, 1970, Cunningham's
USC squad traveled to I uscaloosa, Ala.
to take on the Alabama Crimson Tide.
Like all prominent college teams in
the Deep South, the Alabama squad was
all white. Segregation may have been
starting to crumble by this time, but loot
ball has always been ;i religion in the land
of Dixie. And Southern white society was
not about to let black athletes become
their gods.
To make a long story short, Sam ran
wild that day. He rumbled for 135 yards
and two touchdowns on just 12 c arries as
USC humiliated Alabama, 41-14. Leg
endary Alabama coach Bear Bryant saw
the writing on the wall. After the game,
he asked (lunningham to stop by the Al
abama locker room. Addressing his all
white squad, I he Bear pointed to Cun
ningham and said "Men, this is what a
football player looks like."
The very next season the Crimson
I ide football team had three black play
ers. And such was the stature of Bear
Bryant that once he recruited black ath
letes, other coaches were quick to follow
suit. |ust like that, segregation in South

ern college football was over.
Some might say: "so what?" In the
grand scheme of things, integration of
football teams doesn't seem all that im
portant. But such people don't under
stand the pull of the gridiron on Alaba
ma society.
Every Alabama boy worth his salt
grows up idolizing Crimson Tide foot
ball players, and this fierce love doesn't
stop until the day lie dies. When blacks
started becoming the objects of this ado
ration, it was a watershed event for race
relations. In fact, it has become a com
mon saying in Alabama that Sam Cun
ningham did more to integrate the state
in (j() minutes than Martin Luther King
did in 20 years.
The point is that its not just the Jesse
Jacksons of the world who are important
in the fight for civil rights. Just as crucial
are the Sam Cunninghams — the quiet,
unassuming individuals who give the lie
to racist attitudes simply by achieving ex
cellence in their chosen fields.
The vocal activists get all the hurrahs,
the statues, and the mention in history
books. And God knows they deserve it
all. But as much as we laud Jesse Jackson
and others like him, we can't forget or
trivialize the contributions of all the doc
tors, lawyers, professors, athletes,
singers, scientists and entrepreneurs
who prove, through their everyday ac
tions, that excellence is color blind.
Of course, there are limits to the Sam
Cunningham style of social activism. It's
great for breaking down racist attitudes,
but not so well-suited for, say, crusading
against pollution or fighting fora living
wage for janitors. Still, there's plenty of
discrimination in this world, against
plenty of different groups, and the sim
ple pursuit of excellence is perhaps our
