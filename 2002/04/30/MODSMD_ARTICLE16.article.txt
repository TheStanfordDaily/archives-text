Brewer reflects on ASSU election
Monica Henestroza and Nick Ro
driguez are great leaders and will serve
the entire student body with diligence and
integrity. As outgoing president, I was in
volved in the ASSU elections period, with
eyes and ears behind doors to observe be
havior of candidates, their supporters and
their antagonists.
The elections were successful in pro
ducing two qualified candidates who will
greatly connect with students and use past
experience to further the Association. In
the case of the elections themselves, 1
judge overall success by the means rather
than the end results. The Elections (loin
mission did a stellar job performing its
functions and working with students and
the administration to create a positive ex
perience for all involved in the process.
However, I was disappointed to find
that, in some instances, students treaded
and even crossed the fine line that lies
between expressing opinion and dehu
manizing peers.
The students who vie for ASSU execu
tive offices are attempting to serve the stu
dent body to the extent that they will com
promise academics, sacrifice friendships,
and set aside personal interests in pursuit
of the common welfare of the association.
For this reason, the mere candidacy of
any slate, two people who are willing to
make such sacrifice, is admirable. Further
more, most candidates who run are in po
sition to do so only by committing them
selves to student causes both through the
ASSU and other sectors of campus life.
Such commitment ultimately
strengthens the conditions of Stanford
students. Thus, we are inherently un
grateful when we transcend the expres
sion of our opinion to personal attacks
that undermine their commitment and
willingness to sacrifice, ultimately for the
benefit of the student body.
Exchange of perspective, debate about
issues, and comparisons of candidates are
all vital to campus democ racy. However,
those who exert energy only to disrespect
fully complicate the lives of candidates
might better spend their own energy im
proving conditions of the student body.
The first ASSU elections were lie-Id in
1891. Since then, the association has
evolved from an organization that made
lowly decisions "like how many stripes
would be on the cheerleaders' uniforms"
to a more resourceful association that allo
cates over $1 million to student groups,
maintains service projects, upholds stu
dent voice, enriches conditions and oilers
many forms of representation and service
for the entire student body.
The ASSU is financially autonomous
from the University and remains stable by
the revenue of our business branch Stan
lord Student Enterprises and a multi-mil
lion dollar endowment.
I lie leadership of this office has the
potential to affect the daily conditions of
many student aspects. Though such
awareness is more the exception than
norm, the degradation of potential
ASSU officers cannot be- justified by a
lack of understanding about the sense ol
duty embodied in the job. I his job is too

serious to reduce its selection to hearsay
or campaign-inflicted election handi
caps. While campaigning can, and
should be, a fun experience for all, one
student's fun should should not be at the
expense of another's fundamental enti
tlements, such as dignity and respect.
As Stanford students, and moreover as
human beings, we must act with respect
for others and align our thoughts and be
havior with consideration for our neigh
bors so that we might ultimately improve
the means by which are beloved student
leaders acquire student body leadership.

ASSU President

A rejected applicant speaks out
I just wiint equality in the Row Resi
dent Assistant application process. Cur
rently, new applicants — people who
have never been an RA anywhere — are
treated differently than re-applicants —
a current or former RA who is applying
to RA again for the next year.
Every Row RA applicant should be
able to sign up lor a first-round interview
or every Row RA applicant should have
his or her application read and screened
before receiving a first-round interview.
Doesn't that seem more logical than the
current system of having one standard
for new applicants and one standard for
re-applicants when determining who
gets a first-round interview? Especially
when the new applicant standard is "can
you use a pen to sign up on a piece of
paper" and the re-applicant standard is
"does your application and RF recom
mendation make us believe that you will
lit the 'vision of the Row'"?
While I totally agree with Asst. Direc
tor of Residential Education |osh
Schiller that being a Row RA and a dorm
RA pose vastly different challenges, that
doesn't make new RA applicants any
more qualified than re-applicants. By
denying some re-applicants the first
round interview that is automatically
granted to new applicants, that is pre
cisely what Row stall is saying.
If the* Row didn't want returning RAs in
the houses, that should have been made
deai before we wasted our time writing
our applications and wasted our REs time
writing our recommendations. I sin
cerely hope that Row Res Ed stall will re
evaluate its RA selection procedure so that
it is fair lor every applicant in the future.

Freshman responds to Ghanem
I am writing to respond to Kareem
(ihanem's April 26 stall column. The ar
ticle alleges that Israel's war on terrorism
is somehow less justified than America's
war and that Israel's practices are not
morally equal to American practices.
First I would like to say that I agree;
America's war and Israel's war are not the
same. America responded to a heinous act

of terrorism, yet it was a single event that
did not directly affect the day-to-day lives
of the vast majority of Americans. Israel
responded to a wave of terrorism that has
been raging for 18 months. In particular it
responded to seven consecutive suicide at
tacks in seven days.
The Israeli population is living in con
stant fear. A country that has to defend it
self when going to the supermarket, a
disco or even a Passover Seder becomes a
risky endeavor for its people, who cannot
leave their homes and be sure that they
will return alive.
Another difference between the two
wars on terror is that America did not
wait over a year to give the Taliban a
chance to renounce terrorism. Israel
waited patiently for Yasser Arafat to act
against those responsible for suicide
bombings, while its civilians were being
targeted in daily attacks.
In addition, once America had clear
evidence that Bin Laden was responsible
for the Sept. 11 attack, it asked for him
"dead or alive." Israel found letters
signed by Arafat allocating funds for sui
cide bombings yet he is kept safe in his
Ramllah headquarters.
I agree on the second point too. Israel's
practices of combating terror and those of
the United States are not morally equiva
lent. The United States was justifiably
careful in using ground forces and endan
gering the lives of its soldiers. It chose to
first conduct bombing missions which kill
terrorists and civilians indiscriminately.
That is not to say that America did not at
tempt to prevent civilian casualties, but
bombing from the safety of the skies in
evitably gives up precision, and we now
know that civilians did die.
Israel could have easily launched mis
siles intoJenin but it decided instead to risk
the lives of soldiers and go on house-to
house searches. The number of civilian ca
sualties in Jenin is relatively low for an
urban operation. Most of those dead were
found to be carrying weapons or died from
booby traps that the Palestinians set to pre
vent Israeli forces from entering houses.
Even Secretary of State Colin Powell
clearly stated that no massacre occurred
and that Israel's mission was to responsibly
rid the area of its terrorist infrastructure.
Since the incursion, there has been no
major suicide bombing or terrorist attack.
(ihanem goes on to state that Israel has
not given the Palestinians a serious peace
proposal. Actually the Camp David pro
posal would have given the Palestinians a
state of their own, where they would con
trol roughly 97 percent of the disputed
territory. More importantly, if Arafat felt
that the proposal was not fair, he was ex
pected to come up with a counteroffer.
I lowever, the realization th;it he would
actually have to compromise to achieve
peace drove Arafat to launch the Intifada.
I mad Faluji, the Palestinain Authority
Communications Minister, admitted that
the violence of the Intifada had been
planned in July, after the Camp David ac -
cords and far in advance of Ariel Sharon's
visit to the temple mount.
Israel did not cease negotiations right
away alter the breakout ol terror but
continued offering Arafat more and
more in the laba talks that followed.
I lowever, Aralat's answer to all propos
als was a wave of suicide bombers that he
unleashed 011 Israel.
I he column continued to criticize
Sharon. It incorrectly states that he was
lound responsible lor the Salmi and Shati
la massacre. Actually the massacre was con
ducted by a Christian Lebanese militia.
Sharon was lound indirectly responsible
lor not anticipating the massacre.
I he column's use ol misleading lan
guage does not help to clarify or solve the
current situation. President Bush stated
unequivocally — after the completion of
operation Defense Shield — that Sharon
is .1 man ol peace who acts responsibly
against terror.
The column does correctly identify that
Israel needs to see the Palestinians as peo
ple with legitimate grievances, deserving
dignity and empathy. Most Israelis do.
I lie Palestinian leadership should now
also accept this vievy. It should not send
young children 011 suicide bombing mis
sions, and it should clearly denounce all
terrorism. Negotiation and not suicide
bombings will bring peace.
Golda Meir, Israel's first female prime
minister, explained the problem and so
lution most clearly when she said "Peace
will come when the Palestinians learn to
love their children more than they hate
the Israelis."

Coalition for Justice in Israel-Palestine
responds to allegations of anti-Semitism
As a co-organizer of Laurie King-
I rani's April 23 talk 011 the war crimes case
against Ariel Sharon, 1 take exception with
Daniel Silverberg's letter of April 24. The
case concerns Sharon's role in the 1982
massacre of over 1,000 Palestinian civil
ians at Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in
Beirut, while the camps were under Israeli
army control and Sharon was Israeli De

fense Minister.
An Israeli commission of inquiry found
Sharon "personally responsible" tor the
massacre, but he lias never faced criminal
sanctions. Silverberg portrays the
Sharon case as an illegitimate exploita
tion of international law for political
ends. In fact, Sharon's prosecution
would be no more and 110 less political
than the trials of Adolf Lichmann and
Slobodan Milosevic, the indictment of
Augusto Pinochet, 01 the Nuremberg,
Yugoslavia or Rwanda tribunals.
Both Human Rights Watch and
Amnesty International have expressed
support for criminal investigation of
Sharon's role in the massacre, notwith
standing his current position as Israeli
prime minister. Far from "grossly under
minfing]" the emerging human rights
regime, as Silverberg puts it, Sharon's in
vestigation would demonstrate that that
regime is reaching its maturity. As King-
Irani emphasized, the case is not directed
only at Sharon hut at all Israeli and
Lebanese perpetrators of the massacre.
Silverberg also labels the Sharon case
as one-sided because it does not take into
account Palestinian human rights abus
es. While both sides have committed
abuses, that does not mean there is any
equivalence between the Israeli and
Palestinian sides. It cannot seriously be
argued that abuses by the apartheid-era
South African government were equiva
lent to abuses by the African National
Congress, or that abuses by Serbian
forces in Kosovo were equivalent to
abuses by the Kosovo Liberation Army.
To assert such an equivalence in the Is
raeli-Palestinian context is to turn a blind
eye to the power asymmetry between the
two sides, the aggregate harms involved
(Israeli abuses far outweigh Palestinian
ones), and the record of Israeli ethnic
cleansing, military occupation, colonial
settlement, apartheid-like discrimina
tion, acquisition of land by force, and de
fiance of international law.
As for Silverberg's argument that
greater war criminals than Sharon remain
at large, that may be true but it does not
minimize Sharon's culpability.
Then there's Silverberg's knee-jerk at
tempt to slander as anti-Semitic anyone
who supports holding Sharon account
able "during this delicate time." By this
logic, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty

International, two pillars of the interna
tional human rights movement, are anti-
Semitic:. The ellbrt to bring Sharon to jus
tice has nothing to do with anti-Semitism,
ll has every tiling to do with a long history
of brutal Israeli state practices and the ex
cesses of alleged mass murderers whose
crimes go unpunished because they hap
pen to belong to U.S. client states.
Silverberg may not be able to differ
entiate between the religion or ethnicity
of the perpetrator and the crimes they're
accused of committing, but the rest of us
can. Slinging epithets is no way to con
duct a debate—it's just a facile technique
to stifle opposing viewpoints and avoid
confronting the issues.
I note that Silverberg equates attend
ing the King-Irani event with
"protesting] against Israel." This is a
clever move to disguise the fact that Sil
verberg was not present at the talk he so
freely criticizes. I'm all fora vigorous de
bate on the Sharon case and other as
pects of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,
but let's at least try to take ourselves
halfway seriously.

Hilton urges creation of Geography IDP
The present University administration
is the best Stanford has ever had. There is
not a nut among them. Indeed they are all
eminently sensible people.
University President John Hennessy
gave another important address at the an
nual meeting of the Academic Council. He
said that Stanford is poised to become a
leader in interdisciplinary scholarship. He
added that the University has always en
couraged collaboration across depart
mental and school lines.
Unfortunately this is not true, as I
know from having been appointed to the
Stanford faculty in 1941. Stanford has
one of the worst records in this respect.
The old European system in which I
grew up stressed broad studies with no
mention of that American concept of de
partments. Germany was the exception,
with its stress on narrow research. Johns
Hopkins introduced the system into the
U.S., and old universities like Harvard,
Yale and Princeton slowly and very re
luctantly followed suit.

Stanford was founded at the acme of
the prestige of German universities, and
even its architecture reveals its creation as
a group of discrete departments. When I
founded the Latin American Studies pro
gram in the early 40s, there was strong op
position from some departments, and the
success of the program — which became
the best known in the United States —
only made things worse. I ended up re
signing the directorship. The present
Latin American Studies program is only a
shadow of what it was then, but the ha
rassment to which is has been subjected
shows that the problem is still there.
There was a major problem with the
Economics Department. The economists
claimed to have things under control;
their job now was to "fine-tune the econo
my." Economics was a universal science
based on mathematics, and regional dif
ferences did not matter.
How things have changed! Golombia
University is bragging about its new Earth
Institute, headed by economist Jeffrey
Sachs, who has been lured from Harvard.
He is certainly not an abstruse theorist, but
a hands-on man who, for example, went to
Bolivia to study its inflation problem first
hand. I wonder if he will not go to Ar
gentina to fine-tune its economy. His insti
tute takes in all fields which can make a
contribution to the problems studied. Sci
entists have long realized that interdepart
mental team work is necessary, and now
Hennessy proposes to encourage that ap
proach throughout the University. He de
serves our total support.
I commend the administration for pro
moting interdisciplinary studies. Let's see
now if it means business. A basic change is
necessary, and a specific one will be a test
case. The basic change: the administration
of such programs must be put on a par with
departmental administration.
fhe University has never interfered in
departmental programs. It has split up
programs into departments, as it cJid with
anthropology and geography — which
were originally in Humanities Special Pro
grams — thus creating new departments.
It has divided departments in two, as it has
done with anthopology, and it has abol
ished them, as it later did with geography.
But it has not interfered with their ac
tual programs. On the other hand, inter
disciplinary programs have been held on a
short leash, with a maximum eight year re

newall. They must constantly justify their
existence, including most notably human
biology, which enjoys general respect.
The old American Studies pro
gram had two identical options, either
within modern European languages, or as
an interdepartmental program. The Uni
versity would never have dreamed of in
terfering with the departmental program,
but the interdepartmental one, which al
most all students chose, was the subject of
constant harassment. I spent an inhuman
amount of time writing reports for differ
ent committees, until I finally decided that
life was too short. The rest is history.
The specific case is geography. When 1
came to the United States in 1937, its uni
versities were famous for their outstand
ing geography departments. There were
two noteworthy exceptions: Harvard and
Stanford, which had taken it as a model.
Then Harvard Prof. James Conant, a
chemist, tried to justify Harvard's lack of
one by famously saying "Geography is not
a university subject." The presidents of
private universities, like Cardinals heed
ing the Pope, spread the new doctrine.
This happened just as the United States
was becoming a world power, making ge
ography more important than ever.
Stanford had created a Geography De
partment because the United States gov
ernment said it would not grant Stanford
funds for area studies unless it had one.
Conant's statement came conveniently as
the grant was running out, so the depart
ment was abolished. Those interested in
world affairs should have protested, but
the various departments did not care.
State universities generally kept their
geography departments; those ol UC-
Berkeley and UCLA are outstanding.
The University of Chicago, a private uni
versity, had abolished its geography de
partment, but revived it as an inter-de
partmental program, creating a model
for Stanford.
The United States is now involved more
than ever in the complicated geography of
the world. Let us see if Stanford performs a
national duty by restoring geography as a
respected interdisciplinary program.
The parts are there. They could be put
together easily if there were the will to do
so. We shall see.
