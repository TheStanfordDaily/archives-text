Brewer reflects on ASSU election
Monica Henestroza and Nick Ro
driguez are great leaders and will serve
the entire student body with diligence and
integrity. As outgoing president, I was in
volved in the ASSU elections period, with
eyes and ears behind doors to observe be
havior of candidates, their supporters and
their antagonists.
The elections were successful in pro
ducing two qualified candidates who will
greatly connect with students and use past
experience to further the Association. In
the case of the elections themselves, 1
judge overall success by the means rather
than the end results. The Elections (loin
mission did a stellar job performing its
functions and working with students and
the administration to create a positive ex
perience for all involved in the process.
However, I was disappointed to find
that, in some instances, students treaded
and even crossed the fine line that lies
between expressing opinion and dehu
manizing peers.
The students who vie for ASSU execu
tive offices are attempting to serve the stu
dent body to the extent that they will com
promise academics, sacrifice friendships,
and set aside personal interests in pursuit
of the common welfare of the association.
For this reason, the mere candidacy of
any slate, two people who are willing to
make such sacrifice, is admirable. Further
more, most candidates who run are in po
sition to do so only by committing them
selves to student causes both through the
ASSU and other sectors of campus life.
Such commitment ultimately
strengthens the conditions of Stanford
students. Thus, we are inherently un
grateful when we transcend the expres
sion of our opinion to personal attacks
that undermine their commitment and
willingness to sacrifice, ultimately for the
benefit of the student body.
Exchange of perspective, debate about
issues, and comparisons of candidates are
all vital to campus democ racy. However,
those who exert energy only to disrespect
fully complicate the lives of candidates
might better spend their own energy im
proving conditions of the student body.
The first ASSU elections were lie-Id in
1891. Since then, the association has
evolved from an organization that made
lowly decisions "like how many stripes
would be on the cheerleaders' uniforms"
to a more resourceful association that allo
cates over $1 million to student groups,
maintains service projects, upholds stu
dent voice, enriches conditions and oilers
many forms of representation and service
for the entire student body.
The ASSU is financially autonomous
from the University and remains stable by
the revenue of our business branch Stan
lord Student Enterprises and a multi-mil
lion dollar endowment.
I lie leadership of this office has the
potential to affect the daily conditions of
many student aspects. Though such
awareness is more the exception than
norm, the degradation of potential
ASSU officers cannot be- justified by a
lack of understanding about the sense ol
duty embodied in the job. I his job is too

serious to reduce its selection to hearsay
or campaign-inflicted election handi
caps. While campaigning can, and
should be, a fun experience for all, one
student's fun should should not be at the
expense of another's fundamental enti
tlements, such as dignity and respect.
As Stanford students, and moreover as
human beings, we must act with respect
for others and align our thoughts and be
havior with consideration for our neigh
bors so that we might ultimately improve
the means by which are beloved student
leaders acquire student body leadership.

ASSU President

A rejected applicant speaks out
I just wiint equality in the Row Resi
dent Assistant application process. Cur
rently, new applicants — people who
have never been an RA anywhere — are
treated differently than re-applicants —
a current or former RA who is applying
to RA again for the next year.
Every Row RA applicant should be
able to sign up lor a first-round interview
or every Row RA applicant should have
his or her application read and screened
before receiving a first-round interview.
Doesn't that seem more logical than the
current system of having one standard
for new applicants and one standard for
re-applicants when determining who
gets a first-round interview? Especially
when the new applicant standard is "can
you use a pen to sign up on a piece of
paper" and the re-applicant standard is
"does your application and RF recom
mendation make us believe that you will
lit the 'vision of the Row'"?
While I totally agree with Asst. Direc
tor of Residential Education |osh
Schiller that being a Row RA and a dorm
RA pose vastly different challenges, that
doesn't make new RA applicants any
more qualified than re-applicants. By
denying some re-applicants the first
round interview that is automatically
granted to new applicants, that is pre
cisely what Row stall is saying.
If the* Row didn't want returning RAs in
the houses, that should have been made
deai before we wasted our time writing
our applications and wasted our REs time
writing our recommendations. I sin
cerely hope that Row Res Ed stall will re
evaluate its RA selection procedure so that
it is fair lor every applicant in the future.

Freshman responds to Ghanem
I am writing to respond to Kareem
(ihanem's April 26 stall column. The ar
ticle alleges that Israel's war on terrorism
is somehow less justified than America's
war and that Israel's practices are not
morally equal to American practices.
First I would like to say that I agree;
America's war and Israel's war are not the
same. America responded to a heinous act

of terrorism, yet it was a single event that
did not directly affect the day-to-day lives
of the vast majority of Americans. Israel
responded to a wave of terrorism that has
been raging for 18 months. In particular it
responded to seven consecutive suicide at
tacks in seven days.
The Israeli population is living in con
stant fear. A country that has to defend it
self when going to the supermarket, a
disco or even a Passover Seder becomes a
risky endeavor for its people, who cannot
leave their homes and be sure that they
will return alive.
Another difference between the two
wars on terror is that America did not
wait over a year to give the Taliban a
chance to renounce terrorism. Israel
waited patiently for Yasser Arafat to act
against those responsible for suicide
bombings, while its civilians were being
targeted in daily attacks.
In addition, once America had clear
evidence that Bin Laden was responsible
for the Sept. 11 attack, it asked for him
"dead or alive." Israel found letters
signed by Arafat allocating funds for sui
cide bombings yet he is kept safe in his
Ramllah headquarters.
I agree on the second point too. Israel's
practices of combating terror and those of
the United States are not morally equiva
lent. The United States was justifiably
careful in using ground forces and endan
gering the lives of its soldiers. It chose to
first conduct bombing missions which kill
terrorists and civilians indiscriminately.
That is not to say that America did not at
tempt to prevent civilian casualties, but
bombing from the safety of the skies in
evitably gives up precision, and we now
know that civilians did die.
Israel could have easily launched mis
siles intoJenin but it decided instead to risk
the lives of soldiers and go on house-to
house searches. The number of civilian ca
sualties in Jenin is relatively low for an
urban operation. Most of those dead were
found to be carrying weapons or died from
booby traps that the Palestinians set to pre
vent Israeli forces from entering houses.
Even Secretary of State Colin Powell
clearly stated that no massacre occurred
and that Israel's mission was to responsibly
rid the area of its terrorist infrastructure.
Since the incursion, there has been no
major suicide bombing or terrorist attack.
(ihanem goes on to state that Israel has
not given the Palestinians a serious peace
proposal. Actually the Camp David pro
posal would have given the Palestinians a
state of their own, where they would con
trol roughly 97 percent of the disputed
territory. More importantly, if Arafat felt
that the proposal was not fair, he was ex
pected to come up with a counteroffer.
I lowever, the realization th;it he would
actually have to compromise to achieve
peace drove Arafat to launch the Intifada.
I mad Faluji, the Palestinain Authority
Communications Minister, admitted that
the violence of the Intifada had been
planned in July, after the Camp David ac -
cords and far in advance of Ariel Sharon's
visit to the temple mount.
Israel did not cease negotiations right
