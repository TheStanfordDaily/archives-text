## Tennis learns lessons 
### JERRY LU STAFF WRITER 
Last weekend at the Pacific - 10 Confer
ence Individual Championships, the Stan
ford's men's tennis team laced the toughest
competition of the season, and emerged
tired and humbled, yet ultimately wiser.
I'he team traveled to the Pac-10 Individ
uals, held at Ojai, Calif., from Friday to
Monday. When the dust from the (>4-play
er field cleared at the end of the weekend,
no Cardinal player was left standing.
The players learned that the Cardinal
lineup is relatively vulnerable without se
nior standout K.J. Hippensteel, currently
ranked No. 2 in the nation. He has been out
of action since April 1 ,'i because of a strained
back muscle. More importantly, however,
the players realized that even with the in
juries that have plagued the Stanford squad
all year, they are still able to do some (lam
age out on the courts.
"Scores are one thing, but it's really

about how hard the guys work when the
play. If they keep up their work, soon the
scores will go the Other way," said head
coach Dick Gould.
In the best showing for the Cardinal this
weekend, the second-ranked doubles team
of juniors Scott Lipsky and David Martin
battled through several tough matches to
reach the finals, only to fall to top-ranked
Martin Matkowski and |ulien Rojer of
UCLA, 9-7.
"We had a pretty solid showing," Martin
said. "We were right there in a lot of our
matches. It was just a matter of getting over
the hump."
To reach the finals, the two juniors first

slugged through Oregon's Jason
Menke and Martin Powlowski, 9-7,
in the first round and then downed
Arizona's Stephen Capriati and Carl
Hagman, 8-4, in the quarterfinals.
In their third match in two days,
the pair had to face No. 55 Tobias
Clemens and Lassi Ketolaof UCLA.
In a clash of willpower and en
durance, the Cardinal duo outlast
ed the Bruins' pair, 9-8.
The stage was now set for the
clash between No. 2 Lipsky and
Martin, last year's Pac-10 doubles
champions, and Matkowski and
Rojer, the nationally-ranked No. 1
team. For all those watching, the
match did not disappoint. The Car
dinal pair battled back from a cou
ple of early breaks to serve down 8-
7, but could not send the match to a
tiebreak.
The two teams have had a sto
ried match history this year, with
Lipsky and Martin now 2-2 on the
year against the Bruin tandem.
The Stanford duo lost 8-5 in the
final of the ITA Ail-American
Championships in October, only
to bounce back with victories in the
final of the National Collegiate
Tennis Classic in January, as well
as the recent dual-match win on
April 19.
"On any given day, either team is
able to win," Gould said. "Dave and

Scott had a chance to pull it out, but
lost a couple of serves."
The potential is still there for the
two doubles teams to lace one an
other in the NCAA Championships
in two weeks.
"I'm definitely seeing it as a
missed opportunity," Martin said.
"We could have been Pac-10
champs. I'm going to use that as
added motivation."
Sum ford fared less well in singles
play. Although three of the four
Cardinal players entered into the
Championship draw reached the
second round, only No. 52 Ryan
Haviland was still in competition
after the first day.
Haviland easily dominated un
ranked first-round opponent Oded
TeigofOregon, 6-1,6-3, then posted
an impressive upset of No. 35 Steven
Capriati of Arizona, 6-2,7-5. Moving
on to the quarterfinals, Haviland
played well but was finally overcome
on Friday by No. 21 Matkowski of
UCLA, 6-1,7-5.
Freshman Sam Warburg was
the first to fall on Thursday. De
spite playing a valiant match and
taking the first set from No. 10 To
bias Clemens of UCLA, Warburg
was eventually worn down, 1-6, 6-
4, 6-0. After the match, Warburg
was taken for treatment of a
swollen throat.
"Even though he was really sic k
the entire time, Sam played great
against Clemens," Gould said. "I'm
veiy pleased at the way he played."
No. 29 Martin and No. 73 Lipsky

both advanced to the round of 16 in
singles play on relatively easy wins in
the first round but were both elimi
nated in hard-fought three-set
heartbreakers. Martin was toppled
by No. 37 Alex Vlaski of Washing
ton, while Lipsky succumbed to No.
48 Rodrigo Grilli of UCLA, who
went on to win the singles title.
Stanford's performance in the
invitational bracket was indicative of
the weekend's disappointments.
Despite the presence of two lirst
round byes and one forfeited
match, the three players entered
were not able to progress beyond
the second round.
Sophomore Joe Kao was the first
to be eliminated, falling to Alberto
Francis of UCLA, 6-4, 6-2.
Freshman Phil Sheng advanced
to the second round oil a bye, but
was subsequently overwhelmed by
Arizona's Arnaud Agniel, 6-4, 6-2.
Senior walk-on Chris Meyer moved
to the second round by a no-show
default, but was then downed by
Washington's Dillon Ruby.
Kao and Meyer, the lone Stan
ford doubles entrants into the muta
tional round, were crushed, 8-1, by
Tom Lloyd and Colin O'Grady of
Arizona in the second round after
receiving a first-round bye.
The team is now looking forward
to the NCAA Championship, which
begins on May I 1. The locations of
first and second rounds of competi
tion will be announced on May 2,
with the possibility of Stan lord host
ing regional play.
