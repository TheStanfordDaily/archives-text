## 
### KIMBERLY ROBERTS STAFF WRITER 
When it comes to big matches, the
UCI A women's water polo team seems
to have Stanford figured out. Last year,
the Bruins defeated the Cardinal in the
NCAA championship game, handing
Stanford its first loss of the season.
Talk about a form of deja vu.
This past weekend in the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation Tourna
ment's title game, UCLA did it again.
Stanford entered the tournament with
the top seed, but lost to the Bruins, 11-
7, in the championship game.
Unlike last year, however, Stanford
has the opportunity to avenge this
most recent loss. While UCLA re
ceived the automatic bid to the NCAA
tournament by winning the confer

awarded the at-large bid to the c ham

the first round. They look at the entire
season when they give out the at-large
bid and in that respect, we've beaten
UCLA more."
UCLA will therefore be Stanford's

big hurdle again. This past weekend,
the Bruins were able to put away the
Cardinal by four goals at McDonald's
Swim Stadium on the campus of South
ern California.
Just as it had done throughout the
entire season, the Cardinal jumped
ahead ol the Bruins in the first quarter
by opening up a two-goal lead. 1 lowev
er, the Bruins responded with three
goals of their own in the second quar
ter. Stanford responded with an equal
izing goal to send the game into half
time tied at three.
Coming out of the half, the Bruins
were hot, scoring four goals in both the
third and fourth quarters. Stanford put
up a fight, scoring two goals in each of
the quarters, but came up short.
The Stanford scoring was done pri
