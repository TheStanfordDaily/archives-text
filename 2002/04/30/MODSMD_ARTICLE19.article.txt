# Water polo falls in MPSF title game
## 
### KIMBERLY ROBERTS STAFF WRITER 
When it comes to big matches, the
UCI A women's water polo team seems
to have Stanford figured out. Last year,
the Bruins defeated the Cardinal in the
NCAA championship game, handing
Stanford its first loss of the season.
Talk about a form of deja vu.
This past weekend in the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation Tourna
ment's title game, UCLA did it again.
Stanford entered the tournament with
the top seed, but lost to the Bruins, 11-
7, in the championship game.
Unlike last year, however, Stanford
has the opportunity to avenge this
most recent loss. While UCLA re
ceived the automatic bid to the NCAA
tournament by winning the confer
ence tournament, Stanford was
awarded the at-large bid to the c ham
pionships based on its overall record
this season yesterday. Should the

tournament proceed according to the
seeding, Stanford will face UCLA in
the finals.
"We received the at-large bid be
cause we have the best overall record,"
said senior Kate Pel tit. "We also re
ceived the No. 1 seed in the tourna
ment which means (hat we play Michi
gan instead of Loyola Marymount in
the first round. They look at the entire
season when they give out the at-large
bid and in that respect, we've beaten
UCLA more."
UCLA will therefore be Stanford's

big hurdle again. This past weekend,
the Bruins were able to put away the
Cardinal by four goals at McDonald's
Swim Stadium on the campus of South
ern California.
Just as it had done throughout the
entire season, the Cardinal jumped
ahead ol the Bruins in the first quarter
by opening up a two-goal lead. 1 lowev
er, the Bruins responded with three
goals of their own in the second quar
ter. Stanford responded with an equal
izing goal to send the game into half
time tied at three.
Coming out of the half, the Bruins
were hot, scoring four goals in both the
third and fourth quarters. Stanford put
up a fight, scoring two goals in each of
the quarters, but came up short.
The Stanford scoring was done pri
marily by seniors Margie Dingeldein
and two-meter defender Ellen Estes
and sophomore Jeanine Jackson, who
each scored two goals apiece.
"It was a disrupted game
and we didn't have the right
mindset going into it," Petit
said. "We didn't put every
thing out there or push each
other the way that we should
have. After we fell behind we
weren't mentally tough and
couldn't regain our compo
sure. We were just a couple of
steps behind all game long."
En route to the champi
onship game against the Bruins,
Stanford defeated Hawaii, 14-4,
before beating Long Beach
State, 10-4, in the semifinals.
Just as it did against UCIA,
Stanford jumped out to an
early lead over Long Beach
State, taking a 4-1 advantage
after only one quarter. Despite

a small surge by the 49ers, the
Cardinal scored four goals in
the final quarter, putting the
game out of reach.
Stanford's goals came from
Dingeldein, Estes and junior
Julie Gardner, with two goals
apiece. Freshman twins driver
Hannah Luber and two-meter
defender kelty Luber each
added one goal.
Against Hawaii, Stanford
scored nine goals in just the first
hall. Dingeldein led the team
with four goals, while sophomore
driver Brenda Villa had three.
The Cardinal is off for two
weeks until it opens the NCAA
Tournament against Michigan
at USC.
"We have more potential
than we showed at the MPSFs
this weekend," Petit said.
"We'll be bringing everything
in two weeks and in the end, if
we win the last game, we'll be
satisfied."
