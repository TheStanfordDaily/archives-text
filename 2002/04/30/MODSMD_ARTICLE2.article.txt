# U.S. policy restricts foreigners

### SARAH LUSTBADER 
The Bush administration's de
cision to restrict access to student
visas as part of the post-Sept. 1 1
war on terrorism has continued to
arouse concerns that Stanford's
international students may dwin
dle and undergo limitations on
what they may study.
According to The New York
Times, Bush issued a directive
on "Combating Terrorism
Through Immigration Policies"
in October that placed further
restrictions on access to student
visas and barred "certain inter
national students from receiving
education and training in sensi
tive areas, including areas of
study with direct application to
the development and use of
weapons of mass destruction."
John Pearson, the director of
The Bechtel International Cen
ter, said that the issue of sensi
tive areas of study is not new,
though it has recently been of
greater importance.
"At the moment we do not

have a good idea of how many stu
dents this could affect," Pearson
said. "It will all depend on how
U.S. consular officials overseas
define 'sensitive subjects.'"
He also commented that this
particular policy is one of many
that will affect not only the avail
ability of American schools to
foreign students, but also stu
dents' desire to study in the
United States.
Among the new policies, Pear
son listed a tracking system, au
tomatic revalidation ot visas in
some countries, the monitoring
of students in "sensitive" disci
plines and increased back
ground checks on students from
certain countries.
According to Vishal Dhandia,
a freshman from India, while an
1-20 certification of enrollment
form from a prestigious school
last year all but ensured a stu
dent visa, this year there are no
such guarantees.
"A lot more Muslims are get
ting rejected for student visas
now, even if they are accepted to

big schools," Dhandia said.
There is, as of yet, no certain
ty as to how these changes will af
fect Stanford.
"What we are uncertain about,
at the moment, is how all these
policies will translate into day-to
day decisions by U.S. government
agencies," Pearson said.
Some of the Sept. 11 hi jackers
entered the country on only
tourist and business visas but
were still able to obtain flight
training here.
For the past two years, 5 per
cent of the incoming freshman
class has been comprised of inter
national students.
" This number is not large, es
pecially compared to most East
Coast schools," said junior Clea
Kaske, who works at Bechtel.
Stanford's admissions policy is
not need-blind for international
students. The undergraduate
admissions Web site includes a
note to prospective international
applicants which states, "We can

admit only a small percentage of the
hundreds of applicants who need finan
cial aid, and the amount of aid needed
will be a factor in the admission deci
sion."
The percentage of foreign students

admitted to Stanford is lower than that
of domestic students, In 1999, there was
an 8 percent difference.
International students comprise a
much greater proportion of graduate stu
dents. Foity-one percent of graduate de
grees in engineering are given to interna
tional students, as compared to 9 percent
of undergraduate engineering degrees.
But some international students
worry that some of those who have been

admitted for next fall, especially under
graduates, will not be able to attend.
Minal Mehta, a junior from India
who works at the center, reported that
students have requested 1-20 forms early
this year, even though visas cannot be
granted until three months before stu
dents leave.
"No one knows what will happen this
year, so they are preparing for some
thing to go wrong," Mehta said.
