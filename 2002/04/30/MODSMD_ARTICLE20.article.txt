## 
### KIRSTEN BOURNE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In Saturday's victory against Bay Area rival Cali
fornia (I(M>, 5-3 Mountain Pacific Lacrosse League),
the Stanford lacrosse team (<S-7, 7-0 MPLL) exhibited
some of its finest play of the season.

WOMEN'S LACROSSE
Saturday: Stanford 10, California 8
Today: Stanford vs. UC-Davis, 7 p.m., New
Moloney Field

The Cardinal went into halftime with an impres
sive lead of 6-0, but shouldn't have been so content
with this lead. By the end of the second half, the Bears
bad worked their way back up to sc ore eight goals on
the Cardinal, and the game ended with an uncom
fortably close score of 10-8. The Stanford team left
Wishing it could have strung together 60 minutes of
strong play, instead of letting (la I have a chance in the
fight for the victory.
Sophomore attacker Jess Scott regretted a lost
chance to come out way ahead of a team that has al
ways given the Cardinal a good game.
"We haven't learned yet how to bury a team," said
Scott. "We- get up, and get complacent, and just sit
there."
Despite a disappointing second half, the Cardinal
performed strongly in t lie first half of the game. Stan
ford was able to maintain possession of the ball for the*
majority of the first half, and this left the team with a
large number of shooting chances. It seems that this was
exactly the position the Cardinal had been hoping for.
"At practice last week we had worked on securing
solid possession of the ball on attack," said Scott. "We
aimed to shoot only when we bad a real opportunity.''

I lead coach Michele Uhlfelder echoed these senti
ments. "Controlling the game is something we've
worked hard on. The 112 irst half was a good display of
this, but the second was not," she said.
Several Stanford players succeeded iu finding
the net when the opportunity presented itself.
Freshman attacker Kelsey Twist, who leads the
team with HI goals and 10 assists on the season,
scored two goals in the first half and one in the sec
ond. Senior co-captain and attacker Li/. Britt also
netted a goal in the first half and one in the second.
Iu addition, sophomore midfielder Abbi Hills and
Scott, along with freshman attacker Nina Pantano,
tallied goals for the Cardinal in the first half.
Although there were lots of shots on goal in the first
half, (lie (Cardinal was less successful in making shots
count in the second. Uhlfelder lamented the low scor
ing percentage of the team.
" File past couple of games we're shooting in the
low 3()'s percent-wise," she said.
Furthermore, when Stanford did miss a shot, the
team didn't read well.
"We didn't transition well oil a saved shot," said
Uhlfelder. "We didn't have an answer lor the shots we
missed, and the ball was repeatedly cleared over our heads."
Also adding to Cal'scxnnparative success in the second
half was its ability to race down the middle of the field.
Stanford's defense, caught off guard, was unsuccessful in
slowing down the quick changes in momentum.
Despite several missed opportunities, freshmen at
tackers Pantano and Claire Calzonetti succeeded in
storing goals for the (latdinal in the second half and
preserving Stanford's lead over the Bears.
Stanford will have one more chance to face a West
Coast rival and put together its strongest full game
when it meets the I C-Davis Aggies tonight at 7 p.m.
at New Maloney Field.
