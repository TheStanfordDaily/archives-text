# Sharon Green and Oak Creek apartments
## Livin' it up, off-campus style 
### BILL BOWEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
While the University housing
crunch may he a headache for adminis
trators, for some Stanford students, it
brings unique opportunities, like the
chance to rent off-campus apartments
in Sharon (ireen and Oak Creek at sub
sidized prices.
At approximately $3,000 a month,
the apartments are financially out of
reach for many Stanford students and
Bay Area residents. But with Univer
sity subsidies, undergraduates who
draw into the apartments pay similar
rents to students on campus. Apart
ments have a rate of $4,610 per year,
while on-campus housing ranges from
$4,803 to $5,384.
For many students who live in the
apartments, the perks are well worth the
prices. They have free access to a hot
tub, sauna, weight room, swimming
pools, tennis courts, pool tables and bar
becue grills shared between apartments.
A continental breakfast is served daily.
" The facilities are also amazing —
our apartment overlooks one of many
pools in tiie complex, there is a full gym,
a hot tub, a movie theater and tennis
courts. It's kind of like living in a coun
try club." said Amanda Kahn, a junior
living in Oak ( '.reek.
I"he apart ments 11 lemselves are laud
ed for the large amount of space avail
able to students.
"[Sharon (Ireen and Oak Creek] pro
vide a much larger living space than do
the dorms," said Resident Assistant
Shivan Tekwani, a senior. "For four
people, you get a lot of space and two
bathrooms, whereas even in Suites
you've got six people sharing one bath
room and very cramped rooms. Our
apartments ;ilso have a kitchen, living

room extending into a small eating area
and a patio or balcony."
According to Kahn, " The biggest ad
vantage by far is space. We have more
room than we can lill — two bathrooms,
a lull kitchen, a huge living area, and
closets galore. I can study, sleep, party,
eat and relax here, and never have to
leel claustrophobic."
Apartment residents cook for them
selves instead of purchasing a meal
plan and are responsible for paying
their own utility bills. Some students
enjoy the independent lifestyle. Ac
cording to Assoc. Director of Residen
tial Education John Judicki, t he biggest
advantage of the apartments is the op
portunity for networking with other
tenants, learning how to budget fi
nances and developing other useful
skills for life after college.
According to students, self-reliance
in the apartments is a must.
"There is 110 [facilities contact | to call
if your light burns out, or a Resident
Computer Coordinator to call when
the DSL [Internet connection] dies or
the computer gets a virus." Kahn said.
"We also had to learn how to scrub an
oven, a toilet and a shower and become
accustomed to regular vacuuming."
While many students see the inde
pendence of the apartment lifestyle as a
plus, for others it contributes to a sense
of isolation from students 011 campus
and even other students in the apart
ments. Unlike dormitories and Row
houses, the apartments contain at most
four students, and are spread out over a
large complex.
" There is also no sense of communi
ty." Kahn said. "There is no common
space to go to find people if you want to
procrastinate, or just hang out without
driving to campus."
RAs at Sharon Green and Oak

Creek have a particularly strong c hal
lenge in trying to construct a residen
tial community.
"Everyone is pretty spread out so get
ting people to spend time with each
other is difficult. Also, many of the resi
dents here are very independent and
like the 'living-on-your-ovvn' atmos
phere, so they tend not to reach out to
other residents," said Sharon Green RA
Jason Biltz, a senior.
Not all students see the lack of a typi
cal resident community as a problem,
however, and many choose to avoid the
typical dorm environment. One senior
said that those who draw into the apart
ments are, "mainly students that are not
interested in making new friends. They
are the type of students that don't like to
participate in group or dorm events. I
ieel my resident community is like me,
| in that] they don't like to be bothered."
Because the apartments are far away,
it can also make it difficult for students
to get to and from campus.
"Being off campus means waking up
earlier, not being able to rush home
quickly if you forgot something [and] no
place to nap in the middle of the day,"
said junior Whitney Metzger. "I also
think it poses problems for people who
want to go to parties on campus, but live
off campus. Thefce types of challenges
make the distance a key concern for stu
dents living in Sharon Green."
The University offers students sev
eral options for dealing with the com
mute. The Marguerite runs twice an
hour from () a.m to 2 a.m. Students
who choose to use the Marguerite or
drive to campus encounter particularly
fierce traffic on Sand Hill Road during
rush hour.
