# Wonder drug prevents sleep
## Consumers discover Provigil, a prescription pill that promotes alertness 
### ALBERT LEUNG 
A new wonder drug may soon be avail
able for those— especially college students
— who believe there just aren't enough
hours in one day.
Provigil, an abbreviation that comes
from the words "promotes vigilance," is
the name ofa drug that keeps the human
body and mind fully awake and attentive
when sleep is normally coveted. The pill,
each of which costs $4, has not yet been
approved for healthy people by the Food
and Drug Administration.
"Provigil isn't considered ;i stimulant pet
se, though it has a wakefulness effect," said
Jed Black, an assistant professor of psychia
try and the director of the Stanford Sleep
Disorders Clinic.
Provigil works its magic by specifically
targeting the region of the brain that keeps
people awake. Unlike coffee and ampheta
mines, Provigil cannot be technically classi
fied as a stimulant because it does not perk

up the entire cent ral nervous system or dra
matically increase levels of dopamine, a
neurotransmitter associated with arousal
and alertness.
While stimulants frequently cause jit
ters, insomnia, addiction and a need for
"rebound sleep" to balance sleep debt,
I'rovigil causes none of these effects and al
lows people to return to their normal sleep
schedules when the pills wear off. The key
advantage of this drug is that users show
no need to compensate for the lost hours
of sleep.
I'or example, a 1995 study in Canada
showed that subjects taking the drug were
able to perform well on cognitive tests taken
after remaining awake and in high spirits
for 60 hours, a lengthy two-and-a-hall days.
In another study, published in 2000,
U.S. Army helicopter pilots stayed awake
for 40 hours while being summoned pe
riodically to perform maneuvers on a
flight simulator. When left untreated,
the pilots became fatigued and made er
rors in the morning hours. Bui with the
drug in their system during a second 40-
hour marathon, their skills and focus
never wavered.
