# Wonder drug prevents sleep
## Consumers discover Provigil, a prescription pill that promotes alertness 
### ALBERT LEUNG 
A new wonder drug may soon be avail
able for those— especially college students
— who believe there just aren't enough
hours in one day.
Provigil, an abbreviation that comes
from the words "promotes vigilance," is
the name ofa drug that keeps the human
body and mind fully awake and attentive
when sleep is normally coveted. The pill,
each of which costs $4, has not yet been
approved for healthy people by the Food
and Drug Administration.
"Provigil isn't considered ;i stimulant pet
se, though it has a wakefulness effect," said
Jed Black, an assistant professor of psychia
try and the director of the Stanford Sleep
Disorders Clinic.
Provigil works its magic by specifically
targeting the region of the brain that keeps
people awake. Unlike coffee and ampheta
mines, Provigil cannot be technically classi
fied as a stimulant because it does not perk

up the entire cent ral nervous system or dra
matically increase levels of dopamine, a
neurotransmitter associated with arousal
and alertness.
While stimulants frequently cause jit
ters, insomnia, addiction and a need for
"rebound sleep" to balance sleep debt,
I'rovigil causes none of these effects and al
lows people to return to their normal sleep
schedules when the pills wear off. The key
advantage of this drug is that users show
no need to compensate for the lost hours
of sleep.
I'or example, a 1995 study in Canada
showed that subjects taking the drug were
able to perform well on cognitive tests taken
after remaining awake and in high spirits
for 60 hours, a lengthy two-and-a-hall days.
In another study, published in 2000,
U.S. Army helicopter pilots stayed awake
for 40 hours while being summoned pe
riodically to perform maneuvers on a
flight simulator. When left untreated,
the pilots became fatigued and made er
rors in the morning hours. Bui with the
drug in their system during a second 40-
hour marathon, their skills and focus
never wavered.
Provigil was first developed in
France during the 19705.
Cephalon, a West Chester,
Penna.-based pharmaceutical
company, currently sells the drug
and hopes to gain FDA approval
to market the drug to anybody
plagued by sleepiness from any
medical condition.
At the moment, the FDA only
approves the drug lor one med
ical condition, narcolepsy. Nar
colepsy is commonly described as
a sudden and uncontrollable urge
to sleep.
Despite the drug's proven abili
ties to keep sleep at bay with virtu
ally no side effects, researchers
warn that the long-term health
consequences of avoiding sleep
are not completely understood.
Until scientists fully understand
the role sleep plays in the human
body, they warn that the drug
must be regarded with prudence.
"I would definitely not try
Provigil, even if 112 had to pull an all
nighter," said freshman Matthew
Marquez. "I have a natural hesita
tion to try any kind of drug, and
after taking | Human Biology Prof.
William] Dement's Sleep and
Dreams class last quarter, 1 have
suspicions against anything that
drastically affects a person's nor
mal sleep cycle.
"1 can see how the drug has
practical value for doctors, law
enforcement agencies and peo
ple with sleep disorders, but 1
just don't see this powerful drug
as a necessity for students," Mar
tinez continued.
Some students react to Provigil
with circumspection rather than
eagerness to try the miracle drug.

"1 feel it is unnatural to es
sentially bypass the natural way
our bodies have evolved to
work, which includes interfer
ing with our circadian rhythm
and sleeping patterns," said
freshman Joy Chen.
Provigil's potential usefulness
in occupations such as medicine,
firefighting, law enforcement and
long-haul trucking confronts doc
tors with ethical dilemmas. Some
people question if doctors should
prescribe Provigil to people whose
jobs can become hazardous to soci
ety when they work graveyard
shifts and become sleepy.
There is also a widespread con
cern for abuse.
"If Provigil can safely keep a
person awake for over two days,
what stops the temptation to take
pills for another two days and then
another?" Marquez asked. "At
some point there will be serious
consequences because this drug
forces the human body into unnat
ural behavior."
Moreover, another concern is
that the drug can find its way into
demanding businesses and start
up companies, especially in Sili
con Valley.
"Perhaps there will be a big
push for the legalization of Provig
il from businesses wishing to ex
ploit workers' labor hours," said
sophomore Ouny Chatterjee. Em
ployers may see their companies at
a competitive disadvantage if em
ployees do not lengthen their
work hours with Provigil.
Currently, many doctors dis
creetly prescribe Provigil "off
label," which is for conditions not
approved by the FDA. This prac
tice is common and legal in medi
cine. Conditions for which doctors
prescribe Provigil include depres
sion, sleep apnea, Parkinson's dis
ease and multiple sclerosis.

advantage of this drug is that users show
no need to compensate for the lost hours
of sleep.
I'or example, a 1995 study in Canada
showed that subjects taking the drug were
able to perform well on cognitive tests taken
after remaining awake and in high spirits
for 60 hours, a lengthy two-and-a-hall days.
In another study, published in 2000,
U.S. Army helicopter pilots stayed awake
for 40 hours while being summoned pe
riodically to perform maneuvers on a
flight simulator. When left untreated,
the pilots became fatigued and made er
rors in the morning hours. Bui with the
drug in their system during a second 40-
hour marathon, their skills and focus
never wavered.
Provigil was first developed in
France during the 19705.
Cephalon, a West Chester,
Penna.-based pharmaceutical
company, currently sells the drug
and hopes to gain FDA approval
to market the drug to anybody
plagued by sleepiness from any
medical condition.
At the moment, the FDA only
approves the drug lor one med
ical condition, narcolepsy. Nar
colepsy is commonly described as
a sudden and uncontrollable urge
to sleep.
Despite the drug's proven abili
ties to keep sleep at bay with virtu
ally no side effects, researchers
warn that the long-term health
consequences of avoiding sleep
are not completely understood.
Until scientists fully understand
the role sleep plays in the human
body, they warn that the drug
must be regarded with prudence.
"I would definitely not try
Provigil, even if 112 had to pull an all
nighter," said freshman Matthew
Marquez. "I have a natural hesita
tion to try any kind of drug, and
after taking | Human Biology Prof.
William] Dement's Sleep and
Dreams class last quarter, 1 have
suspicions against anything that
drastically affects a person's nor
mal sleep cycle.
"1 can see how the drug has
practical value for doctors, law
enforcement agencies and peo
ple with sleep disorders, but 1
just don't see this powerful drug
as a necessity for students," Mar
tinez continued.
Some students react to Provigil
with circumspection rather than
eagerness to try the miracle drug.

"1 feel it is unnatural to es
sentially bypass the natural way
our bodies have evolved to
work, which includes interfer
ing with our circadian rhythm
and sleeping patterns," said
freshman Joy Chen.
Provigil's potential usefulness
in occupations such as medicine,
firefighting, law enforcement and
long-haul trucking confronts doc
tors with ethical dilemmas. Some
people question if doctors should
prescribe Provigil to people whose
jobs can become hazardous to soci
ety when they work graveyard
shifts and become sleepy.
There is also a widespread con
cern for abuse.
"If Provigil can safely keep a
person awake for over two days,
what stops the temptation to take
pills for another two days and then
another?" Marquez asked. "At
some point there will be serious
consequences because this drug
forces the human body into unnat
ural behavior."
Moreover, another concern is
that the drug can find its way into
demanding businesses and start
up companies, especially in Sili
con Valley.
"Perhaps there will be a big
push for the legalization of Provig
il from businesses wishing to ex
ploit workers' labor hours," said
sophomore Ouny Chatterjee. Em
ployers may see their companies at
a competitive disadvantage if em
ployees do not lengthen their
work hours with Provigil.
Currently, many doctors dis
creetly prescribe Provigil "off
label," which is for conditions not
approved by the FDA. This prac
tice is common and legal in medi
cine. Conditions for which doctors
prescribe Provigil include depres
sion, sleep apnea, Parkinson's dis
ease and multiple sclerosis.
