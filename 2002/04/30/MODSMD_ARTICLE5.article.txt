# Career Network's new Web site serves students and alums
## 
### SARAH SCHULMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When freshman Krica Simmons stall
ed looking lor a summer internship, she
realized she needed more information
about the type of jobs available and what
the job-search entails. I lie Stanford Ca
reer Network's newly revamped Web site
aims to link students with alumni who
might provide the information to find the
right job.
"I really had no clue what 1 was

doing," Simmons said. "It seemed like
the time to start preparing fora summer
internship, but I didn't know where to
search for one."
The Stanford Career Network, an on
line database of alumni volunteers who
provide informational interviews to stu
dents and other alumni, will re-launch
with a new look by the end of the week.
I lie revised Web site is designed to make
it easier for students and alumni to con
nect and share advice.
" I'lie site is a great resource for Stan

ford students and alums because when
they are in a job-search mode they can
talk to people with a lot of experience,"
s.iid Cindy Brinkmann, the manager of
the Stanford Career Network. " The Web
site facilitates networking and that is real
ly how most people find jobs."
Currently, students can search by ca
reer, company, state, job function, city or
country to locate alumni and jobs. The
renovated Web site will allow users to look
for information by major, degree, class
year and even by metropolitan area.

"From the search side of the Web site,
it will be simpler to find people,"
Brinkmann said. "By upgrading it, we
hope to increase the navigation possibili
ties and find even better mate lies between
students and alums."
In addition to improving the content
of the Web site, program administrators
are recreating the site's interface and sim
plifying the process by which alumni vol
unteers update their information. With
over iS,(H)() alumni volunteers, Brinck
inann anticipates the new sile will attract

even more.
"The site will certainly look nicer and
be more t in rent," Brinkmann said. It will
he much easier to fill out data forms.
Right now it is a bit tedious.
"VVe will be able to send out yearly re
minders to alumni to update their infor
mation," Brinkmann continued. "We will
also send them little surveys to comment
on everything."
Mary Mac'Nally. a career research spe
cialist with the Stanford Career Develop
ment Center, often refers students to the
Web site. She said she hopes the new
Web site will increase alumni participa
tion in the program.
"The database helps students have in

formational interviews and gives them
information that iliey may not otherwise
get — salary data and the work culture,"
Mac'Nally said. "While the current sys
tem is good, I'd definitely like to see it ex
panded and involve more alumni."
With the strained job market, more
students are making use of the Stanford
Career Network. But program adminis
trators do not have much information
about site utilization patterns. The new

Web site plans to change that.
"One of the most exciting upgrades is
our ability to capture a lot of data and
compile statistics," Brinkmann said. "We
will track what students are logging on.
what pages are used most and how many
alumni volunteers are signing on each
month. The data will help us determine
what we should focus on next."
I'he upgraded Web site is funded by
the Stanford Alumni Association.
