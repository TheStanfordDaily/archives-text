Doctor creates new kind of
cigarettes that taste like
earwax
BECKLEY, W.Va. (AP) —Berkley doctor Hassan
Anijad has a special remedy tor smokers wanting to kick
the habit — make cigarettes taste terrible.
Smoke-less, an herbal concoction Anijad created,
won't stop cravings, but it makes cigarettes taste like
earwax for about three hours. Smokers place a pinch
of the green powdery mixture on their tongues to get
the effect.
"It's a different point of view to treating addiction,"
said Anijad, who lias an herbal clinic near his family
practice office. "We're trying to reprogram the mind
that the cigarette might look the same, but it now tastes
bad."
Anijad declined to say what herbs are used in Smoke
less, because herbs can't be patented.
I lc said the herbs in Smoke-less have been used safely
in India and the United States for hundreds of years. But
Ani jad discouraged diabetic s from using the herbs.

Mountain lion sightings
increase in rural areas
during warmer weather
YREKA, Calif. (AP) — The weather is getting better,
and mdlre people are enjoying the great outdoors. That
means more mountain lion sightings in rural Siskiyou
County.
The state Department of Eish and Game said a lion re
cently killed a llama near I lappy Camp, according to Lt.
Rudy Aruda. The animal was tracked by a trapper's dogs
and killed, he said.
Eish and (iame officers are continuing to look fora lion
seen near an elementary school in I lappy Camp. Aruda
said officers also have been told of mountain lion sight
ings east ofYreka, and near Schulmeyer Gulch, the Pines
and Greenhorn Park.
However,just because a bigcat is sighted doesn't mean
it will be hunted down.
" These cats are not doing anything, and just seeing a
mountain lion is not enough for the Eish and Game to
act," he said. "Under the law, a mountain lion has to be
making some overt act or doing something that leads us
to believe it is a possible threat to humans or their pets
and livestock."

San Jose City Council
considers home landscape
ordinance
SAN JOSE (AP) — The City Council will consider an
ordinance today requiring home owners to landscape
their yards. If it passes, it would be the first such ordi
nance in the state, officials say.
The proposal would require front yards to be covered
with living plants or decorative materials such as rocks,
bark or gravel.
A recent survey of communities with neighborhood
organizations, which accounts about third of the city,
found that more than 6,700 properties would not meet
the landscaping requirements.
City officials and neighborhood groups say they will
work with people who can't afford the landscaping, pos
sibly providing grants for home improvements.
"We're not coming down with a heavy club," said
Councilman Ken Yeager, who is on the city's Education,
Neighborhoods, Youth and Seniors Committee. "We've
come up with something that encourages people toclean
their property."
