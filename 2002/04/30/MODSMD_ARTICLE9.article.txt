1941
On April 30, 1941, The Daily printed an
article about students bouncing checks.
"Palo Alto banks and stores have very little
trouble with Stanford students when it comes
to collecting badc hecks or bills, according to
a Daily survey made yesterday afternoon.
" The three banks in Paly return an aver
age of three checks per day to merchants who
presented them. However, the banks find
t hat the figure doubles in the last week of the
quarter, an indication that most students are
here on a quarterly allowance basis.
"Clothing stores, creameries and ser
vice stations checked said that they had
very few bad checks come in the course of
the year, and that they find little or no
trouble in collecting.
'"Most of the troubles come from an in
ability to add and subtract and to keep a
straight track on the check stubs,' stated the
credit manager of a local store, a statement
that was borne out by the rest of the mer
chant 1 i sers con tacted.
"One store stated that they had not had a
bad check in the past ten years, and at the
same time have very little trouble collecting
bills, while a creamery manager said that they
have had only four or live bad checks so far
this academic year and that they have never
yet failed to collect on these."
Bottom Line: So "creameries" per se don't exist any
more, but may the day when college students stop
writing $1.75 checks fora mint chocolate chip cone
never come.
