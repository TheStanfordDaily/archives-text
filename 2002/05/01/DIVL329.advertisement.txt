4:oopm
Kresge Auditorium
Stanford University
Followed by a book signing by the authors
"On the surface it seems that computing should be an attractive
career for women, but for many it hasn't been. Margolis and Fisher
give us a deep and nuanced insight into this troubling problem. No
simplistic answers are offered, but rather the far richer perspectives
of real human experience."
