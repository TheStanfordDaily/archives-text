BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) â€”Twenty-six
Palestinian civilians and police emerged one by one
yesterday from the Church of the Nativity, the largest
group to leave one of Christianity's holiest shrines
since the month-long standoffbegan between Israel's
army and a group of armed militants inside.
Israel, meanwhile, defied the United Nations and
blocked an inquiry into fighting at thejenin refugee
camp where Palestinians claim Israeli soldiers con
ducted a massacre of civilians in eight-days of house
to-house fighting.
U.N. diplomats said Secretary-General Kofi
Annan was leaning toward disbanding the mission.
Annan said he had done everything possible to meet
Israeli demands to modify the mission.
In t he West Bank town of Jericho, U.S. and British
security experts toured the local prison Tuesday in
another step in a U.S.-backed deal designed to release
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat from months of Is
raeli confinement.
Six Palestinians who are wanted by Israel and are
holed up in Arafat's besieged headquarters in the
West Bank town of Ramallah would be moved to the
Jericho prison under U.S. and British supervision,
paving the way for Arafat to leave his compound.
Palestinian officials said the prisoner transfer could
take place within 24 hours, but Israel said there was
no agreed upon timetable.
U.S. and British security experts met with Pales
tinian officials in Ramallah late yesterday to finalize
the technical details of the prisoner transfer.
Yarden Vatikay, an adviser to Defense Minister
Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, said Israel would not with-

draw tanks from Arafat's compound until he received
word from U.S. officials that the prisoners were in
Jericho.
Late yesterday, a 2-year-old girl was killed when
Israeli tanks opened lire near the Gaza-Egypt bor
der, witnesses and a Palestinian doctor said. Israeli
military sources said militants set off an explosive
and soldiers fired a tank shell, hitting one of the
bombers.
Also yesterday, Israeli tanks completed their pull
out of the West Bank town of Hebron, the military
said, after a two-day incursion launched in response
to a deadly shooting attack on a nearby Jewish settle
ment. The military said 150 Palestinians were arrest
ed, including 52 wanted men. Nine Palestinians were
killed during the raid, including six civilians.
The Israeli military later released 24 Palestinians at
Beitjalla hospital, next to Bethlehem, witnesses said.
A senior Palestinian officer was released earlier, they
said. An army statement said one Palestinian was
taken to an Israeli hospital for treatment.
A Palestinian in the compound, speaking on con
dition of anonymity, said the men decided to leave be
cause conditions were increasingly difficult, with food
running low. All Palestinians emerging so far from
the compound have denied that they had been held
hostage by the militants.
Palestinians and clergy holed up in the church give
different reasons for why they will not leave. The gun
men lied to the holy site to escape invading Israeli
troops. The Palestinian policemen and civilians say
they want to show solidarity for the Palestinian cause
and don't want to be seen as surrendering to Israel.
