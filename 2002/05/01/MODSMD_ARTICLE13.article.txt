## Wolff, Pleins, Sheehan, Pang share 'Visions of Church' 
### ANNE BECKER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Four members of Stanford's
Catholic community engaged
and challenged an audience with
their opinions of the Church's
current and future state in a
panel discussion entitled "Visions
of Church" Monday night in the
Geology Corner.
Senior Erika Moseson con
ceived the panel in the fall and said
she did not intend for it to be sole
ly a response to the sexual abuse
scandal currently surrounding the
Roman Catholic Church.
"I began to question my own vi
sion of the Church and saw in
equities and fundamentally wrong
things," she said. "1 realized that
most people had different visions
of church and that Stanford has
amazing resources of people who
combine faith and intellect to dis
cuss these visions."
The panel was composed of

English Prof. Tobias Wolff,
Catholic Community Director of
Music and Liturgy Teresa Pleins,
Religious Studies Prof. Thomas
Sheehan and John Pang, a gradu
ate student in religious studies.
They discussed issues ranging
from the need lor more priests in
the Church to the Church's views
on homosexuality and women in
the clergy.
Sheehan, the most radical of the
four speakers, rejected the current
hierarchical model of the Church
and called fora more democratic
model. Sheehan also demanded a
revision of the Church's stance on
homosexuals.
"The Church is perpetuating
an inhuman and immoral policy
[on homosexuality] and it simply
must be rescinded," he said. " The
Church in crisis needs radical re
form Hit is going to stay alive and
make it through the storm.
"This means a radical revi
sion of church governance and a
radical revision of the teaching
of homosexuality as immoral
[by] condemning homosexual
acts as depraved. Lay people
have to be empowered to take
repossession of their own reli

gious communities.
W olff used the image of
Chaucer's pilgrims in"The Can
terbury Tales" to suggest the
Church is in the process of mak
ing a journey.
"The problems besetting our
church rise from imposing the
spirit of crusade on what is actual
ly a pilgrimage and sacrificing tol
erance, openness and justness to
visions of cohesion and power,"
he said. "We have a habit of think
ing of ourselves as a church at the
end of a journey, but we are only
at the beginning."
Pleins provided a local per
spective by citing figures from the
Diocese of San Jose's recent plan,
"Reviewing the Church," on the
decreasing numbers of priests in
an increasing Catholic popula
tion. Pleins suggested laity in
volvement in the church and
women priests as solutions to this
problem.
"1 envision a eucharistic-cen
tered incarnational model at the
service of the most desperate
members of society fostering the
faith of its people and not getting
in the way of God's call to provide
gifted leadership," she said.

Pang presented a more global
vision of the church by describing
the Church in Asia and calling for
a focus on "enculturation" around
the world by allowing churches to
grow based on the cultural setting
in which they are located.
Pang also spoke of the need
fora renewed devotion to social
justice.
The Rev. Patrick Laßelle, the
director of the Cathplic communi
ty at Stanford, said he thought the
discussion was "creative and hope
ful," but was disappointed at the
lack of student attendance, as the
audience was composed mainly of
area residents.
"It's not just Stanford — there
is a national problem of under
grads focusing on their personal
needs and priorities," lie said.
"They haven't plugged into con
cerns beyond themselves."
Student reaction to the pro
gram was mainly positive.
"The panel talked about a lot of
issues that needed to be talked
about," sophomore Todd Lieber
said. "The opportunity to hear
these people speak about their vi
sions of church allows us to inform
our own conscience."
