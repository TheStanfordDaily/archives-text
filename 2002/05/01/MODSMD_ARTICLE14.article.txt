## The Stanford Daily U.S. must moderate restrictions on foreign students
### 
Published Since 1891

In light of the embarrassing breakdowns
in border security that allowed terrorists
to enter the country and obtain flight
training for the Sept. 11 attacks, the need
for increased vigilance is unquestionable.
However, The Daily believes some of the
means currently being pursued by Congress
and the White House may do more harm —
especially to those in college communities such
as Stanford's — than good.
A presidential directive issued by the Bush
administration last October called for tighter
controls on student visas and restrictions on
what courses of study certain international stu
dents could undertake.
With the details of the directive's implemen
tation still being worked out and the future of
the Immigration and Naturalization Service in
doubt, it is unclear exactly what effect the poli
cy will have on Stanford's international stu
dents. However, it is apparent that obtaining

visas will become much more difficult and that
international students' academic records and
personal information will be more consistently
reported to the federal government.
While such bureaucratic red tape will
surely be a hassle for foreign students study
ing in the United States, we believe that a
comprehensive information-keeping system
is an essential component of efforts to pre
vent a repeat of the Sept. 11 tragedy. At least
one of the hijackers is known to have entered
the country on a student visa and never even
set foot on the campus of the college he was
scheduled to attend; but because the INS did
not track his progress, he went untracked
and undetected.
The issue of restrictions on majors and
classes is more ominous. Granted, the U.S.
doesn't want to be training terrorists in
atomic weaponry and demolitions at its uni
versities. Given the monumental impor

tance of atomic expertise, simple back
ground checks into nuclear engineering stu
dents from countries known to be hotbeds of
terrorism may be warranted, as repulsive as
such invasions of privacy may seem.
On the other hand, policies that bar stu
dents' access to entire disciplines solely on the
basis of nationality would cross the fine line be
tween prudence and paranoia. Likewise, reac
tionary proposals such as a student-visa mora
torium or a mandatory four-year stay for stu
dents from specified countries — without li
cense to leave the country during breaks —
stem from politically motivated appeals to irra
tional fear and xenophobia.
The problem with such proposals is that
they would provide only a minimal increase
in real security while incurring substantial
costs to the nation's academic communities
and society at large, lo treat international stu
dents with such suspicion would severely di

minish the educational experience and pro
mote a culture of mistrust that would ad
versely affect everyone.
Especially at world-class universities such as
Stanford, international students make an inte
gral contribution to the diversity and quality of
academic life. The government should re
member that its role is not just to provide its cit
izens with security, but also to uphold the val
ues of freedom and openness that make the
country what it is.
The direct victims of unreasonable immi
gration policies do not have a voice in govern
ment. Consequently, it is up to those who un
derstand the import of a global intellectual
community to speak out against such propos
als. We hope that the federal government
shows restraint in its attempts to tighten bor
der security, and we encourage Stanford stu
dents to advocate for the rights of their foreign
classmates to ensure that it does so.
