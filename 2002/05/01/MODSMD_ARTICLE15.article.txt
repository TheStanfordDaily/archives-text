# RUNNING ON EMPTY
## Free lube in a jiffy 
### 
I am sad. Every week I sit in a room
with a few thousand condoms and
enough personal lubricant to fill a
small aquarium. I stare at the door
with my hands folded on the desk and
wait for you to walk in. And do you? No,
you do not.
What is it about the Sexual Health
Peer Resource Center that scares you
away? Do you not know where we are? In
the basement of Cowell. Are you not sure

when we're open? Mon
day through Saturday,
12:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.
Thirty hours a week a
friendly, trained peer
counselor who loves to
talk about latex is sitting
in a clean, well-lit room
decorated in pleasant
colors hoping that you

will drop in fora chat and a bag of free
goodies. Without you there's not much
to do besides stock the condom cabinet
and refill the candy dish. Did I mention
there is candy? There is.
This is not directed at all Stanford stu
dents. Six hundred thirty people visited
the SHPRC last quarter to cash in on their
God-given right to 12 free condoms, or
the equivalent of $2 of other fun sexual
health stuff. To those who have already
discovered the joys of the most booty
friendly place on campus, good for you!
You may put this down and go back to
hooking up.
But for the 14,400 eligible students
who did not visit us, however — what the
heck is going on? Are you afraid we're
going to call your mom and tell her you
just walked out the door with a bagful of
banana-flavored condoms? All our ser
vices are completely confidential — all
you need is your SUII).
Do you not like free stuff? Who doesn't
like free stuff? You know you only go to
the Career Fair for the pens. Free flavored
lube is much more fun and you don't even
have to feign interest in consulting.
One in four Stanford students has a
sexually transmitted disease. This, of
course, does not concern you, assuming
that you have never hooked up with any
one, you don't plan to hook up with any
one, none of your friends have ever
hooked up and you are a nun.
Actually, we also offer free information
on reproductive health issues like men
strual problems and abstinence, as well as
unbleached tampons that you can get for
free with your quarterly credit. Nuns
should probably come in too.
But I don't need condoms, you say. My
girlfriend is on the pill. My partner and I
have both been tested fbrSTDs, and we're
negative. I am a lesbian and need con
doms like a fish needs a bicycle. Why
should I bother?
In addition to the aforementioned fla
vored lube and tampons, you can use
your $2 credit towards an impressive se

lection of non-flavored lube, spermicide,
massage oil, dental dams, female con
doms and polyurethane condoms, in
case latex makes you itchy. You can also
grab all the rubber gloves and informa
tional brochures you can carry for free.
So that you don't have to bike back to
Wilbur with condoms falling out of your
pockets, we have plain brown shopping
bags handy.
What is lube? you ask. Why do I need
it? Dear Lord, I could talk for hours.
Trust me, you do. Come on down to the
center and we'll chat.
But, you say, I am single / Catholic / a
computer science major! I am not having
sex. What is there for me?
If you have made the decision not to be
sexually active right now, rock on. Use
your $2 credit instead to get four samples
of flavored heating massage oil and re
lieve your friends' stress during
midterms. Browse our library and check
out "Let Me Count the Ways," a book of
suggestions on ways to be intimate with
out having sex, or "Sex for One," the
definitive guide to masturbation.
Pick up some free brochures so that
you can educate your friends, your room
mates or anyone else you care about on
how they can protect themselves while
getting play. This might also be a good
time to delicately bring up the live-in sig
nificant other that is starting to get on
your nerves.
When you come down to visit us, you
don't have to just grab your free stuff and
go. Sit on our comfy sofa or flowery chair
and chat.
Are you thinking about switching
your birth-control method and aren't
sure what your options are? Did the con
dom break last night and you're freak
ing out? Is something itchy or bumpy
when you don't think it should be? Talk
to us. We'll give you all the information
we have and if you need extra care we
will point you to all of the amazing sexu
al health resources that are available
right here on campus, many of which
are free.
Bring a friend. Bring your dorm.
Come in with your boyfriend/girlfriend
and do your shopping together. Check
out a copy of the famous Guide to Getting
it On. Your life will never be the same.
And when your free stuff runs out,
come back. We sell condoms cheaper
than anywhere else you'll find — six for
$1 —as well as larger sizes of lube and
massage oil.
So what are you waiting for? Put down
the paper. Get to the SH PRC and then get
your groove on. Just don't be intimidated.
Because you would never go into a
midterm unprepared — doesn't your
body deserve at least as much?

bags handy.
What is lube? you ask. Why do I need
it? Dear Lord, I could talk for hours.
Trust me, you do. Come on down to the
center and we'll chat.
But, you say, I am single / Catholic / a
computer science major! I am not having
sex. What is there for me?
If you have made the decision not to be
sexually active right now, rock on. Use
your $2 credit instead to get four samples
of flavored heating massage oil and re
lieve your friends' stress during
midterms. Browse our library and check

out having sex, or "Sex for One," the
definitive guide to masturbation.
Pick up some free brochures so that
you can educate your friends, your room
mates or anyone else you care about on

time to delicately bring up the live-in sig
nificant other that is starting to get on
your nerves.
When you come down to visit us, you
don't have to just grab your free stuff and
go. Sit on our comfy sofa or flowery chair
and chat.
Are you thinking about switching

ing out? Is something itchy or bumpy
when you don't think it should be? Talk
to us. We'll give you all the information
we have and if you need extra care we
will point you to all of the amazing sexu
al health resources that are available
right here on campus, many of which
are free.

it On. Your life will never be the same.
And when your free stuff runs out,
come back. We sell condoms cheaper
than anywhere else you'll find — six for
$1 —as well as larger sizes of lube and
massage oil.
So what are you waiting for? Put down
the paper. Get to the SH PRC and then get
your groove on. Just don't be intimidated.
Because you would never go into a
midterm unprepared — doesn't your
body deserve at least as much?

I am sad. Every week I sit in a room
with a few thousand condoms and
enough personal lubricant to fill a
small aquarium. I stare at the door
with my hands folded on the desk and
wait for you to walk in. And do you? No,
you do not.
What is it about the Sexual Health
Peer Resource Center that scares you
away? Do you not know where we are? In
the basement of Cowell. Are you not sure

when we're open? Mon
day through Saturday,
12:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.
Thirty hours a week a
friendly, trained peer
counselor who loves to
talk about latex is sitting
in a clean, well-lit room
decorated in pleasant
colors hoping that you

will drop in fora chat and a bag of free
goodies. Without you there's not much
to do besides stock the condom cabinet
and refill the candy dish. Did I mention
there is candy? There is.
This is not directed at all Stanford stu
dents. Six hundred thirty people visited
the SHPRC last quarter to cash in on their
God-given right to 12 free condoms, or
the equivalent of $2 of other fun sexual
health stuff. To those who have already
discovered the joys of the most booty
friendly place on campus, good for you!
You may put this down and go back to
hooking up.
But for the 14,400 eligible students
who did not visit us, however — what the
heck is going on? Are you afraid we're
going to call your mom and tell her you
just walked out the door with a bagful of
banana-flavored condoms? All our ser
vices are completely confidential — all
you need is your SUII).
Do you not like free stuff? Who doesn't
like free stuff? You know you only go to
the Career Fair for the pens. Free flavored
lube is much more fun and you don't even
have to feign interest in consulting.
One in four Stanford students has a
sexually transmitted disease. This, of
course, does not concern you, assuming
that you have never hooked up with any
one, you don't plan to hook up with any
one, none of your friends have ever
hooked up and you are a nun.
Actually, we also offer free information
on reproductive health issues like men
strual problems and abstinence, as well as
unbleached tampons that you can get for
free with your quarterly credit. Nuns
should probably come in too.
But I don't need condoms, you say. My
girlfriend is on the pill. My partner and I
have both been tested fbrSTDs, and we're
negative. I am a lesbian and need con
doms like a fish needs a bicycle. Why
should I bother?
In addition to the aforementioned fla
vored lube and tampons, you can use
your $2 credit towards an impressive se

lection of non-flavored lube, spermicide,
massage oil, dental dams, female con
doms and polyurethane condoms, in
case latex makes you itchy. You can also
grab all the rubber gloves and informa
tional brochures you can carry for free.
So that you don't have to bike back to
Wilbur with condoms falling out of your
pockets, we have plain brown shopping
bags handy.

it? Dear Lord, I could talk for hours.
