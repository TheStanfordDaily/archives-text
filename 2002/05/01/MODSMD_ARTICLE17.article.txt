Support Internet radio and KZSU
I am writing to ask the Stanford com
munity to help support Internet radio in
general and Stanford's radio station,
KZSU 90.1 FM, in particular.
As a volunteer at KZSU, I produce a
weekly broadcast which presents a cross
section of classical music that gets little ex
posure on commercial radio stations.
Other dedicated KZSU volunteers likewise
work to bring diversity to our programs.
In addition to the FM broadcast, our
programs are carried by Internet radio to
listeners around the country and beyond.
1 do not have recent information, but a
pilot Internet radio "netcast" brought
KZSU to listeners in Europe and Asia.
More recently, one of our I) J s received an
e-mail message from scientists listening at
McMurdo Station in Antarctica. And Car
dinal fans from all over have been especial
ly generous this season with financial assis
tance to KZSU's sportscasts. As of May 21,
2002, KZSU could be forced to end this.
KZSU's netcasts are threatened by a
misapplication of DMCA, the Digital Mil
lennium Copyright Act. DMCA autho
rized a Copyright Arbitration Royalty
Panel to evaluate music streamed over the
Internet and make recommendations.
Unfortunately, the panel sent forward a
proposal that stacks the deck against non
profit netcasters such as KZSU. First, the
netcast royalties would be much more ex
pensive than what we already pay for the
privilege of broadcasting copyrighted
music. Second, the record keeping re

quirements from the panel would be unaf
fordable, in terms of both volunteer time
and real dollars. Maintaining these
records also raises concerns with privacy
advocates.
I urge interested readers to visit web
sites that discuss the issues in depth, start
ing with www.saveinternetradio.org. Then
act by communicating your concerns with
your representatives in government.

Provigil has sexual side effect
In yesterday's article on Provigil
("Wonder drug prevents sleep"), the drug
is described as having "virtually no side ef
fects." This is not entirely true; one re
ported effect, which may be of interest to
Stanford students, is inac tivation of oral
contraceptives. There is also some evi
dence of birth defects in laboratory ani
mals, though this has not yet been investi
gated in humans.
Some technical information is available
at www.provigil.com/pi.htm.

'Wonder drug' unworthy of front page
I "here are no wonders produced at will,
let alone in mass quantities; that's why they
are wonders.
But there is journalism that makes us

wonder about the motivation of its author
and the standards of the paper in which it
appears. And that's the case of the "won
der drug prevents sleep" story in yester
day's Daily.
Unless we accept it as a belated April
Fool's Day contribution, there are ques
tions to be answered: Who paid the author
to do publicity fora drug not yet approved
by the Food and Drug Administration?
Why did the editor accept a promotional
story that evidently targets students des
perate for all-nighters ahead of gradua
tion.' Does either of them implicitly en
courage students to seek the drug in the
black market? What is the Stanford con
nection in this story, anyway, to earn it
front-page coverage? Answers, please!
Stealing hours from one's own sleep is a
theft. And it never goes unpunished be
cause the thief and the sufferer are con
demned to permanent cohabitation.

Many international organizations have
been anti-Semitic
In his letter to The Daily on April 30,
Bryce Giddens puts forth the argument
that the Brussels case against Ariel Sharon
cannot be construed as anti-Semitic simply
because it is supported by two large orga
nizations dedicated to international
human rights, Amnesty International and
Human Rights Watch. Unfortunately,
Giddens' argument holds little water and
can be easily refuted by numerous in
stances of open anti-Semitism on the part
of international organizations that are
supposedly dedicated to human rights.
First, consider the case of the Interna
tional Committee of the Red Cross, which
has since 1948 refused to recognize the
Red Star of David as an official symbol for
an ambulance, in spite of the fact that it
recognizes the Red Crescent and used to
recognize the Iranian pre-revolutionary
Red Lion and Sun. In fact, former com
mittee president Cornelio Sommaruga,
the same man that is supposed to be
going to Jenin as Kofi Annan's impartial
investigator, once told the American Red
Cross president in front of many witness
es: "If we're going to have the Shield of
David, why would we not have to accept

the swastika?"
Next, consider the case of the Nobel
Peace Prize Committee, which awarded
the 1994 Peace Prize to Shimon Peres,
Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat. In a re
cent interview, a member of the Peace
Prize Committee, Hanna Kvanmo ex
pressed remorse for having given the
prize to Shimon Peres and wished she
could take it away from him. When asked,
she expressed no such remorse for having
given the prize to Yasser Arafat, even in
spite of his open support for terrorism.
This statement in itself is not necessarily
anti-Semitic until it is taken in light of the
fact that before going into politics, Hanna
Kvanmo spent five years in a Norwegian
jail for being a Nazi collaborator during
World War 11.
Finally, consider the United Nations
itself, which for 10 years, under pres
sure from Arab states and their allies,
kept a resolution on the books equating
Zionism with racism. But even after that
shameful resolution was finally re
pealed, the United Nations was not sat
isfied. Last year's World Conference
Against Racism, held under the aus
pices of the United Nations, adopted

such a hardcore anti-Israeli stance that
even typically pro-Arab European states
were dismayed by the open hatred dis
played there.
I could go on, but I hope the point is
clear. For far too many organizations,
"human rights" and anti-Semitism seem to
go hand in hand. I am not necessarily say
ing that Amnesty International and
Human Rights Watch are anti-Semitic.
What I am saying is that an organization's
supposed commitment to human rights
does not preclude it from being anti-
Semitic at the same time.

Israel's non-compliance a sign of fear
Israel has been embroiled in a dispute
with the United Nations over the Securi
ty Council's call for an investigation into
the recent attack on the Jenin refugee
camp. Israel must not be allowed to defy
the United Nations on this issue. It has
long refused to implement the U.N. Se
curity Council resolutions calling for it to
withdraw from land occupied during the

19(37 war. The world must not sit back
and watch as Israel dictates the Security
Council's formation of a fact-finding mis
sion, as well.
If Israel has nothing to hide, why the
fear? It is about time the world finds out
what happened in Jenin.

In yesterday's article on Provigil
("Wonder drug prevents sleep"), the drug
is described as having "virtually no side ef
fects." This is not entirely true; one re
ported effect, which may be of interest to
Stanford students, is inac tivation of oral
contraceptives. There is also some evi
dence of birth defects in laboratory ani
mals, though this has not yet been investi
gated in humans.
Some technical information is available
at www.provigil.com/pi.htm.

'Wonder drug' unworthy of front page
I "here are no wonders produced at will,
let alone in mass quantities; that's why they
are wonders.
But there is journalism that makes us

wonder about the motivation of its author
and the standards of the paper in which it
appears. And that's the case of the "won
der drug prevents sleep" story in yester
day's Daily.
Unless we accept it as a belated April
Fool's Day contribution, there are ques
tions to be answered: Who paid the author
to do publicity fora drug not yet approved
by the Food and Drug Administration?
Why did the editor accept a promotional
story that evidently targets students des
perate for all-nighters ahead of gradua
tion.' Does either of them implicitly en
courage students to seek the drug in the
black market? What is the Stanford con
nection in this story, anyway, to earn it
front-page coverage? Answers, please!
Stealing hours from one's own sleep is a
theft. And it never goes unpunished be
cause the thief and the sufferer are con
demned to permanent cohabitation.

Many international organizations have
been anti-Semitic
In his letter to The Daily on April 30,
Bryce Giddens puts forth the argument
that the Brussels case against Ariel Sharon
cannot be construed as anti-Semitic simply
because it is supported by two large orga
nizations dedicated to international
human rights, Amnesty International and
Human Rights Watch. Unfortunately,
Giddens' argument holds little water and
can be easily refuted by numerous in
stances of open anti-Semitism on the part
of international organizations that are
supposedly dedicated to human rights.
First, consider the case of the Interna
tional Committee of the Red Cross, which
has since 1948 refused to recognize the
Red Star of David as an official symbol for
an ambulance, in spite of the fact that it
recognizes the Red Crescent and used to
recognize the Iranian pre-revolutionary
Red Lion and Sun. In fact, former com
mittee president Cornelio Sommaruga,
the same man that is supposed to be
going to Jenin as Kofi Annan's impartial
investigator, once told the American Red
Cross president in front of many witness
es: "If we're going to have the Shield of
David, why would we not have to accept

the swastika?"
Next, consider the case of the Nobel
Peace Prize Committee, which awarded
the 1994 Peace Prize to Shimon Peres,
Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat. In a re
cent interview, a member of the Peace
Prize Committee, Hanna Kvanmo ex
pressed remorse for having given the
prize to Shimon Peres and wished she
could take it away from him. When asked,
she expressed no such remorse for having
given the prize to Yasser Arafat, even in
spite of his open support for terrorism.
This statement in itself is not necessarily
anti-Semitic until it is taken in light of the
fact that before going into politics, Hanna
Kvanmo spent five years in a Norwegian
jail for being a Nazi collaborator during
World War 11.
Finally, consider the United Nations
itself, which for 10 years, under pres
sure from Arab states and their allies,
kept a resolution on the books equating
Zionism with racism. But even after that
shameful resolution was finally re
pealed, the United Nations was not sat
isfied. Last year's World Conference
Against Racism, held under the aus
pices of the United Nations, adopted

such a hardcore anti-Israeli stance that
even typically pro-Arab European states
were dismayed by the open hatred dis
played there.
I could go on, but I hope the point is
clear. For far too many organizations,
"human rights" and anti-Semitism seem to
go hand in hand. I am not necessarily say
ing that Amnesty International and
Human Rights Watch are anti-Semitic.
What I am saying is that an organization's
supposed commitment to human rights
does not preclude it from being anti-
Semitic at the same time.

Israel's non-compliance a sign of fear
Israel has been embroiled in a dispute
with the United Nations over the Securi
ty Council's call for an investigation into
the recent attack on the Jenin refugee
camp. Israel must not be allowed to defy
the United Nations on this issue. It has
long refused to implement the U.N. Se
curity Council resolutions calling for it to
withdraw from land occupied during the

19(37 war. The world must not sit back
and watch as Israel dictates the Security
Council's formation of a fact-finding mis
sion, as well.
If Israel has nothing to hide, why the
fear? It is about time the world finds out
what happened in Jenin.

Support Internet radio and KZSU
I am writing to ask the Stanford com
munity to help support Internet radio in
general and Stanford's radio station,
KZSU 90.1 FM, in particular.
As a volunteer at KZSU, I produce a
weekly broadcast which presents a cross
section of classical music that gets little ex
posure on commercial radio stations.
Other dedicated KZSU volunteers likewise
work to bring diversity to our programs.
In addition to the FM broadcast, our
programs are carried by Internet radio to
listeners around the country and beyond.
1 do not have recent information, but a
pilot Internet radio "netcast" brought
KZSU to listeners in Europe and Asia.
More recently, one of our I) J s received an
e-mail message from scientists listening at
McMurdo Station in Antarctica. And Car
dinal fans from all over have been especial
ly generous this season with financial assis
tance to KZSU's sportscasts. As of May 21,
2002, KZSU could be forced to end this.
KZSU's netcasts are threatened by a
misapplication of DMCA, the Digital Mil
lennium Copyright Act. DMCA autho
rized a Copyright Arbitration Royalty
Panel to evaluate music streamed over the
Internet and make recommendations.
Unfortunately, the panel sent forward a
proposal that stacks the deck against non
profit netcasters such as KZSU. First, the
netcast royalties would be much more ex
pensive than what we already pay for the
privilege of broadcasting copyrighted
music. Second, the record keeping re

quirements from the panel would be unaf
fordable, in terms of both volunteer time
and real dollars. Maintaining these
records also raises concerns with privacy
advocates.
I urge interested readers to visit web
sites that discuss the issues in depth, start
ing with www.saveinternetradio.org. Then
act by communicating your concerns with
your representatives in government.
