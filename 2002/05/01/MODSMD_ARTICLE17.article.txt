Support Internet radio and KZSU
I am writing to ask the Stanford com
munity to help support Internet radio in
general and Stanford's radio station,
KZSU 90.1 FM, in particular.
As a volunteer at KZSU, I produce a
weekly broadcast which presents a cross
section of classical music that gets little ex
posure on commercial radio stations.
Other dedicated KZSU volunteers likewise
work to bring diversity to our programs.
In addition to the FM broadcast, our
programs are carried by Internet radio to
listeners around the country and beyond.
1 do not have recent information, but a
pilot Internet radio "netcast" brought
KZSU to listeners in Europe and Asia.
More recently, one of our I) J s received an
e-mail message from scientists listening at
McMurdo Station in Antarctica. And Car
dinal fans from all over have been especial
ly generous this season with financial assis
tance to KZSU's sportscasts. As of May 21,
2002, KZSU could be forced to end this.
KZSU's netcasts are threatened by a
misapplication of DMCA, the Digital Mil
lennium Copyright Act. DMCA autho
rized a Copyright Arbitration Royalty
Panel to evaluate music streamed over the
Internet and make recommendations.
Unfortunately, the panel sent forward a
proposal that stacks the deck against non
profit netcasters such as KZSU. First, the
netcast royalties would be much more ex
pensive than what we already pay for the
privilege of broadcasting copyrighted
music. Second, the record keeping re

quirements from the panel would be unaf
fordable, in terms of both volunteer time
and real dollars. Maintaining these
records also raises concerns with privacy
advocates.
I urge interested readers to visit web
sites that discuss the issues in depth, start
ing with www.saveinternetradio.org. Then
act by communicating your concerns with
your representatives in government.

Provigil has sexual side effect
In yesterday's article on Provigil
("Wonder drug prevents sleep"), the drug
is described as having "virtually no side ef
fects." This is not entirely true; one re
ported effect, which may be of interest to
Stanford students, is inac tivation of oral
contraceptives. There is also some evi
dence of birth defects in laboratory ani
mals, though this has not yet been investi
gated in humans.
Some technical information is available
at www.provigil.com/pi.htm.

'Wonder drug' unworthy of front page
I "here are no wonders produced at will,
let alone in mass quantities; that's why they
are wonders.
But there is journalism that makes us

wonder about the motivation of its author
and the standards of the paper in which it
appears. And that's the case of the "won
der drug prevents sleep" story in yester
day's Daily.
Unless we accept it as a belated April
Fool's Day contribution, there are ques
tions to be answered: Who paid the author
to do publicity fora drug not yet approved
by the Food and Drug Administration?
Why did the editor accept a promotional
story that evidently targets students des
perate for all-nighters ahead of gradua
tion.' Does either of them implicitly en
courage students to seek the drug in the
black market? What is the Stanford con
nection in this story, anyway, to earn it
front-page coverage? Answers, please!
Stealing hours from one's own sleep is a
theft. And it never goes unpunished be
cause the thief and the sufferer are con
demned to permanent cohabitation.
Many envy 1 lonore de Balzac's fame;
would they also be willing to die night
marishly at 51 ?
