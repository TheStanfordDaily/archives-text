A story in yesterday's Daily, "Confer
ence highlights 'going crazy,' " incorrectly
stated two facts.
First, the program was co-sponsored by
the Stanford Undergraduate Psychology
Association and United Students for Vet
erans' Health, not sponsored solely by
United Students for Veterans' Health.
In addition, senior Brady Gordon was
not the only organizer of the conference. Se
nior Helene Mik, junior Trevor Sutton, se
nior Bobby Daly, junior Bryan Choi and ju
nior Danya Patuszek were also organizers.
