## Stanford draws huge crowd in Hawaii 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
After 10,000 spectators watched
the Stanford women's volleyball
team claim the NCAA champi
onship on Dec. 15 at the Cox
Arena in San Diego, the Cardinal
probably figured it would have to
wait until next fall — maybe even
until the NCAA tournament in De
cember — to play in front of a
large crowd again.

Exhibition

Turns out it would see one in its
next match.
A crowd of over 6,000 packed
the Stan Sheriff Center in Hon
olulu on Friday fora spring exhi
bition match between the NCAA
champions and Hawaii, though
the exhibition status of the match
seemed to be lost on the players
and the fans.
The home faithful got their
money's worth, as the Wahine
knocked off the Cardinal, 3-1, in a
match that had the look of a late
season battle instead of the usual
scrimmage-like feel of exhibition
play in the spring.
"I've never seen a spring match
that was like this," said Stanford
head coach John Dunning. "Usu
ally they're-low-key or tourna
ment-oriented. It was remarkable
in terms of the level of play for the
spring. It was probably as high as
I've ever seen."
The end result of the match was
not especially surprising given the
different places the teams were at
heading into the contest.
For Hawaii, the match was the
culmination of its spring season,
and both the team and the fans
were eagerly welcoming the re
turn of sophomore outside hitter
Lily Kahumoku to the lineup. The
2000 Ail-American was playing in
her first match in almost a year

after skipping the fall season for
personal reasons.
Stanford, meanwhile, was
opening its spring schedule in
I lonolulu. Just three weeks into its
spring practices and with five se
niors gone from its fall roster, the
Cardinal squad headed to Hawaii

as a work in progress.
"Hawaii had been building
up to play us, and we've just
started spring ball, so playing in
front of 6,000 wasn't exactly
something we were prepared
for," said junior outside hitter
Ashley Ivy, who hit a team-high

.360 with 12 kills for Stanford.
"But it was definitely an experi
ence that was worth going over
there for. We got some experi
ences that we can definitely use
heading into next year."
Stanford looked sharp in the
opening game, as the team's work
so far in the spring on its passing
and offense showed some early
dividends. Ivy and junior outside
hitter Logan Tom picked up five
kills each and Stanford outhit the
Wahine .368-. 133 in the Cardinal's
30-20 first-game win.
But the tide of the match shift
ed late in the second game, as
Hawaii's offense got rolling and
Stanford's defense was not able to
keep up. Stanford outdug
Hawaii, 20-14, in the first game,
but Hawaii came up with 50 digs
in the last three games to the Car
dinal's 32.
"We picked out two things to
work on so far this spring, our
passing form and our hitting
form," Dunning said. "The things
that usually hurt you are the things
that you didn't practice at all. We
didn't practice defense or our
blocking. It makes sense that they
played better defense than us and
blocked more than us."
With the Cardinal's defense not
up to speed, All-American outside
hitter Kim Willoughby, who led
the NCAA with over six kills per
game last fall, ripped loose, tallying
10 kills in the second game.

tinued after its 30-24 second-game
victory in 30-21 and 30-24 wins the
last two frames.
The Wahine hit over .400 in
each of the last three games, as
Kahumoku returned strongly
with a match-high 23 kills, just one
more than Willoughby, who also
picked up a match-high 19 digs.
Tom finished with 15 kills and
15 digs to lead the Cardinal. Not far
behind were freshman outside hit

The Cardinal will get another
shot at the viscous combination of
Willoughby and Kahumoku dur
ing the 2002 season when Stan
ford heads back to Hawaii fora
late-season contest on Nov. 10.

For now, the Stanford squad is
turning its attention to this week
end, when it will host California
and another team to be deter
mined fora set of matches on Sat
urday at Burnham Pavilion begin
ning at 11:00 a.m.
"We already knew we were
going to shift gears this week,"
Dunning said. "The next way to
work on ball control is to work on
defense. We'll work on controlling
balls that are hit harder and on our
digging form."

After 10,000 spectators watched
the Stanford women's volleyball
team claim the NCAA champi
onship on Dec. 15 at the Cox
Arena in San Diego, the Cardinal
probably figured it would have to
wait until next fall — maybe even
until the NCAA tournament in De
cember — to play in front of a
large crowd again.

WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
Friday: Hawaii 3, Stanford 1,
Exhibition

Turns out it would see one in its
next match.
A crowd of over 6,000 packed
the Stan Sheriff Center in Hon
olulu on Friday fora spring exhi
bition match between the NCAA
champions and Hawaii, though
the exhibition status of the match
seemed to be lost on the players
and the fans.
The home faithful got their
money's worth, as the Wahine
knocked off the Cardinal, 3-1, in a
match that had the look of a late
season battle instead of the usual
scrimmage-like feel of exhibition
play in the spring.
"I've never seen a spring match
that was like this," said Stanford
head coach John Dunning. "Usu
ally they're-low-key or tourna
ment-oriented. It was remarkable
in terms of the level of play for the
spring. It was probably as high as
I've ever seen."
The end result of the match was
not especially surprising given the
different places the teams were at
heading into the contest.
For Hawaii, the match was the
culmination of its spring season,
and both the team and the fans
were eagerly welcoming the re
turn of sophomore outside hitter
Lily Kahumoku to the lineup. The
2000 Ail-American was playing in
her first match in almost a year

after skipping the fall season for
personal reasons.
Stanford, meanwhile, was
opening its spring schedule in
I lonolulu. Just three weeks into its
spring practices and with five se
niors gone from its fall roster, the
Cardinal squad headed to Hawaii

as a work in progress.
"Hawaii had been building
up to play us, and we've just
started spring ball, so playing in
front of 6,000 wasn't exactly
something we were prepared
for," said junior outside hitter
Ashley Ivy, who hit a team-high

.360 with 12 kills for Stanford.
"But it was definitely an experi
ence that was worth going over
there for. We got some experi
ences that we can definitely use
heading into next year."
Stanford looked sharp in the
opening game, as the team's work
so far in the spring on its passing
and offense showed some early
dividends. Ivy and junior outside
hitter Logan Tom picked up five
kills each and Stanford outhit the
Wahine .368-. 133 in the Cardinal's
30-20 first-game win.
But the tide of the match shift
ed late in the second game, as
Hawaii's offense got rolling and
Stanford's defense was not able to
keep up. Stanford outdug
Hawaii, 20-14, in the first game,
but Hawaii came up with 50 digs
in the last three games to the Car
dinal's 32.
"We picked out two things to
work on so far this spring, our
passing form and our hitting
form," Dunning said. "The things
that usually hurt you are the things
that you didn't practice at all. We
didn't practice defense or our
blocking. It makes sense that they
played better defense than us and
blocked more than us."
With the Cardinal's defense not
up to speed, All-American outside
hitter Kim Willoughby, who led
the NCAA with over six kills per
game last fall, ripped loose, tallying
10 kills in the second game.
Hawaii's offensive charged con
tinued after its 30-24 second-game
victory in 30-21 and 30-24 wins the
last two frames.
The Wahine hit over .400 in
each of the last three games, as
Kahumoku returned strongly
with a match-high 23 kills, just one
more than Willoughby, who also
picked up a match-high 19 digs.
Tom finished with 15 kills and
15 digs to lead the Cardinal. Not far
behind were freshman outside hit
