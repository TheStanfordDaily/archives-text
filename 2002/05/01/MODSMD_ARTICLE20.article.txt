# Fantasy baseball brings sporting dreams to life
## 
### 
Once upon a time, the word "fantasy"
had literary connotations for me. A
reference to "fantasy" would call to
my mind either books featuring wiz
ards and warlocks, or steamy, illicit sex as
chronicled in grocery-store novels whose cover
art relied heavily on Fabio not wearing a shirt.
Nowadays, however, "fantasy" makes me
think not of sorcerers and seductresses but
rather of stolen-base totals. Fantasy, as in fanta
sy sports.
Like an ever-increasing number of Internet
users, I participate a little too wholeheartedly
in fantasy sports. It's baseball season, so every
day I set lineups for the next day, ponder
trade possibilities, scan the waiver wire and re
peatedly check to see how the day's games

have treated me.
Many people wonder what
fun there is in a pursuit that is,
for all intents and purposes, an
amalgam of box scores. Sports
are exciting to watch and read
about, but why spend so much
time dissecting their statistics?
To the fantasy uninitiated,
statistics are boring at worst

and useful at best. To the fantasy participant,
though, they are exciting and full of life. A
meaningless stolen base by Corey Patterson in
the eight inning of a blowout loss really mat
ters to me. Without fantasy sports, it wouldn't
matter to anyone except possibly Corey and
his agent.

Therein lies the true value of fantasy: it puts
life in the lifeless. Everything is more exciting,
more worthwhile. I can watch an Orioles-Red
Sox game (two teams I would never otherwise
watch) and enjoy it , because Jorge Julio might
pic k up the save.
Thanks to fantasy, 1 have a vested interest in
players like Patterson and Julio. I, of course,
have my favorite players who 1 follow regard
less of whether or not they're on my fantasy
teams, but thanks to fantasy baseball, I have a
few do/en other players every year about whose
performances I genuinely care about.
There is a certain amount of reciprocity
between my fantasy teams' players and my-

self; I chose them to be on my
team, and they hopefully return
the favor with a solid showing,
propelling my team to the top of
the league standings.
In addition to facilitating
greater fandom, fantasy sports
also enables competition between
oneself and other participants.
For those of us unable to partici
pate directly in professional
sports, fantasy sports take us one
step closer.
I will most likely never be able to
manage a baseball team of any
kind (unless I have a kid and lead

my child's squad to T-ball immor
tality), but 1 can manage my fanta
sy sports teams. And it I do well, I
can take home a fantasy pennant
and feel pride in outsmarting
everyone else.
It is a nice feeling when you dis
cover that Hideki Irabu, who qual
ifies as a starting pitcher, is going to
be in line for some saves and pick
him up before anyone else realizes
that Irabu is all of sudden some
thing more than that guy who
once showed up fora minor
league start completely trashed.
Although I like to be competi
tive, I also of course like to be social
and fantasy sports contribute to the
fulfillment of both desires. Trade
talk or fantasy strategy can all too
easily culminate in a much broader

conversation lasting lor hours.
Sure, sometimes I question my
sanity when 1 think about all the
time I've spent engaged in such a
pedestrian "fantasy." 1 doubt that
Belgarath the Sorcerer or Fabio
play fantasy sports.
Yet, although they may seem a
mere numbers game, fantasy
sports make possible a meaningful
if unromantic vitality. I'm unlikely
to slay a dragon or seduce a disen
chanted baroness anytime soon, so
I'm content with what "fantasy"
means to me.
