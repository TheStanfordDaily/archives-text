Almost six months before "it re
ally Counts," the Stanford women's
soccer team made the short trip
across the Bay to face Pacific 10
Conference rivals California in a
spring season matchup.

WOMEN'S SOCCER

Saturday: Stanford 2, Cali

Despite the graduation of se
nior goalkeeper Carrie Walsh and
co-captains fullback Amy Sauer
and midfielder Christie LaPierre,
Stanford looked in good form as it
tamed the fiesty Golden Bears in a
3-0 victory on Sunday.
"It was the most together per
formance of the spring," said
head coach Andy Nelson. "This
sets a very positive platform for
the remaining month of the
spring season."
Most would think that the loss
of three major components of a
defensive unit would leave large
holes to fill.
But the Cardinal seems to be
making the transition between sea
sons very well.
I'he win is Stanford's third in a
spring season that remains flaw

less from a defensive perspective.
In the last three weeks the Cardi
nal has left its opponents offen
sively frustrated with a 2-0 shutout
over the Mexican national team, a

2-0 defeat over I'aolO nemesis
Southern California and most re
cently the 3-0 drubbing ofCal.
