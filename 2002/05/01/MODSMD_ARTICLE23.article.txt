Almost six months before "it re
ally Counts," the Stanford women's
soccer team made the short trip
across the Bay to face Pacific 10
Conference rivals California in a
spring season matchup.

WOMEN'S SOCCER

Saturday: Stanford 2, Cali
fornia 0, Exhibition

Despite the graduation of se
nior goalkeeper Carrie Walsh and
co-captains fullback Amy Sauer
and midfielder Christie LaPierre,
Stanford looked in good form as it
tamed the fiesty Golden Bears in a
3-0 victory on Sunday.
"It was the most together per
formance of the spring," said
head coach Andy Nelson. "This
sets a very positive platform for
the remaining month of the
spring season."
Most would think that the loss
of three major components of a
defensive unit would leave large
holes to fill.
But the Cardinal seems to be
making the transition between sea
sons very well.
I'he win is Stanford's third in a
spring season that remains flaw

less from a defensive perspective.
In the last three weeks the Cardi
nal has left its opponents offen
sively frustrated with a 2-0 shutout
over the Mexican national team, a

2-0 defeat over I'aolO nemesis
Southern California and most re
cently the 3-0 drubbing ofCal.

Sophomore midfielder Ally Marquand gets past one defender and looks up
field. She and the rest of the Stanford women's soccer team have been im
pressive on both the offensive and defensive ends of the field during the
spring season.
Stanford's recent defensive
prowess is due in part to the re
turn of sophomore goalie
Nicole Barnhart. Barnhart, who
redshirted this past season with
an injured knee, is back and
ready to have the breakthrough
year that most predicted she
would have had earlier this sea
son if not for the injury.
Standing an intimidating 5-
feet-9 inches tall, Barnhardt has
made her presence felt in the
backfield already, making ath
letic diving saves and spectacu
lar catches.
Ironically, a few of Stanford's
most tried and true veterans may
present the most difficult chal
lenge of the spring season for this
current Stanford squad. On Sat
urday the Cardinal will face off
against Stanford alumni in the
annual off-season game.
