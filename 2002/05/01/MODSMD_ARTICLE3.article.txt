# RA applicants speak out against unfairness
## Some re-applicants for Row RA positions consider selection process unjust 
### ELIZABETH MADJLESSI STAFF WRITER 
The resident assistant positions for
next year will be announced tomor
row, but many re-applicants for posi
tions on the Row have already sound
ed off about what they perceive as un
fairness in the selection process.
According to the two-year-old policy,
new applicants applying to the Row go
through group interviews in which they
are asked questions by a student staff
member from each Row house and pro
fessional staff at the C )ftice of Residential
Education. At the end of the group
process, each applicant is asked to sub
mit a form ranking the individual hous
es where they would like to interview.
The process for applicants who are
already RAs is different. Augie Galvan,
the assistant director for student man
agement and the supervisor of the
Row RAs, reviews the written applica
tions and letters of recommendation of
re-applicants. He then offers individ
ual house interviews to the re-appli
cants whom he feels best meet the

needs and challenges of the Row. Gal
van referred questions to Josh Schiller,
coordinator of the RA and college as
sistant selection process.
"I've been in group interviews with
first-time applicants, and 1 think it
made the other applicants look less
qualified in comparison," said junior
Sarah Sheviakov, a re-applicant.

"However, a better way to solve this
problem might be to have one or two
group interviews in front of house
staffs designated specifically for re
turning RAs [to] keep t he playing field
level for everyone."
The re-applicants also met with
Galvan in individual first-round in
terview in which thev told him their

preferences. Galvan subsequently
arranged no less than two house in
terviews per applicant, for some ap
plicants. Others got no interviews at
all. Student managers at Row houses
did not offer their input until Galvan
had decided who moved on to the
second round.
"The only effect of being removed
from Row RA selection [in the prelimi
nary round] is that my options were nar
rowed significantly," Sheviakov said.
Schiller did not release the number
of re-applicants denied interviews, but
many of them have commented on
their situation.
"I know 1 was a good RA last year,
and 1 am seriously committed to Res
Ed, so 1 find it upsetting and unfair
that 1 have been barred from any
chance of working in a Row house,"
said senior Becca Loya. "I would have
liked to see the student manager teams
given a chance to decide for them
selves which RAs to hire, returning
RAs or otherwise."
There are several guidelines in the
selection process to keep the deci
sions unbiased.
"1 make sure that there is consis
tency among all the individual house
and area selection processes," Schiller
said. "There are some general guide
lines given by [Res Ed] to the supervi-
