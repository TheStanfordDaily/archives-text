# RA applicants speak out against unfairness
## Some re-applicants for Row RA positions consider selection process unjust 
### ELIZABETH MADJLESSI STAFF WRITER 
The resident assistant positions for
next year will be announced tomor
row, but many re-applicants for posi
tions on the Row have already sound
ed off about what they perceive as un
fairness in the selection process.
According to the two-year-old policy,
new applicants applying to the Row go
through group interviews in which they
are asked questions by a student staff
member from each Row house and pro
fessional staff at the C )ftice of Residential
Education. At the end of the group
process, each applicant is asked to sub
mit a form ranking the individual hous
es where they would like to interview.
The process for applicants who are
already RAs is different. Augie Galvan,
the assistant director for student man
agement and the supervisor of the
Row RAs, reviews the written applica
tions and letters of recommendation of
re-applicants. He then offers individ
ual house interviews to the re-appli
cants whom he feels best meet the

needs and challenges of the Row. Gal
van referred questions to Josh Schiller,
coordinator of the RA and college as
sistant selection process.
"I've been in group interviews with
first-time applicants, and 1 think it
made the other applicants look less
qualified in comparison," said junior
Sarah Sheviakov, a re-applicant.

"However, a better way to solve this
problem might be to have one or two
group interviews in front of house
staffs designated specifically for re
turning RAs [to] keep t he playing field
level for everyone."
The re-applicants also met with
Galvan in individual first-round in
terview in which thev told him their

preferences. Galvan subsequently
arranged no less than two house in
terviews per applicant, for some ap
plicants. Others got no interviews at
all. Student managers at Row houses
did not offer their input until Galvan
had decided who moved on to the
second round.
"The only effect of being removed
from Row RA selection [in the prelimi
nary round] is that my options were nar
rowed significantly," Sheviakov said.
Schiller did not release the number
of re-applicants denied interviews, but
many of them have commented on
their situation.
"I know 1 was a good RA last year,
and 1 am seriously committed to Res
Ed, so 1 find it upsetting and unfair
that 1 have been barred from any
chance of working in a Row house,"
said senior Becca Loya. "I would have
liked to see the student manager teams
given a chance to decide for them
selves which RAs to hire, returning
RAs or otherwise."
There are several guidelines in the
selection process to keep the deci
sions unbiased.
"1 make sure that there is consis
tency among all the individual house
and area selection processes," Schiller
said. "There are some general guide
lines given by [Res Ed] to the supervi-

sors [and] within that framework
the supervisors (Resident Fel
lows, College Directors and su
pervisors of RAs) have latitude to
determine what exactly their se
lection process will look like."
Among these stipulations is the
requirement that supervisors be
the only people who may review
the returning RA applications
and letters of recommendation.
"I see no logical reason why re
applicants should be more carefully
screened than regular applicants,

especially because 1 112 eel we have al
ready proven our dedication to and
understanding of the Res Ed sys
tem," Loya said. "We have already
been carefully screened, so we are
clearly as qualified or more so than
the new applicants."
The Row selection process is
the same for re-applicants and
first-time applicants after the first
round, with each house submit
ting a form ranking the applicants
they would most like to invite to
an individual house interview.
Galvan takes the two sets of
preference lists and matches ap
plicants to houses.
The Row office contacts each
house to tell them who they will be

interviewing; on Sunday, each
house submitted a final ranked
list to Galvan, stating which appli
cants they liked best.
The final ranked list is ap
proved by Galvan and Schiller
and will be released tomorrow.
"Residential Education is open
to the review of all practices re
garding the RA and CA selection
process," Schiller said. "While in
examining the process this year,
we have found consistency among
supervisors in implementing the
selection process, we will be tak
ing into consideration the feed
back and criticism that has result
ed this year in consultation with
supervisors and current staff."
