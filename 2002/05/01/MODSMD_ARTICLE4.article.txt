### JOHN HUETTER EDITORIAL STAFF 
On an 8-5 vote, freshman Ellie
Martin was elected to next year's
15th and final Senate seat by the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate
over fellow freshman executive
aide Sarah Schulman.
"[This was] definitely one of
the toughest situations I've seen
in the ASSU," Senate Chair Alex
Shvartsman, a senior, said after
the vote.
Senators presented four bills
proposing solutions to the 825-
vote tie between the two candi
dates at Tuesday's ASSU Under
graduate Senate meeting. Accord

Senate to confirm 15 people.

Deputy Chair Mike Osofsky, a
junior, asked fora by-laws
change which would allow for If)
Senators on a Senate in the case
of a lfjth-place tie. However, this
decision had been deemed un
constitutional by other senators.
Senior Charlene Ng, the ap
propriations and rules commit
tee chair, presented three other
solutions proposed by the senate
at last week's meeting. The bills
respectively called fora coin toss
to resolve the issue, a runoff elec

Senate voting between the two
but directing next year's Senate
to make one a non-voting ex offi
cio member.
The runoff bill was immediate
ly discarded, particularly as Mar
tin and Schulman rejected the
idea. "We have elected not to cam
paign at all," Schulman said,
should the Senate call fora runoff.
Senator Sonrisa Lucero, a ju
nior, was in favor of voting and
making the loser an ex officio sen
ator. "Someone always has to give
the tie-breaking vote," she said.
Senator Sandra Liu, a senior,
argued against choosing between
