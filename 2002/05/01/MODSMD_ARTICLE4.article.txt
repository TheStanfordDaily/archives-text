# Martin wins Senate seat over Schulman
## Senators vote 8-5 to select Martin for next year's senate after 825-vote tie 
### JOHN HUETTER EDITORIAL STAFF 
On an 8-5 vote, freshman Ellie
Martin was elected to next year's
15th and final Senate seat by the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate
over fellow freshman executive
aide Sarah Schulman.
"[This was] definitely one of
the toughest situations I've seen
in the ASSU," Senate Chair Alex
Shvartsman, a senior, said after
the vote.
Senators presented four bills
proposing solutions to the 825-
vote tie between the two candi
dates at Tuesday's ASSU Under
graduate Senate meeting. Accord
ing to senators, the two were very
qualified and had worked diligent
ly together on the same issues.
"This is a very hig decision,"
Shvartsman said. He said it was
the constitutional duty of the
Senate to confirm 15 people.

Deputy Chair Mike Osofsky, a
junior, asked fora by-laws
change which would allow for If)
Senators on a Senate in the case
of a lfjth-place tie. However, this
decision had been deemed un
constitutional by other senators.
Senior Charlene Ng, the ap
propriations and rules commit
tee chair, presented three other
solutions proposed by the senate
at last week's meeting. The bills
respectively called fora coin toss
to resolve the issue, a runoff elec
tion between the two and the
Senate voting between the two
but directing next year's Senate
to make one a non-voting ex offi
cio member.
The runoff bill was immediate
ly discarded, particularly as Mar
tin and Schulman rejected the
idea. "We have elected not to cam
paign at all," Schulman said,
should the Senate call fora runoff.
Senator Sonrisa Lucero, a ju
nior, was in favor of voting and
making the loser an ex officio sen
ator. "Someone always has to give
the tie-breaking vote," she said.
Senator Sandra Liu, a senior,
argued against choosing between

the two and supported a coin toss
instead. "I don't feel we have ac
curate information or adequate
criteria [to vote]," Liu said.
"Coin toss is not quite a demo
cratic process," Schulman said.
Osofsky said that a coin toss "re
inforces every flaw the student
body has with the ASSU."
"It personifies our 'inability to
make decisions,'" Osofsky said.
Osofsky's proposal fora 16th
senator failed 1-12, with only Os
ofsky voting in favor.

Ng's proposal that the Senate
vote passed 12-1, with only Liu
voting against.
The two candidates took
turns speaking with the other
out of the room on their plans
for next year. Martin was chosen
by a secret ballot, though the
votes will be made public. She
called the result "bittersweet."
She said she had talked to
Schulman, "making her promise
she'd stay involved." Martin said
she hoped Schulman would win a
seat on the presidential cabinet if
she desired.
Schulman said earlier to the
Senate that she'd be happy to
serve as an ex officio member.

"I'm really passionate and really
dedicated to [the ASSU]," she
said.
On a grander scale, the Senate
also certified the results of the
2002 ASSU Election, thereby
transferring the ASSU's power to
its newly elected officials. The
new Senate will take office Tues
day after an orientation this Sat
urday.
"This is our last hurrah; this is
it," Shvartsman said. He "deeply,
deeply, deeply" thanked the Sen
ate for their hard work.
"It's been called the most pro
ductive Senate, and it is com
pletely due to your work," he
said.
