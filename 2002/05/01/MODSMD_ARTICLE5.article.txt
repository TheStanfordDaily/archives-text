# Two brains are better than one
## Faculty couples 
### AMELIA DELAPAZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While some may see research as a highly
individual enterprise, for many Stanford
professors it's a family matter.
Stanford is home to several highly quali
fied professors who are united by matrimony
as well as academia.
The widespread presence of professor
couples on campus is a relatively new phe
nomenon, though.
Eve and Herb Clark, professors, of linguis
tics and psychology respectively, arrived at
Stanford in 1971. At that time there were rel
atively few couples on the faculty here. Stan
ford has been hiring more in the past 30 years.
"You meet a lot of couples now. It isn't
rare," Herb Clark said. Eve Clark attributes
the increase of faculty couples to the increase
in female professors since the 19705.
Although women make up less than half of
both darks' departments, the fraction of

women in each department is much larger
iliiin it was 30 years ago.
"To some extent I think it's due to the
gradual dawning on people that women can
be smart, and that smart people tend to be at
tracted to each other so that perhaps more
than one member of a couple can be good
enough to hire," said Penny Eckert, a linguis
tics professor and director of the Program in
Feminist Studies.
Eckert and her husband, Ivan Sag, also a
linguistics professor, are another faculty
couple. Unlike the (Harks, they met at Stan
ford â€” he was a professor and she was a vis
iting professor. Eckert was teaching in
Chicago until 1994, so they had a commut
ing relationship.
Often situations like this occur because
two positions at the same university are not
open at the same time. "Getting two jobs at
once is complicated," said Herb Clark. It can
be especially complicated when
couples require two jobs in the
same department.
Some academic couples work
around this problem by looking for
jobs at universities in close proxim
ity to each other. A common pat
tern at Stanford is for one spouse to
work here and one to hold a posi
tion at the UC-Berkeley.
Raising children is another com
mon problem facing faculty cou
ples. The difficult working years be
fore professors receive tenure are,
for the most part, the same years
that non-acadeinic couples are
starting their families. Therefore
academic couples must either have
children earlier or later than they
otherwise would have.
Matthew Scott and Margaret

Fuller, both professors of develop
mental biology and genetics, are an
example of a faculty couple who
had their children relatively late.
That decision, however, did not
solve all their problems.
Now they must worry about
how to arrange for adequate day
care while they are busy with their
jobs. Although preschool has be
come better and more common at
Stanford and around the country,
Fuller sees day care as an "issue
that Stanford could do a lot more
about."
Scott and Fuller send their 4-
year-old daughter to the Bing
Nursery School and their older son
to elementary school. Yet they say
that this is still not adequate. The
Bing school only runs for halfof the
day, so they must arrange care for
their daughter in the afternoons. In
addition, they often have trouble
coordinating their vacations with
those of their children.

Faculty couples must also deal
with unfounded assumptions about
their relationship by people both
inside and outside the university.
The Clarks were often treated as if
Herb worked at Stanford and Eve
did not.
"There is a very general stereo
type that women don't work and
men do," Eve Clark explained.
She also said people make this as
sumption less frequently than in
the past.
Fuller and Scott said that people
will assume whatever Scott knows
Fuller does as well. Nevertheless,
for the most part the two "operate
independently and people recog
nize that," Fuller stated.
In the long run, however, lor
many professors the benefits out
weigh the few difficulties faculty
couples might face.
"The ability to understand and
appreciate what the other person is
doing is very helpful," Scott said.
