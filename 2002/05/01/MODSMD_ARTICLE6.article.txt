# Anti-Islamic e-mails sent to students
## 
### JENNIFER KONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
An anonymous e-mail messages targeting Mus
lims was sent to officers of the Islamic Society of
Stanford University last weekend. Asst. Dean ofStu
dents Tommy Lee Woon and Dean of Students
Marc VVais are following up on the message, which
comes after a string of recent hate mail targeting the
Arab and Muslim communities at Stanford.
Addressed to "Killers of the Innocents," the e
mail was signed, "Mourner." The letter accused
Muslims of killing "innocent non-Muslim brothers
and sisters," also stating, "VOI R forefathers were
murderers, YOU are ancestral murderers and
YOUR future generations would be murderers."
In addition, last Friday an e-mail directed to
ward Arabs was sent to a dorm mailing list. Accord
ing to Woon, the author was approached by several
residents and later wrote an apology.
There have been 15 cases of offensive mail re
ported by students since Sept. 11, Woon said.
Eleven of these cases have been targeted against
Muslims.
The letter sent this weekend was forwarded to
Woon and Wais, who then notified computer secu
rity, as well as the Stanford Police. Computer secu
rity reported that the e-mail came from off-campus,
Woon said, leaving open the possibility that it may

have been sent from another
country.
In cases of hate mail, the Uni
versity follows its Protocol to Ad
dress Acts of Intolerance, accord
ing to VVoon. I his protocol,
which has been in effect for four
years, deals with acts of intoler
ance and not hate crimes. VVoon
also pointed out that though the
hate mail that has been sent re
cently is "not a violation of any
code," it does "merit action."
"We are also very careful not to
incriminate anyone when it is
protected speech," Woon said.
Society officers feel that the
hate mail poses a threat that must
be addressed.
"If such e-mail [messages] be
come increasingly persistent, it is
bound to create tension amongst
the student body," said sopho
more Imran Moinuddin, society
treasurer. "These e-mail [mes
sages] provoke both ethnic and
religious values, and students
should be aware of what has been
happening lately with an increas
ing frequency."

Junior Mohammed Abdool
carim, a society officer and the
vice president of the Muslim Stu
dents Awareness Network, said
he feels that people should turn to
more constructive methods to ex
press their concerns for the issues
that have been raised.
"I'm not sure who or what mo
tivated the hate mail, but I think a
lot of people are taking their frus
trations and anger out in uncon
structive ways," Abdoolcarim
said. "Yes, there have been a lot of
issues emerging from Sept. 11,
but rather than blaming others,
we need to focus on fostering un
derstanding, knowledge and tol
erance."
In an e-mail message to admin
istration, faculty and students,
Wais urged people to help raise
awareness of the issue.
"As is our practice, I encourage
you to make your staff and fellow
students aware of these hurtful
incidents," Wais said.
"Offensive messages hurt our
community in the way that broken
windows hurt our community,"
Woon remarked. "When we don't
repair our windows, it encourages
more broken windows. So when
ever we get these kinds of mes
sages we take them very seriously."
