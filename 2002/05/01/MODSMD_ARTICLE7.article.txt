# Students help relieve poverty through Web
## Stanford Project on Hunger; Class of 2005 team up for Poverty Fighters campaign 
### WAYNN LUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Project on Hunger and the
Class 0f2005 recently teamed up to sponsor two
campaigns to raise student awareness about glob
al poverty.
I Tie campaigns consisted of e-mails and flyers
designed to encourage students to click on a link
at the Web site www.povertyfighters.com. Kach
time a user clicks on the link, corporate sponsors
donate 25 cents to battle poverty worldwide. The
second campaign will continue until May 5. Both
efforts are sponsored by Oxfani America.
Each campaign was designed as a competi
tion, pitting over 80 colleges against each other.
Hie first ended on April 15, with Stanford com-
ing in third behind Birmingham
Southern and Brandeis, which
started the drive. Both efforts are
sponsored by ()xfam America.
Every time a student goes to the
Poverty Fighters Web site, he
chooses the school he represents
and then clicks on a link to donate
for that school. Students also have
the additional choice of clicking an
other link, allowing each student to
donate up to twice a day.
"Global poverty is one of the
most serious issues facing the world
today," said junior Avinash Kaza,
the co-director of the Stanford I'm

ject on Hunger. "A quarter of the
world's population lives on less
than $1 a day and 40 percent live
on less than $2 a day. One-sixth of
the people in this world are chron
ically hungry."
Aimee Grace, a member of the
sophomore class cabinet, said that
"Abig problem we had in the begin
ning was that a lot of students were
die king but didn't know to identify
themselves as Stanford students, so
we didn't get the credit for the clicks,
though the money still goes towards
lighting poverty," Grace said.
"I think one of the most inter
esting parts is the competition be
tween the schools," Kaza said.
"Also, it seems that this is an inno
vative way of using technology for
societal good."

The donations involve a con
cept called "microcredit," which
the Web site describes as "a bank
ing service for poor people who
want to work. With little or no col
lateral, a poor person can borrow
$25 to $5,000 to open a little busi
ness, or to make a business they
already have more profitable."
Through the program, corpo
rate sponsors donate to participat
ing microcredit banks. The three
microlenders that will be responsi
ble for distributing the funds this
summer are A1 Amana in Morocco,
Fondo Latinoamericano de Desar
rollo in Costa Rica and Women's
World Bank ing Bucamaragan in
Colombia, said Andrew Laties, co
founder and CEO of Poverty
Fighters.
