In Nelly Rosario's debut novel
Song of the Water Saints, she traces
the lives of three generations of
courageous Dominican women.
"The circle of myth, history,
longing and grief in Song of the
Water Saints will envelope the
reader as it does the lives of
Nelly Rosario's beautifully realized
characters. - Maureen Howard,
author of A Lover's Almanac.
Nelly Rosario was born in 1972
in the Dominican Republic and
moved to New York just three
months after. She has received
numerous awards, her most
recent being proclaimed a
Writer on the Verge in the
Voice Literary Supplement.
