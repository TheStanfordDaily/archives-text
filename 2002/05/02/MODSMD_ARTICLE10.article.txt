Tulare County takes over
as national leader in
agriculture production
FRESNO, Calif . (AP) â€” Fresno County no longer is the
nation's king of agriculture.
Since 1954, Fresno County held the No. 1 national rank
ing in agricultural production. Recent figures show Tulare
County, where the value of milk stood at $1.2 billion in
2001, now has the title.
Tulare County's crop value jumped to a record $3.5 bil
lion last year, compared with Fresno County's $3.2 billion.
"There was a lot of milk, and that really helped us," said
Cary Kunkel, Tulare County Agricultural Commissioner.
"Crapes didn't do well, and that hurt Fresno."
Milk prices and production totals rose so much in Tulare
County's huge dairy industry that they created the first
ever billion dollar commodity fora single California coun
ty. Fresno County's huge grape industry was in disarray last
year, dropping in value by $147 million to $343 million.
