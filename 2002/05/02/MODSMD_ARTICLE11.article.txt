1977
On May 2, 1977, The Daily ran an article
about a court case brought to the U.S.
Supreme Court in which the Daily was a de
fendant.
"The City of Palo Alto has petitioned the
U.S. Supreme Court to review the decision of
two lower courts that a 1971 search of the
Daily offices by Palo Alto Police was unconsti
tutional.
"The city argues the decisions will severely
curtail the ability of police and other inves
tigative agencies to gather evidence against
suspects.
"In his 1972 decision, Federal District
Judge Robert Peckham ruled that the
search violated both the First and Fourth
Amendments, and on Feb. 2, 1977, the U.S.
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that
decision.
"Peckham said police should use the 'least
drastic means' available when seeking evi
dence from nonsuspects.
"The police obtained a search warrant, giv
ing the Daily no advance warning, rather
than a subpoena, a less drastic option the
Daily could have attempted to quash.
"The case, Stanford Daily vs. Zurcher, is a
result of a raid on Daily offices by four Palo Alto
policemen on April 12, 1971. Equipped with a
search warrant, police went through files,
desks and wastebaskets looking for photo
graphic evidence to use against participants in
an April 9, 1971 riot at the Stanford hospital.
"In their petition, the city's attorneys argue
that the decision 'sets the stage for virtually
warrant-free sanctuaries. Thus, the premises
of a friend, sweetheart, or relative can safely
conceal evidence or the ill-gotten gains of the
criminal.
"Peckham said the search violated the
Fourth Amendment protection against'unrea
sonable search and seizure.' He warned law en
forcement agencies to be especially careful
when First Amendment interests are involved.
In such cases he said, 'the subpoena should al
ways be preferred to a search warrant.'
Bottom line: It seems The Daily, a tangible embodi
ment of the ideals of the First Amendment, has al
ways been the paragon of truth, justice and right
eousness. The Daily 1, "The Man" 0.
