## The 						Stanford Daily Federal cuts in student loans harm students 
### 
Published Since 1891

Since 1986, the federal govern
ment's student loan program has
allowed students to pursue higher
education while minimizing debt
by consolidating student loans at fixed,
low interest rates. We oppose the Bush ad
ministration's plan to cut $1.3 billion in
funding from this program to reduce the
budget deficit. Reducing the cost of high
er education, especially in the current eco
nomic downturn, should be a priority for
the president.
We are troubled by the message this plan
sends about the president's priorities, espe
cially after last year's controversial tax cut.
Not only does this plan unjustly hurt stu
dents before t hey even have a chance to be
come financially independent, but the act
implicitly indicates that the federal govern-

ment does not believe education to be a
worthwhile investment.
The main argument in favor of the plan
is that high-income professionals have
been able to avoid paying high interest
rates on their student loans by consolidat
ing them. The way the program works is
that the government effectively pays the
difference between the low consolidated
rate and the market rate.
From the proposal we can only infer that
some government officials do not believe
students should be successful after leaving
college, or that everyone should be pun
ished because of the success of a few â€” nei
ther of which seems to make much sense.
Even if many wealthy men and women have
gained from not paying variable interest
rates on educational loans, it does not follow

that all students, including those who may
not enjoy great monetary success after col
lege, should be penalized.
Especially in the current economic down
turn, many college students worry about
their ability to pay off student loans, even at
current low interest rates. Making this pro
cess more difficult will delay students' ability
to become financially independent in the fu
ture, after already making it difficult for them
to complete their degrees.
YVe recognize the trials our country has
undergone this year, and understand the
motivation to cut spending. Still, we do
not think education should be perma
nently affected by these factors. If this
plan is approved, the federal government
should consider only temporarily cutting
these funds until the budget stabilizes, and

then should re-implement the loan con
solidation program.
If the government's primary worry is
about loans and interest rates, perhaps al
ternative uses of the program's money
should be investigated. For example, the
government could choose to provide grants
to students seeking a college education.
Some believe the money could be allocated
into other education programs; we would
support this measure, but still believe it is in
the government's best interest to fund high
er education in some other manner.
Our country prides itself on being a meri
tocracy, where education is a key component
to success. In light of this philosophy, we be
lieve the federal government should be the
last body to place any obstacle between stu
dents and their college degrees.
