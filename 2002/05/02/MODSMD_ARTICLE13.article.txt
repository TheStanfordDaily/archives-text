# CANNONBALL COMING
## Folding on the thesis 
### 
Tuesday morning, 1 woke up
and decided that 1 wasn't
going to the library. I wasn't
going lo iromp off to work
with my briefcase in one hand and a sack
lunch in the backpack, sit in my base
ment cubicle a few jump-steps away from
my rented library locker, stare at my
computer screen and slowly, grindingly,
pound out words on my thesis.
I needed to clear my head. I needed
to purify my system. So I decided I was
going to drive to Vegas with some
friends.
One of them pointed out that I prob
ably wouldn't want to get back to pon-

dering the nature of the
state and the legitimacy
of civilian defense mili
tias after a weekend of
tables, twenties and ta
tas. So, with his sage ad
vice in mind. I decided
that the craps table was
more important. I'm
quitting the thesis and

still going to Vegas. I leave today at 1
p.m.
II there's one thing I don't want to he,
it's a quitter. There's nothing worse than
Feeling the siinij of knowing that you've
let someone down.
But I don'l feel bad at all about quitting
the thesis. I don't have a hole in my stomach
like I've missed out on tapping my true po
tential. The only person I'm letting down is
myself. And, frankly, I don't care.
In the five minutes that I took to pon
der my decision, I thought I'd feel worth
less and wasteful after quitting. I thought
I'd feel like a spoiled, pathetic, undisci
plined young punk. I do. But 1 love it.
After all, il I had never decided to
write a thesis, I could've graduated last
quarter and watched Behind the Music
marathons all quarter long. Think of all
the intriguing stories I've missed! for
eigner. Poison, Vanilla Ice. I have only a
few more weeks to catch up.
1 here's no use in pretending here. I
value hard work, I value scholarly disci
pline. But, while Stanford might have
changed me, I'm no intellectual. My weeks
in the depths of the library taught me that.
Instead of reading upon the Peruvian
effort to defeat the Shining Path insur
gency, I was dreaming about checking
up on something in the Internet or surf
ing through cable.
In my head I was thinking, "Surely
something important lias happened in
the past three hours, something worth
reading about in the Washington Post,
the New York limes, (iNN.com, abc

news.com or slate.com. There's got to be
something worth watching on ESPN,
VHI, MTV, SCBN, ESPN 2. Fox Sports,
Sky Sports, the History Channel, Show
time, HBO or HB()2."
|list getting back to my room to plug
my computer back into the Ethernet
cable was always a high point for me.
So, I'm glad I took the opportunity to
delve into a research project as vast as
mine was. I'm glad I became an "expert"
on something other than inane sports
minutiae. But, 1 simply can't put forth
the discipline necessary to spend weeks
locked into the library hunched over my
omnipresent notebook computer.
I can grind out days, weeks and months
of hard work. But it's got to be practical,
tangible, meaningful work. Like sitting in
112 ront of a table with a Jack and coke in one
hand and a pair of dice in the other.
I'm sure departments look at people
like me as examples when deciding the
guidelines lor who should and who
shouldn't be allowed to write a thesis.
They took a chance on a guy with a CPA
below 3.5 and, look what happened, he
quit so he could drink and play his way
through the last two months of school.
But that would ignore all that I did ac
complish. I learned a great deal about a
broad range of topics and a maddening
amount about a specific one. I have a filing
cabinet worth of material that I still sadly
love to look through. All I'm missing is any
one page of written work. I hat's all.
Now I'm not one of those Stanford
guys who says it's time to stop and smell
the roses, that you can't get all caught up
with grades and jobs and the rat race of
conventional life. But sometimes you just
have to cut loose and decide what's more
important to you. Accomplishment? Suc
cess? Respect? Please.
Sure, after I lose my shirt and my
pants and my shoes in Vegas, 1 might be
preaching a different tune. I might be
promoting an austere life of hard work
and discipline. But I doubt it.
I bis weekend, I'm driving to Vegas,
putting oti my sunglasses, ordering up a
drink and descending into a few days of
big bombs, buffets and Benjamins. Lots
of them. Then I'm going to tome back to
"school," lay on my roommate's bed and
watch the stunning conclusion to the
Real Wrtrld/Road Rules Challenge.
No more charades. The thesis is done
for. It's time to live life outside of the library,
back in the real world. Nut I louse anyone?
