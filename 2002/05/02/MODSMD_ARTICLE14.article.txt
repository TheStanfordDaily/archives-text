## Daily presents 'anti-Israel' slant 
### 
It is with growing concern that 1 read
1 lie Daily each clay, for during the past
week there have been several large arti
cles printed that are anti-Israel in slant,
and yet no articles have been featured
that represent the anti-Semitism that is
growing in I he world today, or the hor
rendous attacks made against Israelis
around the world.
Your "Conflict continues in West Bank"
from the Associated Press (May 1) had a
definite anti-Israel slant. The article said
that Israel "defied the United Nations," a
sentiment echoed in Ammar Nayfeh's let
ter to the editor entitled "Israel's non-com
pliance a sign of fear" (May 1).
You bet your life that Israel is afraid. Is
rael is afraid that it will be judged unfairly by
a prejudiced "fact-finding" team that will
find facts for as many Israeli military blun
ders as possible, while ignoring the facts of
the Palestinian attacks against civilians. This
well-justified fear is what prompts Israel to
"defy" the United Nations.
The Associated Press article also de
scribed an incident in which "a 2-year
old girl was killed when Israeli tanks
opened lire," but the fact that Palestini
ans had recently gone from home to
home shooting Jewish mothers and chil
dren at breakfast or in their beds was
glossed over with the mention of "a
deadly shoot ijig attack on a nearby Jew
ish settlement." The choice to point out
the age of the child, and linger on the
mistake that the Israeli tank inadvertent
ly made is parallel with a choice to brush
quickly past the systematic massacre of a
number of Jewish civilians, including
many young children.
My synagogue in Berkeley received a
bomb threat this week, as did nearly
every Jewish religious institution in the
Berkeley area. Also this week the Berke
ley City Council voted on a resolution to
ban Israeli businesses in the area and to
not allow any more to open up shop. The
resolution only failed because it received
tie vote and a majority is needed to pass.
A tie vote!
This clearly anti-Jewish resolution
came to a tie, in our Bay Area. Thankfully,
no resolution was suggested for the ban
ning of Palestinian businesses.
And then this week the Daily printed
one-sided articles such as Kareem
Chanem s "Israel and the United States
are not lighting the same war."
I believe that the Daily should contin
ue to print such articles. The Daily
should also print featured articles illumi
nating other viewpoints on the situation.
Otherwise I feel that the unsafe anti-Jew
ish, anti-Israel sentiment that is burning
down synagogues in France and threat
ening Bay Area Jews is claiming ground
within our own campus.
I hope that in the future the Daily will
contribute to broader, understanding.
I here is no time left to waste.

Israel afraid of 'biased' commission
In response to Ammar Nayfeh's letter
entitled "Israel's non-compliance a sign
of fear," Israel is not afraid of what a
U.N. fact-finding mission would find.
What Israel is afraid of is the fact that the
current commission would likely be
strongly biased, and not at all impartial.
However, Nayfeh is correct that it is
about time the world finds out what hap
pened in Jenin. Then the world will know
that it is just another lie, to go along with
the lies of Israeli airplanes dropping poi
soned candy (official Palestine news agen
cy Wala, May 21, 2001), or of Jews using
the blood of Christian and Muslim chil
dren for their holiday foods (Al-Riyadh,
Saudi Arabia, March 10, 2002).

Jews troubled by hate mail
As Jews, we were deeply troubled to read
that some spiteful coward has sent a vitriolic
hate e-mail to the officers at Islamic Scxiety
oi Stanford University, and that this was just
the latest in a string of hate mail targeting
Arabs and Muslims at Stanford. We in the
Stanford community can and frequently do
disagree about geopolitics or Middle East
policy, but we stand united against such
naked displays of prejudice and hatred.
We join our fellow Muslim and Arab
students in condemning this harassment,
and urge the perpetrator to come forth
and attach his or her name to this trash.

Thank you for the report about the re
cent "Anti-Islamic e-mails sent to students."
Your reports play an important role in c all
ing attention to the realities of hate and bias
in our world as well supporting efforts to
prevent these incidents from undermining
the c limate of respect at Stanford.
To avoid an avalanche of messages
from readers, I wish to clarify one state

ment in your report that was attributed to
ine: "This protocol which has been in ef
fect for four years, deals with acts of intol
erance and not hate crimes."
This quote misstates the point 1 was
making. I was trying to say that the proto
col effectively addresses a range of inci
dents and is not limited to hate crimes.
All hate crimes are acts of intolerance,
but not all acts of intolerance are hate
crimes. The protocol is valuable because it
enables us to coordinate interventions for
a range of acts of intolerance. We can ad
dress acts of intolerance that are not hate
crimes through public awareness, educa
tion, dialogue, and mediation and for acts
that are hate crimes through our Funda
mental Standard and hate crime laws. I do
not want readers to think that the protocol
doesn't respond to hate crimes.

Thank you for the report about the re
cent "Anti-Islamic e-mails sent to students."
Your reports play an important role in c all
ing attention to the realities of hate and bias
in our world as well supporting efforts to
prevent these incidents from undermining
the c limate of respect at Stanford.
To avoid an avalanche of messages
from readers, I wish to clarify one state

ment in your report that was attributed to
ine: "This protocol which has been in ef
fect for four years, deals with acts of intol
erance and not hate crimes."
This quote misstates the point 1 was
making. I was trying to say that the proto
col effectively addresses a range of inci
dents and is not limited to hate crimes.
All hate crimes are acts of intolerance,
but not all acts of intolerance are hate
crimes. The protocol is valuable because it
enables us to coordinate interventions for
a range of acts of intolerance. We can ad
dress acts of intolerance that are not hate
crimes through public awareness, educa
tion, dialogue, and mediation and for acts
that are hate crimes through our Funda
mental Standard and hate crime laws. I do
not want readers to think that the protocol
doesn't respond to hate crimes.

It is with growing concern that 1 read
1 lie Daily each clay, for during the past
week there have been several large arti
cles printed that are anti-Israel in slant,
and yet no articles have been featured
that represent the anti-Semitism that is
growing in I he world today, or the hor
rendous attacks made against Israelis
around the world.
Your "Conflict continues in West Bank"
from the Associated Press (May 1) had a
definite anti-Israel slant. The article said
that Israel "defied the United Nations," a
sentiment echoed in Ammar Nayfeh's let
ter to the editor entitled "Israel's non-com
pliance a sign of fear" (May 1).
You bet your life that Israel is afraid. Is
rael is afraid that it will be judged unfairly by
a prejudiced "fact-finding" team that will
find facts for as many Israeli military blun
ders as possible, while ignoring the facts of
the Palestinian attacks against civilians. This
well-justified fear is what prompts Israel to
"defy" the United Nations.
The Associated Press article also de
scribed an incident in which "a 2-year
old girl was killed when Israeli tanks
opened lire," but the fact that Palestini
ans had recently gone from home to
home shooting Jewish mothers and chil
dren at breakfast or in their beds was
glossed over with the mention of "a
deadly shoot ijig attack on a nearby Jew
ish settlement." The choice to point out
the age of the child, and linger on the
mistake that the Israeli tank inadvertent
ly made is parallel with a choice to brush
quickly past the systematic massacre of a
number of Jewish civilians, including
many young children.
My synagogue in Berkeley received a
bomb threat this week, as did nearly
every Jewish religious institution in the
Berkeley area. Also this week the Berke
ley City Council voted on a resolution to
ban Israeli businesses in the area and to
not allow any more to open up shop. The
resolution only failed because it received
tie vote and a majority is needed to pass.
A tie vote!
This clearly anti-Jewish resolution
came to a tie, in our Bay Area. Thankfully,
no resolution was suggested for the ban
ning of Palestinian businesses.
And then this week the Daily printed
one-sided articles such as Kareem
Chanem s "Israel and the United States
are not lighting the same war."
I believe that the Daily should contin
ue to print such articles. The Daily
should also print featured articles illumi
nating other viewpoints on the situation.
Otherwise I feel that the unsafe anti-Jew
ish, anti-Israel sentiment that is burning
down synagogues in France and threat
ening Bay Area Jews is claiming ground
within our own campus.
I hope that in the future the Daily will
contribute to broader, understanding.
I here is no time left to waste.

Israel afraid of 'biased' commission
In response to Ammar Nayfeh's letter
entitled "Israel's non-compliance a sign
of fear," Israel is not afraid of what a
U.N. fact-finding mission would find.
What Israel is afraid of is the fact that the
current commission would likely be
strongly biased, and not at all impartial.
However, Nayfeh is correct that it is
about time the world finds out what hap
pened in Jenin. Then the world will know
that it is just another lie, to go along with
the lies of Israeli airplanes dropping poi
soned candy (official Palestine news agen
cy Wala, May 21, 2001), or of Jews using
the blood of Christian and Muslim chil
dren for their holiday foods (Al-Riyadh,
Saudi Arabia, March 10, 2002).

Jews troubled by hate mail
As Jews, we were deeply troubled to read
that some spiteful coward has sent a vitriolic
hate e-mail to the officers at Islamic Scxiety
oi Stanford University, and that this was just
the latest in a string of hate mail targeting
Arabs and Muslims at Stanford. We in the
Stanford community can and frequently do
disagree about geopolitics or Middle East
policy, but we stand united against such
naked displays of prejudice and hatred.
We join our fellow Muslim and Arab
students in condemning this harassment,
and urge the perpetrator to come forth
and attach his or her name to this trash.
