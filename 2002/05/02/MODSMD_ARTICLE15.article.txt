## Stanford beats Davis 
### ANNIE NYBORG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's lacrosse
team's season isn't quite over just
yet, but a big chapter has closed for
senior attacker Liz Britt and senior
defender Emily Rodriguez.

WOMEN'S LACROSSE
Tuesday: Stanford 11, UC-
Davis 4
Saturday-Sunday: Stanford
competes at Mountain Pacific
Lacrosse League Tournament,
Berkeley

It was Senior Night at New Mal
oney Field on Tuesday, as the Car
dinal matched up against UC-Davis
(8-6, 2-6 Mountain Pacific Lacrosse
League) in the team's last home
game of the season and the last of
the two seniors' careers.
The seniors combined for three
points—a goal by Britt and a pair of
assists by Rodriguez — as Stanford
claimed an 11-4 victory to remain
undefeated in MPLLplay at 8-oand
improve to 9-7 overall.
"I've watched this team grow
and develop over the past four
years, and it's definitely sad that
something I've committed myself to
for so long is ending," Britt said.
"But I'm really excited to follow this
team in the future. They are head-

Ed for great things"
The Cardinal started off the
game strong, scoring in the opening
minute of play.
"The offense really gelled," said
sophomore defender Katie Grube.
"Our offense was patient and wait
ing for 100 percent opportunities.
They did a great job at keeping the
ball clown at [the Aggies'] end."
On the defensive side, the team
maintained good communication,
although the defense was a little
hurried moving the ball upfield,
leading to some sloppy plays.
Stanford finished the first half
with a 9-2 lead.
"We're happy with the first
half, but we were a little frantic
bringing the ball out," said coach
Michele Uhlfeider. "We had too
many turnovers."
In the second half, the Cardinal
lost some of its fire as the Aggies bat
tled back with a pair of goals.
The Cardinal's offensive fluidity
in the first half seemed to break
down in the second, allowing UC-
Davis to hold Stanford to only'two
goals in the last 30 minutes of play.
"We saw this match tonight as
two games," said Uhlfeider. "The
first half was one game which we are
happy with. The second game was
2-2. The challenge now is how to
maintain the hunger and the fire.

we need to focus on deciding what it's going
to take to be fearless."

with Denver while Stanford will take on either
the Aggies or Saint Mary's. Sunday will fea
ture the championship match.
In the few days leading up to the tourna
ment, the team expects to focus on maintain
ing its control of the tempo of the game.
"We still have a big step to take this late in
the season and we're ready to do that this
weekend," Britt said. "We have not come out
in our second halves as strongly as we do in
our firsts. We know strategically how to do it,
it's just a matter of implementing it out there
on the field."
