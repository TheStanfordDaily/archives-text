This week, the Stanford soft
ball team showed it could easily
handle non-conference foes. But
the time has come to prove that it
can do the same with its Pacific 10
Conference competition.

The No. 8 Cardinal (39-14, 4-
11 Pac-10) got back on the win
ning track on Tuesday, snapping
a three-game losing streak with
two non-conference wins against
Saint Mary's.
Sweeping the double-header
served as a good opportunity for
Stanford to regain confidence be
fore it takes off fora big Pac-10
weekend in Arizona.
Tuesday evening, Stanford's
bats burst out of their slump in an
attack led by junior second base
man Kira Ching. Ching took her
cleanup position in the lineup se
riously when she knocked two
balls out of the park and ended
the day 5 for 7 with four runs
scored and seven RBI.

The entire (lardinal offense con
tributed to the victories across the
Bay, and the consistent Stanford
pitching staff performed as usual,
closing out both games without al
lowing a single run.
If the Cardinal can continue to
attack on both the offensive and de
fensive ends this weekend, No. 2
Arizona (45-7, and No. 4 Ari
zona State (158-14, 8-7) had better
be prepared.
I he Wildcats and Sun Devils are
all too familiar to the Stanford soft
ball squad. Both teams were on the
Farm just a few weeks ago in a Pac
-10 series that did not end well for

the Cardinal.
Friday evening's single game
against the Sun Devils will be Stan
ford's last chance to take a game
from Arizona State in the regular
conference season.
When the Sun Devils traveled to
Stanford for a pair of games two
weeks ago, they claimed the first
game 4-0. The second faceoff was
the sixth Pac-10 game that Stan
ford lost by one run. Arizona State
left Stanford scoreless in the series
with a 1-0 win.
The tough loss will serve to in
spire the Cardinal on its journey
down to Tempe, where it will at

tempt to continue the winning
track it began in Tuesday's dou
ble-header.
After Stanford seeks revenge
from the Sun Devils, it will travel
to Wildcat country for two
matchups against the second
ranked Wildcats.
The two teams have played each
other only once this year — on Apr.
19 at Stanford — and the game was
a close one.
