Don't you hate the media's use ol rhetor
ical, closed-ended questions? Do you
ever find yourself sitting in front of the
television wondering why this re
porter is getting paid truckloads of money to ask
obvious questions to which everyone already
know the answer?
I cannot recall one time when I learned some
new, interesting tidbit of information by watch
ing a post-game interview. Every time, the re
porter asks the same questions about the role of
the crowd, the performance of some star ath
lete's teammates, the chances for continued suc
cess of a team following a big win.
So every time I see one of these sideline re
porters gearing up for yet another contrived in
terview, I try to drift away and imagine that the
interview goes a little something like this:
Reporter: So tell me, how vital was the having
the home court to winning this game today?
Player: It wasn't a factor whatsoever. Our fans
are probably the worst in the league. They cheer
louder for the hot dog guy than they do for us.
That's probably because they have to live in this
sinkhole of a town and sit in this disgusting stadi-

um next to some beer-guzzling
JoeSchmoeall day. I really can't
wait until we get out of this hell
hole and go back to the Garden
for game four. I love New York.
I wish I played for New York.
R: Do you think there is any
way this team would be able to
succeed without the contribu
tions from the role players?

P: Absolutely, there's a reason why they're
called role players: their role isn't very big. This
team succeeds mainly because I'm carrying their
sorry asses night-in and nigln-out. I'm clearly the
backbone of this team. That's why I have the
eight-figure salary and the endorsement deals.
R: It seemed to me that you played with a lot
of pride and heart out there today.
I': It's funny that you say that, because I played
with about as much pride as an anorexic her
maphrodite contemplating suicide. For me it was
all about the money. The whole game all I could
think about was that huge check waiting for me
and which nudie bar I was gonna spend it at.
R: Do you think vour team has a chance to win

the next game and further prolong the series?
P: Not a chance. This was a total fluke. I mean
the stars must have been in perfect alignment
today for us to beat that team. There is no way
that will ever happen again. The way I see it, this
series is just filler, kinda like those scenes in
porno movies used to advance the plot between
sex scenes. We're just around until it's time for
the people to get to see what they really paid the
big bucks for. The smart money ... hell, my
money is on the other team.
R: I hear you sat in the war room during the
draft. How do you feel about the quality of play
ers your team selected?
P: To tell you the truth, it got pretty ugly in
there. I don't think we picked up a single player
that will significantly impact our roster. I'd be
surprised if any of our top three picks are around
long enough to realize that management is a
group of impotent bean-counters and that the
fans are barely one evolutionary step up from
the sloth. Man, what a bunch of losers.
R: You've had some run-ins with the law.


Ryan Stewart
Have you put all of your troubles be
hind you?
P: Are you kidding? The one thing I
learned about getting in trouble is that
athletes can get away with murder. Liter
ally, murder. And now I'm about to sign a
huge contract extension and become ana

t i<>nal celebrity. I ve already made plans to
take that signing bonus and blow it all on
weed and another Rolls. I'm (airly confi
dent when I say that the best of my trou
bles are squarely in front of me.
While this may not be the most diplo
matically correct set of aspirations, I con
tinue to dream that one of these days,
stupid questions will begin receiving the
kind of properly stupid answers they so
readily deserve.
The dumbification (and ves, dumbifica

tion is a perfectly cromulent word) of our
sports genre has thus far been way too one
sided in favor of the media. Only in my
mostinspired imaginations can 1 conceive
of the day when athletes and coaches stoop
down and truly lower themselves under
the bar that the reporters have created.

and he thinks that Hill I Valton is the -worst mistake
in network televisimi history right after The Vino.
