# Sophomore rides into National Horse Show
## 
### MEGHANN SCHROERS 
For I he second year in a row,
the Stanford equestrian team is
sending one of its team members
to the Intercollegiate National
1 lorse Show.
Sophomore Kim Carlson will
be competing in the Individual
Walk-Trot Equitation division
against 1 1 other riders from
across the country.
Stanford's equestrian team
competes in the Intercollegiate
Horse Show Association, an orga
nization designed to make the ex
pensive world of equestrian
sports more accessible to college
students. The association offers
intercollegiate competition to rid
ers of all experience levels in both
English and Western disciplines.
Instead of each rider being re
sponsible for preparing, trans
porting and financially support
ing the horse that she brings to a
show, a host school is responsible
for supplying sufficient mounts
for its show.
Prior to their class's competi
tion, riders draw numbers and
are assigned horses. They are
then are expected to climb on
these foreign animals and ride
them flawlessly, either over

jumps or on the ground, without
the benefit of a warm-up period.
When Carlson tried out for the
equestrian team in the fall of her
freshman year, she had hardly
any experience with horses.
"I really didn't expect to
make the team," she comment
ed. "I was surprised when they
selected me."
At that time, the team lacked a
coach, meaning that all of its
lessons were taught by other team
members on the club's team
owned horses. Carlson's first
lessons were taught by horse
manager lily Swift, who is cur
rently a junior.
When asked to recall her first
year 011 Stanford equestrian
team, Carlson said, "In the be
ginning lessons were really con
fusing, because there was so
much to remember."
She began competing in the
Walk-Trot division in lIISA
shows, riding unknown horses at
a time in which riding itself was a
foreign concept.
"In my first few shows, I spent
most of my time feeling like I was
about to fall off," Carlson said.
Practice — along with the ad
dition of a new coach, Gandice
Muiton, in the 2001-2002 sea
son — has paid off for Garlson.
No longer insecure in the sad
dle, she can ride each of the
team's six horses comfortably,
and is even learning how to
jump in her lessons.
Overall, the equestrian team
has been a positive experience for
Garlson, and she continues to
enjoy the time she spends at Stan
ford's Red Barn, located off Gam
pus Drive West on Electioneer
Road. The barn provides an op
portunity to spend time outside
on a rewarding activity.
Carlson will be accompanied
by Million, a veteran of IHSA
from the University of Findlay, to
the national show, which will be
held at Cazenovia College in
Cazenovia, N.Y., from tomorrow
through Sunday.
"I think this will be a fantastic
experience, and I am honored to
go with Kim," Murton said.
