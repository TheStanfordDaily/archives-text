### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
When sophomore Jeremiah Jackson
joined the Stanford rugby team during
fall quarter, he thought he was joining an
after-school club.
But what he found was a team and
an experience that greatly exceeded his
expectations of what club sports were
like on the Farm. What he found was a
competitive group of guys, committed
to winning.
The Stanford men's rugby team has
taken him farther than he ever dreamed
— trips to Arizona, Sacramento, a spring
break excursion to Fiji and Australia and
now a trip to Virginia Beach, Va., lor the
Division II National Championships on
Saturday against Northern lowa.

I he Cardinal earned a spot in the finals
with a 25-10 win over Salisbury State in
the national semifinals on Apr. 21 in
Arkansas. The day before, Stanford post
ed al9-ll win over Middlebury in the
quarterfinals.
"A trip to the national championships
was the season goal," said junior prop Tony
Gonzalez. "We didn't want to accept any
thing less than that. The morale of the team
is high thus far. We're definitely happy with
our success but we don't want to be content .
We're pretty positive alxmt our chances."
1 his season of Division II competi
tion has been a breath of fresh air to a
Cardinal team that struggled last year
in Division I.
Each year, the last-place team in Divi
sion 1 switches places with the first-place
team in Division 11, which means that

Stanford will have (lie opportunity to re
deem itself alter last year's lackluster per
formance that resulted in its demotion
from the higher division.
"Last year, the team had a rough sea
son with a lot of injuries," saitl Jackson.
"But they always played with Si lot of heart
even though they finished in last place.
But we'll be back in I)-I next year, and we
look forward to that challenge."
For Stanford, however, it is too early to
think about next season 01 redemption,
for that matter. The team knows this one
game is more important than any of that,
and the Cardinal squad isn't taking Satur
day's match lightly.
"We've already watched tape on
Northern lowa twice and we've been
preparing for this game for the last two
weeks in practice," Jackson said.
