# Jim Roll's new CD is on the 'ball'

"What the hell was that?"
This thought ran through my
head more than a few times
after taking a first listen to
Ann Arbor, Mich.-based musi
cian Jim Roll's latest release,
"Inhabiting the Ball." While
artists often talk about break-

Jim Roll Ap.
"Inhabiting the
Telegraph Media

ing boundaries or experimenting with various musical
forms, Roll walks the walk. None of the 13 tracks on "In
habiting" sound anything like the others, and Roll moves
effortlessly and successfully between such disparate genres
as country,, electronica, folk, bluegrass and pop. Only
gangsta rap seems to be neglected by Roll â€” maybe next
album. The overall result of this musical hodgepodge is a
disc that is at times disconcerting and difficult to listen to,
but always interesting and usually quite enjoyable.
The songwriting on "Inhabiting" is as schizophrenic as
the music, the result of Roll's collaboration with a couple
of noted novelists in writing lyrics for his compositions.
Roll wrote five of the tracks on the disc, while Denis John-

son, best known as the author of "Jesus'
Son," wrote another five. Rick Moody,

author of "The Ice Storm," pitched
in with three. There are noticeable
differences between the three writ
ers' styles, with Roll adopting more
of a storyteller's tone in his writing,
Johnson opting for the more ab
stract, and Moody choosing the

completely abstruse and unintelligi
ble. Consider this crap from Moody's
"Killjoy," which looks like a bad William
Carlos Williams poem and sounds even
worse: "Farm stand / Upstate / Farm
stand / The rain never ends / The roofs
got the bends."

Killjoy excluded, the disc has a number of wonderful
lyrical and musical moments, particularly the bluegrassy
"Kicking at the Traces" and the heartstring-tugging bal
lad, "Eddie Rode the Orphan Train," both written by Roll.
"Eddie" is probably the highlight of the disc, with Roll
using a banjo and accordion to tell the depressing true-life
story of an early 20th century train that attempted to find

families for orphaned children.
"Eddie Rode the Orphan Train from
Solio down to Arkansas /And every
stop along the way they made him
stand against the wall / The train he
rode it had no plan, no families wait
ing on the way / Just town to town the
train rolled in and tried to give a child
away." Great songwriting in the "so
sad it makes you want to slit your
wrist" mold.
Roll's latest release has been re
ceiving some critical acclaim recently,
mostly due to its somewhat unique
linkage of novelists and musicians, but
such praise misses the point. In truth,

the writings of Johnson and Moody are some of the lower
points of the disc, and it is Roll's writing and his sense of
musical risk-taking that makes the disc worth a listen. "In
habiting the Ball" is genre-bending bliss, an album that is
both impossible to classify and impossible to ignore. After
a few more listens, I have come to realize what the hell that
was: one of the first great albums of 2002.
