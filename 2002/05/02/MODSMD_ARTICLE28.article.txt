Music for hair-gel users and
clear-liquor drinkers, Phantom
Planet's new record, "The
Guest," resonates catchy
melodies and clean, head-bop
ping pop-rock.
Although band members
maintain that the group has

matured infinitely beyond its last album, "The
Guest" still isn't quite there. The record has Califor
nia pop and refreshing youth, but "The Guest" re
lies heavily on its influences and leaves ample room
for improvement. Even so, this record reflects a pas
sionate, devoted and semi-satiric band, and is worth
buying.
Each of'The Guest" 's 12 tracks linger in your head
equally long and, if isolated, as on a car radio, may
prompt drivers to head straight for the nearest Virgin
Megastore. However, lead singer Alex Greenwald's in
consistent singing and the obvious Radiohead and
Elvis Costello borrowing make the collection of songs
simply average.
For example, listeners will sing "California, here we
come / Right back where we started from", the chorus
from the alburn's opening track and first single, well
into tomorrow. But, on "California," lead singer Alex
Greenwald sounds like a hybrid of Julian Casablancas,
of the Strokes, and Costello without the former's irrev
erence and the latter's attitude. So instead of capturing
the influences' cool, Phantom Planet sounds cute —
which isn't necessarily bad.

Greenwald's pretty-boy croon
ing on "California" transitions to
well short of bad-ass on "In Our
Darkest Hour." Even ignoring
Greenewald's vocals, this song still
fails to reach its potential. The
track could have achieved White
Stripes-level rock but instead re
mains impeccably produced pop.
"Iliat said, this song, like the entire
album, is difficult to resist.

guitar sound and active drumming absent from the
other tracks. Here, Greenwald, the band's main song-

writer, sacrifices his apparent desire to
score a movie soundtrack and pens a sim
ple but delightful pop tune. This song's
choral harmony may mark "The Guest"
's finest moment.
Track nine, "All Over Again," rips
off "My Aim is True"-era Elvis Costello so
blatantly that the song surpasses homage

and could warrant a copyright lawsuit. However, if
Phantom Planet's audience thinks Elvis Costello is just
that guy in "200 Cigarettes," then "All Over Again" will
be the best song any of them has ever heard.
Out on Epic Records, "The Guest" stands as
Phantom Planet's second release and boasts two im
pressive producers. Without a doubt, Mitchell
Froom (Costello, Tom Waits, Paul McCartney) and
Tchad Blake (Pearl Jam, Sheryl Crow) orchestrated
"The Guest'"s spotless sound and developed the
band's radio-friendly pop. Without them, the mem
bers of this band certainly would have long since re
turned to their day jobs — which for the drummer
may be quite appealing.
Jason Schwartzman, a.k.a. "Rushmore" 's Max
Fischer, keeps the beat while plugging the group in
just about every interview. With his help, Phantom
Planet has become somewhat of a media darling.
After performances on both Conan and Kilborne,
the band appeared in Rolling Stone and Spin, and
MTVers selected the video for "California" as this
week's viewer's choice.
Though the publicity will help the group sell

records, the exposure will
never turn a mediocre
album into a classic. Mow
ever, what "The Guest"
lacks in quality, it more
than compensates for in
fun and youth. Phantom
Planet may indeed be
come the next big tiling,
and if the band's next
album improves upon
"The Guest" as much as
this record improved
upon the first, then the fu
ture bodes well.


Binge drinking is dangerous.
