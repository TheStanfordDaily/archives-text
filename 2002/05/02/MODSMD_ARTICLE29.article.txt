# Dishwalla overcomes one-hit wonder status
## 
### SERENA LAUREN BLODGER 
If you think you've never heard of
Dishwalla, chances are you've heard its
music. Remember that song "Count
ing Blue Cars" from a few years back?
No, you say? You know thafone song
with the catchy melodic chorus, " fell
me all your thoughts on God / 'Cause
I'd really like to meet her/Tell me all

Dishwalla
"Opaline"
Immergent
Records

your thoughts on God / 'Cause I'm on my way to see her,"? Ohhhhh,
that Dishwalla.
If the first tiling that comes to mind is "one-hit wonder," you're in for
a surprise. It turns out A 8c M, the record label that released Dishwalla's
debut album "Pet Your Friends," suffered turbulence that caused Dish
walla's follow-up album "And You Think You Know What Life's About"
to lose promotional funding. Dishwalla stuck it out lor a time, until In
terscope records, a sub-label it was forced to join, dropped the band
completely.
Now, Dishwalla is back with a third album, "Opaline," under a new
label, and the band is stronger than ever. The band was lucky enough
to get signed by Mark Mazzetti of the independent label Immergent
Records. He offered the band an incredible 50-50 split of all royalties
and profits — a deal almost unheard of in the music industry.

Dish walla's journey, from the debut of their hit song "Counting
Blue Cars" off an album which sold over one million copies, to gett ing
dropped from Interscope records, to getting signed by an indie label,
has landed it in an ideal situation — with a great record deal and a
great record.


Nice shades, dude
While "Opaline" is ail album to be praised, first impres
sions might deceive. "Opaline" introduces the 11-track
album with very sound Latin-rock instrumentals. However,
the lyrics are repetitive and the shallow sound of the vocals
doesn't help.
Fortunately for Dish walla, the album's title track is just as
deceiving as the song title "Counting Blue Cars." The rest of
the album, from track two until 11, is filled with interesting
and emotional melodies, varied rhythms, well orchestrated

instruments parts, and chilling lyrics.
In "Angels or Devils," Richards sings in his higher, more
dynamic register: "This is the last time that I'm ever gonna
come here tonight / This is the last time — 1 will fall / Into a
place that fails us all, inside /1 can see the pain in you /1 can
see the love in you / But fighting all the demons will take time
/ It will take time / The angels they burn inside for us / Are we
ever / Are we ever gonna learn to fly?"
"Somewhere in the Middle," the album's well-crafted sin
gle, is currently the second most added song at Rock Radio,
and rightly so. The song is passionate and powerful, while the
lyrics are poignant and vague, ready to grab listeners right
where they are: "Tripping hard falling down on the ground

/Cause I can't stand up/And I can't fall down/Cause I'm
somewhere in the middle of this."
Other stand-out tracks are "Home," "Madlife," "Candle
burn" and "Nashville Skyline." On top of Richard's strong
lyrics, these songs have a good deal more variation in instru
mental and vocal dynamic than the others. "Mad Life" and
"Nashville Skyline" are possibly the most passionate, crash
ing songs on "Opaline," while "Candleburn" is mainly a bal
lad with strong piano and drum parts.
In general, Dishwalla has a put-together, well-polished
sound that is sure to grow even strong by its fourth album.
Luckily, "Opaline" is definitely what the band needs to cata
pult itself back into the mainstream market.
