# Dishwalla overcomes one-hit wonder status

### SERENA LAUREN BLODGER 
If you think you've never heard of
Dishwalla, chances are you've heard its
music. Remember that song "Count
ing Blue Cars" from a few years back?
No, you say? You know thafone song
with the catchy melodic chorus, " fell
me all your thoughts on God / 'Cause
I'd really like to meet her/Tell me all

Dishwalla
"Opaline"
Immergent
Records

your thoughts on God / 'Cause I'm on my way to see her,"? Ohhhhh,
that Dishwalla.
If the first tiling that comes to mind is "one-hit wonder," you're in for
a surprise. It turns out A 8c M, the record label that released Dishwalla's
debut album "Pet Your Friends," suffered turbulence that caused Dish
walla's follow-up album "And You Think You Know What Life's About"
to lose promotional funding. Dishwalla stuck it out lor a time, until In
terscope records, a sub-label it was forced to join, dropped the band
completely.
Now, Dishwalla is back with a third album, "Opaline," under a new
label, and the band is stronger than ever. The band was lucky enough
to get signed by Mark Mazzetti of the independent label Immergent
Records. He offered the band an incredible 50-50 split of all royalties
and profits — a deal almost unheard of in the music industry.

Dish walla's journey, from the debut of their hit song "Counting
Blue Cars" off an album which sold over one million copies, to gett ing
dropped from Interscope records, to getting signed by an indie label,
has landed it in an ideal situation — with a great record deal and a
great record.


Nice shades, dude
