### CYNTHIA CHO EDITORIAL STAFF 
In celebration of Asian / Pacific
Islander Heritage Month, the
Asian American Activities Center is
hosting an evening with comedian
Tina Kim tonight at 7:30 p.m. in
Tresidder Union Oak Room West.
Tomorrow, Okada and the
Stanford Concert Network will
host "Open Mic Night: An
Evening of Diverse Expression"
from 8 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. at the
Coffee House. Also, on Saturday,
Hwimori, a cultural activist group
that performs traditional Korean
drumming and dance, hosts "Ris
ing from the Ashes: Ten Years
after the Los Angeles Riots," at
6:30 p.m. in the l residder Union
Oak Room. Talisman and Jam
Pac'd will also perform.
"API Heritage month is an im
portant celebration of Asians in
America," said Richard Yuen, as
sistant dean of students and direc
tor of the Asian American Activities
Center. "Jimmy Carter first pro
posed a week of celebration during
his presidential term and now it
has grown to a month," he said.
Senior Terry Lin, the cultural

programming director of the cen
ter, who was involved in planning
l ina Kim's visit, felt that Kim could
"educate the people of Stanford
about the Asian-American commu
nity and its dynamism and diversi
ty and break stereotypes about who
Asian Americans are and what ca
reers they are involved in."
And since it is a comedy show,
Lin hopes that it will be "a chance
for Asian Americans to laugh at
themselves and find humor in our
common experiences."
The eveni is open to everyone,
she said.
Tina Kim has appeared on
MTV, CNN, and CBS, among
other major networks, and has
produced her own sold-out stand
up comedy show in New York
City. She was also the executive
producer of the first Asian Ameri
can Comedy Festival.
"Open Mic Night" is designed
to provide a space where stu
dents can voice themselves and
be heard, according to Susan
Lee, one of Okada's ethnic
theme associates.
Though the event is in celebra
tion of API Heritage Month, stu
dents of many racial and cultural

backgrounds are scheduled to per
form tomorrow night.
"The focus of the event is to pro
mote cross-cultural communica
tion in spirit of API Heritage
Month," Lee said.
Hwimori will seek to do the
same through its Saturday night
performance.
Traditionally, Hwimori's an
nual spring show is focused

around a theme that is relevant
to Korean or Korean-American
communities.
"Since it is the 10th anniversary
of the [Los Angeles] Riots, in which
a disproportionate amount of the
property damage was borne by
Korean Americans, we feel that it is
our place to bring the commemo
