In celebration of Asian / Pacific
Islander Heritage Month, the
Asian American Activities Center is
hosting an evening with comedian
Tina Kim tonight at 7:30 p.m. in
Tresidder Union Oak Room West.
Tomorrow, Okada and the

ing from the Ashes: Ten Years
after the Los Angeles Riots," at
6:30 p.m. in the l residder Union
Oak Room. Talisman and Jam
Pac'd will also perform.
"API Heritage month is an im
portant celebration of Asians in
America," said Richard Yuen, as
sistant dean of students and direc
tor of the Asian American Activities
Center. "Jimmy Carter first pro
posed a week of celebration during
his presidential term and now it
has grown to a month," he said.
Senior Terry Lin, the cultural

programming director of the cen
ter, who was involved in planning
l ina Kim's visit, felt that Kim could
"educate the people of Stanford
about the Asian-American commu
nity and its dynamism and diversi
ty and break stereotypes about who
Asian Americans are and what ca
reers they are involved in."
And since it is a comedy show,
Lin hopes that it will be "a chance
for Asian Americans to laugh at
themselves and find humor in our
common experiences."
The eveni is open to everyone,
she said.
Tina Kim has appeared on
MTV, CNN, and CBS, among
other major networks, and has
produced her own sold-out stand
up comedy show in New York
City. She was also the executive
producer of the first Asian Ameri
can Comedy Festival.
"Open Mic Night" is designed
to provide a space where stu
dents can voice themselves and
be heard, according to Susan
Lee, one of Okada's ethnic
theme associates.
Though the event is in celebra
tion of API Heritage Month, stu
dents of many racial and cultural

backgrounds are scheduled to per
form tomorrow night.
"The focus of the event is to pro
mote cross-cultural communica
tion in spirit of API Heritage
Month," Lee said.
Hwimori will seek to do the
same through its Saturday night
performance.
Traditionally, Hwimori's an
nual spring show is focused

around a theme that is relevant
to Korean or Korean-American
communities.
"Since it is the 10th anniversary
of the [Los Angeles] Riots, in which
a disproportionate amount of the
property damage was borne by
Korean Americans, we feel that it is
our place to bring the commemo

ration ol the riots to Stanford cam
pus," said senior Ravi Faiia, chair
of Hwimori.
"We think it is important to re
member the riots as an example ol
(he negative consequences of mi
nority communities in conflict.
From this, we are motivated to
find ways, such as artistic ex
change across communities, to
create solidarity where tensions
exist," he said.
Graduate student Julie Park, a
member of the performance
group, said, "In addition to being
performers, we also consider our
selves cultural activists interested
in social awareness."
Hwimori will showcase the
unique aspects of Korean-
American culture while Talis
man and Jam Pac'd were select
ed to perform as representatives
of African-American perfor
mance art on campus, according
to Faiia.
"African-American and Kore
an-American relations became a
salient issue after the riots and it is
these two communities that we
wish to highlight in our show,"

Faiia said.
In addition to the perfor
mances, Nadinne Cruz, the di
rector of the Haas Center for
Public Service, will speak on the
role of art and artistic expres
sion in community building and
service. Afterward, there will be
a small reception at which Kore
an refreshments and snacks will
be served.
On May 18, the Asian American
Students Association will hold its
annual fashion show. According to
AASA Chair Bryan Kim, a sopho
more, the fashion show is a chance
for Asian-American designers to
showcase their work.
On the May 23, AASA, in
partnership with the publica
tion Asian Week and the Asian
American Activities Center, will
bring three API musical per
formers fora noontime concert
in White Plaza.
"There are many events and ac
tivities planned for this month,"
said Kim. "This is a great time to
explore the diversity and unique
ness of our community," he said.
Cindy Ng, assistant director of
the activities center shared Kim's
feelings. "API Heritage Month is
an opportunity to rediscover, cele
brate and share our cultural her
itage," she said.

be heard, according to Susan
Lee, one of Okada's ethnic
theme associates.
Though the event is in celebra

to Korean or Korean-American
communities.

of Hwimori.
"We think it is important to re
member the riots as an example ol

nority communities in conflict.
From this, we are motivated to
find ways, such as artistic ex
change across communities, to
create solidarity where tensions
exist," he said.
Graduate student Julie Park, a
member of the performance
group, said, "In addition to being
performers, we also consider our
selves cultural activists interested
in social awareness."
Hwimori will showcase the
unique aspects of Korean-
American culture while Talis

these two communities that we
wish to highlight in our show,"

Faiia said.

service. Afterward, there will be
