# Deconstruct 'Derrida' and he'll deconstruct your film

### KIM SAMEK 
Directors Amy /til
ing Kofinan and Kirby
Dick undertook an ambi
tions task in making the
film "Derrida." A docu
mentary/art film about
the internationally known
French philosopher and
jDei I laps one of the greatest
thinkers alive today, "Der
rida" captures the intrica
cies of his thought while

provicling a work accessible to a general audience.
Kofinan, a first-time filmmaker and former student of
Denida's at Yale, structures the film to present formal in
terviews with Jacques Derrida (in French and English) in
terspersed with voice-overs reading passages from his work.
Even once in awhile, we are given a glimpse of his private
life or his cheeky side. He is a lovable character, oftei 1 joking
about the camera crew that has followed him for roughly
five years.
The directors also splice in segments of television inter
views Derrida has conducted— the most memorable oc
curs when a reporter asks Denida what he thinks of the de
constructionism and irony present in the television sitcom
"Seinfeld." I lie camera shows Derrida with a blank face as
the reporter rephrases her question. He then answers,
somewhat playfully yet sincere, "No, the deconstruction of
which I speak is not in sitcoms. People who watch sitcoms
should lie reading books." Kofinan and Dick successfully
capture his charming and contemplative personality. These
humorous moments are some of the film's best.
The intellectual aspects of the film, however, fail to live up
to the almost impossibly high expectations of capturing a
great mind. Kofinan and Dick choose to explore die nature
of biography as well as present and celebrate the way in
which a great thinker thinks. Almost immediately, the audi
ence is made aware that the film isjust that — a film. Deni-

da points out that the film is
more representative of the di
rector than of himself.
He refers to it as their autobi
ography. For this reason Kof
man chooses to use her own
voice to read passages from his
work. Though the voice overs

are intended to contribute to the meta-narrative tlieme of

the documentary as well as to juxta
pose his work with images of his pri
vate life, they ct >me acrc iss as over-dra

won't talk about how he fell for his wife other than the most
basic facts, but I fail to see what insights these lend us into his
thinking. ()ne of the most annoying moments occurs when
Kofinan asks him to speak about the origin of deconstruc
tion, the mode of thinking he is famous for. He begins to an
swer, but she dubs over him reading a passage of his work.
Ihe viewer is never allowed to forget that "Derrida" is a
film. As the directors ask Derrida to speak about his private
life, he explains that what he says is not natural. He tells us
normally he would not get dressed if he spends the day at
home tolx'gin with. The concept is intriguing: try to make a
documentary about a philosopher and he'll reflect on what
it means to make a'documentary.
The self-referential aspects of die film are clever in cap
turing Derrick's thought but often seem over the top. For
example, the film shows Derrida watchinga video ofhimself
being interviewed. There are > shots ii 1 which he is filmed
in front of a mirror so that the audience can see the camera
filming him. Such heavy-handed moments are distracting.
A subtler and more successful self-referential moment oc
curs when Kofinan asks him to speak about the story of Echo
and Narcissus. The documentary, of course, Is his Echo.
Along wttli the directors, Jacques Derrida was present at
Saturday's screening of the film at the 45 th San Francisco In
ternational Film Festival. Hcnvas in town speaking at a three
day conference on capital punishment here at Stanford.
One cannot help but wonder how he feels about the por
trayal of his life and thought. When asked at the question
and-answer session following the movie, he said that lie had
hoped the film would transgress the standards of normal
documentary film and that he thought in some ways it ac
complished this goal.

Regardless of its flaws, "Derri
da" Ls a film to see, and not simply for
the fresh experience of watching a film
on the life of a philosopher. To the ex
tent that it captures his personality
beantiliilly, we are given the unique
experience of knowing the man lx>-
hind the words.
