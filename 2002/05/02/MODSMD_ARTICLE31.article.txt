# The 						ultimate 'Kiss'

### JASON ROSENSWEIG 
Cabriele Muccino's'Tlre List Kiss (L'Ultimo Bario)"
delves into, and out of, those achingly difficult periods in ro
mantic relationships when we must confront our imperfec
tions and inability to live up to impossible ideals. Mncrino's
third film comes to the 45th San Francisco International
Film Festival arming tire World (inenia Audience Award
from the Sundance Film Festival.
Through a group of five Italian guys nearing 30, we

see five iterations of a romantic relationship: C Carlo's girlfriend, (liulia. is
pregnant, but they are not engaged; Antonk > is married wit ha one-year
old son; Marco is currently on his third marriage; Paolo is struggling, im
potently, to get past a long relationship; and Mario Lsa quasi-apathetic he
donist enjoying regular sex with different and varied beautiful women.
Also thrown into the mix is one set of struggling parents and an 18-
year-old enchantress, Francesca (Martina Stella), who throws magic
spicy dust into Carlo's stew of anxieties.
"lire films mastery lies in its surprising and refreshing ability to rise
above genres; it is comic, tragic, dramatic and entertaining all at once.
Perhaps catering initially to Italian tastes, "The Last Kiss" isn't held back
by a need to satisfy one specific audience.
Without the overall neatness that often accompanies categorization,
Muccino can, in a sense, allow die characters to fiill into situations in
which they must speak for themselves. Each ofthe men and women, de
spite fitting into a classic personality type, retains the fuzziness of real life.
Muccino gives few opportunities for us to judge a character, either gen
erally or with regard to a specific action. We are, rather, required to ac
cept them with a certain sympathy and ambivalence, appreciating tire
difficulty of their positions and also their imperfect selves.
With that wonderful European knack for aphorisms and abstrac
tionisms, everyone tries to make some sense of their life and develop a
plan of action for the future: "We're only t<x) late after we're dead, re
member," "If you really wanted to, we [our relationship] could be better
than before" or "Normality is the true revolution." These statements in
no way add up to a system or a philosophy presented by the film, airy
character, or Muccino. But they do express the vast lake of competing
forces ;uid motivations that we swim and drown in.
lire film'scharacters are also pleasantly universal; despite the age gap
between C iiuilia and Carlo and a few other unavclidable nranneristic dif
ferences, ;dl the characters in tire movie can be found in New York, Ix>s
.Angeles, Chicago or San Francisco; tlris makes fora powerful, even up
lifting, sense of the fluidity ofcul-

tural boundaries and the cinema's
ability to cross them.
No screenings remain at die ies
tiviil this year, but due to its success
at Sundance, and perhaps further
success here, it is sure to roll around
into theatres later tliis year.
