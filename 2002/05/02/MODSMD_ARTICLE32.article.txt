# Ira Glass and Terry Gross revitalize NPR
## 
### MICHAEL BAER 
Most people, upon the men
tion of public radio, think of
voices droning on about the
great topics of the day in nause
ating detail. This is a medium
whose most famous entertainers
are the somnolent Garrison
Keillor and the hyperactive
hosts of "Car Talk," corny hu
morists who seem quite out of
step with what most Americans
think of as comedy.
Tune in to "This American
Life," however, and you'll hear
stories of, to quote the title of its
double-CD compilation, "Lies,
Sissies and Fiascoes," of the ex
traordinary events and the or
dinary yet overlooked details of

everyday life in these United States. Hosted
for its seven years by Ira Glass, "This Ameri

can Life" never fails to surprise and mes
merize. Along with "The Simpsons" and

"The West Wing," it is a week
ly program I make a point
never to miss.
Terry Gross also probes
into the overlooked and extra
ordinary in her show, "Fresh
Air." For 27 years and count
ing, "Fresh Air" has been a
celebrity interview show with a
National Public Radio twist:
Terry Gross actually prepares
for the interviews. With a daily
regimen of looking over the
works of the artist or commen
tator to be interviewed, she ex
plores the topics most of inter
est to both neophyte and fan
alike. With a knowledge of her

subjects' previous interviews,
she tries to find the novel question that pro
vides itisight into the artist, one that has an an

swer that will keep listeners in their cars long
after they have reached their intended desti
nations.
These Peabody Award-winning giants of
public radio have interviewed each other in
the past, but their recent appearance at Stan
ford, presented by Stanford Lively Arts,
marks their first joint interview and public
conversation. They answered questions asked
both by former Wired editor Katrina Heron
and by audience members, including Inter
mission. It was an interesting and occasional
ly uproarious night; they discussed Howard
Stern's radio show, dissed Kiss frontman
Gene Simmons and recalled the time Monica
Lewinsky walked out of an interview because
Gross dared to challenge her on some of the
more delicate details of her book..
Of course, after Sept. 11, both shows
sobered up a bit, facing the challenge of in
specting a changed world and informing the
public via culture (Gross' department) and
personal detail (Glass'). In an audience ques

tion-and-answer session after the interview, I
asked Glass and Gross about this.
The hostess of "Fresh Air" responded that
the greatest challenge in a time ofchange is to
try to see what niche one can lit into that's dif
ferent from others. "What we try to do is go to
the great explainers of the world, try to find
the best journalist to explain what it is that we
need to know to understand what's happen
ing. We invited poets and singer-songwriters
who were trying to find words and music to
express the powerful emotions that we were
feeling. [But] there's all these awful CDs â€”
everybody's churning out either their patriot
ic anthem or 'what Sept. 11 means to me.'
There was so much really bad art being made
in the name of Sept. 11. So you want to find
the music that you can stand behind and say
this is worth listening to."
Glass, on the other hand, felt the format of
"This American Life" allowed its staff to find


Speak into the microphone,
don't eat it!
