When you think of film
festivals, you might think of
Cannes or Sundance.
Maybe, giving (Canadians the
benefit of the doubt, you
think of Toronto. But cer
tainly not San Francisco. Yet
San Francisco lias a healthy,

"

45-year-old festival that is able to draw entries
from around the world.
The festival ended yesterday after two weeks
of assorted features, shorts and documentaries.
There was also a healthy dosage of celebrity ass
kissing, as both Warren Beatty and Kevin
Spacey were on hand to charm tans and be
awarded the two big annual awards for lifetime
achievements. (E.H.)

"l 3 Conversations About One Thing"
Opening the festival was Jill Sprecher's "13
Conversations About One Thing," a somber
l(H)k at interwoven lives in New York City. And
no, the director said, the "One Thing" is not sex.
Without a hint of embarrassment, the director
said the "One Thing" was "happiness — how
we get it, how we earn it."
"Hie strength of the film lies in a few of the
performances (most notably the stony Alan
Arkin and the thoughtful Clea Duvall) and in its
freshly conceived and carefully cut chronology.
In this way, it is like sanitized "Pulp Fiction."
Every once in a while, someone swears, and we
do get a bunch of lurid red stains on white
sheets-very symbolic and very titillating — but I
would've preferred a little sex and violence.
The dialogue is over-earnest at times, but
still, in the end, manages to move rather than
disaffect. "13 Conversations" challenges you to
take risks, to continue striving for human con
nection amid urban anonymity. It is the sort of
movie that spurs you to reach out and put your
arm around the shoulder of your date. (E.H.)
"CQ"
Here are some basic things to keep in mind
when watching the less-than-pleasing "CQ":
1. It is a movie within a movie.
2. The movie that was being made within the
movie was the most enjoyable part of the movie.
3. ITie ratio of "movie-within-a-movie" to
"movie-movie" was extremely low.
Giving a speech before the movie, first-time
director Roman Coppola (Francis Ford's boy)
said that "CQ" was a "valentine to films." I don't
quite believe that. Perhaps he meant for it to be,

but it seemed more like a valentine to preten
tious filmmaker-wannabe guys who don't pay
any attention to their girlfriends.
The main story of the film was promising,
but uninterestingly executed: a young .Ameri
can in Paris who wants to make a "real" film is
given the job of director for the film "Dragon-

fly," a nice combination of
"Barbarella" and any James
Bond Hick. It was glacially
slow, and the lead character
was a simpering dork.
"Dragonfly," the movie
within the movie, rocked the
house. Watching "CQ," 1

found myself wishing for more interludes in
which they showed scenes from the movie in
progress. Dragonfly (supermodel Angela
Lindvall) does not have to do anything but ■
look lankily gorgeous in that special '60s way.
There are also great scenes on the imx)n com
plete with slo-mo running, where rebels train,
led by the hilariously Castro-esque leader Mr. E
(Billy Zane).
"CQ" at least shows off Roman Coppola's
great stylistic eye and some potential, so his pa
won't have to slap him upside the head for pro
ducing it. (A.K.)

"Smokers Only"
Hie l>est movie at the festival, in my opinion,
was "Smokers Only," an Argentinean film from
Veronica Chen. Atmospheric and abstract, it fo
cuses on the essential loneliness of life, and in
particular, life in Buenos Aires for two young
lovers. Shot mostly in the lugubrious and
moody blue tones of night, the movie is a sexu
al dreamscape that is both frank and sensuous.
The camera alternates between jazzy, jarring
subjectivity and peaceful tableaus, just as Reni,
the female protagonist, finally trades the claus
trophobia of the city, and her relationship, for
the still sunshine of the countryside. (E.H.)
"Spirited Away"
"Spirited Away" is one of the best movies I
have seen in a long time. It is beautiful and

imaginative, and moreover, there was a gigan
tic, fat baby in it. Director Hayao Miyazaki is
known as the foremost great granddaddy ani
mation director in Japan, with artistic and com
mercial successes such as "Laputa: (Castle in the
Sky," "My Neighbor Totoro" and "Princess
Mononoke." Because I haven't seen any of his
other films I can't say things like "He's done it
again!" or "Best ever!" However, I would like
to reiterate: it was frikkin' fantastic.
"Spirited Away" tells the story ofa young girl
named Chihiro who is transported into a
mythical world and must work at a bathhouse
of the gods to save her parents. It feels person
al yet epic. Chihiro must be brave and re
sourceful in order to save her parents and ap
pease Yubaba (the huge-headed sorceress in
charge of the place), and she must also adapt to
her new world. Some other themes: the im
portance of words, evil as a balancing force in
the world, man and environmental destruc
tion. These are not hammered home, but sub
tly integrated into the story, which I greatly ap
preciated.
. I also cried so hard I almost peed my pants.
It was that gocxl. Along with the involving
story, "Spirited Away" featured wonderful im
agery and animation. In addition to the afore
mentioned giant baby, there were also giant
chick gods, mollusk gods and a dragon.
Miyazaki, bless his heart, is a cranky old tradi
tionalist who likes his animation hand-drawn.
Although "Spirited Away" uses computer ani
mation non-invasively in the film, much credit
should also be given to the animators ofStudio
Ghibli who cramp their hands and give them
selves bad posture to bring you this great, great
film. (A.K.)
"They Came from the Bay"
"They Came from the Bay" was a collection
of six short films by Bay Area filmmakers that,
without a doubt, came from the Bay, in the

same way that the Chronicle could only be pub
lished in San Francisco. Where else could you
get a sp(K)f on shotgun weddings ("Minute
Matrimony") that marries Jews, blacks and gay
Palestinians in a fast-food drive-thru? Where
else could you get a shamelessly sentimental,
one-sided, bleeding-heart documentary
("Dear Judge") about an unjustly convicted
drug trafficker and single mother from rural
Alabama? And where else could you find
"Ulalume," a haunting Poe poem brought to
life in a way so New-Agey that even the Marin
County yoga gurus in the audience were say
ing, "What the hell?"
The three best shorts were in fact the short
est. "Hypocrite" used some innovative camera
work to allow the object of the camera's atten
tion, a young woman, to do violence against the
camera while commenting on the relationship
of media and violence. The fbley artists have a
field day with broken glass sounds as the cam
era Is smashed and flipped, just as the conven
tional roles of the viewer and the viewed are
flipped. "Lucy Tsak Tsak" collects snippets of
film from an unsung heroine of Romanian film
— Lucy, the clapperboard operator who
clapped 459,000 sequences of film into action
— and gives her her three minutes of fame.
"Prayer" cuts between old footage of American
children and devout Muslims at prayer, and the
gentle humility ofit all achieves a new resonance
in light of Sept. 11. (E.H.)
Alice Gushes
Celebrities! That was one of the interesting
and novel features of the festival.
John Lasseter, head of Pixar animation stu
dios, was present for the screening of "Spirited
Away" that 1 attended. But they took the
celebrity behemoths out of cold storage for
"CQ." I am completely sure Francis Ford Cop
pola was there. His Wife definitely was, and be
sides, what would someone who looked just like
Coppola be doing with his arm around her?
That was heart attack number one. 1 leart at
tack number two began when I started to stare
at the man in the row behind Coppola. Aiyaa!
George Lucas! 1 recalled him looking plumper
and juicier so 1 doubted for awhile, but an au
thority on the subject attending the film with me
informed me that it sounded like his voice. 1 saw
that block o' famousness later in Japantown.
Quite heady. (A.K..)
Alice Wraps Things Up
All in all, the San Francisco International
Film Festival, or what 1 experienced of it, was
a nice mix of good movies, celebrities and lines
made up of hipsters and movie dorks. Go
sometime. It'll be fun. Who knows, you might
see the back of George Lucas' newly skinny
head. (A.K.)
