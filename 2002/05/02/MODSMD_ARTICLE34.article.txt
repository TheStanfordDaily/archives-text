Canada, and, wearinga ridiculously
oversized fur-trimmed coat, he bleats into his cell phone, "This is
humiliating! I'm here shooting a deodorant commercial; I've got
two Oscars!"
Playing V;d Wexler, a brilliant but washed-up director des
perately seekii ig a successful comeback, the introduction of Allen
to the plot of "1 lollywood Ending" is characteristic of his role in
die entire film. He is hilariously neurotic, as in most of his work,
but the i ieun Jticisin is also sometimes excessive to the p< >int of ex
asperation. However, this is the classic Woody .Allen that his
diehard fans know and love. What would Allen be without the
stuttering, the psychoanalytic therapy, the paranoia, the jazz
music playing in the background as he argues with his lover?
"Hollywood Ending" is certainly no "Annie Hall," but Allen
holds his own as he brings his delightful character- and narrative
oriented writing to life on the screen without sparing the audi
ence a double helping of the quirky and the ridiculous.
Wexler becomes psychosomatically blind when faced with the
stress of directing a new picture that could give him the big break
that he needs, which is coincidental!) being produced by his ex-

wife Ellie (Tea Leoni) and her fiancee Hal (Treat Williams), the
man for whom she left Val. Rather than coming clean about his

handicap, Wexler caves to desperadt hi and is convinced by
his agent Al (Mark Rydell) that he can still she Kit the picture.
He must, however, have an ally 011 the set who can help
guide him dirough the process but w ill keep the secret up
until his sight eventu.dly returns. And in die meantime,
Wexler is also conflicted about Ellie: he is incredibly bitter

diat she has left him, but grateful that she has talked her
production team into hiring him for the job.
And diis is pretty much die gist of die story. The film plods
along slowly as the conflicts fester, mainly through physical com
edy and the disaster diat will inevitably occur when a blind man
Ls tiding to direct a film among heavy machinery, temperamen
tal actors, and multi-level sets. The story itself is not much more
than it sounds like, and die novelty ofdie idea pretty much wears
off by the end of the film, as does the amusement factor in Allen's
stuttering, self-deprecating style of humor.
However, Allen is fantastic at playing the awkward, pill-pop
ping artistic genius who is constantly putting his foot in his
mouth. Combined with die absurdity of the extraneous charac
ters in the film, the cast becomes an interesting combination diat
is worth watching. The strength for Allen in this film is his script
and liis ability to come up with quirky, ludicrous situations one
feels guilty laughing about but that are hilarious nonetheless.
Characters such as the authoritarian Chinese cameraman, his
eager translator and die unctuous producer's assistant widi a
horrible fake tan add rich color to the picture that only Allen is

capable of dreaming up, and illustrates how well his writing and
casting can work together.
In a different vein, something must be said for die ages of the
women in this film. Allen Ls getting along in his years, yet in the
beginning of the film he is dating Lori, a pretty young thing
played by "Will and Grace" star Debra Messing. It is also some
whatdifficult to stomach the idea that tall, statuesque Tea Leoni's
character could till for this bumbling, stooped-over, bespecta
cled man. And Tiffani Amber Thiessen of "90210" and "Saved
By The Bell" fame makes an attempt to seduce Allen's character,
even flashing him her bra and underwear! The narcissism of
male Hollywood filmmakers and their unrealistic ageism in cast
ing leading ladies is somewhat disturbing. Soon-Yi, what were
you thinking as you watched this?
A redeeming bright spot in the film was Tea Leoni â€” she had
the perfect edgy energy that made her a likeable character with
out being ovevwhelmingly sweet. Certain successful moments
that were beautiful and classically Woody Allen involved her. For
instance, as Val and Ellie argue in a bedixxjni about where their
relationship went wrong as jazz plays ii 1 die background, one can
see the simultaneous beauty and flaw in monogamous relation
ships that Allen attempts to capture on film.
Woody Allen fans should see "I lollywood Ending," if not to
see what he has been up to since his hist film came out, then to ex
perience his quintessenti;il style and narrative focus that is often
lacking in contemporary film. .And while the film does deliver
somewhat of a sentimental Hollywood ending, Woody Allen
persists in personifying all the charms of New York.
