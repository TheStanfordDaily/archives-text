# The 						year is 2455: Jason returns again... In space!
## 
### ERICK FLORES 
It's been a long time since we saw a
good, old-fashioned, sink-in-your
seat, scream-at-the-screen horror
movie. Unfortunately, "Jason X"
continues this trend. For those of us
unfamiliar with the infamous "Friday
the 13th" series, the '80s horror saga
follows Jason Voorhees. He is the
ruthless killer famed for wearing a
hockey mask and brutally slaughter
ing not-so-innocent teenagers at
Crystal Lake Camp with a razor
sharp machete or any other mur
dererous instrument that's handy.
In the most recent installment of
"Friday the 13th," director Jim
Isaac's "Jason X," the year is 2455. As
in almost every other movie that
takes place in the future and in
space, the Earth has been destroyed

by global warming,
and is consequently a
wasteland devoid of
life. A group of stu
dent astronauts / ar
chaeologists from New
Earth have returned
to humanity's ancient

homeland to investigate the
causes of the environmental
disaster that destroyed Old
Earth. In the course of their
investigation, they come
across two 450-year old,
cryogenically-frozen hu
mans; one, a wounded but
beautiful young woman
(newcomer Lexa Doig), the
other, a brawny man (long
time Jason stuntman, Kane
llodder) wearing a hockey
mask and with machete in

hand. Taking the
two humans on
board the space
craft for research
and museum dis
play purposes, the
group of scientists
manages to re-

store them back to full health. Natural
ly, havoc and death ensue.
In the beginning, it seems the movie
has all the crucial elements for an okay,
at least pleasantly cheesy horror movie
sequel. The body count is "anted up" to
nearly 20 victims. [Actually, according to
the Web site "Jason's Lair," the body count
reaches 26 — Ed.] The classically freak
ish song that goes on whenever Jason
enters the scene is reworked and mod
ernized. And you have your token,


"1 love Herbal Essences!"
ditzy teenage girls with pretty faces and lack of act
ing talent, who spit out cleverly corny one-liners to
tease and entice the hormone-driven chumps who

will eventually get killed while they're having
sex. So what goes wrong with the film?
Most horror sequels tend to get progres
sively worse as they get higher in number,
but you can tell a series has really hit rock
bottom when they not only get to number 10,
but also when the best way they can revamp
the series is by sending the killer to space
(anyone remember "Leprechaun 4: Lep
rechaun in Space," which happened to follow
"Leprechaun 3: In the Hood"?). It's bad
enough that the movie's about a psycho who
can't be finished off with 40 gunshots, but
there is something about the movie taking
place in a completely different place and
time that completely dissolves the reality of
the killing spree actually occurring, which is
what makes a good horror movie actually
terrify its audience.
1 give the movie two stars, not because it
was that good, but for its efforts in trying to

re-create one of the timeless terrorizers of tlie
horror genre. Horror movie buffs will want to
check out this movie just to keep up with the
times, while the rest of the world can wait until

it goes on video. Or if you're lucky, you can watch it
at the movie theatre with an energetic audience that
laughs every time someone gets axed.


Ten bucks says that guy dies in about 15 seconds.
