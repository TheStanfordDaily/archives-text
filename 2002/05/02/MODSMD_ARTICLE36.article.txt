# 'Son of' yet another mid-life crisis
## 
### RANDY MANO 
We rill remember the pre
cious early days of our lives, when we
used to play Cowboys and Indians or
tetherball with our friends. For the
Oscar-nominated film from Argenti
na, "The Son of the Bride," the child
hood focus is on Zorro. Regardless
the object, the things that tapped into

our time of innocence and yummy cookies become particularly
important as our lifestyles increase in complexity and difficulty.
At the center of this film is Rafael Belvedere (Ricardo
Darin), the typical middle-aged man who is rapidly ap
proaching a mid-life crisis. He is divorced and shares duties
with his ex-wife for raising their daughter. As the manager for
the family restaurant, Rafael is essentially at the mercy of cred
itors, suppliers and customers. I can easily see why he suffers
a near breakdown and pushes fora dramatic change in his life.
After meeting the elderly couple, Nino (Hector Alte

Rio) and Norma (Norma Aleandro), Rafael starts to under

stand what is truly important in life. His parents
have been together for decades, but they never
held a formal wedding ceremony in the church,
something long held to be Norina's dream. The
love that they possess supercedes anything that

may mar the relation
ship, whether it be a re
bellious child or
Alzheimer's disease.

What 1 had assumed would
be a tedious exercise turned out to be
one of the most moving love stories in
recent memory. There are different
examples of love in "'Hie Son of the
Bride," and I found myself believing
in the characters and all that they
stood for. Particularly wacky is Juan
Carlos (Eduardo Blanco), Rafael's
childhood friend who returns into his

life with great impact.
Directed byjuan Jose Campanella, "Son of the Bride"
exhibits some of the same oddball details that made the French
film "Amelie" so memorable. Both films were, in fact, nomi
nated for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars this past year, only to
lose out to Bosnia's "No Man's Land." This film did, however,

pick up honors at the Havana and Mon
treal film festivals, and it's easy to see why.
One can only hope that this look
into Argentina families commands a
wider audience as it moves into new mar
kets and eventually onto video. It's a very
clean and well-executed comedy-drama
containing real people with real issues. 1
would have to agree with one of the char
acters, who at one point says that life is
about sharing problems with other peo
ple who matter — and that a life without
trouble is quite possibly the greatest
problem of all.
