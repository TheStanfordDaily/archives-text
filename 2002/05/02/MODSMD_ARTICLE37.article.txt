						'Crush' for Oprah lovers to fall for

### MARK ROBBINS 
In "Crush," writer/
director John McKay
shows us "Sex and the
City" 10 years down
the road, Three 40-
something English
spinsters lounge on
couches, drink gin,

smoke, eat chocolates and share their goof)-
dramatized escapades with giddy delight.
In its best moments, "Crush" is wry and
clever. In its worst, it is soggy and sappy.
Kate (Andie MacDowell) is a stern, proper
headmistress lor a parochial school, who
meticulously hides a wilder side. Molly
(Anna Chancellor) is a cynical thrice-di
vorced doctor, hunting down wealthy men
with all the compassion of a great white
shark. Jimine (Imelda Staunton) is a tough
yet tender police chief, who like the others,
longs to snare an ideal man.

As of late, however, the three are dis
tressed to find that their stories come right

out of the pages of Bridget
Jones's diary. Kate appoints
herself the saddest case of the
three, and her friends are con
cerned about her depressed
state. Molly urges Kate to pur
sue Gerald, a stable, kind, and al
together uninteresting minister.

Kate, however, yearns for something more.
Suddenly a brooding, passionate young
man named Jed entrances Kate. The two en
gage in a whirlwind affair, replete with an
abundance of coupling in public places —
not even the graveyard is spared. The 25-
year-old former student of Kate's is a funeral
organist, opening a reservoir of male anato
myjokes.
Janine and Molly disapprove of Kate's
choice. Molly makes it her mission to restore
Kate's senses, even if it means sabotaging the
relationship.

MacDowell, who has rarely had the op
portunity to perform in a lead role, gives an
even and convincing performance. I ler
pleasantness holds up even through some
melo-tragic subject matter. Chancellor,
who appeared with MacDowell in "Four
Weddings and a Funeral," seems right at
home in another movie with a lot of wed
dings and a lot ofTunerals. The squatty and
spirited Staunton, who played a nurse in
"Shakespeare in Love", is a curious fit for

the group, but her pres
ence offers the triad an in
teresting dimension.
The film is nicely im
aged with classic English
refinement. Cinematogra
plier Henry Braham cap
tures a glossy postcard feel.
Kevin Sargent's con
tributes a sweeping origi
nal score, mood music in
tended to bolster the film's

emotional pull.
"Crush" is too long and too sentimental. It
is not, however, without a few satisfying flash
es of dry wit. Unfortunately, after a bouncy
start, the movie takes a somber turn, and
ends up being more of a downer than one
might expect. "Crush" has a definite under
current of self-pity that screams for Hugh
Grant to step in and provide some levity.
Aimed at Oprah Winfrey lovers every
where, "Crush" is a warm portrait of there-

lationship of
three women,
the influence
they have on one
another, the in
jury they can in
flict despite the
noblest of inten
tions and the re
silience of their
bond. Hugs all
around!
