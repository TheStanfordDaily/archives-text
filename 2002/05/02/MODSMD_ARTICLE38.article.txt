This is the set >ewth in a series of articles called "The Record Bin " ex
f)loring classic albums from the past: pop music for people who like
pop music.

When it comes to sonic pioneer
Kraftwerk, I don't think I can come
up with enough adjectives to ade
quately describe just how amazing
and important its members are as
musicians. And I definitely won't
have enough room in this article to
go into the intricacies of why its 1978
album "The Man-Machine" is

damn near the best electronic music album ever released.
But in the next few paragraphs I'll try to convey some of the
details behind the band that basically invented modern elec
tronic music and paved the way for techno, synth-pop, elec
tro and New Wave.
A few years ago, an article by a British music critic made
the argument that Kraftwerk has been the most influential
musical group of the 20th century. I know some musical en
thusiasts out there are crapping their pants at the thought
of a "techno" group being more influential than the Fab

Four, but Kraftwerk's effect on
everything from rave culture to
modern pop music has been gi
gantic. Self-proclaimed admir
ers of Kraftwerk include
Human League, Depeche
Mode, Gary Numan, YMC) and
David Bowie, among others.
Even the great gloved-one
Michael Jackson was such a fan
that he asked the band to pro
duce Janet's album, which it of
course refused.
Kraftwerk is nearly the most
sampled band ever. Its beats
and melodies have been used
by such artists as Prodigy, Devo,
Beck, Erasure, Madonna, Des
tiny's Child, KRS-One, De La

Soul, Jay-Z, Chemical Brothers, 2 Live Crew, Fatboy Slim,
Afrika Bambaataa, R.E.M., Biz Markie, Dr. Dre, Sir Mix-A-
Lot and Roni Size. In addition to the giant influence that
Kraftwerk had at the time its albums first hit, a whole new

batch of artists following in the band's footsteps have sprung
up, including Ladytron, Adult, and Takako Minekawa.
These bands have revived the Kraftwerk-perfected sound of
analog synthesizers and also use common Kraftwerk themes
such as technology and society as their starting points.

1 remember the first time I heard
Kraftwerk as a high school sophomore,
riding in my friend's car on a highway
headed toward Detroit Motor City. In this
fitting landscape, Kraftwerk's incredible
melodic tones and crisp beats melted my
brain. Though seemingly cold and inhu
man at first listen ("Sounds like Nintendo
music," according to my dormmate), the
songs reflect intricate and intelligent

arrangements and seriously tight beats and hooks. Timba
land ain't got nothing on Kraftwerk. After, hearing them, 1
never listened to pop music in the same way again.
Though the lineup of the band has changed over its 32
years of existence, the core of Kraftwerk remains Ralf Flut
ter and Florian Schneider, who originally met while study
ing improvised music in Diisseldorf, Germany. Both classi
cally trained musicians, their shared interests in experi
menting with new technologies lead them to eventually form
Kraftwerk in 1970.

Each one of Kraftwerk's
albums have focused on a specif
ic theme: "Autobahn" conveys
the feeling of monotony and ex
ploration associated with travel
ing on Germany's expansive
highways, "Radioactivity" deals
with the concept of radio and the
transmission of ideas and sound,
and "Computer World" de
scribes a future society in which
personal devices and computers
are completely integrated into
our lifestyle. On the album " The
Man-Machine," Kraftwerk bril
liantly illustrates the idea of the
worker's body as a machine of
production. This idea pervades
the entire album, all the way to

the cover image, which depicts the band members attired in
stark, crisp red shirts, uniformly devoid of personality.
Asynthetic voice in the first track "The Robots," drops the
line "Ja tvoi sluga, ja tvoi Robotnik" in monotone, which

translates from Russ
ian as, "I'm your
slave, I'm your work
er." Here the term
robot, which was orig
inally derived from
the Czech word for
worker, "robotnik," is
employed as
Kraftwerk describes
itself not as a group of
musicians, but of au
tomated machines
that labor to create

music. Kraftwerk later pushed this image even further by
creating automated robot figures which would perform and
dance on stage in place of the musicians during tours in the
early '80s. How freaking rad is that?
Though the album is centered around the concept of au
tomation and man as machine, the music is not soulless, as
evident by the beautiful melodies found on the tracks
"Spacelab" and "Neon Lights." While "Spacelab" is upbeat
and confronts the image of a Utopian human habitat in
space, the track that follows,"Metropolis," serves as its an
tithesis, painting a dystopian city on Earth using claustro
phobic synthesizer tones and an impending snare beat.
Along with numerous synthetic computer vocals throughout
"The Man-Machine," 1 Hitter sings on the track "The Model"
describing an infatuation with a beautiful woman who re
sponds only to the camera lenses. The album ends with the
title track "Man-Machine," the beat of which was stolen and
used as the hook in Jay-Z's track "Sunshine."'The vocals float
along in contrast with the sound of the piston-like beats, thus
reiterating the symbiotic relationship between man and ma
chine.
Kraftwerk is poetic, classical and revolutionary. It made
huge splashes in the 70s and '80s by embracing technology
and expanding its possibilities as a method for creating in
novative music. As Kraftwerk illustrates through its musical
masterpiece "The Man-Machine," the most important cre
ative processes in the technological age come from an equal
partnership between man and machine. As musical "robot
nik," the band's members are able to synthesize a sound in
which the creator and instrument are of equal importance.
With this album, Kraftwerk deftly ties the advances of the
20th century to man's own function and place as an "auto
matic" creature through beautiful, stark and infectious com
positions.

Kraftwerk is poetic, classical and revolutionary. It made
huge splashes in the 70s and '80s by embracing technology
and expanding its possibilities as a method for creating in
novative music. As Kraftwerk illustrates through its musical
masterpiece "The Man-Machine," the most important cre
ative processes in the technological age come from an equal
partnership between man and machine. As musical "robot
nik," the band's members are able to synthesize a sound in
which the creator and instrument are of equal importance.
With this album, Kraftwerk deftly ties the advances of the
20th century to man's own function and place as an "auto
matic" creature through beautiful, stark and infectious com
positions.

This is the set >ewth in a series of articles called "The Record Bin " ex
f)loring classic albums from the past: pop music for people who like
pop music.

When it comes to sonic pioneer
Kraftwerk, I don't think I can come
up with enough adjectives to ade
quately describe just how amazing
and important its members are as
musicians. And I definitely won't
have enough room in this article to
go into the intricacies of why its 1978
album "The Man-Machine" is

damn near the best electronic music album ever released.
But in the next few paragraphs I'll try to convey some of the
details behind the band that basically invented modern elec
tronic music and paved the way for techno, synth-pop, elec
tro and New Wave.
A few years ago, an article by a British music critic made
the argument that Kraftwerk has been the most influential
musical group of the 20th century. I know some musical en
thusiasts out there are crapping their pants at the thought
of a "techno" group being more influential than the Fab

Four, but Kraftwerk's effect on
everything from rave culture to
modern pop music has been gi
gantic. Self-proclaimed admir
ers of Kraftwerk include
Human League, Depeche
Mode, Gary Numan, YMC) and
David Bowie, among others.
Even the great gloved-one
Michael Jackson was such a fan
that he asked the band to pro
duce Janet's album, which it of
course refused.
Kraftwerk is nearly the most
sampled band ever. Its beats
and melodies have been used
by such artists as Prodigy, Devo,
Beck, Erasure, Madonna, Des
tiny's Child, KRS-One, De La

Soul, Jay-Z, Chemical Brothers, 2 Live Crew, Fatboy Slim,
Afrika Bambaataa, R.E.M., Biz Markie, Dr. Dre, Sir Mix-A-
Lot and Roni Size. In addition to the giant influence that
Kraftwerk had at the time its albums first hit, a whole new

batch of artists following in the band's footsteps have sprung
up, including Ladytron, Adult, and Takako Minekawa.
These bands have revived the Kraftwerk-perfected sound of
analog synthesizers and also use common Kraftwerk themes
such as technology and society as their starting points.

1 remember the first time I heard
Kraftwerk as a high school sophomore,
riding in my friend's car on a highway
headed toward Detroit Motor City. In this
fitting landscape, Kraftwerk's incredible
melodic tones and crisp beats melted my
brain. Though seemingly cold and inhu
man at first listen ("Sounds like Nintendo
music," according to my dormmate), the
songs reflect intricate and intelligent

arrangements and seriously tight beats and hooks. Timba
land ain't got nothing on Kraftwerk. After, hearing them, 1
never listened to pop music in the same way again.
Though the lineup of the band has changed over its 32
years of existence, the core of Kraftwerk remains Ralf Flut
ter and Florian Schneider, who originally met while study
ing improvised music in Diisseldorf, Germany. Both classi
cally trained musicians, their shared interests in experi
menting with new technologies lead them to eventually form
Kraftwerk in 1970.

Each one of Kraftwerk's
albums have focused on a specif
ic theme: "Autobahn" conveys
the feeling of monotony and ex
ploration associated with travel
ing on Germany's expansive
highways, "Radioactivity" deals
with the concept of radio and the
transmission of ideas and sound,
and "Computer World" de
scribes a future society in which
personal devices and computers
are completely integrated into
our lifestyle. On the album " The
Man-Machine," Kraftwerk bril
liantly illustrates the idea of the
worker's body as a machine of
production. This idea pervades
the entire album, all the way to

the cover image, which depicts the band members attired in
stark, crisp red shirts, uniformly devoid of personality.
Asynthetic voice in the first track "The Robots," drops the
line "Ja tvoi sluga, ja tvoi Robotnik" in monotone, which

translates from Russ
ian as, "I'm your
slave, I'm your work
er." Here the term
robot, which was orig
inally derived from
the Czech word for
worker, "robotnik," is
employed as
Kraftwerk describes
itself not as a group of
musicians, but of au
tomated machines
that labor to create

music. Kraftwerk later pushed this image even further by
creating automated robot figures which would perform and
dance on stage in place of the musicians during tours in the
early '80s. How freaking rad is that?
Though the album is centered around the concept of au
tomation and man as machine, the music is not soulless, as
evident by the beautiful melodies found on the tracks
"Spacelab" and "Neon Lights." While "Spacelab" is upbeat
and confronts the image of a Utopian human habitat in
space, the track that follows,"Metropolis," serves as its an
tithesis, painting a dystopian city on Earth using claustro
phobic synthesizer tones and an impending snare beat.
Along with numerous synthetic computer vocals throughout
"The Man-Machine," 1 Hitter sings on the track "The Model"
describing an infatuation with a beautiful woman who re
sponds only to the camera lenses. The album ends with the
title track "Man-Machine," the beat of which was stolen and
used as the hook in Jay-Z's track "Sunshine."'The vocals float
along in contrast with the sound of the piston-like beats, thus
reiterating the symbiotic relationship between man and ma
chine.
