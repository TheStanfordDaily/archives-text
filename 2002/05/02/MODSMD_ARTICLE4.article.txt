# High textbook prices vex students
## 
### ALEX BLEYLEBEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the average undergradu
ate expected to spend $1,125 on
textbooks and school supplies next
year, many students questioned
the pricing practices of the Stan
ford Bookstore, the primary sup
plier of books and course materials
to students across campus.
The market for custom course
texts and new and used textbooks
reached $5.2 billion last year in the
United States, with students dol
ing out an average of $66.08 per
new book. Student complaints
range from the buy-back policy to
the prices of textbooks in general.
"Books represent one of the
most significant living costs for stu
dents on campus," said newly
elected ASSU senator Dan Wend
landt, a freshman whose campaign

platform fora seat in the senate in
cluded measures to reduce the cost
of books. "Anyone who has sold a
book back for $10 and seen it on
the shelf the next day for $40
knows that the Bookstore is rip
ping ns off. There must be a better
way." ASSU President-Elect and
Vice-President-Elect Monica Hen
estroza and Nick Rodriguez made
lowering prices at the Bookstore a
large part of their recent cam
paign.
But Bookstore Textbook Man
ager Kevin O'Rourke said that the
textbook department is the least
profitable division of the store, and
that it barely covers its costs. The
Bookstore makes a 25 percent
margin on most books it sells, five
percent higher than the standard
20 percent listed by many publish
ers as the "list price."
Why the difference?

"To a certain extent, it's the
seven percent rebate we give to
students," said O'Rourke. "We
also have a cost of shipping that
isn't necessarily calculated in [the
publishers' list price]. But 25 per
cent is pretty much an industry
standard."
But not everyone agrees.
"The Bookstore takes advan
tage of its monopoly and often
charges significantly higher prices
for new books than local book re
tailers or online bookstores," said
Wendlandt.
O'Rourke also points to payroll,
rent and the store's inability to bar
gain with publishers as a few cir
cumstances leading to high text
book prices.
"It's pretty much a monopoly,"
he said. "The publishers that make
textbooks are the only ones who
make them. One of the problems
that the industry has had and is
trying to address is that certain
large stores like Barnes & Noble
may get a better price than we
would get."
Sales and Marketing Manager
Jef Friedel sympathized with
students.
"1 was in the same boat when I
was in school. 1 didn't understand
[the pricing] until I understood
the business and realized what the
publishers are doing. There's no
control that the individual book
store has over what the publisher is
going to dole out tothem."
It may be difficult for students
to win a battle to lower new text
book prices; however, many point
towards the Bookstore's book-buy
ing practices as an area with po
tential for change.
"[The Bookstore] buys books
really low and sells them really
high," Rodriguez. "If you offer
them [a price] somewhere in the
middle, everyone is better oil be
cause you cut out the middleman.
The big challenge for us is to go to
our business arm, Stanford Stu
dent Enterprises, so that we can
come up with a feasible program
that offers an alternative to the
Bookstore."

A student dishes out some money to a Bookstore cashier yesterday. ASSU ex
ecutives and senators are seeking to develop plans that are make purchas
ing books more affordable for students.
dard store practice is to pay half
of a book's original value and
then mark it up to 75 percent of
the original, but frustrated stu
dents say they have not seen
large financial returns on their
used books.
"Although the Bookstore un
derstandably needs to make a
profit on used books, it seems
like they pay students one-tenth
of the original price and then
sell them back to other students
at almost the original price,"

said freshman Kea Gilbert. "It's
so ridiculous."
According to Wendlandt, ef
forts should center around both
creating an independent used
book exchange program and
also on pressuring the store to
lower prices.
"I believe combating overpric
ing at the Bookstore is a great op
portunity for the ASSU to follow
through on its stated mission of
representing the interests of
every student on campus," said
Wendlandt. "It is an area where
ASSU resources can be realisti
cally and effectively applied to
create tangible benefits for all
students." He also believes that a

competing used-book exchange
program could be set up using
the Internet.
More reasonable arguments
centered on the belief that a prof
it should not be made from re
quired course materials at a non
profit institution.
" I he Bookstore should be a ser
vice to students, and after covering
its costs ii should not be a money
making enterprise," said freshman
Rob Gibson.
O'Rowrke agreed that the
Bookstore maintains a virtual mo
nopoly on campus and that its
goal is to make money, but stated
that its prices are comparable to
most retailers.

With the average undergradu
ate expected to spend $1,125 on
textbooks and school supplies next
year, many students questioned
the pricing practices of the Stan
ford Bookstore, the primary sup
plier of books and course materials
to students across campus.
The market for custom course
texts and new and used textbooks
reached $5.2 billion last year in the
United States, with students dol
ing out an average of $66.08 per
new book. Student complaints
range from the buy-back policy to
the prices of textbooks in general.
"Books represent one of the
most significant living costs for stu
dents on campus," said newly
elected ASSU senator Dan Wend
landt, a freshman whose campaign

platform fora seat in the senate in
cluded measures to reduce the cost
of books. "Anyone who has sold a
book back for $10 and seen it on
the shelf the next day for $40
knows that the Bookstore is rip
ping ns off. There must be a better
way." ASSU President-Elect and
Vice-President-Elect Monica Hen
estroza and Nick Rodriguez made
lowering prices at the Bookstore a
large part of their recent cam
paign.
But Bookstore Textbook Man
ager Kevin O'Rourke said that the
textbook department is the least
profitable division of the store, and
that it barely covers its costs. The
Bookstore makes a 25 percent
margin on most books it sells, five
percent higher than the standard
20 percent listed by many publish
ers as the "list price."
Why the difference?

"To a certain extent, it's the
seven percent rebate we give to
students," said O'Rourke. "We
also have a cost of shipping that
isn't necessarily calculated in [the
publishers' list price]. But 25 per
cent is pretty much an industry
standard."
But not everyone agrees.
"The Bookstore takes advan
tage of its monopoly and often
charges significantly higher prices
for new books than local book re
tailers or online bookstores," said
Wendlandt.
O'Rourke also points to payroll,
rent and the store's inability to bar
gain with publishers as a few cir
cumstances leading to high text
book prices.
"It's pretty much a monopoly,"
he said. "The publishers that make
textbooks are the only ones who
make them. One of the problems
that the industry has had and is
trying to address is that certain
large stores like Barnes & Noble
may get a better price than we
would get."
Sales and Marketing Manager
Jef Friedel sympathized with
students.
"1 was in the same boat when I
was in school. 1 didn't understand
[the pricing] until I understood
the business and realized what the
publishers are doing. There's no
control that the individual book
store has over what the publisher is
going to dole out tothem."
It may be difficult for students
to win a battle to lower new text
book prices; however, many point
towards the Bookstore's book-buy
ing practices as an area with po
tential for change.
"[The Bookstore] buys books
really low and sells them really
high," Rodriguez. "If you offer
them [a price] somewhere in the
middle, everyone is better oil be
cause you cut out the middleman.
The big challenge for us is to go to
our business arm, Stanford Stu
dent Enterprises, so that we can
come up with a feasible program
that offers an alternative to the
Bookstore."
O'Rourke maintains that stan

ing books more affordable for students.
dard store practice is to pay half
of a book's original value and
then mark it up to 75 percent of
the original, but frustrated stu
dents say they have not seen
large financial returns on their
used books.
"Although the Bookstore un
derstandably needs to make a
profit on used books, it seems
like they pay students one-tenth
of the original price and then
sell them back to other students
at almost the original price,"

said freshman Kea Gilbert. "It's
so ridiculous."
According to Wendlandt, ef
forts should center around both
creating an independent used
book exchange program and
also on pressuring the store to
lower prices.
"I believe combating overpric
ing at the Bookstore is a great op
portunity for the ASSU to follow
through on its stated mission of
representing the interests of
every student on campus," said
Wendlandt. "It is an area where
ASSU resources can be realisti
cally and effectively applied to
create tangible benefits for all
students." He also believes that a

competing used-book exchange
program could be set up using
the Internet.
More reasonable arguments
centered on the belief that a prof
it should not be made from re
quired course materials at a non
profit institution.
" I he Bookstore should be a ser
vice to students, and after covering
its costs ii should not be a money
making enterprise," said freshman
Rob Gibson.
O'Rowrke agreed that the
Bookstore maintains a virtual mo

goal is to make money, but stated
that its prices are comparable to
