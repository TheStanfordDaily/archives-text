### ANNA GAL√ÅN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After recent newspaper articles
highlighting the case of Nebraska
assistant football coach Ron Brown,
who claims that he was not granted
a second interview for the head loot
ball coaching position at Sum ford
because of his religious beliefs, con
troversy and commentary have con
tinued to erupt in Nebraska, in the
Bay Area and nationally.
On April 11, the Daily Ne
braskan broke a story suiting that
Brown did not get past his initial
January interview at Stanford be
cause of his highly publicized reli
gious views.
However, Athletics Department
officials say that religion had noth
ing to do with their decision to move
on to other candidates.
When The Stanford Daily
asked the Athletics Department to
comment on the disparity between
their accounts and Brown's, offi
cials referred questions to Gary
Migdol, the assistant athletic direc
tor in charge of media relations.
Migdol stressed the sensitivity of
the issue.
"It is our policy in matters of per

sonnel issues or confidential search
processes to not comment," said
Migdol. "I've read the news story,
and the follow-up [editorial] where
they stood behind their reporter,
and I'm not in a position to com
ment on it."
The Daily Nebrask.au article stat
ed that Brown's religious views were
a factor in the decision not to invite
him to a second interview.
The Daily Nebrask.au quoted
Asst. Athletic Director Alan Glenn
as saying Brown's religion "was def
initely something that had to be
considered." He also said, "We're a
very diverse community with a di
verse alumni. Anything that
would stand out that much is
something that has to be looked
at... It was one of many variables
that was considered."
Glenn, in a letter to the Daily Ne
braskan, stated that the comments
attributed to him were misrepre
sented by the reporter. He also
claimed his comments were gener
al, not specific to Brown.
However, the Daily Nebraskan
stands behind its reporter, stating
in an editorial that Glenn "told our
reporter that Brown's religious be
liefs certainly were a key factor in
Brown's not being granted a sec
ond interview. [Glenn] also said
there were other factors."
"I have known Ron Brown for
more than 25 years and consider
him to be a friend," said Glenn in
the letter. "Me is an excellent
football coach, and an outstand
ing candidate for the head-coach
ing position."
Glenn said he endorsed Brown's
candidacy and recommended him
to Athletic Director Ted Leland.
Brown said he was told that his
Christian convictions would not
mesh well with the University. He
siiid it was ironic that a prestigious
school founded on religious princi
ples is no longer welcoming to born
again Christians.
"If I'd been discriminated against
for being black, they would've never
told me that," Brown stated in the
Daily Nebraskan. "They had no
problem telling me it was because of

my Christian beliefs. That's amaz
ing to me."
Leland also wrote a letter to the
editor following the initial article
stating that the article "inaccurately
portrayed the issue of religion in
Stanford's decision not to hire
Coach Brown."
"Stanford University supports a
diverse community in which beliefs
of all faiths are welcomed and ac
cepted," said Leland in his letter.
"Discrimination in this manner is
not tolerated."
Leland mentioned that Stan
ford's previous football coach,
Tyrone Willingham, who left
Stanford to become the head
coach at Notre Dame, "had a
strong religious background and
enjoyed seven very successful
seasons at Stanford."
Last January, Leland hired
Buddy Teevens, a long-time friend
and colleague from Dartmouth to
fill the head coach position.
Brown, who has coached at Ne
braska since 1987, earned a bache
lor's in sociology at Brown and a
master's in heath administration at
Columbia. He hosts two statewide
Christian radio shows, is a speaker

for the Fellowship of Christian Ath
letes and writes for its national
magazine, Sharing the Victory.
In 1999 he drew media atten
tion for comments made on his
Christian radio show "Husker
Sports Report" in which he
called homosexuality a sin. Fol
lowing that incident, the word
"Husker" was removed from his
show's title.
Brown said he questions himself
every day, hut is not willing to erase
his religious beliefs from his resume.
"I'm not a secular Ron Brown and
a Christian Ron Brown," he said. "1
am a Christian Ron Brown period."
Brown wrote about his feelings
in the March 2002 issue of Sharing
the Victory.
"I wasn't upset with the decision
to choose another candidate over
me," Brown said, "but 1 was
shocked at the reason and that the
university was that up-front in
telling me the reason."
The refusal to comment on the
part of Stanford and Nebraska offi
cials hasn't stopped national atten
tion. Articles have appeared in the
San Francisco Chronicle and the
Omaha World-Herald.

the issue.
"It is our policy in matters of per

sonnel issues or confidential search
processes to not comment," said
Migdol. "I've read the news story,
and the follow-up [editorial] where
they stood behind their reporter,
and I'm not in a position to com
ment on it."
The Daily Nebrask.au article stat
ed that Brown's religious views were
a factor in the decision not to invite
him to a second interview.
The Daily Nebrask.au quoted
Asst. Athletic Director Alan Glenn
as saying Brown's religion "was def
initely something that had to be
considered." He also said, "We're a
very diverse community with a di
verse alumni. Anything that
would stand out that much is
something that has to be looked
at... It was one of many variables
that was considered."
Glenn, in a letter to the Daily Ne
braskan, stated that the comments
attributed to him were misrepre
sented by the reporter. He also
claimed his comments were gener
al, not specific to Brown.
However, the Daily Nebraskan
stands behind its reporter, stating
in an editorial that Glenn "told our
reporter that Brown's religious be
liefs certainly were a key factor in
Brown's not being granted a sec
ond interview. [Glenn] also said
there were other factors."
"I have known Ron Brown for
more than 25 years and consider
him to be a friend," said Glenn in
the letter. "Me is an excellent
football coach, and an outstand
ing candidate for the head-coach
ing position."
Glenn said he endorsed Brown's
candidacy and recommended him
to Athletic Director Ted Leland.
Brown said he was told that his
Christian convictions would not
mesh well with the University. He
siiid it was ironic that a prestigious
school founded on religious princi
ples is no longer welcoming to born
again Christians.
"If I'd been discriminated against
for being black, they would've never
told me that," Brown stated in the
Daily Nebraskan. "They had no
problem telling me it was because of

my Christian beliefs. That's amaz
ing to me."
Leland also wrote a letter to the
editor following the initial article
stating that the article "inaccurately
portrayed the issue of religion in
Stanford's decision not to hire
Coach Brown."
"Stanford University supports a
diverse community in which beliefs
of all faiths are welcomed and ac
cepted," said Leland in his letter.
"Discrimination in this manner is
not tolerated."
Leland mentioned that Stan
ford's previous football coach,
Tyrone Willingham, who left
Stanford to become the head
coach at Notre Dame, "had a
strong religious background and
enjoyed seven very successful
seasons at Stanford."
Last January, Leland hired
Buddy Teevens, a long-time friend
and colleague from Dartmouth to
fill the head coach position.
Brown, who has coached at Ne
braska since 1987, earned a bache
lor's in sociology at Brown and a
master's in heath administration at
Columbia. He hosts two statewide
Christian radio shows, is a speaker

for the Fellowship of Christian Ath
letes and writes for its national
magazine, Sharing the Victory.
In 1999 he drew media atten
tion for comments made on his
Christian radio show "Husker
Sports Report" in which he
called homosexuality a sin. Fol
lowing that incident, the word
"Husker" was removed from his
show's title.
Brown said he questions himself
every day, hut is not willing to erase
his religious beliefs from his resume.
"I'm not a secular Ron Brown and
a Christian Ron Brown," he said. "1
am a Christian Ron Brown period."
Brown wrote about his feelings
in the March 2002 issue of Sharing
the Victory.
"I wasn't upset with the decision
to choose another candidate over
me," Brown said, "but 1 was
shocked at the reason and that the
university was that up-front in
telling me the reason."
The refusal to comment on the
part of Stanford and Nebraska offi
cials hasn't stopped national atten
tion. Articles have appeared in the
San Francisco Chronicle and the
Omaha World-Herald.
