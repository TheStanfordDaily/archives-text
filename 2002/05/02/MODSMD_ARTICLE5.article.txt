After recent newspaper articles
highlighting the case of Nebraska
assistant football coach Ron Brown,
who claims that he was not granted
a second interview for the head loot
ball coaching position at Sum ford
because of his religious beliefs, con
troversy and commentary have con

Bay Area and nationally.

at... It was one of many variables
that was considered."
Glenn, in a letter to the Daily Ne
braskan, stated that the comments
attributed to him were misrepre

claimed his comments were gener

However, the Daily Nebraskan
stands behind its reporter, stating
