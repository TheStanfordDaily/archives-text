# With beer, group showers, and a colorful history that involves chickens,
## Co-ops rule the roost 
### JENNY MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ihe history of cooperative living at Stanford is a col
orful tale involving earthquakes, chicken raising and
former fraternity houses. Stanford is home to seven
cooperatives, each of which has its own lore, passed on
from one year to the next, often immortalized in jour
nals and scrapbooks, and in some cases, laid out in
Web sites.
A co-op differs from a self-op, or regular Row house,
in that its residents take responsibility for all the clean
ing and cooking. In a self-op, residents may "hash," or
clean up after meals, but paid cooks and cleaning staff
help keep the house running smoothly.
The co-op system can result in a varying spectrum
of house cleanliness, but the student-prepared food is
generally highly regarded. Most co-ops welcome eat
ing associates, or students who don't live in the house
but pay for meals and food privileges.
Junior Marisa Egerstrom, an eating associate at
Terra, praised the residence for its beer selection.
"Terra has beer," Egerstrom said, applauding the
variety of both domestic and imported libations.

Alter her initial enthusiasm, Egerstrom went on to
land Terra for its laid-back atmosphere.
"Terra is the most relaxed co-op," she said. "You
can do your own thing and you're not expected to ad
here to any party line or image."
Egerstrom's comment highlights several of the
stereotypes associated with co-operative houses. To
some, the word "co-op" evokes images of meatless 11 ess,
group showers and political leftism.
While Columbae and Synergy are vegetarian co-ops,
the other live — Terra, Enchanted Broccoli Forest, ('.hi
Theta Chi, Kairos and I lammarskjold — serve meat.
And while social activism occurs in a "higher per
centage" at Synergy than at other residences, accord
ing to resident Jed Peterson, a senior, the characteristic
is "not true for everyone."
As for group showers, even those co-ops with the
more radical reputations don't force anyone to bathe in
a setting that would cause discomfort.
To many co-op residents, the unique residential sit
uation means a close community, good food and
greater responsibility than in a dorm or a self-op.
"At a co-op, there's no one who
will come in and [clean] for you,"
said sophomore Dara Weinberg,
next year's financial manager at En
chanted Broccoli Forest. "It's much
more like real life," she added.
Real life* is exactly what many co
op residents experienced in 1989
when the Loma Prieta earthquake
made a number of the co-operative
residences unlivable. Residents of
Columbae, Synergy and the former
Phi Psi co-op moved out of their
houses lor the remainder of the
school year, according the Synergy
"quake memorial Web site."
Synergy resumed the following
academic year in the Grove houses,
and was eventually relocated to its
current location in what had been
the Phi Psi house. A controversy
erupted over the future of Synergy's
old house, a historic residence com
pleted in 1911 by Beaux Arts archi
tects Blakewell and Brown for the
Sigma Nil fraternity. The house was
demolished in 1991, and Synergy
residents mourned the loss of their
20-year site ofcollective living, chick
en raising and organic gardening.
The Phi Psi co-op moved in 1991

to the former Alpha Delta Phi house
and changed its name to Enchanted
Broccoli Forest, after Mollie Katzen's
famous vegetarian cookbook.
Other co-ops have their stories,

too, but many are more fascinating
to the residents and don't involve
the drama of devastating; natural
disasters.
The deadline to apply fora hous

ing priority in the co-ops is this Fri
day. Residents might ask you to
clean the bathroom, or to bake cook
ies if you're lucky. But you probably
won't be feeding any chickens.
