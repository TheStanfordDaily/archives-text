The Destiny of America
and
The Promise of World Peace
At this time of world turmoil,
the United States Baha'i community
offers a perspective on the destiny of America
as the promoter of world peace.
More than a hundred years ago, Baha'u'llah, the founder
of the Baha'i Faith, addressing heads of state, proclaimed
that the age of maturity for the entire human race had
come. The unity of humankind was now to be established
as the foundation of the great peace that would mark the
highest stage in humanity's spiritual and social evolution.
Revolutionary and world-shaking changes were therefore
inevitable.
The Baha'i teachings state:
The world is moving on. Its events are unfolding
ominously and with bewildering rapidity. The whirlwind
of its passions is swift and alarmingly The New
World is insensibly drawn into its Dangers,
undreamt of and unpredictable, threaten it both from
within and from without. Its governments and peoples are
being gradually enmeshed in the coils of the world's
recurrent crises and fierce controversies.. . . The world is
contracting into a neighborhood. America, willingly or
unwillingly, must face and grapple with this new
situation. For purposes of national security, let alone
any humanitarian motive, she must assume the
obligations imposed by this newly created neighborhood.
Paradoxical as it may seem, her only hope of extricating
herself from the perils gathering around her is to become
entangled in that very web of international association
which the Hand of an inscrutable Providence is weaving.
The American nation, Baha'i's believe, will evolve,
through tests and trials to become a land of spiritual
distinction and leadership, a champion of justice and unity
among all peoples and nations, and a powerful
servant of the cause of everlasting peace. This is the peace
promised by God in the sacred texts of the world's
religions.
Establishing peace is not simply a matter of signing
treaties and protocols; it is a complex task requiring a new
level of commitment to resolving issues not customarily
associated with the pursuit of peace.
Universal acceptance of the spiritual principle of the
oneness of humankind is essential to any successful
attempt to establish world peace.
Racism, one of the most baneful and persistent evils, is
a major barrier to peace.
The emancipation of women, the achievement of full
equality of the sexes, is one of the most important, though
less acknowledged, prerequisites of peace.
The inordinate disparity between rich and poor keeps the
world in a state of instability, preventing the achievement
of peace.
Unbridled nationalism, as distinguished from a sane and
legitimate patriotism, must give way to a wider loyalty, to
the love of humanity as a whole.
Religious strife, the cause of innumerable wars and
conflicts throughout history, is a major obstacle to
progress. The challenge facing the world's religious
leaders is to contemplate, with hearts filled with
compassion and the desire for truth, the plight of
humanity, and to ask themselves whether they cannot, in
humility before their God, submerge their theological
differences in a great spirit of mutual forbearance that will
enable them to work together for the advancement of
human understanding and peace.
Baha'is pray, "May this American Democracy be the first
nation to establish the foundation of international
agreement. May it be the first nation to proclaim the unity
of mankind. May it be the first to unfurl the standard of
the Most Great Peace."
During this hour of crisis, we affirm our abiding faith in
the destiny of America. We know that the road to its
destiny is long, thorny and tortuous, but we are confident
that America will emerge from her trials undivided and
undefeatable.
