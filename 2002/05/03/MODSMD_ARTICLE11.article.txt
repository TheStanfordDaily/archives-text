# Professor to measure hypergravity
## 
### VICTOR REKLAITIS STAFF WRITER 
If you're looking fora summer
job, don't mind experiencing high
G-forces, and are serious about par
ticipating in a NASA research pro
ject, Human Biology Prof. Malcolm
Cohen would like to talk to you.
Cohen, also the chief of NASA's
Human Information Processing
Branch, is looking for test subjects
for this summer's nine-week exper
iment that will measure the long
term effects of hypergravity on hu
mans. Hypergravity refers to gravi
tational levels above 1 G, which is
the strength of the gravitational
field on Earth.
Cohen's experiment could help
NASA find the solution to an old
problem. For years, the space
agency has been concerned about
astronauts who undergo a "de-con
ditioning" process while in the low
gravity environment of space.
When they return to Earth they are
troubled by fainting spells, muscle
atrophy, and other side effects,
since they are no longer accus
tomed to the Earth's gravitational
field. To prevent this from happen

ing, NASA has considered using ar
tificial gravity produced by cen
trifugation din ing space travel.
"I'm going a little step further,"
Cohen said. "By producing more
[G-forces] than what you have on
Earth, [can you| make them better
conditioned and better capable of
tolerating the stresses they would
have on re-entry?"
When the astronauts return to
Earth, Cohen hopes they will no
longer suffer from any of the usual
complaints that now follow time
spent in space.
According to Cohen, his tests will
attempt to answer two questions.
First, can people tolerate high G
forces and high rotation rates in a
centrifuge for test periods of up to
22 hours without too many harmful
effects? Second, are people better
able to tolerate high G-forces after
this exposure?
To help answer these questions,
participants can expect to spend
five 22-hour sessions and several
shorter sessions in a test chamber
of the 20-G centrifuge at the NASA
Ames Research Center, located in
nearby Mountain View. The high
tech merry-go-round is 58 feet in

diameter and was recently fea
tured in the movie Space Cowboys.
It can simulate gravitational levels
of up to 20 G, although partici
pants in Cohen's study will be sub
ject to only 2 (is or less lor the long
duration tests.
While spinning, test subjects will
be able to eat, sleep, and move
about, as well as make use of the
TV, laptop computer, and toilet in
the well-equipped centrifuge cab.
They can stop the test at any time
and are under constant supervision
by trained flight surgeons and sci
entists.
Before the long-duration tests
begin, researchers will first deter
mine the G-tolerance level of each
participant.
"We'll put them in the centrifuge
and gradually build up the Gs, and
see at what G-level their blood flow
to the brain begins to decrease,
which is usually reflected by a loss of
peripheral vision," said Cohen.
Following 22 hours in the hyper
gravity environment, the same test
will be repeated, and the G-level at
which the subjects lose their periph
eral vision will again be recorded. 11
it is higher, Cohen's guess that long

term exposure to hypergravity can
increase G-tolerance levels will be
proven right.
Cohen emphasizes that the po
tential for each participant of be
coming bored or very dizzy is also
very high.
"1 don't want people to think,
'Hey, this is a lark.' This is hard
work ... and there is a genuine risk
involved," he said.
According to Cohen, potential
applicants should be "dedicated to
helping us out and getting this in
formation, because it's not a pleas
ant experience."
Applicants also should be
males between the ages of 18 and
35. The G-tolerance levels of
women will be tested in future ex
periments. Applicants are re
quired to be in excellent physical
shape (they will need to pass a
medical screening) and no taller
than 5' 8", because of the small
size of the centrifuge cab. They
will be paid an hourly rate that
has yet to be determined.
