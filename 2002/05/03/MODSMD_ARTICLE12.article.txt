## The 						Stanford Daily Religious views should not influence hirings 
### 
Nebraska assistant football coach Ron
Brown claims he was not invited for
a second-round interview for the
Stanford head football coaching po
sition because of his religious beliefs. Stanford
Athletic Director Ted Leland says otherwise.
We hope Iceland's statement is accurate. De
clining to pursue Brown on the basis of his reli
gious convictions, however offensive one might
find them, would set a disturbing precedent.
The Athletic Department's goal when hiring
should be to find the best coach, not to select
the applicant whose social, political and theo
logical judgments match those prevailing in
the Stanford community.
Brown, a Christian who regularly hosts a re
ligious radio talk show, told his listeners in
1999 that he considers homosexuality to be a
sin, on the evidence of biblical teaching. He be
lieves this highly controversial view helped

stymie his bid to replace Tyrone Willingham as
the Cardinal's next head football coach.
Members of Stanford's Queer/Straight So
cial and Political Alliance, when interviewed by
the University of Nebraska newspaper, sug
gested Brown's views would make it "really
hard for him," to be accepted at Stanford. Asst.
Athletic Director Alan Glenn told the same
paper "anything that would stand out" as
much as Brown's beliefs would, "has to be
looked at."
As an institution dedicated to the exploration
of ideas, Stanford does have an interest in what
its professors, staff members and yes, coaches,
think. Some ideas are, by their very nature, con
temptible. The U.S. Supreme Court has labeled
the articulation of ideas that are so offensive that
they are harmful in and of themselves "fighting
words." Religious beliefs should never be ac
cepted as an excuse for such words or as a

smokescreen for hatred or discrimination.
Yet Brown's essentially theological judgment
about what constitutes a sin is not synonymous
with hatred and need not preclude respect for
homosexuals as persons. As Brown has ac
knowledged, his theological views do not get
him "off the hook from loving people," or treat
ing them with dignity, fairness and understand
ing. Even strong disapproval of someone's be
havior does not necessarily equate to hatred or
disrespect of them.
Even more to the point, Brown's convictions
do not prevent him from being an able and re
sponsible football coach. This raises the ques
tion of what transpired in the January inter
view between Leland and Brown regarding
Stanford's head coaching position.
Brown was obviously left with the distinct
impression that his religious views were a de
terminative part of Leland's decision to turn

away Brown's candidacy. After initially telling
the Daily Nebraskan that Brown's beliefs were
indeed a consideration, Glenn revised his com
ments, saying he had been quoted out of con
text. Brown's religious views "were not a con
sideration," he now maintains.
Though keeping the substance of job inter
views confidential is a worthwhile practice, in
this case Leland should say frankly whether
Brown's religious faith was a subject of discus
sion in their meeting, or part of any subsequent
communications with Brown. Further, the Ath
letics Department should make it clear that it
adheres to University policy and does not dis
criminate on the basis of religion.
Stanford considers itself an inclusive com
munity. Part of being tolerant is being willing to
listen to and critically engage those with views
sharply different from our own, be it Ron
Brown or the student across the hall.
