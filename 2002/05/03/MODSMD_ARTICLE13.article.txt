## INS needs a visa to the Land of Sensible Ideas 
### 
Some immigrants came to America
and, faced with the difficulties of
travel, severed all physical ties with
the "old country." Other, more
modern immigrants came while maintain
ing firm links to friends and family still in
the country of origin, and these interna
tional links are, in turn, held by subse
quent generations.
In highly multi-ethnic California, even
more than in the U.S. overall, a healthy seg
ment of the populace is part of such global
ly diffuse clans. We are the ones you see on
the international phone-call commercials.
To this group, a change to visa law pro-

posed last month could
be, unless modified, an
unnecessary smack.
The change threatens
to cut back how long visi
tors can stay in t he country
from between six months
and a year to just thirty
days. Perhaps this is not
the most far-reaching of
recent immigration pro-

posals, but it is important to many people
nonetheless. The visa in question is called a
B-2 visitor visa, or more commonly, a tourist
visa — but to many, it is a "family visa."
For example, most people of Indian
background living in the U.S. have
brought parents or other family over from
India for visits. By "visits," I do not mean
three-day reunions where you just show
guests the sights and go out to dinner, but
rather multiple-month stays — which is
what all involved want, and all that can be
justified given the high cost of airfare.
People bring relatives over when there
are health problems. Or if a child is to be
born. Or if they are a working couple and
need someone to help care for the chil
dren. Or if they share responsibility for an
elderly relation. Or for any number of rea
sons, including all those for which a rela
tive within the country would visit, except
that, because of economics, the visit is a few
years' worth of visits squished into one.
The people at the Immigration and
Naturalization Service may not have un
derstood these things, but, in finalizing the
proposed rule change, should keep them
in mind.
The House of Representatives has al
ready voted to abolish the INS, condemn
ing it as an unsalvageable wreck that must
be replaced, and rightly deciding that its
service and enforcement capacities must
be separated.
But in the twilight of its existence, the
INS is proposing the following: Replace the
base six-month non-immigrant visa with a
visa gcxwJ for the "time needed to accom
plish the trip," with .SO days being the base.
The INS officer who reviews the docu
ments of a visitor at the port of entry will

have the authority to decide, based on the
argument of the visitor, whether a stay
longer than that is "fair and reasonable for
the completion of the purpose of the visit."
So, a visitor and her hosts will know
how long the visitor can stay only after she
has arrived in the country, and the deci
sion will be dependent on how well the vis
itor — who may not know English — can
present her argument to the inspector she
happens to draw.
The proposed rule is vague as is. Clari
fying guidelines will be set, no doubt, but
these types of things cannot be simply
trusted to be resolved in the proper way.
People must speak up before the com
ment period on the rules ends.
For one thing, what exactly does "fair
and reasonable" mean? Will the INS con
sider it reasonable that two grandparents
live with their children and grandchildren
for six months? How will discrepancies be
prevented from arising from one port of
entry to another, or even from one INS of
ficer to another? Do they really expect ev
eryone to be able to articulate t heir case for
an extended stay?
1 hose two grandparents, coming to the
checkpoint exhausted and disoriented
after a 13-hour flight, will just nod at any
thing the officer says. And how can people
pay thousands of dollars in airfare when
they may only get thirty days of visitation
time, just about enough to get over jet lag,
unpack, and then start packing to go back?
Ihe proposed rule change was an
nounced as part of an effort to prevent
"abuse by aliens who seek to plan and exe
cute acts of terrorism."
Everyone agrees that such an effort is
critical: Pradeep Bhatia, a San Mateo man
whose online petition at www.PetitionOn
line.com has collected almost 80,000 sig
natures against the proposal, says, "We
fully support new rules that would logical
ly help the INS fight terrorism." He cor
rectly points out, however, that "a terror
ist needs just one day."
In conversations about the idea, the
word "illogical" is one that comes up a lot:
No terrorist will be put off his plans by the
fact that his visa expires in thirty days.
Another common sentiment is that this
is being done by the INS to make it look
like it is taking bold action, trying to make
up for its recent high-profile failures. In
reality, all the proposal does is deprive the
country of its best ambassadors — for
eigners with American relatives.
The INS should be spending its time
and resources on enforcement of the law,
screening, and tracking of visitors. With
out that, you could restrict visas to one
week and it still would not accomplish any
thing.

sprouting up, with tens and tens of thou
sands of people of all ethnic backgrounds
signing.
The public-comment period on the
proposal ends May 13, with enactment of
a final rule expected this month.
What the INS should do is either issue

clear guidelines stipulating that its inspec
tors grant relatives—even if only ones over
60—six month stays, or, even better, to
create a new visa class that separates out
those visitors who are sponsored by family
members in America from those who real
ly are just tourists.

the international phone-call commercials.
To this group, a change to visa law pro-

posed last month could
be, unless modified, an
unnecessary smack.
The change threatens
to cut back how long visi
tors can stay in t he country
from between six months
and a year to just thirty
days. Perhaps this is not
the most far-reaching of
recent immigration pro-

posals, but it is important to many people
nonetheless. The visa in question is called a
B-2 visitor visa, or more commonly, a tourist
visa — but to many, it is a "family visa."
For example, most people of Indian
background living in the U.S. have
brought parents or other family over from
India for visits. By "visits," I do not mean
three-day reunions where you just show
guests the sights and go out to dinner, but
rather multiple-month stays — which is
what all involved want, and all that can be
justified given the high cost of airfare.
People bring relatives over when there
are health problems. Or if a child is to be
born. Or if they are a working couple and
need someone to help care for the chil
dren. Or if they share responsibility for an
elderly relation. Or for any number of rea
sons, including all those for which a rela
tive within the country would visit, except
that, because of economics, the visit is a few
years' worth of visits squished into one.
The people at the Immigration and
Naturalization Service may not have un
derstood these things, but, in finalizing the
proposed rule change, should keep them
in mind.
The House of Representatives has al
ready voted to abolish the INS, condemn
ing it as an unsalvageable wreck that must
be replaced, and rightly deciding that its
service and enforcement capacities must
be separated.
But in the twilight of its existence, the
INS is proposing the following: Replace the
base six-month non-immigrant visa with a
visa gcxwJ for the "time needed to accom
plish the trip," with .SO days being the base.
The INS officer who reviews the docu
ments of a visitor at the port of entry will

have the authority to decide, based on the
argument of the visitor, whether a stay
longer than that is "fair and reasonable for
the completion of the purpose of the visit."
So, a visitor and her hosts will know
how long the visitor can stay only after she
has arrived in the country, and the deci
sion will be dependent on how well the vis
itor — who may not know English — can
present her argument to the inspector she
happens to draw.
The proposed rule is vague as is. Clari
fying guidelines will be set, no doubt, but
these types of things cannot be simply
trusted to be resolved in the proper way.
People must speak up before the com
ment period on the rules ends.
For one thing, what exactly does "fair
and reasonable" mean? Will the INS con
sider it reasonable that two grandparents
live with their children and grandchildren
for six months? How will discrepancies be
prevented from arising from one port of
entry to another, or even from one INS of
ficer to another? Do they really expect ev
eryone to be able to articulate t heir case for
an extended stay?
1 hose two grandparents, coming to the
checkpoint exhausted and disoriented
after a 13-hour flight, will just nod at any
thing the officer says. And how can people
pay thousands of dollars in airfare when
they may only get thirty days of visitation
time, just about enough to get over jet lag,
unpack, and then start packing to go back?
Ihe proposed rule change was an
nounced as part of an effort to prevent
"abuse by aliens who seek to plan and exe
cute acts of terrorism."
Everyone agrees that such an effort is
critical: Pradeep Bhatia, a San Mateo man
whose online petition at www.PetitionOn
line.com has collected almost 80,000 sig
natures against the proposal, says, "We
fully support new rules that would logical
ly help the INS fight terrorism." He cor
rectly points out, however, that "a terror
ist needs just one day."
In conversations about the idea, the
word "illogical" is one that comes up a lot:
No terrorist will be put off his plans by the
fact that his visa expires in thirty days.
Another common sentiment is that this
is being done by the INS to make it look
like it is taking bold action, trying to make
up for its recent high-profile failures. In
reality, all the proposal does is deprive the
country of its best ambassadors — for
eigners with American relatives.
The INS should be spending its time
and resources on enforcement of the law,
screening, and tracking of visitors. With
out that, you could restrict visas to one
week and it still would not accomplish any
thing.

With word spreading from mailing list
to mailing list, online petitions have been
sprouting up, with tens and tens of thou
sands of people of all ethnic backgrounds
signing.
The public-comment period on the
proposal ends May 13, with enactment of
a final rule expected this month.
What the INS should do is either issue

clear guidelines stipulating that its inspec
tors grant relatives—even if only ones over
60—six month stays, or, even better, to
create a new visa class that separates out
those visitors who are sponsored by family
members in America from those who real
ly are just tourists.
We'll see what the INS does.

Some immigrants came to America
and, faced with the difficulties of
travel, severed all physical ties with
the "old country." Other, more
modern immigrants came while maintain
ing firm links to friends and family still in
the country of origin, and these interna
tional links are, in turn, held by subse
quent generations.
In highly multi-ethnic California, even
more than in the U.S. overall, a healthy seg
ment of the populace is part of such global
ly diffuse clans. We are the ones you see on
