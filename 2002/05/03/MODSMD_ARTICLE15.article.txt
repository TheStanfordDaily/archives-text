Alumnus proposes Web-accessible
Stanford chronology
I extend my deepest apologies for the
errors in my guest column of April Hi,
2002. "To err is human," but to misspell
my mentor's last name— Packard, incor
rect versus Packer, correct — and to de
mote one of Stanford's most pivotal presi
dents — vice provost, incorrect vs.
provost, correct — is a mistake of such
Berkelian proportions, 1 am embarrassed.
From my Stanford education, I found
one can learn from one's mistakes.
Hence, a modest proposal: why not
have a chronology of Stanford prepared
which would be Web accessible. That is, it
would not be a "history," but a listing of
events and persons involved over the insti
tutional life of Stanford.
I believe that the Stanford I listoric Soci
ety has the broad outlines of such a
chronology already. Ii might be as simple
as having it digitized and made accessible
over the Stanford Web page. With such an
innovation, mistakes such as mine could be
easily avoided.
Finally, I think there is some reason to
respectfully disagree — as we have before
— about the source of the "shock" to the
administration over the 1908 faculty vote.
Perhaps side-by-side columns from partic -
ipants to the occasion would provide some
further clarity to your readership.
Again, I apologize for my errors, and
thank President Emeritus Richard Lyman
for his attention to detail.

What next for Sharon?
The intent of this letter is merely to
pose a simple question in regard to the

Middle East debate, and it is my hope that
the answer would be educational for both
me and The Daily's readers.
- Suppose everything goes Sharon's way:
the Israeli military, backed by the United
States, crushes all Palestinian resistance —
or terrorist infrastructure, depending on
your political view — takes control of the
West Bank and Gaza, and Israel continues
its policy of settlement construction and
expansion. The obvious intent behind the
settlement policy is an eventual annexa
tion of the West Bank and Gaza. But what
if this plan succeeded?
Israel would find itself with some 4.5
million Arabs within its own borders. Since
Ariel Sharon would never allow Israel to
become a non-Jewish, or even a mixed
state, he is left with two options: deny vot
ing rights to Arabs, or deport enough
Arabs to ensure ;i large Jewish majority.
Given that the first option is apartheid
and the second option is ethnic cleans
ing, I desperately hope Sharon has a
third, less racist, option that I am not
aware of.
So I ask The Daily's readers to please
educate me if such a third option exists. A
follow-up question is whether Sharon
would at all be likely to choose this third
option.

Wire articles spread lies about Middle East
Now that even Amnesty International,
Human Rights Watch and the Palestini
ans have admitted that in fact there was
no massacre in Jenin, I hope The Daily
will take the lead in accurate reporting.
From reading the newswire articles in
1 he Daily, one gels the notion that there

is no such thing as objective truth. Any
claim, no matter how preposterous, is
given equal credence.
The fact is that there was no massacre in
Jenin. In Jenin, the terrorists fought from
behind civilians whose lives they purpose
fully endagered. Israel showed more con
cern for Palestinian civilians than did the
Palestinians themselves.
To date, The Daily has parroted the
sanies lies spread through the newswires,
which themselves repeat the lies of Pales
tinian officials. The highest officials of the
Palestinian Authority have been spread
ing the blood libel at every opportunity
that there were massacres not only in
Jenin, but in Qalqilya and Tulkarm.
It is time for The Daily to uphold jour
nalistic standards of accountability and re
port the unadulterated and objective
truth: The Palestinian Authority inten
tionally lied to the world — again.
