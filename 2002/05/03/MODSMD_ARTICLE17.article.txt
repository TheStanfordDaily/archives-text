# Congress passes pro-Israel measure
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —Con-
gress clasped Israel in a warm em
brace yesterday, passing resolu
tions of support for the Jewish
state and blessing its recent mili
tary campaign as an attempt at
"dismantling the terrorist infra
structure" in Palestinian territory.
"Let every terrorist know, the
American people will never aban
don freedom, democracy or Is
rael," said Texas Rep lorn DeLay,
shortly before the House voted
overwhelmingly in favor of non
binding legislation. Recent attacks
directed against Israelis, the
House GOP whip added, "are at
tacks against liberty, and all free
people must recognize that Israel's
light is our light."
"Israel has been under siege . .
. from a systematic and deliberate
campaign of suicide and homi
cide attacks by terrorists," said
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, 1)-
Conn., the leading sponsor of the
measure that cleared the Senate.
"Their essence is identical to the
attacks on our country of Sept.
11," he said.
Both measures said the United
States and Israel are "now en
gaged in a common struggle
against terrorism."
But the bill that DeLay, a con
servative who has been outspo
ken in his support of Israel in re

cent months, and Rep. Tom
tos, D-Calif., sent to the House
floor was the more sharply word
ed of the two. It mentioned Pales
tinian leader Yasser Arafat by
name and accused him of an "on
going support of terror" in the
wave of bombings against Israelis
this spring.
The House acted on a stand
alone resolution, passing it by
352-21. Twenty-nine lawmakers
voted present, several of them
saying they had wanted more bal
anced legislation. Lieberman and
Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., of
fered their proposal as an amend
ment to trade legislation. The
vote was 96-2.
Lawmakers, eager to show
solidarity with Israel, have long
chafed at the silence the Bush
administration asked of Con
gress at a time when American
diplomats worked to stave off a
wider outbreak of violence in the
Middle East.
With Israeli troops ending their
military operation on Wednesday,
lifting a siege of Arafat's headquar
ters, the White House gave its
grudging assent to the inevitable.
"The president understands
Congress will speak its mind in a
nonbinding fashion and the presi
dent will respect that," White
House spokesman Ari Fleischer

told reporters.
Referring to the members of
Congress, he added: "The presi
dent understands no foreign policy
can have 535 secretary of states,"
words that seemed to say the ad
ministration was not endorsing the
measures in all their particulars.
Earlier, officials had urged
Lieberman, DeLay and other key
lawmakers to soften some of the
language, and to insert phrases to
express support for Palestinians.
The House bill stated that Is
rael's recent military operations
were "an effort to defend itself
against the unspeakable horrors of
ongoing terrorism and were
aimed only at dismantling the ter
rorist infrastructure in the Pales
tinian areas, an obligation Arafat
himself undertook but failed to
carry out."
The House acceded to two or
three requests from the White
House, adding a provision that
calls on the international commu
nity to "take action to alleviate the
humanitarian needs of the Pales
tinian people."
In the House, some lawmakers
said a more balanced approach
would have been preferable.
"Resolutions like this can very
well backfire and actually hurt Is
rael more so than it will help," said
Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas.
