# House approves agriculture bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The House over
whelmingly approved yesterday an election-year
farm bill Thursday that will pour billions of dollars
in subsidies into Midwestern and Southern states
that are political battlegrounds for lawmakers in
both parties.
The bill, which would boost subsidies by 70 per
cent, marks a reversal of the 1996 Freedom to Farm
law that was supposed to wean farmers from gov
ernment subsidies.
The Senate is expected to pass the measure
next week and send it to President Bush for his
signature.
Shortly before the House's 280-141 vote, Bush
said the bill was not everything he wanted but will
"help ensure the immediate and long-term viabili
ty of our farm economy."
"We all know that Freedom to Farm didn't
work," said Rep. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo. "While
no farmer wants to depend on the government for
anything, it is critical that we provide a safety net to
our producers."
The bill, which has broad support among major
farm groups, would authorize $180 billion in
spending over the next 10 years, a $73.5 billion in
crease over existing programs.
An 80 percent increase in land-conservation
programs will benefit livestock farms and fruit and
vegetable growers who historically have received
little federal cash.
"We're going back to a strong government pres
ence in agriculture," said Luther Tweeten, an agri
cultural economist at Ohio State University. "It cer
tainly gives some security to farmers. It comes at a
very high cost to taxpayers and to the national

economy, however."
The political implications were huge. Several
major form states probably will have close Senate
races this fall, including Arkansas, Georgia, lowa,
Minnesota and South Dakota.
Bush will need to retain the solid support he re
ceived in 2000 across the Plains and South if he
seeks re-election in 2004.
"Throw in an important election season and it
makes it very difficult" to stop big subsidies, said
Rep. Ron Kind, I)-Wis. "It's been a bad process and
it's resulted in bad policy."
Economists say the subsidies are likely to en
courage overproduction of crops and inflate land
rents, which raises costs for farmers who do not own
their own land. Bush's support for the bill repre
sented a switch from his administration's earlier
criticism of farm subsidies that the legislation con
tinues and expands.
The bill's increased subsidies have angered for
eign competitors. The European Union said
Thursday it was considering a challenge of the pay
ments before the World Trade Organization.
Under WTO limits, certain U.S. farm subsidies can
not exceed $19.1 billion annually. The bill autho
rizes the Agriculture Department to adjust subsi
dies to stay within the cap.
"The United States is increasing trade-distorting
support for (American) farmers that will harm de
veloping countries. This is what we are fiercely op
posed to," EU spokesman Gregor Kreuzhuber said.
Canada's agriculture minister, Lyle Vanclief,
said the higher subsidies will be a "serious blow to
the U.S.' credibility" during the next round of
world trade negotiations.
