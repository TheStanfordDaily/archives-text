## Card hopes to grin and bear Cal series 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Wednesday night was a chance for the now-
No. 9 Cardinal — the same team that was No.
1 just a month ago — to build on their 13-0
blowout at Oregon State last Sunday and to re
gain the form that made it the nation's most
impressive team for the first three months of
the season.
Instead, it turned out to be Stanford's most
embarrassing performance yet in what has
been an awful two-week stretch of baseball for
the Cardinal.
The San Jose State Spartans (36-13, 14-7
Western Athletic Conference) rode an im
pressive complete-game shutout from se
nior Jeremy Rogelstad to thoroughly domi
nate Stanford (29-13, 6-6 Pacific 10 Confer
ence), 12-0, in a non-conference game at
Municipal Stadium in San Jose and to de
flate any optimism arising from Sunday's
encouraging win.
While Rogelstad was excellent on the hill, it
was difficult to tell whether his success was
due more to his own performance or to an
anemic Cardinal lineup. Wednesday marked
the third time in Stanford's last four games
that it failed to score more than three runs
and was the second time the Cardinal went
scoreless this season.
"Sometimes you can justify poor hitting with
dominant pitching, but that hasn't been the
case this year as much," said head coach Mark
Marquess said. "Hopefully we can improve
upon our timely hitting and get more produc -
tion out of our hits."
In addition to silencing the Stanford bats,
the Spartans exposed the Cardinal bullpen as
the most pressing issue for Marquess's ballclub.

San Jose State scored 12 runs during a 15-hit
barrage against eight different Stanford
hurlers.
Freshman Mark Jecman's struggles contin
ued, as he allowed three straight singles to start
the ballgame. He recorded only two outs and
gave up two more hits and a walk before Mar
quess pulled him in favor of fellow freshman
Johnny Dyer.
Jecman, slated in the preseason as the Car
dinal's third starter, is now 0-4 with an 8.87
ERA in what has been an extremely disap
pointing freshman campaign.
Rather than an aberration, Jecman's poor
start was only a harbinger of things to come
Wednesday night as only two of the eight Car
dinal pitchers did not allow a run.
San Jose State won its 10th game in its last 11
and its first against Stanford since Feb. 29,
2000. The Spartans are still unranked in the
major polls but have put together an impressive
season thus far, and they could be rewarded
with a postseason berth close to home when
playoff pairings are announced at the end of
this month.
For the Cardinal, however, the postseason
is the least of its concerns. With California

(26-23, 8-10 Pac-10) coming to Sunken Dia
mond fora must-win set of league games this
weekend, Stanford has little time to straight
en out the weaknesses that have plagued the
ballclub of late.
"You obviously worry about [the postseason]
a little bit because you'd love to win the league,
and you'd love to play at home in Regionals and
Super Regionals," Marquess said. "But it
doesn't do much good to worry about it. You
can't spend a lot of time thinking about it be
cause all that matters is how we play in our re
maining games."
Stanford took two of three at Evans Dia
mond in Berkeley in an early-March non
conference series, but anything short of a se
ries sweep this time around would damage its
chance for any serious contention for the
Pac-10 title. The Cardinal, currently tied for
fourth and 3 1/2 games behind Southern Cal
ifornia, hosts three of its last four conference
series and could make a run at the top of the
standings, but it must begin tonight against
the Bears.
In a tactical move, Bears head coach
David Esquer jumbled his rotation and will
throw his ace, senior Trevor Hutchinson, to
morrow instead of tonight. Therefore,
tonight at 6:00 p.m., Stanford junior Jeremy
Guthrie faces right-hander Brent Hale. Hale
did not pitch against Stanford in March but
is 2-3 with a 5.74 ERA. Guthrie suffered his
first loss in 17 starts last week against Oregon
State, despite allowing just three runs in a
complete game.
Tomorrow at 1:00 p.m., Stanford hopes to
repeat its performance against Hutchinson
from earlier this season, when it managed six

Hutchinson, who will make his

Cardinal bats.
Hutchinson will face junior

tough-luck loss against the Bears
in a 2-1 defeat in March.

his 2002 success against the Bears'
former closer, Matt Brown.
