# New bill restricts some student visas
## 
### ALI ALEMOZAFAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A bill passed by the U.S. Senate
two weeks ago that limits student
visas may affect the admission of in
ternational students at colleges
across the nation.
The Congressional measure
puts restrictions on visas to stu
dents from Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya,
Syria, Sudan and North Korea —
countries the U.S. State Depart
ment deems to be terrorist-spon
soring states. The bill does not re
strict regular immigrants from
those countries.
John Pearson, director of the
Bechtel International Center, dis
cussed his thoughts on the bill.
"Background checks will be im
plemented for anyone from these
countries," Pearson said. "My hope
is that there won't be a full-out de
nial of visas...just the back
ground checks."
The U.S. secretary of state will
have the ability to grant a waiver to
those not considered a risk to na
tional security.
The bill was passed with an
unanimous vote by the Senate
and now awaits President George
W. Bush's approval before be
coming law.
Dubbed the Enhanced Border
Security and Visa Entry Reform
Act, the bill was proposed when it
was discovered that one of the hi
jackers had come to the U.S. on a
student visa.
This man, who was not a na
tional ofany of the seven countries
on the State Department list,
never actually arrived on his col
lege campus.
According to Pearson, the ob
jective now is to reach a compro
mise whereby students from these
countries won't be denied entry if

they have undergone and passed
sufficient background checks.
It is unclear what the final
process will be for determining visa
issuance to students from the seven
countries, Pearson added. He
speculates that "there won't be a
visa denial for students from these
countries ... the process will just
take longer."
Pearson said that there are
more Iranian students now at
Stanford than students from any
other of the seven countries tar
geted by the bill. Therefore, they
will probably be more affected
than any other group.
University President John Hen
nessy also discussed how the bill
may affect Stanford.
"Since several departments ac
cept a number of students from
these countries, [some of] our pro
grams will be significantly weak
ened if these students can no
longer enter the country," Hen
nessy said.
Jim Plummer, dean of the
School of Engineering, shared how
he thought the new bill could affect
his department. ,
"Many of our engineering de
partments have been accepting
students from some of these coun
tries . . . [the bill] will certainly
have an impact on those depart
ments and therefore on the
school," Plummer said.
fhe bill will require the State
and Justice Departments to closely
monitor students' arrivals, enroll
ment into classes as well as their
dropping out.
"We're going to have to use
this — I don't like this word —
tracking system to report data on
all foreign students," Pearson said.
If the bill becomes law, universities
will be asked to report foreign stu
dents not showing up for classes to
immigration authorities.
The University will offer its sup
port for students already here

from these seven countries, Hen
nessy said.
"We will, of course, tiy to con
tinue to work with students here to
ensure that they will be able to con
tinue their studies," Hennessy said.
"Stanford stands very firm with
students coming to study from any
of these countries," Pearson
added.
