# Track to host meet, then to meet rivals
## 
### DANIEL URBAN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's track and field ath
letes will have the privilege of com
peting against some of the world's
premier athletes at Friday night's
Cardinal Invitational.

TRACK AND FIELD

Friday: Cardinal Invitational,
4:00 p.m., Stanford Stadium

Saturday: Big Meet, Stanford
vs. California, All Day, Berkeley

With little time to recover from
an evening with the most intense
competition they will see all year,
the Cardinal will then travel to
California for the Big Meet on Sat
urday.
Stanford will be in elite compa
ny at the invitational, as a formi
dable international field will com
pete alongside some of America's
best collegiate and professional
athletes.
Last year's invitational lived up
to all its hype and then some.
Med Keflizighi set the American
record in the 10 kilometers with a
time of 27 minutes, 13.98 seconds,
finishing fourth in the race.
Three Kenyans finished ahead

of the fastest man in American his
tory, the winner running the
fastest 10 kilometer time ever run
on American soil (or synthetic track
surface) — 27:04.20.
Keflizighi will return in the 10K
this year, running again against the
powerful Kenyans such as Luke
Kipkosgei, who placed second this
year at the World Cross Country
Championships.
While the men's 10K premises
to be blisteringly fast, the race with
the highest stakes will be the
women's 10K.
One of the strongest fields in
American history, including Deena
Drossin and Kim Kitchen, has been
assembled to take down Lynn Jen
nings' 10-year-old American
record time of 31:19.82.
Expect record crowds to cheer
the women on, partly for the sake
of seeing a record time, but also
for the free Jamba Juice they will
receive if the American record
falls.
With last year's record perfor
mances at the invitational, and an
equally strong field assembled for
this year's event, Stanford has put
itself on the international track and
field map.

On the road, in the desert, somewhere
Softball will look to break a nine-game conference losing skid
in Arizona tfiis weekend.
The prestigious meets keep
rolling into Cobb Track, as Stan
ford will host the USA National
Track and Field Championships
on June 8, with the likes of three
time gold medal winner Marion
Jones competing.
The action continues on Satur
day with the Big Meet, Stanford's
annual dual meet with rival Cal.
Having competed in the Cardi
nal Invitational merely hours be
forehand will certainly leave many
Stanford athletes weary, but track
and field director Vin Lananna in
sists that defeating Cal will be a
priority.
Fora team that won the nation
al title in 2000, taking down Cal
would not seem a terribly difficult
task for the Cardinal, but this is
hardly the case.
The NCAA Championship
meet can be won on the strength
of a few individuals, but winning
a dual meet or conference title
requires depth across all events.
Cal's strength in the jumps,
sprints, throws and hurdles will
make every point count in what
will likely be a very close contest.
This year's Cardinal men's
team is looking stronger and
deeper than even last year's,
which edged Cal 82-81 in a dra
matic finish.

The 2001 Big Meet ultimately
came down to the final minutes for
the men, as the final attempts in the
triple jump determined the victor.
Junior Milton Little and senior
Warrick McDowell both jumped
their personal best marks when
they were needed most. Little's
jump of 49 feet, 6.25 inches and
McDowell's 48-10.75 gave them
second a third place, respectively,
and brought the score to 82-76 in
Stanford's favor.
The final event of the day, the
4x400 meters, worth live points,
was irrelevant as the Cardinal's six
point lead clinched the meet. The
Stanford victory begins a long
process of catching up to Cal,
which owns 21 more victories than
the Cardinal over the meet's 108-
year history.
The Stanford women easily dis
pensed with the Bears last year
101.5 to 60.5 and will look fora re
peat victory this weekend.
The Cardinal women have won
the last four of five Big Meets and
lead the series 12-10.
Barring the NCAA Champi
onship, the Cardinal Invitation
al and Big Meet will likely make
for the most exciting, action
packed weekend of Stanford
track this year.
Admission to the Invitational is
free with an Stanford ID, and fans
can make the short trip across the
Bay for Big Meet, held at Cal's Ed
wards Stadium.

record time of 31:19.82.
Expect record crowds to cheer
the women on, partly for the sake
of seeing a record time, but also
for the free Jamba Juice they will
receive if the American record
falls.
With last year's record perfor
mances at the invitational, and an
equally strong field assembled for
this year's event, Stanford has put
itself on the international track and
field map.

On the road, in the desert, somewhere
Softball will look to break a nine-game conference losing skid
in Arizona tfiis weekend.
The prestigious meets keep
rolling into Cobb Track, as Stan
ford will host the USA National
Track and Field Championships
on June 8, with the likes of three
time gold medal winner Marion
Jones competing.
The action continues on Satur
day with the Big Meet, Stanford's
annual dual meet with rival Cal.
Having competed in the Cardi
nal Invitational merely hours be
forehand will certainly leave many
Stanford athletes weary, but track
and field director Vin Lananna in
sists that defeating Cal will be a
priority.
Fora team that won the nation
al title in 2000, taking down Cal
would not seem a terribly difficult
task for the Cardinal, but this is
hardly the case.
The NCAA Championship
meet can be won on the strength
of a few individuals, but winning
a dual meet or conference title
requires depth across all events.
Cal's strength in the jumps,
sprints, throws and hurdles will
make every point count in what
will likely be a very close contest.
This year's Cardinal men's
team is looking stronger and
deeper than even last year's,
which edged Cal 82-81 in a dra
matic finish.

The 2001 Big Meet ultimately
came down to the final minutes for
the men, as the final attempts in the
triple jump determined the victor.
Junior Milton Little and senior
Warrick McDowell both jumped
their personal best marks when
they were needed most. Little's
jump of 49 feet, 6.25 inches and
McDowell's 48-10.75 gave them
second a third place, respectively,
and brought the score to 82-76 in
Stanford's favor.
The final event of the day, the
4x400 meters, worth live points,
was irrelevant as the Cardinal's six
point lead clinched the meet. The
Stanford victory begins a long
process of catching up to Cal,
which owns 21 more victories than
the Cardinal over the meet's 108-
year history.
The Stanford women easily dis
pensed with the Bears last year
101.5 to 60.5 and will look fora re
peat victory this weekend.
The Cardinal women have won
the last four of five Big Meets and
lead the series 12-10.
Barring the NCAA Champi
onship, the Cardinal Invitation
al and Big Meet will likely make
for the most exciting, action
packed weekend of Stanford
track this year.
Admission to the Invitational is
free with an Stanford ID, and fans
can make the short trip across the
Bay for Big Meet, held at Cal's Ed
wards Stadium.
