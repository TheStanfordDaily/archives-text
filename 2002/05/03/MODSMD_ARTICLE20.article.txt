Stanford's track and field ath
letes will have the privilege of com
peting against some of the world's
premier athletes at Friday night's
Cardinal Invitational.

TRACK AND FIELD

Friday: Cardinal Invitational,
4:00 p.m., Stanford Stadium

Saturday: Big Meet, Stanford
vs. California, All Day, Berkeley

With little time to recover from
an evening with the most intense
competition they will see all year,
the Cardinal will then travel to
California for the Big Meet on Sat
urday.
Stanford will be in elite compa
ny at the invitational, as a formi
dable international field will com
pete alongside some of America's
best collegiate and professional
athletes.
Last year's invitational lived up
to all its hype and then some.
Med Keflizighi set the American
record in the 10 kilometers with a
time of 27 minutes, 13.98 seconds,
finishing fourth in the race.
Three Kenyans finished ahead

of the fastest man in American his
tory, the winner running the
fastest 10 kilometer time ever run
on American soil (or synthetic track
surface) â€” 27:04.20.
Keflizighi will return in the 10K
this year, running again against the
powerful Kenyans such as Luke
Kipkosgei, who placed second this
year at the World Cross Country
Championships.
While the men's 10K premises
to be blisteringly fast, the race with
the highest stakes will be the
women's 10K.
One of the strongest fields in
American history, including Deena
Drossin and Kim Kitchen, has been
assembled to take down Lynn Jen
nings' 10-year-old American
record time of 31:19.82.
Expect record crowds to cheer
the women on, partly for the sake
of seeing a record time, but also
for the free Jamba Juice they will
receive if the American record
falls.
With last year's record perfor
mances at the invitational, and an
equally strong field assembled for
this year's event, Stanford has put
itself on the international track and
field map.
