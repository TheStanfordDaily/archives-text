CHICAGO (AP)— Mike
Cameron hit four home runs
Thursday night, tying a major
league record and becoming only
the 13th player to accomplish the
feat.
Cameron connected in his first
four at-bats for the Seattle
Mariners at Chicago, doing it in
just five innings.
In his next at-bat in the seventh
inning, he was hit by a pitch from
White Sox reliever Mike Porzio in
the back of the left thigh, drawing
boos from the crowd at Comiskey
Park.
Cameron began the night with
five home runs in 91 at-bats. Until
this game, the 2001 All-Star and
Gold Glove winner was known
more for his leaping catches in
center field — and for being trad
ed for Ken Griffey Jr.
Mark Whiten was the last play
er to homer four times in a game,
doing it on Sept. 7, 1993, for St.
Louis in the second game of a dou
bleheader. Rocky Colavito was the
last to do it in the AL, on June 10,
1959, for Cleveland.
Cameron began his historic
night by joining with Bret Boone
to become the first teammates ever
to both hit two home runs in the
same inning. They connected
back-to-back twice in a 10-run first
against Chicago.

Cameron hit a solo shot in
the third inning, and added an
other solo homer with two outs
in the fifth.
After hitting his fourth homer
to make it 13-1, Cameron round
ed the bases with a big grin on his
face. He slapped hands with third
base coach Dave Myers and got a
big hug from teammate Ruben
Sierra after he crossed home plate.
With the crowd giving him a
standing ovation, Cameron head
ed to the dugout as the rest of the
Mariners came out to greet him.
Cameron, 29, started his major
league career with the White Sox
in 1995 and joined Cincinnati in
1999. After one season with the
Reds, he was traded to Seattle as
part of the deal for Griffey.
Last year, Cameron hit a ca
reer-high 25 home runs. He had
never hit more than two homers in
a game until Thursday night.
Cameron's first home run of
the night came against Jon Ranch,
a drive on a 1 -2 pitch to center. 1 Ie
connected again in the first inning
off reliever Jim Parque, a full
count shot to center.
In the third, Cameron hit an 0-
1 pitch from Parque over the left
field fence. He homered again off
Parque in the fifth, launching a 2-
1 pitch to center.
Cameron, Boone and the
Mariners made history right from
the start.
After Ichiro Suzuki was hit by a
pitch leading off the game, Boone
and Cameron homered. Two
outs later, Boone and Cameron
did it again.
There had only been 39 previ
ous occasions of a player hitting
two home runs in an inning, ac
cording to the Elias Sports Bu
reau. Eric Karros was last to do it,
on Aug. 22, 2000, for Los Angeles.
Mark McGwire was the previous
AL player to do it, on Sept.
22,1996, for Oakland.

Boone and Cameron became
the first Mariners to homer twice
in an inning.
Hoping to generate more runs
after losing three straight,
Mariners manager Lou Piniella
shuffled his lineup fbi the game.
Boone, who led the AL in RBIs last
season, was bumped up to No. 2 in
the order and Cameron was
moved to No. 3.
It was the second lime in team
history the Mariners have hit four
home runs in one inning. The first
time was on Sept. 21, 1996, in the
third inning against Oakland.
Alex Rodriguez had been the
last Seattle player to homer three
times in a game, doing it at Toron
to on April 16, 2000.
Houston's Lance Berkman hit
three homers on April 16 at
Cincinnati.
