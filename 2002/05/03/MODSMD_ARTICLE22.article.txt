# Ultimate teams earn berths to nationals

### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
With only two national championships to
Stanford's name so far this school year, Cardi
nal boosters may be getting concerned that
Stanford has lost its touch at bringing titles
home to the Farm.
But forget varsity sports. Stanford's men's
and women's Ultimate teams are ready to put
such fears to rest.
Bloodthirsty and Superfly — the men's and
women's teams, respectively — both took first
at last weekend's Northwest Kegionals in Santa
Cruz to earn bids the Ultimate Players Associa
tion College Championships, which will be held
in Spokane, Wash., from May 24 to May 26.
Superfly outscored its opponents by a lop
sided 105-21 margin in seven matches last
weekend. The depth of the Stanford squad —
with 13 players returning from last year's na
tional runner-up crew — proved to be one of
the biggest deciding factors over the weekend.
"We aren't a team with a few stars. We are a
group of great players and it's hard to stand
out too much," said senior Erin Percival, the

team's nominee for the Callahan Award, which
is given to the nation's best player.
"We have so many great players that we are
able to rest our top ones and save them for the
big games later in the tournament.," Percival
added.
Superfly cruised through pool play on Sat
urday, losing only six points in posting easy
wins over Stanford B, Pacific Lutheran, Hum
boldt State and UC-Santa Cruz.
After blowing by Washington, 15-3, in Sun
day's quarterfinal, Superfly got its first real
competition of the weekend in the semifinals
against UC-Davis. The Pleiades gave Stanford
a scare with a mid-game 4-0 run, but Superfly
held on fora 15-7 win.
In the finals, Superfly squared off with an
Oregon squad that it had split two matches
with earlier in the season.
Oregon took an early 4-2 lead as Superfly
struggled to contain the Oregon offense in
windy conditions. But a switch in Stanford's
defensive strategy did the trick, and Superfly
went on a 6-0 run to take an 8-2 lead into half
time. Superfly stayed hot defensively in the sec
ond half, outscoring Oregon, 7-1, to close out

a 15-5 win for the title.
" The team in general is very inexperienced.
Only the three captains | Percival, senior Jamie
Nuvver and junior Gwen Ambler] have more
than a full season of experience," Ambler said.
"However, this fact is working to our advan
tage because our learning curve is exponential
and we are going to be able to surprise teams at
nationals who have been tapering and have al
ready reached their peak."
For Bloodthirsty, the regionals were all
about redemption. A loss to Oregon in the
regional finals last year left Stanford out of
the national tournament for the first time
since 1993.
Bloodthirsty's focus on getting back to na
tionals was reinforced by a good scare from
Humboldt State in the team's second game of
the tournament. The Buds forced a number of
early Stanford turnovers in the windy condi
tions and opened a daunting 11-6 lead.
But Bloodthirsty put on a defensive dis
play the rest of the way, getting a pair of key
blocks from both junior Bart Watson and
