Terrorist attacks cast shadow over campus
Ten days after the most devastating acts of terrorism
America has ever seen, the Stanford community is
gearing up to begin a new year filled with challenges
and emotions that no one could have predicted just
weeks ago.
The Sept. 11 attacks — in which hijackers seized
control over four U.S. commercial jetliners, crashed
two into New York's World Trade Center towers, one
into the Pentagon and one outside Pittsburgh, Pa.—re
duced the Twin Towers to rubble, leveled a major sec
tion of the national military headquarters and have
claimed as many as 3,000 lives
No University students, faculty or staff are known to
have been killed or injured in the attacks. Still, the inci
dents undeniably cast a pall over the campus last week,
resulting in a mood that Dean of Religious Life Rev.
Scotty McLennan described as a combination of
"shock, grief, confusion and fear."

Clark withholds $60 million
In response to a stem-cell research policy he said was
"driven by ignorance, conservative thinking and fear of
die unknown," Netscape founder and former Stanford
professor Jim Clark recently announced that he would
withhold $60 million of the $ 150 million he pledged in
1999 to donate the University. In an Aug. 31, 2001
New York Times editorial, Clark wrote that he had "re

luctantly decided to suspend further contributions
until our lawmakers decide to pursue what I believe to
be a rational course in this vital part of our national fu
ture." Clark's landmark gift to Stanford was to fund the
Bio-X program, an interdisciplinary initiative designed
to "bring together faculty from a variety of disciplines
who share one common goal — to interact in a man
ner [that] maximize[s] the mutual impact of biology,
chemistry, physics, physics, engineering and medicine
on one another," according to the program's Web site.
