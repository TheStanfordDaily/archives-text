Terrorist attacks cast shadow over campus
Ten days after the most devastating acts of terrorism
America has ever seen, the Stanford community is
gearing up to begin a new year filled with challenges
and emotions that no one could have predicted just
weeks ago.
The Sept. 11 attacks — in which hijackers seized
control over four U.S. commercial jetliners, crashed
two into New York's World Trade Center towers, one
into the Pentagon and one outside Pittsburgh, Pa.—re
duced the Twin Towers to rubble, leveled a major sec
tion of the national military headquarters and have
claimed as many as 3,000 lives
No University students, faculty or staff are known to
have been killed or injured in the attacks. Still, the inci
dents undeniably cast a pall over the campus last week,
resulting in a mood that Dean of Religious Life Rev.
Scotty McLennan described as a combination of
"shock, grief, confusion and fear."

Clark withholds $60 million
In response to a stem-cell research policy he said was
"driven by ignorance, conservative thinking and fear of
die unknown," Netscape founder and former Stanford
professor Jim Clark recently announced that he would
withhold $60 million of the $ 150 million he pledged in
1999 to donate the University. In an Aug. 31, 2001
New York Times editorial, Clark wrote that he had "re

luctantly decided to suspend further contributions
until our lawmakers decide to pursue what I believe to
be a rational course in this vital part of our national fu
ture." Clark's landmark gift to Stanford was to fund the
Bio-X program, an interdisciplinary initiative designed
to "bring together faculty from a variety of disciplines
who share one common goal — to interact in a man
ner [that] maximize[s] the mutual impact of biology,
chemistry, physics, physics, engineering and medicine
on one another," according to the program's Web site.

University slashes
Latin American Studies
After a series of probationary
measures and delays in evaluating

the program, the University has de
cided to significantly scale back the
academic offerings of the Center for
Latin American Studies because of a
perceived lack of faculty support.
Beginning this year, the center
will no longer be permitted to offer
bachelor's or master's degrees, but
the honors progr am and die center
itself will be preserved. Students
who have already declared Latin
American Studies can continue
their coursework and receive their
degrees.

Grads surveyed
The Graduate Student Coun
cil recently released the results of
an online survey on quality-of-life
issues for Stanford's graduate
students.
The Web-based survey was im
plemented in November and re
ceived 2,091 responses, represent
ing approximately 28 percent of the
graduate-student population.
"Students feel their quality of
life is greatly compromised by,
first, a labyrinthine process by
which to obtain housing, which
many students report to be ex
tremely disruptive to their stud
ies, and on top of that extremely
offensive; second, the lack of af
fordable heath care — especially
for dependents and children —
with benefits and cost structures
equal to those available from em
ployers if the students were work
ing; third, the extremely high
costs and low availability of child
care, and the general child-un
friendly manner of child care ser
vices and the campus in general;
[and] fourth, the lack of parking
available for off-campus stu
dents," said Ray Rivera, a second
year doctoral candidate in the
School of Education and financial
director of the GSC.

Band suspended from Pac-lOs
The Stanford Band was placed
on travel suspension last week after
alcohol containers were found in
the Band Shak, said Assoc Dean of
Students Morris Graves.
"The Band has [been suspend
ed] because they flagrandy violated

die alcohol probation that had been
put on them," Graves said.
At least one keg and many
empty bottles of beer were found
by custodial staff inside the Band
Shak on Thursday morning after a
party, said Graves. The alcohol was
related to the selection of the new
Tree mascot for the 2002-2003
school year.

Division settles language
controversy
The Division of Literatures, Cul
tures, and Languages recently
adopted a policy aimed at main
taining the independence of its de
partments while enhancing coordi
nation between them. This decision
ends several months of debate over
whether the University's foreign
language and literature depart
ments should be consolidated into
one larger unit.
In addition to creating a more
cooperative structure within the di
vision, the plan also creates a re
search unit to help faculty mem
bers coordinate activities and pro
cure funding.
The acceptance of this proposal

has also allowed the division to move
forward with the search for two new
faculty members — a process that
was frozen last spring when plans for
a complete merger of the depart
ments were put on hold.

Stanford reaches out
to community
Stanford has been celebrating its
founders for over 100 years. Yester
day. though, the celebration of the
Stanford family became Communi
ty Day for the first time. In recogni

community heard from Jane Stan
ford herself—by way of a time cap
sule planted by Stanford in 1898
and found in 2001 during the ren
ovation of Building 160.
The campus was full of cultural,
academic and athletic events free
for the public. The celebration
began at 10 a.m. with a special ser
vice at Memorial Church and ran
for five hours before the closing
Founders' Celebration took place at
the Mausoleum.
The capsule contained two
Bibles, University coursebooks, a se
ries of 1898 U.S. coins, assorted

newspapers, a long letter from jane
Stanford describing the disputes
over Leland Stanford's estate, a pho
tograph of Thomas Welton Stan
ford, who gave his inheritance to the
University, a hymn, University en
trance examinations, commence
ment programs and a crucifix.

Seniors stressed out
over job search
Senior Misty Espinoza sighed as
she scrolled through the most re
cent postings on the Monstertrak
Web site. Espinoza, a double major
in communication and drama,
scours the online employment bul
letin board every day in the hopes
of finding a post-graduation job in
public relations or advertising.
"As graduation gets closer and
closer, my stress level increases.
Things are very competitive right
now and that puts a lot of pressure
on a person," Espinoza said.
Seniors this year are entering the
toughest job market since the last
major recession in 1991, according
to Career Development Center Di
rector Lance Choy.
