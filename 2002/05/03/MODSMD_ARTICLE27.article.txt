### VAUHINI VARA EDITORIAL STAFF 
National Security Advisor and
former provost Condoleezza
Rice will speak at this year's
Commencement.
After an extensive online nomi
nation process that took place at the
beginning of fell quarter, senior
class presidents Tai-Li Chang,
Shiao Chien, Serge Kassardjian
and Nicholas Larson recommend
ed Rice to University President
John Hennessy, along with 24
other candidates, including such
figures as President George W.
Bush, Tony Blair, Nelson Mandela,

Maya Angelou, Salman Rushdie
and the Dalai Lama.
Hennessy consulted with the
Board of Trustees to select Rice
from the list of nominees.
"This is an inspired recommen
dation and it gives me great plea
sure to accept it," Hennessy said.
"Professor Rice is not only someone
who has a central place on the
world stage, she has a long-standing
relationship with the University
and a deep loyalty to its students,
faculty and staff."
Rice joined the Stanford faculty in
1981 and was appointed provost in
1993. After 18 years at the Universi
ty, she left in 1999, at the end of this
year's senior class's freshman year.
Rice has since gone on to became
the assistant to the president for na
tional security affairs â€” commonly
referred to as the national security
advisor.
Kassardjian said that the class
presidents were extremely pleased
that Rice accepted the invitation to
deliver the Commencement address.
"Hie events of [Sept. 11 ] will for
ever frame our senior year," Kas
sardjian said. "We wanted a speak
er who would be able to talk about
that day with authority and per
spective. We ran think of no better
way to end the year than with the
observations and advice of a leader

who figures so prominently in con
fronting the issues of our time."
Larson agreed. "We are the first
Stanford class to graduate after the
tragic events took place and our
world was re-shaped," he said.
"Condi's incredible influence over
world events and her position as na
tional security advisor place her in
an excellent position to share with
us her thoughts about [Sept. 11]
and the ever-changing world in
front of us."
Larson also mentioned Rice's
achievements during her time as
provost. "We know that she is a
great speaker because we were wel
comed by her in 1998 as outgoing
provost," he said. "Her last year
here was our first and we were able
to get to know her and her amazing
talents during that year."
"Her achievements and great
warmth made a tremendous im
pression on us," Larson added.
"The profound events of the last
five months have made it clear that
we are not alone in the pride we
take in her leadership."
Senior Max Spevack said that
the class presidents and Hennessy
have made an "excellent decision."
"Not only is she an eminent na
tional figure, but she is well-loved
by the Stanford community," Spe
vack said. "I don't think you could
find a better person for Stanford, in
terms of connection to the Univer
sity and national prominence."
Rice's colleagues agreed.
"There is nobody more firmly
identified with Stanford or some
one who knows and champions her
Stanford affiliations," said Michael
McFaul, a research fellow at the
Hoover Institution and assistant
professor of political science. "So
given the times, it would be hard for
me to think of a more appropriate
speaker for Commencement than
Condi Rice."
"My expectation is that she
would do an excellent job," said
Economics Prof . Roger Noll.
Noll acknowledged that the se
lection of such a politically visible
figure may be controversial, but
maintained that Rice is "a great
choice."
"I hope everyone [will] welcome
her warmly and treat her with re
spect," Noll said.
"It should be fascinating," said
Martin Anderson, a senior fellow at
the Hoover Institution who has
known Rice for several years. "Most
Commencement speeches aren't
that memorable, but this is one I'll
come to."
