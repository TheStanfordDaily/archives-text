Football climbs to No. 6 in BCS poll
After beating two top-five teams, Oregon
and UCLA, back to back in the nation's tough
est conference, Stanford leapfrogged eight
spots in the Bowl Championship Series (BCS)
rankings to No. 6, with 14.57 points (like in golf,
lower scores are better).
After leaping to No. 10 in the Associated
Press poll and No. 13 in the ESPN / USA Today
coaches poll, the Cardinal (5-1) was boosted by
its strength of schedule, computer rankings
and quality wins over the Bruins (6-1) and the
Ducks (7-1), ranked ninth and lOth, respective
ly, in the BCS.
The Cardinal's climb from No. 14 to No. 6
in the BCS was the most substantial move of
the week.

Dettamanti finishes as NCAA champ
Dante Dettamanti had little time to take
his shoes off before jumping into the pool to
celebrate his retirement gift — a national
championship.
Last weekend's NCAA Championship,
hosted by top-ranked Stanford, crowned a
stellar season for the men's water polo team,
which finished with a record of 22-1 and its
ninth national title. The 8-5 victory in Sun
day's final game over two-time defending
national champion UCLA was Dettamanti's
last hurrah after 25 years as Stanford's head
coach.
For the four seniors on the squad, this was a
last shot at the national title after narrowly miss
ing it twice. The Cardinal finished as the run
ner-up in both 1998 and 1999.
"We lost my freshman and sophomore years
and 1 got a taste of that, but I really wanted a
taste of this. And it's bloody good," senior Onno
Koelman said.

Women's volleyball claims fifth national title
For most teams, just playing in the Final
Four would be pressure enough.
But not for the Stanford women's volley
ball team.
For the Cardinal, after a season full of re
markable comebacks, no championship run
would have been complete without having to
dig out of a few more holes.
So, true to style, the Cardinal fell into a pair
of seemingly hopeless situations in the first
two games of its NCAA semifinal match
against defending champion Nebraska on
Dec. 13. And then it did it again in the first
game against top-seeded Long Beach State in

the championship match on Dec. 15.
True to style, the Stanford squad somehow
prevailed.
Now the Cardinal will raise another nation
al championship banner in Maples Pavilion.
Stanford (33-2) posted an improbable 3-0
win over the Cornhuskers (31-2) in the semifi
nals and then ended the 49ers' (33-1) hopes of
an undefeated season with a stunning 3-0 win
in the finals to claim the Cardinal's fifth NCAA
crown.

Late Heel comeback knocks off Cardinal
COLUMBUS, OHIO—How much dif
ference can one minute make in a 22-game
season?
Enough to keep it from being a 23-game na
tional championship season, as the Stanford
men's soccer team learned after falling to even
tual champion North Carolina in the NCAA
College Cup semifinals, held on Dec. 14.
