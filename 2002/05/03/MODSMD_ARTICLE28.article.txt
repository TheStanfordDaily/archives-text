Football climbs to No. 6 in BCS poll
After beating two top-five teams, Oregon
and UCLA, back to back in the nation's tough
est conference, Stanford leapfrogged eight
spots in the Bowl Championship Series (BCS)
rankings to No. 6, with 14.57 points (like in golf,
lower scores are better).
After leaping to No. 10 in the Associated
Press poll and No. 13 in the ESPN / USA Today
coaches poll, the Cardinal (5-1) was boosted by
its strength of schedule, computer rankings
and quality wins over the Bruins (6-1) and the
Ducks (7-1), ranked ninth and lOth, respective
ly, in the BCS.
The Cardinal's climb from No. 14 to No. 6
in the BCS was the most substantial move of
the week.

Dettamanti finishes as NCAA champ
Dante Dettamanti had little time to take
his shoes off before jumping into the pool to
celebrate his retirement gift — a national
championship.
Last weekend's NCAA Championship,
hosted by top-ranked Stanford, crowned a
stellar season for the men's water polo team,
which finished with a record of 22-1 and its
ninth national title. The 8-5 victory in Sun
day's final game over two-time defending
national champion UCLA was Dettamanti's
last hurrah after 25 years as Stanford's head
coach.
For the four seniors on the squad, this was a
last shot at the national title after narrowly miss
ing it twice. The Cardinal finished as the run
ner-up in both 1998 and 1999.
"We lost my freshman and sophomore years
and 1 got a taste of that, but I really wanted a
taste of this. And it's bloody good," senior Onno
Koelman said.

Women's volleyball claims fifth national title
For most teams, just playing in the Final
Four would be pressure enough.
But not for the Stanford women's volley
ball team.
For the Cardinal, after a season full of re
markable comebacks, no championship run
would have been complete without having to
dig out of a few more holes.
So, true to style, the Cardinal fell into a pair
of seemingly hopeless situations in the first
two games of its NCAA semifinal match
against defending champion Nebraska on
Dec. 13. And then it did it again in the first
game against top-seeded Long Beach State in

the championship match on Dec. 15.
True to style, the Stanford squad somehow
prevailed.
Now the Cardinal will raise another nation
al championship banner in Maples Pavilion.
Stanford (33-2) posted an improbable 3-0
win over the Cornhuskers (31-2) in the semifi
nals and then ended the 49ers' (33-1) hopes of
an undefeated season with a stunning 3-0 win
in the finals to claim the Cardinal's fifth NCAA
crown.

Gell's shot ended what may have

the Cardinal men's soccer history
with an all-time best record of 19-2-

most goals the Cardinal conceded
all year.

Teevens takes over Cardinal
Calling it a "great day for Stanford
athletics and Stanford football," ath
letic director l ed Leland presented
former Florida assistant Buddy
Teevens as the Cardinal's new head
football coach during a press confer
ence yesterday afternoon.
"Of all the coaches I've ever
hired, I don't know if I've ever seen
a better fit between a person, his
personal integrity and professional
capabilities and the values and the
needs of the institution as I see
here," said Leland, who originally
hired Teevens to be the head coach
of Dartmouth in 1987.
Teevens, who wore a big smile and
talked excitedly throughout the event,
was offered the job Tuesday afternoon
after Provost John Etchemendy ap
proved Iceland's recommendation.

Gymnastics legend says farewell
and leaves behind lasting
impressions
An old samurai, partly obscured
from view, sits hunched as he gazes
upon the multitude of warriors who
stand at attention before him.
1 lis face now lined with the subde
appearance of wrinkles, his hair tinged
with white, his body a shadow of its for
mer self , the samurai still single-hand
edly holds t he awe of his pupils.
It was he who led them to their
most crushing losses and also to their
most inspiring victories.
It is he who they fight for.
And 30 years later, it is he who
will turn in his sword. For Sadao
Hamada, in some respects the
men's-gymnastics version of Bela
karolyi, the time has finally come.
The story of men's gymnastics
head coach Hamada's life is one
that includes the greatest triumphs,
the hardest defeats, the most reas
suring technical brilliance and at
times a seeming disregard for team
morale.

Men's swimming wins
Pac-10 crown
The undefeated Cardinal men's
swim team went to Los Angeles with
a singular purpose: to bring home
its 21st consecutive Pacific 10 Con
ference Championship trophy.
Not even the bright Southern Cal
ifornia sun or the beckoning Pacific
just a stone's throw away could dis
tract the top-ranked Cardinal, as it
won 7 of 13 individual events and 3 of
5 relays, crushing the next runner
up, California, 918-708.5.
With Stanford so dominant, it's
easy for fans to forget that the Pac-10
is the strongest swimming confer
ence in the country. The swimmers
knew it, though, and were ready.
"We went into the meet respect

ing the other teams, but not fear
ing them," said junior tri-captain
John Waters.

Borchardt and Jacobsen to test the
waters in NBA Draft
For the second time in two weeks,
a Stanford men's basketball player
confirmed speculation and declared
for the NBA draft.
Junior Curtis Borchardt, a 7-foot,
240-pound center, declared his eligi
bility for the NBA Draft on Friday
morning.
But like junior swingman Casey
Jacobsen, Borchardt will use the
NBA's "test the waters" policy by not
signing with an agent, leaving open
the possibility that he would return to
the Farm for his senior season.
The final day to withdraw from
the draft is June 19 and the draft is
June 25.

Dettamanti finishes as NCAA champ
Dante Dettamanti had little time to take
his shoes off before jumping into the pool to
celebrate his retirement gift — a national
championship.
Last weekend's NCAA Championship,
hosted by top-ranked Stanford, crowned a
stellar season for the men's water polo team,
which finished with a record of 22-1 and its
ninth national title. The 8-5 victory in Sun
day's final game over two-time defending
national champion UCLA was Dettamanti's
last hurrah after 25 years as Stanford's head
coach.
For the four seniors on the squad, this was a
last shot at the national title after narrowly miss
ing it twice. The Cardinal finished as the run
ner-up in both 1998 and 1999.
"We lost my freshman and sophomore years
and 1 got a taste of that, but I really wanted a
taste of this. And it's bloody good," senior Onno
Koelman said.

Women's volleyball claims fifth national title
For most teams, just playing in the Final
Four would be pressure enough.
But not for the Stanford women's volley
ball team.
For the Cardinal, after a season full of re
markable comebacks, no championship run
would have been complete without having to
dig out of a few more holes.
So, true to style, the Cardinal fell into a pair
of seemingly hopeless situations in the first
two games of its NCAA semifinal match
against defending champion Nebraska on
Dec. 13. And then it did it again in the first
game against top-seeded Long Beach State in

the championship match on Dec. 15.
True to style, the Stanford squad somehow
prevailed.
Now the Cardinal will raise another nation
al championship banner in Maples Pavilion.
Stanford (33-2) posted an improbable 3-0
win over the Cornhuskers (31-2) in the semifi
nals and then ended the 49ers' (33-1) hopes of
an undefeated season with a stunning 3-0 win
in the finals to claim the Cardinal's fifth NCAA

hosted by top-ranked Stanford, crowned a
stellar season for the men's water polo team,
which finished with a record of 22-1 and its
ninth national title. The 8-5 victory in Sun
day's final game over two-time defending
national champion UCLA was Dettamanti's
last hurrah after 25 years as Stanford's head
coach.
For the four seniors on the squad, this was a
last shot at the national title after narrowly miss
ing it twice. The Cardinal finished as the run
ner-up in both 1998 and 1999.
"We lost my freshman and sophomore years
and 1 got a taste of that, but I really wanted a
taste of this. And it's bloody good," senior Onno
Koelman said.

Women's volleyball claims fifth national title
For most teams, just playing in the Final
Four would be pressure enough.
But not for the Stanford women's volley
ball team.
For the Cardinal, after a season full of re
markable comebacks, no championship run
would have been complete without having to
dig out of a few more holes.
So, true to style, the Cardinal fell into a pair
of seemingly hopeless situations in the first
two games of its NCAA semifinal match
against defending champion Nebraska on
Dec. 13. And then it did it again in the first
game against top-seeded Long Beach State in

the championship match on Dec. 15.
True to style, the Stanford squad somehow
prevailed.
Now the Cardinal will raise another nation
al championship banner in Maples Pavilion.
Stanford (33-2) posted an improbable 3-0
win over the Cornhuskers (31-2) in the semifi
nals and then ended the 49ers' (33-1) hopes of
an undefeated season with a stunning 3-0 win
in the finals to claim the Cardinal's fifth NCAA
crown.

Gell's shot ended what may have

most goals the Cardinal conceded
all year.

Teevens takes over Cardinal
Calling it a "great day for Stanford
athletics and Stanford football," ath
letic director l ed Leland presented
former Florida assistant Buddy
Teevens as the Cardinal's new head
football coach during a press confer
ence yesterday afternoon.
"Of all the coaches I've ever
hired, I don't know if I've ever seen
a better fit between a person, his
personal integrity and professional
capabilities and the values and the
needs of the institution as I see
here," said Leland, who originally
hired Teevens to be the head coach
of Dartmouth in 1987.
Teevens, who wore a big smile and
talked excitedly throughout the event,
was offered the job Tuesday afternoon
after Provost John Etchemendy ap
proved Iceland's recommendation.

Gymnastics legend says farewell
and leaves behind lasting
impressions
An old samurai, partly obscured
from view, sits hunched as he gazes
upon the multitude of warriors who
stand at attention before him.
1 lis face now lined with the subde
appearance of wrinkles, his hair tinged
with white, his body a shadow of its for
mer self , the samurai still single-hand
edly holds t he awe of his pupils.
It was he who led them to their
most crushing losses and also to their
most inspiring victories.
It is he who they fight for.
And 30 years later, it is he who
will turn in his sword. For Sadao
Hamada, in some respects the
men's-gymnastics version of Bela
karolyi, the time has finally come.
The story of men's gymnastics
head coach Hamada's life is one
that includes the greatest triumphs,
the hardest defeats, the most reas
suring technical brilliance and at
times a seeming disregard for team
morale.

Men's swimming wins
Pac-10 crown
The undefeated Cardinal men's
swim team went to Los Angeles with
a singular purpose: to bring home
its 21st consecutive Pacific 10 Con

Not even the bright Southern Cal
ifornia sun or the beckoning Pacific
just a stone's throw away could dis
tract the top-ranked Cardinal, as it
won 7 of 13 individual events and 3 of
5 relays, crushing the next runner
up, California, 918-708.5.
With Stanford so dominant, it's
easy for fans to forget that the Pac-10
is the strongest swimming confer
ence in the country. The swimmers
knew it, though, and were ready.
"We went into the meet respect

ing the other teams, but not fear
ing them," said junior tri-captain
John Waters.

Borchardt and Jacobsen to test the
waters in NBA Draft
For the second time in two weeks,
a Stanford men's basketball player
confirmed speculation and declared
for the NBA draft.
Junior Curtis Borchardt, a 7-foot,
240-pound center, declared his eligi
bility for the NBA Draft on Friday
morning.
But like junior swingman Casey
Jacobsen, Borchardt will use the
NBA's "test the waters" policy by not
signing with an agent, leaving open
the possibility that he would return to
the Farm for his senior season.
The final day to withdraw from
the draft is June 19 and the draft is
June 25.
