## Opinions CAMPUS VIEWPOINT Graduation tips from Stanford's buildings 
### 
Once, I drafted a speech
fora junior official at the
White House in which I
wrote about "the wis
dom ofthe Franklin Mountains" in
El Paso, Texas. The official did not
understand how mountains could
be wise. I told her it was a
metaphor. In that same vein, we
might consult the oldest and,
therefore, wisest things at Stan
ford—buildings, institutions, and
sculptures—for sage advice upon
graduation. Here's what the build
ings might say.
Hoover Tower: "You are a ris
ing star." Herbert Hoover rose
from humble beginnings as an or
phan to the presidency of the Unit
ed States. In 1891, he failed en
trance exams to Stanford Universi
ty, but he was admitted on the con
dition that he enroll in summer
school, retake his exams and im
prove his writing abilities. At Stan
ford, he managed the varsity foot
ball team (there's a picture of him
and the team above the first seat
ing booth in the Treehouse),
worked hard and met the require
ments for graduation. He donated
materials on war and peace held in
Hoover Tower, and he helped es
tablish the Graduate School of
Business. The lesson: Graduation
is the beginning of your rising tra
jectory!
Meyer Library: "Be ready to
adapt." A couple years ago, this li
brary actually held books as well as
comfortable places for studying. It
has been gutted of its books and
shelves and transformed into a
computer facility. The post-gradu
ation lesson: Be ready to accom
modate new ideas and people into
the personal, academic and profes
sional framework that you've de
veloped at the University.
T he Pedestal of the Thinker:
"Step up for leadership." Good
ideas travel fast. In fact, they travel

so fast that the Thinker has spent
the entire year in Australia and
Southeast Asia ("Thinker Ponder
ing a life down under," The Stan
ford Daily, Nov. 12, 2001). His
pedestal has been empty. Mean
while, the space has been filled by
students, chairs, grocery carts and

orange cones.
Lesson: Don't be
afraid to step into
leadership when
you see an empty
pedestal. It's an
invitation.
David Packard
Electrical Engi
neering Building:

"Take risks." After graduating
from Stanford, David Packard
worked for General Electric for
two years in Schenectady, N.Y., re
turned to Palo Alto and started a
company in 1939 with his friend
and former classmate William
Hewlett. Their first "plant" was a
small garage in Palo Alto. They
had $538 in capital but produced
an audio oscillator based on
Hewlett's design from graduate
school. Take-home lesson: Run
with your own ideas. It's more fun
(and potentially more lucrative)
than being a cog in someone else's
machine.
The Dish: "Enjoy the simple
pleasures." The walk to the satel
lite dish in the Foothills behind
campus is serene, beautiful and re
freshing. The small things in life,
such as enjoying a meal or taking a
walk, will bring a lifetime of satis
faction. Post-grad lesson: Enjoy
the simple pleasures.
Palm Drive Entrance Gate:
"Don't be arrogant." The noble
gate at the intersection of Palm
Drive and El Camino Real be
speaks strength, dignity and pride,
but it crumbled into a pile of rub
ble during the earthquake of 1906.
Lesson: Don't be arrogant.

Haughty pride rests on a shallow
foundation, and it will be easily de
stroyed.
Lake Lagunita: "Be ready for
paradox." Things aren't always
what they seem. First of all, the
name of this spot is a misnomer be
cause "lagunita" means "little la
goon" in Spanish. The name Lake
Lagunita is as repetitive as calling
your mother "Mom Mama." It's a
double whammy. Second, there is
no water in Lake Lagunita. It is
bone dry. Pictures from the last
century show students boating and
sailing at Lake Lagunita. Not this
year. It's as barren as Rachel's
womb. Post-graduate lesson: Be
ready for paradox.
The Stanford Daily:" Read your
local paper." The world is bigger
than your job. Reading the local
newspaper will help you under
stand the community. In addition,
your local paper will tell you about
activities, fun events and impor
tant developments affecting you.
Post-graduate lesson: Stay in
formed!
Cantor Art Museum: "Take a
break for culture." The Cantor Ait
Museum holds a little bit of every
thing including ancient Greco-
Roman artifacts and modern art. It
has a great cafe, too, for taking it
easy. It's an oasis of culture, in the
middle of Silicon Valley, that
broadens our outlook with re
minders of past times and places.
Take-home lesson: Make time for
culture in your life.
Memorial Church: "Have a lit
tle faith." Jane Stanford wanted
this church to be the centerpiece
of the University. The original
church had a steeple that was
twice the height of today's roof.
The original facade said, "Erected
to the Glory of God and in Loving
Memory of My Husband Leland
Stanford." It was rebuilt after
Jane Stanford's death and the

1906 earthquake without those
critical words of endearment.
Nevertheless, Jane Stanford's val
ues are carved into the interior
walls of the church. One example:
"The greatest of all safeguards,
and the most encouraging of all
stimulating influences to a noble
life—that is, the power of person
al religion." Post-grad lesson: A
little faith will help you accom
plish great things.
Roble Gym: "Have a balanced
life." Roble Gym sits near academ
ic buildings, Tresidder Union and
the offices of The Stanford Daily.
It's home to many athletic offices,
courses and lockers. Lesson: Don't
forget to take care of your body
and have a little fun while you're in
the working world.
Frances C. Arrillaga Alumni
Center: "Give something back."
"Fhe University's main connection
to you after graduation will be ask
ing for money. However, there are
other ways to give something back.
You can organize internships for
undergraduate students or men
tor them to the next level. Post
grad lesson: Remember where you
came from because it will be a
source of strength for you and
your alma mater.
Individual students will have
personal memories of their time at
Stanford, but our collective memo
ry will dwell in the buildings, insti
tutions, and sculptures which—
with the possible exception of
Rodin's Thinker—will be here for
a long time to come. This collective
memory should be shared with
our visiting friends and family.
Above all, it should speak to our
lives after graduation.
