# ACLU President Strossen gives talk
## Address focuses on civil liberties after Sept. 11 
### HELEN KIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Nadine Strossen, president of
the American Civil Liberties
Union, spoke about "Civil Liber
ties and National Security" last
night to a crowd of 200 people in
Kresge Auditorium.
"No rational person would
choose to give up freedom with
out safety," Strossen said in her
opening statement.
Strossen recapped post-Sept.
11 measures that the federal gov
ernment implemented and how
they affect American citizens'
range of freedom.
She discussed the federal gov
ernment's implementation of a
mass dragnet system of interroga
tion and incarceration based on
who people are, not what they
have done.
According to Strossen, this
dragnet system, which employs
profiling tactics that violate indi
vidual rights, has been criticized
by civil libertarians and Republi
can conservatives.
"Our allies, including the con
servatives, promote liberty, free
dom, safety and security."
Strossen said. " There have never
been so many different organiza
tions that have agreed on the
same thing."
Even a group of counter-ter
rorist organizations have been
against the government's "anti
terrorist" measure for pragmatic
reasons, Strossen said. She sug
gested that the government's
over-reliance on religious and
ethnic profiling may be one of the
reasons for Sept. 1 1.
Strossen said that the govern
ment had dual responsibilities of
safety and freedom for its citizens.

The union has asked the federal
government to base its actions re
garding anti-terrorism on reason
and has brought more than one
lawsuit against the federal govern
ment, according to Strossen.
"There was no evidence that
the colossal failure of 9-11 had to
do with the lack of security en
forcement," Strossen said. "Con
gress is so disgusted with the In
ternational and Naturalization
Services for this mishandling of
information."
Strossen remarked that the
federal government has not ac
knowledged that its failure to pro
tect the nation on Sept. 11 was due
to lack of surveillance.
"The ,so-called anti-terrorism
law is a misnomer," Strossen
said. "It actually allows govern
ment surveillance of completely
innocent citizens not suspected

of terrorism.
"We should not adopt or ac
cept measures merely because
they are labeled counter-terror
ism. We should carefully look at
them to see if they do not violate
civil liberties."
Strossen also criticized the
media.
" The media hasn't covered it as
much as it should," she said. "This
is something that each and every
person in the country should be
aware of."
The dragnet system operates
on the principle that anyone who
"might" have a reason to commit
an act of terrorism evokes a nec
essary action on behalf of author
ities to seek a judge, who must
then issue a warrant, authorizing
a search, according to Strossen.
This is different than present
ing concrete evidence before a

judge to obtain a search warrant.
An example of ihis breach of
civil liberties is the "USA Patriot
Act," which can especially target
students. Under this act, any
person who might send an e
mail containing content that
might be indicative of terrorist
intent will have all personal com
munication in all media inter
cepted by authorities.
"Imagine one word in an e
mail being the cause of the au
thorities searching through all
your e-mails," she said.
Strossen pointed out that such
measures have an adverse impact
on privacy. The effectiveness of
such search procedures is also
questionable, Strossen said.
"The government has also en
gaged in several secret arrests,"
