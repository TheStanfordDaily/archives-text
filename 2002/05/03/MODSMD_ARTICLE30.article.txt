Rice as Commencement speaker and a
letter supporting her.
Seniors disappointed with
selection of Rice
We are writing to express our
disappointment at the choice of
Condoleezza Rice as commence
ment speaker for the Class 0f2002.
The choice reveals a lack of con sid
eration of what Rice represents to
several segments of the Class of
2002 and how her presence will af
fect the graduation experience of
these students....
Despite what media may say,
there are students here at Stanford
who see the U.S.'s current military
campaign not as an effective war on
terrorism, but an assault on the civil
ians of Afghanistan that violates nu
merous international laws, perpetu
ates racism both at home and
abroad and ultimately avoids the
real issues behind terrorism. For
these students, Rice's presence is ex
tremely offensive. ...
The bottom line is that we ques
tion the appropriateness of select
ing a highly political figure, whose
agenda many could find objec
tionable, as the speaker at our
Commencement. It is not as if this
is an event students could simply
choose to attend or avoid; boy
cotting their own graduation is
hardly an easy choice for graduat
ing seniors. As members of the
Class of 2002 who, for one reason
or another, deeply oppose the se
lection of Condoleezza Rice as
commencement speaker, we are
faced with two unpleasant alterna
tives: being hurt and offended at
our own commencement, or miss
ing one of the biggest milestones
in our lives. We should not be
faced with such a choice.

Choice of Rice is appropriote

... 112 r]here is a significant minor
ity of students who believe diat Con
doleezza Rice is an inappropriate
choice fora graduation speaker.
That is especially sad since we
believe that Stanford has rarely
had so distinguished a member of
its own community come back to
speak at graduation. Rice is a part
of Stanford — she came here over
20 years ago as a fellow in a disar
mament program, stayed to be
come a full professor in the politi
cal science department and most
especially served as provost for six
years
We feel that the choice of Rice
as graduation speaker is appro
priate and that, by her accep
tance, the University itself will
gain. Rice was nominated by the
students and approved by the se
nior class presidents before she
was chosen by the University ad
ministration. She has distin
guished herself in public service,
rising to one of the highest ap
pointed offices in America. In ad
dition, her presence as a black
woman underscores Stanford's
commitment to a society where
achievement is gained based on
merit rather than the color of
one's skin.
Unlike several of the speakers
from the last several years, Rice is
not only an esteemed public figure,
but a scholar as well. In short, Rice
embodies the qualities of which
Stanford should be most proud:
equality, merit, public service, and
scholarship....
Let us instead welcome the re
turn of one of the Stanford commu
nity's most distinguished members,
and consider her choice and her
speech as a part of the variety of per
spectives that the University should
dedicate itself to maintain.
