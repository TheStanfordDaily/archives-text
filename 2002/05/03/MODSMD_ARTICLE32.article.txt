## Med school prof finds Chinese herb may help in battle against cancer 
### VICTOR REKLAITIS STAFF WRITER 
An ancient Chinese herb might
have a role in the fight against can
cer, according to the recent re
search results of Pulmonary and
Critical Care Medicine Prof. Glenn
Rosen. Tripterygium wilfordii, or "lei
gong teng," a vine found in south
ern China that has long played a
part in traditional herbal reme
dies, may soon help cancer pa
tients. Triptolide, an extract from
the herb, enhances the effects of
chemotherapy.
"There is real synergy between
chemotherapy and triptolide,"
Rosen said. "When we use small
concentrations of each, we can sig
nificantly enhance the ability of
both to kill tumor cells, without
using large doses of each."
Rosen and the Palo Alto-based
company Pharmagenesis patented
his discovery in November and
hope to begin phase one of the
Food and Drug Administration's
drug development process in the
next few months. Triptolide may
be available to patients in a few
years, according to Rosen.
Many chemotherapy drugs ac
tivate the p53 protein, which pre
vents cancer cells from replicating
by cell division. Rosen and his lab
team discovered that tumor cells
treated with triptolide, alongside a
typical chemotherapy drug called
doxorubicin, stopped dividing

and eventually died off. Triptolide
can light cancer cells even after
their p53 genes mutate, making
the genes resistant to other drugs.
Rosen and his team also found
that they could administer low
doses of triptolide and doxoru
bicin and still achieve excellent re
sults. By keeping the quantities of
the extract and the chemotherapy
drug low in patients, doctors can
avoid strong negative side effects.
"It's one of the few demonstra
tions of true synergy where both
together act much better than ei
ther alone," Rosen said.
How did an extract from a vine
in China find its way into a Stan
ford lab?
In the 19705, scientists character
ized triptolide as a toxic agent, but
didn't study it further. Then Prof.
Peter Kao, also in the Pulmonary
and Critical Care department and
in t he lab next door to Rosen, began
to research how triptolide affected
different cell-death pathways.
Rosen believes that more mod
ern treatment methods will arise
from a study of ancient herbs like
T. wilfordii and other plants.
"There are active substances in
plants which — when we look fur
ther and we purify them — have
potent activity against different
disease processes," he said.
Scientists are only "starting to
scratch the surface" as they exam
ine the natural world in order to
develop new drugs, said Rosen.
