# M-state elixir may be youth potion
## 
### SEAN MOONEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
According to followers of
"ormus" metals, an elixir called
"M-state" holds the key to everlast
ing life. Web sites indicate that the
mysterious recipe for this drink
contains M-state monatomic met
als. A published patent application
describes how it can be made
through a process of boiling pure
gold in a vat of lye for several days,
replenishing the water as it boils
off, then reducing the acidity and
collecting the salts that precipitate.
Web sites such as mountain
manna.com, rangeguide.net and
(Keanalchemy.com allow customers
to purchase solutions that suppos
edly contain ormus metals for up
wards of $55 per 4-ounce bottle.
The middle-aged Arizona
farmer who founded the theory
behind the M-state is named David
Hudson. Texts from many of his
speeches from a 1994 to 1996 lec
ture tour have been made avail
able. Using numerous respected
scientific references, lie claimed to
have taken research to a new level,
one that bridges modern science
and metaphysical new age beliefs.
However, investigation into
these exceptional claims leads to
an interesting story of cult-like ac
tivities and new age explanations
based on misinterpreted science.
Researchers familiar with Hud
son's reference list confirm the in
accuracies of several statements
Hudson himself made during a
Dallas lecture in 1996.
Unfortunately, this form of
charlatanism preys on desperate as
well as health-conscious people.

According to an article published
in the Sept. 19, 1996 issue of the
Phoenix New Times, Hudson's
teachings may have fueled a young
Leslie Burroughs of Tucson,
Ariz, to inject herself with what she
believed were M-state metals that
would cure her HIV infection. In
stead, she fell into a coma on her
second dose and died a month
later. Her official cause of death
was sepsis, likely caused by the un
sanitary conditions by which the in
jections were administered.
Today, Hudson's ideas are
again gaining popularity. Quietly,
several online companies are sell
ing liquids for consumption that
purportedly contain M-state com
pounds. According to an anony
mous supporter of M-state materi
als, one popular M-state mailing
list reaches out to over 400 people.
Hudson and his followers are not
alone. Another unrelated site,
www.alexchiu.com, professes to sell
immortality: all you have to do is
purchase and wear a magnetic ring.
Absurdly, Alex Chiu has a U.S.
patent on this ring "invention."
The exploding popularity of
nutritional supplements and
naturopathic treatments is leading
to a new breed of con men who
feed off gullible Internet users.
The business plan is simple: a
con artist develops a professional
looking Web site, write scientifical
ly sounding and often misleading
text, and accept the credit cards of
unsuspecting and misinformed
buyers. While Hudson and Chiu
are relatively easy to spot, others
are more subtle.
Former Stanford Clinical Asst.
Prof. Heidi Roberts acknowledged

the problem. Although her patients
rarely follow harmful information
from the Internet, they often refer
to dubious health advice received
electronically.
"I have people bring stuff off
the Web all the time," she said.
Stanford M.D./Ph.D. candidate
Ceorge Scott also said that future
clinicians are going to be affected.
"This is a huge problem. [There
is] going to be an increasing need
for education at the patient level,"
he said.

In an effort to highlight fraudu
lent claims, retired psychiatrist and
