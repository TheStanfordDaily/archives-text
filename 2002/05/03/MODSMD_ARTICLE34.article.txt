## Birch betrays her age 
### RYAN SANDS 
Nineteen-year-old Thora Birch is one
of those Hollywood kids. Born and raised
in Los Angeles, Birch began her "acting ca
reer" at age four, as a pitchwoman for
Quaker Oats and Vlasic pickles. After a
mixed slew of TV shows, Birch made her
way into movies with a handful of parts in
children's films. Her career continued to
expand and led to roles in which she made
the cinematic transition from one-dimen
sional child characters to more engaging
and relevant teenage roles.
fn her most recent film, "Ghost World,"
Birch portrays Enid, a recent high school
graduate without plans or direction. With
her best friend Rebecca, played soberly
and solidly by Scarlett Johansson, Enid
struggles to define herself through disasso
ciation from her peers and town. The two
search for something honest among the
sub-cultures, alterna-cultures and fringes.
Rebecca and Enid's "elitist" delights are
private, ironic and honest in their inten
tion: '60s Bollywood musicals, pseudo
retro-diners, bondage shops and monoga
mous Satanists. Despite the strength dis
played by her rejection of the norms of her
peers, Enid's self-imposed distance reveals
insecurity and soul searching.
The film is gracefully adapted from the
underground comic by Daniel Clowes.
Clowes worked with director Terry
Zwigoff for almost two years developing
the script, and made the casting choices
for the film. He had very specific ideas
about how Enid and Rebecca should be
portrayed. Clowes originally wanted
Christina Ricci for the part of Enid, but
after script delays pushed back the shoot
ing, he decided that she was too old. De
ciding on then 18-year-old Birch for the
part, Clowes continued throughout pro
duction to take a large part in the film to
insure that the voice and sense of his char
acters were preserved.
Birch said, "A lot of the research I did

for 'Gliost World' was
actually done with
Dan Clowes; explor
ing his opinion of
[Enid] and his ideas
on what her child
hood might have
been like."
"Ghost World"
could be classified in
the recent vein of'
dark-comedy / subur
ban satires, such as
Todd Solondz's "Hap
piness" and "Ameri
can Beauty." What
works about "Ghost
World" 's " so-bad-it's
good" irony and satire

is that Enid and Rebecca's isolation and out
sider-stance are not alienating to the viewer.
The confusion, fear and search for accep
tance behind Enid's actions make her wan
dering and her decision at the film's end un
derstandable and comforting.
"Enid is happy being a person that is
somewhat hard to understand, but she
definitely craves acceptance," Birch said.
When asked whether she identified
with Enid, Birch answered, "There were
parts of myself that were similar to Enid
at the time of filming, but I'm not sure if
that was really me or me being affected
by the role. Today, I think that Enid
would be different if I portrayed her
now." Regardless, in her performance as
Enid there is just enough knowledge and
just enough confusion to render her be
lievable, independent and someone with
whom we can identify.
Despite her serious roles in both
"American Beauty" and "Ghost World,"
Birch assures that she actually likes "all
that lovey stuff," and comedies are great
too. She plans on trying them both at some
point, claiming, "I'm not all darkness,
dammit. :)" (her smiley face, not mine).
Birch is purposely taking her time in de

tiding on new projects. She recently
starred in a movie called "the HOLE,"
which was released this spring in Europe.
The movie revolves around four English
boarding school students who discover a
sealed up underground tunnel leading to,
well, purported creepy scariness.
Beyond continuing acting, Birch has
other long-term goals. She says,"In the fu
ture, I would like to attempt directing. But
first, I'd like to work with a larger variety of
directors before I try. There's actually
something I'm thinking of producing â€”
we'll see where that takes me." As far as act
ing, Birch said she still sees promise and
possibility in the intelligent teenage roles
she has taken in recent films. "I think
there's still a lot I can do with the whole
teenage thing so I'm not knocking it." I ler
criteria for films are only that they are
something she hasn't done before, or that
she finds them "tremendously original."
Outside of her future Hollywood en
deavors, Birch says she plans on attending
college soon and is interested in studying
English literature. Hopefully, Birch will
continue her trend of strong, honest per
formances as she continues to advance
gracefully into adulthood. (Oct. 11,2001)
