# SF strippers discuss life and art

### JOANNA PETRONE 
Note: For the sake of privacy, the women inter
viewed asked that their real names not be used; I will
refer to them as Allison and Elizabeth.
Meet Allison: in beat-up tennis shoes and
a posture that slumps childishly at her shoul
ders and her hips, she stands just over five
feet. We are standing in a dimly-lit w(x>d
paneled hall, and men periodically emerge
from booths and eye us queerly as they walk
by, looking somewhat unnerved at the
prospect of two fully clothed women having
an intelligent conversation in their midst.
Allison is a professional sex entertain
ment worker, currently employed as a
nude dancer at a unionized San Francisco
strip club. She moved here several years
ago from Florida, where she worked as a
lingerie model.
Allison has no doubt that the union has
greatly improved working conditions.
"Where I used to work," she explains, "you
could get fired just because the manager was
having a bad day. Here, if someone gets
fired, she knows it is coming. If you get fired
here it has to be fora reason; it has to be be
cause you are not doing your job."
So why would one choose to work as a
stripper? Allison says,"It offers a great deal of
financial freedom. It pays well. I don't know
anyone in the business who is rolling in
money, but, for example, I could work a 12-
hour week, which means just a few days or
evenings of work, and not have to worry
about paying my bills." But Allison, like many
of the workers, does have another job. "Many
of the workers are either artists or students."
So what are the downsides? Allison says,
"Sex work definitely isn't for everyone. Hav
ing fat, old men masturbate in front of you is
not exactly everyone's cup of tea, but it just
isn't something that particularly bothers me.
Also, it gets really boring... really fast."
Elizabeth, too, has been a sex entertain
ment worker for some years now. She has
been working in San Francisco as a stripper

in a non-unionized strip club for four years.
Before moving to here, she worked at a su ip
club in Sacramento, but had to leave "when
work got slow."
Elizabedi is relaxing in a seat near the
dressing room when I talk to her. She has just
been performing and is visibly flushed, but
her makeup is somehow intact. Minutes ago,
I watched as she descended from the stage,
fully nude, and dressed herself in a corner.
Now, we sit at a table and chat amiably.
Elizabeth tells me she loves her work. "I
love the dancing, I love the art of it. I love to
be on stage performing, and I love to create
new stuff to perform." Elizabeth has com
plete artistic control; she chooses the music
and choreographs her dances. " There are
some basic things you have to do," she ex
plains, "like be totally naked by the end of the
dance, do something with the pole at some
point, and make sure that you've touched
yourself, but other than that, anything goes."
Elizabeth also loves the sense of cama
raderie she feels with other dancers. She
beams as she tells me about "the really amaz
ing girls" she has met working here. "Every
one is just so nice to each other," she says.
Not that there aren't downsides to this
work. "Obviously there are going to be the
gross old men," she says, "but, you know, you
deal." Also, without the protection of a union,
the work can be very 7 unstable. "You never
really know if you are going to make money
or not," she says. Dancers here make most of
their money from tips, which can vary dra
matically from night to night.
As I thank her and stand up to leave, Eliz
abeth gets up and walks with me to the door.
She is very tall standing up; 1 doubt would
stand much taller than her chin. Smiling, she
waves me off. It occurs to me that I have no
idea what her age might be, and, in this dim
lighting, I cannot tell. She turns from the
door, her waist-length hair fluttering behind
her. In the pink and gold reflections off the
disco ball, she could be any fashionable young
woman going to a glamorous nightclub. But
outside, the day is still light. (Apr. 19,2002)
