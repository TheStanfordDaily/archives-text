# Bush proposes cuts in student-loan program
## Students denounce the move as unfair to those seeking higher education 
### BRENDAN MARTEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Bush administration announced a
proposal to cut $1.3 billion from a federal stu
dent loan program to alleviate strains on the
budget, which currently lias a projected deficit
of more than $100 billion for this year.
Aside from last year's tax cut, other mea
sures such as expanded counterterrorism
funding after Sept. 1 1 and the recent eco
nomic downturn have caused the previously
predicted surplus to rapidly dwindle away.
The loan program, established in 1986, has
allowed millions of college students and grad

uates to consolidate education loans from mul
tiple lenders and secure low interest rates on
loan payments.
The low fixed interest rates are made possi
ble by government support from the pro
gram's budget, fhe program allows for up to
30 years to repay debts.
l'he proposal was pitched to a number of
Republican Congressional members by
Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the White House budget
director. Democrats are expected to strongly
oppose the proposal.
" fhe president and his budget director
are finally being honest about their misguid
ed priorities," said David Sirota, a
spokesman for Democrats on the House Ap
propriations Committee in a statement.
"[Like] more tax cuts for Enron paid for by
effectively raising taxes on middle-class stu
dents and their families."
I'he suggested reduction in funding would

effectively end the program as it currently op
erates, according to officials. Consolidated
loans in the future would only be offered at
variable interest rates, as opposed to the low
fixed rates that were supported in the past
through extensive federal subsidization.
Opponents of the budget cut maintain that
allowing interest rates to change with econom
ic conditions will inevitably place an unfairly
greater burden on those Americans pursuing
higher education.
Those in favor, however, argue that many
well-off professionals have used the program
to escape paying market interest rates on
their education loans, while not having any
particular need for the economic sheltering.
Also, many have pointed out that it would be
more effective to take the funds and allocate
them to other education programs.

Many students have de
nounced the proposal as unfair
and detrimental to those seeking
higher education.
"The longer people take to
pay back their debts, the less
time they have to be self-better
ing members of society," said
freshman Srinidhi Vijaykumar.
"And it makes it more difficult
for people to pursue an educa
tion in the first place since they
have to face such huge loans
later on."
Freshman Christina Knight

agreed.
"I can't help but be worried,
given the current economic insta
bility and since I'll have to pay off
debts in a few years myself,"
Knight said.
Others have countered that the
budget cut, while not desirable, is
necessary and reasonable given
the current economic situation of
the nation.
"People should pay for their
own educations to a greater cer
tain extent," said Eric Broberg, a
junior. "The budget doesn't have
the money to spare for that kind of
thing right now."
The proposal is expected to be
discussed in Congress within the
next few weeks.
