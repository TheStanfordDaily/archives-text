# Bush proposes cuts in student-loan program
## Students denounce the move as unfair to those seeking higher education 
### BRENDAN MARTEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Bush administration announced a
proposal to cut $1.3 billion from a federal stu
dent loan program to alleviate strains on the
budget, which currently lias a projected deficit
of more than $100 billion for this year.
Aside from last year's tax cut, other mea
sures such as expanded counterterrorism
funding after Sept. 1 1 and the recent eco
nomic downturn have caused the previously
predicted surplus to rapidly dwindle away.
The loan program, established in 1986, has
allowed millions of college students and grad

uates to consolidate education loans from mul
tiple lenders and secure low interest rates on
loan payments.
The low fixed interest rates are made possi
ble by government support from the pro
gram's budget, fhe program allows for up to
30 years to repay debts.
l'he proposal was pitched to a number of
Republican Congressional members by
Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the White House budget
director. Democrats are expected to strongly
oppose the proposal.
" fhe president and his budget director
are finally being honest about their misguid
ed priorities," said David Sirota, a
spokesman for Democrats on the House Ap
propriations Committee in a statement.
"[Like] more tax cuts for Enron paid for by
effectively raising taxes on middle-class stu
dents and their families."
I'he suggested reduction in funding would

effectively end the program as it currently op
erates, according to officials. Consolidated
loans in the future would only be offered at
variable interest rates, as opposed to the low
fixed rates that were supported in the past
through extensive federal subsidization.
Opponents of the budget cut maintain that
allowing interest rates to change with econom
ic conditions will inevitably place an unfairly
greater burden on those Americans pursuing
higher education.
Those in favor, however, argue that many
well-off professionals have used the program
to escape paying market interest rates on
their education loans, while not having any
particular need for the economic sheltering.
Also, many have pointed out that it would be
more effective to take the funds and allocate
them to other education programs.
