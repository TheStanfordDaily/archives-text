Twelve U.S. journalists from
such media outlets as Time mag
azine, National Public Radio and
the San Jose Mercury News have
been selected for the John S.
Knight Fellowship program for
next year.
Communication Prof. James
Bettinger, director of the pro
gram, said that it is geared towards

journalists who have performed
first-rate work and who have the
capacity to improve. '
"We look for four things: peo

Bettinger said.
The Knight Fellowship is given
each year to promising mid-career

significantly to their particular
field of journalism. I n addition, six

will be awarded later in May.
Dawn Garcia, deputy director
of the program, said that its aim is
to allow the journalists to cultivate
their skills and grow in a different
environment.
"We would like a Ktiiglu Fel

study away from deadline pres

other accomplished journalists."
Fellows audit University classes,
carry out independent research
projects and attend seminars.
In the past, Knight Fellows
have received job promotions fol

lowing their fellowship year, and
fellows have won numerous hon
ors, including 2H Pulitzer Prizes,
and other major print and broad
cast awards.
"This year, we had a sharp in
crease in the number of applica
tions," Garcia said.
Garcia cited the economic
downturn and the Sept. 1 I attacks
as explanations for this increase.
"1 think the attacks caused some
journalists to seek time to step
back and study international is

important in their lives and their
