# Knight Fellows are announced for next year
## Program allows journalists to study on campus 
### RIZWAN SABAR 
Twelve U.S. journalists from
such media outlets as Time mag
azine, National Public Radio and
the San Jose Mercury News have
been selected for the John S.
Knight Fellowship program for
next year.
Communication Prof. James
Bettinger, director of the pro
gram, said that it is geared towards

journalists who have performed
first-rate work and who have the
capacity to improve. '
"We look for four things: peo
ple who arc accomplished, have
serious ambitions to be effective
journalists, have the intellectual
flexibility and drive to make good
use of a year at Stanford, and peo
ple who we think will have a
strong impact on journalism,"
Bettinger said.
The Knight Fellowship is given
each year to promising mid-career
journalists who have contributed
significantly to their particular
field of journalism. I n addition, six
to eight international fellowships

will be awarded later in May.
Dawn Garcia, deputy director
of the program, said that its aim is
to allow the journalists to cultivate
their skills and grow in a different
environment.
"We would like a Ktiiglu Fel
lowship to turbo-charge the sec
ond half of these journalists' ca
reers," Garcia said. "It's a chance to
study away from deadline pres
sures, and to be in the company of
other accomplished journalists."
Fellows audit University classes,
carry out independent research
projects and attend seminars.
In the past, Knight Fellows
have received job promotions fol

lowing their fellowship year, and
fellows have won numerous hon
ors, including 2H Pulitzer Prizes,
and other major print and broad
cast awards.
"This year, we had a sharp in
crease in the number of applica
tions," Garcia said.
Garcia cited the economic
downturn and the Sept. 1 I attacks
as explanations for this increase.
"1 think the attacks caused some
journalists to seek time to step
back and study international is
sues, as well as to reassess what is
important in their lives and their
work," Garcia said.
Bettinger said that the selection
committee worked hard to ensure
that diversity within journalistic
specialties was maintained.
"We are always looking to make
sure that our definition of impor
tant journalism is not too narrow,"
Bettinger said. "We have fellows
who work for newspapers, maga
zines, wire services, radio broad
casting companies â€”just about
every form of media.
The 2002-2003 Knight Fellows

are: Hannah Bloch, Time; Juan
Castillo, Austin American-States
man; Jon Christensen, freelance
writer; Woo Sung Han, Korea
Times (Los Angeles); Jeanne Mar
iani-Belding, San Jose Mercury
