School policy changed
PALO ALTO (AP) — The school board unanimously
approved a policy Tuesday aimed at limiting how schools
raise and spend money.
Starting with the 2004-05 school year, schools will no
longer be able to use donations and school-wide fund
raisers to hire additional teachers and classroom aides.
Instead, salaries and employee benefits will come from
district funds such as the general fund-raising pool.
Fund-raisers will now be conducted by the district
rather than the school and the money raised will be dis
tributed out evenly among the schools.
District officials decided to intervene nearly two years
ago when parents at Jordan Middle School, which serves
the city's wealthier students, proposed raising money to
reduce the school's sixth-grade class size. Schools serving
Palo Alto's poorer population had no such plans.
Tuesday's night vote passed with little objection from
parents. The last time the board discussed die issue, the
meeting drew a much larger crowd and ended with upset
parents walking out.
It is unclear who will head up the fund-raising or how
the funds will be raised.

County devotes tobacco
money to health care
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. (AP) — County supervi
sors will spend tobacco settlement money on health care.
Residents overwhelmingly approved March ballot
Measure A calling for the money to be used to offset the
indigent care losses by hospitals and physicians. County
officials strongly opposed Measure A, saying it was a
money grab by doctors and hospitals.
The county said this week it would acquiesce to
voter wishes.
The proposed budget to be presented to the Board of
Supervisors on May 21 distributes this year's roughly
$2.5 million installment of the tobacco setdement as re
quired by the ballot measure, Assistant Administrator
Gail Wilcox said.
"We're going to comply with the will of the voters," Su
pervisor Katcho Achadjian said Wednesday. After the
election, Achadjian said a consensus formed among
board members and county administrators that the mea
sure should be enforced, despite their prior opposition.
The money comes from a settlement by major tobacco
companies with 40 states, including California, which
ended lawsuits over consumer protection, antitrust laws
and government costs of treating smoking-related illnesses.

Biker gang wars heat up
LOS ANGELES (AP) — The deadly gun and knife
fight in a Nevada casino last weekend was just the latest
battle in an increasingly bloody turf war in which several
motorcycle gangs across the country have all lined up
against the Hells Angels.
The bloodshed among the outlaw bikers began sever
al months ago with the breakdown of a truce that had
largely held for about a decade.
At stake are turf and the drug trade that comes with it.
Law enforcement experts said they were not sure ex
actly what set off the round of violence, but it has put the
Pagans, Bandidos, Sons, Outlaws, Vagos and Mongols on
the same side.
"You have the Hells Angels basically going up against
virtually every other motorcycle club," said Tim McKinley,
a motorcycle gang expert with the FBI in San Francisco.
The rising tensions over the past few months had led
Sonny Barger, the legendary founder of the Angels, to
organize a "peace powwow" in the Arizona desert that
was supposed to take place after the gathering of motor
cycle enthusiasts in Laughlin, Nev., last weekend, Arizona
police said.
