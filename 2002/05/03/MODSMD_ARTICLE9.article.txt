1973
On May 3, 1973, The Daily printed an ar
ticle about students protesting a fraternity
stripper raffle.
"About 35 demonstrators picketed the Phi
Delta Theta house yesterday afternoon and
arguecl for over an hour with fraternity mem
bers about a house party two weeks ago
where a stripper was raffled off.
"The Phi Delts are currently under inves
tigation by the University as well as the Cali
fornia Alcoholic Beverage Commission due
to a result of the party.
"The demonstrators, mostly women, car
ried picket signs and a banner reading 'Pub
lic Sale Of Human Beings: Lowest Form Of
Degradation' while they chanted 'two-four
six-eight, try Phi Delt and sell your date.'
"They arrived at the house shortly before
5 p.m. and didn't leave until after 6 p.m."
Bottom Line: That issue was dearly nipped in the bud
when the Phi Delts got kicked off campus, because
strippers never show up at Stanford frats anymore...
