1983
On May 6, 1983, I he Daily printed an ar
ticle about the Stanford Synchrotron Radia
tion Laboratory.
"In a strongly worded letter to the signers
of a petition opposing a proposal at the Stan
ford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory
(SSRI.) that would involve research on nu
clear weapons, University President Donald
Kennedy reemphasized his support yester
day of University policies that refuse restric
tions on research based on end-use.
"The letter was released in answer to the
more than 2500 people who have signed the
petitions, which were presented to Kennedy
after 150 students marched from White Plaza
to his office to protest the proposal.
"The petition opposed research 'explicitly
dedicated to nuclear weapons testing and in
strumentation undertaken at SI AC (the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center) or anywhere
else on campus, even when unclassified.'
"The protesters also presented Kennedy
with two letters asking him to meet with staff
and faculty members at SLAC and with com
munity members in an 'open forum' to dis
cuss the proposal. Kennedy's letter said he
had arranged with SLAC- Director Arthur
Bienenstock to talk with SLAC staff and fac
ulty members.
"Kennedy did not promise to attend an
open forum, saying he has already addressed
the Academic Council and discussed the issue
with students.
Bottom Line: Protesting students have always been
able to find the University president's office.
