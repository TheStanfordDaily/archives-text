# U.S. supports Palestinian state

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The United
States is committed to a Palestinian state with
Yasser Arafat as its likely leader, President
George Bush's foreign policy advisers said
yesterday, heading off opposition expected
from Israel's prime minister at his White
House meeting this week.
Administration officials also are looking
fora radical overhaul of Palestinian gover
nance, ending corruption and quashing
terror.
One sign of hope emerged Sunday night,
as Palestinian officials reported «1n agree
ment with the Israelis to end the monthlong
standoff at the Church of the Nativity in
Bethlehem.
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon ar
rived in Washington Sunday with about 100
pages of documents for U.S. review that he
says link the Palestinian leader to the terror
that led to an unprecedented Israeli offensive
in the West Bank.
Sharon, whose visit with Bush tomorrow will
be the fifth since the president took office, has
said that Arafat is "irrelevant" and a terrorist.
U.S. officials said Arafat, who has yet to meet
with Bush, still represents the Palestinians.
"It serves us all better if we continue to
work with all Palestinian leaders and to rec
ognize who the Palestinian people look to as

their leader," Secretary of State Colin Powell
told ABC's "This Week."
Added Condoleezza Rice, Bush's national
security adviser: "The White House position
is that we're not going to try to choose the
leadership for the Palestinian people. Chair
man Arafat is there."
Leaders of Congress, which overwhelm
ingly condemned Arafat and supported Is
rael in nonbinding votes last week, acknowl
edged that Bush had no one else to turn to.
"At this point Yasser Arafat is the best of
what's probably not a particularly strong
field. And in that regard, I would support the
president," said Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., on
"Fox News Sunday."
Israeli officials say Arafat's alleged involve
ment in terror plotting counts him out as a
peace partner.
"We need to be able to keep talking, but
with another Palestinian leadership," said Is
raeli Education Minister Limor Livnat, who
was accompanying Sharon to the United
States.
Palestinians dismiss the documents as
forgeries.
Sharon is also under pressure from hawks
in his government who seek to return Israel
to a position of rejecting Palestinian state
hood.
