# Student-run a cappella groups advocate for University support
## Staying in tune 
### CHRISTINE LIYANTO 
For the members of a cappella groups across campus,
carrying a tune is a piece of cake. Bearing the responsibili
ties, however, is not always so sweet. These groups are stu
dent-initiated and student-run, but this independence de
taches them from the Department of Music, raising con
cern among some groups.
"We are the loudest voice of music at Stanford," said
sophomore Mike Ybarra, business manager of the Stan
ford Harmonics. "Yet we have very limited access to re
hearsal and performance space."
According to Mario Champagne, administrative direc
tor of the Department of Music, the department does noth
ing to discourage a cappella groups on campus.
"They were founded on their own needs by their own
constituencies and not spun off from the department,"
Champagne said. "So it's never been a case of the depart
ment pushing these groups away."
Champagne adds that the department goes out of its
way to provide its services to the a cappella community, in
cluding the use of Braun Music Center for group auditions
and joint events between department ensembles and the a
cappella groups.
However, some a cappella members feel that this is not
enough support from the Music Department.
"I would really like to have a contact in the Music de
partment," Ybarra said. "The a cappella community
touches more of the student population than the Music De
partment, and perhaps if we were more closely associated
both would be better off."
There are also groups who are content with the status
quo.
"Connections to the music department are great," said
sophomore Chris Andrews, financial manager of the Stan
ford Mendicants, "but such connections could truncate the
freedoms that being a self-run organization brings."
Financial issues are another concern in the a cappella

society. To maintain affiliation with the Stanford Universi
ty name, a cappella groups must bank with the ASSU, even
though they do not actually receive any funding from the
association.
"I think that a University that can afford to buy thou
sands of cases of water for Community Day can afford to
sponsor a cappella groups," said sophomore Gautam
Raghavan of the Stanford Harmonics, "especially when
[we] participate in competitions and record nationally rec
ognized albums."
"It's just a hurdle that we have to get across," Ybarra
said in reference to this lac k of support. Writing Stanford
Fund letters helps raise money, hut its funding is com
prised of donations from Stanford alumni and not Uni
versity funds.
Another problem that some avi<l # singers have encoun
tered is in acquiring University recognition for newly c re
ated a cappella groups. The Office of Student Activities
treats a cappella groups like any group that wishes to be
recognized on campus, according to Asst. Director of Stu
dent Activities Joey Greenwell.
This means that a new group must "demonstrate an
unmet need that is not duplicated by another student
group," as stated in the office handbook.
The eight University recognized groups fulfill this re
quirement by each heralding their own unique identity —
be it the hip-hop and Motown styles of Everyday l'eople,
the Christian harmonies of Testimony, or the all-female
blend of Counterpoint.
Last year, a new all-female group entitled Eclectica ap
pealed for University recognition. But the ASSU turned
down the appeal on the grounds that the group was too
similar to an already existent group.
"We were kind of disappointed at first," said sophomore
Kim Rios, one of the founders of Eclectica. "But it turned
out to be a blessing in disguise. We are happy with our sta
tus as a phantom a cappella group, and there's a lot less
pressure on us because of that."
