## The 						Stanford Daily Racial Privacy Initiative deserves close scrutiny 
### 
Published Since 1891

American Civil Rights Coalition Chair
Ward Connerly has proposed a ballot
measure for November that would
curtail the classification of people ac
cording to race, ethnicity, color or national origin
by state and local government in California. We
believe that the measure — known as the Racial
Privacy Initiative — requires careful scrutiny by
individuals before they cast their votes.
Under the initiative, students and employ
ment seekers would no longer face questions
regarding race and ethnicity on applications.
The initiative includes plans to eliminate racial
check-off boxes from state and local govern
ment forms by 2005, except for those related to
law enforcement, medical research and treat
ment and the Department of Fair Employ
ment and Housing.
Behind the initiative lies the coalition's belief
that California's government obsesses about
race. Without this obsession, the coalition feels

that the government could create a colorblind
state that places more emphasis on privacy
while offering respect for the complicated no
tion of racial identity.
Opponents of the initiative argue that the
public will no longer have access to basic infor
mation and statistics concerning race and eth
nicity. When such information is lacking, anti
discrimination law- and policy-makers may
not have the information they need to prove
whether discrimination exists.
Those who oppose Connerly's proposed ini
tiative include the ACLU, the NAACP, and the
Mexican American Legal Defense and Educa
tion Fund. Many opponents feel that the initia
tive poses a great threat to the progress made
thus far in race relations and addressing in
equalities among communities of color.
While Connerly and the coalition propose
an ideal form of a colorblind society, the fact re
mains that people have eyes and will continue

to notice differences between races despite
what the letter of the law dictates. Ballot mea
sures such as the initiative imply that race rela
tions and equal opportunities have risen to
such a level that there is no longer a need for
such check boxes on applications or legal
forms. This idea is difficult to believe at a time
when the debate over reparations for slavery
churns at the state and national levels.
Not surprisingly, in 1996 Connerly was one
of the main proponents of Proposition 209,
which sought to end affirmative action in Cali
fornia, while the ACLU, NAACP and Mexican
American Legal Defense and Education fund
were the main opponents of Connerly's initia
tive then. Although Proposition 209 passed at
the polls, it was invalidated by the courts.
Six years later, these same adversaries con
tinue to argue about similar racial and ethnic
issues, just under a different name. The battle
may reach some sort of resolution at the hands

of voters in this fall's election.
We acknowledge that the initiative has its
merits. However, the psychological benefits of
protecting one's privacy by not having to face
the racial check-off boxes on legal forms seems
like a high price to pay when many could plau
sibly still be suffering from racial discrimina
tion. If one feels sufficiently strongly, one can
usually decline to answer the race question
with no adverse consequences.
We encourage voters to start discussing and
examining the issue before the November bal
lot, focusing on what price they would be will
ing to pay for such privacy.
We agree with the coalition that racial and
ethnic identity is a complex concept. Yet it is a
question that each individual must face. It is far
better that people tackle the complicated ques
tions rather than ignore them by imagining
that a colorblind society and an equal society
are the same thing.
