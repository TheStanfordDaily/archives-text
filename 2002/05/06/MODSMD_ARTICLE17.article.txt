# DANCING IN CIRCLES
## Time to get disorganized 
### 
As graduation approaches and we
seniors cautiously send out our
tentacles to check out life outside
the bubble, we are beginning to
understand that the big scary "real world"
doesn't make much sense at all.
In a couple of months, we are told, we
will have the freedom to live however we
choose. We will not be required to have
health insurance, nor will it be paid for by
University grants and loans. VVe can live
anywhere, work anywhere—anywhere,
that is, we can find a job and affordable
housing. We will have to do whatever work
someone has decided to pay for, whether
or not we find it enjoyable.
For the most part, though, we are lucky,

as a degree from Stanford
will afford us a greater
range of jobs that people
are willing to pay us to do.
But that doesn't mean we
are free to do as we please.
We are not constructing
our world from the
ground up; for the most
part, our options for ac-

ceptable paths have been laid for us.
We want to be able to live at least com
fortably, with enough time off to pursue
the things that give us pleasure. We want to
exercise our creativity at work, to build
something we can feel proud of. But the re
ality is that in many fields, you only gain
those benefits when you achieve a certain
rank within a company or organization.
And along with that rank, you usually
gain power over others in the organiza
tion. Now it is you who dictates how the
work will be done. You are the one with
creative license, and everyone else must clo
as you say. It's funny how the very thing for
which we strive is the thing we take away
from others the moment we attain it. But
that's just the way things work, right?
Not necessarily. There are many who
dream of a different kind of society — and
some of them are called anarchists.
There are many and varied definitions
of anarchy, and I don't claim to be an ex
pert on the subject. For readers who are in
terested, there is a wealth of resources on
the web and a Student Initiated Course on
anarchy offered at Stanford. " The Dispos
sessed" by Ursula K. LeCJuin is an excellent
novel illustrating anarchist principles.
A basic definition of anarchy would
have to include a lack of social hierarchy,
respect for individual liberty, and a sense
that through this freedom a better society
can be achieved. Without formal govern
ment or laws, people would be free to do
whatever they wished. In a society without
hierarchy, cooperation would lx- empha
sized. It is expected that people would get

together to work for the good of the com
munity. Given the chance, people like to
be productive.
But what about all the yucky jobs, like
cleaning the toilets and processing sewage?
The work could be shared, with everyone
taking a turn at a job nobody wanted. And
what about the risky jobs, like mining for
coal? Perhaps we'd rethink our need for
certain products if everyone knew she or
he might be called upon to perform these
dangerous tasks.
You might wonder, though, how could
a society function without hierarchy? How
would anything ever get done? Who
would tell everyone what they were sup
posed to do and when? Wouldn't society
dissolve into chaos?
But then, don't we live in a world of
chaos already? Millions of people are out of
work and have no means to support their
families. People are starving while the gov
ernment is paying farmers not to produce
too much food.
We are spiraling toward a time when
pollution will cause respiratory diseases,
immigration will be severely limited, and a
fifth of American kids will grow up in
poverty. Oops, that's where we are now.
So who is to say society functions well
with a hierarchy?
The absence of hierarchy does not
necessarily translate to a lack of organiza
tion. Just because no one owns the water
supply doesn't mean no one cares about
making sine it's clean. People could still
hold specialized jobs in society; there
would still be a management plan. And if
we each felt that we had a greater ability
to affect our communities, perhaps we
would put in more time and effort into
building them.
But what about crime and punishment?
I low are we to keep people from, say, com
mitting murder? An anarchist might argue
that social pressure is as effective or more
so than punishment by police and law.
Ethics is, after all, nothing more than a so
cial consensus on the types of behavior we
find acceptable. And maybe with no law
makers that consensus would reflect the
will of the majority and not just the posi
tions of those with power.
On the other hand if social pressure is as
strong a force as law, perhaps it would limit
liberty to the same degree. Maybe our free
dom would be traded for social approval,
rather than out of material necessity. But
hey, there are a million questions like that.
Please discuss.
