Senior responds to David Gal's letter
I would like to make two points con
cerning David Gal's letter to the editor
("Wire articles spread lies about the Mid
dle East," 5/3).
First, his contention that "even
Amnesty International, Human Rights
Watch and the Palestinians have admitted
that in fact there was no massacre in
Jenin," is grossly misleading.
The latest Human Rights Watch report
on Jenin, dated May 2002, states the fol
lowing: "Human Rights Watch found no
evidence to sustain c laims of massacres or
large-scale extrajudicial executions by the
[Israeli army] in Jenin refugee camp.
However, many of the civilian deaths doc
umented by Human Rights Watch
amounted to unlawful or willful killings by
the [Israeli army]."
The report details the tactics used by
the Israeli army and lays out why
Human Rights Watch believes them to
be unlawful.
Though Gal's original words may be
strictly true from a semantic standpoint,
the spirit of his letter, I believe, was that
nothing of consequence happened in
Jenin, and that to report otherwise would
not be "objective."
Ironic, then, that Gal fails to acknowl
edge that the facts surrounding the recent
operation in Jenin are still very much in
contention between the Israeli army, the
Palestinians and observer groups like
Human Rights Watch, even though the
events did not meet the definition of "mas
sacre" or "genocide."

Clearly, something happened in Jenin,
and it would behoove all of us here at Stan
ford to let those involved in the heart of
the conflict ascertain the facts, and not
make blind conjecture about what is
"truth"and what is "propaganda."
My second point is more general and
relates to Gal's cry for "objectivity." To
this, I agree without reservation, and I
must say that myself and many, many oth
ers have been disgusted by the blatantly bi
ased, nationalistic and ethno-centric let
ters and columns printed in The Daily by
supporters from both sides of the conflict.
Stanford prides itself on being a mar
ketplace of ideas, but with this pluralism
comes a responsibility to be impartial, or at
the very least empathetic, to others' ideas.
On this point, some in the Stanford com
munity have failed.
I feel now like I cannot ask questions
about Yasser Arafat's past without inciting a
verbal onslaught from certain Palestinian
supporters, or criticize Ariel Sharon with
out being branded "anti-Semitic" or "anti-
Israel" by some patriotic Israelis.
Such a stigma does not exist in Israel, so
why should it be so pervasive here? The fact
that the conflict in Jenin is one with deep re
ligious and cultural roots does not excuse a
proxy war of words here in Palo Alto.
I respect the right to free expression for
all people, including Gal, and I would
never request that The Daily cease pub
lishing letters that clearly favor one side,
nor that students and faculty stop talking
about an intractable conflict that may
touch them on many different levels.
It saddens me, however, that some in

the Stanford community abuse their free
dom of speech to attack others in their
own community, rather than engage in
productive dialogue.

Peaceful option does exist
in the Middle East
To answer Lars Harsson's "simple
questions" from his May 3 letter: Yes, an
enlightened, peaceful option does exist in
the Middle East. And yes, 1 am confident it
will be adopted by Israel's government —
whoever will be leading it then—once ter
ror is decisively defeated.
What is this option, and when will it be
come feasible? The two are interrelated. It
will become feasible when the West Bank
and Gaza Arabs—known since the 1960's
as Palestinians—choose or accept a leader
ship that prefers peace to war, affirms life
rather than glorifying death, values Pales
tinian lives at least as much as the Israeli
army does, opts for democratic nation
building alongside the Jewish state rather
than trying to supplant it, and makes its
educational and political choices accord
ingly.
Such a leadership could either arise
spontaneously and be the first such in the
Arab world, or be imposed as recently
done by the United States in Afghanistan.
It is unlikely to happen unless the West
