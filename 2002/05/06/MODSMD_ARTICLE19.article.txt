Senior responds to David Gal's letter
I would like to make two points con
cerning David Gal's letter to the editor
("Wire articles spread lies about the Mid
dle East," 5/3).
First, his contention that "even
Amnesty International, Human Rights
Watch and the Palestinians have admitted
that in fact there was no massacre in
Jenin," is grossly misleading.
The latest Human Rights Watch report
on Jenin, dated May 2002, states the fol
lowing: "Human Rights Watch found no
evidence to sustain c laims of massacres or
large-scale extrajudicial executions by the
[Israeli army] in Jenin refugee camp.
However, many of the civilian deaths doc
umented by Human Rights Watch
amounted to unlawful or willful killings by
the [Israeli army]."
The report details the tactics used by
the Israeli army and lays out why
Human Rights Watch believes them to
be unlawful.
Though Gal's original words may be
strictly true from a semantic standpoint,
the spirit of his letter, I believe, was that
nothing of consequence happened in
Jenin, and that to report otherwise would
not be "objective."
Ironic, then, that Gal fails to acknowl
edge that the facts surrounding the recent
operation in Jenin are still very much in
contention between the Israeli army, the
Palestinians and observer groups like
Human Rights Watch, even though the
events did not meet the definition of "mas
sacre" or "genocide."

Clearly, something happened in Jenin,
and it would behoove all of us here at Stan
ford to let those involved in the heart of
the conflict ascertain the facts, and not
make blind conjecture about what is
"truth"and what is "propaganda."
My second point is more general and
relates to Gal's cry for "objectivity." To
this, I agree without reservation, and I
must say that myself and many, many oth
ers have been disgusted by the blatantly bi
ased, nationalistic and ethno-centric let
ters and columns printed in The Daily by
supporters from both sides of the conflict.
Stanford prides itself on being a mar
ketplace of ideas, but with this pluralism
comes a responsibility to be impartial, or at
the very least empathetic, to others' ideas.
On this point, some in the Stanford com
munity have failed.
I feel now like I cannot ask questions
about Yasser Arafat's past without inciting a
verbal onslaught from certain Palestinian
supporters, or criticize Ariel Sharon with
out being branded "anti-Semitic" or "anti-
Israel" by some patriotic Israelis.
Such a stigma does not exist in Israel, so
why should it be so pervasive here? The fact
that the conflict in Jenin is one with deep re
ligious and cultural roots does not excuse a
proxy war of words here in Palo Alto.
I respect the right to free expression for
all people, including Gal, and I would
never request that The Daily cease pub
lishing letters that clearly favor one side,
nor that students and faculty stop talking
about an intractable conflict that may
touch them on many different levels.
It saddens me, however, that some in

the Stanford community abuse their free
dom of speech to attack others in their
own community, rather than engage in
productive dialogue.

Peaceful option does exist
in the Middle East
To answer Lars Harsson's "simple
questions" from his May 3 letter: Yes, an
enlightened, peaceful option does exist in
the Middle East. And yes, 1 am confident it
will be adopted by Israel's government —
whoever will be leading it then—once ter
ror is decisively defeated.
What is this option, and when will it be
come feasible? The two are interrelated. It
will become feasible when the West Bank
and Gaza Arabs—known since the 1960's
as Palestinians—choose or accept a leader
ship that prefers peace to war, affirms life
rather than glorifying death, values Pales
tinian lives at least as much as the Israeli
army does, opts for democratic nation
building alongside the Jewish state rather
than trying to supplant it, and makes its
educational and political choices accord
ingly.
Such a leadership could either arise
spontaneously and be the first such in the
Arab world, or be imposed as recently
done by the United States in Afghanistan.
It is unlikely to happen unless the West
makes clear to the Palestinian Authority,
to such terror-sponsoring nations as Iran,
Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and to other Arab
states that hatred of Jews is not the route to
peace and coexistence.
And, of course, Yasser Arafat — that in
veterate terrorist whose spoken words and
signed commitments in English have been
proven time and again to be written on ice
— is unlikely to play any role in such a
peace leadership.
But Harsson can rest assured that the
vast majority of Israelis are very interested
in such an option, and ipso facto so are
their democratically elected leaders.
And what would be the fruits of imple
menting the peace option? It would inex
orably lead to a generous, win-win negoti
ated peace, and to the establishment of a
prosperous, 23rd Arab state — demilita
rized of course, and possibly in confedera
tion with Jordan, which in any case consti
tutes the bulk of the 1917 British Mandate
called "Palestine."
This rosy future could have already
come to pass years ago. That it has not is
solely the fault of Arafat's corrupt and anti
life Palestinian Authority, and of the naive
people in Israel and the West who installed

this mafia in the West Bank and Gaza, to
the detriment of both Arabs and Jews.

Rice shares responsibility for many
dangerous policies
It was disturbing to read in the Com
mencement 2002 section of Friday's Daily
a reprint of the article announcing the
choice of National Security Adviser Con
doleezza Rice as this year's Commence
ment speaker.
The article quoted University President
John Hennessy as saying it was "an in
spired recommendation," and according
to Senior Class President Nicholas Larson,
"The profound events of the last five
months have made it clear we are not alone
in the pride we take in her leadership."
Such statements ignore the fact that
Rice has given up her role as a scholar to
take part in an administration whose ac
tions have too often been both dangerous
and inept.
Shortly before President George W.
Bush was elected, Rice, as his foreign poli
cy adviser, declared in an article for For
eign Affairs magazine that a Republican
administration would "proceed from the
firm ground of the national interest, not
from the interests of an illusory interna

tional community."
Immediately on taking office, Bush fol
lowed through by rejecting international
treaties on nuclear testing, global warm
ing, biological and chemical warfare and
arms control. He plans to "unsign" a treaty
ratified by every major nation but Israel
and China to establish an international
criminal court.
As a key member of the administration,
Rice shares responsibility fora war on
Afghanistan that killed an estimated 4,000
civilians but has only replaced the Taliban
with equally brutal warlords.
She is a supporter of Bush's ill-defined
"war on terrorism" that is sending U.S.
troops to every corner of the globe and do
mestically serves as an excuse to harass im
migrants and undermine the criminal jus
tice system. Rice voiced no objection when
Bush cutoff U.S. contributions to the U.N.
Population Fund, which provides life-sav
ing reproductive health service for women
in poor countries.
With Rice's advice and support, Bush
dropped all pretense of acting as impar
tial mediator in the Middle East conflict
and allied himself firmly on the side of
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, calling
Sharon "a man of peace" as the Israeli
army used American-made helicopter
gunships and tanks to turn Palestinian
refugee camps and cities into what The
New York Times called "a landscape of
devastation."

Rice is part of the policy team that is
preparing to oust Saddam Hussein for re
fusing to allow U.N. arms inspectors into
Iraq, but when Sharon defied the U.N. Se
curity Council by refusing to allow an in
vestigation of Israel's attack on Jenin, Rice
delivered a message from Bush assuring
Sharon that the United States "will be with
you the entire way."
Rice is the mentor of a president who
is seeking huge increases in a military
budget that already exceeds the com
bined defense expenditures of every
other country in the world, and he's
doing so while cutting funds for health
care, housing and education.
She serves an administration that is
provoking a nuclear arms race by opting
out of the anti-ballistic missile treaty and
abandoning the longstanding policy of
nuclear deterrence. According to the
Pentagon's Nuclear Posture Review, the
United States will now consider using nu
clear bombs in case of war between China
and Taiwan, war between Israel and
Iraq, an invasion of South Korea by
North Korea, or other "surprising mili
tary developments."
Finally, Rice took part in the adminis
tration's embarrassing blunder when it
openly welcomed a coup against
Venezuela's democratically elected presi
dent, Hugo Chavez, last April.
After a few military officers and indus
trialists seized the government and in

stalled the head of the business lobby,
Pedro Carrnona, as president, Latin
American leaders expressed unanimous
dismay at what they saw as an assault
on democracy.
Not so the Bush administration,
which immediately promised Carmona
its support. Carmona was quickly ousted
after he dissolved the legislature, fired
the supreme court and abolished the
constitution, but this didn't stop Rice
from warning Chavez, when he re
turned to office, to "respect constitu
tional processes."
Rice served Stanford well as a teacher
and provost, but she is now a strategist and
fervent ally of a president whose pro
foundly right-wing policies pose a danger
to peace abroad and to our own 112 reedom at
home. As Hennessy said, she does have "a
central place on the world stage," but we
should ask if the world is any safer because
of it.
