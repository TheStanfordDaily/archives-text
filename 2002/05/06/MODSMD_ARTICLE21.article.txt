### KIRSTEN BOURNE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It may seem that nothing is a better cap
on a season than a championship win. But
today when the Stanford lacrosse team
won the Mountain Pacific Lacrosse
League title, it rejoiced about more than
just the final score. The Cardinal left the
field feeling that it had finally achieved the
consistency and mental focus it had
strived for all season.
With a 16-7 victory against California, the
Cardinal ended its season with an overall
record of 11-7 and an impressive MPLL
record of 10-0. To advance to the final round
of the tournament, Stanford held off St.
Mary's on Saturday, 14-11.

for the Cardinal, despite its prior dominance
over the teams in the league. That is because
the MPLL is a new league, formed from the
Western Women's Lacrosse League.
One of Stanford's greatest accomplish
ments on Sunday was the fact that this was
the third matchup this season between the
Bay Area rivals. The Cardinal succeeded
by playing its own game without regard for
the opponent.

Midfielder Julia Calzonefti looks to pass downfield. The Stanford women's lacrosse team won the
Mountain Pacific Lacrosse League Championship this weekend with a 16-7 win over Cal.
"We were thinking of our
goals," said head coach Michele
Uhlfelder, "And not about play
ing Gal fora third time."
Uhlfelder recognized that focus
is especially challenging to main
tain in a league where Stanford is
the frontrunner.
Sophomore midfielder Tiffany
Chao echoed those sentiments
about playing a team for the third
time.
"Even though we had beaten
them before, this time we beat them
and played our best," said Ghao.
The last week may have been
especially instrumental for the
Cardinal's mental preparation
and keeping everyone's mind in
the same place.
"We did a lot of off-the field
preparation in the last four days
that helped us take a big step," said
Uhlfelder. "People really invested
in the last week, and I congratulate
them on that."
Consistency was the key to the
championship game.
"Most of Cal's goals were tran
sition goals," said Grube. "They
didn't get many chances to settle
an attack."
Conte attributed her team's
prowess to great communication,
and added, "Today we really
demonstrated what we'd learned
the past few days. We had a chance
to execute specific scoring plays
and short, accurate passes around
the goal."
With the season done, the Car
dinal will now have a chance to sit
back and reflect on its major
achievements of the season, includ
ing its impressive undefeated con
ference record.
"We're all really happy with our
play today," said sophomore mid
fielder Noor Dawood. "Not be
cause of the scoreboard, but be
cause we met some major team
goals that we've been working on
all season."
