It may seem that nothing is a better cap
on a season than a championship win. But
today when the Stanford lacrosse team
won the Mountain Pacific Lacrosse
League title, it rejoiced about more than
just the final score. The Cardinal left the
field feeling that it had finally achieved the
consistency and mental focus it had
strived for all season.
With a 16-7 victory against California, the
Cardinal ended its season with an overall
record of 11-7 and an impressive MPLL
record of 10-0. To advance to the final round
of the tournament, Stanford held off St.
Mary's on Saturday, 14-11.

for the Cardinal, despite its prior dominance
over the teams in the league. That is because
the MPLL is a new league, formed from the
Western Women's Lacrosse League.
One of Stanford's greatest accomplish
ments on Sunday was the fact that this was
the third matchup this season between the
Bay Area rivals. The Cardinal succeeded
by playing its own game without regard for
the opponent.
