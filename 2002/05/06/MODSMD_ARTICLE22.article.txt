### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
And you thought they were out of it.
Just when the No. 9 Cardinal seemed
to he fading into the middle of the Pacif
ic 10 Conference race and putting its
chances to host postseason games in
jeopardy, head coach Mark Marquess'
squad responded with a crucial three
game sweep of rival California at Sunken
Diamond over the weekend.

BASEBALL
Friday: No. 9 Stanford 8, California 4
Saturday: No. 9 Stanford 13, Cali
fornia's
Sunday: No. 9 Stanford 8, California 5

In front of a season-high crowd of
4,143, Stanford (32-13, 9-6 Pac-10)
held on for an 8-5 Sunday victory over
the Rears (26-26, 8-13 Pac-10) to claw
within two games of league-leader
Southern California with nine games
to play.
"A sweep is huge," Marquess said. "If
you get a chance to sweep, you better
take advantage of it because it's difficult
to do with the people we play."
Freshman centerfielder Sam Fuld led
the way offensively for Stanford, which
has struggled to score runs in recent
weeks. Fuld continued his hot hitting
with a 7-for-12 weekend and two rare
home runs, including a go-ahead shot to
right in the fifth inning yesterday.
"I can't really explain it; I've just been
in a zone," Fuld said. "The important
thing is to maintain a good consistent
stroke, and my confidence is huge, and
t hose two things have been keeping me
hot."
"I just hope his home run power
doesn't screw up his stroke," Marquess
joked. "But he's been our best hitter for
the last 15 or 20 games. He's really
swung the bat well and gotten on base,
I've hit and run with him, and he's
stealing bases. He's playing the best
baseball since he's been at Stanford for
sure."
Fuld, who now has 12 multiple-hit
games in the Cardinal's last 13 contests,
swung the key bat fora recharged Cardi
nal lineup, which pounded out 29 runs

on 32 hits against the Bears.
Sophomore pitcher John Hudgins
improved to a perfect 8-0 yesterday
despite looking shaky at times. He bat
tled through six innings, allowing five
runs on nine hits, but picked up the
win with the help of the rejuvenated
offense .
"I don't think Hudgins had the kind
of stuff he usually does, but he hung in
there for us," Marquess said. "To be hon
est with you, we pitched a lot better
against Washington and Oregon State
than we did this weekend. But we hit the
ball better this weekend and I think that
was the difference."
Junior reliever Ryan McCally pitched
well and notched his sixth save of the sea
son with two innings of one-hit ball to
close out yesterday's victory.
Senior shortstop Scott Dragicevich
excelled over the weekend, playing for
the final time against his younger
brother Jeff, the starting shortstop for
Cal. He hit a second-inning home run
yesterday that was his second of the se
ries and made an outstanding defensive
play diving to his right as well.

"Cal's always a big series for us as a
team, and especially for me with my
brother on the other side, so it's fun to
play well," Dragicevich said.
Dragicevich also provided the key
blow in Saturday's contest, a go-ahead
sixth-inning grand slam that powered
the Cardinal to a 13-6 win.
"Baseball's a weird thing where you
just get in a groove, and I just feel real
comfortable at the plate and I'm really
seeing the pitches well," Dragicevich
said of his first two home runs of the
season.
Dragicevich and Stanford overcame
another shaky Saturday performance
from junior pitcher Tim Cunningham,
whose on-and-off weekend outings have
tested Cardinal fans' nerves all season
long.
The lefty lasted just four-plus innings,
but McCally and senior pitcher Dan Rich
held the Bears to just two runs the rest of
the way.
Junior catcher Ryan Garko also set a
career high with four RBI on Saturday,

belting a three-run shot to left in
the sixth as a prelude to Dragice
vich's grand slam and adding a
sacrifice lly two innings later.
Stanford took the all-impor
tant Friday night series opener,
8-4, on the strength of a complete
game from junior starter Jeremy
Guthrie.
Guthrie struggled early, but al
lowed just one liit after the fourth
inning, retiring 17 Bears in a row

before a ninth-inning bum single
from the Bears' David Horwitz.
"I think I was trying a little too
hard in the early innings, trying
to do some things I probably
couldn't do," said Guthrie, who
piled up a season-high 10 strike
outs and improved to 7-1 on the
season. "1 think I settled down,
and our team did a great job of
hitting in those early innings to
keep us in it."
Guthrie allowed single runs in
the first and second but still led 4-
2 after an RBI double from
Garko and a two-run homer off
the bat of sophomore rightfielder

Carlos Quentin in the bottom of
the third.
Pitching with a two-run lead
for the first time since a March
23 outing at USC, Guthrie
squandered the opportunity and
allowed the Bears to tie it with
two runs in the fourth. However,
the Cardinal offense responded
with a pair of fifth-inning runs to
provide the deciding scores, and
Guthrie went the distance to
take advantage of his second
chance.
The Cardinal's sweep of the
Golden Bears was its first since
February 2000.

Sunday: No. 9 Stanford 8, California 5

In front of a season-high crowd of
4,143, Stanford (32-13, 9-6 Pac-10)
held on for an 8-5 Sunday victory over
the Rears (26-26, 8-13 Pac-10) to claw
within two games of league-leader
Southern California with nine games
to play.
"A sweep is huge," Marquess said. "If
you get a chance to sweep, you better
take advantage of it because it's difficult
to do with the people we play."
Freshman centerfielder Sam Fuld led
the way offensively for Stanford, which
has struggled to score runs in recent
weeks. Fuld continued his hot hitting
with a 7-for-12 weekend and two rare
home runs, including a go-ahead shot to
right in the fifth inning yesterday.
"I can't really explain it; I've just been
in a zone," Fuld said. "The important
thing is to maintain a good consistent
stroke, and my confidence is huge, and
t hose two things have been keeping me
hot."
"I just hope his home run power
doesn't screw up his stroke," Marquess
joked. "But he's been our best hitter for
the last 15 or 20 games. He's really
swung the bat well and gotten on base,
I've hit and run with him, and he's
stealing bases. He's playing the best
baseball since he's been at Stanford for
sure."
Fuld, who now has 12 multiple-hit
games in the Cardinal's last 13 contests,
swung the key bat fora recharged Cardi
nal lineup, which pounded out 29 runs

on 32 hits against the Bears.
Sophomore pitcher John Hudgins
improved to a perfect 8-0 yesterday
despite looking shaky at times. He bat
tled through six innings, allowing five
runs on nine hits, but picked up the
win with the help of the rejuvenated
offense .
"I don't think Hudgins had the kind
of stuff he usually does, but he hung in
there for us," Marquess said. "To be hon
est with you, we pitched a lot better
against Washington and Oregon State
than we did this weekend. But we hit the
ball better this weekend and I think that
was the difference."
Junior reliever Ryan McCally pitched
well and notched his sixth save of the sea
son with two innings of one-hit ball to
close out yesterday's victory.
Senior shortstop Scott Dragicevich
excelled over the weekend, playing for
the final time against his younger
brother Jeff, the starting shortstop for
Cal. He hit a second-inning home run
yesterday that was his second of the se
ries and made an outstanding defensive
play diving to his right as well.

"Cal's always a big series for us as a
team, and especially for me with my
brother on the other side, so it's fun to
play well," Dragicevich said.
Dragicevich also provided the key
blow in Saturday's contest, a go-ahead
sixth-inning grand slam that powered
the Cardinal to a 13-6 win.
"Baseball's a weird thing where you
just get in a groove, and I just feel real
comfortable at the plate and I'm really
seeing the pitches well," Dragicevich
said of his first two home runs of the
season.
Dragicevich and Stanford overcame
another shaky Saturday performance
from junior pitcher Tim Cunningham,
whose on-and-off weekend outings have
tested Cardinal fans' nerves all season
long.
The lefty lasted just four-plus innings,
but McCally and senior pitcher Dan Rich
held the Bears to just two runs the rest of
the way.
Junior catcher Ryan Garko also set a
career high with four RBI on Saturday,

belting a three-run shot to left in
the sixth as a prelude to Dragice
vich's grand slam and adding a
sacrifice lly two innings later.
Stanford took the all-impor
tant Friday night series opener,
8-4, on the strength of a complete
game from junior starter Jeremy
Guthrie.
Guthrie struggled early, but al
lowed just one liit after the fourth
inning, retiring 17 Bears in a row

before a ninth-inning bum single
from the Bears' David Horwitz.
"I think I was trying a little too
hard in the early innings, trying
to do some things I probably
couldn't do," said Guthrie, who
piled up a season-high 10 strike
outs and improved to 7-1 on the
season. "1 think I settled down,
and our team did a great job of
hitting in those early innings to
keep us in it."
Guthrie allowed single runs in
the first and second but still led 4-
2 after an RBI double from
Garko and a two-run homer off
the bat of sophomore rightfielder

Carlos Quentin in the bottom of
the third.
Pitching with a two-run lead
for the first time since a March
23 outing at USC, Guthrie
squandered the opportunity and
allowed the Bears to tie it with
two runs in the fourth. However,
the Cardinal offense responded
with a pair of fifth-inning runs to
provide the deciding scores, and
Guthrie went the distance to
take advantage of his second
chance.
The Cardinal's sweep of the
Golden Bears was its first since
February 2000.
