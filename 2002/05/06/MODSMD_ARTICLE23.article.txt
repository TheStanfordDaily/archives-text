# Volleyball pushed season to the brink
## 
### KATRINA LAKE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a season that started and
ended in Provo, Utah in matches
against Brigham Young, one
might think that the Stanford
men's volleyball team simply
came full circle during the 2001
season, but in truth, the team
made significant strides over the
year.
No. 8 Stanford (17-9, 15-7
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) finished its season with a
narrow 3-2 (30-24, 30-23, 24-30,
29-31, 21-19) loss to No. 3 BYU
(23-7, 16-6 MPSF) in the semi
final round of the MPSF Confer
ence Tournament on April 20.
"The guys went really hard
and we almost pulled it off. It was
an unbelievable game. I was real
ly proud," said head coach Don
Shaw.
The Cardinal squad that faced
BYU that day was significantly
different from the squad that
faced the Cougars on Jan. 11, at
the beginning of the conference
season.
At the start of the season, the
Stanford team looked like it was
built on the talent of individuals.
The offensive contributions of re
turning Ail-American players ju
nior opposite Curt Toppel and se
nior outside hitter Marcus Skacel
were hard to ignore.
However, by the end of the sea
son, the Cardinal's prowess could
be attributed not to one individ
ual's efforts but to the efforts of
the team as a whole.
"My goal at the beginning of
the season was to improve on a
daily basis and be a better team at
the end of the season than at the
beginning," said Shaw. "We defi
nitely achieved that."
By the end of the season, Stan
ford's offense dominated with the
second-highest hitting percent
age in the nation while Stanford
was represented among top-10

statistics in nearly every major of
fensive category.
I ft here was ever any question re
garding the talent and potential of
the team, the Feb. 16 match against
UCIA provided a clear answer.
"Beating UCLA brought out a
lot of what was best about the
team" said Shaw.
The Stanford team broke
UCLA's 10-game winning streak
and dropped UCLA from its top

rank in a heated 3-1 victory.
In front of the season's largest
crowd at Burnham Pavilion, the
Cardinal dominated the match
both offensively and defensively.
In an exhibition of depth and
consistency, four players posted
double-digit kills, and the team's
46 digs were distributed among
six different players.
However, the game against the
Bruins was only one of many im

pressive Cardinal performances
this season. Stanford pushed
both NCAA champion Hawaii
and NCAA runner-up Pepper
dine to five games before eventu
ally losing.
"Those were moral victories. I
was very happy with the way the
guys competed," said Shaw of
those games.
Although the talent of the team
at the end of the season was less
concentrated, several individual
players were recognized for their
talents.
Toppel received numerous
awards for his outstanding cam
paign. With 5.47, Toppel led
Stanford and finished second in
the conference in kills per game.
He also led the Cardinal in total
kills with 520, attacks with 998
and aces with 32.
Toppel was named to the
MPSF All-Conference first team
for the second time. After being
selected for the American Volley
ball Coaches Association All-
America second team as a fresh
man and a sophomore, Toppel
was selected as a first-team mem
ber this season.
Skacel, junior outside hitter
Billy Strickland and redshirt
freshman setter Kevin Hansen
were also recognized for their ac
complishments.
With 280 kills and 162 digs,
Skacel was second on the Cardi
nal squad, followed closely by
Strickland, who posted 243 kills
and 137 digs. In his first season
as a starter, Hansen finished fifth
in the MPSF with 13.72 assists
per game.
Skacel, Strickland, and I lansen
were also recognized with Honor
able Mention All-MPSF awards.
The Cardinal will return 11
players to next year's team and al
though Stanford will lose strong
holds in Skacel and senior libero
Seth Ring, the arrival of four
freshman recruits improves next
year's outlook.
