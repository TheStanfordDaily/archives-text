Friday: No. 7 Stanford 9,
No. 4 Arizona State 1
Saturday: No. 2 Arizona 3,
No. 7 Stanford 2

No. 7 Stanford 1

Despite a big win over No. 4
Arizona State (40-15, 10-8 Pac
-10) on Friday night, the No. 2
Wildcats proved to be too much
for the Cardinal as Stanford
dropped the final two games of
the weekend.
Arizona State took two wins
from the Cardinal during its
visit to the Farm, and Stanford
was eager to return the favor.
The Cardinal, who was look
ing to stop a nine-game confer
ence losing streak, exploded of
fensively in the top of the first in
ning and took a commanding 4-
() lead.
Senior shortstop Robin
Walker and senior centerfielder
Jessica Mendoza led olf the in
ning with back-to-back singles
before senior First baseman
Sarah Beeson drove in the first
run of the game with a double to
left center.
Junior second baseman Kira
Ching followed Beeson with a
double of her own, scoring
Mendoza and freshman pinch
runner Heather Sh(x>k.

The Cardinal ended the
four-run rally in dramatic fash

a two-oilt wild pitch by pitcher
Erica Beach.
The Cardinal promptly
waged a second attack. Ching
singled in the top of the third
inning to drive in Mendoza
and increase the Cardinal lead
to 5-0.
I he Sun Devils scored their
first run in the bottom of the
fourth inning when third base
man Phelan Wright scored on a
single by Kristin Farber.
Beeson started the fifth in
ning by drawing a walk, before
Ching roped a single to right
field to put runners on first and
second.
Sophomore catcher Jessica
Allister came to the plate and
launched a three-run homer
that lifted Stanford to an 8-1
advantage.
But the Cardinal would still
not be silenced as Ching, who
would finish the day 4 for 4 with
four RBI, drove in Mendoza
with a single.
I he game was a break
through for the Cardinal of
fense and confidence was high
as Stanford traveled to Tucson
to face Arizona (47-8, 15-3 Pac
-10).
The Cardinal took an early
lead in the first game against
the Wildcats when Mendoza
reached base on a walk and
Beeson followed with a two
run home run, her fifth of the
season.
The Cardinal's 2-0 advantage
remained intact through the
bottom of the seventh inning.
But, as during their visit to
