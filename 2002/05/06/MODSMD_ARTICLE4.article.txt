# Election flaws exposed
## 
### JOHN HUETTER EDITORIAL STAFF 
The ASSU election is over and certified,
yet the Elections Commission continues to
address problems with the process. Commis
sion personnel have reported two technical
errors with the computerized voting process:
an ASSU insider was able to gain access to
voting records during the election, violating
ASSU by-laws, and three special fee groups
were left off of the ballot fora few hours.
Voting tallies improperly accessed
Concerns arose over evidence that former
Nominations Commission Chair Henry
Towsner, a junior, had accessed and viewed
the running election tallies fora total of 11
hours over the two-day election period.
Elections Commission Special Fee Coordi
nator Gina Moon raised the matter in two e
mail messages to various ASSU executive and
legislative committees this weekend. She said
she was acting on her own accord and stressed
that her action was not meant to represent the
commission.
"In my personal opinion, what I feel this
comes down to is a constitutional violation by
an individual who should know better out of
almost anyone else involved in the ASSU,"
Moon, a sophomore, wrote. "With this action
I feel that the perpetrator demonstrated a
poor ethical conscience, a disregard for the

authority of the ASSU and its constitution,
and simple disrespect to the elections process
and rules."
The ASSU by-laws state,"The technical
staff of the commission shall ensure that only
members of the commission discharging
their duties ... shall have access to any data
generated as a result of any election, until
the election is certified and voter identities
are removed."
Towsner said that he had notified Elections
Commissioner Gedioen Aloula of a flaw that
allowed anyone with access to the ASSU com
puter to log in and view or alter the election
handbook. He said he sent Aloula an e-mail a
week before campaigning started. Towsner
told The Daily that poor security in one area
meant the entire site was compromised.
Towsner said he only viewed the total num
ber of votes cast in the election and had only
shared the information with his roommate.
"I looked at the number of people who
voted," he said. "Not the number who'd voted
for any particular candidate."
The 11-hour login to the site, he said, was
an accident.
"1 just happened to leave it logged in while
1 was in class," he said.
He said he restricted his activities so as
not to influence any aspect of the election,
and watched the total number of votes out
of "curiosity."
Towsner did not alter the elec
tions results in any way, Moon said.
Towsner said he was asked by
ASSU Financial Manager Ross
Davisson on election night if he had
entered the site and how he had
done it.
"They went through the logs and
verified that I hadn't been tamper
ing with anything," Towsner said,
and so the election results were an
nounced that night.
"Obviously, there were deficien
cies within the commission, this year
pertaining to technical errors,"
Moon said, "However, it is sad that
an individual supposedly aware and
actively involved with ASSU en
deavors would abuse problems of
the commission."
Moon said she had waited three
weeks to address the matter because
"there was no opportune time" ear
lier. "We were trying to deal with
bigger things," she said, referring to
Patrick Crosetto's challenge to the
election and the special-fee groups
left off the ballot. Eventually, she
said, "1 was getting scared that it
wasn't getting brought up at all."
Moon said she doesn't want the
University to rule on the matter.
"I felt that as a strong supporters
of student voice and power that this
matter should not be taken directly
to the administration," Moon wrote
in her first e-mail.
Aloula and representatives from
the technical group were unavail
able for comment on this issue be
fore press time.
Special fee groups left off ballot
Aloula, a junior, told the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate Tuesday
that three groups — the ASSU
Course Guide, SCBN and Stanford
Mock Trial — were mistakenly left
off of the ballot on the first day of
voting for between one and four

hours each.
The ASSU (]< mrse Guide passed,
but SCBN failed to obtain enough
total student votes (15 percent ofthe
entire student body), and Mock
Trial failed to obtain a majority of
undergraduate student votes.
Aloula said at the meeting the
commission ran a few simulations
and calculated that the groups sta
tistically would have failed anyway
given voting and abstention rates.
He directed the Senate to certify
the election last Tuesday.
Senator Bo Cowgill, a junior,
noted that abstention rates couldn't
realistically be applied to the initial
hours of voting, for anyone cast ing
votes during that time would be
more enthusiastic and less inclined
to abstain.
According to Aloula, the groups
took the news well. Appropriations
Committee Chair Megan Root, a
sophomore, said Mock Trial
planned to obtain the money
through the Stanford Fund and
through ASSU general fees.
Moon said there is a provision to
fund groups who are left complete
ly off the special fees ballot by mis
take but that ii is uncertain if this ap
plies to groups left off the ballot for
a matter of hours. SCBN and Mock
Trial representatives were not avail
able for comment before press time.
Moon said the security prob
lem, as well as the groups left off
the ballot, was a result of poor com
munication between the commis
sion and the ASSU technical group
that designed the ballot and elec
tion Web site.
"There's no overlap," Moon
said. "The tech group assumed we
would ask for that kind of thing and
we assumed they would take care of
that kind of thing."
The commission hadn't met to
officially propose a solution yet, but
Moon hoped a liaison between
group would be employed in the fu
ture to ensure problems raised by
one side of the commission-tech
group partnership would be ad
dressed by the other.

voted," he said. "Not the number who'd voted
for any particular candidate."
The 11-hour login to the site, he said, was
an accident.
"1 just happened to leave it logged in while
1 was in class," he said.
He said he restricted his activities so as
not to influence any aspect of the election,
and watched the total number of votes out
of "curiosity."
Towsner did not alter the elec
tions results in any way, Moon said.
Towsner said he was asked by
ASSU Financial Manager Ross
Davisson on election night if he had
entered the site and how he had
done it.
"They went through the logs and
verified that I hadn't been tamper
ing with anything," Towsner said,
and so the election results were an
nounced that night.
"Obviously, there were deficien
cies within the commission, this year
pertaining to technical errors,"
Moon said, "However, it is sad that
an individual supposedly aware and
actively involved with ASSU en
deavors would abuse problems of
the commission."
Moon said she had waited three
weeks to address the matter because
"there was no opportune time" ear
lier. "We were trying to deal with
bigger things," she said, referring to
Patrick Crosetto's challenge to the
election and the special-fee groups
left off the ballot. Eventually, she
said, "1 was getting scared that it
wasn't getting brought up at all."
Moon said she doesn't want the
University to rule on the matter.
"I felt that as a strong supporters
of student voice and power that this
matter should not be taken directly
to the administration," Moon wrote
in her first e-mail.
Aloula and representatives from
the technical group were unavail
able for comment on this issue be
fore press time.
Special fee groups left off ballot
Aloula, a junior, told the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate Tuesday
that three groups — the ASSU
Course Guide, SCBN and Stanford
Mock Trial — were mistakenly left
off of the ballot on the first day of
voting for between one and four

hours each.
The ASSU (]< mrse Guide passed,
but SCBN failed to obtain enough
total student votes (15 percent ofthe
entire student body), and Mock
Trial failed to obtain a majority of
undergraduate student votes.
Aloula said at the meeting the
commission ran a few simulations
and calculated that the groups sta
tistically would have failed anyway
given voting and abstention rates.
He directed the Senate to certify
the election last Tuesday.
Senator Bo Cowgill, a junior,
noted that abstention rates couldn't
realistically be applied to the initial
hours of voting, for anyone cast ing
votes during that time would be
more enthusiastic and less inclined
to abstain.
According to Aloula, the groups
took the news well. Appropriations
Committee Chair Megan Root, a
sophomore, said Mock Trial
planned to obtain the money
through the Stanford Fund and
through ASSU general fees.
Moon said there is a provision to
fund groups who are left complete
ly off the special fees ballot by mis
take but that ii is uncertain if this ap
plies to groups left off the ballot for
a matter of hours. SCBN and Mock
Trial representatives were not avail
able for comment before press time.
Moon said the security prob
lem, as well as the groups left off
the ballot, was a result of poor com
munication between the commis
sion and the ASSU technical group
that designed the ballot and elec
tion Web site.
"There's no overlap," Moon
said. "The tech group assumed we
would ask for that kind of thing and
we assumed they would take care of
that kind of thing."
The commission hadn't met to
officially propose a solution yet, but
Moon hoped a liaison between
group would be employed in the fu
ture to ensure problems raised by
one side of the commission-tech
group partnership would be ad
dressed by the other.
The ASSU election is over and certified,
yet the Elections Commission continues to
address problems with the process. Commis
sion personnel have reported two technical
errors with the computerized voting process:
an ASSU insider was able to gain access to
voting records during the election, violating
ASSU by-laws, and three special fee groups
were left off of the ballot fora few hours.
Voting tallies improperly accessed
Concerns arose over evidence that former
Nominations Commission Chair Henry
Towsner, a junior, had accessed and viewed
the running election tallies fora total of 11
hours over the two-day election period.
Elections Commission Special Fee Coordi
nator Gina Moon raised the matter in two e
mail messages to various ASSU executive and
legislative committees this weekend. She said
she was acting on her own accord and stressed
that her action was not meant to represent the
commission.
"In my personal opinion, what I feel this
comes down to is a constitutional violation by
an individual who should know better out of
almost anyone else involved in the ASSU,"
Moon, a sophomore, wrote. "With this action
I feel that the perpetrator demonstrated a
poor ethical conscience, a disregard for the

authority of the ASSU and its constitution,
and simple disrespect to the elections process
and rules."
The ASSU by-laws state,"The technical
staff of the commission shall ensure that only
members of the commission discharging
their duties ... shall have access to any data
generated as a result of any election, until
the election is certified and voter identities
are removed."
Towsner said that he had notified Elections
Commissioner Gedioen Aloula of a flaw that
allowed anyone with access to the ASSU com
puter to log in and view or alter the election
handbook. He said he sent Aloula an e-mail a
week before campaigning started. Towsner
told The Daily that poor security in one area
meant the entire site was compromised.
Towsner said he only viewed the total num
ber of votes cast in the election and had only
shared the information with his roommate.
"I looked at the number of people who
voted," he said. "Not the number who'd voted
for any particular candidate."
The 11-hour login to the site, he said, was
an accident.
