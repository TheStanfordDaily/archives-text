# Election flaws exposed
## 
### JOHN HUETTER EDITORIAL STAFF 
The ASSU election is over and certified,
yet the Elections Commission continues to
address problems with the process. Commis
sion personnel have reported two technical
errors with the computerized voting process:
an ASSU insider was able to gain access to
voting records during the election, violating
ASSU by-laws, and three special fee groups
were left off of the ballot fora few hours.
Voting tallies improperly accessed
Concerns arose over evidence that former
Nominations Commission Chair Henry
Towsner, a junior, had accessed and viewed
the running election tallies fora total of 11
hours over the two-day election period.
Elections Commission Special Fee Coordi
nator Gina Moon raised the matter in two e
mail messages to various ASSU executive and
legislative committees this weekend. She said
she was acting on her own accord and stressed
that her action was not meant to represent the
commission.
"In my personal opinion, what I feel this
comes down to is a constitutional violation by
an individual who should know better out of
almost anyone else involved in the ASSU,"
Moon, a sophomore, wrote. "With this action
I feel that the perpetrator demonstrated a
poor ethical conscience, a disregard for the

authority of the ASSU and its constitution,
and simple disrespect to the elections process
and rules."
The ASSU by-laws state,"The technical
staff of the commission shall ensure that only
members of the commission discharging
their duties ... shall have access to any data
generated as a result of any election, until
the election is certified and voter identities
are removed."
Towsner said that he had notified Elections
Commissioner Gedioen Aloula of a flaw that
allowed anyone with access to the ASSU com
puter to log in and view or alter the election
handbook. He said he sent Aloula an e-mail a
week before campaigning started. Towsner
told The Daily that poor security in one area
meant the entire site was compromised.
Towsner said he only viewed the total num
ber of votes cast in the election and had only
shared the information with his roommate.
"I looked at the number of people who
voted," he said. "Not the number who'd voted
for any particular candidate."
The 11-hour login to the site, he said, was
an accident.
"1 just happened to leave it logged in while
1 was in class," he said.
He said he restricted his activities so as
not to influence any aspect of the election,
and watched the total number of votes out
