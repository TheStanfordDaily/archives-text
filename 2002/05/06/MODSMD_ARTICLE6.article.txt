### AMIT GARG STAFF WRITER 
The Leaning Tower of Pasta,
Finding Iron in your Cereal,
Having Fun with Polymers â€”
these are some of the creative
ways elementary school students
learned about science and engi
neering on Saturday.
These workshops were part of
"Exploring New Worlds," an an
nual event organized by the Soci
ety of Women Engineers. This
year over 300 students from nine
different schools as well as over
100 volunteers participated.
The events involved many
hours of work all over campus.
The workshops were held in a
variety of buildings, with TCSeq
as the center of activities. Be
tween events many students
hopped into the nearby foun
tains and enjoyed a day of fun
and learning.
Junior Roxann Stafford, the
co-coordinator of the event, em
phasized that many participants
were from disadvantaged back
grounds, coming from schools
with low test scores.
"The focus is on science but
what we really want is to make
these kids feel noble and realize
they can do whatever they want,"
she said.
This year each student attend
ed three of 19 workshops in the
morning. In the afternoon they
engaged in a competition to build

balloon rocket cars, which, re
quired them to apply basic princi
ples of design and aerodynamics
to build efficient machines. The
organizers provided free break
fast and lunch to all the partici
pants.
Victoria and Cynthia, fourth
graders from Horace Cureton El
ementary School, attended the
Solar Car and Oobleck work

shops. In the solar car workshop,
they learned about how solar en
ergy is converted into electrical
energy to power the car's motor.
Oobleck was a hands-on experi
mentation with unusual fluids to
understand what makes different
substances have different proper
ties.
"We have enjoyed them equal
ly and had lots of fun," the two

said.
One of the most popular
workshops was Chemistry Prof.
Jonathan Pollster's "Chemistry
Magic Show." Touster froze flow
ers in liquid nitrogen to show the
effects of low temperature on or
ganic compounds. He also per
formed separations using iron

fillings and magnets to demon
strate magnetism, and imploded
soda cans to explain atmospheric
pressure.
Sophomore Smita Das helped
produce slime with chemical
compounds.
"All kids are wearing goggles.
There is always the potential of an
experiment failing but nothing
has gone wrong yet," Das said.

Parents as well as children were
active members of the audience.
"I feel this is very informative
to the kids. 1 especially enjoyed
[Computer Science Prof. Patrick
Young's workshop on] making
Web pages. I feel it is very impor
tant for the kids to be more aware
of science," said Geena Castro, a
mother of three boys.
"We are very glad parents have
come out with their children be
cause family is very important in
education. Providing support for
these kids at school and at home is
key," said junior Kathryn Yu, the

head of the volunteer committee.
Besides members of the.soci
ety and parents, volunteers in
cluded current Stanford stu
dents, alumni, and high school
students. Stafford added that I he
wide variety of volunteers was
different from past years.
"This year we really brought
the community together, in con
sonance with [University Presi
dent John] Hennessy's goal to in
tegrate Stanford more with the
community," she said.
"1 am really glad to be doing
community outreach. It is really

great to have the opportunity to
introduce [these kids] to the excit
ing work of science," said senior
David Lin.
Junior Emily Ma described Ex
ploring New Worlds as "a huge
event to put on. [The two coordi
nators! Roxann and Kristen, were
instrumental and put endless
hours of hard work."
Ma also said the greatest chal
lenge this year was funding due to
the poor economy. The society is
currently seeking an endowment
to ensure funding for the event in
future years.
