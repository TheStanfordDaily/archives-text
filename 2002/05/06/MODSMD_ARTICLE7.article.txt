relations in the first Oksenberg Lecture, spon

ic Studies.
The Oksenberg Lecture was established to

berg. a senior fellow at the Asia /Pacific Re
search Center at the Institute for International
Studies. Oksenberg was an expert on China,

who died in 2001. The lecture will be given

ment with Asia.

the lectures.
"We are pleased and honored that Carter
would accept our invitation," said Shorenstein
Forum Director Russell Hancock. "In Carter,
you have a figure who saw military duty in the
Chinese theater during World War 11, who
later carried forward a historic and transforma
tive diplomatic decision with the [People's Re
public of China], who since that time has been
an outspoken presence in China, even as re
cently as last year.
"He has a great deal to say on this subject

and a unique perspective from which to say it."
I lancock said.
Carter's speech will include his reflections
on his 1978 dec ision to normalize relations with
China as well as a discussion of the current state
of affairs between the United States and China.
"[Oksenberg] was one of the most important
forces shaping "American attitudes toward
China and was consistently outspoken about
the need for the United States to be more
thoughtful and informed in its engagement of
Asia," said Asia / Pacific Research Center Direc
tor Andrew Walder. "The Oksenberg Lectures
are a fitting way to honor his legacy, and we're
delighted that Carter will be kit king them off."
Oksenberg was the China expert on the Na
tional Security Council from 1977 to 1980, dur-
ing Carter's term as president.
During that time, he played an im
portant role in establishing full
diplomatic relations between Bei

jingand Washington.
Carter's speech, which is free
