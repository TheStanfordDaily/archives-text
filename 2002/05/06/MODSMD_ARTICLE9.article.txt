Famous bar reopens
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —The landmark Savoy-
I ivoli bar in North Beach reopened Thursday, marking
the end of a three-month battle that pitted neighbors
against local businesses and bar hoppers.
1 he nearly century-old Savoy- l ivoli, which was home
to the 1970s show "Beach Blanket Babylon," was closed
after the owner's application for an updated liquor li
cense was bogged down by neighbor complaints of rowdy
crowds that spilled out onto the street after the bar closed.
During the closure, San Francisco Mayor Willie
Brown was lobbied by a dozen out-of-work waitresses and
bartenders, while Crant Ayenue merchants complained
it took business away from nearby stores.
In March, the neighbors settled for promises from
Savoy-Tivoli's owner to soundproof parts of the bar and
post security guards to remind patrons to be quiet on
their way out.

Holocaust memorial faces
shutdown
LOS ANCELKS (AP) — The nation's oldest memorial
honoring victims of the I lolocaust could shut down by the
end of the year.
I he operating budget of the Los Angeles Museum of
the Holocaust has been cut in hall and volunteers and
part-time employees who run it have been told it could be
closed if new financing isn't found.
The museum was established in 1961 by Holocaust
survivors as the Martyrs Memorial Museum.
Its artifacts, photographs and exhibits trace the plight
of Jews who were seized and persecuted by Nazis during
the war.
But since 1993, the modest museum has been over
shadowed by the bigger and wealthier Museum of Toler
ance, run by the Simon Wiesenthal Center.
While the well-promoted museum offers interactive
and electronic exhibits and charges admission, the Muse
um of the Holocaust is free and relies on traditional glass
case displays, photographic blowups and models.
The Museum of the Holocaust has been kept afloat by
the Los Angeles Jewish Federation, which is facing its own
financial problems as it begins an emergency $10 million
fund-raising campaign to help Israel.
The museum's operating budget was cut from
$120,000 last year to $60,000. In contrast, it was allocat
ed $189,000 in 1999-2000, according to its operators.

UC-Davis sends out
incorrect admission letters
More than 100 University of California at Davis appli
cants received letters of acceptance recently, but their ela
tion was deflated within days, when campus officials real
ized they had sent the letters to people who had actually
been denied admission.
The university immediately fired off e-mail messages
informing the students about the terrible mix-up and
then followed with letters "apologizing profusely," said
Gary Tudor, director of undergraduate admissions.
The university didn't even know about the snafu
until one prospective student called to say that he had
received the acceptance letter, even though the admis
sions website indicated that he had been turned down.
Davis officials soon realized that the names of 105 re
jected international students had been mixed in with
accepted ones.
Matthew Hulce, a senior at the Singapore American
School, had planned to take the university up on its
offer — until he read his e-fnail.
"I was disappointed," said Hulce, who had hoped to
move back to his native California.
