San Francisco installs new,
high-tech parking meters
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — City officials are trading in
the mechanical parking meters that line San Francisco
streets lor high-tech machines that will be less susceptible to
theft and tampering.
Within two years, officials hope to install about 25,000
new meters. The meters will cost the city more than $35 mil
lion, which will be paid to a private contractor over the next
five years to supply, install and program the electronic me
ters. Another $2 million will be needed for other costs.
Officials say the project should pay for itself _ saving mil
lions of dollars in lost revenue that results from broken me
ters and theft. The new meters will have electronic locks
with key codes that are constantly changing, making it diffi
cult for bandits to break in.
City Controller Ed I farrington said revenue could jump
by 47 percent, from the current $ 12.6 million a year to more
than $18 million. Parking and traffic officials say the in
crease could be even greater.
The new meters will accept different denomination
coins, which should please residents, tourists and com
muters who are frustrated by the old quarter-only system.
Eventually, the meters will take an ATM-style Translink
card, now being tested on Muni, AC Transit and Bay Area
Rapid Transit.

Informant cleans up his life
with reward money
FREMONT, Calif. (AP) — A 39-year-old drifter, who
was a key witness in the trial that sent Fremont bomber Rod
ney Blach to prison,said he is using his money to sober up
and get off the streets.
The homeless man, who asked that his name not be used,
helped convict Blach, a former Chicago police evidence
technician, last year for planting fire and pipe bombs at the
homes of the city's police chief and a city council member.
Blach was sentenced to 37 years to life in prison after he
was convicted on 11 felony counts of arson, attempted mur
der and possessing explosives. No one was injured in the
blasts that hit Fremont four years ago.
The drifter told jurors he was hired by Blach to rent a
storage locker in San Jose where Blach stored bomb-mak
ing books, chemicals and detailed notes about the attacks.
