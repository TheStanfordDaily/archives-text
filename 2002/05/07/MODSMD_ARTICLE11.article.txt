1991
On May 7, 1991, The Daily printed an arti
cle about a speech by Venezuelan President
Carlos Andres Perez.
"Addressing his country's modernization ef
forts, Venezuelan President Carlos Andres
Perez last night stressed the important influ
ence industrialized countries have on the eco
nomic progress on Venezuela and the rest of
Latin America.
"Addressing an overflow crowd at Bishop
Auditorium, Perez said his government's eco
nomic reforms will not succeed unless devel
oped countries, particularly the United States,
drop trade barriers.
"Venezuelan economic programs imple
mented in the last two years include the less
ening of protectionist policies 'which have im
peded economic competition and efficiency'
and a decreasing dependence on oil exports,
which make the economy vulnerable to fluc
tuating world prices, he said.
"Perez said these programs have improved
the economy in various ways, including a 50
percent decrease in inflation, the highest gross
domestic product growth rate in Latin Amer
ica and increases in productive potential and
investment opportunities. 'Promises have
started to become reality,' he said.
"These internal changes are not enough to
save the economy, however, he said.
Venezuela's efforts to substitute oil revenues
with those of its other main industries - steel,
iron, aluminum and petrochemical products -
are being thwarted by the lack of openness of
the U.S. economy, Perez said.
"Thiscondition reflects poorly on the Unit
ed States as 'a leader in freecommerce' and
also makes American consumers face higher
prices for those products, he added.
"'We do not want aid, we want commerce.
We do not need privileges, we need just prices.'
"Perez said the lack of international coop
eration in trade matters is a problem faced not
only by Venezuela but also by the rest of Latin
America. He made a plea for industrialized
countries to act upon shared interests, subor
dinating national interests if necessary.
Bottom Line: It seems that Monday, May 6 is presi
dential visiting day at Stanford.
