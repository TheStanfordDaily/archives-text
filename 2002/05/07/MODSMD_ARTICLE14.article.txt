# Federal Reserve votes to hold rates steady
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — With unemploy
ment at its highest level in nearly eight years,
the Federal Reserve will hold interest rates
steady this week and won't start to raise rates
until joblessness begins to fall, economists lore
cast yesterday.
On the eve of today's regular meeting of
Fed officials to review interest rates, analysts
were in widespread agreement that the central
bank will not see this as the right time to start
boosting interest rates as a pre-emptive strike
against inflation.
Last week, the government reported that
the unemployment rate climbed to 6 percent
in April, the highest level since August 1994.
That report was the most dramatic of a
number of indicators showing that the recov
ery from last year's recession, after surging out
of the starting gate in the January-March peri
od this year, was slowing down.
The lackluster data on economic activity,
coupled with continued weak earnings reports
from corporate America, has battered Wall
Street in recent weeks. The Dow Jones indus
trial average lost another 198.59 points yester
day to close at 9,808.04, its lowest close since

Feb. 19.
"We are in the midst so far of a jobless re
covery and a profitless recovery. That is a dou
ble-whammy on financial markets and the Fed
doesn't want to make it a triple-whammy by
raising interest rates," s;iitl Sung Won Sohn,
chief economist ;it Wells Fargo in Minneapolis.
l he central bank's Federal Open Market
Committee, which meets eight times a year to
sel interest rate policies, has not changed rates
since last December, when it capped a yearlong
easing drive by cutting its target lor the feder
al funds rate, the interest that banks charge
each other, to a 40-year low of 1.75 percent.
Banks' prime lending rate, which follows
changes in the funds rate, is now 4.75 percent,
meaning that consumers and businesses are
enjoying the lowest short-term borrowing costs
since 1965.
At its last meeting on March 19, the FOMC
left rales unchanged but raised expectations of
future rate increases by dropping the language
it had been using for more than a year that the
greatest danger facing the economy was weak
growth.
That wording change sparked concerns

that with increasing signs of an economic
rebound, the central bank was getting
ready to start raising interest rates to make
sure the stronger growth did not spark in
flation pressures.
With the spate of weaker-than-expected
economic reports, topped off by the sharp rise
in unemployment, expectations on when the
Fed will begin raising rales have now retreated
to August or possibly even later.
I he expectation is that the unemployment
rate will peak at around 0.5 percent, probably
in June or July of this year. While that is up
considerably from the 3.9 percent jobless low
point during the 10-year, record-breaking ex
pansion, it is still well below the 7.8 percent job
less rate hit during the 1990-91 recession.
When the Fed does start raising rates,
most analysts are not looking for the dramat
ic half-point changes the Fed was making last
year, but rather more deliberative quarter
point moves.
"The Fed doesn't want to slam on the
brakes. I hey just want to take their foot off the
accelerator," said David Wyss, chief economist
at Standard & Poor's Co. in New York.
