## The 						Stanford Daily ASSU election mishaps cause lack of confidence 
### 
Published Since 1891

Although the ASSU election ran much
more smoothly this year than in pre
vious years, the fact that three stu
dent organizations — SCBN, Stan
ford Mock Trial, and ASSU Course Guide —
were left off the ballot for several hours at a
time and that there were security problems
with the voting Web site demonstrate reasons
why some students have lost faith in the ASSU
election process and perhaps the ASSU itself.
We recognize that no election — student,
local, or nation-wide — is without its flaws.
Indeed, the ASSU Elections Commission did
a good job of eliminating them this year. But
the problems that did exist with the ASSU

election this year were entirely preventable.
When steps can be taken to end problems
and ensure the integrity of any election pro
cess, action should be taken swiftly.
While it is doubtful that the one to four
hours a student group was left off the ballots
out of a 48-hour voting period could change
the fact that SCBN failed to earn enough
votes fora quorum and Mock Trial failed to
earn a majority, the statistical probability that
these groups would lose anyway does not ex
cuse the fact that they were left off the ballot.
Placing groups in such a precarious posi
tion will cast doubts — validated or not —
over election results.

Student concerns about the election process
heightened when it became clear that the voting
tallies were improperly accessed by ASSU offi
cial Henry Towsner. Although the voting out
comes were not changed, the compromised se
curity of the ASSU election handbook and the
entire ASSU Web site does not foster confidence
in the election system. Although Towsner had
no intention to change the results, other intrud
ers may have had more sinister motives.
It is the ASSU's responsibility to ensure
that such mishaps do not occur in the future.
Since many of the ASSU undergraduate
senators change every year, a specific proto
col should be established to deal with such

technological and logistical problems pre
sented by the election.
Increased communication between the
ASSU technical group — which designs the
election site — and the ASSU Elections Com
mission needs to happen in order to prevent
such problems from arising again.
We recognize that although these problems
occurred, there has been vast improvement in
the overall election process as compared with
ASSU elections of previous years. The new
ASSU should address these election issues im
mediately in order to redress these problems
before the lessons that can be learned from
this year's election are forgotten.
