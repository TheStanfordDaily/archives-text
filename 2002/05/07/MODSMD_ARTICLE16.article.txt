# SHOOTING FROM THE HIP
## The
						myth of athlete life 
### 
Oh, the poor, misunderstood
Stanford athlete. Is there any
creature on God's green earth
that's more stereotyped, pi
geonholed, scorned and envied? There
are dozens of misperceptions about
Stanford athletes floating around out
there. One of the most prevalent, of
course, deals with our supposed perks.
Simply put, many students have this
nagging sense that athletes get it better
than everyone else.
As a humble representative of the Stan
ford athletes, I'd like to set the record
straight . Hie truth is not quite what it seems.

Let's start small: The
food. At the beginning
of Winter Quarter, sev
eral students wrote ag
grieved letters about the
"Training fable" in
Stern Dining. This is
simply a small section of
the buffet counter re
served for athletes, with

different menu options than what is
served in the rest of the dining hall.
When it was introduced, this setup did
not sit well with many members of the stu
dent body. They saw it as a revival of class
based distinctions, better suited for 17th
century France then today's more enlight
ened times. How dare these blue-blooded
athletes feast on fine delicacies, while the
poor huddled masses have to setde for
common food? Sacrilege! Horrible elitism!
Whoa there. In my opinion, the Train
ing Table food is slightly better than the
general dining hall options. Slightly. On a
really good day, it might approach the
quality of the Toyon Eating Clubs. So
we're hardly talking about Wolfgang Puck
here. I've never had so sift through my
Training fable entree looking for truffles
and Beluga caviar.
For my money, the one place where ath
letes really do dine better than everyone else
is in the Sports Cafe in the Arrillaga Family
Sports (Center. It's ( heap and fantastic qual
ity. And although frequented almost entire
ly by athletes and coaches, it's open to the
general public. So for anyone who's envious
of the Training lable, feel free to bike down
to Arrillaga and sample the best that Stan
ford athletes can get.
Since we're talking about Arrillaga, lets
briefly touch on the athletic training room
there. I've heard many of my friends
speak of the training room as if it were an
ultra-luxurious European health spa.
They talk about the massages, the warm
whirlpools and the trainers catering to
your every ache and pain.
Much of this is technically correct, but
substantively laughable. For example, you
can indeed get massages at the training
room. Occasionally these massages are
even pleasant. But more often, the mas
sage techniques appear to have been
taken 112 rom the Joseph Mengele School of
Physical Therapy.
When my hamstring starts acting up,
l ara, our team trainer, usually gives me
what is euphemistically called "deep tis
sue massage." This is like calling a wreck
ing ball a "brick and mortar manipula

tor." Deep tissue massage consists of
Tara taking her elbow, setting it against
my thigh, and leaning all her weight on
it as she slowly runs it down my leg. The
technique is great for breaking up scar
tissue and allowing you to run without
pain. But only a masochist would ever
call it enjoyable.
As for the whirlpools, there are actu
ally four of them. One of them is kept
around 100 degrees, perfect Jacuzzi
temperature. This one is hardly ever
used. The other three whirlpools are
positively Arctic. They are used on a reg
ular basis. Every day you see athletes
trudge in from practice and lower them
selves, shivering, into the literally icy wa
ters. Whenever I'm in the whirlpool
room, I half expect to see Leonardo Di-
Caprio and Kate Winslett slowly sinking
in the tub next to me.
Which brings me to my final point.
It's become almost an article of faith that,
on and off the field, athletes score more
often than any other group. Male ath
letes get all the girls; female athletes get
all the guys.
I have no idea whether, statistically,
this is true. There are a couple reasons
why it might be. Athletes tend to have re
ally nice bodies, because let's face it —
you have to seriously abuse yourself not
to have a nice body when you're training
20 hours a week. Then there are all sorts
of psychological theories, like increased
self-confidence stemming from physical
fitness. However, there are also a lot of
unrecognized difficulties that being an
athlete poses in terms of dealing with the
opposite sex.
For example, not too long ago I had
9:00 section for one class, and there was
a stunningly beautiful girl in the same
section. This was the kind of girl where,
when you look at her, you can actually
hear the saxophone music wailing in the
background. Like any red-blooded
male, my natural inclination would have
been to sit near her, and try to strike up
a conversation before or after class.
Unfortunately, this particular 9:00 sec
tion occurred right after 7:45 team
weightlifting sessions. So I'd invariably slink
into class at 9:05, sweaty and bedraggled,
looking and smelling like something the cat
dragged in.
Needless to say, this is not the best way
to present oneself when trying to talk to
girls, or anyone else for that matter. I'd
usually end up picking a seat way off to the
side, so as not to make section too un
pleasant for anyone else.
Don't get me wrong — I love being an
athlete. But I think I can speak for all Stan
ford athletes in saying that we don't train
and compete for the food, the massages,
the hot tubs or the romantic and / or car
nal opportunities. We do it for the love of
the game, the sheer joy of physical activity
and hard-fought competition. After all,
that is what athletics is really all about.
