Freshman offended by 'a group hying to
belittle the events of the Holocaust 7
Today, for the first time in the past
nine years, I have been offended by a
group trying to belittle the events of the
Holocaust and distribute propaganda
bordering on anti-Semitism. I came to
the United States from Prague where I
was never surprised to hear "Go back to
Auschwitz!" when people saw me with a
yarmulke on the streets. Most of the peo
ple in the Czech Republic were largely
uneducated about the Holocaust, and
few were really aware of the terrifying
genocide that occurred or of the number
6 million.
At Stanford, I expected that most stu
dents would be respectful and under
standing of the unimaginable crimes that
were inflicted upon the Jews of Europe
during the Holocaust.
Yesterday, in White Plaza, I found out
that my expectations weren't correct. A
group of students calling themselves
"The New Federalists" set up a table con
taining flyers with propaganda. The stu
dents would attempt to engage passers
by, handing out leafleted and giving a
brief prepared speech. I was shocked
when the gentleman who approached
me began explaining that suicide
bombers in Jenin were equivalent to the
resistance that the Jews put up in the
Warsaw Ghetto and that Israel was using
the tactics of the Nazis who crushed it.
I have heard allegations of anti-Zionist
propaganda being anti-Semitic before,
but I always dismissed them as paranoid. I
have gone to anti-Israel rallies as the pro-
Israel voice and have always gotten along
with the opposing side. I am neither afraid
of nor offended by pro-Palestinian groups
and have good friends who participate in
them. What I encountered today, howev
er, was a belittlement of the Holocaust
which I cannot overlook.
During the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising,
it was obvious to most Jews that the Nii/is
had a clear plan of extermination in
mind for them. They understood that
the 56,000 Jews in the ghetto would be
murdered indiscriminately whether
young or old, man or woman, adult or
child. The youths of the ghetto dec ided
that they will not die passively by walking
to their slaughters but that they would
resist. The resistance was futile from the
beginning yet it offered the Ghetto a
spark of hope before its demise.
It is irrelevant to discuss the political
views that one might have on the Middle
East conflict to understand that Israel's
practices are no way similar to the mur
derous regime of the Nazis. President
George W. Bush proclaimed Ariel Sharon
to be a man of peace, and there have been
numerous confirmations of the fact that a
massacre did not occur. I am even more

appalled and disgusted by the group's
comparison of the resistance in t he Ghet
to to Palestinian suicide bombings.
This comparison is incorrect. The
Jewish resistance in the ghetto never
harmed a civilian before or after the Nazi
forces went in to suppress it. Suicide
bombing attacks have killed people at
Bar Mitzvah celebrations, Passover
Seders, discos, pizza shops and cafes.
How can there be a comparison between
fighting Nazi soldiers and murdering
kids at a disco? The Jews in the ghetto
were never negotiated with; they were
not fighting for land, religion, or any
thing besides their lives.
The political opinions in question are
secondary to the offensive nature of the
group,s materials. I am shocked that I
had to be exposed to such Holocaust be
littlement on the Stanford campus.
There is a space for argument against Is
rael,s policies just like there is space for
argument against America's policies.
The use of offensive propaganda, how
ever, is quite unnecessary.

Hindu Student Council creates inaccurate
portrayal with Awareness Week
Some of us have been increasingly
concerned over the growing emphases
on a particular representation of Hin
duism at Stanford. The Stanford Daily's
article (5/6/02) on the Hindu Student
Council's organization of "Hinduism
Awareness Week" quoted co-ordinator,
Manik Chhabra, as saying, "We felt that
it was important to educate the Stanford

community about Hinduism."
I would like to question the means of this
education. For example, what do the coor
dinators hope to achieve by characterizing
"Indian Classical Music" as Hindu?
The decision to have a lecture on Hin
dus as minorities in the world detracts
from the violence effected by the majori
tarian Hindu community in Gujrat,
India. This year, 56,000 people were
rendered homeless and 2,000 were
killed under the aegis of Hindu persecu
tion. Given the recent events in Gujrat
this year, the logic behind the timeliness
of such a focus on the Hindu diaspora in
the world as a "minority" obscures their
majority-rule terror in India.
Undeniably, it is the right of students
to create spaces which address their con
cerns â€” such as an affinity with particu
lar brands of Hindu identity. However,
the Hindu Student Council should not
claim to, in any way, represent the inter
ests of Hindus at large.
Finally, their irresponsibility in propa
gating a distorted awareness of "Hindu"
tradition is a grievous offense in our cur
rently explosive political climate.

Stanford softball behaved admirably
It was a lovely Sunday in Tucson at
the Rita Hellenbrand Memorial Stadium
as the Stanford Cardinal came to bat in
the bottom of the 7th inning.
Jenny Finch, the premier hurler for the
Arizona Wildcats was beginning to tire.
One Cardinal managed a Texas Lea
guer that dropped into left center. Sev
eral ground balls and two outs later, Jes
sica Mendoza had scampered over to
third base.
Then a Cardinal banged one to Finch
who in turn threw the ball into the dirt,
skipping it past the Wildcat catcher,
Cassie Brangham.
Meanwhile, Mendoza had scooted
home to put one on the board for Stanford.
Stanford lost by a score of 6-1. But if
effort means anything, then the girls
from Palo Alto deserve an A. They stayed
the course and continued to play, giving
it their best, unto the final out.
But the real highlight of the afternoon
was when both teams stood opposite
each other in a "V" for the award cere
mony afterward.
l"he Cardinal had lost, but the girls
showed real sportsmanship and courtesy
in respecting the honors given to the
hometown team.

East conflict to understand that Israel's
practices are no way similar to the mur

appalled and disgusted by the group's

This comparison is incorrect. The
Jewish resistance in the ghetto never
harmed a civilian before or after the Nazi
forces went in to suppress it. Suicide
bombing attacks have killed people at
Bar Mitzvah celebrations, Passover
Seders, discos, pizza shops and cafes.
How can there be a comparison between

There is a space for argument against Is

The use of offensive propaganda, how
ever, is quite unnecessary.

Hindu Student Council creates inaccurate
portrayal with Awareness Week
Some of us have been increasingly
concerned over the growing emphases
on a particular representation of Hin
duism at Stanford. The Stanford Daily's
article (5/6/02) on the Hindu Student
Council's organization of "Hinduism
Awareness Week" quoted co-ordinator,
Manik Chhabra, as saying, "We felt that
it was important to educate the Stanford

community about Hinduism."
I would like to question the means of this
education. For example, what do the coor
dinators hope to achieve by characterizing
"Indian Classical Music" as Hindu?
The decision to have a lecture on Hin
dus as minorities in the world detracts
from the violence effected by the majori
tarian Hindu community in Gujrat,
India. This year, 56,000 people were
rendered homeless and 2,000 were
killed under the aegis of Hindu persecu
tion. Given the recent events in Gujrat
this year, the logic behind the timeliness
of such a focus on the Hindu diaspora in
the world as a "minority" obscures their
majority-rule terror in India.
Undeniably, it is the right of students
to create spaces which address their con
cerns â€” such as an affinity with particu
lar brands of Hindu identity. However,
the Hindu Student Council should not
claim to, in any way, represent the inter
ests of Hindus at large.
Finally, their irresponsibility in propa
gating a distorted awareness of "Hindu"
tradition is a grievous offense in our cur
rently explosive political climate.

Stanford softball behaved admirably
It was a lovely Sunday in Tucson at
the Rita Hellenbrand Memorial Stadium
as the Stanford Cardinal came to bat in
the bottom of the 7th inning.
Jenny Finch, the premier hurler for the
Arizona Wildcats was beginning to tire.
One Cardinal managed a Texas Lea
guer that dropped into left center. Sev
eral ground balls and two outs later, Jes

third base.
Then a Cardinal banged one to Finch
who in turn threw the ball into the dirt,
skipping it past the Wildcat catcher,
Cassie Brangham.
Meanwhile, Mendoza had scooted
home to put one on the board for Stanford.
Stanford lost by a score of 6-1. But if
effort means anything, then the girls
from Palo Alto deserve an A. They stayed
the course and continued to play, giving
it their best, unto the final out.
But the real highlight of the afternoon
was when both teams stood opposite
each other in a "V" for the award cere

l"he Cardinal had lost, but the girls
showed real sportsmanship and courtesy

Freshman offended by 'a group hying to
belittle the events of the Holocaust 7
Today, for the first time in the past
nine years, I have been offended by a
group trying to belittle the events of the
Holocaust and distribute propaganda
bordering on anti-Semitism. I came to
the United States from Prague where I
was never surprised to hear "Go back to
Auschwitz!" when people saw me with a
yarmulke on the streets. Most of the peo
ple in the Czech Republic were largely
uneducated about the Holocaust, and
few were really aware of the terrifying
genocide that occurred or of the number
6 million.
At Stanford, I expected that most stu
dents would be respectful and under
standing of the unimaginable crimes that
were inflicted upon the Jews of Europe
during the Holocaust.
Yesterday, in White Plaza, I found out
that my expectations weren't correct. A
group of students calling themselves
"The New Federalists" set up a table con
taining flyers with propaganda. The stu
dents would attempt to engage passers
by, handing out leafleted and giving a
brief prepared speech. I was shocked
when the gentleman who approached
me began explaining that suicide
bombers in Jenin were equivalent to the
resistance that the Jews put up in the
Warsaw Ghetto and that Israel was using
the tactics of the Nazis who crushed it.
I have heard allegations of anti-Zionist
propaganda being anti-Semitic before,
but I always dismissed them as paranoid. I
have gone to anti-Israel rallies as the pro-
Israel voice and have always gotten along
with the opposing side. I am neither afraid
of nor offended by pro-Palestinian groups
and have good friends who participate in
them. What I encountered today, howev
er, was a belittlement of the Holocaust
which I cannot overlook.
During the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising,
it was obvious to most Jews that the Nii/is
had a clear plan of extermination in
mind for them. They understood that
the 56,000 Jews in the ghetto would be
murdered indiscriminately whether
young or old, man or woman, adult or
child. The youths of the ghetto dec ided
that they will not die passively by walking
to their slaughters but that they would
resist. The resistance was futile from the
beginning yet it offered the Ghetto a
spark of hope before its demise.
It is irrelevant to discuss the political
views that one might have on the Middle
East conflict to understand that Israel's
practices are no way similar to the mur
derous regime of the Nazis. President
George W. Bush proclaimed Ariel Sharon
