# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## The 						state of the Stanford community 
### MARC WAIS DEAN OF STUDENTS 
As Dean of Students and a Resident Fel
low in Junipero, an all-frosh house, I am
able to immerse myself among the best
and brightest students, faculty, and stall in
this very special place called Stanford Uni
versity. Within this context, I have been
known to rave endlessly about the special
qualities of academic and student life here
on the Farm. 1 lowever, there are other as
pects of campus lite that 1 become in
volved with that reveal an insensitive, per
haps uneducated, and sometimes just
plain mean-spirited side of some members
of the Stanford community.
In the past few years my office has pub
lished an annual report on the state of the
Stanford community regarding acts of intol
erance. l he Acts of Intolerance Protocol,
adopted as a University policy last October,
defines such an act as "conduct that ad
versely and unfairly targets an individual 01
group on the basis of sex, race, color, dis
ability, religion, sexual orientation, and/or
national or ethnic origin."
While Stanford for the most part is a safe
and tolerant campus, it is not insulated
112 rom acts of intolerance, which occasional
ly may rise to the level of a hate crime. Since
Sept. 1, 2001, 31 acts of intolerance have
been reported to my office. Last year we re
ceived a total of 46 reports. Many of these
involve offensive and hurtful e-mails —
(he majority of which originate from non-
Stanford accounts; others involve threat
ening and harassing correspondence or
behavior; others involve racist and offen
sive graffiti in outdoor campus spaces and
inside student residences.
Acts of intolerance are not a new phe
nomenon at Stanford. Some acts during
the past 10 years have received
widespread media attention. For exam
ple, a series of racist graffiti directed
against primarily Asian Americans in
March and April of 2001; 1999 Memorial
Day racist e-mail; homophobic graffiti in
the Bollards Eating Club in 1997; racist
graffiti in the Asian American Activities
Center in 1996; and vandalism of the
Segal Gay Liberation statue in 1995.
Most acts of intolerance, however, tend
to take place far removed from the media
spotlight, and it is for this reason I believe
the University community can benefit from
my periodically reporting on these acts, as
well as my sharing with you the progress we
continue to make to prevent and respond to
these unacceptable incidents.
As mentioned above, last October Uni
versity President John Hennessy approved

"An Acts of Intolerance Protocol For Facul
ty, Stall, and Students." This Protocol out
lines the procedures and support mecha
nisms for students, faculty, and stall follow
ing an act of intolerance 011 campus.
This Protocol, a follow up to the Student
Affairs Acts of Intolerance Protocol imple
mented in 1998, provides guidelines fora
coordinated response to acts of intolerance;
it also emphasizes Stanford's commitment
to ongoing education of its faculty, staff, and
students to prevent these ac ts.
We think it is important for the commu
nity to know that the University does in fact
react quickly and decisively on all reported
acts of intolerance, even though that reac
tion is not always visible or publicized. A va
riety of agencies on campus — residence
deans, Cowell Student I lealth Center, The
Dean of Students Office, Hie Office of Reli
gious Life, community center directors,
Stanford Police, and relevant others — mo
bilize quickly to provide support and com
fort to the injured individual or group; con
duct an investigation into the facts of the re
ported incident; and, if possible, to hold the
responsible individuals accountable for
their actions.
These efforts are supported and im
proved through the Dean of Students Acts
of Intolerance Advisor)' Group, a group of
about 40 students, stall, and faculty that
meets monthly.
This year, the advisory group has been
very active. Earlier in the year it planned,
developed and implemented "University
Voices," a program in which students, facul
ty, and staff, including Hennessy, reflected
on the meaning of the tragic events of Sept.
11. We have been told that those who par
ticipated or attended found it to be power
fully comforting.
Currently, the group is working to
develop a Web site focusing 011 "Com
munity, Diversity, and Tolerance,"
which it hopes to launch next fall. Ten
tatively, the Web site has six features:
Educational Resources, Archive of Inci
dents, Reporting an Incident, Survey
and Feedback, National News and Up
dates, and Campus Programs.
Finally, I want to use this guest column
to inform the community of a new initia
tive the group wants to launch, designed
to address the significant increase in the
number of reported acts of intolerance as
sociated with the Palestinian/Israeli con
flict. Hoping to be of service to the campus
community in some tangible way to ad
dress the worrisome escalation of tension
regarding this volatile situation, the advi
sory group, at its April 23 meeting, rallied
to the idea of publicizing a list of volun

teers willing to act as resources to mediate
conflicts or facilitate discussions within any
campus setting that involve difficult, com
plex, emotional subjects. Some attending
members signed up on the spot; other
community members have expressed an
interest, as well.
Before acting as a mediator or facilita
tor, each volunteer will participate in a 2-
hour to 3-hour training session to learn
about effective listening and mediation
skills. We hope that by providing the cam
pus community with a list of caring and
concerned individuals, that if an incident
occurs, those affected will feel encouraged
to seek advice from a volunteer about an
appropriate response or for advice on
avoiding a situational escalation.
The primary purpose of this volunteer
initiative, however, is to be pro-active, not so
much re-active, to help maintain a campus
climate that is respectful of all points of view
and intellectual discourse, and an environ
ment where faculty, staff, and students feel
comfortable and safe to talk about difficult,
complex, and emotional subjects.
We do not expect this single initiative to
completely ameliorate the current tense sit
uation or that it will ensure that no future
disturbing incident will happen, but we do
think and hope that it is a helpful step in the
right direction.
1 112 anyone would like to take advantage of
this new resource, please contact Asst. Dean
of Students Tommy Woon, or me, at 723-
2733, or at mwais@stanford.edu or
tlw@stanford.edu.
As we strive to respond to and prevent
acts of intolerance on campus we are guid
ed by the values, principles, and beliefs of
this institution. In an Amendment to the
Founding Grant, Jane Stanford articulated
that her and her husband's "moving spirit"
for founding the University was their "love
of humanity and a desire to render the
greatest possible service to mankind." She
went on to add "The University was ac
cordingly designed for the betterment of
mankind morally, spiritually, intellectually,
physically, and materially."
In essence, the Stanfords wanted to em
power students to make the world a better
place in which to live. Within this context,
1 would ask each member of the Stanford
community to do his or her part in treat
ing others with respect, sensitivity, and
thoughtfulness. Only when each of us in
dividually pays allegiance to the Universi
ty's values, principles of good citizenship,
and expressions of civility, and receives re
spect in return will we be able to make a
positive difference to life in this wonderful
place called Stanford.
