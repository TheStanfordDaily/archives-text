# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Education goes corporate 
### PAUL T. HILL HOOVER INSTITUTION 
We know a few things about CEOs.
Their job is to make their organizations
look good, however troubled and ineffec
tive they might be. They do not feel obli
gated to divulge troubling information
that might affect public confidence, cause
valuable employees to leave, or make it
difficult to recruit in the future.
Education CEOs are no exception. I
have learned, in the course of research on
the leadership problems of big-city school
districts, that superintendents also need to
downplay problems. They put a bright
face on negative circumstances out of fear
that creating a crisis may lower public con
fidence or discourage potential successors.
Superintendents are always ready to
tell about "neat things" their districts are
doing to turn around troubled schools,
develop the skills of deficient teachers,
and reduce the achievement gap between
poor and middle-class children.
But when pressed they tell a different
story. When asked whether the "neat
things" are likely to make a big differ
ence, many say no. Professional develop
ment cannot turn schools around when
virtually the entire teaching staff leaves at
the end of the year. Schools serving the
poorest children need longer school days
and school years than other schools. Pri
mary schools serving the poorest neigh
borhoods need simpler, more literacy-fo
cused curricula than other schools. Trou
bled schools cannot improve if schools in
the "nicer" neighborhoods always get a
disproportionate share of the respected
and experienced teachers.
Superintendents also know that
pressing for fundamental changes in
public schools might cost them their
jobs. One administrator stated that "you
can start something that might make a
difference but you would never survive
long enough to see it work out."
Another said that superintendents "are

constantly choosing between initiatives
that might work but would get you fired
and initiatives that are too weak to do
much Inn might survive long enough to
make a little bit of difference."
Doing what is needed would require re
allocating money and personnel and look
ing outside the system for new ideas and
people. Money is a huge issue: in the words
of one superintendent, "You need to be
able to change how every dollar is spent."
But that might require funds from ex
isting programs and schools in upper-in
come neighborhoods. Influential neigh
borhoods have the programs and teachers
parents want, and they won't give them up
readily. Many superintendents also feel
whipsawed between teachers and their
unions. According to one administrator,
"We can gel union agreement for one
thing, or cooperation from individual
teachers for another, but we can rarely get
both the union and the teachers to agree
at the same time."
Superintendents have ideas about
how to solve the persistent problems of
public education. But like business
CEOs they are programmed to pretend
that all is well and that all problems will
shortly be conquered. Donors to public
education assume that the superinten
dent will tell them what is needed, which
is not a safe assumption. Like investors in
the stock market, policymakers and phi
lanthropists need to ask hard and impo
lite questions.
