U.S. cross country champion, Drossin
set a world record earlier this year
with a 14:54 in the women's 5,000 me

runners.
Despite stiff competition from inter
national and professional athletes, the
Stanford contingent stood out with
strong performances on the track and
high marks in field events.
Sophomore Jessica Pluth captured
first place in the hammer with a throw
of 196 feet, 2 inches. After tying the
school record last week with a toss of
192-8, Pluth took the record all for her
self with this week's throw.

second-place mark of 52-2.
After the strong international and
professional showing at Stanford, the
Cardinal dominated Cal at Saturday's
Big Meet at Berkeley.
With its easy 101-62 victory, the
Cardinal scored at least 100 points
against the Golden Bears for the sec
ond straight year. The 39-point victo

ry was Stanford's fourth-largest in 11 it*
meet's 23-year history.

13 of the 19 events and set two Big Meet
records.

the pole vault record with a height of
13-5 1/4. Laura Turner set a new meet
and school record with a first-place time
of 10:13.47 in the 3,000-meter steeple
chase.
With 1-2-3 finishes in the 200 meter,
1,500 meter and 5,000 meter races, the
Cardinal crushed Cal in a wide range of
events.
Stanford also got a boost from point
packing performances by freshman
Christine Moschella and senior Robyn
Woolfolk. Moschella garnered 15
points in the 200 meters and 400 me
ters, and ran anchor in the winning
1,600-meter relay team. Woolfolk
placed first in the 100-meter hurdles,
ran the second leg in the winning 400-
meter relay team and placed third in

Meet, the Stanford women are gear
ing up for this weekend's Modesto Re
lays, with the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships looming in the near
future.
