### DANIEL URBAN STAFF WRITER 
While Big Game lias become a source'of
amusement for (Cardinal fans, who casually

Cal last year, while the previous year had
seen a close victory for the Golden Bears.
In short, Cal lias a good track program
that lias given the Cardinal trouble for the
better part of the last century. The Cal men
lead the 108-year-old series (xS-45.
This past weekend, however, the Bears'
list of things they do almost as well as Stan
