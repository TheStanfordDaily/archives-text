### MAC LEVINE STAFF WRITER 
Four years ago, Chris O'Riordan stepped onto
Stanford's campus as a wide-eyed freshman, just look
ing to make the baseball team as a walk-on infielder.

He had taken a chance, spurning recruiting offers
from much less competitive schools like the University
of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth and Tulane in favor of
coming to Stanford, where he hoped just to get on the
roster of one of the nation's top teams.
Don't be mistaken ... he knew he was good
enough to play, but lie just wasn't sure if he was going
to get the chance to show everyone else his ability.
The 5-foot-9,165-pound freshman had just gradu
ated from a small high school in San Diego, lacking the
critical acclaim that almost all of the highly-touted
baseball recruits coming into Stanford already had in
their portfolios.

"Coming in as a freshman, I wasn't even consider
ing getting drafted or anything like that," O'Riordan
said. "1 just wanted to play college baseball. 1 thought
it would be fun. My perspective on things has changed
a little, I guess."
It's hard to imagine someone coming out of
nowhere to so abruptly make such a big impact on the
Cardinal's historic baseball program. But t hat's exact
ly what O'Riordan did, with a performance dramatic
enough to change the perspectives of a lot of people.
For the past three years, rarely has there been any
doubt who would be manning second base when head
coach Mark Marquess trotted to home plate with the
lineup card. O'Riordan has marked his territory bet
ter than any German Shepherd could ever dream of,
with a couple All-American seasons fending off any
would-be competition.
After a disheartening freshman campaign that saw
the true walk-on appear in only two contests without a
single plate appearance, O'Riordan burst onto the
scene during his sophomore year, taking over as the
team's starting second baseman during the preseason

and starting in all but one of the
team's final 47 games.
Long gone was the cautious,
wide-eyed freshman. In his place
was a determined ballplayer who
knew he was good enough to play,
and who was convinced that if he
wasn't going to get the playing time
at Stanford, he could — and would
— succeed elsewhere.
"Coming in, I was incredibly in
timidated with guys like John Gall,
who led the national team in hit
ting the summer before, Jason
Young and Justin Wayne, who
were incredible pitchers," said
O'Riordan. "But alter practicing
with everyone [during freshman
year], I realized that it was going to
work out, that I was going to be
able to compete with these guys
and play at the same level."
In this breakthrough year, ()'Ri
ordan led the team with a .366 bat
ting average to go along with 15
doubles, three homers and 34 RBI
en route to being named a Pacific
10 All-Conference Honorable
Mention choice.
As O'Riordan will be the lirst one
to admit, it didn't hurt batting be
hind the much-feared trio of out
fiedlers Gall, Joe Bon hard and Ed
mund Muth, who hit a combined
52 homers in that 2000 season.
In what was a perfect situation
for the first-time starter, O'Riordan

saw a steady diet of fastballs. I le
wasn't counted on for much offen
sive production and was allowed to
concentrate on defense while let
ting the big boys do the damage at
the plate.
But as times change, roles
change, and O'Riordan was about
to assume a much greater one.
When he and his fellow team
mates returned for last year's cam
paign, there was not a single senior
and only three returning starters iti
the lineup.
No longer could he sit back and
watch while quietly doing his job. It
was his time to become a leader.
And lead lie did, with a spectac
ular junior season in which he was
named a first-team All American,
first-team All-Pac-10 and Stanford's
most valuable player.
At the top of the lineup, O'Ri
ordan paced the Cardinal in al
most every offensive category,
showing a power stroke that be
lied his now-180-pound frame —
a 15-pound gain that he attributes
to a strict weightlifting regimen.
He led the team with 12 homers
and 08 RBI.
In only two years, O'Riordan
had gone from an ignored walk-on
who was just trying to make the
team to a bona fide star on a team
that was runner-up for the national
championship.
"Asa freshman, 1 just wanted to
figure out some way to get in the
lineup and contribute," said O'Ri
ordan. "But as the years went on, 1
started getting a different role,

started realizing that I could be a
leader on this team."
Almost surprised, he added, "It
just kind of happened."
Now in his senior season, which
lie entered as a preseason first-team
All-American, it's still happening.
O'Riordan is again putting up the
great numbers that Cardinal fans
have become accustomed to, hat
ting .346 with seven home runs and
37 RBI, while starting all 45 games
at second base.
With a .358 career batting aver
age, O'Riordan is on pace to finish
in the top live in that category in
program history.
In the summer between his
sophomore and junior seasons,
O'Riordan was playing summer
ball in Alaska, where he recounted a
conversation with a player who had
been his opponent in the Pac-10 the
previous year.
" This guy told me, 'You really
impressed me because when we
were going through the scouting
report, our coach was like,
"You've got Muth, Gall, Bor
chard and then there's this little
shit playing there who won't do
anything." But you got like six
hits against us that series.' "
Laughing, O'Riordan added, "I
guess I've always liked to prove
people wrong."
And with the College World Se
ries and Major League Baseball
looming in front of him with the
June amateur draft, you've got to
think that he's not done proving
the naysayers wrong.

at second base.
With a .358 career batting aver
age, O'Riordan is on pace to finish
in the top live in that category in
program history.
In the summer between his
sophomore and junior seasons,
O'Riordan was playing summer
ball in Alaska, where he recounted a
conversation with a player who had
been his opponent in the Pac-10 the
previous year.
" This guy told me, 'You really
impressed me because when we
were going through the scouting
report, our coach was like,
"You've got Muth, Gall, Bor
chard and then there's this little
shit playing there who won't do
anything." But you got like six
hits against us that series.' "
Laughing, O'Riordan added, "I
guess I've always liked to prove
people wrong."
And with the College World Se
ries and Major League Baseball
looming in front of him with the
June amateur draft, you've got to
think that he's not done proving
the naysayers wrong.
Four years ago, Chris O'Riordan stepped onto
Stanford's campus as a wide-eyed freshman, just look
ing to make the baseball team as a walk-on infielder.

He had taken a chance, spurning recruiting offers
from much less competitive schools like the University
of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth and Tulane in favor of
coming to Stanford, where he hoped just to get on the
roster of one of the nation's top teams.
Don't be mistaken ... he knew he was good
enough to play, but lie just wasn't sure if he was going
to get the chance to show everyone else his ability.
The 5-foot-9,165-pound freshman had just gradu
ated from a small high school in San Diego, lacking the
critical acclaim that almost all of the highly-touted
baseball recruits coming into Stanford already had in
their portfolios.

"Coming in as a freshman, I wasn't even consider
ing getting drafted or anything like that," O'Riordan
said. "1 just wanted to play college baseball. 1 thought
it would be fun. My perspective on things has changed
a little, I guess."
It's hard to imagine someone coming out of
nowhere to so abruptly make such a big impact on the
Cardinal's historic baseball program. But t hat's exact
ly what O'Riordan did, with a performance dramatic
enough to change the perspectives of a lot of people.
For the past three years, rarely has there been any
doubt who would be manning second base when head
coach Mark Marquess trotted to home plate with the
lineup card. O'Riordan has marked his territory bet
ter than any German Shepherd could ever dream of,
with a couple All-American seasons fending off any
would-be competition.
After a disheartening freshman campaign that saw
the true walk-on appear in only two contests without a
single plate appearance, O'Riordan burst onto the
scene during his sophomore year, taking over as the
team's starting second baseman during the preseason


MATT SAYLES & LAURA BENNETT/The Stanford Daily Filf
and starting in all but one of the
team's final 47 games.
Long gone was the cautious,
wide-eyed freshman. In his place
was a determined ballplayer who
knew he was good enough to play,
and who was convinced that if he
wasn't going to get the playing time
at Stanford, he could — and would
— succeed elsewhere.
"Coming in, I was incredibly in
timidated with guys like John Gall,
who led the national team in hit
ting the summer before, Jason
Young and Justin Wayne, who
were incredible pitchers," said
O'Riordan. "But alter practicing
with everyone [during freshman
year], I realized that it was going to
work out, that I was going to be
able to compete with these guys
and play at the same level."
In this breakthrough year, ()'Ri
ordan led the team with a .366 bat
ting average to go along with 15
doubles, three homers and 34 RBI
en route to being named a Pacific
10 All-Conference Honorable
Mention choice.
As O'Riordan will be the lirst one
to admit, it didn't hurt batting be
hind the much-feared trio of out
fiedlers Gall, Joe Bon hard and Ed
mund Muth, who hit a combined
52 homers in that 2000 season.
In what was a perfect situation
for the first-time starter, O'Riordan

saw a steady diet of fastballs. I le
wasn't counted on for much offen
sive production and was allowed to
concentrate on defense while let
ting the big boys do the damage at
the plate.
But as times change, roles
change, and O'Riordan was about
to assume a much greater one.
When he and his fellow team
mates returned for last year's cam
paign, there was not a single senior
and only three returning starters iti
the lineup.
No longer could he sit back and
watch while quietly doing his job. It
was his time to become a leader.
And lead lie did, with a spectac
ular junior season in which he was
named a first-team All American,
first-team All-Pac-10 and Stanford's
most valuable player.
At the top of the lineup, O'Ri
ordan paced the Cardinal in al
most every offensive category,
showing a power stroke that be
lied his now-180-pound frame —
a 15-pound gain that he attributes
to a strict weightlifting regimen.
He led the team with 12 homers
and 08 RBI.
In only two years, O'Riordan
had gone from an ignored walk-on
who was just trying to make the
team to a bona fide star on a team
that was runner-up for the national
championship.
"Asa freshman, 1 just wanted to
figure out some way to get in the
lineup and contribute," said O'Ri
ordan. "But as the years went on, 1
started getting a different role,

started realizing that I could be a
leader on this team."
Almost surprised, he added, "It
just kind of happened."
Now in his senior season, which
lie entered as a preseason first-team
All-American, it's still happening.
O'Riordan is again putting up the
great numbers that Cardinal fans
have become accustomed to, hat
ting .346 with seven home runs and
37 RBI, while starting all 45 games
at second base.
With a .358 career batting aver
