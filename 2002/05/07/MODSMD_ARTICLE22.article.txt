### MAC LEVINE STAFF WRITER 
Four years ago, Chris O'Riordan stepped onto
Stanford's campus as a wide-eyed freshman, just look
ing to make the baseball team as a walk-on infielder.

He had taken a chance, spurning recruiting offers
from much less competitive schools like the University
of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth and Tulane in favor of
coming to Stanford, where he hoped just to get on the
roster of one of the nation's top teams.
Don't be mistaken ... he knew he was good
enough to play, but lie just wasn't sure if he was going
to get the chance to show everyone else his ability.
The 5-foot-9,165-pound freshman had just gradu
ated from a small high school in San Diego, lacking the
critical acclaim that almost all of the highly-touted
baseball recruits coming into Stanford already had in
their portfolios.

"Coming in as a freshman, I wasn't even consider
ing getting drafted or anything like that," O'Riordan
said. "1 just wanted to play college baseball. 1 thought
it would be fun. My perspective on things has changed
a little, I guess."
It's hard to imagine someone coming out of
nowhere to so abruptly make such a big impact on the
Cardinal's historic baseball program. But t hat's exact
ly what O'Riordan did, with a performance dramatic
enough to change the perspectives of a lot of people.
For the past three years, rarely has there been any
doubt who would be manning second base when head
coach Mark Marquess trotted to home plate with the
lineup card. O'Riordan has marked his territory bet
ter than any German Shepherd could ever dream of,
with a couple All-American seasons fending off any
would-be competition.
After a disheartening freshman campaign that saw
the true walk-on appear in only two contests without a
single plate appearance, O'Riordan burst onto the
scene during his sophomore year, taking over as the
team's starting second baseman during the preseason
