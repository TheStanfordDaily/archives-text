MEN'S LACROSSE

Wednesday: No. 6 Stanford vs. No. 11 Texas
A&M, 9:30 a.m., first round of USILA National
Championships, St. Louis

The tournament organizers seemed to have
learned their lesson from last year. Stanford was
tabbed to be the No. (i seed for the 2002 National
Championships, which begin tomorrow in St. Louis.
With the higher seed comes higher expectations
for the Cardinal squad, which will be tested early as
the Cardinal goes up against No. 11 Texas A&M in
the first round of the 16-team bracket.
The Aggies defeated long-time rival Texas, 13-12,
on April 21 to capture the Lone
Star Alliance conference c hampi
onship.
Stanford enters heads to St.
Louis coming off a second-place
finish in the Western College
Lacrosse League tournament.
On April 20, Stanford c rushed
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, 19-5, in
the quarterfinals. A week later, the
Cardinal c ruised past Arizona, 12-
8, behind four goals from senior
midfielder lan Weiss.
In the April 28 final, Sonoma
State shut out Stanford in the first
half, taking a 3-0 lead into the
third quarter.
Sophomore attacker Kiel
Renick led a Stanford comeback by
picking up a natural hat trick to
even the game at 3-3. But the Cos
sacks' Ryan Crickmore responded
with a hat trick of his own before the
third quarter was over, and Sono
ma State held on for an 8-4 win.
The three goals by Renick were
indicative of the late-season push
Stanford has received from sever

ul ol its young players on offense.
With injuries plaguing the Cardi
nal all year, the boost from its
freshmen and sophomores has
been perfectly timed heading into
the rest of post-season play.
"We're an energy team, and
whether we play with energy our
without it determines whether we
win," Weiss said. "When the
younger players have their energy
up, the team is up. Their goals are
the differences in games."
Along with Renick, sopho
more Beau Lewis and freshmen
Brooks Kinkaid and Kian
Eftekhari have been a part of the
offensive explosion by the team's
younger players.
Stanford has also suffered from
injuries in its backfield, most no
tably to junior goalkeeper Joe
Kennedy, whose season ended
with a knee injury midway
through the season. Junior Gavin
Sun, who split time with Kennedy
in net last year, assumed the goal
tending responsibilities and has
responded well, going 5-3 since
Kennedy's injury.
The Cardinal welcomed senior
defender Paul Sargen back to the
lineup during the WCLL tourna

ment. Sargen, who injured his
knee before the season, is just
about back ai full strength, and his
return adds a great deal of experi
ence to the Stanford backfield.
Stanford will see many familiar
faces in St. Louis this week. The
(Cossacks, who also defeated Stan
ford 12-9 on Mar. 3, earned the
No. 1 seed for the tournament.
The Wildcats, the Golden
Bears, the Mustangs and UC-
Santa Barbara will also be repre
senting the WGLL in St. Louis.
The Cardinal will have its work
cut out lor it if it hopes to repeat
last year's surprising champi
onship run.
A first-round win lor the Gardi
nal could set up a rematch of last
year's championship game with
Colorado State, which defeated
Stanford again, 13-7, in March.
"Our losses this year have all
come to teams above us in the
rankings," Weiss said. "Colorado
State is the match to win lot us,
and win there would really propel
us through the rest of the tourna
ment. We know a lot of these
teams, so we won't be psyched out
by anyone and we'll be comfort
able with all of out opponents."
