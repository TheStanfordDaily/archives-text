### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Students, faculty and community mem
bers spilled out of McCaw Hall at the
Frances C. Arrillaga Alumni Center yes
terday afternoon to hear former U.S. Pres
ident Jimmy Carter speak about his in
volvement with China both during and
after his term, as well as the current state of
U.S.-China relations.

In the inaugural Oksenberg Lecture,
created to honor China scholar and for
mer Political Science Prof. Michel Oksen
berg, Carter discussed the politics leading
up to the 1979 normalization of U.S. rela
tions with China, the progress the Chinese
government has made in (lie years since
his presidency and his contemporary con
cerns about the region, including Taiwan,
Tibet and restrictions on worship.
Russell Hancock, director of the

Shorenstein Forum for Asia-Pacific Stud
ies, which sponsored the talk, began the
event by proclaiming to a crowd of hun
dreds, "This looks like Carter country."
Asia / Pacific Research Center Director
Andrew Walder followed Hancock's re
marks on the creation of the lecture with a
brief biography of Oksenberg's life and an
explanation of his role in shaping U.S. re
lations with China.
University President John Hennessy
introduced Carter, who served as U.S.
president from 1977 to 1981, by offering a
history of the 39th president's life and
stressing his work on ensuring social jus
tice and human rights, as well as his effort
to procure peace in the Middle East and
other regions.
Hennessy described Carter as t he "per
fect choice" to deliver the first Oksenberg
lecture because of his history with China
and relationship with Oksenberg, who
served in the National Security Council
during Carter's presidency.
"As one who has long admired his
moral leadership and continued engage
ment in world affairs, I'm looking forward
to his remarks today," Hennessy said.
After easing the crowd into his talk with
a joke he made when traveling in Japan,
Carter spoke of Oksenberg's legacy, stat
ing that he "to some degree changed the
life of every citizen of China."
Carter went on to discuss his personal
history with China, describing his time in
the Navy and his memory of when Taiwan

broke away from mainland China and the
People's Republic of China was created.
Carter then explained the inner work
ings of his administration's treatment of
China, stating that once the People's Re
public of China came into being, there was
an "altercation between China experts,
like Mike Oksenberg, and others in the
U.S. government." He said the govern
ment operated on the premise that the
Chinese communists were only in power

by force, an assumption that paved the
way for McCarthyism in the United States.
"Our nation developed its policy to
ward that powerful nation, the largest in
population on earth, under a false premise
— that Taiwan was really China," he said.

Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter addressed a large crowd yesterday afternoon. Carter
spoke on the history of U.S.-China relations, as well as contemporary issues.
lions that needed to be concealed
even from the State Department
because if (he efforts to establish
relations with China had become
public, it "would abort our efforts,"
lie said.
"In the State Department, noth
ing is secret," he said. "There is a
pipeline between the Washington
Post and the State Department."
These negotiations between the
White House and China resulted
in the Dec. 15, 1978 decision to
normalize relations between the
two countries.
"The President can declare
diplomatic relations with any
country on earth, and the Con
gress [can have] nothing to say
about it," Carter said.
Carter then discussed his experi
ence wit h Chinese leader Deng Xi
aoping and relayed an interaction
that happened after Carter's term

where Xiaoping asked him if there
was anything he could do for
China. Carter responded that there
was no religious freedom in the
country, and stated that by 1982,
China had changed its constitution
to guarantee freedom of worship.
•Next, Carter moved to a discus
sion of China in the present.
"There was and have been in
credible changes in China," he
said, citing democratic elections in
small villages and farming pro
grams initiated in the early 1980s.
1 iowever, Carter also voiced his
concern about several prominent
issues facing modern China.
He expressed concern that the
dispute between China and Tai
wan would not be resolved peace
fully. He also said he was very
"concerned about the constraints
on the people of Tibet," citing
damage to their culture and reli
gion. I le expanded this to encom
pass general concerns about free
dom of worship in China.
" They have a way to go in hon
oring human lights," he added.

Carter concluded by under
scoring the rising importance of
China and paying tribute to ()s
-kenberg.
"I think that in the years ahead
the most important bilateral rela
tions in the world will be between
the United States and China," he
said. "I do know one thing — the
prospect for peace and for
progress and fora better life for
Chinese and Americans would be
better if Mike Oskenberg will still
here with us."
After Carter's speech there
were three audience questions, to
which Carter responded by com
paring (Miina and (aiba, calling for
a reconsideration of travel and
other restrictions on the country.
He also discussed missile defense
and the minimal prospects of
armed conflict in the near future,
as well as his decision to boycott the
1980 Olympics in Moscow.
Students responded well to
Carter's speech, many citing his
humor and apparent amicability.
"He has just a great sense of

humor," said first year master's
student in Epidemiology Bahareh
Ebrahimzadeh. "1 love that."
Because of the diverse sub
stance of Carter's speech, student
reactions to the politics of the talk
varied greatly.
"He definitely seemed a little
hesitant about the future of U.S.-
China relations, which is key, espe
cially with the current administra
tion," said freshman Adam Forest.
Freshman Victor Marsh said
he was glad that Carter brought
to light North Korea's nuclear
inability in response to an audi
ence question.
"I just hope it makes people
think about the whole 'axis of evil'
and whether it's constructive,"
Marsh said.
Other students applauded
the less political issues Carter
discussed.
"I was really impressed with
how much he talked, about his
faith," senior Sabina Leung said.
"It was neat to me to see that I was
important to him."
