### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Students, faculty and community mem
bers spilled out of McCaw Hall at the
Frances C. Arrillaga Alumni Center yes
terday afternoon to hear former U.S. Pres
ident Jimmy Carter speak about his in
volvement with China both during and
after his term, as well as the current state of
U.S.-China relations.

In the inaugural Oksenberg Lecture,
created to honor China scholar and for
mer Political Science Prof. Michel Oksen
berg, Carter discussed the politics leading
up to the 1979 normalization of U.S. rela
tions with China, the progress the Chinese
government has made in (lie years since
his presidency and his contemporary con
cerns about the region, including Taiwan,
Tibet and restrictions on worship.
Russell Hancock, director of the

Shorenstein Forum for Asia-Pacific Stud
ies, which sponsored the talk, began the
event by proclaiming to a crowd of hun
dreds, "This looks like Carter country."
Asia / Pacific Research Center Director
Andrew Walder followed Hancock's re
marks on the creation of the lecture with a
brief biography of Oksenberg's life and an
explanation of his role in shaping U.S. re
lations with China.
University President John Hennessy
introduced Carter, who served as U.S.
president from 1977 to 1981, by offering a
history of the 39th president's life and
stressing his work on ensuring social jus
tice and human rights, as well as his effort
to procure peace in the Middle East and
other regions.
Hennessy described Carter as t he "per
fect choice" to deliver the first Oksenberg
lecture because of his history with China
and relationship with Oksenberg, who
served in the National Security Council
during Carter's presidency.
"As one who has long admired his
moral leadership and continued engage
ment in world affairs, I'm looking forward
to his remarks today," Hennessy said.
After easing the crowd into his talk with
a joke he made when traveling in Japan,
Carter spoke of Oksenberg's legacy, stat
ing that he "to some degree changed the
life of every citizen of China."
Carter went on to discuss his personal
history with China, describing his time in
the Navy and his memory of when Taiwan

broke away from mainland China and the
People's Republic of China was created.
Carter then explained the inner work
ings of his administration's treatment of
China, stating that once the People's Re
public of China came into being, there was
an "altercation between China experts,
like Mike Oksenberg, and others in the
U.S. government." He said the govern
ment operated on the premise that the
Chinese communists were only in power

by force, an assumption that paved the
way for McCarthyism in the United States.
"Our nation developed its policy to
ward that powerful nation, the largest in
population on earth, under a false premise
â€” that Taiwan was really China," he said.
