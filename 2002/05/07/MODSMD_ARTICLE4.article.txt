# Carter offers his thoughts
## 
### JOHN SHAPIRO 
Editor's Note: The Daily interviewed, former
U.S. President Jimmy Carter before his
speech yesterday afternoon. The following are
excerpts from the interview.
The Daily: It seems that after your
presidency, world hunger hasn't been
on political agendas centrally. Why do
you think this is and what do you think
can be done?
Carter: Since I left office, the United
States' commitment to development as
sistance of foreign aid has dropped pre
cipitously, and we've now gotten to be the
least generous nation on earth. As far as
sharing our wealth with needy people is

concerned, we give a little bit less than
one-thousandth of our gross national
product in development assistance of a
humanitarian nature. A good portion of
our so-called foreign aid goes to other
countries to buy weapons from us, not to
alleviate hunger or to provide education.
The average European country gives
four times as much the average Ameri
can. A Norwegian citizen gives 17 times
more than we do, and we're at the bot
tom of the list as far as generosity is con
cerned. 1.2 billion people on earth live on
less than $1 each day, and that includes
food, shelter and clothing, which they
have to have. This means an absolute ab
sence of education or health care, which
is a very serious problem.
Daily: Compared to relations with
China, how do you see relations
with the former Soviet Union?
Carter: They are similar in some
ways and also different. China is a
viable country with a strong econ
omy. It hasn't been divided up into
parts, is self-sufficient and doesn't
have the nuclear arsenal to threat
en ours. On the other hand, in
Russia, what's left of the Soviet
Union is debilitated economically,
they have a massive nuclear arse
nal that is on somewhat-ready alert
and are somewhat dependent on
the United States and on the Euro
pean countries to bring them into
a negotiating status so they can
have some role in shaping future
events. China is willing and able to
stand alone. The two nations
should be treated completely sepa

lately. There used to be tensions
along the Clhincse-Russian holder,
hut I don't think you now see any
competition between the nations.
Q: What do you think about our re
lations with Russia?
A: I think we should reach out in
every way to help Russia econom
ically. We should strengthen Rus
sia's commit merit to democracy in
any fashion we can. We should
treat them with respect and con
tinue to negotiate with them on
things like comprehensive test
bans and desensitizing nut lear ar
senals. I would like to see (the
missiles] taken out of their ready
stage and put into semi-moth
balls, which hasn't been done yet.
We should consult with them on
matters relating to other coun
tries. Obviously, the Middle Kast
situation is one of those of in
volved, as well as our future rela
tionships with Iraq, with Iran,
with North Korea. They still have
pretty good relationships with
those countries, which we have

condemned as an "Axes of Kvil."
I lie main tiling we need to do is
help Russia economically and
treat them with respect so they
won't be embarrassed, won't be
paranoid and won't turn against
us with animosity.
Q: There is talk of a program de
signed at Stanford that would in
volve remotely disabling aeeess to
the controls of an airplane from the
cockpit and being able to land the
plane from the ground. Given your
the events ofSepU 11 and your engi
neering background, what are your
opinions about such a system?
A: I think ii would lie a good hack
up to have. I think the final deci
sion of whether or not it should be
used should be [with] the pilot, as
suming thai the pilot survives. I lie
pilot, once he triggered it, |could|
let it he so automatic that it could
not be modified again. I ("someone
threatened to hurt the pilot or tor
ture the pilot, he could not reverse
the process. I think somebody
from lhe ground shouldn't be able

to initiate il over the objection of
the pilot.
(£; The professors who have been
contacted about this said there are
no technical limitations at this
point. It is simply the certification
process that needs to be completed.
Would you implement such a system?
A: I hat process would have to be
followed, maybe even with hear
ings in the Congress to let all the
voices be considered. 1 hen, either
the | Federal Aviation Administra
tion] would make an administra
tive decision if they're authorized
to do so. or the Congress would
pass a law, which may or may not
be necessary.
(J: Would passing a law in Congress
be a viable option?
A: Of course, the Congress could
always do it. The only thing that
could change thai is a presidential
veto. I don't know how much au
thority the FAA has. but you may
not need a law.

Daily: Compared to relations with
China, how do you see relations
with the former Soviet Union?
Carter: They are similar in some
ways and also different. China is a
viable country with a strong econ
omy. It hasn't been divided up into
parts, is self-sufficient and doesn't
have the nuclear arsenal to threat
en ours. On the other hand, in
Russia, what's left of the Soviet
Union is debilitated economically,
they have a massive nuclear arse
nal that is on somewhat-ready alert
and are somewhat dependent on
the United States and on the Euro
pean countries to bring them into
a negotiating status so they can
have some role in shaping future
events. China is willing and able to
stand alone. The two nations
should be treated completely sepa

lately. There used to be tensions
along the Clhincse-Russian holder,
hut I don't think you now see any
competition between the nations.
Q: What do you think about our re
lations with Russia?
A: I think we should reach out in
every way to help Russia econom
ically. We should strengthen Rus
sia's commit merit to democracy in
any fashion we can. We should
treat them with respect and con
tinue to negotiate with them on
things like comprehensive test
bans and desensitizing nut lear ar
senals. I would like to see (the
missiles] taken out of their ready
stage and put into semi-moth
balls, which hasn't been done yet.
We should consult with them on
matters relating to other coun
tries. Obviously, the Middle Kast
situation is one of those of in
volved, as well as our future rela
tionships with Iraq, with Iran,
with North Korea. They still have
pretty good relationships with
those countries, which we have

condemned as an "Axes of Kvil."
I lie main tiling we need to do is
help Russia economically and
treat them with respect so they
won't be embarrassed, won't be
paranoid and won't turn against
us with animosity.
Q: There is talk of a program de
signed at Stanford that would in
volve remotely disabling aeeess to
the controls of an airplane from the
cockpit and being able to land the
plane from the ground. Given your
the events ofSepU 11 and your engi
neering background, what are your
opinions about such a system?
A: I think ii would lie a good hack
up to have. I think the final deci
sion of whether or not it should be
used should be [with] the pilot, as
suming thai the pilot survives. I lie
pilot, once he triggered it, |could|
let it he so automatic that it could
not be modified again. I ("someone
threatened to hurt the pilot or tor
ture the pilot, he could not reverse
the process. I think somebody
from lhe ground shouldn't be able

to initiate il over the objection of
the pilot.
(£; The professors who have been
contacted about this said there are
no technical limitations at this
point. It is simply the certification
process that needs to be completed.
Would you implement such a system?
A: I hat process would have to be
followed, maybe even with hear
ings in the Congress to let all the
voices be considered. 1 hen, either
the | Federal Aviation Administra
tion] would make an administra
tive decision if they're authorized
to do so. or the Congress would
pass a law, which may or may not
be necessary.
(J: Would passing a law in Congress
be a viable option?
A: Of course, the Congress could
always do it. The only thing that
could change thai is a presidential
veto. I don't know how much au
thority the FAA has. but you may
not need a law.
