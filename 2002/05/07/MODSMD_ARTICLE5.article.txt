# Housing with a beat
## Dead houses alive and well 
### VESSELA STOYANOVA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Tired of having to hide the candles in
your room during break? Finding the white
wall paint a little too bland? Off-campus
housing alternatives do exist, and one of
them might involve becoming a Grateful
Dead house resident.
lucked in Palo Alto's residential area —
within biking distance from campus — are
the houses that have attracted Stanford stu
dents for two decades. Currently, they are
populated by a motley crew: former co-op res
idents, environmental activists, musicians and

NCAA champions are among the 80 members
of this micro-community.
"I'm really enjoying living off campus and
being in a mellow environment where every
one is friendly and happy," said senior water
polo player Todd Snider.
Snider and three of his teammates share
living quarters in Birdsong, one of the 14
houses named after Grateful Dead songs.
The first one, Terrapin Station, was acquired
in 1982 by Rob Levitsky of Palo Alto. Subse
quently, he added Box of Rain, Dark Hol
low, Scarlet Fire, Birdsong, Morning Dew,
Touch of Gray, Shakedown Street, New
Speedway Boogie, Truckin', Unbroken

Chain, Uncle John's Hand, China Cat Sun
flower and Dire Wolf.
These sundry names are befitting for ihe
houses, which* range from stately three-story
structures with pillars and verandas to modest
one-story bungalows. The number of tenants
varies as well, from as few as two to one dozen
students per house.
According to Levitsky, one of the house's
attractions is that they offer greater flexibility
than University housing. For example, ten
ants can maintain a garden or paint their
rooms as they wish, as long as they don't
"paint the windows shut."
"I try to provide people the freedom to do
things they want — paint their room, eat how
they want, instead of having to be in a white
room and eat on a formal dining meal plan,"
Levitsky said.
Senior Maurica Carlucci, a member of the
track and cross-country teams who had only
unpreferred housing left for this year, ex
plained the reasons behind her decision to
move into Dark Hollow:
"I had two options — suck it up and live in
a dorm, or move off campus. As an athlete, I
wanted to live somewhere where food was
available at all hours, and where I could go to
bed fairly early. Dorms obviously don't fit this
mold, and housing in Palo Alto was ridicu
lously priced," she said.
The average monthly rent at a Dead house
is $550 per person, which many students find
reasonable in comparison to most other ofl
tam pus alternatives.
"It's also cheaper than on-campus housing
because we don't have to pay fora meal plan,"
said Forrest Fleischman, a senior living in
Shakedown Street. "We split the money for

Students are finding affordable, off-campus housing opportunities in Palo Alto in the form of Grate
