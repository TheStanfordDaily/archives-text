# Crosetto's election challenge peters out
## 
### JOHN HUETTER EDITORIAL STAFF 
Just before the deadline to hold a
runoff election expired last week, se
nior Patrick Crosetto accused the
ASSU Election Commission of
"stonewalling" in its handling of his
formal contest to the 2002 ASSU
presidential election.
Crosetto had submitted an infor
mal complaint on April 18 and a for
mal one on April 22 claiming that
President-Elect Monica Henestroza
and Vice-President Elect Nick Ro
driguez did not receive a majority of
the votes cast, as the ASSU Constitu
tion requires.
ASSU Elections Commissioner
Gedioen Aloula, a junior, said that
he had given an initial decision to
Crosetto around April 19, and
promised to inform him on the
commission's April 24 meeting if
his challenge yielded any changes
in this position. Because it did not,
Aloula did not contact Crosetto
again until a written report was
submitted to Crosetto on either
April 29 or April 30.
"[Aloula] held onto the ball and
(hopped it for about eight days,"
Crosetto said.
"Basically we took a long time
responding because we felt the
document that we were going to be
responding to him with was going
to be an important one," Aloula
said. "Making sure everytliing is by
the book took a while."
The council's "stonewalling" in

writing a decision, Crosetto said,
prevented him from getting the
matter brought to the council be
fore the constitutionally-specified
May 2 runoff deadline.
Aloula said that Crosetto's wait
ing until April 22 to file a formal cl lal
lenge naturally resulted in the coun
cil's decision being down to the wire.
"We took five or six days,"
Aloula agreed, "but if il were five
or six days from [April 17), it
would have been fine."
"If we disagreed with his objec
tion, we had to make sure to ad
dress each one of his arguments,"
Aloula said. "A quick response
would only have come if we had
agreed with him."
As Crosetto had threatened to
bring the matter to the council and
Santa Clara County Court, Aloula
said the commission had to spend
extra time ensuring the document
was as polished as possible. "We
had to make sure we had a response
with no holes in it," Aloula said.
"We made sure the way we were
looking at this matches up with the
legal governing documents,"Aloula
continued, and noted that attempt
ing to bring the commission togeth
er on busy student schedules was
difficult. Hence, they met two days
after Crosetto's formal challenge.
Crosetto said he had never
heard of the April 24 meeting and
had not attempted to contact any
one else outside of Aloula on the
