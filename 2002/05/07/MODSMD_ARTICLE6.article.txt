# Crosetto's election challenge peters out
## 
### JOHN HUETTER EDITORIAL STAFF 
Just before the deadline to hold a
runoff election expired last week, se
nior Patrick Crosetto accused the
ASSU Election Commission of
"stonewalling" in its handling of his
formal contest to the 2002 ASSU
presidential election.
Crosetto had submitted an infor
mal complaint on April 18 and a for
mal one on April 22 claiming that
President-Elect Monica Henestroza
and Vice-President Elect Nick Ro
driguez did not receive a majority of
the votes cast, as the ASSU Constitu
tion requires.
ASSU Elections Commissioner
Gedioen Aloula, a junior, said that
he had given an initial decision to
Crosetto around April 19, and
promised to inform him on the
commission's April 24 meeting if
his challenge yielded any changes
in this position. Because it did not,
Aloula did not contact Crosetto
again until a written report was
submitted to Crosetto on either
April 29 or April 30.
"[Aloula] held onto the ball and
(hopped it for about eight days,"
Crosetto said.
"Basically we took a long time
responding because we felt the
document that we were going to be
responding to him with was going
to be an important one," Aloula
said. "Making sure everytliing is by
the book took a while."
The council's "stonewalling" in

writing a decision, Crosetto said,
prevented him from getting the
matter brought to the council be
fore the constitutionally-specified
May 2 runoff deadline.
Aloula said that Crosetto's wait
ing until April 22 to file a formal cl lal
lenge naturally resulted in the coun
cil's decision being down to the wire.
"We took five or six days,"
Aloula agreed, "but if il were five
or six days from [April 17), it
would have been fine."
"If we disagreed with his objec
tion, we had to make sure to ad
dress each one of his arguments,"
Aloula said. "A quick response
would only have come if we had
agreed with him."
As Crosetto had threatened to
bring the matter to the council and
Santa Clara County Court, Aloula
said the commission had to spend
extra time ensuring the document
was as polished as possible. "We
had to make sure we had a response
with no holes in it," Aloula said.
"We made sure the way we were
looking at this matches up with the
legal governing documents,"Aloula
continued, and noted that attempt
ing to bring the commission togeth
er on busy student schedules was
difficult. Hence, they met two days
after Crosetto's formal challenge.
Crosetto said he had never
heard of the April 24 meeting and
had not attempted to contact any
one else outside of Aloula on the
commission to find out when it was.
Aloula said Crosetto never con
tacted him about the meeting
venue, and added that Crosetto
could have gotten the information
from any of the other Election Com
mission members or members of
the ASSU Executive Committee.
Aloula said he told Crosetto that
a meeting would be held the morn
ing of April 24, though he did not
mention the location.
"1 didn't specify that because 1
wasn't asked," Aloula said. "We
have all out meetings in the ASSU
office anyway . .. he could have
easily have found that out."
San Jose Mercury News writer
Kim Vo, who had been following
the story, called Aloula after the
meeting to see if the commission
had changed its stance. She then
called Crosetto for his input the
next day regarding the meeting,
which Crosetto was surprised to
hear had even happened.
"I said we're meeting about this
Wednesday morning," Aloula

said. "It's not that we were trying
to hide anything .. . they're open
meetings."
"[The commission] would have
been glad to hear more of his
input," Aloula said.
Crosetto said he could not pro
ceed to gather the necessary signa
tures (from either 5 percent of the
student body, 5 undergraduate
senators and /or Graduate Stu
dent Council members, or from
the ASSU president or vice presi
dent) to bring the case to the Con
stitutional Council without know
ing what he was protesting. The
commission, he said, would have to
make a formal decision on the mat
ter before he could begin collecting
signatures to protest the election.
Without specific claims, Croset
to said he feared the council would
ignore his case; he also said council
member Robert Rudnitsky, a doc
toral candidate in applied physics,
told him to get a formal commis
sion decision before bringing his
case to the council.
Crosetto said the initial decision,
written around April 19 by Aloula
and recent council appointee Har
ris Shapiro, a doctoral candidate in
physics, was not legitimate because

it was Shapiro's opinion and not
that of the entire commission.
Crosetto said he was not sure if
he would still attempt to have the
council rule on the matter.
Aloula said that while the
commission's decision is not nec
essarily applicable to a challenge
to next year's election, the rea
soning used by the commission
certainly are, and the commis
sion's decision would be made
public should similar challenges
arise in the future.
Despite his complaints with the
commission, Crosetto may have
won a slight victory from the outgo
ing ASSU Undergraduate Senate.
At its meeting last Tuesday, Senate
Chair Alex Shvartsman addressed
the challenge and told the new sen
ators present, as well as I lenestroza,
a junior, to look into the matter
"while the issue is â€¢still pertinent."
The fact that a student brought
the challenge, Shvartsman said, was
a good enough reason to investigate.
"That's a s,ign that something
needs to be done," he said.
Aloula said it was fine if someone
wanted to investigate, but iu his
opinion, the issue was "an open-and
shut-case.
