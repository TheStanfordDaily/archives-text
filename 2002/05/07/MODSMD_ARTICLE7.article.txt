### SARAH LUSTBADER 
Sgt. Dean Baker said Friday that he
found no police "wrongdoing" in the fatal
shooting of Pedro (-alderon Jr., which took
place in March on the Stanford campus.
1 lis family continues to protest, though.
Baker, a Santa Clara County Sheriff's
investigator, gave his official 400-page re
port on the controversial shooting to the
Santa Clara County District Attorney's Of
fice on Friday. In the report, he said that

the evidence shows no criminal miscon
duct on the part of t he officers.
"It is not my place to determine whether
the shooting was legal or not. That's up to
the grand jury," Baker said. "I just present
the facts, pro or con."
Unlike in many state jurisdictions, every
deadly force incident in Santa (llara (boun
ty is presented before a grand jury. Baker
gave June 17 as a tentative date for the
hearings to begin.
Dave Davies, the thief assistant to the

district attorney, said that the grand jury
proceedings are by law kept secret and that
the report would be unavailable until after
the hearing.
"The report looks very thorough,"
Davies said.
On March 20, police say, three officers
stopped Calderon, a 20-year-old resem
bling a burglary suspect. When lie tried to
escape in a stolen BMW, Palo Alto Police
Officer Jessica Perryman and Santa Clara
Sheriff's county Deputy Jeff Bell each fired

one shot.
Baker said that he was still waiting fora
ballistics report, pending from Santa Clara
County's crime lab, to determine which
shot was fatal, though it is believed to be
Perryman's.
Perryman said she fired her semi-auto
matic out of self-defense. She told the San
Jose Mercury News that just before the bul
lets were fired, she felt like she was being
rolled "like a cigarette" between her patrol
car and the BMW, and then she was

dropped to the ground.
According to prosecutors, no polite offi
cer in Santa Clara County lias been con
victed after an on-duty, fatal shooting in
the recent past.
Ferryman and Bell are both on admin
istrative leave.
There is also a confidential adminis
trative review of the incident in
progress, according to Palo Alto Police
