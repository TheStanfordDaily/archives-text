# Report absolves police of wrongdoing in campus shooting
## 
### SARAH LUSTBADER 
Sgt. Dean Baker said Friday that he
found no police "wrongdoing" in the fatal
shooting of Pedro (-alderon Jr., which took
place in March on the Stanford campus.
1 lis family continues to protest, though.
Baker, a Santa Clara County Sheriff's
investigator, gave his official 400-page re
port on the controversial shooting to the
Santa Clara County District Attorney's Of
fice on Friday. In the report, he said that

the evidence shows no criminal miscon
duct on the part of t he officers.
"It is not my place to determine whether
the shooting was legal or not. That's up to
the grand jury," Baker said. "I just present
the facts, pro or con."
Unlike in many state jurisdictions, every
deadly force incident in Santa (llara (boun
ty is presented before a grand jury. Baker
gave June 17 as a tentative date for the
hearings to begin.
Dave Davies, the thief assistant to the

district attorney, said that the grand jury
proceedings are by law kept secret and that
the report would be unavailable until after
the hearing.
"The report looks very thorough,"
Davies said.
On March 20, police say, three officers
stopped Calderon, a 20-year-old resem
bling a burglary suspect. When lie tried to
escape in a stolen BMW, Palo Alto Police
Officer Jessica Perryman and Santa Clara
Sheriff's county Deputy Jeff Bell each fired

one shot.
Baker said that he was still waiting fora
ballistics report, pending from Santa Clara
County's crime lab, to determine which
shot was fatal, though it is believed to be
Perryman's.
Perryman said she fired her semi-auto
matic out of self-defense. She told the San
Jose Mercury News that just before the bul
lets were fired, she felt like she was being
rolled "like a cigarette" between her patrol
car and the BMW, and then she was

dropped to the ground.
According to prosecutors, no polite offi
cer in Santa Clara County lias been con
victed after an on-duty, fatal shooting in
the recent past.
Ferryman and Bell are both on admin
istrative leave.
There is also a confidential adminis
trative review of the incident in
progress, according to Palo Alto Police
Chief Pat Dwyer.
"The investigation is proceed
ing as expeditiously as possible,"
Dwyer said. "I am satisfied that [in
vestigators] are doing a thorough
and objective job."
But, according to the San Jose
Mercury News, Calderon's family
members, who are considering a
wrongful death lawsuit, still won
der why Perryman and Bell felt it
necessary to fire at the East Palo
Alto resident.
Four days after the shooting,
Calderon's family and friends
protested along Stanford Ave.
They questioned the incident and
said they had not been informed
of his death until 36 hours after it
had occurred.

"I don't believe the cop felt
threatened, because they are pre
pared for these things," Alicia
Calderon, the mother of the sus
pect, said to the Mercury News.
"[Perryman] could have hit him in
the leg; she didn't have to kill him."
In response to questions
about police conduct, Dwyer
blamed the press for "irresponsi
ble conjectures."
"They should be asking,
'What circumstances would
delay the notification of the fam
ily? Did he have identification?
Did anyone know who he was for
a few days?'"
There have also been accusa
tions that racism was involved in
the event, which has been com
pared to a 1996 fatal shooting, also
involving a white police officer and
a Latino victim.
"Any allegation that race played
any role is absurd," Dwyer said.
