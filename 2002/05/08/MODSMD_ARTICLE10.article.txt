# Students expand studies with URP

### CHRISTY MACHIDA 
For many students, the idea of
research conjures up images of
long hours at a computer, churn
ing out page after page of a thesis.
However, thanks to funds from the
University's Undergraduate Re
search Programs, not all student
research has to be done behind a
desk.
The URP — formerly the Un
dergraduate Research Opportuni
ties office — sends techies and
fuz/ies alike on intellectual safaris
from East Palo Alto to East Asia.
Numerous grants assist students to
acquire the technical equipment,
travel experience, and faculty con
nections critical to high-quality
field research in their majors.
Senior Dana Howard is one of
the many students who have taken
advantage of the available research
funds. With the support of grant
funds, Howard spent two summers
researching in Israel where she
learned Arabic, researched avail
able educational programs and in
terviewed Palestinian teachers and
writers of textbooks.
Using this experience, Howard
has focused her senior honors the
sis in philosophy on civic education
in Israel and the treatment of mi
nority groups in the educational
system.
"Going to Israel really helped
me because I was able to get a solid
foundation on who the people are

and how their identities are shaped
by the educational system," she
said.
In the past few years Stanford's
research programs have expand
ed, allowing for greater opportuni
ty for intellectual exploration and
discovery. According to Laura
Selznick, associate director of Un
dergraduate Research Programs,
there is a new multitude of grant
programs now available to stu
dents.
"The [U RO office] was previous
ly a small office that offered only
grants and advising," Selznick ex
plained. "However, now the URO
has been changed to the URP, Un
dergraduate Research Programs,
providing new research opportuni
ties and services for students."
Within this new, expanded
structure the URP still offers tradi
tional small and major URO
grants. The major and minor
grants are the URP's oldest re
search program, dating back to
1985. ' v
The URP provides over 150
major URO grants and over 200
small grants to Stanford under
graduates each year.
"These grants support student
researchers in their independent
academic study and can be used for
transportation costs, research ma
terial and living expenses."
Selznick said.
"Small grants are won by stu
dents attempting shorter projects

and can be up to $500," Selznick
explained. "Major grants can ex
tend up to $3000 and student ap
plicants must have a project that
will extend over a minimum of
three quarters." - ®
In addition to its grants, the
URP is involved in promoting sev
eral new programs. According to
Selznick, "the [Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education's of lice]
has been involved in initiating an
other avenue of research through
faculty and departmental grants."
Rather than going directly through
the URP office, as in the case of
small and major grants, these
funds allow students to become in
volved in research directly through
their department.
Cultural and Social Anthropolo
gy major Portia Jackson, a senior,
was supported in her honors re
search by both a URQ minor grant
and a departmental public service
grant for field study.
According to Jackson, "the most
difficult part was convincing myself
that 1 could do the work. I had to
overcome the notion that my re
search had to be perfect, and focus
instead on finding a project that
was satisfying to me."
In the end, Jackson decided to
study African-American women
living with chronic Sarcoidosis, a
multi-system disorder character
ized in affected organs by a type of
