# Students expand studies with URP
## 
### CHRISTY MACHIDA 
For many students, the idea of
research conjures up images of
long hours at a computer, churn
ing out page after page of a thesis.
However, thanks to funds from the
University's Undergraduate Re
search Programs, not all student
research has to be done behind a
desk.
The URP — formerly the Un
dergraduate Research Opportuni
ties office — sends techies and
fuz/ies alike on intellectual safaris
from East Palo Alto to East Asia.
Numerous grants assist students to
acquire the technical equipment,
travel experience, and faculty con
nections critical to high-quality
field research in their majors.
Senior Dana Howard is one of
the many students who have taken
advantage of the available research
funds. With the support of grant
funds, Howard spent two summers
researching in Israel where she
learned Arabic, researched avail
able educational programs and in
terviewed Palestinian teachers and
writers of textbooks.
Using this experience, Howard
has focused her senior honors the
sis in philosophy on civic education
in Israel and the treatment of mi
nority groups in the educational
system.
"Going to Israel really helped
me because I was able to get a solid
foundation on who the people are

and how their identities are shaped
by the educational system," she
said.
In the past few years Stanford's
research programs have expand
ed, allowing for greater opportuni
ty for intellectual exploration and
discovery. According to Laura
Selznick, associate director of Un
dergraduate Research Programs,
there is a new multitude of grant
programs now available to stu
dents.
"The [U RO office] was previous
ly a small office that offered only
grants and advising," Selznick ex
plained. "However, now the URO
has been changed to the URP, Un
dergraduate Research Programs,
providing new research opportuni
ties and services for students."
Within this new, expanded
structure the URP still offers tradi
tional small and major URO
grants. The major and minor
grants are the URP's oldest re
search program, dating back to
1985. ' v
The URP provides over 150
major URO grants and over 200
small grants to Stanford under
graduates each year.
"These grants support student
researchers in their independent
academic study and can be used for
transportation costs, research ma
terial and living expenses."
Selznick said.
"Small grants are won by stu
dents attempting shorter projects

and can be up to $500," Selznick
explained. "Major grants can ex
tend up to $3000 and student ap
plicants must have a project that
will extend over a minimum of
three quarters." - ®
In addition to its grants, the
URP is involved in promoting sev
eral new programs. According to
Selznick, "the [Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education's of lice]
has been involved in initiating an
other avenue of research through
faculty and departmental grants."
Rather than going directly through
the URP office, as in the case of
small and major grants, these
funds allow students to become in
volved in research directly through
their department.
Cultural and Social Anthropolo
gy major Portia Jackson, a senior,
was supported in her honors re
search by both a URQ minor grant
and a departmental public service
grant for field study.
According to Jackson, "the most
difficult part was convincing myself
that 1 could do the work. I had to
overcome the notion that my re
search had to be perfect, and focus
instead on finding a project that
was satisfying to me."
In the end, Jackson decided to
study African-American women
living with chronic Sarcoidosis, a
multi-system disorder character
ized in affected organs by a type of
inflammation called granulomas.
"The experience of getting to
know these women and their lives
has been absolutely phenomenal."
Jackson said. "In the past eight
months, they have become my in
spiration in several ways. I can't
describe to you the joy 1 feel in
being able to record their person
al stories."
The URP office oilers students
the opportunity of studying an im
portant issue or concern that they
are personally interested in.
"A research project can provide
an opportunity to be involved in the
discovery of knowledge on an issue
that matters to you," Selznick said.
Similarly, "research enables
you to feel ownership to your
studies and endows an incredible
sense of responsibility and com
mitment in what you are saying,"
according to Howard.
Faculty members apply for de
partmental grants through the
U RP and use the funds to support
student researchers who assist
them in their projects.
"With both of these opportuni
ties, students work closely with fac
ulty and are able to extend their

knowledge in a specialized field."
Selznick said.
Summer Research College is an
other URP-sponsored research op
portunity for Stanford undergrad
uates. In its third summer, the col
lege brings full-time student re
searchers together in a residential
environment.
"The college not only supplies
the opportunity for the pursuit of
research, but also provides a com
munity," Selznick said. "With the
Summer Research College, stu
dents are placed in a consciously
supportive and intellectual envi
ronment that prevents the isolation
that researchers often maintain."
According to Rene Patnode, a
senior majoring in computer sci
ence, "The [College] maintained a
good social atmosphere within an
academic setting." Patnode en
joyed official college social activities
three or four times a week. I le par
ticularly liked the off-campus
weekend trips such as backpacking
in the Sierra Nevada and open-sea
kayaking in Monterey Bay.
Patnode worked on the Forma
Urbis Romae Project an "attempt
to use computer algorithms to put
together an ancient, broken map of
the city of Rome."
Students engage in research
symposia where they receive feed
back on their projects as well as ad

vice from peer researchers.
Programs like the college and
URO grants aim to energize and
motivate students toward intellec
tual exploration. "The URP [office]
defines research as the process in
which a student acts not just as a
sponge soaking up knowledge, but
also as the creator of new knowl
edge". Selznick said. "The [office]
seeks to actively engage students to
shape the questions rather than
just seek answers."
Howard agrees. "Research is
very rewarding in that you feel like
you are adding to the general
wealth of knowledge as opposed to
just synthesizing what you read,"
she said.
The research experience can be
not only an academic challenge, but
also a process of personal growth.
"Doing research at the undergrad
uate level is an unforgettable, en
riching, and exciting experience. It
may not have given me the key to
what I want to do with my life, but I
now know there is so much more
that 1 can do," Jackson said.
Selznick is optimistic about the
future of research.at Stanford.
"The past points only to a better fu
ture — the [office] is expanding
and I am optimistic that in the fu
ture we will have more money and
more opportunities than ever be
fore," she said.

three quarters." - ®
In addition to its grants, the
URP is involved in promoting sev
eral new programs. According to
Selznick, "the [Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education's of lice]
has been involved in initiating an
other avenue of research through
faculty and departmental grants."
Rather than going directly through
the URP office, as in the case of
small and major grants, these
funds allow students to become in
volved in research directly through
their department.
Cultural and Social Anthropolo
gy major Portia Jackson, a senior,
was supported in her honors re
search by both a URQ minor grant
and a departmental public service
grant for field study.
According to Jackson, "the most
difficult part was convincing myself
that 1 could do the work. I had to
overcome the notion that my re
search had to be perfect, and focus
instead on finding a project that
was satisfying to me."
In the end, Jackson decided to
study African-American women
living with chronic Sarcoidosis, a
multi-system disorder character
ized in affected organs by a type of
inflammation called granulomas.
"The experience of getting to
know these women and their lives
has been absolutely phenomenal."
Jackson said. "In the past eight
months, they have become my in
spiration in several ways. I can't
describe to you the joy 1 feel in
being able to record their person
al stories."
The URP office oilers students
the opportunity of studying an im
portant issue or concern that they
are personally interested in.
"A research project can provide
an opportunity to be involved in the
discovery of knowledge on an issue
that matters to you," Selznick said.
Similarly, "research enables
you to feel ownership to your
studies and endows an incredible
sense of responsibility and com
mitment in what you are saying,"
according to Howard.
Faculty members apply for de
partmental grants through the
U RP and use the funds to support
student researchers who assist
them in their projects.
"With both of these opportuni
ties, students work closely with fac
ulty and are able to extend their

knowledge in a specialized field."
Selznick said.
Summer Research College is an
other URP-sponsored research op
portunity for Stanford undergrad
uates. In its third summer, the col
lege brings full-time student re
searchers together in a residential
environment.
"The college not only supplies
the opportunity for the pursuit of
research, but also provides a com
munity," Selznick said. "With the
Summer Research College, stu
dents are placed in a consciously
supportive and intellectual envi
ronment that prevents the isolation
that researchers often maintain."
According to Rene Patnode, a
senior majoring in computer sci
ence, "The [College] maintained a
good social atmosphere within an
academic setting." Patnode en
joyed official college social activities
three or four times a week. I le par
ticularly liked the off-campus
weekend trips such as backpacking
in the Sierra Nevada and open-sea
kayaking in Monterey Bay.
Patnode worked on the Forma
Urbis Romae Project an "attempt
to use computer algorithms to put
together an ancient, broken map of
the city of Rome."
Students engage in research
symposia where they receive feed
back on their projects as well as ad

vice from peer researchers.
Programs like the college and
URO grants aim to energize and
motivate students toward intellec
tual exploration. "The URP [office]
defines research as the process in
which a student acts not just as a
sponge soaking up knowledge, but
also as the creator of new knowl
edge". Selznick said. "The [office]
seeks to actively engage students to
shape the questions rather than
just seek answers."
Howard agrees. "Research is
very rewarding in that you feel like
you are adding to the general
wealth of knowledge as opposed to
just synthesizing what you read,"
she said.
The research experience can be
not only an academic challenge, but
also a process of personal growth.
"Doing research at the undergrad
uate level is an unforgettable, en
riching, and exciting experience. It
may not have given me the key to
what I want to do with my life, but I
now know there is so much more
that 1 can do," Jackson said.
Selznick is optimistic about the
future of research.at Stanford.
"The past points only to a better fu
ture — the [office] is expanding
and I am optimistic that in the fu
ture we will have more money and
more opportunities than ever be
fore," she said.
For many students, the idea of
research conjures up images of
long hours at a computer, churn
ing out page after page of a thesis.
However, thanks to funds from the
University's Undergraduate Re
search Programs, not all student
research has to be done behind a
desk.
The URP — formerly the Un
dergraduate Research Opportuni
ties office — sends techies and
fuz/ies alike on intellectual safaris
from East Palo Alto to East Asia.
Numerous grants assist students to
acquire the technical equipment,
travel experience, and faculty con
nections critical to high-quality
field research in their majors.
Senior Dana Howard is one of
the many students who have taken
advantage of the available research
funds. With the support of grant
funds, Howard spent two summers
researching in Israel where she
learned Arabic, researched avail
able educational programs and in
terviewed Palestinian teachers and
writers of textbooks.
Using this experience, Howard
has focused her senior honors the
sis in philosophy on civic education
in Israel and the treatment of mi
nority groups in the educational
system.
"Going to Israel really helped
me because I was able to get a solid
foundation on who the people are

and how their identities are shaped
by the educational system," she
said.
In the past few years Stanford's
research programs have expand
ed, allowing for greater opportuni
ty for intellectual exploration and
discovery. According to Laura
Selznick, associate director of Un
dergraduate Research Programs,
there is a new multitude of grant
programs now available to stu
dents.
"The [U RO office] was previous
ly a small office that offered only
grants and advising," Selznick ex
plained. "However, now the URO
has been changed to the URP, Un
dergraduate Research Programs,
providing new research opportuni
ties and services for students."
Within this new, expanded
structure the URP still offers tradi
tional small and major URO
grants. The major and minor
grants are the URP's oldest re
search program, dating back to
1985. ' v
The URP provides over 150
major URO grants and over 200
small grants to Stanford under
graduates each year.
"These grants support student
researchers in their independent
academic study and can be used for
transportation costs, research ma
terial and living expenses."
Selznick said.
"Small grants are won by stu
dents attempting shorter projects

and can be up to $500," Selznick
explained. "Major grants can ex
tend up to $3000 and student ap
plicants must have a project that
will extend over a minimum of
three quarters." - ®
