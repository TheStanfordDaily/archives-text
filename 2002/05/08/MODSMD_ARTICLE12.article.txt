## The 						Stanford Daily Dry parties belie idea that fun requires alcohol 
### 
Last month, UC-Berkeley adminis
trators announced an indefinite
moratorium on alcohol at Greek
parties a week before the fraterni
ty Acacia was to hold its annual "Night of the
Nile" party. The house had already spent
thousands of dollars on the party before the
moratorium began and decided to throw
the party as planned, but without alcohol.
The party was a fundraiser to help sexual
assault / rape support groups, and reported
a high attendance.
Kappa Sigma's Foam Party at Stanford
in March was a non-alcoholic gala as well,
and a successful one at that. We applaud
these Greek organizations for showing
their respective communities that alcohol

need not be the centerpiece of every colle
giate party.
While decisions to ban alcohol or place
groups on alcohol probation are always
controversial, these examples show that it is
better for an organization to come to terms
with its probation than to battle once a deci
sion has been handed down. The UC-
Berkeley moratorium affected its entire
Greek community, regardless of past
records of party-planning violations —
Acacia's record was incidentally quite good.
We admire these organizations' abilities to
continue serving their communities despite
the large constraints placed on them.
We also see the Kappa Sigma Foam Party
as an important landmark for Stanford in

that attendees were able to have fun inde
pendent of alcohol in a venue where drink
ing was likely the centerpiece of previous
parties. Stanford students, after a week of
working hard, look forward to a weekend of
playing hard. However, it is important for
students to recognize that alcohol need not
always be a part of that equation.
There are also some dry events on cam
pus during which alcohol should not be
served — Admit Weekend is a notable ex
ample. We hope students realize that a good
time at Stanford is not dependent on alcohol
and use these parties as examples of success
ful events they can reproduce in the future.
We recognize that a non-alcoholic party
will probably not be without intoxicated

partygoers, given that students can imbibe
before arriving at a party. One positive as
pect of not serving alcohol might be re
duced liability on the part of the fraternity
for drunken attendees. In a non-alcoholic
setting, it would be easier to hold people ac
countable for their over-consumption,
which would likely help a fraternity already
on shaky ground with the University.
We certainly do not advocate that Stan
ford become a dry campus, and we com
mend the Greek community for being
careful enough to avoid the type of major
review that is currently taking place at
Berkeley. Still, we feel that there is room for
improvement in recognizing the value of
dry social events.
