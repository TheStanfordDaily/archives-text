# RUNNING ON EMPTY
## Summer camp with beer 
### 
It's midterm week, and I'm feeling
pretty low. I have three exams and
a take-home test, 400 pages to read
by Friday and a research paper
that I should really start working on. 1
sleep only in brief snatches while waiting
for Socrates to download. From my study
carrel in Green Library, I can see the
clear blue sky of another beautiful spring
day that, sadly, I can't enjoy.
Oh, wait. That's not me. That's you.
I am lying in the sun reading a book
of my own choosing. I go to bed when
I'm tired and stay in my pajamas until
noon. I don't have homework. I don't
have worries.
I'm at Camp Stanford!
Camp Stanford is for seniors who
have finished classes and are squatting in

campus housing fora
quarter, thanks to the
benevolence of Housing
Assignment Services.
People writing a the
sis do not qualify. Thesis
writers spend their
spring at the Stanford
in-Hell program: a
wretched, miserable

netherworld that induces complete
mental paralysis and an unhealthy rela
tionship with one's laptop.
Camp Stanford is the happiest place
on earth. It is like summer camp, but
with beer. The total absence of lectures,
midterms, TAs, group projects and sec
tions provides a feeling of long-overdue
relief, like having an enormous zit for
four years and waking up one morning
to find it gone.
In contrast to the awful, life-suck
ing vacuum of senioritis that marked
winter quarter, spring at Camp Stan
ford is truly a time of rebirth. The sky
looks a little bluer and the flowers
bloom a bit brighter than they did
this time last year. Only two months
ago I was a listless shell of a human
being, unable to muster the energy
necessary for even the most basic
personal hygiene.
Now when I leave the house, the sim
ple joy of existence and the knowledge
that I will never, ever again have to fill
out a course evaluation form makes me
want to drop to my knees, throw my
hands to the sky and cry, "Dear God, I
want to live!"
I don't actually do this — too often.
Of course, the best part of Camp
Stanford is the social activities. Sure,
there is the part-time job and the occa
sional extracurricular commitment, but
for the most part, Camp Stanford con
sists of doing a lot of whatever the heck
you feel like.
You have time for all the fun you
missed when you were a student. Foot

ball on FloMo field? I'm there. Flicks?
Sign me up. Anyone want to spend a few
mindless hours passed out on the couch
in the lounge staring vacantly at the
Real World marathon? Yes. Yes, I do.
Membership at the Camp comes with
certain responsibilities, namely keeping
obnoxiously smug outbursts like the one
at the beginning of this column to a min
imum. Usually I am too afraid of retalia
tion to admit that I don't take classes.
When I hear people venting their
midterm stress, I freeze like a trapped
rabbit.
I know that if I so much as make eye
contact, they will notice my well-rested
ness and mutter a string of expletives
that would make me feel bad if I wasn't
having so much fun.
In addition, it is implicitly understood
that you will devote a decent chunk of
your time at Camp Stanford to looking
fora job. Job hunting is the Camp Stan
ford equivalent of latrine duty, without
the satisfaction of a clean toilet after
wards.
At the last career fair, I picked up sever
al full-color glossy brochures advertising
various careers in the State Department.
Without English classes to distract me, I
am stretching for anything to analyze.
If the diplomats in the State Depart
ment are as smart as their brochure de
signers, then we are in trouble.
The photos chosen to illustrate the
brochures are odd, in that it is not clear
how they make the State Department
look at in any way like a place you would
want to spend a single day of your ca
reer. In one, a man and a woman are
standing on opposite sides of a desk star
ing blankly at each other. It is not clear
which one of them is the civil service of
ficer, what they are doing or what the
photo has to do with anything at all.
A second picture shows a man in a suit
crossing the street in a nondescript city,
and another shows a slightly overweight,
unsmiling middle aged man in thick
glasses typing at a computer in a com
pletely beige room.
A government job in data entry with
opportunities for ass expansion? Where
do I sign?
Ironically, my time at Camp Stan
ford has made me nostalgic fora place
that in many ways I feel I have already
left. Is this the part where we talk
about stopping to smell the proverbial
flowers? Should I exhort you to make
more time for your friends? Is this
where we hug?
Nah. It's too nice out. I have some
lying around to do.

I'm at Camp Stanford!
Camp Stanford is for seniors who
have finished classes and are squatting in

campus housing fora
quarter, thanks to the
benevolence of Housing
Assignment Services.
People writing a the
sis do not qualify. Thesis
writers spend their
spring at the Stanford
in-Hell program: a
wretched, miserable

netherworld that induces complete
mental paralysis and an unhealthy rela
tionship with one's laptop.
Camp Stanford is the happiest place
on earth. It is like summer camp, but
with beer. The total absence of lectures,
midterms, TAs, group projects and sec
tions provides a feeling of long-overdue
relief, like having an enormous zit for
four years and waking up one morning
to find it gone.
In contrast to the awful, life-suck
ing vacuum of senioritis that marked
winter quarter, spring at Camp Stan
ford is truly a time of rebirth. The sky
looks a little bluer and the flowers
bloom a bit brighter than they did
this time last year. Only two months
ago I was a listless shell of a human
being, unable to muster the energy
necessary for even the most basic
personal hygiene.
Now when I leave the house, the sim
ple joy of existence and the knowledge
that I will never, ever again have to fill
out a course evaluation form makes me
want to drop to my knees, throw my
hands to the sky and cry, "Dear God, I
want to live!"
I don't actually do this — too often.
Of course, the best part of Camp
Stanford is the social activities. Sure,
there is the part-time job and the occa
sional extracurricular commitment, but
for the most part, Camp Stanford con
sists of doing a lot of whatever the heck
you feel like.
You have time for all the fun you
missed when you were a student. Foot

ball on FloMo field? I'm there. Flicks?
Sign me up. Anyone want to spend a few
mindless hours passed out on the couch
in the lounge staring vacantly at the
Real World marathon? Yes. Yes, I do.
Membership at the Camp comes with
certain responsibilities, namely keeping
obnoxiously smug outbursts like the one
at the beginning of this column to a min
imum. Usually I am too afraid of retalia
tion to admit that I don't take classes.
When I hear people venting their
midterm stress, I freeze like a trapped
rabbit.
I know that if I so much as make eye
contact, they will notice my well-rested
ness and mutter a string of expletives
that would make me feel bad if I wasn't
having so much fun.
In addition, it is implicitly understood
that you will devote a decent chunk of
your time at Camp Stanford to looking
fora job. Job hunting is the Camp Stan
ford equivalent of latrine duty, without
the satisfaction of a clean toilet after
wards.
At the last career fair, I picked up sever
al full-color glossy brochures advertising
various careers in the State Department.
Without English classes to distract me, I
am stretching for anything to analyze.
If the diplomats in the State Depart
ment are as smart as their brochure de
signers, then we are in trouble.
The photos chosen to illustrate the
brochures are odd, in that it is not clear
how they make the State Department
look at in any way like a place you would
want to spend a single day of your ca
reer. In one, a man and a woman are
standing on opposite sides of a desk star
ing blankly at each other. It is not clear
which one of them is the civil service of
ficer, what they are doing or what the
photo has to do with anything at all.
A second picture shows a man in a suit
crossing the street in a nondescript city,
and another shows a slightly overweight,
unsmiling middle aged man in thick
glasses typing at a computer in a com
pletely beige room.
A government job in data entry with
opportunities for ass expansion? Where
do I sign?
Ironically, my time at Camp Stan
ford has made me nostalgic fora place
that in many ways I feel I have already
left. Is this the part where we talk
about stopping to smell the proverbial
flowers? Should I exhort you to make
more time for your friends? Is this
where we hug?
Nah. It's too nice out. I have some
lying around to do.
