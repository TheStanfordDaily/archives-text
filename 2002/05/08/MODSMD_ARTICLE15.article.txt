Hinduism Awareness Week should
address ethnic violence in India
This is with reference to the "Hinduism
Awareness Week" that was inaugurated
yesterday by the Hindu Students Council.
While the attempt to spread awareness
about Hinduism within the campus com
munity is extremely laudable, I am dis
turbed about certain aspects of Hinduism
that the week chooses to highlight. Most
disconcerting is the organization of a talk
entitled "Hindus as Minorities."
The topic mentioned above is definitely a
valid one for discussion, but given the cur
rent political and civil climate in India,
where Hindus as the majority have been en
gaging in minority oppression, it must be
pointed out that it is an irresponsible deci
sion on part of the organizers to discuss such
a topic over other more pressing issues.
For the past, two months, the Muslim
minority in the state of Gujarat in Western
India has been facing state-sponsored
genocide. In the month of March, follow
ing a gruesome attack on Hindus in
Godhraby, Muslims, police and politician
led mobs attacked innocent Muslims in the
state of Gujarat. More than 2,000 Muslims
have been killed, with the active collusion
of the state machinery, and 100,000 are
living in overcrowded refugee camps ,
which the right wing Hindu government
is already threatening to dismantle.
The Hindu government at the center is
refusing to intervene meaningfully to pre
vent the continuing culpable acts of the
state government. This resurgence of the
I linclu militant nationalist ideology justifies
the killing of innocent minorities, using the
rhetoric of "Hindus as victims" and"I lin
dus as persecuted minorities." The use of
the same rhetoric in the organization ofthis
c lass is disturbing, to say the least.

This is not to undermine the truth of the
fact that Hindus have been persecuted in
states such as Bangladesh and Pakistan.
However, given the current political envi
ronment in India, it is disturbing to see
what appears like the ideology of the
Hindu right wing, being given preference
over other aspects of Hinduism. It is a mat
ter of grave concern to secular individuals
and practicing Hindus in the Stanford
community, that the Hindu Students
Council, in organizing its week for aware
ness about Hinduism, chooses to ignore
the great national tragedy that India is cur
rently experiencing as a result of the acts of
Hindu fanatics. More importantly, it ap
pears that by choosing to highlight a topic
that is usually part of the Hindu right-wing
rhetoric, the Hindu Students Council has
aligned itself with this ideology.
This distortion of reality by selectively
choosing to highlight the persecution of
Hindus as the minority community, over
the active genocide of Muslims currently
being orchestrated by Hindus in India, is
politically irresponsible in the context of
the increasing politic ization and militant
manifestation of Hinduism in India.

Dodd's portrayal of Hinduism Awareness
Week inaccurate
With regard to Maya Dodd's letter to
the editor in today's Daily, we are left be
wildered by her attack on Hinduism
Awareness Week. Apparently, our week of
events is a "grievous offense." We would
like to address this accusation and clarify
our standpoint.
( )ur week of events is an opportunity to

increase the awareness of Hindu culture
to the Stanford community. As anyone
who attends our events would observe, we
try to appeal to people of all religions and
backgrounds. As a group, our events —
e.g, Holi, Raas Garbha, which were cov
ered in earlier editions of The Daily this
year — have always drawn Stanford stu
dents from all backgrounds, whether it is
just to have fun, or whether it is to learn
about Hindu traditions.
The Hindu Students Council is not
meant to promote one perception of Hin
duism, given that among its members, and
its executive team, there are multiple view
points. In fact, as anyone who attended
Monday night's talk by Special Language
Program Lecturer Deven Patel would
know, there is a very large degree of diver
sity of opinion inherent in the Hindu tra
dition from its very incipient stages. The
diversity we attempt to embrace through
our forums speaks to this fact.
As for specific points brought up by
Dodd, we are truly confused as to how we
have erred by having a night of Indian clas
sical music in our Awareness Week. Clear
ly, the writer did not attend our event —
otherwise she would have known that our
performers explained exactly how Indian
classical music (particularly, the Carnatic
style) fits into Hindu culture with its roots
in the bhakti-devotion movement. It seems
as though Ms. Dodd opposes to having
Indian classical music correlated to
I lindu' culture —in a similar vein, would
Dodd oppose to us having Indian food at
one of our events, since we would then be
labeling it as "Hindu food"?
As another point, we were all very sur
prised about Dodd's point regarding the
violence in Gujarat. By having an event re
garding Hindus are minorities within the
diaspora, are we attempting to deny the ex
istence of a Hindu majority in India, or
deny violence committed by Hindus?
Clearly not. Had Dodd ever been to one of
our discussion forums, she would know
that there is ample room for debate. Most
importantly, the violence in Gujarat does
not make the issues of Hindus being perse
cuted around the world a non-issue. In
bringing up issues of Hindus as minorities,
we are not attempting to de-emphasize any
other acts of violence, but instead to try to
give light to a pattern of human rights vio
lations that are not often discussed.
As a more general point, the Hindu
Students Council will always face criticism
for bringing up any contentious issue, and
it will always be assumed that we are taking
sides since we are the ones bringing them
out. As a group, the Hindu Students

Council welcomes, and expects, construc
tive criticism. We want to involve people in
building an open forum, rather than ac
cusing people of holding beliefs contrary
to our own. We welcome the Stanford
community to attend our events. The
sheer amount of positive response from
members of the Stanford community with
regard to our events lets us know that dis
cussion of these issues is welcomed.

Unlimited access to athletic facilities unfair
As a recreational athlete on the Stan
ford campus, I would like to respond to
the May 7 column by Josh Sohn.
While 1 commend Sohn's attempt to
counter the "myth" that surrounds ath
letes at Stanford, 1 still find myself ex
tremely frustrated by one aspect of athlete
life that is not a myth. That is the fact that
they have access to all the athletic facilities
at Stanford whenever they are open.

I am one of those people that lias to ex
ercise in the morning because I simply
don't have time throughout the rest ofthe
day. If I ever need the equipment in Aril
laga at 7 a.m., then it's tough luck for me.
Why? Because the Arillaga Family Sports
Center exercise room is only open to ath
letes at that time. And, let's be honest, the
workout room in Tresidder Union
doesn't have nearly the same amount or
quality of equipment that Arillaga does.
That I am denied access to a facility which
I in part pay to keep up is unfair to me and
all other Stanford students who con
tribute just as much to this university as do
the athletes.

Athletic Dept. should publicize
dangers of tackling
I was deeply saddened to hear ofthe
death of Curtis Williams on Monday.
The former University of Washington

football player was paralyzed in October
of 2000 after making a head-on tackle
against junior running back Kerry
Carter here at Stanford.
I happened to see the accident in per
son, which was disturbing enough. Hut
even more troubling in my mind is the un
fortunate reality that neither Stanford nor
the University of Washington has used this
tragedy as an opportunity to speak pub
licly about the importance of safe tackling
techniques on t he football field.
As I've been told, the general rule
when making a hit in football is "heads
up". If you can see what you're hitting,
you can't direct the force ofthe hit straight
into the spine.
Unfortunately for Williams, he speared
his man head-on, and helmet to helmet.
Williams' spinal column was so highly
compressed on impact that one of his ver
tebra actually exploded.
Sadly, this style of hitting is common
amongst poorly coached players and
undisciplined teams at the high school and
college level. Yet despite the dangerous
consequences of improper tackling tech

niques, it is often encouraged by the
cheers of fans and media personalities who
simply don't know any better.
I was watching an old tape of a Wash
ington-UCLA game from 1999, when I saw
Williams make another dangerous head
first tackle. I he announcers said, "What a
fantastic play!" It made me sick to watch.
It's time for Stanford to take some ini
tiative and publicize the preventative na
ture of these types of spinal injuries. The
Athletics Department should collaborate
with orthopedic specialists to publicize a
set of specific recommendations aimed at
helping players avoid potentially danger
ous hitting techniques.
The publicity is the thing that is really
needed right now, especially with regard
to high school and youth coaches —so
that when the players get to college, they
know how to play safely.
If Williams can have only one lasting
legacy, let it be that the next generation of
football players be coached to prevent in
juries Hke his.
