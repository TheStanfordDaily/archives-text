## Ex-Card stars start WNBA play 
### TERRY HURLBUTT STAFF WRITER 
With tne WNBA pre-season
opening tomorrow, it would ap
pear that summer 110 longer be
longs just to the boys.
The Cardinal women are mak
ing their mark in the WNBA this
season, beginning with draft picks
Lindsey Yamasaki and Cori En
ghusen.
Both Yamasaki a guard, and En
ghusen a center have already de
parted Stanford to start pre-season
camp with their respective teams.
Yamasaki, the Cardinal's lead
ing scorer last season at 17.2 points
per game, was selected iti the sec
ond round by the Miami Sol while
Enghusen, one of the tallest players
in the country, was picked up in the
fourth round by the Houston
Comets.
"Our team was excited for I .ind
sey and Cori," said Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer. "We hope
they do well at their respective
camps."
Fellow seniors center Bethany
Donaphin and guard Enjoli Izidor
also reported to training camps and
Donaphin has since been placed on
the New York Liberty roster, allow
ing her to begin her professional ca
reer in her home suite.
Despite successful senior seasons
here on the Farm, the WNBA will
be like nothing these rookies have
faced before.
"The pro leagues are much
more physical," VanDerveer said.
"It is incredibly competitive at the
professional level and overall the
players are extremely athletic."
Enghusen finds herself in espe
cially elite company. The center will
be joining the ranks of well-known
talents Rebecca Lobo and Sheryl
Swoopes. In a delicious bit of irony,
Enghusen will find that one of her
main adversaries — Michelle
Snow from Tennessee — is now
her teammate.
The days of the two duking it out
in the paint during the annual Stan
ford-Tennessee matchups are, re
grettably, a thing of the past.
While the competition will be

fiercer, die Cardinal rookies can
take comfort in a long lineage of the
incredible post-collegiate success
enjoyed by fellow Stanford alumni.
The university currently has 12
former players on WNBA rosters in
an impressive display of the women
basketball program's achievements
over the past decade.
Stanford standouts guard Jen
nifer Az/.i and wing Kate Starbird
are teammates on the Utah Starzz.
Both players hold the distinction of
being the only Cardinal players to
win the prestigious Naismith
award, this year presented to the
draft's No. 1 pick guard Sue Bird.

Azzi helped pioneer profes
sional basketball in the United
States following an amazing sea
son on the 1996 gold-winning US
National team, coached by Van-
Derveer. She was one of the fore
mothers of the short-lived Amer
ican Basketball League and is a
standout in the WNBA.
Last season she was ranked first
in three-point percentage (.514),
second in minutes per game (37.7),
third in free-throw percentage
(.917) and fourth in assists per
game (5.3).

Former Cardinal guard Lindsey Yamasaki will begin her professional career
playing for the Miami Sol.
Sonja Henning and Charmin
Smith are Stanford alumni on the
Seattle Storm, a team that will ben
efit this season from a strong draft
selection that includes Bird and the
2000-2001 Pacific 10 Conference
Player of the Year, Felicia Ragland
from Oregon Suite.
Kristin Folkl and Vanessa Ny
gaard were Cardinal teammates
through 1998 and are reunited
with the Portland F ire. Folkl is a big
presence under the basket and was
ranked seventh last year in re
bounds pei' game averaging 7.7.
As though the accomplishments
on the court weren't enough, these

Cardinal women continue to dazzle
in the classroom as well.
Kate Paye, a member of the 1995
graduating class, currently holds
down the same two jobs she did as
an undergraduate. She is both a
player and a student. Paye plays for
the Minnesota Lynx during the sea
son and then rushes back to Palo
Alto where she attends the Law
School and the Stanford Graduate
School of Business.
Stanford women are making
a statement in their post-colle
giate careers.
"It's great to have so many play
ers involved in pro basketball,"
VanDerveer said. "I think it reflect§
directly on their talent and dedica
tion to the sport."
As Yamasaki, Enghusen, and
now Donaphin prepare to make

their own contributions, there are
many Cardinal players waiting in
the wings for their chance to dance.
However, unlike the guys, coach
VanDerveer can keep her lineup
stable, as the WNBA does not ac
cept players early.
"I'm just glad the rules don't
allow players to go early," Van-
Derveer said. "Nicole [Powell]
would have been a lottery pick.
We have several young players
who have a shot in the pros if that
is their goal."
After such a legacy of success in
collegiate and professional basket
ball, it seems that with dedication
and hard work there's nothing
these Cardinal women cannot ac
complish.
The boys aren't the only game in
town.
