# Treasuring Sunken Diamond
## 
### 
This is where the fun starts. Sure,
the first four months of the col
lege baseball season are fantastic.
But May brings it to a whole new
level, and June — well, let's not get ahead
of ourselves just yet.
The No. 7 Cardinal (33-13, 9-6 Pacific
10 Conference) sits in third place in the
Pac-10, one game behind Washington and
two behind league-leader Southern Cali
fornia, and that just won't do. At least not
fora program that's won the league four of
the last five years and knows Omaha about
as well as the employees at Zesto's.
With a schedule ranked among the na-

tion's five toughest and a
solid 24-7 non-confer
ence record, Stanford has
proven that, yet again, it
is among the country's
elite. But is it among the
top eight?
That, my friends, is the
question. This season
more than ever, being

among the eight national seeds in the
NCAA Tournament — and thereby
being assured of hosting both Regional
and Super Regional playoff games —
means everything to the Cardinal.
It doesn't take much to see that Stan
ford is a different team at home than it is
on the road. The Cardinal scores about
1.5 more runs per game at home than on
the road, and it allows almost one less.
That combination has led to a
sparkling 19-3 Sunken Diamond record,
as opposed to a 14-10 mark away from
Palo Alto.
Trust me when I say that it isn't a
raucous Stanford crowd that's made
the difference.
So what is it?
Last weekend's home sweep over Cali
fornia — the Cardinal's first since March
— is evidence enough of an unexplain
able but undeniable truth: Stanford sim
ply "has it" at Sunken.
In the immortal words of A1 Davis, they
"just win, baby" in one of the most scenic
ballparks in the land. They walk with a

swagger, they field with a flare and, more
often than not, they pull off the impossible.
"Impossible" may have been what
some were calling Stanford's conference
title chances after the Cardinal lost two of
three in consecutive weekends in the
Northwest against Washington and then
Oregon State. But last Friday it began its
true home stretch, playing nine of its last
14 games at Sunken, including nine of its
final 12 Pac-10 contests.
So the Cardinal's fate for staying at
home will be determined mostly at home.
The smart money seems to say that to war
rant a national seed from the selection
committee, Stanford needs at least a sec
ond-place finish in a league nationally
perceived as weak in 2002.
After last night's 13-2 non-conference
win over Santa Clara — and hoping a
barely .500 Washington team returns to
the form that preceded its recent winning
ways — that likely means at least an 8-2
record in the Cardinal's remaining 10
contests would translate into second place
in the Pac-10 and home field advantage
until the College World Series in Omaha.
It may sound tough, but it undoubtedly
can be done. Stanford faces teams with a
combined winning percentage of .473 the
rest of the way, and it should benefit from a
lac k of attractive teams on the West Coast
that could be considered top-eight material.
While it isn't a hard and fast rule that at
least one national seed must hail from west
of the Rockies, it certainly will merit the
committee's attention. The only other re
alistic candidates from the West, No. 15
Cal State-Northridge and No. 17 Cal
State-Fullerton, shouldn't pose a threat to
steal the Cardinal's spot among the top
eight if it can put together a strong finish.
In 2000, a veteran Stanford team re
sembling this season's squad went 10-2
clown the stretch. Last season, the Cardi
nal reeled off a 9-2 run to close out the reg
ular season after backbreaking consecu
tive Pac-10 series losses. With Sunken Di
amond so often in the Cardinal's May
2002 mix, don't be surprised if history re
peats itself.
