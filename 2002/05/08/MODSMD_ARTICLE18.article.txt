# Finally:
## Chris Lewis "officially" gains control 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN STAFF WRITER 
For many people, it is diffi
cult to learn a new language in
three quarters.
Stanford starting quarterback
Chris Lewis had four weeks.
"Coach [Buddy] Teevens was
saying that you come in as a fresh
man, and the offense is like Span
ish," Lewis said. "Now he is com
ing in and teaching Japanese.
Now 1 have to throw all this stuff
out, but I can still keep some of
this, and take a little of that. It's re
ally confusing sometimes, but I
think I have most of it down."
Lewis, along with the rest of
the Cardinal offense, had only
four weeks of spring practice be
fore the annual Cardinal and
White Spring Game.
The team doesn't have practice
again until camp opens in August.
With former head coach Ty
rone Willingham's departure
and the hiring of Teevens, the
offense had to learn an entirely
new scheme.
At the center of the new style
of play is Lewis, a junior, who as
quarterback must be the on
field leader.
"We have been throwing a lot
more in practice," said Lewis. "My
arm felt like it wanted to fall off
half way through spring ball be
cause we were throwing the ball so
much. We are taking longer de
veloping routes, with an emphasis
on looking deep first."
This is the first year that
Lewis will begin the season as
the team's starter. However, he
has had lots of game experience,
having started seven games in
the last two seasons.
"I feel real comfortable out
there," Lewis said. "Unfortu
nately, Randy got hurt a lot, but
at the same time that gave me a
lot of experience. I got a chance
to have everything fly around

me my freshman year, and then
everything kind of slowed down
last year. I can't wait to get into
this year."
Coming off the bench as a
freshman, Lewis led the Cardi
nal to three comeback victories.
Last year, his 3-1 record in
starting quarterback Randy
Fasani's absence was critical to
Stanford's success.
"The only thing that changes is
that the night before the game,
your stomachs a little tighter,"
Lewis said. "Not reallv nervous

about the game, just nervous about
performing well, making sure your
team wins. There is a little added
pressure, but I am all for it."
Unlike Fasani, Lewis is more of
a pocket passer, relying more on
his arm than his legs. Neverthe
less, Lewis is an all-around athlete,
playing volleyball in high school
and he was even on the Stanford
volleyball roster as a freshman.
"I take lessons 1 learn on the
volleyball court, and from a lot
