### DEBORAH SPLANSKY STAFF WRITER 
Tonight's doubleheader against San
Jose State (23-42) marks the beginning of
the end of the No. 8 Cardinal softball
team's regular season.
Stanford (40-16, 5-13 Pacific 10 Con
ference ) returns home from its last week
end on the road fora twin bill against the
Spartans, followed by its final Pac-10 se
ries this weekend against the Oregon
schools.
With post-season selection on the
horizon the Cardinal realizes that it must
win the remainder of its games to secure
a bid, and more importantly, to host a re
gional tournament.
The No. 8 Stanford team is currently
seventh in a conference of eight teams.
But when the conference also houses the
No. 1, No. 2, No. 4, No. 5 and No. 6
teams, it is not surprising that the nation
al softball community has become accus
tomed to almost the entire conference re
ceiving a post-season bid.
But the Stanford team must first
focus on tonight's agenda, the San Jose
Spartans.
The Cardinal enters the matchup
having revived its bats in Arizona with
a 4-for-4 performance by junior sec
ond baseman Kira Ching and a three
run home run by sophomore catcher
Jessica Allister.
Attempting to silence the hot Stanford
bats will be Carol Forbes and Brianne
Ferguson of the Spartans. Forbes and
Ferguson sport a combined ERA of 2.93
and a record of 22-39.
The two pitchers will meet a challenge
not only from Ching and Allister, but
from the entire Stanford lineup, which is
hitting a combined .273. The Cardinal
offensive is led by senior outfielder Jessi
ca Mendoza and first baseman Sarah
Beeson who are hitting .387 and .379, re
spectively.
Leading the pack for the Spartans is
Becca Baldridge, who boasts a .314 bat
ting average with 61 hits, 20 run and
seven doubles. Not far behind is Veroni
ca Ramos, who is currently hitting .298

with 51 hits, 14 doubles and 28 RBI.
However, as a team San Jose State is
averagingjust .228 with only three Spar
tans batting above the .250 mark.
The Cardinal will attempt to quell
the Spartan bats with juniors Fori Ny
berg and Maureen LeCocq leading the
way in the circle, and freshman Eliza
beth Bendig coming in to finish off the
job.

Nyherg and LeCocq have both
proven consistent on the rubber for the
Cardinal. This season both have received
Pac-10 Pitcher of the Week honors and
currently maintain winning records of
23-9 and lf>-7, respectively.
Both pitchers will work to continue
their success and the winning record of
the Stanford squad today at Smith Fam
ily Stadium at 2 p.m.
