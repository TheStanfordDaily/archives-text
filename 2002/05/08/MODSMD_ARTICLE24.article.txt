## 
### ASHLEY ENSIGN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Five Stanford synchronized swimmers
are catching their breath after a long week
end at the U.S. National Team trials held at
Ohio Suite University.
Senior Lindsey Wigginton, sophomores
Erin Dobratz, Jen Kiblerand Katie Norris,
and freshman Sheila Sadovnik competed
in the third and final phase of team trials,
which determined the members of the U.S.
National Teams I and 11.
Trials are a lengthy process, which
began at U.S. Nationals last year and pro
gressed through several phases this year.
Phase II occurred last month in Oxford,
Ohio when the athletes were tested on their
performance of eight technical elements.
Qualifying for phase 111 was a feat in
itself, as only 38 out of hundreds of syn
chronized swimmers make it this far.
Stanford was well-represented with five
athletes chosen.
In phase 111 of trials, the athletes
swim a specified preset routine in
groups of three before a panel of 13
judges. Each athlete swam the routine
twice last Friday and Saturday, and the
judges determined the national team
members based on their performances.
"Phase 111 is the hardest part of trials,"

said Norris. "In comparison to previous
years, the routine this year was exception
ally strenuous because it pieced together
the most difficult parts of routines from
other countries."
Trials are not only physically taxing, but
also mentally exhausting.
"Swimming the routine requires ex
treme concentration and focus," said
Norris. "1 wanted to make sure I was
doing everything exactly on count, to
the best of my ability, and better than
everyone else."
Dobratz and Norris qualified for Team
I, a 12-member team coached by Chris
Carver, the U.S. Olympic team coach. The
team will represent the United States at the
2002 FINA World Cup, held Sept. 12 to
Sept. 15 in Zurich, Switzerland.
Team I is a young team, with the
members averaging 20 years of age.
However, despite its young age, the
members of the team are not rookies.
Most of the athletes have had more than
12 years of competition experience and
eight of the members have been on
Team I in previous years.
Dobratz has been on a national team five
times throughout her career, but this is her
first time on Team I. Norris is no stranger
to the national team either. She has been
appointed to a national team four times

and this is her second appointment to
Team I.
Also qualifying to join U.S. National
Team II were Wigginton and Sadovnik.
Linda Witter, the head coach lor Ohio State
will coach Team II this summer. She will
take the team to compete at the 27th Swiss
Open in Basel, Switzerland from ] uly 11 to
July 14.
Wigginton is a regular to the national
team scene, as this is her seventh appoint
ment. Sadovnik, however, will join a na
tional team for the first time. Her goal this
year has been to make one of the teams and
she was ecstatic to earn a spot.
"I can't believe I actually did it,"
Sadovnik said. "I keep thinking someone's
going to grab me by the shoulders and say,
'just kidding.' I am so thrilled. It's definite
ly one of the best things that has ever hap
pened to me."
Training for the national teams will
begin in early June and intensify through
out the summer. Team II has ynly one
month to train in Colorado before its com
petition in July, and Team I will train fora
full three months in Santa Clara before
leaving for competition.
Unlike many other students, Dobratz,
Norris, Sadovnik, and Wigginton won't be
playing in the pool this summer; they'll be
working hard.
