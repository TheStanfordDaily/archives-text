# Housing changes may impact Draw
## 
### ELIZABETH MADJLESSI STAFF WRITER 
With the closing of Branner for
the 2002-03 academic year and
housing choices required this Sun
day, both freshmen and upper
classmen housing distributions
this year's undergraduate housing
Draw could be unlike any other.
To start, 50 Mirrielees doubles
will be converted to triples this
summer; 100 rooms were convert
ed last summer. The student
apartments have already been
renovated to upgrade their facili
ties and seismically strengthen the
building.
Other changes students can an
ticipate include the conversion of
Soto to an all-freshman residence
and an increase in the number of
freshmen who will be assigned to
four-class residences, such as those
in Stern and Wilbur, as well as
Roble.
"We are also keeping as stu
dent rooms some of the common
spaces — study rooms, game
rooms, etc. — that were con
verted to student housing last
year and this year," said Todd
Benson, director of Housing As
signment Services.
"We've undertaken a project
designed to make sure that the
configuration of rooms was equi
table across the system," Benson

said. Benson said that in the past,
rooms that were configured as
doubles in one building were con
figured as triples in others.
"We have identified about (50
extra spaces, including some on
the Row and some in non-Row res
idences, which will be added to the
system next year," Benson said.
All freshmen will continue to be
housed on campus, although a
slightly larger number will be
housed in four-class residences
than in previous years.
Oak Creek and Sharon Green
apartments will continue to be off
campus living options for under
graduates next year.
Among students, there is still
some resentment towards certain
types of housing and worry about
competition.
"I can't expect anything based
on old Draw statistics," said sopho
more Steven Guilliams. "With
Branner's closure, more upper
classmen will be squeezed into
broom closets and Mirrielees.
With more Row houses going pri
ority and Greek, more people with
prime Draw numbers will be com
peting for the remaining sought
after houses."

had a small number of additional
spaces added to ensure equity

The Row's Mars and 557 are both hot Draw commodities. Because of
changes in next year's housing, some students worry that their Draw
prospects this year could be grim.
