# Housing changes may impact Draw
## 
### ELIZABETH MADJLESSI STAFF WRITER 
With the closing of Branner for
the 2002-03 academic year and
housing choices required this Sun
day, both freshmen and upper
classmen housing distributions
this year's undergraduate housing
Draw could be unlike any other.
To start, 50 Mirrielees doubles
will be converted to triples this
summer; 100 rooms were convert
ed last summer. The student
apartments have already been
renovated to upgrade their facili
ties and seismically strengthen the
building.
Other changes students can an
ticipate include the conversion of
Soto to an all-freshman residence
and an increase in the number of
freshmen who will be assigned to
four-class residences, such as those
in Stern and Wilbur, as well as
Roble.
"We are also keeping as stu
dent rooms some of the common
spaces — study rooms, game
rooms, etc. — that were con
verted to student housing last
year and this year," said Todd
Benson, director of Housing As
signment Services.
"We've undertaken a project
designed to make sure that the
configuration of rooms was equi
table across the system," Benson

said. Benson said that in the past,
rooms that were configured as
doubles in one building were con
figured as triples in others.
"We have identified about (50
extra spaces, including some on
the Row and some in non-Row res
idences, which will be added to the
system next year," Benson said.
All freshmen will continue to be
housed on campus, although a
slightly larger number will be
housed in four-class residences
than in previous years.
Oak Creek and Sharon Green
apartments will continue to be off
campus living options for under
graduates next year.
Among students, there is still
some resentment towards certain
types of housing and worry about
competition.
"I can't expect anything based
on old Draw statistics," said sopho
more Steven Guilliams. "With
Branner's closure, more upper
classmen will be squeezed into
broom closets and Mirrielees.
With more Row houses going pri
ority and Greek, more people with
prime Draw numbers will be com
peting for the remaining sought
after houses."

had a small number of additional
spaces added to ensure equity

The Row's Mars and 557 are both hot Draw commodities. Because of
changes in next year's housing, some students worry that their Draw
prospects this year could be grim.
across the system.
Row house stall are confident
that their houses will draw high
numbers nonetheless.
"We haven't heard yet how
many more people we may have
living in Hob next year due to the
housing crunch, but we aren't
worried," said junior Roy
Simkhay, house manager for Bob
next year. "It's going to be a great
place to live no matter what."
"I'm against any further houses
becoming theme or Greek," Guil
liams said. "Some people like to be
involved in a house theme, and
that's fine, but others spend their
time with extracurriculars for
which they can't get any priorities,
and I would hate to see people like
that end up relegated to the far
edges of campus because their
choice of activity doesn't lit into
one of the requirements for living
on the Row."
Greeks are impacted by the
housing crunch as well.
l 'l think that the overflow has
put pressure on Greek housing,"
said junior Steph Cheung, the
house manager at the Delta Delta
Delta house next year. "We have

the issues of filling our house, in
addition to dealing with our Uni
versity cap and quota. This year's
Recruitment had to take our new
housing capacity into account and
while the University gave us the
option of taking boarders next
year to fill the two new spots
[added by University housing of
ficials]; I'm proud to say that our
house will only be filled with Tri
Deltas."
The University has not yet de
cided exactly which changes will
be permanent. "Next year we're
going to be reviewing all of the ef
forts to deal with the undergrad
housing crunch thus far, in antici
pation of Branner coming back
on-line in 2003-04," Benson said.
"As part of that review we'll try to
determine if it makes most sense to
return some of the common spaces
that have been converted to stu
dent housing in the past few years
back to common spaces, or to see if
we should look at some of the
rooms that have been uprated this
year, or both."
Benson said that Housing As
signment Services' goal will be to
reduce the total number of spaces
in the system. He added that Oak
Creek and Sharon Green may no
longer be offered as residence op
tions for undergraduates after
next year.
