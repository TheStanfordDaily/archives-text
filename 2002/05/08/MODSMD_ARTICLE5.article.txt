# Phone towers to be ready
## 
### CYNTHIA CHO EDITORIAL STAFF 
In the third and final phase of a $1.3 mil
lion project to enhance campus security, 27
of Stanford's HO emergency phone towers
will be ready for use for the first time during
the week of May 13. These 27 towers, cur
rently labeled "out of service," have not
been activated since they were installed.
"In response to a report on safety per
ceptions presented by the ASSU in 1998,
[Provost John fc'.tchemendy] provided the

funding to install these towers to enhance
security on campus," said Lt. Del Bandy of
the Stanford Police.
"The initial phase installed towers along
the routes onto campus. The second phase
installed phones around the student living
areas. I lie third phase installed phones
through the academic core of the campus,"
he said.
The towers are located throughout the
campus, along suggested travel routes,

Next week, all 80 of Stanford's emergency phone towers will be activated and ready for
use, according to the Stanford Police.

and Security Almanac, distributed

each year.
"The towers are positioned along
primary pedestrian and bicycle
routes and are spaced so that [typi
cally! as a person leaves the area of
one tower, [he or she] approaches
another tower," Bandy said.
When a call is made from one of
these towers, it reaches the dispatch

center at the Palo Alto Police De
partment, like a regular 911 call.
Depending on the situation, fire,
medical or police personnel are dis
patched to the tower from which the
call was made.
Once a call is placed using one of
the towers, the exact location of the
scene of the emergency can be pin
pointed. Also, when one of the tow
ers is used to make a call, the blue
strobe light feature is activated,
which is intended to scare away any
perpetrators.
The Stanford Police have a con
tract with the Palo Alto Police Dept.
to handle these phone calls. A

phone call is treated as a primary call
and a response typically takes about
a minute.
I n the event of an emergency,
the advantage of using one of the
towers instead of a cell phone is
that the towers are a direct line to
the dispatchers. When a cell phone
is used, the call first reaches high
way patrol.
"Using the towers to report
crimes in progress [allows people
to] bypass [the] highway patrol
who have to determine who to
contact. The towers are a lot more
efficient because it puts you in di
rect contact with a dispatcher,"

said Sgt. David Lee of the Stan
ford Police. He encouraged stu
dents to take advantage of the
towers in case of emergency.
On average, two or three emer
gency calls are placed using the tow
ers each month. Usually, the kinds
of" calls are related to collisions or
theft. However, there have been a
few cases of sexual assault reported
using these towers as well.
Earlier this year, the former Po
lice Chief Marvin Herrington, said
that because Stanford's campus is so
large and is continually expanding,
it is difficult to cover the entire cam
pus so that from each and every

tower the next one is visible.
However, the installation of these
emergency phone towers is an on
going plan and more towers will be
added in the future. Herrington ex
pects that live,to 10 towers will be
added every two years.
The towers are tested once a
week by the Department of Public
Safety. The installation, activation
and maintenance of the emergency
phone towers are "the building
blocks fora safer campus," said Her
rington. "Within the next two
weeks, all 80 towers on campus are
scheduled to be up and running,"
he said.
