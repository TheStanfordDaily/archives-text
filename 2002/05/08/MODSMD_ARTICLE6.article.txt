# Berkeley bans alcohol at Greek parties
## 
### ALI ALEMOZAFAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
UC-Berkeley campus officials issued a
moratorium last week on the use of alcohol
at all fraternity and sorority house parties.
Hie measure was in light of the recent vio
lations of stringent rules on alcohol and in
juries caused by drunkenness.
Several incidents — including one in
which an intoxicated female student fell
and suffered a concussion — led to the
stringent ban, said UC-Berkeley Dean of
Students Karen Kenney in the San Fran
cisco Chronicle.
Fhis individual was treated and is now
"fine," said campus spokeswoman Janet
Gilmore.
The moratorium applies to the 34 fra
ternities and 13 sororities and is effective
immediately. It will not be lifted until a bet
ter system for regulating alcohol consump
tion is in place, Kenney said.
Days of keg parties, which fell victim
largely to fraternity insurance policies and
fears of date-rape drugs, are ancient history.
Hie moratorium does not prevent stu
dents of legal age from drinking when they

are alone at home at the fraternities and
sororities, nor does it apply to smaller gat 11-
erings or off-campus events.
Stanford Dean of Students Marc YVais
said that Berkeley's decision may have
little direct correlation with Stanford's
policies.
"Berkeley's actions underscore that in
stitution's concern for the health and safety
of its students and potential liability expo
sure for the university," he said. "General
ly, our past practice has been to hold indi
viduals and individual organizations ac
countable and responsible for their own
behavior."
Some Berkeley students expressed con
cern that the ban would be counterpro
ductive.
"Although 1 understand the principles
behind the administration's decision to
implement the moratorium, I do not
think that the goal to increase accountabil
ity and safety in the community will be
achieved," said Berkeley freshman Marisa
San Filippo.
"If the moratorium is continued in the
fall, 1 feel that fraternities and sororities
will experience a decline iti recruitment,

and the Greek system as a whole will suffer
as the target of the legislation," San Filippo
continued. "The moratorium has already
resulted in an increase in binge drinking
in fraternities outside the party atmos
phere, and students have dec ided to show
up to social events already intoxicated,
posing more problems for security and the
fraternity hosting the party."
Berkeley freshman Nick Dreher shared
the sentiment that a complete ban on alco
hol consumption would not be completely
satisfactory, but he did recognize the bene
fits of a moratorium.
"I guess going dry would improve the
nature of our campus, but it would be pret
ty weak," Dreher said. "I was pretty
shocked, but I guess if this campus had less
alcoholics it wouldn't be a bad thing."
San Filippo hoped the UC-Berkeley ad
ministration will review the ban more care
fully.
"1 hope that the administration will re
consider the consequences of their decision
and enact a more progressive policy in the
fall," she said.
