# New prize supports emerging authors
## $12,500 Saroyan Writing Prize will be awarded every two years 
### SARAH PAPÉ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A new literary prize that gives recogni
tion to newly published authors will be
handed out next year. Instead of honoring
established authors, The William Saroyan
International Prize for Writing hopes to
encourage emerging authors who often
find it difficult to receive recognition.
"It's always easier — though also valu
able — to give a prize fora career or an
established reputation," said English Prof.
Eavan Boland, a judge lot the prize. "But
to celebrate a new voice is always at the cut
ting edge of the process of recognition."
The entries must be works of fiction —
novels, short stories or dramas — first
published in book form in 2002 and avail
able for purchase. The winner will receive
an award of $12,500, which will be an
nounced publicly at a ceremony in the

spring of 2003. The prize will lie given
once every two years.
Fhe prize is named for William Saroy
an, a native Californian writer and play
wright best known for his writings about
immigrant families and children in Cali
fornia. As the son of Armenian immi
grants, Saroyan knew all about that
lifestyle and used his experiences to rise to
literary prominence. Saroyan won a
Pulitzer Prize for his drama, "The Time of
Your I .ife," and an Academy Award for his
work on the film " Hie 1 lunian Comedy."
In 1990, the William Saroyan Founda
tion decided to archive all of Saroyan's
work in one location and offered Stanford
the opportunity to house the Saroyan I it
eraiy Collection. I he Stanford Libraries
have teamed up with the foundation to
award this prize, honoring the lile and
legacy of Saroyan.
"This prize brings together some new
and existing elements — Saroyan's
name and the presence of Stanford and
the recognition of new voices," Boland
said. "That's a very powerful mix."
Entries will lx* judged by a panel of
three writers, including Boland, who was

asked to be a judge by University Librari
an Michael Keller.
"I thought it wasa very innovative,gen
erous and exciting project, both for the
honor it does to William Saroyan and for
the way it joins his name to the encourage
ment of contemporary writers," Boland
said.
Boland has published eight volumes of
poetry and has been a writer in residence
at Trinity College and University College
in Dublin. While at Stanford, Boland was
the director of the Creative Writing Pro
gram from 1995 to 2000.
Stina Katchadourian, a translator and
author, will also judge the competition.
Katchadourian writes fiction, memoirs,
history and poetry. Fhe third judge is
1 lank Saroyan, the nephew of William
Saroyan. I lank Saroyan is a two-time
Finmy-Award-winning writer, producer
and director. One of the Fmmys he won
was for his work on a film adaptation of a
short stoiy by his uncle.
