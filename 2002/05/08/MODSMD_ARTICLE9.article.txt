For those planning to off-road

ty. It's easy to read, has a simple
compass-calibration process and
comes with an adjustable nylon

mirror. The compass not only in

Royal Philips Electronics has devel
oped a way of painting liquid crystal
displays onto almost any kind of sur
face: walls, plastic sheets, and even
clothing. The Philips technique,
called "photo-enforced stratifica
tion," paints a liquid crystal and
polymer mixture onto a surface,
and then exposes this surface to two
doses of ultraviolet radiation. The
radiation separates the mixture into
a honeycomb of small individual
cells covered by flexible, see
through polymer. When connected
to a computer, the crystal-filled cells
can change color to create a picture,
like any standard LCD. Philips is

one of several companies that have
committed to work toward light
weight, flexible screens.
Many notebook owners have
learned to use little touchpads in
place of mice. However, a compa
ny called Finger Works is now also
using large touchpads in place of
keyboards. Instead of traditional
keys, Finger Works touchpads
have silk-screened diagrams rep
resenting keyboards. You simply
touch the area marked "Space",
"Enter", or "8", for example.

Dropping two lingers anywhere
on the pad, is interpreted as a
mouse movement. Likewise, the
system recognizes three lingers as
a double-click, and two lingers and
a thumb as a right-click. The com
pany claims this light-touch ap
proach will decrease stress on your
fingers. The IGesture pad, a com
bination mouse and number pad
version retail fora total of $189.
