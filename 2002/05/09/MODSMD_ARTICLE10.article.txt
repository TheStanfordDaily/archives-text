## The 						Stanford Daily Emergency phone tower activation long overdue 
### 
Published Since 1891

We are pleased that within the
next two weeks, all 80 of Stan
ford's emergency phone tow
ers will be fully operational.
This represents a substantial expansion,
including 27 new towers, which will dra
matically improve safety around campus.
The placement of these towers was deter
mined by campus traffic patterns. As such,
students walking in frequently used areas of
campus at night will feel — and will actually
be — safer.
While we are happy that these towers
will be functioning beginning next week,
we are concerned that it has taken so long
to activate them. "Out of Service" signs

covering emergency push-buttons have be
come all too common around campus. This
situation creates images more akin to those
viewed in an Alfred Hitchcock horror film
than those of the pastoral campus.
The ostensible reason for the long peri
od for which the towers were "Out of Ser
vice" is that they must be tested extensive
ly before being put into service. While we
believe strongly that testing these emer
gency phones is important, the testing
should have been carried out more quick
ly. In essence, the emergency phone towers
are just what their middle name says:
phones. It should not take months to test a
simple phone.

There is no definitive way to know if one
of these "Out of Service" towers have left
anyone stranded with no way to turn for
help, but we believe that it was irresponsi
ble to leave them unactivated for such a
long time. No tower might be better than a
malfunctioning tower, which creates the il
lusion that help might be on the way.
Admittedly, there are other safety pre
cautions on campus. 5-SURE — the cam
pus organization that operates golf carts to
drive people who feel threatened from one
location to another — is a group that can
stop crimes before they happen. And the
high rate of cell-phone ownership on cam
pus allows many students to contact the po-

lice on their own.
But neither of these solutions fills the
place of fully operational emergency
phone towers. Cell phones do not put their
users in direct contact with a local police
dispatcher, and 5-SURE cannot help after
one has already made the decision to walk.
Crimes and other emergencies do happen
at Stanford.
It is important that students be able to
contact the police, fire department or
paramedics in a safe and expedient manner.
The coming activation represents an impor
tant step in this direction, but we hope that
in the future These expansions do not take
so long to accomplish.
