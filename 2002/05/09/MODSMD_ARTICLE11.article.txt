# CANNONBALL COMING
## Golfing with grandpa 
### 
G ramps is coming to dinner
tonight. Break out the scotch.
You read a lot about the prod
ucts of broken homes feeling
awkward and angry when a previously un
involved parent re-enters their life and
tries to become best friends. Strangely, I
often felt that way about my grandfather.
My mother's parents divorced when
she was growing up, and later my grand
father, living in Southeast Asia while work
ing for Bechtel Construction Co., married
a Thai woman. Apart from a short stint in
Houston and Venezuela, they have lived
in Asia ever since.
When 1 was growing up, I saw him
maybe three times. One day here, another

there, maybe a third a few
years later. He called me
Scooter and addressed
birthday cards to John, a
big no-no in my family:
During my freshman
year, my dad called my
room asking for me. My
roommate said, "Yeah,
I'll get Jon." My dad

replied testily, "I'm not looking for Jon.
I'm looking for Jonathan." That one still
gets the friends laughing all the time.
But since my grandfather brought his
polyester pants, snappy wide-collared golf
shirts, tasseled white penny loafers and a
love for prime rib to Virginia for three
days at the end of my freshman year of
high school, he's wanted a much more in
volved relationship.
Especially after I pic ked up golf at his
urging, got a little older and more "expe
rienced" and began to hoist a mug every
so often, he's wanted to hang out, talk and
exchange letters all the time. Two weeks
don't go by without an e-mailed missive
fired off from Bangkok requesting news
about what's going on in my life. Even
after I told him that all of my days consist
ed simply of eating, drinking, reading,
eating, sleeping and browsing the Web. he
still wanted updates. Grandpa, I'm still
here, sitting at my desk, long and to the
left. Nothing's changed.
And considering how involved my
other grandparents had been, how much
I'd seen them, how often they called, how
interested they had, been in my life, his
Wayne-come-lately act seemed a little out
of place.
But then, all of a sudden, it didn't.
Instead, getting to know my grandfa
ther seemed like getting to know myself.
At least the other half.
Above all, I'm a product of where I've
grown up and the immediate family I've
grown up with. But, one's heritage cannot
be discounted. Whether it's because he ob
viously had a great influence on my moth

er and, naturally, on how she raised me or
because his genetic stamp has been passed
down to me by the miracle of conception,
getting to know my grandfather has (if you
allow me a bit of maudlin sentimentality)
given me a window on my soul.
Now, some of it's not so pretty. He
sends some of the worst jokes ever over
e-mail. I cringed and chuckled embar
rassingly after reading one, about the
sexual activities of a flabby old woman.
When 1 saw my sister's email address also
on the e-mail, I blanched. Sending dirty
e-mails to your granddaughter? Inter
esting form.
And, in the last few months, he's sent
messages strenuously advocating both for
new legislation enforcing a strict, uniform
singing of the national anthem, somehow
meant to encourage increased singing of
the song by limiting the creative possibili
ties, and advocating against any person or
policy that pander to immigrants.
This is coming from a man who has
lived most of his adult life as an expatriate
in Southeast Asia, saying that "once you
are done complaining, whining, and grip
ing about our flag, our pledge, our na
tional motto, or our way of life, I highly en
courage you to take advantage of one
other great American freedom: the right
to leave!" It seems a little disingenuous.
Especially coming from a man who has
lived in Thailand fora few decades and
still can't talk Thai.
But most of it's wonderful. His easy
laugh, the twinkle in his eye, the way he hit
on my aunt's MILF-like friends at her re
cent wedding. You can't help but smile.
Let's face it, my grandpa's a stud.
He's over 50 years older than I am, but
when he comes to dinner tonight, we'll
gab on like a gaggle of old women about
golf, Guinness and girls — in that order.
He doesn't much care about what I'm
studying in school. My now-extinguished
thesis was always a conversation-killer. But
he cares about how I'm enjoying life, and
he's not afraid to give me a hard time. And
having that kind of balance is important.
So when I go to pick up the old man for
a nice BBQ dinner at my sister's tonight,
I'll go with a smile on my face and satisfac
tion in my heart. He may not have been
the persistent, loving presence in my life
that my other grandparents have been,
but just being with him makes me feel
more in touch with myself and with my
family and with how everything interacts
to make me who I am.
And of course he'll slip me a few fresh
bills. Like any good grandfather should.

on my aunt's MILF-like friends at her re
cent wedding. You can't help but smile.
Let's face it, my grandpa's a stud.
He's over 50 years older than I am, but
when he comes to dinner tonight, we'll
gab on like a gaggle of old women about
golf, Guinness and girls — in that order.
He doesn't much care about what I'm
studying in school. My now-extinguished
thesis was always a conversation-killer. But
he cares about how I'm enjoying life, and
he's not afraid to give me a hard time. And
having that kind of balance is important.
So when I go to pick up the old man for
a nice BBQ dinner at my sister's tonight,
I'll go with a smile on my face and satisfac
tion in my heart. He may not have been
the persistent, loving presence in my life
that my other grandparents have been,
but just being with him makes me feel
more in touch with myself and with my
family and with how everything interacts
to make me who I am.
And of course he'll slip me a few fresh
bills. Like any good grandfather should.

G ramps is coming to dinner
tonight. Break out the scotch.
You read a lot about the prod
ucts of broken homes feeling
awkward and angry when a previously un
involved parent re-enters their life and
tries to become best friends. Strangely, I
often felt that way about my grandfather.
My mother's parents divorced when
she was growing up, and later my grand
father, living in Southeast Asia while work
ing for Bechtel Construction Co., married
a Thai woman. Apart from a short stint in
Houston and Venezuela, they have lived
in Asia ever since.
When 1 was growing up, I saw him
maybe three times. One day here, another

there, maybe a third a few
years later. He called me
Scooter and addressed
birthday cards to John, a
big no-no in my family:
During my freshman
year, my dad called my
room asking for me. My
roommate said, "Yeah,
I'll get Jon." My dad

replied testily, "I'm not looking for Jon.
I'm looking for Jonathan." That one still
gets the friends laughing all the time.
But since my grandfather brought his
polyester pants, snappy wide-collared golf
shirts, tasseled white penny loafers and a
love for prime rib to Virginia for three
days at the end of my freshman year of
high school, he's wanted a much more in
volved relationship.
Especially after I pic ked up golf at his
urging, got a little older and more "expe
rienced" and began to hoist a mug every
so often, he's wanted to hang out, talk and
exchange letters all the time. Two weeks
don't go by without an e-mailed missive
fired off from Bangkok requesting news
about what's going on in my life. Even
after I told him that all of my days consist
ed simply of eating, drinking, reading,
eating, sleeping and browsing the Web. he
still wanted updates. Grandpa, I'm still
here, sitting at my desk, long and to the
left. Nothing's changed.
And considering how involved my
other grandparents had been, how much
I'd seen them, how often they called, how
interested they had, been in my life, his
Wayne-come-lately act seemed a little out
of place.
But then, all of a sudden, it didn't.
Instead, getting to know my grandfa
ther seemed like getting to know myself.
At least the other half.
Above all, I'm a product of where I've
grown up and the immediate family I've
grown up with. But, one's heritage cannot
be discounted. Whether it's because he ob
viously had a great influence on my moth

er and, naturally, on how she raised me or
because his genetic stamp has been passed
down to me by the miracle of conception,
getting to know my grandfather has (if you
allow me a bit of maudlin sentimentality)
given me a window on my soul.
Now, some of it's not so pretty. He
sends some of the worst jokes ever over
e-mail. I cringed and chuckled embar
rassingly after reading one, about the
sexual activities of a flabby old woman.
When 1 saw my sister's email address also
on the e-mail, I blanched. Sending dirty
e-mails to your granddaughter? Inter
esting form.
And, in the last few months, he's sent
messages strenuously advocating both for
new legislation enforcing a strict, uniform
singing of the national anthem, somehow
meant to encourage increased singing of
the song by limiting the creative possibili
ties, and advocating against any person or
policy that pander to immigrants.
This is coming from a man who has
lived most of his adult life as an expatriate
in Southeast Asia, saying that "once you
are done complaining, whining, and grip
ing about our flag, our pledge, our na
tional motto, or our way of life, I highly en
courage you to take advantage of one
other great American freedom: the right
to leave!" It seems a little disingenuous.
Especially coming from a man who has
lived in Thailand fora few decades and
still can't talk Thai.
But most of it's wonderful. His easy
laugh, the twinkle in his eye, the way he hit
on my aunt's MILF-like friends at her re
cent wedding. You can't help but smile.
