Musicians respond to Dodd
As two of the performers in the perfor
mance which Maya Dodd refers to in her
letter "Hindu Student Council creates in
accurate potrayal," we are compelled to
respond to her misplaced indignation
and basic misreading of our purpose in
playing for Hinduism Awareness Week.
Maya Dodd in here letter wrote "What
do the coordinators hope to achieve by
characterizing 'Indian Classical Music' as
Hindu?" To acknowledge the connection
between Hinduism and Indian art music
is not to appropriate it.
If we celebrate Jazz within the context
of Black History Month, we don't claim ii
exclusively. An acknowledgement of the
intimate connection between black Amer
ica and jazz does not exclude the impact
of European and white American musical
thought. Likewise, our performance was
a celebration and recognition of the inter
relation of two cultures which have pro
foundly influenced each other.
T he roots of Indian art music lie in re
gional folk melodies and devotional
songs. The vast majority of these devo
tional songs were Hindu devotional
songs, inspired by I he myths, deities and
philosophies underlying Hinduism. The
vast repertoire of South Indian Classical
music is, to this day, almost entirely de
votional. Textual references to Hindu
gods and legends are übiquitous in Indi
an art music.
Beyond the textual and representa
tional connections, Indian art music is
deeply connected to Hindu philosophies
and yogic practices. The deeply intro
spective nature of raga music is connect
ed to the meditative practice which un
derlies Hindu philosophy. Hinduism

has. likewise adopted music in radically
forward ways.
There is a saying, nada brahma,
meaning roughly that sound is god, the
universal soul. Music is not just a means
of representing the divine but is divine;
ihe practice of music becomes a path to
wards enlightenment.
All this in no way diminishes the im
pact of other cultures on Indian art
music. North Indian art music is the re
sult of the confluence of Islamic and In
dian musical culture.
If we were asked by the Muslim Stu
dent Association to perform in order to
raise awareness, we would do so in the
same spirit of celebration, and acknowl
edgement of a shared history.

India is not a country
of 'majority-rule terror'
In response to Maya Dodd's letter, I
take strong objection to describing the
situation in India as "majority-rule ter
ror." Indians as a whole and Hindus as a
community have always been tolerant of
other faiths and religions. There is
ample evidence in the history of India to
support this claim. There have been cer
tain unwarranted incidents in Gujarat
which though most certainly con
demnable, do no by any stretch of imag
ination, enable one to conclude that the
majority is terrorizing the minorities
across the country.

To write this off as an attempt to exploit
the minorities would amount to ignoring
the deeper causes of what has let! to the
Gujarat outbreak, and would indeed be a
very naive approach to the situation.
Secondly, to criticize the Hindu Stu
dent Council for trying to highlight the
plight of Hindus where they are in minor
ity, simply because there are issues else
where , is the most ridiculous of things. Il
is the responsibility and right of the mem
bers of any community to highlight in
public any injustice meted out to them.
Otherwise, who will take up the cudgels
on their behalf?
1 he media has traditionally been hyper
critical of any incident where Hindus
might be to blame, and at the same time
completely ignoring those issues where
they are the persecuted. This has been the
situation for many years and has led to the
Hindus feeling increasingly alienated
within India and also have a feeling of get
ting a raw deal at the hands of the interna
tional media as well.
While the council —just like any
other organisation on this planet — can
not claim to represent the interests of
every single Hindu on this planet; it is
certainly worth appreciating the effort
they are putting into organizing a I lindu
Awareness Week.
If Dodd is genuinely concerned about
the image of I linduism being portrayed,
she should approach the council's mem
bers and express her misgivings in this
regard. I am sure the I lindus, tolerant as
they are, would give her views all the im
portance and consideration that they
well deserve.
