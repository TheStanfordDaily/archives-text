# ASSU elections indicative of a highly ineffective organization
## 
### PATRICK CROSETTO GUEST COLUMNIST 
A few weeks ago, I jokingly said to a
friend that the ASSU election debacle is
making Stanford look like Florida. Today 1
can say that this is no longer the case, rather,
the ASSU is much worse than Florida, and
the 2002 ASSU election has made a mock
er)' of democracy.
I've never been involved with the
ASSU and never had any real contact with
the organization until I challenged there
suits of this past presidential election. The
reason for the challenge had nothing to
do with partisan objections, but instead
was inspired out of a desire to see that
Stanford students had, a rule-abiding and
healthy democracy.
What I have seen in my dealings with the
ASSU over these past few weeks has made
me realize how sick democracy is at Stanford.
For those who don't know, 1 filed a chal
lenge with the Elections Commission infor
mally on April 18 and formally on April 22,
based on the lack of any presidential slate to

win a "majority of all members of the Associ
ation voting in the Spring Quarter General
Election" as is required by the Constitution.
The constitution calls fora runoff in such
a case, and the entire challenge came down
to whether or not the fifth and last round of
voting qualified as a runoff or as part of the
general election. It was, and still is, my opin
ion that if you have only voted once and
turned in one ballot, than it is impossible
that this one ballot can be constitutionally
valid in both a general election and a runoff.
As expected, the Elections Commission
ruled against me.
I have since come to discover that the
ASSU is neither a reliable or accountable
form of student government as it claims, but
rather engages in activities that are poten
tially illegal and border on corruption.
My case is one such example of the flaws
of the ASSU. For the first four days after my
challenge was 112 iled, the ASSU was paralyzed
and there was nowhere I could go to get an
answer on how to proceed with a challenge,
nor was anyone sure if I could even make a
challenge. I was astonished by the lack offa

miliarity of the decision-makers in the ASS U
with the organization's own constitution
and by-laws.
After the more formal complaint was
filed with the Elections Commission, my
challenge faced a constitutionally im
posed time deadline of nine days. It took
two days for the commission to meet to
discuss the matter. The commission met
on April 24 and held a closed meeting, in
fact never responding to 'my pleas as to
the location of said meeting and whether
1 could speak at the meeting. This behav
ior is itself illegal under the very strict
Freedom of Information Regulations in
iheASSU Constitution.
Furthermore, I waited another week to
receive an official written ruling from the
commission, and when it arrived it was in
the form of a poorly written and factually
and mathematically flawed document that
seemed as though it been thrown together
in mere minutes.
The larger point here, however, is that by
waiting until May 1 to rule on my challenge
(a whole 13 days since my original filing!),

the Elections Commission had effectively
cut off any chance of further action. The
reply came only a few hours before the con
stitutional deadline for holding a runoff ar
rived, making any appeal to the Constitu
tional Council impossible.
Recently, and 1 daresay more damning
ly, information has come to light that is far
more disgusting than the stonewalling by
the Elections Commission in regards to my
complaint. The fact that a student, who
also happened to be working on the cam
paign of one of the slates running for pres
ident, was able to access the Web site and
see voting totals fora total of 11 hours is in
deed shocking.
The first point that needs to be made that
in the best case scenario the actions of Henry
Towsner are merely highly unethical and in
the worst case they reflect behavior that re
quires investigation by the Judicial Board.
Second, it is important to consider the
implications of this action on the election.
Though I do not know Towsner, I feel cer
tain that he was not dumb enough to ma
nipulate any vote totals.

It will be impossible to ever know if
Towsner used the information, or how
many people were aware of what he
gleaned from his 11 hours on the Web
site. We will never know if or how his ac
tions influenced campaign decisions of
the Monica Henestroza/ Nick Rodriguez
campaign by having information to which
other candidates were not privy.
If the Josh Benson / Kendra Arimoto
campaign knew that their candidate was be
hind by only 200 votes, might they have not
campaigned a little bit harder, made a few
last-minute phone calls?
If the Elections Commission was aware of
this on the night of the elections, why hadn't
this been reported right away? And why is
the Elections Commission now hiding be
hind my challenge as the reason this was not
addressed?
I have only five weeks left as a Stanford
student, and I will do my best to make sure
that problems are fixed. I encourage every
student out there reading this column to do
your best to fix the ASSU. Now is the time
for revolutionary and sweeping change.

For those who don't know, 1 filed a chal
lenge with the Elections Commission infor
mally on April 18 and formally on April 22,
based on the lack of any presidential slate to

win a "majority of all members of the Associ
ation voting in the Spring Quarter General
Election" as is required by the Constitution.
The constitution calls fora runoff in such
a case, and the entire challenge came down
to whether or not the fifth and last round of
voting qualified as a runoff or as part of the
general election. It was, and still is, my opin
ion that if you have only voted once and
turned in one ballot, than it is impossible
that this one ballot can be constitutionally
valid in both a general election and a runoff.
As expected, the Elections Commission
ruled against me.
I have since come to discover that the
ASSU is neither a reliable or accountable
form of student government as it claims, but
rather engages in activities that are poten
tially illegal and border on corruption.
My case is one such example of the flaws
of the ASSU. For the first four days after my
challenge was 112 iled, the ASSU was paralyzed
and there was nowhere I could go to get an
answer on how to proceed with a challenge,
nor was anyone sure if I could even make a
challenge. I was astonished by the lack offa

miliarity of the decision-makers in the ASS U
with the organization's own constitution
and by-laws.
After the more formal complaint was
filed with the Elections Commission, my
challenge faced a constitutionally im
posed time deadline of nine days. It took
two days for the commission to meet to
discuss the matter. The commission met
on April 24 and held a closed meeting, in
fact never responding to 'my pleas as to
the location of said meeting and whether
1 could speak at the meeting. This behav
ior is itself illegal under the very strict
Freedom of Information Regulations in
iheASSU Constitution.
Furthermore, I waited another week to
receive an official written ruling from the
commission, and when it arrived it was in
the form of a poorly written and factually
and mathematically flawed document that
seemed as though it been thrown together
in mere minutes.
The larger point here, however, is that by
waiting until May 1 to rule on my challenge
(a whole 13 days since my original filing!),

the Elections Commission had effectively
cut off any chance of further action. The
reply came only a few hours before the con
stitutional deadline for holding a runoff ar
rived, making any appeal to the Constitu
tional Council impossible.
Recently, and 1 daresay more damning
ly, information has come to light that is far
more disgusting than the stonewalling by
the Elections Commission in regards to my
complaint. The fact that a student, who
also happened to be working on the cam
paign of one of the slates running for pres
ident, was able to access the Web site and
see voting totals fora total of 11 hours is in
deed shocking.
The first point that needs to be made that
in the best case scenario the actions of Henry
Towsner are merely highly unethical and in
the worst case they reflect behavior that re
quires investigation by the Judicial Board.
Second, it is important to consider the
implications of this action on the election.
Though I do not know Towsner, I feel cer
tain that he was not dumb enough to ma
nipulate any vote totals.

It will be impossible to ever know if
Towsner used the information, or how
many people were aware of what he
gleaned from his 11 hours on the Web
site. We will never know if or how his ac
tions influenced campaign decisions of
the Monica Henestroza/ Nick Rodriguez
campaign by having information to which
other candidates were not privy.
If the Josh Benson / Kendra Arimoto
campaign knew that their candidate was be
hind by only 200 votes, might they have not
campaigned a little bit harder, made a few
last-minute phone calls?
If the Elections Commission was aware of
this on the night of the elections, why hadn't
this been reported right away? And why is
the Elections Commission now hiding be
hind my challenge as the reason this was not
addressed?
I have only five weeks left as a Stanford
student, and I will do my best to make sure
that problems are fixed. I encourage every
student out there reading this column to do
your best to fix the ASSU. Now is the time
for revolutionary and sweeping change.
