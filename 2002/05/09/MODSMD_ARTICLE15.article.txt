## Garko hits two bombs in win over Santa Clara 
### MALCOLM LEVINE STAFF WRITER 
In the middle of a heated race
for the Pacific 10 Conference
crown, every game is vital for
the No. 7 Cardinal (33-17, 9-6
Pac-10) and the team is sure
playing with the fire that a pen
nant race entails.
On Tuesday night at Buck
Shaw Stadium, the Cardinal won
its fourth straight game, trounc
ing local rival Santa Clara, 13-2, in
a nonconference game.
Junior catcher Ryan Garko led
Stanford's offensive barrage with
his first-ever multi-homer game,
delivering his 10th and 11th
home runs of the season and
wrestling the team lead away from
junior designated hitter Jason
Cooper in the process.
"It was exciting," Garko said.
"But the most important thing is
to just keep winning games."
Garko's solo shot in the top of
the first inning got the Cardinal
going, and the team never
looked back, putting up 13 runs
before the Broncos even got on
the board.
However, it was in no way a
one-man show, as Garko was one
of seven Cardinal sluggers to have
more than two hits on the night.
Sophomore centerfielder
Sam Fuld was one of them. He
continued his torrid streak at the
plate with his seventh straight
multi-hit game, going 2 for 6
with a home run and 2 RBI.
Over his last 14 games, Fuld has
hit at an astonishing .572 clip,

raising his team-high batting av
erage to .372.
Junior righthander Darin
Naatjes (4-0) got-the win for the
Cardinal, shutting out Santa
Clara for the game's first three in
nings, allowing only one hit while
striking out five batters.

portune time.
With live teams within two
games of each other at the top of
the league standings, the Pac-10
title is there for the taking and
odds are that the race will go
down to the wire.
All signs point toward a huge

series this weekend, as the Cardi
nal will take on Arizona State for
the first time since March 2001,
when Stanford took two out of
three games in Tempe.
Offensively, the Sun Devils are
led by powerful first baseman Je
remy West, who paces the team
with 11 home runs, 49 RBL and a
.342 batting average.
However, West will be with
out one of his biggest supporters
in the lineup, as Jon Sheaffer,

the Sun Devils' starting center
fielder and leading hitter with a
.364 batting average, should
miss the series. Sheaffer was sus
pended indefinitely from the
team for violating team rules on
a recent road trip to Notre
Dame.
The three-game set gets un
derway on Friday night at Sunken
Diamond at 6:00 p.m., when
Stanford sends junior ace Jeremy
Guthrie (7-1, 2.90 ERA) to the hill

to face fellow righthander Jered
Liebeck (0-1, 5.88).
Both Saturday and Sunday's
games will begin at 1:00 p.m., as
the Cardinal will follow with ju
nior Tim Cunningham (5-2, 4.34)
and sophomore John Hudgins (8-
0, 4.30), while the Sun Devils will
throw Mike Esposito (7-5, 3.40)
and Robbie McClellan (7-4, 4.48),
respectively.
All three games will be broad

In the middle of a heated race
for the Pacific 10 Conference
crown, every game is vital for
the No. 7 Cardinal (33-17, 9-6
Pac-10) and the team is sure
playing with the fire that a pen
nant race entails.
On Tuesday night at Buck
Shaw Stadium, the Cardinal won
its fourth straight game, trounc
ing local rival Santa Clara, 13-2, in
a nonconference game.
Junior catcher Ryan Garko led
Stanford's offensive barrage with
his first-ever multi-homer game,
delivering his 10th and 11th
home runs of the season and
wrestling the team lead away from
junior designated hitter Jason
Cooper in the process.
"It was exciting," Garko said.
"But the most important thing is
to just keep winning games."
Garko's solo shot in the top of
the first inning got the Cardinal
going, and the team never
looked back, putting up 13 runs
before the Broncos even got on
the board.
However, it was in no way a
one-man show, as Garko was one
of seven Cardinal sluggers to have
more than two hits on the night.
Sophomore centerfielder
Sam Fuld was one of them. He
continued his torrid streak at the
plate with his seventh straight
multi-hit game, going 2 for 6
with a home run and 2 RBI.
Over his last 14 games, Fuld has
hit at an astonishing .572 clip,

raising his team-high batting av
erage to .372.
Junior righthander Darin
Naatjes (4-0) got-the win for the
Cardinal, shutting out Santa
Clara for the game's first three in
nings, allowing only one hit while
striking out five batters.

Junior catcher Ryan Garko hit two home runs in a game for the first time in his collegiate career in the Cardinal's 13-

portune time.
With live teams within two
games of each other at the top of
the league standings, the Pac-10
title is there for the taking and
odds are that the race will go
down to the wire.
All signs point toward a huge

series this weekend, as the Cardi
nal will take on Arizona State for
the first time since March 2001,
when Stanford took two out of
three games in Tempe.
Offensively, the Sun Devils are
led by powerful first baseman Je
remy West, who paces the team
with 11 home runs, 49 RBL and a
.342 batting average.
However, West will be with
out one of his biggest supporters
in the lineup, as Jon Sheaffer,

the Sun Devils' starting center
fielder and leading hitter with a
.364 batting average, should
miss the series. Sheaffer was sus
pended indefinitely from the
team for violating team rules on
a recent road trip to Notre
Dame.
The three-game set gets un

Diamond at 6:00 p.m., when
Stanford sends junior ace Jeremy
Guthrie (7-1, 2.90 ERA) to the hill

to face fellow righthander Jered
Liebeck (0-1, 5.88).
Both Saturday and Sunday's
games will begin at 1:00 p.m., as
the Cardinal will follow with ju

and sophomore John Hudgins (8-

throw Mike Esposito (7-5, 3.40)
and Robbie McClellan (7-4, 4.48),
respectively.
All three games will be broad
