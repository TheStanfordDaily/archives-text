# Celtics even it up with Pistons

AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) — The Boston
Celtics showed there's more to their team than just
Paul Pierce and Antoine Walker.
Pierce led five Celtics in double figures with 22
points in an 85-77 victory over Detroit on Wednesday
night that evened the Eastern Conference semifinals
and was their first road win of the playoffs.
"We're tough to guard," said Eric Williams, who
scored 18 points on 6-of-9 shooting. "We can put five
guys out t here who can shoot the 3, and if they try to
take that away from us, we can attack the inside. We
play from the inside out, and that's how teams win
championships.
"When you've got two All-Stars, like Antoine Walk
er and Paul Pierce, you can do lot of different things."
Came 3 in the best-of-seven series is Eriday night in
Boston.
Walker scored 15 points for the Celtics, while Rod
ney Rogers had 13 and Kenny Anderson 11.
"I would definitely hate to play us because we pro
vide so many problems defensively," Pierce said.
The Pistons had a hard time matching up with sev
eral Celtics — outside, inside and off the dribble.
"When you combine their 3-point ability with their
post ability and their one-on-one ability, it's a hard
team to play," Detroit coach Rick Carlisle said.
Boston coach Jim O'Brien believes that's especially
true because Pierce and Walker are focused on the
right things.
"I don't think either guy cares as much about scor
ing as they do about winning," O'Brien said.
Jerry Stackhouse led Detroit with 25 points.
Boston held Detroit to 32.9 percent shooting, its
worst performance of the season, and outrebounded
the Pistons 53-35.
"They outworked us and outplayed us," Carlisle
said.
Cliff Robinson was held to just two points in the
first half, after scoring 30 in Game 1, but he helped the
Pistons get back into the game briefly in the third
quarter.
He scored five straight points to cap a 16-4 run
which cut Detroit's deficit to 56-54 with 4:10 left in the
quarter. Robinson finished 13 points.
Boston regained control of the game by outscoring
the Pistons 16-7 to take a 72-61 lead early in the final
quarter on a 3-pointer by Walker — his first points
since late in the first quarter.
The Celtics' cushion was never threatened.
After the game, tempers flared as Robinson and
Walker engaged in face-to-face trash-talking and had
to be separated.
"Antoine was just running his mouth like he likes
to do," Robinson said. "He's a front-runner, so he was
talking tonight. That's the kind of guy he has always
been."
