# Schweizer leaves mark off the field
## 
### 
They lovingly refer to
him simply as
/'Schweizer:" The 6-
foot, 3-inch Australian
import with the disheveled hair
and thick Aussie accent.
This weekend at the NCAA
Division II National Champi
onship of rugby, Patrick
Schweizer didn't make any
highlight-reel-quality scores or
bone-jarring hits. But even
though his on-field play won't
be the stuff that legends are
made of, Schweizer gets my vote
for being the most valuable
team member of the Stanford
Rugby Club.
For this team, you have to look
beyond the stats to get to the
squad's true essence. Beyond the
numbers, Schweizer exemplifies
everything that makes sports so
much fun to participate in.
Like starting a fight with the
team that Stanford had just
beaten for the national title in
the hotel after the game by in
furiating several of Northern
lowa's female supporters. The
women allegedly confused one
of Schweizer's good-natured
Aussie comments with a word
properly used only on female
dogs.
Like having to get a throng
of teammates to intervene be
fore the situation erupted into
an old-fashioned rugby hotel
brawl.
Like pounding a Fosters be
fore a game to celebrate Aus
tralia's victory in the Rugby
World Cup, then running off his
buzz during the ensuing 80 min
utes of the game and notching a
game-winning score. Then, of

course, he severely regretted the
decision after learning a valu
able lesson that the DARE pro
gram just never quite fully ex
plored.
It's the dumb comments and
dumber actions that make great

memories and
the great stories
that you can
gather around
a campfire on a
Fijian beach
with 35 of your
teammates and
recall time and
time again,

each time funnier than the last.
In all sports, there will al
ways be the guys who score the
points, get the credit for the
victories and who the fans will
remember when they leave.
But it's guys like Schweizer
who the players will always re
member when they leave. It's
guys like Schweizer who make
the experience of participating
in a team sport so truly re
markable.
For everyone who has never
had the opportunity to partici
pate in a team sport, these are
the types of moments you're
missing out on. It's not scoring
the winning touchdown, and it's
not grabbing that home-run ball
before it goes over the fence to
preserve a victory.
It's laughing for an hour as
one of your teammates tells the
story about how, during the
team's spring break tour in New
Zealand, he got chased and at
tacked by two drunk women


Ryan Stewart
who mistook his pleasantries for
sexual innuendo.
It's the confounded looks on
the players' parents' faces as the
coach, with the help of a few glass
es of wine, jovially regales the
Olive Garden patrons with a stir
ring rendition about a young boy,
his grandmother and an incestual
trip to the brothel.
This is the true essence of
sports. The camaraderie, the
tomfoolery, the competition for
the few available women at the
hotel that extends from the cute,
21-year-old Kiwi to the 40 year
old obese women with mustaches
(not the team's finest hour).
These are the kinds of experi
ences that enrich the lives of the
people whom sports has so deeply
touched, and made them better
people in the process.
There will always be people to

carry the load on the field. There
will always be people to make the
tackle or deliver the pass. And
Stanford rugby was lucky
enough this year to have a
plethora of both. But as the ela
tion of this year's national cham
pionship gives way to a new sea
son and new opportunities, there
will be no replacing the Patrick
Schweizers of the team.
I was privileged to have been
able to share some of these experi
ences with the rugby team over
the past few years and through the
championship this weekend in
Virginia Beach. Not because the
team won a national champi
onship, but because I have a few
more experiences that I can recall
by the campfire, and, thankfully,
no women with mustaches.

Ryan Stewart is a junior majoring in
economics, and lie would like to con
gratulate the Stanford rugby team on
defeating Northern lowa for the Na
tional Championship. He can be
