# All signs positive for lacrosse

Within two years, the Stanford women's
lacrosse team has jumped from being a West
Coast powerhouse to a national competitor.
Under the leadership of recently appointed
head coach Michele Uhlfelder, the team has
reached many goals and continues pro
gressing toward new heights with a NCAA
bid close at hand.
Last year saw Stanford's first ever top-20
ranking when it climbed and held the No. 20
spot for three weeks. In Uhlfelder's first year,
the team has held its own against tough East
Coast competition. The Cardinal was victori
ous over the likes of Lafayette, Davidson and
No. 13 Vanderbilt, and remained undefeat
ed in league play.
When Uhlfelder arrived in September
2000, she felt it was time for the team to focus
on breaking old habits and building new
ones at practice.
"The players wanted their pioneer spirit
to be a springboard that propelled the pro
gram on the road to a national model and a
NCAA way of thinking, versus solely a 'Best
in the West' frame of mind," Uhlfelder said.
This season's schedule reflected the new
desire to be nationally recognized. Stanford
continued to match up with more East Coast
competition as well as encouraging more
eastern teams to travel west to play in games
such as this year's first East-West Challenge
played at Stanford.
The older players of the team combine to
form a solid backbone that is aware of the

history and positive transformation through
which the team has gone.
The sophomores, who came to Stanford
with the belief that they would be led by the
old coach, Heidi Connor, were pleasantly
surprised when they were welcomed instead
by Uhlfelder.
"Since it was a newer program which had
not yet made a name for itself, [the expecta
tions weren't as high as] a program such as
Duke or [North Carolina]," said sophomore
attacker Jess Scott. "It didn't seem like there
were as many demands placed on the play
ers to perform up to par.
"At that time I viewed these things as pos
itives, because I didn't think I was ready to
be a part of such an intense team. Now, how
ever, I can see how lucky I am to be chal
lenged every day to improve and become a
stronger athlete," she said.
"I think the transition this team is going
through is apparent to anyone who watches
us play or talks to a team member or coach,"
Scott added. "There's a sense of excitement
around our team because of the vision that
we all share."
The players admit that they have been
highly impressed with the fresh philoso
phies and goals brought in by the new
coaching staff. One effect is that every mem
ber of the squad has noticed the increase in
intensity expected at practice.
Likewise, new components such as med
itation before practices and games have
been added to help the team focus on the
