# All signs positive for lacrosse

### ANNE NYBORG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Within two years, the Stanford women's
lacrosse team has jumped from being a West
Coast powerhouse to a national competitor.
Under the leadership of recently appointed
head coach Michele Uhlfelder, the team has
reached many goals and continues pro
gressing toward new heights with a NCAA
bid close at hand.
Last year saw Stanford's first ever top-20
ranking when it climbed and held the No. 20
spot for three weeks. In Uhlfelder's first year,
the team has held its own against tough East
Coast competition. The Cardinal was victori
ous over the likes of Lafayette, Davidson and
No. 13 Vanderbilt, and remained undefeat
ed in league play.
When Uhlfelder arrived in September
2000, she felt it was time for the team to focus
on breaking old habits and building new
ones at practice.
"The players wanted their pioneer spirit
to be a springboard that propelled the pro
gram on the road to a national model and a
NCAA way of thinking, versus solely a 'Best
in the West' frame of mind," Uhlfelder said.
This season's schedule reflected the new
desire to be nationally recognized. Stanford
continued to match up with more East Coast
competition as well as encouraging more
eastern teams to travel west to play in games
such as this year's first East-West Challenge
played at Stanford.
The older players of the team combine to
form a solid backbone that is aware of the

history and positive transformation through
which the team has gone.
The sophomores, who came to Stanford
with the belief that they would be led by the
old coach, Heidi Connor, were pleasantly
surprised when they were welcomed instead
by Uhlfelder.
"Since it was a newer program which had
not yet made a name for itself, [the expecta
tions weren't as high as] a program such as
Duke or [North Carolina]," said sophomore
attacker Jess Scott. "It didn't seem like there
were as many demands placed on the play
ers to perform up to par.
"At that time I viewed these things as pos
itives, because I didn't think I was ready to
be a part of such an intense team. Now, how
ever, I can see how lucky I am to be chal
lenged every day to improve and become a
stronger athlete," she said.
"I think the transition this team is going
through is apparent to anyone who watches
us play or talks to a team member or coach,"
Scott added. "There's a sense of excitement
around our team because of the vision that
we all share."
The players admit that they have been
highly impressed with the fresh philoso
phies and goals brought in by the new
coaching staff. One effect is that every mem
ber of the squad has noticed the increase in
intensity expected at practice.
Likewise, new components such as med
itation before practices and games have
been added to help the team focus on the

job at hand.
"When I arrived four years
ago, the team seemed to have sim
ilar goals as we have had in the past
two years, but I'm not convinced
we knew how to achieve them back
then," senior attacker Liz Britt
said. "With the strong leadership
of the new coaching staff and the
enthusiasm of the current players,
the team now has the elements to
take it to the level they have been
striving for."
The current members of the
team are of special importance be
cause they have seen where the
program has been, have embraced
this new vision and will be able to
share this experience with future
players.
Jlie first class brought in under
Uhlfelder has much to offer the
program. They have all come into
Stanford having faced tough high
school competition.
"One of the main reasons why I
wanted to play for Stanford is be

cause I knew this lacrosse program
was breaking out and making a
name for itself. 1 wanted to help
contribute, and I knew that I could
make an impact as a freshman,"
Britt said.
The older and newer genera
tions of the lacrosse team have ad
justed well to each other and the
challenges laid before them have
turned them into a cohesive unit.
"My views about the program
have changed in terms of how I
view the team and the culture of
lacrosse here, but they haven't
changed in terms of the ideology
of lacrosse at Stanford," said ju
nior goalkeeper Virginia
Solomon, who transferred from
Maryland this year. "There clear
ly is a significant — though differ
ent from the East Coast — lacrosse
culture here, and the team is a lot
more tightly knit then I'd believed
it was going to be."
"The current goal of becoming
a national power and a national
champion did not exist a few short
years ago," added freshman at
tacker Kelsey Twist. "Today we all
know that we have the tools to
make this dream a reality."
