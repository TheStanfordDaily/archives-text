the Pac-10 Multi-Event Champi
onships will be held on Saturday and
Sunday in Pullman, Wa.
All other Pac-10 Championship
events will be held the following week

end, with the NCAA Championships
looming at the end of the month.
Sophomore Lillian Bush is the Car
dinal's best hope fora top finish at the
Pac-10 Multi-Events. Her career-best
of 5,015 points in the heptathlon ranks
fifth in the conference.
Bush will be joined by freshman
Ahimsa Hodari, who enters the meet
with 4,710 points.
For the rest of the Cardinal, this
weekend represents the last oppor
tunity to gain qualifying marks be
fore the championship portion of the
season.
These athletes will have the advan
tage of competing for qualifiers on
their own track at the Cardinal Quali

fier, held this Friday at Cobb Track.
Athletes on the border of making
the national championship meet
should be encouraged by the fact that
at last year's qualifier, more than 65
automatic or provisional qualifiers for
the NCAAs were attained.
In addition to watching Stanford's
own athletes, spectators will see some
of the world's elite Kenyan runners
compete at the qualifier.
The men's 800 meters will see cur
rent Stanford star Gabe Jennings
square off against former teammate
and fellow Olympian Michael Stem
ber, as well as Kenyans Bernard Lagat
and Japheth Kumutai, whose
time of 1 minute, 42.69 seconds is
barely over a second slower than
the world record.
The qualifier will be the last
home meet for the Cardinal, cap

season, which has seen a host of
remarkable performances and
three school records.
The Stanford women's ham
mer-throw record tell to sopho
more Jessica I'luth's throw of 196
feet, 2 inches. Junior Kathleen
Donoghue jumped 13-5.5 in the
pole vault at Big Meet, and junior
Inan hurled the discus 198-7,
both school records.
Additionally, 13 Cardinal ath
letes have qualified automatically
for the NCAAs and 19 more hold
provisional qualifying marks.
The sheer numbers of Stan
ford athletes who will likely com
pete at the NCAA Champi
onships is impressive enough.
More importantly, however,
the Cardinal appears to be peak
ing just at the right time, with a
healthy roster and top marks
coining in recent meets.
Four of the 13 automatic quali
fiers came last weekend, and
strong performances given by
Stanford athletes across all events
at the Cardinal Invitational and
Big Meet show that the team is in
top form heading into the confer
ence and national championships.
In addition to the qualifier,
several Cardinal sprinters and

Modesto Relays on Saturday.
