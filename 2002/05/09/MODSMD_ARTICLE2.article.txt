# New police chief named
## 
### MIKEY LEE EDITORIAL STAFF 
After a decade of service as an officer, Lt.
Laura Wilson, '91, was chosen to lead the
Stanford Police starting in June as the Uni
versity's sixth police chief.
"Lt. Wilson embodies the balance of top
notch professional experience and superior
people skills that are essential to being a suc
cessful police chief at Stanford," said Univer
sity President John Hennessy.
Wilson succeeds Marvin Moore, who died
unexpectedly of a heart attack on Feb. 10. She
will become the first female officer and the
first alumna to serve as police chief. She
earned a bachelor's in human biology.
"I feel very positively about her appoint
ment," said Marvin Herrington, a retired
chief who hired Wilson as a rookie in 1992.
"She was an outstanding officer and field
sergeant and has always done an outstand
ing job."
Wilson, 35, and a native of Houston,
Texas, worked as an events staff coordinator
in the ticket office after graduating in 1991. A
year later, she joined the Stanford Police as a
deputy sheriff. In 1998, she was promoted to
sergeant and last year, she became a lieu
tenant working in the investigations division.
Jeff Wachtel, special assistant to the pres
ident and provost, led the committee that
chose Wilson.
According to Wachtel, the committee de
cided to look internally fora candidate first,
and to look in other places if no qualified

candidate emerged.
Wilson says her key role is not as an au
thority figure, but as a service provider.
"Society entrusts law enforcement officers
with awesome power and authority," she
said. "1 believe it is imperative that officers
understand the magnitude of this responsi
bility and remain mindful that we are role
models and service providers, not law mak
ers, judges or jurors."
Wilson said that she wants to dedicate her
life to the department's excellence, just like
Moore and Herrington, who was also 35
years old when he was named police chief.
"I earnestly and wholeheartedly want to
follow in their footsteps," she said.
