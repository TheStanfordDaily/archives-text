# Senate selects chair, tackles debt
## 
### JOHN HUETTER EDITORIAL STAFF 
The new ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate had a full agenda at its first meeting
Tuesday.
The largely rookie body — only Bo
Cowgill, Connie Chen, and ASSU Vice
President Nick Rodriguez (technically a
member of the Senate) have served as
senators before — discussed general fee
funding policy. In addition, senators also
signed up for committees, created a new
ASSU position, and elected one of its own
to the post of Senate Chair.
2002-2003 Senate Chair chosen
Cowgill, a junior, was chosen in an 8-
to-3 vote over Myisha Patterson to serve
as the 2002-2003 Senate Chair after a de
bate over whether past leadership expe
rience or past ASSU experience was
more important.
Former Chair Alex Shvartsman, a se
nior, described the qualities the Senate
ought to vote for when picking a chair.
"You're looking for leadership abili
ty," he said. "You have to know how to
run a meeting," Shvartsman continued.
"You have to know how to say no."
He also noted that the chair would be
the representative of the Senate to the
Faculty Senate, the Graduate Student
Council, and the media.
"I feel like I'm going to be a modera
tor Senate chair," Cowgill said. He, like
Shvartsman, plans not to vote except to
break ties. Cowgill said he felt there was a
"potential for the Senate chair to get too

involved and lose [your] trust."
"It is not my intention to crowd the
agenda with my own projects unless the
Senate is otherwise letting its feet drag,"
he said, continuing in the moderation
vein.
Cowgill did have a few things he would
like to see done, however, including a

Web site for tracking
Senate bills, which "will
open up our agenda
and what we do to the
general public" and give
the public a chance to
comment on the issue.
He also planned to
increase communica
tion with the Nomina-

tions Commission.
"They're like our first line of defense
against what is a huge administration,"
he said.
Patterson is currently the vice presi
dent of the California chapter of the Na
tional Association for the Advancement
of Colored People, as well as the outgo
ing two-year president of the Stanford
chapter of the NAACP.
"I have a lot of experience that per
tains to the Senate Chair, and I wouldn't
want to waste it!" Patterson said with a
smile. "I'm more of an amiable leader,
but I'm also a driver," she said.
Though Patterson's speaking abilities
and renowned past leadership roles
seemed popular among senators,
Cowgill's ASSU track record was also an
important factor the Senate examined.
Cowgill has served as an .ASSU executive

aide and senator, he said. While lie has
not led a committee, he wrote a bill to re
form the Senate's resolution process, sug
gested that the Senate begin recording
how individual senators voted, and "de
signed a new appropriations Web site."
During the deliberation, Shvartsman,
who remained to answer questions and
to observe the debate, noted that whatev
er happened, the vote was secret, and the
Senate could and should move on as a
unit afterwards. He said he himself won
8-7, but the fact that seven senators voted
against him never came up again.
Funding dilemmas and solutions
The Senate also took care of its end-of
the-year general fee funding.
"We are very much in debt," said Pro
gramming Director Dana Craig, a
sophomore, while introducing general
fee funding recommendations. "One of
our priorities has been separating luxu
ries [from] necessities."
Former Senate Appropriations Com
mittee Chair Megan Root, a sophomore,
revealed after the meeting that the pro
gramming general fee fund was current
ly around $50,000 in debt. "
Since we're obviously out of money,"
Root said, "we cut out all the side stuff
[like food]."
Root explained that the debt would be
paid through the Senate's general fee re
serves, which were currently at about
$500,000. The new Senate wouldn't be
saddled with the debt, she continued, but
