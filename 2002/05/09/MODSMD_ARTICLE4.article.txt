# Different groups look to diversify faculty
## Students, administrators attempt to increase tenured faculty of color 
### MELANIE PENNY 
While much fanfare has been
made regarding the amount of di
versity of the accepted class 0f2006,
this diversity has yet to be matched
by the composition of Stanford fac
ulty. According to the University's
mpst recent statistics, only 16 per
cent of the faculty are members of
racial minority groups, compared
to 46 percent of the undergraduate
student body.
Many students and administra
tors attribute this lack of diversity to
the tenure process.

The tenure process is two-fold.
First, faculty who are in line for
tenure are identified. Then, after
an extended review process by sev
eral bodies, a tenure decision is
reached.
Seventy-three percent of the
University's faculty have either
been granted tenure or are in line
to receive tenure, and it is with this
issue that many students and ad
ministrators have found fault.
"The tenure process works
against faculty of color," said junior
Sonrisa Lucero, an outgoing ASSU
senator and the founder of the Fac
ulty Diversity Task Force.
According to Lucero, the first
impediment to increasing the
number of faculty of color is the
"pipeline issue." Many observers
agree that there is a limited pool of

minorities who have pursued ad
vanced degrees of study. Further
more, few people of color are en
gaged in fields of research that fac
ulty search committees desire. As a
result, the number of applicants to
choose from is lower for members
of minority groups and there is a
high degree of competition for
these remaining individuals.
Therefore, fewer faculty of color
are hired.
The second issue Lucero identi
fied is the tenure process itself. The
faculty that work at Stanford have a
seven-year window during which
they must establish themselves in
their fields of research. At the end
of this time, the body of work they
have created is taken into account
and the tenure decision is made,
thus emphasizing the phrase "pub

lish or perish."
Members of the ASSIJ Faculty
Diversity Task Force attribute the
problem again to what is perceived
to be the politicized nature of the
process. Committee members are
predisposed to support faculty
with research areas that will fur
ther their own goals and interests.
Such preference does not bode
well for minority professors be
cause their fields of interest often
differ from the mainstream and
might not be as well received by
the judging committees.
Some students believe it is exact
ly this diversion from the main
stream that makes faculty of color a
necessity.
