# Different groups look to diversify faculty
## Students, administrators attempt to increase tenured faculty of color 
### MELANIE PENNY 
While much fanfare has been
made regarding the amount of di
versity of the accepted class 0f2006,
this diversity has yet to be matched
by the composition of Stanford fac
ulty. According to the University's
mpst recent statistics, only 16 per
cent of the faculty are members of
racial minority groups, compared
to 46 percent of the undergraduate
student body.
Many students and administra
tors attribute this lack of diversity to
the tenure process.

The tenure process is two-fold.
First, faculty who are in line for
tenure are identified. Then, after
an extended review process by sev
eral bodies, a tenure decision is
reached.
Seventy-three percent of the
University's faculty have either
been granted tenure or are in line
to receive tenure, and it is with this
issue that many students and ad
ministrators have found fault.
"The tenure process works
against faculty of color," said junior
Sonrisa Lucero, an outgoing ASSU
senator and the founder of the Fac
ulty Diversity Task Force.
According to Lucero, the first
impediment to increasing the
number of faculty of color is the
"pipeline issue." Many observers
agree that there is a limited pool of

minorities who have pursued ad
vanced degrees of study. Further
more, few people of color are en
gaged in fields of research that fac
ulty search committees desire. As a
result, the number of applicants to
choose from is lower for members
of minority groups and there is a
high degree of competition for
these remaining individuals.
Therefore, fewer faculty of color
are hired.
The second issue Lucero identi
fied is the tenure process itself. The
faculty that work at Stanford have a
seven-year window during which
they must establish themselves in
their fields of research. At the end
of this time, the body of work they
have created is taken into account
and the tenure decision is made,
thus emphasizing the phrase "pub

lish or perish."
Members of the ASSIJ Faculty
Diversity Task Force attribute the
problem again to what is perceived
to be the politicized nature of the
process. Committee members are
predisposed to support faculty
with research areas that will fur
ther their own goals and interests.
Such preference does not bode
well for minority professors be
cause their fields of interest often
differ from the mainstream and
might not be as well received by
the judging committees.
Some students believe it is exact
ly this diversion from the main
stream that makes faculty of color a
necessity.
"Diverse faculty brings in a di

verse perspective," Lucero said. "It
is important for expanding the
canon of knowledge for Stanford
students."
This concern is mirrored by
members of other groups focusing
attention on this issue.
"The faculty diversity should
parallel diversity within the stu
dent body," said junior and Black
Student Union core member
Samantha Shipp.
Increasing the number of mi
nority professors is also high on
the list of concerns for the current
administration. In a speech to the
Faculty Senate last spring, Uni
versity President John Hennessy
enumerated a number of steps
that the University planned to
take in an attempt to diversify the
faculty. Among them was con
ducting a wider and more detailed
search process to identify more
potential candidates, increasing
the number of women and mi
norities in leadership positions in
the various departments and cre
ating an Advisory Committee on
Faculty Diversity to deal specifical
ly with this issue.
A year has passed since this
pledge. According to Provost John
Etchemendy, all of these proposed
actions have been taken and
progress is forthcoming.
"The process is slow, and frus
tratingly slow," he said.
Nevertheless, increasing the
number of tenured faculty of color
remains a high priority. According
to Etchemendy, tenure "allows
freedom of inquiry" for professors
and it also provides "a diverse set of
mentors and role models" for the
members of Stanford's increasing
ly diverse student body.
"Availability pools are fairly
small," Etchemendy said. He be
lieves this condition will remain
unchanged until there are at least a
few visible minority faculty mem
bers to help make the fields appear

welcoming to up-and-coming
scholars.
While many members of the ad
ministration and the student body
seem to be concerned about faculty
diversity, not everyone at Stanford
feels that increasing the number of
faculty of color is an important
goal.
Sophomore biology major VVei
li Chang believes that a wide range
of experiences are more valuable
than race alone.
"Diversity does not seem to be
an issue because most of the pro
fessors [I have encountered] have
had cross-cultural life experi
ences," she said.
However, students such as
freshman Amy Keith see the sig
nificance of having persons of
color in teaching positions at Stan
ford. In her first year, Keith has
encountered only two minority
professors and believes that in
creasing their numbers would be
an invaluable tool to inspire stu
dents of color.
"While there is a lot to be
learned from faculty members of
all races, professors of color are
important so that you can see peo
ple that look exactly like you
doing the things that you want to
do," Keith said.
While the tenure process and
the impediments to faculty di
versity are a complicated issue, it
is one that many students and
administrators are attempting to
unravel and confront. As part of
the future goals of the Faculty
Diversity Task Force, members
will be disseminating informa
tion about tenure issues to the
larger undergraduate popula
tion in an attempt to increase stu
dent understanding and concern
for this issue.
According to Etchemendy,
the most important role that stu
dents can play in increasing fac
ulty diversity is through their in
creased response to administra
tive inquiries regarding profes
sors' performance.
"Student input is always used in
the tenure process," he said.
