# Program sends students abroad
## 
### CHRISTY VON DER AHE 
While students from Stanford and other universities
are fighting for internships in the U.S. employment
crunch, a group of Stanford students is seeking green
er pastures — in India.
This year, 16 Stanford students are spending a
month of their summer in a remote village in Kerala,
India, working at the Vanavashi Ashrum Trust, a
newly established school for tribal Indian children.
The trip is the initiative of Project Dosti, a Stanford
program whose mission is to "increase awareness of
India and promote social change."
Dosti President Amit Garg, a senior, organized the
trip with four other Stanford students: Golda Philip, a
sophomore, Harini Raghupathy, a junior, Nico Slate, a
senior, and Peter Thiede, a junior.
Student volunteers of all class years and varying eth
nicities joined the Dosti program for diverse reasons.
Jenny Zhang, a freshman, said she saw a picture of a
previous trip on the Dosti Web site, and wanted to
"work with the kids."
Many volunteers are attracted to the idea of being
able to lend a hand to impoverished children. Hence
the name of the project, dosti, which is a Hindu word
meaning "friend."
Other volunteers cited the desire to work in a (level

oping region, and an interest in a simpler life for them
selves. Volunteers often discuss whether their visit will
he more helpful to the children or to them.
Some c ritics question the proposed effectiveness of
the trip to the children. For one thing, the children at
the school speak only Mayalayam. a lesser-known
South Indian language. This leaves some people won
dering: "What will the group teach? and how?"

Garg explained that while the
language barrier will cause some
problems, there will be translators
at the school, and that much can
be effected through visual cues
and body language. According to
Garg, the actual teaching is less
important than how the subjects
are taught.
According to Thiede, on previ
ous trips the teachers in India were
impressed with the interactive style

of teaching that the Stanford stu
dents adopted, and with the in
volvement of the children in the
lessons. Dosti organizers claim that
volunteers make children excited
about school and learning, no mat
ter what they teach.
Volunteers expressed a strong
desire to make the most of the op
portunity and do their best to sur
mount possible challenges. Once a
week, volunteers attend a section
during which they discuss travel
plans and curricula, a language
course in intensive Mayalayam, and
"Perspectives on India,"a class
sponsored by History Prof. Mark

Mancall and Project Dosti.
The class is meant to teach about
India from a wide variety of per
spectives. Every week, a new speak
er comes to the class, and topics
range from goddesses to govern
ment, monkeys to malaria, from
non-governmental organizations to
Hinduism and the caste system.
A talk can range from intense
philosophical discussion to mat
ter-of-fact history. The speakers
include Stanford and UC-Berke
ley professors, Stanford graduate
students, and members of the
local community.
The class, although open to all

Stanford students, currently only
consists of Dosti organizers and
volunteers for this summer. Or
ganizers were disappointed that
most Stanford students have not
taken advantage of the unique
cultural opportunities offered by
the class.
Individual lectures are open to
everyone regardless of whether
they are enrolled in the class. The
class is held every Tuesday from
7:30 to 9 p.m. in Building 50, Room
52H. Interested students should
look to the Dosti Web site,
dosti.stanford.edu, fora schedule
of upcoming speakers.
