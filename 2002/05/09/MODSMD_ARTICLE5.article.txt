# Program sends students abroad

### CHRISTY VON DER AHE 
While students from Stanford and other universities
are fighting for internships in the U.S. employment
crunch, a group of Stanford students is seeking green
er pastures â€” in India.
This year, 16 Stanford students are spending a
month of their summer in a remote village in Kerala,
India, working at the Vanavashi Ashrum Trust, a
newly established school for tribal Indian children.
The trip is the initiative of Project Dosti, a Stanford
program whose mission is to "increase awareness of
India and promote social change."
Dosti President Amit Garg, a senior, organized the
trip with four other Stanford students: Golda Philip, a
sophomore, Harini Raghupathy, a junior, Nico Slate, a
senior, and Peter Thiede, a junior.
Student volunteers of all class years and varying eth
nicities joined the Dosti program for diverse reasons.
Jenny Zhang, a freshman, said she saw a picture of a
previous trip on the Dosti Web site, and wanted to
"work with the kids."
Many volunteers are attracted to the idea of being
able to lend a hand to impoverished children. Hence
the name of the project, dosti, which is a Hindu word
meaning "friend."
Other volunteers cited the desire to work in a (level

oping region, and an interest in a simpler life for them
selves. Volunteers often discuss whether their visit will
he more helpful to the children or to them.
Some c ritics question the proposed effectiveness of
the trip to the children. For one thing, the children at
the school speak only Mayalayam. a lesser-known
South Indian language. This leaves some people won
dering: "What will the group teach? and how?"
