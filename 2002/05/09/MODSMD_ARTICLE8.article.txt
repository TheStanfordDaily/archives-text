Project to identify
potentially deadly
pathogens launched
WALNUT CREEK, Calif. (AP) — Researchers are
launching a project that will allow scientists to quickly
identity potentially deadly pathogens.
The Joint Genome Institute, which is overseen by
the U.S. Department of Energy, will embark next
week on the $6 million a year project to identify the
genetic blueprints of deadly bacteria such as anthrax
and the plague.
The research will give scientists the knowledge
they need to develop tests to identify the bacteria.
While researchers were searching for ways to iden
tify pathogens before Sept. 11, the terrorist attacks
heightened awareness of the potential for biological
threats.
Researchers say it used to take three to seven days
to identify a particular organism. Now it can take one
hour or less — a significant difference in the event of
an outbreak.

Blacks and Hispanics
more likely to be
searched by cops in SF
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Blacks and Hispanics
are more likely than whites to be searched when
stopped by a San Francisco police officer, a police de
partment study has found.
The San Francisco Police Department found that
blacks are 3.5 times more likely than whites to be
searched, while Hispanics are searched almost three
times more than whites.
It also found that although blacks make up only 7.9
percent of San Francisco's population, they constitute
almost 15 percent of police department traffic stops.
While Police Chief Fred Lau acknowledged the dis
parities, he said the figures are not the result of racial
profiling and instead reflect "sociological factors."
Representatives from the American Civil Liberties
Union say the study has them concerned.
"That raises a real red flag," American Civil Liber
ties Union attorney Mark Schlosberg said.
