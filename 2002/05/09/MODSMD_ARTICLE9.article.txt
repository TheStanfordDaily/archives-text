On May 9, 1927, The Daily printed an editorial
about the success of Stanford's social organization.
"Of the two hundred and forty freshmen receiving
bids this season, all but twenty pledged on the formal
day set aside for the purpose. Of this twenty, some will
pledge shortly. In addition to that, more men will be
pledged before the spring quarter is over.
"It was remarked in this column on a previous oc
casion, and it is here remarked again. Whatever else
can be said for the Greek letter organizations, a star
tlingly large percentage of students go into them vol
untarily. Propaganda circulated concerning their un
popularity with the students is pure hooey.
"We have waited until rushing season was over to
make some of these remarks for fear of being accused
of ballyhooing. Now that the dust has settled and the
fraternities have their classes, it is not indiscreet to
state a few relevant facts, particularly since those facts
will never come to the attention of next year's fresh
men.
"The history of student social organization at Stan
ford is a particularly satisfactory story. Without
undue influence from anyone, the undergraduates in
the early days organized along lines best suited to

1927

their temperaments.
"In addition to the fraternities and sororities com
mon to most college campi, the local students orga
nized eating clubs that are still with two exceptions, in
existence today. The exceptions became fraternities.
To offset these is the story of one club refusing the
offer of a charter from one of the oldest and most dis
tinguished fraternities in the country.
"However, we are wandering from the point. That
point was that at the present time there are firmly es
tablished organizations offering nearly every conceiv
able type of student life, with varying degrees of indi
vidual freedom. And there is an allowance made for
complete 112 reedom from any organization whatsoever.
"Hardly a campus in the country can boast of hav
ing made such a conscientious effort to meet the prob
lem of student social organization. Today there are
even rules forbidding undue coercion of freshmen in
rushing for the various groups.
"Stanford today stands at the threshold of a new
epoch in her history.
Bottom line: Students here have it good, so stop your bally
hooing about social hooey. Go get your tomfoolery on.
