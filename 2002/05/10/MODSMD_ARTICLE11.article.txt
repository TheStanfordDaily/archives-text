Services to cost more in SF
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — City officials are com
ing up with creative ways to make more money and
preserve services.
Plagued by a $175 million deficit, San Francisco is
about to make dying, getting married and a host of
other city services more expensive.
It now costs $75 to have a dead body retrieved
by the city. The proposal would hike that fee to
$175. Ambulances provided by the fire depart-

ment, business inspections by police and fire de
partments and golf at the city's public courses also
would increase in cost.
Police plan to charge citizens responsible for false
burglar alarms. Households and businesses would be
charged $100 a call after one free false alarm a year.
Police respond to 60,000 alarms a year, 96 percent of
which are false.
District Attorney Terence Mailman recommended
increasing the tuition fees for the First lime Offend
er Program, a class for people caught soliciting pros
titutes. The program costs $500 now, but Hallinan's
proposal would change it to a $100-$ 1,000 sliding
scale based on the offender's ability to pay.
I fapproved by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors,
the fee hikes would go into effect July 1. I hey are expect
ed to bring the city an additional $7 million annually.
