1950
On May 10, 1950, The Daily printed a col
umn about the pros and cons of living on (he
Row lor women.
"For (lie women considering life on the
Row, there are two measures to be balanced.
"()n one side of the scale are the Row's ad
vantages of small groups, informal spirit, and
numerous activities. Opposing these are the
weights of responsibility, duties, and some
what crowded living conditions. .. .
"The houses have their own looking facil
ilies. In some, these are open to the girls;
while in others they are not. In most, the girls
may wear pajamas to breakfast, though Quad
clothes are required for other meals.
"Kach house has facilities for washing and
ironing, though none has an automatic wash
er. Some of the houses have the added con
vention of switchboards, while in others
callers just yell.
"Special services, such as water softeners
and sheet laundry, account for higher dues in
some of the houses. The average dues are $5
to $10 per quarter.
"The houses take turns each quarter hous
ing a student under the University foreign
scholarship program. Other functions of the
Row as a whole include the annual Row
dance and Row carnival, a scholarship
awarded each year to a Row resident, and,
frequently, entrance in campus float parades
and other events.
Bottom Line: Girls are now allowed to wear their pa
jamas to breakfast in all Row houses.
