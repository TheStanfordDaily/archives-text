When a group of New England ex
plorers set sail more than 200 years
ago, they brought hack souvenirs from
the indigenous people they encountered,
hoping to inspire later generations.
Founded in 1799, the East India
Marine Society had gathered so many
baskets, masks, blankets, headdresses,
weapons and other American Indian
items that they established a museum
in Salem, Massachusetts, 26 years
later just to keep it all.
The Peabody Essex Museum now
has more than 20,000 pieces in its Na
tive American collection, and can dis
play only a fraction of them — one of
several injustices curators of a new
exhibit at Stanford University are
hoping to counteract.
A hundred items collected from the
indigenous peoples of North and
South America are... on view
through Aug. 11 at the Iris £s? B. Ger
ald Cantor Center for Visual Arts.
