# Report assesses cost of smoking
## Harms may not be as high as ads claim 
### SEAN MOONEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
We've all seen television ads with
groups of young people placing body
bags iu front of a tobacco company's
headquarters. Smoking is in the news, in
advertising, and in the hands of activists:
they claim smoking kills an average of
440,000 people per year and cigarettes
contain arsenic, ammonia and nicotine.
On April 12, the Centers for Disease
Control released a widely published re
port on the economic costs of smoking.
The report estimates that society bears a
burden of $7.18 per pack of cigarettes
smoked; $3.45 is incurred due to medical
costs and the remaining $3.73 is due to
lost productivity from premature death.
The public service ads seen on TV in
California often come from a group that
advertises a Web site called
"thetruth.com." Thetruth.com is spon
sored by The American Legacy Founda
tion, which was established and is almost
entirely funded by the 1998 settlement
between tobacco companies and state
governments.
One of the ads promoted by the site
shows people on a crowded summer
beach. Small planes are shown above,
pulling banners that ask "What's in ciga
rette smoke?" followed by "arsenic, car
bon monoxide and ammonia," then
"formaldehyde, styrene, lead" and
"polonium 210, cadmium, cyanide."

With the danger that cigarettes pose,
one would expect scientists to applaud
these advertisements. However, certain
scientists speak out against the en ant use
of these statistics. Toxicology Professor
John Corrod at the University of Essex in
England is a longtime researcher of to
bacco's components. He has regularly
opposed the use of misleading statistics
in the tobacco debate.
"I don't smoke or use tobacco prod
ucts. What I object to is zealots bending
the truth in order to make a point," he
said. According to Corrod, some of the
statistics being reported are misleading.
"The level of ammonia is not at a level
to be toxic. Just about every food we have
contains arsenic,"said Corrod in a Web
site promoted by the British Broadcast
ing Company.
Corrod explained that elements such
as lead, arsenic and cadmium are not
added to cigarettes, and the metals are in
concentrations unlikely to be toxic.
"The most likely toxic substances are
likely to be the aromatic hydrocarbons
and the nitrosamines. These [sub
stances], either working alone or in con
junction with any other chemical, can
cause cancer. For that reason we
shouldn't smoke. But to bring up these
other substances is nonsense," he said.
"Smoking is nasty, dirty, anti-social
and dangerous if it is done with a high
enough level of intake and often
enough," he said.
However, Gorrod's mission is not
about being for or against the tobacco
industry.
"What I'm after is the truth,"he said.

Both sides of the tobacco debate base
their claims on scientific facts.
Thetruth.com's Web site states that its
"only objective is that every person get to
know the facts about tobacco."
The tobacco industry has a long histo
ry of quoting dubious statistics. In an
episode of the original radio version of
"Dragnet" aired on October 26,1952, an
official-sounding man claiming to be a
doctor triumphantly announced that
Chesterfield cigarettes are safe.
I he radio episode concluded with
Jack Webb's familiar voice saying "You
should know, Chesterfield is first to give
you scientific data in support of smoking.
Nose, throat and accessory organs [are]
not adversely affected by Chesterfields—
the first such report ever published by
any cigarette."
More recently in 1994, Jeffrey
Wigand exposed several deceptive prac
tices being performed at Brown &
Williamson Tobacco Company, and his
story became the basis for the popular
movie " The Insider."
"Most people lie quite often with
out realizing it. For scientists who in
teract in the discourse of scientific re
search, they have to be extra careful
to be aware of when [dishonesty] oc
curs in the scientific arena," said Jon
Dugan, a doctoral student in biomed
ical informatics.
However, Dugan raised the impor
tant concern that criticizing anti-tobacco
programs will lessen the weight of their
message. He cautioned that this message
is helpful to society and only a subset of
the ads is truly misleading.
