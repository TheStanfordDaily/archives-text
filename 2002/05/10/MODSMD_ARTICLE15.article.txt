# Two special fees approved
## Senate debates special fees mishap and overseas Senator Iwanaga 
### JOHN HUETTER EDITORIAL STAFF 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate met
Tuesday night and discussed the seeming
ly never-ending ASSU election and how to
deal with senators going abroad.
Elections Commissioner Cedioen
Aloula, a junior, introduced a bill to take
care of the special fee ballot problem.
Special fee candidates Stanford Mock
Trial and SCBN both failed to receive Spe
cial Fee funding in April's election. But the
two groups were originally left off the elec
tion ballot for between one to four hours
until the error was noticed and fixed.
Though the groups statistically weren't
likely to have passed, Aloula said, it was
noted at the meeting those voting in the ini
tial election hours are more likely to have
different voting patterns than the rest of
the voters.
Aloula said that there was a "special
buffer fund" to fund groups mistakenly
left off the ballot, and his bill called for the
fund to pay off the groups' special fee re
quests. The fund has enough money to
meet both groups' special fees requests,
said .ASSU Financial Manager David Fn
delman, a senior.
Senators Howard Chiou and Joey Na
toli, both freshmen, questioned whether or
not the money should be used to fund a
group that failed and statistically would
have failed in its request.
"Some groups, it's questionable

whether or not people would fund them,"
Natoli said.
But Aloula said that the commission,
and therefore the ASSU, had to take re
sponsibility for leaving the groups off
the ballot.
"That's beyond [the Election Com
mission's] scope," he said. "Our job is
only to report what happened, and go in
and fix it."
Endelman and Senator Brigitte Zim
merman, a freshman, supported giving
112 unds to the groups.
"This type of occurrence should be pret
ty anomalous," Endelman said. "You don't
have to worry ... that we're shooting our
selves in the f<>ot [financially]."
"1 think that we essentially have to pass
this," Zimmerman said. "We're making up
for our mistake .. . We'll never, ever have
to deal with this issue if we don't screw up."
The bill passed 11-1-1.
Discussion arose as well over Senator
Hiro Iwanaga, a junior, who is currently
studying abroad in Japan. The outgoing
Senate passed a bill "strongly discourag
ing" Senators from going abroad, calling
the act a "direct violation of the two-ab
sence policy as stated in the Undergradu
ate Senate By-Laws."
1 lowever, the going-abroad policy was
never incorporated into the by-laws,
which in fact state that three unexcused
absences shall immediately expel a sena
tor, though there is little record of this
rule being enforced.
Despite the last Senate's stance, the new
Senate should feel free to make up its own
mind on the issue, said Vice-President Nick
Rodriguez, a sophomore.
