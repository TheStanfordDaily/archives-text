Get ready tomorrow fora
Spring 2002 Intramural Tourna
ment â€”but don't expect a football
or basketball game. This is a game
for the mind.
The College Bowl Club is hold
ing its annual competition, where
students in teams of four compete
to buzz in and answer toss-up
quest ions in various categories.
The event is designed to raise
awareness about the club. All stu
dents on campus are invited to
participate and the club hopes to
recruit new members.
The questions for tomorrow's
"scrimmage" will come from such
categories as science, history, cur
rent events, general knowledge,
sports, fine arts and pop culture.
"1 think that most teams will
have a lot of fun playing in the
tournament," said freshman
Waynn Lue, the club's president
for next year. "The questions are
fairly easy and cover fields that
Stanford students are interested."

Teams are advised to choose
members with different areas of
knowledge, said senior Mark
long, last year's club president.
"It's possible to have questions
on Angola politics, molecular biol
ogy, neoclassical architecture and
punk rock covered in a single
match," Tong said.
Around 10 to 20 teams usually
participate each year in the event,
and each team comes up with ec
centric names like the "Frosoco In
terstellar Overdrive," "Thunder
chickens X" and "Sex Toyon," ac
cording to Tong.
Most members of the College
Bowl Club are not directly partici
pating in the tournament, but are
running the event instead. Some
members will compete as part ol
another group, such as a dorm,
frat, or other campus groups.
The College Bowl emerged
from the TV show "College Bowl"
that aired from the 1950s to the 70s
and it has grown to a nationwide
network of colleges with teams that
practice year-round. The club's
members range from freshmen to

graduate students.
Three members from the Stanford
College Bowl Club have competed
in the "Jeopardy! College Tourna
ment of Champions," including
sophomore Vinita Kailasanath, who
won first place last fall.
The club competes in high
school matches and on-campus
tournaments, as well as intercolle
giate events. Grant Gavranovic, a
first-year graduate student in
chemical engineering, comment
ed on how he enjoys playing
against other colleges.
In addition, he said, the club of
fers students a chance to travel.
"We have attended tourna
ments in Los Angeles, Seattle and
Boston," Gavranovic said.
I le also said he believes it is a
great way to expand his knowl
edge in many topics.
"Stanford College Bowl is an
opportunity for me to learn about
other fields outside the realm of
my scientific curriculum," Gavra
novic said.
