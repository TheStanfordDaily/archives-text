## The 						Stanford Daily Faculty diversity not just a numbers game 
### 
Published Since 1891

Calls tor increased diversity among
Stanford faculty members have be
come a hardy perennial on campus.
University President John Hennessy
opened his term with a new plan to diversity
the faculty, making proposals to the Faculty
Senate last spring that sounded remarkably
like those advanced by his predecessor, Ger
hard Casper. Student groups like the Black
Student Union have been pressing for more
minority professors for years, while others,
such as the Faculty Diversity Task Force, have
joined the fray more recently.
Doubtless, the effort to diversify Stanford's
faculty, and the debate over how best to do so,
will go on. We believe it should. At this point,
however, several things seem clear.
First and foremost, the drive to recruit
more minority faculty members should be
viewed as part of the University's broader ef
fort to bring the best scholars to Stanford. Di

versifying the faculty is a complex undertak
ing, and must not be reduced to a facile num
bers game. At the same time, the University
can make great progress by continuing to ex
pand recruitment efforts and de-centralize
the faculty search process.
Talented academics do not simply show up at
Stanford. They are recruited by department
committees, the provost's office, or even indi
vidual professors. The search fora new faculty
member can be difficult when departments are
looking to meet a need in one specific area of
one particular field. Depending on the field,
finding qualified candidates of any race can be
challenging, which is why an extensive search
process is vitally important.
Outstanding minority candidates are
often available, but need to be sought out.
Stanford considers itself one of the finest uni
versities in the nation. It should have the
widest faculty search program in the nation,

and it should continue to provide resources
and incentives to departments for recruiting
minority candidates.
Individual professors should be encour
aged to contact professors of color who they
meet at panels or conferences away from Stan
ford and become more active contributors to
the recruitment effort.
However, Stanford administrators, profes
sors and students ought to avoid the temptation
to treat the recruitment process as a numbers
game. The goal should be to bring the most
qualified, talented teachers to campus, of what
ever race or ethnic background. Trying to force
the percentage of minority faculty members to
match the percentage of minority students is ar
bitrary and counterproductive.
Relatively few Stanford students will choose
academia as a career, and the racial distribution
of those who do will not necessarily correspond
to the racial distribution of the general student

population or the general U.S. population.
There is no reason to think that since minorities
compose 46 percent of the undergraduate stu
dent body at Stanford, they will therefore com
pose 46 percent of the available candidates for
tenured faculty positions.
Further, lumping together all minority
professors as "faculty of color" who face simi
lar obstacles to employment can be mislead
ing. Minority representation in certain fields
is strong and growing, as in the applied sci
ences and medicine. This is mainly because
there are far more highly qualified minority
applicants for engineering and medical facul
ty positions than there are for, say, professors
of philosophy.
Stanford should not hire faculty of color
simply to meet some undefined standard.
Rather, the University should continue its ef
forts hire the best professors while expanding
its search to find those who are minorities.
