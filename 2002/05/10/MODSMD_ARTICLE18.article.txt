## Life after the presidency 
### 
Qp m here is nothing more pathetic
in life," said John Quincy
Adams, "than a former presi
-JL. dent." The 1800s must have
been a less pathetic century.
But still, what is a president of the Unit
ed States to do when he's no longer pres
ident? When he no longer has reporters
following his every move, no longer leads
the nation and no longer has the power to
destroy civilization?
Leaving office is probably a little like
Commencement, with all the feelings of nos
talgia and anticipation that come with that
event, all the opportunity for dedicating
oneself to a new cause — except that only
one man passes at a time, only 41 men giv
ing up the White 1 louse and Air Force One
instead of a dorm room and the Marguerite.

Of the living ex-presi
dents, all but Jimmy
Carter have made earn
ing money — rightly or
wrongly, in easy above
board ways or easy ques
tionable ways — a major
piece of their post-presi
dential routines.
Gerald Ford set the

precedent by joining a number of corporate
boards and charging hefty sums for speech
es. Ronald Reagan, sadly, did not have much
time between the expiration of his eight
years in office and the ravages of Alzheimer's
disease, but his two successors have lx>th fol
lowed and expanded upon Ford's lead.
George Herbert Walker Bush, proud
father of the current president, reportedly
charges $1 ()(),()()() per speech outside the
country and around $80,000 per domestic
speech. I Ie also has worked for the Carlyle
Group, which, based between the White
House and the Gapitol, also employs for
mer Secretary of State James Baker, for
mer British Prime Minister John Major
and former Philippines President Fidel
Ramos. The company's mission is "to be
come the premier global private equity
fund." Bush's work to further Garlyle's
goals has included visits with the Grown
Prince of Saudi Arabia and the Prime Min
ister of South Korea.
Bill Clinton has hit the speaking circuit
and also pulled down a book contract worth
more than $10 million. I le doesn't seem to
Ix* t<k> sure of what he wants to do yet, but
he's been in the news recently because of re
ports that he might be hosting a talk show
on NBG, removing ex-president lectures
from the exclusive realm of the wealthy and
taking them to the masses. Who says ()prah
Winfrey can't l>e replaced?
Jimmy Garter is different from all of
them. "I think it's inappropriate for an ex-
President to be involved in the commercial
world," he said after his defeat in the I OHO
election. "There may be some kinds of
Ix'nevolent or non-profit corporation in
which I will let my influence and ability be
used, but not in a profit-making way."
I le has stuck by that pledge. If the elder

Bush is like the business major who goes to
New York to work hard in the world of fi
nance after graduation, and if Clinton is
like the guy who is trying to escape his ram
bunctious and shadowed c ollege past, then
Carter is the one who just doggedly keeps
trying to change the world.
Carter has visited 120 countries after leav
ing the White House. He's written several
well-received books. He made Habitat for
Humanity an internationally known force.
The Carter Center he founded with
Emory University in Atlanta has worked
hard to fight disease and oppression. In
1994, during the tense U.S. standoff with
North Korea over nuclear technology,
(barter visited that country and helped bro
ker a peaceful solution. Also in 1994, lie
headed a delegation to Haiti that formulat
ed a deal by which a violent U.S. invasion of
that island was avoided.
I lie (barter Center has observed numer
ous elections around the world, including
recently in East Timor. After the 2000 elec
tion, he, along with Ford, headed a com
mission that examined the debacle and
came up with a proposal for election re
forms.
This Sunday, Carter will be going to
Cuba at the invitation of Fidel Castro, with
the stipulation that he will have unfettered
access to the Cuban people and will be able
to make a nationally televised speech.
Some criticize Carter's freelance diplo
macy as being skewed in favor of dictators
and elite interests, saying his moralistic
words and upstanding media image just
mask his slant. Regardless of one's view,
though, that's some retired life. I le's doing
more after his presidency than many presi
dents did during theirs.
At his appearance for the inaugural
Michael Oksenberg Lecture Monday — be
sides recounting anecdotes such as the time
I)eng Xiaoping's wife had to be rescued from
an Alaskan bathroom — he continued can
didly speaking out for his world vision. With
out prompting, he blasted t he given rationale
for missile defense. 1 le called the embargo on
Cuba "counterproductive," saying it makes
"11 million suffer... and gives Castro some
one to blame." I le voiced his deep concern
about the plight of oft-ignored Tiljet.
(barter's presidential accomplishments
included the Camp David accord, the
Panama Canal Treaty, and establishment
of full diplomatic relations with China, but
his term also saw America struggle through
an oil ci isis, a recession, and a hostage crisis.
When he was, in his words, "prematurely
retired," he had an approval rating just 34
percent, and his career average approval
rating was lower than even Nixon's.
Carter's life after his "graduation" from
the presidency has been something else —
definitely not "pathetic," and at least giving
him plenty to talk about at reunions.
