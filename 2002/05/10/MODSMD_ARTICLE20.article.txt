Hindu Students Council should address
situation in Gujarat
As an organization claiming to increase
awareness of Hindu beliefs, the Hindu
Students Council cannot sidestep its re
sponsibility to respond to the current com
munal unrest in Gujarat.
India's secular-democratic-constitu
tional order has been assaulted and the
foundations of its plural, diverse and
multi-cultural society shaken by elements
claiming to represent the I lindu majority.
Does the Hindu Students Council sub
scribe to the views of these elements or is it
willing to take a stand and speak out
against the distortion of I lindu beliefs by a
fundamentalist minority?
In response to an attack on a train car
rying Hindu karsevaks that claimed 50
lives, communal unrest has broken out in
Gujarat — and no move has been made to
check the violence which has claimed
thousands of Muslim lives and displaced
hundreds of thousands of innocents. A
policy of retaliation by the religious major
ity has been condoned, even encouraged
— as is evident in irresponsible remarks
such as these:
• "Wherever Muslims are living they
don't want to live in harmony. They don't
mix with society, they are not interested in
living in peace" — Prime Minister A. B.Va
jpayee.
• "Fifty million people have become ag
gressive and there was a spontaneous and
natural reaction." — Gujarat c hief minis
ter Narendra Modi.
• " There is nothing new in all that has
happened in Gujarat.. . . Are ilu- killings,
murders and rapes taking place lot the
first time?" — Defense Minister George
Fernandes.
TheSangh Parivar(RSS-VIIP-Bajrang
Dal-BJP), suspected to be instrumental in
fanning the communal riots, claim to rep
resent the Hindu majority. I heir policies
however are anti-democratic to the core.

This is what 11 edge war, founder of the
RSS, had to say: "I have thought out a
scheme based on Hindu Dharm Shastra,
which provides for standardization of
Hinduism throughout India.... But the
point is that this ideal cannot be brought, to
effect unless we have our own Swaraj with
a Mussolini or Hit ler of the present day in
Italy and Germany. But this does not
mean that we have to sit with folded hands
until some dictator arises in India. We
should formulate a scientific scheme and
carry on propaganda for it."
I would like to believe that the vast ma
jority of Hindus do not subscribe to these
provocative and bigoted views. However,
I would like to hear so from an organiza
tion meant to represent I findu students at
Stanford, especially in light of opinion ex
pressed by several South Asian commen
tators that nou resident-Indian backing is
strong for these right-wing fundamental
ist I findu groups.
The Hindu Students Council at Stan
ford would be shirking its responsibility if
it did not clarify its stance.

South Asia should address 'intolerance'
This is in response to Nil in Bakshi's let
let in The Daily.
He claims that the annals of history
would corroborate his belief in the toler
ance of Indians and Hindus, and yet, I
would believe that history would, in fact,
support an opposing claim. All we need to
peer at is the bloodbath of India and Pak
istan's partition, less than a century ago,
for us to question the tolerance of South
Asian communities as a whole.
And sadly, wars and bloodbaths did not
end then — within the last ten years, we
have seen deadly riots in Bombay,
"human torches" in (>ujarat, Muslim per

secution in India, and Hindu persecution
in Bangladesh.
I find it rather amusing and tragic that
the media is now accused of being hyper
sensitive to the acts of Hindus — amusing
since many Muslims and Jews I have met
feel exactly the same way when it comes to
their own religion.
Though the validity of such claims
should be put to the test, my own impres
sion is that it is far easier to blame the
media and accuse it of biases than to ana
lyze what it has to say, and make room for
internal criticism.
(liven the death tolls we are seeing in
India, bomb blasts in Shi'ite mosques in
Pakistan, and the recent rape of Hindu
women in a village in Bangladesh, I think
South Asians are way overdue in realizing
our deadly sins, and figuring out ways out
of this insanity.
If something looks like intolerance, kills
like intolerance, and breeds hate like in
tolerance, it's probably intolerance. Let's
not c all it something else.

Stanford students must learn how to bike
Stanford students may have had 4.0
GPAs in high school and scored a 1590 on
their SATs, but when it comes to the basic
ability of riding their bicycles, they're com
plete idiots. Now don't get me wrong. I'm
not one of those irritating law students
gunning around campus in a BMW mow
ing clown bikers. I bike most every day
from the CalTrain station to the Law
Sc hool. But when I see my fellow bicyclists
daily endanger their lives and the lives of
others with their inane moves, I'm
ashamed to be on two wheels.
Where shall I start? Oh yes, how about
