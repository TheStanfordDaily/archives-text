Hindu Students Council should address
situation in Gujarat
As an organization claiming to increase
awareness of Hindu beliefs, the Hindu
Students Council cannot sidestep its re
sponsibility to respond to the current com
munal unrest in Gujarat.
India's secular-democratic-constitu
tional order has been assaulted and the
foundations of its plural, diverse and
multi-cultural society shaken by elements
claiming to represent the I lindu majority.
Does the Hindu Students Council sub
scribe to the views of these elements or is it
willing to take a stand and speak out
against the distortion of I lindu beliefs by a
fundamentalist minority?
In response to an attack on a train car
rying Hindu karsevaks that claimed 50
lives, communal unrest has broken out in
Gujarat — and no move has been made to
check the violence which has claimed
thousands of Muslim lives and displaced
hundreds of thousands of innocents. A
policy of retaliation by the religious major
ity has been condoned, even encouraged
— as is evident in irresponsible remarks
such as these:
• "Wherever Muslims are living they
don't want to live in harmony. They don't
mix with society, they are not interested in
living in peace" — Prime Minister A. B.Va
jpayee.
• "Fifty million people have become ag
gressive and there was a spontaneous and
natural reaction." — Gujarat c hief minis
ter Narendra Modi.
• " There is nothing new in all that has
happened in Gujarat.. . . Are ilu- killings,
murders and rapes taking place lot the
first time?" — Defense Minister George
Fernandes.
TheSangh Parivar(RSS-VIIP-Bajrang
Dal-BJP), suspected to be instrumental in
fanning the communal riots, claim to rep
resent the Hindu majority. I heir policies
however are anti-democratic to the core.

This is what 11 edge war, founder of the
RSS, had to say: "I have thought out a
scheme based on Hindu Dharm Shastra,
which provides for standardization of
Hinduism throughout India.... But the
point is that this ideal cannot be brought, to
effect unless we have our own Swaraj with
a Mussolini or Hit ler of the present day in
Italy and Germany. But this does not
mean that we have to sit with folded hands
until some dictator arises in India. We
should formulate a scientific scheme and
carry on propaganda for it."
I would like to believe that the vast ma
jority of Hindus do not subscribe to these
provocative and bigoted views. However,
I would like to hear so from an organiza
tion meant to represent I findu students at
Stanford, especially in light of opinion ex
pressed by several South Asian commen
tators that nou resident-Indian backing is
strong for these right-wing fundamental
ist I findu groups.
The Hindu Students Council at Stan
ford would be shirking its responsibility if
it did not clarify its stance.

South Asia should address 'intolerance'
This is in response to Nil in Bakshi's let
let in The Daily.
He claims that the annals of history
would corroborate his belief in the toler
ance of Indians and Hindus, and yet, I
would believe that history would, in fact,
support an opposing claim. All we need to
peer at is the bloodbath of India and Pak
istan's partition, less than a century ago,
for us to question the tolerance of South
Asian communities as a whole.
And sadly, wars and bloodbaths did not
end then — within the last ten years, we
have seen deadly riots in Bombay,
"human torches" in (>ujarat, Muslim per

secution in India, and Hindu persecution
in Bangladesh.
I find it rather amusing and tragic that
the media is now accused of being hyper
sensitive to the acts of Hindus — amusing
since many Muslims and Jews I have met
feel exactly the same way when it comes to
their own religion.
Though the validity of such claims
should be put to the test, my own impres
sion is that it is far easier to blame the
media and accuse it of biases than to ana
lyze what it has to say, and make room for
internal criticism.
(liven the death tolls we are seeing in
India, bomb blasts in Shi'ite mosques in
Pakistan, and the recent rape of Hindu
women in a village in Bangladesh, I think
South Asians are way overdue in realizing
our deadly sins, and figuring out ways out
of this insanity.
If something looks like intolerance, kills
like intolerance, and breeds hate like in
tolerance, it's probably intolerance. Let's
not c all it something else.

Stanford students must learn how to bike
Stanford students may have had 4.0
GPAs in high school and scored a 1590 on
their SATs, but when it comes to the basic
ability of riding their bicycles, they're com
plete idiots. Now don't get me wrong. I'm
not one of those irritating law students
gunning around campus in a BMW mow
ing clown bikers. I bike most every day
from the CalTrain station to the Law
Sc hool. But when I see my fellow bicyclists
daily endanger their lives and the lives of
others with their inane moves, I'm
ashamed to be on two wheels.
Where shall I start? Oh yes, how about
the fact that so many Stanford bicyclists
seem to think that the laws of physics,
gravity ancl traffic safety do not apply to
them, and thus they can race through in
tersections without the slightest aware
ness of cars, signals, or stop signs, because
the cars and trucks driving through cam
pus will screech to a halt on a dime for
them, right?
Or how about the fashion-first, "I'm so
hard-headed that these precious brain
cells don't need no stinkin' helmet" stu
dents who need to feel the air through
their hair? Unfortunately, asphalt pave
ments and concrete curbs don't realize
that your brain is working on the cure for
cancer or the newest interpretation of
bell hooks' feminist theory, and are full
equal-opportunity sources of head in
juries, concussions, or worse. Besides, do
you really want the hassle of dealing with
getting Cardinal Care to cover your
brain surgery?

Maybe I'm just being an old dorky-hel
met-wearing grad student who's cranky
about finals, and is nagging you like your
mom, but please, if you ride a bike around
campus, just slow down for once, and con
sider what those red octagonal signs might
be telling you.
Here's a hint: "STOP." lest (he firm
ness of the curbs and pavement with your
foot and think what it might feel like to
have your head smash on it at 20 m.p.h.
You really don't want to end up being an
other four-paragraph article, or worse,
obituary, in The Stanford Daily, over
something so stupid as not yielding or
wearing a helmet.

Third-year Uiw Student
Former ASSU officer responds to Crosetto
1 would like to correct Patrick Croset
to's claim in Thursday's Daily that an "ille
gal" act was committed against him by the
ASSU Election Commission. The "regula
tions" cited by Crosetto apply only to the
undergraduate senators and Graduate

Student Council members, as he was pre
viously informed. In fact, the Elections
Commission was under no technical obli
gation to respond to Crosetto's objections
at all, and did so only out of courtesy.
There are well-established procedures
for handling objections of this sort, but
Crosetto's confrontational approach made
it difficult for him to listen to and under
stand those who attempted any explana
tions.
Crosetto was defeated by his own igno
rance of the process and rules, by the inco
herence of his objections, and by his own
impatience, not by improper behavior of
any ASSU officer. Civen the constraints of
the job and despite a few crises, the Elec
tions Commission has done relatively well
this year.
Crosetto, who has received much atten
tion in the pages of The Daily recently, is
clearly an individual of high energy and
strong moral conviction. I would like to
encourage him to focus that energy on one
of the world's many more pressing social
problems.

Hindu Student Council not undermining
'important issues'
This letter is in response to Ashwini
Deo's letter to the editor in yesterday's
Daily. First off, I would like to point out
that the authors of the last two letters at
tacking Hindu Students Council never at
tended the events they were criticizing, a
reflection of their "informed" opinion.
Commenting from the perspective of an
attendee of these events, I want to stress
that council is not undermining other im
portant issues by exposing injustices
against Hindus.
Deo commented on Professor
Damodar Sardesai's talk entitled "Hindus
as Minorities" claiming that the organiz
ers are undermining the greater political
environment in India, namely Hindu mil
itants' killing of innocent minorities in
India. However, 1 do not feel Sardesai's talk
undermined the cause to educate the
greater community of historical patterns in
human rights violations. 1 do not see what is
inherently wrong with taking an issue, dis
secting it, understanding the social and po
litical catalysts, and then offering one's own
solution based on the historical evidence.

This is precisely what Sardesai attempted
to do. And for this reason, I cannot tell you
how much I valued and enjoyed his talk. He
gave his audience a historical, chronological
perspective of how such minorities formed
(namely the Hindu minority in Bangladesh,
Pakistan, and Kashmir) and possible solu
tions to the inequity. As a Hindu, I feel that
a group such as the Hindu Students Coun
cil has an obligation to discuss issues such as
these, especially since some are rarely
brought up in academia.
While there are various definitions of
minorities, be it linguistic, racial or reli
gious, the nature of the struggle is the same:
namely the peaceful and equal co-existence
between a group of people who hold a com
mon belief and the greater national society.
Discussing the history of one minority
does not undermine the atrocities and dis
crimination committed on another. It is ap
parent through events like these that the
council is attempting to positively educate
the Stanford community about a broad
range of issues during its Hinduism Aware
ness Week.
