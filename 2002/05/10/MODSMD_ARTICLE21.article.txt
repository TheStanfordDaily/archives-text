# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## A 						literary perspective on the travails of University housing 
### 
-011 Wednesday, May 8, I
turned 21, and as a present,
Housing and Dining Services
gave me a hefty 1911 in the
Draw, making the combined numerical
value of my three Draw applications
somewhere over 6350.
While induction into the elite "(>()()()
club" only reinforced the type of behavior
that comes naturally on one's 21st birth
day, Housing and Dining's unexpected
generosity did give me a moment's pause.
I am often concerned that folks at
Housing Assignment Services fail to truly
understand the undergraduate experi
ence, and seeing how we're all avid book
lovers here at Stanford, I thought I'd pro
pose a reading list to better acquaint ad
ministrators with student life.
Anyone interested in what your aver

age Stanford freshman lias on his or her
mind should check out Virginia Woolf's
"A Room of One's Own." If that doesn't
satisfy your curiosity, move on to E. M.
Forster's "A Room With a View."
If you want penetrating insight into the
lives of Wilbur Hall residents, I'd turn first
to Fran/ Kafka's "In the Penal Colony." If
you're more intrigued by Lagunita dou
bles, "'lhe Oblong Box" by Edgar Allen
Poe is worth a look.
I can't speak for all of Cowell Cluster, but
if the architecture of ZAP suits your fancy,
Kafka again comes to mind: " The Castle"
would be a perfect match. If you're curious
what most of us think of Stern Hall's aes
thetic merits, try Reiner Maria Rilke's little
known poem "Put Out My Eyes."
If you're tired of the German thing,
Charles Dickens' "Bleak House" is a won

dei lul introduction to life at Murray, Yost
and Freshman / Sophomore College. If
you're still browsing the Dickens section,
"Hard limes" is popular among seniors
living in Florence Moore I fall.
Everyone stranded in Sharon Green
and Oak Creek without a car has a copy of
Douglas Adams' "Hitchhikers' Guide to the
Galaxy." Those of us blessed with automo
tive transportation have compared trying
to find a C-Permit spot after 8 a.m. to
Fhomas Pynchon's "The Crying of Lot 49."
Of course, some people do get prime
real estate. Residents of the lower are fa
miliar with the Francis Scott Fitzgerald's
first novel, "This Side of Paradise." Hard
core Greeks — who return year after year
to fraternity houses — also enjoy Fitzger
ald, especially his short story "Babylon Re
visited." The more literary Sigma Alpha

Epsilon and Sigma Chi brothers are par
ticularly fond of another E. M. Forster
work: "Where Angels Fear to Tread."
If you want to know what life on the top
floor of Roble is like come spring, don't
forget Dante's "Inferno." If you're curious
what students think of the decision to con
vert Mirrielees from doubles to triples,
John Milton's "Paradise Lost" should do
the trick.
The mood of seniors taking refuge in
Potter for lack of a better option must mir
ror Samuel Taylor Coleridge's state of
mind when he wrote "Dejection: an Ode."
On the other end of the spectrum, life in
Synergy and Enchanted Broccoli Forest
gets a thorough treatment in Tom Wolfe's
"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test."
If you are in the dark about the nature
of social life in Man/anita Park, I'd suggest

Balzac's " The Celibates." If that's to your
taste, keep in mind another Balzac work,
"The Little Miseries of Conjugal Life," for
a sneak peek into Escondido Village.
Finally, if you'd like to get a sense of
how 1 and many other upperclassmen feel
about the prospect of four years of sub-par
housing, I'd head over to the bookstore
and pick up a copy of Jean-Paul Sartre's
"Nausea" before it sells out.
I hope I've inspired some University
officials to spend the summer exploring
the joys of great literature. I'd like to say
I owned a copy of each of the books I've
listed but, regrettably, I don't have
enough room.
