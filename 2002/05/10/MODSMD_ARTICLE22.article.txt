# Palestinians to leave Bethlehem church
## 
### 
BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) â€”The 5
1/2-week standoff at the Church of the Nativ
ity neared an end yesterday with a complex
deal to scatter 13 Palestinian militants among
up to eight countries and clear the way for Is
raeli forces to withdraw from the last West
Bank city they occupy.
But the arrangement reached with Euro
pean negotiators did not spell an end to Pales
tinian-Israeli bloodshed. As the final logistics
were being worked out, Israeli tanks stood
poised outside the CJa/a Strip ahead of an ex
pected retaliatory attack lor a suicide bomb
ing that killed 15 Israelis.
Israel's siege over Christ's reputed birth
place was one of the focal points of its West
Bank invasion, and ending it became an
international clillhanger of on-again, off
again breakthroughs.
With Israel linking the men to terrorism,
finding a country willing to take them has
been a major obstacle to ending the siege at
one of the holiest sites in the Christian world.
A breakthrough came when Cypriot For
eign Minister Yiannakis Cassoulides said his
country would temporarily take in the 13

Palestinians before they were flown to their
final destinations.
A British military aircraft took oil from an
air base in Cyprus about 11 p.m. local time (4
p.m. EDT) for Israel to pic k up the men, said
British officials in (Cyprus, speaking on condi
tion of anonymity. They said two Cypriot po
lice were aboard to escort the Palestinians
back. There was no word on the plane's ar
rival in Israel.
A resolution seemed near on Tuesday but
Italy had balked at taking the 13 militants in
the church whom Israel insists on deporting.
A senior Palestinian official confirmed a
new deal had been reached, but Israeli mili
tary sources said they did not believe the
Palestinians would leave the church until this
morning.
The Italian official, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said the details of the exile
would be worked out at an EU foreign minis
ters meeting in Brussels on Monday.
The United States has been heavily in
volved in trying to end the standoff. The Vat
ican had also taken a leading role, with Pope
John Paul II sending an envoy to the region

and making several pleas lor the Palestinians
and Israelis to end the crisis.
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has come
under strong criticism from other Palestinians
lor agreeing to let the men be deported, the
first time a Palestinian leader has assented to
such a punishment.
The siege at the Church of the Nativity
began April 2, when more than 200 Palestini
ans lied into the shrine ahead of invading Is
raeli forces. In the weeks that followed, sever
al groups of civilians and Palestinian police
men left the compound, leaving 123 people
inside.
Earlier yesterday, Palestinian and Israeli
negotiators said a deal was in place to allow
do/ens of Palestinians to emerge from the
church, leaving behind 13 suspec ted militants
until a country could be found to take them.
A group of 26 suspected gunmen was to
leave the church first yesterday, to be trans
ported to Gaza, and about 80 < ivilians inside
the church would be freed, said ('.apt. Jacob
Dallal, an Israeli army spokesman. The last 13
would remain while negotiators worked to
find a country to take them.
