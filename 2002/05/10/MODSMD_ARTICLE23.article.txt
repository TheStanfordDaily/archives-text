# South Asian student group will host Mela culture day
## 
### RIZWAN SABAR 
Sanskriti, Stanford's South Asian student
group, will present Mela, a showcase of
South Asian and South Asian American cul
ture, on Sunday.
"Mela itself means festival," said senior
Manila Mehta, who will be choreographing
a dance at the event, " l he show will be a cel
ebration of the diverse cultures that are
found in South Asia."
The event will feature an array of perfor
mances that represent cultures from across
the Asian subcontinent, Mehta said.
"We will have pieces that show aspects of
Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan and Bengali
culture and the subcultures that exist within
these countries," Mehta said.
Part of the aim of the program is to ex

press the common and discrete elements of
South Asian culture in a variety of art forms,
said freshman Brinda Thomas.
"The show will feature many different
dance styles, including bharathanatyam,
filmi, raas and bhangra, in addition to
music, videos, singing and skits,"
Thomas said.
Mehta said that constructing the perfor
mances required a balance between authen
ticity and creativity.
"The dance that I helped to choreo
graph, a filmi dance, attempts to show
what the movie industry in India is like,"
Mehta said. "We've taking songs from the
mainstream Indian movies, mixed them
up and choreographed them with more
modern steps."
Freshman Farah Giga said the diverse

group of performers is a testament to the
quality of the show.
"Even though we are representing
South Asian culture, there are quite a few
non-South Asians performing this year,"
Giga said. "We also have performers with
very different levels of experience. Some
people have practiced their particular
dance with a professional instructor for
years, while others have never seen an In
dian dance before."
The event is light-hearted enough to
poke fun at certain aspects of South Asian
American stereotypes, Thomas said.
"We have videos that highlight the fun
nier aspects of being South Asian in the
United States," Thomas said. "Last year
there was a video tracing the journey of two
South Asian boys—one went to UC-Berke

ley, the other went to Stanford. Among
other things, the guy who went to Stanford,
naturally, majored in computer science."
Giga said she enjoyed working on her
performance.
"I learned a lot more about the culture,
and 1 hope the audience has a similarly ex
citing experience," Giga said.
"It will be a very energetic show,"
Thomas said. "We hope that we can enter
tain our audience while giving them an
eclectic taste of South Asian culture."
Mela will take place on Sunday, at Dinkel
spiel Auditorium.
Doors open at 6:30 p.m., and the show
begins at 7 p.m. Pickets will be sold today
in White Plaza from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30
p.m. For more information, go to san
