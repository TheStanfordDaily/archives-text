MENOMONIE, Wis. (AP) —
While shocked and saddened,
those who know suspected mail
box bomber Luke Helder say
there were signs —from drug
use to an uncharacteristic foggy
headedness — that he was trou
bled.
Now some worry that he may
not fully understand the ramifi
cations of the charges he's facing.
During a phone conversation
with his parents, he asked "Mom,
do you think I'll go to jail for
this?" according to the Rev. Den
nis Kampa, the family's priest in
Pine Island, Minn. Helder could
be sentenced to life in prison if
convicted in the bombing spree.
His friends say the 21-year-old
art student cut his shoulder
length blond hair and carried
around a stack of $20 bills last
week before he took oil in his gray
Honda from Menomonie, where
he attended the University of
Wisconsin-Stout.
"Whether he was on drugs or
his mind (lipped, we don't know,"

said Kampa, who spent time with
1 lelder's parents before they flew
to Nevada, where their son was
arrested Tuesday.
Jason Rossow, who went to
high school with Helder and
played on the golf team with him,
said he didn't even recognize
Helder at first when he saw him
wandering aimlessly at an annual
festival in Pine Island last June.
"1 le used to be a normal kid in
the crowd," Rossow said. "Last
summer, he looked lost."
Like many, Rossow remem
bers Helder as someone who
had strong opinions and ideas.
But they weren't the anti-gov
ernment, anti-authority rav
ings that characterized letters
left with pipe bombs from Illi
nois to Texas.
Somehow a darker, stranger
side of 1 lelder seems to have
emerged.
Law enforcement officials
have called Helder polite but also
say he told them he was trying to
distribute the bombs in the shape

of a smiley face. The first 16
bombs were arranged in two cir
cles, one in Illinois and lowa and
the other in Nebraska. On a map,
the circles could resemble the
eyes of the popular 1970s happi
ness symbol. The final two
bombs, found in Golorado and
Texas, form an arc that could be
the beginning of a smile.
Sarah Brown, an ex-girl
friend whose relationship with
Helder ended nine months
ago, told The Gapital limes in
Madison that he was fascinated
with astral projection, or out
of-body experiences, and tried
unsuccessfully to achieve one
several times.
Adam Stowitts, a senior at U W-
Stout, said Helder could be "over
bearing" in class but also had
trouble explaining what he want
ed to say.
"He didn't have the social as
pects to have a two-sided discus
sion," he said. "He had his views
and he was talking, not listening."
He was known for his love of

the grunge band Nirvana and
played in his own band called Ap
athy, causing The Badger Herald
student newspaper in Madison to
run a headline that asked, "Stu
dious Midwestern farm boy or
rock-band anarchist?"
It was the same newspaper
that received a lengthy, rambling
letter from Helder. The letter was
postmarked May 3 in Omaha.
"Wake up people! ... 1 am
taking very drastic measures in
attempt to provide information to
you," he said in the letter.
In it, he also criticized every
thing from government control
and technology to the unequal
distribution of wealth and laws
against marijuana, which he said
gives "mental stimulation."
He also talked about death
and dying. "There is no such
thing as death and fear is not nec
essary," he said.
Rossow, his hometown friend,
says he feels badly for Helder.
"But I feel worse for his fami
ly," he said.
