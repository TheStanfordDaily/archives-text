# Stanford Powwow
## Dancing, celebrating set for 31st powwow 
### KRISTEN BELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Although over 500 Native Ameri
can tribes are indigenous to America
and each has its own distinct tradi
tions and formalities, this weekend
Stanford has the opportunity to ex
perience what one junior and mem
ber of the Navajo tribe calls a Pan-
American "cultural celebration."
Dance is one important way of
celebrating Native American cul
ture. Dancers from across the coun
try will compete — or contest — at
the Stanford Powwow this weekend,
in events like the Men's Fancy
dance, Grass dance, Southern
Straight dance, Men's Traditional,
Fancy Shawl, Jingle Dance, and
Women's Traditional.
Junior Felicia Friz/ell will proba
bly be dancing the Jingle Dance this
weekend. The dance, which is per
formed by women, has a legendary

origin. The dance is often said to be a
gift of healing from the (Creator to the
Ojibwa tribe of Northern Minnesota.
Although the legend differs
among tribes, Friz/ell explained her
interpretation: a man who had a sick
daughter had a vision in which the
sound of a jingling dress would cure
her. Dancers wore the dress and his
daughter was cured.
The jingle dress is made of bright
cloth with seven rows of "jingle
cones." Originally metal lids of
Copenhagen snuff cans, the jingles
are now made of various metals such
as silver or gold. The women wear a
scarf or a choker around their necks
and their hair is done in two braids
pinned to the front of their body with
an intricately beaded barrette.
Some dancers now add fancier ac
couterments to their outfits to attract
attention, Frizzell said. Native Ameri
can culture is "constantly evolving"
said Denni Woodward, associate di

rector of the Native American Cultur
al Center.
The jingle dress comes down to
the knees, displaying form- fitting
leggings and either moccasins or
shoes made of beaded material. The
dress is cut at (he knees so that the au
dience can appreciate the intricate
footwork of the dance.
Friz/.ell described the footwork as
"very controlled and deliberate, light
and graceful... it looks as though
the women are walking on

air . . . floating above the ground."
While dancers' feet move, the upper
body remains straight and still.
During dance contests, judges look
for intricate, controlled footwork that
mirrors the traditional style, harmony
with the drum beat, poise, demeanor,
endurance, and appropriate use of
the eagle feather fan.
Some women have two eagle
leather plumes in their hair as well as

an eagle feather fan. The fan is raised
on the honor beats, which are louder
than other heats in the song, in order lo
bring healing. I lowever, (he most I radi
tional women do not wear eagle feath
ers or carry a fan. They simply raise
their arms on the honor beats.
Moroni Renally, a junior and mem
ber of the Navajo tribe, explained that
eagle feathers play a significant role in
the Navajo culture. A family member,
an elder, or a teacher will give some

one an eagle feather in a ceremonial
setting if that person has earned it. A
person might earn an eagle feather by
"graduating from high school or col
lege, doing something significant for
the community, helping the elderly,
memorizing songs or prayers, or com
municating with a higher source," Be
nally said.
Music is another important element
of the dances. During the jingle dance,
large drums are used. Eric Manolito, a
sophomore Dine (Navajo) said that
drums used in the powwow "were orig
inally clay pots hut are now black stone
kettle drums filled with water and cov
eted with deer hide which is tied down

with stones that look like giant musket
balls." Drummers use their thumbs to
find tones on the drum.
Benally said that for many Native
Americans the "beating of the drum re
sembles the beating of our own hearts
and of Mother Earth."
The drums are used in a number of
different types of songs including darn
ing songs, honor songs, llag songs, and
prayer songs. One particular type of
dancing song is the trick song. Manoli
to said that in the trick songs there is no
steady beat.
When the music stops the dancers
must stop, and when there is singing
without a drum beat, the dancers must

hold their own beat.
In addition to drums, dried squash
gourds attached to cedar sticks make
rattling music.
I he gourds are particularly used in
Gourd Dances. These are ceremonial
dances which arc not judged and are
not to be photographed. Manolito said
that the Gourd Dance "heals ... it is a
celebration for victory."
The gourds themselves carry great
symbolic value which is difficult to ex
plain and varies from tribe to tribe. For
Manolito's tribe, the gourds "connect
us with the gods and are symbols of the
world we live in . . . they are the wind
that blows into us when we're alive."
