## Student support and planning essential to success 
### WAYNN LUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Over 30,000 people from across
the country will converge on campus
this weekend to take part in the annu
al Native American Powwow, spon
sored by the Stanford American Indi
an Organization.
"Organizing the powwow is a year
long process with everything coining to
gether because of a lot of people's devo
tion to it," said volunteer Brooke
Swaney, a junior. "It's really a lot of
work, but it pays off'so much because the
event is important on so many levels.
Members of SAIO are now rushing to
wrap up loose ends and pull everything
together.
"Most [SAIO members] start working

at the beginning of fall quarter to make
Powwow a success in the spring," said
volunteer Moroni Benally, a junior.
"They have a number of tasks, from
committee heads, fundraising, facilities,
publicity, hospitality and ad sales. Each
of them has a lot of work to do."
1 Tie money for the powwow comes
from a variety of sources, like the T
shirts and other apparel that SAK) sells
throughout the year, as well as various
donations from outside sources that
help fund the event.
An additional source of funding
comes 112 rom the 131 vendor booths at the
powwow, a mixture of artists and traders
who pay to host a booth. Food booths
also pay a fee.
Many student volunteers are excited
to participate in the powwow and share
their knowledge and experiences.
"We want to show people what part of
the Native American culture is like," said
Tanya Beatus, a junior who is the head
of the sales committee.
| iliati Gearon, a junior who is co

chair of SAIO and one of the powwow
organizers, agrees. "It's just fun," she
added. "Having this large group of Na
tive American people come together
makes us feel at home."
"Powwow is a great experience," said
Rose Edmonds, a sophomore who vol
unteers with SAIO. "There are so many
native dancers, arts and crafts and a feel
ing of community that makes me feel
good. Volunteering at Powwow makes
me feel like I'm giving a little bit back to
the community."
Though the Native American popu
lation at Stanford is small, the number of
students who want to participate more
than makes up for the size.
" The core planning group consists of
about 20 people," Woodward said. "It's
just a phenomenal event."
In three days the event will be over,
and the stress of preparation will be
gone.
"At the end oft lie day, it [will be] good
to be able to look on all we've done,"
Beatus said. "It's just amazing."
