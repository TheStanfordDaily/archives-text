Freshman Nicole Marquez's ancestry is
so diverse, she could live in three of Stan
ford's ethnic (heme houses. Since she has
been at Stanford, however, she has be
come active mostly with the Stanford
American Indian Organization.
"[SAIO] is the only group that made an
effort to t each out and welcome me," Mar
quez said.
Marque/ participated in a two-night re
treat with other Native American students
before fall classes began, and she now at
tends weekly SAIO meetings and played
on an SAIO intramural basketball team.
She works three days a week at the Native
Americ an Cultural Center, helping to or
ganize events, sn< h as class dinners at
Muwekma-lah-Ruk, the Native Ameri
can theme house.
"I feel like a wanted member of the
community,' 1 ' she said.
I he Native community at Stanford was
not always so vibrant. The first Native

American student, John Milton Oskison,
graduated from Stanford in 1898. Until
1905, there is no record of Native Ameri
can students or faculty at Stanford, but
Stanford did not track ethnicity during
this time.
During the civil rights movement of the
1900 sand 19705, the lack of minorities in
schools and corporations ac ross America
was brought to light, and there was a push
to admit and to hire people of color at
Stanford.
According to Denni Woodward, the as
sociate director of the Native American
Cultural Center, the civil rights movement
gave way to the first big wave of Native
Americans at Stanford.
Twenty-five Native American students
enrolled in 1970. On (X t. 21, loin students
f<>rmed the Stanford American 1 ndian ()r
-ganization. According to the group's Web
site, "the original mission included im
proving the recruitment and retention of
American Indian and Alaska Native stu
dents, staff, and faculty; the institutionaliz

ing of culturally relevant curriculum; the
establishment of a community center and
theme house; and the permanent removal
of the Stanford 'Indian' mascot."
While SAIO has achieved several of
these goals, ii still struggles with others.
"The lack of Native [American] faculty is
still a huge issue," Woodward said. "We've
had several visiting scholars, some post
docs, but few tenured professors."
Since hiring sociology professor
Michael Cox in 2001, Stanford now has
t hree Native American professors.
"It's difficult to have a wide variety of
courses and a broad curriculum when you
don't have faculty," said Matthew Snipp, a
sociology professor and one Stanford's
three Native faculty.
I lie Native American community at
Stanford has, however, made great
progress since SAIO's founding iu 1070.
lu 1072, the Indian mascot was formally
removed.
