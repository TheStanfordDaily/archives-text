# ASB trips cover new ground

Most Stanford students would not even
think of spending their spring break sleep
ing in a tipee or spending a day wrestling
400 sheep to give them vaccination shots.
But that's what 12 students did as part of a
week-long Alternative Spring Break trip to
the Navajo nation in Arizona and New
Mexico.
The trip exposed students to life on the
reservation and the issues that the Native
American people are facing in (lie 21 si
century.
"People at Stanford are really removed
from Native American life," said sopho
more Tashina Ftter, who was the trip's co
leader. "Instead of just talking about it with
them, I want them to actually experience it,
and see life first hand."
Etter recalls a day in class when she said
she was from a reservation and people
were confused.
"One gii l asked if we needed to have
passports to be here," Ftter said. "People
just don't understand our situation at all."
Another Alternative Spring Break trip
traveled to the Mescalero Apache reserva
tion in New Mexico to look at how the
reservation has prospered economically
but has also maintained its heritage. The
trip's co-leader, junior Felicia Frizzell,
wanted to lead the trip because she felt that
people don't understand the issues facing
Native Americans.
"I was surprised at the level of igno
rance people at Stanford have about the
Native American culture," Frizzell said.

"The students at Stanford will l>e in those
positions that will either hurt or help (lie
Native American people in the future. If
we are ignorant, we will hurt them."
The Mescalero trip focused on the eco
nomic issues that are facing that tribe. As
part of the group's preparation, they read
about gaming issues and the rights that the
tribes have. Currently, the tribe is at odds
with the state government concerning the
law.
"We are a people that have a lot of is
sues," Frizzell said. "But we are a strong
people too. I hope that the students saw
that."
The trip participants were able to learn
some of the tribe's language from high
school students on the reservation. Some
of the high school students are at Stanford
this weekend, touring the campus.
"We want to motivate them for college,"
Frizzell said. "Beyond the reservation it's
hard to visit schools. But we need strong
leaders for the future of our reservation."
Frizzell hopes some of them will want to
come to school here and then return to
help out their tribe.
A few students from the Navajo na
tion trip are already building on their ex
periences during spring break to form
relationships with the Navajo nation.
They traveled around the nation and
saw the great disparity in lifestyle among
generations.
"While our younger generation is leav
ing to go get modern jobs, our grandpar
ents are clinging to the traditional way of
life," Filer said.
The group visited Sky City, a village up

on a mesa where there is still no running
water or electricity. One of the trip partici
pants, senior (lusha Pierce, is working on a
communication project that brings tech
nology lo Indian lands.
"I was so touched by the Navajo nation
on my trip that I want to gear my group's
work toward a device that might bring
some help to the people on the reserva
tion," Pierce said.
Pierce's idea is to have a wrist-watch like
device that the elderly people of the nation
could use to keep in contact with the
younger generation. The device would
translate from Navajo to English and vice
versa.
Sophomore Sarita Ocon felt so wel
comed by the Navajos that she wants to re
turn there this summer. Ocon is applying
fora summer internship at Dine College,
the college on the reservation, to work on a
project studying the impact of diabetes in
the Dine (Navajo) community.
Diabetes is a significant health issue in
their nation right now. Ocon would also
work on developing a diabetes awareness
curriculum to teach to Navajo children
and adults.
