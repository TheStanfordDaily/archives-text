# Muwekma supports students

### CYNTHIA CHO EDITORIAL STAFF 
Muwekma-Tah-Ruk, which means
"House of the People" in the Muwekma lan
guage, is one of four ethnic theme houses on
campus. The house is named in honor of the
Muwekma Ohlone tribe, whose members are
the original inhabitants of San Francisco and
the surrounding Bay Area.
Currently there are 29 residents in Muek
ma and half are of Native American descent.
Muwekma is the only Row house that houses
freshman; there are eight freshmen living in
the house this year.
Marlon Footracer, a freshman, said that lie
wanted to live in Muwekma "to be a part of a
close, intimate community in an environment
in which [he] could express [himself] both
academically and culturally." Footracer will
return to Muwekma next year as the social
manager.
This atmosphere of a close-knit communi
ty is one that the house staff and residents
have strived to create. Junior Amanda Cross,
one of the two ethnic theme associates, said
that one of the goals of the house is to devel
op a "supportive community for Native
American students at Stanford."
Cross also described the house as a place
for the "exchange of knowledge" about Na
tive American culture, history and current
issues. This year, Cross and junior Willow
Miller-Young, the other ethnic theme asso
ciate, have offered a required course for all
residents.
"The course is a really good way for every
one to learn about issues that affect the Native
American community," Cross said.

The goal of the course is to expose resi
dents to both historical background infor
mation on Native Americans and to issues
that affect the Native American population
today.
This quarter students have discussed a
chapter of Sherman Alexie's book "The
Toughest Indian in the World" and compar
ing the sovereignty of Native Americans,
Canadian First Nation peoples, Australian
Aborigines, and the New Zealand Maori.
"I was not aware of contemporary Native
American literature or of Stanford's history of
Native Americans on campus [before taking
the seminar]," Footracer said.
There is also a myriad of other events
and activities for the residents. Sophomore
Jerry Simmons, the current social manager,
said that he tries to organize events that ad
dress cultural and social issues that affect
both Native American student life and stu
dent life in general.
Simmons, who lived in the house last year,
said that Muwekma is an especially important
place for freshmen.
"The house provides an invaluable sup
pott group of peers and upperclassmen, as
well as access to numerous resources on cam
pus," he said. "For many of the freshmen who
come from small, rural communities, it is im
portant to come to Stanford and become a
part of a similar tight-knit community." He
w ill be returning to the house fora third year
as the peer health educator.
Many of the residents will be participat
ing or volunteering at the powwow this
weekend. Simmons and a fellow resident
will lead a group to speak to attendees about
how cultural values affect medical care.
