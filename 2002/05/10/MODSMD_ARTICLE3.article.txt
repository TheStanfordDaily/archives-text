Many groups at Stanford have cultural
expositions, but none is as large as the
Stanford Powwow.
It is a product of the hard work of the
Stanford American Indian Organization,
but many campus groups help to make the
event possible.
The powwow is an annual event that
draws 30,000 people of all ethnicities to
Stanford and allows them to see and par
ticipate in a variety of aspects of Native
American culture.
"It is a way [for (he Native American
community] to share their culture and a
part of their identity with others. It is not
an event of exclusion, rather one of inclu
sion," said junior Moroni Benally, the stu
dent organizer of the event.
In fact, the Powwow has always had a
strong focus on the outside community.

"Native students still feel that Powwow is a
way to educate the Stanford community
and the greater Stanford area about the Na
tive Americans on c ampus," Benally said.
The powwow was started in 1970
with this goal, but also with the goal of
making the relatively few native stu
dents feel at home. In the past 80 years,
the Powwow has become the focus event
of SAIO as well as the largest student
run event on campus.
The theme of this year's powwow is
"We Dance With Peace In Our Hearts,
Fire In Our Eyes, & Rage In Our Feet!".
It will feature a variety of different events
for all ages.
A unique aspect of this year's powwow
is that it marks the 30th anniversary of the
change in the Stanford mascot. In 1972,
former University President Richard W.
Lyman officially changed the mascot 112 rom
the Stanford Indian to the Stanford Car
dinal because he found the Indian offen

sive to Native Americans. SAlOhad lob
bied for this change.
The celebration itself will begin each
clay with a Grand Entry of the participants
in the powwow. Sunday, a closing song will
cap the festivities.
()ne important event is the Annual Fun
Run, a 5-kilometer race and 1-mile
walk/run. There will be several age cate
gories and the overall male and female
winners will win traditional awards.
Dance also makes up a large part of the
festival. Native American dancers from all
over the country will perform traditional
dances from several cultures throughout
the three-day event. Spectators are even
welcome to join in.
Native American artwork and crafts
are another powwow attraction. Vendors
will set up booths in the Eucalyptus
Grove area for people to browse and buy
