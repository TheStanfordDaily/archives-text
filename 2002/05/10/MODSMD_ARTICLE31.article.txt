# Women aim at NCAAs
## Women's water polo looks to snag NCAA crown that eluded team last year 
### KIM ROBERTS STAFF WRITER 
Since the beginning of the 2001 season,
the Stanford women's water polo team has
lost only three games. But one of those
losses came in last year's NCAA champi
onship game and another came two weeks
ago in i lie Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation championship game, both at the
hands of UCLA.
With two of the three Stanford losses
over the last two years coming in the
squad's most important games, one may
doubt the Cardinal's ability to perform in
big-game situations.
Stanford has a chance to put such
doubts to rest with this weekend's NCAA
tournament. The top-seeded Cardinal
(21 -2) is just two big wins away from the na
tional championship.
Despite its loss in the final of the MPSF
tournament, the second-ranked Cardinal
received the one at-large bid — and the
No. 1 seed —to the four-team NCAA tour
nament, which will be held at the McDon
ald Swim Stadium in Los Angeles.
Along with Stanford and the defend
ing national champion Bruins, No. 12
Michigan and No. 7 Loyola Marymount
will take part in just the second-ever
NCAA tournament.

Stanford will lace the Wolverines (25-
11) in tomorrow's semifinal, with a win like
ly setting up a rematch with UCLA in Sun
day afternoon's championship game. Such
a matchup in the final promises to be heat
ed, as these two teams have developed
quite a rivalry over the past two seasons.
Last year, in the NCAA championship
game, the Bruins handed Stanford its
only loss of the year to steal the national
title. This year, Stanford defeated the
Bruins in three regular season contests,
before falling to UCLA, 11-7, in the MPSF
championship two weekends ago. The
win gave the Bruins the MPSF's automat
ic bid to the NCAAs.
"There's a big chance we'll play UCLA on
Sunday," said sophomore driver Brenda
Villa. "We're 3-1 against them this season,
we looked over game tapes, we've corrected
a few things and we'll Ix' ready for them. Be
cause of last year, there's more pressure on
them because they're the defending cham
pions, but we're both different teams this
year with different mentalities."
Before facing UCLA, however, Stan-

ford must first beat the Wolverines,
who earned a bid to the tourna
ment by winning the Eastern Con
ference championship game in
double overtime.
Two-meter Julie Nisbet leads
the team with 46 goals and was
one of three Michigan players se
lected to the Collegiate Water Polo
Association's All-Southern Divi
sion First Team.

"We are in the mindset that we
have two games that we have to
win," Villa said. "We have to win
Saturday to get to Sunday and
need to concentrate on what we
need to do and play good water
polo in both games."
The Cardinal has dropped only
two games all season and won the
title at both the Stanford Invitational
and the Gaucho Invitational at lid-
Santa Barbara. Stanford was on a 13-
game winning streak before losing
its only regular-season game to
Southern California on March 30.
Leading the team's offense into

the NCAAs is Villa, with a team
high 55 points in 23 games this sea
son. She has scored four goals in a
game twice this year.
Villa has also done we+l against
UCLA, scoring the game-winning
goal in triple overtime against the
Bruins on Feb. 24 and netting two
goals in Stanford's 6-4 win over
UCLA on March 3.
While Villa has been a scoring
machine, the team has benefited
from its depth on oflense.
Sophomore two-meter Wendy
Watkins and senior driver Margie
Dingeldein have three games each

with three or more goals, while se
nior two-meter Ellen Estes and ju
nior driver J ulie (Gardner both have
two three-goal games.
The key to Stanford's success in
the NCAA's will be its early scoring.
The Cardinal has outscored its op
ponents 76-16 in the first quarter
and 243-91 overall.
"We all know how we felt last
year," Villa said. "We don't want to
feel that way again. We have to lay it
out on the line and play the best 11 lat
we can. We want to walk away from
the game knowing that we played
the best we could."
