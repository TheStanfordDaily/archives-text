# Women aim at NCAAs
## Women's water polo looks to snag NCAA crown that eluded team last year 
### KIM ROBERTS STAFF WRITER 
Since the beginning of the 2001 season,
the Stanford women's water polo team has
lost only three games. But one of those
losses came in last year's NCAA champi
onship game and another came two weeks
ago in i lie Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation championship game, both at the
hands of UCLA.
With two of the three Stanford losses
over the last two years coming in the
squad's most important games, one may
doubt the Cardinal's ability to perform in
big-game situations.
Stanford has a chance to put such
doubts to rest with this weekend's NCAA
tournament. The top-seeded Cardinal
(21 -2) is just two big wins away from the na
tional championship.
Despite its loss in the final of the MPSF
tournament, the second-ranked Cardinal
received the one at-large bid — and the
No. 1 seed —to the four-team NCAA tour
nament, which will be held at the McDon
ald Swim Stadium in Los Angeles.
Along with Stanford and the defend
ing national champion Bruins, No. 12
Michigan and No. 7 Loyola Marymount
will take part in just the second-ever
NCAA tournament.

Stanford will lace the Wolverines (25-

ly setting up a rematch with UCLA in Sun
day afternoon's championship game. Such
a matchup in the final promises to be heat
ed, as these two teams have developed
quite a rivalry over the past two seasons.
Last year, in the NCAA championship
game, the Bruins handed Stanford its
only loss of the year to steal the national
title. This year, Stanford defeated the
Bruins in three regular season contests,
before falling to UCLA, 11-7, in the MPSF
championship two weekends ago. The
win gave the Bruins the MPSF's automat
ic bid to the NCAAs.
"There's a big chance we'll play UCLA on
Sunday," said sophomore driver Brenda
Villa. "We're 3-1 against them this season,
we looked over game tapes, we've corrected
a few things and we'll Ix' ready for them. Be
cause of last year, there's more pressure on
them because they're the defending cham
pions, but we're both different teams this
year with different mentalities."
