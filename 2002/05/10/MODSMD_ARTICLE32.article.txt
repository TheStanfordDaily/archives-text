# Season-end run gets men's golf to NCAAs
## 
### MATTHEW BABIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A month ago, it looked like the Stanford
men's golf team would be spending its May af
ternoons like the rest of Stanford students â€”
laying out in the sun, catching up on reading,
and preparing for midterms.
But after vaulting up in both the conference
standings and the national rankings on the heels
of its back-to-back second-place finishes, the Car
dinal now finds itself spending some serious time
on the driving range and putting green in
preparation for the NCAA West Regionals.
l he team has ;i week to finish tuning up

before it heads to Albuquerque to match up
against the top 25 collegiate teams in the
West. Among the group are nine Pacific 10
Conference schools, led by No. 1 seed South
ern California.
The Trojans, paced by Pac-10 Colfer of the
Year senior Kevin Stadler, have proven to be
Stanford's fiercest competition oflate, just edging
the Cardinal in last week's Pac-l() Championships
and in the U.S. Intercollegiate two weeks ago.
A large part of the credit for those two sec
ond-place finishes goes to senior I'hil Rowe and
junior Jim Seki, who have caught fire over the
last month. After posting good scores in Ari
zona ;it the ASU/SAYAN K Invitational, the two

have combined for two tournament wins in the
last two contests. On the year, Rowe has turned
in six top-10 finishes.
Their excellent play not only got them spots
on the All-Pac-10 First Team, but it is also like
ly responsible for getting Stanford to the NCAA
Regionals. Stanford was the only school in the
conference to land two players on the All-Con
ference First Team.
Behind the big guns of Rowe and Seki, there
are talented players capable of posting low
rounds all weekend.
