# Season-end run gets men's golf to NCAAs
## 
### MATTHEW BABIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A month ago, it looked like the Stanford
men's golf team would be spending its May af
ternoons like the rest of Stanford students —
laying out in the sun, catching up on reading,
and preparing for midterms.
But after vaulting up in both the conference
standings and the national rankings on the heels
of its back-to-back second-place finishes, the Car
dinal now finds itself spending some serious time
on the driving range and putting green in
preparation for the NCAA West Regionals.
l he team has ;i week to finish tuning up

before it heads to Albuquerque to match up
against the top 25 collegiate teams in the
West. Among the group are nine Pacific 10
Conference schools, led by No. 1 seed South
ern California.
The Trojans, paced by Pac-10 Colfer of the
Year senior Kevin Stadler, have proven to be
Stanford's fiercest competition oflate, just edging
the Cardinal in last week's Pac-l() Championships
and in the U.S. Intercollegiate two weeks ago.
A large part of the credit for those two sec
ond-place finishes goes to senior I'hil Rowe and
junior Jim Seki, who have caught fire over the
last month. After posting good scores in Ari
zona ;it the ASU/SAYAN K Invitational, the two

have combined for two tournament wins in the
last two contests. On the year, Rowe has turned
in six top-10 finishes.
Their excellent play not only got them spots
on the All-Pac-10 First Team, but it is also like
ly responsible for getting Stanford to the NCAA
Regionals. Stanford was the only school in the
conference to land two players on the All-Con
ference First Team.
Behind the big guns of Rowe and Seki, there
are talented players capable of posting low
rounds all weekend.
Sophomore Blake Mastalir, owner of four
top-20 finishes on the year, looks
to add another note to his resume
next week in Albuquerque. Junior
Ron Won is also capable of helping
to move Stanford up the leader
board.
Just two weeks ago, Stanford
didn't even know if it would be on
that leaderboard. Head coach Jeff
Mitchell described the U.S. Inter
collegiate, held here at the Stan
ford Golf Course, as "an extremely
important tournament" for this
"bubble team."
The team responded in an ex
tremely strong way, taking second
place behind the consensus fa
vorite USC, while Phil Rowe cap
tured an individual first-place fin
ish. The next week provided a
surreal replay, with Jim Seki tak
ing the individual title at the Pac
-10 Championships while Stan
ford again took second place be
hind USC.
So the Cardinal heads to New
Mexico with momentum on its
Side. After finishing seven places
above its initial seeding of ninth
at the Pac-10 Championships, it is
giving little attention to its low
seeding of 18th in the upcoming
tournament.
The team is coming off of its
best finishes of the year. And it has
two of the hottest golfers on the
collegiate scene, who are heating
up at just the right time.
There's no time for it to cool
down now.
fhe Cardinal has gone into the
past two tournaments knowing
that a good finish was necessary to
continue the season. It carries this
sentiment again into play next
weekend, knowing that they must
move up to advance out of the
competitive western region.

In a sense, the Stanford men's
golf team has already been
through three weeks of the playolT
season. It has faced the pressure
and proved it could handle it calm
ly and exceed people's expecta
tions. There is little reason to ex
pect a change in this attitude — or
in those results — next weekend in
Albuquerque.
The tournament runs from
May 16 through May 18 at the
University of New Mexico Cham

pionship Golf Course. It is one of
three regional tournaments na
tionally. Each regional tourna
ment is equal in size, with a field of
27 teams and six golfers compet
ing as individuals.
From each region, 10 teams
and two individuals will advance to
the final tournament of the year,
the NCAA Championships, to be
held May 29 through June 1 at
Ohio State's Scarlet Course in
Columbus, Ohio.
