seasoned champion could hope
to hold up with such a big hole in
its lineup.
Forced to compete without the
talent of second-ranked senior K.J.
Hippensteel, who was named the
Pacific 10 Conference I'layer ol the
Year, the No. 6 Cardinal (19-5. 5-2
Pac-10)hashad to learn quickly how
to get by without its quiet leader.
Whether the lesson has been
learned will lx- seen this weekend, as
Stanford begins its quest fora
record 1 (Sih NCAA team champi
onship with the first two rounds,
which will be played at Taube Fam

pensteel (21-4), the Cardinal may
have come out of the late-season
stretch even stronger.
Hippensteel's absence forced
Gould to use some of his players in
different positions.
In the last three matches, No. 28
David Martin (28-7), No. 51 Scott
Lipsky (30-11) and No. 49 Ryan
Haviland (25-10), all juniors,
moved up to the top three ladder
positions and proved that they can
compete at higher levels. Martin
and Lipsky were both selected by
the Pac-10 to . the All-Conference
Second Team.
All three juniors will also join
Hippensteel in the NCAA Singles
Championship, which will be
played after the team champi
onship concludes.
Could has also been impressed
with how the two freshmen and the
one sophomore on the team have
responded in the past weeks.
Freshman Sam Warburg (25-10)
has one of the best records on the
team and has played solidly at the
No. 5 position. Fellow classmate Phil
Sheng (14-1(5) does not possess a
particularly impressive record, but
his play has improved dramatically
as of late.
Sophomore Joe Kao (7-9) has
been a pleasant surprise this year,
showing his potential in several key
victories at the No. 6 position.
In doubles play, the Cardinal
looks extremely strong at the No. 1
position with the second-ranked

pair of Lipsky / Martin (34-8)
guiding the squad. No. HI Havi
land / Hippensteel (21-3) and
Sheng / Warburg are the other
doubles teams that will likely play
for the Stanford in the NCAAs,
although that hinges on Hippen
steel's availability.
Both Lipksy/ Martin and Havi
land / Hippensteel will make ap
pearances in the NCAA Doubles
Championship.
Gould will be the last to guar
antee two victories this weekend,
but the Cardinal's 26-0 all-time
record against the other three
teams competing on the Farm this
weekend is comforting.
Its first-round matchup
against Sacramento State should
be no more than a warmup for
the Cardinal. Even if Hippensteel
were to miss the match, the Car
dinal has enough talent to send
the Hornets home.
Out of die three teams, Wash
ington is the biggest threat to Stan
ford because of its prior exposure to
the (lardinal's lineup. The (Cardinal
beat the 1 luskies earlier this year (>-
1, but two of the singles matches
went to three sets.
Washington boasts two national
ly-ranked players, including Pac-10
Freshman of the Year No. 29 Alex
Vlaski and No. 42 Matt 1 ianlin.
Gould believes that the squad is
ready to begin NCAA play.
"The guys are ready fora good
start," he said. "We definitely have
the talent to [win], but it won't be
easy. We're excited about playing,

we're thin, but I'm confident in the

Fora collegiate tennis team,

pensteel (21-4), the Cardinal may
have come out of the late-season
stretch even stronger.
Hippensteel's absence forced
Gould to use some of his players in
different positions.
In the last three matches, No. 28
David Martin (28-7), No. 51 Scott
Lipsky (30-11) and No. 49 Ryan
Haviland (25-10), all juniors,
moved up to the top three ladder
positions and proved that they can
compete at higher levels. Martin
and Lipsky were both selected by
the Pac-10 to . the All-Conference
Second Team.
All three juniors will also join
Hippensteel in the NCAA Singles
Championship, which will be
played after the team champi
onship concludes.
Could has also been impressed
with how the two freshmen and the
one sophomore on the team have
responded in the past weeks.
Freshman Sam Warburg (25-10)
has one of the best records on the
team and has played solidly at the
No. 5 position. Fellow classmate Phil
Sheng (14-1(5) does not possess a
particularly impressive record, but
his play has improved dramatically
as of late.
Sophomore Joe Kao (7-9) has
been a pleasant surprise this year,
showing his potential in several key
victories at the No. 6 position.
In doubles play, the Cardinal
looks extremely strong at the No. 1
position with the second-ranked

pair of Lipsky / Martin (34-8)
guiding the squad. No. HI Havi
land / Hippensteel (21-3) and
Sheng / Warburg are the other
doubles teams that will likely play
for the Stanford in the NCAAs,
although that hinges on Hippen
steel's availability.
Both Lipksy/ Martin and Havi
land / Hippensteel will make ap
pearances in the NCAA Doubles
Championship.
Gould will be the last to guar
antee two victories this weekend,
