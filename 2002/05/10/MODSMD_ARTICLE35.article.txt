Junior second baseman Kira Ching goes fora tag earlier this season at Smith Family Stadium. No. 8
Stanford hosts No. 15 Oregon State tonight and Oregon tomorrow for its final regular-season games.
The Stanford bats will look to
continue the kind of production
they had in the first game of a
doubleheader against San Jose
State on Wednesday and try their
best to avoid their fate in the sec
ond game. The Cardinal ran up
10 runs in taking the first game,
but got shut out in the nightcap,
thus splitting the doubleheader
with the Spartans.
Stanford has scored t.wo or
fewer runs in nine of its last 10 Pac
-10 games.
Guiding the Stanford offense

are senior center fielder Jessica
Mendoza, senior first baseman
Sarah Beeson and junior second
baseman Kira Ching.
Three-time first-team All-
American Mendoza is hitting
.386 with a team-leading 62 hits
and 66 doubles.
Beeson has been one of Stan
ford's most solid hitters this season
with 44 RBI and a .384 average.
Rounding out the threesome is
Ching, who currently boasts a .333
average, with 56 hits, nine home
runs and 41 RBI.
The Beavers will try to silence
the hot bats of the Cardinal with
their leading hurlers, Monica
Hoffman, Crystal Draper and
Kristen Hunter. Draper leads

the team with 152 innings
pitched, an ERA of 1.84 and a
record of 13-6.
Stanford will then take on the
Ducks fora doubleheader on
Saturday.
The last time the two teams met
in Eugene, the Cardinal just edged
out the Ducks in a too-close-for
comfort 3-2 victory.
The Ducks enter the weekend
with only a single Pac-10 win
under their belt. Stanford will be
eager to fend off Oregon as a po
tential spoiler going into the se
lection show on Sunday after
noon.
Tonight's first pitch is at 7:00
p.m., with tomorrow's double
header kicking off at 1:00 p.m.
