### RAMIN SETOODEH EDITORIAL STAFF 
UC-Berkeley administrators an
nounced Wednesday the appointment of
Stanford Law Prof. Tom Campbell as the
new dean of the Haas School of Business.
"I"m very happy at the opportunity,"
Campbell said. "But I'm sad to leave
Stanford."
Campbell joined the Stanford faculty
in 1983, after earning bachelor's and doc
toral degrees from the University of
Chicago and a law degree from Harvard
University.

In 1988, Campbell, a Republican, was
elected to the U.S. House of Representa
tives and served five terms, but he contin
ued teaching on campus and at the Stan
ford in Washington program.
He was elected as a California state sena
tor in 1993 fora two-year term.
Campbell said that he was excited about
Wednesday's announcement.
"U( Berkeley is offering me to be the
dean of a major business school at a time
when the ethical practice of business is of
important concern to our country," he said.
Law School Dean Kathleen Sullivan said
she supported Campbell's decision to leave.

"He is a brilliant
choice," Sullivan said. "He
will bring to the*ob a rare
combination of intellect,
energy, broad policy expe
rience and impeccable in
tegrity and fairness. Stan
ford's loss is UC-Berkeley's
great gain."
Campbell explained

some of his ideas fort he school, which en
rolls about 1,300 graduate and undergrad
uate UC-Berkeley students.
"I want to focus on the teaching of skills
that will be effective in business," Campbell

said. "My hope is that students will pursue a
noble calling, an ethical calling and an hon
est calling."
In Congress, Campbell was a moderate
who was known for being pro-choice, pro
gun control and pro-environment. 1 le was
one of seven Republicans who voted
against Newt Gingrich's bid for re-election
as speaker in 1997. Later, he voted to im
peach former President Bill Clinton â€” a
decision that caused some outcry from stu
dents on campus.
He lost a U.S. Senate bid in 2000 to Di
anne Feinstein.
In the classroom, Campbell taught stu

dents about antitrust law. He also taught
an undergraduate political science class
in Washington.
Campbell said that his time at Stanford
has been fulfilling.
" The best thing I've ever done is teach,"
he said. "Ill do teach at the business school
it will be a couple of years."
Shaila Djurovich, a third-year law stu
dent taking one of Campbell's classes,
said he was a student-friendly instructor.
"I le's a teacher who takes interest in his
students," Djurovich said. "He definitely


Tom Campbell
make a great effort to facilitate
classroom participation."
Jamon Bollock, also a third-year
law student, noted another of
Campbell's strengths.
"He's a very accomplished
scholar," Bollock said, "lie's
not only intelligent but excel
lent at making students under
stand the intricacies of complex
legal issues."
Sullivan noted Campbell's in
volvement at Stanford.

"In his time at the Law School
he's been a master teacher, a
highly conscientious colleague, a
regular supporter of student
events and a big hit as a speaker at
alumni events," Sullivan said,
"lie's also got a great sense of
humor. I'll miss him personally,
but wish him well."
Campbell is expected to begin as
dean on Aug. 19, after the UC
Board of Regents approves his ap
pointment.
"Excuse me, I'm going to
sneeze, " he said, as he was dis
cussing what he anticipated at
Berkeley. "See, I'm allergic to the
thought of leaving Stanford."
