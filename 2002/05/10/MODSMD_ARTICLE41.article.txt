awaited (at least by the geek boys in my dorm) "Spider-
Man," I have to admit that it blows the Batman films, as
well as every other superhero movie I've ever seen,
completely out of the water.
All right, so that isn't really saying much. The only
movie out of the bunch that I've really liked was Tim
Burton's "Batman Returns," which was almost anti-su
perhero in its curious insistence that both superheroes
and supervillains are alienated, lonely freaks. "Spider-
Man," on the other hand, explodes with the sheer joy
and kinetic energy of the best action comics; it may be
little more than adolescent power fantasy, but it's ado
lescent power fantasy at its absolute finest. More than
anything, it has the same pure pulp pleasure of the first
"Star Wars," before George Lucas tricked himself into

believing that he was creating
Great Art, rather than a

high-tech tribute to the sci-fi
serials of the '30s.
Which isn't to say that
"Spider-Man" doesn't have
serious problems. It does;
most of them stem from
David koepp's adequate-to-

mediocre script and an imper
fect transition from comic to
film. Indeed, the screenplay's
flaws are almost identical to
those of the comics: despite the
thrill inherent in the story of

dorky, picked-on high schooler Peter Parker's (Tobey
Maguire) sudden acquisition of spectacular superpow
ers via the bite of a genetically altered spider, the movie
keeps tripping up on awkward dialogue. At one point,
the villainous Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) asks Peter,
"So, are you in or are you out, Spider-Man?" and our
hero responds, "No, you're out, Cobby â€” out of your
mind!" Ouch.
The film's second half, in particular, is also weighed

down by an increasing emphasis on
Raimi's elaborate set pieces and action se
quences, often leaving scenes without any
element of humanity. Quite often, both
the Goblin's and Spidey's faces are com
pletely obscured their expressionless
masks, making it hard to care which
brightly costumed stuntman comes out 011
top. Thankfully, the key moment of the
spectacular finale occurs with masks oil.
"Spider-Man" also has early comics'
tendency towards trite moralizing. "With
great power comes great responsibility!" is
as omnipresent a mantra in "Spider-Man"
as "May the Force be with you," was in

"Star Wars." By the third time 1 heard it, I was gritting
my teeth. And don't even get me started on the clumsy
post-Sept. 11 additions, including a line about the soli
darity of New Yorkers and a gratuitous shot of the
American flag.
Yet these flaws don't keep "Spider-Man" 's best mo
ments from soaring. Like the comic before it, the film


"Damn, the Marguerite is always late!"
