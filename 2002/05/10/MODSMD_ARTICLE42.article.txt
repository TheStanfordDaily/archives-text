"Giselle," as performed by the San Francis
co Ballet merits just a one-word response:
bravo. Hie San Francisco B;dlet does an excel
lent job with tills ballet from scenery to chore
ography to dancing. The dancers seemed to
float across the stage, the movements were
graceful, and the expressions and passion that
the dancers displayed were captivating.

""Giselle"

"Giselle" is considered the pinnacle ofthe Romantic era ofballet, an era where free
dom, expressiveness ;ind emotions were exalted over classicism, formality and mil
ism. Iliis particular story is set in the small town ofThuringen, Germany, where the
weak-hearted peasant girl Giselle is being wooed by two men: die Duke of Silesia Al
brecht disguised as a peasant named Loys, and Hilarion, a woodsman. She falls in love
with Loys to the anger and dismay of Hilarion, who discovers Loys' identity and re
veids him to Giselle. Upon discovering this deceit, she goes mad and kills herself upon
Loys' sword, becoming a Wilis, or ghost maiden.
.After her death, Hilarion visits Giselle's grave in the middle of the night where he
encounters Myrtha, the Queen of the Wilis, who makes him dance to hisdeath. When
Albrecht also comes to grieve, Myrtha tries to do the same but Giselle, still in love with
him, protects him as much as she can, sustaining him until dawn when the Wills dis
appear, leaving him alone on stage to grieve her loss.
So much was communicated to the audience not only through the music but also
through the dancing and gestures, despite the feet that not a single word was spoken.
.And the choreography followed die music perfecdy.
After Giselle dies, she does a dance with Albrecht, her lover, and her movements
seem ghostlike in dieir speed as well as through the wistful expressions on her face. As
for Albrecht , there was heaviness to his step, indicative of his sadness, and something
light and airy about hers. For one of the sequences, Albrecht played by Vadim Solo
makha lifts Giselle, played by Yuan Yuan Tan, up in the air with each step. Tlie
movement Ls done widi such fluidity that the audience does not even realize she is
Ix'ing lifted unless they 1< x>k down at her feet. Her flowing white dress covers her legs
and gives her the ethereal quality diat characterizes her Wilis state.
Yuan Yuan Tan also made very difficult sequences seem effortless. ()ne particular
sequence that stands out in my mind is a scene where she hops across die stage en point
while contorting her Ixxly and moving her legs and amis into a variety of different po
sitions with each hop. Although diis may not sound like the most graceful of sequences,
she managed to carry it off widi grace and poise.
I ix)king at the dance troupe as a whole, the synchrony of the movements was ini
peccable. In perhaps the most famous scene in the ballet, die "Dance of the Wilis'," 20
some dancers move across die stage in perfect unison. N( >t only are their movements
timed exactly correctly, but dieir legs are ;ill at die same height, as are dieir arms. Kacli
change of position is executed flawlessly widi perfect timing among die dancers. They
moved togedier as if diey shared die same mind and the same muscles creating a scene
that is hard to forget, although die movements seem trite.
If there were any mistakes in this whole performance, diey were unnoticeable;
there was nothing more to ask from this production. Whether or not you like Ixillet,
this isn't a performance to miss.
