# 'Life or Something' as predictable

It's predictable, but not an
noyingly so.
"Life or Something Like It,"
which stars Angelina Jolie's
very large bleached blonde
hair, follows the life of Seattle
news reporter Lanie Kerrigan.
She thinks she has it all — a

perfect job, a baseball-star fiance, a great
lifestyle. Her cameraman foil soon points out
that she's not really happy, but his words fall
on deaf ears. A homeless man who sees himself
as a prophet then informs Lanie she only has
one week to live. After witnessing his other
predictions come true (the score by which the
Seahawks will win, hail uncharacteristic of the
season, the minute at which an earthquake
will strike San Francisco), she is terrified for
her life. So, of course, she takes this opportu
nity to live life to its fullest and find fulfillment.
Fulfillment includes: trading in her pink busi
ness suit fora Social Distortion t-shirt, dress
ing like a bus driver and breaking out into
song on television.
Despite the simple plot, director Stephen
Herek is able to keep the audience engaged
with the movie's quirks — whether intention
al or not. "Life" 's philosophizing and

metaphoric descriptions are
priceless. When Lanie de
scribes herself as a donut,
her cameraman sidekick
I'ete asks her to define
"donut." But it gets better.
Lanie is also described as an
Altoid. That is to say, she is
"curiously strong." You try
one, and it stings, but you
can't resist having another.
Um, yeah.
Then there's the scene in
which Lanie brings the
homeless prophet a gift to
butter him up, perhaps
thinking he'll change his
prediction. She hands him a
brown paper bag, clearly

containing a bottle. And what does he pull
out? Strawberry fortified wine. It's so random

it's great. Such moments
are much funnier than
the less subtle jokes,
such as when her fiance
confuses ESPN for ESP.
And let's not forget
Angelina Jolie's hair.
Never mind her acting.

Iii some shots, her hair is expansive enough to
fill the whole screen. To take this movie seri
ously would be a mistake. Perhaps someone
should have let Herek in on this secret, be
cause the film's weakest moments occur when
Angelina and her hair get serious. The movie
stumbles over itself and you begin to wonder
if it's a comedy.
As an audience member, instead of won
dering whether Lanie will find true fulfillment
or whether Jolie is convincing as a woman who
thinks she is about to die, just stop. Don't
think. You don't have to be a movie snob.
Nothing is so predictable that it's distracting.
It'sjusta movie. It's entertaining. Think of the
plot as a metaphor.
While it's difficult to entirely ignore the in
effectiveness of the dramatic scenes, if you
can get past these flaws, the movie is enjoy
able to watch.
