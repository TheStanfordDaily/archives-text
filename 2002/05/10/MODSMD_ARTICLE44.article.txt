Everything in you wants to rebel against this
album of meat-and-potatoes, heartland, emotion
al, "mellow-dramatic" rock. But you hold back on
the third note of the opening "Coliseum," and
obey instinct. You ask yourself whether rock is a
sum ol histories or the sublimation of passions.
And you say, you know, it is the latter.
Jerry Joseph and Ihe J ackmormons have lead
a life loaded with bad luck — bankrupt record
companies, shattered dreams and thankless tour
ing — and they have no right to release an album
this true, an album this heartfelt, an album this
arousing in the light of their history. Joseph and
The Jackmormons have obeyed their instinct and
so must you.
Their album, "Conscious Contact," is a great
sell-out record. Here we see a jam-band retreating
on itself in the vague attempts at a "noisy, rock
record" but landing in melodic territory. The
sound of the band is southern-country rock with
chunky guitars; to quote my roommate, Jason
Fuentes — "They're the type of band that'd I'd
like to see live in a coffee shop." I bis southern
rock band might l>e one of the best to emerge
from Athens since REM; as a poet and singer,
Jerry Joseph clings to tradition — using his some
what-gruff voice to evoke Hob Dylan, Bruce
Springsteen and Michael Stipe — without openly

copping it.
In construct, the album is simi
lar in many ways to The Wallflow
ers' "Breach" — the smorgasbord
of sound sways on a layer of bub
bling, jingle-jangle chords, but
gives itself to a straight up riff)' ififfy
guitar attack on many songs. In
contrast with the band's improvisa
tional reputation, solos are re
strained and minimal.
()n the whole, "Conscious C ion
tact" is loaded with radio-friendly
hooks. The real charm of the
songs, however, lies in the lyrics.

The wordplay' is erudite and poetic without being
enigmatic. For example, the atmospheric drunk-

on-goodness "Pure Life," fea
tures Joseph crooning, "It
tastes like sacrament to me/
Like a genuflecting reptile with
St. Michael /1 am starting to be
lieve." The misfired political
anthem on China, "Ching-a-
Ling," pounds with the ur-

gency of its message: "I've got ice and Daijeeling/
Tastes like murder /When the l)ells of freedom
ring." Refreshingly, the songs are not about chas
ing girls or cathartic disillusionment; they ma
turely address love, pain, desolation and even so
ciopolitical issues without seeming didactic. lhe
poetry attempts to turn external imager) in
wards, rather than brooding over the internal.
On another front, "The Fastest Horse in
Town" is the closest Joseph and the Jackmormons
come to delivering a Pearl Jam post-grunge; the
ominous, bare opening gives way to stretched, dis
torted chords that are unglamorous and slow
enough to fall short of therapeutic anger. Joseph's
voice has an added gruffness in its delivery and
the driving bass line that pervades all the songs is
at its lx?st here as well.
Hie stark acoustic ballad 'Ten Killer Fairies"
meanwhile, breaks the claustrophobia of the sonic
soundscape with a jingling lolk-rock that jives into
a country chorus. A tender piano haunts "Your
Glass Eye" and is beautifully augmented by
Joseph's earthy, if limited, vocals. "Prince of Den
mark" soaks in an early-REM influence, circa
"Document."
Of course, this album has many, many flaws.
Take the songs' length, for one; simple verse-cho
rus-verse songs in the middle of "Conscious Con-

tact" are stretched to
epic lengths (over six
minutes), causing a loss
of momentum, mes
sage and meaning.
Also, diere is a certain
sterility associated with
the synthesizer-guitar
foreground, like Dire
Straits in a muffler.
That said, however, the
band maintains an in
telligent penchant for
simple, melodic rock all
the way throughout.


Loaded with radio-friendly hooks.
