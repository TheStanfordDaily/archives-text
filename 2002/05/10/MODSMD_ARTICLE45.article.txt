The first thing you want to know
about a band with a such a red-flag
name as "And You Will Know Us By
The Trail of Dead" is wliat the hell could
it all be about? Ilianklullv, the subtitle
from the Austin, Texas-based quartet's
website supplies the answer tersely:
"chaotic and furious rock and roll."
The group consists of four gin s with
sufficiently black and tousled hair, a vio
lent stage presence and a penchant for
obscure francophilic poetry allusion. So,
with the ingredients mise en place and
the goal clearly defined, perhaps we can
trv to figure out exactly what constitutes
"chaotic and furious rock 'n' roll."
There are two primary schools of
"chaotic and furious rock 'n' roll." "Hie
first calls for fiisingchallenging melodies,
beats and lyrics with sounds, pops, clicks
and general sonic oddness to produce an
aesthetic of ordered chaos (with a d;ish of
fury). The emphasis here would be on
the "integration" part, This, sadly, is just
not Trail of Dead's style. Hie)' instead
elect for the second, bastard school,
more popularly known throughout the
"chaotic and furious rock 'n' roll" world
as "composition by Lego."
This entails taking what amounts to a
group of pedestrian power-pop rage an
thems and ballads, breaking them apart
at the one-third and two-thirds marks,
inserting down-tempo emo refrains at
the beginning and end of each track and
recombining the parts back together.
This can also be done the opposite way
with violent drums and a good helping
of shouting inserted into Modest Mouse
y three-minute complaint-rockers. Of
course, one can't forget the obligatory
ambient noises at the front and rear of
each song, in the vein of Beck's "Dead
weight" and Radiohead's "Treefingers."
These tidbits of chaos are to be the mark
of the professional. Note, however, that
from these dews of disorder the band re
solves something too solid, shiny and
well-planned to count as disarray.
If it sounds formulaic, that might be
because it is. The trope of "hard-soft /

soft-hard" seems to lie the band's big
gun, which by the end of the third track
is obviously shooting blanks.
The lyrics also prop up the "chaotic
and furious rock 'n' roll" aesthetic. For
the most part diey are more spoken than
sung, consisting of declarative sentences
that don't link up with each other. In the
lyrics, "sin" appears live times and "evil"
appears three times, while "blood" and
"dark" tied at four times each.
The band is at its best, though, when
it just does their own thing. The piano in
"Heart in the Hand of the Matter" is
wonderful, adding depth to the track,
which makes this more than just a brit
pop redux. Ignore the chorus' "Ride the
apocalypse (sx)" and this is a toe-tapper.
In addition to the piano, there are
strings throughout, but their best ap
pearance comes in track five "How
Near How Far." This track wins the
"Largest Single Potential" award for
the album, again, by simply chilling out
on the "chaotic and furious rock n'
roll" thing. Rather than riding the pen
dulum all the way from Trent Reznor
to Doug Martsch and back again, the
song settles into more of a Dave Grohl
territory, with the same kind of dy
namic guitar progressions you loved
on "Everlong."
When it comes down to it, the album
just doesn't do what it claims it will. This
may be less Trail of Dead's fault than the
basic paradox plaguing anarchists, ni
hilists and "chaotic and furious rock 'n'
roll" devotees â€” namely that "ordered
chaos" is an oxymoron. Come up with a
better term. Otherwise you run the risk
of your dark new "chaotic and furious
rock 'n' roll" album being .exposed for
the slickly-produced, Blink 182-in-black
offering that it is. And without the bare
asses even.
