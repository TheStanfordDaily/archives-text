# Wilco does the 'Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'
## 
### NASTASSIA LOPEZ 
Before I even pressed play on
"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot," I
promised myself that I would not
let the reviews in Rolling Stone
and Spin magazines influence
what I thought of the CD. But as I
listened, 1 realized why this band
has been so highly acclaimed by al

most every music publication around. It is brilliant.
The first time I heard Wilco was at a gas station in West
Hollywood. A gay couple was making out to one of the
band's songs while filling their gas tank. Minutes later, 1
asked them the name of the band, and they simultaneously
said, "Wilco."
Wilco, which made its debut in 1995, was widely ac
knowledged as one of the best indie bands around. Since
then, Wilco has experienced considerable personnel
changes within the band. These experiences have stretched

t lie group's creative limits and contributed to an intuitive,
eclectic album that deserves accolades from both the indie

and mainstream musical worlds.
In a way, we're fortunate to be able to listen to this
record. Dumped by Wilco's major label, Reprise
Records, it seemed destined to gather dust in a vault
somewhere until another record label picked it up. "Hie
kicker is that the band's new label, Nonesuch Records,
is owned by the same parent company, AOL Time
Warner, as Reprise!

Four years after the gas station incident, Wilco is back in
my lite. "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot" erupts with the lyrical ge
nius of the first song, "I'm Trying to Break Your 1 leart." A
mix between Radiohead and Tom Petty and the Heart
breakers, the song introduces you to the unyielding talent
this band possesses. Wilco is headed by front man JeH
Tweedy, whose voice is thick with great overtones of singers
like Dave Matthews, Jackson Brown and Nick Drake. His
lyrics also reverberate with therapuetic ups and downs of ro
mance, angst and philosophical musings on incredible lines

like, "Our love is all God's money" and "Picking apples for
kings and queens of things I've never seen."
The band, though commanding a sound all its own, have a
couple hits on the album that ring with pop flair. "I'm the Man
Who Loves You," resembles something Beatles-esque, while
"War on War" could serve as the new anthem for our conn
try's current predica

/ I
ment. In the latter, the
verse, "You have to
learn how to die if you
want to be alive," sums
up the attitude Wilco
held while producing
the album. "You're not
going to experience life
unless you completely
surrender to failure,
surrender to getting
your ass kicked," re
flected Tweedy.
