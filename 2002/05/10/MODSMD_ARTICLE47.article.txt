# Dushku distracts yet another interviewer
## 
### ANTHONY HA 
Although 21-year-old Eli/a Dushku
acted in movies like "True Lies" and
" This Boy's Life" while in her early teens,
I didn't notice her until her appearance
as Faith during the third season of
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer," which 1 only
half-jokingly refer to as the greatest tele
vision show of all time. During her stint
as Faith, she was often the most dynamic
tiling on the screen — an ass-kicking
vampire slayer impulsive enough to
make Buffy look positively school
mannish. And the form-fitting leather
outfits didn't hurt, either.
Since leaving "Buffy," Dushku's film
work has included the Kevin Smith com
edy "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" and
the cheerleader flick "Bring It On." On
her newest movie, the Ed Decter-directed
comedy "The New Guy," she again plays
a high school cheerleader — Danielle,
one of the girls at the top of the societal
pecking order at East Highland High
School. After a disastrous accident at his
old school involving, well, his penis, titu
lar new guy Dizzy Harrison (DJ Quails)
reinvents himself as Dizzy Harris and ar
rives at East Highland hoping to estab
lish a new, cooler identity. The film tells
the story of Dizzy's struggle for popular
ity at East Highland, and of his romance
with Danielle.
I, along with four other journalists,
interviewed Dushku at the Sony Metre
on in San Francisco last Friday. She was
energetic and friendly, beginning the in
terview by pointing out the window and
exclaiming, "Look at some of these
buildings — they're gorgeous!" As we
talked about her life and work, she con
tinued to fidget with her hair and
clothes. And when she started to play
with her V-cut shirt, I became . . . slight
ly distracted.
"The New Guy" was originally sched
uled to be released last year but, due to
the confusion surrounding the impend
ing actors' strike (which never actually
occurred), was continually delayed. Al
though Dushku admitted that the wait
was frustrating, she pointed out that it
was much worse for some of her fellow
castmembers, for whom "The New
Guy" was their first film and supposed
big break.
"They're waiting to get their next role
for this goddamned movie to come out,"
Dushku explained. "You know, [Ross
Patterson] is calling me and going, This
is killing me!' I'm like, 'I know, I know,
it'll come out, baby, it'll come out. It'll
be great, and, y'knovv, they'll be knock- '

ing down your door,' but that sucks when
you're kind of leaning on it. And 1 think
lie's so good in the movie. So, it's frus
trating, but what are you going to do?"
Among the moments that made the
sporadically funny "New Guy" bearable
for me (an adolescent male, please keep
in mind) were a scene in which Danielle
modeled a variety of skimpy swimsuits,
and another in which she rode a mechan
ical bull. Dushku said that her comforta
bility with scenes that paraded her sexu
ality stemmed largely from her upbring
ing with three older brothers.
"Literally, my mother had to be like,
'Honey, there's a certain point where you
have to start wearing a shirt,' you know?"
she said. "I would, like, run around with
the boys and play tag football and climb
trees. I think that 1 really thought I was a
boy until I was 10 years old, because my
parents divorced when 1 was born, so my
three brothers were almost like my fa
thers growing up. So as I've become more
feminine, I've always been comfortable
with my body."
Before the interview, 1 had noticed
long lines of people waiting to see

Dushku later that
afternoon, several
of them carrying
Faith action figures
for her to sign. I
asked her how she
felt about the devot
ed, obsessive fan
culture that had
sprung up around
"Buffy."
"It can be creepy,
but it's also so flat
tering," she said.
"I'm just so grateful.
I mean, there's obvi
ously a line, but at
the same time it's
like, these people
have just given so
much in terms of,
they go to see my

movies, and they come and travel from
different cities to be at these signings and
they're so supportive. I don't know how
I can feel anything other than gratitude
and appreciation. As long as they don't,
you know, jump on me or start calling me
by my character's name. Stuff like that
freaks me out, like the ones who don't
have the line between reality and the
show."
"You know, I joke about it, but it's re
ally, for the most part, harmless," she
added. "And I'm glad that 1 can provide
this entertainment for them, and provide
this character. I think Faith really came in
represented this working-class chick,
whereas Buffy was kind of blonde-haired,
blue-eyed, like have the mom, have the
perfect home life. 1 got a lot of letters
from young girls who just said the second
she came on camera, they felt like they
could relate to her, and they found a
power and a strength in themselves
through watching my character. That's
pretty intense. And 1 feel like if 1 emo
tionally helped five girls, that's huge, be
cause 1 don't think there's enough atten
tion paid even now to the psychology of
young girls, and the treatment of young
girls in high school and the treatment of
young teenage girls in society."
As for the future, Dushku said that she
still hasn't decided whether she wants act
ing to be her primary career.
"I've really come to terms with the fact
that I'm probably not going to take the
conventional college, four-year route,"
she said. "I might have to do it class-by
class, have to do courses on the Internet.
It helps having a mom who's a professor,
because she's really, really intuitive,
and kind of really helps me keep it

mixed up. She'll say, like, 'Okay, we're
going to South Africa, for two-and-a-half
weeks fora study seminar on women in
post-Apartheid society in South Africa.'
So we go on this trip, and that, to me, was
like a college course in itself. "
And is she worried that her recent
spate of roles in so-called "teen
movies" might limit her opportunities
as an actress?
"I'm not that far off from being a
teenager, so I'm really not completely
against doing teen movies, because who
else is going to do them?" she answered.
"I feel like I'm old enough that I can look
back and remember them and be honest
about them, and I can feel comfortable
enough to reenact the reality, as opposed
to, like, you know, how I wished it was.
I'm old enough to be over it, I'm over
enough to be like, 'Okay, what happened,
happened,' and you know, I can under
stand it and almost even appreciate al
most even the terrible times."
"And also, I feel like I've gone through
all the phases of being a teenager. So 1
feel like I've gone through the really vul
nerable early teens, the middle teens,
where I was just so hard and rebellious
and obnoxious, and I really actually start
ed doing 'Buffy' right on that stage, so it
came into 'Buffy' a lot. Because 1 got
teased so much that I kinda had to have
this survival technique, 1 built up this re
ally thick skin and I built up this really
kind of defensive, you know, facade. And
now, four years later, now that the shell
shock of high school is over, now I'm ac
tually, you know, much more comfort
able and much more chill. I feel like I've
had the stages of my adolescence docu
mented on film mv whole life."


I love you


Does this serve any purpose in the movie? No. Do we care? No
