can no longer subject my sweet,
supple ears to the drivel that the
FCC allows to pollute our airwaves.
When I drive, 1 generally listen to
public radio (KZSU, K.ALX or
NPR) wherever I can. Occasionally,
however, I find myself in places like
Walnut Creek, Daly City, Mayward
or Fremont, where a combination
of geographical barriers and high
wattage corporate radio transmit
ters force me to tune in to one of
the Bay Area's better-known sta
tions. For these occasions, I keep a
package of gauze in the glove com
partment along with antiseptic
ointment that I apply once my ears
begin to bleed.
Yes, when it comes to music, I
am a monstrous asshole.
1 think the greatest pleasure of
listening to commercial radio is that
you hear mostly the same great

songs played over and over, once
every hour and a half; you're espe-

cially lucky it you get
stuck in traffic on the
way from San Jose to
Marin. Even more
gratifying, however, is
that half these songs
are mixed by the same

producers, the nefarious Neptunes.
The duo, consisting of Pharrell
Williams and Chad Hugo, has lent
its platinum touch to a swarm of hit
recordings over the past couple of
years. Everyone from Britney
Spears to Limp Bizkit to Puff Daddy
to Mystikal to Busta Rhymes to
'NSync to Jay-Z has gotten the Nep
tunes treatment. Curious aside:
perhaps that's why all that shit
sounds the same. In any case,
Williams and Hugo have teamed up
with new cohort Shay under a new
name, N.E.R.1)., which stands for
"No one Ever Really Dies," for their
own debut, "In Search Of. . ."
Coming from the guys who
brought you "Shake Ya Ass" and
"I'm a Slave 4 U," one would ex
pect to hear some fairly generic
beats coupled with a vague disin
genuous sexuality and faux street

grit. Those elements are cer
tainly present on "In Search
Of. . but they don't tell the
album's whole story. The
most conspicuous character
istic of the album is its con
stant attempt at hip-hop-rock
fusion. "Rock Star," for ex
ample, layers soulful singing
over a raucous backbeat of
fuzzed-out metal guitars.
"Brain" is one of the most


"I'm a slave 4 corporate radio."
