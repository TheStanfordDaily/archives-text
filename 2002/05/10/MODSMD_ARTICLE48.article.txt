can no longer subject my sweet,
supple ears to the drivel that the
FCC allows to pollute our airwaves.
When I drive, 1 generally listen to
public radio (KZSU, K.ALX or
NPR) wherever I can. Occasionally,
however, I find myself in places like
Walnut Creek, Daly City, Mayward
or Fremont, where a combination
of geographical barriers and high
wattage corporate radio transmit
ters force me to tune in to one of
the Bay Area's better-known sta
tions. For these occasions, I keep a
package of gauze in the glove com
partment along with antiseptic
ointment that I apply once my ears
begin to bleed.
Yes, when it comes to music, I
am a monstrous asshole.
1 think the greatest pleasure of
listening to commercial radio is that
you hear mostly the same great

songs played over and over, once
every hour and a half; you're espe-

cially lucky it you get
stuck in traffic on the
way from San Jose to
Marin. Even more
gratifying, however, is
that half these songs
are mixed by the same

producers, the nefarious Neptunes.
The duo, consisting of Pharrell
Williams and Chad Hugo, has lent
its platinum touch to a swarm of hit
recordings over the past couple of
years. Everyone from Britney
Spears to Limp Bizkit to Puff Daddy
to Mystikal to Busta Rhymes to
'NSync to Jay-Z has gotten the Nep
tunes treatment. Curious aside:
perhaps that's why all that shit
sounds the same. In any case,
Williams and Hugo have teamed up
with new cohort Shay under a new
name, N.E.R.1)., which stands for
"No one Ever Really Dies," for their
own debut, "In Search Of. . ."
Coming from the guys who
brought you "Shake Ya Ass" and
"I'm a Slave 4 U," one would ex
pect to hear some fairly generic
beats coupled with a vague disin
genuous sexuality and faux street

grit. Those elements are cer
tainly present on "In Search
Of. . but they don't tell the
album's whole story. The
most conspicuous character
istic of the album is its con
stant attempt at hip-hop-rock
fusion. "Rock Star," for ex
ample, layers soulful singing
over a raucous backbeat of
fuzzed-out metal guitars.

memorable tunes, blending raps with a funky,
bass-heavy guitar riff and electronic synth spasms.
Rolling Stone's review of the record points out
that N.E.R.D. is the first non-white band to enter
the realm of rap-rock fusion — a real accomplish
ment, apparently — before proceeding to kiss "In
Search Of. . ."'s inanimate behind. The fact that
those "in the know" feel the need to tout a group's
racial composition as a selling point is somewhat
depressing. Though the claim about the band
members' ethnicities is technically true (Williams
and Shay are black, while Hugo is Asian), it seems
like a somewhat silly, or even offensive, statement
to make.
Though this album is certainly more adventur
ous than those by other rap-rock groups in the
public eye like Limp Hi/kit or Alien Ant Farm, it is
by no means a breakthrough. Rage Against the Ma
chine, whose two most prominent members were
Latino, experimented with this sound before
N.E.R.D. Never even mind that black musicians
basically invented both rock 'n' roll and hip-hop,
the two components of the synthesis that has ob
sessed t he music-buying public fora few years now.
At the best, "In Search Of. . ." is a great party
record. It smacks of the Neptunes' previous work
in that sense. The lyrics are fairly empty, com
plaining of fake friends, lamenting the music in
dustry and serenading nameless women. That
aside, the songs make for great background music
at some booty-fest party. You might alternatively
hear them on the radio. They're precisely the type
of thing I'll expect to hear the next time I'm dri
ving through Tiburon or Millbrae or Pleasanton.
That reminds me: I need some new gauze for the
glove compartment.
