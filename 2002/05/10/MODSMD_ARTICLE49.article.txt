country music, '50s rock and sad tolk may sound
just right.
Equal parts wry and lonely, country and rock
'n' roll, the Brooklyn-based quintet's third full
length, "The Ghost of Fashion," promises to im
press. The band sometimes induces laughter,
other-times reflection, but always praise. This
record may not instantly lock itself in any CI) play
er, but the melodies will linger, the arrangements
will impress and this album will soon return to any
one's record rotation.
Although a quick look at the track listing re
veals titles like "Joan Jett of Arc," "Ancient Chi
nese Secret Blues" and"The Junky Jews," don't
write this band off as joke rockers. Songwriter
and front man Eef Barzelay does indeed have a
sharp sense of humor; however, his music works
on nearly all levels and certainly surpasses gim
micky song names.
"Let's Explode," the opening track, orients lis
teners to the band's brand of punk-country rock
and to Barzelay's whiny, slightly nasal, but highly

intimate, voice. A cross-sec
tion of the record, the first
song showcases Clem
Snide's singer / songwriter
folk, and the group's louder
but tasteful rock. The won
derfully hokey melody al
most instantly demands a
substantial volume increase.
Like many of the
record's 13 tracks, "Ice
Cube" delivers a rock that
both sexes can equally
enjoy. These two minutes of

pop-country-bliss add an organ, moderately loud
guitars and a horn to Barzelay's by-now-distinct

voice. Throw in a few well-timed stops and
Band-like harmonies, and the result solidi
ties the song as one of the album's best.
With lyrics like "Don't be afraid of your
anger/I'll eat it with mustard and wine,"
Barzelay will no doubt roll a number ofeyes.
However, for as many "what?"s as he may

get, the songwriter evokes just as many smiles. For
example, on track .two, when the Buddy-Holly
lookalike sings' Tonight 1 feel like Elvis longing for
his long lost twin," listeners have no choice but to
laugh. Make no mistake: Barzelay's quirky humor
is not for everyone. But listeners who can't over
come the odd, satirical words will miss out on the
dynamic songs they accompany.
A pure pop "La Lit" chorus over catchy guitars
ranks "Moment in the Sun" as the record's best
song. Capturing all the sadness, angst and humor
in Barzelay's songwriting, this track will please
indie fans and KFOG-heads alike. And, actually
it's already happened. Not only has "Moment in
the Sun" become a favorite among record-store
clerks but the song's horns and understated
groove also caught the ears of several NBC execs.
The romantic comedy "Ed," one of the network's
most popular shows, now blasts the song every
Wednesday as its theme.
In response to this increased publicity and ap
pearances on Conan and Kilborne, Spin Art

records just released a
"Moment in the Sun" EP.
The disc includes both the
radio and album versions
of the song, three new
Barzelay tracks and a
remix of "Your Favorite
Music"â€”the title song
from Snide's second
record. However, even if
listeners only want "Mo
ment in the Sun," they'd
be better off buying "The
Ghost of Fashion."


It doesn't get any more fashionable than this.
