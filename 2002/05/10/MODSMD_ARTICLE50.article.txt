# A 						fun night of 'Teatro' with Joan Baez

### TIFFANY LEE 
Funny. That's probably
the one word I would use to
describe the show if I had to
pick only one word. What is
Teatro Zinzanni? A dinner
theater, live with acrobatics,
a scary Maitre d'Hotel and
a crazy chef. And fora limit

eel time (April 24 to July 17) Joan Baez, the renowned folk

music singer, will be playing the part or Lit Contessa,
the star singer and ringleader of what can only be de
scribed as a dinner circus.
Joan Baez does a great job not only leading the cir
cus of characters and circus acts, but also singing her
plethora of solos. She's great for this role, especially
since it was designed for her. When you first get in and
meet her, she describes the tent on Pier 29, (How cool
is it that? It takes place in a tent!) as a jewel box and the
audience as her jewels. When she closes the lid on the
jewel box, everyone is to leave the outside world be
hind and live in a state of suspended reality, at least for
the duration of the dinner. And it would be really hard
not to. There's always action, comedy and general za
niness surrounding you, wherever in the dining room
you might be sitting.
The Maitre d'Hotel, was by far my favorite charac
ter however — very scary, but in a goof) kind of way.
When you first see him, you think "creepy butler man
right out of a murder mystery story." His talent?
Sleight-of-hand tricks, making smoke rise from the
back of his impeccably pressed tuxedo when encoun
tering a pretty lady, and generally being the scary guy
that everyone fears. So where is his goofiness when the
cast seems to fear him? He's just funny. He looks a bit

like a vulture, and walks with his arms out to the side, like vul
ture wings. He hunches over and stalks around the room. And
he barely talks. I think I only heard him talk once the whole

evening and that was just to croak out an unintelligible sound

Another notable character? The incredibly insane Dali
esque chef who asked the audience to "find their chili."
What does this mean? Who knows, but it was really funny.
Often, he would pull members out of the audience to be
part of his production. To introduce the salad, for exam
ple, he found a bald guy whose head he made "art" by
popping out the center of a plate and putting the rim
around the guy's head, making the man's bald dome the
platter for a human salad. And surprisingly enough, all

the victims were more than happy to participate, creating an

even more fun-loving
and entertaining at
mosphere.
But it wasn't all
clowning around,
even though a lot of it
was. There were
amazing acrobatic
tricks, tap-dancing
and juggling acts.
The trapeze act was
amazing. Two people
shared a bar as they
spun, twirled and
used each other as an
extra trapeze bar.
During their perfor
mance, it wasn't un
common for the
woman to be hanging
upside down from
the man's feet, or vice
versa. They were re
ally, really flexible
and strong acrobats

who were absolutely amazing. It was truly an evening filled
with excitement, comedy and drama. What more could a
person ask for?


No, this is not a scene from "Where Are They Now?"
