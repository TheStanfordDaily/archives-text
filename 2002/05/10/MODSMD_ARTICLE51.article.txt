Dear Bobo,
Ask and ye shall receive. Here are some general kissing tech
nique tips for the masses, as well as some specific advice for
those of you stuck with a bad kisser.
First, it's entirely possible that he's not a horrible kisser per
se, just that his kissing style and yours aren't compatible. This
can be remedied. You didn't give me specifics on his technique,
so I'll try to touch on the biggest kissing problems.
Star Trek-tongue: Going boldly where no tongue has gone be
fore. This is the unfortunate situation where a guy inserts his
tongue so far into his partner's mouth that the gag reflex is trig
gered — good for bulimics, bad for everyone else. This is never
sexy. Seriously. And I've never heard ofa girl doing this. Why?
I commissioned a psych study on it, but my preliminary theo
ry is the Surrogate Penis Complex — for now, only his tongue
will be breaching those lips, so he's making the most of the sit
uation.
One-two-three-four, I declare a tongue war: Pretty self-ex
planatory. Tongue War ensues whenever boundaries are un
clear. So if vou're Yasser Arafat, and vou have a hot date with

Ariel Sharon, you're going to
need to put up some orange
cones in the West Bank. If
you leel like you're constantly
retreating and fighting off his
artillery with pebbles, then it
might be time to sit down and
discuss the situation. You
don't want to hurt his feel
ings, so tell him that you're
much more turned 011 by
gentle, non-invasive mea
sures. Then show him how
you like it.
Not a little spittle: It's line for
there to be saliva involved,
but not if it's involved with
your partner's chin, neck or
shirt. If the spit isn't con
tained in your mouths, you're
doing something wrong.
The "Clank": Usually the re
sult ofa little too much enthu
siasm and one two many rum
and cokes. This is when you
swoop in for the kiss, but so
does your partner, and you
end up smacking front teeth
together. It can be painful.
Slow the flick down.

And on to the general kissing tips...
Keep it slow. This may or may not be part of
foreplay, but there's very little that's sexier than
a long, amazing kiss. There's a reason MTV has
an award for best on-screen kiss. Start with just
lips, touching lightly together. Close your eyes;
don't think of anything. Concentrate on the sen
sations. Part your lips when it feels right. Move
closer. Don't forget to use your hands. Gently
rub your partner's back, neck, run your lingers
through their hair, trace a linger along the collar
bone, etc.
When you've done the tame stuff fora
while, get your tongue involved. Dart the tip of
your tongue out to touch her lower lip. You'll
find that Newton's Third Law of Motion is
true. Her tongue will come out to play. Make a
mental note of what she does. Generally, peo
ple kiss the way they want to be kissed. If she
pets your tongue with hers, feel free to recip
rocate. Ifshe gently bites your bottom lip, she's
not going to object to a nibble. When things
start heating up, let her know by voicing it.
You don't have to be articulate since your lips
are obviously preoccupied. Just make the kind
of noise that lets her know you're captivated.
Oh, and if you're going to be making out
for any length of time, shave; stubble equals
chafing.
