# He is sexy, he is funky, he is Prince

This is the eighth in a series of articles called 'The Record Bin" ex
ploring classic album from the past: pop music for people who like
pop music.

Writing this, I have a feeling
that many of you haven't paid
your proper respects to the I louse
ofSensual Synth-Funk that Prince
built. Freshmen and sophomores
at Stanford, you were probably
conceived to Prince jams and
don't even know it.

enigma of a man is responsible with some of the best songs of
the '80s and '90s. What is Prince's music, really? Undeniably,
it is everything all at once: the man synthesizes funk, R&B,
rock 'n' roll and slow-jams into a hypnotic mix of sound and
he sings of spirituality, sex, politics and God.
Over the past 20 years, Prince's strange exploits rival even
those of Michael Jackson: publicly flaunting his ambiguous
race and sexuality, enacting a moratorium on any press in
terviews in the early '90s, appearing in public with the word
"SLAVE" written on his face to protest his record label, a
marriage and annulment to a much younger lover (because
he decided that he couldn't support the "system" of mar
riage) and, of course, changing his name to an unpro
nounceable symbol and then back to "Prince" in 1999. In his
personal life, Prince in known to be very shy, soft-spoken and
secretive; through his music, however, Prince is able to be
himself: raunchy, religious and even political.
More recently, Prince has become a Jehovah's witness
convert and recanted much of his older work. I le still per
forms a few of these songs, but has a "no four-letter-words"
policy for his live performances. His newest albums are
eclectic and nearly gospel, discussing God, the afterlife and
all that jazz. Prince is also taken to throwing free public par
ties in liis huge Paisley Park studio complex in his home-

town, Minneapolis. On his recent tour, he would
announce the shows only a week or two in ad
vance and charge upwards of $150 per seat. And
he can get away with it. Why? Because his name is
Prince and he is funky and he is our era's serious
musical genius.

For me (and many others),
Prince released his most impor
tant music between 1980 and
1985. These records, including
"Dirty Mind," "Controversy,"
"1999," "Purple Rain" and
"Around The World In A Day,"
feature Prince crooning in falsetto,
dropping thick guitar riffs and ex-

perimenting with all sorts of synthesizers. It took
me a long time to realize that I love this music. My
exposure to Prince as a kid was limited to the hits
"When Doves Cry" and "Kiss" as well as the fantas-

tic "Batman" soundtrack, because my mother wouldn't
allow songs like "Come" and "Cream" into our house. As I
grew more interested in albums such as Beck's "Midnight
Vultures," however, I came back to Prince because nearly
every review I read of a Beck record traced his sound back
to Prince.
"Dirty Mind" was released in 1980, when Prince was only
22. It may not be as familiar as " 1999" and "Purple Rain," but
it is full of energetic, sexually transgressive romps and it
highlights the emergence of Prince as a great songwriter.
There is no filler found here; every track is memorable and
has its own flavor. This album was also the first time Prince's
explicitly carnal side was given full lyrical rein. The resulting
lyrics range from Prince lamenting a lost lover in "When You
Were Mine" to the intricacies of pleasing a woman in "Head"
to fantasizing an incestual sexual initiation in "Sister." It isn't
hard to understand why Prince ruffled so many conservative
feathers in his day. But Prince isn't just a swarthy sexual
predator. Many of his lyrics reflect the dichotomy he sees be
tween spirituality and sexuality.

The sound is almost
minimalist but the beats
and funky bass keep the
album together through
out. The stand-out tracks
are "Dirty Mind" and
"Uptown" which are
mostly narrative and fea
ture Prince singing about
how much he wants to
fuck you, throwing in oc
casional messages about
freedom and individuali
ty once he has gotten
your attention. The last
track "Partyup" is an
anti-war party jam in
which Prince reiterates
that he's about love and

music, not violence. The song ends with Prince chanting,
"You're gonna have to fight your own damn war / Cuz w:
don't wanna fight no more!" As we reach the end of "Dirty
Mind," Prince has managed to get us hot, share lurid sexual
fantasies and preach about peace and love â€” and all in less
time than it took Weezer to stink up the place with the
"Green Album."
It doesn't matter where you start with Prince's music, as
long as you start sometime soon. There is no stigma attached
to listening to this music, just let yourselfbecome a part of the
massive, sweaty, purple velvet that is Prince's soundscape.
Since he exploded in the '80s, Prince has proved himself to
be one of the most prolific and important artists of our era.
He is allowed to be as shy, self-absorbed, strange and fickle
as he is, because the music is just so damn good. Prince
should be the soundtrack to every dance party ever.
Prince is part of a Parthenon of sex-groove riffs and pul
sating beats: James Brown, Sly and the Family Stone,
George Clinton and Beck. It's all there, just waiting for you
to wake up and smell the funk.


On the verge of bein' obscene.
