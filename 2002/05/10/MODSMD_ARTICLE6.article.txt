Students can enjoy artwork, food, danc
ing and music this weekend at the 32nd an
nual Stanford Spring Faire hosted by the
Bridge Peer Counseling Center.
The faire will showcase more than 100
West Coast artisans who will exhibit and
sell their work. International food vendors
will set up booths at the event. Also, dance
and vocal groups will also perform.
Artisans sent in applications for the fair
earlier this year, according to senior Jude
Leung, the fair's coordinator. The artisans
were selected in February based mostly on

" The quality of the vendors has
greatly increased," said coordinator
Jared Boyce, a coterminal student in

For many of the fair organizers, just

"This will be my fourth Spring Faire,
and I've always spent the entire weekend
at the fair," Boyce said. "What I like most
about the fair is socializing with the artists.

with incredibly varied backgrounds, and I
treasure being able to get to know them
better."
Last year, the fair attracted about
1 (),()()() to 12,000 people, Leung said. She
expects the turnout to be greater this
year due to increased publicity for the
event.
Junior Molly lanenbaum, the fair's
publicity coordinator, said that the event
is also open to community members out
side of Stanford.
"I really like how it's an event geared to
ward both students and local residents,"
Tanenbaum said. "Spring Faire attracts an
interesting mix of people to White Plaza
because there is quite a variety of arts,
crafts, food and entertainment."
The fair is organized by student mem
bers of the Bridge.
