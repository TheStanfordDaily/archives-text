Students can enjoy artwork, food, danc
ing and music this weekend at the 32nd an
nual Stanford Spring Faire hosted by the
Bridge Peer Counseling Center.
The faire will showcase more than 100
West Coast artisans who will exhibit and
sell their work. International food vendors
will set up booths at the event. Also, dance
and vocal groups will also perform.
Artisans sent in applications for the fair
earlier this year, according to senior Jude
Leung, the fair's coordinator. The artisans
were selected in February based mostly on
I he quality of the their work, shown in pho
tographs that they mailed in.
" The quality of the vendors has
greatly increased," said coordinator
Jared Boyce, a coterminal student in
philosophy. "We were very happy with
the number of new high quality applica
tions we received this year, so our fair
has a good amount of new blood in ad
dition to more high-quality artists."
For many of the fair organizers, just
meeting the artists is a valuable experience.

"This will be my fourth Spring Faire,
and I've always spent the entire weekend
at the fair," Boyce said. "What I like most
about the fair is socializing with the artists.
All of our artists are wonderful people
with incredibly varied backgrounds, and I
treasure being able to get to know them
better."
Last year, the fair attracted about
1 (),()()() to 12,000 people, Leung said. She
expects the turnout to be greater this
year due to increased publicity for the
event.
Junior Molly lanenbaum, the fair's
publicity coordinator, said that the event
is also open to community members out
side of Stanford.
"I really like how it's an event geared to
ward both students and local residents,"
Tanenbaum said. "Spring Faire attracts an
interesting mix of people to White Plaza
because there is quite a variety of arts,
crafts, food and entertainment."
The fair is organized by student mem
bers of the Bridge.
"I love how a bunch of college students
with very little experience in this
area can work together to run a
successful business, produce such
an amazing event and have crazy
fun at the same time," Leung
said.
The Spring Faire serves as the
sole source of funding for the
Bridge. According to Leung, all
proceeds from this event go to
wards the maintenance of the
center's counseling phone lines
and support for the staff.
"Since the Faire is the Bridge's
only fundraiser, it's incredible

that it works every year to keep us
going," Tanenbaum said.
The Bridge is a student-run
group that "offers free, confiden
tial, 24-hour peer counseling
services to Stanford and (lie
neighboring community." At the
fair, the Bridge Center will be
hosting an informational booth
featuring cotton candy and heli
um balloons.
"I hope the Faire will help to
raise awareness on and off cam
pus about our services as a peer
counseling center and about
mental health at Stanford in gen
eral," Tanenbaum said.
The fair will be held at White
Plaza from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
today, Saturday and Sunday.
