# Students perform at Spring Migration
## 
### CHRISTINE LIYANTO 
Who would have thought that one of Frederic
Chopin's biggest fans would suddenly find himself
mesmerized by the steady beats of hip hop? Or that an
amateur boxer would turn in his gloves to take up
modern dance?
Or that these two talented students would meet dur
ing their freshman year and create something musical
three years later?
Enter seniors Steve Kalogeras and Scott Lowe, l lie
Stanford Dance Division's Spring Migration 2002 —
which continues tonight and tomorrow in Roble
Gym —features their original live performance.
Lowe choreographed a dance and will perform a
dance called "All in Love is War," which is set to
Kalogeras's live score, "Hip Hop Ballet, Movement I."
These seniors' performing arts prowess is less the re
sult of meticulous training and more the outcome of a
coincidental stumbling upon hidden talent.
Kalogeras began playing the piano at age 13, decid
ing to make use of the untouched piano in his home. He
played by ear in his self-taught pursuit and immediate
ly fell in love with classical music.
At Stanford, Kalogeras started playing percussion in
struments, which developed an interest in funk and soul
music within him. By his sophomore year, he was intro
duced to hip hop beats and began dropping them into
his favorite Chopin pieces.
"[The] music gave me an urgency," Kalogeras said.
"When a beat turns each time, you're waiting for it to
come back."
Kalogeras's "Hip 1 lop Ballet" is a manifestation of his
dynamic musical exposure.
"Classical music is the most powerful emotionally
and expressively," he said, "and hip hop beats are
the most powerful rhythmically. I wanted to com
bine the two."
With an Undergraduate Research Program grant,
Kalogeras was able to dedicate last summer to working
on his musical score. In a matter of weeks before his
debut at last week's first Spring Migration set, lie was
able to put together an entire orchestra of 20 musicians
fora live performance of the piece.
1 le also joins them, playing the piano.
Kalogeras wanted to combine his music with dance
for greater effect.
"1 like having music accompanied with human ac
tion, human drama," Kalogeras said. "I'd much rather
have choreography added to my music than words.
Words are confusing."
