# Students perform at Spring Migration

### CHRISTINE LIYANTO 
Who would have thought that one of Frederic
Chopin's biggest fans would suddenly find himself
mesmerized by the steady beats of hip hop? Or that an
amateur boxer would turn in his gloves to take up
modern dance?
Or that these two talented students would meet dur
ing their freshman year and create something musical
three years later?
Enter seniors Steve Kalogeras and Scott Lowe, l lie
Stanford Dance Division's Spring Migration 2002 —
which continues tonight and tomorrow in Roble
Gym —features their original live performance.
Lowe choreographed a dance and will perform a
dance called "All in Love is War," which is set to
Kalogeras's live score, "Hip Hop Ballet, Movement I."
These seniors' performing arts prowess is less the re
sult of meticulous training and more the outcome of a
coincidental stumbling upon hidden talent.
Kalogeras began playing the piano at age 13, decid
ing to make use of the untouched piano in his home. He
played by ear in his self-taught pursuit and immediate
ly fell in love with classical music.
At Stanford, Kalogeras started playing percussion in
struments, which developed an interest in funk and soul
music within him. By his sophomore year, he was intro
duced to hip hop beats and began dropping them into
his favorite Chopin pieces.
"[The] music gave me an urgency," Kalogeras said.
"When a beat turns each time, you're waiting for it to
come back."
Kalogeras's "Hip 1 lop Ballet" is a manifestation of his
dynamic musical exposure.
"Classical music is the most powerful emotionally
and expressively," he said, "and hip hop beats are
the most powerful rhythmically. I wanted to com
bine the two."
With an Undergraduate Research Program grant,
Kalogeras was able to dedicate last summer to working
on his musical score. In a matter of weeks before his
debut at last week's first Spring Migration set, lie was
able to put together an entire orchestra of 20 musicians
fora live performance of the piece.
1 le also joins them, playing the piano.
Kalogeras wanted to combine his music with dance
for greater effect.
"1 like having music accompanied with human ac
tion, human drama," Kalogeras said. "I'd much rather
have choreography added to my music than words.
Words are confusing."
Kalogeras sought out Lowe, a friend since freshman

Senior Scott Lowe performs at Spring Migration last week. He will perform
again tonight and tomorrow night at 8 p.m. in Roble Gym.
year, to choreograph the human el
ement he was looking for.
Lowe was an amateur boxer
with a Junior Olympics gold
medal before he began dancing
two years ago. He quit boxing to
avoid injury, and it was through
other people that dancing be
came a consideration.
"When 1 got [to Stanford],
people started noticing that 1 can
dance," Lowe said, with a modest
shrug.
I lis athletic background proved
useful as he began taking dance
c lasses and joining campus dance
groups such as Urban Styles.
"Boxing definitely informs my
dancing," Lowe said. "I think it is
dancing."
He combined t he grace of mod
ern dance and the rhythm of hip
hop to create a new genre for his
performance.
"I don't like the idea of just mix
ing things," Lowe said. "1 want to

create something new, something
original. I was nervous about
[choreographing] because I only
started dancing sophomore year, so
I was still learning... I still am
learning."
Nerves did not end there.
"I kept getting more nervous
when it looked like [the piece] was
going to come together," Lowe
said. "When it looked like it was ac
tually going to happen—
[Kalogeras] got a grant to compose,
1 got a grant to choreograph."
"Me too," Kalogeras said, laugh
ing. "When the orchestra came to
gether, at our first rehearsal, I just
ran out. 1 said 1 had to go wash my
hands. I was confronted with the
fact that I had to pull this off and
that there was an orchestra waiting
for me."
Kalogeras and Lowe con
structed their piece to have uni
versal appeal.
"1 don't want [my music] to be
something people have to figure
out," Kalogeras said. "I want it to be
something people can connect to
on an intrinsic level."
The universality in the message

of Lowe's dancing involves the
theme of relationships.
"I wanted to portray the mix of
emotions you have in relation
ships," Lowe said, "love and
hate. . .and some crazy ex-girl
friends."
Lowe will continue dancing over
the summer by being an apprentice
fora professional choreographer.
Kalogeras said he hopes to contin
ue composing music as well.
The two joked about how
much they "excel" in each other's
area of expertise.
"I'm tone deaf," Lowe said, "and
Steve's a pretty good mimer."
Though the musician and the
dancer may communicate in differ
ent languages, both speak strongly
through art.
"Our friendship wasn't based
around dance or music for the first
couple of years," Kalogeras said,
"but we both evolved together."
Kalogeras and Lowe's work can
be seen in Spring Migration 2002
tonight and tomorrow night at
8:30 p.m. in RobleGym. Tickets are
$8 for students and $10 for the gen
eral public.
