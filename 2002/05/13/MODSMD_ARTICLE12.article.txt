Trees that look like male
genitalia raise eyebrows
SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) —The trees in Gillian
Greensite's yard are causing a stir after a neighbor
called police, saying the evergreens look like male
genitalia.
Police and a city attorney looked into the matter
but determined Greensite's trees — phallic or
not — are protected as artistic expression and are
not criminal.
Many trees are phallic by nature, but some residents
say Greensite carefully trims her trees and shrubs every
few months, making them phallic by design.
Greensite, who is director of the University of Cali
fornia, Santa Cruz's rape prevention and counseling

program, said she's had the trees lor 15 years and isn't
making a sexual statement.
"Ifthey want to see phallic, they see phallic , I guess,"
she said. "I see trees."
