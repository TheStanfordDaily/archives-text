On May 13, 1981, The Daily printed an ar
ticle about the University institulinga foreign
language requirement.
"The list of graduation requirements at the
University may be extended to include the
study of foreign language il 'the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies' (CUS) proposal is
adopted by the Faculty Senate on Thursday.
"Beginning with the freshman class enter
ing in 1982, tlie committee is recommending
that students satisfy one of the following:
• complet ion of the third quarter of first
year language study at Stanford;
• demonstration by exam of competency
at a level comparable to one year of study at
Stanford; or
• completion of a third-year course of one
foreign language in high school.
"Committee member Ralph Hester, pro
lessor of French and Italian, said CUS has
been discussing foreign language lor ten
years. He said that the discussions became
more focused in 197b [with] a resolution by
the Senate of the Academic Council directing
the University to study ways to encourage
foreign language studies.
"According to Hester, the resolution was
designed to encourage students to fulfill the
humanities distribution requirement with a
foreign language. After first year languages
no longer completed the humanities require
ment, a change in University policy required
students to take the language for two years in
order to fulfill the requirement."
Bottom Line: Before a foreign language require
ment, how else could one beat the system to guar
antee good housing?
