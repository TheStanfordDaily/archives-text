# Daily battles Knights
## Shorthanded Daily pulls out win in close Softball contest 
### 
A group of seven all-star soft ball players
from Hie Stanford Daily outlasted llie
Knight .Fellows, 6-3, in a Saturday softball
game that ranked in importance with the
seventh game of the World Series.
Program director Jim Bettinger led the
Knight Fellows with his pitching and even
helped out behind the plate for the Daily
team, which was a little shorthanded due to
the early start time of 11:()() a.m.
"I don't know why we could only muster
seven people," said Editor in Chief Mark
Boucher. "Apparently everyone was out late
on Friday night... doing journalistic re
search, obviously."
Boucher pitched for the Daily team,
relying on his Mariano Rivera-like un
derhand cut fastball to silence the Knight
Fellows' bats. Future Business Manager
Scott Dorfman postponed a trip to Reno
to help out with sterling defense at first
base. Also sparkling in the field were
Sports Editor Aaron Eevine and Staff
Columnist Jonathan Stull. Finally, Wire
Editor Mark Thoma did not even need a
glove in left field to haul in everything

that was hit his way.
Thoma and former Intermission Editor
Kim Samek led The Daily's offensive attack
with three hits each and superb baserun
ning. The daring Thoma routinely took
extra bases on overthrows, while Samek was
a master of extending the basepaths to avoid
being tagged out. Managing Editor for Spe
cial Sections Sameer Ahmed showed up
around the fifth inning but still managed to
knock in one run.
Early Las Vegas lines on the game put
the Knight Fellows as heavy favorites
given their ability to place 14 players in
the field at once while the Daily had to
make do with either a shortstop or a third
baseman, but not both. The Knight Fel
lows also had the advantage of the jour
nalistic versions of Major League Baseball
phenomenon Ichiro Suzuki: several of
their players had never before played
baseball in the United States. As Suzuki
did when he first stepped on to the field
for the Seattle Mariners, these players
shocked all who were in attendance with
their raw talent.
Nevertheless, The Daily was able to
emerge victorious from the friendly con
fines of Roble Field, thus avenging last
year's loss.
