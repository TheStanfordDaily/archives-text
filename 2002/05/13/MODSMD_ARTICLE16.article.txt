Red meat is bad, white meat is
good, fish is best. That seems to be the
mantra when it comes to heart dis
ease. Researchers have known for
many years that red meats are rich in
cholesterol and increase the risks of
coronary blockage.
Now, many studies are providing
evidence that fish can actually help
the cardiovascular system. The key
seems to be omega-3, a polyunsatu
rated fatty acid. It is not produced
by humans, but found in high quan
tities in oily fishes such as salmon
and mackerel.
One study found that men with
the highest levels of omega-3 were
81 percent less likely to have a sud
den heart attack than those with
lower levels. Another study com
pared women who eat fish five times
a week to women who eat it less than
once a month, and found that the
former had a 45 percent lower risk of
fatal heart attach and a 34 percent

lower risk of heart disease.
French doctors recently announced
that they successfully cured four boys
with "bubble boy" disease using gene
therapy. Individuals with this disorder
do not produce T-cells and B-cells,
which are the immune system's weapons
against foreign agents. As a result, any
kind of infection can be deadly.
About two and a half years ago, the
French researcher extracted some cells,
corrected the defect and reinserted
them. Today, the four individuals are
still leading normal lives.
Experts hail this as a first major vic
tory of gene therapy. One of the great
est obstacles of gene therapy is pin
pointing exactly which cells express a
defective gene, since almost all cells in
the body are genetically identical and
carry the mutation.
Watch for the name Botox in plastic
surgery circles. Discovering Botox as a
cure for wrinkles happened accidentally.
The drug was traditionally used to
treat twitchy eye muscles, until doctors

noticed it also removed wrinkles from
patients' faces. The Food and Drug Ad
ministration approved last month that
the drug he commercialized specifically
for its anti-wrinkle effects.
Botox is short for botulism toxin, a di
lute nerve poison. The compound
works by keeping nervous tissue from
contracting or squeezing underlying
muscles. Effects tend to wear off'after six
months, so the patient must get another
round of $500 shots.
By the year 2015, Pluto's orbit might
be explored by spacecraft for the first
time. For years, astronomers have seen
Pluto as an anomaly, and today it is still
the least studied of the nine planets.
The Solar System has four rocky bod
ies (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars) and
four gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
Pluto) separated by an asteroid belt.

Pluto's icy world does not really lit
in either group. Theories claim
that Pluto is in fact the biggest ob
ject in an asteroid belt beyond the
Solar System. Evidence for this so
called Kuiper belt has been accu
mulating in recent years.
NASA wishes to send a probe to
Pluto to study the Kuiper belt and
gain a better insight into what the
early Solar System was like. If Con
gress approves funding for the
project, the spacecraft will be

launched by (he year 2()()(i.
Lack of darkness can disrupt an an
imal's life cycle. In 1988, researcher
Kenneth Frank observed that arti
ficial lightning caused moths to lly
too much, and thus perish. Since
then, little formal work has oc
curred in t lie field.
However, a renaissance now
seems to be underway. Scientists
at Utica College in New York
have discovered that sudden ex
posure to artificial light causes
nocturnal frogs to stop normal
feeding and reproductive behav
ior, and sit motionless long after
the light has been turned off.
Salamanders cannot navigate

from one pond to another under
yellow or red light.
Such discoveries are increasing
our understanding of how artificial
light can disrupt behavior and
physiology in animals â€” perhaps
even humans.
More bubbly champagne may
be on its way: geneticist Thomas
Mike and colleagues at the CSRIC)
biotechnology company in Aus
tralia just planted a hybrid variety
of vine that produces more grapes
and less foliage.
fhe researchers essentially
combined two existing varieties of
grapevines and selected desired

qualities to produce the hybrid.
The company has justified its pro
ject by arguing thai humans have
been conducting artificial selection
for thousands of years by planting
I hose vines I hat gave more and bet
ter grapes. 1 lowever, the grapes
will not reach markets until after
extensive testing, which will take at
least a decade.
Meanwhile, geneticists elsewhere
are more cautious. Jean-Michel
Boursicjuot of the French viticulture
agency ENTAV thinks that plants
keep a balance between fruits and fo
liage fora specific reason, and that
changing the balance so quickly may
have unintended consequences.
