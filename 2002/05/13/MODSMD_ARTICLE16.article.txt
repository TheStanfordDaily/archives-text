Red meat is bad, white meat is
good, fish is best. That seems to be the
mantra when it comes to heart dis
ease. Researchers have known for
many years that red meats are rich in
cholesterol and increase the risks of
coronary blockage.
Now, many studies are providing
evidence that fish can actually help
the cardiovascular system. The key
seems to be omega-3, a polyunsatu
rated fatty acid. It is not produced
by humans, but found in high quan
tities in oily fishes such as salmon
and mackerel.
One study found that men with
the highest levels of omega-3 were
81 percent less likely to have a sud
den heart attack than those with
lower levels. Another study com
pared women who eat fish five times
a week to women who eat it less than
once a month, and found that the
former had a 45 percent lower risk of
fatal heart attach and a 34 percent

lower risk of heart disease.
French doctors recently announced
that they successfully cured four boys
with "bubble boy" disease using gene
therapy. Individuals with this disorder
do not produce T-cells and B-cells,
which are the immune system's weapons
against foreign agents. As a result, any
kind of infection can be deadly.
About two and a half years ago, the
French researcher extracted some cells,
corrected the defect and reinserted
them. Today, the four individuals are
still leading normal lives.
Experts hail this as a first major vic
tory of gene therapy. One of the great
est obstacles of gene therapy is pin
pointing exactly which cells express a
defective gene, since almost all cells in
the body are genetically identical and
carry the mutation.
Watch for the name Botox in plastic
surgery circles. Discovering Botox as a
cure for wrinkles happened accidentally.
The drug was traditionally used to
treat twitchy eye muscles, until doctors

noticed it also removed wrinkles from
patients' faces. The Food and Drug Ad
ministration approved last month that
the drug he commercialized specifically
for its anti-wrinkle effects.
Botox is short for botulism toxin, a di
lute nerve poison. The compound
works by keeping nervous tissue from
contracting or squeezing underlying
muscles. Effects tend to wear off'after six
months, so the patient must get another
round of $500 shots.
By the year 2015, Pluto's orbit might
be explored by spacecraft for the first
time. For years, astronomers have seen
Pluto as an anomaly, and today it is still
the least studied of the nine planets.
The Solar System has four rocky bod
ies (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars) and
four gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
Pluto) separated by an asteroid belt.
