## The
						Stanford Daily Powwow merits more interest from students 
### 
Published Since 1891

As the largest student-run powwow
in the United States and the largest
powwow on the West Coast, the
Stanford American Indian Organi
zation's annual Stanford Powwow plays an
integral role in the making the University a
vibrant and hospitable environment for ex
pressions of Native American culture.
We congratulate SAIO on another fantas
tic event, arid we believe that the powwow's
overwhelming success merits it more atten
tion and involvement from the Stanford
community at large.
The powwow annually draws over
30,000 attendees from all across the nation
to the Eucalyptus Grove, but the relatively
smaller number of Stanford students who
attend suggests that the campus communi
ty is missing out on a worthwhile program.

The core group of around 20 volunteers
puts a tremendous amount of time and ef
fort into the year-long planning process.
Students should take an hour or two from
their weekend to peruse the wealth of cul
ture and diversity on display at the event.
Of course, many non-SAIO students did
attend the event, and a fair number lent a
hand in organizing the festivities. We urge
everyone to consider doing the same
next year.
The powwow is unique in that it is un
usual for an event of such national promi
nence to stem from the efforts of a small
group of college students. Its uniqueness
should mark it out as a must-attend pro
gram for anyone with any interest in Native
American culture.
Besides the obvious goal of cultural cele

bration, SAIO intends the event as an edu
cational opportunity fora community that
once associated Native American culture
primarily with the stereotypical dances and
war cries of the University's former football
mascot.
The organization's other educational
goal — to demonstrate to Native Ameri
cans in the Bay Area and around the coun
try the possibility of simultaneously cele
brating the unity and diversity of their cul
tures — must be considered an unquali
fied success. In order for the former goal to
be considered fully met, however, more
students must take the initiative to trek
down to Galvez St.and participate in the
proceedings.
The powwow is just one example of the
plethora of worthwhile cultural celebrations

on campus. It happens to be one that fea
tures the talents of not only Stanford stu
dents, but also of Native Americans from
around the state and the country. Students
who say to themselves, "I don't have an in
terest in Native American cultures, so why
should I attend?" can probably find an an
swer contained within their question.
One can spend four years at Stanford
without ever attending an event that cele
brates a culture different from one's own.
Many students do this, and still leave Stan
ford having obtained a good education.
Yet lew other universities in the world can
equal the wealth of opportunity for cultural
enrichment that is available here. Students
who fail to take advantage of this opportuni
ty miss out on one of the best parts of the
Stanford experience.
