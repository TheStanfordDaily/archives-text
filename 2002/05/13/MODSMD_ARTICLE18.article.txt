# DANCING IN CIRCLES
## The
						fuzzy side of science 
### 
Look around: just about everything
we use every day was designed
and manufactured under the di
rection of engineers. Technology
profoundly influences our daily lives and
the kinds of communities we build. But the
way higher education is set up, it seems that
engineers worry only about technology and
ignore troubling questions about what con-

sequences that technolo
gy might have.
In mechanical engi
neering classes, we've had
lectures about ethics.
We've learned about the
importance of building a
safety factor into our de
signs to protect users,
even if this translates to a

more expensive product.
We've learned about patents and the im
portance of protecting intellectual proper
ty. We've even learned that it's okay to
argue with the boss if it seems that her deci
sion will endanger life or property.
And lor the most part, engineering stu
dents are a pretty ethical bunch. There is a
spirit of cooperation that can only be
achieved through trust and lair play.
But it seems that the ethical problems
we've talked about in relation to the design
process are also the kinds of transgressions
that are likely to get you, your boss or your
company in trouble.
You just can't get away with building a
tire that's going to explode on the freeway.
Even if that tire didn't violate any govern
ment standards, profits are still goingto suf
fer.
But what about the things you can get
away with? What if you manufacture per
fect silicon chips that never fail on a cus
tomer, but you don't pay the workers who
produce them enough money to live on?
What if you build an oil refinery that pro
duces superb gasoline, but once in a while it
spews toxic clouds into nearby neighbor
hoods? It's not illegal to buy rights to land
in a poor community and process your
chemicals there. But it is manipulative, and
it might give people cancer.
More subtly, what about the ways in
which our technologies influence the social
roles we play? What about gendered prod
ucts that help to segregate the interests of
male and female children?
And what about the decisions that go
into developing new products? In mechan
ical engineering we talk a lot about
"needfinding''—the process of figuring
out what types of new products peo pie
would like to use.
I'm all for Palm Pilots and fast Internet
access. But before we pour time and money
into developing these conveniences, per
haps we should work on designing simpler
ways to create a sanitation system, or a
cheaper way to make eyeglasses. People's
basic necessities need to come first.
But, people say, we are taking into ac
count the needs of the public. Most new

technology is driven, if not by the military,
then by market research. People express
their preferences for what they want to see
developed by buying the products that are
useful to them. But the thing is, you only
get to vote if you are a participant in a cer
tain sector of the market — that is, if you
have extra money to spend on things that
don't include food and shelter.
The first article of the Code of Ethics in
stituted by professional engineering soci
eties reads: "Engineers uphold and ad
vance the integrity, honor and dignity of
the engineering profession by using their
knowledge and skill for the enhancement
of human welfare." How is it that dumping
toxic waste near a school doesn't violate this
code?
That's a political issue, you might say. It's
not a technological problem, but a social
one.
But why do those two categories have to
be separate? We need to get to work build
ing social solutions into the technological
ones. For example, instead of increasing
the pace of new product development, we
could slow down a bit and use the extra en
ergy to find solutions to the waste problems
those products create. Instead of moving
our factories to other countries with lower
environmental standards, maybe we could
face the music and work on cleaning up our
own messes.
Technology is by no means an answer to
social inequality. But it can be a starting
point, and Lord knows we need a multi
pronged attack. And maybe that's a political
statement, but then as the saying goes, ev
erything is political. The decision not to in
clude a broader scope of ethics in engineer
ing education representsa political position
as well.
When a bridge falls and we condemn the
engineering firm that used the cheap bolts
instead of the strong ones, that is certainly a
moral judgment rather than a political one.
People are hurt, and that is obviously a mat
ter of right and wrong. But when we're
talking about a whole group of people who
lack the political power and the resources
necessary to raise a fuss and hurt profits,
then it's political? Where do you draw the
line? Why does it matter which people get
hurt?
Some of these issues are raised in a few of
the science, technology and society classes
offered here. But engineers are only re
quired to take one of those, and this class is
generally viewed simply as a requirement
rather than an integral part of the engi
neering major. If we are really serious
about using our skills as engineers to create
a better society, ethics should be taught
alongside the technical material, as an
equally important part of the engineering
program.
