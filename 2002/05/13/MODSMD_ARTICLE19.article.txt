Crosetto responds to former ASSU officer
I am writing to respond to the untrue
claims and personal attacks leveled against
me by David Robinson in his letter in Fri
day's Daily.
Robinson claimed that somehow I had
taken a confrontational approach in my
challenge to the election. 1 hat is the fur
thest thing from the truth. I was more than
polite in each and every interaction I had
with those involved. Unfortunately, I can
not say the same of those who dealt with my
claim from the other end, especially, but
not only, Gedioen Aloula, the chairman of
the Elections Commission.
Robinson further claimed that I was ig
norant and that my objections were inco
herent. I have never claimed to be all
knowing about the ASSU, in fact I made it
clear to Aloula, former President Mall
Brewer, Undergraduate Senator Bo
Cowgill and others that I needed guidance
in the proper protocol. However, Aloula
acted complicitly to use said protocol to
delay and stonewall the process.
Further, if anyone involved in the pro
cess made incoherent arguments, ii was in
deed both the Elections Commission and
Robinson. The official response thai the
Elections Commission sent me was rile with
errors of many sorts, in contrast to the brief
I filed which was generally clear. Ihe inter
esting difference is that while the Elections
Commission spent nine days writing its
document, 1 spent 90 minutes.
Finally, Robinson's claim that the Elec
tions Commission had no responsibility to
respond to my complaint is incorrect and
untrue. In fact, a member of the Constitu
tional Council had asked Aloula to file a
written response to expedite the proceed
ings before the Council thai never occurred
due to Aloula's stonewall tac tics. Bui (here
is a larger point to be made here. I low can
the ASSU claim to be approachable and re
sponsive to students il it decides at will lo ig
nore points of view that they disagree with?
Fhe letter by Robinson is just another
strand in a line of personal attacks thai have
been leveled against me and my character
by persons who have never met me or even
interacted with me.
Say what you will about the legitimacy of
my challenge hut personal attacks only
serve to undermine any moral authority
that those in the ASSU may have had.

Hindu Students Council
condemns violence in Gujarat
This is a letter responding to Sue hit ra Se
bastian's letter on Friday ("I lindu Students
Council should address situation in Cu
jarat," 5/10). The Hindu Students Council
has taken steps to address the recent vio
lence in India. In fact, after the (Jujarat vio
lence lx*gan, we released a press release
strongly condemning the violence. We
spoke out against both the initial train attack
on Hindus in Coclhra and the subsequent

backlash against Muslims.
In addition, along with the Muslim Stu
dents Awareness Network, we held a mo
ment of silence at Sanskrit i's Mela show on
Sunday for the victims of recent tragedies.
We have also been involved in raising funds
lor afire ted individuals. Ultimately, our or
ganization condemns violence regardless
of who is responsible for il.
We believe in giving representation to
myriad viewpoints, which we hope will Ibs
ter understanding and awareness within
the Stanford community. We appreciate
the input received during the past week.

Law Prof. Campbell will be missed
I lnink you lor your article on Pro
lessor Tom Campbell's new appointment
as dean of Berkeley's business school.
Much more could be said about Campbell's
contributions to the I.aw School and the
community here.
As a second-year law student who had
the privilege of doing independent re
search with Campbell last semester, I was
always impressed with his compassion and
bis very giv ing and generous interest in his
students. He was one of the first fat uity
members I met on transferring to Stanford
Law School this year, and he helped make
that transition easier.
I met (lampbell very briefly in Washing-
Ion several years ago, while he was serving
in the U.S. f louse of Representatives. At
the time, it struck me that be had stuck his
neck out on behalf of many important
human rights causes that weren't always
politically popular—from immigrants'
l ights to due process in deportation hear
ings to the devastating humanitarian con
sequences of the U.N. embargo against
Iraq.
I know that he has maintained his in
volvement in vat ions international human
rights issues. Several months ago, he trav
eled to Af rica to work on humanitarian and
development issues in Eritrea.

I am sure he will enrich Berkeley
through his presence, much though he will
be missed here at the law school.

'Hindus as Minorities' was a
worthwhile event
It is always a disappointment to find
narrow-mindedness amongst esteemed
Stanford colleagues. In recent letters to
I he Daily, Ashwini Deo and Maya l)odd
explicitly claimed that one of the many
talks held during Hinduism Awareness
Week, titled "Hindus as Minorities," was
inappropriate in light of recent Hindu-
Muslim riots. For those unaware of the
issue: a train-load of I Iindus torched by
Muslims in March resulted in heavy retal
iatory attacks against Muslims in many
parts of Gujarat, India. The deaths from
these religious clashes are, to say the least,
horrific and deplorable.
However, if Deo, Dodd and others
had their way, the talk on "Hindus as Mi
norities would not have happened. For
example, Deo said it was "irresponsible
to discuss such a topic." Dodd also
claimed "irresponsibility" in light of the
recent events.
Ill follow their logic, the plight of one
minority should be put aside if there is
controversy when they are a majority
elsewhere. I hat implies human l ights
abuses by various Islamic nations would
force us to ignore the condition of minor
ity Muslims in Bosnia, Kosovo and the
Kurds in the north of Iraq. And that any
harsh Israeli reprisals against Palestini
ans lor suicide attacks imply I should re
move the plight of Jews in the Holocaust
from history books everywhere. Does
that make sense?
Asa Kashmiri Ilindu, I can attest to the
long-suffering treatment of Hindu minori
ties. In the last If) years of attacks from the
Muslim majority spurred by insurgents,

our half-million strong population in
Rash mi i has dwindled to a lew tens of
thousands. Homes have been destroyed
and families torn asunder. 2(>(),()()() people
live in refugee (amps out side of New Delhi.
1 he rest have scattered ;tll over the world.
Is this issue somehow less valid than what
has Ix'en happening in (iujarat?
lb his credit, Prof. Damodar Sardesai,
who gave the talk in question, provided a
balanced, historical discussion of the
wrongs and rights <>l both I lindu and Mus
lim sides that resulted in the political-reli
gious climate in South India today. Con
sidering how strongly the above-men
tioned people feel about the issue, it would
have been nice if they a< tually showed up to
the talk and its ensuing <list ussion.
