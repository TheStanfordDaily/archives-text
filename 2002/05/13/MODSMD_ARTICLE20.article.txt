## Supporting the drug war supports terrorists 
### DAVID R. HENDERSON HOOVER INSTITUTION 
In recent months, the U.S. government
spent $10 million of our tax dollars for its
latest antidrug campaign. Its new pitch: if
you buy illegal drugs, you're supporting
terrorists, because terrorists are intimately
involved in the production, sale and distri
bution of drugs.
Guess what? 1 agree. People who buy il
legal drugs do support terrorists. But
here's what the government leaves out: by
making drugs illegal, the government is
supporting terrorists even more.
I lave you ever wondered why terror
ist groups get involved in the illegal drug
market and not, lor example, in the legal
market for Coca-Cola, soap or en
velopes? lhe inaccurate answer that
many people give is that the profits in
dealing drugs are incredibly high, which

attracts criminals.
But profits are not incredibly high, once
you adjust for risk: people in that trade
have a nasty tendency to die or go to prison,
and they insist on being compensated lor
that risk. Besides, if high profits were what
attracted criminals, why don't those same
high profits attract normal investors?
No. I he reason terrorists get involved
in illegal drugs is that they are criminals;
once a market is made illegal, the high
risk-adjusted prices of the illegal good re
ward those with "criminal skills." One
such "skill" is the ability and willingness to
murder people. That's why organized
crime took over the liquor industry during
Prohibition—and quickly exited when
Prohibition ended.
Moreover, the U.S. government is ef
fectively supporting left-wing terrorists
in Colombia. How so? Say you're a
Colombian coca producer trying to

make a peso. Working against you are
Colombia's military and police, pres
sured by U.S. government subsidies and
threats and aided by U.S. military per
sonnel and equipment.
1 he first thing you want is protection,
and the plate to go for protection is to
antigovernment people with guns who
know how to light. 1 wo such groups are
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia (FARC) and the National Lib
eration Army, both revolutionary left
ists. You don't have to be a left-wing ide
ologue yourself to decide to pay them
protection money, which is just what
many coca farmers and cocaine produc
ers do.
By one estimate, the revenue to FARC
from drug-related sources is more than
$(>()() million a year, which would make it
the best-funded terrorist group in the
world. Thus, the war against drugs actual

ly strengthens the position of the leftist in
surgents.
These insurgents have terrorized
Colombian society. Between 1981 and
198(i, for example, drug traffickers mur
dered more than 50 Colombian judges,
including 12 supreme court justices.
Colombian citizens are also terrorized:
more than 1 million of them emigrated in
the past live years. If a similar percentage
of Americans did the same, we would lose
14 million citizens—almost half Califor
nia's population.
A more informative ad line from the
U.S. government would be: "When you
support the drug war, you're supporting
terrorists."
