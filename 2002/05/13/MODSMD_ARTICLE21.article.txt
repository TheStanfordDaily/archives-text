TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Is
raeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon's Likud party voted early
today to reject the creation of a
Palestinian state, a major defeat
for Sharon that he feared would
increase international pressure on
Israel and tie his hands in poten
tial negotiations.
Yesterday, some Israeli re
servists pulled back from the Gaza
Strip after the government said it
had postponed an expected of
fensive in the Palestinian territo
ry. In Bethlehem, nearly 1,000
people attended the first Sunday
services in the Church of the Na
tivity since the end of a live-week
standoff there.
Sharon had strongly opposed
the resolution on an eventual
Palestinian suite and had tried to
prevent the vote, but his efforts
were rejected and the Likud Cen
tral Committee overwhelmingly
approved the proposal by a show
of hands.
Though the party body does not

have the power to remove Sharon
from office, the vote showed his po
litick weakness in his own camp,
which could limit his effectiveness
and provided an ominous sign for
his future leadership of the party
ahead of the next election, sched
uled for November 2003.
Behind the confrontation with
Sharon was ex-premier Benjamin
Netanyahu, who has announced
his plans to challenge Sharon for
party leadership and eventually,
prime minister.
Only a handful of delegates
voted against the Netanyahu
backed resolution, which read, "No
Palestinian state will be created west
of the Jordan (River)," referring to
the area including the West Bank,
Israel and the Gaza Strip.
Opposition to a Palestinian
state has been the traditional posi
tion of the Likud, but Sharon has
said that under stringent condi
tions, he would agree to creation
of such a state, at one point calling
it "inevitable."
