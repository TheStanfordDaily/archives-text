# Pavarotti's career ends
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — For Lu
ciano Pavarotti, it's over. For Sal
vatore Licitra, it's just beginning.
On a night of high drama at the
opera house, Pavarotti disappoint
ed thousands of his fans by decid
ing at the last minute he was too ill
with the flu to sing the closing per
formance of the Metropolitan
Opera season. Licitra, a young Si
cilian tenor, went on instead —
and scored the most triumphant
Met debut in recent memory.
Licitra (pronounced li-CHEE
tra) sang the role of painter Mario
Cavaradossi in Puccini's "Tosca"
on Saturday, and with his bright,
ringing sound and confident
manner quickly won the affection
of the 4,000 people who packed
the house — as well as 3,000
more watching a live telecast on
the Lincoln Center plaza outside.
They showered him with extend
ed applause and bravos after both
his big arias and a 2 1/2-minute
standing ovation at the end of the
performance, bringing tears to

his eyes.
For Pavarotti, closeted in his
apartment just a few blocks south
of the opera house, the cancella
tion likely marked a mournful end
to a glorious Met career that began
with his appearance in Puccini's
"La Boheme" in 1908 — the same
year Licitra was born.
At 66, after 373 Met perfor
mances of 20 roles, he is absent
from the roster next season —
and Met general manager
Joseph Volpe made it clear he
would not be returning in staged
opera, though he might be invit
ed back fora concert or recital.
Nor does he have performances
booked at any of the world's other
opera houses.
Pavarotti had kept the audi
ence guessing until the very last
minute, with no sign posted in the
lobby as usually happens when a
star cancels. When the house
lights went down and the spot
light came up on stage, there were
groans of dread.
