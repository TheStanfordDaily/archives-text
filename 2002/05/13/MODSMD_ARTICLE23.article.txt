4), 4-0. Saturday saw talented No.
33-48 seed Pepperdine (13-14,
ranked No. 36) fall, 4-0, to the Car
dinal as well (In the tournament,
only the top 32 teams are seeded
individually. The other teams are
divided into two groups).
Both matches were played at
home, giving Stanford the unusu
al luxury of potentially winning a
championship without ever leav

ing town.
"Everyone looked like they
were feeling good out there," se
nior Gabriela Lastra said.
Sacramento State, which ad
vanced to the tournament by win
ning its first-ever Big Sky Confer
ence title, was unable to match the
Cardinal.
In doubles, Stanford's senior
duo of Lauren Kalvaria and Las
tra, ranked No. 1 nationally,
breezed past Gabriella Lundqvist
and Malta Gronowicz, 8-1. Sopho
more Lauren Barnikowand fresh
man Erin Burdette, ranked No.
17, shut out Roberta Fessenkoand
Italina Kirknis, 8-0, to win the dou
bles point for Stanford. Senior
Keiko Tokuda and freshman
Story Tweedie-Yates were up, 5-3,
on Petra Abraham and Amanda
Sanches when that match was
stopped due to Stanford having
captured the team point.
Singles proved equally easy for

Stanford, as the Cardinal did not
lose a set.
Sophomore Emilia Anderson
was the first to finish her match,
rolling past the soft-hitting Christi
na Rivieccio, 6-1, 6-1, in the sixth
flight. Tokuda followed up with a
fifth-flight shutout of Sane hes, 6-0,
6-0, and Gabriela Lastra, ranked
No. 6 nationally in singles,
clinched the match with her sec
ond-flight triumph over a frustrat
ed Gronowicz, 6-2,6-1.
The three matches that were
abandoned were looking favorable
for Stanford as well. No. 4 Kalvaria
was up 6-2, 3-0 on Lundqvist at
No. 1 singles, and No. 16
Barnikow had a 5-4 edge on Fes
senko in the second flight. No. 13
Burdette was one serve away from
clinching her match, which was
halted at 6-0, 5-1.
Stanford looked very sharp
against the Hornets, despite a two
week layoff prior to the match.
"We're all pretty much peaking
at the right time," Kalvaria said.
On Saturday, the Cardinal
faced Pepperdine for the second
time this year — its match in Mal
ibu on Feb. 2 resulted in a 5-2 Stan
ford victory. Pepperdine ended
the year with a losing record, but
one would not have guessed it
from their play on Saturday.
"We thought it was a pretty
tough regional," Lastra said.
"Since we had beaten [Pepper
dine] earlier this year with a differ
ent lineup, they were a little bit in
timidated at first, but they loos
ened up later on."
In doubles, Barnikowand Bur
dette won their No. 2 doubles
match handily over Monica Hor
vath and Aleksandra Kujawska, 8-
4. The sparkling net play of
Kalvaria and Lastra proved too
much for Charlotte Vernaz and
Veronica Koksova, as Stanford
clinched the doubles point with an
8-4 victory. Tokuda and Tweedie-
Yates fell behind, 3-0, against
Anna Andersson and Karin
Schlapbach, but battled back to
claim a 7-4 advantage when the
match was stopped.
The Waves made the Cardinal
work in singles and had the upper
hand in the two matches that were
abandoned after Stanford
clinched the victory.
Lastra, continuing her torrid
play of late, ran Horvath all over

ford victory. Pepperdine ended
the year with a losing record, but
one would not have guessed it
from their play on Saturday.

tough regional," Lastra said.

timidated at first, but they loos

match handily over Monica Hor

Kalvaria and Lastra proved too
much for Charlotte Vernaz and
Veronica Koksova, as Stanford
clinched the doubles point with an
8-4 victory. Tokuda and Tweedie-
Yates fell behind, 3-0, against
Anna Andersson and Karin
Schlapbach, but battled back to
claim a 7-4 advantage when the
match was stopped.
The Waves made the Cardinal
work in singles and had the upper
hand in the two matches that were
abandoned after Stanford
clinched the victory.
