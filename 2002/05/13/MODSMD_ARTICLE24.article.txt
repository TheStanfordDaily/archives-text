## 
### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
1988. It was (lie last time the
Stanford women's golf team
failed to make an appearance
in the NCAA Championship.
Fortunately for the Cardi
nal, it will stay that way.
After this weekend's NCAA
West Regional at the Stanford
Coif Course, Stanford's players
can breathe a sigh of relief that
the streak will not be broken.
Lhe No. 25 Cardinal finished
fifth in a field of 21 teams in
order to secure its 14th consec
utive berth into the champi
onship rounds, which will take
place May 21 to May 24 in
Auburn, Wash.
"I never doubted that we'd
make it, but it was a huge relief
that we got in," said sopho
more Angela Rho, who fin
ished in a tic for 25th with
rounds of 78-76-72 (+ 10).
Earning a championship
berth was no doubt a major ac
complishment fora Cardinal
team that had struggled at
times throughout the season. A
year after losing star veterans
Stephanie Keever and Hilary
Homeyer, the Cardinal was
forced to build a new identity.
Furthermore, Rho sat out
part of the season because of a
sore back, and many of the
players had been struck with
the stomach flu at the Pacific 10

two weeks ago.
Add the fact that Stanford,
which was the eighth seed
heading into an event that only
awarded eight passes to the
next round, also had to deal
with the pressure of playing on
its home course, and the feat
spoke volumes.
" There was definitely extra
weight on our shoulders this
week, and that was a big con
cern," Klio said.
The fifth-place finish was
only the Cardinal's third top
live finish of the season. It cer
tainly came at the right time.
Junior Kim Rowton was the
Cardinal's top finisher, as she
fired rounds of 76-75-73 (+ 8)
to tie for 19th place. Freshman
Wendra Liang (74-76-77, +11)
tied for 29th with junior Mar
cia VVallis (78-77-72, +11), and
sophomore Kim Kouwabunpat
(75-83-77, +19) rounded out
Stanford's scoring by tying for
55th place.
"The biggest thing was that
we all played well on the last
day â€” that was a relief," Rho
said. "It showed me that we can
still put up the [good] num
bers."
The team score of 294 in the
final round included VVallis'
season-low score of 72.
