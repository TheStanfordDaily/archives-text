# Baseball earns series victory
## 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess summed up
the past weekend series with Arizona State with live
words that say all there is to know about the No. 7 Car
dinal's situation with just seven games left: "We're still
in the hunt."
After surviving a bases-loaded threat in the top of
the ninth — with the final three at-bats being played
under a Stanford protest — Marquess and the Cardi
nal breathed a sigh of relief after a 3-1 rubber-game
victory. Stanford can now continue to hunt down No.
20 Southern California, which currently sits two
games ahead of second-place Stanford (35-14, 11-7
Pacific 10 Conference) in the Pac-10 standings.
"I was very pleased to get two wins when we didn't
really swing the bats well, and hopefully we'll get that
going," Marquess said. "When you can win and
you're not hitting, that's a good sign."
Junior Ryan McCally earned every bit of his sev
enth save of the season by entering a two-run ball
game with two men on and no outs in the ninth. He
fanned the first man he faced but didn't escape easily
or without controversy.
Sun Devil (28-18, 10-8) head coach Pat Murphyin
serted his pitcher, Bryce Kartler, to hit for catcher
Cesar Castillo in the batting order's No. 9 slot, despite
the fact that they had played the previous half-inning
in the field together.
After a five-minute delay for umpire deliberations
and explanations to the Cardinal bench, the umpir
ing crew decided the tricky lineup change was legal.
Marquess then agreed to allow Kartler, who had gone
0-for-3 in plate appearances this season, to hit for the
remainder of the game under protest.

After a walk to Kartler, the semi-legal pinch-hitting
pitcher, the junior closer induced a fielder's choice
force-out at home plate. McCally then retired the next
batter, who lined out to center.
It certainly brought the term "save" to a whole
new level.
"I don't think you can do that, and you shouldn't
be able to do it, but it doesn't make any difference now
that we won the game," Marquess said of the lineup
confusion. "I will find out, I guarantee you. But it
doesn't affect this game, thank God."
The Cardinal rode a stellar pitching performance
from junior Tim Cunningham, who was swapped
with sophomore John Hudgins in the rotation in
order to get Cunningham more mid-week work on
mechanics.
The extra time between starts helped immensely,
according to Cunningham.
"I was able to throw two bullpen [sessions] to make
some mechanical adjustments I needed to make,"
said Cunningham, who scattered seven hits in seven
innings."! wasn't totally consistent with them, but I'm
working at it."
Marquess agreed.
"He worked hard in Santa Clara prior to the game
[last week] fora long time, and he felt real good about
it. I think it did pay off for lis, obviously, in a huge
game," he said.
After a leadoff'triple by Fuld in the sixth and a
home run by senior Chris ()'Riordan gave the Cardi
nal a 2-0 advantage, the Sun Devils belted a solo home
run in their first at-bat after Cunningham's exit. But
Stanford added a run in the eighth after sophomore
right fielder Carlos Quentin took a pitch in the back
