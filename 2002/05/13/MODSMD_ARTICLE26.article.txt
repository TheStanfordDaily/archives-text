The day, which was dedicated
to honor the Cardinal seniors,
began appropriately with Bee
son, a two-time All-American,
belting a two-out monster home
run in the bottom of the first in
ning. The ball cleared both the
softball field fence, and the fence
of the adjacent field hockey field
as well.
Stanford did not stop this attack
for the remainder of the game.
The Cardinal scored three addi
tional runs in the bottom of the sec
ond. Sophomore catcher Jessica
Allister kicked off the rally with a
leadoff double. She then advanced
to third when both freshman third
baseman Leah Nelson and
Draemel drew walks.
Then, with the bases loaded,
Walker sent a sacrifice fly to right
to bring home freshman pinch
runner Heather Shook. Mendo/a
followed by sending a long fly ball

to It'll field that was mishandled by
Oregon, allowing Nelson and
Draemel to score on the error to
give the C Cardinal a 4-0 lead.
The Ducks cut the lead to4-l on
a solo home run by Andrea Vid
land in the top of the fourth.
The home run did not faze the
Cardinal, though, as it stormed
back with six runs in the filth inning
to earn the mercy-rule victory.
Beeson led off with a single up
the middle and then moved to sec
ond base when Ching reached on
an infield error. After Brangham
walked to load the bases, Oregon
centerlielder Amber Hutchison
failed to make a play on a fly ball by
Allister, which allowed Beeson and
Ching to score.
Sporting a 0-1 lead, the Car
dinal added to its total when
freshman designated player
Meghan Sickler plated Brang
ham with a fielder's choice for
the seventh run.
The Cardinal was just three
runs short of a mercy-rule victory
when Walker stepped up to the
plate and finished off the game
with a three-run home run to take

a 10-1 victory.
In game two, the Cardinal
failed to come out as strong, as
Oregon hurler Connie McMurren
held the Cardinal offense in check.
McMurren allowed just four hits
over seven innings.
The Ducks broke through with
a run in the top of the second, as
Lakeesha Everseley came around
to score on Rachel Tommasini's
sacrifice fly fora 1-0 lead.
Oregon tallied an additional
run in the fifth inning when
Everseley's RBI single plated
Lindsay Haij to increase the
Ducks' advantage to 2-0.
In the seventh, Oregon regis
tered two more runs on Mari Lyn
Petrick's two-run double to center
to round out the scoring.
Despite the loss, the weekend
finished off on a high note, as the
four Cardinal seniors — Draemel,
Walker, Beeson and Mendoza —
were honored, and all those in the
crowd were reminded of the con
tributions of one of the greatest
softball classes to have passed
through the Stanford softball pro
gram to date.
