her part once again, as she labored
insicle the circle during the final
four innings, yet still allowed just
live hits in a complete-game victory.
Oregon State pitcher Crystal
Draper performed valiantly as
well, but the Cardinal bats proved
to be too much for the Beavers as
the Cardinal finished on top, 2-1.
For the first three innings, both
squads struggled at the plate, as ju
nior leftfielder Cassi Brangham
recorded the only hit.
Then, in the bottom of the

through in the clutch, sending a
shot to center field for an RBI dou
ble, which drove senior first base
man Sarah Beeson home for the
first run of the game.

right away in the top of the fifth
inning.

walked and then moved to second
base on a single by Alana Mendo/a,
the sister of Stanford senior cen
terfielder Jessica Mendo/a. King

and Mendo/a both advanced on a
passed ball before Kelly Petersen
drew a walk to load the bases. I he
Beavers' Clare Burnum followed
with a sacrifice fly to bring home
King and tie the score at one.

long to answer back, as il respond
ed in the home half of the fifth by
tacking on another run.
With two outs and nobody on
base, senior right fielder |essica
Draemel reached first on an in

field error.
