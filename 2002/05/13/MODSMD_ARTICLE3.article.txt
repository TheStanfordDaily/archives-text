other evenly, the game entered
the half at 4-2.

after a UCLA shot hit the crossbar,
freshman Kelty Luber scored to in
crease the Stanford lead to three.
Even though the Bruins scored
four goals in the fourth quarter,
Stanford kept the lead with three
goals of its own.
Estes and Gardner led the way
with two goals. Also scoring for
Stanford were sophomores Bren
