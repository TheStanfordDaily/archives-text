## 
### CYNTHIA CHO EDITORIAL STAFF 
Today at noon, three-time
Pulitzer Prize-winning author and
New York limes foreign affairs
columnist Thomas Friedman will
speak at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
His lecture, which is co-sponsored
by the ASSU Speakers Bureau and
Hillel, will focus on the current situ
ation in the Middle East.
"He has a unique perspective on
the current diplomatic crisis in the
Middle East that he will present
during his talk," said sophomore
Vinita Kailasanath, publicity officer
of the Speakers Bureau.
"The audience members will
have a chance to learn about the
current tension in the Middle East
as well as some of the foreign policy
options that the United States has,"

Kailasanath said.
A question-and-answer session
will follow Friedman's lecture.
"1 think that students will walk
away having learned more about
the current conflicts still ongoing in
our world," said junior Bill Falsey,
director of the Speakers Bureau.
The Speakers Bureau had dis
cussed bringing Friedman to cam
pus since the beginning of the year.
However, due to his busy schedule
since Sept. 11, the group's mem
bers thought it was not feasible, ac
cording to Falsey.
Independent of the Speakers
Bureau, Rabbi Noa Kushnerof I lil
lel had learned that Friedman
would be in the Bay Area today for
a speaking engagement and a book
signing. Kushner contacted his
agent to have him come to Stanford
while he was in the area, Falsey said.

"Noa was very helpful in dealing
with contacts and Friedman's
agent, while the Speakers Bureau
has shouldered the majority of the
costs for the event, as well as coor
dinated ushers and publicity and
the other sundry tasks associated
with speaking engagements,"
Falsey said.
While all of the tickets have been
given out, Kailasanath said that a
limited number of seats would be
available at the will-call window.
She recommended arriving early to
get tickets.
