The University is implementing several changes in
graduate student housing for the 2002-03 academic
year, which include opening more studio apartments,
converting some double rooms to singles and includ
ing several off-campus apartment complexes in theon
campus lottery.
Graduate students seem pleased with the changes,
but some still leel die University should do more to ac -
commodate their housing needs.
"Housing has been the major problem for graduate
students at Stanford since 1997," said Stijn Van
Nieuwerburgh, a doctoral candidate in economics and
a former member of the Graduate Student Council.
According to Van Nieuwerburgh, students are dis
pleased with the housing lottery system.
"The uncertainty of not getting Stanford housing,
and the costs and hassles of moving make the housing
lottery into a painful annual event,"he said. Van
Nieuwerburgh said that the average graduate student
has to move every other year, which he believes hin

ders their ability to complete their degrees.
Todd Benson, director of Housing Assignment Ser
vices, said that continuing graduate students have typ
ically had about a 50 percent chance of being reas
signed to on-campus housing in the lottery each year.
"The other 50 percent need to move off-campus, ei
ther to a space in Stanford's off-campus subsidized
housing program or to a place on their own," Benson
said.
Former Graduate Student Council Chair Filipe
Santos, a doctoral candidate in management science
and engineering, said that the system in which 1,200
students lose their housing and half the students have
to move is "bad for everyone â€” for students because it
does not provide stability and creates anxiety, and for
the administration because it increases the costs of
managing (he housing system."
"Students are pleased that the University adminis
tration has renewed its commitment to the off-cam
pus subsidized housing program," Santos said. But
