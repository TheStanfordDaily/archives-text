# Grad housing lottery changes
## 
### RACHEL HILLMAN 
The University is implementing several changes in
graduate student housing for the 2002-03 academic
year, which include opening more studio apartments,
converting some double rooms to singles and includ
ing several off-campus apartment complexes in theon
campus lottery.
Graduate students seem pleased with the changes,
but some still leel die University should do more to ac -
commodate their housing needs.
"Housing has been the major problem for graduate
students at Stanford since 1997," said Stijn Van
Nieuwerburgh, a doctoral candidate in economics and
a former member of the Graduate Student Council.
According to Van Nieuwerburgh, students are dis
pleased with the housing lottery system.
"The uncertainty of not getting Stanford housing,
and the costs and hassles of moving make the housing
lottery into a painful annual event,"he said. Van
Nieuwerburgh said that the average graduate student
has to move every other year, which he believes hin

ders their ability to complete their degrees.
Todd Benson, director of Housing Assignment Ser
vices, said that continuing graduate students have typ
ically had about a 50 percent chance of being reas
signed to on-campus housing in the lottery each year.
"The other 50 percent need to move off-campus, ei
ther to a space in Stanford's off-campus subsidized
housing program or to a place on their own," Benson
said.
Former Graduate Student Council Chair Filipe
Santos, a doctoral candidate in management science
and engineering, said that the system in which 1,200
students lose their housing and half the students have
to move is "bad for everyone â€” for students because it
does not provide stability and creates anxiety, and for
the administration because it increases the costs of
managing (he housing system."
"Students are pleased that the University adminis
tration has renewed its commitment to the off-cam
pus subsidized housing program," Santos said. But
Elizabeth Marin, a doctoral candi
date in Biological Sciences and co
chair of the Graduate Housing Ad
visory Committee, said that stu
dents in the off-campus subsidized
housing program have been dis
satisfied because many of the com
plexes are far away from campus
and provide little opportunity for
social interaction.
Last year, the University imple
mented a housing stipend pro
gram for students not living on
campus or living in the off-campus
subsidized housing complexes.
Students who earned less than
$29,000 a year could apply to get

either a $250 or a $100 monthly
stipend to be applied to their rent.
According to Marin, the program
was very popular because it helped
students "bridge the gap between
their income and their rent."
The University is not offering
new stipends for the 2002-03
school year. However, those stu
dents who received a stipend last
year may continue to receive it,
but at a reduced rate.
Instead, the University will try to
solve t he housing problem by build
ing more housing and expanding
the off-campus subsidized housing
program.
"Our focus was to provide those
options as the main way to provide
housing support," Benson said.
"Last year we opened four new stu
dio apartment buildings with a total

ofsoB bed spaces, and next year we
will open up two more buildings
with 324 additional bed spaces.
This is a total of 832 bed spaces in
three years."
In addition, by giving new grad
uate students priority at four near
campus complexes that have just
been brought into the on-campus
lottery, the University hopes to in
crease the number of spaces avail
able for continuing graduate stu
dents on campus.
"Our ultimate goal over the next
few years is to see if it will be possible
to combine the off-campus and on
campus application process [which
are currently run separately] into a
single system," Benson said. "We
believe that this will further reduce
the number of moves which gradu
ate students will need to make dur

ing their time at Stanford."
The Graduate Student Coun
cil's survey predicted a 4 percent
increase this year in housing de
mand. But Benson said that, due
to economic downturn, off-cam
pus rents are lower this year;
therefore, he says the number of
students who applied for housing
this year has decreased. As a re
sult, Benson said, "We think there
is a good chance that we will be
able to offer either on-campus
housing or space in the ofF-cam
pus subsidized program to any
student who applies."
A Graduate Student Council
survey estimated that "total de
mand for housing support will be
6,482 students, representing ap
proximately 86 percent of the grad
uate student population."

Benson estimated that next year
the University will be able to pro
vide housing support via a stipend
or on-campus housing for over 73
percent of the graduate population.
If these numbers are accurate, this
means that IS percent of the grad
uate student population, or ap
proximately 980 students, could
seek but not receive support.
But Benson said that the
amount of graduate housing sup
port that Stanford provides goes
far beyond that offered by other
universities.
"Most of Stanford's major com
petitors house in the range of 0
percent to 20 percent of their
graduate students. What Stanford
is doing is unequaled by any other
university in the country as far as
I am aware."
