# Administrators explain process behind alcohol-probation decisions
## 
### MATT BRICKER 
Two Fridays ago marked the return of
Kappa Sigma to the Stanford party scene
with its "Back in the Saddle" celebration.
For the past few quarters, the fraternity
has been on alcohol probation because of
its conduct last spring and fire code viola
tions during its parties. For most stu
dents, this concept is somewhat of a mys
tery — a vague punishment inflicted on
Greek organizations.

However, the official process behind
the University's approach to the Greek
system and alcohol is quite involved.
"The whole process begins when
charges are leveled against a Greek orga
nization, housed or not," said Assoc.
Dean of Students Morris Graves. " These
charges can be brought through [Resi
dential Education], the police depart
ment and even other students."
Progress from this point depends on
whether the Greek organization in ques

tion is a fraternity or a sorority. Director
of Student Activities Nanci Howe serves
as (lie sorority advisor. The fraternity ad
visor is Joey Greenwell, assistant director
of student activities.
"[Howe] and [Greenwell] always
have to stay in a position to advise their
respective groups," Graves said.
" Therefore, if a fraternity is being in
vestigated, [Howe] will take over and if
a sorority is in question then [Green
well] handles it. Trying to balance in

vestigating and advising the same orga
nization doesn't work."
Howe or Greenwell compiles a report
and submits it to Graves who in turn for
wards it to the Greek Judicial Board.
"But before I send the report to (he
board, I inform the organization in
question that they are being investigat
ed and give them a chance to respond (o
the charges," Graves said. "We call (his
a 'self-study' and it is forwarded along
with [Howe or Greenwell's] report (o

the board."
At this point, the board, which is com
posed of students, determines what facts
are already known in addition to what in
formation needs to be obtained and who
to obtain it from. It then sets up a series of
interviews.
"Usually the interviews are staggered
and take place over a week or so,"
Graves said.
Based on this preliminary in
vestigation and the report from
Graves, the board decides
whether a full-scale hearing
should occur. Hit determines that
there is enough information to
hold a hearing, it sets a date and
informs Graves. He then lets the
Greek organization and the other
involved parties know.
"I'm always the voice of the
board," Graves said. "I act as the
dean's liaison in the Greek realm."
After the hearing, the board de
liberates the organization's guilt.
"From here, we act much like
an appellate court," Graves ex
plained. "One panelist [from the
Judicial Board] is assigned the
task of writing up the board's de
cision. It is then reviewed by all
members and a final draft is com
piled and approved. This is sent
to me and I pass it on to the Dean
of Students Marc VVais."
Graves also explained that
his job at this juncture is to ex
plain precedents from similar
cases to the board to help it es
tablish a decision consistent
with previous ones.
Wais then reads over the deci
sion and writes a letter expressing
his opinion.
"He can do a number of
things," Graves said. "He can fully
support the decision, he can sup
port the decision but add further

sanctions, or he can reject the de
cision entirely."
In the last four years, no Greek
Judicial Board decision has been
rejected and there are only two
cases in which Wais has said he
did not think the board had gone
far enough with its sanctions and
stiffened them.
"[Wais] ultimately has the final
say," Graves said. "The board is
just an advisory board. Although
when [Wais] disagrees with its de
cision, he makes an effort to ex
plain and justify his point of view."
Simple and less serious cases
can be completed in a week,
while more involved ones may
take months.
"The whole process takes a lot
of time," Graves said. "There are
about six to 10 cases a year that go
to a hearing. Because of this num
ber we had two panels for the first
time this year."
The process for alcohol-related
violations within Greek organiza
tions has historically been quite
different than those within other
student groups.
"The process is different,"
Graves said. "Greeks are the
only organizations, on any col
lege campus, that have such se
lective membership-. Because of
this we hold them to a higher
standard. A standard that we call
'collective responsibility."'
Graves went on to explain that
this means the administration
considers three or more members
of any Greek organization to
stand for it as a whole. Further

more, the officers also represent
their organization entirely.
"There is no J-Board review
with student groups that aren't
Greek," Graves said. "A represen
tative fiom the group is called in
and then an administrative deci
sion is made as to whether or not a
sanction is imposed. Although next
year this will change. The Greek J-
Board will become the [Voluntary
Student Organization]/Greek J-
Board and every student group
will undergo the same process."
Student reactions to the effica
cy of alcohol probation vary.
"I think probation forced us to
become more creative in order to
socialize and to meet people
throughout the year," said
sophomore Kappa Sig member
Victor Burga. "People thought
we would suffer in our Rush
numbers because of it, but we def
initely made up for probation
with hard work from everyone in
the house."
This echoes what the adminis
trators hope sanctions will
achieve.
"We want to teach groups that
they can center activities on
things other than alcohol,"
Graves explained.
Other students disagree.
"I don't think probation has
any value as a deterrent," said
sophomore Alexander Kendall.
"This is fora number of reasons.
First, as a matter of deterrence
theory, fora punishment to be ef
fective three conditions must hold.
I ligh awareness of the threat, high

probability of punishment, and
high punishment value. Of these
three, it seems like only the last
holds for alcohol probation.
Kendall went on to say that he
and his friends see probation as
causing the very problem that the
University's alcohol program at
tempts to diff use.
"I don't think that the punish
ment accomplishes the desired
ends," Kendall said. "Namely, to
prevent irresponsible drinking.
The probation just pushes ch ink
ing into the closet."
In response to student con
cerns, Graves insisted that the
administration and the Judicial
Board have the best intentions.
"I think the most important
part of the sanctions that gets
overlooked by the general stu
dent body is that the board al
ways starts from the premise
that sanctions must be educa
tional in nature," Graves said.
"This is the motivation behind
requiring community service or
the attendance of leadership
workshops. Of course, that is
not to say that there aren't puni
tive sanctions."
Despite the efforts of the
Greek Judicial Board, some stu
dents remain opposed to the en
tire process.
"1 know my Stanford experi
ence will probably be just a tad bit
lower without a wild, crazy and
drunken place to go if 1 want,"
said an anonymous senior. "You
can ask anyone in Kappa Sig, the
foam party sucked."

ed and give them a chance to respond (o
the charges," Graves said. "We call (his
a 'self-study' and it is forwarded along
with [Howe or Greenwell's] report (o

the board."
At this point, the board, which is com
posed of students, determines what facts
are already known in addition to what in
formation needs to be obtained and who
to obtain it from. It then sets up a series of
interviews.
"Usually the interviews are staggered
and take place over a week or so,"
Graves said.
Based on this preliminary in
vestigation and the report from
Graves, the board decides
whether a full-scale hearing
should occur. Hit determines that
there is enough information to
hold a hearing, it sets a date and
informs Graves. He then lets the
Greek organization and the other
involved parties know.
"I'm always the voice of the
board," Graves said. "I act as the
dean's liaison in the Greek realm."
After the hearing, the board de
liberates the organization's guilt.
"From here, we act much like
an appellate court," Graves ex
plained. "One panelist [from the
Judicial Board] is assigned the
task of writing up the board's de
cision. It is then reviewed by all
members and a final draft is com
piled and approved. This is sent
to me and I pass it on to the Dean
of Students Marc VVais."
Graves also explained that
his job at this juncture is to ex
plain precedents from similar
cases to the board to help it es
tablish a decision consistent
with previous ones.
Wais then reads over the deci
sion and writes a letter expressing
his opinion.
"He can do a number of
things," Graves said. "He can fully
support the decision, he can sup
port the decision but add further

sanctions, or he can reject the de
cision entirely."
In the last four years, no Greek
Judicial Board decision has been
rejected and there are only two
cases in which Wais has said he
did not think the board had gone
far enough with its sanctions and
stiffened them.
"[Wais] ultimately has the final
say," Graves said. "The board is
just an advisory board. Although
when [Wais] disagrees with its de
cision, he makes an effort to ex
plain and justify his point of view."
Simple and less serious cases
can be completed in a week,
while more involved ones may
take months.
"The whole process takes a lot
of time," Graves said. "There are
about six to 10 cases a year that go
to a hearing. Because of this num
ber we had two panels for the first
time this year."
The process for alcohol-related
violations within Greek organiza
tions has historically been quite
different than those within other
student groups.
"The process is different,"
Graves said. "Greeks are the
only organizations, on any col
lege campus, that have such se
lective membership-. Because of
this we hold them to a higher
standard. A standard that we call
'collective responsibility."'
Graves went on to explain that
this means the administration
considers three or more members
of any Greek organization to
stand for it as a whole. Further

more, the officers also represent
their organization entirely.
"There is no J-Board review
with student groups that aren't
Greek," Graves said. "A represen
tative fiom the group is called in
and then an administrative deci
sion is made as to whether or not a
sanction is imposed. Although next
year this will change. The Greek J-
Board will become the [Voluntary
Student Organization]/Greek J-
Board and every student group
will undergo the same process."
Student reactions to the effica
cy of alcohol probation vary.
"I think probation forced us to
become more creative in order to
socialize and to meet people
throughout the year," said
sophomore Kappa Sig member
Victor Burga. "People thought
we would suffer in our Rush
numbers because of it, but we def
initely made up for probation
with hard work from everyone in
the house."
This echoes what the adminis
trators hope sanctions will
achieve.
"We want to teach groups that
they can center activities on
things other than alcohol,"
Graves explained.
Other students disagree.
"I don't think probation has
any value as a deterrent," said
sophomore Alexander Kendall.
"This is fora number of reasons.
First, as a matter of deterrence
theory, fora punishment to be ef
fective three conditions must hold.
I ligh awareness of the threat, high

probability of punishment, and
high punishment value. Of these
three, it seems like only the last
holds for alcohol probation.
Kendall went on to say that he
and his friends see probation as
causing the very problem that the
University's alcohol program at
tempts to diff use.
"I don't think that the punish
ment accomplishes the desired
ends," Kendall said. "Namely, to
prevent irresponsible drinking.
The probation just pushes ch ink
ing into the closet."
In response to student con
cerns, Graves insisted that the
administration and the Judicial
Board have the best intentions.
"I think the most important
part of the sanctions that gets
overlooked by the general stu
dent body is that the board al
ways starts from the premise
that sanctions must be educa
tional in nature," Graves said.
"This is the motivation behind
requiring community service or
the attendance of leadership
workshops. Of course, that is
not to say that there aren't puni
tive sanctions."
Despite the efforts of the
Greek Judicial Board, some stu
dents remain opposed to the en
tire process.
"1 know my Stanford experi
ence will probably be just a tad bit
lower without a wild, crazy and
drunken place to go if 1 want,"
said an anonymous senior. "You
can ask anyone in Kappa Sig, the
foam party sucked."
Two Fridays ago marked the return of
Kappa Sigma to the Stanford party scene
with its "Back in the Saddle" celebration.
For the past few quarters, the fraternity
has been on alcohol probation because of
its conduct last spring and fire code viola
tions during its parties. For most stu
dents, this concept is somewhat of a mys
tery — a vague punishment inflicted on
Greek organizations.

However, the official process behind
the University's approach to the Greek
system and alcohol is quite involved.
"The whole process begins when
charges are leveled against a Greek orga
nization, housed or not," said Assoc.
Dean of Students Morris Graves. " These
charges can be brought through [Resi
dential Education], the police depart
ment and even other students."
Progress from this point depends on
whether the Greek organization in ques

tion is a fraternity or a sorority. Director
of Student Activities Nanci Howe serves
as (lie sorority advisor. The fraternity ad
visor is Joey Greenwell, assistant director
of student activities.
"[Howe] and [Greenwell] always
have to stay in a position to advise their
respective groups," Graves said.
" Therefore, if a fraternity is being in
vestigated, [Howe] will take over and if
a sorority is in question then [Green
well] handles it. Trying to balance in

vestigating and advising the same orga
nization doesn't work."
Howe or Greenwell compiles a report
and submits it to Graves who in turn for
wards it to the Greek Judicial Board.
"But before I send the report to (he
board, I inform the organization in
question that they are being investigat
ed and give them a chance to respond (o
the charges," Graves said. "We call (his
a 'self-study' and it is forwarded along
with [Howe or Greenwell's] report (o

the board."
