# Administrators explain process behind alcohol-probation decisions
## 
### MATT BRICKER 
Two Fridays ago marked the return of
Kappa Sigma to the Stanford party scene
with its "Back in the Saddle" celebration.
For the past few quarters, the fraternity
has been on alcohol probation because of
its conduct last spring and fire code viola
tions during its parties. For most stu
dents, this concept is somewhat of a mys
tery â€” a vague punishment inflicted on
Greek organizations.

However, the official process behind
the University's approach to the Greek
system and alcohol is quite involved.
"The whole process begins when
charges are leveled against a Greek orga
nization, housed or not," said Assoc.
Dean of Students Morris Graves. " These
charges can be brought through [Resi
dential Education], the police depart
ment and even other students."
Progress from this point depends on
whether the Greek organization in ques

tion is a fraternity or a sorority. Director
of Student Activities Nanci Howe serves
as (lie sorority advisor. The fraternity ad
visor is Joey Greenwell, assistant director
of student activities.
"[Howe] and [Greenwell] always
have to stay in a position to advise their
respective groups," Graves said.
" Therefore, if a fraternity is being in
vestigated, [Howe] will take over and if
a sorority is in question then [Green
well] handles it. Trying to balance in

vestigating and advising the same orga
nization doesn't work."
Howe or Greenwell compiles a report
and submits it to Graves who in turn for
wards it to the Greek Judicial Board.
"But before I send the report to (he
board, I inform the organization in
question that they are being investigat
ed and give them a chance to respond (o
the charges," Graves said. "We call (his
a 'self-study' and it is forwarded along
with [Howe or Greenwell's] report (o

the board."
At this point, the board, which is com
posed of students, determines what facts
are already known in addition to what in
formation needs to be obtained and who
to obtain it from. It then sets up a series of
interviews.
"Usually the interviews are staggered
and take place over a week or so,"
Graves said.
