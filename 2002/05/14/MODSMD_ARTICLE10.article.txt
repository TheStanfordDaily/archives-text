# SHOOTING FROM THE HIP
## Cutting the defense fat 
### 
There's a popular bumper sticker
whose slogan goes like this: "It
will be a great day when our
schools get all the money they
need and the Air Force has to hold a bake
sale to buy a new bomber." It's a cute senti
ment, although not particularly realistic.
I, for one, don't begrudge the Depart
ment of Defense its gargantuan annual
budget. It takes a lot of money to outfit
top-notch armed forces, and there are
enough people out there who hate us that
we desperately need the best armed
forces money can buy.
However, I do have a problem with
Congress' continued funding of two truly
obnoxious categories of military hardware.

These categories are:
Weapons We Don't Want
and Weapons That Don't
Work.
An example of the first
category is the Crusader
artillery system. Last week
the House of Representa
tives authorized almost
.$5OO million to further

develop this prototype. The Crusader is a
mobile howitzer, capable of firing 10 ar
tillery shells per minute at a range up to 30
miles. It's a wonderful piece of machinery if
you like big things that go "bang."
The only problem is, Secretary of De
fense Donald Rumsfeld has stated very
clearly that he doesn't want the Crusader.
Hie reasons are pretty simple. At 40 tons,
the Crusader is too big to be transported by
most Air Force cargo planes, so it can't be
quickly deployed. Its vaunted mobility is
also useless if the battle happens to be in
mountainous terrain (for example,
Afghanistan). And finally, advances in pre
cision-guided bombs and Cruise missiles
have made artillery unnecessary in most sit
uations.
But these petty details weren't about to
stop our brave Representatives. They were
determined to give the Department of De
fense a hugely expensive artillery system,
whether the department liked it or not.
After all, what do our military leaders know
about lighting a war?
It's hardly a coincidence that the Cru
sader is being developed in ()klahoma, and
some of its biggest supporters are Repre
sentatives from that state. Two weeks ago
Rep. J. C. Watts (R-C)K) practically brow
beat the I louse Armed Services (lommittee
into recommending continued funding,
and somehow I don't think Watts has a
bold new vision for U.S. military strategy.
More likely, he has a bold new vision for
bringing pork back to his district.
Still, as strategically useless as the Cm

sader might be, at least the damn thing
works. Some of our other military projects
can't say the same.
Take the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey.
Please, take it; it hasn't done the Marines
any good. The Osprey is basically a bizarre
cross between a plane and a helicopter â€”
it has oversized airplane propellers that
can be rotated 90 degrees, so that the Os
prey can hover like a helicopter. Quite
frankly, it looks like a contraption that
Wile E. Coyote would invent to track
down the Roadrunner.
And it's about I hat effective, too. Since its
invention over a decade ago, the Osprey
has become best known for repeatedly
crashing. Its ineptitude is so famous that it's
become a part of pop culture. In fact, one of
the magazine ads for our very own Stan
lord Flying Club has a picture of the Os
prey with the tag line "Some things aren't
meant to My."
The numbers bear out this ironic
phrase. Since 1991 (here have been 4
separate Osprey crashes, killing 30
Marines. As a Marine, you'd be safer pa
trolling a war-torn section of Kosovo
than performing drills stateside in an Os
prey. And yet the Marine brass keeps in
sisting that il needs the Osprey, and
Congress dutifully keeps on funding it.
Apparently, military planners are paid
attention to when they advocate keeping
a program, and only are ignored when
they advocate cutting one.
Between hidebound military officers
and greedy Congressmen, it's no wonder
that our military budget is bloated by
trash like the Crusader and Osprey. Nine
times out of 10, our military commanders
will reflexively claim that even the most
unsuccessful and dangerous program
must be maintained. And in the rare cases
where they admit that certain programs
should get the axe, Mr. Local Congress
man steps in and declares that he's not
about to see his district deprived of plum
defense contracts. Meanwhile, John Q.
Taxpayer is saddled with the burden of
paying for planes that don't fly and ar
tillery that's hopelessly obsolete.
So the bumper sticker really has it half
right. The Air Force deserves its bombers,
and it shouldn't have to hold a bake sale to
drum up the necessary funds. But it would
be a great day indeed if we could give our
schools, or hospitals, or libraries the billions
of defense dollars that are wasted each year
on useless boondoggles. There's plenty of
money for both books and bombers, if we
could just learn to spend it wisely.
