# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## INS changes impact foreign students 
### JOHN PEARSON GUEST COLUMNIST 
After the 1993 World Trade Center
bombing, foreign students have been pe
riodically viewed with suspicion with
consequent regulatory changes aimed at
better tracking these students.
This attack was the genesis for the
Immigration and Naturalization Ser
vice's development of a tracking system.
This tracking system became law in the
1990 Immigration Act. It was events of
last September that brought this track
ing system forward as an issue.
From 1990 to Sept. 11, 2001 this track
ing system was another federal proposal
that was moving slowly towards some
form of national implementation, with
genuine concerns about aspects of the sys
tem being expressed and the INS adapt
ing and improving it.
Sept. 11 made any delay non-nego
tiable. The fact that at least one of the
suspects was in the United States on a
student visa, or may have attended
courses at various institutions, while on
other visas, removed any ability to sug
gest that there was room for negotiation.
It exposed the fact that millions arrived
in the United States on other visas and
that, no matter what tracking system,
there was an urgent need to better fund
the INS and have it work more efficient
ly, especially in the area of technology.
So where are we now? We can proba
bly assert the following. First there re
mains in Congress a genuine sentiment
that values the continuing contributions
of foreign students. But this sentiment
now takes a back seat to issues of nation

al security.
Second, there will be a tracking sys
tem, probably implemented at Stanford
within the next 18 months.
Our hope is that this will be a method
of supplying the INS data which we are
already are required by law to keep and
report on request (regardless of the fact
that no such request has been made since
1988), with some additional information
such as reporting students (and visiting
scholars) who do not arrive on campus
within a certain time after the beginning
of the quarter.
Our goal is to ensure that this system
does not interfere with the academic
goals of the students or interfere with the
advising relationship that offices at Stan
ford such as Bechtel International Cen
ter have developed.
Third, recent changes in immigration
policy have affected the ability of family
members of students to come to the U.S.
for extended stays.
Fourth, we cannot avoid the conclu
sion that some countries are viewed with
more suspicion than others. Students
from countries such as Iran are likely to
have to undergo much more detailed
background checks before, being issued
visas. Bechtel is here to assist in instances
where visa issuance is in doubt.
Fifth, we are also going to be dealing
with "sensitive subjects" and whether stu
dents from certain countries should be al
lowed to study them. Again this is not new
— we witnessed it with Libyan students in
the early 1980s, and a presidential direc
tive during Bill Clinton's presidency en
couraged more background checks when
students were studying in certain areas or

were from certain countries.
Present proposals being discussed by
the White House Office of Technology
make us concerned that we may be en
tering a more strict interpretation of sen
sitive subjects. For universities con
vinced of the need for knowledge to
know no boundaries this poses a very
real challenge.
Sixth, and finally, we are likely to
enter an era when the penalties, to indi
viduals and institutions, for non-compli
ance will be more severe.
The above present very real, and im
mediate, challenges to the belief that the
exchange of ideas between students and
scholars from different countries and
cultures is as important as any meeting at
the summit.
None of these changes — proposed
or actual — are being implemented
without scrutiny by many institutions of
higher education.
But political realities are different
now than before Sept. 11. What we have
to assure is three things: that goals of na
tional security can be met, that institu
tions such as Stanford can continue to
enroll foreign students with minimum
affect on their education goals, and that
students from overseas continue to feel
that they are welcomed at Stanford and
in the United States.
The attainment of these three goals
can be mutually exclusive and it will
need the voice of papers such as The
Daily to continue its support for our for
eign students.
