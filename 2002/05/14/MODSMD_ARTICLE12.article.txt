Minority argument of Hindu
Students Council is flawed
This letter is in response to the Hindu
Students Council, Neerad Lai's and
Maulik Zaveri's letters published recent
ly in I'he Daily which suggest that it is in
appropriate to condemn right-wing
Hindu violence in India because they
form a minority in the United States and
in other nations.
Firstly the characterization of Hindus
as a minority suffers from the flaw that in
most countries, Indian Hindus (like
other Asian immigrants) are a part of the
affluent middle and upper middle class.
As an example, in 1997, according to
Fortune magazine three out of the top
10 venture capital investors in Silicon
Valley were Indian Hindus. The same is
true of Britain, where all the steel ty
coons are Indians (Hindu or Muslim).

Indian Hindus thus don't fit minority
label, unlike blacks and latinos in Cali
fornia, who are overrepresented in the
lower class and are frequently targeted
by racist groups.
Secondly, the letters give no good ex
amples of persecution of Hindus in
Western countries. Most cases that could
qualify for such, for example the riots in
Northern England involving South
Asian youth last year, also included
Bangladeshi and Pakistani immigrants
who were Muslim.
It seems that the letter of the Hindu
Students Council and the other two let
ters printed in The Daily seem to mis
construe the few cases of racist discrimi
nation against people of South Asian ori
gin (some of which are Hindu) as 'Perse
cution of Hindus'.
