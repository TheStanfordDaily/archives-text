## The
						problem of mobility in American education 
### ERIC A. HANUSHEK HOOVER INSTITUTION 
America is a mobile society. In fact that
has been one of its strengths; the Ameri
can labor market adjusts more quickly
than virtually any other labor market in
the world. But mobility has its costs. Fam
ily moves, whether for new job opportu
nities, improved housing, or adjustment
to divorce, lead to frequent changes of
schools, l hese school changes take their
toll on some children.
Moreover, the negative effects of mov
ing are not only experienced by the chil
dren who move; all students in high-mo
bility schools, including non-movers,
tend to be affected. Teachers must con
tinually adjust to movements in and out
of their classrooms, and these adjust
ments detract from learning.
Also, the impact of high mobility is not
evenly dispersed across the population,
instead falling more heavily on disadvan
taged children. Disadvantaged children
— who are likely to come to school less
well prepared than advantaged children
— also move more frequently. These
moves are unlikely to lead to any im
provements in their schools.
Higher-income parents can exercise
more choice to take schools into account
when they move because of their ability
to choose from a wider variety of hous
ing opportunities. But restricted hous
ing choices plus the concentration of
high-mobility families leave lower-in
come children worse off.
Improving the education of disadvan
taged children has been and should be an
important policy goal. But the issue of
school mobility highlights some of the facets
that make policy development difficult.

First, public schools should do more to
take mobility into account. I he highest
mobility rates occur in large central cities,
where poor children are likely to go to
school. But, while decrying the problems
of high mobility, many large systems
have not aligned curricula and programs
across schools to lessen the disruption of
moving.
Second, many people argue that im
proving schooling for poor kids requires
more fundamental change, such as school
choice, on the grounds that individual
schools can develop innovative programs
and that these programs can be one of the
gains of more parental options.
The two policy options are not neces
sarily in conflict. Improved school choice
mechanisms — ones that separate school
attendance from the specifics of residen
tial location — might stabilize schooling
for some low-income children.
If parents could maintain the same
schools for their children even if forced
by other circumstances to move, the
achievement level of low-income stu
dents— both moving and nonmoving
— might improve.
It is difficult to determine, howev
er, whether this effect is sufficient to
overcome forces that tend to increase
the costs of family moves. As is often
(he case, developing the best policy
outcomes involves trade-offs and
experience.
