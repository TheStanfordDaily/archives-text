## Cardinal upset in second round 
### JERRY LU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the Stanford men's tenuis team,
the end arrived a little sooner than ex
pected this year.
No. 6 Stanford was narrowly upset, 4-
3, by No. 35 Washington on Sunday in the
second round of the NCAA Tournament.

Round
Sunday: No. 35 Washington de
feated No. 6 Stanford, 4-3, NCAA
Second Round

The loss, played iti front of a large
crowd at the Taube Family Tennis Stadi
um, ended the team's season at 20-6 and
finished what could only be called a very
interesting year.
"We knew it was going to be a tough
match," said head coach Dick Gould.
"Only five or six teams are better than
them in the round of 16. In the Pacific 10
Conference Individual Tournament,
Washington had two players in the semis
and one guy in the finals."
Stanford was a preseason favorite for
the NCAA crown, especially after win
ning the National Team Indoor Champi
onships in February. The Cardinal was a
different team then, in composition if not
also in heart.
Three-time Ail-American senior K.J.
Hippensteel was still playing tfien, and all
the other players were healthy and near
the top of their games.
With junior Carter Morris already out
for the season with mononucleosis, Hip
pensteel's back injury on April 13
couldn't have come at a worse time.

Freshman Sam Warburg and junior
Ryan Haviland also had to skip a few
matches while they recovered from foot
and knee injuries, respectively.
"We lost [Morris] early, and that was a
big loss to ns," Gould said. "When the
MRI came back that showed [Hippen
steel] had a more serious injury than a
simple muscle pull, we knew we were out
two tremendous players."
Stanford entered the NCAA team
tournament having lost its last three dual
matches at home. Still, when Stanford
faced Sacramento Sate on Saturday in the
first round, spirits were high.
The Cardinal readied for its faceoff
against the unranked Hornets in the af
ternoon after viewing the morning
match, in which Washington crushed
No. 32 Tulane, 4-2.
The Stanford / Sacramento State
match opened with the Cardinal's sec
ond-ranked doubles team of Scott Lip
sky and David Martin easily routing the
Hornets' Matthew Jones and Sherif
Sahar, 8-2.
That win opened the floodgates, as
Haviland and Warburg concluded their
8-3 pasting of Peter Farkas and Fabio
Jesus. With the doubles point now se
cure for Stanford, play was suspended
on the third match, in which sopho
more Joe Kao and freshman Phil
Sheng, leading 7-4, were on the verge of
another Cardinal victory.
The singles play was over nearly as
quickly. In an impressive show of preci
sion and force, Warburg shut down Nick
Sheehan, 6-0, 6-0.
Kao, after being robbed of his dou
bles victory, performed solidly in his 6-
1,6-2 domination of Farkas. Soon after,
No. 28 Martin swept Zaher away, 6-2,
6-2, and the rest of the games were sus
pended as Stanford had clinched the

match, 4-0.
"It was no secret that Sacramento
State was the weakest team of the
four," Gould said. "As such, I think the
guys approached the match well, and
played well."
The Huskies came blazing out of the
gate on Sunday, taking early breaks in all
three of the doubles sets.
Ari Strasberg and Alex Vlaski
avenged losses earlier in the season to
Lipsky and Martin with an 8-6 upset of
the Stanford duo.
Haviland and Warburg, playing as
solidly as ever, evened the score with an
8-6 victory over Matt Hanlin and Dillon
Ruby of Washington.
However, the point was sealed by the
Huskies when Kao and Sheng lost their
bitterly contested set, 8-5.
"We knew we had to win the doubles
point, but this time, they jumped right on
us at the start," Gould said. "We had a
chance to come back from the early
breaks, but we were unable to capitalize
on our chances.
"Everybody did a good job. Ryan
[Haviland] deserves a lot of credit for
being so flexible and playing well with
any partner he's placed with."
Although the doubles point was lost,
the Cardinal knew that it still had a
chance thanks to its solid singles game.
Warburg continued his impressive
streak with another easy victory over
Ruby, 6-3, 6-2.
Sheng, unsatisfied after Saturday's
two suspended matches, completed the
freshman domination of the Huskies by
finishing his opponent quickly, 6-3, 6-3.
The Cardinal lead increased to 3.-1 as
No. 49 Haviland downed his opponent in
straight sets, 6-4, 6-2. At that point, the

Cardinal's chances looked good,
but it was up to the remaining play
ers locked in the middle of three
very grueling matches to grab the
needed point to win.
Washington's top player, No. 29
Vlaski, was the first to finish, with a
close second-set tiebreak victory
over No. 51 Lipsky.
Kao had taken the first set, 7-5,
from his opponent, but he was then
worn down, 6-0, 6-4.

All eyes were now turned on
the drama playing out on court
one, where Martin and No. 49
Hanlin were locked in a contest
of wills. Martin had taken the
first set, 7-5, but was unable to
take advantage of a volley at
tempt at 5-5 in the second-set
tiebreaker. Hanlin then man
aged to regroup and serve for
the set. Martin fell apart after the
second-set loss and was put away,
6-1, in the third set.
"We lost to a good te?m that
played well, and even though we
played well too, we were a little bit
too thin to not lose two players

and expect to win all the time,"
Gould said. "I give credit to
everybody for stepping up."
l iie win was revenge for the
Washington squad, which had
been crushed by Stanford, 6-1, at
Taubeon March 30. In that match,
Martin defeated Hanlin in three
similarly punishing sets.
Washington will now play
Auburn in the Round of 16 at
Texas A&M next week.

gate on Sunday, taking early breaks in all
three of the doubles sets.
Ari Strasberg and Alex Vlaski
avenged losses earlier in the season to
Lipsky and Martin with an 8-6 upset of
the Stanford duo.
Haviland and Warburg, playing as
solidly as ever, evened the score with an
8-6 victory over Matt Hanlin and Dillon
Ruby of Washington.
However, the point was sealed by the
Huskies when Kao and Sheng lost their
bitterly contested set, 8-5.
"We knew we had to win the doubles
point, but this time, they jumped right on
us at the start," Gould said. "We had a
chance to come back from the early
breaks, but we were unable to capitalize
on our chances.
"Everybody did a good job. Ryan
[Haviland] deserves a lot of credit for
being so flexible and playing well with
any partner he's placed with."
Although the doubles point was lost,
the Cardinal knew that it still had a
chance thanks to its solid singles game.
Warburg continued his impressive
streak with another easy victory over
Ruby, 6-3, 6-2.
Sheng, unsatisfied after Saturday's
two suspended matches, completed the
freshman domination of the Huskies by
finishing his opponent quickly, 6-3, 6-3.
The Cardinal lead increased to 3.-1 as
No. 49 Haviland downed his opponent in
straight sets, 6-4, 6-2. At that point, the

Tennis Stadium on Sunday in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.
Cardinal's chances looked good,
but it was up to the remaining play
ers locked in the middle of three
very grueling matches to grab the
needed point to win.
Washington's top player, No. 29
Vlaski, was the first to finish, with a
close second-set tiebreak victory
over No. 51 Lipsky.
Kao had taken the first set, 7-5,
from his opponent, but he was then
worn down, 6-0, 6-4.

All eyes were now turned on
the drama playing out on court
one, where Martin and No. 49
Hanlin were locked in a contest
of wills. Martin had taken the
first set, 7-5, but was unable to
take advantage of a volley at
tempt at 5-5 in the second-set
tiebreaker. Hanlin then man
aged to regroup and serve for
the set. Martin fell apart after the
second-set loss and was put away,
6-1, in the third set.
"We lost to a good te?m that
played well, and even though we
played well too, we were a little bit
too thin to not lose two players

and expect to win all the time,"
Gould said. "I give credit to
everybody for stepping up."
l iie win was revenge for the
Washington squad, which had
been crushed by Stanford, 6-1, at
Taubeon March 30. In that match,
Martin defeated Hanlin in three
similarly punishing sets.
Washington will now play
Auburn in the Round of 16 at
Texas A&M next week.
NCAA Individuals begin May
22 in College Station. Stanford is
expected to field four singles play

No. 6 Stanford was narrowly upset, 4-
3, by No. 35 Washington on Sunday in the
second round of the NCAA Tournament.

Round

Second Round

The loss, played iti front of a large
crowd at the Taube Family Tennis Stadi
um, ended the team's season at 20-6 and
finished what could only be called a very
interesting year.
"We knew it was going to be a tough
match," said head coach Dick Gould.
"Only five or six teams are better than
them in the round of 16. In the Pacific 10
Conference Individual Tournament,
Washington had two players in the semis
and one guy in the finals."
Stanford was a preseason favorite for
the NCAA crown, especially after win
ning the National Team Indoor Champi
onships in February. The Cardinal was a
different team then, in composition if not
also in heart.
Three-time Ail-American senior K.J.
Hippensteel was still playing tfien, and all
the other players were healthy and near
the top of their games.
With junior Carter Morris already out
for the season with mononucleosis, Hip
pensteel's back injury on April 13
couldn't have come at a worse time.

Freshman Sam Warburg and junior
Ryan Haviland also had to skip a few
matches while they recovered from foot
and knee injuries, respectively.
"We lost [Morris] early, and that was a
big loss to ns," Gould said. "When the
MRI came back that showed [Hippen
steel] had a more serious injury than a
simple muscle pull, we knew we were out
two tremendous players."
Stanford entered the NCAA team
tournament having lost its last three dual
matches at home. Still, when Stanford
faced Sacramento Sate on Saturday in the
first round, spirits were high.
The Cardinal readied for its faceoff
against the unranked Hornets in the af
ternoon after viewing the morning
match, in which Washington crushed
No. 32 Tulane, 4-2.
The Stanford / Sacramento State
match opened with the Cardinal's sec
ond-ranked doubles team of Scott Lip
sky and David Martin easily routing the
Hornets' Matthew Jones and Sherif
Sahar, 8-2.
That win opened the floodgates, as
Haviland and Warburg concluded their
8-3 pasting of Peter Farkas and Fabio
Jesus. With the doubles point now se
cure for Stanford, play was suspended
on the third match, in which sopho
more Joe Kao and freshman Phil
Sheng, leading 7-4, were on the verge of
another Cardinal victory.
The singles play was over nearly as
quickly. In an impressive show of preci
sion and force, Warburg shut down Nick
Sheehan, 6-0, 6-0.
Kao, after being robbed of his dou
bles victory, performed solidly in his 6-
1,6-2 domination of Farkas. Soon after,
No. 28 Martin swept Zaher away, 6-2,
6-2, and the rest of the games were sus
pended as Stanford had clinched the

match, 4-0.
"It was no secret that Sacramento
State was the weakest team of the
four," Gould said. "As such, I think the
guys approached the match well, and
played well."
