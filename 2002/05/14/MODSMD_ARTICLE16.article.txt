# Baseball heads to 'Biggest Little City'

### MAC LEVINE STAFF WRITER 
Reno is the self-anointed "Biggest
Little City in the World," full of bright
lights and round-the-clock gambling
action — enough to make your average
group of college-aged men more than
a little distracted.

BASEBALL
Today: No. 7 Stanford vs. Nevada,
2:00 p.m., Reno

But for the No. 7 Stanford baseball
team (35-17, 11-7 Pacific 10 Conference),
its jaunt to Reno today is a little different.
It is strictly business.
After taking two of three games from
Arizona State this past weekend at
Sunken Diamond, the team travels to
take on Nevada (21-29) this afternoon at
Peccote Park fora nonconference game.
With a victory in Sunday's game
against the Sun Devils, the Cardinal
moved into a tie for second place in the
conference standings with Washington

(25-22-1, 11-7), two games behind Pac
-10 leader No. 20 Southern California
(30-19, 13-5).
Although today's game — Stanford's
final nonconference game of the season
— will not count toward the Pac-10 stand
ings, every game is absolutely crucial mo
mentum-wise with the race for the con
ference title coming clown to the wire.
The last thing the Cardinal wants right
now is a loss just before this weekend's
showdown at UCLA (24-29,8-10).
If motivation for the matchup with
the seemingly overmatched Nevada
were in question, you can be certain
that the juniors and seniors on the Car
dinal will not be taking the Wolf Pack
lightly. It knows firsthand the dangers
of such an oversight.
Two years ago, in a mid-week game
just days before Stanford took on nation
al powerhouse Florida State, the top
ranked (Cardinal faced Nevada at Sunken
Diamond, where Stanford had won 19
straight games. The Wolf Pack showed lit
tle concern for that winning streak, shock
ing the Cardinal with a late-inning rally to

win, 4-3. The loss knocked Stanford out
of the top spot in the polls.
But with this year's veteran-laden
squad, the Cardinal won't likely make the
same mistake again, especially with the
way the team has been hitting lately.
Sophomore centerfielder Sam Fuld
has led the recent offensive charge, with
nine multiple-hit performances in his last
10 games, and 15 in his last 17. Over this
17-game stretch, Fuld has hit an unbe
lievable .522, raising his team-high bat
ting average to .378 on the season and
climbing to first in Stanford's career bat
ting average list with a .369 mark.
Junior catcher Ryan Garko has redis
covered his power stroke after a brief
slump to the tune of five home runs over
his last 11 games. Garko now leads the
team with 12 homers and 45 and RBI,
while still providing consistent defense
behind the plate.
This afternoon, Fuld, Garko and the
rest of the Cardinal will take on a Nevada
team that is coming off a three-game
