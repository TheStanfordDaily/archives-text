# Club lacrosse falls at nationals
## Colorado State beats Stanford in overtime of quarter final game 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
At this point, it's probably safe
to say that the Stanford men's club
lacrosse team has found a rival in
Colorado State.
Last year, the Rams cut off the
12th-seeded Cardinal's surprising
run at the United States Lacrosse
Intercollegiate Associates National
Championships, cruising to a 16-7
win in the championship game.
The defending national champi
ons then picked up a 13-7 win over
Stanford during the regular sea
son this year back on March 8.
But the real kicker came on
Thursday when Colorado State
took Stanford out of this year's
USLIA National Championships in
St. Louis, this time in far more gut
wrenching fashion than last year.
The Rains' Jim Hasson swatted
a loose-ball rebound in the Stan
ford crease past Cardinal junior
goalkeeper Cavin Sun just over a
minute into sudden-death over
lime to give No. 3 Colorado State
a 10-9 win over No. 6 Stanford.

Hasson's goal gave the Rams
their only lead of the game as they
overcame a five-goal halftime
deficit and tallied six fourth-quar
ter goals to force the extra period.
"It was pure sport out there,
and somebody had to lose," said
senior midfielder lan Weiss, who
finished with seven goals and five
assists in Stanford's three games in
St. Louis. "Still, it hurt to watch
[Colorado State] play [UC-Santa
Barbara] the next day in the semi
final when we had hoped to be
there. We went down lighting in a
game the seniors can still be truly
proud of."
Early on, it looked like the Car
dinal was going to get its revenge
on the Rams in grand style. Stan
ford led 4-0 after one quarter and
by the fifth minute of the second
frame, five different goal scorers
had given the Cardinal a 5-0 lead.
Tim Farquhar got the Rams on
the board with 9:44 to go in the
half, but sophomore attacker Kiel
Renick scored his second and
third goals of the game late in the
quarter to send Stanford into half
time with a 7-2 lead.
But the tide turned in the sec
ond half, as the Colorado State at
tackers finally started beating the
tight Stanford defense and the
Cardinal started giving the Rams

Extra-man opportunities.
Hasson scored the only goal of
the third quarter, and three goals
early in the fourth quarter
brought the Rams to within one at
7-6 with 1 1:34 to go in regulation.
Renick's fourth goal of the game
on a fast break just nine seconds
later gave Stanford a bit of breath
ing room, but a goal by Farquhar
and a goal by Mike Napolilli with
the Rams two men up evened the
game at 8-8 with 6:29 to go.
Weiss put Stanford ahead
again with 3:49 left on a no-angle
shot that somehow beat Rams'
goalkeeper Alex Smith. Colorado
State answered again, however, as
Nick Stanitz-Harper scored a
backdoor goal with just 1:44 left to
send the game to overtime.
"To come out fast on a team
that makes a living doing just that
gave us every reason to think we
could win," Weiss said. "And with
a 7-2 score in our favor at half
time, we had control. In the end,
a combination of changes in de
fensive strategy on their part, us
spending too much time in the
penalty box and a lucky rebound
off a shot in overtime gave them
the win"
Renick added an assist to his
four goals fora game-high five
points. Sun fought off a barrage of
Colorado State shots to pick up 15
saves on the day as the Rams out
shot Stanford, 48-22.
Colorado State went on to
eventually fall to Sonoma State in
Saturday's championship game,
while Stanford moved into the
consolation bracket to take on
Michigan.
Despite a three-point perfor
mance from Weiss, the Cardinal
fell to the Wolverines on Friday,
6-4.
Stanford had advanced to the
quarterfinals thanks to a dominat
ing 17-10 win over No. 11 Texas
A&M in Wednesday's first round.
The teams exchanged the lead
several times in the first half, with
a goal by Stanford junior midfield
er Pete Munzig giving the Cardi
nal a 9-8 halftime edge.
The Cardinal defense showed
its stuff in the second half, holding
the Aggies to just two goals.
A pair of goals by Weiss — his
fourth and fifth of the game —
helped Stanford open 14-10 lead
by the end of the third quarter.
Sun then blanked Texas A&M in
the fourth while the Cardinal of
fense added three more goals to
seal the 17-10 win.
Munzig — who along with se
nior defender Tim Sargen was
named a first-team All Star —
also finished with five goals for
Stanford, while Sun finished with
12 saves.
Despite the disappointing end

to its season, the Cardinal squad
relishes the fact that it continued
to put Stanford on the men's
lacrosse map over the course of
the year.
The team will graduate the
core of its defense, but almost all of
the team's prolific-scoring offense
will return for next season's cam
paign. Six of the team's nine goal
scorers in St. Louis were freshmen

or sophomores.
"I'm not sure that we could
have asked for more this year,"
Sargen said. "Injuries early in the
year limited us somewhat, but we
came together as a team and
peaked at the right time. I think
it's clear that at this point that
teams fear playing Stanford,
which would have been ridiculous
even two years ago."
