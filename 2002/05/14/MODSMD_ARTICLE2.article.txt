### ANNE BECKER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Using the events of Sept. 11 as a
framework, three-time Pulitzer
Prize-winning journalist Thomas
Friedman spoke to a packed Dinkel
spiel Auditorium yesterday on the
balance of power in today's global
ized world.
Friedman, the foreign affairs
columnist for The New York Times,
pointed out several things Ameri
cans can learn from the event, and
actions both Americans and Arabs
should take in reaction to it.
He began by describing context
in which the events took place.
"In the last decade and a half or
so, we've moved from a world of di
vision and walls, to a world of inte
gration and web," he said.
According lo Friedman, within
this world, the balance of power is
no longer just a balance between
states, but also between states and
"super-empowered people" like
Osama bin Laden.
1 n citing salient features apparent
from the events of Sept. 11, Fried
man explained how people like bin
leaden can rise to power in weak
Arab-states. He described a self-per
petuating "circle of bin-Ladenism"
in Arab suites in which authoritari
an regimes fund anti-modernist
religious educators whose teach
ings reinforce authoritarianism
and poverty.
Friedman said Sept. 11 brought
to light the "uncomfortably close
analogy" between Saudi Arabia
and the Soviet Union during the
Cold War. He stressed the impor

tance of involving the country in
creating peace.
Me also described "messy
states" like Russia, Pakistan and
Afghanistan, which he said
were "too big to fail, but too
messy to work."
"These states are caught in a
transition, and how they are nur
tured out of their messiness into
some form of order will very much
affect the stability of the world we
live in,"he said.
Citing the downside of globaliza
tion, Friedman stressed the impor
tance of the fact that Sept. 1 l's ter
rorists were spurred towards radi
calism not living in the Middle East,
but living in Europe. l ie also noted
the downside of the Internet.
"What's happening in the world
is we are being linked together tech
nologically far faster than we're
being linked socially or culturally,"
he said. "We're in each other's faces
technologically but without the abil
ity to understand in any other way.
The shrinking of the world, rather
than bringing us closer together, is
actually raising the blood pressure
of the world."
Friedman said that the United
States and the Arab world shared
the responsibility of responding to
the events and stressed the impor
tance of seeking retribution for the
terrorists by "killing their ideas."
"There is absolutely no doubt in
my mind that Osama bin Laden
and his crew are responsible, and it
is extremely important that these
people be brought to justice even if
we have to look in every cave in
Tora Bora," he said. "People say vi

olence doesn't solve everything, but
that's actually not true. Targeted vi
olence on people who are out to kill
you solves a lot."
Friedman addressed the current
situation in the Middle East by say
ing the United States should see the
violence as a window of opportunity
to intercede and promote peace. He
explained that Israelis and Arabs
had "punctured each other's vul
nerability" and that despite day-to
day policy, both sides wanted an end
to the violence.

"Don't pay attention to what
you read in the newspaper," he
said. "Do not listen to what people
are saying. Listen to what they are
feeling. This story is not in the
news, it is in the silence. Both com
munities are desperate and want
this conflict over."
Friedman criticized the Bush ad
ministration for being slow to take
initial action in the Middle East and
for wavering between policies.

New York Times Columnist Thomas Friedman, a three-fime Pulitzer Prizewin
ner, spoke yesterday at Dinkelspiel Auditorium. He reflected on the events of
Sept. 11 and the balance of power in the world today.
"There's a saying that when you
don't know where you are going,
any road w ill get you there. Bush
has basically been on any road for
the last lew months."
Friedman t ailed for Bush to real
ize the window of opportunity lor
Arab-Israeli peace, and also urged
the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol
on emissions to assure partnership
from other countries in America's
war on terrorism.
" If we are going to wage a war on
terrorism and go stomping around
the world wiping out al Qaeda cells
from Manila to Brussels to New
York, we damn well better be the
best global citizen we can be and we
better be perceived that way," he
said. "This is not just about fighting
our war and "we're not going to win

this war without partners."
Crediting Osama bin Laden as
"an authentic character," Friedman
also called for Arab nations to chal
lenge bin Laden's ideology on
equally authentic grounds.
"Bin leaden has an Islamic, Arab
based, retrograde message," he
said. "What is needed is an authen
tic, Islamic , Arab-based ideological
message that takes Bin Laden on his
own terms. We do not want a war
with Islam, but we do want a war
within Islam. There are the re
sources to do that, but there hasn't
been a political or religious leader to
articulate that message."
The speech was co-sponsored by
the ASSU Speakers Bureau and
Hillel. Leaders of both organiza
tions were pleased with the event.
"This was a rare opportunity to
reach such a broad audience with
such a powerful conversation on
something as relevant as what
Friedman talked about today," said

Debt a Feldstein, executive director
of Hillel. "Students of varying per
spectives and backgrounds were
able to engage in conversation that
will hopefully extend onto the
whole campus."
Senior Bill Falsey, director of the
Speakers Bureau, also said the
event was a success.
"Friedman was one of the most
intellectual and engaging speakers
we've had," he said. "You could just
tell people were really engaged by
what he had to say."
Friedman spoke lor about an
hour and then answered questions
from students only. Student reac
tion to the speech was also positive.
"I owe a debt of gratitude to Hil
lel and the Speakers' Bureau for
bringing Friedman here," said se
nior Josh Saidolf, president of the
Stanford Israel Alliance. "I respect
him very deeply. He has a lyrical
way of presenting his analysis that is
always entertaining."

said. "What is needed is an authen
tic, Islamic , Arab-based ideological
message that takes Bin Laden on his
own terms. We do not want a war
with Islam, but we do want a war
within Islam. There are the re
sources to do that, but there hasn't
been a political or religious leader to
articulate that message."
The speech was co-sponsored by
the ASSU Speakers Bureau and
Hillel. Leaders of both organiza
tions were pleased with the event.
"This was a rare opportunity to
reach such a broad audience with
such a powerful conversation on
something as relevant as what
Friedman talked about today," said

Debt a Feldstein, executive director
of Hillel. "Students of varying per
spectives and backgrounds were
able to engage in conversation that
will hopefully extend onto the
whole campus."
Senior Bill Falsey, director of the
Speakers Bureau, also said the
event was a success.
"Friedman was one of the most
intellectual and engaging speakers
we've had," he said. "You could just
tell people were really engaged by
what he had to say."
Friedman spoke lor about an
hour and then answered questions
from students only. Student reac
tion to the speech was also positive.
"I owe a debt of gratitude to Hil
lel and the Speakers' Bureau for
bringing Friedman here," said se
nior Josh Saidolf, president of the
Stanford Israel Alliance. "I respect
him very deeply. He has a lyrical
way of presenting his analysis that is
always entertaining."
Using the events of Sept. 11 as a
framework, three-time Pulitzer
Prize-winning journalist Thomas
Friedman spoke to a packed Dinkel
spiel Auditorium yesterday on the
balance of power in today's global
ized world.
Friedman, the foreign affairs
columnist for The New York Times,
pointed out several things Ameri
cans can learn from the event, and
actions both Americans and Arabs
should take in reaction to it.
He began by describing context
in which the events took place.
"In the last decade and a half or
so, we've moved from a world of di
vision and walls, to a world of inte
gration and web," he said.
According lo Friedman, within
this world, the balance of power is
no longer just a balance between
states, but also between states and
"super-empowered people" like
Osama bin Laden.
1 n citing salient features apparent
from the events of Sept. 11, Fried
man explained how people like bin
leaden can rise to power in weak
Arab-states. He described a self-per
petuating "circle of bin-Ladenism"
in Arab suites in which authoritari
an regimes fund anti-modernist
religious educators whose teach
ings reinforce authoritarianism
and poverty.
Friedman said Sept. 11 brought
to light the "uncomfortably close
analogy" between Saudi Arabia
and the Soviet Union during the
Cold War. He stressed the impor

tance of involving the country in
creating peace.
Me also described "messy
states" like Russia, Pakistan and
Afghanistan, which he said
were "too big to fail, but too
messy to work."
"These states are caught in a
transition, and how they are nur
tured out of their messiness into
some form of order will very much
affect the stability of the world we
live in,"he said.
Citing the downside of globaliza
tion, Friedman stressed the impor
tance of the fact that Sept. 1 l's ter
rorists were spurred towards radi
calism not living in the Middle East,
but living in Europe. l ie also noted
the downside of the Internet.
"What's happening in the world
is we are being linked together tech
nologically far faster than we're
being linked socially or culturally,"
he said. "We're in each other's faces
technologically but without the abil
ity to understand in any other way.
The shrinking of the world, rather
than bringing us closer together, is
actually raising the blood pressure
of the world."
Friedman said that the United
States and the Arab world shared
the responsibility of responding to
the events and stressed the impor
tance of seeking retribution for the
terrorists by "killing their ideas."
"There is absolutely no doubt in
my mind that Osama bin Laden
and his crew are responsible, and it
is extremely important that these
people be brought to justice even if
we have to look in every cave in
Tora Bora," he said. "People say vi

olence doesn't solve everything, but
that's actually not true. Targeted vi
olence on people who are out to kill
you solves a lot."
Friedman addressed the current
situation in the Middle East by say
ing the United States should see the
violence as a window of opportunity
to intercede and promote peace. He
explained that Israelis and Arabs
had "punctured each other's vul
nerability" and that despite day-to
day policy, both sides wanted an end
to the violence.

"Don't pay attention to what
you read in the newspaper," he
said. "Do not listen to what people
are saying. Listen to what they are
feeling. This story is not in the
news, it is in the silence. Both com
munities are desperate and want
this conflict over."
Friedman criticized the Bush ad
ministration for being slow to take
initial action in the Middle East and
for wavering between policies.

New York Times Columnist Thomas Friedman, a three-fime Pulitzer Prizewin
ner, spoke yesterday at Dinkelspiel Auditorium. He reflected on the events of
Sept. 11 and the balance of power in the world today.
"There's a saying that when you
don't know where you are going,
any road w ill get you there. Bush
has basically been on any road for
the last lew months."
Friedman t ailed for Bush to real
ize the window of opportunity lor
Arab-Israeli peace, and also urged
the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol
on emissions to assure partnership
from other countries in America's
war on terrorism.
" If we are going to wage a war on
terrorism and go stomping around
the world wiping out al Qaeda cells
from Manila to Brussels to New
York, we damn well better be the
best global citizen we can be and we
better be perceived that way," he
said. "This is not just about fighting
our war and "we're not going to win

this war without partners."
Crediting Osama bin Laden as
"an authentic character," Friedman
also called for Arab nations to chal
lenge bin Laden's ideology on
equally authentic grounds.
"Bin leaden has an Islamic, Arab
based, retrograde message," he
said. "What is needed is an authen
tic, Islamic , Arab-based ideological
message that takes Bin Laden on his
own terms. We do not want a war
with Islam, but we do want a war
