# Hackers, excess use slow network access
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Students across campus have
reported more lags in and shut
downs of their Internet service
during this school year than
ever before. <•
Some are quick to blame
their problems on hacker at
tacks or complicated computer
network failures, even though
these problems often occur
when Internet service works
properly-. Senior Nick Presley, a
resident computer coordinator
in the Suites, explained why the
Internet can be slow for users
even when the network runs as
it should.
"It depends on [the level of)
network traffic that is happen
ing [at the time and] whether
yon are on in the evening
hours," Presley said. "It is
hard to attribute that to net

work problems."
Presley said that although
slowdowns occur because the
network is overloaded with traf
fic, he does not necessarily see a
solution in something as simple
as increasing network capacity.
"I would definitely say resi
dents will expand to use whatev
er bandwidth is there," Presley
said. "I have no doubt that this
college can use up whatever is
given to it."
Ethan Rikleen, a Residential
Computing network and system
administrator, explained how
hacking can slow or shut down
1 nternet connections.
"If you turn on [file-sharing]
access to your computer, then
someone else can get into your
machine remotely and can stick
something onto your comput
er," Rikleen said. "The most
common thing someone sticks on
your computer is a program that
will run a Trojan horse that will
issue a distributed denial-of-ser
vice attack. These attacks Hood the
network with so much traffic that
the local network cannot handle it
and the network goes down."
Rikleen said that computers
running Windows 2000 are most
easily compromised because the
default setting on the software is
for full file-sharing access.
"If everyone bought Macs or
Unix machines, that would make
us a lot happier," Rikleen said.
"The problem with Windows
2000 is that besides that it has a
number of security holes, jit]
comes out of the box with [all the
features] turned on. While it is the
user's responsibility, it certainly
isn't their fault."
Several residences have recent
ly complained of Internet outages
that lasted days at a time.
"Mysteriously, my Internet
[connection] was shut down one

day," saici freshman Jason 1 lom. "1
talked to my RCC and he was able
to restore it. I'm st ill not really sure
what happened though, but it def
initely wasn't working like it was
supposed to for some time."
Rikleen said that nothing has
changed in terms of existing net
work service and support; rather,
it is the increased volume of hack
er attacks this year that strains the
resources of Res Comp.
"We have not had anything re
ally that has changed in our sup
port model," Rikleen said. "With
these new security loopholes, how
ever, the quantity of incidents is
drastically greater than it ever has
been in the past."
Rikleen mentioned his staff is
examining different solutions to
help alleviate the amount of their
time that is currently occupied by
dealing with the attacks.
"We are planning on develop
ing some software to streamline the
process," Rikleen said. "[ The com
puter security department] would
drop a note to us and alert us to in
fected computers. We have not had
such an organized process in the
past because we didn't need one."
While Res Comp currently has

no official evening or weekend
technical support, Rikleen did
not dismiss the possibility of
change in the future concerning
support hours.
"Probably the better solution is
... . to hire a couple more people
— we only have one or two stu
dents at the moment and three
full-time staff who do this sort of
thing," Rikleen said. "If we find
another source of money in the
future, then we can provide 24-
hour coverage."
In the meantime though, Pres
ley explained that hacker attacks
are relatively easy for the average
user to safeguard against.
"The easiest thing to do is to
have a password on your com
puter and to have some sort of
anti-virus program running at
all times, and make sure that it is
up-to-date," Presley said. "Make
sure that you don't open up at
tachments unless you know what
t hey are."
For those that do not already
have it for their own protection, a
free copy of Norton Anti-Virus is
available to Stanford students on
