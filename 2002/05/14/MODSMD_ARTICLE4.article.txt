## 
### SARAH PAPÉ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
South Asian culture came
alive Sunday night at the 10th
annual Mela show as student mu
sicians and dancers performed
fora sold-out crowd at Dinkel
spiel Auditorium.
Sanskriti, Stanford's South
Asian society, hosted the event.
Mela, which means festival or cele
bration, brought together differ
ent South Asian cultures.
"Perhaps what made Mela such
an extraordinary show was that it
featured an incredible variety of
traditional and pop South Asian
art forms: music, dance and video
were all put on display," said fresh
man Sanskriti officer Sheila Bijoor.
The night featured traditional
dances such as Bharata Natyam
and Bhangra Punjabda, along
with more modern Filmi dances
from Bollywood — the Indian
film industry. Students also per
formed Filmi music and classical
Indian music. One act, Rhy-dhun,
combined three distinct forms of
dance: Bharatanatyam, Garba
and Kathak.
"I particularly enjoyed the fu
sion dance for its creative blend of
different traditional, South Asian
dance forms," Bijoor said.
Freshman Marisol Wauters
echoed Bijoor.
"1 enjoyed the fusion dance be
cause you were able to compare
the costumes and dances more di
rectly. 1 like the choreography of
combining the dances."
The night also featured skits

and videos that took a light-heart
ed look at Indian stereotypes at
Stanford and Indian traditions
such as arranged marriages. Sahe
li, Stanford's South Asian women's
alliance, presented a fashion show
complete with bio-datas of all the
models so the mothers in the audi
ence would know who would be
good for their sons.
But the event was not exclusive
ly focused on Indian culture. Over
120 students from different cultur
al backgrounds performed in the
event. At intermission, representa
tives from Hindu and Islamic stu
dent groups came on stage fora
moment of silence to promote
peace between the two groups.
"We are here to celebrate our
individual heritages and to cele
brate togetherness," said sopho
more Rashi Mittal, one of the
show's producers.
The event also drew people
from outside the South Asian
community.
"There were a lot of people in
my dorm who had a role in it, so
I wanted to see them," Wauters
said. I heard that it was a really
big deal and really good from
upperclassmen."
Forty-five minutes after tVie
doors opened, the event sold out.
"This year's Mela was a tremen
dous success," Bijoor said. "It fea
tured nine beautiful cultural per
formances and a brilliantly funny
emcee act. The Sanskriti officers
and performers worked for sever
al months to coordinate this show,
and no one was disappointed."
The organization's members
announced at the end of the show
that they had received the 2002
Dean of Students Achievement

Award, which is given to the 10
student groups who have made
the greatest contribution to cam
pus life.
"We're very excited about re
ceiving this," said senior Rajen
Desai, a co-chair for Sanskriti,
told the audience. "This is the
highest honor any group can re
ceive at Stanford.
