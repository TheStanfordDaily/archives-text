### YASI HASHEMI EDITORIAL STAFF 
Over 300 Stanford students
participated in the American
Cancer Society's Relay for Life,
an 18-hour, overnight team
event at Gunn High School to
fight cancer.
The relay — which is in its first
year in Palo Alto — is designed to
raise community awareness about
cancer and money to support
cancer research in the area. Stu
dents and community members
organized teams of 10 to 20 mem
bers to collect contributions prior
to the event. The relay itself was a
celebration to commemorate the
end of the fund raising, in which
teams pitched tents on the high
school's football field and mem
bers took turns walking or run
ning around the track.
A ceremony with luminaria
lights was also held on Friday
night to honor cancer survivors
or remember those who have
died from the disease. Cancer
survivors were invited to take the
first lap.
In all, 30 teams raised a com

bined total of over $64,500.
"We anticipated having 10
teams initially," said sopho
more Jonathan Olsen, Stanford
liaison to the American Cancer
Society and chair of team re
cruitment. "What we got ex
ceeded our wildest expectations
. . . This is huge."
Olsen explained that the ini
tial goal was to raise $40,000. He
and other Stanford students
began planning the event in
early November.
Mykel Kochenderfer, a coter
minal student in computer sci
ence, and his wife, Mary Anne
Kochenderfer, a coterminal stu
dent in education, played a
large role in the organization of
the event.
Mykel Kochenderfer served as
co-chair of the relay, while Mary
Anne Kochenderfer — a cancer
survivor — is a national member
of Colleges Against Cancer.
"[The relay] was way more suc
cessful than anticipated," Mykel
Kochenderfer said.
