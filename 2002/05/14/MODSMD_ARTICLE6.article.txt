### HELEN CHENG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford student filmmakers are saying
"Lights, camera, action!" across campus as
they direct and shoot their own movies for
the 2002 Stanford Student 112 ilm Festival,
which starts Thursday.
The Stanford Film Society showcases
films made by Stanford students. Hun
dreds of student actors, designers, crew
members, writers and directors have
put in countless hours to make the

event possible.
"It's shown me that despite the work,
the frustration and the lack of sleep, film
making is something I really love to do,"
said kalilah Robinson, a sophomore.
An open and flexible selection process
makes the films in ihe festival diverse in
their origin, message and style.
Films come from three areas: the stu
dent-filmmakers workshop, the fil-giant
program and open submissions, accord
ing to junior Kirk Shimano.
Shimano assisted in organizing the

workshop, which was, a year-long, stu
dent-taught production course. Films of
student participants are automatically
entered into the festival as part of the
class requirement.
Students can also apply for film grants,
which are awarded by the society.
"The grants [are] chosen by a commit
tee with criteria that range from how de
veloped the idea [is] to how much money
[makes] the project feasible," said Emily
Mandelbaum, a member of the film grant
selection committee.

Eighteen film grants were awarded this
year, an award that includes funding for
production of the film, as well as use and
rental of club equipment.
I he open submissions option is new
this year. Anyone affiliated with Stanford,
including undergraduates, graduates and
alumni, can apply. I he open submissions
selection committee selected several of
these films for screening at the festival.
"I think that the festival is really inspir
ing. Anyone on campus can make a film if
they want to," Mandelbaum said.

The film festival traces its roots to 1995,
when the then-fledgling Stanford Film
Society showed one or two movies irregu
larly. The student film workshop was cre
ated in 1999, and the society began to buy
more equipment. In 2000, IS students
were chosen for the workshop out of a 50-
applicant pool, and the program contin
ued to giow.
"I'd say last year's festival was extreme
ly successful," Shimano said. "We had Iwo
full nights of original student films,
and we managed to fill Cubberley
on both nights— 1 think everyone
who attended left with a greater
appreciation of the possibilities of
student film."
Past entries have covered a
broad range of genres, although
"student film is limited in what it
can do effectively," said senior
Matt Brutocao, former president
of the society.
Nevertheless, audiences have
seen parodies, dramas, love stories,
comedies, abstract art films and
documentaries. Plots have involved
such diverse topics as snowboard
ing, stand-up comedy, twisted love,
martial arts and killer turkeys.
"We accept films from any
genre, including both narrative
and documentary pieces," Shi
mano said. "It's a non-competitive
festival, so it's really just all about
bringing together Stanford's stu
dent filmmaking community and
sharing their work with Stanford

at large."
Students who have participat
ed in the festival agree that it is a
great way to meet people with
similar interests.
In addition, most filmmakers
express a great deal of personal en
thusiasm for the filmmaking
process.
"I've been making movies my
entire life," Brutocao said. "I try to
take some aspect of my life that I'm
passionate about — some sort of
feeling about people and life —
and mask it in a story."
Shimano said, "My primary in
terest is in screenwriting, so at first
I was unsure if participating in the
entire filmmaking process was the
right route for me. It turns out that
making a film is the best screen
writing education I could ever
hope for."
"My favorite part is the actual
directing," Brutocao said, "saying
'Action' and 'Cut' and setting the
camera, getting actors in the right
place, selecting shots and giving
actors their motivation."
Kven though the filmmakers
said they enjoyed the art, the final
products do not come without a

great deal of time and effort.
"It can be a really big time
eater," Mandelbaum said.
Brutocao equates it to taking a
five-unit or six-unit class. "People
at Stanford are so busy," he said.
"At the same time, the people that
you have are very talented."
"Filmmaking is really a full-time
job, so trying to squeeze filming
into our busy Stanford schedules
sometimes verges on the impossi
ble," Shimano said. "Last year,
when editing [my film] 'Discard
ed,' my roommate and I took the I
a.m. to 8 a.m. editing shift for at
least three days in a row."
Senior David Halliday, co
president of the society, re
called spending over 200 hours
on one project.
"[lt was] extremely difficult but
oddly rewarding," Halliday said.
According to some participants,
the hard work pays off in the end.
"The best thing about produc
ing a film is the first time I show
it to an audience. The premiere
setting is just incredible," Bruto
cao said.
Mandelbaum agreed.
"It was really amazing to see the

finished project up on a huge
screen," she said.
Although some festival entrants
merely do it for fun, others have
different reasons.
"As a filmmaker, to say your
movie was shown at the Stanford
Film Festival is huge, and people
are much more willing to look at
your work," Brutocao said.
Graduates have gone 011 to work
for companies like Fox Searchlight
and Walt Disney. Actress Reese
Witherspoon, who was a former
Stanford student, wrote the script
fora film in the 1995 festival.
"Stanford does have a long tra
dition of powerful Hollywood ex
ecutives, including Roger Gor
man, Gale Anne Hurd (who
worked on Terminator 2, The
Abyss, Armageddon) and a host of
others," I lalliday said.
Gurrent Stanford filmmakers
are well on their way to stardom,
and the 2002 Stanford Student
Film Festival is a promising start.
The event will be held in Cub
berley Auditorium on May 16,
May 17 and May 18 at 7:30 p.m.,
and is anticipated to feature ap
proximately 35 student films.
