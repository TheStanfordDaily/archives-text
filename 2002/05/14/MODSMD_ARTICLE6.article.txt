Stanford student filmmakers are saying
"Lights, camera, action!" across campus as
they direct and shoot their own movies for
the 2002 Stanford Student 112 ilm Festival,
which starts Thursday.
The Stanford Film Society showcases
films made by Stanford students. Hun
dreds of student actors, designers, crew
members, writers and directors have
put in countless hours to make the

event possible.
"It's shown me that despite the work,
the frustration and the lack of sleep, film
making is something I really love to do,"
said kalilah Robinson, a sophomore.
An open and flexible selection process
makes the films in ihe festival diverse in
their origin, message and style.
Films come from three areas: the stu

Students can also apply for film grants,
which are awarded by the society.
"The grants [are] chosen by a commit

[makes] the project feasible," said Emily
Mandelbaum, a member of the film grant
selection committee.

Eighteen film grants were awarded this
year, an award that includes funding for
production of the film, as well as use and
rental of club equipment.
I he open submissions option is new
this year. Anyone affiliated with Stanford,
including undergraduates, graduates and
alumni, can apply. I he open submissions
selection committee selected several of
these films for screening at the festival.
"I think that the festival is really inspir
ing. Anyone on campus can make a film if
they want to," Mandelbaum said.

The film festival traces its roots to 1995,
when the then-fledgling Stanford Film
Society showed one or two movies irregu
larly. The student film workshop was cre
ated in 1999, and the society began to buy
more equipment. In 2000, IS students
were chosen for the workshop out of a 50-
applicant pool, and the program contin
ued to giow.
"I'd say last year's festival was extreme
ly successful," Shimano said. "We had Iwo
