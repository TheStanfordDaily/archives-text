# Students dissatisfied with non-athlete exercise facilities

Even though Stanford has won
the Sears Directors (lup lor the past
seven years — the award given to
the most winning program in
NCAA Division I spoils — many
students feel that tlie University lags
in quality and availability of athletic
facilities for non-varsity athletes.
"As astounding as the varsity
program is at Stanford, there's not
a lot of attention paid to facilities for
non-varsity athletes," said junior
Catherine 1 hint.
II a student is looking to work
out indoors, use cardiovascular
machines or lift weights, the only
on-campus gyms open daily are
Arrillaga Family Sports Center,
the Ford Center and Tresidder
Fitness Center.
Tresidder is the most popular
not only because of its convenient
location, but also because some stu
dents describe working out along
side varsity athletes as intimidating.
Tresidder is the only gym where
varsity athletes do not train.
However, many students
complain that Tresidder has 1111-

desirable exercise conditions
and that the equipment is dirty,
old, and overused.
"Tresidder is an uncomfortable
environment," said senior An
drew I linderaker.
Many students refer to Tresid
der as "the fish bowl" because it is
encased by windows.
Since other on-campus gyms
close significantly earlier than
Tresidder, it leaves students who
are looking to work out at later
hours with few other options.
The manager of the Illness cen
ter, Fred Stephens, as well as the as
sistant athletic director in charge of
recreation, Sherry Posthumus, said
they are aware of these problems.
" There needs to be an increase
in facilities to meet the demands of
what we see, the demands of stu
dents," Stephens said.
According to Posthumus, the
Athletics Department does plan to
build a large recreational center for
general student use. Planning
should begin in two years and
when it does, there will be a student
committee to represent student
needs in the design of the center.

According to Posthumus, there
are numerous fitness opportunities
open to students in the meantime,
including new exercise classes,
pools at Roble Cym and Avery
Aquatic Center, numerous tennis
courts and plenty of outdoor space
lor running, jogging or biking.
Still, for some students, the lack
of quality indoor facilities during
their time at Stanford is unacceptable.
"I don't understand why they
don't have one nice gym where you
can go to just work out decently,"
said sophomore I lolly Thorsen.
For many fitness-conscious stu
dents, exercising is an important
part of their daily routine.
"No one really gets into Stan
ford just being a student — they're
a student in addition to being a mu
sician or an athlete," Hunt said.
Some students also attribute the
popularity of exercising here to the
stereotypically over-achieving na
ture of Stanford students. Senior
Ha'ane Masarotti attributes it to
"the desire to be perfect," while
coterminal student Veronica
Galerer attributes it to the influ
ence of "California culture."

Junior Jake Gardener and senior Darin Hansen took advantage of Tresidder Fitness's extended hours to work out
late last night. Some students feel that despite the late hours, Tresidder Fitness is an inadequate facility.
