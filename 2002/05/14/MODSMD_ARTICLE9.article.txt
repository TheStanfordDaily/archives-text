## The
						Stanford Daily Graduate-housing reforms a step in right direction 
### 
Published Since 1891

The University recently announced
several improvements to graduate
student housing, including build
ing more studio apartments, con
verting some double rooms to singles and in
cluding several off-campus apartment com
plexes in the on-campus lottery. We applaud
the University for taking these important
steps toward improving the quality of gradu
ate-student life on campus.
Housing has been the most serious com
plaint of graduate students for years. In Jan
uary, the Graduate Student Council released
a report of graduate quality of life at Stan
ford. Some of the most striking complaints
were rats in student housing, roomate in
compatibility, and students being forced to
live far from campus because of high rents.

Students also found it difficult to navigate
the various on-campus and off-campus lot
tery systems. For example, students were
forced to move between furnished and un
furnished apartments in various years,
meaning they might have to store their fur
niture at a high cost, not to mention the gen
eral hassle of moving every year.
The move to re-classify some doubles as
singles will help solve the problems created
when incompatible people live together.
Graduate students are adults and deserve
private space of their own.
We are also pleased that Stanford will contin
ue to subsidize off-campus housing next year for
some students. High area rents make living off
campus an unaffordable choice for many gradu
ate students. Although the $100 and $250

monthly subsidies do not make off-campus
housing inexpensive, they bring the units into
reach for many graduate students who other
wise would have to live far fi om campus to ob
tain affordable rents. Also, the new apartments
being opened in Escondido Village are a positive
sign. These are a more cost-effective means of
providing housing than subsidizing apartments
in Oak Creek and Sharon Green. This step will
reduce the number of graduate students who
want, but do not receive, on-campus housing.
And spending less on housing graduate
students means that spending on stipends
can be increased, or health-care premiums
can be reduced.
Stanford has an admirable record of pro
viding on-campus housing for its graduate
students. Compared with peer institutions,

many more students live on campus.
We strongly believe that the moves recently
announced will improve the quality of life for
graduate students on campus. In the past few
years, the total number of units of housing avail
able for graduate students has increased sub
stantially, but still has fallen short of demand.
Graduate students are important mem
bers of the Stanford community. They teach
classes, staff laboratories, publish research
and enhance the reputation of the Universi
ty. And yet — as employees with at least four
years of college-level training — they are
barely making a living wage.
We hope that these non-salary-based im
provements to graduate students compensa
tion package will improve the quality of grad
uate-student life.
