# RUNNING ON EMPTY
## Etiquette on the Row 
### 
It's springtime at Stanford. This is the
season for long walks in the Foothills,
pick-up soccer games on Wilbur
Field and frantic hours spent hud
dled in the computer cluster, cursing Axess
and its smug little stop sign while the min
utes left to state your housing preferences
erode like the sands of time.
The carefully planted wildflowers are in
bloom; so too are Draw Guides sprouting
like weeds across campus.
Fora lucky few, the Housing Draw will
mean moving out from the protective nest
of dorm life into a Row or Greek house.
Having had the privilege of living in a
Row house for two years, both as a resident
and a manager, I have noted with interest

students' varying reac
tions to the slight increase
in responsibility that a self
operated house requires.
The fact that almost all
of us live on campus all
four years is one of the
greatest assets of the Stan
ford community. Resi
dential Education can

promote tolerance, cross-cultural under
standing and lifelong friendships.
Unfortunately, it also fosters a weird
cycle of dependence, wherein someone
can leave school with a thorough grasp of
perestroika or nuclear fission but still re
gard an oven as if it were controlled by
witchcraft.
Intelligence has nothing to do with it. I
have seen individuals who are choosing be
tween medical school, law school and a
Ph.D. program handle a mop as though
they were wrestling an alligator. I have
watched people spill Froot Loops like con
fetti and then regard with genuine shock
the army of ants encircling the soda ma
chine the next day.
I am afraid, truly afraid, when I realize
that these people are going to be out on the
streets in a few years, and there's nothing
the system can do to stop it.
There are so many considerate little acts
that can mean the difference between a
happy community and a faction of irritat
ed housemates plotting your destruction.
This week, Running on Empty attempts
to dispel some of the myths of Row House
living. Clip 'n' save the following for your
future reference.
Myth: Name-brand cereal is a constitu
tionally protected right. Generic cereal is a
sawdust that the staff buys in bulk so that
they can use your money to go to Cancun.
Fact: There are not enough Lucky Charms
in all the Costcos in the world to keep up
with your ravenous demand. Marshmallow
Mateys provide the same marsh-tacular
g(X)dness at a fraction of the cost so that the
staff Can use your money to go to Cancun.
Myth: The single drop of Lactaid you
left in the carton will replicate in the fridge.
Soon the carton will once again be full of
tasty, lactose-free milk. Fact: Sorry to burst
your bubble, but once you finish empty

cartons should be thrown away. Also, your
mom is the Tooth Fairy.
Myth: If you leave wet clothes in the
washer long enough, they will eventually'
learn to dry, fluff and fold themselves.
Should anyone attempt to move them be
fore this process occurs, you should re
spond with huffy e-mails to the house list.
Fact: You are treated with thinly veiled
contempt by all. Also, about your "Aber
crombie Lacrosse Champions 1954" shirt:
You weren't really on that team. You are
such a phony.
Myth: There's no need to buy your own
detergent/shampoo/body cleanser. Just
"borrow" other people's. Fact: This is fine.
Fortunately for you, Satan encourages this
policy in hell.
Myth: 'I'he wall-mounted Dustbuster
conveniently located next to the cereal is
purely decorative. Should any crumbs
spill, you are powerless to clean them up.
Fact: Your mother made your bed for you
until you left for college.
Myth: Everyone likes Garbage / techno/
the "Rent" soundtrack. You should take it
upon yourself to act as house deejay by
playing your favorite tunes loudly, with the
door open, in a 17-hour continuous loop.
Fact: Your neighbors' friends refer to you
as "freaky Garbage/techno/Rent guy."
Myth: That chain letter about hugs
from your cousin's roommate is adorable.
You should forward it to the house list.
Fact: No one played with you in preschool.
Myth: The yellow M&Ms are signifi
cantly tastier. You should scrounge
through the jar in the open kitchen to get
them all, even if it means touching every
other chocolately morsel with your grubby
paws in the process. Fact: You are single
handedly responsible for the house virus,
theToyon Plague and the Black Death.
Myth: Sharing your personal life with
your neighbors is a good way for them to
get to know you better. If you are going to
have a long, emotional, relationship
defining conversation with your
girl/boyfriend, you should do it in the
hallway on your cordless phone. Extra
points for tears, shouting or references to
your significant other as "snuggy bear."
Fact: The third floor has a pool on how
long you two will last. Also, you are known
as "freaky phone girl."
Myth: In case of nuclear holocaust or a
plague that renders the kitchen unusable,
you should keep a sizeable stockpile of
plates, cups and utensils in your room. At
mealtimes, however, you should vocifer
ously complain about the lack of plates,
cups and utensils in the dining room. Fact:
When you are old you will live alone and
keep children's baseballs when they land in
your yard.
Myth: Don't worry. The neighbors can't
hear. Fact: They can.

It's springtime at Stanford. This is the
season for long walks in the Foothills,
pick-up soccer games on Wilbur
Field and frantic hours spent hud
dled in the computer cluster, cursing Axess
and its smug little stop sign while the min
utes left to state your housing preferences
erode like the sands of time.
The carefully planted wildflowers are in
bloom; so too are Draw Guides sprouting
like weeds across campus.
Fora lucky few, the Housing Draw will
mean moving out from the protective nest
of dorm life into a Row or Greek house.
Having had the privilege of living in a
Row house for two years, both as a resident
and a manager, I have noted with interest

students' varying reac
tions to the slight increase
in responsibility that a self
operated house requires.
The fact that almost all
of us live on campus all
four years is one of the
greatest assets of the Stan
ford community. Resi
dential Education can

promote tolerance, cross-cultural under
standing and lifelong friendships.
Unfortunately, it also fosters a weird
cycle of dependence, wherein someone
can leave school with a thorough grasp of
perestroika or nuclear fission but still re
gard an oven as if it were controlled by
witchcraft.
Intelligence has nothing to do with it. I
have seen individuals who are choosing be
tween medical school, law school and a
Ph.D. program handle a mop as though
they were wrestling an alligator. I have
watched people spill Froot Loops like con
fetti and then regard with genuine shock
the army of ants encircling the soda ma
chine the next day.
I am afraid, truly afraid, when I realize
that these people are going to be out on the
streets in a few years, and there's nothing
the system can do to stop it.
There are so many considerate little acts
that can mean the difference between a
happy community and a faction of irritat
ed housemates plotting your destruction.
This week, Running on Empty attempts
to dispel some of the myths of Row House
living. Clip 'n' save the following for your
future reference.
Myth: Name-brand cereal is a constitu
tionally protected right. Generic cereal is a
sawdust that the staff buys in bulk so that
they can use your money to go to Cancun.
Fact: There are not enough Lucky Charms
in all the Costcos in the world to keep up
with your ravenous demand. Marshmallow
Mateys provide the same marsh-tacular
g(X)dness at a fraction of the cost so that the
staff Can use your money to go to Cancun.
Myth: The single drop of Lactaid you
left in the carton will replicate in the fridge.
Soon the carton will once again be full of
tasty, lactose-free milk. Fact: Sorry to burst
your bubble, but once you finish empty

cartons should be thrown away. Also, your
mom is the Tooth Fairy.
Myth: If you leave wet clothes in the
washer long enough, they will eventually'
learn to dry, fluff and fold themselves.
Should anyone attempt to move them be
fore this process occurs, you should re
spond with huffy e-mails to the house list.
Fact: You are treated with thinly veiled
contempt by all. Also, about your "Aber
crombie Lacrosse Champions 1954" shirt:
You weren't really on that team. You are
such a phony.
Myth: There's no need to buy your own
detergent/shampoo/body cleanser. Just
"borrow" other people's. Fact: This is fine.
Fortunately for you, Satan encourages this
