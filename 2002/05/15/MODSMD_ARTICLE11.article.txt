# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Cancer walks no substitute for prevention 
### JESSICA WILLIAMS GUEST COLUMNIST 
As a longtime participant in events like
the American Cancer Society's Relay for
Life and the Susan G. Komen Race for
the Cure, I would normally be thrilled to
read about so many Stanford students
rallying together to promote cancer
awareness at the recent Relay for Life in
Palo Alto.
But after years of faithfully donning my
oversized Relay for Life T-shirt, securing
the pink breast-cancer-awareness ribbon
to my cap and walking proudly for the
cure, I have felt my enthusiasm for these
events wane as 1 discovered why major
cancer organizations have largely ignored
the subject of cancer prevention.
Although there is mounting evidence
that synthetic chemicals like the ones
found in pesticides and other industrial
products can induce cancerous tumors,
our nation's leading cancer organizations
have placed little emphasis on finding and
eliminating the causes of cancer.
When industries use synthetic chemi
cals like PVC in the production of plastics
or bleach, these substances, called
organochlorines, are diffused in the envi
ronment through the air, the ground
water and the food chain, eventually caus
ing humans to ingest these substances.
Even organochlorines that were
banned over 25 years ago like the pesticide
DDT still pose a carcinogenic threat to hu

mans because these chemicals can remain
in the environment for decades. In recent
years, studies have implicated
organochlorines in the creation of tumors
because*-the toxic chemicals adhere to
breast and fatty tissues and accumulate in
the human body over time.
And although the World Health Orga
nization recently announced that 80 per
cent of all cancers can be attributed to en
vironmental contaminants like these, or
ganizations like the American Cancer So
ciety allocate little funding to the study of
synthetic chemicals and their carcinogenic
effects on humans.
But after discovering that past and pre
sent members on the American Cancer
Society's board of trustees have had ties to
several chemical industries that produce
organochlorines, the lack of research on
environmental contaminants isn't surpris
ing. As recently as 1999, David Bethune,
the vice president of the herbicide manu
facturing company American Cyanamid,
served on the American Cancer Society's
board of trustees.
This massive conflict of interest may ex
plain why the society has a history of op
posing legislation that would eliminate ex
posure to organochlorines. In 1958, the
society protested against the Delaney
Clause, a law proposed to ban food pesti
cides that were carcinogenic to animals,
because the legislation "would severely
limit the use of valuable pesticides and
food additives and .. . probably increase

food costs."
In 1978, the society contended that
regulations on hair dyes that caused
mammary tumors in rodents weren't
needed. Even as recently as this month,
the society has continued to insist that
organochlorine "concentrations in
[human] tissue are low," despite the nu
merous reports like New York Universi
ty's Women Health Study that found sig
nificantly high levels of DDT in women
with breast tumors.
On its Web site, the society reiterates its
longtime viewpoint that 'the minimal
risks [pesticides] pose are greatly over
shadowed by the health benefits 0f...
foods from plant sources," despite in
creased warnings from medical re
searchers that these chemicals may be re
sponsible for rising cancer rates.
Walking in memory of cancer victims
and running to raise money for cancer re
search are empowering and worthwhile
activities, but don't pledge blind allegiance
to major cancer organizations without first
understanding the conflict of interest that
exists among many of these groups.
While participating in these events, it's
important to remember that wearing a T
shirt or ribbon won't prevent loved ones
from contracting cancer, but eliminating
the causes of cancer will.
