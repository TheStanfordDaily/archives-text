Stanford chronology available
at Bookstore
I followed with great interest the re
cent column by alumnus Pat Shea, the re
sponding letter from President Emeritus
Richard Lyman and Shea's latest letter, in
which suggests that a chronology of the
University might be placed on a Web site.
I have written to Shea and sent him a

copy of the chronology published in 2001
by the Stanford Historical Society. The
Daily's readers should be aware that this
detailed and richly illustrated 169-page
book, titled "A Chronology of Stanford
University and its Founders," is available
at the Stanford Bookstore.
