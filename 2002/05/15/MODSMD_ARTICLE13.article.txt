## Israel not at fault for self-inflicted tragedy of Palestinian refugees 
### STANFORD ISRAEL ALLIANCE 
The refugee crisis resulting from the
1948 Arab-Israeli War is known among the
Arabs as al-Nakba. However, Arab at
tempts to portray themselves as the inno
cent victims and the Jews af the aggressors
belie history. There was not a single Jewish
village captured by the Arabs whose resi
dents were not killed or forced to flee. Not
a single Jew remained in territory held by
the .Arabs.
The Arabs refused any compromise and
rejected the United Nations partition plan.
On May 15, 1948, Azzam Pasha, Secretary
General of the Arab League, made the Arab
intentions unambiguously plain to the
British Broadcasting Company: "This will
be a war of extermination and a momentous
massacre which will be spoken of like the
Mongolian massacres and the Crusades."
Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri Said de
clared: "We will smash the country with
our guns and obliterate every place the
Jews seek shelter in."

The United Nations blamed the Arabs
for the violence. On Feb. 16, 1948, a U.N.
Commission reported to the Security
Council: "Powerful Arab interests, both in
side and outside Palestine, are defying the
resolution of the General Assembly and are
engaged in a deliberate effort to alter by
force the settlement envisaged therein."
The flight of refugees was overwhelm
ingly due to a natural fear of war, exacer
bated by Arab propaganda, and to orders
from the Higher Arab Executive.
The Economist reported on Oct. 2,
1948: "Various factors influenced [the
Arabs'] decision to seek safety in flight.
There is but little doubt that the most po
tent of the factors were the announcements
made over the air by the Higher Arab Ex
ecutive, urging the Arabs to quit. . . . It was
clearly intimated that those Arabs who re
mained in Haifa and accepted Jewish pro
tection would be regarded as renegades."
Regardless of its self-inflicted nature, al~
Nakba was a great tragedy. However, a far
greater tragedy has been the intentional

perpetuation of the suffering of Palestinian
refugees for political gain. Ralph Garroway,
head of UNRWA, the relief organization es
tablished to help the Palestinian refugees,
stated in 1958: "The Arab Suites do not
want to solve the refugee problem. They
want to keep it as an open sore, as an affront
to the United Nations and as a weapon
against Israel. Arab leaders don't give a
damn whether the refugees live or die."
With bitter honesty, Abu Mazen, con
sidered number two in the Palestinian hi
erarchy, accused his brethren in March
1976: "The Arab armies entered Palestine
to protect the Palestinians — but, instead,
they abandoned them, forced them to em
igrate and to leave their homeland, and
threw them into prisons similar to the ghet
tos in which the Jews used to live."
The Palestinians are hardly the only
refugees of the mid-20th century. Alter
World War 11, Germany absorbed 12 mil
lion refugees from Poland and Czechoslo
vakia. After the partition of the Indian sub
continent — supported by the Arabs so as

to create Muslim Pakistan—ls million
refugees crossed the borders from both
sides. In 1950, Turkey absorbed 150,000
Turks from Bulgaria.
Not least, Israel absorbed some 600,000
of the over 800,000 Jews forced to flee from
Arab lands after the founding of Israel. Is
rael's current defense minister was born in
Iraq, its finance minister in Tunisia and its
justice minister in Morocco. The Jewish
refugees from Arab lands were absorbed
by a Jewish state further away geographi
cally, culturally and linguistically than the
Arabs of Palestine with respect to their
Arab neighbors.
The Arab demand fora right of return
is code for the destruction of Israel. It is im
possible to revert the situation today back
to 1948 as if brutal wars of attempted anni
hilation never occurred. Such logic implies
that if the Arabs win a war they get to kill
the Jewish Israelis — and if they lose, they
get to restart the clock.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Muhammad
Salah al-Din affirmed this logic in 1949: "It

is well-known and understood that the
Arabs, in demanding the return of the
refugees to Palestine, mean their return as
masters of the Homeland and not as slaves.
With a greater clarity, they mean the liqui
dation of the State of Israel."
In 1957, the Refugee Conference at
Homs, Syria, passed a resolution stating:
"Any discussion aimed at a solution of the
Palestine problem which will not be based
on ensuring the refugees' right to annihi
late Israel will be regarded as a desec ration
of the Arab people and an act of treason."
Egyptian President Gamel Abdel Nass
er stated in 1961: "If refugees return to Is
rael, Israel will cease to exist."
While we share in the grief of the Pales
tinian refugees, we urge those students
claiming to support the Palestinian cause to
be frank and honest in their assessments.
If you sincerely care about the
refugees, you will stop using them as a po
litical club and join us in fighting fora re
alistic and peaceful resolution to the Arab-
Israeli conflict.
