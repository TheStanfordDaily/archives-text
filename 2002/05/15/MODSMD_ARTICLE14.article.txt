# Israel to blame for expulsion of Palestinians from their land in 1948
## 
### COALITION FOR JUSTICE IN ISRAEL / PALESTINE 
Today, the Coalition for Justice in Is
rael/Palestine at Stanford invites all stu
dents, faculty and staff to attend an educa
tional gathering to learn about al-Nakba,
the "catastrophe" of 1948, in which Pales
tinians lost their homeland.
In light of the ongoing violence in Israel
and Palestine and America's recurring in
volvement in the region, it is more impor
tant than ever for the Stanford community
to learn about the historical origins of the
conflict as a way of promoting dialogue and
understanding.
One of the earliest and most enduring
slogans of the Zionist movement with re
gards to its ambitions in Palestine ("the
Land of Israel") was:"A Land without a
People fora People without a Land." His
torically, we know this was far from the case.
At the beginning of the 20th century, Pales
tine was home to approximately 500,000
indigenous Arabs and 60,000 Jews.

The Zionist movement and subsequent
ly the state of Israel's deliberate marginal
ization of the physical presence and politi
cal legitimacy of the large Arab population
in historic Palestine has, in large part,
shaped the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In
deed, this problem of historical ignorance
and political myopia continues to obstruct
efforts to achieve a just peace and plagues
American commentary and analysis on the
current conflict.
In order to understand the origins of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, we must keep a
few critical historical facts in mind: The
United Nations adopted Resolution 181 on
Nov. 29, 1947, partitioning British Manda
tor)' Palestine, from the Jordan River in the
east to the Mediterranean Sea in the west,
into two states — one Jewish and one Arab.
Historical sources state that in 1947,
Palestine was populated with approximate
ly 1.2 million Arabs and 600,000 Jews. De
spite this population ratio of 2:1, and despite
the fact that the distribution of land owner
ship was 92 percent to 94 percent Palestini

an Arab and 6 percent to 8 percent Jewish,
the U.N. partition plan called fora Jewish
state on 56 percent of historic Palestine and
a Palestinian Arab state on 44 percent. Ac
cording to the U.N. partition plan, there
fore, a significant amount of Arab-owned
land was to be designated as part of the Jew
ish state. As such, it is hardly surprising that
Palestinian Arabs at the time rejected the
loss of significant chunks of their homeland.
Thus, rising out of this context, a civil
war was waged between Jews and Palestini
an Arabs from November 1947 until May
1948. After the State of Israel was unilater
ally declared on May 15, 1948, a regional
war ensued between the newly established
state and the Arab armies of Syria, Egypt,
Jordan and Iraq. .Already in 1938, future
Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion
had written: "[I am] satisfied with part of
the country, but on the basis of the assump
tion that after we build up a strong force fol
lowing the establishment of the state — we
will abolish the partition of the country, and
we will expand to the whole Land of Israel."

By the final ceasefire in July 1949, Israel
had forcibly acquired approximately 78
percent of Mandate Palestine. Egypt and
Jordan controlled the remaining parts of
historical Palestine, and a Palestinian state
never materialized.
During the course of the hostilities, over
418 Palestinian villages were depopulated,
creating a refugee problem of some
700,000 Palestinians, who were either
forcibly expelled or fled out of fear to what
they thought would be a temporary stay in
Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan or Iraq. In
total, over 250 of these Palestinian villages
were then repopulated with Jewish immi
grants, and all traces of these villages' Pales
tinian pasts were completely erased.
This narrative of the war of 1947 to 1949
has come to light thanks to the pioneering
empirical scholarship of the so-called "new
Israeli historians" (Benny Morris, Avi
Shlaim, Simha Flapan, Ilan Pappe), who
have debunked myths about the pristine
nature of Israel's founding.
Despite the emergence of this critical

body of history, the Palestinian experience
of loss, dispersion and exile has remained a
taboo topic in contemporary American po
litical culture. Indeed, much as the original
landscape of Palestine has been destroyed,
re-mapped and renamed, so too has a grad
ual process of historical erasure and political
"re-education" rendered any attempts to
study and commemorate Palestinian histo
ry, culture and identity illegitimate.
There has been little space afforded the
Palestinian people to affirm their unique
cultural identity, let alone to commemorate
the tragic loss of their homes, property and
homeland set into place by the events of
1947-49.
Recent remarks by House Majority
Leader Dick Armey in a televised interview
condoning further "ethnic cleansing" of the
Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza
Strip confirm the necessity to educate
Americans about the destructive history of
1948. There's an old adage that those who
don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
Let it not be so.
