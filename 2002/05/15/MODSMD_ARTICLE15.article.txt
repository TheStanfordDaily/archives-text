## Lakers-Spurs matchup proves life just isn't fair 
### 
It was sickening to watch
and you just couldn't help
but feel bad for them. One
team isn't supposed to be
continually victimized and tor
tured like that.
Kobe Bryant is not supposed to
grab rebounds in the lane and put
them back up left-handed.
Tim Duncan is not supposed to
be relegated to a desperation fall-

away jumper that
had all the aes
thetic beauty of
the love child of
the Predator and
Latrell Sprewell.
But such is life
and so goes the se
ries for the San
Antonio Spurs as
they undisputed-

ly replaced the aforementioned
Sprewell as the No. 1 choke artists
in the NBA.
If life were tail, the San Antonio
Spurs would have swept the Lak
ers in this series, solidly outplaying
the Lakers for 75 percent of the
total game time.
But life isn't fair.
Hollywood studios have actu
ally green-lighted multiple
movies starring Shaquille
O'Neal, Kobe Bryant took pop
star Brandy to his prom, and Rick
Fox gets to share a bed with
Vanessa Williams every night.
I think that life wanders into
San Antonio and decides right
then and there that the Spurs will
not hold a 10-point lead in the
waning minutes of a must-win
home game.
I think that life walks by the
Alamo and thinks to himself "Re
member this, bitch," and sudden
ly David Robinson's back stiffens
up like Thomas Jefferson on Fa
ther's Day.
There really is just no other way
to rationalize the Spurs' complete
ineptitude when it has come down

to crunch time in this series.
Their performance (or lack
thereof), will undoubtedly go
down in the sports annals as one
the worst clutch performances of
all-time. A huge marquee will be
erected in the Hall of Shame,
right next to the Buffalo Bills,
the Utah Jazz, and the entire
state of Ohio.
If the Spurs were Stanford stu
dents, they would have the best
grades in their class, be dating the
hottest girls, and have a job offer
with a prestigious firm in hand
— until Spring Quarter.
They would then miserably fail
each of their finals in embarrass
ing fashion, lose their girlfriends
due to an onset of incurable impo
tence, and the firm would turn out
to be Arthur Andersen.
If the Spurs were the presi
dent, the country would experi
ence unprecedented economic
growth, domestic affairs would
be at all-time highs, and trade lib
eralization would be imminent
— until times got tough.
The country would then be at
tacked by terrorists, the economy
would deteriorate into a reces
sion, and we would try to counter
that by slapping ridiculous tariffs
on things like steel. Hmmm,
that's funny, I don't remember
voting for President Malik.
All joking aside, you really
can't help but feel bad for the
Spurs. This is the ultimate good
guy collection of superstar ath
letes that you will find on the
planet. A team that reaches out to
its community, a team that puts
personal egos aside for the good
of the organization.
A team of guys that actually like
each other, appreciate their good
fortune, and still perform at con
sistently high levels.
But as Kobe's rebound and put-


Ryan Stewart
back in game four sealed yet an
other come-from-behind victory
for the Lakers, the good guys were
forced once again to hang their
heads in shame and disbelief.
Rick Fox will go home to
Vanessa, Kobe will go home and
lay on his pile of money and tell
himself how good he is, Shaq can
start filming his next Burger
King commercial, and life will
dance around.
I think that life needs to give
the Spurs a break. It has already
forced them to play in the
armpit of Texas and cursed
them to endure a long stint of
Dennis Rodman.

The one championship the or
ganization has to its credit came
during the lockout-shortened sea
son three years ago, which many
people, including Lakers coach
Phil Jackson, belittle as a meaning
less fluke.
The Spurs are a good team with
quality people.
They work hard, play with
passion and selflessness, and
they do it without the Holly
wood enticements enjoyed by
their opponents. And they sup
port NAFTA.

Ryan Stewart is a junior majoring in
economics, and he cannot fathom why
Vanessa Williams is married to Rick
Fox, the guy isn 7 even good. He can be
