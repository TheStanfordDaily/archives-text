# Fallen Husky Curtis Williams passes away
## 
### MATT BABIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A year ago next week, a friend
of mine from high school was
riding a motorcycle up in the
Colorado with his father. It
was a Sunday during his senior year —
just like one of t hose days that I'm sure
most of you remember from your se
nior years, where the sun shines down
on you and your future and you don't
have a care in the world.
It was like that, just like that, except
for one thing. An accident. A painted
line stripe that was slick on a tire, a
curve, bad timing.
And that's all.
I found myself thinking of my friend
all week trying to decide what to write
for this column, a way to explain safety
Curtis Williams, the senior from Wash
ington who passed away May 6, last
Monday. And then I came across a
quote of his, on the Husky athletics
Web site.
"It was an accident," he said. "Acci
dents happen."
It happened on a cold, rainy Octo
ber day. So rainy, in fact, that not many
Stanford students came out to watch.
Williams came up to tackle Stanford ju
nior running back Kerry Carter. The
two players hit helmets and Williams
was paralyzed from the neck down,
with no voluntary muscle control.
An accident.
It's a tragic story — there's simply
no getting around that. But like most
tragic stories, it's filled with heroes.
Take your pick.
Look at Williams' teammates.
They stuck it out through the rest of
the season, not knowing if their team
mate and friend would even get out of
the hospital. They won the Rose
Bowl, dedicating the victory to
Williams. But I'd say that even more
than that, more than the quotes they
gave to reporters, was that they re

membered that Williams had been,
and still was, their friend.
They did simple things like call
him on the phone.
"I enjoy talking to them," he said
in an interview once. "I like to stay
in touch."
And look at Williams' older
brother, David. Me has a job. a wife,
two daughters, and two elderly par
ents to take care of. But he loved his
brother. Loved him enough to take
him into his house and supply 24-
hour care for him.
"If it wasn't my brother, yeah, I'd
think this was a lot of work," he said.
"But it's my brother, so I don't really
think about that."
You want to look somewhere closer
to home?
Look at Carter. Everyone knows
that this was an accident. Everyone
knows that no part of it was his fault.
It's still a lot to carry. It's a lot to
think about.
"Inches decide stuff like that,"
Carter said in a Sports Illustrated in
terview last May. "That's what helped
me come to terms with it. It could have
been the other way around."
Carter deserves respect for the way
he's handled the situation.
Don't believe me? Ask Brad Gaines.
A former fullback for Vanderbilt, he
was involved in a play just like this on
October 28, 1989 — exactly 11 years
before Williams.
He collided with Chucky Mullins,
a defensive back for Ole Miss.
Mullins was paralyzed instantly. The
experience was enough to make
Gaines give up football. It was hard
for him to sleep.
That changed a little when he went
to the Ole Miss locker room after their
victory that year in the Liberty Bowl.
He walked through a hallway of Ole
Miss fans, their eyes on him the whole
