# Fallen Husky Curtis Williams passes away
## 
### MATT BABIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A year ago next week, a friend
of mine from high school was
riding a motorcycle up in the
Colorado with his father. It
was a Sunday during his senior year —
just like one of t hose days that I'm sure
most of you remember from your se
nior years, where the sun shines down
on you and your future and you don't
have a care in the world.
It was like that, just like that, except
for one thing. An accident. A painted
line stripe that was slick on a tire, a
curve, bad timing.
And that's all.
I found myself thinking of my friend
all week trying to decide what to write
for this column, a way to explain safety
Curtis Williams, the senior from Wash
ington who passed away May 6, last
Monday. And then I came across a
quote of his, on the Husky athletics
Web site.
"It was an accident," he said. "Acci
dents happen."
It happened on a cold, rainy Octo
ber day. So rainy, in fact, that not many
Stanford students came out to watch.
Williams came up to tackle Stanford ju
nior running back Kerry Carter. The
two players hit helmets and Williams
was paralyzed from the neck down,
with no voluntary muscle control.
An accident.
It's a tragic story — there's simply
no getting around that. But like most
tragic stories, it's filled with heroes.
Take your pick.
Look at Williams' teammates.
They stuck it out through the rest of
the season, not knowing if their team
mate and friend would even get out of
the hospital. They won the Rose
Bowl, dedicating the victory to
Williams. But I'd say that even more
than that, more than the quotes they
gave to reporters, was that they re

membered that Williams had been,
and still was, their friend.
They did simple things like call
him on the phone.
"I enjoy talking to them," he said
in an interview once. "I like to stay
in touch."
And look at Williams' older
brother, David. Me has a job. a wife,
two daughters, and two elderly par
ents to take care of. But he loved his
brother. Loved him enough to take
him into his house and supply 24-
hour care for him.
"If it wasn't my brother, yeah, I'd
think this was a lot of work," he said.
"But it's my brother, so I don't really
think about that."
You want to look somewhere closer
to home?
Look at Carter. Everyone knows
that this was an accident. Everyone
knows that no part of it was his fault.
It's still a lot to carry. It's a lot to
think about.
"Inches decide stuff like that,"
Carter said in a Sports Illustrated in
terview last May. "That's what helped
me come to terms with it. It could have
been the other way around."
Carter deserves respect for the way
he's handled the situation.
Don't believe me? Ask Brad Gaines.
A former fullback for Vanderbilt, he
was involved in a play just like this on
October 28, 1989 — exactly 11 years
before Williams.
He collided with Chucky Mullins,
a defensive back for Ole Miss.
Mullins was paralyzed instantly. The
experience was enough to make
Gaines give up football. It was hard
for him to sleep.
That changed a little when he went
to the Ole Miss locker room after their
victory that year in the Liberty Bowl.
He walked through a hallway of Ole
Miss fans, their eyes on him the whole
way, to speak to Mullins.
"The first thing he said to
me," Gaines recalls, "was that it
was not my fault. He saw that I
was hurting and would not let
me feel that way."
Nevertheless, Gainetf travels
1,200 miles a year to spend time
with the Mullins family, driving to
their house every Oct. 28, every
Christmas Day, and every May 6,
the day Mullins, just like Williams,
passed away.
We all know that injuries hap
pen in sports. We know that acci
dents happen. In the past few years,
unfortunately, college athletics
have seen more high-profile inci
dents. Last winter college athletic
teams had to look at the risk in trav
eling to games following the Okla
homa State men's basketball team's
plane crash. Earlier this year a
Penn State pole vaulter died after
a fall. Last August the sports world
was shocked by running back

Rashidi Wheeler's collapse on the
Northwestern practice field.
Athletics, for all the joy and en
tertainment we take from them,
involve definite risks.
And as athletes push them
selves to he faster, stronger, and
go higher than the competition,
the risks increase.
This is not an issue con lined to
college sports. We hear the awful
stories of a Little League pitcher
struck with a line drive, we know of
professional athletes who suffer
fluke injuries that change the way
they live their lives.
But little kids still want to play
Little League. Stanford is still filled
with students who want to train for
months to compete for the Cardi
nal, some of whom plan to contin
ue to play professionally.
Why? Because they've evaluat
ed the risks and they just love the
game too much to stay away. For
them, the game is worth the risk.
It was easy to see Williams' love
for the game, according to his
brother. It was an emotion that got
even stronger after his accident.
"He still loves football," his

brother J. D. said in an interview last
September, alter the three brothers
returned from a Fresno State-Ore
gon State game. "Irately he's been
talking about doing some scouting,
maybe, evaluating talent."
His daytime nurse, Clark Ls
pinoza, saw more to the heart of it.
"When he's talking about foot
ball, his spirit comes out."
It's a spirit that a lot of people
will miss. J.D. and David. Kymber
ly, Williams' six year old daughter.
1 lis teammates.
They're looking for consola
tion now. Some find it in the ben
efit fund that was set up in his
name and has received tremen
dous donations. Some find it in
the smile that beams from his
photos. Some find it in the fact
that he made it back to Washing
ton for the spring game, that he
got one more birthday.
But the final consolation, for
most, is in their mind. In believing
that now Curtis can play like he
used to.
"He's somewhere right now,"
brother David said, "and he's run
ning, fast."

the risks increase.
This is not an issue con lined to
college sports. We hear the awful
stories of a Little League pitcher
struck with a line drive, we know of
professional athletes who suffer
fluke injuries that change the way
they live their lives.
But little kids still want to play
Little League. Stanford is still filled
with students who want to train for
months to compete for the Cardi
nal, some of whom plan to contin
ue to play professionally.
Why? Because they've evaluat
ed the risks and they just love the
game too much to stay away. For
them, the game is worth the risk.
It was easy to see Williams' love
for the game, according to his
brother. It was an emotion that got
even stronger after his accident.
"He still loves football," his

brother J. D. said in an interview last
September, alter the three brothers
returned from a Fresno State-Ore
gon State game. "Irately he's been
talking about doing some scouting,
maybe, evaluating talent."
His daytime nurse, Clark Ls
pinoza, saw more to the heart of it.
"When he's talking about foot
ball, his spirit comes out."
It's a spirit that a lot of people
will miss. J.D. and David. Kymber
ly, Williams' six year old daughter.
1 lis teammates.
They're looking for consola
tion now. Some find it in the ben
efit fund that was set up in his
name and has received tremen
dous donations. Some find it in
the smile that beams from his
photos. Some find it in the fact
that he made it back to Washing
ton for the spring game, that he
got one more birthday.
But the final consolation, for
most, is in their mind. In believing
that now Curtis can play like he
used to.
"He's somewhere right now,"
brother David said, "and he's run
ning, fast."
A year ago next week, a friend
of mine from high school was
riding a motorcycle up in the
Colorado with his father. It
was a Sunday during his senior year —
just like one of t hose days that I'm sure
most of you remember from your se
nior years, where the sun shines down
on you and your future and you don't
have a care in the world.
It was like that, just like that, except
for one thing. An accident. A painted
line stripe that was slick on a tire, a
curve, bad timing.
And that's all.
I found myself thinking of my friend
all week trying to decide what to write
for this column, a way to explain safety
Curtis Williams, the senior from Wash
ington who passed away May 6, last
Monday. And then I came across a
quote of his, on the Husky athletics
Web site.
"It was an accident," he said. "Acci
dents happen."
It happened on a cold, rainy Octo
ber day. So rainy, in fact, that not many
Stanford students came out to watch.
Williams came up to tackle Stanford ju
nior running back Kerry Carter. The
two players hit helmets and Williams
was paralyzed from the neck down,
with no voluntary muscle control.
An accident.
It's a tragic story — there's simply
no getting around that. But like most
tragic stories, it's filled with heroes.
Take your pick.
Look at Williams' teammates.
They stuck it out through the rest of
the season, not knowing if their team
mate and friend would even get out of
the hospital. They won the Rose
Bowl, dedicating the victory to
Williams. But I'd say that even more
than that, more than the quotes they
gave to reporters, was that they re

membered that Williams had been,
and still was, their friend.
They did simple things like call
him on the phone.
"I enjoy talking to them," he said
in an interview once. "I like to stay
in touch."
And look at Williams' older
brother, David. Me has a job. a wife,
two daughters, and two elderly par
ents to take care of. But he loved his
brother. Loved him enough to take
him into his house and supply 24-
hour care for him.
"If it wasn't my brother, yeah, I'd
think this was a lot of work," he said.
"But it's my brother, so I don't really
think about that."
You want to look somewhere closer
to home?
Look at Carter. Everyone knows
that this was an accident. Everyone
knows that no part of it was his fault.
It's still a lot to carry. It's a lot to
think about.
"Inches decide stuff like that,"
Carter said in a Sports Illustrated in
terview last May. "That's what helped
me come to terms with it. It could have
been the other way around."
Carter deserves respect for the way
he's handled the situation.
Don't believe me? Ask Brad Gaines.
A former fullback for Vanderbilt, he
was involved in a play just like this on
October 28, 1989 — exactly 11 years
before Williams.
He collided with Chucky Mullins,
a defensive back for Ole Miss.
Mullins was paralyzed instantly. The
experience was enough to make
Gaines give up football. It was hard
for him to sleep.
That changed a little when he went
to the Ole Miss locker room after their
victory that year in the Liberty Bowl.
He walked through a hallway of Ole
Miss fans, their eyes on him the whole
way, to speak to Mullins.
"The first thing he said to
me," Gaines recalls, "was that it
was not my fault. He saw that I
was hurting and would not let
me feel that way."
Nevertheless, Gainetf travels
1,200 miles a year to spend time
with the Mullins family, driving to
their house every Oct. 28, every
Christmas Day, and every May 6,
the day Mullins, just like Williams,
passed away.
We all know that injuries hap
pen in sports. We know that acci
dents happen. In the past few years,
unfortunately, college athletics
have seen more high-profile inci
dents. Last winter college athletic
teams had to look at the risk in trav
eling to games following the Okla
homa State men's basketball team's
plane crash. Earlier this year a
Penn State pole vaulter died after
a fall. Last August the sports world
was shocked by running back

Rashidi Wheeler's collapse on the
Northwestern practice field.
Athletics, for all the joy and en
tertainment we take from them,
involve definite risks.
And as athletes push them
selves to he faster, stronger, and
go higher than the competition,
the risks increase.
