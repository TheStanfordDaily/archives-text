# Card begins regional play in Fresno
## 
### DEBORAH SPLANSKY STAFF WRITER 
The day of the postseason se
lection show is always one of
guessing and speculation —
who will be the top seeds? Where
will Stanford go?
This year nobody guessed
right.

SOFTBALL
Thursday: No. 8 Stanford
vs. No. 1/ Pacific, 2:30 p.m.,
Fresno, Calif., NCAA Regional
First Round

The entire softball communi
ty was shocked Sunday evening
when it learned of the Regional
tournament bracketing and
host locations.
For the first time since the
NCAA softball tournament added
regional rounds, not one Pacific 10
Conference softball squad will be
hosting any games.
While the No. 8 Cardinal team
(43-18) will be making just a short
trip down to Fresno State, the No.
1 UCLA Bruins and the No. 2 Ari
zona Wildcats, will be forced to
journey to South Carolina and
Minnesota, respectively.
No one could have ever guessed
these hosting sites because never
before have the third and fourth
seeded teams been given the great
advantage of playing the regional
at their home stadium.
Stanford's assignment, al
though closer to home than most
other Pac-10 teams, promises to be
a challenging one, as it is accompa
nied by teams that have been ar
guably "low-balled."
"We are in the toughest region
al in the country," said head coach
John Rittman. "It is going to make
it interesting. Everyone there will
need to play their best softball."
In fact, the regional tourna
ment that will be played at No. 14
Fresno State's stadium resembles
greatly the regional tournament

in which seniors Jessica Men
do/a, Sarah Beeson and Robin
Walker competed during their
fresh mai 1 cam paign s.
Both Fresno State and Pacific
were participants in the 1999
regional tournament, which
was also played at the home of
the Bulldogs.
The Cardinal's season was cut
short that year as it went down
with two straight losses to Pacific
and Fresno State.
This year, the seniors are
going to do everything they can
to avoid a repeat of the 1999 sea
son's end.
"For the three of us that went to
the regional tournament three
years ago this weekend will be
good fora little redemption," first
baseman Beeson said. "It will give
us a chance to show that the first
year was a fluke."
Stanford enters the tournament
as the region's No. 2 seed just be
hind regional top seed Cal State-
Fullerton (50-11), ranked No. 9 in
the country. The Titans are an all
too-familiar face, as the Cardinal
and Cal State-Fullerton have gone
head-to-head three times already
this season.
Stanford has beaten the Titans
in all three meetings and is eager to
do so again this weekend.
In fact, the NCAA's commit
ment to try and arrange tourna
ments that allow for competition
between unfamiliar teams was
completely disregarded when one
looks at the field at the regional in
Fresno State.
Stanford has played Pacific
twice and has battled Cal State-
Fullerton, California and Fresno
State three times already this sea
son. The lone squad that the Car
dinal has not squared off against
is No. 6 seed Evansville (34-25).
The third-seeded California
Bears were one of the biggest sur
prises of the entire selection show.
The Bears were ranked fifth
in the nation going into these

lection show, and were subse
quently dealt quite a blow when
labeled as a No. 3 seed at the re
gional tournament.
The season record is currently
tipped in favor of the Bears, who
have beaten Stanford twice in
three meetings during the confer
ence season.
Stanford and California are also
the only two teams from the Pac-10
that are pitted against each other
regional play.
The host, and fourth-seeded
Fresno State Bulldogs, will defi
nitely benefit from being at home,
but are not currently feeling all
that confident.
Despite, pitcher Jamie South

ern's impressive efforts (0.41 ERA)
the Bulldogs have struggled re
cently, splitting four straight con
ference doubleheaders at the end
of the season.
Stanford will enter the tourna
ment with a 3-0 record against the
Bulldogs this season.
California is not the only
squad that seems to be mis
placed in the selection commit
tee's bracketing decisions.
Another team that was dealt a
low blow and promises to stir
things up is a possibly underrated
five-seeded Pacific squad.

seem to be a tag team in the eyes of
the NCAA selection committee as
the two teams, out of the 48 that go
to post-season play, have been
placed in the same regional in two
of the last three years. •
Three years ago when both
teams traveled to Fresno, Pacific
finished on top with a 6-5 extra-in
ning heart breaker.
However, in the 2001 regional
tournament hosted by Stanford,
the Cardinal took on the Tigers
twice in two matchups to decide
which team was going to Okla
homa for the Women's College
World Series.
In the first face-off the
Tigers pulled out a victory and
handed Stanford its first loss of
the tournament.
But, in the second game of the
day, the Cardinal came through
and claimed the regional title for
its first trip to the Women's Col
lege World Series.
In this year's match-up Pacific
will be seeking revenge, while Stan
ford will be shooting for its second
trip to Oklahoma City.
The unranked Evansville Pur
ple Aces claimed the Missouri Val
ley Conference title with an upset
victory over top-seed Illinois State.
Evansville went 7-3 in its last 10
outings down the stretch to claim a
berth. Evansville is the only team
at the tournament that is not a Cal
ifornia native.
Stanford has been dealt quite
a deck in its regional assign
ment, and its competition
promises to be fierce.
But, if it does earn its second
trip to Oklahoma City, it will be
that much sweeter in the end.
"I definitely think we are in a
tough region," said junior pitch
er Tori Nyberg. "But, I think it
will end up for the best, because
if we can get through our region
we will be all the more prepared
for the [Women's College]
World Series."

Three years ago when both
teams traveled to Fresno, Pacific
finished on top with a 6-5 extra-in
ning heart breaker.
However, in the 2001 regional
tournament hosted by Stanford,
the Cardinal took on the Tigers
twice in two matchups to decide
which team was going to Okla
homa for the Women's College
World Series.
In the first face-off the
Tigers pulled out a victory and
handed Stanford its first loss of
the tournament.
But, in the second game of the
day, the Cardinal came through
and claimed the regional title for
its first trip to the Women's Col
lege World Series.
In this year's match-up Pacific
will be seeking revenge, while Stan
ford will be shooting for its second
trip to Oklahoma City.
The unranked Evansville Pur
ple Aces claimed the Missouri Val
ley Conference title with an upset
victory over top-seed Illinois State.
Evansville went 7-3 in its last 10
outings down the stretch to claim a
berth. Evansville is the only team
at the tournament that is not a Cal
ifornia native.
Stanford has been dealt quite
a deck in its regional assign
ment, and its competition
promises to be fierce.
But, if it does earn its second
trip to Oklahoma City, it will be
that much sweeter in the end.
"I definitely think we are in a
tough region," said junior pitch
er Tori Nyberg. "But, I think it
will end up for the best, because
if we can get through our region
we will be all the more prepared
for the [Women's College]
World Series."
The day of the postseason se
lection show is always one of
guessing and speculation —
who will be the top seeds? Where
will Stanford go?
This year nobody guessed
right.

SOFTBALL
Thursday: No. 8 Stanford
vs. No. 1/ Pacific, 2:30 p.m.,
Fresno, Calif., NCAA Regional
First Round

The entire softball communi
ty was shocked Sunday evening
when it learned of the Regional
tournament bracketing and
host locations.
For the first time since the
NCAA softball tournament added
regional rounds, not one Pacific 10
Conference softball squad will be
hosting any games.
While the No. 8 Cardinal team
(43-18) will be making just a short
trip down to Fresno State, the No.
1 UCLA Bruins and the No. 2 Ari
zona Wildcats, will be forced to
journey to South Carolina and
Minnesota, respectively.
No one could have ever guessed
these hosting sites because never
before have the third and fourth
seeded teams been given the great
advantage of playing the regional
at their home stadium.
Stanford's assignment, al
though closer to home than most
other Pac-10 teams, promises to be
a challenging one, as it is accompa
nied by teams that have been ar
guably "low-balled."
"We are in the toughest region
al in the country," said head coach
John Rittman. "It is going to make
it interesting. Everyone there will
need to play their best softball."
In fact, the regional tourna
ment that will be played at No. 14
Fresno State's stadium resembles
greatly the regional tournament

in which seniors Jessica Men
do/a, Sarah Beeson and Robin
Walker competed during their
fresh mai 1 cam paign s.
Both Fresno State and Pacific
were participants in the 1999
regional tournament, which
was also played at the home of
the Bulldogs.
The Cardinal's season was cut
short that year as it went down
with two straight losses to Pacific
and Fresno State.
This year, the seniors are
going to do everything they can
to avoid a repeat of the 1999 sea
son's end.
"For the three of us that went to
the regional tournament three
years ago this weekend will be
good fora little redemption," first
baseman Beeson said. "It will give
us a chance to show that the first
year was a fluke."
Stanford enters the tournament
as the region's No. 2 seed just be
hind regional top seed Cal State-
Fullerton (50-11), ranked No. 9 in
the country. The Titans are an all
too-familiar face, as the Cardinal
and Cal State-Fullerton have gone
head-to-head three times already
this season.
Stanford has beaten the Titans
in all three meetings and is eager to
do so again this weekend.
In fact, the NCAA's commit
ment to try and arrange tourna
ments that allow for competition
between unfamiliar teams was
completely disregarded when one
looks at the field at the regional in
Fresno State.
Stanford has played Pacific
twice and has battled Cal State-
Fullerton, California and Fresno
State three times already this sea
son. The lone squad that the Car
dinal has not squared off against
is No. 6 seed Evansville (34-25).
The third-seeded California
Bears were one of the biggest sur
prises of the entire selection show.
The Bears were ranked fifth
in the nation going into these

lection show, and were subse
quently dealt quite a blow when
labeled as a No. 3 seed at the re
gional tournament.
The season record is currently
tipped in favor of the Bears, who
have beaten Stanford twice in
three meetings during the confer
ence season.
Stanford and California are also
the only two teams from the Pac-10
that are pitted against each other
regional play.
The host, and fourth-seeded
Fresno State Bulldogs, will defi
nitely benefit from being at home,
but are not currently feeling all
that confident.
Despite, pitcher Jamie South

ern's impressive efforts (0.41 ERA)
the Bulldogs have struggled re
cently, splitting four straight con
ference doubleheaders at the end
of the season.
Stanford will enter the tourna
ment with a 3-0 record against the
Bulldogs this season.
California is not the only
squad that seems to be mis
placed in the selection commit
tee's bracketing decisions.
Another team that was dealt a
low blow and promises to stir
things up is a possibly underrated
five-seeded Pacific squad.
