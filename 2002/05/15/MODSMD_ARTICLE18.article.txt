# Women begin final spring-season stretch
## 
### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
Much ado is made about the importance of reg
ular-season games as precursors for the achieve
ment of a successful postseason.
Some may argue that when there's an obstacle
to overcome a team's true colors shine through,
But the spring season is really where the heart lies,
where the soul of a team is established and it is
now that the tone will be set for the Stanford
women's soccer team's upcoming season.
Now.
When there is nothing to play for, no medal to
win, or trophy in sight, that's when a team is made.
Now.
When there exists only some ideal notion of un
fulfilled December glory days hanging taught ing
ly in the balances as a reminder of all that could
have been and all that hopefully will be, that's
when self-motivation must prevail.

"The spring season is important to us be
cause it gives up the opportunity to work to
gether as a team in order to prepare ourselves
for the fall without the pressure of having to get
the result," Stanford head coach Andy Nelson
said. "We've been able to give everybody a
chance to play."
1 he Cardinal has looked very impressive thus
far in its first four games of the spring season.
Stanford has yet to give up a goal in its defeats of
the Mexican National Team (2-0), Southern Cali
fornia (2-0), California (2-0), and St. Mary's (5-0).
Ibis feat is in part due to the return of sophomore
goalkeeper Nicole Barnhart.
"[Barn hart's] playing fantastically," said Nel
son. "[Her knee] is completely line."
The Cardinal's most recent victim was St.
Mary's. The Cardinal unleashed an array of of
fensive attackers at an over matched Gaels squad.
Senior midfielder Becky Myers, junior forward
Marcie Ward junior defender Allyson Marquand
and sophomore forward Katie Waylend all scored
in Stanford's 5-0 romp.
"We've played well thus far," said Nelson "But
we're working right now on keeping the ball a little
bit more. We're trying to get the ball forward earli
er, and as always we're working on defending."
More than just an opportunity to improve,

Senior forward Morcia Wallis has become one of the key leaders on this Cardinal
team during the spring season.
the spring season also allows the
Stanford coaching stall to fill in
question marks the upcoming
season.
With the graduation of key
seniors goalkeeper Carrie
Walsh and co-captains defender
Amy Sauer and midfielder
Christy LaPierre, the issue of
leadership will be a theme in
this Cardinal team's search for
identity.
"I think Natalie Spilger, Ally
Marquand, Kelsey Carlson and
Marcia Wallis have really
stepped into leadership roles,"
Nelson said.
And even if the leadership
question can be resolved right
now question marks will remain

about the incoming class.
"We have seven players coming
in," Nelson said. "It's a very good
class and I expect several of them
to be able to step onto the field
right away and make a difference."
But the play of the incoming
class is something that the Cardi
nal cannot focus on right now.
Stanford must channel its atten
tion on its next opponent. Today
the Cardinal will take on a Palo
Alto boys under-15 club team.
"We've played boys' teams be
fore," Nelson said. "The nice
thing is that they're usually (juite
athletic and very fast. Athletically
speaking, they'll give us a pretty
good test."
The Cardinal will close its
spring season at home on May 24
against Bay Area rival and nation
al champion Santa Clara â€” the
same team that Stanford will
open its 2002 season against.
