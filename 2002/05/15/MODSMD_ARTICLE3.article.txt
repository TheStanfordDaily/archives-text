# Cold virus tested as cancer treatment

### WAYNN LUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Researchers at the Stanford
Medical Center and the Palo
Alto Veteran's Hospital have
been testing an unusual treat
ment for cancer. The process
involves a genetically modified
cold virus, which is injected into
the liver as a way to target can
cerous cells.
By using this virus, the treat
ment leaves normal cells un
harmed, unlike the current
treatment method of
chemotherapy. The virus is
weakened so that it is not as in
fectious as a normal cold virus.
"We want to kill the tumor,
but not at the expense of the pa
tient," said Tony Reid, an MD-
Ph.D. who conducted the viral
portion of the study at the Palo
Alto VA Hospital.
The study involved 35 can
cer patients, each expected to
live no more than six months.
They received various doses of
the modified virus, injected di
rectly into an artery leading to
the liver.
Those that benefited the
most were the 28 patients that
received the highest dosage.
Each of those patients survived
for almost a year. In addition,
many of their tumors also ap
peared to shrink and stopped
producing abnormal, tumor
associated proteins.
In order to prevent the im
mune system from screening

the injected virus, "special
catheters were used to deliver
the virus directly te the tumor
cells," said Daniel Sze, assistant
professor of radiology at Stan
ford Medical Center. S/e con
ducted the delivery portion of
the study.
These catheters were insert
ed into the bloodstream and di
rected to the site of the tumor,
where the viral particles were
released. This method circum
vented the immune system, al
lowing the virus to go directly
to the liver and attack the can
cer cells.
Sze said that in most can
cers, a protein called p53 is de
fective. Cells normally self-de
struct after a period of time,
but those without p53 do not.
Instead, the cells divide con
stantly with no stop in replica
tion. But the lack of p53 is a
weakness for the cancer cells,
as well. The modified cold
virus can enter the malignant
cells and destroy them be
cause they don't have p53 as a
defense.
Follow-up studies are cur
rently being conducted, as the
main purpose of this phase I
study was to show that the treat
ment was safe.
"In this trial, we got a hint
that it might actually benefit
people with cancer," Sze said.
In fact, though this study in
vestigated liver tumors that
had spread from an original
tumor in the colon, Reid added
that other studies were being
done on the virus as a possible
treatment for ovarian and pan
creatic cancer.
Reid and Sze hope that future
studies will yield more informa
tion about this treatment, such as
how it works and the tumors
against which it is most effective.
