# Rally draws attention to violence in India
## Protesters condemn the recent attacks against Muslims in Gujarat 
### ELIZABETH MADJLESSI STAFF WRITER 
Seventy members of the Stan
ford community gathered in the
shade outside of the Bechtel Inter
national Center Assembly Room at
noon yesterday to raise awareness
about the violence that has been oc
curring in Gujarat, India.
The event's organizers said that
in March, following a gruesome at
tack on Hindu activists in Godhra,
India, police and politician-led
mobs attacked Muslims in the
Western Indian state of Gujarat.
According to flyers and e-mails
advertising the event, more than
2,000 Muslims have been killed,
with the active collusion of the state;
the publicity materials also said that
100,000 Muslims are living in
crowded refugee camps, which the
Hindu right-wing government is al
ready threatening to dismantle.
A joint group of graduate and
undergraduate students organized
the event, which was sponsored by
Saheli, Stanford's South Asian
women's alliance. The event was
originally planned for White Plaza.
In their flyers and e-mails, orga
nizers said, "We strongly condemn
the killings of the 58 Hindus in
Godhra, but we cannot support
state-sponsored genocide. What
happened in Gujarat was not com
munal riots, but ethnic cleansing."
Ashwini Deo, a doctoral stu
dent in linguistics, led the rally,
expressing her intolerance of the
situation.

"This is the worst religious
bloodletting to happen in India in
a decade," Deo said.
Cultural and Social Anthropol
ogy Profs. Akhil Gupta and Purni
ma Mankekar also addressed the
crowd.
By reading citizen reports of the
violence that people have under
gone, "we make visible the sexual
violence that has been made invisi
ble by the Indian press," Mankekar
said. "As a woman, I condemn the
way women's bodies are used as a
battleground [in these conflicts]."
Gupta said that the extremist

Hindus participating in these
acts "neither understand the
spirit nor the message of Hin
duism." They are a "danger to
democracy," he added, because
as the majority in India, the Hin
dus control a substantial portion
of the government and are not
investigating the claims of the cit
izens of Gujarat.
Sophomore Golda Philip at
tended the event to "show group
solidarity with other concerned
members on campus," she said.
"Today's event was a rally put
on by students and faculty who are

concerned about the violation of
human rights in Gujarat," Philip
said. "It was also a rally that made
the statement that [the] rise of such
communal violence that co-opts re
ligion is not tolerable, and will not
be met with our silence."
A petition was also passed
around that will be sent to the In
dian Prime Minister's Office, the
Indian consulate's office and
India's national human rights
committee.
