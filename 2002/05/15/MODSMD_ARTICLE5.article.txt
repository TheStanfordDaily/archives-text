# At least some people are happy with the Draw...
## They're number one 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Juniors Sandy Jen and Katherine
Chou were calmly eating lunch last
Wednesday when they heard that the
Draw results had been posted â€” and
someone in their dorm had drawn num

ber one.
"We didn't even know the numbers
were up," said Jen, who lives in Arroyo
with Chou and her third drawmate, Lau
ren Chan. "Somebody said someone in
Arroyo got number one, so we said, 'OK,
let's just check.'"
Jen scanned the posted results for the

group as Chou looked on.
Jen said when she saw the number
0001 listed next to her SU11) number, she
needed to double-check on it her SUID
card because she didn't believe that she re
membered it light.
When the two realized what had hap
pened, the celebration began.
Chou said she was in denial. "If I be :
lieved it and it was wrong, I would be se
verely disappointed."
Chan was in class, but was told about
her good fortune by a friend as she got up
to leave.
"I had this sort of spontaneous com
bustion," she said. "I said something and
then about six heads turned in my class."
Sometimes, one of the thousands of
draw groups gets lucky enough to draw
0001 and lay claim to practically any hous
ing on campus. This year, these three ju
nior girls with their sights set on West l*i
gunita sniped the top spot, ending what
they describe as an unfortunate history
with the Draw.
Jen, Chou and Chan have drawn to
gether in each of the last three years since
tliey met in West Lag freshman year.
