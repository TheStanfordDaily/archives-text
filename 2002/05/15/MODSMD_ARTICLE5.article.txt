# At least some people are happy with the Draw...
## They're number one 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Juniors Sandy Jen and Katherine
Chou were calmly eating lunch last
Wednesday when they heard that the
Draw results had been posted — and
someone in their dorm had drawn num

ber one.
"We didn't even know the numbers
were up," said Jen, who lives in Arroyo
with Chou and her third drawmate, Lau
ren Chan. "Somebody said someone in
Arroyo got number one, so we said, 'OK,
let's just check.'"
Jen scanned the posted results for the

group as Chou looked on.
Jen said when she saw the number
0001 listed next to her SU11) number, she
needed to double-check on it her SUID
card because she didn't believe that she re
membered it light.
When the two realized what had hap
pened, the celebration began.
Chou said she was in denial. "If I be :
lieved it and it was wrong, I would be se
verely disappointed."
Chan was in class, but was told about
her good fortune by a friend as she got up
to leave.
"I had this sort of spontaneous com
bustion," she said. "I said something and
then about six heads turned in my class."
Sometimes, one of the thousands of
draw groups gets lucky enough to draw
0001 and lay claim to practically any hous
ing on campus. This year, these three ju
nior girls with their sights set on West l*i
gunita sniped the top spot, ending what
they describe as an unfortunate history
with the Draw.
Jen, Chou and Chan have drawn to
gether in each of the last three years since
tliey met in West Lag freshman year.

Katherine Chou, Sandy Jen and Lauren Chan attained the pinnacle of Draw success:
number 0001. The three juniors hope to live in singles in West Lagunita.
Freshman year, they and a fourth
member drew in the 1600s, landing
them in a Roble quad. Last year the
four drew unpreferred and ended
up in Arroyo in Wilbur.
"We didn't think we had die best
track record," said Jen.
For their senior year, Jen, Chou
and Chan — the former fourth
member accepted a staff position in
Adelfa — hoped to return to West
where they met, and all live in
singles.
"We were hoping that this was
the year our luck would turn,"
Chan said.
Last year, the cut-off fora three
person female draw group in
Granada, the girls' first choice, was
427.
For the last three years, the
group has alternated who signed
up for the Draw in the hopes that
one of them would have a lucky
touch.
"This year was my year," said
Chan. "I actually got a lucky draw
group and password name from
somebody who has had good luck
before. We're wondering if that had
anything to do with it."
Chan refused to divulge the
group name they used this year.
"We're going to keep it a secret to
pass down to whomever we
choose," she said.
Ironically, the Tuesday before
the Draw, Chou said that the three
were hypothesizing about the
chances of actually drawing num
ber one.
"The day before we were calcu
lating how the probability of getting
a one is close to zero," she said.
"That's equivalent to infinite
wealth."
Though the three have a ticket
to almost anywhere on campus,
they said that they have resisted the
temptation to go to the most popu
lar annual destinations, Row hous
es like Bob, Xanadu and Lambda
Nu, to go to West Lag where it iill
began.
"1 think we've kept really true to
going back to I-ag," Chan said. "Sin
gles were more important to us
than other factors."
"After hearing this so much, es
pecially from friends who were
close to us, we started wavering a lit
tle bit," said Chou.
But the group quickly conclud
ed, " No this is ridiculous, we want to
get our singles and go back to
Granada or West I-ag," Chou said.
Reaction to their good fortune
and choices has been a mixture of
skepticism and playful ribbing.
"We always get comments from
people saying 'Why are you wasting
your Draw number?' " Chan said.
The group that drew 0001 last
year now lives in Mirrielees, anoth
er less-popular choice.
Chou said that the three have
drawn the ire of some students,
though they take such comments
lightly.
"There's been just 'I hate you,'
but it's on a joking level," Chou said
about her peers' response to her
draw number. "Generally it's a neg
ative reaction. I think most of the
people I've talked to have drawn
1300 or higher."
Some have also accused the
group of beating the system — not
by choosing a lucky group name,
but by more underhanded tech
niques.
"We've gotten some funny com
ments along the way," said Chan.
"Cat and Sandy are Computer Sci
ence majors, and somebody asked,
'Oh, so did you get Cat and Sandy
to hack the Draw machine?'"
The group was unclear about
their list of choices, since the it is
guaranteed to end up in its first
choice.
Chan said, "I put Granada,
Adelfa, Eucalipto. Uh, then what
did 1 do?" she asked. "I might have
done Roble ..."

skepticism and playful ribbing.
"We always get comments from
people saying 'Why are you wasting
your Draw number?' " Chan said.
The group that drew 0001 last
year now lives in Mirrielees, anoth
er less-popular choice.
Chou said that the three have
drawn the ire of some students,
though they take such comments
lightly.
"There's been just 'I hate you,'
but it's on a joking level," Chou said
about her peers' response to her
draw number. "Generally it's a neg
ative reaction. I think most of the
people I've talked to have drawn
1300 or higher."
Some have also accused the
group of beating the system — not
by choosing a lucky group name,
but by more underhanded tech
niques.
"We've gotten some funny com
ments along the way," said Chan.
"Cat and Sandy are Computer Sci
ence majors, and somebody asked,
'Oh, so did you get Cat and Sandy
to hack the Draw machine?'"
The group was unclear about
their list of choices, since the it is
guaranteed to end up in its first
choice.
Chan said, "I put Granada,
Adelfa, Eucalipto. Uh, then what
did 1 do?" she asked. "I might have
done Roble ..."
Juniors Sandy Jen and Katherine
Chou were calmly eating lunch last
Wednesday when they heard that the
Draw results had been posted — and
someone in their dorm had drawn num

ber one.
"We didn't even know the numbers
were up," said Jen, who lives in Arroyo
with Chou and her third drawmate, Lau
ren Chan. "Somebody said someone in
Arroyo got number one, so we said, 'OK,
let's just check.'"
Jen scanned the posted results for the

group as Chou looked on.
Jen said when she saw the number
0001 listed next to her SU11) number, she
needed to double-check on it her SUID
card because she didn't believe that she re
membered it light.
When the two realized what had hap
pened, the celebration began.
Chou said she was in denial. "If I be :
lieved it and it was wrong, I would be se
verely disappointed."
Chan was in class, but was told about
her good fortune by a friend as she got up
to leave.
"I had this sort of spontaneous com
bustion," she said. "I said something and
then about six heads turned in my class."
Sometimes, one of the thousands of
draw groups gets lucky enough to draw
0001 and lay claim to practically any hous
ing on campus. This year, these three ju
nior girls with their sights set on West l*i
gunita sniped the top spot, ending what
they describe as an unfortunate history
with the Draw.
Jen, Chou and Chan have drawn to
gether in each of the last three years since
tliey met in West Lag freshman year.

Katherine Chou, Sandy Jen and Lauren Chan attained the pinnacle of Draw success:
number 0001. The three juniors hope to live in singles in West Lagunita.
Freshman year, they and a fourth
member drew in the 1600s, landing
them in a Roble quad. Last year the
four drew unpreferred and ended
up in Arroyo in Wilbur.
"We didn't think we had die best
track record," said Jen.
For their senior year, Jen, Chou
and Chan — the former fourth
member accepted a staff position in
Adelfa — hoped to return to West
where they met, and all live in
singles.
"We were hoping that this was
the year our luck would turn,"
Chan said.
Last year, the cut-off fora three
person female draw group in
Granada, the girls' first choice, was
427.
For the last three years, the
group has alternated who signed
up for the Draw in the hopes that
one of them would have a lucky
touch.
"This year was my year," said
Chan. "I actually got a lucky draw
group and password name from
somebody who has had good luck
before. We're wondering if that had
anything to do with it."
Chan refused to divulge the
group name they used this year.
"We're going to keep it a secret to
pass down to whomever we
choose," she said.
Ironically, the Tuesday before
the Draw, Chou said that the three
were hypothesizing about the
chances of actually drawing num
ber one.
"The day before we were calcu
lating how the probability of getting
a one is close to zero," she said.
"That's equivalent to infinite
wealth."
Though the three have a ticket
to almost anywhere on campus,
they said that they have resisted the
temptation to go to the most popu
lar annual destinations, Row hous
es like Bob, Xanadu and Lambda
Nu, to go to West Lag where it iill
began.
"1 think we've kept really true to
going back to I-ag," Chan said. "Sin
gles were more important to us
than other factors."
"After hearing this so much, es
pecially from friends who were
close to us, we started wavering a lit
tle bit," said Chou.
But the group quickly conclud
ed, " No this is ridiculous, we want to
get our singles and go back to
Granada or West I-ag," Chou said.
