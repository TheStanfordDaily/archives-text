# Benson debunks Draw myths
## Housing Assignment Services Director swears: no tricks, no algorithms, just plain luck 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Editor's Note: The Daily talked with Homing
Assignment Services Director Todd Benson to
uncover the truth about the Draw. The follow
ing is a transcript of the interview.
Daily: Tve heard that there's a certain al
gorithm that sorts the group names, so if
you can hack into the system and figure out
the algorithm, you can make your group
name such that the computer will order it
first.
Benson: Let's put it this way: if there's an
algorithm like that, I've never heard of it,
I've never seen it, I've never written it.
There is nothing in there to sort — it's all
based on random number and priorities.
So there's no such algorithm — but that
sounds like a very Stanford thing to do.
Daily: A group last year made their name

something like "ResEdsucks " and drew in
the 1900s last year. They're convinced that
[the Office of Residential Education]
found their name and punished them.
Benson: We see group names that people
say have the initials of somebody in the of
fice and "is great" and then the password
is "HASgod." We see them, we also see a
fair number of obscene group names that
people put in, but we never change those.
We absolutely never touch anything like
that. Most of the time, unless there's a
problem, we never even pay attention to
the group names and passwords.
Daily: What are some of the other myths or
rumors out there?
Benson: I heard some students talking to
each other and they said, "Oh, I heard
that if you get a good number one year, it
automatically means you're going to get a
good number next year," and because I
overheard them I stopped and I said,
"You know I work in that office and that's
actually not true, it's completely ran
dom." ... I think it's a kind of supersti-
tion, it's just like baseball players
— when you have something you
can't control you're more likely to
develop superstitions and stories
about it.
Daily: So how does the Draw real
ly work? Sure there are random
numbers, but they have to get as
signed to groups somehow.
Benson: The way that it works is
that there is a computer pro
gram set up that just generates
random numbers, and we actu
ally get printouts of that because
sometimes when paper applica
tions come in, we have to assign
them random numbers. So what
we do is when there are paper
ones we don't look at the order,
we just go down and assign the

next random number off the
group.
The computer program does
it the same way: it has a set list of
random numbers in it, and the
first person who applies gets the
first random number, the second
person who applies gets the sec
ond random number, and so on
down the list.
Daily: So in some cosmic sense,
when you submit your application
does matter?
Benson: In some cosmic sense, but
you're going to have no way of
knowing where you are in the list,
and the person who submits num
ber two or number 2,000 may get a
good number one year and a bad
number the next. There's no way to
know how many students have sub
mitted before you.
Daily: Let's talk about the disabil
ity Draw. A lot of kids talk about

exploiting disabilities to get better
housing. How do you guys prevent
this?
Benson: 1 think there are a lot of
myths about the disability draw.
First of all, there are a lot of invisible
disabilities that people may not want
to share with a friend ... We may
hear of a case where a student is say
ing " I'm just using this to get around
the system," and the student may
not want to reveal to his or her
friend what the nature of the dis
ability really is. But we can't do any
thing about that.
The second thing — and this is
the big myth about the disability
Draw — there is the assumption
that the disability Draw means
you're going to get good housing.
And in lact relatively small num
bers of students who get assigned
to the disability Draw get assigned
to the primo spaces on the Row.
Students who go through that
process get a random number just

like anyone else. So what we do is,
once we see that random number,
we look at last year's Draw cut-offs
and we see which space on campus
could accommodate them. If a stu
dent needs wheelchair access and
they got 1,800, we'll look around
to [see] which rooms are wheel
chair accessible and which one
most closely corresponds to their
Draw number, and they'll gel as
signed there.
Daily: What is the most enraged
you've ever seen a student come to
the office?
Benson: We certainly have stu
dents who are unhappy about
Draw numbers. We had a group
last week who, in jest, I think, of
fered a bribe to one of my stall
members and said that they could
raise $5,000. We assume that was
in jest; we hope that was in jest.
Daily: What are some of the funnier

group names you've come across?
Benson: Let's just say that if I told
you what they were, they'd go
into an R-rated adult movie. We
get a lot of and what's
funny is when students come in
and they have to tell us to look it
up and they have to say what
their group name and password
are; they perhaps didn't realize
that they would have to do that.
Daily: What do you say to the kids
who come in and drew awful num
bers three years in a row?
Benson: I think another myth of
the Draw is that the only way you
can have a good housing experi
ence at Stanford is if you live in
Bob or Xanadu, and if you live in
Wilbur or Stern it's going to suck.
And in fact, I don't think that's
true. I think the most important
thing is the community of people
you're living with.

[the Office of Residential Education]
found their name and punished them.
Benson: We see group names that people
say have the initials of somebody in the of
fice and "is great" and then the password
is "HASgod." We see them, we also see a
fair number of obscene group names that
people put in, but we never change those.
We absolutely never touch anything like
that. Most of the time, unless there's a
problem, we never even pay attention to
the group names and passwords.
Daily: What are some of the other myths or
rumors out there?
Benson: I heard some students talking to
each other and they said, "Oh, I heard
that if you get a good number one year, it
automatically means you're going to get a
good number next year," and because I
overheard them I stopped and I said,
"You know I work in that office and that's
actually not true, it's completely ran
dom." ... I think it's a kind of supersti-
tion, it's just like baseball players
— when you have something you
can't control you're more likely to
develop superstitions and stories
about it.
Daily: So how does the Draw real
ly work? Sure there are random
numbers, but they have to get as
signed to groups somehow.
Benson: The way that it works is
that there is a computer pro
gram set up that just generates
random numbers, and we actu
ally get printouts of that because
sometimes when paper applica
tions come in, we have to assign
them random numbers. So what
we do is when there are paper
ones we don't look at the order,
we just go down and assign the

next random number off the
group.
The computer program does
it the same way: it has a set list of
random numbers in it, and the
first person who applies gets the
first random number, the second
person who applies gets the sec
ond random number, and so on
down the list.
Daily: So in some cosmic sense,
when you submit your application
does matter?
Benson: In some cosmic sense, but
you're going to have no way of
knowing where you are in the list,
and the person who submits num
ber two or number 2,000 may get a
good number one year and a bad
number the next. There's no way to
know how many students have sub
mitted before you.
Daily: Let's talk about the disabil
ity Draw. A lot of kids talk about

exploiting disabilities to get better
housing. How do you guys prevent
this?
Benson: 1 think there are a lot of
myths about the disability draw.
First of all, there are a lot of invisible
disabilities that people may not want
to share with a friend ... We may
hear of a case where a student is say
ing " I'm just using this to get around
the system," and the student may
not want to reveal to his or her
friend what the nature of the dis
ability really is. But we can't do any
thing about that.
The second thing — and this is
the big myth about the disability
Draw — there is the assumption
that the disability Draw means
you're going to get good housing.
And in lact relatively small num
bers of students who get assigned
to the disability Draw get assigned
to the primo spaces on the Row.
Students who go through that
process get a random number just

like anyone else. So what we do is,
once we see that random number,
we look at last year's Draw cut-offs
and we see which space on campus
could accommodate them. If a stu
dent needs wheelchair access and
they got 1,800, we'll look around
to [see] which rooms are wheel
chair accessible and which one
most closely corresponds to their
Draw number, and they'll gel as
signed there.
Daily: What is the most enraged
you've ever seen a student come to
the office?
Benson: We certainly have stu
dents who are unhappy about
Draw numbers. We had a group
last week who, in jest, I think, of
fered a bribe to one of my stall
members and said that they could
raise $5,000. We assume that was
in jest; we hope that was in jest.
Daily: What are some of the funnier

group names you've come across?
Benson: Let's just say that if I told
you what they were, they'd go
into an R-rated adult movie. We
get a lot of and what's
funny is when students come in
and they have to tell us to look it
up and they have to say what
their group name and password
are; they perhaps didn't realize
that they would have to do that.
Daily: What do you say to the kids
who come in and drew awful num
bers three years in a row?
Benson: I think another myth of
the Draw is that the only way you
can have a good housing experi
ence at Stanford is if you live in
Bob or Xanadu, and if you live in
Wilbur or Stern it's going to suck.
And in fact, I don't think that's
true. I think the most important
thing is the community of people
you're living with.
Editor's Note: The Daily talked with Homing
Assignment Services Director Todd Benson to
uncover the truth about the Draw. The follow
ing is a transcript of the interview.
Daily: Tve heard that there's a certain al
gorithm that sorts the group names, so if
you can hack into the system and figure out
the algorithm, you can make your group
name such that the computer will order it
first.
Benson: Let's put it this way: if there's an
algorithm like that, I've never heard of it,
I've never seen it, I've never written it.
There is nothing in there to sort — it's all
based on random number and priorities.
So there's no such algorithm — but that
sounds like a very Stanford thing to do.

something like "ResEdsucks " and drew in
