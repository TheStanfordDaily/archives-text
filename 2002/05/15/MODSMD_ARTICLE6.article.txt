Editor's Note: The Daily talked with Homing
Assignment Services Director Todd Benson to
uncover the truth about the Draw. The follow

automatically means you're going to get a
good number next year," and because I
overheard them I stopped and I said,
"You know I work in that office and that's
actually not true, it's completely ran
dom." ... I think it's a kind of supersti-
