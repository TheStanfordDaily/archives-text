Two lawsuits have been filed this month
against the Stanford Medical Center alleg

procedures.
The suits are based on separate inci
dents involving two patients who claim
foreign objects such as sponges or gauze
were mistakenly left in their bodies after
they underwent operations at the center.
Medical Center Spokeswoman

Ruthann Richter issued a statement, and
while it did not discuss the issue of culpa
bility for the mistakes, she did acknowl
edge that l he hospital is currently deal
ing with (he matter.
"We are aware of these two cases and
are working with the plaintiffs' attor
neys," Richter said.
Joy Panlilio, a 38-year-old living in
Fremont, had surgery fora broken hip
in February 2001. After the operation,
she pressed fora lawsuit, claiming that
the surgical team had failed to remove a

foreign object from her body before
completing the procedure. In the case's
initial paperwork, the object was not
specifically identified.
Panlilio could not be could not be
reached for comment. Daniel S/e and
Jagdip Powar, two of the physicians in
volved in the operation, did not respond
to phone calls. Cheryl Futerman, a third
doctor involved in the operation, de
clined to discuss the situation.
A second patient, 52-year-old East
Bay resident jacklyn Wilferd, has filed

suit as well. In court papers, she alleged
that a surgical sponge was found in her
body in mid-2001 after an operation at
the Medical Center in February of that
same year.
Wilferd was not able to be contacted.
The two physicians who were involved
with the surgery, Pamela Enayati Foster
and Mark Vierra, did not return phone
calls.
Richter explained in the press state
ment that the hospital staff "follows care
ful procedures to help prevent these

kinds of occurrences."
Media Relations Officer Michelle
Brandt discussed what the hospital has
done so far to look into the incidents.
"My understanding is that once we be
came aware of the cases, an investigation
was carried out and adherence to proce
dures was looked into," Brandt said.
"[The procedures], our information
found, were followed."
Hospital officials could not discuss the
lawsuits in greater detail on the grounds
of patient confidentiality.
