## The 						Stanford Daily University must solve shortage of student space 
### 
Published Since JB9l

Stanford prides itself on having a stu
dent body that is matchless in the
breadth and depth of its achieve
ments. Students are accepted to Stan
ford for being high-school standouts in both
academics and extracurricular activities. In
light of this, we believe the University should
do more to support student activities, espe
cially in the performing arts and non-varsity
athletics.
The lack of space for student activities on
campus has become an increasing concern.
While we understand that new facilities can
not simply appear overnight, it seems creat
ing more space for extracurricular pursuits is
not a priority for the University. While plans
are reportedly now in progress to build a new
recreational center for students' athletic pur
suits, there exist intermediate solutions to

these problems that have not been sufficient
ly explored.
Before actually constructing new facilities
— an expensive undertaking for sure — we
believe the University can take other mea
sures to underscore the value it places on stu
dents' extracurricular pursuits.
Reducing costs for voluntary student orga
nizations to rent meeting and performance
space would be a good first step. Increasing
hours for facilities like Tresidder Union
meeting rooms, large auditoriums such as
Dinkelspiel and the Wilbur Hall Seminar
Rooms would aid student groups as well.
It is especially in the University's best in
terest to support performing arts events that
showcase student talent, because these bring
many community members to campus. Con
sider that the Ram's Head Theatrical Soci

ety's spring musical, which draws thousands
during its two-weekend run, routinely re
hearses in the Stern Dining Hall and lounges
of various dorms. We doubt this is done by
choice.
The current lack of support means that
only a few of the oldest campus arts organi
zations are able to put on annual events with
out fail. For example, a cappella groups have
the opportunity to recruit at Orientation
during their concert, and Rams Head's Gai
eties has been staged for about 90 years.
However, groups like Stage One Productions
have been unable to find the funds and mem
bers to put on shows in the recent past. Many
dance groups are forced to perform in Roble
Gym, drastically limiting the possible num
ber of attendees.
Perhaps more awards like the Robert L.

Pierce award — given annually by the Alum
ni Association to an innovative project pro
posal meant, to benefit the student communi
ty — can help underwrite some of the logisti
cal costs groups experience when perform
ing. These awards would in turn lower ad
mission fees and increase attendance at
events, benefiting the Stanford community a
great deal.
While academic studies are the top priori
ty for Stanford students, we believe students
come here fora college experience that is not
exclusively contained in the classroom.
The University advertises to prospective
students how easy it is to start a student
group; we believe it should back up this claim
by helping students continue to foster the ex
tracurricular interests and talents that
brought them to the Farm.
