David Nimmons was president
of New York's Lesbian and Gay
Community Services Center for
six years and for three years was
director of education at Gay Men's
Health Crisis. Now in his new
book The Soul Beneath the Skin
he examines how for two decades,
gay men have undertaken a
profound, yet invisible set of social
experiments. This intriguing
book is the first to chart the deep
social and cultural innovations
arising in those worlds and their
meaning for the larger culture.
