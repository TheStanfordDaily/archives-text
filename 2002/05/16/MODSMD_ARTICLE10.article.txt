# Right-wing Dutch parties win

AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) — In a dra
matic shift to the right, Dutch opposition parties
won big in yesterday's elections, including the Chris
tian Democrats and the movement ofa slain populist
candidate.
Riding a wave of discontent with the country's gov
erning socialist, the Christian Democrats were ex
pected to wind up with 43 seats — up 14 from their
current holding in the 150-seat parliament.
With 88.6 percent of the vote counted, party
leader Jan Peter Balkenende declared that he was
"ready to take on the responsibility" of forming a
government.
The upstart party of slain right-wing populist Pim
Fortuyn was set to sweep into the legislature with 2(5
seats — a remarkable feat fora political force that did
not exist a few months ago.
Prime Minister Wim Kok's governing socialists
were seen plunging from 45 seats*to 23, and his Lib
eral allies from 38 to also to 23, according to the re
sults.
The outcome was a severe defeat for Kok's coali
tion that brought the Dutch peerless growth since
1994, but was punished for ignoring public concerns
about drugs, immigration, welfare abuse and lax law
enforcement.
Fortuyn brought those issues to the forefront, tap
ping into a groundswell of discontent with Holland's
ruling politicians and their tolerant policies.
He was killed May 6 by a single gunman after
doing a campaign radio interview. He was 54. His
murder shocked this country of 16 million that is a
stranger to political violence and has long prided itself

on no-ripple consensus politics.
It was a surprisingly strong showing for the right
wing Christian Democrats. Earlier polls had suggest
ed they would win by a narrow margin over the two
major parties of the outgoing coalition, the Labor
Party and the Liberals — and over Fortuyn's untest
ed followers.
The elections thrust Balkenende, a 46-year-old
Christian philosophy professor, into the role as the
likely prime minister-to be, just eight months after lie
took over the party.
The results proved Fortuyn's party, the Liberals
and the Christian Democrats could marshal a com
fortable parliamentary majority fora right-wing gov
ernment, yet an agreement on a government pro
gram would likely be tough to find.
At the outset of voting, kok told voters that his
eight years at the helm brought them "formidable"
growth and prosperity. He said the elections "are
about niy legacy."
I n the end, they were more about t he legacy of For
tuyn — the openly gay, ex-university professor who
was a harsh critic of the government's permissiveness
of welfare abusers and tolerant asylum, drug and law
enforcement policies.
Defense Minister Frank de Grave, a Liberal, called
his party's defeat "heavier than expected." The secre
tary of the Labor Party, Ruud Koole, said it was the
worst result in the party's history. "This is a difficult
day for Labor," he said.
Fortuyn's party was exultant. "This is fantastic,"
said Mat 1 ferben at his party's election headquarters
in The Hague.
