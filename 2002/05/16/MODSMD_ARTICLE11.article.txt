# How can you sift through billions of Web pages?

When Stanford students want to search the World
Wide Web these days, there's a better than good
chance they'll be using Google.
Fdgar Garcia, a junior, was unequivocal.
"Google completes me," he said. "It helps me find
everything I want and everything I need."
Compared to other search options, freshman
Katie Pfeiffer says she finds Google, which currently
searches 2,073,418,204 sites, superior.
"Yahoo has so much crap, but Google is so simple,"
she said "I Google anyone and anything."
"1 started out using Alta Vista and Lycos," said ju
nior Ben Grol. "They were adequate back in the day."
Grol is now a Google fan, though, citing the quali
ty of the searches as being better.
"I [even] have Google underwear," he said. Other
students play a game in which they enter two words
and try to find only one hit.
Junior Steve Young, a mathematical and compu
tational science major, described Google as "algorith
mically beautiful," referring to Google's method of
ranking search results based on the number - of links
that point to a particular site, essentially allowing
Web-site developers to vote on which sites are most
respected and useful.
Google's underlying technology was developed by
Stanford alumni Larry Page and Sergey Brin.
What exactly are Stanford students looking for
out there in the vast reaches of cyberspace? Acade
mics are a prime reason to search the Web. Garcia
says he does initial research for papers on Google.
Perhaps those elusive answers to problem sets are
out there as well.
Sophomore Joe Lonsdale, who says he uses Google
to help find answers to problems in his computer sci
ence class, said that for "any complex theory question,
it's surprising how much shows up."
But when the work stops, the web searching goes
on.
"Sometimes I'll look up people," said sophomore
Mike ScrafFord. "Just for fun, people will Cioogle each
other."
Indeed, it seems that the word "google" has be
come a cle facto verb in the Stanford lexicon.
"It's interesting to find what people did before
[coming to] Stanford," said ScrafFord, who says he has
discovered that his acquaintances have belonged to
"all kinds of nerdy clubs, math teams, debate teams
and things people would never admit to."
"You just look up your friends and see what weird
stuff you can find," said Pfeiffer.

She was also quick to say that she is not a "Google
stalker."
"I usually do it when the people are here with me,"
she said. "I'm not a crazy stalker girl!"
While Google has provided instant background
checks for the masses, people are not only thing Stan
ford students are looking for with their search en
gines.
Freshman Zeb Thomas looks for television
episodes of Family Guy and the Simpsons. Grol looks
for more eclectic things, like recently declassified U.S.
government documents and underwater basket
weaving.
"There really are people who hold their breath un
derwater while they weave baskets," Grol said.
Sophomore Drew Seidman uses Google to search
the Stanford Web site because he believes that it is bet
ter than Stanford's built-in search engine.
Young explained how Cioogle helped him get a
stain out of a shirt.
"In 15 minutes I found a site that showed 50 dif
ferent stains and how to get them out," he said. "It's
[also] great for finding porn."
While Stanford may seem to be "Google country,"
it doesn't have a complete monopoly on the Stanford
portal market.
"Another good search engine is Dogpile," said
PfeifTer, who says she uses it if she "can't find some
thing on Google."
Yahoo is still popular for things that search engines
are not as well-designed for, like finding news and
weather.
"I use Yahoo for maps to find directions," Garcia
said.
Some students praised Yahoo's directory format,
although Seidman complained that Yahoo's web di
rectory "hasn't kept up with the pace of the Internet"
to the point that it's just more efficient to use Cioogle.
