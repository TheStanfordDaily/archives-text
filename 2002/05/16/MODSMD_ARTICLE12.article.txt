Scientists at Houston's Space
Vacuum Epitaxy Center have de
veloped ceramic photo cells to im
prove impaired vision. They re
place damaged cells among the
millions of specialized cells in our
eyes that convert light into electri
cal impulses. 100,000 ceramic cells
on a 1 mm-square polymer strip
are implanted into the retina.
Light falls on the photocells, which
creates a voltage differential. This
triggers other cells in the retina to
relay the electrical signals to the
brain, where they are interpreted
as vision. Animal tests have shown
that the operation is safe, but how
well the implants improve vision
remains to be seen.
In 1992, Finnish scientist Eu

gene Podkletov claimed to have
built a gravity shield. It consisted
of a 12-inch superconducting ce
ramic disk that levitated in a mag
netic field. Objects placed above
the disk showed a weight loss be
tween 0.5 percent and 2 percent.
Although no one has succeeded in
duplicating these results, NASA
recently committed $600,000 to
following up on the theory.
Superconductive Components
of Columbus, Ohio, has been con
tacted to build the prototype anti
gravity device based on Podkle
tov's specifications. Such a device,
by producing even a 1 percent re
sistance to gravity, could reduce
the <"ost of every spacecraft launch
by thousands of dollars.
Studies show that sunshine can
lift your mood and your energy
levels. Unfortunately, the sun does

not always shine. To bring the ben
efits of natural daylight indoors,
the Verilux Happy Eyes Floor
Lamp simulates the balanced spec
trum of daylight. This lighting
provides sharp visibility for dose
tasks and reduces eyestrain. Its 27-
watt compact fluorescent bulb is
the equivalent to a 150-watt ordi
nary light bulb. The lamp's retail
price is $ 130.
Here is the future of couch
potatodom: the InVoca Voice Op
erated Remote Control, touted as
the world's first such universal re
mote control device, allows users
to control their TV, VCR, and a
variety of other devices with their
voice. Users must first program
the remote control to recognize up
to 54 specific commands. A maxi
mum of four users can train a sin
gle device. The retail price is $80.
