# Lieberman aims to cut drinking

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Sen. Joseph Lieberman,
a potential presidential candidate in 2004, is expand
ing his social agenda, charging yesterday that colleges
and universities aren't doing enough to combat ex
cessive student drinking.
Too many schools "are denying a problem even
exists," said Lieberman, l)-Conn., who previously has
criticized the entertainment industry for peddling sex
and violence to children.
Schools should implement tougher alcohol poli
cies and work more closely with communities and po
lice to enforce minimum drinking age laws, Lieber
man said. They should also increase enforcement at
campus events where drinking is promoted and in
form incoming students and their parents about al
cohol policies and penalties, Lieberman said at a
hearing of the Senate Governmental Affairs Com
mittee, which he chairs.
Last month, a federally appointed task force re
leased a report that found 1,400 college students are
killed each year in alcohol related accidents and that
drinking by college students contributes to 500,000
injuries and 70,000 cases of sexual assault or rape.
"Universities must move out of their denial of the
extent of these problems on their campuses," said
Daniel I'. Reardon of Washington, whose 19-year
old son, Daniel, died of acute alcohol poisoning in
February after a fraternity party at the University of

Maryland.
Terry Hartle, senior vice president of the Ameri
can Council on Education, said schools are increas
ingly offering alcohol-free parties and alcohol-free
dormitories and hosting informational sessions on al
cohol use for incoming students.
However, the success of such programs is limited,
he said, partly because students tend to resist restric
tions on their freedom. It also can be difficult, Hartle
said, to get community and business leaders, alumni
and other groups involved in comprehensive anti-al
cohol initiatives.
"That takes a lot of time, it takes a lot of money, it
takes a lot of energy, and you need a conununity
wide motivation to do it," said I lartle, whose organi
zation represents roughly half the nation's colleges
and universities.
Lieberman lauded a program launched by the Cal
ifornia State University system following the alcohol
induced death of 18-year old Adrian Heideman on
the Chico campus in October 2000.
The board of trustees adopted an alcohol-use pol
icy and gave each campus $25,000, to be matched lo
cally, to set up councils that work with local business
es and police to enforce existing laws; curtail promo
tions, such as 'happy hours,' that encourage binge
drinking; and decrease the use of alcohol in the pro
motion of business and community events.
