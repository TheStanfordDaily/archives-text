## The
						Stanford Daily Discussion of Gujarat violence a positive development 
### 
Published Since J891

What is happening in the Indian
state of Gujarat? Sadly, most
Americans, even most Stan
ford students, wouldn't be
able to give you an adequate answer to that
question. That is because, for the most part,
the American media have not done a good
job in reporting the religious communal vi
olence that has killed between 1,000 and
2,000 Indians, mostly Muslims, since
February.
Despite the lack of media attention, the
riots in Gujarat should be a concern of peo
ple everywhere, especially at a world
renowned university like Stanford. The
current violence in India has left a lot of
questions unanswered: What should the in
ternational community do to end the vio
lence? How does the violence relate to the

animosity between India and neighboring
Pakistan, both of which have nuclear
weapons? Why hasn't the Indian govern
ment done more in preventing the vio
lence? How does this violence affect the
U.S. war on terrorism?
Until recently, campus organizations have
not done a good job at trying to answer these
questions or raising awareness on this issue.
Until Mela, the South Asian cultural show
put on by Sanskriti last Sunday, there was
not a single major event on campus that dis
cussed what is happening in Gujarat.
In fact, discussion of the Gujarat issue
was first discussed last week, when students
debated whether or not the Hindu Stu
dents Council should have incorporated
the violence in Gujarat as a part of its Hin
duism Awareness Week.

Although the Hindu Students Council,
for whatever reason, did not have an event
about Gujarat in Hinduism Awareness
Week, it and other campus groups have fi
nally decided to address this issue, and we
applaud their efforts. At Mela, the Hindu
Students Council and the Muslim Student
Awareness Network held a joint moment of
silence for the victims in the violence and
provided donation boxes for the American
Red Cross' ongoing relief effort.
Tuesday, Saheli, Stanford's South Asian
women's alliance, sponsored a rally outside
of the Bechtel International Center Assem
bly Room, attended by around 70 people.
The rally focused on the humanitarian cri
sis the violence has caused â€” including the
100,000 Muslims living in crowded refugee
camps and the sexual violence against

women. These issues are especially impor
tant because they are rarely mentioned in
the press.
The Hindu Students Council also spon
sored a talk Tuesday night called "Ayodhya:
Building Hindu-Muslim Unity in the 21st
Century," and the Muslim Student Aware
ness Network is currently planning an
event later this quarter regarding Gujarat
and Hindu-Muslim violence.
Although the ethnic fighting in Gujarat
is not as publicized or as strategically im
portant to American interests as the Is
raeli-Palestinian conflict, that does not
mean it is any less significant or tragic.
People are still dying, and campus groups
involved in this area of the world should
continue to raise awareness and promote
discussion.
