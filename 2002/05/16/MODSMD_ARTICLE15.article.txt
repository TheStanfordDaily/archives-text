## Keeping Stanford ugly 
### 
STANFORD, CALIF. â€”Joining
the ranks of tens of thousands of
men before him, freshman Jamie
Scott came to the startling realiza
tion during lunch yesterday that the
women of Stanford are not good-looking.
According to the Office of Admissions,
which included the data in its yearly re
port entitled "Keeping Stanford Ugly,"
when Scott logged onto Axess last night to
file his official Acknowledgement that
Stanford Women Are Unattractive, he be
came the last of the 782 current male
freshmen to bag on Stanford chicks,
marking the 17th straight year that the en
tire freshman class has openly stated its
disdain for the women of the Farm.
"It took a little longer this year to sew
up that last spot, but Jamie finally came

through for us and I'm
proud," said Dean of Ad
missions Robin Mamlet,
in a statement released
to the local press last
night. "[Former Dean of
Admissions Robert] Kin
nally really set a fine
standard for me to fol
low. I'm just trying to

keep up the tradition. As we like to say
around the office, 'An ugly Stanford is a
p rt >d uc ti ve Stanford.
Scott's "roommate, Tad Dorfman, was
surprised that it took Scott so long to start
ragging on Stanford women.
"I don't know what the hell that guy
was thinking. 1 mean, look around you,"
said Dorfman, as he loaded up his mam
moth green monogrammed Land's End
backpack fora night of programming in
Sweet Hall.
"I've tried to send Jamie my whole col
lection of digital Anna Kournikova pic
tures so he can compare the girls here with
a real woman, but he hasn't been too in
terested. I mean, have you seen the one
where she's in that light blue Adidas outfit
with those tiny shorts? Her legs go from
her mouth to her ..
But fortunately for Mamlet and the Ad
missions Office, Scott's chemistry lab part
ner hooked up with her Florence Moore
Hall advising associate after Saturday's
Exotic Erotic party, sending Scott into a
tailspin that climaxed when he angrily
lashed out at lunch.
"Like when I came to school, 1 was
bragging to all my friends going to MIT
and Cornell that I was going toCali, baby,
the land of hot chicks," Scott told his on
line chess buddies over a Wilbur dining
meal of warm chicken quesadillas, polen
ta, carrot cake and a refreshing glass of
blue Powerade.
"But, man, I mean, I'd go so far as to
possibly say that most of the time and on
most occasions, with some exceptions of
course, these girls are just not hot," he
concluded. "But, you know, that's just me.
I could be wrong. There are some cute
girls. Like those Dollies. Whew. Now

we're talking."
While Scott's confident, powerful dec
laration elicited praise from the adminis
tration, the girls of "Rinc" were not
pleased.
Lisa Walker, a freshman girl who was sit
ting by Scott when he made his statement,
took quick offense to Scott's opinions.
"Are you kidding, Jamie!?!? You're not
such a stud yourself. I heard about when
you got drunk at FuMuOnQua, tripped
over that bike rack and broke your arm.
And what about Brenda? Look at her,
she's cute. She's got blond hair, just like
your Anna Kournikova. And she's an ath
lete, too. She plays rugby. That's pretty
hot," Walker said as bits of tofu burger
dribbled from her mouth.
Dorfman, however, provided an elo
quent defense of his friend's courageous
statement.
"A few years back, a poll by some mag
azine said that Stanford guys are like No.
3 in their "hottest guys on campus" survey
or something. Stanford girls ranked sec
ond to last. Deal with those hard facts,"
said Dorfman, who sat down at lunch late
after spending the morning alphabetizing
his collection of MP3s.
While reports are sketchy, numerous
witnesses said they then heard Scott softly
mutter, "Yeah, what up now, biznitch."
Scott refused comment.
While Walker has launched a hate
crime investigation through the Universi
ty, claiming that Scott violated her right to
believe, despite all incontrovertible evi
dence, that she was mildly good-looking,
Scott received a vote of support from a
most likely sector.
Though Sjcott never rushed and is al
ready moving with his draw group into
Kimball, last night the Sigma Alpha Ep
silon fraternity offered the freshman a
"snap" bid, which allows the fraternity to
say to a student, "Saaa-Nap! We want you
in our house!"
"We feel that Scott's courageous state
ments today have proven that he has the
personal integrity and brutal honesty
necessary to be a part of our great broth
erhood," the SAE house said in a state
ment released late last night. "Though he
may have been one of only eight guys not
to say this to his roommate the first week
end of school, we still feel that his willing
ness to be hated by the majority of women
on campus proves that Jamie Scott has
what it takes to be in SAE. He is a True
Gentleman."
Hours after the lunchtime conversa
tion turned him into a campus hero, Scott
said he just wanted all the attention to go
away.
"Look, 1 didn't want any of this," he
said, after being found crumpled up in the
corner of the Rinconada computer clus
ter, trying to find solace in the only place
he's ever really felt comfortable. "I just

want to get back to my old life,
when I could spend my Friday and
Saturday nights watching South
Park marathons with my friends."
An unlikely hero but, to the Ad
missions Office, a welcome voice
nonetheless.
"Jamie is a testament to the sue

cess of our admissions policies,"
Mamlet concluded. "The more we
can make the rest of campus look
like Arroyo, the better."
