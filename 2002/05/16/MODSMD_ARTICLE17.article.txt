'Pro-Israel column 'shocking in its racism'
The column written by the Stanford Is
rael Alliance in Wednesday's Daily ("Israel
not at fa I*l It for self-inflicted tragedy of
Palestinian refugees") was shocking in its
racism. The primary c laim of this piece
seems to be that Israel's ethnic cleansing of
Palestinians was not a crime; rather, the
failure of neighboring states to facilitate
this ethnic cleansing by relocating
refugees was the crime.
What moral law allows an attacker to
complain that his victim suffered because
the ambulance driver was incompetent?
The article claims that since Palestinians
ate Arabs, and all Arabs are the same —
"brethren," in the language of the arti
cle—it is the duty of neighboring Arab
states to absorb Palestinian refugees.
Furthermore, the article calls the
Nakba "self-inflicted." By this, the authors
seem to mean that it was the fault of Arab
states —but even if this were true, this is
only "self-inflicted" in the racist logic of the
authors: "they're all Arabs."
Nowhere in the article is there the
slightest appreciation that the notion of
ethnic ally pure states is a bankrupt ideolo
gy. When the authors proclaim that allow
ing refugees to return to the land of their
birth would mean the "destruction of Is
rael," they betray their racism.
This is the same claim that South
African extremists made in defense of
Apartheid: political franchise to a black
majority was "racial suicide." Did the revo
cation of the Group Areas Ac t mean the

destruction of the state of South Africa?
No, it meant change.
The authors are correct in predicting
that an Israel in its current form, with sep
arate classes of citizens according to eth
nicity, would become less and less stable if
the privileged group became a minority.
This is why constitutions that protect mi
nority rights are important.
A democratic Israel / Palestine with
equal rights for all is unlikely in the near
future, and the level of suffering and
bloodshed can be reduced even if Israel
continues as an exclusionist state along
side a Palestinian state.
This is the ideology of separate devel
opment —of apartheid—and, as a prag
matic solution, it is better than continued
war. But let us not allow an Israeli vision of
ethnic / religious purity to sabotage any
discussion of Palestinian refugees.

Anti-Israel column contained 'blatant
factual errors'
Thank you for offering both views of
the Palestinian refugee problem in your
articles yesterday. Although both sides got
to tell their versions of the story, I would
like to comment on the column written by
the Coalition for Justice in Israel / Pales
tine ("Israel to blame for expulsion of
Palestinians from their land in 1048") by
pointing out some blatant factual errors in

the column.
The column alleges that the Jews al
ways wanted the whole land of Israel by
quoting David Ben Gurion's private jour
nal. First of all, private journals are not the
best sources of true political agenda, and
all official documents of the time indicate
that Ben Ciurion was willing to accept any
state offered to him.
Secondly, the quote is taken out of con
text. Its continuation, which explains that
the remaining land would be bought from
the Arabs at fair prices, was left out, mak
ing it seem as though Israel planned take
the land by force.
Thirdly, Ben Ciurion changed his posi
tions on many of these issues frequently,
and his position in 1938 does not reflect
his political agenda in 1948. It is dubious
that the proof of Israel's plans for taking
over all of the land after the partition is de
rived from a single quote in the personal
diary of a leader, 10 years before the par
tition was announced. Furthermore, it
cannot justify the Arab refusal of the parti
tion, since I doubt many Arab leaders had
access to Ben Gurion's diary.
The next error lies in the figures given
for the amounts of land allocated. In 1947
only 3.3 percent of the land was owned by
Arabs and 7 percent by Jews. The article
vastly exaggerated when it mentioned that
94 percent was under Arab ownership. Ac
tually, the vast majority of the land was
government-owned or, in other words,
belonged to the British mandate. Also, out
