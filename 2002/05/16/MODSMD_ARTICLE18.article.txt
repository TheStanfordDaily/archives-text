## Wolf Pack hunts down Cardinal in non-conference match The
						teams combined for 25 runs on 30 hits, including seven home runs in the offensive battle 
### MALCOLM LEVINE STAFF WRITER 
It is pretty much guaranteed that when a
team as well-rounded as the N0.7 Cardinal (35-
15,11 -7 Pacific 10 Conference) scores 12 runs in
a game, you can just place another notch in the
win column. But, don't forget the "pretty much"
part of that assumption.

Tuesday: Nevada 13, No. 7 Stanford 12

On Tuesday afternoon, in a non-conference
game, Nevada (22-29) upset the Cardinal for the
second time in three years, winning 13-12 in a
wild affair at I'eccoce Park in Reno, Nev.
The game was an old-fashioned western
shoot-out, as the two teams combined for 25
runs on 30 hits, including seven home runs.
Senior infielders Scott Dragicevich and Arik
VanZandt, and sophomore rightfielder Carlos
Quentin went deep for Stanford, bringing the
team total to 68 home runs on the season, sur
passing last year's mark of 07 with six games to
be played.
Sophomore centerfielder Sam Fuld con
tinued to swing a hot bat, going 3 for 5 for his
10th multiple-hit game in his last 11 outings
while raising his team-high batting average
to .383.
The Cardinal lost despite getting off to a good
start, establishing a 4-0 lead in the top of the first
inning and a 7-4 lead after the top of the third.
"It's really frustrating not being able to come

through in big spots," said junior catcher Ryan
Garko, who was named a semifinalist for the
Johnny Bench Award, which is given annually to
the nation's top collegiate catcher on Wednes
day. "We know that we've got to play better, and
especially pitch better, to win."
Offense was not the problem on Tuesday. It
was the pitching that failed head coach Mark
Marquess and his Stanford team.
Marquess was forced to use six pitchers in the
contest, with only one — senior Dan Rich —
being able to hold the Woli Pack scoreless, as he
was able to do in the fifth and sixth innings.
Junior Ryan McCally (4-3) got the loss for the
Cardinal, giving up two runs, both earned, in
two innings of work.
McCally entered the game in the bottom of
the seventh with the score knotted at 11, but
the righthander allowed a two-run homer to
Nevada outfielder Mike Hass that proved to be
the game-winner.
After a rare scoreless inning, the Cardinal en
tered the top of the ninth inning down 13-11
and rallied to get runners on second and third
with only one out, as Dragicevich doubled and
senior shortstop Andy Topham reached base on
an error.
The next batter, VanZandt, hit a sacrifice fly
to score Dragicevich, bringing Stanford within
one run, but second baseman Chris O'Riordan
flied out to left field for the final out.
The loss came in Stanford's first game of a
four-game road trip, during which the team will
travel to UCLA (24-29, 8-10) this weekend fora
key Pacific 10 Conference series with the Cardi
nal just two games behind Pac-10 leader No. 19
Southern California (30-19,13-5).
"We've just have to move on this week
end," said Garko, "because we've put our
selves in a spot to catch USC and win the con
ference title."
