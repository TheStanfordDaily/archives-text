Tournament first round

"We've been waiting for this all
year," senior Gabriela Lastra said.
Stanford advanced to this week
end's Sweet Sixteen by shutting
out both Sacramento State and
No. 36 Pepperdine, 4-0, last week
end at home. Stanford is hosting
the championship this year, giving
the Cardinal a home-court advan
tage for the toughest competition
it has faced all year.
Kentucky, seeded 14th in the
tournament, will provide a stiff
challenge for the third-seeded
Cardinal. Kentucky is in the round
of Hi for the first time ever, and is
18-8 on the year.
The Wildcats offer several na
tionally-tanked singles players in
No. 44 Carolina Mayorga, No. 60
Sarah Witten and No. 84 Lauren

Rookledge. In doubles, Mayora
and Witten are pegged at No. 8,
while Jill Buckley and Amy Tre
fethen check in at No. 60.
Stanford, though, has the fire
power and depth to match up fa
vorably with any opponent in the
country. In singles, the team
boasts four of the country's top 16
players with No. 4 senior Lauren
Kalvaria, No. 6 Lastra, No. 13
freshman Erin Burdette and No.
16 Lauren Barnikow.
In doubles, Kalvaria and Lastra
have over six years of experience
playing together, and are the na
tion's top-ranked duo. Barnikow
and Burdette are ranked 14th na
tionally.
The Cardinal's unranked
players are formidable as well â€”
senior Keiko Tokuda has a 19-
match winning streak and sopho
more Emilia Anderson',s record
in dual matches this year is 20-4.

Should Stanford beat the Wild
cats, it would then face the winner
of today's match between No. 10
Arizona State and No. 7 North
Carolina at 11 a.m. on Friday.
The Cardinal has taken some
special precautions to make sure
that it is in peak condition for its
matches this weekend.
