# Springtime sing-along for Cardinal crew teams
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Baseball, track and tennis have
traditionally dominated the Stan
ford spring sports scene and this
year is no different.
Add a women's water polo
championship to the spring mix
and the Sears Cup point total and
it's easy to lose track of other ath
letic endeavors on the Farm.

But, Stanford
attracts good row
ers, too.
Chances are
you knew a few of
them in high
school. If not per
sonally, then you
might have
known them col-

lectively by the more popular
monikers jof "boat people", "crew
bies" or "the cult."
This year, my perceptions of
crew have changed dramatically.
While cult is somewhat extreme,
it's probably better that you don't
know them by any other name
than the one on their spandex
singlet.
Crew is, after all, the epitome
of team sports. There are no in
dividual superstars and a lack of
statistics that would drive Bill
James crazy.
Under the guidance of Aimee
Baker, now in her sixth year as
head coach, the Stanford women
are quietly in the middle of their
best season in history. Not to be
outdone, the men's team, led by

coach Craig Amerkhanian, has
also enjoyed a successful season.
If you're not too familiar with
crew, let me break it down for you,
sing-along style.
Row, row, row your boat...
Sounds easy enough, right?
Eight random graduate students
could row a boat, but try finding
eight people who can row a boat
2,000 meters in under seven
minutes.
For every few hours the varsi
ty-eight spends rowing its 60-foot
Resolute (that's boat to you), it
spends many more hours train
ing in and out of the water to
shave precious seconds off its
race time.
This is an amphibious team, it
conquers the stairs at Stanford Sta
dium and traverses Campus Drive
when it's not lifting weights or
practicing on the ergometer in
Ford Center.
And then there is the phrase
that makes me cringe like no other
when it comes to crew (except
maybe shopping with girls at J.):
morning practice.
Shudder.
Three days a week, the
women's team wakes up at 5:30
a.m., rows for over an hour in Red
wood City and then hits the er
gometer in the afternoon. Three
days a week, I struggle to get out of
bed for alO o'clock lecture.
1 find it somewhat impressive
that on morning-practice days the
team has already been as active as a
