# Springtime sing-along for Cardinal crew teams
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Baseball, track and tennis have
traditionally dominated the Stan
ford spring sports scene and this
year is no different.
Add a women's water polo
championship to the spring mix
and the Sears Cup point total and
it's easy to lose track of other ath
letic endeavors on the Farm.

But, Stanford
attracts good row
ers, too.
Chances are
you knew a few of
them in high
school. If not per
sonally, then you
might have
known them col-

lectively by the more popular
monikers jof "boat people", "crew
bies" or "the cult."
This year, my perceptions of
crew have changed dramatically.
While cult is somewhat extreme,
it's probably better that you don't
know them by any other name
than the one on their spandex
singlet.
Crew is, after all, the epitome
of team sports. There are no in
dividual superstars and a lack of
statistics that would drive Bill
James crazy.
Under the guidance of Aimee
Baker, now in her sixth year as
head coach, the Stanford women
are quietly in the middle of their
best season in history. Not to be
outdone, the men's team, led by

coach Craig Amerkhanian, has
also enjoyed a successful season.
If you're not too familiar with
crew, let me break it down for you,
sing-along style.
Row, row, row your boat...
Sounds easy enough, right?
Eight random graduate students
could row a boat, but try finding
eight people who can row a boat
2,000 meters in under seven
minutes.
For every few hours the varsi
ty-eight spends rowing its 60-foot
Resolute (that's boat to you), it
spends many more hours train
ing in and out of the water to
shave precious seconds off its
race time.
This is an amphibious team, it
conquers the stairs at Stanford Sta
dium and traverses Campus Drive
when it's not lifting weights or
practicing on the ergometer in
Ford Center.
And then there is the phrase
that makes me cringe like no other
when it comes to crew (except
maybe shopping with girls at J.):
morning practice.
Shudder.
Three days a week, the
women's team wakes up at 5:30
a.m., rows for over an hour in Red
wood City and then hits the er
gometer in the afternoon. Three
days a week, I struggle to get out of
bed for alO o'clock lecture.
1 find it somewhat impressive
that on morning-practice days the
team has already been as active as a

engaged in REM sleep! As Allen
Iverson so eloquently put it, "We're
talking about practice, man!"
We're talking about practice.
So, what about the off-season?
Yeah, right. The team will tell you
that, ifanything, practice is tapered
down during the spring season.
Gently down the stream...
A gentle path on the water is
the goal, but achieving said path is
easier sung than done. The
stream in this case is two kilome
ters long, sometimes lined with
buoys and often unforgiving. The
coxswain carefully guides the boat
with a string attached to the rud
der, while a single rower catching
the water the wrong way with the
oar is disastrous.
"Catching a crab" can result in

ihe person responsible for the
mishap to be completely thrown
tiom the boat and the difference
between a clean stroke and ab
solutely eating it is minute.
Although seat belts seem like
the logical solution to this prob
lem, there is some poetic justice in
a person getting soaked for his oi
lier mistake. Besides, I choreo
graphed a nice little "catching a
crab" dance at the crew formal — it
was priceless! But 1 digress.
There has been a welcome crab
shortage of sorts for Stanford this
season as the Cardinal women
have stroked their way to wins over
Kansas, Oregon State and the
under-23 British National team.
Stanford's dominating season
has included a win over rival Cali
fornia, the first since 1996, and a
fourth-place finish in the finals of
the San Diego Crew Classic. I he

ing of sixth and currently sit at No.
12 in the nation.

Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily...
That's one merrily for every
day, plus one for good luck, until
the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onship regatta this Sunday on
Lake Natoma in Rancho Cordova,
Calif.
There, the Stanford women
will look to avenge a narrow six
second loss to No. 15 Southern
California and challenge top
ranked Washington.
The Cardinal men will com
pete against top-ranked Washing
ton, second-ranked Cal and No. 8
Oregon State.
Tor at least one day, Stanford
crew will be in the spring spotlight.
Both teams figure to make a big
splash at Tac-1() Championships
and will ideally return to the Farm
following the type of performances
that will have the teams singing...

have stroked their way to wins over
Kansas, Oregon State and the
under-23 British National team.
Stanford's dominating season
has included a win over rival Cali
fornia, the first since 1996, and a
fourth-place finish in the finals of
the San Diego Crew Classic. I he
women peaked at a national rank
ing of sixth and currently sit at No.
12 in the nation.

Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily...
That's one merrily for every
day, plus one for good luck, until
the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onship regatta this Sunday on
Lake Natoma in Rancho Cordova,
Calif.
There, the Stanford women
will look to avenge a narrow six
second loss to No. 15 Southern
California and challenge top
ranked Washington.
The Cardinal men will com
pete against top-ranked Washing
ton, second-ranked Cal and No. 8
Oregon State.
Tor at least one day, Stanford
crew will be in the spring spotlight.
Both teams figure to make a big
splash at Tac-1() Championships
and will ideally return to the Farm
following the type of performances
that will have the teams singing...
Life is but a dream.
A dream it is, until that alarm
goes off at 5:30 on Monday
morning.
Baseball, track and tennis have
traditionally dominated the Stan
ford spring sports scene and this
year is no different.
Add a women's water polo
championship to the spring mix
and the Sears Cup point total and
it's easy to lose track of other ath
letic endeavors on the Farm.

But, Stanford
attracts good row
ers, too.
Chances are
you knew a few of
them in high
school. If not per
sonally, then you
might have
known them col-

lectively by the more popular
monikers jof "boat people", "crew
bies" or "the cult."
This year, my perceptions of
crew have changed dramatically.
While cult is somewhat extreme,
it's probably better that you don't
know them by any other name
than the one on their spandex
singlet.
Crew is, after all, the epitome
of team sports. There are no in
dividual superstars and a lack of
statistics that would drive Bill
James crazy.
Under the guidance of Aimee
Baker, now in her sixth year as
head coach, the Stanford women
are quietly in the middle of their
best season in history. Not to be
outdone, the men's team, led by

coach Craig Amerkhanian, has
also enjoyed a successful season.
If you're not too familiar with
crew, let me break it down for you,
sing-along style.
Row, row, row your boat...
Sounds easy enough, right?
Eight random graduate students
could row a boat, but try finding
eight people who can row a boat
2,000 meters in under seven
minutes.
For every few hours the varsi
ty-eight spends rowing its 60-foot
Resolute (that's boat to you), it
spends many more hours train
ing in and out of the water to
shave precious seconds off its
race time.
This is an amphibious team, it
conquers the stairs at Stanford Sta
dium and traverses Campus Drive
when it's not lifting weights or
practicing on the ergometer in
Ford Center.
And then there is the phrase
that makes me cringe like no other
when it comes to crew (except
maybe shopping with girls at J.):
morning practice.
Shudder.
Three days a week, the
women's team wakes up at 5:30
a.m., rows for over an hour in Red
wood City and then hits the er
gometer in the afternoon. Three
days a week, I struggle to get out of
bed for alO o'clock lecture.
1 find it somewhat impressive
that on morning-practice days the
team has already been as active as a

brain during REM sleep, while I'm
engaged in REM sleep! As Allen
Iverson so eloquently put it, "We're
talking about practice, man!"
We're talking about practice.
So, what about the off-season?
Yeah, right. The team will tell you
that, ifanything, practice is tapered
down during the spring season.
Gently down the stream...
A gentle path on the water is
the goal, but achieving said path is
easier sung than done. The
stream in this case is two kilome
ters long, sometimes lined with
buoys and often unforgiving. The
coxswain carefully guides the boat
with a string attached to the rud
der, while a single rower catching
the water the wrong way with the
oar is disastrous.
"Catching a crab" can result in

ihe person responsible for the
mishap to be completely thrown
tiom the boat and the difference
between a clean stroke and ab
solutely eating it is minute.
Although seat belts seem like
the logical solution to this prob
lem, there is some poetic justice in
a person getting soaked for his oi
lier mistake. Besides, I choreo
graphed a nice little "catching a
crab" dance at the crew formal — it
was priceless! But 1 digress.
