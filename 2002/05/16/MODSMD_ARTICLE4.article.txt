# Students remember Nakba
## Dozens gather in White Plaza to commemorate Palestinian refugees 
### BRENDAN MARTEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Yesterday, students gathered
in White Plaza to commemorate
Nakba Day. This annual time of
observation is well-known within
the Palestinian community. It is
intended to be a time of reflection
on 700,000 Palestinians who left
Israel during its war for indepen
dence during 1947 and 1948.
Palestinians claim they were ex
pelled by Jewish people but Is
raelis claim that Palestinians fled
of their own accord or were en
couraged b%other Arabs.
Today, the future of these peo
ple and their descendants is a
major sticking point between Is
rael and Palestine. Palestinians
want a "right 6f return" to Israel.
Israel claims that other Arabs are
keeping the Palestinians in
refugee camps.
Yael Ben-zvi, a doctoral stu
dent and one of the organizers for
the day's events, explained the
day's significance for Palestinians.
"This is not a celebration, but
rather a commemoration of a
tragic series of events in which
over 700,000 people became
refugees," Ben-zvi said.
The gathering featured Pales

tinian poetry readings, Arabic
music performances, a ceremony
dealing with the destruction of
Palestinian communities, a photo
exhibit depicting Palestinian soci
ety before the Nakba — which
means "catastrophe" in Arabic —
and several guest lecturers.
The Coalition for Justice in Is
rael / Palestine presented the
commemoration, along with the
assistance of the History Depart
ment and funding from the Grad
uate Student Council.
A statement concerning Nakba
Day issued by the group stressed
the group's emphasis and com
mitment toward diversity within
its ranks.
It described how its "member
ship includes Muslims, Jews,
Christians and other faiths; Stan
lord students, faculty, and com
munity members;, and Americans,
Palestinians, Israelis, and other
nationalities."
Ben-zvi said that the day's pre
sentation was planned "in a
packed room where one could
hear English, Arabic, and Hebrew
as people shared experiences,
thoughts and family histories
while working together."
She explained that the plan
ners of the event hope that Nakba
Day will inspire students to pay
closer attention to issues concern
ing the Middle East.
"As a student group the main
goal is to contribute to educating
the Stanford community about

the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and
the possible paths toward its solu
tion," Ben-zvi said. "We believe
that learning the history is neces--
sary for formulating responsible
approaches that are more likely to
encourage a solution of the
painful conllict impacting the lives
of many of us."
Fellow students expressed sim
ilar sentiments concerning Nakba
Day.
"I myself have always sympa
thized with the plight of the Pales
tinian people and appreciate the
efforts of organizations such as
this to raise awareness about these
incredibly important issues," said
Timnit Gebru, a freshman. "Accu
rate historical understanding is
something that should be striven
for by all."
Ben-zvi mentioned that not all
students though are necessarily
receptive to her group's view
point.
"We are presenting a part of his
tory that is often left untold and un
known, and for some people, this
may be difficult to hear, so we have
encountered some objections to
ward our work," Ben-zvi said.
But despite the potential for
controversy, students overall
seemed to be sympathetic to the
efforts and intentions of the event
coordinators.
"I think it is good that organi
zations are raising awareness
about the past in ways like this,"
said junior Srinivas Panguluri.
