# Senate selects its next Deputy Chair
## 
### JOHN HUETTER EDITORIAL STAFF 
At the second meeting — and first of
ficial meeting — of the ASSU Under
graduate Senate, the body elected Sena
tor Myisha Patterson to the post of Sen
ate Deputy Chair, debated what to do
about Senator Hiro Iwanaga's studying
abroad this quarter and dissolved a Sen
ate Committee.
2002-2003 Senate Deputy Chair selected
Patterson, a junior, ran against Sena
tors Connie Chen, a sophomore, and
Michael Brown 11, a freshman, for the
job, which involves working with the 12
freshmen Senate Associates, running
Senate meetings in Chair Bo Cowgill's
absence and sitting on the ASSU Execu
tive Committee.
"I've been dedicated to positively im
pacting the community," Patterson said.
"I'm really excited about this," she said.
Patterson has led and served such or
ganizations as the Stanford and Califor
nia National Association for the Ad

vancement of Colored People and the
Stanford Black Community Service
Center. Especially pertinent to the
Deputy Chair's work with freshmen sen
ate associates, she observed, was her
work as Coordinator of the BCSC Big
Sib/Lil' Sib program. She said that work
ing with the freshman associates would
be crucial because they would be the first
representative of the ASSU they see.
"I have learned as a leader that one
must be willing to serve in order to be
effective and to get the job done," Pat
terson said. "You must internalize and
become passionate about the issues
yon choose to take on. You must also
be passionate about the organization
you represent."
Patterson said that though she loved
the Stanford NAACP, which she has
been president of for the last two years,
she would step down to devote her time
to the Senate. "I feel called to be a leader
here," she said.
Ultimately, Patterson received 5
votes to Chen's 3 and Brown's 1, win
ning the position.

Senators going abroad debated again
The Senate debated whether or not
senators should be allowed to go abroad
for part of their term and under what, if
any, circumstances they could legiti
mately go abroad.
During the call, Iwanaga, a junior,
repeatedly asked the Senators to speak
up, since he was calling in from Japan
on a speakei phone. Senators gathered
into a group to stare at the speaker
phone from which Iwanaga's voice was
emerging. An excited senator almost
hung up on him by mistake.
"I want to be a senator," Iwanaga de
clared. "It was never my intention to be
come embroiled in such a debate,"
Iwanaga said." I know in a lot of ways this
wastes a lot of your time."
According to the (Constitution, as it has
been over 28 days since the election,
should Iwanaga be removed, he may not
be replaced by the senate candidate with
the 16th highest number of votes, ex offi
cio Senator Sarah Schulman.a freshman.
Some senators felt this was for the
best, stating that the decision over
whether or not to remove Iwanaga
should not be made solely to bring
Schulman (who tied Senator EUie
Martin for the 15th senate seat but
did not win the vote by the former
Senate to determine who would be
come a full senator) onto the Senate.
"I think some Senators have
looked at the situation with [Iwan
ga] as a way out of the situation be
tween Sarah Schulman and Ellie
Martin," Senator Caspar Martinez,
a freshman, said, and "not because
there's this genuine interest in that
the Senate runs well."
Controversy arose over whether
or not the previous Senate's actions
should be considered at all by the
new Senate.
"The last Senate is not this Sen
ate," Brown said.
Senator Brigitte Zimmerman, a
freshman, said that the former Sen
ate actions ought to be considered as
precedents or else the Senate would
engage in redundant arguments.
"[This debate] txx)k a lot of time last
year, and it's going to take a lot of
time today," she noted.
"The reason that the rule was
passed was to set a precedent," said
ASSU Vice President Nick Ro
driguez, a sophomore. I le said that
inissing meetings could be consid
ered failure to perform duties.
Cow gill noted that since the sen
ators were elected, they'd had a
"chair election, deputy chair elec
tion, committee chair elections, the
elections controversy and a lot of
orientation — formal and infor
mal."
"I think I can be an effective sen
ator," Iwanaga told the Senate. "I
will do whatever it takes to catch
up."
In a 10-0-0 vote on Jan. 29, last

year's Undergraduate Senate
passed a l)ill stating, "Elected Sena
tors should not plan to go abroad
during their term in office.
According to the minutes of the
Jan. 29 Senate's meeting, former
Senate Chair Alex Shvartsman said
that the senate would discuss plac
ing the motion in the by-laws; this
discussion never <occurred, and the
by-laws say nothing regarding sena
tors going abroad.
Iwanaga said that he knew about
the former Senate's decision re
garding senators going abroad but
decided to run, anyway. "I looked
into backing out of the SCTI pro
gram, but it just wouldn't have been
possible."
He said he had thought about
flying back fora couple of weeks so
as not to miss three meetings, but his
workload would probably prevent
it. He said he was told that there
wasn't a firm policy yet, nor "any
real conclusion about what the poli
cy was."
Iwanga mentioned that Director
of Student Activities (and Senate ad
visor) Nam i Howe had advised him
to run, and he said he had also spo
ken to Shvartsman about the deci
sion.
"I fe was voted in by the students
of Stanford," said Senator Ajani
Husbands, a freshman. "They had
faith in him whether or not he was
abroad."
Husbands also said that the pre
vious senate should have discour
aged Iwanga from going abroad
when it saw him listed as a candi
date, though whether the former
senate knew and whether or not it
could block someone from running
was debated.
"The issue is simply whether the
senate feels someone else could bet
ter serve the student body by being
available for the second half of the
quarter," Iwanaga said.
"My answer, obviously, is no. I
know there are others who are qual
ified, some of whom would be there

for the last few weeks of this quarter;
however, 1 firmly believe that de
spite my absence over the next few
weeks, I can be a valuable member
of the senate."
Budget and Finance
Committee dissolved,
Treasurer position made
Zimmerman introduced anoth
er bill to eliminate the Budget and
Finance Committee, which she said
did not have a "comparable work
load" to the other standing commit
tees.
"The 2001-2002 committee met
twice and accomplished virtually
nothing," the bill read. Instead,
Zimmerman proposed to create a
position of Senate Treasurer, to
which one of the Senators would be
elected.
The post would have primary
signing authority on Senate ac
counts, draft the body's budget, and
examine and advise upon Senate
spending.
In addition, the post would cre
ate currently nonexistent "commu
nication between the standing com
mittees about financial matters" and
"continuous records kept within the
committees about their finances."
"This issue has been hashed out,"
Zimmerman said.
Proposals to do the same were
constantly discussed by last year's
Senate but never carried out last
year amidst fears that the old pro
posals, which required regular
meetings between the Treasurer
and the various committee chairs,
would create too much of a beau
racracy.
Under the new proposal, howev
er, the Treasurer would merely be
given the power to call ad hex - meet
ings of committee representatives if
needed.
"A whole bunch of different shifts
in how we organize committees
have made it reasonable for this bill
to occur," said Chen.

signing authority on Senate ac
counts, draft the body's budget, and
examine and advise upon Senate
spending.
In addition, the post would cre
ate currently nonexistent "commu
nication between the standing com
mittees about financial matters" and
"continuous records kept within the
committees about their finances."
"This issue has been hashed out,"
Zimmerman said.
Proposals to do the same were
constantly discussed by last year's
Senate but never carried out last
year amidst fears that the old pro
posals, which required regular
meetings between the Treasurer
and the various committee chairs,
would create too much of a beau
racracy.
Under the new proposal, howev
er, the Treasurer would merely be
given the power to call ad hex - meet
ings of committee representatives if
needed.
"A whole bunch of different shifts
in how we organize committees
have made it reasonable for this bill
to occur," said Chen.
At the second meeting — and first of
ficial meeting — of the ASSU Under
graduate Senate, the body elected Sena
tor Myisha Patterson to the post of Sen
ate Deputy Chair, debated what to do
about Senator Hiro Iwanaga's studying
abroad this quarter and dissolved a Sen
ate Committee.
2002-2003 Senate Deputy Chair selected
Patterson, a junior, ran against Sena
tors Connie Chen, a sophomore, and
Michael Brown 11, a freshman, for the
job, which involves working with the 12
freshmen Senate Associates, running
Senate meetings in Chair Bo Cowgill's
absence and sitting on the ASSU Execu
tive Committee.
"I've been dedicated to positively im
pacting the community," Patterson said.
"I'm really excited about this," she said.
Patterson has led and served such or
ganizations as the Stanford and Califor
nia National Association for the Ad

vancement of Colored People and the
Stanford Black Community Service
Center. Especially pertinent to the
Deputy Chair's work with freshmen sen
ate associates, she observed, was her
work as Coordinator of the BCSC Big
Sib/Lil' Sib program. She said that work
ing with the freshman associates would
be crucial because they would be the first
representative of the ASSU they see.
"I have learned as a leader that one
must be willing to serve in order to be
effective and to get the job done," Pat
terson said. "You must internalize and
become passionate about the issues
yon choose to take on. You must also
be passionate about the organization
you represent."
Patterson said that though she loved
the Stanford NAACP, which she has
been president of for the last two years,
she would step down to devote her time
to the Senate. "I feel called to be a leader
here," she said.
Ultimately, Patterson received 5
votes to Chen's 3 and Brown's 1, win
ning the position.

Senators going abroad debated again
The Senate debated whether or not
senators should be allowed to go abroad
for part of their term and under what, if
any, circumstances they could legiti
mately go abroad.
During the call, Iwanaga, a junior,
repeatedly asked the Senators to speak
up, since he was calling in from Japan
on a speakei phone. Senators gathered
into a group to stare at the speaker
phone from which Iwanaga's voice was
emerging. An excited senator almost
hung up on him by mistake.
"I want to be a senator," Iwanaga de
clared. "It was never my intention to be
come embroiled in such a debate,"
Iwanaga said." I know in a lot of ways this
wastes a lot of your time."
According to the (Constitution, as it has
been over 28 days since the election,
should Iwanaga be removed, he may not
be replaced by the senate candidate with
the 16th highest number of votes, ex offi
cio Senator Sarah Schulman.a freshman.
Some senators felt this was for the
best, stating that the decision over
whether or not to remove Iwanaga
should not be made solely to bring
Schulman (who tied Senator EUie
Martin for the 15th senate seat but
did not win the vote by the former
Senate to determine who would be
come a full senator) onto the Senate.
"I think some Senators have
looked at the situation with [Iwan
ga] as a way out of the situation be
tween Sarah Schulman and Ellie
Martin," Senator Caspar Martinez,
a freshman, said, and "not because
there's this genuine interest in that
the Senate runs well."
Controversy arose over whether
or not the previous Senate's actions
should be considered at all by the
new Senate.
"The last Senate is not this Sen
ate," Brown said.
Senator Brigitte Zimmerman, a
freshman, said that the former Sen
ate actions ought to be considered as
precedents or else the Senate would
engage in redundant arguments.
"[This debate] txx)k a lot of time last
year, and it's going to take a lot of
time today," she noted.
"The reason that the rule was
passed was to set a precedent," said
ASSU Vice President Nick Ro
driguez, a sophomore. I le said that
inissing meetings could be consid
ered failure to perform duties.
Cow gill noted that since the sen
ators were elected, they'd had a
"chair election, deputy chair elec
tion, committee chair elections, the
elections controversy and a lot of
orientation — formal and infor
mal."
"I think I can be an effective sen
ator," Iwanaga told the Senate. "I
will do whatever it takes to catch
up."
In a 10-0-0 vote on Jan. 29, last

year's Undergraduate Senate
passed a l)ill stating, "Elected Sena
tors should not plan to go abroad
during their term in office.
According to the minutes of the
Jan. 29 Senate's meeting, former
Senate Chair Alex Shvartsman said
that the senate would discuss plac
ing the motion in the by-laws; this
discussion never <occurred, and the
by-laws say nothing regarding sena
tors going abroad.
Iwanaga said that he knew about
the former Senate's decision re
garding senators going abroad but
decided to run, anyway. "I looked
into backing out of the SCTI pro
gram, but it just wouldn't have been
possible."
He said he had thought about
flying back fora couple of weeks so
as not to miss three meetings, but his
workload would probably prevent
it. He said he was told that there
wasn't a firm policy yet, nor "any
real conclusion about what the poli
cy was."
Iwanga mentioned that Director
of Student Activities (and Senate ad
visor) Nam i Howe had advised him
to run, and he said he had also spo
ken to Shvartsman about the deci
sion.
"I fe was voted in by the students
of Stanford," said Senator Ajani
Husbands, a freshman. "They had
faith in him whether or not he was
abroad."
Husbands also said that the pre
vious senate should have discour
aged Iwanga from going abroad
when it saw him listed as a candi
date, though whether the former
senate knew and whether or not it
could block someone from running
was debated.
"The issue is simply whether the
senate feels someone else could bet
ter serve the student body by being
available for the second half of the
quarter," Iwanaga said.
"My answer, obviously, is no. I
know there are others who are qual
ified, some of whom would be there

for the last few weeks of this quarter;
however, 1 firmly believe that de
spite my absence over the next few
weeks, I can be a valuable member
of the senate."
Budget and Finance
Committee dissolved,
Treasurer position made
Zimmerman introduced anoth
er bill to eliminate the Budget and
Finance Committee, which she said
did not have a "comparable work
load" to the other standing commit
tees.
"The 2001-2002 committee met
twice and accomplished virtually
nothing," the bill read. Instead,
Zimmerman proposed to create a
position of Senate Treasurer, to
which one of the Senators would be
elected.
The post would have primary
signing authority on Senate ac
counts, draft the body's budget, and
examine and advise upon Senate
spending.
In addition, the post would cre
