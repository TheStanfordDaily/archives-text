## 
### JOHN HUETTER EDITORIAL STAFF 
At the second meeting — and first of
ficial meeting — of the ASSU Under
graduate Senate, the body elected Sena
tor Myisha Patterson to the post of Sen
ate Deputy Chair, debated what to do
about Senator Hiro Iwanaga's studying
abroad this quarter and dissolved a Sen
ate Committee.
2002-2003 Senate Deputy Chair selected
Patterson, a junior, ran against Sena
tors Connie Chen, a sophomore, and
Michael Brown 11, a freshman, for the
job, which involves working with the 12
freshmen Senate Associates, running
Senate meetings in Chair Bo Cowgill's
absence and sitting on the ASSU Execu
tive Committee.
"I've been dedicated to positively im
pacting the community," Patterson said.
"I'm really excited about this," she said.
Patterson has led and served such or
ganizations as the Stanford and Califor
nia National Association for the Ad

vancement of Colored People and the
Stanford Black Community Service
Center. Especially pertinent to the
Deputy Chair's work with freshmen sen
ate associates, she observed, was her
work as Coordinator of the BCSC Big
Sib/Lil' Sib program. She said that work
ing with the freshman associates would
be crucial because they would be the first
representative of the ASSU they see.
"I have learned as a leader that one
must be willing to serve in order to be
effective and to get the job done," Pat
terson said. "You must internalize and
become passionate about the issues
yon choose to take on. You must also
be passionate about the organization
you represent."
Patterson said that though she loved
the Stanford NAACP, which she has
been president of for the last two years,
she would step down to devote her time
to the Senate. "I feel called to be a leader
here," she said.
Ultimately, Patterson received 5
votes to Chen's 3 and Brown's 1, win
ning the position.

Senators going abroad debated again
The Senate debated whether or not
senators should be allowed to go abroad
for part of their term and under what, if
any, circumstances they could legiti
mately go abroad.
During the call, Iwanaga, a junior,
repeatedly asked the Senators to speak
up, since he was calling in from Japan
on a speakei phone. Senators gathered
into a group to stare at the speaker
phone from which Iwanaga's voice was
emerging. An excited senator almost
hung up on him by mistake.
"I want to be a senator," Iwanaga de
clared. "It was never my intention to be
come embroiled in such a debate,"
Iwanaga said." I know in a lot of ways this
wastes a lot of your time."
According to the (Constitution, as it has
been over 28 days since the election,
should Iwanaga be removed, he may not
be replaced by the senate candidate with
the 16th highest number of votes, ex offi
cio Senator Sarah Schulman.a freshman.
