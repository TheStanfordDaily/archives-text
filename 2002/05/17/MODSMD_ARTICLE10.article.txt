## Enough earthquakes 
### 
So you might have felt a little bit of
shaking Monday night. It was big
enough that those of you from out
of state who haven't felt an earth
quake before could call home and proud
ly say you had been through one. But it
wasn't so big that all living members of
your family would be calling you worried
about whether Stanford had fallen into
the sea.
For some of you, an earthquake was
something that you had subconsciously
been waiting for, curious about how it
would feel and desirous of joining the
"club." But longtime Californians, charter
club members, just sat back after Monday's
quake. After climbing out from under
desks or edging out of doorways, they

o o
knowingly said, "Yup,
that's an earthquake," be
fore going on to guess the
magnitude, epicenter and
fault line of the quake.
Fine. Everyone's felt a
moderate earthquake
now. Let's go back to col
lectively willing them not
to happen.
Monday's quake was

the good kind of earthquake, (he kind that
doesn't hurt anyone. If all earthquakes
were like that, you might even call them
welcome distractions, but there's an earth
quake of the bad variety on the way. Ex
perts say there is a 70 percent probability of
a devastating earthquake in the Bay Area
within the next 30 years.
Fora while after Oct. 17, 1989, people
thought that the Loma Prieta quake of that
day was the predicted Big ()ne. At a magni
tude of 7.1 on the Richter scale, it packed
about a thousand times the wallop of this
week's 4.9 trembler. But, alas, even that
calamity was just almost The Big One.
It's like being told by a fortune teller that
you're going to be hit by a large vehicle, get
ting hit by a bus, and then being told that,
no, the bus incident wasn't actually the
tragedy prophesied — there's still an 18-
wheeler on the way.
An 18-wheeler of an earthquake could
do a lot of harm around here. Just look at
how much damage the 1989 earthquake
caused. Monday's earthquake resulted in
the destruction of merchandise in some
stores near the Gilroy epicenter and one
San Jose house suffering a fire, but not
much else beyond that. The 1989 earth
quake, on the other hand, killed 62 peo
ple, injured around 4,000, displaced over
12,000 and caused approximately $6 bil
lion in damage.
Striking at 5:04 p.m., the 1989 quake oc
curred at rush hour. Most deaths happened
when the double decker Cypress Street sec
tion of InterstateBBo collapsed, sandwich
ing those on the lower deck. A section of the
Bay Bridge snapped tcx), resulting in its clo
sure fora month.
At Stanford, Memorial Church was

among the structures with serious damage.
11 reopened only in 1993. Other Main Quad
building also required extensive repairs, as
did parts of die Graduate School of Business
and the houses of Synergy, Colombae and
Phi Psi. The restored west wing of Green Li
brary opened just two years ago.
The Giants and As were playing each
other in the 1989 World Series. It was nick
named, ironically, the Bay Bridge Series.
Pans were waiting for the start of game three
of the Series in Candlestick Park when the
earthquake hit. Then, everyone knew it was
a major disaster, and the game was post
poned for 10 days. Monday, the earthquake
was so minor that neither players at the Gi
ants game nor in the Sharks playoff game
even realized there had been an earth
quake. Maybe seismologists should start
considering possible links between earth
quakes and playoff games.
Earthquakes may give a certain charm to
the area — you could see diem as proof that
very gcxid things always come with a cost.
And some people feel a certain pride from
braving Mother Nature's hidden threat.
But while Monday's shaker was the
largest in the region in a decade, the pre
dicted Big One threatens to replace 1989's
as the most damaging since 1906.11 won't be
a "good" earthquake.
Since we're not willing to evacuate for 30
years, I think we should take some bold
measures to back up our defiance. Compli
cating that, though, is the fact that unlike
hurricanes, tornadoes or asteroid impacts,
earthquakes can't be forecasted. And unlike
asteroid collisions, earthquakes can't be pre
vented with nuclear warheads.
Experts say to be prepared by storing
emergency supplies, securing objects safely
and building in quake-safe ways. ITiat's all
well and g(x>d, and we should do that, but
you'd think that in this day and age, we
could do something more proactive.
Ancient Greek philosophers said that
the earth floats on a sea and that turbu
lence in that sea causes earthquakes. The
Gabrielino tribe of Southern California
tells of how the Great Spirit created the
land on the backs of seven turtles, and
when the turtles argue and start swim
ming apart, the earth shakes. And in
Siberia, a tale is told of how the earth is
pulled on a dog sled, and when the dogs
stop to scratch their fleas, we feel it.
Let's build some supports in that sea
under the earth, give counseling to those
turtles and buy flea collars for those dogs.
Or we could try super-gluing the North
American and Pacific tectonic plates togeth
er, whatever works.
Probably, however, preparation for
earthquakes is a better shot today than pre
vention of earthquakes. Earthquakes are
humbling that way. Especially when they're
the bad kind.

An 18-wheeler of an earthquake could
do a lot of harm around here. Just look at
how much damage the 1989 earthquake
caused. Monday's earthquake resulted in
the destruction of merchandise in some
stores near the Gilroy epicenter and one
San Jose house suffering a fire, but not
much else beyond that. The 1989 earth
quake, on the other hand, killed 62 peo
ple, injured around 4,000, displaced over
12,000 and caused approximately $6 bil
lion in damage.
Striking at 5:04 p.m., the 1989 quake oc
curred at rush hour. Most deaths happened
when the double decker Cypress Street sec
tion of InterstateBBo collapsed, sandwich
ing those on the lower deck. A section of the
Bay Bridge snapped tcx), resulting in its clo
sure fora month.
At Stanford, Memorial Church was

among the structures with serious damage.
11 reopened only in 1993. Other Main Quad
building also required extensive repairs, as
did parts of die Graduate School of Business
and the houses of Synergy, Colombae and
Phi Psi. The restored west wing of Green Li

The Giants and As were playing each
other in the 1989 World Series. It was nick
named, ironically, the Bay Bridge Series.
Pans were waiting for the start of game three
of the Series in Candlestick Park when the
earthquake hit. Then, everyone knew it was
a major disaster, and the game was post
poned for 10 days. Monday, the earthquake
was so minor that neither players at the Gi
ants game nor in the Sharks playoff game
even realized there had been an earth
quake. Maybe seismologists should start
considering possible links between earth
quakes and playoff games.
Earthquakes may give a certain charm to
the area — you could see diem as proof that
very gcxid things always come with a cost.
And some people feel a certain pride from
braving Mother Nature's hidden threat.
But while Monday's shaker was the
largest in the region in a decade, the pre

as the most damaging since 1906.11 won't be
a "good" earthquake.
Since we're not willing to evacuate for 30
years, I think we should take some bold
measures to back up our defiance. Compli
cating that, though, is the fact that unlike
hurricanes, tornadoes or asteroid impacts,
earthquakes can't be forecasted. And unlike
asteroid collisions, earthquakes can't be pre
vented with nuclear warheads.
Experts say to be prepared by storing
emergency supplies, securing objects safely
and building in quake-safe ways. ITiat's all

land on the backs of seven turtles, and

stop to scratch their fleas, we feel it.
Let's build some supports in that sea
under the earth, give counseling to those
turtles and buy flea collars for those dogs.

So you might have felt a little bit of
shaking Monday night. It was big
enough that those of you from out
of state who haven't felt an earth
quake before could call home and proud
ly say you had been through one. But it
wasn't so big that all living members of
your family would be calling you worried
about whether Stanford had fallen into
the sea.
For some of you, an earthquake was
something that you had subconsciously
been waiting for, curious about how it
would feel and desirous of joining the
"club." But longtime Californians, charter
club members, just sat back after Monday's
quake. After climbing out from under
desks or edging out of doorways, they

o o
knowingly said, "Yup,
that's an earthquake," be
fore going on to guess the
magnitude, epicenter and
fault line of the quake.
Fine. Everyone's felt a
moderate earthquake
now. Let's go back to col
lectively willing them not
to happen.
Monday's quake was

the good kind of earthquake, (he kind that
doesn't hurt anyone. If all earthquakes
were like that, you might even call them
welcome distractions, but there's an earth
quake of the bad variety on the way. Ex
perts say there is a 70 percent probability of
a devastating earthquake in the Bay Area
within the next 30 years.
Fora while after Oct. 17, 1989, people
thought that the Loma Prieta quake of that
day was the predicted Big ()ne. At a magni
tude of 7.1 on the Richter scale, it packed
about a thousand times the wallop of this
week's 4.9 trembler. But, alas, even that
calamity was just almost The Big One.
It's like being told by a fortune teller that
you're going to be hit by a large vehicle, get
ting hit by a bus, and then being told that,
no, the bus incident wasn't actually the
tragedy prophesied — there's still an 18-
wheeler on the way.
