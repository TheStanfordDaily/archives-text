Where are the Palestinian peacemakers?
The pro-Palestinians who write to The
Daily forget that Jews have been continu
ously present in their land for far longer
than Islam or Christianity have been reli
gions, and that Abraham, the first He
brew, purchased land in the Hebron area
in biblical times. Palestinian national
claims are much more recent.
Those Jews who immigrated in this cen
tury fled from persecution in dozens of
countries, including virtually all European
and Arabian countries that now protest for
Palestinian suzerainty and vote for Arafat at
the United Nations. What would become of
these Jews under Palestinian leadership?
Would they be allowed to worship at their
own holy places? Probably not, based on
rhetoric read at www.memri.org.Where do
the Palestinians propose that these Jews
live? Germany? Russia? The United Suites?
What basis do they have for claiming the
whole land as their own?
Nonetheless, Zionists historically have
begged and pleaded with Palestinians to
accept a "half a loaf' compromise as ex
emplified by: the Peel Plan, the Partition
Plan, the Sharrett Plan, the Allon Plan, the
Barak Plan. Where are the Abaci Ha'ams,
Martin Bubers, Chaim Weizmans, Moshe
Sharrettsand Shimon Pereses of the Pales
tinian side? When they are found, the
world will be surprised how easy it really is
to beat swords into plowshares.

Stanford Israel Alliance should
be congratulated
Kudos to the Stanford Israel Alliance
for its reasoned, well-researched, histori
cally accurate and highly elucidating dis

cussion of the role played by Israel in the
Palestinian refugee problem. Their call to
the supporters of the Palestinian cause is
an enlightened plea to anyone and every
one involved in this conflict.

Junior replies to Shwilk
I write in reply to Dylan Schwilk's let
ter, in which he accused the Stanford Is
rael Alliance's guest column of racism. I do
not believe his claims are founded in any
sense of fairness and justice.
Arab leaders aggressively threatened
the lives of Jews leading up to the 1948
War of Independence. This occurred only
a few years after the Holocaust had so
shocked the Jewish community and the
world. In their zeal, the Arab leaders
asked Palestinians to leave their homes to
make way for an intense military drive.
The quotes in the editorial prove it.
Schilk also ignores another crucial
point of the editorial: Arab countries op
pressed and expelled 800,000 Jewish
refugees. By his own logic, the Arab coun
tries too are racist, believing in "ethnically
pure" states. Yet, nowhere in his letter
does he seem to mention that.
Then he writes "This is why constitutions
that protect minority rights are important."
As it tin ns out, the only democratic country
in the Middle East is Israel. Israel has a set of
"Basic Laws", which, among other things,
guarantee rights for all citizens. Israeli Arabs
have citizenship, they vote, and serve in par
liament and government ministries. Treat
ment of Israeli Arabs is certainly not perfect,
but it is far better than how the Arab coun
tries treated Jews.
Israel's Declaration of Establishment
states that the Jewish State "will ensure

complete equality of social and political
rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of
religion, race or sex; it will guarantee free
dom of religion, conscience, language,
education and culture."
I would, at this point, compare Jews
currently living in Arab countries with
Arabs living in Israel, but I can't, because
the Arab countries drove all the Jews out.
My parents, growing up in Egypt, were
demeaned and oppressed before they fled
the country in despair in the 1960'5, leav
ing virtually all their possessions behind.
There is another critical difference,
however. In a peace offer at Camp David,
Israel offered to repatriate refugees with
relatives in Israel, and offered large finan
cial compensation for the rest. Arab coun
tries have made no such offers with re
spect to Jewish refugees.
One more comment: Me accuses Israel
of thinking back in 1948 that "they [the
Arabs] are all the same." But at the time,
Syrians, Lebanese, Egyptians, Jordanians
amd Saudis had no separate identity, they
thought of themselves primarily as Arabs.
A distinct Palestinian national identity did
not emerge until the early 1960'5. Arab
writings are filled with references to
"brethren" in Palestine. This is not some
racist term the Jews made up.
The Stanford Israel Alliance column
was not racist at all. It merely told the side
of the story that the Naqba day protest
fails to mention.
I o move forward with the peace pro
cess, Arab countries must recognize the
role they too have played in the conflict,
instead of exclusively blaming Israel.
Only then will we find a just peace in the
Middle East.
There is nothing racist about that.
