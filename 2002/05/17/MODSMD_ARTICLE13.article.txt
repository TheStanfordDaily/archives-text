# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## ASSU officers respond to election improprieties 
### MATT BREWER, FILIPE SANTOS, ALEX SHVARTSMAN GEDIOEN ALOULA 
The following guest column is intended
to clarify the situation of the security of the
ASSU elections information.
The ASSU elections electronic voting
process was run on the ASSU Web server
by the Elections Commission and an ap
pointed member of the ASSU Tech
Group. A handful of ASSU officials have
privileged access to the Web server for the
purpose of updating content and manag
ing Web-based projects. This access to the
web server also enabled access to the elec
tion database. Since these ASSU officials
need to use the server for their normal ac
tivities, the Elections Commission did not
revoke their server privileges during the
election period. In hindsight this was a

mistake and measures are being taken so
that in the future only ASSU officials di
rectly involved in running the elections
will have access to the server.
From a complete review of the com
puter logs of both the server activity and
the ASSU officials with privileged access,
there'is evidence that only one ASSU offi
cial, Henry Towsner, entered the elec
tions database during the election period
and accessed information regarding voter
turnout. Towsner warned the Elections
Commission a few days before the elec
tion that people with access to the ASSU
server could enter into the Elections
Handbook. At the time the Elections
Commission did not realize that the same
privilege could also enable access to the
voting database during the elections and
saw no reason to restrict access to those of
ficials, who need to access the server for

their day-to-day responsibilities. Never
theless, Towsner's misuse of his server ac
cess privilege reflects very poor judgment
and is an abuse of the confidence deposit
ed on him by the ASSU.
The Executive Committee of the
ASSU is deeply disappointed by the acts
of Towsner. Even if only driven by cu
riosity, it was a mistake on his part to ac
cess voter turnout information, especially
given his active involvement with one of
the candidate slates. Regardless of his in
tent, the effect of Towsner's behavior
runs opposite to the integrity endorsed
by the ASSIJ and expected from ASSU of
ficials. Therefore, despite his prior com
mitment and dedication to the ASSU as
chair of the Nominations Commission,
this incident has called into question the
merit of his future involvement.
We strongly encourage executive and

legislative officers to take this incident
into consideration prior to nominating
or confirming Towsner to any official
ASSU position.
Based on the findings from our inves
tigation, we concluded that the results of
the ASSU elections were not under
mined and still hold as reflective of the
will of the student body. Towsner moni
tored only the overall voter turnout for
the presidential election in terms of
number of votes cast without the knowl
edge of who received these votes. After a
close scrutiny of his computer logs and
command lines history, there is no evi
dence that he accessed any other elec
tion information in readable form or
tampered with the election results. Un
less new and compelling information is
brought forward, we feel no need to fur
ther pursue this issue.

The ASSU is taking the necessary
steps to make sure that the elections pro
cess in the coming years runs with a high
er degree of security. Nevertheless, as
noted above, we believe that the integri
ty of the election results was not compro
mised by these events. The Elections
Commission recommended to the leg
islative bodies the certification of the
election, and both the Undergraduate
Senate and the Graduate Student Coun
cil unanimously confirmed the election
results. As outgoing officers, we hope to
leave the ASSU in the hands of those who
will preserve it with sound judgment and
unconditional integrity.
