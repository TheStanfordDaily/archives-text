### CYNTHIA CHO EDITORIAL STAFF 
Seven members of the Stanford Democ
rats went to Sacramento on Wednesday to
take a tour of the state capitol and meet with
state politicians.
The day included lunch with the presi
dent of California Young Democrats and
other young legislative staff as well as meet
ings with State Sen. Byron Sher, a former
Stanford professor, and Assemblymembers
Rebecca Cohn, Hannah Beth Jackson, and
Joe Simitian.
"The trip is sort of an 'up close' view of a lot
of the issues and people that we read about in
the newspaper," said senior Karen Brunton,
president of the Stanford Democrats. "I'he goal
was primarily to introduce younger Stanford
Democrats to the state capitol and to California
state politics."
It also allowed students to learn about future
employment opportunities in government.
"We hope to inspire students to pursue their

own careers in public service or elected office,"
Brunton said.
Executive board member Kim Cooper, a se
nior, has attended the event in the past and
said the trip gives students a chance to see the
state capitol from an insider's perspective.
"We [Stanford Democrats] consider our
selves an active, hands-on group and as such we
try regularly to meet and volunteer for local
politicians," Cooper said. "Any chance to in
crease our understanding of government and
how it works is always welcome."
One of the highlights of the trip, according
to Brunton, was seeing the message "Wel
come Stanford Young Democrats" on the
electronic board of the floor of the Assembly
when the Stanford Democrats went to meet
with Cohn.
"The trip helps our group feel connected to
the work we do. It also helps to ground us in the
real world of politics — seeing it in action, in
stead of talking about it inside the good old
Stanford bubble," Cooper said.
In the future, the Stanford Democrats hopes

to invite other students groups, such as Stan
ford in Government and Stanford Republicans,
to Sacramento.
"We hope to build on this goal and hope
fully get funding for the trip next year,"
Brunton said.
Currently, the Stanford Democrats pay for
all the expenses directly out of their own pock
ets because political and partisan student gro
pus are not eligible for campus funding.
The group's mission is to educate students
about political issues. They also aim to en
courage Stanford students to become in
volved in public service and social change,
and help elect Democratic candidates and
further the policies and goals of the Democ
ratic Party.
Some of the events sponsored by the Stan
ford Democrats include holding voter registra
tion drives on campus and volunteering on
local political campaigns. The group also in
vites guest speakers to campus and holds de
bates to educate Stanford students about De
mocratic issues.
