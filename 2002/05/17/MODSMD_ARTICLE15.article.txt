# Bush kept Sept. 11 attacks secret

WASHINGTON (AP) — Under fire from angry
lawmakers, the White House yesterday defended its
decision not to alert Americans to'information before
the Sept. 11 attacks that Osama bin Laden's terrorist
network wanted to hijack U.S. airplanes.
President Bush had received general, nonspecific
information during a vacation briefing at his ranch
Aug. 6 that bin Laden's group was considering hi
jackings, and he never considered making the infor
mation public, said National Security Adviser Con
doleezza Rice.
"You would have risked shutting down the Amer
ican civil aviation system with such generalized infor
mation," Rice said. "You would have to think five, six,
seven times about that, very, very hard."
Democrats led the calls for Bush to hand over the
top-secret CIA briefing he received in August about
the threats, saying it was important to know what he
had learned, and when. Lawmakers also called for the
release of an FBI memo before Sept. 11 that warned
headquarters that many Middle Eastern men were
training at at least one U.S. flight school.
"What we have to do now is find out what the
president — what the White Flouse — knew about
the events leading up to the events of 9-11, when
they knew it and. most importantly, what was done
about it," said House Minority Leader Dick

Gephardt, D-Mo.
Republican Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, vice
chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said, "There
was a lot of information. I believe and others believe,
if it had been acted on properly we may have had a
different situation on Sept. 11."
Rice described a series of threats uncovered by in
telligence officials, beginning in September of 2000
and reaching a height in the summer of 2001, that
dealt mostly with American interests overseas.
Those threats prompted a series of alerts from the
FBI to law-enforcement agencies and from the Fed
eral Aviation Administration to the nation's airlines
and airports, she said. There also were strong warn
ings to Americans to be careful overseas.
But Rice said the administration never considered
alerting the public to a possible hijacking threat at.
home, and had no idea that hijackers might consider
using an airplane as a missile in a suicide attack.
"In the pre-9-11 world, we never even considered
issuing a warning," Rice said.
Despite the statements that U.S. officials had no
warnings of suicide attacks with airplanes, The Asso
ciated Press reported in March that Filipino police
turned over to the United States in 1995 a confession
of convicted terrorist Abdul Hakim Murad in which
he proposed such an idea.
