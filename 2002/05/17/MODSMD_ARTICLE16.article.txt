# Suspects lead police to Daniel Pearl's body
## 
### 
KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) —
Three new suspects in the slay
ing of Daniel Pearl directed po
lice yesterday to a body they
claimed was that of the mur
dered Wall Street Journal re
porter.
Police unearthed the body
which had been buried in an
open field in a poor neighbor
hood on the Western edge of
Karachi. The body was kept at
the site while tests were con
ducted to determine the identi
ty, said a senior police official,
who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
No details were immediately
available about the three new
suspects, who were arrested yes
terday.
Four Islamic radicals have
been on trial since April 22 on
charges of murdering and kid
napping Pearl. They have
pleaded innocent.
Seven other men suspected
of holding Pearl hostage and
being involved in the killing
were being sought, but police
didn't say if the three new sus
pects were among them.
Pearl was abducted Jan. 23 in
Karachi, a southern port city. A
gruesome three-minute video
was delivered to U.S. officials a
month later showing his death.
After his disappearance, e
mails with photos of a captive
Pearl were sent to foreign and
local news publications. They
were signed by a previously un
known group demanding better
treatment for the suspected Tal
iban and al-Qaida men being
held in Guantanamo Bay Naval
Base, Cuba.
U.S. investigators traced the
e-mails to one of the defendants,
Fahad Naseem, who in turn
identified a British-born mili

tant, Ahmed Omar Saeed
Sheikh, as the mastermind, po
lice said. Naseem's cousin,
Salman Saqib, and former po
liceman Sheikh Mohammed
Adeel are also on trial.
The FBI was called in to assist
Pakistan soon after the 38-year
old Pearl was kidnapped.
The court trying the four sus
pects resumed its hearing yes
terday with the cross-examina
tion of two FBI agents by de
fense attorneys, who claim the
video showing Pearl's death is a
fake and should not be admitted
as evidence.
The trial is closed to re
porters, who have to rely on de
fense attorneys and prosecutors
for details of the proceedings.
Defense attorney Rai Bashir
said FBI video expert John Fal
gon admitted during testimony
that "such videos can be pre
pared through computers."
Fhe prosecution has called
several witnesses to try to make
its case that the defendants
lured Pearl to the restaurant in
Karachi from where he was kid
napped, took photographs of
him in captivity and then circu
lated the photographs and
threats via e-mail.
Saeed admitted his role in the
kidnapping during a pretrial
court appearance Feb. 14 but
later recanted. His statement is
inadmissible at the trial because
it was not made under oath.
The court was expected to
rule today on a prosecution re
quest to send a commission to
Europe to obtain a statement
from Pearl's widow, Mariane.
In early February, the discov
ery in Karachi of the body of a
light-skinned man in his late 30s
led to initial media reports that it
was Pearl's.
