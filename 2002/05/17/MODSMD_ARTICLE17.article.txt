## Cardinal travels south to write its L.A. story 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Fitting, isn't it? In the land of movie scripts
and blockbuster endings, Pacific 10 Confer
ence baseball showcases its highest drama
and suspense of the season this weekend as
four teams battle in six games to determine,
in true Los Angeles fashion, "who's who" in
the league championship race.
In Westwood's Jackie Robinson Stadium,
the second-place and seventh-ranked Cardi
nal (35-15,11-7 Pac-10) looks to gain valuable
ground with just two weekends remaining in
the regular season by beating up on the
mediocre UCLA Bruins (25-29,8-10).
Across town at Dedeaux Field, No. 19 South
ern California will attempt to maintain its
two-game lead over both Stanford and up
start Washington when it hosts Arizona State,
which dropped two of three at Sunken Dia
mond last weekend.
When the umpires call "Play ball!" at both
ballparks tonight — though "Action!" might
be more appropriate — the conference tide
will be on the line, with the Cardinal and

Huskies needing some help from Arizona
State to take title hopes into the Pac-10's final
weekend.
For Stanford, this weekend's matchup
with the Bruins looms large on two fronts —
the conference race, and its chance to become
a national seed in the upcoming NClAATour
nament. After losing a 13-12 slugfest Tuesday
afternoon in Reno, Stanford needs a very
strong showing and at least a second-place fin
ish in the league in order to secure home-field
advantage throughout the playoffs leading up
to the College World Series in Omaha, Neb.
The Cardinal can make it a peifect 6-0 sea

three games from the Trojans in a
non-conference series at Dedeaux
Field in late March. Stanford hasn't
faced the Bruins in Jackie Robinson
Stadium for three years due to a
scheduling adjustment, but the Car
dinal's first trip to Westw(X)d since
1999 will certainly not be without
consequence.
In order to stay in the hunt fora
Pac-10 championship, Stanford will
need to see some consistency out of its
bullpen. In Tuesday afternoon's loss,
the Cardinal watched its top six re
lievers surrender 13 runs on 16 hits
and walk six. Only senior lefthander
Dan Rich, who pitched two innings of
three-hit ball against the Wolf Pack,
escaped without allowing a run.
With a team ERA of 4.24, Stan
ford pitching has been serviceable
in 2002. However, much of that
production has come from its trio
of starting pitchers, which boasts a
22-4 record and a 3.89 ERA. While
junior Jeremy Guthrie has been his
usual superb self on the mound the
entire year, fellow junior Tim Cun
ningham has been as on-and-off as
a strobe light. Last week, however,
Cunningham shut down Arizona
State for seven innings and earned
his first career Pac-10 Pitcher of the
Week honor.
At the plate, the Cardinal has
seemingly righted a ship that
seemed lost during April. Leading
the charge is sophomore center-field
er Sam Fuld, who used a 3-for-5 per
formance in Reno to give him 10
multiple-hit games in his last 11, and
16 in his last 18. During the month
long stretch, Fuld is hitting .528 and
has moved into first place on Stan
ford's career batting list with a .370
average in two seasons on the Farm.
If Fuld and Stanford's outstand
ing starting pitching corps can
manage a three-game sweep in Los
Angeles beginning tonight, the Car
dinal could be in store fora come
from-behind conference title wor
thy of a Hollywood screenplay.
