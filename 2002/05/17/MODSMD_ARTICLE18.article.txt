# Unexpected team brings home title

### TERRY HURLBUTT STAFF WRITER 
I've always associated bad
minton with hoop skirts.
I thought of badminton as a
lawn game played by genteel
ladies on idyllic summer days in
expansive English gardens. It
was proper and delicate and,
well, easy.
It was not furious and fast
paced. People weren't sup
posed to sweat and dive and
swear. Aid, the game wasn't
supposed to be so darn hard.
Foolish me.
Stanford can add another na
tional championship to its ever
growing collection thanks to an
unlikely hero — the Stanford
badminton team.
On April 26 and 27, the team
traveled to Eastern Illinois to
finish the season at the Colle
giate Championships, where the
men's team captured the nation
al title.
Captain Seth Elliot finished
second in the individuals and
then paired up with teammate
Josh Wong to win the men's dou

and prolific showing.
Elliot and Wong beat a
strong Howard team that ac

the Stanford pair pulled off the
third-game win to give them
the match, even after Wong
pulled his hamstring in the last

game.

balls that are hindered by the er
roneous weight of the feathers
glued to their sides.
Don't let their erratic move
ments tool you — getting that
ball to go where it belongs re
quires a skill and precision that
1, at least, just don't have.
The team hones its game
through dedication, practicing
four days a week at two to three
hours a session.
Their roster is a remarkable
listing of diversity — while only
undergraduate and graduate
students are allowed to com
pete in the team's league
matches, professors and staff
members are proud partici
pants as well.
The team always welcomes
new players and you can join
even if you've never picked up a
racket or a shuttlecock.
As the second-most popular
sport in the world partic ipation
wise, behind soccer, you'll have
plenty of company. And if the
thought of a 200 mph shuttle
cock coming at you is frighten
ing, rest assured, the rest of the
