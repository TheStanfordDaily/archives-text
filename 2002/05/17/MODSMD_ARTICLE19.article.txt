students were still asleep, the No. 2
women's tennis team (24-1) was
busy advancing to the quarterfi
nals of the NCAA Championships.

WOMEN'S TENNIS

Thursday: No. 2 Stanford 5,
No. 17 Kentucky 1

The Cardinal, who is hosting
the championships this year, de
feated No. 17 Kentucky (18-9), 5-
1, in an 8 a.m. match.
The Wildcats put a scare into
the Cardinal early, winning two of
three doubles matches tojump out
to an early 1-0 lead.
Stanford's senior duo of Lau
ren Kalvaria and Gabriela Las
tra, ranked first nationally by a
wide margin, fell in an 8-3 shock
er to the very sharp No. 8 tan
dem of Caronlina Mayorga and
Sarah Witten.
Sophomore Lauren Barnikow
and freshman Erin Burdette,
ranked 14th in doubles, recorded
a dominant 8-0 shutout win over
Leigh Bradwell and Lauren
Rookledge in the second flight,
but senior Keiko Tokuda and
freshman Story Tweedie-Yates
were unable to come back against
No. 60 Jill Buckley and Amy Tre
fethen in the decisive third-flight
match, losing 8-4.
"They jumped right on us from
the get-go in doubles," said head
coach Lele Forood. "The impor

tant thing is, we came back strong."
A nervous crowd and a high
spirited Wildcats squad were
quickly reminded in singles,
though, who the defending NCAA
champions are. Stanford won the
first set in all six matches, winning
36 of 43 games.
Burdette, ranked No. 13 in sin
gles, clinched her fourth-flight
match against Trefethen quickly,
6-1, 6-1. No. 6 Lastra's volleying
and strong net play catapulted her
to a 6-1, 6-1 win over No. 60 Wit
ten in the second-flight and a de
termined No. 4 Kalvaria slammed
past No. 44 Mayorga, 6-1, 6-3 in
the first flight.
In a unique situation, sopho
more Emilia Anderson clinched
the Stanford victory by winning
her No. 6 singles match at the
same time as Tokuda had the win
ning point in play in her fifth-flight
match. The officials decided that
Anderson's point would be the
clincher, but since Tokuda's win
ning point was in play when the
match ended, that her victory
would count as well.
Anderson won 6-1, 6-2 over
Bradwell, and Tokuda triumphed
over Buckley, 6-0, 6-3. No. 16
Barnikow had a 6-3, 2-3 edge on
No. 86 Rookledge when her
match was abandoned due to
Stanford's clinching the victory.
Today at 11 a.m., the third
seeded Cardinal plays seventh
seeded, seventh-ranked North
Carolina (25-4), which defeated
No. 10 Arizona State, 4-1, yester
day morning.
The Cardinal hopes to improve
on its doubles performance, and to
retain its singles dominance.
"Today's loss [in doubles] was
really important," Kalvaria said.
"We know what to work on now."
