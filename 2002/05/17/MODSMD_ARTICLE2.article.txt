# Fans camp out for Star Wars
## 
### RAMIN SETOODEH EDITORIAL STAFF 
A long time ago at a multi-plex not so
far away, sophomores Brian Decker
and Carolyn Quam started waiting in
line for the new "Star Wars" movie,
"Episode II: Attack of the Clones."
The duo arrived at the Century 16
Theatres in Mountain View with a tent,
sleeping bags and sandwiches Tuesday
night at 10 p.m., a full 26 hours before
the first showing of the George Lucas
film at 12:01 a.m. yesterday morning.
"We were the first in line," Quam
said.
"I missed two classes and work,"
Decker said.
But they weren't alone. More than
100 Stanford students took a break
from lectures and campus life to
stand in line at local theaters for
hours so they would be guaranteed
seats to the first showing of the much
anticipated movie.
A few miles away, in front of the AMC
Mercado in Santa Clara, freshmen Sean
Duffy and Brenna Corbett unloaded
camping gear Tuesday night in front of
the theater. They were welcomed by a
group of adults who had been waiting
for three days and were cooking burg
ers in the parking lot.
"It was really cold," Duffy said. "We
ended up walking to Denny's at 1 a.m.
— we jumped over fences and running
across the street.
"But I wanted the experience of wait

ing with the fans," Duffy had said while
waiting to see "Episode II."
Some friends arrived in the morn
ing. Unlike Quam and Decker, who
never left their spot at the front of the
line, these students had a different plan:
They waited in shifts so nobody would
miss too many classes.
"I got here about 2 p.m.," said fresh
man Manu Lakkur on Wednesday af
ternoon. Lakkur then switched places
with Duffy and Corhett.
Although the movie would not start
for hours, he was excited — occasionally
looking away from his copy of Erich
Maria Remarque's "All Quiet on the
Western Front," required I HUM read
ing that helped him pass the time, into
the growing crowd.
Like many students, Lakkur and his
friends had bought tickets online a week

or more before the screening. But he
was willing to wait in line for 10 hours
anyway, to make sure that his friends
would all get good seats together.
"This is the movie that will make it or
break it for the series," Lakkur said. "I
read a bunch of reviews, both good and
bad. All you hope is that it's entertaining."
Freshmanjohn Krzywicki, who wait
ed with Lakkur, said he also had high
hopes.
"I think we'll all enjoy it," Krzywicki
said. "The thing is, the 'Star Wars'
movies have never had good reviews —
so we're not disappointed yet."
Back at Stanford, a group of students
at Castano prepared to leave campus at
5:30 p.m. on Wednesday for the movie.
Sophomore Bernardo Malfitano
spent an hour applying red and black
make-up to look like Darth Maul. He

joined the handful of serious fans at
each theater who dressed up like a "Star
Wars" characters on opening night.
"Darth Maul has really cool make
up," Malfitano said, as he looked at a
picture of the character on a book
mark to make sure that he had all the
lines in the right place. "If I dress up a
Jedi or something, it's still me. With
him, I'm not wearing a mask — and
it's not my face either."
Malfitano, who grew up in Brazil,
said that he has been a "Star Wars" fan
his entire life — and first saw the orig
inal three movies with Portuguese
subtitles.
Senior Leah Goodman walked into
his room to confirm where their tickets
are located. She was dressed like

Sophomore Brendan Malfitano spent an hour Wednesday afternoon applying red and black make-up to dress up as "Star Wars"
villain Darth Maul.
Princess Leia, with her hair in two
round buns.
"We knew we'd been doing this
fora while," Goodman said.
She remembered that three
years ago, she waited with Stanford
friends for many hours in line to
see "Episode 1: The Phantom Men
ace" when it was released in 2000.
"I had an official Princess Leia
costume I wore then," Goodman
said. She has since shipped it home,
and improvised with black pants
and a leather jacket.
When Malfitano, Goodman and
a group of friends arrived in Moun
tain View at around 7 p.m. on
Wednesday, they were already be
hind about 200 tans who have lined
up before them.
At the front of the line, Quam
and Decker were seated together in
a lawn chair. Some of their room
mates and friends from Stanford
have joined them.
With only five hours left until
show time, their spirits were high.
"We started camping out for
'About a Boy,' and then people told
us that 'Star Wars' is coming up,"
Decker said with a smile.
The two spent all night in the
tent, and said the cold weather did
not bother them.
"But people were heckling us

last night," Decker said. "Then,
after the theater closed, there was
nobody here. 1 was like, 'We're
going to die."'
Sophomore Ken Segna, Deck
er's roommates, had brought them
food at noon, and they ate pizza for
dinner.
"They delivered," Decker said.
"We told them we're at the front of
the theater, and they said, 'Sure.' "
Quam and Decker pointed to
Segna as the big "Star Wars" fan in
their group.
"I want good seats," Segna said.
A crowd of more than 1,000
people had gathered at the Mer
cado Theater by 9 p.m. Wednes
day. The movie was shown as a
special engagement on 19 screens
at 12:01 a.m. Thursday, and then
dropped down to five screens for
the rest of its first-week run.
Theater Managing Director
Michael Tieger said he knew open
ing night would be popular with
the fans.
"I think it's a 'Star Wars' thing,"
Tieger said. "There was one the
ater in New York where people
have been waiting for six weeks."
Junior Justin Svec, who was
waiting near the front of the iine,
said that all seven students in his
first-year ancient Greek class came
to the movie together.
"We brought a chess set, home
work and a football to pass the
time," Svec said.
The class even convinced their

professor Bill Tieman to join them.
"I'm here because they wanted
to see the movie and 1 like doing
things together outside of class,"
Tieman said. "I'm looking forward
to the light saber fight."
Junior Jason Rheins was the first
person in the group to arrive.
"I've been here holding the
spot since 2:36 p.m.," Rheins
said. "I'm intrigued by the ro
mance relationship."
A theater employee announced
that the movie would begin in two
hours and 10 minutes and the
crowd erupted in cheers.
Further down the line, junior
Mark Gebhard Hipped through
class notes, under a streetlight.
He was studying fora midterm
in his chemical engineering class
the next day.
"I'm not worried," Gebhard
said. "It's open-book. But I'm fin
ishing my problem set that is due
tomorrow."
One hour before show time at
Mountain View, the line had be
came so long that fans wrapped
around the back of the building. A
group of students gathered under
a streetlight behind a dumpster,
doing homework.
"I just want to catch up," said
sophomore Eun Sang Hwang, with
a book in his hand." 1 did really bad
on the last exam."
Many fans were waving green
light sabers. A group of people
watched "Episode I: The Phan

torn Menace" on a flat big-screen
projected against the outside wall
of the theater.
Malfitano and his friends held
hands and danced in a circle.
"We're dancing the Congress of
Vienna — it's a choreographed
waltz," said senior Katy Barglow.

"We know how to have fun. But
the high point of the night will be
getting through the doors"
Junior Mike Stat put on his
Anakin Skywalker helmet. Then
there was an announcement from
the front of the line and a roar of
cheers.

"We moving," Stat shouted.
The students stopped dancing
and grabbed their backpacks from
the ground.
"Oh my God," Barglow said.
"Every one is going in now. I grew
up watching 'Star Wars.' This is re
ally exciting."
