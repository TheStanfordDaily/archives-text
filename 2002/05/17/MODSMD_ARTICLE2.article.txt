# Fans camp out for Star Wars

### RAMIN SETOODEH EDITORIAL STAFF 
A long time ago at a multi-plex not so
far away, sophomores Brian Decker
and Carolyn Quam started waiting in
line for the new "Star Wars" movie,
"Episode II: Attack of the Clones."
The duo arrived at the Century 16
Theatres in Mountain View with a tent,
sleeping bags and sandwiches Tuesday
night at 10 p.m., a full 26 hours before
the first showing of the George Lucas
film at 12:01 a.m. yesterday morning.
"We were the first in line," Quam
said.
"I missed two classes and work,"
Decker said.
But they weren't alone. More than
100 Stanford students took a break
from lectures and campus life to
stand in line at local theaters for
hours so they would be guaranteed
seats to the first showing of the much
anticipated movie.
A few miles away, in front of the AMC
Mercado in Santa Clara, freshmen Sean
Duffy and Brenna Corbett unloaded
camping gear Tuesday night in front of
the theater. They were welcomed by a
group of adults who had been waiting
for three days and were cooking burg
ers in the parking lot.
"It was really cold," Duffy said. "We
ended up walking to Denny's at 1 a.m.
— we jumped over fences and running
across the street.
"But I wanted the experience of wait

ing with the fans," Duffy had said while
waiting to see "Episode II."
Some friends arrived in the morn
ing. Unlike Quam and Decker, who
never left their spot at the front of the
line, these students had a different plan:
They waited in shifts so nobody would
miss too many classes.
"I got here about 2 p.m.," said fresh
man Manu Lakkur on Wednesday af
ternoon. Lakkur then switched places
with Duffy and Corhett.
Although the movie would not start
for hours, he was excited — occasionally
looking away from his copy of Erich
Maria Remarque's "All Quiet on the
Western Front," required I HUM read
ing that helped him pass the time, into
the growing crowd.
Like many students, Lakkur and his
friends had bought tickets online a week

or more before the screening. But he
was willing to wait in line for 10 hours
anyway, to make sure that his friends
would all get good seats together.
"This is the movie that will make it or
break it for the series," Lakkur said. "I
read a bunch of reviews, both good and
bad. All you hope is that it's entertaining."
Freshmanjohn Krzywicki, who wait
ed with Lakkur, said he also had high
hopes.
"I think we'll all enjoy it," Krzywicki
said. "The thing is, the 'Star Wars'
movies have never had good reviews —
so we're not disappointed yet."
Back at Stanford, a group of students
at Castano prepared to leave campus at
5:30 p.m. on Wednesday for the movie.
Sophomore Bernardo Malfitano
spent an hour applying red and black
make-up to look like Darth Maul. He

joined the handful of serious fans at
each theater who dressed up like a "Star
Wars" characters on opening night.
"Darth Maul has really cool make
up," Malfitano said, as he looked at a
picture of the character on a book
mark to make sure that he had all the
lines in the right place. "If I dress up a
Jedi or something, it's still me. With
him, I'm not wearing a mask — and
it's not my face either."
Malfitano, who grew up in Brazil,
said that he has been a "Star Wars" fan
his entire life — and first saw the orig
inal three movies with Portuguese
subtitles.
Senior Leah Goodman walked into
his room to confirm where their tickets
are located. She was dressed like
