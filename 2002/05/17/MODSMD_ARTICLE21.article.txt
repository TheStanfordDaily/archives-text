# Stanford begins title defense
## 
### DAN URBAN STAFF WRITER 
Capping a season of personal bests and school
records, one of the strongest men's track squads in
Stanford history enters the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships, which will be held at Washington
State on May 18 and 19.
At last year's championships hosted by Califor
nia, the Cardinal pulled off a dramatic upset victo
ry, winning the conference title 142-136 over
Southern California.
Seventy-four of those points came in the middle
distances and long distances, led by a one-through
four Cardinal sweep in the 1,500 meters. The win
ner of that race, senior Gabe Jennings, will be back
to defend his Pac-10 title along with junior Jesse
Thomas, who won last year's 3,000-meter steeple
chase, and junior Michael Ponikvar, the conference
high jump champion.
The Cardinal also boasted the top-four finishers in
the 1,500 meters in 2001, and could deliver a similar
performance in the 5,000 meters this year. Senior
Jonathon Riley leads the conference in the event, fol
lowed by teammates sophomore Grant Robison and
juniors Louis Luchini and Seth Hejny.
Stanford is also poised to score points outside of the
distance races. Junior Omer Inan is ranked second in
the conference in the discus, junior Milton Little ranks
third in the long jump and junior Nick Welihozkiy is
fifth in the hammer throw.
Scoring points across a wide range of events is key
in a large meet like the conference championships,
which makes the placement of athletes in events a mat
ter of great strategic importance.

Stanford's strategy last year paid off with a surprise
victory, and director of track and field Vin Lananna
plans to stick to the same tactics this year.
"We have not approached this year's meet any dif
ferently than last year's meet," Lananna said.
Strategy may be a moot point for the Cardinal
and most every other Pac-10 team this year, as
UCLA is expected to dominate both the men's and
women's competitions.
Anything is possible, however, as championship
meets can be very unpredictable.
"If we are careful about the placement of our ath
letes, then we will set our men up to sneak into the top
scoring position if UCLA and others falter," Lananna
said. "It is our hope to score over 100 points and we
will see where that places us."
While taking the conference title in back-to-back
years would be thrilling, being named the top team in
the conference is secondary on the Cardinal's agenda.
Like all of the season's previous meets, the con
ference championships serve as an opportunity, in
this case the Cardinal's final opportunity, to qualify
athletes for the NCAA Championships.
Lananna says he plans to place his athletes in
events accordingly.-
While most of the track squad members nervously
await the upcoming weekend, two are already done.
Sophomore Lillian Bush and freshman Ahisha
Modari finished sixth and eighth, respectively, in the
heptathlon and the Pac-10 Multi-Event Champi
onships last weekend.
"We always make the decisions which are in the best
interest of the athletes," Lananna said. "Our plan will
be to place the athletes in the best events for each per
son and hope that it maximizes points."
