# Peralta captures accidental revolution in 'Dogtown'
## 
### MARISA TAYLOR 
What began as a way for
a group of surf-obsessed
teens from broken homes
to entertain themselves
during summer afternoons
turned into an unprece
dented international phe
nomenon in the early '70s.

In his new film, "Dogtown and Z-boys,"
Skateboard legend-turned-filmmaker Stacy
Peralta documents the birth of modern
skateboarding through the eyes of its acci
dental revolutionaries.
These skateboarders, as Peralta says,
"took the roads of the 20th century and
made art out of [them]." Peralta's film, nar
rated by Sean Penn, is a montage of histori
cal background, interviews with the skaters
themselves, and old clips from the '70s fea
turing the skaters in their heyday, creating
fascinating, unparalleled movements that
came naturally to them in the air and on the
pavement.

The transition from surfing to what is
seen as modern, vertical skateboarding

began in a section of
southern Santa Moni
ca, Calif., dubbed
"Dogtown." An inno
vative surfer named
Jeff Ho opened a surf
shop in the early '70s
where he crafted

avant-garde surfboards and formed the
Zephyr surf team, comprised of the most
daredevil surfers in the area. Ho's shop on
the corner of Bay and Main streets became
a clubhouse of sorts where local teens would
spend their afternoons after the optimal
surf hours of the morning had passed.
This new wave of young Dogtown surfers
crafted their own skateboards out of ply
wood and old clay wheels and formed the
Zephyr skate team, aiming to imitate on
their skateboards the motions of the surfers
they idolized, particularly those of Hawaiian
surf champion Larry Bertleman. When a
particularly bad drought ravaged Southern

California that summer, the Zephyr team
took to sneaking into backyards to skate in
dried-up swimming pools. The challenge of
hitting and making it over the rim of the
pool became the catalyst that made Z-boys
such as Jay Adams, Tony Alva and Stacy
Peralta international superstars when they
entered national skateboarding competi
tions and blew their audiences away.
"Dogtown and Z-boys" feels a bit like a

propaganda film, in which one can't
help but worship the kids of the
Zephyr team because Stacy Peralta has
made it impossible not to. Watching
the Z-boys with their long, sun
streaked hair, making faces at the cam
era and throwing themselves effort
lessly into the air while backed by the
likes of Jimi Hendrix and Neil Young
makes the viewer feel blessed to even
be included in their coterie of incredi
ble coolness. These kids are portrayed
as rebels, as bad boys, as artists who
solely aspired to create beautiful
movement and turned their sun-

burned noses up at the conventional and
the mundane. In what feels like an endless
summer, Peralta weaves the tales of the Z
boys' lives into a legend.
Sometimes the propaganda feels a bit too
self-aggrandizing, as if the fame and the
sponsorship got too heady for all. In count
less interviews with the boys, now all grown
up, they compare each other to Michael Jor-



The drought was tough on everyone's hair that year
