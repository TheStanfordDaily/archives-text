# Taking quality 'Time Out'
## 
### KIM SAMEK 
Laurent Cantet of
fers a beautiful medita
tion on middle-class life
in his latest film "Time
Out." Aurelien Recoing
plays Vincent, a man
who, after losing his job,

tells his family he quit to take a prestigious position
at the United Nations. He crafts a facade that he
keeps up for months, making weekly trips to
Switzerland. He informs himself of the details of his
spurious job by walking through an office building,
listening to snippets of meetings and studying the
employees' actions through their glass walls. In the
meantime, he wanders aimlessly in his car, often
sleeping in it. He is too restless to look fora real job.
Vincent begins to convince his former col
leagues, friends and his father to give him money,
and they are far too eager to hand him checks. In
stead of investing it, he buys a new car and lives ex
travagantly, handing his kids large sums of cash.
Despite his back-stabbing scheming, it is not diffi
cult to sympathize with Vincent. He is a compelling
character, appealing to that part of all of us that is
simply tired.
Many scenes in "Time Out" are gorgeously shot
— low-key and slow, but never boring. The images
of voyeurism are particularly effective; there are
countless scenes in which Vincent watches his fam
ily through the glass doors of his house or when he
watches his son practice judo through a window.
Through these subtle scenes, the audience is able to
appreciate the emotional complexities of his situa
tion. He becomes a stranger to his family as they
catch on to his lies. His children's fear of him is de
picted especially well as they stand facing him,
afraid to speak or touch him. These short scenes
contain what is lacking in Hollywood — simplicity.
One only has to see the looks on their faces to un
derstand Vincent has fallen out of his "father" role
in the same way he has fallen out of the role of work
ing-class man.
It is in these scenes dealing with Vincent's rela
tionship to his family that "Time Out" is strongest.
His wife, Muriel (Karin Viard), too, becomes made
a stranger in his life and must observe him from

afar, carefully watching his conversations with oth
ers, alarmed by his strange behavior. The brilliant

acting of Recoing and Viard as well as their
three onscreen children captures the nuances
of the family's trouble, grounding " Time
Out" 's deeper philosophical concerns in a
real human story.
Although beautifully executed, "Time
Out" is not without flaws. It is difficult, for ex-

ample, to keep track of where Vincent is during his
travels. There are shots of him at a cabin in the
woods, driving through the Alps, at his grandpar
ents' house and in office buildings, but it's unclear
which of these locations are in Geneva, his home
town in France, or a third city. Secondly, there are
far too many scenes depicting Vincent's ennui. The
movie is 132 minutes long and contains perhaps
half an hour of extraneous or redundant footage
which strays from the main theme of his estrange
ment from his family. It would have been wiser for
Cantet to have cut many of the scenes in which Vin
cent schemes to make money — less is more, con
sidering this aspect of the film is the least believable.
However, the flaws are not so disruptive that
they bother you after the credits begin rolling. In
stead, you are left with images such as him walking
alone through feet of white snow or watching his
family carry on with their everyday activities in his
absence. The theme of voyeurism resonates well
with the style of the movie — the audience too feels
like voyeurs let in on his darkest secrets, watching
him after he has fallen out of a normal way of living.



You! Go to your room for time out!
