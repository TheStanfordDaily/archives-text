In"The Cat's
Meow," director
Peter Bogdanovich
presents ns with yet
another boring depic
tion of the immoral,
decadent Hollywood

lifestyles of the rich
and famous. Set in 1924, the movie fol
lows the events of a doomed yacht trip
that is a veritable gathering of Holly
wood's finest, including media mogul
William Randolph Hearst, actress
Marion Davies (Hearst's young mis
tress, played by Kirsten Dunst), Char
lie Chaplin (who is suspected of having
an affair with Davies) and producer
Thomas Ince. The obsessed "W.R."
Hearst spies on them through secret
peepholes on his yacht, afraid of losing
his precious mistress to the man infa
mous for his womanizing.
Bogdanovich does a pretty awful
job keeping the audience engaged.
The characters' free-spirit Hollywood
attitude, among other things, is super
ficial. Hie characters are so opaque
that is difficult to be convinced of their
actions. The nagging feeling of artifi
ciality that one experiences when view
ing "The Cat's Meow" is not a good
sign considering that the movie is
based on a true story. It is also interest
ing to note that Marion Davies, Willy
Randolph and Charlie Chaplin also
served as inspiration for Orson Welles
in "Citizen Kane."
The movie's largest flaw is the lack
of depth in its portrayal of the love tri
angle between Hearst, Davies and
Chaplin. We never understand how
their relationships function. The au
dience is shown many ambiguous
shots of Charlie chasing after Marion.
We see them showing some affection
toward each other, but it is impossible

to tell whether his feelings for her are
genuine or whether she is simply

being played. Even
worse, it is unclear
whether we are to
sympathize with
Hearst in his many
sobbing scenes as
he repeatedly

catches his obses
sion with Charlie. Should we be root
ing for him? Should we feel sorry for
Marion? Hearst is, after all in his 50s,
wealthy and in a position of power
over the young Davies.
Certainly the middle 1 (M) or so min
utes could have been used more wise
ly to fill the audience in on character
motivations as well as add nuances to
the boring Hollywood stereotypes.
Many of the scenes are redundant. So
many of them illustrate Charlie's fool
ish seduction of Marion — chasing
her, writing her letters, dancing with
her — all, of course, in plain view of
Hearst. The movie then cuts to a close
up of Hearst and — surprise, surprise
— his lips are shaking and he is close to
tears. Every single time.
Kirsten Dunst does a fine job as
Davies, although her character is as at
least as unpleasant as the others. The
characters on board refer to Marion as
"spunky," but really she's just annoy
ing and dumb like the other female
characters, with the exception of the
narrator — a writer who lades into the
background during the drama.
There is one redeeming aspect to
the movie. It begins with a scene at a
funeral, so the audience is told early on
someone will die. Instead of wonder
ing who the murderer is, the audience
is left to wonder who will be killed —
an interesting twist to the standard
murder-mystery format. However,
after 10 minutes or so, you may be sit
ting there hoping all of them die.
