Dolores Huerta, co-founder of the United Farm
Workers Union, will speak today at the 17th annual
Ernesto Galarza Commemorative Lecture at the
Francs C. Arrillaga Alumni Center.
"Huerta is considered one of the great women
labor organizers in 20th century American history
and the right-hand person to Caesar Chavez," said A1
Camarillo, director of the program in comparative
studies in race and ethnicity.
Huerta and Chavez founded the Robert F.
Kennedy Medical Plan, the Juan De La Cruz Farm
Worker Pension Fund, the Farm Workers Credit
Union, the first medical and pension plan and credit
union for farm workers and the National Farm Work
ers Service Center, an affordable housing and Spanish
language radio organization.
Along with her work to improve conditions for farm
workers, Huerta was crucial for the passage of legisla
tion that allows people to vote in Spanish and take dri
ving tests in their native language.
The commemorative lecture was established by
the Stanford Center for Chicano Research in 1986
in memory of Galarza, one of the first Mexican
American graduates. She attended Stanford during
the 19205.
Galarza was a Mexican American author, com
munity organizer, scholar, labor leader and an in
tellectual.
"He was a pioneer in the fields of ethnic studies,
labor organizing, and community organization advo
cacy," Camarillo said.
