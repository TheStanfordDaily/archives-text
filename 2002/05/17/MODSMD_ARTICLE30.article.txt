# Nolan's latest sure to keep audiences awake
## 
### NATHAN LASCHE 
When I first saw Christopher Nolan, I
was struck by how young and openly enthu
siastic the writer / director is. One would ex
pect the mastermind of the groundbreaking
film "Memento" to be somewhat more
brooding and mysterious. But as he greeted
three other journalists and me with a wide
smile, 1 realized that just as in"his films, what
one's mind sees and expects can be very dif
ferent from the truth.
Nolan began making films at age seven
using his father's super Bmin camera. His
first feature film "The Following" which he

made in 1998, cost $6,000 and won nu
merous independent film festival awards,
which allowed him to then make the larger
(but still tiny on a Hollywood scale) "Me
mento" lor $5 million. "Memento" was a
critical and commercial success, garnering
Nolan an Oscar nomination and a Golden
Globe nominations for Best Screenplay.
Nolan's latest project is the $50 million
thriller "Insomnia," starring A1 Pacino,
Robin Williams and 1 Hilary Swank. The film
is about a seasoned Los Angeles cop (Pacino)
who travels to Alaska to conduct a murder
investigation, and ends up in a cat-and
mouse game of blackmail and deceit with
the murderer (Williams). Although on the
surface, "Insomnia" appears to be a fairly
cliched suspense movie, on closer examina
tion there are several variations and twists
added to the concept which makes the idea
fresh and entertaining. The following are
excerpts of an interview I had with Nolan.

INTERMISSION: How would you de
scribe "Insomnia" to a blind audience?
NOLAN: I'd describe it as a psychological
thriller that takes you into the experience of
a protagonist who finds himself in a very un
familiar environment and is subjected to a
lot of intense psychological pressure from
an unexpected angle.
INTERMISSION: It was very interesting to
cast Robin Williams as the criminal element
in the film, because you don't see him in that
role very often. I was wondering what at
tracted you to him for the role?
NOLAN: What attracted me to casting him
was having cast A1 Pacino as the veteran
cop, you've created a very weighty, iconic
figure, and the dynamic of the film is such
that you need to balance that, because
everything is about the balance between
those two characters. The balance arises not
from them being the same, but from them
arriving at a similar place from completely
different directions. So what we were look
ing for was someone who would be striking
in terms of balance, but coming at it from a
very different angle. So Robin seemed ideal
for that. 1 was very excited about that, and
I always assumed someone in the studio
would say "no, that's crazy," but nobody
ever did it. I think one of the reasons for
that was because when we read the script it
was very clear that when they first meet,
you should be thinking "Why are these two
guys together? The conversation they're
having is totally unacceptable. What are
they doing here?" And having Robin
Williams and A1 Pacino onscreen 1 think
just reinforces that. Their whole "star bag
gage" just feeds into that dynamic and that
feeling of inappropriate contact.
INTERMISSION: Was there anyone else
vou considered for Robin Williams' role?

NOLAN: Not really, be
cause Robin and 1 both saw
the character in very much
the same way, as a very ordi
nary guy, because to me
that's the aspect in the film
that Robin hasn't done be
fore. He's playing somebody
that is very ordinary, so lie's
the gny sitting next to you on
the bus that you don't notice,
he's the guy getting off the el
evator with you. That to me
is what makes it ultimately
very frightening and very
chilling because he's so every
day, so banal, and yet he's ca
pable of what he's capable of
and he's sort of crossed this
line and you don't know
quite where he's going to go
with it.
INTERMISSION: What

were the benefits and
challenges of work
ing on a much big
ger-budget film than
anything else you've
done previously?
NOLAN: With a big
ger crew, more loca
tions, bigger stars,
you're jumping
through more
hoops, and there's
just an overall sense
of an increased grind
and the shoot ends
up being more than
twice as long. For ex
am pie, "Memento"
only took 25 days
and this took 54,
which is still pretty
short, but by the end

of it, you're pretty exhausted. So that was
different, but overall, the process of moving
from small film to big film has been reassur
ingly similar. Creatively it's all about figur
ing out what shots you need to tell the story,
and I take comfort in the interior nature of
that process.
INTERMISSION: I was interested in the
fact that "Insomnia" takes place entirely
in daylight, and this is very unique for
suspense movies. What kind of effect
were you going for with all the action
happening in daylight even in such a sus
penseful setting?
NOLAN: Well, I saw an opportunity to cre
ate a very dark film with the use of om
nipresent daylight. When you think about
it, when you're shooting in a dark interior,
you have to have all the lights on, so the
scene actually becomes very light and even
in exteriors you have to find significant

sources of illumination. Whereas if you have
light seeping through a window you can cre
ate quite dark silhouettes and a very shad
owy environment, and that was the direc
tion we wanted to take it with daylight seep
ing in around the edges the whole time. And
this gave us some kind of metaphor for Pa
cino's character's fear of exposure, which is
important in the film and becomes more
and more pervasive.
INTERMISSION: So what's next on the
slate for you?
NOLAN: At the moment I'm working on a
script about Howard Hughes for Jim Car
rey to act in.
INTERMISSION: What advice would you
give to aspiring filmmakers?
NOLAN: Enjoy the process of making a
film, because the truth is it's just as valid to
make a tiny independent film as it is mak
ing a big studio film. In my mind, my very

first film is absolutely as
valid as the one I've just
finished. So I think it's a
shame that people see it
[tiny, self-financed
films} only as a stepping
stone to other things.
You'll miss it when it's
gone, you really will. 1
mean ii's one of these
things I can tell people
and they won't believe
it but you really will
miss it when it's gone.
It's partly freedom, and
partly just a different
type of responsibility.
People ask me "Do you
want to do another in
dependent film" and I
say, "Yeah, sure," but
it's never going to be
the same.

in terms of balance, but coming at it from a
very different angle. So Robin seemed ideal
for that. 1 was very excited about that, and
I always assumed someone in the studio
would say "no, that's crazy," but nobody
ever did it. I think one of the reasons for
that was because when we read the script it
was very clear that when they first meet,
you should be thinking "Why are these two
guys together? The conversation they're
having is totally unacceptable. What are
they doing here?" And having Robin
Williams and A1 Pacino onscreen 1 think
just reinforces that. Their whole "star bag
gage" just feeds into that dynamic and that
feeling of inappropriate contact.
INTERMISSION: Was there anyone else
vou considered for Robin Williams' role?

NOLAN: Not really, be
cause Robin and 1 both saw
the character in very much
the same way, as a very ordi
nary guy, because to me
that's the aspect in the film
that Robin hasn't done be
fore. He's playing somebody
that is very ordinary, so lie's
the gny sitting next to you on
the bus that you don't notice,
he's the guy getting off the el
evator with you. That to me
is what makes it ultimately
very frightening and very
chilling because he's so every
day, so banal, and yet he's ca
pable of what he's capable of
and he's sort of crossed this
line and you don't know
quite where he's going to go
with it.
INTERMISSION: What

were the benefits and
challenges of work
ing on a much big
ger-budget film than
anything else you've
done previously?
NOLAN: With a big
ger crew, more loca
tions, bigger stars,
you're jumping
through more
hoops, and there's
just an overall sense
of an increased grind
and the shoot ends
up being more than
twice as long. For ex
am pie, "Memento"
only took 25 days
and this took 54,
which is still pretty
short, but by the end

of it, you're pretty exhausted. So that was
different, but overall, the process of moving
from small film to big film has been reassur
ingly similar. Creatively it's all about figur
ing out what shots you need to tell the story,
and I take comfort in the interior nature of
that process.
INTERMISSION: I was interested in the
fact that "Insomnia" takes place entirely
in daylight, and this is very unique for
suspense movies. What kind of effect
were you going for with all the action
happening in daylight even in such a sus
penseful setting?
NOLAN: Well, I saw an opportunity to cre
ate a very dark film with the use of om
nipresent daylight. When you think about
it, when you're shooting in a dark interior,
you have to have all the lights on, so the
scene actually becomes very light and even
in exteriors you have to find significant

sources of illumination. Whereas if you have
light seeping through a window you can cre
ate quite dark silhouettes and a very shad
owy environment, and that was the direc
tion we wanted to take it with daylight seep
ing in around the edges the whole time. And
this gave us some kind of metaphor for Pa
cino's character's fear of exposure, which is
important in the film and becomes more
and more pervasive.
INTERMISSION: So what's next on the
slate for you?
NOLAN: At the moment I'm working on a
script about Howard Hughes for Jim Car
rey to act in.
INTERMISSION: What advice would you
give to aspiring filmmakers?
NOLAN: Enjoy the process of making a
film, because the truth is it's just as valid to
make a tiny independent film as it is mak
ing a big studio film. In my mind, my very

first film is absolutely as
valid as the one I've just
finished. So I think it's a
shame that people see it
[tiny, self-financed
films} only as a stepping
stone to other things.
You'll miss it when it's
gone, you really will. 1
mean ii's one of these
things I can tell people
and they won't believe
it but you really will
miss it when it's gone.
It's partly freedom, and
partly just a different
type of responsibility.
People ask me "Do you
want to do another in
dependent film" and I
say, "Yeah, sure," but
it's never going to be
the same.


Wide-eyed and openly enthusiastic


"If Pacino touches your ass again, I'll beat him to a pulp."


"Man, don't you remember me? I'm the director!"
When I first saw Christopher Nolan, I
was struck by how young and openly enthu
siastic the writer / director is. One would ex
pect the mastermind of the groundbreaking
film "Memento" to be somewhat more
brooding and mysterious. But as he greeted
three other journalists and me with a wide
smile, 1 realized that just as in"his films, what
one's mind sees and expects can be very dif
ferent from the truth.
Nolan began making films at age seven
using his father's super Bmin camera. His
first feature film "The Following" which he

made in 1998, cost $6,000 and won nu
merous independent film festival awards,
which allowed him to then make the larger
(but still tiny on a Hollywood scale) "Me
mento" lor $5 million. "Memento" was a
critical and commercial success, garnering
Nolan an Oscar nomination and a Golden
Globe nominations for Best Screenplay.
Nolan's latest project is the $50 million
thriller "Insomnia," starring A1 Pacino,
Robin Williams and 1 Hilary Swank. The film
is about a seasoned Los Angeles cop (Pacino)
who travels to Alaska to conduct a murder
investigation, and ends up in a cat-and
mouse game of blackmail and deceit with
the murderer (Williams). Although on the
surface, "Insomnia" appears to be a fairly
cliched suspense movie, on closer examina
tion there are several variations and twists
added to the concept which makes the idea
fresh and entertaining. The following are
excerpts of an interview I had with Nolan.

INTERMISSION: How would you de
scribe "Insomnia" to a blind audience?
NOLAN: I'd describe it as a psychological
thriller that takes you into the experience of
a protagonist who finds himself in a very un
familiar environment and is subjected to a
lot of intense psychological pressure from
an unexpected angle.
INTERMISSION: It was very interesting to
cast Robin Williams as the criminal element
in the film, because you don't see him in that
role very often. I was wondering what at
tracted you to him for the role?
NOLAN: What attracted me to casting him
was having cast A1 Pacino as the veteran
cop, you've created a very weighty, iconic
figure, and the dynamic of the film is such
that you need to balance that, because
everything is about the balance between
those two characters. The balance arises not
from them being the same, but from them
arriving at a similar place from completely
different directions. So what we were look
ing for was someone who would be striking
in terms of balance, but coming at it from a
very different angle. So Robin seemed ideal
for that. 1 was very excited about that, and
I always assumed someone in the studio
would say "no, that's crazy," but nobody
