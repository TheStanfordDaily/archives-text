# Aspiring Stanford star scores radio hit
## By ERIK WONG

Since her single "Love Goes On" hit commercial
radio in February, Natalise — better known on cam
pus as junior Robin Nathalis Chow — now wishes
there were two of her to go around. One to go to
school and carry out plans to graduate early this
June, and the other to finish recording in the studio,
rehearse choreography sets nightly, and, oh yeah,
perform at local gigs and record release parties.
Natalise is just your average Stanford pop star.
During the summer before her sophomore year,
she dumped her very generic pre-med ambitions
in order to hook back up with her "first love" —
pop music.
Fora girl who trained in opera at the San Francis
co Conservatory of Music and sang in her high school
jazz band, one might ask how Natalise, also a piano
player since age 4, decided to launch her music ca
reer on the strength of a dance pop single she
recorded last year when she was just 18.
"I just want to sing," she said. "At first, I experi
mented with a couple of styles. But in the end, the
decision was to go with pop / dance because it fits my
voice and my personality."
Radio listeners in the San Francisco liay Area be
came acquainted with Natalise's youthful, sweetheart
vocals in late February, when KYLD 94.9 FM, an
urban hits radio station in San Francisco, picked up
"Love Goes On" and gave it some airplay.
KYLD mixing deejay Strawberry recalled on a re
cent broadcast how Natalise's debut single became an
unexpected hit.
"We threw ["Love Goes On"] on the air . . . Fri
day? Thursday? And look what we got: phone lines
blowin' up about it!" he said. "We didn't even think
it was gonna get into rotation."
"Love Goes On" showcases Natalise's angelic yet
dynamic voice over the typical dance pop fare that is
the essential combo of pulsing club beats, a panoply
of feisty synth effects and serious flanging. Listen
closely and you can hear Natalise singing the entire
three-part harmony plus loudspeaker-fied back
ground mantra for the chorus, which repeatedly re
assures us that despite its two-faced nature, "Love
goes on / and on / and on . .

The evening her song debuted on KYLD, Natalise
was at home in Hillsborough, California, some 20
miles north of Stanford. She was listening to the
radio while getting ready fora Friday night out.
"It was like 9:45, I heard the intro to my song and
I wasn't sure if it was really me," she said. "When it
dawned on me, I was like, 'Oh my god, oh my god,'

and I screamed hella loudly down
stairs, 'Mom, I'm on the radio!"'
Since then, the Stanford junior
has been pulling a nonstop sched
ule that squeezes in classes, re
hearsals, time in the studio record
ing her upcoming debut album, an
internship at Universal Records
and supporting the month-old
compilation album "Import Jams,"
on which her single "Love Goes
On" is the lead track.
When describing how she bal
ances the many different parts of
her life, Natalise notes, in her
Northern California vernacular,
that she works "hella hard."
She recalls being shy when she
was young, but Natalise credits
some of her early recitals at the
San Francisco Conservatory of
Music for pushing her to shake off
timidity.
"It was so hard at first," she said.

"But they forced me to perform. It
was the best thing they could have done for me, in
retrospect."
You can still hear lingering traces of the coy
young girl that Natalise once was, tucked away in the
soft nuances of her vocals. Like Janet Jackson, the
artist she would most like to model her career after,
Natalise's voice moves across you like a dulcet ca
ress, delivering high notes playfully and with a
touch of attitude.
Cherubic Natalise experiments with Britney
esque vocals on "Heat of Passion," a potential track
for her upcoming album, on which the songstress
says she will have a hand in some of the songwriting
and production.

The sultry, mid-tempo "Heat of Passion," Natalise
points out, is "definitely one song I didn't write." In
it, she tries to seduce you because, well, she's feeling
the heat of passion. "Instead of wasting time / Let's
stop the game / Just give in to the heat of passion /
Just relax and let me take control."
Natalise has worked with producer Jaines "Jae-E"

Farley, who produced MC Hammer, En
Vogue and One Voice, the first all-
Asian female vocal group to be signed to
a major label in the U.S.
It is one of Natalise's top priorities to
sign with a major. However, she was
somewhat discouraged given her initial
dealings with the record industry. Two
years ago, before she signed with inde
pendent label 888 Records, industry ex
perts slammed the door in Natalise's
face and told her that the majors were
closed to Asian artists.
"Some of the people I talked to said,
'We don't want to sign you or any other
Asian artist because it just won't sell,'"
Natalise said. "They told me things like,
'America isn't ready for an Asian artist.'"
Natalise was at once heartbroken and
angered at the industry's lack of confi
dence in an entire race of recording
artists. She has vowed to make label ex
ecutives eat their words.
"I think mainstream America is ready

for an Asian artist, but it's the record la
bels who aren't willing to make the investment and
who don't know how to market one," Natalise said.
"If I make it big, then yes, I will add to the 'Asian
presence' in the industry, but I just feel like I'm
going to be myself and they can accept that if they
want to," she added. "My goal is to have my music
transcend my identity."
She also expressed gratitude fora management
team that she thinks is working to help her music get
to that point of transcendence.
"I'm fortunate enough to have managers behind
me who have become personal friends, like fami
ly," Natalise said. "1 trust them, but they know
where I stand."


"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this
wall!"
