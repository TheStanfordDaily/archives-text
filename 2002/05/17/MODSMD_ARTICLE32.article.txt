# 'Great Emancipator' entertains on SCBN
## 
### KAREEM GHANEM 
During winter break, juniors Mike Pappas, Ben Fried
land and Chris Van Dyke began work on "The Lincoln Re
port," a half-hour sketch comedy show that airs on SCBN,
Stanford's television network. For the sake of honesty, I'll
be upfront in saying that my expectations of the show were
low, mainly because sketch comedy shows can be very hit
or-iniss. Joining the trio on the second floor of the SCBN
studio for an advance screening, however, 1 was impressed.
"The Lincoln Report" is adventurous, creative and fresh. It
is also very funny.
The show's roots can be traced to the friendship that has
developed between Pappas, Friedland and Van Dyke over
the course of their time here at Stanford.
"We lived together freshman year. And last year. And
this year," explained Friedland.
"And next year," added Van Dyke.
Last year, KZSU News Director Frank Yell offered the
three friends the opportunity to do a very short comedy
segment on the radio. From there, Pappas, Friedland and
Van Dyke began to imagine how they could take their seg
ment to television.
"On the radio," said Friedland, "you get locked into a
very specific type of joke."
Van Dyke added, "It's really hard to establish setting or
even characters on the radio."
And the name of the show? Pappas said, "In the room
that Ben and I lived in, we had four pictures of Abra
ham Lincoln."
"The Great Emancipator," interrupted Friedland.
"Yeah," continues Pappas, "and there was one picture
on each wall of the room. The pictures were absolutely
huge, and since that was the room we began writing in, we
decided to call the show 'The Lincoln Report.'"
Each episode of the"The Lincoln Report" consists of
about six sketches, where the start and conclusion of each
sketch is spliced together with the others. You might watch
the beginning of one sketch and then, 15 minutes later,
after a couple of other sketches, watch its conclusion. This
is a similar format to what you might see on Comedy Cen
tral's "Kids In The Hall," a favorite of the group. It gener
ally gives the show a sense of continuity and anticipation.
When it comes to sketch comedy, the most obvious point
of reference for most people is, of course, "Saturday Night
Live." However, Friedland explained that, "It's really
tough to use 'Saturday Night Live' as a model fora couple
of reasons. Namely, it relies almost exclusively on current
events and political or celebrity satire." Given the"The Lin
coln Report'"s production schedule, it would indeed be dif
ficult to satirize the news. By the time production is com
pleted, an episode often airs a couple of months after the
sketches have been written.

The show's comic sensibility seems like it would be more
appealing to college students than anyone else. That cer
tainly makes sense given the group's background as Stan
ford students. Van Dyke said that he sometimes describes
the show to friends as "'American Pie'-type humor." How
ever, though the sketches often contain somewhat raunchy
themes and obvious jokes — in one skit, a student kicks his
roommate out of the room in order to have sex with a dog
— they are also often quite clever. The scene that opens the
second episode, for example, introduces a convenience
store clerk and manager, both of whom almost have a ner
vous breakdown when a customer asks for milk and there

isn't any in the store. Another particularly memorable
sketch features a protagonist who has a hoof instead of a
right hand.
"As much as the second episode relies somewhat on
weird humor, the first was pretty vulgar. Lots of'dick-and
fart jokes,'" said Friedland.
Pappas interjected, "No 'fart'jokes, actually."
"Okay, no 'fart' jokes, but definitely 'dick'jokes. Lots
of masturbation," replied Friedland before chuckling
and declaring, "Let's just say that we write about what
we know."
However, the group knew very little when it began de
veloping the show and each episode takes a considerable
amount of time to complete. None of the three had any ex
perience with television or with comedy before. Production
takes three main steps: writing, filming and editing. Writ
ing a skit lakes about an hour. This is followed by another

four to six hours filming, depending on the complexity of
the skit, and then by another four to six hours on the edit
ing computer. Given that each episode contains six skits on
average, the group spends quite a bit of time together.
Though the camaraderie they share often helps in the
writing process, Pappas admitted, "It's a constant struggle
to figure out whether an idea is funny because it's a joke
we've been telling each other or if it's something that some
one else would find funny."
Watching the group interact, however, it is clear that
they also feel comfortable being honest with one another.
At one point, Friedland pokes fun at Pappas, who plays the

dog lover mentioned above. Mentioning a cut
where the dog buries its nose in Pappas' crotch,
Friedland remarked, "I thought you said there
was some nose-to-sack contact there. You
wanted to film that scene a couple more times
if I recall."
"Yeah," replied Pappas, playing along, "I
thought about applying some peanut butter to
my body and letting the dog have some fun."
As of right now, the show's future is some
what unclear. Pappas, Friedland and Van
Dyke have tentative plans to air three episodes
a quarter fora total of nine episodes in the
coming year. However, since they will all be
graduating at the end of next year, they do not
know whether the show will continue once
they've left. "At this pCFint," said Van Dyke,
"We're pretty much happy with the way it's
going. If we get burnt out doing it, we might
slow down. But who knows? We might get
more into it as well."
Speculating about the distant future,
Friedland says, "Beyond Stanford, I think
we're all interested in writing comedv, but

that's certainly a long way off."
In the short term, however, the show's prospects are
promising. With two solid episodes under its belt, the trio
has gained significant insight into improving the show.
"Part of the experience of making the first two episodes,"
explained Van Dyke, "has been learning how to take into
account our editing and filming limitations. Basically, we're
learning how to do this the right way."
Watching "The Lincoln Report" with a couple of
friends in my dorm, reactions seemed to be very positive.
Friedland says, "It's been tough getting to an audience be
yond our immediate group of friends. I suspect that the
way people will get to know about the show is through
word of mouth."
As long as the group continues working the way it does,
that shouldn't be a problem at all. "The Lincoln Report"
airs each night at 10:00 p.m. on SCBN, Channel 5.


They'll hire anyone at the CoHo these days.

the skit, and then by another four to six hours on the edit
ing computer. Given that each episode contains six skits on
average, the group spends quite a bit of time together.
Though the camaraderie they share often helps in the
writing process, Pappas admitted, "It's a constant struggle
to figure out whether an idea is funny because it's a joke
we've been telling each other or if it's something that some
one else would find funny."
Watching the group interact, however, it is clear that
they also feel comfortable being honest with one another.
At one point, Friedland pokes fun at Pappas, who plays the

dog lover mentioned above. Mentioning a cut
where the dog buries its nose in Pappas' crotch,
Friedland remarked, "I thought you said there
was some nose-to-sack contact there. You
wanted to film that scene a couple more times
if I recall."
"Yeah," replied Pappas, playing along, "I
thought about applying some peanut butter to
my body and letting the dog have some fun."
As of right now, the show's future is some
what unclear. Pappas, Friedland and Van
Dyke have tentative plans to air three episodes
a quarter fora total of nine episodes in the
coming year. However, since they will all be
graduating at the end of next year, they do not
know whether the show will continue once
they've left. "At this pCFint," said Van Dyke,
"We're pretty much happy with the way it's
going. If we get burnt out doing it, we might
slow down. But who knows? We might get
more into it as well."
Speculating about the distant future,
Friedland says, "Beyond Stanford, I think
we're all interested in writing comedv, but

that's certainly a long way off."
In the short term, however, the show's prospects are
promising. With two solid episodes under its belt, the trio
has gained significant insight into improving the show.
"Part of the experience of making the first two episodes,"
explained Van Dyke, "has been learning how to take into
account our editing and filming limitations. Basically, we're
learning how to do this the right way."
Watching "The Lincoln Report" with a couple of
friends in my dorm, reactions seemed to be very positive.
Friedland says, "It's been tough getting to an audience be
yond our immediate group of friends. I suspect that the
way people will get to know about the show is through
word of mouth."
As long as the group continues working the way it does,
that shouldn't be a problem at all. "The Lincoln Report"
airs each night at 10:00 p.m. on SCBN, Channel 5.


They'll hire anyone at the CoHo these days.
During winter break, juniors Mike Pappas, Ben Fried
land and Chris Van Dyke began work on "The Lincoln Re
port," a half-hour sketch comedy show that airs on SCBN,
Stanford's television network. For the sake of honesty, I'll
be upfront in saying that my expectations of the show were
low, mainly because sketch comedy shows can be very hit
or-iniss. Joining the trio on the second floor of the SCBN
studio for an advance screening, however, 1 was impressed.
"The Lincoln Report" is adventurous, creative and fresh. It
is also very funny.
The show's roots can be traced to the friendship that has
developed between Pappas, Friedland and Van Dyke over
the course of their time here at Stanford.
"We lived together freshman year. And last year. And
this year," explained Friedland.
"And next year," added Van Dyke.
Last year, KZSU News Director Frank Yell offered the
three friends the opportunity to do a very short comedy
segment on the radio. From there, Pappas, Friedland and
Van Dyke began to imagine how they could take their seg
ment to television.
"On the radio," said Friedland, "you get locked into a
very specific type of joke."
Van Dyke added, "It's really hard to establish setting or
even characters on the radio."
And the name of the show? Pappas said, "In the room
that Ben and I lived in, we had four pictures of Abra
ham Lincoln."
"The Great Emancipator," interrupted Friedland.
"Yeah," continues Pappas, "and there was one picture
on each wall of the room. The pictures were absolutely
huge, and since that was the room we began writing in, we
decided to call the show 'The Lincoln Report.'"
Each episode of the"The Lincoln Report" consists of
about six sketches, where the start and conclusion of each
sketch is spliced together with the others. You might watch
the beginning of one sketch and then, 15 minutes later,
after a couple of other sketches, watch its conclusion. This
is a similar format to what you might see on Comedy Cen
tral's "Kids In The Hall," a favorite of the group. It gener
ally gives the show a sense of continuity and anticipation.
When it comes to sketch comedy, the most obvious point
of reference for most people is, of course, "Saturday Night
Live." However, Friedland explained that, "It's really
tough to use 'Saturday Night Live' as a model fora couple
of reasons. Namely, it relies almost exclusively on current
events and political or celebrity satire." Given the"The Lin
coln Report'"s production schedule, it would indeed be dif
ficult to satirize the news. By the time production is com
pleted, an episode often airs a couple of months after the
sketches have been written.

The show's comic sensibility seems like it would be more
appealing to college students than anyone else. That cer
tainly makes sense given the group's background as Stan
ford students. Van Dyke said that he sometimes describes
the show to friends as "'American Pie'-type humor." How
ever, though the sketches often contain somewhat raunchy
themes and obvious jokes — in one skit, a student kicks his
roommate out of the room in order to have sex with a dog
— they are also often quite clever. The scene that opens the
second episode, for example, introduces a convenience
store clerk and manager, both of whom almost have a ner
vous breakdown when a customer asks for milk and there

isn't any in the store. Another particularly memorable
sketch features a protagonist who has a hoof instead of a
right hand.
"As much as the second episode relies somewhat on
weird humor, the first was pretty vulgar. Lots of'dick-and
fart jokes,'" said Friedland.
Pappas interjected, "No 'fart'jokes, actually."
"Okay, no 'fart' jokes, but definitely 'dick'jokes. Lots
of masturbation," replied Friedland before chuckling
and declaring, "Let's just say that we write about what
we know."
However, the group knew very little when it began de
veloping the show and each episode takes a considerable
amount of time to complete. None of the three had any ex
perience with television or with comedy before. Production
takes three main steps: writing, filming and editing. Writ
ing a skit lakes about an hour. This is followed by another

four to six hours filming, depending on the complexity of
the skit, and then by another four to six hours on the edit
ing computer. Given that each episode contains six skits on
