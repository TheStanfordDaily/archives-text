# 'Sexaholix' might prove addictive

"He must have an understanding fam
ily," my companion observed, following
the opening night performance of John
Leguizamo's tour-de force one-man show
"Sexaholix ... A Love Story" at San
Francisco's Orpheum Theater. Indeed,
Leguizamo, with love but no mercy, takes

on the vocal and physical idiosyncrasies of more than 20
characters including his parents ("You children are noth
ing but little r-r-retarded midgets!"), his children ("little
Jewericans" who'll "be able to dance and balance their
own checkbooks"), and his ancestors (a chamber-pot
emptier who fronted as a conquistador and an Incan

princess).
Leguizamo tackled similar material in last
year's "John Leguizamo Live." One can only
assume that the revised, Tony-nominated ver
sion benefits from his veteran collaboration
with director Peter Askin, who steered
"Mambo Mouth" and "Spic-O-Rama" (two of

Leguizamo's five one-man shows) through equally
successful New York runs. Leguizamo himself is
best known for scene-stealing roles in movies like
"William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet."

With "Sexaholix," Leguizamo has consid
erably enhanced an already highly entertaining
show: The voices have become more distinct,
i:he prose and poetry more polished, the per
former more devastatingly sexy, irresistibly

witty and inexhaustibly energetic than ever.
Leguizamo talks the talk and walks the walk,
rapping, dancing and gliding across the stage,

engaging in almost as many simulated sex acts
is a season of "Sex and the City." In short,
'Sexaholix" is everything a one-man show

should be, as acrobatic as it is intense, as risky and eccen
tric as it is universal.

In a speedy hour and a half, Legui/amo
relates his parents' divorce, his first relation
ship (with a woman twice his age), his grandfa
ther's death and the birth of his children with
brash candor. A monologist, not a stand-up co
median, Leguizamo always remembers that he
is telling a story and rarely strays far from the

show's theme: a man's journey away from one-night con
quests — sex as a sweet side dish with no main course — to
a lifetime commitment to one woman. As Leguizamo puts
it, he and Tiny are "soul mates on permanent booty call."
The pleasantly diverse audience responded enthusias
tically to Leguizamo's presence, but it seems that many
had already caught the small-screen version — HBO first
aired "Sexaholix" in April. Possibly forgetting the differ
ence between theater and a concert, hecklers shouted
Leguizamo's name one too many times for him (about
three times) and had to be reminded by the performer that
"Sexaholix" was a "mon-o-logue." The New York run ap
parently failed to prepare Leguizamo for the uppity rebels
of San Francisco!
Leguizamo seemed oddly jarred by the antics of a few
people in the crowd, ultimately a delivering a four-star
performance of what is clearly a five-star show. Many in
the audience had already seen the small-screen version of
the show on HBO. The network might have waited until
the tour's finale to broadcast the special — but then again
they've proved that only John Leguizamo can upstage
John Leguizamo.
One "relative" may have had a point when she proudly
proclaimed, "Little Johnny is a stuttering, masturbating,
bed-wetting, glue-sniffing, little Latin loser." Leguizamo,
looking back, comments, "What a liar. I didn't stutter."
But not even a potentially outraged family could accuse
him of poor timing.
