Ben Affleck's much-scrutinized career has
been a center-stage tightrope without a safety net.
'Hie triumphs have been dazzling: the precocious
screenplay ()scar for "(iood Will I hinting," not to
mention his under-appreciated portrayal of
Bostonian blue-collar dignity. The failures, how
ever, have been terrifying plummets from the

rafters: the abysmal "Reindeer Games," his drunken bombas
ticism on HBO's "Project Greenlight" (although it made for
one hell of a show), and his subsequent bout in drug rehab, to
which he was reportedly driven by friend Robert Downey Jr.
I've said it before, and I'll say it again: if Robert Downery Jr. is
driving you to rehab, you know you've got a problem.
With "The Sum of All Fears," directed by Phil Alden Robin
son, Affleck appeared to find a happy medium between his
much-criticized summer bonanzas ("Armageddon," "Pearl
Harbor"), and the character-driven narratives offered by the
ever-inconsistent Kevin Smith. Robinson, who is best known
for writing and directing the sublime "Field of Dreams,"
seemed like the formula's completion — propagating the Tom
Clancy pedigree of "smart" action movies, infused with credi
bility by the likes of Alec Baldwin and Harrison Ford.
On May 11, this last Saturday evening, the Stanford Film So
ciety in conjunction with Paramount Pictures brought a sneak
preview of the film to a capacity crowd at Cubberley Auditori
um. I had already seen a press screening two weeks prior in the
AMC Mercado, but it's hard to get a g<xxl take on an action film
when your audience is a handful of cadaverous film critics who
merely grunt condescendingly between scenes.
As expected, the on-campus screening fleshed out the en
dearing humor of the film's first half, and the cookie-cutter
schlock of the second hall — highlighted by uproarious laugh
ter from the cynical crowd when the U.S. president (James
Cromwell) closes the movie declaring that Russia and the Unit-

Ed States have signed a treaty "banning nuclear weapons for
ever from the Earth." A naive signature of a film produced be-

fore the reality-shattering events of
Sept. 11.
Speaking of reality-shattering, in
stead of perpetuating the old Tom
Clancy series made famous by "The
Hunt for Red October," "Patriot
Games," and "Clear and Present Dan-

ger," Paramount has decided to reinvent it in an alternate uni
verse of sorts. As always, our hero is jack Ryan, the CIA analyst
extraodinaire who against his better judgement, always finds
himself fleeing in slow motion from fireballs and fighting large
Russian men armed with chains. Only this time, Ryan is still an
immature operative, fresh out of the Marines, played with
wide-eyed ebullience by Ben Allleck. The problem: the film is
set in modern day — chronologically after all the other films.
That aside, the first half of the film is humorous and engag
ing. James Cromwell has a certain gravity while playing the
U.S. president, and Morgan Freeman delivers a predictably
powerful performance as Affleck's CIA superior. Also note
worthy is Li'ev Schreiber, whores conjures up a strikingly en
tertaining portrayal of an impish yet ruthless CIA hit man.
A little over the halfway mark a nuclear disaster occurs on
U.S. soil (as the film's trailer foolishly reveals). This kind of dis
aster is an impossible pitfall fora current film. It seemed simul
taneously too close for comfort, yet also outrageously removed
from the hellish reality of the past few months. A nuclear bomb
is detonated during the Super Bowl in downtown Baltimore,
and the unthinkable aftermath is basically swept under the rug
with the exception of the ominous political implications.
Hie structure, of the film also suffers after the explosion, as
the plot essentially deteriorates into a series of high-tension
phone calls. I don't care how fast you intercut between scenes,
or how epic your musical score is, it's impossible to maintain a
film's energy when all you're doing is cutting back and forth be

tween people yelling into phones about SNAP counts. At one
point they have to gratuitously insert the aforementioned
Russian-with-chain fight scene just to infuse the film with a lit
tle movement.
"The Sum of All Fears" is a step in the right direction for Af
fleck: it's a well-crafted, if by the numbers, Hollywood produc
tion. Unfortunately it lacks half the soul, wit, and solid writing
of a "Good Will Hunting." Maybe the best career move lor Af
fleck would be to cut out the middleman and write his next
movie himself.



Which one of these guys is Ben Affleck?
