# Scottish bastards!!!
## 
### ERIC HAND 
The Beta Band likes to undermine your
expectations. Take, for example, its latest
album: "Hot Shots II." The experimental
Scottish quartet wanted an album tide that
sounded suitably "American" and "bom
bastic." And yet the album is its most quiet
and understated to date, full of mid-range
beats and thoughtful effects, the sort of
music that, while never sleepy, isn't exactly
a party to go either.
"A1 Sharp" and "Human Being," the
second and third tracks on the album, are
most representative of the Beta Band's
oeuvre, if it is possible at all to pigeonhole
them. Sampled beats usher the two tracks
along in a lolling, unhurrjed way, while toy
pianos, folky guitars and dreamy har
monies fill in the spaces.
But some of the songs drift away from
this ambient-central style. "Gone," the
fourth track on the album, is a wistful
piano-laden elegy that is devoid of the
band's trademark trippy beats altogether:
a Beta Band ballad. At the other extreme
are the upbeat "Alleged," where a trifling
melody gives way to fat dub-tinged beats,
and "Won," which launches into a full-on
hip-hop rap.
They've assembled a well-crafted and
consistently inventive album, worthy of the
critical praise it has received — and then
you look at the album cover. The cover —
a cheesy explosion in space — is appalling
ly bad, the sort of thing any monkey could
McPaint in a few minutes. It has to be de
lilserately bad, right?
This is the essential contradiction of the
Beta Band. Its members want to succeed
and do have ambition — they worked
very hard to open for Radiohead last sum
mer and have relentlessly promoted
themselves in the tour's wake. Yet. they
sabotage themselves — publicly saying
their send album "was shit" — whenever
they begin to take the music or job too se
riously. They say "they don't do irony,"
but they do.

In concert on Tuesday, April 30 at the
Fillmore, the contradictions are apparent.
Nonchalantly, the band shuffles onstage,
uniformed in the white surgical scrubs of
hospital employees. Videos, created most
ly by the band members themselves, play
overhead. Their bizarre sense of humor is
evident. In one video clip, the band mem
bers dress up as occult monsters (like Skek
sis from"The Dark Crystal") and parade
around a Scottish mountaintop — in re
verse mo-

tion. In an
other, they
don space
suits and
make a pa-

tnotic tnp to
the moon in the name of Scotland — only
to discover that they're actually on a movie
studio soundstage and it was all a fraud.
Despite the obvious craft of the stage
show and the energy of the music, their
stage presence is a yawn. Steve Mason's
singing voice is deadpan. His speak-songy
voice has never been noted for its range,
but, hunched over the microphone, he
looks like Jason Schwartzman from
"Rushmore" doing a Steven Wright stand
up routine.
Perhaps they should be forgiven for
some of their lethargy — San Francisco
was the third-to-last stop of a long Ameri
can tour. But with the exception of deck
man John Mac Lean, who bounces around
irrepressibly the entire night, the band
looks weary, performing the instrument
switching numbers and drum circle en
cores with the perfunctory, forced enthu
siasm of musicians looking forward to
their hotel rooms.
You could say the Beta Band stress sub
stance over style. Or that they're substan
tively stylish in the areas that they think
matter: music not album covers, costumes
not choreography. But in concert, it would
have been nice to see a little more enthusi
asm for their own music. iTiey don't think
this album is shit, too, do they?
