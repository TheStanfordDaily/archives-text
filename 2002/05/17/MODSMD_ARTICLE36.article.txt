# Not much 'Trouble' here
## 
### SERENA LAUREN BLODGER 
Early next month, The Trouble with
Sweeney's second EP, "Play Karen and Oth
ers" will be released on Basement-Life
records. The EP is a preview to its full-length
album, which will be out this fall.
This alt-country, folk-rock band gets major
props simply fora more well-thought-out
album cover. Its first EP release, "Dear Life,"
had a picture of a woman in a sweater, sitting at
a kitchen table with an uneaten cake. "Play
Karen" has matured to include more abstract
cover art — namely, a photograph of a per
son's legs on a wcxxJen floor wearing weird
shoes. Odd? Yes. Does it work for Sweeney's
tunes? Definitely.
The Trouble with Sweeney hails from
Philadelphia and can attribute its enhanced
marketing to a label switch from Burnt Toast
records, based in its hometown, to Basement-
Life records, based in New York. This five
member band seems to be doing what it can to
leave its 10-fi, indie-rock reputation behind.
However, this could be a difficult feet if
Sweeney continues to make 10-fi, indie-rock
music.
The album's first track, "Karen" is an up
beat, delightful song with charming lyrics
("Karen, I'm kind of an impatient guy. And I
don't want to waste your time. See, my will Ls
strong but my shoes are tight, and Karen,
would it be OK if I came over?"). This song and
"Most of It's Mine" are reminiscent of the fake
band "'llie Wonders" from the early-'9os film,

"That Thing You Do."
Lead singer Joey Sweeney's vocals and song
writing are definitely the bands strong points.
His voice is clear, and passionate, yet chill, with
a similar quality to Tom Petty. Unfortunately,
something seems a bit off with the studio
recording of" Play Karen and Others." The lev
els on Sweeney's vocals seem far too low and
often his voice blends in widi the instrumenta
tion. Hopefully, tliis will be fixed prior to the re
lease of its full-length album, especially since die
band shows so much potential.
"Most of It's Mine," is fun, catchy, upbeat
and seems to be full of witty lyrics — it was hard
to hear most of them due to the recording. The
fifth track on the album, "Oh! It's Mollifying"
is another standout on "Play Karen." Joey
Sweeney sounds a whole lot like Tom Petty in
this classic-rock inspired song, while the inter
action of the guitars, drums and harmonica
produces quality instrumentation.
.Aside from diese three songs, die rest of
"Play Karen" is a bit more low-key. "Waiting
for Gary" consists solely of a woman speaking
French on top of background music. "The
Only Living Boy I n New York" is a Simon and
Garkfiinkel cover, while the mellow "Lover
Gets Results" could really use another record-

ing, as Sweeney's vocals are
once again difficult to hear
and understand.
Consequently, "The T rou
ble with Sweeney" is the kind
of band that will probably
succeed if it manages to at
tract a cult following. If the
band plays its cards right, its
music, along with its unique
style, might end up in the
ears of mainstream music
fans after all.


"Hey dude, let's get high under the bridge."
