# King of modern rock loses his aim

### CHRIS LEE 
Elvis Costello fails, please
come see me. Not having lis
tened to any of his previous al
bums, I feel more than a little
guilty giving "When I was
Cruel" (his first in seven years)
such a mediocre rating — par-

ticularly since the rest of the music world is Hilling over itself to
praise it, hailing it as a welcome return to form. Well, let's see —
if wandering, thinly layered pieces with a penchant for show
casing the whinier side of Costello's voice, matched with line
after line of nonsensical lyrics are what made him famous, then
yes, boys and girls, Elvis is back and better than ever, This year's
model is nothing less than an (xld collection of underdeveloped
tracks that almost pull together by the album's close.
The disc opens with "45," an innocuous little riff on record
and life metaphors that kind of grows on you — particularly
after you've heard the rest of the album, " fear off Your Own
Head," the first single for the album, is a catchy, driving rock
song, and die only one of its kind here. "When I was Cruel no.
2" incorporates the sparse guitar and debonair beat of an un
released Bond theme, and "15 Petals" showcases an interesting

backbone of sax and trumpet.
Near the middle of the album, however, Elvis begins to
founder —"Soul for Hire" seems too slow and underdevel-

oped, while "Dissolve" ends up dissolving
itself in a distracting layer of feedback.
"Tart," an exploration of life's sweet -and
sour motif, logins with a beautiful piano
intro and develops the perfect imxxl and
pace, only to nearh >e undermined by
Elvis's repeated, whiny incantations of the
title word. "Alibi" suffers from this phe
nomenon even more — the track is near
ly unlistenable solely because of the way
Elvis wraps his voice around "alibi," giving
the impression of an illicit fondling which
later segues into full-scale rape with des
perate screaming). "I love you just as
much as I hate your guts," he sings here,
and he might just as well be talking about
the word "alibi."
Thankfully, Elvis rescues himself with
the album's close. "My Little Blue Win
dow" is easily one of the most melodic and
beautifully tragic tracks on the whole disc

" Episode of Blonde" plays a mean tango and has some nice key
changes, while "Radio Silence" provides the perfect ending: a
thoughtful, wispy rumination"that'll leave you with the empti-

ness of real radio silence by the
time it's all over.
/Ml in all, the album seems
pretty uneven — a nebulous
middle section sandwiched by
gtxxl looks into musical great
ness— which makes me even
more ambivalent. I'm not both
ered by the non sequiturs in the
lyrics so much as the haphazard
fusion of music and words found
here. Costello's lyrics never seem
perfectly suited to his melodies,
the result of awkward word
choice and a lack of pure vocal fi
nesse. The last few tracks are
breathtaking examples of what
he's truly capable of, but in the
end may not be enough to keep
"When I Was Cruel" from gath
ering dust on the shelf.



"Hold on, I gotta do my finger exercises first."
