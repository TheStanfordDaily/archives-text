# Orange Peels doing all right 'So Far'
## 
### BENJAMIN L FRIEDLAND 
If you've come to blows
insisting that the Beach Boys'
legacy outstretches the Beat
les', then the Orange Peels'
second release, "So Far," an
unmistakably '60s-Los .Ange
les throwback, deserves a

special slot in your CD rack.
This Sunnyvale-based quintet delivers big, clean California
pop that is more beach volleyball than surfing. Less alternative
but perhaps more fun than their Bay counterparts Beulah, the
Orange Peels have developed a strand of Golden State pop that
will have listeners quickly checking the group's tour schedule.
like most opening tracks, "Back in San Francisco," typifies
tiie airy guitars and light melodies that follow. However unlike
most, "So Far'"s opener replaces the sophistication of the re
maining 10 songs with a kind of AM radio-cheese. 'Hie chorus
may indeed stick around, but, in this case, that could be a nui
sance. 'I hat said, the rest of the album far surpasses "Back in San
Francisco," and this average first song shouldn't discourage fur
ther listening.

Track two, for example, includes the driving melody and
summer harmonies that make for delightful pop. Front man
and main songwriter Alan Clapp does whine slighdy, but his
nasal singing blends into die mix and doesn't distract. Like die
enure album, the title song won't overpower listeners with loud
guitars. Still, the group does crank up the distortion beneath
the song's "Fa Fa" chorus to appease even die most diehard
Hives fan.
Many of Clapp's Brian Wilson melodies sound at first famil
iar then turn unexpectedly, and it's this smooth surprise diat sep
arates his songs from most other beach bums with a four track.
The first 30 seconds of, "Pattern on the Willi" lull listeners into
that state of pleasant nostalgia. About 10 seconds later, Clapp's
pulled the switch, forcing listeners to tell friends alxnit his song
writing. This melodic pattern combined with "So Far"'s trade
mark gentle guitars lock "Pattern on the Willi" as the album's
best.
As if the band's Crosby-era Byrds sound left any confusion as
to the fivesome's roots, Clapp clears it all up through continual
reference to California. In"The West Coast Rain," the front man
sings "I've never liked San Jose / I've never liked LA" Though
songs explore love, heroin addiction and breaking up, Clapp id
ways returns to his home state. 'Hie result provides continuity for

listeners and secures the album as an important derivative of
Beach Boys' pop.
Out on SpinART records, "So Far" marks the Orange Peels'
second release, and continues to rake in critical acclaim. Al
though the band's first record, "Square," relies heavily on reverb,
"So Far" doesn't include "even a drop of it," said the band.
Formed in 1996, the Orange Peels will play at Santa Clara Uni
versity on May 31.
