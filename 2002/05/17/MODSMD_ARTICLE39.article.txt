# Kushner's play fails at Berkeley Rep.
## 
### LINDSEY GERDES 
Tony Kushner is not one to shy away from a chal
lenging issue. He first gained acclaim with the I'ulity.er
and Tony Award-winning ".Angels in America" (1993), a
groundbreaking, two-part epic chronicling AIDS and
homosexuality in early '90s New York. Since then he has
tackled topics ranging from die collapse of the Soviet
Union to the rise of Nazis (which he compares to Rea
gan's ascent).
His newest work, "Homebody / Kabul," attempts to
capture die motivations — bodi political and social —
behind die catastrophic events ofSept. 11. The play takes

place immedi
ately before
and after the
United States
bombed Khost
in 1998, claim
ing that the city
housed terror-

Ist training camps. It chronicles an English father and
daughter's attempts to find the missing mother in Kabul.
Much of the play was written well tie fore the tragic
events of Sept. 11 and a few lines in particular are eerily
prophetic. An oppressed Afghan woman warns, "We
must suffer under the Taliban so that the [United States]
might settle a 20-year score with Iran ... Don't worry,
they're coming to New York!"
Although Kushner should lie praised for his fore
sight, the play itself is an awkwardly arranged, largely
incoherent jumble of ideologies. Kushner originally
wrote "Homebody" as a monologue fora British ac
tress friend, and later developed it into a three-act,
multi-character play.
He retains the monologue — running almost an
hour — as the first act of the play. It is delivered by a
English mother known as the Homebody (Michelle
Morain), who goes through a series of topics ranging
from her husband's scientific endeavors to the hat she's
recently purchased from an Afghani immigrant. She
also reads from a 1965 travel guide to Kabul and it be
comes obvious that she feels guilty about being shel
tered, "so unforgivably dry," and wants to step out of
her isolated world.
Hie Homebody speaks in rambling tangents and
uses a barrage of words rarely witnessed in any normal
person's vocabulary. As she herself remarks, "nobody
talks like this." This disorder pnxluces the occasional hi
larious insight like her comments concerning the vari
ous antidepressants she and her husband take: "1 fre

quentJy take his pills to know he feels." 100 often,
though, we have to shift through almost unintelligible
speech to get to these gems, and the effort is exhausting.
By beginning a nearly three-and-a-half hour produc
tion with the monologue ofa thoroughly annoying char
acter, Kushner dulls the audience before we even get to
the heart of the play.
Act Two opens with the father (Charles Shaw Robin
son) and daughter (Heidi Dippold) searching for the
Homebody in Kabul. Although she is assumed dead,
her daughter questions tire validity of this claim and
through die aid of a tour guide / poet (Hector Correa)
and a mysterious Afghan woman (Jacqueline Antarami
an), she attempts to discover the whereabouts of her
mother. Her father spends most of the play in a drug-in
duced stupor with the unofficial representative of the
government, a man named Quango Twistleton (Bruce
McKenzie), who has been sent to help the family.
r I lie characters are never fully developed and when
an occasional insight into their past is revealed it often
seems forced and contrived. When Twisdeton discusses
die sense of failure and loneliness that has led him to his
drug habit, I got die disturbing feeling that it was solely
so Kushner could incorporate the line "I'm a junkie.
Afghar tistan supplies the world," rather than any red de
sire to explore the character.
This overt social commentary has worked quite suc
cessfully for Kushner in die past, but try ing to tackle so
many challenging social, political and religious issues in
die setting of Kabul is an overly ambitious, almost un
workable premise. In Kushner's Kabul a homeless beg
gar who speaks little English will suddenly break out into
a complicated, deeply insightful speech, and while there
should lie room for some suspension of disbelief, con
trivances like these are so consistent that they detract
from any real feeling of authenticity.
While the play definitely has its share of holes, there
are some trademark quirky, disturbing and ultimately
coniedic Kushner moments. One such instance occurs
when the sexually deprived Twistleton puts a pair of the
daughter's underwear over his head and begins to mas
turbate. She walks in and catches him, but although she
is initially shocked, it is implied that he convinces her to
sleep with him a short time later. Despite the muddle of
the rest of the play, at least one message rings through
loud and clear: A person can do something as horrible
as be caught masturbating with another person's under
wear over their head and still have the possibility of sleep
ing with them. While I don't know how much insight
into the Middle Eastern conflict I gained from the play,
at least I have diat.
