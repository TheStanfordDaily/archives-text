# Geneticist talks sustainability

### MICHELLE KELLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Monkombu Swaminathan, a
plant geneticist and a leader in the
field of agricultural sustainability,
spoke last night on the "Changing
Concept of Sustainable Develop
ment."
"Sustainable agriculture is a
combination of economics, ecolo
gy, equity, employment and ener
gy," Swaminathan said. "It is easy
to add the prefix 'sustainable' to
many practices today — making it
a reality is much more difficult."
Swaminathan was invited to
speak through a partnership of the
School of Humanities of Arts and
Sciences and the Society of Art and
Culture in India.
He has worked throughout his
career to address the problems of
hunger in developing countries,
particularly in his home country
of India. He was awarded the
World Food Prize in 1987, the
equivalent of the Nobel Prize in
Agriculture.
According to Swaminathan, in a
world where 30 million infants are
born with mental impairment due
to low birth weight and Third
World countries like India have
over 250 million people living
below the poverty line, sustainabil
ity in agriculture is no longer a
choice, it is a necessity.
He said the success of sustain
able agriculture results from a
combination of science, technolo
gy, service and public policy.
"It works like a symphony," he
said. "When all of these things
come together then the progress
moves very rapidly."
Swaminathan is a proponent of
biotechnology, specifically genetic
engineering, as a necessary com
ponent of sustainable agriculture.

"In order to maintain and ex
tend the gains of agricultural pro
ductivity today we must use our re
cently acquired genetic tools in
order to produce the highest
yields on the smallest amount of
land possible."
In response to a question about
the place of organic practices in
sustainable agriculture, Swami
nathan responded, "organic agri
culture [without genetic engineer
ing] cannot be practiced unless
you are very, very rich - you really
need biotechnology."
"I am not for putting organic
agriculture against biotechnology.
Instead, I believe in the synthesis
of these two fields," he said. "If you
really want to avoid chemical pest

controls and fertilizers, you need
the support of technology."
Swaminathan also spoke about
economic and gender equity prac
tices in sustainable communities.
Small enterprises such as commu
nity dairy farms and hybrid breed
ing can be a significant source of
income for women, granting them
liberty and power.
Swaminathan has created sev
eral community centers with com
puters in India and has worked
with increasing literacy and mak
ing the internet available to poor
communities.
"Technology can be used as a
tool for equity, bringing people —
