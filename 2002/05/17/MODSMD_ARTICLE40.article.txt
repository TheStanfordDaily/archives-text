# Tango Fandango

### ERICK FLORES 
It's eight o'clock in San Francisco. A
number of anxious, sophisticated,
wide-eyed men and women quickly fil
ter in to Theatre on the Square, a per
forming arts center on Post Street.
Even before a tuxedo-clad woman
checks your admission ticket to allow
you in, you hear a loud, pleasant

melody coming from inside the theatre. A small, but complete orchestra
plays tlie violins, piano, and double bass. Standing out the most, however,
is die unique sound generated by die accordions. Immediately, the audi
ence and even the members waiting in line fall under the enchanting
trance of "Malambo."
Vibrandy exploding from the heart of Argentina comes Malambo: For
ever Tango, a spectacular show created and directed by Luis Bravo. With
musical direction by Lisandro Adrover and choreography by Oscar Araiz,
the show features an intricate blend of song and dance that captivates the
audience's heart as much as il does its attention. All of the show's theatrical
elements come together to develop several stories of love, tragedy, loneli
ness and ecstasy, exchanging the limited capacity of words for the lack of
restriction that characterizes body language.
Bravo's production incorporates elements of folkloric tango, tap and
jazz that bring something refreshingly new to the stage. From solo pieces
to group performances, the show radiates a welcoming craziness that is
brought forth in the performers' colorful costumes and unparalleled stage
presence. Special effects marked by lasers, spotlights, smoke and dramat
ic glimmering backgrounds light up the stage, enhancing and individual
izing each of the distinct numbers.
Hie only shortcoming of the show is a singer who appears in a few of
the pieces, sometimes on his own and at other times in the background of
a dance as a storyteller. By himself, he is reminiscent of a cheesy, hotel
lounge singer, or even worse a sleazy drunk guy belting out tunes at a
karaoke bar. And when he's in the backdrop, you just keep wishing he
would shut up and let the performers do their thing. While it's not to say
this guy lacks talent, he is misplaced in the show. He seems like a singer try
ing desperately to be part of the lliree Tenors, and trying way ttx) hard.
Aside from this, within its two acts, the intimate program puts the
emotional intensity of romance and passion into the rhythms and mo
tions of the dancers. When they seduce, the audience is seduced. When
they betray, the audience is betrayed. And when they express, the audi
ence responds.
By the end of the show, the audience wants encore after encore and
leaves disappointed only after realizing the curtain has made its final fall,
signaling the end of the production. Perhaps the only thing more enter
taining than the actual show is the number of people who walk out try
ing to imitate the complicated dance moves, wishing for just one second
they could lie the sexy beasts performing on stage. I should know â€” 1
was one of those people.
