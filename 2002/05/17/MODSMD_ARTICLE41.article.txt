# Al Green loves and cherishes the booty

This is the ninth in a series of articles called "The Record Bin" explor
ing classic albums from the past: pop music for people who like pof)
music.

Indeed, A1 Green's
"Greatest Hits" is music to
love your old lady by.
Those of you who choose
lesser gods such as Barry
White, Tom Jones or even
Usher to pop into the old
record player have lost the

way. Al Green is it.
Now why is that? Barry White can sing his booty an
thems all he wants, but my first love is Al Green.
His achingly sweet, ghostly-smooth delivery is under
stated and just right. Green did not belong to the sweaty,
loud and powerful band of soul and R&B singers. Al
though he could certainly make a joyful noise, he never
seemed to work at it.
Green has had a messy life, perfect for some intrusive
TV biopic. After the first successes of his career, when the
gorgeous "Let's Stay Together" became a hit, he encoun
tered a crazy-ass woman. His girlfriend Mary Woodson be
came enraged when he refused marriage (although she
was already married), poured boiling grits on him, and
shot herself. In front of him.
Thus Green found religion and a church in Memphis

and became a minister. He still released R&B albums, until
he fell off a stage during a performance. He decided that
meant he should only record gospel albums. He is current
ly a pastor, but still records albums and duets with other
famous artists. His Web site, www.algreen.com, is heavy on
the G-O-D, but there is a nice picture of him smiling.

But one is inclined to forget all of that when listen
ing to "Greatest Hits". The album focuses on his R&B
work done before Green made a shift towards gospel
and spiritual music. And it is beautiful.
"Greatest Hits" showcases the hybridic tone Green
created by combining the Memphis-based Stax-Volt
sound with the more sweet, slick sound of Motown. In
"Let's Stay Together," one of his biggest hits (fora rea-

son, damn you!), his voice conveys huge pain and
longing with a sparse delicacy. Fora while when I was a
moderately pimply high-school student, I lived on this
album because it conveyed that same sort of romantic hurt
and joy that my little adolescent heart gravitated towards.
The sound he conveys conies closer to that of a smoother
Billie Holliday than James Brown or Aretha Franklin, his
contemporaries. What-I mean to say is, it doesn't sweat, it
sighs. When he slides up to those high notes in "Let's Stay
Together", it feels postively ghostly. How can anyone have
that much sweet funk? Sensitive funk, at that?
Green is all about love, love, love and he approaches this
much wailed upon topic with sensuality and sensitivity.
That's right: it is not all about the booty. It is certainly to be
inferred that booty is desired and enjoyed by all, but that's
not all he's after! There's a conversational quality to his

work, even when he is doing his best to seduce you: "When
I'm down I can always call you / Fora helpin' hand /1
know you'll do the best you can / But it don't take much
from me, just my tup of joe." Sigh.



Music to love your old lady by.
