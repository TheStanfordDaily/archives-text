# Collaborative effort doesn't quite have Midas touch
## 
### RYAN SANDS 
This album is one of a recent rash of
collaborations featuring the vocals of
German I)J Miss Kittin, who goes by the
name Caroling Herve during the wak-

ing hours. Her other
collaborators include
electro-funk DJs Felix
Da Housecat and The
Hacker, both of whom
produce the type of
tongue-in-cheek retro
electro-dance tracks

that have become the rage in U.S. dance
clubs. You may know Miss Kittin's voice
from the notorious club hit "Frank Sina
tra," which features her signature half
talking / half-singing style mixing ex
plicit phrases and musings about
whether Frank Sinatra has died yet over
a bare synthesizer beat.
No dig against Golden Boy (aka Ste
fan Altenburger), but Miss Kittin's work
with The Hacker is her most exciting
collaborative work so far. 1 must admit
that I find her contributions to both The
Hacker and Golden Boy's songs overrat
ed. On "Or," the vocals are not cheesy,
like trance or diva house songs, but Kit
tin does try a bit too hard to alienate the
listener by singing in a flat and unaffect
ed monotone. Though hervocal style is
effective for certain songs, I quickly be
came tired of the same "singing" on all of
Kittin's contributions to this alburn.
Luckily, this album's music speaks loud
er than its words thanks to Golden Boy.
He is the true brains behind this project,
and his smart and slick musical know
how shines through on tracks such as
"Campari Soda" and "Nix."

"Or" describes itself as a glimpse of
the "Swiss Life." If this is the case, then
Switzerland must be one giant futuristic
lounge, filled with mirror balls, velvet
couches, cocktails and cosmopolitan
people. The album's tracks are super-

catchy in a really good
way and I found myself
humming the tunes of
the instrumentals while
in the shower. Every
track on "Or" gives off
the air of high produc
tion and smooth grooves;

however, the sum of these parts is an
album that comes across as less than
compelling. There really are no prob
lems with this record, but it never push
es itself far enough musically, and wasn't
able to hold my attention for too long. It
would be great fora chill-out party or to
listen to while driving on the highway at
night, but doesn't really work as well
when heard alone on a home stereo.
This album is part of a new wave of
Electro-pop, which is beginning to get
the recognition in the United States
that it deserves. Riding the line be
tween techno, dance and pop music,
Golden Boy is savvy enough to recog
nize many of the pitfalls and cliches of
dance music and tries to highlight
these with interesting lyrics sung by
Miss Kittin. The song "1234" stands
out as Miss Kittin asks, "Should I sing
about music? / About love? / Cars,
drugs or parties? / Or maybe some
thing 1 know about, like girls and fash
ion?" In this track and others such as
"Rippin Kittin," which confronts de
pression and suicide, Golden Boy and
Miss Kittin push the idea that dance

music can talk about something impor
tant, rather than just serving as a back
drop fora night of rolling and MDMA
induced comas. These songs save the
album and give it a tone and style
which makes listening to it a very plea
surable and non-passive experience.
Golden Boy is skilled at crafting

beats and tracks with just the right
amount of flair and Miss Kittin's rather
flat vocals do hit the right note on cer
tain songs. However, both the vocals
and Golden Boy's compositions don't
carry enough oomph to push "Or" past
the category of just a "good" record
into that of great one.
