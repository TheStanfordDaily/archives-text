# 'Let them eat cake,' says Ahmed
## 
### S. M 
Daily managing editor for spe
cial sections Sameer Ahmed won
the election for volume 222 editor
in chief but apparently didn't care
because he showed up late to claim
his victory cake, champagne, and
date with the penguin.
Champagne was consumed in
stead by current and present EIC
Mark Boucher, who sprayed it all
over his face in dismay over
Ahmed's absence.
Ahmed will hopefully appear to
edit the newspaper next year, al
though certain sections of said
newspaper will not be back. The
much-beloved but entirely obsolete
Page 2, which despite the efforts of
Jen Graham was cut anyway to
make room for real news, will be re
moved as per Ahmed's platform.
Insiders attribute Ahmed's vic
tory to his being essentially the
same size and weight as the cur
rent editor in chief.
"I have a question," News Edi
tor Yasi Hashemi questioned,
"Does this mean we can't watch
'Friends' at The Daily?"
"I have another question,"
Hashemi questioned. "Does that
mean there's going to be more
sports on the Daily TV?"
As News Editor Mikey Lee was
absent, questions arose among
The Daily staff. However, in

formed sources reported that Lee
was passed out on a futon in Toyon.
George Gallup telephoned The
Daily to congratulate Ahmed, who
plans as a "pet project" to intro
duce Daily polls more comprehen
sive than "What is the best Concert
Network show?" (Answer: None.)
All Republicans at The Daily,
despite working with Ahmed in
the Opinions section, will be
rounded up and shot.
"We will rise again," Opinions
Editor Mark Dominik vowed, car
rying off a case of Diet Simply Soda
to fuel the revolution.
Amanda Canevaro speculated
about whether or not Aaron
Levine would arrive to eat cake.
"I heard from my best friend's
mother that he would," she said.
"But then my brother said that he
wouldn't, So I'm totally confused."
Lhe staff'expects hot tubs and
beer to be implemented immedi
ately. "The beer can be imple
mented immediately," vowed
Boucher, opening another de
spite Intermission claims that it
"tasted like piss." At the time of
this statement, Intermission had
consumed half a beverage and
had fallen down.
Well-wishers continued to call
into The Daily to inquire who had
won, but never found out as they
were put on "101."
"YVhere is he?" asked an exas

perated Boucher, waiting to go
play golf his senior year, as Ahmed
had not shown up 34 minutes after
his victor. Boucher bought anoth
er bottle of champagne and drank
that, too, out of spite.
"I won?" Ahmed said, appear
ing 35 minutes later.
Ahmed revealed the secret to
his success was a proactive News
Editor Vauhini Vara, who paid
Ahmed $100 for the privilege of
voting for him.
Ahmed mused about next
year. "I will show up for it,"he
vowed. "That much is certain.
Beyond that, I don't know. My
platform was obviously all lies
given how financially screwed
The Daily is. No worries though.
I never worry.
"I plan instead to continue busi
ness as usual," he proclaimed, to
wild cheering.
"We're creating genius here,"
said a drunken Page 2 Editor Gra
ham, who was drinking away the
loss of her page and getting in
credibly schooled at HORSE by
various uncoordinated, but sober,
Daily staffers.
An ungrateful Daily-endorsed
Josh Benson also called in to make
sure Ahmed's victory was legitimate.
This story would have been
longer, as Ramin Setoodeh and
John Huetter prefer stories to be,
but it's not.
