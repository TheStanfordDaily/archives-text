# Student fashion show organized
## Asian-American groups will host event tomorrow 
### JENNIFER KONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Style, glamour and culture will
be showcased tomorrow night at
"DesigNation: Designation a Na
tion," the Asian American Student
Association's annual benefit fash
ion show.
A group of 21 student models
will walk down the runway,
dressed in fashions by Asian-
American designers. There will
also be student-choreographed
dance sets. The show will run
twice, once at 8 p.m. and a second
time at 10 p.m. in the Tresidder
Union Oak Room.
After the second show, stu
dents can stay for the "Trunk
Show" and purchase some of the

clothes on display.
"We wanted to present the
fashions under the idea that
Asian- American designs can
truly unite all races, personali
ties and styles," said junior Steph
Cheung, one of the show's head
coordinators.
Cheung, who participated in
the show as a model last year, said
she gained valuable experience
from the many hours of practice.
"What I liked most was the op
portunity to see my culture from a
different perspective," Cheung
said. "1 learned that being beauti
ful, stylish and fashionable as an
Asian can mean a lot of different
things."
Designs featured at the show
will include casual wear, formal at
tire and traditional ethnic clothes.
According to junior Michael
Chang, one of the show's head
coordinators, several Asian and
Asian-American designers were
contacted for the event from a

database compiled by past fash
ion show organizers. Ten of
them decided to either lend or
donate clothes.
One brand that Chang high
lighted is Blacklava, a clothing
line that markets modern-style
clothes with political and racial
themes.
"The event showcases Asian
American talent in the form of
design, dance, production and
art," said sophomore Michelle
Won, one of the show's model
coordinators. "It's an opportu
nity to combine talent with a
message in an all-out, glitz-and
glam production."
The show will include more
dancing than usual, according to
Chang.
"Being in the fashion show has
rekindled my love for dancing,"
said freshman Robert Fernandez,
one of the show's models. "Now

when I'm walking down the hall,
I just start dancing for no reason."
At the end of the night,
Chang and sophomore Bryan
Kim, the association's chair,
will introduce the core mem
bers for next year. They will
also discuss the recent contro
versy over a new Abercrombie
8c Fitch clothing line that was
seen by some people as offen
sive to Asian Americans.
Proceeds from the show will
go to Global Exchange, a
human rights organization that
fights the treatment of workers
in sweatshops worldwide, espe
cially in Third World Asian
countries.
"Not only are people getting to
see a fashion show lasting over
two hours, they are also learning
about this important charity and
its cause," Chang said.
