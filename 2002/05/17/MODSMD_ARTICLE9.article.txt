## The 						Stanford Daily U.S. must support the Varela Project in Cuba 
### 
Former President Jimmy Carter con
cludes a five-day trip to Cuba today
that has been cheered by some as a
step toward improving relations be
tween the United States and its island neighbor
and dismissed by others as foreign-policy med
dling by the ex-president. Carter has talked
about many things while in Cuba, including
that nation's biotechnology program and the
U.S. economic embargo. But his most impor
tant words were three, brief sentences praising
the Varela Project.
The Varela Project is the name of an effort
by a group of Cuban citizens to force a nation
al referendum on Fidel Castro's regime. Lead
ers of the project — named for Felix Varela, a
19th century Catholic priest and Cuban inde
pendence activist — want to empower their
fellow Cubans to demand, through the ballot
box, the rights to free speech, free assembly,
free elections and free enterprise.
The Cuban constitution allows a nation

wide vote on any petition presented to the
National Assembly with 10,000 signatures.
Organizers have gathered over 11,000, de
spite the fact that Castro forbids the state
media to report on the petition drive. In ad
dition to being shunned by state journalists,
supporters have also been harassed and their
families monitored, both apparently at the
government's behest.
The question now is whether Castro will
allow the National Assembly, which he con
trols, to act on the petition. Obviously, he
should. His own constitution requires that a
referendum take place. Further, it is high time
Castro turned his demagogic rhetoric about
freedom and democracy into reality. Cubans
have not seen a free election since Castro came
to power. One is long overdue.
The Varela Project deserves the support
not only of Cubans who want a chance to
change their government. The project also
deserves the support of Stanford students

who care about freedom and human rights.
Though Castro often claims that his revolu
tion liberated the Cuban people, in fact, his
state is one of the most repressive in the
world. Cubans are routinely, and often vio
lently, denied the most basic human rights,
including the right to vote, to free speech, to
freedom of worship and assembly.
Millions of Cubans live in what one major
American newspaper recently called "primi
tive poverty." Every Cuban citizen, except gov
ernment leaders, eats on a ration book. These
food rations are small and typically of poor
quality. For many, electricity is sparse and run
ning water is a luxury. No Cuban can own a
private business or otherwise earn his or her
way out of poverty. This is not liberty. This is
political and social oppression.

ment to drop its long-standing embargo
against Cuba. Many Americans and Cubans
believe the embargo has contributed to Cuba's

Castro from responsibility for the deplorable
conditions in which Cubans live. He should be
held accountable.
In the United States, people can hold their
political leaders accountable by voting. Cubans
too deserve a free vote on the state of their gov
ernment. They deserve the chance to chart
their own course, and elect their own gover
nors. Stanford students can help the fate of free
dom in Cuba by learning more about the Varela
Project and life on the island, generally. They
can hold rallies in support of Cuban democracy,
invite Cuban dissidents to speak on campus,
and press the American media for continued
coverage of the referendum campaign.
Although we Americans sometimes take
them for granted, civil and political liberties
are not privileges. They are rights. The Cuban
people should be given what is theirs.
