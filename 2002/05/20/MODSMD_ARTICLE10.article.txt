1991
On May 20, 1991, The Daily printed an ed
itorial about the women's tennis team.
"It would be easy to write off the remarkable
achievements of the Stanford women's tennis
team.
"Because they win the NCAA Champi
onship year after year, the Cardinal women
make it look easy.
"But even the most jaded, spoiled fan
couldn't help but get caught up in the emotion
of the past week.
"More eyes than had ever watched a match
at the Stanford Tennis Stadium were fixed on
Court 7 a week ago Sunday afternoon asjunior
Kylie Johnson battled UCLA's Cammie Foley.
"If Johnson could pull it off, Stanford
would win its sixth straight national title anfl its
third in a row without the need of victories in
doubles.
"Johnson's teammates sat with rapt atten
tion, cheering every point and screaming
words of encouragement.
"Sure enough, Johnson came through, and
the Cardinal — the first host school ever to win
the NCAA title — celebrated as if they had
never won the NCAA title before.
"For Stanford, this year was not like the past
two, when everything came so easily.
"The Cardinal was embarrassed by Florida
back on March 3, suffering the first shutout in
team history.
"That defeat snapped an unbelievable 76-
match winning streak dating back to April 15,
1988.
"But instead of blaming one another and be
coming divided, the team pulled together in a
most unusual way.
"Although college tennis is a team sport, it
still consists primarily of individuals taking the
court and doing their own thing.
"To win this time, however, the Cardinal
women knew they would have to want it for
each other.
"When the NCAA finals rolled around,
Johnson wanted to win for herself and Debbie
Graham. Heather Willens wanted it for Laxmi
Poruri.
"Teri Whitlinger wanted it for Emma
Woodhouse. And so on down the line.
Bottom Line: And the song remains the same.
800-ya Cardinal.
