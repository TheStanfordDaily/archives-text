Okada House will present the play, "What Now?"
this Wednesday and Thursday as one of the last
events of Asian Pacific Islander Heritage Month.
In the last several weeks, various Asian-American
groups have been hosting events, including a luau,
an Open Mic Night, an art showcase and an awards

groups," Peralta said.
Senior Ravi Faiia, an Okada ethnic theme associ
