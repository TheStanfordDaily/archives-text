# Okada play tackles stereotypes
## The 						student production 'What Now?' will showcase Asian-American culture 
### JENNIFER KONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Okada House will present the play, "What Now?"
this Wednesday and Thursday as one of the last
events of Asian Pacific Islander Heritage Month.
In the last several weeks, various Asian-American
groups have been hosting events, including a luau,
an Open Mic Night, an art showcase and an awards
banquet, to showcase their culture.
As part of the celebration, Okada's performance
of "What Now?" will seek to challenge stereotypes
about Asian Americans and to increase racial con
sciousness among students, according to sophomore
Jordan Peralta, an Okada ethnic theme associate.
The play, which was written by former UC-Berkeley
student Jeffrey Liu, centers around the lives of col
lege-aged Asian Americans.
Peralta said that Okada wanted to put on a play
that would candidly address Asian-American is

sues such as parental obligations, the need to suc
ceed, the taboo of homosexuality and the model
minority myth.
"I hope the play will help people to see that while
it's important to cherish what is good about society,
we also need to change the bad things like discrimi
nation and sexism," said sophomore Kirsten Friday,
one of the actors.
As director of the play, Peralta held auditions the
first week of spring quarter. Auditions were limited
to Okada residents because Peralta wanted the pro
ject to be handled exclusively by the dormitory.
Peralta emphasized the diversity of the seven
member cast, more than half of whom are not of an
Asian ethnicity.
" The issues presented in the play, while specific to
Asian Pacific Islanders, can transcend ethnic bound
aries and be ably felt by members of other ethnic
groups," Peralta said.
Senior Ravi Faiia, an Okada ethnic theme associ
ate who will make a cameo appearance in the play,
said he feels that the diversity of the cast offers a pos
itive message.
"The [diversity] speaks for the fact you can care
about the issues of another com
munity and represent their inter
ests without being born into that
community," Faiia said.
This is the only play produced
at Stanford this year that has an
overtly Asian-American theme,
according to Peralta.
Though he expects a good
turnout from the Asian-Ameri
can community, he also said he
hopes that students outside of
this group will attend the pro
duction.
"We want to emphasize that
rather than to segregate the Stan
ford community, the play seeks to
unite it," Peralta said.

I o promote this sense of
unity and mutual understand
ing, there will be a short ques
tion-and-answer forum held
after the play.
1 he actors and producers will
then engage in a discussion with
members of the audience about
their experiences working with
such a diverse group and about
the various issues brought up in
the play.
I hope people will see the
value of talking about Asian Amer
ican issues in a candid, pertinent
way," Faiia said.
'What Now?" will be shown
from 8 to 10 p.m. this Wednesday
and Thursday at the Old Union
Clubhouse Ballroom.
Tickets are on sale now for $2
and will also be sold at the door
for $3.
