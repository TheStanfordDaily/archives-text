# Wireless data, volcanoes and more

### AMIT GARG STAFF WRITER 
Wireless data transmission is one of the hottest
topics in technology today. Current receiving tech
nology can sufficiently accommodate larger band
widths that transmit more data faster. The

transport system, however, presents
a more challenging problem.

Most Internet traffic goes
through telephone lines,
which are crammed with in
creasing amounts of text,
sound and video. Thus, com-

panies are researching so-called
ultrawideband systems using
radio transmissions.

These systems transform digital square waves
into analog pulse waves as the information is sent, and
back into digital waves as it reaches its destination.
Using efficient algorithms, such as Fourier transforms,
these machines can efficiently code and decode these
different types of waves.
NASA astronomers announced last month the dis

covery of a binary pulsar-star system, only the sec
ond to be found. Pulsars are neutron stars, or dense
remnants of supernova explosions, that revolve at
extreme rates.
In the binary system, the pulsar takes gaseous mat
ter from its companion, basically eating the other star.

The companion will continue losing

mass to the pulsar until it dwindles
to a very small size.

Astrophysicists have hailed
. the discovery as a sign that
I many such systems exist. It
* also provides support to the
spin-up theory, which relates

spin differences to magnetic
fields and transfer of matter be
tween stars.

If a volcano explodes, does the Earth become hot
ter or cooler? A volcanic eruption releases greenhouse
gases that trap sunlight and dust particles that can
block it.

Geophysicist Brian Soden and
colleagues at Princeton analyzed
the explosion of Mount Pinatubo
in the Philippines in 1991 to settle
the question. The team measured
atmospheric water vapor after the
eruption with the changes predict
ed by standard climate models.
Soden observed that cooling
was proportional to the amount of
water present in the atmosphere.
The researchers also observed that
the atmosphere dried after the
eruption because colder air holds
less water.
Nuclear physicists have found
that it is a challenge to accelerate

electrons to near-light speeds.
Many are turning to super lasers as
a viable solution. leasers at high in
tensity can accelerate particles at
10,000 times the rate of standard
accelerators.
The trick behind producing
such high-intensity beams of light is
to stretch and then compress a co
herent, monochromatic wave —
that is, a wave that has only one fre
quency, without any kind of de
structive interference.
Besides helping decipher the se
crets of the atom, these lasers have
potential applications in radiation
therapy and medical imaging.
Plastic may be the newest addi
tion to surgical instruments, ac
cording to Robert linger from the
University of Technology in (Jer
many. A plastic material that can tie

itself into a knot has shown great
promise for use as a thread.
The material is made of thermo
plastic polymers, which means its
shape is dependent on the temper
ature. Thus it can be engineered to
have a certain shape, which it ac
quires when reaching body tem
perature.
Langer tested the plastic in mice
and was able to make the plastic
threads tie themselves. Langer be
lieves such auto-folding devices can
help surgeons operate in places of
difficult to access. However, he rec
ognized that more research needs
to be done before testing the plastic
thread on humans.
The Sixth U.N. Conference on
Biodiversity brought together
aboyt 2,000 delegates from 182
countries to The Hague, The

Netherlands, in April. Participants
discussed how to encourage gov
ernments to halt the destruction of
forests around the world.
Delegates also tried to establish
the first-ever guidelines on genetic
resources and how companies and
individuals should share them. Es
tablishing a balance between devel
opment and protection is a chal
lenge, given that 80 percent of the
world's biodiversity is in develop
ing countries.
According to U.N. statistics, 1
percent of tropical forests disap
peared each year in the 1980s — a
50 percent increase over the previ
