# Wireless data, volcanoes and more

Wireless data transmission is one of the hottest
topics in technology today. Current receiving tech
nology can sufficiently accommodate larger band
widths that transmit more data faster. The

transport system, however, presents
a more challenging problem.

Most Internet traffic goes
through telephone lines,
which are crammed with in
creasing amounts of text,
sound and video. Thus, com-

panies are researching so-called
ultrawideband systems using
radio transmissions.

These systems transform digital square waves
into analog pulse waves as the information is sent, and
back into digital waves as it reaches its destination.
Using efficient algorithms, such as Fourier transforms,
these machines can efficiently code and decode these
different types of waves.
NASA astronomers announced last month the dis

covery of a binary pulsar-star system, only the sec
ond to be found. Pulsars are neutron stars, or dense
remnants of supernova explosions, that revolve at
extreme rates.
In the binary system, the pulsar takes gaseous mat
ter from its companion, basically eating the other star.

The companion will continue losing

mass to the pulsar until it dwindles
to a very small size.

Astrophysicists have hailed
. the discovery as a sign that
I many such systems exist. It
* also provides support to the
spin-up theory, which relates

spin differences to magnetic
fields and transfer of matter be
tween stars.

If a volcano explodes, does the Earth become hot
ter or cooler? A volcanic eruption releases greenhouse
gases that trap sunlight and dust particles that can
block it.
