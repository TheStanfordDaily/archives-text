## The
						Stanford Daily Ram's Head spring musical choice offers balance 
### 
Published Since J 891

The Ram's Head Theatrical Society's
decision to produce "West Side
Story" as its main show next spring
offers a balance between lesser
known musicals like "The Mystery of Edwin
Drood," which was produced in April, and
Broadway hits such as "A Chorus Line," which
was produced in Spring 2001.
Organization members showed great en
thusiasm about West Side Story when the de
cision was announced Saturday at Ram's
Head's annual Gala event. Already, the orga
nization has begun the process of recruiting
students to work on all aspects of the spring
show. Since Ram's Head is Stanford's largest
and oldest student-organized theatrical soci
ety, its previous experiences producing such
large-scale shows should aid in its current en
deavor to bring West Side Story to Memorial

Auditorium's stage.
It has been difficult for the organization to
recruit males who are willing to sing and
dance in such productions. Undoubtedly,
Stanford draws from a highly talented group
of students. Yet even with this talented pool
to draw from, very few males actually turn
out for auditions. Male students are more
likely to be seen in other venues of perfor
mance art such as a capella groups, sym
phonic events, or working behind the stages
as technical help.
Likewise, female students seem to be in the
majority of auditions for acting and dancing
parts but are less likely to be seen working on
the technical aspects of these large-scale pro
ductions. Productions as large as "West Side
Story" call for equally large groups of people
to be working behind the scenes and should

allow all students who wish to participate to
join in some capacity.
Similarly, there seems to be a shortage of
students from within the communities of
color auditioning for such production. Al
though Ram's Head has made ardent efforts
in recruiting these students over the last cou
ple of years, their turnout in auditions still
remains low.
All students should realize the vast oppor
tunities that are afforded at Stanford, espe
cially in the arts. Ram's Head and other the
atrical organizations should benefit from the
diverse population available. Obviously, the
more students that audition overall, the
higher the quality of the talent pool from
which these productions may draw. If the
number of students auditioningfor the musi
cal increases, the audience can be assured

that "West Side Story" will be an increadibly
enjoyable performance.
These groups' auditions are open to any
one who wishes to join the organizations. Op
portunities are available to work on all as
pects of these shows, including acting, de
sign, choreography, producing, public rela
tions, and financial matters.
Just because one may not be theatrically in
clined does not mean one cannot to be involved
with other aspects of the production. Students
should check out the Ram's Head Web site,
which is http://www.stanford.edu/group/rams
head/, for futher information about ways to get
involved with "West Side Story."
We eagerly await the performance of next
spring's musical, and sincerely hopes that
Ram's Heads productions and casting will
improve upon Hollywood's.
