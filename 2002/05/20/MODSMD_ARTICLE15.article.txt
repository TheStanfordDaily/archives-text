# DANCING IN CIRCLES
## Creating community 
### 
To follow up on last week's en
lightening investigation of the
myths surrounding Row
House life, I'd like to say a lit
tle bit about Stanford's co-op communi
ty. I was fortunate enough to spend two
years at Dag Hammarskjold Interna
tional House, the little-known, 26-resi
dent, quiet little co-op.
Quiet, that is, on the outside. Inside
was a different story. Never could a day
go by without a joyful screaming match,
a tickle fight or a super-soaker ambush.
To me, Hammarskjold was an ex
tended family. We ate dinner together,
watched the Simpsons together and set
out en masse to take over the Stanford
party scene.
We shared our cultural traditions and
identities with each other, and we teased

each other to no end. In
such a small house, you
see, everyone knew ev
eryone else's business —
but in an affectionate
way, really.
I'm sure not everyone
felt this way about our
little mansion on Alvara
do Row. But to many of

us, Hammarskjold was very much home,
at least fora while.
But the earth turned on its axis many
times over, as it tends to do, and one day
there was no more Hammarskjold. I
wandered the stark halls of our now
empty house and wondered how it was
possible that such a bustling, energetic
place had become such a vacuum.
What had we really had anyway? If
the community could just evaporate in
an instant after graduation, how gen
uine could it possibly have been? It made
me wonder: What exactly is the basis of a
community? How is it created, and what
does it consist of? Co-ops have a leg
endary reputation for promoting close
community. What makes them so differ
ent from, say, Row houses?
I here are some obvious hypotheses.
Presumably, people who draw into co
ops come to their residences seeking new
friends and a communal experience.
People may be more willing to attend or
even organize house events. Cooking
and cleaning together creates an auto
matic block of time in which residents
can get to know each other. And you
tetid to put more care into your actions
when you know that next week it will be
you who has to clean the bathroom. In a
way, the necessity for people to work to
gether creates the community.
Not that all co-op communities coop
erate equally well. The degree to which a
house bonds depends on the commit
ment level of the staff and the willingness
of residents to put time into getting to
know each other.
But this whole idea of "creating com

munity" is a bit odd. I have a suspicion
that there are places in the world where
this concept might be quite foreign. Why
would you have to create a community?
Isn't community something that exists,
by definition, among people who live
close to each other? People depending
on each other, sharing their lives —
that's what the community is made of.
But you've got to start where you are,
and as students we don't stay in one
place very long. It's hard to establish the
comfort and rhythm of a community
when you know that it is temporary, and
next year you'll have to start over. It's ad
mirable that in many of the co-ops on
campus, people are actively trying to
build this sense of sharing.
I wonder sometimes, what enables
this kind of sharing to happen? As much
as co-opers would like to feel indepen
dent from the University, there are
many aspects of a house that wouldn't
function without student Housing Ser
vices. Sure, we clean our own bath
rooms, but who fixes the windows when
they break? Who inspects to see that the
kitchen is clean and healthy? Who are
you gonna call when the toilet won't get
unstuck? That would be Facilities.
And that, is seems, is the myth of the
co-op community.
On the surface there is this sense that
v all we need is to work together in our
community, and we will be able to live by
our own labor. But looking a little closer.
Many behind-the-scenes things are
taken care of for us.
There are many places in Stanford stu
dent life where this issue arises. Take
White Plaza, for example. At high noon
people hang out and eat lunch in the sun,
walking barefoot on the hot pavement.
That's great. It livens up the campus and
invites us to learn more about each other.
But the thing is, you can't go walking
around barefoot just anywhere. Have
you ever seen someone take off their
shoes and prance around in the middle
of the city? I don't think so.
T he only reason we can take off our
shoes in White Pla/.a is that someone —
probably someone we don't know —
has spent a lot of time and effort making
sure that ground is spotless.
Which is not to say that barefoot is bad.
I can't make a judgement like that. But it
is something we should think about, dis
cuss with students and non-students.
To try, even for the fleeting moment
of an undergraduate career, to share life
with other people can be a frustrating
bur a rewarding experience.
Maybe we can carry that effort with us
when we move out from under the
watchful eye of Residential Education
and into the larger community.

you ever seen someone take off their
shoes and prance around in the middle
of the city? I don't think so.
T he only reason we can take off our
shoes in White Pla/.a is that someone —
probably someone we don't know —
has spent a lot of time and effort making
sure that ground is spotless.
Which is not to say that barefoot is bad.
I can't make a judgement like that. But it

To follow up on last week's en
lightening investigation of the
myths surrounding Row
House life, I'd like to say a lit
tle bit about Stanford's co-op communi
ty. I was fortunate enough to spend two
years at Dag Hammarskjold Interna
tional House, the little-known, 26-resi
dent, quiet little co-op.
Quiet, that is, on the outside. Inside
was a different story. Never could a day
go by without a joyful screaming match,
a tickle fight or a super-soaker ambush.
To me, Hammarskjold was an ex
tended family. We ate dinner together,
watched the Simpsons together and set
out en masse to take over the Stanford
party scene.
We shared our cultural traditions and
identities with each other, and we teased

each other to no end. In
such a small house, you
see, everyone knew ev
eryone else's business —
but in an affectionate
way, really.
I'm sure not everyone
felt this way about our
little mansion on Alvara
do Row. But to many of

us, Hammarskjold was very much home,
at least fora while.
But the earth turned on its axis many
times over, as it tends to do, and one day
there was no more Hammarskjold. I
wandered the stark halls of our now
empty house and wondered how it was
possible that such a bustling, energetic
place had become such a vacuum.
What had we really had anyway? If
the community could just evaporate in
an instant after graduation, how gen
uine could it possibly have been? It made
me wonder: What exactly is the basis of a
community? How is it created, and what
does it consist of? Co-ops have a leg
endary reputation for promoting close
community. What makes them so differ
ent from, say, Row houses?
I here are some obvious hypotheses.
Presumably, people who draw into co
ops come to their residences seeking new
friends and a communal experience.
People may be more willing to attend or
even organize house events. Cooking
and cleaning together creates an auto
matic block of time in which residents
can get to know each other. And you
tetid to put more care into your actions
when you know that next week it will be
you who has to clean the bathroom. In a
way, the necessity for people to work to
gether creates the community.
Not that all co-op communities coop
erate equally well. The degree to which a
house bonds depends on the commit
ment level of the staff and the willingness
of residents to put time into getting to
know each other.
But this whole idea of "creating com

munity" is a bit odd. I have a suspicion
that there are places in the world where
this concept might be quite foreign. Why
would you have to create a community?
Isn't community something that exists,
by definition, among people who live
close to each other? People depending
on each other, sharing their lives —
that's what the community is made of.
But you've got to start where you are,
and as students we don't stay in one
place very long. It's hard to establish the
comfort and rhythm of a community
when you know that it is temporary, and
next year you'll have to start over. It's ad
mirable that in many of the co-ops on
campus, people are actively trying to
build this sense of sharing.
I wonder sometimes, what enables
this kind of sharing to happen? As much
as co-opers would like to feel indepen
dent from the University, there are
many aspects of a house that wouldn't
function without student Housing Ser
vices. Sure, we clean our own bath
rooms, but who fixes the windows when
they break? Who inspects to see that the
kitchen is clean and healthy? Who are
you gonna call when the toilet won't get
unstuck? That would be Facilities.
And that, is seems, is the myth of the
co-op community.
On the surface there is this sense that
v all we need is to work together in our
community, and we will be able to live by
our own labor. But looking a little closer.
Many behind-the-scenes things are
taken care of for us.
There are many places in Stanford stu
dent life where this issue arises. Take
White Plaza, for example. At high noon
people hang out and eat lunch in the sun,
walking barefoot on the hot pavement.
That's great. It livens up the campus and
invites us to learn more about each other.
But the thing is, you can't go walking
around barefoot just anywhere. Have
you ever seen someone take off their
shoes and prance around in the middle
of the city? I don't think so.
T he only reason we can take off our
shoes in White Pla/.a is that someone —

cuss with students and non-students.

with other people can be a frustrating
bur a rewarding experience.
