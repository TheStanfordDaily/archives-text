U.S. should help Cuba by ending embargo
I am writing about The Daily's editori
al on Friday. I feel you painted an ex
tremely negative view of Cuba. Living in
the United States, we are fed plenty of
anti-Cuba propaganda as it is, and the ed
itorial did not help the situation.
Cuba is an incredible country with a lot
going for it. There are plenty of good as
pects of Cuba such as its health care and
educational systems, which are far better
than those in many other countries.
Cubans are educated, healthy individuals
living in a communist country. The vast
majority of Cubans support Castro as their
leader, and it is in no way beneficial for the
United States to impose its own political
agenda on their country.
If Stanford students want to help
Cubans, we should lobby to end the em
bargo which is incredibly damaging to
the Cuban economy. Not only does the
United States ban trade with Cuba, but
we pressure other countries to follow
our lead and not do business with Cuba
as well.
The United States is in no place to im

pose a democracy on the Cuban people,
instead we should help the Cuban people
by ending the embargo.

Israeli forces 'deliberately expelled'
Palestinians between 1947 and 1949
In your article regarding Nakba re
membrance, you gave equal weight to
competing claims that between 1947 and
1949 Zionist forces expelled Palestinians
refugees, and that the refugees left of their
own accord. This, however, is not the
stance of most serious historians.
In his landmark book "The Birth of the
Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947-1949"
historian Benny Morris once and for all
laid to rest myths that the Palestinians vol
untarily left their homes, or were encour
aged to do so by their leaders.
1 listorians such as Norman Finkelstein
and I lan Pappe have gone further, claim
ing that Zionist forces deliberately ex
pelled hundreds of thousands of Palestini
ans between 1947 and 1949. As scholar

Lisa Hajjar and Stanford History prof.
Joel Beinin point out, "One Israeli mili
tary intelligence document indicates that
at least 75 percent of the refugees left due
to Zionist or Israeli military actions, psy
chological campaigns aimed at frighten
ing Arabs into leaving and direct expul
sions. Only abov.t 5 percent left on orders
from Arab authorities."
I appreciate e p .orts by The Daily to pro
vide balanced coverage of the Palestine-Is
rael conflict. However, journalistic bal
ance ought not be achieved at the expense
of historical truth.
