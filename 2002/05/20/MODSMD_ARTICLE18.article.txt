# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Hindu community at Stanford must address Gujarat violence 
### SURAJ JACOB GUEST COLUMNIST 
The Daily's front-page coverage of the
Stanford rally in protest of violence in
India and the editorial on the subject of
the Gujarat violence were welcome ef
forts at focusing the attention of the Stan
ford community on some very disturb
ing trends.
It is troubling that the Indian commu
nity in the United States in general, and in
Stanford in particular, has not communi
cated a deep sense of grief and outrage at
the religious fundamentalism that has
killed 2,000 people in two months, and still
continues to destroy. As The Daily's edito
rial points out, the Stanford Indian com
munity has organized two events to mark
the continuing tragedy of Gujarat. While

decidedly positive, these events have not
attracted much response even within the
Stanford Indian community. This only
emphasizes a very uncomfortable truth:
We have reacted to the worst religious
blood-letting in India in a decade with a
deep silence — whether it be a silence of
indifference or of complicity.
As a liberal, I hope that the Stanford
Indian community's silence is at least the
type that condemns religious hatred and
the violence in Gujarat, even if— sadly —
it finds it unnecessary to do so publicly,
whether internally or externally.
However, some recent developments
in Stanford are very disturbing. The
Stanford I lindu Students Council and its
parent body — the national Hindu Stu
dents Council based in Boston — have
maintained a stone-faced silence on the

subject of Hindus killing large numbers
of Muslims.
Ironically, the national Hindu Stu
dents Council was quick to strongly con
demn Islamic fundamentalism after Sept.
11 and irresponsibly linked that terrible
incident with Muslim attacks on Hindus
in India, both imagined and real.
The Hindu Students Council has
done nothing to distance itself from
VHP-America, a sectarian organization
that claims the Hindu Students Council
implicitly as its "program."
VHP-America has been disappoint
ingly sectarian at this time of great reli
gious animosity — while it strongly con
demned the brutal killing of 58 Hindus
by Muslims in Godhra, it remained con
sciously silent on the twenty-fold retalia
tory killings of Muslims by Hindus.

Furthermore, VHP-America has
stoked the fires of bigotry by linking the
Godhra incident with Sept. 11 and call
ing for the construction of a temple at
Ayodhya that has already claimed thou
sands of lives over the last decade.
The Daily's editorial of May 16th
mentions the fact that in its Hinduism
Awareness Week, the Hindu Students
Council thought it best not to mention
the Hindu fundamentalism that has led
to most of the Gujarat violence. Strange
ly enough, in a course initiated by the
Hindu Students Council at Stanford in
the current quarter, the only section de
voted to the happenings in Gujarat has
been a limp session on anti-Hindu bias in
the media representation of the Gujarat
carnage — itself a questionable claim.
Incidentally, there was a whole class de

voted to Hindus as persecuted minori
ties in Kashmir and Pakistan, but noth
ing about Hindus as persecuting majori
ties in many parts of India, most signifi
cantly Gujarat.
These are disturbing times. To adapt a
metaphor from another religion, I hope
that the Hindu Students Council and oth
ers who seem to silendy condone some
types of religious fundamentalism see the
beams in their own eyes even as they spot
those in others. Hindus and Muslims are
both victims and perpetrators of ghastly
crimes. Let not our enthusiasm for reli
gion snuff out our humanity. Let us break
out of our parochial silences.
