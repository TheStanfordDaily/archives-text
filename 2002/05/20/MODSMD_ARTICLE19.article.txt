# CAPS resources challenged
## 
### ANNE BECKER STAFF WRITER 
Though many Stanford students are still un
comfortable admitting feeling depressed to their
friends, they have sought official counseling from
Counseling and Psychological Services in record
numbers, leaving the center overtaxed and desper
ately trying to accommodate the rising numbers of
students seeking help.
Many who have sought that help said say they
are frustrated by what they perceive as the center's
lack of availability. Students complain of long wait
ing lists for appointments and cite a tendency for
the center to make referrals to off-campus psychol
ogists or psychiatrists instead of addressing student
problems at the center. Some students also say they
are dissatisfied with the lack of breadth in expertise
of CAPS staff.
Alejandro Martinez, the director of CAPS, ad
mitted these concerns were valid and that the cen
ter was pressed for resources.
"We are experiencing a steady increase in the
number of visits and students we see and it is truly
challenging our resources as a result," he said.
Martinez projected that student visits would con
tinue to increase in future years. He said that the
number of students willing to seek help at CAPS has
increased. Therefore, an increase in the number of
depressed students who come to CAPS may not be
indicative of increased depression on campus.
The majority of students seen at CAPS are those

with short-term problems that can be attended to in
the 10 free sessions the University provides. Stu
dents with more serious psychological problems re
quiring more open-ended, long-term care are often
referred oft campus after an initial assessment.
Though students sometimes perceive these re
ferrals as a refusal from CAPS to see them, Martinez
said they are often in the students' best interests.
Martinez said he was happy that for the first
time in years, CAPS will be receiving more re
sources from the University. This will enable the
center to take 011 another full-time staff member
and occupy more office space in the Vaden Health
Center opening in the fall. Not counting part time
psychologists, the center currently has less than 10
full-time employees serving Stanford's entire stu
dent population.
"I feel very fortunate that the University has con
sidered more resources in a time when they are
strapped for economic reasons," he said. " The ad
ministration knows we're stretched and we need help
to keep with die demand and provide quality care."
Despite increased funding, Martinez said the
center would need significantly more resources to
be able to see every student seeking care, but that the
variability in clinician expertise needed made this
virtually unfeasible regardless of funding. He also
pointed out that CAPS has staff on call at nights and
weekends for any student with an urgent problem.
"Our main goal is to be accessible to students who
need our services," he said. "The challenge now is
just to keep up with the new students coming in."
