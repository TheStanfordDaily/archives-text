## Stanford takes series from Bruins 
### MALCOLM LEVINE STAFF WRITER 
In the middle of a heated race for
the Pacific 10 Conference crown,
countless cliches could have been
used for the No. 7 Cardinal's (37-16,
13-8 Pac-10) series at UCLA (26-30, 9-
12) this past weekend. It's do or die.
Backs are up against the wall. It's time
to put or shut up.
Well, now that the drama has sub
sided, it is clear that the Cardinal
definitely is not dead yet. It won two
of three games against the Bruins
and gained a game on No. 20 South
ern California (31-21, 14-7) — who
lost two of three to Arizona State
(32-19, 12-9) — to move into a sec
ond-place tie with Washington (28-
24-1, 13-8).

With one weekend left in the regu
lar season, the Cardinal and the
Huskies both sit just a game behind
the first-place Trojans, setting up a
wild finish to this year's Pac-10 race.
Stanford's weekend got underway
on Friday night with an 11-0 victory,
as junior ace Jeremy Guthrie pitched
a complete-game shutout — his
fourth consecutive complete game.
Guthrie dominated from start to
finish, striking out a career-high 13
batters, while giving up only 6 hits and
no walks.
"I felt confident," said Guthrie,
who is now 9-1 with a 2.68 ERA on the
season. "I pitched well in some big sit
uations, especially early in the game,
when I was able to get outs with peo
ple on base."
Stanford's offensive attack provid-

Ed more than enough support for
Guthrie, as junior outfielder Jason
Cooper led the charge with the
game's only home run and his 11th of
the season.
Sophomore centerfielder Sam
Fuld and senior third baseman
Scott Dragicevich picked up three
hits apiece in the win, as five Cardi
nal batters had two or more hits in
the game.
On Saturday afternoon, the Bruins
responded with a 9-4 win to even the
series.
The Cardinal actually held a 4-2
lead after scoring three runs in the top
of the sixth, but two home runs by
UCLA starting pitcher Wes Whisler
quickly erased the Cardinal's lead.
With UCLA leading 5-4 in the bot
tom of the eighth, Whisler pounded
the final nail into Stanford's coffin,
hitting a grand slam off of junior re
liever Ryan McCally to put the game
out of reach.
Despite the loss, there were a few
bright spots for the Cardinal offen
sively. Fuld and Cooper had two hits
apiece, as Fuld recorded his 18th mul
tiple-hit game in his last 20 games, a
stretch in which he has hit for an im
pressive .531 average.
Senior reliever Dan Rich (1 -2) took
the loss for the Cardinal, giving up
two runs in just 1/3 of an inning, as
sophomore starter John Hudgins left
the game with a 4-3 lead.
The Cardinal regrouped from Sat
urday's disappointing loss and re
turned on Sunday with a vengeance,
trouncing the Bruins 17-4 in the rub
ber game of the three-game set.
The team tied a season-high with
five home runs, as freshman Chris
Carter led the way with two blasts out
ofjackie Robinson Stadium in his first
start since May 1.
Junior catcher Ryan Garko, Drag
icevich, and Cooper all had homers as
well, as the Cardinal notched 21 hits
in the win.
Cooper went 3 for 5 to cap off a
weekend during which the All-Ameri
can candidate punished the Bruins
with seven hits, including two home
runs, and five RBI.
Junior lefty Tim Cunningham (7-
2) got the win for the Cardinal, giving
up three earned runs in seven innings
while striking out six.
With both USC and Washington
losing on Sunday, the victory meant
that the Cardinal picked up a game in
the hotly-contested Pac-10 race. Every
member of the team certainly knew
that a sweep would have resulted in a
first-place tie with USC.
Next weekend, the Cardinal will
host conference cellar dweller Wash
ington State (21-30, 6-15) for the final
series of the regular season, while
USC is at UCLA and Washington
faces Arizona (30-22, 8-13) at home.
"This was a big win for us as far as
our chances of still winning a Pac-10
regular season title," said head coach
Mark Marquess. "It should be a fun
final weekend."
