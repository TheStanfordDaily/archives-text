EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.
(AP) — They ran at every opportu
nity, scored without much difficulty
and never once trailed.
And with Jason Kidd doing
everything he has done all season,
the New Jersey Nets showed why
they're the No. 1 team in the East.
Picking apart Boston's vaunted
defense with surprising ease, the
Nets beat Boston 104-97 Sunday
night in Game 1 of the Eastern Con
ference finals.
From shooting percentages to
rebounding to the ability to dictate
the tempo, the Nets dominated the
Celtic sin nearly every facet of the
game. Most important wast he way
they produced easy baskets, 19 of
them layups or dunks.
"We didn't even play a lick of de
fense all night," Boston's Paul
Pierce said.
Pierce stated before the series
that the Nets had no one who could
defend him. What Pierce didn't
mention was that something else —
foul trouble — could stop him.
Pierce scored 14 points in the
first quarter but was a non-factor

offensively the rest of the way. He
picked up his third and fourth
fouls in a l()-second span early in
the third quarter, and the Nets
went on an 18-8 run after he went
to the bench.
Pierce didn't score again until
8:21 remained in the game. By
then, the Nets had built their lead
as high as 17 and were able to with
stand a rally that got the Celtics
within six with under 2 minutes left.
Kidd finished with 18 points, 13
rebounds and 11 assists, getting the
triple-double with 3:53 left when he
fed Keith Van Horn fora jumper
that gave the Nets a 97-86 lead.
Kerry Kittles, Todd MacCul
locli and Van Horn scored 14
apiece, and seven Nets reached
double figures.
"There's more than one guy
who can put the ball in the basket,
and being unselfish and trying to
play the right way — that's been our
motto the whole season," Kidd said.
Pierce and Antoine Walker led
Boston with 27 points each.
Much was made before the series
about the offensive talents of Pierce

and Walker and Boston's edge in 3-
point shooting, but the Nets negat
ed it by capitalizing on a factor that
was not highlighted in recent days
— their height advantage.
New Jersey outrebounded
Boston 49-38 and scored 48 points
in the paint. Kenyon Martin scored
only nine points, but his defensive
presence inside helped the Nets
deter the Celtics from taking the
ball to the basket.
Boston settled for far too many
outside shots, even fora team that
relies so much on the 3-point shot.
The Celtics hoisted 29 3s, making
10, and shot just 41 percent overall.
"Their halfcourt offense, their
movement, 1 thought they were
very, very crisp," Celtics coach Jim
O'Brien said. "Our defense was not
up to the standard that New Jersey
set with their offense."
Game 2 is Tuesday night at the
Meadowlands.
The Celtics' defense, which held
the Detroit Pistons to just 79.4
points per game in the second
round, was nowhere to be found in
this game.
