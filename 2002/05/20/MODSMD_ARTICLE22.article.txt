## 
### DEBORAH SPLANSKY STAFF WRITER 
This weekend, the No. 8 Stanford softball
team (44-20) entered postseason play in the
toughest regional tournament in the country
and fell short of earning its second berth to
the Women's College World Series.
Stanford journeyed to Fresno where the
No. 2-seeded Cardinal was joined by Cal
State-Fullerton, California, Fresno State,
University of Pacific and Evansville.
The Cardinal had previously faced all of
the squads except for the unfamiliar Evans
ville and had beaten each team at least once
during the season.
T his year's regional first pitted the Cardi
nal against the UOP, which Stanford beat last
year to earn its first ever trip to the Women's
College World Series.
Junior pitcher Tori Nyberg started the
game in the circle for the Cardinal, while se
nior Ail-American Cindy Ball made the start
for the Tigers.
Nyberg and Ball kept both offenses silent
until Stanford broke through in the bottom
of the third inning.
Senior shortstop Robin Walker and senior
centerfielder Jessica Mendoza kicked off the
rally with back-to-back singles before junior
second baseman Kira Ching hit a one-out
triple to score both runners.
Junior leftfielder Cassi Brangham
reached base on a walk before sophomore
catcher Jessica Allister singled through the
middle to drive home Ching and give the
Cardinal a 3-0 lead.
T he Cardinal tacked on two more runs in
the fourth inning when Brangham hit a
two-out RBI single to extend the Cardinal
lead to five and allowed Stanford to make a
pitching change.
Junior pitcher Maureen LeCocq entered
the game in the fifth inning, allowing Nyberg
to rest after her four-inning no-hit stint.
The Tigers' first two hitters of the inning
reached base with back-to-back singles, but

LeCocq settled down and retired the next
three batters, including two strikeouts.
LeCocq earned her second save by working
three shutout innings.
The Cardinal didn't stop its attack at the
plate there. In the bottom of the sixth inning,
Ching sent a two-run bomb over the left-field
fence to round out the scoring and secure
Stanford's 7-0 victory.
Stanford celebrated its win, but refocused
for an intense face-off against East Hay rival
and Pac-10 foe California.
Cal entered the game with a 2-1 season ad
vantage over the Cardinal, with both wins
coming in close one-run decisions.
Nybergand Cal pitcher Jocelyn Forest du
eled for six scoreless innings until Cal waged
a successful offensive attack with two outs in
the bottom of the sixth inning.
Third baseman Candace Harper started
wit!l a single. Nyberg then walked first baseman
Veronica Nelson before catcher Courtney Scott
blasted a line drive to center field that sailed just
out of reach of Mendoza and pushed Harper
across for the only run of the game.
Stanford did not walk away quietly and at
tempted a comeback in the top of the seventh
inning.
Brangham flied out for the first out of the
inning, but Allister followed with a double
down the left field line. LeCocq stepped into
the box and ripped a hard line drive that
went straight to Haper, who recorded the
second out of the inning. Forest then shut
down the rally with a strikeout, her seventh of
the game.
"It was just a classic Cal-Stanford
matchup," said head coach John Rittman.
"We had three opportunities to score with
runners on base. We had two line-drive hits
that were caught and Cal had a line drive hit
that fell in. That's just the way it goes."
Stanford was still alive after one loss, but
knew it had a tough road ahead. Stanford
moved into the loser's bracket to face the top-

Beeson advanced on a double steal

batter later, Brangham walked to
load the bases. Allister came
through with a single up the mid

But Stanford's only lead of the
game was short-lived as eight hit

tans, who plated two runners to
claim a 2-1 advantage.
Krista O'Hanian led off with a
single before Cardinal starter Ny
berg retired the next two hitters.
However, back-to-back walks
loaded the bases and Yasmin
Mossadeghi and Amy La√üocque
followed with consecutive RBI sin

After giving up a lead-off sin

second inning, starter Gina Oaks
retired 15 consecutive Cardinal
batters.
"It seemed like wherever we hit
balls, a Fullerton defender was
there," Rittman said. "You have to
tip your cap to Fullerton, they
played stellar defense."
The Titans notched single runs
in the fourth and fifth innings to ex
tend their lead to 4-1. With two out
in the top of the fourth inning, Gina
Oaks was hit by a pitch and came
around to score on a double by
Jodie Cox. Fullerton upped its lead
