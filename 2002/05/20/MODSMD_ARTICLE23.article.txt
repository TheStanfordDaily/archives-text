# Golf ends season with 17th-place finish at NCAA West Regionals
## 
### MATT BABIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford golf team had been riding quite
the carousel over the last month. Coming off of a
fall season that was below many expectations, the
team started off slowly in the spring.
After a trip to the desert, however, the team
started to pick up the place. Coming out of the ASU
Thunderbird/SAVANE Invitational, the Cardinal
turned in two consecutive second-place finishes,
earning a spot in the NCAA West Regional field.
Unfortunately, this weekend in New Mexico,
the Cardinal placed 17th in a field of 27 teams.
Only the top 10 schools advanced to the NCAA
Championships to be held in Columbus, Ohio,
May 29 through June 1 so the Cardinal's season
came to an end.
The Cardinal went into the weekend riding the
recent streaks of senior Phil Rowe and junior Jim
Seki, who took individual honors at the U.S. Inter
collegiate and the Pacific 1.0 Conference Champi
onships, respectively.
Rowe, in his last tournament as a Stanford
golfer, once again paced his team. Ile was the high
est Cardinal finisher, as his 222 put him in a tie for
44th place. Sophomore Blake Mastalir followed

Rowe's lead and also carded a 222.
Junior Ron Won finished in 51st position with a
three-round total of 223, while junior Jim Seki was
just three shots back (226), earning him a share of
72nd place.
As a team, the Cardinal marked an 891 (303-297-
291). In what became somewhat of its trademark
during the season, the squad improved as the tour
nament progressed.
Tied for 21st after the first round, the team
came back stronger on the second day to move up
two spots.
New Mexico and Washington won the tourna
ment, turning in three-round totals of 872. Indi
vidual honors were also a tie, as Ricky Barnes of Ari
zona and Justin Smith of Minnesota finished with a
six-under 210 for the tournament.
For the Cardinal, it was a bittersweet end to a
surprising season.
While early play fell short of expectations for an
always competitive program, spirits were still high
for the season. By the spring season, excellent play
from the veterans of the squad brought Stanford
back as a I'ac-10 power.
Rowe leaves Stanford after another stellar sea
son, capped with the honor of being named to the
All Pac-10 first team.
