# Houston snags first pick over unlucky Warriors in draft lottery
## 
### 
OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — Things didn't
go its way, but the NBA draft still holds
plenty of possibilities for the Golden State
Warriors.
Golden State got the third overall pick
from the draft lottery Sunday, falling two
spots in the projected order. Houston won
despite having an 8.9 percent chance, and
Chicago finished second.
Still, the Warriors' 12th trip to the lot
tery in the team's 18 seasons was an im
provement over last season, when they
dropped three spots to fifth overall. The
Warriors have their highest draft choice
since 1995, when they picked Joe Smith
with the top selection.
"I know there's going to be a good play

er there, but it would have been nice to be
No. 1 or 2," general manager Garry St.
Jean said.
The Warriors, who went a league-worst
21-61 to complete their eighth consecutive
season out of the playoffs, won't get first
crack at Duke point guard Jay Williams or
Chinese center Yao Ming, arguably the top
two prizes of the June 26 draft.
Williams and Yao are the two available
players most likely to make an immediate
impact with their new teams — but the
Warriors aren't giving up hope of landing
one of them just yet.
"I don't think anything is locked and
shut," St. Jean said. "I think teams will listen
to deals, or teams may choose to go in a dif

ferent direction."
St. Jean was quietly pleased when Steve
Francis, who represented Houston at the
lottery, told reporters that the Rockets
won't be picking a point guard. Williams,
the multitalented playmaker, would be a
welcome addition to a young, talented
backcourt of Jason Richardson and Gilbert
Arenas.
Yao, the nimble 7-foot-5 member of the
Shanghai Sharks, might scare off Houston
or Chicago with his inexperience or his
tricky relationship with his Chinese club.
Even if they can't land Williams or Yao,
the Warriors should have an eventful draft.
There are several outstanding players in
the draft's second tier — particularly Duke

swingman Mike Dunleavy, who might even
be the Rockets' choice if he elects to remain
in the draft rather than return to school.
Dunleavy is an outstanding outside
shooter — one of the Warriors' many weak
nesses last season. He also would allow
Antawn Jamison to log more minutes at
power forward.
Other possibilities include Kansas for
ward Drew Gooden — a San Francisco Bay
area high schooler; Memphis guard Da
juan Wagner; Connecticut forward Caron
Butler; and Maryland forward Chris
Wilcox.
"You've got some guys that could be an
eighth (pick) that you might have ranked at
No. 3," St. Jean said. "A lot of scenarios are

conceivable."
The Warriors have held the No. 3 pick
six times in their history, but just twice since
1966. In 1986, Golden State drafted Chris
Washburn, a horrendous bust; in 1993, the
Warriors picked Penny Hardaway and
traded him to Orlando for Chris Webber.
The Warriors will hold workouts with
as many as 30 players in the coming
weeks. They also hold the second pick of
the second round at No. 31 overall. St.
Jean also said the Warriors are no closer
to determining whether Brian Winters
will return as their head coach next sea
son. Winters went 13-46 as Golden State's
interim coach after taking over for Dave
Cowens on Dec. 15.
