## Unmasking depression at Stanford 
### ANNE BECKER STAFF WRITER 
It is 8 p.m. on a Thursday night and sopho
mores Rebecca Allen and Brett Lockspeiser
are waiting. The tea has been brewed and the
cookies set out. The door is open and the
room is quiet.
The students are co-facilitators of the Well
ness and Depression group at The Bridge, Stan
ford's peer counseling center. Since forming the
support group, they have posted fliers in bath
room stalls around campus and sent e-mails to
dorm lists. Initially, these efforts yielded spotty
attendance and the group saw a few regulars.
Then the regulars stopped coming. And
tonight, for the first time, no one has come at all.
Prospective students reading the "Fiske
Guide to Colleges" will note that Stanford is
characterized by "a sunny demeanor and an in
fectious West Coast optimism, an alternative to
the gloom that seems to hang over the Ivies."
Yet if recent figures from Stanford's Counseling
and Psychological Services Center are any indi
cation, depression is a real problem.
According to CAPS Director Alejandro Mar
tinez, the center had 8,055 student visits dur
ing the 2000-2001 academic year, a significant
portion of which were for depression. This
number is up from the 5,849 visits the center
had during the 1992-1993 school year, when it
started tracking student visits. These numbers
are similar to figures from the 2001 survey of
counseling center directors which reported a
nationwide 85 percent increase in severe psy
chological problems.
No school knows this better than Mil'. ('ited
as having one of the highest college suicide rates
in the country, 10 undergraduates have com

mitted suicide since 1990. The school created a
mental health task force after Elizabeth Shin, a
sophomore, set herself on fire in her dorm room
this year. Since the suicide, MIT administrators
have spoken of creating a more caring commu
nity, sponsoring more "official fun" and putting
adults in mentoring roles at the school.
Across the country in sunny California, Stan
ford might be assumed to be the antithesis,
where the laid-back atmosphere seems to clash
with the stress of MIT. Stanford, with its elabo
rate support networks like the Residential Edu
cation program, often sets itself apart from
high-pressure institutions like MIT. But if
CIA PS's figures are any indication, Stanford stu
dents are far from immune to depression.
With many factors at play, the issue of de
pression at Stanford is one difficult to untangle.
What is to blame and what is to be done when
life on The Farm is not so sunny?
Pre-arrival pressure
For some Stanford students, the struggle
with depression begins the minute they hit cam
pus, or even before. Facing selective college ad
missions, many high school students make the
goal of their academical and extracurricular
pursuits admission to a top school like Stanford.
For some, when that goal becomes a reality, they
are left with a void.
Allen herself has suffered from depression
at Stanford. From the time other children
made fun of her in elementary school, she
based her self-worth on high achievements
with the ultimate goal of gaining admission to
a top college like Stanford. Her participation
in groups and activities in high school was a
calculated move to impress the Stanford ad
missions of fice. Allen faced her first major de

pressive episode when her efforts paid off
and she was accepted to Stanford.
"My goal was always to get into a high achiev
ing college," she said. "I planned it carefully.
When I got my goal, I collapsed. There didn't
seem to be any purpose in doing anything any
more."
When she received her acceptance letter to
Stanford, Allen quit all of her extracurricular ac
tivities, and sunk into a depression that still con
tinues to be a problem today. She has had re
curring thoughts of suicide. On some days, she
has trouble getting out of bed.
As a result, she has lost jobs, struggled in
classes and has had to switch roommates twice in
the past two years.
"I thought the minute I got to Stanford
everything would be great," she said. "It just
wasn't."
As colleges are increasingly seeing students
with clinical depression applying for admis
sions, schools like 1 larvard have begun advising
certain accepted stressed students to take a year
off before setting foot on campus.
Christina Wire, special assistant to the dean
of undergraduate admissions, said that Stan
ford had not seen a rise in applications from
clinically depressed students and said she was
not aware of any policy of suggesting admitted
students take time off before college.
"Different types of students are attracted to
different environments," she said. "It may be
the case that competitive schools back East are
seeing trends that we're not."
But many students say they these trends are
very present on campus. "Kristin," a sopho
