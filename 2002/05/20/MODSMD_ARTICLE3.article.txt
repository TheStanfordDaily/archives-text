# DAILY INVESTIGATIVE REPORT
## Unmasking depression at Stanford 
### ANNE BECKER STAFF WRITER 
It is 8 p.m. on a Thursday night and sopho
mores Rebecca Allen and Brett Lockspeiser
are waiting. The tea has been brewed and the
cookies set out. The door is open and the
room is quiet.
The students are co-facilitators of the Well
ness and Depression group at The Bridge, Stan
ford's peer counseling center. Since forming the
support group, they have posted fliers in bath
room stalls around campus and sent e-mails to
dorm lists. Initially, these efforts yielded spotty
attendance and the group saw a few regulars.
Then the regulars stopped coming. And
tonight, for the first time, no one has come at all.
Prospective students reading the "Fiske
Guide to Colleges" will note that Stanford is
characterized by "a sunny demeanor and an in
fectious West Coast optimism, an alternative to
the gloom that seems to hang over the Ivies."
Yet if recent figures from Stanford's Counseling
and Psychological Services Center are any indi
cation, depression is a real problem.
According to CAPS Director Alejandro Mar
tinez, the center had 8,055 student visits dur
ing the 2000-2001 academic year, a significant
portion of which were for depression. This
number is up from the 5,849 visits the center
had during the 1992-1993 school year, when it
started tracking student visits. These numbers
are similar to figures from the 2001 survey of
counseling center directors which reported a
nationwide 85 percent increase in severe psy
chological problems.
No school knows this better than Mil'. ('ited
as having one of the highest college suicide rates
in the country, 10 undergraduates have com

mitted suicide since 1990. The school created a
mental health task force after Elizabeth Shin, a
sophomore, set herself on fire in her dorm room
this year. Since the suicide, MIT administrators
have spoken of creating a more caring commu
nity, sponsoring more "official fun" and putting
adults in mentoring roles at the school.
Across the country in sunny California, Stan
ford might be assumed to be the antithesis,
where the laid-back atmosphere seems to clash
with the stress of MIT. Stanford, with its elabo
rate support networks like the Residential Edu
cation program, often sets itself apart from
high-pressure institutions like MIT. But if
CIA PS's figures are any indication, Stanford stu
dents are far from immune to depression.
With many factors at play, the issue of de
pression at Stanford is one difficult to untangle.
What is to blame and what is to be done when
life on The Farm is not so sunny?
Pre-arrival pressure
For some Stanford students, the struggle
with depression begins the minute they hit cam
pus, or even before. Facing selective college ad
missions, many high school students make the
goal of their academical and extracurricular
pursuits admission to a top school like Stanford.
For some, when that goal becomes a reality, they
are left with a void.
Allen herself has suffered from depression
at Stanford. From the time other children
made fun of her in elementary school, she
based her self-worth on high achievements
with the ultimate goal of gaining admission to
a top college like Stanford. Her participation
in groups and activities in high school was a
calculated move to impress the Stanford ad
missions of fice. Allen faced her first major de

pressive episode when her efforts paid off
and she was accepted to Stanford.
"My goal was always to get into a high achiev
ing college," she said. "I planned it carefully.
When I got my goal, I collapsed. There didn't
seem to be any purpose in doing anything any
more."
When she received her acceptance letter to
Stanford, Allen quit all of her extracurricular ac
tivities, and sunk into a depression that still con
tinues to be a problem today. She has had re
curring thoughts of suicide. On some days, she
has trouble getting out of bed.
As a result, she has lost jobs, struggled in
classes and has had to switch roommates twice in
the past two years.
"I thought the minute I got to Stanford
everything would be great," she said. "It just
wasn't."
As colleges are increasingly seeing students
with clinical depression applying for admis
sions, schools like 1 larvard have begun advising
certain accepted stressed students to take a year
off before setting foot on campus.
Christina Wire, special assistant to the dean
of undergraduate admissions, said that Stan
ford had not seen a rise in applications from
clinically depressed students and said she was
not aware of any policy of suggesting admitted
students take time off before college.
"Different types of students are attracted to
different environments," she said. "It may be
the case that competitive schools back East are
seeing trends that we're not."
But many students say they these trends are
very present on campus. "Kristin," a sopho

attendance in recent weeks. '
anonymity, said her depression
began when she airived at Stan
ford.
"In high school, I got most of my
motivation to succeed from the
idea of getting into Stanford," she
said. "Then I got here and it was
like, 'Now what?' I didn't know
what I was shooting for. There was
nothing to make me want to do
things. I was just expecting so
much out of college."
Kristin said that, as many Stan
ford students come to realize upon
arriving here, she no longer felt
special for all she had achieved in
high school because she was in the
presence of so many other high
achieving students.
"You get here and suddenly
everyone is amazing," she ex
plained. "It'sjust tough to be around
such an intense environment."
Stressing the smile, even when
the smile causes stress
In addition to managing the
stress of academics, students na-

tionwide juggle involvement in
campus organizations, financial
concerns and their futures.
But at Stanford, many are reluc
tant to show their stress.
Gene Awakuni, the vice provost
for student affairs, worked at Co
lumbia before coming to Stanford
five months ago and said he sees a
difference in the way students at
both schools handle the stress of
college.
"The 'laid-back' nature of the
campus setting belies the intense
competition that exists here,"
Awakuni said. "At Columbia, the
competition among students was
quite evident, almost an 'in your
face' intensity. Here at Stanford, I
know students are studying hard
but it's something they seem to
keep to themselves. My sense is that
for Stanford students it's not cool to
be openly competitive.
"The pressure to measure up to
the Stanford image [of] being care
free and well-rounded may be
causing some students to feel
stressed out but because of the cam
pus culture [they] are unable or un
willing to talk about it."
Lockspeiser said students he has
counseled at the Bridge have of
fered a similar assessment of Stan-*
ford life.
"There's this aura that the 'nor
mal' Stanford student is a happy
go-lucky person who is always en
joying themselves and going out
with their friends," Lockspeiser
said. "When you don't feel that
way, you feel totally alienated, like
you are the only one who's not to
tally happy."
"Sarah," a sophomore who also
agreed to speak on the condition of
anonymity, said she knows this feel
ing. She suffered from unclassified
anxiety in high school, but was
never depressed until coming to
Stanford. In addition to struggling
with feelings of inadequacy in the
college environment, Sarah said

much of her depression stemmed
from what she perceived as every
one around her being happy while
she was not.
"I remember reading in the col
lege guides that students pretend
ed they never studied and that
work didn't exist, but that they
were really cramming in the li
brary," she said. "It's true. People
put on a happy front at Stanford. It
is only when you dig deeper that
you see that depression is all over
the campus and no one really talks
about it."
Sarah said she thought students'
reluctancy to show stress also de
tracted from forming the friend
ships vital to combating depres
sion. She is dealing with her de
pression with an off-campus thera
pist, taking a lighter course load
and making a conscious effort to
spend more time with friends.
Res Ed: Good intentions,
unintended results?
Students who said they felt this
pressure to be happy at Stanford
said one place it was strongest in
their residences. Unlike many other
schools, Stanford undergraduates
are ensured on-campus housing for

four years of their education.
The school's Residential Educa
tion program, which works under
the philosophy that living and
learning should be integrated,
places students in residences where
they are in constant contact with
faculty, residential staff and each
other. Throughout the year, resi
dent assistants sponsor informa
tional programs and social activi
ties that at many other schools
might end with orientation week.
Some Stanford students, howev
er, say Res Ed's programs actually
contribute to their depression.
Allen explained that some
times Res Ed programs backfire
on a depressed person who might
not feel up to attending them and
might feel stigmatized for not
doing so. During her depressive
episodes, she can sleep up to 16
hours a day and spends much
time in her room watching TV.
She said she sometimes does not
even go down to dinner in her
house because the social pressure
to look happy is too much.
"Trying really hard to be social
in big dorm activities where no one
really cares except the people mak
ing noise at the center is really
hard," she said. "When I'm de
pressed, it's better for me just to
hide, but people perceive that as
being 'mean."'
Allen, who said her own fresh
man RA was instrumental in get
ting her help freshman year, said
she thought the type of students in
most RA positions can contribute to
the problem.
"RAs who go in with the idea of
being motivators for enthusiastic
socialization and party planning
are absolutely unhelpful," she said.
"The ones who help act more like
peer counselors and talk to stu
dents as individuals instead of hav
ing superficial constant conversa
tions about nothing."
R.L., a senior who said he pre

ferred to be named by his initials,
said he was alienated by the RAs he
came into contact with. He attribut
es this alienation in part to his de
pression at Stanford.
"The people who Stanford
chooses to bring into the spotlight
are those who are gung-ho and
think Stanford's great and there are
no problems here," R.L. said. "This
is harmful to students because no
place is perfect and to be constantly
having that out there messes widi
your mind and denies reality."
R.L. identifies himself as Chi
cano and gay and said that while
he already felt marginalized for
being a minority, the Res Ed pro
grams never provided him with
the sort of pluralistic community it
claims as its goal. He said Res Ed's
goals are venerable, but they are
not met.
"I've never been to a Res Ed
program that's helped me know
how to act and feel," R.L. said.
"Most of them alienate me because
I don't feel how the University says
I should."
Jane Camarillo, director of the
Res Ed program said die goal of
residential programming is not to
reach everyone, but to provide stu
dents with a support network and
an open community where not at
tending dorm activities is just as ac
cepted as participating in them.
"Students should be able to
choose how they engage in the Res
idential Education program but
know that they are supported in
what they choose," she said. "The
enthusiasm that staff have for de
veloping an identity with the house
may be activities with which any in
dividual student can struggle if it is
not an immediate fit for them. But
our goal is to validate the perspec
tives of all our students."
Camarillo also said that in a re
cent residence evaluation, a major
ity of students reported feeling per
sonal support from a dorm staff
member.
Senior Maria Reese has been
an RAin an all-freshman dorm
and is currently an RAin Grana
da, a four-class dorm. She said she
has felt the pressure to appear
happy and understands student
concerns. She said she believes
RAs and the Res Ed program re
ally strive to connect with all stu
dents, even if some might feel
alienated by this effort.

"As an RA, yon want people to
get to know each other ancl some
times the only way to do that is by
being persistent—the pressure
isn't intentioned," Reese said.
Reese said that though half a
day of RA training was devoted to
dealing with depression in dorms,
she thought more time could be
spent on the topic. She also said de
pression could be more widely dis
cussed within dorms.
An untaken avenue of help
Though for many the reality has
set in and students are increasingly
seeking help through CAPS, many
are unaware of other resources
available at Stanford for help with
depression.
One new tool in dealing with
student depression today that was
not available in the past is disability
resource centers that can help stu
dents coping with depression.
Joan Bisagno, the director of

Stanford's Disability Resource Cen
ter, said she believes many students
with psychiatric disabilities at Stan
ford are unaware that under the
1990 Americans with Disabilities
Act, they are equally entitled to aid
from the center as those with phys
ical disabilities. According to Bisag
no, students with persistent, life-al
tering psychiatric disabilities make
up 35 percent of students the cen
ter works with, the largest percent
age of those receiving assistance
from the center.
"It's a major misconception that
psychological disabilities aren't
covered here," she said. "The word
disability in people's minds con
jures up physical problems, but
psychological disabilities are dis
abilities too just like lupus, kidney
disease, cancer, or any other chron
ic disability."
Bisagno pointed out that while
many students are aware that the
center can provide aid in housing
issues, they might not know the
center can also provide a variety
of other services to students suf
fering with depression. Such ser
vices include working with ad
ministrators and a student's pro
fessors to lower the number of
units a student is required to take
in a particular quarter or school
year and providing note-takers or
tape-recorded books for students
taking medication that alters their
level of concentration.
Kristin said she was reluctant to
seek help from the center until her
therapist encouraged her to do so.
"The hardest thing was to ask
for exceptions with schoolwork
from the DRC," she said. "I'm
thinking 'I just don't deserve this.' I
thought I did something to bring
this on and I felt guilty having
someone come in and clean up the
mess I made. I'm realizing now
that it's not my fault and it's OK to
ask for help."
When it's not OK to get help
Perhaps the feeling that it is not
acceptable to seek help is emblem
atic of the problem of depression at
Stanford.
Despite the higher number of
visits at CAPS, Martinez said he
knew many students with depres
sion still did not seek help. He said
according to a recent CLAI'S survey,
30 percent of Stanford students

said they would never seek the help
of a counselor or therapist even if
they had a personal problem both
ering them. Martinez said he be
lieved this was due to a remaining
stigma about depression, and said
the newer students are to Stanford,
the less likely they are to seek help.
Students like Sarah who dealt
with depression at Stanford
stressed the need to erase precon
ceptions by promoting awareness
of the problem.
"There are no easy answers, but
there needs to be some direct ac
tion taken to combat this problem,"
she said. "The school should have a
depression awareness week or
something like that. Even if no one
attended, the very existence would
be an indicator that this thing exists
and it exists on this campus."
Martinez said that students and
faculty need to better understand
the problem in order to combat it.
"The structure Stanford has set
in place is exemplary in providing
support to students, but that
doesn't mean that everyone under
stands depression," he said. "For
this reason it is valuable for the
Stanford community to know what
depression is and understand the
myths around it."
Kristin said she does not attend
the Bridge's support group because
of a stigma she felt at Stanford.
"If you let people on this cam
pus see you as depressed, it's just
really not a cool label to have,"
Kristin said. "It's hard to take ad
vantage of groups here because
you just know there's such a stigma
if you even show up."
Allen said despite the stigma
that might prevent students from
coming to the Wellness and De
pression Group, she and Lock
speiser intend to keep the group
going. They are looking for alter
native ways to reach people and
lower any remaining stigma at
tached to attending meetings.
"Sometimes I get discouraged
and I think maybe we shouldn't
have the group at all," she said. "I
know that's not true, though. I
strongly believe that it can help peo
ple. I know this will work. It's hard
for people at Stanford to accept that
depression is an emotional disorder
and it's'real and it's debilitating. Re
alism kills people, but you have to
be real to a certain degree."

Counseling and Psychological Services, located on the second floor of Cow
ell Student Health Center, offers help to students with depression. But some
students complain that they don't get enough attention there.
