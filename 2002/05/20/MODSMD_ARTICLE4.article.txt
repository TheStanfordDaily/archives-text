# Tennis beats Florida for national championship

### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
No respect? Not anymore.
Ever since a loss to No. 3 Georgia (26-2) on
Feb. 9 dropped it from the top spot in the
rankings, the No. 2 Stanford women's tennis
team (27-1) has been determined to prove
who the best team in the country really was.
Last night at the Taube Tennis Center, the
Cardinal did just that, defeating top-ranked
Florida (24-2), 4-1, to claim its second
straight NCAA Championship.
"To end it on the home courts, in front of
people who have been supporting us for four
years, is an incredible feeling," senior Lauren
Kalvaria said.
After freshman Eriij Burdette's backhand
winner skipped past Alexis Gordon, the Car
dinal players piled on top of each other in the
middle of the court in celebration. Once they
disentangled themselves, they all donned T
sliirts that read "Stanford 2002 NCAA
Champions" on the front and "No Respect"
on the back.
"We were ranked as low as sixth, and
that's ridiculous," Kalvaria said.
The Cardinal is number one now, though.
"All the hard work this season has paid
off," Burdette said.
Stanford accomplished its goal, and now
the team can sit back and relish what it has ac
complished.
"It was an unbelievable season," head

coach Lele Forood said. "Our team really
worked hard."
The championship match was no excep
tion, lasting four hours after rain delayed the
start for three hours. From the beginning,
Florida made it clear that it was not going to
go quiedy.
In doubles, Florida's Alexis Gordon and
Julia Scaringe knocked off Stanford's No. 14
duo of sophomore Lauren Barnikow and
freshman Erin Burdette in the second flight.
Senior Keiko Tokuda and freshman Story
Tweedie-Yates out-hustled Annika Bengts
son and Zerene Reyes, winning 8-4 in the
third flight. Senior Gabriela Lastra and
Kalvaria, the nation's top-ranked doubles
team, outlasted No. 3 Lindsey Dawaf and
Jessica Lehnhoff, winning 8-6 in a hard-hit
ting first-flight match marked by repeated
service breaks.
The Cardinal erupted in cheers and con
gratulations, and headed into the break be
tween the doubles matches and the singles
matches in high spirits.
"It's just a huge momentum thing,"
Forood said. "It sure feels good when you go
into singles knowing you only have to split
them."
Despite the tall order facing them — win
ning four of six singles matches against the
nation's best singles lineup — the Florida
players did not back down.
