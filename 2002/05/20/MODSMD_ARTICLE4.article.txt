# Tennis beats Florida for national championship
## 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
No respect? Not anymore.
Ever since a loss to No. 3 Georgia (26-2) on
Feb. 9 dropped it from the top spot in the
rankings, the No. 2 Stanford women's tennis
team (27-1) has been determined to prove
who the best team in the country really was.
Last night at the Taube Tennis Center, the
Cardinal did just that, defeating top-ranked
Florida (24-2), 4-1, to claim its second
straight NCAA Championship.
"To end it on the home courts, in front of
people who have been supporting us for four
years, is an incredible feeling," senior Lauren
Kalvaria said.
After freshman Eriij Burdette's backhand
winner skipped past Alexis Gordon, the Car
dinal players piled on top of each other in the
middle of the court in celebration. Once they
disentangled themselves, they all donned T
sliirts that read "Stanford 2002 NCAA
Champions" on the front and "No Respect"
on the back.
"We were ranked as low as sixth, and
that's ridiculous," Kalvaria said.
The Cardinal is number one now, though.
"All the hard work this season has paid
off," Burdette said.
Stanford accomplished its goal, and now
the team can sit back and relish what it has ac
complished.
"It was an unbelievable season," head

coach Lele Forood said. "Our team really
worked hard."
The championship match was no excep
tion, lasting four hours after rain delayed the
start for three hours. From the beginning,
Florida made it clear that it was not going to
go quiedy.
In doubles, Florida's Alexis Gordon and
Julia Scaringe knocked off Stanford's No. 14
duo of sophomore Lauren Barnikow and
freshman Erin Burdette in the second flight.
Senior Keiko Tokuda and freshman Story
Tweedie-Yates out-hustled Annika Bengts
son and Zerene Reyes, winning 8-4 in the
third flight. Senior Gabriela Lastra and
Kalvaria, the nation's top-ranked doubles
team, outlasted No. 3 Lindsey Dawaf and
Jessica Lehnhoff, winning 8-6 in a hard-hit
ting first-flight match marked by repeated
service breaks.
The Cardinal erupted in cheers and con
gratulations, and headed into the break be
tween the doubles matches and the singles
matches in high spirits.
"It's just a huge momentum thing,"
Forood said. "It sure feels good when you go
into singles knowing you only have to split
them."
Despite the tall order facing them — win
ning four of six singles matches against the
nation's best singles lineup — the Florida
players did not back down.

Seniors Keiko Tokuda, Lauren Kalvaria and Gabriela Lastra celebrate the
women's tennis team's victory over Florida to win the national championship.
The team's only loss this year was to Georgia. »
Florida's Reyes, a 4-foot-10
left-handed freshman ranked
No. 53 nationally in singles, knot
ted the score at 1-1 by upsetting
No. 16 Barnikow, 6-0, 6-2, in the
third llight.
The next two matches to finish,
though, were Stanford victories,
putting the pressure on Florida.
Tokuda ended her collegiate career
on a 23-match winning streak, tak
ing out Bengtsson, 6-3, 6-1, in the
fifth flight. Sophomore Emilia An
derson followed with a 6-3, 6-4 win
over Scaringe in No. 6 singles.
No. 13 Burdette then followed
with her 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 tide-clinching
victory over No. 118 Gordon.
Kalvaria's and Lastra's matches
were then abandoned.
No. 4 Kalvaria was down, 2-6, 6-
0, 4-2, to top-ranked Lehnhoff in a
showdown between two powerful
baseline hitters, and No. 6 Lastra
had gained a 6-2, 5-7, 4-1 advan
tage against No. 18 Lindsey Dawaf
due to her relentless volleying.
Stanford accomplished its final
goal of the season with its victory

over Florida. On Saturday, though,
the team accomplished another im
portant goal — getting back at
Georgia.
Stanford, by winning 4-0, was
avenging its February loss and its
defeat to the Bulldogs in the 2000
championship match.
"It was very sweet to be able to
play them on our home courts and
beat them one last time," Lastra
said. "We wanted to get back at
Cieorgia so badly."
In doubles, Kalvaria and Lastra
clinched their match without any re
sistance, dispatching No. 15 Agadia
Cioroch and Lori Grey, 8-1, after
which Tokuda and Tweedie-Yates
checked in with an 8-4 victory over
Anne Nguyen and Alexandra
Smith. Barnikow and Burdette were
up, 7-6, on No. 33 Tina Hqjnik and
Mariel Verban, who had no answer
for the Cardinal's strong net play.
Singles were even breezier, as
the Bulldogs were still shocked
from doubles.
"I think we just came on so
strong that they were shell
shocked," Lastra said. "They were
kind of like, 'Oh my God, what
happened?'"
Tokuda was first to finish, with a
6-1,6-0 triumph over Hojnik. Bur

dette followed with a 6-3, 6-4 win
over Grey, and Lastra clinched the
match by putting away No. 37 Ver
ban, 6-3,6-4.
Kalvaria was down, 4-6, 1-4, to
No. 7 Cioroch, at that time, and
Barnikow trailed Nguyen, 2-6, 4-
5. Anderson had a 6-2, 2-1 edge
on Smith.
As soon as Lastra clinched her
match, Kalvaria left her point in
progress, running over to hug Las
tra. The rest of the team soon joined
in the celebration of the Cardinal's
16th trip to the championship
match in 21 years.
"We weren't successful in that
match in February, so we had a lot
to play for," Forood said.
Stanford advanced to the cham
pionships by defeating Sacramento
State (20-4), 4-0, and No. 36 Pepper
dine (13-14), 4-0, in regional play.
On Thursday, Kalvaria and Las
tra, as well as Tokuda and Tweedie-
Yates lost in doubles, before the
team came back to defeat No. 17
Kentucky (18-9), 5-1 .
On Friday against No. 7 North
Carolina (25-5), the Cardinal en
dured another doubles scare, as all
three doubles teams fell behind, 3-0.
Tokuda and Tweedie-Yates fell,
8-6, to Lee Bairos and Kate Pinch

beck, and the other two matches
went down to the wire. Fortunately
for the Cardinal, Barnikow and Bur
dette fought their way to a 9-8 win
over No. 47 Kendall Cline and Aniela
Moj/is, while Kalvaria and Uistra
came back from a 6-2 deficit to edge
Marlene Mejia and Julie Rotondi, 9-
8, in an aggressively-played battle.
In singles, Anderson overpow
ered Cline, 6-1, (5-2, before
Barnikow fell, 6-0, 6-3, to the hy
perkinetic Rotondi. Tokuda took
care of Bairos, 6-4,6-1, though, and
followed with a 6-3, 6-3 win
over No. 14 Pinchbeck.
Kalvaria was up, 6-2,3-3, on No.
36 Mejia when the match ended,
while Burdette had a 6-4, 4-1 ad
vantage over Moj/is.
Kalvaria, Lastra, Barnikow and
Burdette will all represent the Car
dinal in both the singles and dou
bles draws of the NCAA Individual
Championships, which begin today
and are also hosted by Stanford.
However, any individual accom
plishments for the Stanford players
are just icing on the cake. The team
is the NCAA champion, and that's
all that really matters.
"To win it at home, your senior
year? It doesn't get any better than
that," Lastra said.
