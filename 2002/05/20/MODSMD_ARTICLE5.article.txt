nal, will join a group of three interna
tional experts fora lecture and sympo
sium on "Global News C-overage" today
at Kresge Auditorium.

The event is the Communication
Dept. and the Knight Fellowship Pro
gram.
"We are holding this .. . because we
think that international news coverage
has become ever more important in the
eight months since Sept. 11," said Com
munication Prof. James Bettinger, di
rector of the Knight Fellowship Pro
gram. "We wanted to bring some out
standing journalists and thinkers to
Stanford to talk about that."

The event will begin with a lecture by
Steiger, followed by a panel discussion
in which participants will respond to his
remarks.
"Paul Steiger is an outstanding jour
nalist, and his news organization, the
Wall Street Journal, suffered greatly
from the attacks," Bettinger said. "Its of
fices were across the street from the
World Trade Center, and the newspa
per had to quickly re-deploy its re
porters and editors in order to continue

publishing."
Steiger has been managing editor of
the Wall Street Journal since 1991. In
that time, the newspaper has won 10
Pulitzer Prizes, including one this year
for breaking news. This year, Steiger
was selected the first recipient of the
American Society of Newspaper Edi
tors' Leadership Award.
