# Journalists to discuss post-Sept. 11 coverage today
## Wall Street Journal editor and other writers involved 
### RIZWAN SABAR 
Paul Steiger, managing editor and
vice president of the Wall Street Jour
nal, will join a group of three interna
tional experts fora lecture and sympo
sium on "Global News C-overage" today
at Kresge Auditorium.

The event is the Communication
Dept. and the Knight Fellowship Pro
gram.
"We are holding this .. . because we
think that international news coverage
has become ever more important in the
eight months since Sept. 11," said Com
munication Prof. James Bettinger, di
rector of the Knight Fellowship Pro
gram. "We wanted to bring some out
standing journalists and thinkers to
Stanford to talk about that."

The event will begin with a lecture by
Steiger, followed by a panel discussion
in which participants will respond to his
remarks.
"Paul Steiger is an outstanding jour
nalist, and his news organization, the
Wall Street Journal, suffered greatly
from the attacks," Bettinger said. "Its of
fices were across the street from the
World Trade Center, and the newspa
per had to quickly re-deploy its re
porters and editors in order to continue

publishing."
Steiger has been managing editor of
the Wall Street Journal since 1991. In
that time, the newspaper has won 10
Pulitzer Prizes, including one this year
for breaking news. This year, Steiger
was selected the first recipient of the
American Society of Newspaper Edi
tors' Leadership Award.
Joining Steiger for the panel discus-
sion following his lecture will be
Maud Beelman, director of the In
ternational Consortium of Inves
tigative Journalists; Merrill Brown,
editor-in-chief of MSNBC.com;
and Gloria Duffy, chief executive
officer of the Commonwealth Club
of California and a former Defense
Department official.
Bettinger noted that interna
tional news coverage had
dropped in U.S. news coverage
before Sept. 11.
"We want to examine why that
happened, and whether it con
tributed to a feeling of compla
cency on the part of U.S. citizens,"
Bettinger said. "We hope that
people take away a more sophisti
cated sense of the complexity of
international journalism, includ
ing where U.S. news organiza
tions are falling short."
The event will be held today in
Kresge Auditorium. Steiger's lec
ture will begin at 4:30 p.m. and will
be followed at 6 p.m. by the panel
discussion. There will be an inter
mission and refreshments be
tween the two parts of the pro
gram. The event is free and open
to the public.
