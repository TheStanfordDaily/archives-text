the 20th century."

Camarillo will begin to imple
ment this vision ill the next few
months by working with students in
Los Angeles.
"This summer, I will initiate a
new service / learning /research
project involving undergraduates
in Los Angeles that I hope will serve

sider combining service-learning
curriculum into their research pro
jects," he said. "Students from the

programs in Comparative Studies
in Race and Ethnicity and Urban
Studies will participate in year-long
projects under my direction."

individual at Stanford, Camarillo
has made service learning a fa
miliar term and a part of teaching
innovation among Stanford fac
ulty," she said. "A1 has provided
sustained leadership to connect
faculty to public service educa
tion, not only or mostly by words,

but through example."
