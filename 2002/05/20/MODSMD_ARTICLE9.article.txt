Developer seeks permis
sion for new SF skyscraper
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —The skyline of the city by
the bay could change if a New York developer wins ap
proval
fora 58-story skyscraper.
The'6os-foot tower would be San Francisco's fourth
tallest, behind the Transamerica Pyramid, which mea
sures 853 feet tall, the Bank of America building at 778 feet
and the California Center at 093 feet.
The new building would include 163 condominiums,
108 rentals and a 130-unit, extended-stay hotel.
About 10 percent of the building would house offices.
The building would exceed the maximum allowable
height by 55 feet and would need special approval.
The city has told Millennium Partners that an environ
mental impact report must be completed before (he build
ing can be approved.

State looks into technology
to protect buildings from
large earthquakes
PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — California is considering
funding research into an earthquake early warning system
that would "stiffen" buildings seconds before violent
quakes strike.
Scientists are looking at fitting individual buildings with
instruments that would analyze an earthquake's relatively
weak primary waves within three seconds.
The system would then prepare the building by adjust
ing dampers designed to cushion the shock and by initiat
ing magnetic systems — still to be developed — that
would protect the building.
It would also shut down utility lines and sound a
warning.
Hiroo Kanamori, one of the country's top earthquake
authorities and a member of an international papel of sci
entists studying the idea, sketched out the proposed sys
tem Friday to dozens of state disaster officials at a session
of the Caltech Earthquake Research Affiliates.
Jim Goltz, an official with the state Office of Emergency
Services, told the group that California might fund a pilot
project to test the system in a high-rise building.
But while there's public support for the idea, the state is
concerned it could face liability lawsuits if things went
wrong, or if some buildings were protected and others
were not, Goltz said.
