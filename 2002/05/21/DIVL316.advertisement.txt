Fred Luskin is a practicing
psychologist and cofounder of the
Stanford University Forgiveness
Project and in his new book
he explores why forgiveness is
important for mental and physical
health. Results from Dr. Fred Luskin's
Stanford University Forgiveness
Project, one of the largest and most
important studies on forgiveness ever
conducted, show that learning how
to forgive improves our emotional
and physical well-being.
