Police bust Sacramento
drug ring
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Sacramento sheriffs investigators
arrested 20 people and seized 100 pounds of cocaine — the
largest drug bust in the department's history, officials said.
"This was a major distribution ring ... we have absolute
ly broken the back of this organization," said Sgt. James
Lewis, sheriffs spokesman.
The drug ring was run out of a transmission repair shop
in West Sacramento, Lewis said.
The arrests on Thursday were triggered when law en
forcement authorities in San Antonio, Texas, pulled over a
car connected to the Sacramento transmission shop, Lewis
said.
San Antonio officers found the dings in a custom-made steel
box wedged between the back seat and the trunk of the car.
Four people in the car, which officials believe was headed
from Mexico to Sacramento, were arrested, Lewis said.
Warrants were served at nine Sacramento-area locations,
resulting in the arrest of 16 additional suspects. Most were
arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and
methamphetamine.
Also seized were 1 1/2 pounds of methamphetamine and
more than $200,000 in cash. Lewis estimated the street value
of the drugs at about $5 million.
Suspects connected to the transmission shop ring remain
at large, Lewis said, and more arrests are expected soon.

Auburn settles with fraternity
Auburn University has settled a lawsuit brought by a fra

last October.
Although Auburn officials declined to comment on the
settlement's terms, the Associated Press reported that the
university was allowing the fraternity to return to the
campus.
The university suspended 10 Beta Theta Pi members
from the institution* and revoked the fraternity's charter
after members were photographed wearing Afro wigs and
blackface at the party.
The photographs were then posted on several Web sites.
A judge later ordered that the students be reinstated.
