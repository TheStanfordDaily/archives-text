1929
On May 21,1929, The Daily printed an ar
ticle about crew at Stanford.
"Today is the day that the Stanford student
body will have .its chance to say whether it is
desirous of reinstating the most colorful ol
college sports — crew.
"Fourteen years ago at this time a Cardinal
crew practiced daily on the old Redwood
Creek seven miles from here, preparing to
meet the best that the East had to offer. They
had already conquered the University of Cal
ifornia and Washington and hope ran high
on the campus with the possibility of an East
ern victory and international fame.
"Not many weeks later this same eight trav
elled to Poughkeepsie and placed a second in
the regatta there after trailing the field at the
halfway mark.
"After that, due to a great extent to the war,
rowing dwindled in popularity. Finances
were also instrumental in its downfall, mainly
because there was not so great a revenue com
ing in from other sports, and for that reason
no way to support it. But now that Stanford
has no legitimate excuses to offer — for as the
Daily's crew questionnaire showed, what were
difficulties a few years ago are not any longer
as they may now be overcome without a great
degree of effort. ..
"As an interesting sidelight on the situa
tion, May 7 the Daily printed a list of equip
ment necessary for reestablishing crew here.
Since that time there has been a great deal of
discussion as to the reliability of the figures
quoted as the cost of this equipment.
"The figures in question were:
• Barge — priced at.. ..$ 1100
• Two shells at $ 1250 each ... .2500
• Fifty new oars at $20 each .... 1000
• Coaches' launch priced at.. . .2500
"In order that all doubt as to their authen
ticity might be removed the list was mailed to
George Pocock and Company, builders of the
racing shells used by the universities in this
country, for verification."
Bottom line:Vespoli smites Pocock, and was quoted
as saying, "I don't believe in oppression, I believe in
empire and domination."
