# Bush criticizes Cuban regime

### 
MIAMI (AP) — Denouncing Fidel Castro
as a brutal dictator, Pres. George W. Bush
said yesterday lie won't budge toward easing
restrictions on trade and travel with Cuba
until its communist regime allows free and
fair elections and begins to adopt meaningful
economic reform.
"Start to release your chokehold on the
working people and on enterprise," Bush de
manded in a liery speech. "Then, and only
then, will we talk about easing sanctions, and
not before."
Bush outlined an "Initiative fora new
Cuba" and set out a list of tough conditions
for lifting the 40-year U.S. trade embargo,
first at the White House and then in a speech
here before a raucous gathering dominated
by Cuban-American supporters.
There was a strong atmosphere of political
maneuvering — the president was intro
duced by his brother, Gov. jeb Bush, who is
seeking re-election in November.
Bush's speech was clearly aimed at giving
his brother maximum support from Cubari-
American voters in what could be a closely
contested election; the Florida vote in the
2000 presidential elections was virtually a
dead heat.
Thousands of Cuban-Americans roared
approval at Bush's remarks, interrupting
him again and again with standing ovations
and cries of "Libertad! Libertad!" and "Cuba,
si, Castro, non!"
Bush shouted back, "Viva Cuba libre!"
Bush's speech represented his administra
tion's most comprehensive Cuba policy state
ment to date.
"If Cuba's government takes all necessary

steps to ensure that the 2003 elections are
certifiably free and fair, and if Cuba begins to
adopt meaningful market-based reforms,
then, and only then, will I work with the
United States Congress to ease the ban on
trade and travel between the two countries,"
Bush said.
At present, trade with Cuba is restrict
ed for the most part to U.S. sales of med
ical-related goods and the cash-only sale
of food.
Americans who wish to travel legally to
Cuba generally must receive a license from
the Treasury Department. Those with a pro
fessional interest in Cuba or with family ties
on the island are eligible for licenses. Tourism
by Americans is forbidden.
Democrats on Capitol Hill generally
expressed disappointment with Bush's
statements.
Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., a member of a
group of House members opposed to cur
rent U.S. Cuba policy, said the embargo has
been applied "with absolutely no success.
After 40 years of failure, we need to recognize
that this approach is clearly not working and
try something new."
In Cuba, some leading dissidents did not
approve of Bush's hard-line stand.
"Changes have to be made but changes
have to be made on both sides," said
Vladimiro Roca, who was released from
prison in Cuba earlier this month.
Bush said the embargo was not an end in
itself. "The goal of the United States policy to
ward Cuba is not a permanent embargo on
Cuba's economy. The goal is freedom for
Cuba's people."
