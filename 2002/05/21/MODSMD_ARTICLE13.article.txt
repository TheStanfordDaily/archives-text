### 
HOUS TON (AP) —Jurors in Arthur Andersen
LLP's obstruction trial watched a video yesterday in
which audit team managers were told destroying
documents before litigation is filed is "great" because
"whatever might have l)een of interest to anybody is
gone and irretrievable."
Michael Odom, a practice njanager and partner in
Andersen's Houston office, made the remarks Oct. 10
while instructing audit team managers to follow the
Chicago-based firm's document retention policy.
The accounting firm is charged with obstruction
of justice for destroying records related to Enron
Corp. audits last year as the Securities and Ex
change Commission started probing the energy
company's finances.
The video was among evidence presented by pros
ecutors to demonstrate Odom and Nancy Temple,
an in-house Andersen lawyer who has invoked her
Fifth Amendment light not to testify, urged compli
ance with the policy as the Enron scandal loomed.
David B. Duncan, Andersen's former top Enron
auditor, heard Odom's presentation. He testified last

week he didn't walk away thinking he had to destroy
Enron documents.
Odom, who has not testified, told the audit man
agers group Oct. 10 that Andersen recently had pro
duced documents for pending litigation and "we
found a lot of stuff that we shouldn't have retained"
because it included drafts and memos not included in
final audit papers.
Odom said once litigation is filed, the firm can't de
stroy anything. But if workers destroy records in
compliance with the policy up until the day before lit
igation is filed, "that's great," he said.
On Oct. 12, Temple sent Odom the reminder of
the document retention policy: "It will be helpful to
make sure that we have complied with the policy."
Odom sent it to Duncan, who told his staff Oct. 23
to comply.
Minutes later on Oct. 12, records introduced
Monday showed Temple created a written record of
a litigation claim about the Enron account, though
the SEC didn't notify Enron of its informal inquiry
until five days later.
