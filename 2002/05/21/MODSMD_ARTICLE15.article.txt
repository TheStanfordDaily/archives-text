MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) — Liberia rejected a
cease-fire appeal by fellow West African nations yes
terday and ordered its forces to look fora British
priest and 60 blind Liberian civilians missing in the
battle-engulfed north.
"All we can do . . . is pray for their safety," Roman
Catholic Bishop Michael Francis said in Monrovia,
Liberia's capital.
The Rev. Garry Jenkins last was seen May 13,
where he was trying to shepherd dozens of blind
Liberians on the run in a region newly overrun by
rebel and government combatants.
West African leaders had called over the week
end fora cease-fire in surging fighting between
forces of Liberian President Charles Taylor and the
militias waging a 3-year-old campaign to over
throw him.
Representatives of seven nations, including re
gional power Nigeria, urged all sides to open inter
nationally mediated talks.
Liberia Information Minister Reginald
Goodridge yesterday expressed resentment at the
appeal.
"It is the policy of most democratic governments
in the world not to negotiate with terrorists,"
Goodridge said.
Liberia had asked West African nations to send in

their regional peacekeeping force, dominated by
Nigeria.
Senegal President Abdoulaye Wade rebuffed the
appeal, saying West African nations didn't immedi
•ately have the resources.
It might already be "too late" for Taylor's govern
ment, given the apparent size of the rebel threat,
Wade said in Ivory Coast, where West African lead
ers' summit took place.
The rebuff indicated the concern with which West
African nations view Taylor's troubles — and an un
willingness among many to come to the support of a
leader isolated by the W r est.
Taylor is under a U.N. arms embargo and other
sanctions for what the United Nations says is contin
ued gun-running with rebels in neighboring Sierra
Leone and elsewhere.
A 1989-96 civil war killed 200,000 in Liberia,
which was founded in the mid- 19th century by freed
American slaves.
Taylor, who started the war and won the presi
dency immediately after it, has been targeted by an
insurrection allegedly waged by losing factions in the
war and backed by Guinea.
Anti-Taylor forces this month waged their most
concerted campaign of the insurrection, fighting to
within a few minutes' drive of the capital.
