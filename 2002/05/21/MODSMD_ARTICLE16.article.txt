## The
						Stanford Daily Catholic Church must effectively address abuse 
### 
Published Since JB9l

The recent allegations of an orga
nized cover-up of sexual abuse by
Catholic priests in some U.S. dioce
ses is distressing. We are pleased
that the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic
church has finally begun to take responsibili
ty for the action of its priests, but we remain
concerned that proper measures have not
been taken against those within the hierarchy
who sought to cover up allegations of abuse.
Bernard Law, the archbishop of Boston,
has come under fire recently for transferring
priests who had allegedly abused children
from parish to parish. He has blamed this on,
among other things, an inadequate filing sys
tem. We feel Law should admit he erred seri
ously, and, as the leader of the archdiocese,
take full responsibility for his actions.

While crimes are frequently compensated
for by financial settlements in this country,
we believe that more is necessary when the
severity of sexual abuse is examined. Law
should sufficiently and directly apologize to
the victims of abuse and to the victims of his
attempts to cover up the crimes.
The case of Edward Egan, the archbishop of
New York, is less clear than that of Law. Egan is
alleged to have covered up sexual abuse on the
part of priests when he was the bishop of
Bridgeport, Conn. We are not certain whether
Egan's actions in this past job affect his ability to
effectively discharge his duties as archbishop of
New York, should a similar situation arise. We
do believe, however, that he should publicly
apologize to victims of sexual abuse within the
dioceses in which he has worked.

W T hile the nation has struggled to deal with
this problem, the Catholic Community at
Stanford has responded particularly effective
ly. The community has organized group meet
ings for undergraduates, graduate students
and young adults, and a meeting for members
of the permanent community is in the works.
We applaud the way in which this difficult
issue has been handled by the priests and lay
people who serve the Stanford community.
We also applaud the Rev. Patrick La Belle
for his forthright approach to the issue. Dur
ing the height of the controversy, Laßelle
wrote a guest column sympathizing with the
victims and explaining his vision for the heal
ing process that the Church must undergo.
Laßelle admitted in his coltunn that the
organizational hierarchy of the Church had

failed to redress the problem of sexual abuse,
and that the reaction of the Church to these
victims is the more deliberate — and there
fore more hurtful — sin.
The urge which drives some to molest chil
dren is a disease. We understand that, sadly,
there will be some pedophile priests. But what is
truly deplorable is the Church's handling of the
problem. Until recently, it has, in effect, pre
tended the problem doesn't exist. The respon
sibility of the Church is to ensure that those who
molest children are not put in positions in which
they can hurt more in the future, and that vic
tims and their families understand the regret of
the Church and its leaders for these actions.
We hope that in the future, the Church
will act more responsibly and forthrightly in
its handling of cases of sexual abuse.
