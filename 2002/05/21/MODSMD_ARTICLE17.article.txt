# SHOOTING FROM THE HIP
## Dealing with doubt: voting rights for teens 
### 
Call me a dewy-eyed, namby
pamby, „ bleeding-heart liberal,
but I really believe that old say
ing "It's better to let 10 guilty
men go free than put one innocent man in
prison." There are exceptions, of course.
If the 10 guilty men are homicidal maniacs
who have killed before and will kill again,
I might reconsider. But in general, I'd
rather give 10 people liberty that they
don't deserve, rather than deny one per
son a liberty that he does deserve.
That's the funny thing about liber
ties, rights and freedoms — you have to
err on the side of caution. Prosecutors

have to show guilt "be
yond an reasonable
doubt" in order to put
someone in jail. The
state has to show "clear
and present danger" to
society before it can re
strict political speech.
Our entire political sys
tem is built on the idea

that rights aren't absolute, but you'd
better have an ironclad, take-it-to-lhe
bank rationale before you can even
think of restricting them.
In this light, denying voting rights to
all citizens under 18 years of age is com
pletely indefensible. Alter all, the core
reason why we deny suffrage to minors is
because it's presumed that they don't
have (he knowledge and maturity to vote
responsibly. And to be sure, most of
them don't. But even the most paternal
istic statesman has to admit there are
some 16- and 17-year-olds who could
vote intelligently. In fact, there are cer
tainly a significant number who meet this
threshold. In other words, for any given
teenager, there's a reasonable doubt re
garding the assumption that he or she
can't vote intelligently. And just like the
example of criminal defendants, where
there exists reasonable doubt, you can't
go about denying rights.
To use the free-speech analogy, no
one could claim that allowing teenagers
to vote would pose a "clear and present
danger" to society. Perhaps teenage suf
frage would result in slightly less compe
tent elected officials. Maybe you'd see
Congressmen bowing to the powerful
nose-piercing and Backstreet Boys lob
bies. But somehow I doubt our govern
ment will dissolve into chaos just because
teenagers can cast ballots.
These arguments don't imply that we
should give the vote to all minors. I "here's
reasonable doubt regarding the assumption
that a 16-year-old isn't competent to vote,
but when you shift your focus to younger
and younger citizens, you can stand oti
firmer ground. leaving aside those obnox
ious child pnxligies that make the evening
news, I'm reasonably sure that any given 11-
year-old doesn't have the ability to vote in
telligently. Once you get down to age eigfit

or nine, there's barely a shadow of a doubt.
So, by applying the "reasonable doubt"
standard, it's probably fair to extend the
vote to all teenagers and go no farther.
It's important to realize that giving
teenagers the vote does not mean that all
teenagers will actually exercise this right.
Your average teen is a pretty busy char
acter. He or she must balance mall shop
ping, MTV, driving lessons, telephone
gossip, hair maintenance, generalized
angst, fast food and awkward sex. In
light of all these demands on their time
and energy, the only teenagers who will
go to the trouble of voting will be those
who actually care about the process.
These individuals would be much more
competent and politically astute than
their non-voting peers. The addition of
these uncommonly intelligent and moti
vated teens to our national electorate in
unlikely to spell national disaster.
Critics might argue that, competence
issues aside, teenagers aren't free agents.
In other words, their parents could exert
undue influence on their voting deci
sions. A quick glance at history makes
this argument extremely suspect. It was
the same argument used to deny suf
frage to non-landowners, servants and
women, among others.
But more importantly, these critics
obviously don't have teenagers of their
own, and have apparently forgotten
their own teenage years. Teenagers may
respect, ignore, or despise their parents,
but no teen appreciates being ordered
around by them. For the last two years
my parents have been fighting a losing
battle just to get my teenage brother to
shave once in a while. How could they
expect to tell him who to vote for?
At best, parents might be able to guide
their kids' vote choice through some re
ally slick reverse psychology. If a pair of
Republican parents starting gushing
about Al Gore every night at the dinner
table, Junior might get so disgusted that
he'd vote for George Rush out of sheer
spite. But to pull off this trick you'd need
extremely devious parents and an ex
tremely naive teenager. For obvious rea
sons, this is a combination that doesn't
occur very often.
The classic old-person complaint is
that kids these days lack respect and a
sense of responsibility. By giving
teenagers a stake in our political process,
perhaps they would gain these qualities a
little faster.
Kxpanding suffrage to teenagers
would also be in keeping with our
bedrock principle that tights shouldn't
be taken away without just cause. In
short, teenage suffrage is a winning
proposition for everyone involved.
