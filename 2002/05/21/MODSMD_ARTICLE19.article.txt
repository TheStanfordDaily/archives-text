Egg donor ad should have disclaimer
The Daily has once again run an ad of
fering .$BO,OOO for an egg donor (May
17). I here are many ethical issues con
cerning the sale of body parts, such as
"designer babies" and the subtle yet co
ercive effect of offering substantial
amounts of money to someone in need, a
powerful temptation for any student
whose family is burdened by the high
costs of a Stanford education.
But even if such issues are ignored
under rubrics of free speech, The Daily
needs to set out clear guidelines for such
ads and refuse to print them if they do
not adhere to those guidelines. This par
ticular ad (as well as all the others) does
not explicitly state that there are signifi
cant health risks involved in young
women undergoing the procedure for
donating eggs. Not too long ago a Stan
ford graduate student who underwent
the procedure suffered serious side-ef
fects and was permanently disabled. I am
basing my information on the research
of Amber Johnson '01 with whom 1
worked on the completion of her
Human Biology honors thesis "Kgg
Donor Recruitment at Stanford."
Given the risk involved, The Daily
should insist that all egg donor ads
prominently display a disclaimer, such
as, "Donating eggs may involve serious
health risks to donor." If the ad does not
contain a disclaimer, The Daily should
refuse to print it. 1 his is not an abridge
ment of free speech but a necessary ex
ercise of a newspaper's responsibilities.
Otherwise, The Daily is aiding in an ap

peal with possible dangerous ramifica
tions while not offering vital information
to protect students, an abuse that has se
rious ethical and even possible legal im
plications for the newspaper.

Causes of depression are
more than just Stanford
Monday's article, "Unmasking de
pression at Stanford" made a number of
good points about depression at Stan
ford, and we applaud the hard work of
The Daily in bringing, the attention of
the campus to this important issue. I low
ever, the article seemed to attribute the
cause of depression to Stanford itself.
That attribution is not only incorrect, but
can also add to the stigma against de
pression mentioned in the article.
Depression is a complex mental illness
with hereditary, environmental and chem
ical factors. Among the many theories of
depression is the diathesis-stress model,
which asserts that certain people are ge
netically and inclined to be
come depressed only after an initial envi
ronmental trigger. This trigger can be al
most anything—while coming to Stanford
may trigger depression, the same people
who become depressed at Stanford might
become depressed anywhere.
The chemical changes in the brain
brought about by depression are success
fully treated by antidepressants in a large
percentage of cases. The stigma against

depression is especially strong in relation
to antidepressants, which is harmful to
those who need them to function nor
mally here at Stanford. The stigma
against antidepressants causes a lot of
students here at Stanford to object to tak
ing medication when it might help, or to
discontinue usage before the antidepres
sants have a chance to take effect — this
often takes over a month.
We are disappointed that the article
failed to address the wide range of factors
that contribute to depression, and the ef
fect of stigma on its treatment. When
you're sick physically, you see a doctor;
when you suffer from depression, you
should also see a qualified doctor.
