MEN'S TRACK AND FIELD
Saturday-Sunday: Stan
ford finished first at the Pacific 10
Conference Championships

The Cardinal athletes were truly
relentless at the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships, putting to
gether a string of clutch perfor
mances to pull off an upset victory
for the second straight year.
"The athletes were fantastic,"
said head coach Vin Lananna.
"The Pac 10 is arguably the most
competitive track and field con
ference in the nation. For two
consecutive years we have de
fied the odds."
Optimistically, Stanford was
expected to score around 100
points over the two days of com
petition in Pullman, Wash.
The Cardinal men had other
ideas, beating that point total in
the distance events alone. The
team's final score of 151 sat a com
fortable 26 points ahead of sec
ond-place Oregon.
Seniors led the charge at the
championships. Jonathon Riley,
Gabe Jennings and Evan Kelty
delivered huge performances for
the team and ended their Pac-10
careers in style.
Riley won both the 10,000 me
ters (30 minutes, 22.64 seconds)
and the 5,000 meters (14:18.11),
the second Stanford athlete in his-

Tory to accomplish the feat.
Gabe Jennings won the 1,500
meters in 3:43.23, making him just
the second athlete to win the Pac
-10 title in the event three times.
The 1,500 meters came down
to a photo finish, with four ath
letes within a half second of each
other. Jennings had the slight
edge, as sophomores Don Sage
(3:43.52) and Grant Robison
(3:43.70) finished third and
fourth, respectively.
"I felt strong in the last 200
meters," said Jennings "I didn't
have much to spare, but I had
enough. 1 have to give credit to
my teammates. I rode off their
energy. We all played a part in
order to do well."
Jennings's finishing kick in the
800 meters moved him from sixth
to second place, beating out sever
al Arizona State runners and ef
fectively eliminating the Sun Dev
ils from title contention.
Kelty ran his best 400-meter
time ever by a half-second, plac
ing third in 46.86. Sophomore
Nick Sebes followed "in seventh
with a time 0f47.47.
Kelty was not alone in his
breakthrough performance.
Cardinal athletes exceeding ex
pectations was the rule rather
than the exception.
Junior Milton Little, seeded
third in the long jump, won the
competition with a jump of 24
feet, 10 inches, despite having to
compete in the 200 meters be
tween jumps.
Fellow junior Nick Welihozkiy
upset all of UCLA's throwing con
tingent, landing a second-place
finish in the hammer throw with a
throw of 198-5. The resulting

Placing third in conference
championships in one's first ever
attempt at a particular event is an
unlikely scenario, to say the least.
Sophomore lan Dobson accom
plished just that, however, with a
time 0f9:03.06 in his first collegiate
3,000-meter steeplechase.

Hie 21 points Stanford added
to its score after the 1,500 meters,
nearly matched the previous day's
27 points*in the 10,000 meters. In
that race, Luchini followed Riley in
third (30:29.58), junior Adam Ten
forde placed fourth (30:36.78),
sophomore Chris Emme took filth
(30:53.54) and senior Daniel Parris
placed seventh (31:23.78).
While the distance rtinners ac
counted for the bulk of Stanford's
score, points rolled in from the
field, as well.
Junior Michael Ponikvar won

the high jump for the third time,
joining Jennings as a three-time
Pac-10 champion. His mark was
7-0.5. Junior Omer Inan placed
second in the discus with a throw
of 183-8.
Stanford headed into the sec
ond-to-last event of the meet, the
5,000 meters, in close contention
with Oregon.
The distance squad that had
dominated the rest of the meet put
the final nail in Oregon's coffin,
sealing a Stanford victory.
Riley led junior Seth Hejny (sec

ond, 14:23.31), sophomore (Irani
Robison (third, 14:25.90), junior
Louis Luchini (sixth, 14:31.10) and
junior Jesse Thomas (seventh,

the event.

MEN'S TRACK AND FIELD
Saturday-Sunday: Stan
ford finished first at the Pacific 10
Conference Championships

The Cardinal athletes were truly
relentless at the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships, putting to
gether a string of clutch perfor
mances to pull off an upset victory
for the second straight year.
"The athletes were fantastic,"
said head coach Vin Lananna.
"The Pac 10 is arguably the most
competitive track and field con
ference in the nation. For two
consecutive years we have de
fied the odds."
Optimistically, Stanford was
expected to score around 100
points over the two days of com
petition in Pullman, Wash.
The Cardinal men had other
ideas, beating that point total in
the distance events alone. The
team's final score of 151 sat a com
fortable 26 points ahead of sec
ond-place Oregon.
Seniors led the charge at the
championships. Jonathon Riley,
Gabe Jennings and Evan Kelty
delivered huge performances for
the team and ended their Pac-10
careers in style.
Riley won both the 10,000 me
ters (30 minutes, 22.64 seconds)
and the 5,000 meters (14:18.11),
the second Stanford athlete in his-

Tory to accomplish the feat.
Gabe Jennings won the 1,500
meters in 3:43.23, making him just
the second athlete to win the Pac
-10 title in the event three times.
The 1,500 meters came down
to a photo finish, with four ath
letes within a half second of each
other. Jennings had the slight
edge, as sophomores Don Sage
(3:43.52) and Grant Robison
(3:43.70) finished third and
fourth, respectively.
"I felt strong in the last 200
meters," said Jennings "I didn't
have much to spare, but I had
enough. 1 have to give credit to
my teammates. I rode off their
energy. We all played a part in
order to do well."
Jennings's finishing kick in the
800 meters moved him from sixth
to second place, beating out sever
al Arizona State runners and ef
fectively eliminating the Sun Dev
ils from title contention.
Kelty ran his best 400-meter
time ever by a half-second, plac
ing third in 46.86. Sophomore
Nick Sebes followed "in seventh
