# Crew teams follow NBA omens

### SCOTT ALLEN STAFF COLUMNIST 
Question: What do the NBA playoffs have to do with
the Pacific 10 Conference Rowing Championships?
Ahswer: Probably more than you think.
The connections began Saturday, as the Lakers
became the first of two purple-and-gold giants to
roll into Sacramento last weekend. While Robe and
Co. were manhandling the Kings, the top-ranked
University of Washington crew teams were ready.-
ing for Sunday's Pac-10 Rowing Championships on
nearby Lake Natorna.
About as easily as the Lakers thwarted the most re
cent obstacle in the way of their third straight NBA
title, the Washington women's varsity eight defended
its Pac-10 championship, finishing nearly eight sec
onds ahead of second-place California with a time of 6
minutes, 46.40 seconds in the 2,000-meter race.
For the second straight year, the No. 12 Stanford
women finished fourth in the Grand Final, behind Wash
ington, Cal and Washington State. Less than one heart
breaking second separated second place from fourth.
Stanford rowed to a one-second lead over Cal and
Washington State for second place at the halfway
mark. The lead slowly dwindled to under a second
after 1,500 meters before the Cardinal was overtaken
in the final push.

MEN'S AND WOMEN'S CREW
Sunday: Stanford women finished third and Stan
ford men finished fourth at the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships

Signs that this was not the Cardinal's day were ap
pearing across the country at Continental Airlines
Arena in New Jersey, where the Nets and Celtics were
doing battle in what some might call the "Who Gets to
Lose to the Lakers" series, otherwise known as the
Eastern Conference Finals.
As for these eerie signs, get this: Just as the women's
varsity-eight Grand Final got Underway, Nets center
and Huskies alum Todd "Call meT-Mac" MacCulloch
was putting home two of his 14 points off a dish from
none other than former Cal standout Jason Kidd.
Less than a minute later, as the boats in Sacra
mento approached the 500-meter mark, MacCul
loch scored again and Washington pulled even far
ther ahead.
How did Stanford grad Jason Collins fare? Zero
points in five minutes off the bench. How's that for
foreshadowing?
It just wasn't in the cards for the Cardinal on a
rain-soaked Sunday, like it wasn't in the ping-pong
balls for several teams at the N BA
draft lottery.
The Stanford women will find
out tomorrow if they will receive a
bid to the NCAA Championships
to be held May 30 and May 31 in
Indianapolis, Ind. The top three
varsity eight boats received auto
matic berths. An invite would have
the Cardinal gleaming like Steve
Francis after his Rockets were

awarded the No. I draft pick on
Sunday. (Jetting passed over by
the NCAA selection committee
would have them experiencing
one of Francis's migraine
headaches, wondering what could
have been after a stellar season.
The men's Grand Final closed
out the Pac-10 Championships, as
the No. 15 Cardinal finished fourth
for the fourth straight year, behind
Cal, Washington and Oregon State
with a time of 6:09.80.
Stanford took control of fourth
place 500 meters in and stayed
neck-and-neck with Oregon State

for most of the race.
Cal came from behind to pull
off the upset, lurking in the sec
ond position much like Kidd wait
ing fora steal, for the first 1,500
meters before storming past
Washington. Like the point guard
accelerating ofl the dribble, the
Bears made up two full seconds in
the last 500 meters.
Earlier in the day, the men's ju
niorvarsity boat finished fifth in the
Grand Final, while the junior varsi
ty women finished third behind
Washington and Oregon State.
The junior varsity women's final

was one of the most exciting races
of the day for Stanford, as the Car
dinal avenged a defeat to Cal earli
er in the season by passing the
Bears over the final 1,000 meters.
l he men close out their season at
the Intercollegiate Rowing Associa
tion National Championships, which
begin May 28 in Cherry Hill, N. J.
In crew, unlike the NBA, teams
from the East are the general fa
vorites come postseason. The Stan
lord men have a chance to dispel
that belief, while the women anx
iously await and hope to get their
bid tomorrow.
