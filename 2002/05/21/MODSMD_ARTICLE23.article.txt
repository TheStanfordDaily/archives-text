# Crew teams follow NBA omens

### SCOTT ALLEN STAFF COLUMNIST 
Question: What do the NBA playoffs have to do with
the Pacific 10 Conference Rowing Championships?
Ahswer: Probably more than you think.
The connections began Saturday, as the Lakers
became the first of two purple-and-gold giants to
roll into Sacramento last weekend. While Robe and
Co. were manhandling the Kings, the top-ranked
University of Washington crew teams were ready.-
ing for Sunday's Pac-10 Rowing Championships on
nearby Lake Natorna.
About as easily as the Lakers thwarted the most re
cent obstacle in the way of their third straight NBA
title, the Washington women's varsity eight defended
its Pac-10 championship, finishing nearly eight sec
onds ahead of second-place California with a time of 6
minutes, 46.40 seconds in the 2,000-meter race.
For the second straight year, the No. 12 Stanford
women finished fourth in the Grand Final, behind Wash
ington, Cal and Washington State. Less than one heart
breaking second separated second place from fourth.
Stanford rowed to a one-second lead over Cal and
Washington State for second place at the halfway
mark. The lead slowly dwindled to under a second
after 1,500 meters before the Cardinal was overtaken
in the final push.

MEN'S AND WOMEN'S CREW
Sunday: Stanford women finished third and Stan
ford men finished fourth at the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships

Signs that this was not the Cardinal's day were ap
pearing across the country at Continental Airlines
Arena in New Jersey, where the Nets and Celtics were
doing battle in what some might call the "Who Gets to
Lose to the Lakers" series, otherwise known as the
Eastern Conference Finals.
As for these eerie signs, get this: Just as the women's
varsity-eight Grand Final got Underway, Nets center
and Huskies alum Todd "Call meT-Mac" MacCulloch
was putting home two of his 14 points off a dish from
none other than former Cal standout Jason Kidd.
Less than a minute later, as the boats in Sacra
mento approached the 500-meter mark, MacCul
loch scored again and Washington pulled even far
ther ahead.
How did Stanford grad Jason Collins fare? Zero
points in five minutes off the bench. How's that for
foreshadowing?
It just wasn't in the cards for the Cardinal on a
rain-soaked Sunday, like it wasn't in the ping-pong
