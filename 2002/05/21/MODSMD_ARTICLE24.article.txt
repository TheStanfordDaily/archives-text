## Reaching Ultimate's Heights 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Followers of college sports nationwide are
familiar with a lot of names that come out of
the Athletics Department, names like Jacob
sen, Fasani, Powell and Tom.
You probably wouldn't think anyone on
the Stanford Ultimate club teams would be
similarly recognized off the Farm. But with
the size, organization and tightness of the na
tional Ultimate community, Stanford names
like Percival and Whitaker are more well
known than you might think.
That's as in Erin Percival and Mike
Whitaker, the Stanford Ultimate teams'
nominees for the Callahan Award, given an
nually to the top men's and women's college
Ultimate players.
A lot of eyes will be on Percival and
Whitaker this weekend as they guide Su
perfly and Bloodthirsty — Stanford's
women's and men's teams, respectively —
at the 2002 U PA College Championships in
Spokane, Wash.

The ultimate tournament of college Ulti
mate will be the final chapter in the illustrious
careers of Percival and Whitaker—known as
Peedoo and Whit to their teammates — who
have become locally and nationally regarded
as two of the sport's best.
Whitaker's defensive prowess has become
the stuff of legends, both at Stanford and
while playing with Peligro, widely considered
Los Angeles' top Ultimate club team, when
he's at home in Northridge.
Percival has gained respect throughout
the college ranks as a solid two-way player,
capable of catching just about anything
thrown in her general direction and laying
out frequently on offense and defense. Last
week, she was named to the inaugural UPA
Northwest All-Region Team.
"I'd had some recognition in my high
school for soccer, but that was just in my
city," Percival said. "This is a foreign feeling
knowing that my name is on a Web site that
a lot of people across the country who play
Ultimate see. I never would've gotten that
playing soccer."

Playing soccer was Percival's original
plan on coming to Stanford. Ultimate start
ed as a way for her to keep in shape as she
tried to walk, on to the Cardinal women's
soccer team.
Fortunately for her teammates, past and
present, Percival s(xm forgot why she had
originally brought her cleats from her home
town of Sacramento to Stanford.
"I came out to a few practices, and I wasn't
too interested in the A-team," Percival said.
"The coach talked up Ultimate to me, and I
sort of made the decision to play Ultimate in
stead of soccer on a whim. It took me most of
that year to really fall in love with it, but now
I just totally love it. It was the best decision
I've made at Stanford."
Whitaker found his niche with Blood
thirsty early in his freshman year at Stan
ford, despite not even knowing the rules of
the game when he got to the Farm. Now a
graduate student in his final year of eligibil
ity, his name is almost synonymous with
