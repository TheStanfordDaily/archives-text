# Stanford's disc-masters Mike Whitaker and Erin Percival are
## Reaching Ultimate's Heights 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Followers of college sports nationwide are
familiar with a lot of names that come out of
the Athletics Department, names like Jacob
sen, Fasani, Powell and Tom.
You probably wouldn't think anyone on
the Stanford Ultimate club teams would be
similarly recognized off the Farm. But with
the size, organization and tightness of the na
tional Ultimate community, Stanford names
like Percival and Whitaker are more well
known than you might think.
That's as in Erin Percival and Mike
Whitaker, the Stanford Ultimate teams'
nominees for the Callahan Award, given an
nually to the top men's and women's college
Ultimate players.
A lot of eyes will be on Percival and
Whitaker this weekend as they guide Su
perfly and Bloodthirsty — Stanford's
women's and men's teams, respectively —
at the 2002 U PA College Championships in
Spokane, Wash.

The ultimate tournament of college Ulti
mate will be the final chapter in the illustrious
careers of Percival and Whitaker—known as
Peedoo and Whit to their teammates — who
have become locally and nationally regarded
as two of the sport's best.
Whitaker's defensive prowess has become
the stuff of legends, both at Stanford and
while playing with Peligro, widely considered
Los Angeles' top Ultimate club team, when
he's at home in Northridge.
Percival has gained respect throughout
the college ranks as a solid two-way player,
capable of catching just about anything
thrown in her general direction and laying
out frequently on offense and defense. Last
week, she was named to the inaugural UPA
Northwest All-Region Team.
"I'd had some recognition in my high
school for soccer, but that was just in my
city," Percival said. "This is a foreign feeling
knowing that my name is on a Web site that
a lot of people across the country who play
Ultimate see. I never would've gotten that
playing soccer."

Playing soccer was Percival's original
plan on coming to Stanford. Ultimate start
ed as a way for her to keep in shape as she
tried to walk, on to the Cardinal women's
soccer team.
Fortunately for her teammates, past and
present, Percival s(xm forgot why she had
originally brought her cleats from her home
town of Sacramento to Stanford.
"I came out to a few practices, and I wasn't
too interested in the A-team," Percival said.
"The coach talked up Ultimate to me, and I
sort of made the decision to play Ultimate in
stead of soccer on a whim. It took me most of
that year to really fall in love with it, but now
I just totally love it. It was the best decision
I've made at Stanford."
Whitaker found his niche with Blood
thirsty early in his freshman year at Stan
ford, despite not even knowing the rules of
the game when he got to the Farm. Now a
graduate student in his final year of eligibil
ity, his name is almost synonymous with

Stanford Ultimate.
"I fell in love with it the first
week," Whitaker said. "It was the
first time I'd really learned a new
sport since I was six or seven. This
was a brand new sport, and I was
humbled when I first started. I
didn't know how to throw at all. I
didn't have a forehand, had a pret
ty bad backhand. But you learn
fast. I was practicing against the
best players in the country, so you
have to learn fast or else it gets real
ly frustrating."
From their "humble" begin
nings, both Percival and Whitaker
have not only become two of the
most skilled players in the country,
t hey have also become bona tide stu
dents of the game.
"[Percival] understands the
game better than any other player

on the team and is often seen in con
sultation with the coaches about our
defensive and offensive strategies,"
said senior Ciwen Ambler, who also
plays on Fury, a Hay Area club team,
with Percival. "On top of it all,
Peedoo is a really fun person who
works hard but lightens the team's
hearts with entertaining stories and
antics. She is guaranteed to be the
life of any Ultimate party."
With most opponents well aware
of his knowledge of the game,
Whitaker has had to get used to hav
ing a target on his back when facing
other teams.
"It's weird seeing people in
newsgroups debate my merits for
getting the [Callahan] Award,"
Whitaker said. "I've always been
the player filling a role on a team.
It's weird being the one that other
teams pick out before games and
try to match up against."
Along with understanding the
tactics and strategies of, the game,
Percival and Whitaker also have

learned to appreciate the spirit of
the game that is at the heart of Ulti
mate around the world.
That spirit guides much of the
sport on and off the field, and
Whitaker and Percival have been no
strangers to the benefit of playing a
sport that breeds such a tight web
around the country.
"It's a wonderful environment
because you get to know people all
over the country, and anywhere you
go, the Ultimate community will
welcome you," Percival said.
Whitaker continued, "Any city
you go to, there's going to be Ulti
mate there, either clubs or pick-up
games. It's a nice safety net, because
as soon as you move anywhere, you
can meet a lot of people and make
connections through Ultimate."
Not only are there opportuni
ties to make new friends through
Ultimate, there are also chances to
compete with Ultimate clubs at the
local, national and even interna
tional levels.

"There's a very competitive
scene after college if you go to the
high-rank clubs," Whitaker said. "If
you play a lot of varsity sports here
and you don't make the pro ranks,
there isn't a lot for you out there.
With Ultimate, we're going to be
able to play competitively as long as
we want to."
Before they get too focused on
their post-Stanford' Ultimate ca
reers, there's still work to be done
with Bloodthirsty and Superfly.
"It was amazing to win a national
championship freshman year, but it
would mean a lot more this year
having been such a bigger part of
the team and playing more," Perci
val said. "I've never felt a better feel
ing in my life, so I would love to have
it again in my last year here."
"We made it to finals my fresh
man year," Whitaker said. "I have
much more of an appreciation now
of what it takes to get t here. I think
this is the best shot we've had at a na
tional tide since I've been here."
