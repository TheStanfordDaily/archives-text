Paul Steiger, the managing
editor and vice president of The
Wall Street Journal, spoke on
Sept. 1 l'seffects on internation
al media coverage yesterday af
ternoon at Kresge Auditorium.
The lecture, which was fol
lowed by a panel discussion,
was part of the annual John S.

Communication Department.

American growth. It made eco

Steiger explained that in
creased attention toward
strained international relations
and expanded overseas corre
spondents to cover terrorism
were among the recent changes
apparent in media coverage.
"The New York Times trun
cated [its] sports and metro sec
tions in order to increase [its[
focus on international news,"
Steiger said. "America is now
facing the fact that there is no
safe haven."
After America faced a 25-year
period of deregulation, the na
tion now forecasts a desire to in
crease expenditure on safety, he
said. An example of this is the re
cently established Department
of Homeland Security, which is
meant to strengthen national se-
