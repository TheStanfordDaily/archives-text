### ALBERT LEUNG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Paul Steiger, the managing
editor and vice president of The
Wall Street Journal, spoke on
Sept. 1 l'seffects on internation
al media coverage yesterday af
ternoon at Kresge Auditorium.
The lecture, which was fol
lowed by a panel discussion,
was part of the annual John S.
Knight and Carlos McClatchy
lectures sponsored by the
Communication Department.
This year, they were combined
into a single event for the first
time ever.
The past .year has proved to
be particularly grueling as the
newspaper's headquarters were
temporarily relocated to New
jersey after its main offices, situ
ated next to the World Trade
Center, were destroyed. Steiger
explained that besides the
change in geographical location,
the newspaper — as well as the
whole nation — experienced
several altering trends during
the post-Sept. 1 1 era.
"The horror of [Sept. 11J

certainly accelerated some im
portant trends that were un
derway after the end of the
C 1 into n ad minist r at ion,"
Steiger said. "Sept. 1 1 marked
the end of a 19-year era of
American growth. It made eco
nomic recession a certainty."
Steiger explained that in
creased attention toward
strained international relations
and expanded overseas corre
spondents to cover terrorism
were among the recent changes
apparent in media coverage.
"The New York Times trun
cated [its] sports and metro sec
tions in order to increase [its[
focus on international news,"
Steiger said. "America is now
facing the fact that there is no
safe haven."
After America faced a 25-year
period of deregulation, the na
tion now forecasts a desire to in
crease expenditure on safety, he
said. An example of this is the re
cently established Department
of Homeland Security, which is
meant to strengthen national se-

curity, especially at airports.
Steiger went on to discuss an
other post-Sept. 11 tragedy that
emotionally disturbed Americans
nationwide: the kidnapping and
execution of Wall Street Journal
foreign correspondent Daniel
Pearl, '85, in late January by a
group of militants in Pakistan.
Steiger regarded Pearl as one
of the best reporters in the
media industry.
"Pearl was a brilliant business
reporter and foreign correspon
dent. He was thoughtful, curious
and extremely well-read," Steiger
said. "His spirit lives on, inspiring
the next generation of media to
carry on."
"Journalism has been made
much more dangerous after Sept.
11. War always places reporters in
harm's way," Steiger added.

Steiger ended his lecture with
an emphasis on yet another
trend emerging from post-Sept.
11 media. The use of photogra
phy has gained a renewed signif
icance as graphic images splayed
across news pages in publica
tions nationwide. Publishers
have been reserving more space
for both black-and-white and
color photographs.
"The media industry is seeing
a fledgling renaissance of photog
raphy," Steiger said.
Steiger has been the managing
editor at the Wall Street Journal
since 1991. During this time, the
newspaper won 10 Pulitzer
Prizes, including one this year for
excellence in news coverage. He
first began his career with the
newspaper as a news reporter lo
cated in San Francisco.
This week, Steiger is expected
to accept the Columbia Journal
ism Award, the highest honor
given by Columbia University's
School of Journalism.
