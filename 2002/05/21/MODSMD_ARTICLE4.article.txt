Next fall, Stanford Student En
terprises will again hold a program
to bridge the gap between acade
mia and industry by exposing stu
dents to advanced concepts in busi
ness and leadership while putting
them in touch with prominent fig
ures in industry.
The four-day Business Leader
ship Program which started last
year admits approximately 70 ju
niors and seniors planning on
completing a coterminal master's
degree during the 2002-2003
school year.
The company developed the
idea for the program after observ
ing a similar program at Harvard.
According to Ross Davisson, the
current CEO of the group, the
high proportion of students pur
suing business careers and the lack
of an undergraduate business de
gree has facilitated the creation of
the program.
The program, which will run on
campus from Sept. 20 to Sept. 23,
will consist of classes and work
shops led by Stanford professors
from the Graduate School of Busi

ness, formal dinners with promi
nent keynote speakers and a num
ber of recruiting events aimed at
helping students get a head start
on the recruiting process.
Business Leadership Program
Manager Stephanie Chiang, a ju
nior, commented on the pro
gram's goals and aspirations.
"1 hope people will learn more
than just about getting a job,"
Chiang said. "We're also focusing
on the academic side of the pro
gram to help them get a better
understanding of the business
world in general."
According to Chiang, the pro
gram is an educational service
and a good opportunity for un
dergraduates interested in busi
ness. Early exposure to the acad
emic side of business as well as in
dustry representatives should
help participants make more ed
ucated career decisions, Davis
son added.
Chiang says that the company
has worked hard to ensure a first
rate experience for students, pro
fessors and industry sponsors alike.
"[The program] is an intimate
way to speak to company repre
sentatives in small groups and one
on-one," Chiang added.
Corporate sponsorship has
enabled the company to provide
the Business Leadership Pro
gram free of charge to students,
Chiang said.
All programming, including
dinner and housing, is included.
"We not only provide students
with the opportunity to meet inti
mately with business professionals,
but also promote a robust academ
ic approach to business," Chiang
said. "We think that both facets of
the program are extremely impor
tant to future success in the busi
ness world."
The deadline for applications is
Thursday, May 23. Information can
be obtained on the program's Web
site at sse.stanfbi d.edu/blp.
