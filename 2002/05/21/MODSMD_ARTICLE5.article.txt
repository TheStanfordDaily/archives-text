Cartoon characters with big eyes and
shtirp haircuts? Dark plotlines and moral
messages? It's all part of the world of
anime, the Japanese animation style that
has a growing following worldwide, and
among Stanford students.
"[American] cartoons are really re
stricted to kids —while if you watch
something like Jin-Roh (Wolf Brigade)
an anime flick that came out last year, it'll
seriously make you think fora couple
days about the meaning of life and what
not," Stilman said.
According to a fan Web site, Otaku
World, "they're nothing like the typical
American Saturday morning cartoons.
Anime is distinct from American car
toons in their depth of characterization
and plot.
"Much of anime deals with 'real-life'

topics that American cartoons wouldn't
touch with a 30-foot pole. For instance,
the death of major characters is common
in anime, as are complex relationships
between characters."
Frederick Lo is the Web master and
food manager for Newtype, Stanford's
anime club.
"Just about every genre you can think
of exists also in anime. Western, action,
drama, romance, comedy, sci-fi — you
name it, there's probably an anime about
it," Lo said.
The San Jose Mercury News recently
ran an article describing the "cult phe
nomenon" of anime in the United States.
"In recent years — as the Internet,
cable television and DVDs have made
anime easier to find — American
teenagers have embraced the genre in
droves," the article said.
Anime's visual style is often marked by
characters with enormous eyes, androgy

nous bodies and sharp haircuts in wild
colors. Plot lines are often dark and com
plex. Heroes and heroines regularly die,
while others morph into machines or
switch genders.
Fans, especially high school and col
lege-age Americans, are drawn to the re
alistic and colorful artwork, brooding
characters, and sophisticated plots. Sex
and violence are not uncommon in anime
shows and movies.
Newtype's Web site includes a warn
ing about the "extreme violence" and
"sexual situations" that might offend
some viewers.
"Anime is marvelous for adolescent
angst," said Susan Napier, a Japanese
Studies professor at the University of
Texas in the Mercury News. She is writ
ing a book about anime and youth. "The
teenage characters are very complex.
They have issues with their parents, are
from dysfunctional families and then

form families and tribes of their own,"
she continued.
An anime Web site, the Anime Web
Turnpike, includes links to fan clubs in all
50 states as well as a few in Puerto Rico.
I n California, anime has enjoyed a nat-

Ural fan base among Asian-American
teens. But other students are becoming
hooked in growing numbers. The Santa
Clara Convention Center recently hosted
FanimeCon 2002, a three-day conven
tion featuring panel discussions, "Japan
ese 101" and ongoing screenings of
anime. While 200 fans attended the first
FanimeCon in 1994, 3,500 came in 2001
and 5,000 were expected this year.
Newtype has been Stanford's anime
club since 1992. Members meet weekly to
watch and discuss episodes. Although the
club itself is nx>t large, there are many
anime fans on campus.
Chieze Okoye is the interim chair
of Newtype.
"The anime club on campus is fairly
small, but that is maybe an advertising
issue," Okoye said. Based on what I hear
from people that I talk to, I think that the
