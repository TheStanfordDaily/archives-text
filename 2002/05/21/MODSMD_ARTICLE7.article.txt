l<ast Friday and Saturday, a group of
faculty hosted a conference called "Be
coming Human," designed to promote an
interdisciplinary dialogue between scien
tific and religious disciplines.
Speakers from departments of anthro
pology, archeology, evolutionary biology,
humanities and religious studies came to
gether to explore the evolutionary ori
gins and adaptive significance of human
capacities for spiritual, religious and
moral thought.
The conference was chaired by Human
Biology Prof. William Hurlbut and An
thropology Prof. Bill Durham. Among the
speakers were Stanford's former Dean of
the Chapel Robert Hamerton-Kelly and
French Prof. Rene Girard.
The conference was sponsored by the

Templeton Foundation and marks the
first lecture series in a three-year program
to promote constructive interdisciplinary
dialogue between science and religion.
Among the topics covered were the
evolutionary origins of religious morality
in society.
"Morality is at the heart of the evolu
tionary story of becoming human," said
Evolutionary Biology Prof. David Sloan
Wilson from Binghamton University. Wil
son spoke on religion as an evolutionary
adaptation of human society.
Wilson's research revealed that despite
religion's strong inclination toward altru
ism and social-control mechanisms, preda
tory and competitive interactions often
exist among religious groups.
"Around the world and across history,
religion has functioned as mighty engines
of collective action," Wilson said.
Just as natural selection favors indi
viduals that can successfully pass on
their genes, "the gospels that created
communities are the ones that survive,"
he continued.
