# 'Becoming Human' dialogue connects science, religion
## Speakers explore links between various fields to explain human origins and development 
### KHANH LAI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
l<ast Friday and Saturday, a group of
faculty hosted a conference called "Be
coming Human," designed to promote an
interdisciplinary dialogue between scien
tific and religious disciplines.
Speakers from departments of anthro
pology, archeology, evolutionary biology,
humanities and religious studies came to
gether to explore the evolutionary ori
gins and adaptive significance of human
capacities for spiritual, religious and
moral thought.
The conference was chaired by Human
Biology Prof. William Hurlbut and An
thropology Prof. Bill Durham. Among the
speakers were Stanford's former Dean of
the Chapel Robert Hamerton-Kelly and
French Prof. Rene Girard.
The conference was sponsored by the

Templeton Foundation and marks the
first lecture series in a three-year program
to promote constructive interdisciplinary
dialogue between science and religion.
Among the topics covered were the
evolutionary origins of religious morality
in society.
"Morality is at the heart of the evolu
tionary story of becoming human," said
Evolutionary Biology Prof. David Sloan
Wilson from Binghamton University. Wil
son spoke on religion as an evolutionary
adaptation of human society.
Wilson's research revealed that despite
religion's strong inclination toward altru
ism and social-control mechanisms, preda
tory and competitive interactions often
exist among religious groups.
"Around the world and across history,
religion has functioned as mighty engines
of collective action," Wilson said.
Just as natural selection favors indi
viduals that can successfully pass on
their genes, "the gospels that created
communities are the ones that survive,"
he continued.
Manjula Waldron, a resident
chaplain, commented on Wil
son's theory.
"It is very interesting to consid
er religion as an evolutionary
phenomenon," Waldron said.
UC-Berkeley Anthropology
Prof. Margaret Conkey also
emphasized the importance of
religion in the development of
human civilization. She ex
plained that Paleolithic (ice
age) humans began to inter
pret the world through images
and symbols, infusing spiritual
and religious meanings ,into
their artwork.
Girard noted the religious role
of sacrifice in the archaic cultures
and its impact on society's evolu
tion. He emphasized that sacrifice
is always strategically placed at
positions where there is a threat

of conflict.
"We live in a sacrificial
world," Girard said. " The func
tion of sacrifice is to protect soci
ety from violence."
Translated into modern
times, Girard suggested that
Osama bin Laden may be the
sacrificial victim of society's need
for scapegoats.
Several times during the con
ference, speakers felt compelled to
address the issue of violence in the
Middle East, as well as the moral
and spiritual implications of the
United States' 'War on Terror.'
"Our amazing ability to gen
eralize and represent each other
is the root of all evil," said Ter
rence Deacon, biological anthro
pology professor at Boston Uni
versity. Along with this comes
the potential for great destruc
tion through the perversion of
moral reasoning," he said.
"It's important to discuss what
it means to become more fully
human,'.' Hurlbut said.
