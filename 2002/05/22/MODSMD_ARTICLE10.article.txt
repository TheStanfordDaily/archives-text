# Bush bans guns from cockpits

### 
WAS HIN GTO N (AP) â€”No
guns in the cockpit, the Bush ad
ministration decided yesterday,
saying pilots should concentrate
on flying their airliners and let
trained air marshals defend
against possible terrorists.
Transportation Undersecre
tary John Magaw's announcement
was criticized by some lawmakers
and the pilots' unions, who said
they would try to overturn the de
cision.
Magaw told the Senate Com
merce Committee that air mar
shals are better equipped to un
dergo the specialized training to
safely handle guns on airplanes.
The pilots, behind newly strength
ened cockpit doors, can steer the
aircraft to throw hijackers off bal
ance and should have cameras in
stalled so they can see what is hap
pening in the cabin, he said.

"I'ilots need to concentrate on
flying the plane," Magaw said. "My
feeling is yon secure the cockpit,
and if something does happen on
that plane, they really have to be in
control of the aircraft. Pilots
should not have firearms in the
cockpit."
Most flights do not have air mar
shals on board, though the Trans
portation Security Administration
is hiring and training more.
Magaw said he was still deciding
whether to allow nonlethal
weapons, such as stun guns. Might
attendant unions have been push
ing for stun guns in the cabin, since
pilots are 110 longer supposed to
leave the cockpit to help quell a
disturbance.
"Guns in the cockpit offer a false
sense of security because it doesn't
do anything to protect the people
in the back of the cabin that are left

to die if there's an attacker on
board," said Dawn Deeks, a
spokeswoman for the Association
of Flight Attendants. "We need to
make sure there are defensive ca
pabilities in the cabin."
The Air Transport Association,
the trade organization for tfie
major airlines, was pleased. The
group cited the "unintended con
sequences of arming pilots with
firearms and the potential dangers
posed to innocent passengers and
other crew members."
An advocacy group represent
ing passengers, the Air Travelers
Association, criticized Magaw's de
cision.
"We agree that airline pilots
should have flying as their first pri
ority, but what do pilots do if ter
rorists actually make their way into
the cockpit?" association president
David Stem pier said.
