The Kyodo news agency recently reported that
Sony has begun developing a gaming console to
succeed the Play Station 2. The third-generation
Play Station will feature a powerful microprocessing
unit that would be about 200 times faster than those
used for current video game machines and person
al computers. The new machine would be designed
for online use on high-speed fiber-optic networks.
The console is expected to be released in 2005.
If you have several million dollars to spare, then
Russia may be your ticket to space. The Russian
space agency is still waiting for an official applicant
to be the world's third space tourist on a flight to the
International Space Station scheduled for the fall.
Celebrities that have expressed interest in joining

the October trip include Lance Bass of pop group
'N Sync and former NASA official Lori Garver. The
space tourist will join commander Sergei Zaletin
and European Space Agency astronaut Frank
DeWinne of Belgium.
If you're in the market fora robot dog, Sony's en
tertainment robot, "Aibo" is getting cheaper to own.
The company recently revealed new versions of the
electronic puppy that offer improvements on the
previous models with lower prices. The new ver
sions of the ERS-3118 and 3128 are designed to re
semble a bulldog or pug, and have added support
for Bluetooth wireless communication. They will re
tail for $765 and $840 respectively, a marked de
crease in prices. The ERS-311 B/ X has an addition
al suede coating on top of the plastic casing. More
advanced models will feature a 384 MHz processor,
which will double the speed of previous models.
