# Merrill Lynch to pay $100 million settlement
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Merrill Lynch 8c Co.
will pay a $100 million fine to settle charges its
analysts misled investors by touting shares in
companies so the firm would win highly prof
itable investment banking business from the
same companies.
The agreement reached yesterday with New
York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer also re
quires Merrill Lynch to stop rewarding its 800
analysts for helping the firm win investment
banking fees for arranging mergers and new
stock offerings.
Now Merrill Lynch's analysts will be paid
only for the quality of their stock research and
won't get any money generated from the firm's
investment banking division.
"By adopting the reforms embodied in the
settlement, Merrill Lynch is setting a new stan
dard for the rest of the industry to follow,"
Spitzer said.
The nation's biggest brokerage also apolo
gized, and agreed to put in place structural re
forms to ensure its stock analysts work inde
pendently from the firm's investment bankers.
Spitzer said he hopes the Securities and Ex
change Commission, which regulates broker
ages, will require all Wall Street firms to comply
with the terms.
Spitzer said he spoke with SEC chairman
Harvey Pitt yesterday morning before an
nouncing the settlement, but did not disclose
details.
Annette Nazareth, the SEC's director of

market regulation, praised Spitzer's work on
the issue but said the SEC would continue with
its own probe. She said the SEC would work
with Spitzer on analyst reforms, but did not in
dicate whether the settlement's terms would be
proposed as rules.
"While this settlement is an important
milestone for investor protection, it is not the
finish line, and will not preclude our own ef
forts on behalf of the investing public,"
Nazareth said.
New York state will get $48 million, and the
rest of the money will be given to the remaining
49 states and the District of Columbia and
Puerto Rico as long as they accept the settle
ment's terms.
Spitzer, however, made a major concession
by dropping a demand that Merrill Lynch
admit wrongdoing — which would have crip
pled the brokerage's defense in at least 30 law
suits filed by investors who blamed their losses
on overly optimistic stock ratings.
"It would have in essence been a death war
rant for the company to admit liability," Spitzer
said. Several weeks ago, Spitzer also dropped a
demand that Merrill create an investor restitu
tion fund.
In a 10-month investigation, Spitzer's inves
tigators uncovered e-mail messages from ana
lysts that disparaged shares of Internet compa
nies they rated as good buys for investors
Some used vulgarities to describe the stocks
in messages that Merrill Lynch chairman and

chief executive David H. Komanksy called em
barrassing to the company.
Komansky said the investigation and its rev
elations hurt Merrill Lynch's image, but said he
did not believe the firm lost much business as a
result.
"1 think we'll be able to regain the confi
dence of the investing public," he said.
The.settlement goes far beyond efforts by
the SEC and industry groups to reform analyst
stock ratings and analyst compensation, said
Benjamin Mark Cole, author of "The Pied
Pipers of Wall Street: How Analysts Sell You
Down the River."
However, Cole said the settlement's true im
pact on analyst independence won't be clear for
years. He also warned that analysts'jobs could
still be threatened if they issue negative stock
ratings on companies valued for their potential
investment banking revenue.
"One has to wonder if brokerages will still
fire analysts for not playing ball," he said. "If
they see that one of their buddies got fired for
calling it like he sees it, what are they going to
do?"
Merrill Lynch stressed that the agreement
"represents neither evidence nor admission
of wrongdoing or liability," and Komansky
said the company would defend itself from
the investor lawsuits generated by Spitzer's
investigation.
Merrill Lynch shares rose 47 cents yesterday
to $43.85 on the New York Stock Exchange.
