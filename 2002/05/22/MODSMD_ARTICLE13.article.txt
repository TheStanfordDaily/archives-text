threats against New York and some of its land

Brooklyn Bridge.
Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly char

but patrols were increased at some popular
sites, including the statue and the bridge.
A law enforcement official speaking on con
dition of anonymity said the information came
from an unidentified detainee who spoke with
the FBI. The threat did not mention any date
or time fora possible attack.
The warning came one day before the start
of Fleet Week, an annual maritime celebration
expected to draw 6,000 naval personnel to the
city through the Memorial Day holiday week

It also comes about a week before the city

plans to end search and recovery work at the
site of the World Trade Center, where more
than 2,800 people died in the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.
Kelly said the NYPL) was prepared for "any
eventuality."
"We are taking all necessary precautions and
are communicating with the appropriate law
enforcement agencies on both the state and
federal levels," he said.
Security was increased around monuments
and landmarks after the warning was relayed to
New York, the official said. Kelly would not
confirm any details, but heightened security
was visibly in place at City Hall and the Brook
lyn Bridge.
The city is preparing for Fleet Week 2002,
an annual gathering that this year boasts the
largest number of U.S. naval vessels ever sent to
New York City by an Atlantic Fleet comman
der. Sailors, marines and Coast Cuard person

nel will be aboard 22 ships, including six war
ships.
The public is invited aboard ships participat
ing in the festival.
Gov. George Pataki urged people to visit
New York despite the threats.
"We cannot allow threats to take away our
freedom or our confidence," Pataki said.
"There are going to be threats for the foresee
able future."
Pataki said the state has received all types of
threats over the past eight months, but state
and city officials have taken security steps. 1 le
said the threats were aimed at "dividing us
and frightening us and taking away our free
dom by fear."
Nearly every major tourist attraction, in
cluding all the big museums, the Empire State
Building and the Statue of Liberty, were closed
following the Sept. 11 attack on the World
Trade Genter.
