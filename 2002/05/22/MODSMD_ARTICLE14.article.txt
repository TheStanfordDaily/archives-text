## The 						Stanford Daily Senior Gift planners should reconsider strategy 
### 
Published Since 1891

Since 1993, the graduating senior class
has presented the University with the
Senior Gift — a donation to the Stan
ford Fund in direct support of under
graduate education. Despite being critical of
some tactics employed in raising the funds for
the gift, we urge seniors to donate in order to
support the school that has given each of us so
much. We also believe the University should
take steps to show seniors the degree to which
the gift is valued and to give them a greater
sense of directly improving Stanford through
their donations.
We believe the primary problem with the
Senior Gift is that while seniors know it carries
great value for the University — that is, the
promise that students will open their check
books widely and often for Stanford — its di
rect impact is not readily apparent. Part of the
problem is that the gift is a monetary donation

not made toward any specific end. Instead, it is
combined in a large pot of money that funds
those undergraduate programs we cherish:
undergraduate research opportunities grants,
Overseas Studies, Introductory Seminars and
financial aid awards.
A $20 donation — which translates to $80,
because each gift is matched threefold by
alumnus Peter Bing and the Parent Advisor)'
Board — seems like a negligible sacrifice for
such a worthy cause. However, contributing
money to no obvious end causes many seniors
to reflect on the times they have paid money to
Stanford before. After four years of tuition,
books and dining-hall bills, students can find
plenty of justification for not donating.
The Stanford Fund should recognize that
repeatedly sending donation requests to the se
nior class makes students feel more like walking
wallets than individuals with whom the Univer

sity cares about maintaining connections.
Another concern we have with the Senior
gift is the amount organizers spend on promo
tional fundraising. One of the chairs said that
in the past about $15,000 was spent on golf
carts, key chains and mailings. The average gift
donation over the last 8 years is $22,200, not
counting matching funds. With no immediate
ly visible results from the gift, we wonder if last
year's donations are merely being used to fund
mailings for this year's gift drive.
Fundraisers even visit students' rooms and
use freshman dorm connections to urge stu
dents to give. We believe these aggressive
fundraising tactics are unnecessary and we ask
that the Senior Gift Chairs realize that, espe
cially at this point in the year, seniors are aware
of the Senior Gift and may have reasons for
choosing not to give.
We propose the following solution: draw up

a list of projects needing funding, and allow
the graduating class to vote at the beginning of
its senior year on which project the gift will
fund. This will provide seniors with a much
needed rallying point and will only improve
participation.
The Senior Gift is an important Stanford
tradition. It is beneficial for students to get into
the habit of supporting Stanford as alumni.
Consider that full tuition for four years pays
for less than 60 percent of the cost of educating
a Stanford student. Think of the Senior Gift as
a tip after a meal: no one is obligated to leave
one, but it is a way of showing gratitude for
good service.
We were each given the privilege of attend
ing Stanford, and we should use the Senior-
Gift as an opportunity to ensure that our
unique undergraduate experiences exist for
future generations of Stanford students.
