# RUNNING ON EMPTY
## Sweet dreams for techies 
### 
I once promised that this column
would offer the kind of hard-hitting
investigative reporting the astute
Daily reader has come to expect from
page four. Wherever the hot-button issues
of the day are going down, rest assured that
Running on Empty will be there, unless it is
raining, or cold outside, or I have some
thing else to do.
This week, Running on Empty travels to
the dark netherworld that is one of Stan
ford's best-known dirty secrets, a bastion of
sleep deprivation and neglected personal
hygiene that many enter but few ever leave.
This week's question: what's going on in
side Sweet Hall?
At some point in your Stanford career,
you will be required to visit Sweet Hall.

For fuzzies, your contact
with the building will
likely be limited to the 30
seconds you spend drop
ping off your overseas ap
plication, so that you can
have the life-altering ex
perience of spending a
quarter in a foreign coun
try drinking with other

Americans.
For techies and people with a physical
aversion to sunlight, Sweet Hall takes on a
whole new significance. Sweet Hall, in
technical terms, is where the big computers
live. It is on these gargantuan machines
that computer-science types spend the
prime of their youth working on long as
signments, or "programs." The content of
these programs is top-secret. If you ask
people iu Swctrl Hall what they are work
ing on, they will respond with cryptic an
swers like " Bunnyworld" or " E271," which
apparently is some kind of code.
These programs can consume a great
deal of time, often in consecutive blocks that
span anywhere from a few hours to several
presidential administrations.
When so engaged, it is not unusual for
people to eat or sleep at their computer
rather than submit to the hassle of leaving
the building. Eventually a young program
mer may find it more convenient to have
his or her mail sent there.
From what I understand, it can become
sort of a home away from home, albeit a de
pressing, life-sucking home that eerily re
sembles my high-school gym locker.
As I would rather remove the chalk
drawings from White Plaza with my tongue
than take a computer science class, I have
never experienced the joy of Sweet Hall
firsthand. In the name of good journalism
1 went in search of the truth about this im
penetrable fortress of Stanford geekery.
Also, I heard there is sometimes free pizza.
The first thing I noticed was the smell. It
was not entirely a bad smell, but definitely
not a good one, either. It smelted like a dirty
dorm carpet, or like a plane after a long
trip. It smelted like shoes and people who
have been sitting a really, really long time.
It was about 11:30 at night, and so there was

no one at the help desk to ask if opening a
window is in violation of some kind of poli
cy. If it is not, and anyone at Sweet Hall is
reading this right now, I strongly recom
mend it.
The second thing I noticed about the
second floor where the workstations are is
that it is very, very . .. beige. Disconcerting
ly beige. The walls are beige, the computers
are beige, even the people have faded to a
sallow shade of ecru.
The sparseness of the decor and the
bland choice of color scheme give the im
pression of a sensory deprivation tank, the
kind of place you would hold someone for
hours until they break, as the inhabitants of
Sweet Hall certainly have.
There were probably 30 people working
in the room, but apart from the gentle click
ing of keyboard keys and a few people mut
tering gendy to themselves, I couldn't hear
a sound.
People sat complacently in front of their
machines, some slumped in their chairs,
some staring at the screens with glazed eyes.
I expected to see frustration, desperation,
maybe even some excitement from some
one who had reached a breakthrough after
sitting for 17 hours in the same pants.
'Hiere was no visible emotion. Clearly,
the machines have won.
I ran into a guy from my house who
tipped me off to the existence of "hard
core" programmers in the basement.
These are people doing graphic design
work on giant computers with names like
"Firebird" and "Talon," which would be
really cool names fora car or a motorcycle
but somehow lose their edge as soon as
you hear the little "clickety-clack" sound a
keyboard makes.
I Tie basement was dark and colder than
the rest of the building. There were a few
empty rooms with keypad locks on the
doors. I was going to leave — it was actual
ly kind of creeping me out — when I saw a
light coming from around the hallway and
decided to check it out.
One of the doors was propped open. I
peeked in and alone in a room encircled by
imposing black monitors were two guys,
gesturing at something on a screen and
talking urgently to each other in a language
I don't speak. They blinked at me in a dis
oriented way, as though they had been for
gotten by the outside world and were en
countering their first human in quite some
time. I swear one of them had no eyes, like
a mole.
So that was my trip. I hope I haven't
painted an unfair portrait of the hard
working people who often find themselves
doing the Bunnyworld tango, and if I have
offended anyone, I'm sorry.
Because after all, I can laugh now - but
you'll have a job.
Corinne PurtUl thinks someone should biing
bread and water to those two guys in the basement.
E-mail her ij you uwint to go at cpurtHl@stan
