Entire Stanford community must speak
out against killings in Gujarat
Suraj Jacob's column illuminates the
dark and deadly silence of apathy. This
apathy lives on psychological blindness, as
our minds selectively choose which injus
tices we allow to touch our hearts.
Such selectivity makes the difference
between our mind thinking and us verbal
izing, "That's horrible and frightening,"
and forgetting about it the next moment
and us feeling a bloodsucking sick attack
on our hearts. It is an attack whose
wounds manifest itself in fear, grief, em
pathy or can more destructively, manifest
itself in anger, hate, and bigotry. I admire
the life with which Jacob vocalizes the dis
turbing living apathy. I n doing so, he per
petuates the essence of human life, empa
thy and hurnanitarianism.
The recognition of this learned emo
tional blindness — that is, people feeling
more empathy toward their family mem
bers or those of their own gender — is the
frightening essence that is fueling Gu
jarat's fire. It is empathy toward members
of one's own religion, manifesting itself in
violence, overpowering one's empathy to
ward members of the other religion.
This precedence is a disturbing degree
of living apathy — it is an apathy fed by
empathy and a reality that scares me to
death. It is this element of emotional
blindness that creates the mob mentality
and destructive "unity" that leaders of vio
lence manipulate to continue bloody out
rageous conflict.
Not only as a Muslim, but as a human,
I agree with Jacob in condemning any sort
of violence toward that of any group. Yet,
I also realize that this blameworthy apathy
is not a concept that will change overnight,
but voices like Jacob's, forums and outlets
may help steer the path of change.

Unfortunately, in this world, silence
condemns little, it speaks little and pos
sesses a very ambiguous voice. To listen to
silence requires the patience and careful
listening, which most people do not en
gage in.
Like Jacob, I ask people to speak and
respond because peace is a public good
and a benefit to all, and its absence can be
a poison to all.
Yet, unlike Jacob, I do not agree with
focusing on student groups to respond,
human divisions, but more so, for individ
uals to unite regardless of student group
to condemn the violence in Gujarat. Yes,
this may entail using student groups as
means to unite and organize rallies, fo
rums and more, but no one group is "re
sponsible" for responding. As humans, we
all should be responding.
Indian or not, Muslim or Hindu, peo
ple need to breakdown the mental block
ade and let the thought of atrocity touch
their hearts and compel them to demand
a political outcry of this violence.
The Hindu Students Council's re
sponse should come second to the disturb
ing idea of overarching apathy. Its track
record of responding and its responsibili
ties as a student group is not the main con
cern (although disturbing) — it is our
human empathy that is in question with
blind living that does not condemn the
taking of life in other areas of the world.
And quoting Jacob's eloquent state
ment, "Let us break out of parochial si
lences." I say let us not focus on or con
demn student groups but question an
underlying overall living apathy that
symbolizes the death of humanity and ,
silent support of genoc ide and violence.
Being at Stanford or an institute of high
er learning, one would think that there
would exist a force toward opening our
minds and crossing barriers learned

through various socialization processes.
One would think that this force would
cause us to feel what it is like to lose peo
ple you love and to witness gross atroci
ties. Yet, maybe, as thinking Stanford stu
dents, we have yet to learn a lot about al
lowing ourselves to feel.

Berkeley student comments on
'ugly Stanford girls'
Your article on "Keeping Stanford
Ugly" was truly uplifting. I have been bur
dened with the incessant complaining of
the "booty" girls at UC-Berkeley in com
parison to the prim-and-perfect girls in
Los Angeles always dressed for the occa
sion, whether it be a night at a hot club or
a trip to the nearest 7-11. Reading your ar
ticle gave me hope to believe that UC-
Berkeley girls aren't at the bottom of the
list after all! Shucks, I guess UC-Berkeley
doesn't always beat Stanford!

Daily misunderstands prof's comments
Your writer Khanh Lai seems to have
completely misunderstood Prof. Rene Gi
rard's answer to a question about terror
ism at the Becoming Human Conference.
Prof. Girard did not in fact call Osama
bin leaden a scapegoat or sacrificial vic tim
— he said precisely the opposite, answer
ing that he would not call bin Laden a
scapegoat. His point earlier in his talk was
