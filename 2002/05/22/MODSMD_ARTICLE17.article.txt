Entire Stanford community must speak
out against killings in Gujarat
Suraj Jacob's column illuminates the
dark and deadly silence of apathy. This
apathy lives on psychological blindness, as
our minds selectively choose which injus
tices we allow to touch our hearts.
Such selectivity makes the difference
between our mind thinking and us verbal
izing, "That's horrible and frightening,"
and forgetting about it the next moment
and us feeling a bloodsucking sick attack
on our hearts. It is an attack whose
wounds manifest itself in fear, grief, em
pathy or can more destructively, manifest
itself in anger, hate, and bigotry. I admire
the life with which Jacob vocalizes the dis
turbing living apathy. I n doing so, he per
petuates the essence of human life, empa
thy and hurnanitarianism.
The recognition of this learned emo
tional blindness — that is, people feeling
more empathy toward their family mem
bers or those of their own gender — is the
frightening essence that is fueling Gu
jarat's fire. It is empathy toward members
of one's own religion, manifesting itself in
violence, overpowering one's empathy to
ward members of the other religion.
This precedence is a disturbing degree
of living apathy — it is an apathy fed by
empathy and a reality that scares me to
death. It is this element of emotional
blindness that creates the mob mentality
and destructive "unity" that leaders of vio
lence manipulate to continue bloody out
rageous conflict.
Not only as a Muslim, but as a human,
I agree with Jacob in condemning any sort
of violence toward that of any group. Yet,
I also realize that this blameworthy apathy
is not a concept that will change overnight,
but voices like Jacob's, forums and outlets
may help steer the path of change.

Unfortunately, in this world, silence
condemns little, it speaks little and pos
sesses a very ambiguous voice. To listen to
silence requires the patience and careful
listening, which most people do not en
gage in.
Like Jacob, I ask people to speak and
respond because peace is a public good
and a benefit to all, and its absence can be
a poison to all.
Yet, unlike Jacob, I do not agree with
focusing on student groups to respond,
human divisions, but more so, for individ
uals to unite regardless of student group
to condemn the violence in Gujarat. Yes,
this may entail using student groups as
means to unite and organize rallies, fo
rums and more, but no one group is "re
sponsible" for responding. As humans, we
all should be responding.
Indian or not, Muslim or Hindu, peo
ple need to breakdown the mental block
ade and let the thought of atrocity touch
their hearts and compel them to demand
a political outcry of this violence.
The Hindu Students Council's re
sponse should come second to the disturb
ing idea of overarching apathy. Its track
record of responding and its responsibili
ties as a student group is not the main con
cern (although disturbing) — it is our
human empathy that is in question with
blind living that does not condemn the
taking of life in other areas of the world.
And quoting Jacob's eloquent state
ment, "Let us break out of parochial si
lences." I say let us not focus on or con
demn student groups but question an
underlying overall living apathy that
symbolizes the death of humanity and ,
silent support of genoc ide and violence.
Being at Stanford or an institute of high
er learning, one would think that there
would exist a force toward opening our
minds and crossing barriers learned

through various socialization processes.
One would think that this force would
cause us to feel what it is like to lose peo
ple you love and to witness gross atroci
ties. Yet, maybe, as thinking Stanford stu
dents, we have yet to learn a lot about al
lowing ourselves to feel.

Berkeley student comments on
'ugly Stanford girls'
Your article on "Keeping Stanford
Ugly" was truly uplifting. I have been bur
dened with the incessant complaining of
the "booty" girls at UC-Berkeley in com
parison to the prim-and-perfect girls in
Los Angeles always dressed for the occa
sion, whether it be a night at a hot club or
a trip to the nearest 7-11. Reading your ar
ticle gave me hope to believe that UC-
Berkeley girls aren't at the bottom of the
list after all! Shucks, I guess UC-Berkeley
doesn't always beat Stanford!

Daily misunderstands prof's comments
Your writer Khanh Lai seems to have
completely misunderstood Prof. Rene Gi
rard's answer to a question about terror
ism at the Becoming Human Conference.
Prof. Girard did not in fact call Osama
bin leaden a scapegoat or sacrificial vic tim
— he said precisely the opposite, answer
ing that he would not call bin Laden a
scapegoat. His point earlier in his talk was
that we use the term "scapegoat" when we
refer to an innocent sacrificial victim.

Anime has been popular at Stanford
for years
We were shocked and appalled by your
cover story on anime. There are two main
points we will address in this letter: the
point about American cartoons and the
point about Anime at Stanford.
First, to say that American cartoons are
directed at kids is dangerous and inaccu
rate. Yourarticlecompletely overlooks the
mature target audience of ingenious
shows like The Tick, Invader Zim, Ren &
Stimpy, South Park and of course, The
Simpsons. These Neilsen-rated classics
have been wowing cartoon oldsters for
years. They are as much a part of Ameri

ca as apple pie and big guns, and as we all
knovv, the appeal of these ideals does not
stop at age 10.
Further, for your article to say that
anime is only beginning to achieve popu
larity at Stanford is patently untrue.
Courses such as "Japanese Pop Culture"
have included anime on their syllabi since
their inceptions, and student groups
across campus have screened such anime
blockbusters as Princess Mononoke.
Years ago when Green Hay went soft,
Anime replaced punk rock as the reason
du jour to color one's hair pink, blue and
a Hurry of other cartoonish colors. The
ASSU Speakers Bureau brought super
star anime mega-hunk Tenshi Muyo as
part of their Distinguished Speaker Se
ries three years ago. And who can forget
when Vampire Hunter 1) ran for Tree?
That crazy stunt when he ate people with
his hand was freaking awesome. Besides,
the Office of Residential Education has
been packing resident assistant positions
with anime characters since the begin
ning of time.
For this article on such an important
topic to have made the front page of The
Daily with so little research reflects poorly

on the quality of so-called "current events"
on this campus.

Bush Administration 'taking advantage'
of Sept. 11 tragedy
White House Press Secretary Ari Fleis
cher denounced calls for an investigation
into the Bush administration's pre-Sept.
11 knowledge of terrorist intent as being
"political." While Fleischer gallantly
points the finger, I would like to not so
gently remind him that the Bush adminis
tration is just as guilty of taking advantage
of our nation's greatest tragedy as he and
Vice President Dick Cheney have so omi
nously accused the Democrats of doing so.
Just as "political" are those who have not
spoken out for or against the administra
tion despite what is in their hearts.
I do not contend that any governmental
or intelligence agency could have had the
capacity to predict the extent of the horror

that struck our country on that day. 1 can
even accept National Security Adviser Con
doleezza Rice's assertion that the warnings
were generalized and that it would have
been irresponsible tor the government to
send the nation into hysterics over insuffi
cient evidence. What I will not tolerate is
the fact that President George W. Bush al
lowed every branch of intelligence to stand
accused of negligence and ineptitude when
his administration suttered the same inabil
ity to play connect-the-dots.
The bottom line is that Sept. 11 was a
godsend to a president and to an adminis
tration that up to that point had only one
foot left in the Oval Office. Bush selfishly
rode the wave of patriotism and allowed
other lifetime government servants' ca
reers and reputations to fall along the way.
Sen. Tom Daschle made a valid assertion
when he questioned why the Bush admin
istration secreted this information for the
last eight months. Sadly, I see our present
revelation as only a symptom of a larger
and more dangerous disease that the Bush
administration suffers. Bush has pointed
fingers and thrown mud at anyone who
questions his authority. However, when
he gets mud in his eye, he puritanically as

serts the power of his office and feigns
shook at those who would dare question
the president.
As a private citizen, I stand to gain
nothing but hate mail from voicing my
opinion. I write not just because I am un
happy with the administration's cover-up,
but because I am angry that it has
stonewalled the public's right to informa
tion in every situation. To this day, we are
not allowed to question the relationship
Enron had with our national energy poli
cy or have access to Ronald Reagan's and
George H. W. Bush's papers. VVe are told
it is unpatriotic to question a wartime
president. If that were true, our country
would still be fighting in Vietnam. We are
good citizens if we nod our heads and
blindly agree to everything Big Brother
says. As soon as we have a contrary opin
ion we are "second-guessing obstruction
ists." Bush and his advisiers have deftly
spun every controversy by leveraging a
judgment about the accuser's level of pa
triotism-and that is the most politically
unpatriotic second-guessing obstruction
of all.

respond because peace is a public good
and a benefit to all, and its absence can be
a poison to all.
Yet, unlike Jacob, I do not agree with
focusing on student groups to respond,
human divisions, but more so, for individ
uals to unite regardless of student group
to condemn the violence in Gujarat. Yes,
this may entail using student groups as
means to unite and organize rallies, fo
rums and more, but no one group is "re
sponsible" for responding. As humans, we
all should be responding.
Indian or not, Muslim or Hindu, peo
ple need to breakdown the mental block
ade and let the thought of atrocity touch
their hearts and compel them to demand
a political outcry of this violence.
The Hindu Students Council's re
sponse should come second to the disturb
ing idea of overarching apathy. Its track
record of responding and its responsibili
ties as a student group is not the main con
cern (although disturbing) — it is our
human empathy that is in question with
blind living that does not condemn the
taking of life in other areas of the world.
And quoting Jacob's eloquent state
ment, "Let us break out of parochial si
lences." I say let us not focus on or con
demn student groups but question an
underlying overall living apathy that
symbolizes the death of humanity and ,
silent support of genoc ide and violence.
Being at Stanford or an institute of high
er learning, one would think that there
would exist a force toward opening our
minds and crossing barriers learned

through various socialization processes.
One would think that this force would
cause us to feel what it is like to lose peo
ple you love and to witness gross atroci
ties. Yet, maybe, as thinking Stanford stu
dents, we have yet to learn a lot about al
lowing ourselves to feel.

Prof. Girard did not in fact call Osama

that we use the term "scapegoat" when we

Anime has been popular at Stanford
for years
We were shocked and appalled by your
cover story on anime. There are two main
points we will address in this letter: the
point about American cartoons and the
point about Anime at Stanford.
First, to say that American cartoons are
directed at kids is dangerous and inaccu
rate. Yourarticlecompletely overlooks the
mature target audience of ingenious
shows like The Tick, Invader Zim, Ren &
Stimpy, South Park and of course, The
Simpsons. These Neilsen-rated classics
have been wowing cartoon oldsters for
years. They are as much a part of Ameri

ca as apple pie and big guns, and as we all
knovv, the appeal of these ideals does not
stop at age 10.
Further, for your article to say that
anime is only beginning to achieve popu
larity at Stanford is patently untrue.
Courses such as "Japanese Pop Culture"
have included anime on their syllabi since
their inceptions, and student groups
across campus have screened such anime
blockbusters as Princess Mononoke.
Years ago when Green Hay went soft,
Anime replaced punk rock as the reason
du jour to color one's hair pink, blue and
a Hurry of other cartoonish colors. The
ASSU Speakers Bureau brought super
star anime mega-hunk Tenshi Muyo as
part of their Distinguished Speaker Se
ries three years ago. And who can forget
when Vampire Hunter 1) ran for Tree?
That crazy stunt when he ate people with
his hand was freaking awesome. Besides,
the Office of Residential Education has
been packing resident assistant positions
with anime characters since the begin
ning of time.
For this article on such an important
topic to have made the front page of The
Daily with so little research reflects poorly

on the quality of so-called "current events"
on this campus.

Bush Administration 'taking advantage'
of Sept. 11 tragedy
White House Press Secretary Ari Fleis
cher denounced calls for an investigation
into the Bush administration's pre-Sept.
11 knowledge of terrorist intent as being
"political." While Fleischer gallantly
points the finger, I would like to not so
gently remind him that the Bush adminis
tration is just as guilty of taking advantage
of our nation's greatest tragedy as he and
Vice President Dick Cheney have so omi
nously accused the Democrats of doing so.
Just as "political" are those who have not
spoken out for or against the administra
tion despite what is in their hearts.
I do not contend that any governmental
or intelligence agency could have had the
capacity to predict the extent of the horror

that struck our country on that day. 1 can
even accept National Security Adviser Con
doleezza Rice's assertion that the warnings
were generalized and that it would have
been irresponsible tor the government to
send the nation into hysterics over insuffi
cient evidence. What I will not tolerate is
the fact that President George W. Bush al
lowed every branch of intelligence to stand
accused of negligence and ineptitude when
his administration suttered the same inabil
ity to play connect-the-dots.
The bottom line is that Sept. 11 was a
godsend to a president and to an adminis
tration that up to that point had only one
foot left in the Oval Office. Bush selfishly
rode the wave of patriotism and allowed
other lifetime government servants' ca
reers and reputations to fall along the way.
Sen. Tom Daschle made a valid assertion
when he questioned why the Bush admin
istration secreted this information for the
last eight months. Sadly, I see our present
revelation as only a symptom of a larger
and more dangerous disease that the Bush
administration suffers. Bush has pointed
fingers and thrown mud at anyone who
questions his authority. However, when
he gets mud in his eye, he puritanically as

serts the power of his office and feigns
shook at those who would dare question
the president.
As a private citizen, I stand to gain
nothing but hate mail from voicing my
opinion. I write not just because I am un
happy with the administration's cover-up,
but because I am angry that it has
stonewalled the public's right to informa
tion in every situation. To this day, we are
not allowed to question the relationship
Enron had with our national energy poli
cy or have access to Ronald Reagan's and
George H. W. Bush's papers. VVe are told
it is unpatriotic to question a wartime
president. If that were true, our country
would still be fighting in Vietnam. We are
good citizens if we nod our heads and
blindly agree to everything Big Brother
says. As soon as we have a contrary opin
ion we are "second-guessing obstruction
ists." Bush and his advisiers have deftly
spun every controversy by leveraging a
judgment about the accuser's level of pa
triotism-and that is the most politically
unpatriotic second-guessing obstruction
of all.

Entire Stanford community must speak
out against killings in Gujarat
Suraj Jacob's column illuminates the
dark and deadly silence of apathy. This
apathy lives on psychological blindness, as
our minds selectively choose which injus
tices we allow to touch our hearts.
Such selectivity makes the difference
between our mind thinking and us verbal
izing, "That's horrible and frightening,"
and forgetting about it the next moment
and us feeling a bloodsucking sick attack
on our hearts. It is an attack whose
wounds manifest itself in fear, grief, em
pathy or can more destructively, manifest
itself in anger, hate, and bigotry. I admire
the life with which Jacob vocalizes the dis
turbing living apathy. I n doing so, he per
petuates the essence of human life, empa
thy and hurnanitarianism.
The recognition of this learned emo
tional blindness — that is, people feeling
more empathy toward their family mem
bers or those of their own gender — is the
frightening essence that is fueling Gu
jarat's fire. It is empathy toward members
of one's own religion, manifesting itself in
violence, overpowering one's empathy to
ward members of the other religion.
This precedence is a disturbing degree
of living apathy — it is an apathy fed by
empathy and a reality that scares me to
death. It is this element of emotional
blindness that creates the mob mentality
and destructive "unity" that leaders of vio
lence manipulate to continue bloody out
rageous conflict.
Not only as a Muslim, but as a human,
I agree with Jacob in condemning any sort
of violence toward that of any group. Yet,
I also realize that this blameworthy apathy
is not a concept that will change overnight,
but voices like Jacob's, forums and outlets
may help steer the path of change.

Unfortunately, in this world, silence
condemns little, it speaks little and pos
sesses a very ambiguous voice. To listen to
silence requires the patience and careful
listening, which most people do not en
gage in.
Like Jacob, I ask people to speak and
respond because peace is a public good
and a benefit to all, and its absence can be
a poison to all.

the "booty" girls at UC-Berkeley in com
parison to the prim-and-perfect girls in
Los Angeles always dressed for the occa
sion, whether it be a night at a hot club or
a trip to the nearest 7-11. Reading your ar
ticle gave me hope to believe that UC-
Berkeley girls aren't at the bottom of the
list after all! Shucks, I guess UC-Berkeley
doesn't always beat Stanford!

Daily misunderstands prof's comments
Your writer Khanh Lai seems to have
completely misunderstood Prof. Rene Gi
rard's answer to a question about terror
ism at the Becoming Human Conference.
Prof. Girard did not in fact call Osama
bin leaden a scapegoat or sacrificial vic tim
— he said precisely the opposite, answer
ing that he would not call bin Laden a
scapegoat. His point earlier in his talk was
that we use the term "scapegoat" when we
refer to an innocent sacrificial victim.

Anime has been popular at Stanford
for years
We were shocked and appalled by your
cover story on anime. There are two main
points we will address in this letter: the
point about American cartoons and the
point about Anime at Stanford.
First, to say that American cartoons are
directed at kids is dangerous and inaccu
rate. Yourarticlecompletely overlooks the
mature target audience of ingenious
shows like The Tick, Invader Zim, Ren &
Stimpy, South Park and of course, The
Simpsons. These Neilsen-rated classics
have been wowing cartoon oldsters for
years. They are as much a part of Ameri

ca as apple pie and big guns, and as we all
knovv, the appeal of these ideals does not
stop at age 10.
Further, for your article to say that
anime is only beginning to achieve popu
larity at Stanford is patently untrue.
Courses such as "Japanese Pop Culture"
have included anime on their syllabi since
their inceptions, and student groups
across campus have screened such anime
blockbusters as Princess Mononoke.
Years ago when Green Hay went soft,
Anime replaced punk rock as the reason
du jour to color one's hair pink, blue and
a Hurry of other cartoonish colors. The
ASSU Speakers Bureau brought super
star anime mega-hunk Tenshi Muyo as
part of their Distinguished Speaker Se
ries three years ago. And who can forget
when Vampire Hunter 1) ran for Tree?
That crazy stunt when he ate people with
his hand was freaking awesome. Besides,
the Office of Residential Education has
been packing resident assistant positions
with anime characters since the begin
ning of time.
For this article on such an important
topic to have made the front page of The
Daily with so little research reflects poorly

on the quality of so-called "current events"
on this campus.

Bush Administration 'taking advantage'
of Sept. 11 tragedy
White House Press Secretary Ari Fleis
cher denounced calls for an investigation
into the Bush administration's pre-Sept.
11 knowledge of terrorist intent as being
"political." While Fleischer gallantly
points the finger, I would like to not so
gently remind him that the Bush adminis
tration is just as guilty of taking advantage
of our nation's greatest tragedy as he and
Vice President Dick Cheney have so omi
nously accused the Democrats of doing so.
Just as "political" are those who have not
spoken out for or against the administra
tion despite what is in their hearts.
I do not contend that any governmental
or intelligence agency could have had the
capacity to predict the extent of the horror

that struck our country on that day. 1 can
even accept National Security Adviser Con
doleezza Rice's assertion that the warnings
were generalized and that it would have
been irresponsible tor the government to
send the nation into hysterics over insuffi
cient evidence. What I will not tolerate is
the fact that President George W. Bush al
lowed every branch of intelligence to stand
accused of negligence and ineptitude when
his administration suttered the same inabil
ity to play connect-the-dots.
The bottom line is that Sept. 11 was a
godsend to a president and to an adminis
tration that up to that point had only one
foot left in the Oval Office. Bush selfishly
rode the wave of patriotism and allowed
other lifetime government servants' ca
reers and reputations to fall along the way.
Sen. Tom Daschle made a valid assertion
when he questioned why the Bush admin
istration secreted this information for the
last eight months. Sadly, I see our present
revelation as only a symptom of a larger
and more dangerous disease that the Bush
administration suffers. Bush has pointed
fingers and thrown mud at anyone who
questions his authority. However, when
he gets mud in his eye, he puritanically as

serts the power of his office and feigns
shook at those who would dare question
the president.
As a private citizen, I stand to gain
nothing but hate mail from voicing my
opinion. I write not just because I am un
happy with the administration's cover-up,
but because I am angry that it has
stonewalled the public's right to informa
tion in every situation. To this day, we are
not allowed to question the relationship
Enron had with our national energy poli
cy or have access to Ronald Reagan's and
George H. W. Bush's papers. VVe are told
it is unpatriotic to question a wartime
president. If that were true, our country
would still be fighting in Vietnam. We are
good citizens if we nod our heads and
blindly agree to everything Big Brother
says. As soon as we have a contrary opin
ion we are "second-guessing obstruction
ists." Bush and his advisiers have deftly
spun every controversy by leveraging a
judgment about the accuser's level of pa
triotism-and that is the most politically
unpatriotic second-guessing obstruction
of all.
