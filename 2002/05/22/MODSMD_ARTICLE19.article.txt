# Weightlifting: more than late-night entertainment
## 
### TERRY HURLBUTT STAFF COLUMNIST 
Weightlifting competitions have
entertained me on many insomni
ac nights thanks to the late-night
sedatives of cable TV.
However, during all that time of
watching men and women squat
and grunt and sweat I never knew
Stanford had its own contingent of
individuals doing the same.
In fact, Stanford's program is
relatively new, having been initiat
ed by Physics graduate student Joe
Matteo only this spring. %

Matteo noticed
that many other
collegiate schools,
especially Sacra
mento State and
Chico State, boast
strong programs
and figured there
was no reason that
Stanford couldn't

put together a team of its own from
the talent he saw in the weight
rooms. The group is currently reg
istered as a student-run club with
15 members, but hopes to expand
next year.

While small in numbers, the
team is not lacking in size, as Mat
teo, who competes in both Olympic
lifting and power lifting, can squat
more than 660 pounds.
While 1 have certainly never
squatted anything in my life and
find that number frighteningly im
pressive in itself, there's actually
more to it than sheer weight.
Olympic lifting and power lift
ing, to a lesser extent, also require
technique and speed. It's not
enough to heft a ridiculous mass
— you actually have to impress
the judges sitting nearby with how

quickly you can raise that bar and
how deeply you squat, among
other things.
In a power-lifting competition,
the contenders are divided into
t heir appropriate classes and make
three lifts. The final score is a cu
mulative score based largely on (he
weight they lift in each round.
While all this might appear
daunting (actually, it Hat out is
daunting), the team is ready and
willing to help you start out on your
training regime.

Most lifters have substantial ex
perience and the coaching staff in
cludes a couple of "Strong Man"
competition lifters — you know,
the guys who throw logs and drag
trucks around muddy fields.
The coaching staff will help you
work out a schedule appropriate
to your weight, gender, and coin
petition. Most of the training is
done on your own, though the
team meets on Saturday morn
ings in the gym in the Arrillaga
Family Sports Center to get advice
and make adjustments.
Dana Mauriello, one of the few
women on the squad, began com
petitive lifting only this past winter,
but managed to place first in her di
vision at the California State Cham
pionships held earlier this spring.
She was working out in Arrilla
ga as usual when she decided to
get advice from the team's coach
who promptly recruited her to
the team.
The simplicity of the sport ap

pealed to her. She got last results
and a stronger body.
As a self-described "beginner"
she's already won a major competi
tion and can squat an impressive
200 pounds.
Fellow teammate Chuck
Booten also finished first in his
clasS at Napa — his first competi
tion ever — while Matteo placed
fourth in his division.
These finishes were good
enough to earn a Junior
Nationals invite and Matteo a
spot in the Men's Open Nation
als while their teammates close
in on national-qualifying num
bers themselves.
The team is eager for recruits
and hopes to take its talent on the
road next year competing in some
of the nation's bigger meets.
Who knows, those same people
I shoot furious glares at in the gym
for making my own 40-pound free
weights look ridiculous in compar
ison, might soon be keeping me
company at 3 a.m. on some cable
sports show.
