# Weightlifting: more than late-night entertainment
## 
### TERRY HURLBUTT STAFF COLUMNIST 
Weightlifting competitions have
entertained me on many insomni
ac nights thanks to the late-night
sedatives of cable TV.
However, during all that time of
watching men and women squat
and grunt and sweat I never knew
Stanford had its own contingent of
individuals doing the same.
In fact, Stanford's program is
relatively new, having been initiat
ed by Physics graduate student Joe
Matteo only this spring. %

Matteo noticed
that many other
collegiate schools,
especially Sacra
mento State and
Chico State, boast
strong programs
and figured there
was no reason that
Stanford couldn't

put together a team of its own from
the talent he saw in the weight
rooms. The group is currently reg
istered as a student-run club with
15 members, but hopes to expand
next year.

While small in numbers, the
team is not lacking in size, as Mat
teo, who competes in both Olympic
lifting and power lifting, can squat
more than 660 pounds.
While 1 have certainly never
squatted anything in my life and
find that number frighteningly im
pressive in itself, there's actually
more to it than sheer weight.
Olympic lifting and power lift
ing, to a lesser extent, also require
technique and speed. It's not
enough to heft a ridiculous mass
â€” you actually have to impress
the judges sitting nearby with how

quickly you can raise that bar and
how deeply you squat, among
other things.
In a power-lifting competition,
the contenders are divided into
t heir appropriate classes and make
three lifts. The final score is a cu
mulative score based largely on (he
weight they lift in each round.
While all this might appear
daunting (actually, it Hat out is
daunting), the team is ready and
willing to help you start out on your
training regime.
