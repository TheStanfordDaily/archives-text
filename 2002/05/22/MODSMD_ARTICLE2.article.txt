# Un-Career Fair offers alternative options
## Workshops on massage, sewing and urban foraging teach students to 'think about their desires'

Looking for the next fair to present your
neatly typed and carefully crafted resume?
Don't apply at this week's first annual Un-Ca
reer Fair — a series of events that began Fri
day. Organizers say the fair was designed to gel
students questioning their potential careers
and evaluating the other choices they make as
they graduate from Stanford.
The program began in White Plaza last
week with a celebration of what those involved
called "life, friendship and food," during the
Career Development Center's "Resumania
Plus," a more traditional career fair.
David Martinez, a freshman involved in
the fair, said that student planners "stressed
the idea that engaging in the world and being
passionate should be the focus of people's
lives, not a spreadsheet for the next 50 years
of financial planning. I don't want to have a

weak body
and wasted
mind fester
ing in the im
mobility of a
stilling 'ca
reer,'" Mar
tinez said.
The idea
for the fair
started when

a group of friends who had passed by numer
ous career fairs over the years realized that
there was only one message presented to the
students about what they could do with their
lives.
Senior Galen Weston, who helped organize
the event, said Stanford students lacked other
choices when considering their futures.
"We thought that instead of focusing on
high-paying jobs that may be unfulfilling, peo
ple should think about their desires," Weston
said. "We wanted to challenge the corporate
mindset that says you must live a certain way,
so we created workshops that presented an al
ternative, more sustainable way of fulfilling our
desires. The act of taking care of ourselves can
be very satisfying in itself — both physically
and emotionally."
Last week at .Synergy, junior Martha

Roberts led a workshop on a basic skill that
many Stanford students know next to nothing
about: sewing. Having taught herself to sew in
high school, Roberts showed students how to
patch and modify clothes that had been pur
chased at thrift shops.
"Most Stanford students don't even know
how to sew on a button," said Roberts. "1
wanted to show students that you don't have
to buy everything — that it's not always
about what you can buy. 1 wanted to teach
people how to make good clothes that look ac
ceptable so that they don't have to rely on so
much consumption."
One of the important themes of the fair is a
focus on building strong, tightly-knit commu
nities of people working together. The fair's
workshops are based on the idea that people
can teach their skills to others, creating a com
munity in which friends can share ideas and
useful skills.
" Today's jobs are mostly individualistic,"
explained Weston. "People take off to far cor
ners of the world to pursue their jobs, leaving
their community behind. We're trying to
make people realize how important it is to
build a community while taking care of our
selves at the same time. To me, having good
friends makes me happier than finding some
high-paying job."
