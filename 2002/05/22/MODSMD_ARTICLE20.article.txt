An NCAA championship, the ultimate
in collegiate athletic recognition, is diffi
cult to attain by any measure. However,
it's easy to forget t his when looking at the
legacy of the men's tennis program,
which over the years has accumulated 13
singles and 13 doubles titles.
When added to the 17 team cham
pionships Stanford has earned over
the years, these 26 trophies testify to
the skill and persistence of Stanford
Athletics, the men's tennis team and
head coach Dick Gould.
This week, Stanford shoots for an un
precedented 27th and 28th titles as it
travels to Texas A&M for the NCAA In
dividual Championships. The tourna
ment, held May 22 to May 27, marks the
culmination of the season and selects the
elite from the top echelons of the colle
giate tennis world.
"The whole year's work is put into
getting to this stage," said sophomore
Joe Kao. "The guys are ready to play."
