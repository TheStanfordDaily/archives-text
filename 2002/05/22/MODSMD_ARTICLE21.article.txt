# Learning to treasure the other football

### BRETT KAUFMAN STAFF COLUMNIST 
The strangest thing just hap
pened. I sat down to think of
possible topics for this week's
column, and suddenly it came to
me: Soccer.
1 know, I know. Soccer?
Nine months ago, before I spent
a semester in Spain, in my eyes soc -
cer was the sporting equivalent of
marbles. I was a true-blooded
American sports fan, and I followed
four sports plus a horse race here

r i
and there. That
was about it.
But right now,
I'm honestly ex
cited about that
slow and boring
game that they
love across the
pond. 1 wish I
could call it "foot-

ball" in a sophisticated British ac
cent, but slow down.
I'm not that excited.
The World Cup — the sport
ing event that captivates the entire
globe more than even the
Olympics once every four years
— is almost upon us. Nine days
from now, defending champion
France will face off with Senegal to
begin the greatest soccer tourna
ment known to man, and it won't
even dominate Sports Center.
We don't care about soccer
here in America. We've got too
much other stuff to fill our sports
void, like approximately 1 12 days
of NBA playoffs and daily doses of
"MLB Labor Battle 2002."
Clearly we don't have time for
something as silly as the World
Cup. 1 mean, you can t even use
your hands.
That pretty much disqualifies
it as a major sport, right?
Throw it on Fox Sports World
with handball and darts. That's
where it belongs.
But go to Europe, just go to
one match, and you'll change
your mind.
II it could happen to me, trust
me, it will happen to you. Fake
one step inside a stadium like
Madrid's Santiago Bernebeu
and you'll never make a soccer
joke again.
Aside from everything that soc
cer brings on the field — incred
ible athletes, grace and cadence,
teamwork and on-field genius —
it's the fans that make soccer so
exciting. Everyone — not here,
but there — cares. Everyone.
And they really care, not in a Yan
kees "oh well, we'll buy one next
year" kind of way.
Every matchday is like an

NFL playoff game, with streets
packed full of rowdy fans
singing and drinking their fair
share up until kickoff.
At every moment in the game,
you'll hear a chill-inspiring
chant or sec a Hare spewing out
of I he stands.
I've been to playoff games at
Wrigley Field (a Jwice-a-decadc
phenomenon), Nil. opening day
at the Metrodome (where those
cheaters pump in crowd noise),
and two College World Series
championship games (in front of
the best baseball fans anywhere).
I'll take the atmosphere for al
most any league soccer match in
Europe over those any day.
Not the game itself, but the
buzz. It's palpable, almost suffo
cating — just flat-out awesome.
And that's why I'm hooked.
That's why I'll be watching every
minute of the World Cup.
They've got me. I'm in.
If the entire world can care
about something so much, it's got
to be pretty special.
I he other day, a friend of
mine asked me who I would
root for if Spain played the
United States in the World Cup.
It took about three seconds for
me to decide.
At the risk of sounding like
Bill Maher, my answer, of
course, was Spain.
The reason is simple — they
care, we don't. To win games in
the World Cup means something
culturally to most people around
the world.
Their soccer team is a source
of pride for their nation, a facto
ry for their heroes, a testament
to their society. Here, our soccer
team is an afterthought, a joke,
a trend.
Maybe it's because we're not
the best. A British friend of mine
likes to say, "You Yankees
couldn't beat anyone at football,
so you came up with all those
other mindless sports."
He may not be far off.
We can't dominate soccer, so
we let it slip off our collective
radar and pump our attention
into Dream Teams that make ns
feel good about ourselves by beat
ing up on a team of 5-foot-5 Chi
nese students.
The World Cup is the world's
time to turn the tables. This is
what they live for. And for the
next month, so will I.

Brett Kaufman is a junior with a dou
ble major in international relations
and Spanish, do to Sunken Diamond
this weekend. I repeat, do to Sunken
Diamond this weekend.

NFL playoff game, with streets
packed full of rowdy fans
singing and drinking their fair
share up until kickoff.
At every moment in the game,
you'll hear a chill-inspiring
chant or sec a Hare spewing out
of I he stands.
I've been to playoff games at
Wrigley Field (a Jwice-a-decadc
phenomenon), Nil. opening day
at the Metrodome (where those
cheaters pump in crowd noise),
and two College World Series
championship games (in front of
the best baseball fans anywhere).
I'll take the atmosphere for al
most any league soccer match in
Europe over those any day.
Not the game itself, but the
buzz. It's palpable, almost suffo
cating — just flat-out awesome.
And that's why I'm hooked.
That's why I'll be watching every
minute of the World Cup.
They've got me. I'm in.
If the entire world can care
about something so much, it's got
to be pretty special.
I he other day, a friend of
mine asked me who I would
root for if Spain played the
United States in the World Cup.
It took about three seconds for
me to decide.
At the risk of sounding like
Bill Maher, my answer, of
course, was Spain.
The reason is simple — they
care, we don't. To win games in
the World Cup means something
culturally to most people around
the world.
Their soccer team is a source
of pride for their nation, a facto
ry for their heroes, a testament
to their society. Here, our soccer
team is an afterthought, a joke,
a trend.
Maybe it's because we're not
the best. A British friend of mine
likes to say, "You Yankees
couldn't beat anyone at football,
so you came up with all those
other mindless sports."
He may not be far off.
We can't dominate soccer, so
we let it slip off our collective
radar and pump our attention
into Dream Teams that make ns
feel good about ourselves by beat
ing up on a team of 5-foot-5 Chi
nese students.
The World Cup is the world's
time to turn the tables. This is
what they live for. And for the
next month, so will I.

Diamond this weekend.
