# Some unhappy with new Axess
## Officials agree that the system is still not fully functional 
### ALEX BLEYLEBEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Much to the ire of many stu
dents who tried to log into Axess
last Sunday — the deadline for
changing Draw preferences —
the housing section of the pro
gram was unavailable for most of
t he day.
With last Sunday's outage and
other recent disruptions of Axess,
many in the Stanford community
have been left wondering why a
school among the technological
elite is unable to reliably provide
this integral service.
Students use Axess to check
grades, enroll in classes and veri
fy housing information, and have
often witnessed only sporadic
availability during peak usage.
"It's a sad day when the weak
est link of the campus that in
vented the Internet is its comput
er network," said freshman Rob
Boyle.
University officials attribute
many of the recent problems with
Axess to the upgrading of the
software, which has been phased
in over the last three years. The

program to create a new version
of Axess, dubbed "Axess 2000,"
was mostly completed by Febru
ary of this year. However it lias
had some growing pains in the
first few months of its use, ac
cording to University officials.
"There are lots of things we
need to do to make Axess a sta
ble, fully functional system," said
University Registrar Roger
Printup. "The first year of [im
plementing] any software is
going to be a little bit rough, and
we've had our share of that.
Going forward, assuming we've
learned our lessons, next year
should be infinitely better than
this year."
Nancy Ware, the executive di
rector of administrative systems
for the Information Technology
Systems and Services Depart
ment, agreed.
"This is really our first year in
operation with the new product,"
she said. "Of course we know that
there are things we can do [to]
make things better, but we have
certainly also seen some service
upgrades."
One of these service upgrades
lias been an approximate 15-fold
increase in the capacity of the
server. The old version of Axess
could usually accommodate 40 si
multaneous users, with occasion
al boosts to 80 users as deadlines

approached. Axess 2000 is de
signed to accommodate 600 peo
ple logged in simultaneously.
However, according to Print
up, the system has had difficulties
with numbers below the 600
mark during its first months in
action, with many instances of
users being kicked off the server
in the middle of a session.
Many students remain skepti
cal about the new system, even
when looking beyond its initial
implementation problems.
"Most people I've talked to
don't really like it, and from that
I get the feeling that something's
wrong," said freshman Austin
Shoemaker, an applications soft
ware engineer for Apple Com
puter. "I don't particularly like it
either, so I'm just trying to look at
ways that it can be made better.
You ought to think about the
people who are using it, not just
the results it provides or whether
it functions according to specifi
cations."
Shoemaker, who is working
on a program that will simplify
class searches and scheduling
through an ASSU Web site,
points to user friendliness as one
key area that could potentially be
improved.
