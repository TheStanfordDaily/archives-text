### CYNTHIA CHO EDITORIAL STAFF 
While seniors have a million things on
their minds during their last few weeks at
Stanford, those coordinating the annual Se
nior Gift and Pledge campaign hope donat
ing money will be one of them. The c am
paign raises money for the Stanford Fund
for Undergraduate Education.
"The Senior Gift and Pledge campaign is
an annual campaign led by members of the
senior class in their first class-based effort to
raise money for the Stanford Fund," said
Charles Schoonover, the program coordi
nator of student development. "It marks
the beginning of a lifetime of giving back to
Stanford in order to ensure similar oppor
tunities to the Stanford undergraduates of
today and tomorrow."
All of the money raised through the cam
paign goes to the Stanford Fund and gilts to
the fund are equally split between under
graduate financial aid and academic and

funding for extracurricular groups and
programs. Freshman / Sophomore Semi
nars and Sophomore College are two pro
grams thai benefit from the Stanford Fund.
"We encourage graduating seniors [and
others who associate themselves with the
Class of 2002 J to make a contribution of at
least $20," said senior Pei-pei I Jn, one of five
campaign chairs.
This year, every gift of $20 or more is
matched two-to-one by alumnus Peter Bing
and one-to-one by the Parent's Advisory
Board.
"So each $20 gift is really $80. And each
gift does make a difference," Lin said.
Furthermore, for every 15 gifts over
$100, an anonymous donor will give an ad
ditional $5,000 to the campaign.
Those who do not contribute this year
can make a pledge.
"Making a pledge is a way of saying that
you are going to give next year. I he advan
tage of making a pledge is that the money
still gets matched. Bing will give $ 1.000 for

every 10 pledges we receive," said senior
Patrick Crosetlo, another campaign chair.
"Pledges are important because if estab
lishes an annual pattern of giving back to
Stanford for graduates," Crosetto said.
However, Crosetto explained that if a
graduate's financial situation worsens con
siderably in the next year, he is not forced to
give.
This year, the campaign chairs have cre
ated a new incentive, called the "Freshman
Dorm (Competition." Seniors have been clas
sified according to the dormitory they lived
in during their freshman year. The fresh
man dorm with the highest percentage of
gifts over $20 will win a barbecue reunion in
|une. I here will be one all-frosh dorm win
ner and one four-class dorm winner.
Currently, Junipero is leading the all
frosh category, with Rinconada, Paloma
and Larkin close behind. In the four-class
category, Roble and francos are tied for

At this point, 27 percent of grad
uating seniors and affiliates of the
class have contributed to the cam
paign, which is slightly higher than
last year's total at this time. Last
year's campaign raised a total of
$80,700, including the matches.
"We hope that our momentum
continues to grow, as seniors real
ize that this campaign really does
make a difference," Schoonover
said.
"The great part of the campaign
is that the money raised goes di
rectly towards undergraduate edu
cation. It's important that stu

dents realize that this is not an en
dowment builder," he added.
Seniors have been contacted by
mail and e-mail about giving to the
campaign. Also, the Stanford Stu
dent Calling Program has been
contacting the seniors who have
not yet given.
"We're also in the process of
going door-to-door to visit every
single senior and tell them about
Senior Gift and Pledge by the end
of the year," Crosetto said.
The campaign chairs will be in
White Plaza every day during
lunch to answer questions and col
lect gifts. While supplies last, se
niors who give will receive an en
graved (Mass 0f2002 key chain.
The campaign will continue
until graduation. Gifts can also be
made online or by mailing or call
ing the Stanford Fund.
