Charges reinstated
against shoe thief
OROVILLE, Calif. (AP) — A man facing a life in
prison for allegedly stealing two pairs of shoes from
a Chico fraternity house will not have a "three
strikes" burglary charge against him thrown out.
A Butte County Superior Court judge said Mon
day that Johnny Estes will go to trial July 17.
It will be the second time that the man goes to trial
on virtually the same evidence. Estes was serving a
42-year-to-life sentence under the three-strikes law
when his 1998 Butte County burglary conviction was
overturned on legal grounds nearly two years ago.
Estes is accused of taking the shoes from theTao
Gamma Theta fraternity house on Christmas Day,
1997.
Estes has a total of six prior strikes on his record
for kidnapping and robbery when he was much
younger. Conviction of any additional violent or "se
rious" felony, including residential burglary, would
carry an automatic life prison term.

Cool economy alleviates
local substitute-teacher
shortage
SAN JOSE (AP) — The dot-com meltdown has
led many engineers and other high-tech workers to
head back to school — as substitute teachers — wip
ing out a severe shortage of subs in Silicon Valley but
leaving experts worried an improving economy may
lead to renewed teacher shortages.
The influx of the unemployed tech workers has
allowed school districts to reinstate eligibility re
quirements that had been waived in recent years as
schools searched for substitute teachers, the San Jose
Mercury News reported. In many cases, the new
subs bring advanced degrees and years of work ex
perience to classrooms.
Paul Amnion, a professor in the graduate school
of education at the University of California, Berke
ley, said putting laid-off tech workers in the class
room can be dangerous.
"If this turns out to be a revolving door where
people try it fora year or two and decide they don't
like it, then the school is back to hiring someone who
may not be well-prepared to teach," Amnion said. "It
seems like there should be much more of an effort to
retain people in the system."

Superior Court judge on Monday upheld two of
four felony counts against the San Francisco woman
