On May 22, 1956, The Daily printed an article
about an impregnated frog.
"Female frogs lay eggs.
"Six Stanford men c an attest to this fact.
"Last Friday night Rick Ruud, Steve Brown,
Jim Kleerup, Mamie Hurt, Rick Morehouse antl
Chuck Pilgrim realized that Stanford, so ably
represented by Jack Squat and Dean Wiggler in
last year's 28th annual frog leaping contest, was
not entered for the event the following clay.
"So they went to Lake Lagunita and managed
to corral three of the amphibious creatures.
"The next clay dawned bright and full of hope
for the three Stanford stablemates. But on the
way to Angels Camp in Calaveras County two of
the contestants became unable to compete.
"So all of the Farm's hope lay on one lonely
bug eyed monster.
"Hundreds were watching with breathless an
ticipation as the Stanford entry squirmed ner
vously before making its crucial leap from the
center of the circle. The world record up to then
stood at 16 feet 10 inches.
"Then it happened. Stanford's pride and joy
lay a half a dozen eggs right on the spot. She
gamely jumped away. But frog eggs are slippery
and the potential mother only cleared 2.9 feet.
"The jumping contest was taken by a frog
owned by al2 year old Oakland boy. The cham
pion leaped to 15.9 feet. The collegiate division
was won by a California entry.
"Stanford's she-frog's leap fell way below last
year's prize entry Jack Squat, who cleared 10 feet
and 2.5 inches.
"In order to assure continued amateur status
of their frogs, the owners divorced from the AAU
and formed the AAA, the Association for Am
phibious Amateurs.
"That Wes Santee incident brought our dis
trust of the AAU,' declared one owner.
"At last contact it was not decided whether egg
laying athletes would be eligible."
Bottom line:The froa pimps of the new millennium are
out of luck, because last time Page 2 ventured to Lake La
aunita, all it found was old KA furniture, mud and con
fused tourists.
