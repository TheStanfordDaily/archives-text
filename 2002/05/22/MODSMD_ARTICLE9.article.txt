w w Construction is looking good on
what will undisputedly be Stanford's most
environmentally sound building, but there's
one issue that project director Philippe
Cohen can't seem to tackle: the lights.
"You know what drives me nuts about
some people," a frustrated Mr. Cohen asks
as he peers into a fluorescent-lit classroom
in the building hidden in the Bay Area's
hills. "They never turn lights off."
Cohen, director of Stanford's Jasper
Ridge Biological Preserve, is overseeing
construction of its first permanent build
ing, a $ 3.2 million center that will host
classrooms, laboratory space, and offices.
