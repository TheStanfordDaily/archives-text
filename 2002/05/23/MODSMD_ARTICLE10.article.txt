Security inadequate in
county courthouses
REDWOOD CUT, Calif. (AP) â€”A San Mateo
County grand jury reported Monday it found secu
rity lapses or inadequacies at all four county court
houses, including a case in which a baby stroller
filled with packages passed through a security
checkpoint without inspection.
The grand jury report said security was satisfac
tory at both San Carlos and Half Moon Bay court
houses. But it said the courthouse security Haws in
cluded incidents in which two handguns passed
without detection.
Some attorneys who do not work for the county
have full-time access to the courthouse in Redwood
City, the grand jurors found, a privilege not en
joyed by most county employees.
"It was just this sort of special treatment that en
abled Dan White to enter the San Francisco City
Hall with a gun and assassinate Mayor George
Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk (in 1978),"
said grand jury foreman Bruce Hasenkamp.
