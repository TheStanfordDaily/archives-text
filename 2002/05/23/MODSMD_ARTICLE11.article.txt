1960
On May 23, 1960, The Daily printed an arti
cle about a speech by the Indonesian business
minister.
"Justice and prosperity for the whole nation is the
aim of the social revolution in Indonesia, according
to Dr. R. Soeharto, Minister of People's Industries of
the Republic of Indonesia.
"Soeharto spoke to members of the Internation
al Business Club and interested Business School stu
dents Friday afternoon during his day-long visit to
Stanford.
"Indonesian government is seeking to accom
plish its aim through a policy of driving and guiding
the country's economy. "I hat means, simply, that we
have rejected the idea of a liberal or laissez faire
economy,' he said.
"To clarify his point further, Soeharto added that
there is perhaps no free country in the world in
which liberal economy or where classical patterns of
capitalism are still used. /Ml states have found it nec
essary to devise and use some controls over its free
functioning economy.
"'lt is our conviction that, in the present world
picture, capitalization and capital growth are too se
rious a matter to be left to capitalists,' he added.
"Soeharto denied the fact that Indonesia can be
compared to the United States a 100 years ago. He
pointed out that there is no land hunger or capital
looking for investment in his country. The basis
upon which they must build is a large supply of labor
unequally distributed over the country's 7,900 is
lands and an abundance of natural resources.
"The guidance of industry in Indonesia is divid
ed into two ministries â€” People's Industries and
Basic Industries.
"Basic industry, including mining, is state enter
prise, or at least there is state intervention. Industries
too costly, too large, and which are necessary before
small private industries can flourish fall into this cate
gory. State intervention is involved in all aspects of
basic industry.
"People's Industries are home, and small scale
"basic" industry employing less than 300 workers.
They are mainly engaged in producing consumer
goods.

Bottom Line: Although Stanford is still on the "Left Coast,"
surely the campus would be outraged if such Communist
propaganda as propagated by the aforementioned minister
was brought to the Farm today. [Note: Page 2 has been co
opted by Republicans, apparently.]
