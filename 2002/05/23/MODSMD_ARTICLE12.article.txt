# Chandra Levy's remains found in park

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —The remains of
Chandra Levy were found in a Washington
park yesterday, ending an agonizing 13-month
search for the federal intern whose disappear
ance riveted the nation and costa congressman
his career.
Police said they still had no idea how Levy
died.
A man walking his dog and looking for tur
tles in Rock Creek Park found a skull and other
bones, Police Chief Charles H. Ramsey said.
The medical examiner used dental records to
confirm the remains were Levy's.
The 1,754-acre park had been scoured by
police before, to no avail.
Her ballling disappearance had gripped the
nation for months— until last Sept. 11 —and
led to the political demise of her hometown con
gressman, Rep. Gary Condit, D-Calif.
Condit denied having anything to do with
the disappearance but lie acknowledged to in
vestigators that he had an affair with her, a po
lice source said. Condit lost the Democratic pri
mary in his district and is in his final months as
a congressman.
He said yesterday in a statement issued by his
attorney: "Congressman Gary Condit and his
family want to express their heartfelt sorrow
and condolences to the Levy family. The Levy
family will remain in our prayers."
In a late-afternoon news conference, Police
Chief Ramsey said simply, "The remains found
earlier today are in fact Chandra Levy."

The identification did not end the mystery.
Ramsey said the medical examiner was working
to determine the manner and cause of Levy's
death.
He said the case was now a death investiga
tion but stopped short of calling it a criminal
case, pending word about how she died.
Levy, 24, of Modesto, Calif., disappeared
sometime after logging off her computer about
1 p.m. on May 1, 2001. When police searched
her apartment they found her wallet, credit
card, computer and cell phone. Only her keys
were missing.
Police searched intensively as national inter
est increased but turned up no solid clues. They
looked at a variety of theories — murder, sui
cide or that Levy had gone into hiding or lost
her memory.
\ hey questioned (londit several times but re
peatedly said the 54-year-old, married lawmak
er was not a suspect.
Police had found evidence last year on Levy's
laptop computer that she had searched a Web
site for the park's Klingle Mansion on the day
she vanished.
Yesterday, bones, a jogging bra, tennis shoes
and other items were found about a mile north
of the mansion and about four miles away from
Levy's apartment. Friends had said she fre
quented the park, located in northwest Wash
ington.
Levy came to Washington for an internship
with the Bureau of Prisons. In late April 2001,

her internship was abruptly cut short when su
pervisors learned she was ineligible to continue
because she had finished her college course
work the previous December.
A sociable, earnest student who enjoyed trav
el abroad with her family and staying lit, I,evy
was last seen April 30 when she canceled her
membership at a health club near her apart
ment.
She had been preparing to return to Califor
nia for graduation from the University of
Southern California and sent her parents, Dr.
Robert and Susan Levy, an e-mail on May 1 not
ing airfares for the trip home.
The Levys called police five days later when
they could not reach her, and her father also
telephoned Condit asking for his help.
Condit called Levy a good Iriend and estab
lished a reward fund to help find her. In July, he
reportedly told police he was having an affair,
though publicly he never made such a disclosure,
saying only they shared a close relationship.
Condit, abandoned by all but a few Democ
ratic allies, lost the Democratic primary in
March to former protege Dennis Cardoza, a
state assembly man.
After her disappearance, police searched
Condit's apartment with his consent and ob
tained a DN A sample from him. Condit submit
ted to a lie detector test arranged by his lawyer,
who said the congressman was found to be
truthful when denying any knowledge about
what happened to Levy.
