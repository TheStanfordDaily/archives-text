# Ex-Klansman guilty of 1963 bombing
## 
### 
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) —
Closing the books on the deadliest
crime of the civil rights era, a jury
convicted an aging former Klans
man of murder yesterday for the
1963 church bombing that killed
four black girls and shook the na
tion's soul.
The verdict, reached by a racial
ly mixed jury in less than seven
hours of deliberation, brought
tears from relatives on both sides
and a statement of defiance from
the 71-year-old defendant, Bobby
Frank Cherry. He was automati
cally sentenced to spend the rest of
his life in prison.
Asked by the judge if he had any
comment, Cherry stood and point-

Ed directly at prosecutors.
"This whole bunch lied all the
way through this thing," he said,
his Southern drawl steady and
clear in the courtroom. "I told the
truth. I don't know why I'm going
to jail for nothing."
The echoes of the bomb blast at
the Sixteeenth Street Baptist
Church rippled through four
decades of race relations and haunt
ed those who despaired of ever
bringing the girls' killers to justice.
The murder of young girls
gathering at church for worship
also exposed the chilling depth of
racial hatred that black protesters
faced in the Deep South and
helped bring racial moderates off

the sidelines in the civil rights
struggle. Within two years, as
protests spread in the wake of the
bombing, federal civil rights and
voting rights laws were passed by
(Congress.
Cherry will be the last suspect
tried in the blast. Two other ex
Klansmen were convicted earlier
and sent to prison and a fourth sus
pect died without being charged.
The jury of nine whites and
three blacks returned the verdict
after a weeklong trial that was
filled with images from the na
tion's segregationist past, witnesses
with admittedly faded memories
but only circumstantial evidence
against Cherry.
