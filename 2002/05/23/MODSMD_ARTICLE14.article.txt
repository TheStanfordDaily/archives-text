## The 						Stanford Daily Non-partisan investigation of Sept. 11 necessary 
### 
Published Since 1891

U.S. Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle called yesterday for the
creation of an independent com
mission to investigate the federal
government actions before the Sept. 11 ter
rorist attacks. We second his call.
The U.S. government should make every ef
fort to discover the weak links in its intelligence
network and to improve the coordination and
information sharing among intelligence agen
cies, the White House and Congress. A thor
ough, non-partisan investigation could help bet
ter equip the United States to conduct its current
campaign against terrorism and to meet the new
security challenges of the 21 st century.
Washington, D.C. has been abuzz with
rumor and accusation over the last 10 days fol
lowing news reports that President George W.
Bush received an intelligence briefing about
possible al Qaeda plane hijackings a full month
before the September attacks. Some of the
questions recently raised in public by Con

gressmen and others regarding the president's
knowledge and his response to information
given him smack of political gamesmanship.
"What did the president know and when did
he know it," is a silly question that implies Bush
— or his administration — is somehow to blame
for the death of 3,000 Americans. In fact, the
Bush administration apparendy took a number
of reasonable security precautions based on what
was a generalized threat. A better question to ask
is the one posed by Daschle: what breakdowns
happened before Sept. 11, and how can we be
better prepared in the future?
An independent commission could help an
swer this question, much like other commis
sions helped answer questions about the sur
prise attack on Pearl Harbor. While there were
at least eight government investigations into
the intelligence and military failings behind
Dec. 7, 1941, the joint Congressional probe
provides a particularly useful model. Begun
soon after war was declared, the commission

did not issue a final report until 1946.
While we do not envision a Sept. 11 com
mission taking four or five years to report, a
good investigative body will take its time, and
not be bound by political agendas or election
year timetables.
Further, the commission should be non-par
tisan. In addition to the members of Congress
drawn from both parties, perhaps Bush should
appoint one or more members of the panel. In
cluding security experts from the private sector
or academia, such as Political Science prof. Coit
Blacker, might also be wise.
The commission should investigate the im
mediate circumstances and missed clues that
led up to Sept. 11, like the more-or-less ig
nored July 2001 memo from an FBI agent in
Phoenix urging that U.S. flight schools be
scoured for al Qaeda terrorists. Probing recent
intelligence lapses may well bring commission
members around to considering the overall
state of the country's intelligence agencies,

which many experts have claimed are under
funded, under-staffed and under-supported
on Capitol Hill.
While they are at it, the commission also
ought to take a look at the information gathered
under previous administrations and their policy
responses to it. Bush's Aug. 6 briefing is report
ed to have contained only a general warning
about possible plane hijackings. But President
Bill Clinton was told in 1999 that A1 Qaeda ter
rorists might try to use hijacked planes as mis
siles, flying them into buildings or landmarks.
What steps he took in response, and whether this
information was shared with the current admin
istration, is worth knowing.
The nation would benefit from a full, objec
tive investigation into the worst domestic at
tack in 60 years. We hope the president will
support an independent commission. Its
work, if properly pursued, would only make
Americans safer, wiser and better prepared to
face the future.
