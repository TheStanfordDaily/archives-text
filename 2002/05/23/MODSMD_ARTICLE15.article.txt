# CANNONBALL COMING
## A 						week in pop culture... 
### 
Kevin Harlan might be the best
sports announcer in the history
of the business. If nothing else,
he's the most memorable.
In one late-season Lakers game, as
TNT showed a replay of Kobe Bryant at
tacking the hoop from the baseline, Har
lan punctuated the slow-motion slam by
emphatically saying, "Feel the torque.
See the detonation. Kobe Bryant."
Then, during Monday's fluke loss to
the Sacramento Queens of Flopping,
Harlan narrated a particularly thunder
ous offering from the Big Cham
berneezy himself, Shaquille O'Neal, by
exclaiming that the Diesel "has no re
gard for human life inside."
That's funny stuff. Funny enough to
make me spit out a mouthful of flat, day-

old St. Ide's Special
Brew. . . .
Just like a review of
"Star Wars" I read the
other day online.
Now, I hated the
movie. Overly serious
and plodding, it was..
But, my boy Bob Smit
liouser of the Fvangeli-

cal Christian magazine "Family" had
more spec ific qualms. Particularly the
lack of proper adult supervision sur
rounding Anakin Skywalker, who Smit
houser called "an intergalactic James
Dean—Top Gun's Maverick with a
stnoldering self-importance."
1 Ie complains that "Anakin is assigned
to security detail as the lone protector of
Amidala, which adds up to two un-chap
eroned adolescents bouncing around
the cosmos and sharing a secluded villa
(they couldn't have sent a droid along?)"
hobby. 21st century. Catch the fever
of openness and experimentation. Like
Abercrombie & Fitch. . . .
Fresh off of getting in trouble for pro
ducing a batch of racist t-shirts, Aber
crombie decided to get into a less contro
versial business: kiddie porn. It appears
everyone's favorite overpriced, gelled
up, frayed-bottom brand is into selling
thongs — for children. The words "eye
candy" and "wink wink" are printed on
the front of the skimpy underwear. Now
that's hot. Who is Abercrombie's head of
design? Woody Allen?
After this latest controversy, I've de
cided to take a stand. From now on, I'm
severing all ties with Abercrombie. They
can't use my picture on their in-store
posters. And I want back all the negatives

from that photo shoot on the beach
where I playfully wrestled with all the
other male models, while wearing noth
ing but a strategically placed floppy fish
erman's hat. That'll teach 'em. . . .
You chuckle but, according to The
New York Times, the trend in advertis
ing is to use regular guys instead of male
models. Seems that men are more inter
ested in seeing an actor or athlete or
someone who's done something with his
life fill out a page than looking at pic
tures of a frail, 19-year-old toothpick
with a pixie haircut and more than a
passing resemblance to a seven-year-old
girl pretend to know how to wear a dou
ble-breasted, pin-striped suit. Talk about
kiddie porn. . . .
So, with the new focus of modeling, if
I were hiring some guys to pimp my
suits, it'd be Arturo Gatti and Irish Micky
Ward. Don't worry, I didn't know who
they were either. But Sunday night I
stumbled onto a next-day replay of their
fight on HBO2. Just in time for the ninth
round. Luckily, that happened to be one
of the best boxing rounds of all time.
Within the first 20 seconds, Gatti gets
knocked down by a body shot to the liver
and barely survives the l()-count. He
staggers up, just in time for Ward to
pound him into oblivion yet again. But,
like a character in an awful Hollywood
reenactment of the sweet science or the
manufactured melodrama of the WWF,
Gatti resuscitates himself in the same
round and batters Ward up against the
ropes. Until Gatti punches himself out of
breath and Ward strikes back, putting
Gatti back into a walking coma before he
can be mercifully saved by the bell. And
then, after the fight is almost stopped,
Gatti comes back to win the 10th round
decisively. But still loses the light on ma
jority decision. Wow.
I mean, if you want to see two people ab
solutely bludgeoning each other, two guys
who will surely descend into drunken, par
alysed poverty within 12 years, check the
replay of that bout on HBO2 sometime this
week. And wait for the ninth round.
It is so amazing, so brutally heart
pumping that you'll be forced to start
talking like Kevin Harlan.
"Feel the torque. See the detonation.
Irish Micky Ward."

(they couldn't have sent a droid along?)"
hobby. 21st century. Catch the fever
of openness and experimentation. Like
Abercrombie & Fitch. . . .
Fresh off of getting in trouble for pro
ducing a batch of racist t-shirts, Aber
crombie decided to get into a less contro
versial business: kiddie porn. It appears
everyone's favorite overpriced, gelled
up, frayed-bottom brand is into selling
thongs — for children. The words "eye
candy" and "wink wink" are printed on
the front of the skimpy underwear. Now
that's hot. Who is Abercrombie's head of
design? Woody Allen?
After this latest controversy, I've de
cided to take a stand. From now on, I'm
severing all ties with Abercrombie. They
can't use my picture on their in-store
posters. And I want back all the negatives

from that photo shoot on the beach
where I playfully wrestled with all the
other male models, while wearing noth
ing but a strategically placed floppy fish
erman's hat. That'll teach 'em. . . .
You chuckle but, according to The
New York Times, the trend in advertis
ing is to use regular guys instead of male
models. Seems that men are more inter
ested in seeing an actor or athlete or
someone who's done something with his
life fill out a page than looking at pic
tures of a frail, 19-year-old toothpick
with a pixie haircut and more than a
passing resemblance to a seven-year-old
girl pretend to know how to wear a dou
ble-breasted, pin-striped suit. Talk about
kiddie porn. . . .
So, with the new focus of modeling, if
I were hiring some guys to pimp my
suits, it'd be Arturo Gatti and Irish Micky
Ward. Don't worry, I didn't know who
they were either. But Sunday night I
stumbled onto a next-day replay of their
fight on HBO2. Just in time for the ninth
round. Luckily, that happened to be one
of the best boxing rounds of all time.
Within the first 20 seconds, Gatti gets
knocked down by a body shot to the liver
and barely survives the l()-count. He
staggers up, just in time for Ward to
pound him into oblivion yet again. But,
like a character in an awful Hollywood
reenactment of the sweet science or the
manufactured melodrama of the WWF,
Gatti resuscitates himself in the same
round and batters Ward up against the
ropes. Until Gatti punches himself out of
breath and Ward strikes back, putting
Gatti back into a walking coma before he
can be mercifully saved by the bell. And
then, after the fight is almost stopped,
Gatti comes back to win the 10th round
decisively. But still loses the light on ma
jority decision. Wow.
I mean, if you want to see two people ab
solutely bludgeoning each other, two guys
who will surely descend into drunken, par
alysed poverty within 12 years, check the
replay of that bout on HBO2 sometime this
week. And wait for the ninth round.
It is so amazing, so brutally heart
pumping that you'll be forced to start
talking like Kevin Harlan.
"Feel the torque. See the detonation.
Irish Micky Ward."
