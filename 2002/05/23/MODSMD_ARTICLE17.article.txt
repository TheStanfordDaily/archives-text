Depression article 'embarrassingly
oversimplified and ignorant 7
Anne Becker managed to single-hand
edly reinforce some of the most common
misconceptions about depression. I find
the article "Investigative Report: Unmask
ing Depression at Stanford" to be embar
rassingly oversimplified and ignorant.
Depression is a disease resulting from
chemical imbalances in the brain. Sure,
there are environmental factors that can
worsen depression's symptoms, but the
bottom line is some people are going to
suffer from depression whether or not
they go to Harvard or Chico State. The ar
ticle offensively insinuates that depression
only happens to people who attend more
stressful schools. Depression affects a per
son regardless of their class, race, up
bringing, or level of education.
I find it shameful that Elizabeth Shin's
death was used in such an inappropriate
manner. Rather than addressing the
poor medical treatment Shin received,
or the nature of her mood disorder,
Becker mentions the "caring atmo
sphere" MIT will establish because of
this student's death.
A "caring" environment may be neces
sary to encourage students find medical
attention, but it is certainly not going to
cure mental illness by itself. Shin's tragic
death was caused by a serious medical
problem that was treated inappropriately.
I doubt Shin died because she did not
have enough "official fun."
Being aware of mental illness, its symp
toms and physiology, is much more useful
than examining how much "pre-arrival
pressure" a person can handle, or whether a

person should take a year off from school or
not. While decreased pressure and time off
from school can help a person with depres
sion, neither are treatment. A person with
stress-management problems may need a
break from academia and some counseling.
A depressed person needs to see a physician.
Granted, I am not a psychologist , phar
macist, psychiatrist or medical doctor. I'm
not a peer counselor. I haven't even de
clared. But we at Stanford have the privi
lege of studying at a world-class university.
There are top psychiatrists and psy
chopharmacologists working on this cam
pus, on this topic, who are willing to talk to
students about depression and other
mood disorders.

CS major disagrees with Purtill
I would like to decimate, once and for
all, the images of Sweet Hall character
ized in Corinne Purtill's article, "Sweet
Dreams for Techies." In contrast to her
allegation that Sweet Hall is home to
men who "ha[ve] no eyes, like a mole," I
propose that Sweet Hall is as close to
sheer, rough, honest humankind as one
can find anywhere on campus. Instead, I
put forth that it is the fuzzies who miss
the advantages of a central gathering
point. Allow me first, though, to respond
to her experiences in the building I lov
ingly refer to as "The Beige Mahal."
If the author truly "couldn't hear a
sound," as she alleges, I fear that her trip
was ill-timed. Had she instead made her

trek on the final day of a large class project,
she would have experienced first-hand the
palpable revenge of the past two weeks'
procrastination, writ large. Indeed, it may
have been especially pungent remnants of
this frenzy that made her advise Sweet Hall
to open a window. In an environment
when people counting down the seconds
(that's right, fuzzies, our assignments are
due at 12:00:00, not just "in section"), some
of the best bonds between people are
formed. I have too many friends that 1
know only by some vague recollection of
which workstation they were using the
final morning of EE/C5792 because, as
sunlight started to shine through the
blinds, we were yelling back and forth, cast
ing aspersions on the marital status of our
professor's parents at the moment of his
birth. 1 have personally been known in
some circles only as "Curly" for upwards of
six months because in the haste to finish
our projects, we asked each other only for
help, not Christian names.
Sweet Hall is a social psychology ex
periment waiting to happen. Indeed,
some may consider it to already be crud
er and much more unusual than the
Stanford Prison Experiment. Instead of
assuming the roles society is pushing
upon us, however, we rebel and cast off
such yokes. In Sweet Hall, societal con
ventions and pre-conceptions are
stripped away, because after too many
grueling hours of cat pal-tunnel-syn
drome-inducing typing, we have neither
the energy nor the style to keep up false
pretenses and composed personas. In
deed, the second floor of that delicious
building is, 1 believe, the very heart of
humanity.
Speaking of which, I have long won
dered where the heart of the humanities
culture is on campus. 1 have heard it
mentioned in ASSU election proposals
far too -many times (no really, far far too
many times) thatTresidder is not a viable
student union. 1 firmly believe that
Sweet Hall fulfills the intended role: If I
had a nickel for every person 1 met at
Sweet Hall, I'd have more than any En
glish major will make in his first year
editing or juxtaposing or whatever it is
that fuzzies actually do after school. I
think my response to the same author's
"Penniless in Paradise" writes itself. I
issue a challenge to Purtill to answer me
this: Where can those students of a more
fuzzy nature go to gain bonds with their
peers after the trial by fire of a particu
larly difficult assignment?
If Purtill is going to try her hand at in
vestigative reporting, and absolutely
must stick her nose into our haven, the
one place on campus where we can scur
ry to get away from looks that question
our wardrobe and sunbeams that threat
en our pale complexions, I advise her to
stick to more objective questions, such as,
why do they sell microwave popcorn in

the vending machine next to the com
puters when there's no microwave to be
found? In any case, I hope that I have
provided to the Stanford community
some sense of the worth of Sweet Hall in
interpersonal relations between techies,
an already touchy area before Purtill in
sulted our "Home, Sweet Hall."

Stanford parent 'appalled' by Bon
Appetit employees' wages
As the parent of a Stanford student and
a person paying a large amount of money
for my child to receive a Stanford educa
tion, I am appalled to hear that there are
employees at Stanford earning poverty
level wages. My daughter told me that there
are Bon Appetit employees light now in
contract negotiations who earn $8.50 per
hour and cannot afford healthcare. She
also told me that University President John
Hennessy is doing nothing to help these
employees and that the University had re
mained silent on the issue even though em
ployees, students, faculty and others have
asked them to help.
What kind of world-class institution is
this? In the countless pamphlets, newslet
ters, and magazines I receive from Stan
ford, the university always writes how
Stanford strives "at all times to maintain
the highest standards of quality and in

tegrity." Is paying workers poverty wages
part of those high standards? I was so
proud when my daughter was accepted
into Stanford — I would tell all of my
friends and my family back in India about
how my daughter was studying in one of
the best schools — but now I am ashamed
of this University.
Are these the types of values Stanford is
teaching to the future leaders of the world?
That it is more important to invest in palm
trees and nice computers than in actual
people? That it is fine to let others be with
out health care and other basic necessities?
That is all right to turn your back on people
who are asking for your help just because it
might not be easy to help them?
These are not the lessons I want my
daughter to learn. I have always taught
her to be generous with what she has, to
try and help the people around her\vho
are not as fortunate as she is, and to do
what is right, especially when it is not an
easy thing to do.
Stanford University administrators
need to hold these same valued. I under
stand that Hennessy has many financial
pressures on him but money should never
be more important than the basic needs of
people. Hennessy, teach Stanford stu
dents to listen to their conscience, teach
them how important it is in this world to
do what is right; help Bon Appetit workers
in their struggle to get better wages.

Do not miss "What You Will"
Today at 12:00 and 6:30, do not miss
"What You Will", an adaptation by junior
Ava Roy of Shakespeare's "Twelfth
Night."
Springtime at Stanford is filled with so
many unique and fleeting performance
treasures, but this one is too good to
miss.
The show is put on by Roy's motley
troupe, We Players, outside, in dappled
sun and shade, with Stanford's lovely cam
pus as the monumental stage set.
This is Shakespeare at its exquisite
finest, in the original spirit of the bard, but
without the restrictions of a theater.
If you go on this magical journey, in
which actors and audience walk, with
music and drums, from the amazing
opening in front of the Law School, to the
joyous finish, at the base of Hoover lower,
you will never see these parts of campus
the same way again.
This is Roy's third annual production
in this style. She did "Romeo and Juliet"
as a freshman, and"The Tempest" last
year.
This is the most ambitious so-far, filled
with surprises, including several songs by
Roy, playing the Jester.
Bring your friends to this party, and
don't be late, because the opening scene is
awesome.

I would like to decimate, once and for

ized in Corinne Purtill's article, "Sweet
Dreams for Techies." In contrast to her
allegation that Sweet Hall is home to
men who "ha[ve] no eyes, like a mole," I
propose that Sweet Hall is as close to
sheer, rough, honest humankind as one
can find anywhere on campus. Instead, I
put forth that it is the fuzzies who miss
the advantages of a central gathering
point. Allow me first, though, to respond
to her experiences in the building I lov
ingly refer to as "The Beige Mahal."
If the author truly "couldn't hear a
sound," as she alleges, I fear that her trip
was ill-timed. Had she instead made her

trek on the final day of a large class project,
she would have experienced first-hand the
palpable revenge of the past two weeks'
procrastination, writ large. Indeed, it may
have been especially pungent remnants of
this frenzy that made her advise Sweet Hall
to open a window. In an environment
when people counting down the seconds
(that's right, fuzzies, our assignments are
due at 12:00:00, not just "in section"), some
of the best bonds between people are
formed. I have too many friends that 1
know only by some vague recollection of
which workstation they were using the

birth. 1 have personally been known in
some circles only as "Curly" for upwards of
six months because in the haste to finish
our projects, we asked each other only for
help, not Christian names.
Sweet Hall is a social psychology ex
periment waiting to happen. Indeed,
some may consider it to already be crud
er and much more unusual than the
Stanford Prison Experiment. Instead of
assuming the roles society is pushing
upon us, however, we rebel and cast off
such yokes. In Sweet Hall, societal con
ventions and pre-conceptions are
stripped away, because after too many
grueling hours of cat pal-tunnel-syn
drome-inducing typing, we have neither
the energy nor the style to keep up false
pretenses and composed personas. In

building is, 1 believe, the very heart of
humanity.
Speaking of which, I have long won

far too -many times (no really, far far too
many times) thatTresidder is not a viable

Sweet Hall fulfills the intended role: If I
had a nickel for every person 1 met at
Sweet Hall, I'd have more than any En
glish major will make in his first year
editing or juxtaposing or whatever it is
that fuzzies actually do after school. I
think my response to the same author's
"Penniless in Paradise" writes itself. I
issue a challenge to Purtill to answer me
this: Where can those students of a more
fuzzy nature go to gain bonds with their
peers after the trial by fire of a particu
larly difficult assignment?
If Purtill is going to try her hand at in
vestigative reporting, and absolutely
must stick her nose into our haven, the
one place on campus where we can scur

stick to more objective questions, such as,
why do they sell microwave popcorn in

the vending machine next to the com
puters when there's no microwave to be
found? In any case, I hope that I have
provided to the Stanford community
some sense of the worth of Sweet Hall in
interpersonal relations between techies,
an already touchy area before Purtill in

Stanford parent 'appalled' by Bon
Appetit employees' wages
As the parent of a Stanford student and
a person paying a large amount of money
for my child to receive a Stanford educa
tion, I am appalled to hear that there are
employees at Stanford earning poverty
level wages. My daughter told me that there
are Bon Appetit employees light now in
contract negotiations who earn $8.50 per
hour and cannot afford healthcare. She
also told me that University President John
Hennessy is doing nothing to help these
employees and that the University had re
mained silent on the issue even though em
ployees, students, faculty and others have
asked them to help.
What kind of world-class institution is
this? In the countless pamphlets, newslet
ters, and magazines I receive from Stan
ford, the university always writes how
Stanford strives "at all times to maintain
the highest standards of quality and in

tegrity." Is paying workers poverty wages
part of those high standards? I was so
proud when my daughter was accepted
into Stanford — I would tell all of my
friends and my family back in India about
how my daughter was studying in one of
the best schools — but now I am ashamed
of this University.
Are these the types of values Stanford is
teaching to the future leaders of the world?
That it is more important to invest in palm
trees and nice computers than in actual
people? That it is fine to let others be with
out health care and other basic necessities?
That is all right to turn your back on people
who are asking for your help just because it
might not be easy to help them?
These are not the lessons I want my
daughter to learn. I have always taught
her to be generous with what she has, to
try and help the people around her\vho
are not as fortunate as she is, and to do
what is right, especially when it is not an
easy thing to do.
Stanford University administrators
need to hold these same valued. I under
stand that Hennessy has many financial
pressures on him but money should never
be more important than the basic needs of
people. Hennessy, teach Stanford stu
dents to listen to their conscience, teach
them how important it is in this world to
do what is right; help Bon Appetit workers
in their struggle to get better wages.

Do not miss "What You Will"
Today at 12:00 and 6:30, do not miss
"What You Will", an adaptation by junior
Ava Roy of Shakespeare's "Twelfth
Night."
Springtime at Stanford is filled with so
many unique and fleeting performance
treasures, but this one is too good to
miss.
The show is put on by Roy's motley
troupe, We Players, outside, in dappled
sun and shade, with Stanford's lovely cam
pus as the monumental stage set.
This is Shakespeare at its exquisite
finest, in the original spirit of the bard, but
without the restrictions of a theater.
If you go on this magical journey, in
which actors and audience walk, with
music and drums, from the amazing
opening in front of the Law School, to the
joyous finish, at the base of Hoover lower,
you will never see these parts of campus
the same way again.
This is Roy's third annual production
in this style. She did "Romeo and Juliet"
as a freshman, and"The Tempest" last
year.
This is the most ambitious so-far, filled
with surprises, including several songs by
Roy, playing the Jester.
Bring your friends to this party, and
don't be late, because the opening scene is
awesome.

Depression article 'embarrassingly
oversimplified and ignorant 7
Anne Becker managed to single-hand
edly reinforce some of the most common
misconceptions about depression. I find
the article "Investigative Report: Unmask
ing Depression at Stanford" to be embar
rassingly oversimplified and ignorant.
Depression is a disease resulting from
chemical imbalances in the brain. Sure,
there are environmental factors that can
worsen depression's symptoms, but the
bottom line is some people are going to
suffer from depression whether or not
they go to Harvard or Chico State. The ar
ticle offensively insinuates that depression
only happens to people who attend more
stressful schools. Depression affects a per
son regardless of their class, race, up
bringing, or level of education.
I find it shameful that Elizabeth Shin's
death was used in such an inappropriate
manner. Rather than addressing the
poor medical treatment Shin received,
or the nature of her mood disorder,
Becker mentions the "caring atmo
sphere" MIT will establish because of
this student's death.
A "caring" environment may be neces
sary to encourage students find medical
attention, but it is certainly not going to
cure mental illness by itself. Shin's tragic
death was caused by a serious medical
problem that was treated inappropriately.
I doubt Shin died because she did not
have enough "official fun."
Being aware of mental illness, its symp
toms and physiology, is much more useful
than examining how much "pre-arrival
pressure" a person can handle, or whether a

person should take a year off from school or
not. While decreased pressure and time off
from school can help a person with depres
sion, neither are treatment. A person with
stress-management problems may need a
break from academia and some counseling.
A depressed person needs to see a physician.
Granted, I am not a psychologist , phar
macist, psychiatrist or medical doctor. I'm
not a peer counselor. I haven't even de
clared. But we at Stanford have the privi
lege of studying at a world-class university.
There are top psychiatrists and psy
chopharmacologists working on this cam
pus, on this topic, who are willing to talk to
students about depression and other
mood disorders.

the energy nor the style to keep up false
pretenses and composed personas. In
deed, the second floor of that delicious
building is, 1 believe, the very heart of
humanity.
Speaking of which, I have long won
dered where the heart of the humanities
culture is on campus. 1 have heard it
mentioned in ASSU election proposals
far too -many times (no really, far far too
many times) thatTresidder is not a viable
student union. 1 firmly believe that
Sweet Hall fulfills the intended role: If I
had a nickel for every person 1 met at
Sweet Hall, I'd have more than any En
glish major will make in his first year
editing or juxtaposing or whatever it is
that fuzzies actually do after school. I
think my response to the same author's
"Penniless in Paradise" writes itself. I
issue a challenge to Purtill to answer me
this: Where can those students of a more
fuzzy nature go to gain bonds with their
peers after the trial by fire of a particu
larly difficult assignment?
If Purtill is going to try her hand at in
vestigative reporting, and absolutely
must stick her nose into our haven, the
one place on campus where we can scur
ry to get away from looks that question
our wardrobe and sunbeams that threat
en our pale complexions, I advise her to
stick to more objective questions, such as,
why do they sell microwave popcorn in

the vending machine next to the com
puters when there's no microwave to be
found? In any case, I hope that I have
provided to the Stanford community
some sense of the worth of Sweet Hall in
interpersonal relations between techies,
an already touchy area before Purtill in
sulted our "Home, Sweet Hall."

Stanford parent 'appalled' by Bon
Appetit employees' wages
As the parent of a Stanford student and
a person paying a large amount of money
for my child to receive a Stanford educa
tion, I am appalled to hear that there are
employees at Stanford earning poverty
level wages. My daughter told me that there
are Bon Appetit employees light now in
contract negotiations who earn $8.50 per
hour and cannot afford healthcare. She
also told me that University President John
Hennessy is doing nothing to help these
employees and that the University had re
mained silent on the issue even though em
ployees, students, faculty and others have
asked them to help.
What kind of world-class institution is
this? In the countless pamphlets, newslet
ters, and magazines I receive from Stan
ford, the university always writes how
Stanford strives "at all times to maintain
the highest standards of quality and in

tegrity." Is paying workers poverty wages
part of those high standards? I was so
proud when my daughter was accepted
into Stanford — I would tell all of my
friends and my family back in India about
how my daughter was studying in one of
the best schools — but now I am ashamed
of this University.
Are these the types of values Stanford is
teaching to the future leaders of the world?
That it is more important to invest in palm
trees and nice computers than in actual
people? That it is fine to let others be with
out health care and other basic necessities?
That is all right to turn your back on people
who are asking for your help just because it
might not be easy to help them?
These are not the lessons I want my
daughter to learn. I have always taught
her to be generous with what she has, to
try and help the people around her\vho
are not as fortunate as she is, and to do
what is right, especially when it is not an
easy thing to do.
Stanford University administrators
need to hold these same valued. I under
stand that Hennessy has many financial
pressures on him but money should never
be more important than the basic needs of
people. Hennessy, teach Stanford stu
dents to listen to their conscience, teach
them how important it is in this world to
do what is right; help Bon Appetit workers
in their struggle to get better wages.

Do not miss "What You Will"
Today at 12:00 and 6:30, do not miss
"What You Will", an adaptation by junior
Ava Roy of Shakespeare's "Twelfth
Night."
Springtime at Stanford is filled with so
many unique and fleeting performance
treasures, but this one is too good to
miss.
The show is put on by Roy's motley
troupe, We Players, outside, in dappled
sun and shade, with Stanford's lovely cam
pus as the monumental stage set.
This is Shakespeare at its exquisite
finest, in the original spirit of the bard, but
without the restrictions of a theater.
If you go on this magical journey, in
which actors and audience walk, with
music and drums, from the amazing
opening in front of the Law School, to the
joyous finish, at the base of Hoover lower,
you will never see these parts of campus
the same way again.
This is Roy's third annual production
in this style. She did "Romeo and Juliet"
as a freshman, and"The Tempest" last
year.
This is the most ambitious so-far, filled
with surprises, including several songs by
Roy, playing the Jester.
Bring your friends to this party, and
don't be late, because the opening scene is
awesome.
