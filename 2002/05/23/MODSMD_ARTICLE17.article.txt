Depression article 'embarrassingly
oversimplified and ignorant 7
Anne Becker managed to single-hand
edly reinforce some of the most common
misconceptions about depression. I find
the article "Investigative Report: Unmask
ing Depression at Stanford" to be embar
rassingly oversimplified and ignorant.
Depression is a disease resulting from
chemical imbalances in the brain. Sure,
there are environmental factors that can
worsen depression's symptoms, but the
bottom line is some people are going to
suffer from depression whether or not
they go to Harvard or Chico State. The ar
ticle offensively insinuates that depression
only happens to people who attend more
stressful schools. Depression affects a per
son regardless of their class, race, up
bringing, or level of education.
I find it shameful that Elizabeth Shin's
death was used in such an inappropriate
manner. Rather than addressing the
poor medical treatment Shin received,
or the nature of her mood disorder,
Becker mentions the "caring atmo
sphere" MIT will establish because of
this student's death.
A "caring" environment may be neces
sary to encourage students find medical
attention, but it is certainly not going to
cure mental illness by itself. Shin's tragic
death was caused by a serious medical
problem that was treated inappropriately.
I doubt Shin died because she did not
have enough "official fun."
Being aware of mental illness, its symp
toms and physiology, is much more useful
than examining how much "pre-arrival
pressure" a person can handle, or whether a

person should take a year off from school or
not. While decreased pressure and time off
from school can help a person with depres
sion, neither are treatment. A person with
stress-management problems may need a
break from academia and some counseling.
A depressed person needs to see a physician.
Granted, I am not a psychologist , phar
macist, psychiatrist or medical doctor. I'm
not a peer counselor. I haven't even de
clared. But we at Stanford have the privi
lege of studying at a world-class university.
There are top psychiatrists and psy
chopharmacologists working on this cam
pus, on this topic, who are willing to talk to
students about depression and other
mood disorders.

Sophomore, I Undeclared

CS major disagrees with Purtill
I would like to decimate, once and for
all, the images of Sweet Hall character
ized in Corinne Purtill's article, "Sweet
Dreams for Techies." In contrast to her
allegation that Sweet Hall is home to
men who "ha[ve] no eyes, like a mole," I
propose that Sweet Hall is as close to
sheer, rough, honest humankind as one
can find anywhere on campus. Instead, I
put forth that it is the fuzzies who miss
the advantages of a central gathering
point. Allow me first, though, to respond
to her experiences in the building I lov
ingly refer to as "The Beige Mahal."
If the author truly "couldn't hear a
sound," as she alleges, I fear that her trip
was ill-timed. Had she instead made her

trek on the final day of a large class project,
she would have experienced first-hand the
palpable revenge of the past two weeks'
procrastination, writ large. Indeed, it may
have been especially pungent remnants of
this frenzy that made her advise Sweet Hall
to open a window. In an environment
when people counting down the seconds
(that's right, fuzzies, our assignments are
due at 12:00:00, not just "in section"), some
of the best bonds between people are
formed. I have too many friends that 1
know only by some vague recollection of
which workstation they were using the
final morning of EE/C5792 because, as
sunlight started to shine through the
blinds, we were yelling back and forth, cast
ing aspersions on the marital status of our
professor's parents at the moment of his
birth. 1 have personally been known in
some circles only as "Curly" for upwards of
six months because in the haste to finish
our projects, we asked each other only for
help, not Christian names.
Sweet Hall is a social psychology ex
periment waiting to happen. Indeed,
some may consider it to already be crud
er and much more unusual than the
Stanford Prison Experiment. Instead of
assuming the roles society is pushing
upon us, however, we rebel and cast off
such yokes. In Sweet Hall, societal con
ventions and pre-conceptions are
stripped away, because after too many
grueling hours of cat pal-tunnel-syn
drome-inducing typing, we have neither
the energy nor the style to keep up false
pretenses and composed personas. In
deed, the second floor of that delicious
