## Two-sport star Teyo Johnson is crucial to football's success A
						Starter for Life 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
From now on, sophomore
wide receiver Teyo Johnson re
fuses to sit on the bench.
"I learned an important les
son my freshman year: I don't
like being on the sidelines,"
Johnson said. "I was on the
sidelines for football and the
bench for basketball, and I
didn't like that very much. I de
cided that I would do anything
I can to stay on the field or the
court."
Johnson doesn't have to
worry about sitting out most of
this year. After last season's Pa
cific 10 Co-Freshman of the Year
performance, he is now the Car
dinal's number one offensive
target.
However, with new coach
Buddy Teevens at the helm of
the Cardinal offense, even John
son will have to make a few ad
justments.
"Spring ball went really well,"
Johnson said. "There was a lot of
competition because no one's
position was set in stone. The
most difficult part for me was
learning the new offense. It was
definitely a more difficult spring
than last year."
Teevens' new offensive
scheme looks to highlight John
son's skills as team emphasizes
the deep strike.

"I think (he different routes
are new," Johnson said. "As a re
ceiver, I know I am going to be
catching the ball more, which is
really exciting."
Johnson has been an athlete
all of his life. He has played bas
ketball, track, soccer and base
ball along with football.
"I gained a lot of agility in
track, and basketball gets me in
great shape," the star receiver
said. "I got a lot better at jump
ing in traffic and improved my
hand-eye coordination."
When Johnson first arrived
on campus, he was primarily a
quarterback. However, the staff
could not let his athleticism sit on
the bench as a backup. Conse
quently, Johnson switched to
wide receiver to maximize his
time on the field.
"My experience at quarter
back really helps with timing is
sues," Johnson said. "There are
times where I know where [ju
nior quarterback] Chris Lewis is
going to put the ball. Also, han
dling pressure as a quarterback
has helped me handle pressure
as a receiver. I wish I was grant
ed the opportunity to play quar
terback and develop as a quar
terback, but everything has
worked out well."
This year, Lewis is coming
into the season as the starting
quarterback after playing a
back-up role to Randy Fasani on

last year's squad.
"I think Randy gets rid of the
ball quicker than Chris," John
son said. "With Chris, I can take
a little more time on my routes."
Last year, Johnson was able to
use his 6-foot-7 frame to leap
over defensive backs for easy
scores. While the Lewis-to-John
son lob will no doubt be a com
mon play this season, Johnson
hopes to add to his repertoire.
"The fact that 1 am going to
be getting up and grabbing the
ball is established from last
year," Johnson said. "But mak
ing someone miss and gaining
some yards after the catch are
what I want to add this year."
Whatever way he makes his
catches, the offense will no doubt
be exciting to watch.
"It's easy to find Teyo," Lewis
said. "If he is running over the
middle or going deep, you just
kind of have more room for
error with Teyo. You can throw
it high, and you know that he is
going to go up and get it, while
other defensive backs can't get
there."
Similar to the rest of the team,
Johnson has high hopes for the
upcoming season.
"I don't think Stanford has
been this talented in a long
time," Johnson said. "We are so
talented and cutting-edge. It is
going to be fun to watch. We are
thinking nothing but a national

championship."
Although one of the criticisms
of the team has been its green
defense, Johnson isn't worried.
Having played against the de
fense in the annual spring Car
dinal and White Game, Johnson
liked what he saw.
"I think they are going to be
really good," Johnson said. "1
think they are going to be better
than last year."
Johnson is primarily concen
trating on football this off-sea
son. He has been training with
NFL wide receivers Jerry Rice
and J.J. Stokes, and has also
been lifting weights with the
Cardinal.
"I am just trying to learn
things from them," Johnson said.
"I am being a sponge out there
with them so that when fall comes
I can be at the top of my game."
After last year's successful sea
son, there are going to be a lot of
expectation placed on the Cardi
nal's star receiver. In addition,
questions about the future are
inevitable as Johnson continues
to dominate on the field.
"People talk about [the] NFL
next year," he said. "I don't even
think about that stuff. I am just
focusing on my sophomore year
of football and my junior year of
basketball."
One thing is for certain: John
son won't be seeing much time
on the Sidelines.
