The NCAA women's tennis individual cham
pionships are in full swing, and the national
champion Cardinal (27-1) continues to be well
represented.
Senior Gabriela Lastra and freshman Erin Bur
dette are two of the eight remaining singles players,
and the duos of Lastra and senior Lauren Kalvaria
as well as Burdette and sophomore Lauren
Barnikow survived the first two doubles rounds.
Lastra, a No. 9-16 seed ranked No. 6 nationally
in singles, glided past Georgia's No. 7 Agatha
Cioroch, the tournament's fifth seed, 6-0, 6-4.
"I thought I came out very focused in today's
match," Lastra said. "I had played her at the Team
Indoors earlier this season and she just crushed
me, so today I just tried to take it one point at a
time."
Lastra will face off against Tennessee's No. 9
Vilmarie Castellvi, also a No. 9-16 seed, today in
the quarterfinals at 11 a.m. at the Taube Tennis
Center.
No. 13 Burdette won her match against No. 18
Lindsay Dawaf, 6-2, 6-3, and will face Arizona
State's No. 17 Adria Engel today. Engel toppled
Virginia Commonwealth's No. 38 Ondrisova, seed
ed sixth, in a marathon 1-6, 7-6(4), 6-1 match to ad
vance to her meeting with Burdette.
"I knew that if I kept staying focused I could
come out on top," Engel said. "There were a lot of
long points in the tiebreaker so I basically just tried
to go for my shots."
No. 4 Kalvaria, seeded eighth, was upset, 7-5,6-
3, by the tournament's Cinderella, No. 14 Kate
Pinchbeck of North Carolina. Burdette, Kalvaria
and Lastra all earned All-American status by ad
vancing to yesterday's round of 16.
In the doubles draw, which started yesterday,
both Stanford teams went unbeaten.
Kalvaria and Lastra, the top-ranked and top
seeded tandem, took down Washington State's No.
12 Stacy McKenna and Erica Perkins, 4-6, 6-4, 6-0,
and Fresno State's No. 10 Simone jardim and Kim
Niggemeyer, 6-4, 1-6, 6-2.
Burdette and Barnikow, ranked No. 14, dis
patched Oklahoma State's No. 13 Linda Faltynko
va and Katarzyna Kolodynska, 6-4, 6-3, and Mid
dle Tennessee State's No. 21 Manon Kruse and
