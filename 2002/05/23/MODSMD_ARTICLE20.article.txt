### STACIE SOLT 
Tuesday marked an unprece
dented day for Stanford athletics.
For the first time in the school's his
tory, the women's varsity boats were
invited to compete in the national
championship regatta.
Following a spectacular perfor
mance in rain-swamped Sacramento
this past weekend, the women eager
ly awaited news from the NCAA high
er-ups. The team's finish at the Pacif
ic 10 Conference Championship —
fourth for the first varsity eight, third
for the second varsity eight, fourth for
the varsity four and third team over
all — placed it in the precarious posi
tion of not being guaranteed a bid,
but still in reasonably good shape for
securing an at-large position.
Typically, the NCAA invites the
top two teams from each of the five
regions nationwide. The remain
ing'two team bids usually go to two
of the top third-place teams in each
region. An individual varsity eight
boat can also receive an at-large bid
if it finishes strong enough but the
team overall does not.
These statistics left the Stanford
women in rather uncertain waters,
awaiting the announcement via a
phone call to head coach Aimee
Baker by Tuesday at noon. Monday
afternoon and Tuesday morning,
the women practiced as usual with
high hopes. Captain Sabrina Kolker
sent out an e-mail message that
adamantly prohibited any team
member from "walking under lad
ders or steppin' on any cracks."
Just before midday Tuesday, a
number of rowers crammed into
Bakef's small office in the Ford Cen
ter to hear the news. Within a mo
ment, all the anxious anticipation
and months of training paid off in
two key words, "We're going!"
After a unprecedented 2001 sea
son that saw the Stanford oar

swomen finish ranked No. 19 in the
country, 2002 lias brought even
more success. The team will head off
to Indianapolis, Ind. next week as
the 12th-ranked team in the nation.
Throughout the season the Cardi
nal has floated up and down in the
top 20 poll. The team was ranked as
high as sixth after its decisive win
against California.
The NCAA competition, held at
Eagle Creek Reservoir from May 31
to June 2, will feature a total of 16
different Division 1 schools compet
ing over the three days in heats,
semifinals and finals, all to narrow
down and determine the top
women's boat in the country.
The competition will include an
unprecedented five schools from the
Pac-10, marking a departure from
past selection committees, which
have tended to overlook the West
Coast. Last year's NCAA results
which saw Washington claim the na
tional title, followed by Pac-10 rivals
Southern California and California
finishing fourth and ninth respec
tively, indicated that crew was more
of a nationwide phenomenon rather
than one reserved for the traditional
powerhouses on the East Coast.
Despite the rise in Pac-10 crew,
even the coaches didn't expect the
NCAA Championships would see
five Pac-10 teams. USC coach
George Jenkins sent his boats to
their home base in Washington fol
lowing the races in Sacramento this
past weekend, certain that his team's
season was over.
With the invitation made official,
the Stanford women are gearing up
for an intense weekend of racing.
This championship will be a chance
to face crews from around the coun
try not seen earlier this season, and
also, with five of the six Pac-10 final
ists appearing in Indianapolis, to
avenge the first varsity eight's
fourth-place finish last weekend.
