# Junior Lauren Fleshman leads the track team in
## Running to the future 
### MINAYO NASALI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a word, junior Lauren Fleshman is con
nected. Connected with her team, her sports,
her family and her studies, Fleshman has a pulse
on life that gives her a perspective on her mul
tiple roles, while maintaining a singular sense of
herself.
Her drive to excel has propelled Fleshman
throughout her athletic career to her current
position as captain of the women's track team
and leading collegiate middle-distance runner
in the nation. Since her arrival at Stanford,
Fleshman has garnered Ail-American honors in
every cross country, indoor track and outdoor
track season.
Fleshman's athletic prowess is definitely one
of her talents. However it is not her defining
characteristic. Valuing the importance of a bal
anced lifestyle, she recognizes her roles as an ac
tive team member, student and friend. But she
also recognizes the importance of observing
and understanding her environment, how she
interacts with others and how others relate to
her.
"I realize that everyone at Stanford eventu
ally fits into a more and more defined commu
nity, based on their passions," Fleshman said.
"We are all smart and well-rounded people, ca
pable of being successful in many different
things and capable of fitting in with many dif
ferent kinds of people. But there are only 24
hours in a day, and you have to chose something
you want to focus on. Every year, as I invest
more of myself into my sport and community, it
becomes more and more meaningful when I
put on a Stanford jersey."
Recognizing her relationship with her team,
and her larger connection to the collective Stan
ford community, Fleshman ties this perspective
to the values her parents instilled in her during
her childhood.
Fleshman attributes her assertive qualities to
her father's encouraging her to always strive
and deliver her best effort.
"My dad raised me to be tough and confi
dent," Fleshman said. "He told me, 'Lauren,
you can do absolutely anything in the world with
hard work and confidence."'
While her father pushed her to develop a
strong character, Fleshman's mother affirmed
the importance of taking time to appreciate life
and cultivate relationships essential to personal
fulfillment.
Fleshman remembers her favorite camping
memories from her childhood, and how the
lessons her parents have imbued in her were ap

parent even then.
"My favorite family memories are from all
our car camping trips at the Kern River,"
Fleshman recalled. "We'd hang out all day on
the riverbank and jump off the c lif 112 rocks into
the freezing water. My dad would be encour
aging me to challenge some boys my age to a
jump off, while my mom would desperately try
to dissuade me, 'Don't jump, Lauren. Instead,
why not go take the boys around and show
them the historical landmark I showed you
earlier.'"
With her strong familial ties and cherished
childhood memories, Fleshman can see how
her childhood values and the time she current
ly invests at Stanford will affect her future de
cisions.
Fleshman is a human biology major with a
focus in human performance. She describes her
most rewarding academic experience in her
class on bioethics taught by Human Biology
Prof. William Hurlbut.
"My bioethics [class] helped me see that no
matter how much you study and research and
learn, there are no easy answers," Fleshman
said.
Interested in studying exercise physiology,
Fleshman plans on researching female distance
runners and specific methods of coaching
women. In the future, Fleshman hopes to work
with USA Track and Field, using her studies
and research to increase opportunities for fe
male track athletes.
But first, Fleshman wants to spend a few
years running professionally with the intent of
making a bid at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics.
Fleshman contributes to her athletic aspira
tions each time she steps on the track. However,
she recognizes both her own capabilities and the
influential relationships she shares with her
family, friends and teammates.
When asked to share some essential advice,
Fleshman said, "I receive good advice every sin
gle day. I try to learn from other people as much
as possible."
With her connection with life and all the rela
tionships and complexities inherent in it, Flesh
man remembers the words of her coach, Dean
Evans.
"There is a tiny little line separating good
from great," Evans said. "And you can't cross it
without taking care of the details."
To Fleshman, the details are essential in con
tributing to her larger perspective on herself
and her interaction with the world around her.
With each practice, race, cheer and accolade,
Fleshman redefines herself as a leader, and re
asserts herself as an athlete.
