Dean of Students Marc Wais presented the James
W. Lyons Award to 13 students and the Dean's
Achievement Award to 11 student groups last night
at a banquet in Tresidder Union's Oak Lounge.
The annual awards are intended to honor stu
dents and on-campus groups for outstanding con
tributions to campus life or community service. Stu
dents and groups must receive nominations from
members of the Stanford community to become eli
gible as potential award recipients.
"These awards reflect the good work our students
carry out to enrich the lives of others, on and off cam
pus," Wais said.
The selection process for the 2001-2002 awards
was more competitive than in past years. With 72
Lyons Award and 64 Dean's Award nominations, the
total number of nominations rose to 136 over last
year's count of 114.
"The 136 nominations [this year] symbolize the
growing stature and significance of these awards and
help explain why Stanford is so special," Wais said.
Senior Seth Cohen was one of the six members of
the selection committee for this year's awards. He
discussed the difficulty of selecting winners.

"It was tough. There wasarecord number of sub
missions," Cohen said. "We looked for breadth and
depth, but the most important thing was sustained
commitment, not isolated or sporadic efforts."
l he idea of a ceremony to honor service achieve
ments by students was first conceived in 1982 by
James Lyons, from whom the Lyons Award takes its
name. Lyons served as the dean for student affairs
for over 20 years and presided over the awards in the
program's early days,
"Mrs. Lyons and I entertained students, nomina
tors and their friends on campus," Lyons said. "[The
award] was given to six students each quarter. Back
then, it was a much more informal affair."
Students and groups expressed enthusiasm for
the dinner.
Bernabe Garcia, Jr., a coterminal student in Latin
American Studies, explained his reaction when he
found out he would receive the Lyons Award.
"I was really surprised, not just about getting ac
cepted, but even getting nominated," Garcia said.
"Hearing what other people have done, it is really
amazingjust to be lucky enough to be included with
these people."

Lyons gave a brief address to t he
ceremony's attendees before the
honors were presented. After the
dinner, when asked what inspired
him to initially create a service
award, Lyons commented that he
felt the ceremony spoke for itself .
"The best way to explain why
the awards were set up was what
the awards were tonight," said
Lyons. "[The ceremony] showed
the richness of the service students
give to the University and to each
other."
