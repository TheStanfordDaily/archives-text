# University settles harassment suit
## 
### MIKEY LEE EDITORIAL STAFF 
On Tuesday, the University settled a
lawsuit filed by Barbara Zylbert, a for
mer medical student. Zylbert alleged
that she was not admitted to the Uni
versity's surgical residency program
because she had previously filed a sex
ual harassment complaint against a
professor.
Zylbert graduated from the School of
Medicine in 1996. She had complained
about Prof. Mark Perlroth, a cardiologist,
in 1991. Perlroth had apologized for his
behavior and the University had
promised Zylbert protection "from reper
cussions" resulting from her complaint.
After graduating from Stanford, Zyl-

Bert tried to complete a residency at UC-
San Francisco and the University of Min
nesota but left both places due to discipli
nary problems with other doctors, ac
cording to those hospitals. She then
trained at another local hospital and at
tempted to do some residency work at
Stanford Hospital. The hospital objected,
citing the previous disciplinary problems.
Zylbert claimed that by refusing to
admit her, Stanford was retaliating for
her 1991 complaint. The selective surgi
cal residency program has five spots
open each year.
The trial, which was already in
progress in Santa Clara County Superior
Court, was, according to Judge William
Martin in a San Jose Mercury News arti
cle, "probably the most difficult case" he

had to settle in his 12 years of handling
similar issues. The difficulty arose be
cause both sides held firm positions and
concessions were hard-won, he said.
The terms of the settlement were not
disclosed, but General Counsel Debra
Zumwalt said that the University was
pleased with the outcome.
"We believe now and have believed all
along that Stanford would prevail at
trial," she said. "We have prevailed
through various court rulings to date."
Zumwalt did not go into detail about
the case, but said that the settlement
will allow work on other issues to move
forward.
"This really keeps us from spending
another month in court or trial instead of
doing more productive things," she said.
