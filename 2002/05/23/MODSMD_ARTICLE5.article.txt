# College Board may revamp the SAT
## Changes might include advanced math problems, new writing portion

The SAT can send panic into the
hearts of many high school students, with
its seemingly endless multiple-choice
questions. But in light of recent criticism
from high-profile higher-education offi
cials, the test faces a possible makeover.
"The College Board has a long history
of an evolving examination," James
Montoya, a vice president of the College
Board and a former dean of undergrad
uate admissions at Stanford, recently told
The New York Times.
Proposed changes include the addi
tion of more advanced math questions
and longer passages suited to a college
preparatory curriculum, as well as a writ

ing portion, which would include an
essay written by test-taking students and
multiple-choice questions on grammar
usage. The word analogy section would
be eliminated, but related questions
would be worked into the test's reading
section.
The potential restructuring is
prompted in part by Richard C. Atkin
son, the president of the University of
California system, and other college offi
cials around the country â€” many of
whom feel that the test favors students
from middle- and upper-income fami
lies.
With 178,000 students on 10 campus
es, the University of California system is
the largest market for the SAT. Last year,
nearly 161,000 California seniors took
the exam.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions
Robin Mamlet commented on the pro
posed revision.
"Changes for [the UC system] do not
affect Stanford," Mamlet said. "There are

some broader changes being contem
plated by [the] College Board that would
certainly affect Stanford."
Gaston Caperton, the president of the
College Board, which writes the SAT,
told Education Week that the changes
would be a significant retooling of the
verbal and mathematics sections of the
exam.
"We always look at ways we can im
prove all of our products," Caperton
said. "It became clear to us that we need
ed to look at the whole test."
The restructuring of the SAT has been
an ongoing process. In 1993, the
antonyms portion of the verbal section
was replaced with more reading passages
antl students were allowed for the first
time to use calculators on the math sec
tion.
If approved, the new test will take ef
fect for the graduating class 0f2006.
According to Caperton, ongoing con-
versations with college leaders
around the country had helped
speed up discussion about revising
the test. Last month, a UC faculty
committee recommended drop
ping the SAT in favor of assess
ments that are more closely
aligned with California high
school standards.
While the SAT has been a rela
tively adequate predictor of how
students will achieve as college
freshmen, college olficials seek a
broader tool to measure a more in
clusive range of skills.
