### JOHN HUETTER EDITORIAL STAFF 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate
voted to grant Senator Hiro Iwanaga a
leave of absence and heard a visitor from
the Persian Students Association discuss
foreign student visas.
Senator Joey Natoli, a freshman, intro
duced a hill to grant Iwanaga, a junior, a
leave of absence, saying the bill was"in the
best interests of the senate."
Administration and Rules Committee

Chair Connie Chen discussed the two pas
sages from the ASSU Constitution and by
laws relevant to what she referred to as "the
I liro Issue."
The "Hiro Issue" involves the fact that
Iwanaga is currently studying abroad in

member.
"These two things are not in conflict with
each other," Chen said. She said the com

Chen, a sophomore, noted that Tues
day's meeting was the Senate's third of the

new term and that Iwanaga's three ab
sences would have fallen under the rule of
automatic expulsion. She clarified that the
meeting to select a Senate Chair — not the
first meeting under the new chair, which
was the second — counted as the first offi
cial meeting of their term.
She concluded by stating, "Our term is
not defined by the quality of work being
done."
Senator Sara Ines Calderon, a fresh
man, called fora vote.
"We're already decided anyway,"

Calderon said. "We talked for hours and
hours and hours about this [at the last
meeting]."
Senator Ellie Martin said that the Ad
ministrations and Rules Committee has
plans to "do a whole overhaul" of the by
laws this summer and help eliminate some
of the constitutional contradictions and
poor wording in the by-laws.
The body agreed that granting Iwanaga
a leave of absence was meant to Ik* a case-
