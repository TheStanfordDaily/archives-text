## 
### JOHN HUETTER EDITORIAL STAFF 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate
voted to grant Senator Hiro Iwanaga a
leave of absence and heard a visitor from
the Persian Students Association discuss
foreign student visas.
Senator Joey Natoli, a freshman, intro
duced a hill to grant Iwanaga, a junior, a
leave of absence, saying the bill was"in the
best interests of the senate."
Administration and Rules Committee

Chair Connie Chen discussed the two pas
sages from the ASSU Constitution and by
laws relevant to what she referred to as "the
I liro Issue."
The "Hiro Issue" involves the fact that
Iwanaga is currently studying abroad in
Japan and obviously unable to attend Sen
ate meetings until the fall. Last year's Sen

ate passed a bill meant to discourage sena
tors from going abroad.
At its May 14 meeting, the Senate ques
tioned whether the by-laws rule that re
quires expulsion after three absences con
flicts with the constitution's calling for two
thirds of the Senate to vote to expel a
member.
"These two things are not in conflict with
each other," Chen said. She said the com
mittee viewed them as two separate issues.
Chen, a sophomore, noted that Tues
day's meeting was the Senate's third of the

new term and that Iwanaga's three ab
sences would have fallen under the rule of
automatic expulsion. She clarified that the
meeting to select a Senate Chair — not the
first meeting under the new chair, which
was the second — counted as the first offi
cial meeting of their term.
She concluded by stating, "Our term is
not defined by the quality of work being
done."
Senator Sara Ines Calderon, a fresh
man, called fora vote.
"We're already decided anyway,"

Calderon said. "We talked for hours and
hours and hours about this [at the last
meeting]."
Senator Ellie Martin said that the Ad
ministrations and Rules Committee has
plans to "do a whole overhaul" of the by
laws this summer and help eliminate some
of the constitutional contradictions and
poor wording in the by-laws.
The body agreed that granting Iwanaga
a leave of absence was meant to Ik* a case-

specific example, and not meant to
set a precedent. An amendment
stating this was added to the bill,
which passed 9-2-2.
Foreign student visas
"There has been a bill passed
[by Congress] about general immi
gration laws, and some changes
have been made to the laws," said
the member of the Persian Stu
dents Association, who chose not to
be identified. "We are very much
concerned about the state of the
country."
He said that students from

seven countries, including his na
tive Iran, would be required to
have a "more thorough back
ground check" — estimated to be
at least two to three months — be
fore each exit and re-entry into the
United States.
"It's practically impossible for us
to travel... to visit families or go to
conferences," he said.
"A lot of foreign students here
are graduate students, and we felt
it was in touch to get in touch with
undergrads, too," he said, explain
ing his decision to speak to the Sen
ate. The matter was assigned to the
Advocacy Committee, which will
meet today about the matter.
"What we are tiying to do is
make this proposal and have it
seen by important people," he said.
