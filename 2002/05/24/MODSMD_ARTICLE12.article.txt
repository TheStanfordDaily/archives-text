# Fountain hopping a popular Stanford spring tradition
## 
### JENNY MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's spring again — that time when friends on
the East Coast no longer begrudge us for our sun,
when love is in the air and when waterfowl can be
spotted in White Plaza. It is also a time for an ac
tivity that has become second nature for students
on the Farm : fountain hopping.
This popular Stanford tradition consists of
running from fountain to fountain, submerging
oneself into the refreshing water and splashing
around.
The practice is popular after sporting events,
on sunny afternoons, on birthdays and for frater
nity inductions.
Stanford is home to at least 16 fountains, all of
which feature unique qualities to attract frolick
ing (and procrastinating) students.
Junior Anita Idiculla, a regular fountain hop
per, said that White Plaza's Claw fountain is good
fora springtime hop because "there's a duck fam
ily that lives there."
The fountain's location, next to the bustling
plaza, also makes it an exciting place to fountain
hop for many students.
"It's right in the middle of things," said senior
Ed Roster. "I love making a spectacle. I love hav
ing people who have never seen [fountain hop
ping] before see it for the first time and smile."
Idiculla's favorite fountain, however, is the

Old Union fountain.
"It's always clean, kind of deep, and it's really
easy to get a whirlpool going," she said.
Creating a whirlpool is another aspect of foun
tain hopping that many students enjoy.
"Everyone fills the fountain and then runs
around in a circle. Once the water is going fast
enough you sit down and float with everyone
around the fountain," said junior Brian Quis
torff.
While fountain hopping may be done individ
ually, students usually go fountain hopping in
groups.
And who can forget the Stanford Band's
spring fountain rally? At the annual event, wack
ily-attired band members visit every major foun
tain, simultaneously splashing and playing
music.
Though fountain hopping is a popular aspect
of Stanford life today, this has not always been the
case.
John Bravman, Vice Provost for Undergrad
uate Education and B.S. 1979, said, "I'm fairly
confident that this was not a well-known thing in
the late '70s.
"Peoplejumped in fountains, but it wasn't like
a, 'I ley let's get a bunch of people together and go
do this' sort of thing," Bravman said.
Bravman speculated that the practice proba
bly wasn't named until at least the early '80s.
Although many students may describe foun

lain hopping as an inextricable part of what
makes Stanford Stanford, fountains do not ap
pear to have been part of the original plans for
the University.
In designing the campus, Jane and Leland
Stanford instead concentrated mainly on build
ings, choosing a style known as Richardsonian
Romanesque, a blend of Romanesque and Mis
sion Revival styles.
University Architect David Neuman hypothe
sized that Stanford's fountains most likely devel
oped from this mission heritage. California mis
sions carried on the tradition of Spanish/Moorish
architecture, which often featured fountains,
Neuman explained.
Though the Old Union fountain was built ac
cording to traditional mission style, most Stan
ford fountains were not created simply for aes
thetic appeal.
"A lot of [fountains] have been constructed in
memory of people," said University Archivist
Maggie Kimball.
The Claw, officially White Memorial Foun
tain, was donated in honor of two brothers from
the class of 1949, Kimball said. Its unique bronze
and copper sculpture, which earned the fountain
its nickname, was designed by artist Aristides
Demitrios for the 1964 dedication.
The fountain in front ofGreen Library's Bing
Wing was donated by four separate graduating
classes from the '20s and '30s, Kimball said.
