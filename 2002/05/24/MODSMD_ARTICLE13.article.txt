## The 						Stanford Daily SAT revision needed to remove inequality in test 
### 
Published Since 1891

It appears that the College Board is final
ly prepared to respond to a grounds well
of discontent in the higher-education
community by restructuring its übiqui
tous SAT I test. The possible changes detailed
by the board in a meeting with the University
of California Board of Regents last week in
clude adding a writing sample and a multiple
choice grammar section, expanding the range
of material covered by the mathematics sec
tions and eliminating the infamous analogies
section. We believe the proposed changes
would effectively address some of the test's
most pressing flaws and we encourage Stan
ford and other universities to lend their sup
port to the board's proposals.
Critics have long maintained that the SAT
discriminates against students from low-in
come backgrounds, often on the grounds that
the emphasis on obscure vocabulary words

gives an edge to those whose educational back
grounds bring them into regular contact with
such words or whose parents' pocketbooks
allow them to enroll in pricey SAT-preparation
courses. Students who take courses such as the
Princeton Review often improve their scores
by over one hundred points, in essence giving
them the chance to buy their way into a more
prestigious college. Eliminating the analogies
section seems like a natural next step to meet
ing these concerns, following the board's deci
sion to nix the antonyms section in 1993.
Moreover, this move will make room for
some sorely needed writing assessment in the
standardized test. At present, it seems silly for
a test that is supposed to predict students' apti
tude for college-level academics to ignore the
most essential component of college-level eval
uation. While some fear that the subjectivity in
herent in grading writing samples will detract

from the board's otherwise objective assess
ment techniques, the board will likely focus on
uncontroversial basic elements such as struc
ture and syntax. The writing sample would
also re-introduce vocabulary assessment in a
much more relevant form than that of the
analogies section.
The overall trend toward broadened curric
ular content should also serve to make the set
of tested skills more robust, a change that
would help in ameliorating the perception that
SAT performance has little basis in real scholas
tic aptitude.
Civen the remarkable influence of the SAT I
in the world of college admissions, it is essential
that the board progressively modify and im
prove the test to meet the needs of academia. Of
course, it is also important that colleges refrain
from overemphasizing standardized tests in
their admissions decisions. No test, no matter

how comprehensive or accurate a predictor, can
substitute for actual achievement in school and
extracurricular endeavors.
While the SAT clearly plays a significant role
in the Office of Undergradate Admissions' se
lections —as exemplified by the fact that 75 per
cent of Stanford students score a 1360 or high
er—we commend the office on its admirable
job of emphasizing achievement in other are
nas that improve and diversify campus life.
However, at a time when the notoriously unre
sponsive College Board truly seems prepared
to listen to the concerns of the higher education
community, we feel it is important that Stanford
and its peer institutions contribute to the dis
cussion in any way possible. We believe that the
changes currently under consideration consti
tute an adequate and welcome response to the
test's bias toward students from affluent back
grounds.
