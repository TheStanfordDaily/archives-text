# THE 						FRIDAY COLUMN
## Party like it's 1999

Two years ago, virtually every other
person at Stanford had a business
plan that was destined to make
millions, or billions, by age 25.
Everywhere you went, you'd hear peo
ple discussing who was getting funded by
which venture capitalist. At Meyer, you'd
hear a guy recruiting his classmates to join
his startup. At the Coffee House, you'd see
someone showing off a PowerPoint pre
sentation to convince some rich investor to
back him or her. At a computer lab, you'd
be accosted by recruiters trying to lure you
to their dot-coms.
Now, those heady days are fading from
memory. This year's freshmen and first
year graduate students completely missed

out on the crazy times, and
the second-year students
witnessed just the tail end.
I doubt any advisors are
telling their advisees, "If
you can sit up in a chair,
you'll be hired," as my
freshman advisor told me.
Given the downturn of
the economy, you don't

hear much anymore about student en
trepreneurs, except in the context of 20-
year-old chief executive officers returning
to school.
But my friends Nikhil and David are
entrepreneurs nonetheless. Through
their work, they're demonstrating Silicon
Valley's entrepreneurial spirit at its best.
Senior Nikhil Bhatla is a product design
major and his partner in crime, senior
David Salinas, is an English major. These
two enterprising seniors, along with grad
uated senior Tunlin Ou, are the creators
of the online swap system Share.
Share (http://share.stanford.edu) start
ed as Bookshare one year ago. Launched
by roommates Ou and Bhatla, its goal is to
address the perennial student complaint
about textbook costs. Users specify what
books they are willing to lend and what
books they would like to borrow for the
quarter. The software behind the site
looks for matches between lenders and
borrowers, giving priority to borrowers
who have offered the most for loan.
This year, encouraged by the success of
the service last spring, Bhatla and Salinas
added Movieshare and Musicshare under
the umbrella of Share.
BhatJa's and Salinas' prime motivation is
certainly not wealth, but rather, in the
words of Bhatla, to "build community" and
help their fellow students "save money."
Bhatla says his old roommate complained
about having to buy books every quarter for
just one quarter of use and asked, "Why do
we pay this much to fill up shelf space, basi
cally?" They couldn't come up with a gtxnJ
answer, and so Share was born.
Though most students remain unaware
of it, Share has 653 registered users. Ac
cording to Bhatla and Salinas, it has saved
users a total of about $ 14,000 over the past
year, or an average of $38 per loan. As they
look towards life after graduation, the two

have been looking to license their software
to student associations at other schools.
They are looking at the UC-Irvine as a
prime candidate to be the first to adopt the
service.
What are Bhatla and Salinas going to
do after graduation? Guess. "The ultimate
goal is to start something up," says Salinas,
although not in the immediate future.
This time their target will not be the Stan
ford Bookstore, but the $40 billion music
industry. Salinas will be returning to his
Chicago home after Commencement and
Bhatla will be going back to Los Angeles.
But they will continue working on an idea
to revolutionize the way music is sold.
"The music industry is in a rut," says Sali
nas, who wants to "help artists get more
money" while "let[t.ing] people listen to gcx>d
music."
Bhatla and Salinas, doing what we're all
supposed to be doing, have truly found
their passion and they're pursuing it de
spite the long odds. Taking on a multibil
lion dollar industry is no small task. Shad
owed by the ghosts of companies like Nap
ster, it's harder than setting up an online
swap system or even than selling pet food
online
Bhatla could be a product designer and
receive a steady paycheck. Salinas, despite
the jokes about English majors, could find
something to do, too. Why would they
take the risk of entrepreneurship?
"How many reasons are there?" an
swers Salinas with a rhetorical question.
"We've always been up for starting
something," explains Bhatla, citing "the
need to do something new, to be indepen
dent, and also have complete control."
"The sense of fulfillment you get from
working for yourself is something you
can't get anywhere else. It's magical," elab
orates Salinas, adding that the work
"comes from the heart."
Bhatla and Salinas are just recent initi
ates into a long line of entrepreneurs, in
cluding a long line of Stanford en
trepreneurs. Naivete may be a fair charge
to make against them, but that is perhaps
a requisite for taking risk.
Bhatla's and Salinas's next venture may
or may not succeed. The chances of it joining
the pantheon of major companies founded
by Stanford graduates, such as Sun Mi
crosystems, Charles Schwab, Yahoo and
(ioogle, are small, to be generous. But they
will have attempted to realize their dream
and done what they loved. Not all the
wealth-seekers of two years ago, driven by vi
sions of quick and easy st<x k market glory,
can say that.
Federal ReseiTe Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan says the economy is on the
mend and Bhatla and Salinas are making it
seem downright retro. Don't be surprised if
one of them shows up not t<x> far into the
future at a job fair recruiting you to work
for their creation.
