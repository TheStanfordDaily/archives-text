Living wage for Bon Appetit Workers
We support the proposed Code of Con
duct for Stanford Employees, which calls
for equal pay rates and comparable bene
fits packages for all employees on the Stan
ford University campus, including sub
contracted employees. We are therefore
disappointed that labor negotiations with
Bon Appetit are going poorly and that the
Bon Appetit management is unwilling to
consider a living wage and adequate
healthcare coverage for its workers.
During his recent visit to campus, Jesse
Jackson advised the Stanford community,
"Fight for their living wage and you are
fighting for your own character." We urge
President Hennessy to promote equal
treatment for all workers at Stanford and
to work with Bon Appetit, as he did with
the janitorial subcontracting firm at Stan
ford Hospital last fall, to ensure a living
wage and adequate benefits for Bon Ap
petit employees.

Equal wages for Bon Appetit and
Stanford Dining Services employees
Like many in this community, I am
concerned about what I have heard about
wage disparities between Bon Appetit
workers and those hired directly by Stan
ford Dining Services. According to the
Stanford Labor Action Coalition, Bon Ap

petit employees start at almost $2 per hour
lower than Stanford employees who do
the same work ($8.50 versus $ 10.30). A liv
ing wage policy is undermined if it ex
empts any categoiy of workers, as this one
apparently excludes unionized employees
of subcontractors.
From what I have been able to gather,
the administration responded to the con
cerns of the United Stanford Workers
(SEIU Local 715) about its subcontracting
policies by announcing a living wage poli
cy that would cover subcontracted work
ers, but only if they are not unionized.
Such policies have the effect of discourag
ing union membership among subcon
tracted workers, and of undermining the
union for directly hired employees.
All Stanford workers should make a liv
ing wage and they should not give up that
right just because they choose to be repre
sented by a union. I hope that President
Hennessy and the university administra
tion will use their influence to ensure that
Bon Appetit workers receive wages at par
ity with those of Stanford employees.

Debauchery at Sweet Hall
In response to Corinne Purtill's char
acterization of Sweet Hall as a foretaste
of Hell: whether you're a fuzzy or a
techie, you simply haven't lived until
you've been chased around on a rolling

chair by someone brandishing a piece of
day-old artichoke pizza. This type of
madcap tomfoolery happens all the time
in Sweet Hall, and entirely makes lip for
the beige-on-beige-on-beige color
scheme. If you see someone walking
across campus who smells vaguely like
death and appears to be wiping pizza
sauce off of her ear, you may wonder
what that cramped-up feeling in the pit
of your stomach is. It's jealousy, jealousy
because you, unlike that lucky girl, were
stuck on the "outside" of that mysterious,
wonderful world that investigative re
porters can never truly penetrate.
