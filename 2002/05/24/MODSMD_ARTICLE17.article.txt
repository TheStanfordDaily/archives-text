# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Senior Gift campaign flexible, supports many programs 
### RENUKA GEORGE, PEI-PEI LIN, TEA TRUMBIC, PATRICK CROSETTO NICK LARSON SENIOR GIFT CHAIRS 
We greatly appreciate the editorial board's
piece in Wednesday's Daily supporting
the Senior Gift program and suggesting
ways to improve our solicitation strategy.
As was clearly stated in the article, the Se
nior Gift program is a way for all seniors to
participate in the important endeavor of
ensuring that "our unique undergraduate
experiences will exist for future genera
tions of Stanford students." All suggestions
of how to better achieve that common ob

jective are welcomed.
The article suggests that the main prob
lem with the campaign is that the money
does not go toward any "specific end." in
stead, it is suggested that the senior class be
presented with a list of needs from which it
can vote upon a specific project. We do not
deny that this is an attractive concept in
theory. However, it would be a far less ef
fective way to maintain Stanford's strong
undergraduate tradition if put into prac
tice.
All gifts given to the Senior Gift and
Pledge campaign are allocated to the Stan
ford Fund and applied directly to under
graduate education. The fund puts ap

proximately 50 percent of all money
raised into financial aid, and applies the
other 50 percent to support undergradu
ate programs such as Freshman and
Sophomore Seminars, Sophomore Col
lege, Overseas Studies and Undergradu
ate Research Opportunity grants.
The flexibility allowed by Senior Gift
and Pledge is one of its most vital assets,
placing no restraints on the undergradu
ate needs to which the money can be ap
plied. Unfortunately, maintaining Stan
ford's undergraduate excellence is not
simply a case of selecting the single most
important initiative months in advance. It
is true that the current structure of the

campaign does not lead to an end that one
can point to and say, "I did that." Instead,
it contributes to more programs than one
could ever point to.
The article also speculates that the gift
is spent on the following year's cam
paign. In fact, the expenses incurred in
supporting the Senior Gift program are
paid from the operating budget of the
Office of Development. Seniors are not
giving gifts that fund campaigns. They
are supporting undergraduate educa
tion, period.
Finally, the board states that overly ag
gressive tactics are used, making students
feel as if they are "walking wallets." In

truth, any contacts or conversations initi
ated by our campaign are focused on edu
cating seniors about Senior Gift and
Pledge. The number of students who ap
proach us with the question, "What exact
ly are we buying?" causes concern that the
true meaning of their gifts may not be fully
understood.
We greatly appreciate the Daily's cover
age of Senior Gift and Pledge and fully re
alize that no senior is obligated to give. We
hope that Stanford students realize that
their contributions truly do go toward a
good cause and strongly encourage any
one with questions or suggestions to stop
by and visit us in White Plaza during lunch.
