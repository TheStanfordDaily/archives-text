## Stanford men still alive at individuals 
### JERRY LU STAFF WRITER 
With its second-round loss in the NCAA
Team Championships still stinging, the Stan
ford men's tennis team has responded with a
vengeance in the Singles Championship.
All three of the Cardinal players advanced to
the Round of 32 by virtue of their convincing
first-round wins on Wednesday at Texas A & M
University in College Station, Texas.

MEN'S TENNIS
Yesterday: Haviland d. Junaid, 6-2, 6-2,
Wetten d. Lipsky, 6-4,7-6(5), Martin d. Vlas
ki, 7-5, 3-6, 7-6(2).
Today: Hayiland v. Wagner, Martin v.
Garland, Martin-Lipsky vs. Hornung-Mc-
Gregor, Texas A&M Tennis Center, College
Station, Texas

"It's really tough not to be here as a team,"
junior Scott Lipsky said. "So we're doing the
best we can as individuals."
Especially impressive in Wednesday's victo
ries was junior Ryan Haviland, who upset 7th
seeded Romain Ambert of Mississippi State, 5-
7, 6-3, 6-2, in his first ever appearance at the
NCAAs.
Fellow juniors Lipsky and David Martin
posted easy straight-set wins over their respec
tive opponents. Lipsky, also debuting at the
NCAAs, crushed Florian Marquardt of Virginia
Commonwealth, 6-1, 6-4, while Martin domi
nated Gert Vilms of Brigham Young, 6-3, 6-0.
Yesterday, the three Stanford stalwarts
faced another host of opponents. In second
round action, Lipsky fell to 4th-seeded Jessen
Witten of Kentucky, 6-4,7-6(5), in a closely con
tested match.
Haviland continued his red-hot play with a
6-2, 6-2 pounding of Rameez Junaid of
Auburn. He faces Brandon Wagner of Georgia
later today.
Martin also displayed tremendous staying
power with his 7-5, 3-6,7-6(2) victory over Alex
Vlaski of Washington. Vlaski, the Huskies' top

ranked player, was instrumental in knocking
the Cardinal out of the Team Championships
almost two weeks ago.
Martin, no stranger to the rigors of the
NCAA tournament, will face one of the tougher
challenges of this week as he squares off against
sth-seeded A1 Garland of Pepperdine. Martin
lost to Garland in a stinging three-set match
during Stanford's dual match against the
Waves on April 16.
The main draw is still relatively intact after

two rounds of play. Four of the top five seeds
are still competing in the tournament, in
cluding top seed Matias Boeker of Georgia.
Boeker, the defending singles champion,
topped Martin in the first round of last year's
tournament.
In doubles, Lipsky and Martin, seeded sec
ond, defeated Tennessee's Simon Rea and
Mark Toledo, 6-4,6-4 in the first round yester
day. They face Markus Hornung and Nathan
McGregor of Baylor today.
