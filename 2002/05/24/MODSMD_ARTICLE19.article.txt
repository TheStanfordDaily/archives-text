### MATT BABIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In early May, men's golf team
head coach Jeff Mitchell described
Stanford's season as "more of a roller
coaster than I had expected." It was a
ride that ended last week at the
NCAA West Regionals.
Looking back, it is clear diat the
Cardinal's season was Rill of ups and
downs. A proud program with high
expectations, the Cardinal headed
into the fall season with the memory
of last year's trip to die NCAA Na
tional Championships still fresh in its
mind.
'Hie first tournament of the fall
presented an immediate challenge to
the Cardinal, however, as the team
finished in 10th place at the Husky
Invitational, hosted by Washington.
In what would prove to be his trade
mark for the season, senior Phil
Rowe was Stanford's highest finisher
as he took ninth place.
The team bounced light back
from the disappointing start, howev
er, as it stormed through the field to
take second place in a field of 16
teams at the Fresno Invitational.
The Cardinal brought its strong
play back home later that month as
they competed at the Nelson Invita
tional at the Stanford C»olf Course.
The team, led by the third place fin
ish of junior Jim Seki and the fourth
place finish of Rowe, found them
selves with another second place
mark at the end of the three day tour
nament.
After the two successive strong
outings, the team finished the fell on

the squad were again Seki and Rowe,

West Coast schools that were waiting
eagerly for the spring schedule.
The spring season began with a
trip to Hawaii for the laylor

Made/Waikoloa Intercollegiate.
The tournament gave the team a
chance to see where they stood after
half a season. While the team was se
curely in second place after two
rounds, the third and final day of
play brought them down to lltli
place — the same position they Oc
cupied at the end of the fall season at
the Prestige.
'I he team rebounded from the
match in Hawaii to turn in two strong
finishes at the Cleveland (Jolf Classie
in Westlake Village, CA, and the Ore

At the Cleveland, the Cardinal
saw the first signs of clutch play from
sophomore Blake Mastalir, who led
the team with a 13th-place finish.
In Eugene, Rowe again pacer 1 the

Unfortunately, the team was not
able to carry that momentum from
the matches into April as the roller

Oregon.

finish at the Western Intercollegiate,

place finish at the ASIJ/Savane Invi

It was then, only after the trip to
the desert, that the ride really
began. Faced with the prospect of
not making the postseason, a year
after making Nationals, the squad
responded to the pressure with
clutch play.
Mitchell's squad turned in second
place finishes at the U.S. Intercolle

Rowe and Seki, who t(*>k the indi

for next year's golf season. The Cardinal fell seven spots short of Nationals
this year, finishing 17th in the NCAA Western Regionals.

and the Pac-10 tournament, respec
tively.
It was their play that not only
earned them both spots on the All-
Conference First Team, but also
earned the team a spot in the NCAA
Western Regionals, a berth which
just a month previous had been in
question.

The Cardinal traveled to Albu
querque ready for their biggest c hal
lenge of the year, seeded 18th in a
field of 27 teams. The squad finished
the first day of play in 21st position,
and while improved play over the
second two days moved them up the
leaderboard, the effort fell shoit. The
team ended die tournament in 17th
place, seven spots back of the final bid
to Nationals.
So while the team returns home
earlier than they would have liked,
there is still plenty to celebrate and
look forward to next season.

The (Cardinal will lose only one se
nior, Rowe. The most consistent
player on the team, it was a rare
weekend that his name was not in
one of the top 10 spots on the leader
board.
The team will look to its juniors,
Seki and Ron Won, to take over for
Rowe. They appear ready for the
role as Seki will return next season as
the defending Pac-10 Individual
Champion.
The younger players are also a
reason to look towards the upcoming
season with excitement. Mastalir

turned in a fantastic spring, as he
posted four top-20 finishes in the
midst of tough competition. He will

growing resume next fall.
fhe freshmen of the squad, Kevin
Blue and Pat Phillips, are also bright
spots for the future. 1 he experience
they gained in the stretch drive this
last month will prove invaluable in
years to come.
The roller coaster, lor this year
then, has ended. Already, though,
the team and its fans look forward to
an even better ride next season.
