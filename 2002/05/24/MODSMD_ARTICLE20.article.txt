# Baseball plays for conference crown
## 
### MALCOLM LEVINE STAFF WRITER 
It has all come down to this, the
final weekend of the Stanford base
ball team's regular season. The No.
8 Cardinal (37-16, 13-8 Pacific 10
Conference) is knotted in a second
place tie with Washington (28-24-
1,13-8), just one game behind Pac
-10 leader No. 21 Southern Califor
nia (31-22, 14-7) and one game
ahead of No. 24 Arizona State (32-
19, 12-9).

Talk about an old-fashioned
pennant race — three teams sepa
rated by one game, four teams by
two games.
The conference title is so close
that all the players can taste it, but
nothing is certain as each team still
has three games left that could
swing a team three spots in the
standings.
For the Cardinal, the opponent
is last-place Washington State (21-
30, 6-15), which comes into
Sunken Diamond having lost nine
straight games to Stanford.
Given the heated race, the Car
dinal probably needs to stretch this
streak to 12 with a three-game
sweep if it wants any realistic shot at
taking the title.
Forget about scoreboard-watch
ing. The Cardinal just needs to go
out in front of its home crowd and

win baseball games.
"It's exciting to have four teams
still battling for the Pac-10 title
going into the final weekend of
Pac-10 play," said head coach Mark
Marquess about the jam-packed
conference standings. "But we just
need to play well in our series
against Washington State and let
the rest take care of itself."
Fortunately for Stanford, in
tonight's series opener, Marquess
will be sending to the mound ju
nior ace Jeremy Guthrie, probably
the nation's hottest pitcher.
Guthrie has been absolutely
dominating in recent weeks,
throwing four consecutive com
plete games while bringing his sea
son record to 9-1 with a 2.68 ERA
— statistics impressive enough for
Guthrie to garner one of the five
nominations for the Golden Spikes
Award, college baseball's version of
the I leisman Trophy.
In last week's win over UCLA
(26-31, 9-12), Guthrie threw nine
innings of shutout ball, striking out
13 batters without giving up a sin
gle walk, setting a career high in
strikeouts while getting his second
career shutout victory.
For this unbelievable perfor
mance, Guthrie was not only
named Pac-10 Pitcher of the Week,
but was also given Louisville Slug
ger National Player of the Week
honors.
Tonight, Guthrie will face a
Cougars team that, despite its pal
try record, has played fairly well on
the road during the conference
season, winning two of three games
at both UCLA and Arizona.
Surprisingly fora last place
team, the Cougars come into the
weekend with the third best batting
average (.321) in the league during
Pac-10 play, but, not surprisingly,
their pitching has been horren
dous, as is evident by their league
worst ERA (9.M4).
The Cardinal will look to capital
ize on the Cougars' sub-par staffwith
an offense that erupted last week,
scoring 44 inns in four games.
Sophomore centerfielder Sam
Fuld has led the charge over the
last couple weeks, going on an ab
solute tear that has raised his team
high batting average to .384, sec
ond best in the Pac-10.
In fact, Fuld has had more than
one hit. in 18 of his last 21 games, a
stretch in which he has batted .505
(46-91).
The Cardinal could use some

more of Fuld's clutch hitting this
weekend, as the team tries to mus
cle its way to the top of the crowd
ed league standings.
Tonight's crucial series opener
— which is the fourth annual Stan
ford Baseball Fireworks Night
sponsored by Palo Alto Town &
County Village — will pit Guthrie
against the Cougars' Eddie Bonine
(8-7, 6.11) at 6 p.m.
Saturday's game will get under
way at 1 p.m. as sophomore John
Hudgins (8-1,5.02) takes on Bran
don Hundt (6-6,4.72).
Sunday's game also begins at 1
p.m., as junior Tim Cunningham
(7-2, 3.96) might be throwing
against Washington State's Bryce
Chamberlain (0-1, 7.60) with the
Pac-10 title on the line.
As always, all three games will be
broadcast on KZSU9O.I FM.

Sunken Diamond
Sunday: No. 8 Stanford vs.
Washington State, 1:00 p.m.,
Sunken Diamond

Talk about an old-fashioned
pennant race — three teams sepa
rated by one game, four teams by
two games.
The conference title is so close
that all the players can taste it, but
nothing is certain as each team still
has three games left that could
swing a team three spots in the
standings.
For the Cardinal, the opponent
is last-place Washington State (21-
30, 6-15), which comes into
Sunken Diamond having lost nine
straight games to Stanford.
Given the heated race, the Car
dinal probably needs to stretch this
streak to 12 with a three-game
sweep if it wants any realistic shot at
taking the title.
Forget about scoreboard-watch
ing. The Cardinal just needs to go
out in front of its home crowd and

win baseball games.
"It's exciting to have four teams
still battling for the Pac-10 title
going into the final weekend of
Pac-10 play," said head coach Mark
Marquess about the jam-packed
conference standings. "But we just
need to play well in our series
against Washington State and let
the rest take care of itself."
Fortunately for Stanford, in
tonight's series opener, Marquess
will be sending to the mound ju
nior ace Jeremy Guthrie, probably
the nation's hottest pitcher.
Guthrie has been absolutely
dominating in recent weeks,
throwing four consecutive com
plete games while bringing his sea
son record to 9-1 with a 2.68 ERA
— statistics impressive enough for
Guthrie to garner one of the five
nominations for the Golden Spikes
Award, college baseball's version of
the I leisman Trophy.
In last week's win over UCLA
(26-31, 9-12), Guthrie threw nine
innings of shutout ball, striking out
13 batters without giving up a sin
gle walk, setting a career high in
strikeouts while getting his second
career shutout victory.
For this unbelievable perfor
mance, Guthrie was not only
named Pac-10 Pitcher of the Week,
but was also given Louisville Slug
ger National Player of the Week
honors.
Tonight, Guthrie will face a
Cougars team that, despite its pal
try record, has played fairly well on
the road during the conference
season, winning two of three games
at both UCLA and Arizona.
Surprisingly fora last place
team, the Cougars come into the
weekend with the third best batting
average (.321) in the league during
Pac-10 play, but, not surprisingly,
their pitching has been horren
dous, as is evident by their league
worst ERA (9.M4).
The Cardinal will look to capital
ize on the Cougars' sub-par staffwith
an offense that erupted last week,
scoring 44 inns in four games.
Sophomore centerfielder Sam
Fuld has led the charge over the
last couple weeks, going on an ab
solute tear that has raised his team
high batting average to .384, sec
ond best in the Pac-10.
In fact, Fuld has had more than
one hit. in 18 of his last 21 games, a
stretch in which he has batted .505
(46-91).
The Cardinal could use some

more of Fuld's clutch hitting this
weekend, as the team tries to mus
cle its way to the top of the crowd
ed league standings.
Tonight's crucial series opener
— which is the fourth annual Stan
ford Baseball Fireworks Night
sponsored by Palo Alto Town &
County Village — will pit Guthrie
against the Cougars' Eddie Bonine
(8-7, 6.11) at 6 p.m.
Saturday's game will get under
way at 1 p.m. as sophomore John
Hudgins (8-1,5.02) takes on Bran
don Hundt (6-6,4.72).
Sunday's game also begins at 1
p.m., as junior Tim Cunningham
(7-2, 3.96) might be throwing
against Washington State's Bryce
Chamberlain (0-1, 7.60) with the
Pac-10 title on the line.
As always, all three games will be
broadcast on KZSU9O.I FM.
