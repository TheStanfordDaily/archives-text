# Little thrives in clutch

### DANIEL URBAN STAFF WRITER 
" I feel like I thrive when my back
is against the wall," junior Milton
Little says.
Not only with his own back
against the wall, but with the Cardi
nal's hopes riding on his shoulders,
Little has been one of the Stanford
track squad's best performers in the
clutch.
By delivering crucial points in
the triple jump during the final mo
ments oflast year's Big Meet against
California, scoring in four separate
events at this year's rematch for an
other Cardinal victory over the
Bears and landing an upset victory
in the longjump at this year's Pacif
ic 10 Conference Championships,
Little has proven that he comes up
big when it matters most.
"There are so many times when
you're put in a high pressure situa
tion," Little said. "Sometimes you
pull it out, and sometimes you
don't, but at least if you go for it,
you'll never have that 'what if feel
ing in the back of your mind."
Though he is a Big Meet hero
and a Pac-10 champion, track and
field wasn't on Lit tie's agenda com
ing into Stan fold, much less the
long jump, his main event. Little
was a prep star in basketball, foot
ball, and track, but did not know
what he would compete in at Stan
ford.
In fact, while Little said he
hoped to play some sport in college,
athletics did not play a huge role in
his college selection.
"I chose Stanford for the acade
mics and the laid back feel of the
campus," Little said. "I went to
boarding school on the Last Coast,
and after high school it was time for

a change of pace, so I decided to
come back to California."
The change of pace didn't mean
a lax academic schedule. A 2001
Pac-10 Track and Field All-Acade
mic selection, Little is majoring in
biology and plans to go to medical
school.
Despite coming to Stanford
without any specific athletic plans,
Little knew he couldn't stay away
from competition for long.
Encouraged by an athlete dur
ing his admit weekend visil to try to
walk on to the track team, Little de
rided to give it a shot.
"I long jumped for one year of
high school, but 1 played fmtball

and basketball for almost my entire
life," Little explained. "[Jumping at
Stanford] was kind of a fluke. At
first [the coaches and 1] really didn't
know what I was going to do, but
we finally we decided on long jump
and here I am. I never would've ex
pected this at any point in my life."
The course of Litde's athletic ca
reer did not match his own expec
tations, and he has exceeded every
one else's, t<x), progressing fiom a
walk-on to a Pac-10 champion and
NCAA competitor.
