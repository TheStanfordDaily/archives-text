# Card seeks national title

### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Combining just the right amounts of athleti
cism, style, spirit and partying, Ultimate is far
and away the granddaddy of club sports.
This makes the Stanford Ultimate teams'
opportunity fora sweep of the men's and
women's national titles all the more incredible.
That feat has only been accomplished by one
school, UC-Santa Barbara, which has done it
twice, in 1988 and 1990.
Bloodthirsty and Superfly — the Stanford
men's and women's teams, respectively — will
get their shot today through Sunday at the Ul
timate Players .Association College Champi
onships in Spokane, Wash.
"There are over 200 teams out there," said
graduate student Mike Whitaker, Blood
thirsty's defensive expert. "It would be incredi
ble to be a national champion at anything, and
I just think about how good of a shot we have at

it this year."
Bloodthirsty is making its grand return to
the national tournament after missing out last
year for the first time since 1993. The Stanford
men have made it to the national finals five
times since winning the inaugural national title
in 1984, but a second national championship
has remained elusive.
Stanford looks to have a good shot at taking
it all this year as Bloodthirsty enters the cham
pionships as the No. I seed, following its title at
the Northwest Regionals earlier this month.
" The key for us will be to maintain focus and
keep a good work ethic," said Bloodthirsty
coach Mike Payne. "It's an often-quoted saying
in Ultimate that 'no one remembers who wins
Regionals,' meaning that what matters is who
goes home with the Nationals trophy."
With a number of players making their final
run at nationals and a 31-1 record against col
lege teams this year, Bloodthirsty heads to
Spokane not only as (he most proven team

there, but also perhaps as the hungriest.
"We are a run and gun team because of our
deep core of athletic receivers and a lot of our
success will hinge on how much of our athletic
edge we've maintained over other teams," said
graduate student Jit Bhattacharya, the team's
main handler. "Nationals is about who wants it
most, and I've seen this team play with more
heart and more desire than I've ever seen in
four years of Stanford Ultimate."
Superfly heads to nationals looking to im
prove on last year's unexpected national run
ner-up finish.
After winning three straight titles from 1997
to 1999, the team started a rebuilding process
that many thought would take a few years to
complete. But when the team ended up in the
national title game against Georgia last year, it
was clear that Superfly was back on the nation
al stage.
Superfly did not make nearly as much noise
during the regular season as Bloodthirsty did,
but the team earned the No. 3 seed at nationals
by taking the Northwest Regional title.
"We don't have as much recognition or re
spect around the country as we should," said se
nior Erin Percival, one of the team's captains.
"We know we're up there as one of the best
teams, but we really need to earn it at nationals.
If we play our best, we can beat every team
there."
Thirteen players return from last year's
squad, giving Superfly one of the deepest ros
ters in the country. The team's captains — Per
cival, junior Gwen Ambler and senior Jamie
Nuwer — have been a strong guiding force for
the team, landing all three on the UFA All-
Northwest Region Team last week.
"Our depth is going to be a huge asset for us,
especially in the later games," said sophomore
Karen Milch, one of the team's top receivers.
"No other team is as deep as we are, and in a
three-day tournament, that will show."
