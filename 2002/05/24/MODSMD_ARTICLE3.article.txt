# GSC chairs promote interaction

### SARAH LUSTBADER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A month after being elected as co-chairs oft he
Graduate Student Council, Elizabeth Marin and
Grace Chang are optimistic about the year
ahead. Items on their agenda include represent
ing the interests of graduate students and pro
moting interaction among students from the
various schools.
Marin graduated from UC-San Diego and is
currently a third year doctorate student in bio
logical sciences. This past year, she served on the
Graduate Student Council as an elected member
at-large and as co-chair of the Graduate Housing
Advisory Committee and the Graduate Student
Programming Board.
Chang graduated from Stanford with a bach
elor's in Chemistry, stayed for her master's in
electrical engineering and is currently a medical
student here. In addition, she will soon receive
her doctorate in neuroscience from Caltech.
According to Marin, "Grace was one of the
non-elected active members last year and
worked on our health care taskforce along with
Ray Rivera and Lisa Wong. I think her experi
ence in healthcare issues should complement
mine in housing and social programming."
Chang intends to continue her work in health
care. "Health care has been my primary focus
this past year and will continue to be next year,"
Chang said. "There is still a lot of work which
needs to be done. For instance, 30 percent of
graduate students won't benefit from the subsi

dies, and all of us are st ill in need of dental care
and longer term mental health care coverage.
"Similarly, while, we have made significant ad
vances in the housing situation, hundreds of stu
dents aren't able to get on-campus housing. And
child-care is unaffordable and often unattainable
for graduate families," Chang said.
Marin, who has lived in Mountain View, Sun
nyvale and East Palo Alto, as well as in Escondi
do Village and Rains, plans to focus much atten
tion to graduate student housing.
"I will continue to advocate for better housing
options for graduate students. The University
plans to raise rents on campus by an average of 8
percent, expand the off-campus subsidized pro

gram and gradually eliminate the housing
stipend program," she said in her campaign
statement.
"A better solution would be to redesign the
lottery as recommended in our survey report, al
lowing students to choose their preferred option
— on campus, off campus, or stipend check —
while allowing the University to adjust the sys
tem to meet demand," Marin said.
Marin also hopes to improve housing options
for students with special needs, such as those with
partners who work outside the Palo Alto area and
those with pets. She said that she experienced
