# 'Seeing Her Again' a 'Pleasure' indeed

More tribute and mini
play than full theatrical
experience, " For the Plea
sure of Seeing Her Again"
still delivers enjoyable and
satisfying insights. Ameri
can Conservatory The
ater's current production

of Quebec's leading contemporary
dramatist, Michael Tremblay, features
Olympia Dukakis, of"Moonstruck"(l9B7)
fame, as "the mother" and Marco Barri
celli as the "son" / narrator.
"Pleasure," admits in the opening that
it offers no more than a portrait of a moth
er, so that the narrator can have "the plea
sure of seeing her again." Fortunately,

For the Pleasure of A)
Seeing Her Again"
Dir. Carey Perloff M \^n/)
The Geary Theatre

"she" is a memorable and charming char
acter. Shining with Dukakis's energy,

Nana's endearing
maternal melodra
ma and just-so mix
of eccentricities
carry the play. Nana
blends mothering
with the startling,
naive wisdom and

intelligence of the housewife.
The play's two hours, stretched tenu
ously by an intermission, are not felt, de
spite there being little more than
Dukakis's monologues to propel the play
forward. Yet, despite its clear and clean
comedy and its moments of tenderness,
the play is quite limited, though perhaps
by no more than its modest ambitions.

"Pleasure" debuted on Mother's Day, ap
propriate for its moments of uninspiring
sentimentality.
Perhaps the most interesting ques
tions raised by the play are the implicit
ones, questions of memory, nostalgia,
and the lenses through which we view
our loved ones. Tremblay, quoted in the
May 12, 2002 San Francisco Chronicle
says, "It's difficult to write about people
when they are alive. My mother was so
nice to me. She died in 1963, leaving me
alone to write."
Tremblay wrote "Pleasure" (original
French title "Encore Une Fois, Si Vous le
Permettez" â€” literally translated as: "one
more time, if you'll allow it") in 1998,
decades into his success and fame, and
decades after his mother's death. He

openly expresses regret at her not having
lived to see his success, and we can only as
sume that his appreciation for her has
grown through the years since.
Could he have written the same eulogy
while she was still living? Can we write
such a eulogy for our still living parents?
Could we write it tor them years after
their deaths?
When Barricelli finishes his opening
monologue and Nana first enters, she
shimmers between states: she is a conjura
tion of Tremblay's memory, she is his
mother as real as when she was living, and
she is real, darting pupils and all, on stage
on Geary Street. In that shimmering lies
the thrust of the play, the fuel-gem. In
which of those three Ilickerings can we see
our pasts, our presents, and our mothers?
