"Attack of the Clones," chronologi
cally the second and in George Lucas'
six-movie "Star Wars" saga, is unlike
any other movie you have ever seen.
This is because the film was entirely
shot not on film stock, but rather on
special digital video cameras Lucas had
made just for this film. "Attack of the

Clones," however, is also unlike any other Star Wars movie
you have ever seen. This is because the immense scope that
"Clones" encompasses, particularly in its final act, surpasses
anything seen previously in not only just Star Wars films, but
in any wars ever put onto film. When such epic visual splen
dor is coupled with the pure entertainment factor of an old
school, knowingly cheesy, serial adventure made on a multi
million dollar budget, it all makes for an end-result that, while
certainly not flawless, successfully captures the wide-eyed
charm that made the original "Star Wars" trilogy so ridicu
lously fun.
As a space opera on a galactic scale, storytelling is what has
always driven the Star Wars films, and "Clones" lays the po
litical intrigue and underhanded scheming on thick. For the
uninitiated or uninterested, Lucas's careful and multi-lay
ered narrative unfolding of such details may prove to be te
dious. "Bring on the inevitable climactic lightsaber duel!" the
layperson-filmgoer will exclaim. "Who the hell cares about
the mystery surrounding the outbreak of civil war in the Re
public?"
But for the rest of the audience, who comprise a massive
worldwide base of Star Wars fanatics and those hoping
"Clones" will be better than 1999's "The Phantom Menace,"
these are the glorious details that continue to fill in all of the
missing pieces left open from the former films, thereby re
vealing the beauty of this prequel trilogy — its function of
adding depth, playing against expectation and shedding new
light upon already-established characters and already-oc
curred events.
'Hie second chapter of the "Star Wars" trilogy plays out 10
years after the events of "The Phantom Menace." The life of
the former queen of Naboo, Padme Atnidala (Natalie Port
man), is in danger due to her political ideologies. She remains
an outspoken critic of a proposed Military Creation Act in the
Senate, regardless of the increasing threat of an armed sepa
ratist movement acting under the leadership ofa former Jedi
named Count Dooku (Christopher Lee). After an assassina
tion attempt on Padme's lite by an unknown attacker,
Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (lan McDiarmid) places her
under the guard of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and
his apprentice, the now-teenage Anakin Skywalker (Hayden
Christensen).
But the film doesn't really pick up until the master and ap
prentice are split up once the Jedi Council assigns Obi-Wan on
a mission to discover the senator's would-be killer. Obi-Wan is

much more fleshed out this time around
— a Master in his own right who can order

a drink at a bar and Jedi
mind-trick a drug dealer all
in the same breath. He's not
acting as a young Alec Guin
ness, but rather as a young
Obi-Wan Kenobi. His ex

with Christopher Lee's

Count Dooku are immediately classic, and
Lee even out-villains his turn as Saruman
in last December's "The Lord of the
Rings" while thanking the movie-gods
that he somehow scored roles in two of the
coolest epic fantasy film series ever.
Meanwhile, Anakin escorts Padme
back to Naboo to hide, where some ques
tionable J edi-Senator flirting ensues. The
much-hyped "romance" between Anakin
and Padme, however, is more akin to a

one-sided obsession, with newcomer Christensen portraying
Anakin as alternately whiny- and creepy-stalker-guy. The di
alogue and chemistry between Portman and Christensen is
somewhat hit-and-miss, meaning the tongue-in-cheek banter
of Han and Leia has been replaced by over-earnest confes
sions of tortured teenage souls. At the film's end, one still has
to question the authenticity of Padme's being in love with
Anakin. We can all understand why he loves her — she is,
after all, Natalie Portman with a blaster rifle — but her love for
him is less believable, and this definitely hurts the film.
But guess what? The problematic romantic subplot doesn't
even matter in the end. Because this movie is Star Wars all
over again, bringing along with it the dark edge of " The Em
pire Strikes Back," which is a good thing indeed. "Attack of the
Clones" has decapitations and severed limbs galore, as well as

a more menacing visual style that not only matches Anakin's
slow turn to the Dark Side, but also allows the viewer to visu
ally recognize the Republic's slow turn into the Empire of the
original trilogy.
Though dark at times, the film is still mega-cool. "Star
Wars" is "Star Wars" because it has stuff like Boba Fett's boun
ty hunter pseudo-dad, Jango Fett, busting out the John Woo
style with double blasters in order to fight ofiObi-Wan's mad
lightsaber skills during a rain-soaked battle on the water plan
et of Kamino.
And that's not even getting to the nighttime speeder chase
through the neon-noir skyline of the Republic's capital city
planet Coruscant, or the gladiator-style arena executions on a
rock planet inhabited by winged alien insects who speak in
click-tones, or the always-at-the-end Jedi-versus-Sith
lightsaber contest, this time with cooler Force powers and mid
duel shit-talking (which was definitely missed in Episode I), al
though everybody will be wanting the lightsaber fight to last
about 20 more minutes than it does.
And even after all of that, I still haven't mentioned t he film's
highlight. To give it away to anyone who hasn't seen it yet
would be a travesty, but it involves the now lully-CGI Yoda.
Audiences will cheer, and ILM's animation team deserves ac
colades for proving once and for all why no one should ever
fuck with Yoda.
The "Star Wars"-obsessed will find even more to love about
this film, particularly in the way it links back to the original tril
ogy — through plot events, shot composition, dialogue, musi
cal score, character arcs, costume design, setting, thematic ties
... the list goes on and on. Lucas has truly crafted an intricate
universe of imaginative Force-powered splendor, watched
preferably on digital projection in a packed San Francisco the
ater. Only three more years of plot speculation until Episode
111, and then the circle will truly be complete.


I make this movie worth the nine bucks you had to shell out.
