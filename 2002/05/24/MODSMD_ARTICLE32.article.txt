# Straight Outta... Seoul?!?
## 
### JUNG LAH 
In Seoul, Korea, the hip hop scene has expanded into
a cultural phenomenon, producing hip hop artists that
can match skills with the best of their U.S counterparts.
Represented by such top acts as Cjß MASS, Drunken
Tiger and T (Tasha), all of whom command incredible
social influence, Korean hip hop music firmly stands as
the respectable and socially-conscious antithesis to an
often superficial and confused pop genre that pervades
the Korean music industry.
Tablo is an emcee who recently made his debut into
the Korean hip hop scene. Although his group, Epik
High, has yet to release a full-length album, the duo's col
laborations with top Korean hip hop acts have created a
noticeable buzz within the industry. Considering this an
ticipation surrounding Epik High's first record, due in
November of this year, it is somewhat surprising that just
a few months ago, Tablo was Daniel Armand Lee, a coter
minal student in the Stanford English department.
INTERMISSION: How did you go from writing litera
ture papers to writing rhymes?
LEE: I' ve done music fora long time. When I was 17,
I wrote a song with Kim Gun Mo, a singer who literal
ly has deity status over here in Korea. And 1 was part of
an underground hip hop group during my Stanford
years, so it's not like all of a sudden 1 decided that this

was my "call."
INTERMISSION: Who else is involved with Epik High?
LEE: The other half of Epik High is Mithrajin. Though
he's two years younger than I am, he's been featured on
over 11 major albums in Korea. Brilliant writer. I met
him a year ago at a freestyle contest in Seoul, which he
won, by the way. Then there's my producer J-Win, who's
a student at USC on break to do hip hop in Korea. He's
done incredible work with Drunken Tiger and CB Mass.
Our DJ's name isTuKutz, the boy with the magic fingers.
For our debut album, we'll be working with CB Mass,
Drunken Tiger, T and the likes. I'm blessed to be work
ing with these talented artists.
INTERMISSION: What would be the best way to de
scribe your music?
LEE: I guess you can call it "soulful." We're not doing the
whole "jiggy" or "bling bling" thing .. . that's just not us,
and personally, it would be a waste of time for me. Our
music is inspired by '60s and '70s soul music, both melod
ically and lyrically. We want listeners to nod their heads
because they enjoy the beats, but at the same time be
cause they are feeling our message.
INTERMISSION: Can you tell me about the current
state of the Korean hip hop scene?
LEE: It's getting there. Acts like Drunken Tiger and CB
Mass airlifted hip hop to an amazing level. That's proba
bly why the United States scene is showing so much in
terest in Korea now. CB Mass, for example, will be on DJ

Honda and EPMD's new albums. The form, at least, has
definitely been mastered now — the beats, the rhymes,
the performances, the look — it's indistinguishable from
the United States scene. The social relevance, however,
has a long way to go. The message is slowly catching up
to the medium.
INTERMISSION: What is the role of hip hop in Korea?
LEE: Hip hop is important for the same reason that it's
important in the U.S. Seoul is a heavily congested me
tropolis, which creates a lifestyle of emotional desolation.
I think hip hop's stress on a "one love" community of
young men and women can assist the efforts of social re
formers struggling to better city life. Of course, this is tlu
ideal role of hip hop . . . it's sadly ignored most of the
time, however. Hip hop is also important to Korea in a
cultural aspect. Because pop music has become the
norm — the lowest common denominator of Korean
culture — most listeners are indifferent to issues beyond
love, parties and fun, fun, fun. At the same time, in order
to cater to these audiences, pop artists barely ever talk
about anything thought-provoking. I lip hop artists such
as CB Mass, however, have criticized blind materialism,
political corruption and drug abuse in their music,
bringing to Korea, for maybe the first time, a "conscious"
music. What's interesting is that, unlike the United
States, where commercial-minded artists such as Jay-Z
rule, Korean hip hop would privilege artists such as
Common or Mos Def. That's a wonderful thing.
