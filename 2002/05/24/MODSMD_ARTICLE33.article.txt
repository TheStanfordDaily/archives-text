# The
						Moral: Extramarital sex is bad, BAD!

### KIM SAMEK 
If you're like me, you aren't expect
ing much of a plot from "Unfaithful."
Just a lot of great sex scenes and adul
terous affairs. However, if you're like
me, you'll also be proven wrong. Adrian
Lyne, who also directed the similarly
themed movies "Fatal Attraction," "ln-

decent Proposal" and "Lolita," presents a thoughtful cri
tique of suburban married life.
"Unfaithful" follows the lives of Connie (Diane Lane)
and Ed (Richard Gere), an affluent middle-aged couple
in the New York suburbs. Married for 11 years, they

have an eight-year-old son and a gorgeous home in a
quiet neighborhood. All seems well for about five min
utes, until Connie is caught up in a strong windstorm
during a regular trip into the city. And who appears to
rescue her but Paul (Olivier Martinez), a handsome
Frenchman who is in all ways the polar opposite of her
husband: young, charming, intellectual and sexually
deviant.
So, she has an affair with him. Although she attempts
to walk away from him in his Soho flat a few times, she

simply cannot resist his allure. She soon finds herself
making up excuses for frequent trips into the city. Paul

explores her boundaries, experiment
ing with S&M and all sorts of other tech
niques we only get glimpses of. Their
sexual appetites for each other are
never satiated — they do it in the bath
room stall of a cafe, in a movie theater
during a French film, in the hallway and

countless times in his bed.
Despite the frequent sex scenes, we are shown little
skin. Instead, Lyne chooses to focus on Connie's moral
struggles as her son and husband take a back seat to her
mid-life crisis. Diane Lane gives a rich performance as

Connie — sexy and multi-layered. She truly car
ries the movie, realistically portraying the
human side of a housewife. Perhaps one of the
most moving scenes occurs during the first
glimpse we have of her affair — she is riding a
commuter train out of the city, reliving scenes on
Paul's bed. Connie mirrors her memory of it by
making vivid facial expressions and squirming in
her chair. This scene does more to portray the
complex relationships she has formed than just
about all other scenes combined.
The male characters are, at best, unfocused.
Paul serves no other purpose than to provide a
penis, as well as perhaps imply the qualities that

Ed lacks. It's true
that Paul and
Connie some
times leave his
bed, such as when
they attend a

French cinema — but,
the shot of course turns
into a sex scene. Given
that Paul is attracted to
her from the start, it's
difficult to gauge his sin
cerity and understand
his motivations for hav
ing an affair with her.
Their relationship re-

mains opaque, as some of their sexual encounters bor
der on rape.
At least Paul is consistent, whatever his motivation
may be. Ed. on the other hand, makes little sense. He is
suspicious of Connie from the start, asking her in a
groan-worthy scene if she loves him. It's difficult to dis
cern whether they have already grown apart, or whether

he is supposed to be Mr. Per
fect, as Lyne at times presents
him. He manages to be cold yet
caring throughout the movie.
Although overall "Ln
faithful" is a solid film and
there are some interesting ten
sions interacting below the sur
face, these scenes often feel hol
low. The characters could use
some fleshing out. And speak
ing of flesh, it seems that Lyne
could have shown much more
during the sex scenes and still
remain within the limits of an
"R" rating.
