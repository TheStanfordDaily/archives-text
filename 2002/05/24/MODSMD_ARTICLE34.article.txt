# Garbage artists are anything but trashy
## 
### ERIC K. HAND 
Sanitary Fill Company Artist-In-Residence
Program
The Sanitary Fill Company's dump
stinks. The odor, like snuff or cocaine, jolts
you awake with considerable vigor. The
garbage may be decomposing but the
smell, sweetly sour and insistent, is full of
life. All of San Francisco's 2500 daily tons of
garbage passes through this waystation on
the Bay, in Brisbane near 3Com Park. It is
the potpourri of our gluttony and excesses
and discarded dreams. And it stinks.
But to artist Banker White, the smells
are no big deal. "You definitely recognize
the smells," he says casually. "There was for
sure a fish company here today."
White is finishing his tenure as an artist
in-residence at the dump. Since 1990, the
Company has paid artists to work full time
at the dump studio and to make art from
trash. The art, however, is not trashy.
"People think they'll just see robots
made from teakettles," says White. He
doffs his beige knit cap to reveal a scalp that
is bare and pasty white. Recently, he
shaved off nine months worth of hair and
beard. But even without the wizardly
beard, he is no less a garbage guru. He also
wears clear sunglasses of the style U2's
Bono favors-a mandatory fashion accesso
ry in a place where dust clouds roam freely,
seeking moist, filmy surfaces like your eye
ball or throat. Some of the more timid
artists wear dust masks..
Fellow artist-in-residence Daphne Ruff
is also into fashion accessories. Her art, in
fact, is the art of accessorizing. Her trash is
ready to wear. She makes, among other
things, hats from steel wool, purses from
Monopoly money, and bra pads from com
puter mouse pads.
Ruff's fashionable art may be feminine,
but she is not squeamish or intimidated
when it comes to rooting through heaps of
trash. "We get pornography all the time,"
she says, not easily impressed. She once
found a box of dildos and didn't even
blink.
There is a girlish flirtatiousness to
Daphne's dresses and purses and hats. Her
"Norcal Spring Line" dress, a black and flo
rescent yellow confection, is topped by a
tetherball, halved to form a hemispherical
skullcap. The skullcap is studded with pins
on which Daphne has slid soft orange
earplugs. Cinched around the dress's waist
is a batgirl utility belt stuffed with tooth
brushes, whisks, spatulas, and slotted
spoons.
"All the tools a woman needs at the
dump," Daphne says sarcastically.
White's art is less flamboyant and more
economical. He has rehabilitated instru
ments in the Company's recycled instru
ment band — "La Banda Basura"-by, for
example, stretching a piece of a Bugs
Bunny basketball over a bongo that had
been missing its head. Played along with
I'VC pipe xylophones and frying pan cym
bals, the bongos produce an impressive
rhythmic cacophony.
His art is more economical in another
sense, in that it comments on the science of
economics: our decisions as consumers.
"Afghan Rug" is a meticulously assembled
collage in the style of a Persian carpet,
where the spliced material is that most
übiquitous of capitalist logos: labels from

plastic Coke bottles. The logo of the most
exported consumer product in the world is
subsumed in the patterns of one of the
most troubled countries of the world. Is
this to be trod on and stamped out? Or
held up and displayed as a sign of in
evitable globalizations to come?
The heart of the dump, and one of three
quarries for the artists, is a cavernous facil
ity known as the "Pit." Oversized bulldoz
ers mash up the trash before sliding it off a
lip and into a waiting tractor trailer, called
a "possum belly" for the sagging cavity that
almost skims the ground. Each possum
belly in a fleet 30 strong makes three long
trips a day to landfills near Livermore in
Alameda Country.
When the bulldozers momentarily stop
churning, you can understand what Ruff
means when she says the trash "has an en
ergy, a life." The trash is steaming. Coun
teracting the rising fumes are mists of "dust
suppressor" (water) and "de-odorizer"
(chemicals) that rain down from pipes in
the ceiling.
Fattened by the dump, huge seagulls
and pigeons squawk along the edges of all
three tiers. "The seagulls never have to
look very far for food," explains White.
"But there are definitely toxins. If you
looked at the animal populations, you'd
find some gnarly stuff."
The seagulls scatter as a bulldozer push
es a mound of waste — most ly rotting food
and packaging — towards the lip. Ruff and
White don't frequent the Pit very often. No
art will come of this trash. The mound of
trash drops into the possum belly with a
crash. A cloud of white dust rises up em
phatically, like a blizzard in reverse.
Near the Pit is the public dumping area,
the place Ruff and White mine the most for
materials. Pick-up trucks and vans idle in
line outside, waiting to pay to unload their
waste. Seagulls circle and swarm overhead,
dropping their own payloads of waste onto
the cars. Though they are supposed to be
cleaning out their studio, Ruff and White
are already foraging, unable to resist the al
lure. Ihey are admitted and convicted
packrats.
"Sometimes I have to say, 'Get real,
you're never going to use it,"' says White.
"But I don't have a collecting problem. I
have a potential materials problem."
"Yeah, this [job] cured me," agrees
Ruff, in denial as well. "I'm better now. I
only pick up the good stuff." She clutch-

es a frayed,
woven- reed
purse that she
found only a few
moments earlier.
A thrift-store
van backs into the
dumping area.
You know an ob
ject is ready to die
when a thrift store
would rather pay
to dump it than to
house it.
"It's such a
waste," Ruff says.
"You don't have
any idea how
much waste. It
makes me angry."
The two thrift
store guys, appar-

ently regulars at the public dump area, are
tossing things from the back of their van:
bags of clothes, shabby furniture. They try
to slip in a bit of metal — not allowed in
this area — and are reprimanded by the
foreman.
"Every week," mutters Ruff. "They
should know better. I can't stand those two
guys. They just don't care."
When asked whether the dump is a
nursery for new, living things or a grave
yard, Ruff says, "Unfortunately, 1 see it
more as a graveyard. A few objects get a
short or last ditch chance for survival. But
once it's in the dumpsters, it's gone."
And then there are graveyards within
graveyards. Abutting one side of the public
dumping area is a steep grassy hillslope. It
is the ultimate gnome garden, populated
by plastic figurines that the dump workers
cannot bear to send to the Pit.
Nestled between cactus — both real and
plastic — are white plastic gravemarkers.
Several white plastic skeletons are strewn
about. Mannequin arms and hands reach
out from the earth and grasp at the air, as
if buried alive.
There are other human forms, both
young (naked baby dolls) and ancient
(Ronald Reagan). A bust of Flvis Presley,
face painted blue and mouth locked open
in song, pays homage, along with all the
saints, to at least one or two baby Jesuses.
Pagan gods (Apollo? Adonis? Athena?) get
in on the action too. A forlorn Santa Claus,
all rosiness windblasted from his cheeks,
would ruin any child's notion of Christmas.
And that's just the humans. Almost
every phylum in the animal kingdom is
represented too: deer, lion, ostrich, goose,
hippopotamus, pig and Porky Pig. A few
animals have yet to be classified — an im
potent, hairless "Where the Wild Things
Are" monster reclines wearily, all color and
fuzz having been blanched from his fur.
A motorcade of yellow Tonka trucks
guards the garden from above. A cavalry
of plastic horses (from an abandoned car
nival carousel?) flanks one side, while
duck decoys float placidly in a sea of
weeds on the other side. This is trash pur
gatory. Neither condemned to the landfill
nor saved through Ruff and White's art,
these Figurines will remain in their
grotesque tableaus, blankly resigned to
stoical endurance.
Before they return to the studio to pack
up their things, Ruff and White pay a final

visit to the sort line, the third area in which
they're allowed to rummage. Everything at
the sort line is, in theory, recyclable. Work
ers get paid $11 an hour to separate cans
and bottles and paper from an endless as
sembly-line stream. It is mind-numbing,
long-suffering work, but nonetheless im
portant. In 1989, California law mandated
that 50 percent of cities' garbage be recy
cled by the year 2000. San Francisco is cur
rently struggling to recycle 44 percent.
Ruff and White are more than just re
cycling artists. Sure, they rescue the object
initially. But then they vivisect it, suck out
its essential karma (a color, a texture, a
function) and patch it into a new narra
tive. They don't just re-use, they discover
new uses. They don't just resurrect, they
inject life.
And sometimes, the trash has a life or
history of its own. "Last time I was here, I
was really into the stuff that had personal
stories," White says. "You're always think
ing about why the trash ended up there."
Ruff found herself wearing other peo
ple's jewelry like talismans, where her in
terpretation of the history of the necklace
or earring "somehow brought it to life."
But the most poignant stories are the
stories of death, where, as Ruff puts it,

"someone has passed away and
their life lands at your feet. Then it
has an identity to it."
This trash — photographs,
keepsakes, entire wardrobes,
even wheelchairs and walkers-be
not proud. Ruff and White re
grieve what the absent family
members have already grieved. If
they don't put it in their art, they
must re-bury what has already
been buried.
There is a beaten-up photo
graph on the ground near the
public dumping area. There are
six young men, impeccably
dressed in dark suits. They are not
looking at the camera. They are
not smiling. There are sweating,
carrying a coffin. They are pall
bearers. Who would take this pic
ture and then throw it away?


"Y'all come back now, you hear?"

was really into the stuff that had personal

or earring "somehow brought it to life."
But the most poignant stories are the
stories of death, where, as Ruff puts it,

"someone has passed away and
their life lands at your feet. Then it
has an identity to it."
This trash — photographs,
keepsakes, entire wardrobes,
even wheelchairs and walkers-be
not proud. Ruff and White re
grieve what the absent family
members have already grieved. If
they don't put it in their art, they
must re-bury what has already
been buried.
There is a beaten-up photo
graph on the ground near the
public dumping area. There are
six young men, impeccably
dressed in dark suits. They are not
looking at the camera. They are
not smiling. There are sweating,
carrying a coffin. They are pall
bearers. Who would take this pic
ture and then throw it away?


"Y'all come back now, you hear?"

Sanitary Fill Company Artist-In-Residence
Program
The Sanitary Fill Company's dump
stinks. The odor, like snuff or cocaine, jolts
you awake with considerable vigor. The
garbage may be decomposing but the
smell, sweetly sour and insistent, is full of
life. All of San Francisco's 2500 daily tons of
garbage passes through this waystation on
the Bay, in Brisbane near 3Com Park. It is
the potpourri of our gluttony and excesses
and discarded dreams. And it stinks.
But to artist Banker White, the smells
are no big deal. "You definitely recognize
the smells," he says casually. "There was for
sure a fish company here today."
White is finishing his tenure as an artist
in-residence at the dump. Since 1990, the
Company has paid artists to work full time
at the dump studio and to make art from
trash. The art, however, is not trashy.
"People think they'll just see robots
made from teakettles," says White. He
doffs his beige knit cap to reveal a scalp that
is bare and pasty white. Recently, he
shaved off nine months worth of hair and
beard. But even without the wizardly
beard, he is no less a garbage guru. He also
wears clear sunglasses of the style U2's
Bono favors-a mandatory fashion accesso
ry in a place where dust clouds roam freely,
seeking moist, filmy surfaces like your eye
ball or throat. Some of the more timid
artists wear dust masks..
Fellow artist-in-residence Daphne Ruff
is also into fashion accessories. Her art, in
fact, is the art of accessorizing. Her trash is
ready to wear. She makes, among other
things, hats from steel wool, purses from
Monopoly money, and bra pads from com
puter mouse pads.
Ruff's fashionable art may be feminine,
but she is not squeamish or intimidated
when it comes to rooting through heaps of
trash. "We get pornography all the time,"
she says, not easily impressed. She once
found a box of dildos and didn't even
blink.
There is a girlish flirtatiousness to
Daphne's dresses and purses and hats. Her
"Norcal Spring Line" dress, a black and flo
rescent yellow confection, is topped by a
tetherball, halved to form a hemispherical
skullcap. The skullcap is studded with pins
on which Daphne has slid soft orange
earplugs. Cinched around the dress's waist
is a batgirl utility belt stuffed with tooth
brushes, whisks, spatulas, and slotted
spoons.
"All the tools a woman needs at the
dump," Daphne says sarcastically.
White's art is less flamboyant and more
economical. He has rehabilitated instru
ments in the Company's recycled instru
ment band — "La Banda Basura"-by, for
example, stretching a piece of a Bugs
Bunny basketball over a bongo that had
been missing its head. Played along with
I'VC pipe xylophones and frying pan cym
bals, the bongos produce an impressive
rhythmic cacophony.
His art is more economical in another
sense, in that it comments on the science of
economics: our decisions as consumers.
"Afghan Rug" is a meticulously assembled
collage in the style of a Persian carpet,
where the spliced material is that most
übiquitous of capitalist logos: labels from

plastic Coke bottles. The logo of the most
exported consumer product in the world is
subsumed in the patterns of one of the
most troubled countries of the world. Is
this to be trod on and stamped out? Or
held up and displayed as a sign of in
evitable globalizations to come?
The heart of the dump, and one of three
quarries for the artists, is a cavernous facil
ity known as the "Pit." Oversized bulldoz
ers mash up the trash before sliding it off a
lip and into a waiting tractor trailer, called
a "possum belly" for the sagging cavity that
almost skims the ground. Each possum
belly in a fleet 30 strong makes three long
trips a day to landfills near Livermore in
Alameda Country.
When the bulldozers momentarily stop
churning, you can understand what Ruff
means when she says the trash "has an en
ergy, a life." The trash is steaming. Coun
teracting the rising fumes are mists of "dust
suppressor" (water) and "de-odorizer"
(chemicals) that rain down from pipes in
the ceiling.
Fattened by the dump, huge seagulls
and pigeons squawk along the edges of all
three tiers. "The seagulls never have to
look very far for food," explains White.
"But there are definitely toxins. If you
looked at the animal populations, you'd
find some gnarly stuff."
The seagulls scatter as a bulldozer push
es a mound of waste — most ly rotting food
and packaging — towards the lip. Ruff and
White don't frequent the Pit very often. No
art will come of this trash. The mound of
trash drops into the possum belly with a
crash. A cloud of white dust rises up em
phatically, like a blizzard in reverse.
Near the Pit is the public dumping area,
the place Ruff and White mine the most for
materials. Pick-up trucks and vans idle in
line outside, waiting to pay to unload their
waste. Seagulls circle and swarm overhead,
dropping their own payloads of waste onto
the cars. Though they are supposed to be
cleaning out their studio, Ruff and White
are already foraging, unable to resist the al
lure. Ihey are admitted and convicted
packrats.
"Sometimes I have to say, 'Get real,
you're never going to use it,"' says White.
"But I don't have a collecting problem. I
have a potential materials problem."
"Yeah, this [job] cured me," agrees
Ruff, in denial as well. "I'm better now. I
only pick up the good stuff." She clutch-

es a frayed,
woven- reed
purse that she
found only a few
moments earlier.
A thrift-store
van backs into the
dumping area.
You know an ob
ject is ready to die
when a thrift store
would rather pay
to dump it than to
house it.
"It's such a
waste," Ruff says.
"You don't have
any idea how
much waste. It
makes me angry."
The two thrift
store guys, appar-

ently regulars at the public dump area, are
tossing things from the back of their van:
bags of clothes, shabby furniture. They try
to slip in a bit of metal — not allowed in
this area — and are reprimanded by the
foreman.
"Every week," mutters Ruff. "They
should know better. I can't stand those two
guys. They just don't care."
When asked whether the dump is a
nursery for new, living things or a grave
yard, Ruff says, "Unfortunately, 1 see it
more as a graveyard. A few objects get a
short or last ditch chance for survival. But
once it's in the dumpsters, it's gone."
And then there are graveyards within
graveyards. Abutting one side of the public
dumping area is a steep grassy hillslope. It
is the ultimate gnome garden, populated
by plastic figurines that the dump workers
cannot bear to send to the Pit.
Nestled between cactus — both real and
plastic — are white plastic gravemarkers.
Several white plastic skeletons are strewn
about. Mannequin arms and hands reach
out from the earth and grasp at the air, as
if buried alive.
There are other human forms, both
young (naked baby dolls) and ancient
(Ronald Reagan). A bust of Flvis Presley,
face painted blue and mouth locked open
in song, pays homage, along with all the
saints, to at least one or two baby Jesuses.
Pagan gods (Apollo? Adonis? Athena?) get
in on the action too. A forlorn Santa Claus,
all rosiness windblasted from his cheeks,
would ruin any child's notion of Christmas.
And that's just the humans. Almost
every phylum in the animal kingdom is
represented too: deer, lion, ostrich, goose,
hippopotamus, pig and Porky Pig. A few
animals have yet to be classified — an im
potent, hairless "Where the Wild Things
Are" monster reclines wearily, all color and
fuzz having been blanched from his fur.
A motorcade of yellow Tonka trucks
guards the garden from above. A cavalry
of plastic horses (from an abandoned car
nival carousel?) flanks one side, while
duck decoys float placidly in a sea of
weeds on the other side. This is trash pur
gatory. Neither condemned to the landfill
nor saved through Ruff and White's art,
these Figurines will remain in their
grotesque tableaus, blankly resigned to
stoical endurance.
Before they return to the studio to pack
up their things, Ruff and White pay a final

visit to the sort line, the third area in which
they're allowed to rummage. Everything at
the sort line is, in theory, recyclable. Work
ers get paid $11 an hour to separate cans
and bottles and paper from an endless as
sembly-line stream. It is mind-numbing,
long-suffering work, but nonetheless im
portant. In 1989, California law mandated
that 50 percent of cities' garbage be recy
cled by the year 2000. San Francisco is cur
rently struggling to recycle 44 percent.
Ruff and White are more than just re
cycling artists. Sure, they rescue the object
initially. But then they vivisect it, suck out
its essential karma (a color, a texture, a
function) and patch it into a new narra
tive. They don't just re-use, they discover
new uses. They don't just resurrect, they
inject life.
And sometimes, the trash has a life or
history of its own. "Last time I was here, I
was really into the stuff that had personal
stories," White says. "You're always think
ing about why the trash ended up there."

nor saved through Ruff and White's art,
these Figurines will remain in their
grotesque tableaus, blankly resigned to
stoical endurance.
Before they return to the studio to pack
up their things, Ruff and White pay a final

visit to the sort line, the third area in which
they're allowed to rummage. Everything at
the sort line is, in theory, recyclable. Work
ers get paid $11 an hour to separate cans
and bottles and paper from an endless as
sembly-line stream. It is mind-numbing,
long-suffering work, but nonetheless im
portant. In 1989, California law mandated
that 50 percent of cities' garbage be recy
cled by the year 2000. San Francisco is cur
rently struggling to recycle 44 percent.
Ruff and White are more than just re
cycling artists. Sure, they rescue the object
initially. But then they vivisect it, suck out
its essential karma (a color, a texture, a
function) and patch it into a new narra
tive. They don't just re-use, they discover
new uses. They don't just resurrect, they
inject life.
And sometimes, the trash has a life or
history of its own. "Last time I was here, I
was really into the stuff that had personal
stories," White says. "You're always think
ing about why the trash ended up there."
Ruff found herself wearing other peo
ple's jewelry like talismans, where her in
terpretation of the history of the necklace
or earring "somehow brought it to life."
But the most poignant stories are the
stories of death, where, as Ruff puts it,

"someone has passed away and
their life lands at your feet. Then it
has an identity to it."
This trash — photographs,
keepsakes, entire wardrobes,
even wheelchairs and walkers-be
not proud. Ruff and White re
grieve what the absent family
members have already grieved. If
they don't put it in their art, they
must re-bury what has already
been buried.
There is a beaten-up photo
graph on the ground near the
public dumping area. There are
six young men, impeccably
dressed in dark suits. They are not
looking at the camera. They are
not smiling. There are sweating,
carrying a coffin. They are pall
bearers. Who would take this pic
ture and then throw it away?

Sanitary Fill Company Artist-In-Residence
Program
The Sanitary Fill Company's dump
stinks. The odor, like snuff or cocaine, jolts
you awake with considerable vigor. The
garbage may be decomposing but the
smell, sweetly sour and insistent, is full of
life. All of San Francisco's 2500 daily tons of
garbage passes through this waystation on
the Bay, in Brisbane near 3Com Park. It is
the potpourri of our gluttony and excesses
and discarded dreams. And it stinks.
But to artist Banker White, the smells
are no big deal. "You definitely recognize
the smells," he says casually. "There was for
sure a fish company here today."
White is finishing his tenure as an artist
in-residence at the dump. Since 1990, the
Company has paid artists to work full time
at the dump studio and to make art from
trash. The art, however, is not trashy.
"People think they'll just see robots
made from teakettles," says White. He
doffs his beige knit cap to reveal a scalp that
is bare and pasty white. Recently, he
shaved off nine months worth of hair and
beard. But even without the wizardly
beard, he is no less a garbage guru. He also
wears clear sunglasses of the style U2's
Bono favors-a mandatory fashion accesso
ry in a place where dust clouds roam freely,
seeking moist, filmy surfaces like your eye
ball or throat. Some of the more timid
artists wear dust masks..
Fellow artist-in-residence Daphne Ruff
is also into fashion accessories. Her art, in
fact, is the art of accessorizing. Her trash is
ready to wear. She makes, among other
things, hats from steel wool, purses from
Monopoly money, and bra pads from com
puter mouse pads.
Ruff's fashionable art may be feminine,
but she is not squeamish or intimidated
when it comes to rooting through heaps of
trash. "We get pornography all the time,"
she says, not easily impressed. She once
found a box of dildos and didn't even
blink.
There is a girlish flirtatiousness to
Daphne's dresses and purses and hats. Her
"Norcal Spring Line" dress, a black and flo
rescent yellow confection, is topped by a
tetherball, halved to form a hemispherical
skullcap. The skullcap is studded with pins
on which Daphne has slid soft orange
earplugs. Cinched around the dress's waist
is a batgirl utility belt stuffed with tooth
brushes, whisks, spatulas, and slotted
spoons.
"All the tools a woman needs at the
dump," Daphne says sarcastically.
White's art is less flamboyant and more
economical. He has rehabilitated instru
ments in the Company's recycled instru
ment band — "La Banda Basura"-by, for
example, stretching a piece of a Bugs
Bunny basketball over a bongo that had
been missing its head. Played along with
I'VC pipe xylophones and frying pan cym
bals, the bongos produce an impressive
rhythmic cacophony.
His art is more economical in another
sense, in that it comments on the science of
economics: our decisions as consumers.
"Afghan Rug" is a meticulously assembled
collage in the style of a Persian carpet,
where the spliced material is that most
übiquitous of capitalist logos: labels from

plastic Coke bottles. The logo of the most
exported consumer product in the world is
subsumed in the patterns of one of the
most troubled countries of the world. Is
this to be trod on and stamped out? Or
held up and displayed as a sign of in
evitable globalizations to come?
The heart of the dump, and one of three
quarries for the artists, is a cavernous facil
ity known as the "Pit." Oversized bulldoz
ers mash up the trash before sliding it off a
lip and into a waiting tractor trailer, called
a "possum belly" for the sagging cavity that
almost skims the ground. Each possum
belly in a fleet 30 strong makes three long
trips a day to landfills near Livermore in
Alameda Country.
When the bulldozers momentarily stop
churning, you can understand what Ruff
means when she says the trash "has an en
ergy, a life." The trash is steaming. Coun
teracting the rising fumes are mists of "dust
suppressor" (water) and "de-odorizer"
(chemicals) that rain down from pipes in
the ceiling.
Fattened by the dump, huge seagulls
and pigeons squawk along the edges of all
three tiers. "The seagulls never have to
look very far for food," explains White.
"But there are definitely toxins. If you
looked at the animal populations, you'd
find some gnarly stuff."
The seagulls scatter as a bulldozer push
es a mound of waste — most ly rotting food
and packaging — towards the lip. Ruff and
White don't frequent the Pit very often. No
art will come of this trash. The mound of
trash drops into the possum belly with a
crash. A cloud of white dust rises up em
phatically, like a blizzard in reverse.
Near the Pit is the public dumping area,
the place Ruff and White mine the most for
materials. Pick-up trucks and vans idle in
line outside, waiting to pay to unload their
waste. Seagulls circle and swarm overhead,
dropping their own payloads of waste onto
the cars. Though they are supposed to be
cleaning out their studio, Ruff and White
are already foraging, unable to resist the al
lure. Ihey are admitted and convicted
packrats.
"Sometimes I have to say, 'Get real,
you're never going to use it,"' says White.
"But I don't have a collecting problem. I
have a potential materials problem."
"Yeah, this [job] cured me," agrees
Ruff, in denial as well. "I'm better now. I
only pick up the good stuff." She clutch-

es a frayed,
woven- reed
purse that she
found only a few
moments earlier.
A thrift-store
van backs into the
dumping area.
You know an ob
ject is ready to die
when a thrift store
would rather pay
to dump it than to
house it.
"It's such a
waste," Ruff says.
"You don't have
any idea how
much waste. It
makes me angry."
The two thrift
store guys, appar-

ently regulars at the public dump area, are
tossing things from the back of their van:
bags of clothes, shabby furniture. They try
to slip in a bit of metal — not allowed in
this area — and are reprimanded by the
foreman.
"Every week," mutters Ruff. "They
should know better. I can't stand those two
guys. They just don't care."
When asked whether the dump is a
nursery for new, living things or a grave
yard, Ruff says, "Unfortunately, 1 see it
more as a graveyard. A few objects get a
short or last ditch chance for survival. But
once it's in the dumpsters, it's gone."
And then there are graveyards within
graveyards. Abutting one side of the public
dumping area is a steep grassy hillslope. It
is the ultimate gnome garden, populated
by plastic figurines that the dump workers
cannot bear to send to the Pit.
Nestled between cactus — both real and
plastic — are white plastic gravemarkers.
Several white plastic skeletons are strewn
about. Mannequin arms and hands reach
out from the earth and grasp at the air, as
if buried alive.
There are other human forms, both
young (naked baby dolls) and ancient
(Ronald Reagan). A bust of Flvis Presley,
face painted blue and mouth locked open
in song, pays homage, along with all the
saints, to at least one or two baby Jesuses.
Pagan gods (Apollo? Adonis? Athena?) get
in on the action too. A forlorn Santa Claus,
all rosiness windblasted from his cheeks,
would ruin any child's notion of Christmas.
And that's just the humans. Almost
every phylum in the animal kingdom is
represented too: deer, lion, ostrich, goose,
hippopotamus, pig and Porky Pig. A few
animals have yet to be classified — an im
potent, hairless "Where the Wild Things
Are" monster reclines wearily, all color and
fuzz having been blanched from his fur.
A motorcade of yellow Tonka trucks
guards the garden from above. A cavalry
of plastic horses (from an abandoned car
nival carousel?) flanks one side, while
duck decoys float placidly in a sea of
weeds on the other side. This is trash pur
gatory. Neither condemned to the landfill
nor saved through Ruff and White's art,
these Figurines will remain in their
grotesque tableaus, blankly resigned to
stoical endurance.
