PUNK
What is punk? Damned if I know. Some facts: punk started
sometime in mid-'7os New York, was based largely on quick
th ree-chord songs, spread like a wildfire and disappeared as a co
herent movement —if it ever was one — in the early '80s. But
rumors of punk's death have been gready exaggerated: al
though they may not resemble the original CBGB badasses, im
portant, dynamic "punk" bands keep popping up. Hie best
punk is angry, sneering and loud, a venomous "fuck off!" to the
rest of the world. Here is a purely personal top five punk album
list:
The Sex Pistols, "Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pis
tols" — For all their catchiness, punk's greatest anthems "Anar
chy in the U.K." and "Ckxl Save die Queen 4 ' are filled with a des
perate, righteous anger. Lead singer Johnny Rotten famously
proclaimed, "You don't sing about love to people on the dole,"
and he doesn't take shit from anyone here. On "Bodies," Rotten
shrieks, "Screaming lucking bloody mess!" which describes the
Sex Pistols pretty accurately, They rocked like no one else.
Sleater-Kinney, "Dig Me Out" — On this album, post-riot grrrl
trio Sleater-Kinney constructed a perfectly punk tribute to punk
music. Every track is a gem, from the mournful longing of' One
More Hour" to the relendess "Not What You Want," but die real
standouts are the songs about songs: "Dance Song 97" 's deliri
ous urgency is contagious, and when Corin Tucker wails "Turn
turn it up!" on "Words + Guitar," 1 invariably do exactly that
The Clash, "London Calling" — With its third album, die Clash
decided to take on the world in a diverse array of tunes, ranging
from the reggae-tinged "Revolution Rock" to die old-school rock
'n' roll of "Brand New Cadillac." The album's finest moment is
"Death or Glory," a critique of idealism featuring one of the
greatest lines ever — "I le who fucks nuns will one day join the
church!"
The Buzzcocks, "Singles Going Steady" —Hie Buzzcocks ask,
"Ever fallen in love with someone you shouldn't have fallen in
love with?" and anyone who knows exactly what they're singing
about should appreciate die simple charm of tiiis collection of
catchy, lovelorn singles.
The Dead Kennedys, "Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables" —
Sarcastic social critics from die ultra-left, the Dead Kennedys vi
ciously, unforgettably skewer hippies ("California Über Alles"),
traditional liberals ("Holiday in Cambodia") and conservatives
("Kill the Poor"). 'Ihe album is funny as hell, and it's hard not to
love a band that would in a few years time demand, "MTV Get
Off The Air!"

SYNTH-POP
Synth-pop has roots that spread from as far as Beach Boys to
iiKxiern Japanese Pop. Ihe basic staples of its sound are a no
guitar, synthesizer-heavy melcxiy, get-your-ass on the floor
dance beats, and sober computerized vocals. This style of music
often gets a bad rap due to some of New Wave's less than innov
ative one-hit wonders, but as a genre, has continued to push for
ward musically, embracing new technology and giving a voice to
scxiety's paranoia and sense of wonder toward an uncertain fu
ture. Recendy revived under the guise of"Electro-pop," current
synth mixes the spirit of house and techno music with die intelli
gence and harmonies of pop compositions to create a sound diat
feels both retro and fresh. Here are a list of albums diat punctu
ate syndi-pop's finest flavors.
Five seminal albums:
Walter Carlos, "Switched-On Bach" — While not exacdy synth
pop music, this incredibly beautiful 1968 album features "virtu

osa electronic" versions of Bach's masterpieces performed en
tirely on Moog synthesizers. This album is breadi-taking and
first validated the synthesizer as legitimate musical instrument.
Kraftwerk, 'Computer World" — 1 said it once and I'll say it
again: Kraftwerk is pure sonic bliss. Kraftwerk set die stage for
New Wave on this album by singing love songs to computers
over complicated beats and analog keyboard flourishes. A must
have for any Synth-pop connoisseur!
Takako Minekawa, "R(x)inic Cube" —Japanese synth princess
Minekawa's 1990 album features a perfect mix of cuteness, in
trospection and danceable hooks, ;dl powered by her supreme
programming know how. This records features die best of
Japanese pop sensibilities skillfully mixed with the possibilites of
modern technology.
Adult, "Resuscitation"—Nearly filling outside of the synth-pop
category, die soundscape of this album is stark and sterile, but has
a charged lifeline that is driven by seriously heavy beats. My fa
vorite band of 2001, Adult, touch on topics of isolation, cleanli
ness and technology.
Stereo Total, "Musique Automatique"—Tliis German duo typ
ifies the best of current international pop and syndi music. The
songs are sung in mosdy German and French, but feature dash
es of English and occasional Japanese. Certainly a band to keep
your eye(and ear) on, Stereo Total serve as 21st century syndi's

CONSCIOUS HIP HOP
In the past decade, hip hop has become commercially viable
mainstream entertainment. However, though popular artists
likeJay-Z and Snoop Dogg dominate the popular radar, hip hop
will always have its roots in the underground and in a socially
conscious attitude. Conscious hip hop is a genre of music devot
ed to addressing and questioning social and cultural problems,
whether they be racism or corporate influence in everyday life.
What makes the music so exciting is that it is at once opinionated
and intelligent, while remaining furiously innovative, artistic and
fun. Five albums to check out?
Public Enemy, "It fakes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back"
— Public Enemy is really where conscious hip hop begins. Rap
per and lyricist Chuck I) passionately decries the venomous
racism lie sees all around him. This is an abrasive, urgent record.
A year after diis album was released in 1988, Public Enemy pro
vided the dieme song to Spike Lee's seminal film, "I)o'I he Right
Thing."
Spearhead, "Chocolate Supa Highway" — People may debate
about exacdy where San Franciscan Michael Franti and his
group Spearhead lit into die hip hop community. One thing that
is not in question, however, is that Spearhead is terrifically inno
vative, steadily emerging as a voice against social injustice. Re
leased after the Oklahoma City Bombing, "Chocolate Supa
Highway" features Franti standing against popular bigotry, "I
remember the time in Oklahoma / You tried to blame an Arab /
But whitey was the bomber." Even when he's not being so seri
ous, his message still stings. One one song about sexual harrass
liient in the workplace, he mimics a woman telling her boss, "Get
die fuck away before I make you disappear / I don't play diat
freaky shit/ Do I make myself clear?"
A Tribe Called Quest, "Midnight Marauders" — Q-Tip. Phife
and Ali Shaheed Muhammad formed one of die most influential
hip hop groups of all time. At times, A Tribe Called Quest could
be somewhat immature. Take for instance, one of Phife's verbal
(xles to women: "I like 'em black, yellow, Puerto Rican and Hait
ian." At other times, though, the group made astute social ob
servations. On "Sucka Nigga," Q-Tip meditates on the historical
use of the word "nigger" both in popular culture and among die
African-American community. His concludes that using the
word as a term of endearment can be a way to deal with the prej
udices still present in society.

Mos Def," Black on Botli Sides" — Mos Def is one of the most ex
citing and talented socially conscious hip hop artists to emerge in
recent memory. After establishing himself with fellow Brooklyn
native Talib Kweli on "Mos Def and Talib Kweli Are... Black-
Star," he released this solo debnt. Featuring tender songs like
"Umi Says" (about his mother), the album also explores social is
sues with ease and compassion.
The Coup, "Steal This Album"—Oakland's Hie Coup is some
thing of a strange bird. 'Hie duo, consisting of Boots Riley and
Pam the Funkstress, have been making music since the early '90s
and though they have won critiail acclaim, public reaction has
been somewhat tepid. That just shows that some people obvi
ously haven't got a clue when it comes to great music. Hie
group's 1994 album, provocatively titled "Steal lliis Album," fo
cuses exclusively on die plight of America's urban masses, exco
riating those who resist progress toward scxial equality. Prime
cuts include "Me and Jesus the Pimp In A '79 Granada last
Night," a tune about a mother who must prostitute herself to
provide lor her son, and "20,000. Gun Salute": "20,000 gun
salute / Get rowdy like you got a substitute /' This slug's lor Newt
/ Shut your mouth, don't pollute!"

TRIP-HOP
Born in Bristol, England, widi Massive Attack's 1991 release
of "Blue Lines," trip-hop Ls less the bastard offspring of hip hop
and tripped-out electronica than a conglomeration of beautiful
elements, many of which occur in the genre's namesakes.
Just as the name indicates, hip hop's influence is key, and
found namely in counts of around 60 bpm, lyrics (mosdy) and
breakbeats to showcase the talent of the DJs and producers,
which in the case of trip-hop are the primary artists involved.
That is, trip-hoppers both make the beats and sing over them.
The electronic aspect appears mosdy in the hooks, which (like
more modern pop hip hop) utilize any and all sorts of loops,
ranging from bizarre Radiohead-y phazered guitars, to jazz sam
ples and beyond. Though this may sound abrasive, the main fea
ture of this genre is its pure sonic beauty, supported by charac
teristically haunting vocals and lyrics. Those in search of the cal
culated ear-assaults of an Autechre or the Wu-Tang, look else
where.
The following are selected for accessibility and polish, which
precludes some of the earlier attempts. However, if you like
these, check out the other cuts; you won't be disappointed.
Massive Attack "Mezzanine"—Hie magnum opus of the
group that started it all. Stunning album, with flights into the ce
lestial (Teardrop, Man Next Door).
Portishead "Dummy" — Probably the best example of vocal
gorgeousness mixed in perfect harmony with trip-hop com
plexities. Merits a few thorough listens under headphones, with
specific attention paid to "Roads" and "Glory Box."
DJ Shadow "Endtroducing"—The pinnacle of die sample.
Shadow's debut is comprised entirely of sampled music; he
didn't play a single instrument other than his decks (perhaps an
808, but no one's not sure). Notable in being lyric-less, yet still
capturing the trip-hop beauty. Listen to the beats go lxx>m.
Tricky "Maxinquaye" — 'Hie first solo-artist to try his hand,
Tricky departed from Massive Attack after "Blue Lines." Cred
ited as perhaps the father of trip-hop, his debut is required lis
tening.
UNKLE "Psyence Fiction" — llie youngest release on this list ,
UNKLE's offering essentially compiles all diat which had come
before it. The primary producers are James Lavelle and DJ
Shadow of Mo' Wax. However the album is graced by guest ap
pearances by a roll call of die freshest and cleanest of the music
world, from Mike D of die Beasde Boys to Thom Yorke of you
know who. "Rabbit In Your Headlights" could carry an album
by itself. Keeps your ears peeled at 5:24 -it might be the fattest
beat... ever.

TRIP-HOP
Born in Bristol, England, widi Massive Attack's 1991 release
of "Blue Lines," trip-hop Ls less the bastard offspring of hip hop
and tripped-out electronica than a conglomeration of beautiful
elements, many of which occur in the genre's namesakes.
Just as the name indicates, hip hop's influence is key, and
found namely in counts of around 60 bpm, lyrics (mosdy) and
breakbeats to showcase the talent of the DJs and producers,
which in the case of trip-hop are the primary artists involved.
That is, trip-hoppers both make the beats and sing over them.
The electronic aspect appears mosdy in the hooks, which (like
more modern pop hip hop) utilize any and all sorts of loops,
ranging from bizarre Radiohead-y phazered guitars, to jazz sam
ples and beyond. Though this may sound abrasive, the main fea
ture of this genre is its pure sonic beauty, supported by charac
teristically haunting vocals and lyrics. Those in search of the cal
culated ear-assaults of an Autechre or the Wu-Tang, look else
where.
The following are selected for accessibility and polish, which
precludes some of the earlier attempts. However, if you like
these, check out the other cuts; you won't be disappointed.
Massive Attack "Mezzanine"—Hie magnum opus of the
group that started it all. Stunning album, with flights into the ce
lestial (Teardrop, Man Next Door).
Portishead "Dummy" — Probably the best example of vocal
gorgeousness mixed in perfect harmony with trip-hop com

DJ Shadow "Endtroducing"—The pinnacle of die sample.
Shadow's debut is comprised entirely of sampled music; he
didn't play a single instrument other than his decks (perhaps an
808, but no one's not sure). Notable in being lyric-less, yet still
capturing the trip-hop beauty. Listen to the beats go lxx>m.
Tricky "Maxinquaye" — 'Hie first solo-artist to try his hand,
Tricky departed from Massive Attack after "Blue Lines." Cred
ited as perhaps the father of trip-hop, his debut is required lis

UNKLE "Psyence Fiction" — llie youngest release on this list ,
UNKLE's offering essentially compiles all diat which had come

PUNK
What is punk? Damned if I know. Some facts: punk started
sometime in mid-'7os New York, was based largely on quick
th ree-chord songs, spread like a wildfire and disappeared as a co
herent movement —if it ever was one — in the early '80s. But
rumors of punk's death have been gready exaggerated: al
though they may not resemble the original CBGB badasses, im
portant, dynamic "punk" bands keep popping up. Hie best
punk is angry, sneering and loud, a venomous "fuck off!" to the
rest of the world. Here is a purely personal top five punk album
list:
The Sex Pistols, "Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pis
tols" — For all their catchiness, punk's greatest anthems "Anar
chy in the U.K." and "Ckxl Save die Queen 4 ' are filled with a des
perate, righteous anger. Lead singer Johnny Rotten famously
proclaimed, "You don't sing about love to people on the dole,"
and he doesn't take shit from anyone here. On "Bodies," Rotten
shrieks, "Screaming lucking bloody mess!" which describes the
Sex Pistols pretty accurately, They rocked like no one else.
Sleater-Kinney, "Dig Me Out" — On this album, post-riot grrrl
trio Sleater-Kinney constructed a perfectly punk tribute to punk
music. Every track is a gem, from the mournful longing of' One
More Hour" to the relendess "Not What You Want," but die real
standouts are the songs about songs: "Dance Song 97" 's deliri
ous urgency is contagious, and when Corin Tucker wails "Turn
turn it up!" on "Words + Guitar," 1 invariably do exactly that
The Clash, "London Calling" — With its third album, die Clash
decided to take on the world in a diverse array of tunes, ranging
from the reggae-tinged "Revolution Rock" to die old-school rock
'n' roll of "Brand New Cadillac." The album's finest moment is
"Death or Glory," a critique of idealism featuring one of the
greatest lines ever — "I le who fucks nuns will one day join the
church!"
The Buzzcocks, "Singles Going Steady" —Hie Buzzcocks ask,
"Ever fallen in love with someone you shouldn't have fallen in
love with?" and anyone who knows exactly what they're singing
about should appreciate die simple charm of tiiis collection of
catchy, lovelorn singles.
The Dead Kennedys, "Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables" —
Sarcastic social critics from die ultra-left, the Dead Kennedys vi
ciously, unforgettably skewer hippies ("California Über Alles"),
traditional liberals ("Holiday in Cambodia") and conservatives
("Kill the Poor"). 'Ihe album is funny as hell, and it's hard not to
love a band that would in a few years time demand, "MTV Get
Off The Air!"

SYNTH-POP
Synth-pop has roots that spread from as far as Beach Boys to
iiKxiern Japanese Pop. Ihe basic staples of its sound are a no
guitar, synthesizer-heavy melcxiy, get-your-ass on the floor
dance beats, and sober computerized vocals. This style of music
often gets a bad rap due to some of New Wave's less than innov
ative one-hit wonders, but as a genre, has continued to push for
ward musically, embracing new technology and giving a voice to
scxiety's paranoia and sense of wonder toward an uncertain fu
ture. Recendy revived under the guise of"Electro-pop," current
synth mixes the spirit of house and techno music with die intelli
gence and harmonies of pop compositions to create a sound diat
feels both retro and fresh. Here are a list of albums diat punctu
ate syndi-pop's finest flavors.
Five seminal albums:
Walter Carlos, "Switched-On Bach" — While not exacdy synth
pop music, this incredibly beautiful 1968 album features "virtu

osa electronic" versions of Bach's masterpieces performed en
tirely on Moog synthesizers. This album is breadi-taking and
first validated the synthesizer as legitimate musical instrument.
Kraftwerk, 'Computer World" — 1 said it once and I'll say it
again: Kraftwerk is pure sonic bliss. Kraftwerk set die stage for
New Wave on this album by singing love songs to computers
over complicated beats and analog keyboard flourishes. A must
have for any Synth-pop connoisseur!
Takako Minekawa, "R(x)inic Cube" —Japanese synth princess
Minekawa's 1990 album features a perfect mix of cuteness, in
trospection and danceable hooks, ;dl powered by her supreme
programming know how. This records features die best of
Japanese pop sensibilities skillfully mixed with the possibilites of
modern technology.
Adult, "Resuscitation"—Nearly filling outside of the synth-pop
category, die soundscape of this album is stark and sterile, but has
a charged lifeline that is driven by seriously heavy beats. My fa
vorite band of 2001, Adult, touch on topics of isolation, cleanli
ness and technology.
Stereo Total, "Musique Automatique"—Tliis German duo typ
ifies the best of current international pop and syndi music. The
songs are sung in mosdy German and French, but feature dash
es of English and occasional Japanese. Certainly a band to keep
your eye(and ear) on, Stereo Total serve as 21st century syndi's
diplomats, bringing intelligent, lovely pop music to all.

CONSCIOUS HIP HOP
In the past decade, hip hop has become commercially viable
mainstream entertainment. However, though popular artists
likeJay-Z and Snoop Dogg dominate the popular radar, hip hop
will always have its roots in the underground and in a socially
conscious attitude. Conscious hip hop is a genre of music devot
ed to addressing and questioning social and cultural problems,
whether they be racism or corporate influence in everyday life.
What makes the music so exciting is that it is at once opinionated
and intelligent, while remaining furiously innovative, artistic and
fun. Five albums to check out?
Public Enemy, "It fakes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back"
— Public Enemy is really where conscious hip hop begins. Rap
per and lyricist Chuck I) passionately decries the venomous
racism lie sees all around him. This is an abrasive, urgent record.
A year after diis album was released in 1988, Public Enemy pro
vided the dieme song to Spike Lee's seminal film, "I)o'I he Right
Thing."
Spearhead, "Chocolate Supa Highway" — People may debate
about exacdy where San Franciscan Michael Franti and his
group Spearhead lit into die hip hop community. One thing that
is not in question, however, is that Spearhead is terrifically inno
vative, steadily emerging as a voice against social injustice. Re
leased after the Oklahoma City Bombing, "Chocolate Supa
Highway" features Franti standing against popular bigotry, "I
remember the time in Oklahoma / You tried to blame an Arab /
But whitey was the bomber." Even when he's not being so seri
ous, his message still stings. One one song about sexual harrass
liient in the workplace, he mimics a woman telling her boss, "Get
die fuck away before I make you disappear / I don't play diat
freaky shit/ Do I make myself clear?"
A Tribe Called Quest, "Midnight Marauders" — Q-Tip. Phife
and Ali Shaheed Muhammad formed one of die most influential
hip hop groups of all time. At times, A Tribe Called Quest could
be somewhat immature. Take for instance, one of Phife's verbal
(xles to women: "I like 'em black, yellow, Puerto Rican and Hait
ian." At other times, though, the group made astute social ob
servations. On "Sucka Nigga," Q-Tip meditates on the historical
use of the word "nigger" both in popular culture and among die
African-American community. His concludes that using the
word as a term of endearment can be a way to deal with the prej
udices still present in society.

Mos Def," Black on Botli Sides" — Mos Def is one of the most ex
citing and talented socially conscious hip hop artists to emerge in
recent memory. After establishing himself with fellow Brooklyn
native Talib Kweli on "Mos Def and Talib Kweli Are... Black-
Star," he released this solo debnt. Featuring tender songs like
"Umi Says" (about his mother), the album also explores social is
sues with ease and compassion.
The Coup, "Steal This Album"—Oakland's Hie Coup is some
thing of a strange bird. 'Hie duo, consisting of Boots Riley and
Pam the Funkstress, have been making music since the early '90s
and though they have won critiail acclaim, public reaction has
been somewhat tepid. That just shows that some people obvi
ously haven't got a clue when it comes to great music. Hie
group's 1994 album, provocatively titled "Steal lliis Album," fo
cuses exclusively on die plight of America's urban masses, exco
riating those who resist progress toward scxial equality. Prime
cuts include "Me and Jesus the Pimp In A '79 Granada last
Night," a tune about a mother who must prostitute herself to
provide lor her son, and "20,000. Gun Salute": "20,000 gun
salute / Get rowdy like you got a substitute /' This slug's lor Newt

'n' roll of "Brand New Cadillac." The album's finest moment is
"Death or Glory," a critique of idealism featuring one of the
greatest lines ever — "I le who fucks nuns will one day join the
church!"
The Buzzcocks, "Singles Going Steady" —Hie Buzzcocks ask,
"Ever fallen in love with someone you shouldn't have fallen in
love with?" and anyone who knows exactly what they're singing
about should appreciate die simple charm of tiiis collection of
catchy, lovelorn singles.
The Dead Kennedys, "Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables" —
Sarcastic social critics from die ultra-left, the Dead Kennedys vi
ciously, unforgettably skewer hippies ("California Über Alles"),
traditional liberals ("Holiday in Cambodia") and conservatives
("Kill the Poor"). 'Ihe album is funny as hell, and it's hard not to
love a band that would in a few years time demand, "MTV Get
Off The Air!"

SYNTH-POP
Synth-pop has roots that spread from as far as Beach Boys to
iiKxiern Japanese Pop. Ihe basic staples of its sound are a no
guitar, synthesizer-heavy melcxiy, get-your-ass on the floor
dance beats, and sober computerized vocals. This style of music
often gets a bad rap due to some of New Wave's less than innov
ative one-hit wonders, but as a genre, has continued to push for
ward musically, embracing new technology and giving a voice to
scxiety's paranoia and sense of wonder toward an uncertain fu
ture. Recendy revived under the guise of"Electro-pop," current
synth mixes the spirit of house and techno music with die intelli
gence and harmonies of pop compositions to create a sound diat
feels both retro and fresh. Here are a list of albums diat punctu
ate syndi-pop's finest flavors.
Five seminal albums:
Walter Carlos, "Switched-On Bach" — While not exacdy synth
pop music, this incredibly beautiful 1968 album features "virtu

osa electronic" versions of Bach's masterpieces performed en
tirely on Moog synthesizers. This album is breadi-taking and
first validated the synthesizer as legitimate musical instrument.
Kraftwerk, 'Computer World" — 1 said it once and I'll say it
again: Kraftwerk is pure sonic bliss. Kraftwerk set die stage for
New Wave on this album by singing love songs to computers
over complicated beats and analog keyboard flourishes. A must
have for any Synth-pop connoisseur!
Takako Minekawa, "R(x)inic Cube" —Japanese synth princess
Minekawa's 1990 album features a perfect mix of cuteness, in
trospection and danceable hooks, ;dl powered by her supreme
programming know how. This records features die best of
Japanese pop sensibilities skillfully mixed with the possibilites of
modern technology.
Adult, "Resuscitation"—Nearly filling outside of the synth-pop
category, die soundscape of this album is stark and sterile, but has
a charged lifeline that is driven by seriously heavy beats. My fa
vorite band of 2001, Adult, touch on topics of isolation, cleanli
ness and technology.
Stereo Total, "Musique Automatique"—Tliis German duo typ
ifies the best of current international pop and syndi music. The
songs are sung in mosdy German and French, but feature dash
es of English and occasional Japanese. Certainly a band to keep
your eye(and ear) on, Stereo Total serve as 21st century syndi's
diplomats, bringing intelligent, lovely pop music to all.

CONSCIOUS HIP HOP
In the past decade, hip hop has become commercially viable
mainstream entertainment. However, though popular artists
likeJay-Z and Snoop Dogg dominate the popular radar, hip hop
will always have its roots in the underground and in a socially
conscious attitude. Conscious hip hop is a genre of music devot
ed to addressing and questioning social and cultural problems,
whether they be racism or corporate influence in everyday life.
What makes the music so exciting is that it is at once opinionated
and intelligent, while remaining furiously innovative, artistic and
fun. Five albums to check out?
Public Enemy, "It fakes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back"
— Public Enemy is really where conscious hip hop begins. Rap
per and lyricist Chuck I) passionately decries the venomous
racism lie sees all around him. This is an abrasive, urgent record.
A year after diis album was released in 1988, Public Enemy pro
vided the dieme song to Spike Lee's seminal film, "I)o'I he Right
Thing."
Spearhead, "Chocolate Supa Highway" — People may debate
about exacdy where San Franciscan Michael Franti and his
group Spearhead lit into die hip hop community. One thing that
is not in question, however, is that Spearhead is terrifically inno
vative, steadily emerging as a voice against social injustice. Re
leased after the Oklahoma City Bombing, "Chocolate Supa
Highway" features Franti standing against popular bigotry, "I
remember the time in Oklahoma / You tried to blame an Arab /
But whitey was the bomber." Even when he's not being so seri
ous, his message still stings. One one song about sexual harrass
liient in the workplace, he mimics a woman telling her boss, "Get
die fuck away before I make you disappear / I don't play diat
freaky shit/ Do I make myself clear?"
A Tribe Called Quest, "Midnight Marauders" — Q-Tip. Phife
and Ali Shaheed Muhammad formed one of die most influential
hip hop groups of all time. At times, A Tribe Called Quest could
be somewhat immature. Take for instance, one of Phife's verbal
(xles to women: "I like 'em black, yellow, Puerto Rican and Hait
ian." At other times, though, the group made astute social ob
servations. On "Sucka Nigga," Q-Tip meditates on the historical
use of the word "nigger" both in popular culture and among die
African-American community. His concludes that using the
word as a term of endearment can be a way to deal with the prej
udices still present in society.

Mos Def," Black on Botli Sides" — Mos Def is one of the most ex
citing and talented socially conscious hip hop artists to emerge in
recent memory. After establishing himself with fellow Brooklyn
native Talib Kweli on "Mos Def and Talib Kweli Are... Black-
Star," he released this solo debnt. Featuring tender songs like
"Umi Says" (about his mother), the album also explores social is
sues with ease and compassion.
The Coup, "Steal This Album"—Oakland's Hie Coup is some
thing of a strange bird. 'Hie duo, consisting of Boots Riley and
Pam the Funkstress, have been making music since the early '90s
and though they have won critiail acclaim, public reaction has
been somewhat tepid. That just shows that some people obvi
ously haven't got a clue when it comes to great music. Hie
group's 1994 album, provocatively titled "Steal lliis Album," fo
cuses exclusively on die plight of America's urban masses, exco
riating those who resist progress toward scxial equality. Prime
cuts include "Me and Jesus the Pimp In A '79 Granada last
Night," a tune about a mother who must prostitute herself to
provide lor her son, and "20,000. Gun Salute": "20,000 gun
salute / Get rowdy like you got a substitute /' This slug's lor Newt
/ Shut your mouth, don't pollute!"

TRIP-HOP
Born in Bristol, England, widi Massive Attack's 1991 release
of "Blue Lines," trip-hop Ls less the bastard offspring of hip hop
and tripped-out electronica than a conglomeration of beautiful
elements, many of which occur in the genre's namesakes.
Just as the name indicates, hip hop's influence is key, and
found namely in counts of around 60 bpm, lyrics (mosdy) and
breakbeats to showcase the talent of the DJs and producers,
which in the case of trip-hop are the primary artists involved.
That is, trip-hoppers both make the beats and sing over them.
The electronic aspect appears mosdy in the hooks, which (like
more modern pop hip hop) utilize any and all sorts of loops,
ranging from bizarre Radiohead-y phazered guitars, to jazz sam
ples and beyond. Though this may sound abrasive, the main fea
ture of this genre is its pure sonic beauty, supported by charac
teristically haunting vocals and lyrics. Those in search of the cal
culated ear-assaults of an Autechre or the Wu-Tang, look else
where.
The following are selected for accessibility and polish, which
precludes some of the earlier attempts. However, if you like
these, check out the other cuts; you won't be disappointed.
Massive Attack "Mezzanine"—Hie magnum opus of the
group that started it all. Stunning album, with flights into the ce
lestial (Teardrop, Man Next Door).
Portishead "Dummy" — Probably the best example of vocal
gorgeousness mixed in perfect harmony with trip-hop com
plexities. Merits a few thorough listens under headphones, with
specific attention paid to "Roads" and "Glory Box."
DJ Shadow "Endtroducing"—The pinnacle of die sample.
Shadow's debut is comprised entirely of sampled music; he
didn't play a single instrument other than his decks (perhaps an
808, but no one's not sure). Notable in being lyric-less, yet still
capturing the trip-hop beauty. Listen to the beats go lxx>m.
Tricky "Maxinquaye" — 'Hie first solo-artist to try his hand,
Tricky departed from Massive Attack after "Blue Lines." Cred
ited as perhaps the father of trip-hop, his debut is required lis
tening.
UNKLE "Psyence Fiction" — llie youngest release on this list ,
UNKLE's offering essentially compiles all diat which had come
before it. The primary producers are James Lavelle and DJ
Shadow of Mo' Wax. However the album is graced by guest ap
pearances by a roll call of die freshest and cleanest of the music
world, from Mike D of die Beasde Boys to Thom Yorke of you
know who. "Rabbit In Your Headlights" could carry an album
by itself. Keeps your ears peeled at 5:24 -it might be the fattest
beat... ever.

Think you know about music, kid 112 You don't know aboul music. Think
you know aboul life? Ha! You don't know alxrut life little fluid. IA our
writers schoolyou in four musical genres you may know little about. Then,
and ordy then, will you be ready to go out and hcik ass.
PUNK
What is punk? Damned if I know. Some facts: punk started
sometime in mid-'7os New York, was based largely on quick
th ree-chord songs, spread like a wildfire and disappeared as a co
herent movement —if it ever was one — in the early '80s. But
rumors of punk's death have been gready exaggerated: al
though they may not resemble the original CBGB badasses, im
portant, dynamic "punk" bands keep popping up. Hie best
punk is angry, sneering and loud, a venomous "fuck off!" to the
rest of the world. Here is a purely personal top five punk album
list:
The Sex Pistols, "Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pis
tols" — For all their catchiness, punk's greatest anthems "Anar
chy in the U.K." and "Ckxl Save die Queen 4 ' are filled with a des
perate, righteous anger. Lead singer Johnny Rotten famously
proclaimed, "You don't sing about love to people on the dole,"
and he doesn't take shit from anyone here. On "Bodies," Rotten
shrieks, "Screaming lucking bloody mess!" which describes the
Sex Pistols pretty accurately, They rocked like no one else.
Sleater-Kinney, "Dig Me Out" — On this album, post-riot grrrl
trio Sleater-Kinney constructed a perfectly punk tribute to punk
music. Every track is a gem, from the mournful longing of' One
More Hour" to the relendess "Not What You Want," but die real
standouts are the songs about songs: "Dance Song 97" 's deliri
ous urgency is contagious, and when Corin Tucker wails "Turn
turn it up!" on "Words + Guitar," 1 invariably do exactly that
The Clash, "London Calling" — With its third album, die Clash
decided to take on the world in a diverse array of tunes, ranging
from the reggae-tinged "Revolution Rock" to die old-school rock
'n' roll of "Brand New Cadillac." The album's finest moment is
"Death or Glory," a critique of idealism featuring one of the
greatest lines ever — "I le who fucks nuns will one day join the
church!"
The Buzzcocks, "Singles Going Steady" —Hie Buzzcocks ask,
"Ever fallen in love with someone you shouldn't have fallen in
love with?" and anyone who knows exactly what they're singing
about should appreciate die simple charm of tiiis collection of
catchy, lovelorn singles.
The Dead Kennedys, "Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables" —
Sarcastic social critics from die ultra-left, the Dead Kennedys vi
ciously, unforgettably skewer hippies ("California Über Alles"),
traditional liberals ("Holiday in Cambodia") and conservatives
("Kill the Poor"). 'Ihe album is funny as hell, and it's hard not to
love a band that would in a few years time demand, "MTV Get
