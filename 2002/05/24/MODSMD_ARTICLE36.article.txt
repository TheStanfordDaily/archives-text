# Pedro, king of the indie rock jungle

The release of "Control" marks a
large departure for the staple indie
rock band Pedro the Lion, a.k.a.
Seattle's Dave Bazan. Although
Bazan retains the storytelling aspect
of his singing, breathing life into the
characters he has invented through
his lyrics, "Control" features heavier
sounds than his previous two full-

lengths — 19 9 8' s well-received
debut "It's Hard to Find a Friend," as
well as follow-up record "Winners
Never Quit."
Pedro the Lion is currently on a
cross-country tour promoting the
new release. Speaking to Bazan over
the phone, against the noisy back
ground of a tour bus as he made his
way westward, he explained, "I want
ed to make a record that was all syn
thesizers and drums, but it didn't re
ally work out." Laughing, he added,
"It ended up just being a guitar rock
record."
Rumor has it he scrapped the
whole record at the last minute, un
satisfied with the sound. He ended
up recording the majority of the
album in his friend's bedroom after
running out of studio time at Com
pound Recording.
"It was a little hairy," he said. "I
would go in from 10:00 p.m. to 10:00
a.m. when the other guy wasn't work
ing in the studio."
The Final product is a stripped
down, yet more energetic take of ear
lier Pedro material with clever and

heartbreakingly honest lyrics. I could
choose any of them to quote, but
these verses from the album's third
song, "Penetration," make the point:
"Have you ever seen an idealist with
gray hairs on his head / Or successful
men that keep in touch with unsuc
cessful friends? / You only think you
did / 1 could have sworn I saw it too /
But as it turns out it was just a clever
ad for cigarettes."

The lyrics resonate with one of the
album's many themes of corporate
and political control, hence the
album's title. In the next track, "In
dian Summer," Bazan sings, "All the
experts say you ought to start them
young / That way they'll naturally
love the taste of corporate cum."
Somehow he manages to deliver
those lines without the cynicism one
would expect. He instead seems like
an impartial observer.
Bazan spoke extensively of the
album's themes. "Initially [the
album] was going to be a lot more po
litical than it turned out to be," he ex
plained. "It was about control issues
in general, the distribution of power
and wealth, but once 1 got into the
writing process a little more, I ended
up shifting pretense aside and just
tried to write songs. It incorporated
some of the more personal relation
ship themes."
" And indeed Bazan manages to bal
ance his social criticisms with human
concerns of longing, of questioning
relationships. And of course, of ques
tioming his faith.

Pedro the
Lion has long
cultivated a
Christian fol
lowing, al
though Bazan
cautions that it
shouldn't be
mistaken fora
Christian band.
Whenever he
sings about
Jesus in his
lyrics, Bazan
does not
preach. Rather,
he questions
the concept of
institutional
ized religion.
Unfortunately,
some portion of
his Christian

following doesn't seem to understand
he is not a spokesperson for the reli
gion. Often, his CDs are returned to
Jade Tree, Pedro's record label, by
Christian magazines who accuse his
lyrics of being un-Christian.
Even still, after three albums,
there is a division in his fan base be
tween the Christian kids and the emo
kids at shows. There are stories of
fans forming prayer circles during
shows — the presence of two
"camps" is especially pronounced.
"I really want for Christian kids to
be able to break out of the tyranny of
the whole Christian subculture and
be able to just go to shows and not be
so uptight," said Bazan. "I would
rather make music and not have it la
beled or have to be [approved] by a
Christian authority."
And how does Bazan feel about
preachy bands like Creed?

"Well I don't re
ally like Creed's
music so that's the
main thing. Anyone
who's in a band like
that, the guy's kind
of flamboyant in a
way that's obnox
ious. His faith is . . .
scary. Just in gener
al, I wish that the
ya r 1 would disap
pear also. You
know, the Eddie
Vedder yarl. Actual
ly Eddie's kind of
lost it recently, and
that's kind of nice."
Sadly, he ex
plained that many
in the Christian
"camp" were disap
pointed by "Con
trol" 's lyrical con
tent, which they
found inappropriate

or offensive. He wishes people would
simply take the music for what it is.
And what is it to him? What does he
enjoy about making music?
"Just having an idea and then

working hard at it and recording it,"
answered the soft-spoken singer.
"That process for me is the thing
that makes everything move for
ward. It's fun to play shows and be
in front of people and stroke your
ego a little bit, but that's kinda emp
tier. If that was all that was going on,
I would probably not be doing it. It's
the process of getting an idea and
seeing it completed. Interacting
with that completed product over
and over again."
"I'll see a painting that Van Gogh
did and you can just see the connec
tion between the inspiration he felt
on a starry night, and then the final
product. That's what I'd really like to
do, feel satisfied that I'm expressing
myself and being true to the creative
process in a way that is really vital.
It's going to mean whatever it's going
to mean to other people. Toward the

end of my life I want to look back and
no matter what other people say, I
want to be able to say I accomplished
what 1 wanted. Making something
that seems alive and real to me."


The next Backstreet Boy?


They don't like Creed, so they're alright in our books.


A lion in his natural habitat.
