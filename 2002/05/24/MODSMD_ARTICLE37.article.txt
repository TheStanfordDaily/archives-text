Robinson's second version
of "Island Row" does not
lack is creativity. Sure, per
haps his critics are right,
and the songs are a little

disorganized, even disjointed at times; but it is this
stop-and-go feeling that gives his songs their original
flavor. By the end of this month, the CD by Robinson,
a.k.a. Capitol k, will at last be released in the United

States. Until now it was available
only in Europe, where its first ver
sion had already been introduced
in 2000 by a different record com
pany (Planet Mu).
Since then, K remixed two
songs, took two out (including the
cover of Prince's "Dance On") and
added two others ("Soundwaves"
and "Darrussalam"), in an attempt
to make the CD more focused and
less incoherent. The second ver-

sion was immediately successful in Europe, where the
track "Pillow" has already been lifted off the album as
a single. K chose an almost pop-like tone, a child-like
voice and nursery-rhyme lyrics for this love song.
Each of K's tracks attempts to evoke a different
emotion and describe a different experience. He ac
complishes this by interweaving multiple layers,

themes and top
ics into each song.
K's source of in
spiration is his
own life — his
childhood memo
ries as well as his
daily activities. In
the song "City," K
paints a musical
picture of his
hometown Lon
don — including
its road noise;
pollution and so
cial responsibili
ties. In contrast

"Darussalam" (Malay for
"abode of peace") reveals the
sounds of Borneo, where K
spent part of his life growing
up. K recorded the nature
sounds on this track himself on
a scientific platform in the mid-

dle of the rainforest .
Even though
there are many juxta
positions in K's music

and themes, everything about it remains
authentic. Life does not consist of only one
mood, experience or thought, and K
builds a credible collage of sound in order
to expose the listener to these dichotomies
of life. The almost diary-like, short story
tone accompanied by the sound's naturali
ty and rawness makes his CD so credible.
K's music is not the typical boring hybrid
between rock and electronica that has be
come so popular these past years. Rather
his CD is a stylish kaleidoscope of sounds,
drawn from a wide range of influences.
