# Cuomo's beard delivers the goods

### CHRIS LEE 
Despite the dramatic
comeback made with last
year's "Weezer," better
known as the "Green
Album," some Weezer
fans lamented that the
band had reneged on its
earlier musical develop-

merit — reproached by the tepid recep
tion to "Pinkterton," now ironically a cult
favorite, it appeared that the group (and
lead singer / songwriter Rivers Cuomo)
was in an artistic straightjacket. Take a
listen to the "Green Album" — which

this reviewer loved — and the evidence
seems pretty condemning: a collection of

10 songs, nearly all of
equal length and struc
ture (not to mention
emotional ambiguity). A
fun, respectable album,
but safe and stagnant.
"Maladroit"
doesn't quite fully alle-

viate those concerns, but there does exist
a renewed spirit of exploration. This
starts immediately with the opening
track, "American Gigolo," which is a nice
integration of a "Hash Pipe"-like
buzzing baseline with the more melodic

passages of "Green." Thank
fully, there is more contrast
provided to the sonic land
scape this time around —
"Death and Destruction" is a
slow, intimate musing reminis
cent of the classic "In the
Garage," and "Burnclt Jam" is
a beautifully soft melody inter
cut with rocking guitar. Those
craving "Pinkerton"-esque
self-loathing may get some
thing out of "Slob," with lyrics
like "I don't like how you're
living my life / Get yourself a
wife / Get yourself a job . . .
don't you be a slob." And in
case you didn't get enough,
"Possibilities" is a decent cook
ie-cutter song that would've fit
in perfectly on "Green."
In the end, though, it's
Cuomo's knack for wistful
melodies and catchy choruses
that shines through every
thing. "Love, barely alive" he
croons over and over again on
"Slave," bleeding your heart;
"Keep Fishin'" is a fun rocker
teeming with emotion under
neath; and "December" brings
a bittersweet close to the
album, reminiscent of

"Green" 's excellent closer
"O, Girlfriend." "Only
love," Cuomo desperately
sings, and we've got no
choice but to believe in it as
well. Ironically, it's the
album's likely singles —
"Dope Nose" and "Fall To
gether" — that seem the
most underdeveloped,
though they both feature
killer call-out choruses
that will probably cover up
their deficiencies.
The 13 cuts on "Mal
adroit" have supposedly
been culled from over 100
potential songs Cuomo has

written, and I find this fact more than a
little disturbing — many songs on the
album prove this won't necessarily be the
case, but I sincerely fear that Cuomo may

just continue to churn out three-minute
ditties one after another for the rest of his
career, never fully polishing any of them.
Don't get me wrong, everything on "Mal
adroit" is authentic Weezer, and wonder-

ful to listen to;
putting it in perspec
tive, though, none of
the songs have the
breathtaking impact
of an "Across the
Sea" or the timeless
quality of anything
on the original "Blue
Album." Or do they?
Much has been
made of Cuomo \s
status as a twisted ge
nius, a tireless musi
cal madman, and 1
believe it to be whol
ly justified. Even if
his thoughts are
never fully actual
ized in the music,
nearly everything
that does come out
is gold. And what
ever the outcome,
I'll follow Cuomo
and Weezer to the
very end.


Too maladroit to shave?
