### YOGESH RAUT 
I wrote this article in order to shine a light on 10
movies that I think very highly of and which are rel
atively unknown, even among film buffs. These films
do not represent a "10 Best" of anything. In order to
make the list as diverse as possible, I chose 10 major
genres and one film which I consider a masterpiece
from each of them.
"Sleuth" (1972, Mystery)
After noticing his friend Stephen Sondheim's fasci
nation with solving puzzles and playing games, play
wright Anthony Shaffer concocted his Tony Award
winning play "Sleuth," which he would later adapt
into one of the two best mystery films of the 1970'5.
(The other, "The Last of Sheila," was co-written by
Sondheim.) Upper-class snob and mystery writer An
drew Wyke (Laurence Olivier) is, like Sondheim, a
game-lover obsessed with winning at any cost.
Lower-class hairdresser Milo Tindle (Michael Caine)
has other things on his mind; he's having an affair
with Mrs. Wyke and wants to marry her. Fine, An
drew says, but first let's play a game. They end up
playing several, with increasingly high stakes and an
increasingly high level of viciousness. Shaffer's high
ly entertaining screenplay, which sticks very close to
his stage success, contains several enthralling plot
twists, and 4-time Academy Award-winner Joe
Mankiewicz does an excellent job of direction. Ken
Adam's amazing production design does a great job
at keeping the film from seeming stagebound, and
John Addison contributes a fun score, but the movie
really belongs to the two leads, both of whom give
virtuoso performances that were deservedly Oscar
nominated.
"Black Sunday" (1977, Action)
An intelligent action movie might seem to be a con
tradiction in terms, but master director John
Frankenheimer ("The Manchurian Candidate")
made one back in 1977. Based on a novel by Thomas
Harris ("The Silence of the Lambs"), "Black Sunday"
stars Robert Shaw ("Jaws") as Kabakov, an Israeli in
telligence agent trying to stop a terrorist plot to blow
up the Super Bowl. The terrorists are a Palestinian
woman (Marthe Keller) and a disenfranchised Viet
nam vet (Bruce Dern), who has a job piloting the
Goodyear Blimp. While these characters could have
been treated as larger-than-life cliches, the film
makes them painfully human—and in doing so, takes
a hard look at the Arab-Israeli conflict. The climax,
one of the greatest action set pieces in modern cine
ma, was shot at an actual Super Bowl —with real play
ers, fans, sportscasters and cheerleaders as extras —
and the resulting sense of realism is invaluable.
"Phenomena" (1985, Horror)
No listing of overlooked movies is complete without
a mention of Italian horror stylist Dario Argento.
Some might fault Argento's movies for lack of plot
coherence, but their hypnotic dreamlike flow and
the director's genuine feel for cinema more than re
deem any flaws. "Phenomena," Argento's most de
veloped film, synthesizes the two genres in which he
most frequently works: the murder mystery and the
supernatural thriller. Jennifer Connelly stars as a
girl who can communicate telepathically with in
sects; British horror vet Donald Pleasance co-stars as
an entomologist who teaches her how to use this
ability to catch a serial killer. "Phenomena" is vio
lent, gory and disturbing, and yet it is also undeni
ably beautiful, in a surreal, grotesque way. For hor
ror fans who are not familiar with Argento's work,
this is an ideal place to start.

[Editor's note: Dario Argento is a sick, sick fuck. I had
nightmares about mutant dwarfs and decapitation fora
week after watching this movie.]
"Koyaanisqatsi" (1983, Documentary)
Godfrey Reggio's groundbreaking non-narrative film
is not a documentary in the conventional sense;
rather, it is a hypnotic kaleidoscope of images, backed
by a highly influential minimalist score by Phillip
Glass. Although it can be enjoyed simply as a sound
and light show, there is a serious message. The title is
a Hopi Indian word meaning "life out of balance,"
and by contrasting urban sprawl with natural beauty,
Reggio tries to indicate that our modern industrial
society is simply too fast for its own good. Though this
is a rather naive hypothesis, "Koyaanisqatsi" is a sen
sory experience well worth having whether or not you
agree with its message.
"Medium Cool" (1969, Political)
The concept was deceptively simple. Working on an
extremely low budget, Academy Award-winning (ine
matographer Haskell Wexler wrote and directed a
story about a news cameraman (Robert Forster) who
quits his job for political reasons and falls in with a re
cently transplanted widow from West Virginia (Verna
Bloom) and her young son (Harold Blankenship).
Then Wexler went with a camera crew into Chicago
during the 1968 Democratic National Convention,
hoping to capture some of the tension built up by
racial and antiwar protests going on there. He ended
up getting more than lie bargained for, as a full-scale
riot broke out, and he was able to film his story right
in the middle of it. The result is "an extremely power
ful and totally unique statement about the way indi
viduals are affected by social and political move
ments, as well as a meditation on the political role of
the camera and of cinema itself. It is also an important
document of the forces that nearly tore America apart
in the '60s.
"Open Your Eyes" (1997, Sci-fi)
25-year-old wunderkind director Alejandro
Amenabar (in only his second feature!) drew on
sources ranging from Plato and Descartes to Freud
and Philip K. Dick and cinematic influences as diverse
as "Total Recall" and " The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" to
fashion this metaphysical tale. Eduardo Noriega stars
as Cesar, a handsome playboy who meets the love of
his life, Sofia (Penelope Cruz), only to be grotesquely
disfigured in a car accident—qr is he? Anticipating
"The Matrix" by two years, Amenabar plays the same
sort of reality-and-illusion puzzles. He relies less on
special effects, however, than subtle but effective
artistry and excellent performances from Noriega,
Cruz, Fele Martinez, Najwa Nimri and Chete Lera.
"Open Your Eyes" takes the viewer on a wild and
scary ride, with a destination far more profound than
that of its American counterpart.
"Tommy" (1975, Musical)
Director Ken Russell has had a wildly uneven career,
and despite a strong cult following he has rarely suc
ceeded in crossing over to the mainstream. "Tommy"
was his biggest commercial success, due no doubt to
the popularity of The Who's best-selling concept
album on which it is based. Russell turned it into a
gleefully over-the-top religious allegory, with mind
blowing psychedelic imagery and a soundtrack
recorded in the all-new "Quintaphonic" system. Ann-
Margret and Oliver Reed star as the parents of the
eponymous hero, a "deaf, dumb and blind kid" who
"sure plays a mean pinball." Additional musical num

bers are contributed by Elton John, Eric Clapton,
Tina Turner, Keith Moon, The Who and Jack Nichol
son (!). Be warned: "Tommy" is a rock OPERA, and as
a result all dialogue is sung, and the emotions are
sometimes disturbingly intense.
"Once Upon a Time in the West" (1969, Western)
Three sinister gunmen wait at a deserted train sta
tion. The train arrives. A Man (Charles Bronson) gets
off. The train departs. The Man notices that the wait
ing gunmen have only three horses between them.
"Looks like we're shy one horse," they explain. "No,"
the Man replies, reaching toward his holster. "You
brought two too many." So begins Sergio Leone's
classic Western, surely one of the greatest films not
available on DVD. (Why??) Leone's epic vision of the
development of the West, as reflected through a
landowning widow (Claudia Cardinale) and the three
men who fight to possess her (Bronson, Henry Fonda
and Jason Robards), completely transcends the label
"spaghetti Western." Leone and screenwriters
Bernardo Bertolucci and Dario Argento (both of
whom would go on to become highly successful direc
tors in their own right) used the tropes of the Western
genre, but reinterpreted them as elements of a grand
ly mythic opera. Ennio Morricone's brilliant score has
lost none of his impact, and Fonda's fans will never
forget the impact of seeing the ail-American star por
tray one of the most vicious villains, in cinema history.
"Ryan's Daughter" (1970, Epic)
When cinema buffs think of David Lean, they think of
the lavish, big-budget epics he direct from 1957 on
wards: "The Bridge on the River Kwai," "Lawrence of
Arabia," "Doctor Zhivago" and"A Passage to India."
Sadly forgotten is this 1970 masterpiece. Like
"Kwai," it deals with the struggle of humans against
their environment. Like "Lawrence," it is a penetrat
ing character study. And like Zhivago, it tells of a
doomed romance set against a backdrop of war and
revolution. Freddie Young's Oscar-winning cine
matography perfectly captures the most beautiful
parts of Ireland, and an international cast headed by
Robert Mitchum, Sarah Miles, Trevor Howard, John
Mills (who also won an Oscar for this film) and Leo
McKern give startlingly effective performances.
Robert Bolt's screenplay explores an extraordinarily
wide range of emotions in depth and Lean's direction
is brilliant as always, especially in a bravura sequence
involving a storm at sea. Although this film, too, is not
available on DVD, admirers of Lean would do well to
seek it out on video.
"Mon Oncle d'Amerique" (1980, Drama)
At the most superficial level, "Mon Oncle
d'Amerique" is the story of three French citizens — a
low-level executive (Gerard Depardieu), a slick politi
cian (Roger Pierre) and a semi-successful actress
(Nicole Garcia) — whose lives intersect briefly at a
moment of crisis before diverging again. But director
Alain Resnais, whose earlier films "Hiroshima Mon
Amour" and "Last Year at Marienbad" revolutionized
the use of editing and cinematography, is here out to
create a new kind of cinematic narrative. This is done
by introducing Dr. Henri Laborit (playing himself)
and his theories about the biological forces that drive
human behavior. By lightheartedly juxtaposing La
borit's theories with the main storyline, Resnais adds
an additional level to the film, and brings up many
profound questions about what kind of behavior is
truly "human." "Mon Oncle d'Amerique" is an ab
solutely one-of-a-kind film, and there is no way a sim
ple plot summary could describe the intricate emo
tional tapestry that Resnais and screenwriter Jean
Gruault weave. Just see it!

Amour" and "Last Year at Marienbad" revolutionized
the use of editing and cinematography, is here out to
create a new kind of cinematic narrative. This is done
by introducing Dr. Henri Laborit (playing himself)
and his theories about the biological forces that drive
human behavior. By lightheartedly juxtaposing La
borit's theories with the main storyline, Resnais adds
an additional level to the film, and brings up many
profound questions about what kind of behavior is
truly "human." "Mon Oncle d'Amerique" is an ab
solutely one-of-a-kind film, and there is no way a sim
ple plot summary could describe the intricate emo
tional tapestry that Resnais and screenwriter Jean
Gruault weave. Just see it!
I wrote this article in order to shine a light on 10
movies that I think very highly of and which are rel
atively unknown, even among film buffs. These films
do not represent a "10 Best" of anything. In order to
make the list as diverse as possible, I chose 10 major
genres and one film which I consider a masterpiece
from each of them.
"Sleuth" (1972, Mystery)
After noticing his friend Stephen Sondheim's fasci
nation with solving puzzles and playing games, play
wright Anthony Shaffer concocted his Tony Award
winning play "Sleuth," which he would later adapt
into one of the two best mystery films of the 1970'5.
(The other, "The Last of Sheila," was co-written by
Sondheim.) Upper-class snob and mystery writer An
drew Wyke (Laurence Olivier) is, like Sondheim, a
game-lover obsessed with winning at any cost.
Lower-class hairdresser Milo Tindle (Michael Caine)
has other things on his mind; he's having an affair
with Mrs. Wyke and wants to marry her. Fine, An
drew says, but first let's play a game. They end up
playing several, with increasingly high stakes and an
increasingly high level of viciousness. Shaffer's high
ly entertaining screenplay, which sticks very close to
his stage success, contains several enthralling plot
twists, and 4-time Academy Award-winner Joe
Mankiewicz does an excellent job of direction. Ken
Adam's amazing production design does a great job
at keeping the film from seeming stagebound, and
John Addison contributes a fun score, but the movie
really belongs to the two leads, both of whom give
virtuoso performances that were deservedly Oscar
nominated.
"Black Sunday" (1977, Action)
An intelligent action movie might seem to be a con
tradiction in terms, but master director John
Frankenheimer ("The Manchurian Candidate")
made one back in 1977. Based on a novel by Thomas
Harris ("The Silence of the Lambs"), "Black Sunday"
stars Robert Shaw ("Jaws") as Kabakov, an Israeli in
telligence agent trying to stop a terrorist plot to blow
up the Super Bowl. The terrorists are a Palestinian
woman (Marthe Keller) and a disenfranchised Viet
nam vet (Bruce Dern), who has a job piloting the
Goodyear Blimp. While these characters could have
been treated as larger-than-life cliches, the film
makes them painfully human—and in doing so, takes
a hard look at the Arab-Israeli conflict. The climax,
one of the greatest action set pieces in modern cine
ma, was shot at an actual Super Bowl —with real play
ers, fans, sportscasters and cheerleaders as extras —
and the resulting sense of realism is invaluable.
"Phenomena" (1985, Horror)
No listing of overlooked movies is complete without
a mention of Italian horror stylist Dario Argento.
Some might fault Argento's movies for lack of plot
coherence, but their hypnotic dreamlike flow and
the director's genuine feel for cinema more than re
deem any flaws. "Phenomena," Argento's most de
veloped film, synthesizes the two genres in which he
most frequently works: the murder mystery and the
supernatural thriller. Jennifer Connelly stars as a
girl who can communicate telepathically with in
sects; British horror vet Donald Pleasance co-stars as
an entomologist who teaches her how to use this
ability to catch a serial killer. "Phenomena" is vio
lent, gory and disturbing, and yet it is also undeni
ably beautiful, in a surreal, grotesque way. For hor
ror fans who are not familiar with Argento's work,
this is an ideal place to start.

[Editor's note: Dario Argento is a sick, sick fuck. I had
nightmares about mutant dwarfs and decapitation fora
week after watching this movie.]
"Koyaanisqatsi" (1983, Documentary)
Godfrey Reggio's groundbreaking non-narrative film
is not a documentary in the conventional sense;
rather, it is a hypnotic kaleidoscope of images, backed
by a highly influential minimalist score by Phillip
Glass. Although it can be enjoyed simply as a sound
and light show, there is a serious message. The title is
a Hopi Indian word meaning "life out of balance,"
and by contrasting urban sprawl with natural beauty,
Reggio tries to indicate that our modern industrial
society is simply too fast for its own good. Though this
is a rather naive hypothesis, "Koyaanisqatsi" is a sen
sory experience well worth having whether or not you
agree with its message.
"Medium Cool" (1969, Political)
The concept was deceptively simple. Working on an
extremely low budget, Academy Award-winning (ine
matographer Haskell Wexler wrote and directed a
story about a news cameraman (Robert Forster) who
quits his job for political reasons and falls in with a re
cently transplanted widow from West Virginia (Verna
Bloom) and her young son (Harold Blankenship).
Then Wexler went with a camera crew into Chicago
during the 1968 Democratic National Convention,
hoping to capture some of the tension built up by
racial and antiwar protests going on there. He ended
up getting more than lie bargained for, as a full-scale
riot broke out, and he was able to film his story right
in the middle of it. The result is "an extremely power
ful and totally unique statement about the way indi
viduals are affected by social and political move
ments, as well as a meditation on the political role of
the camera and of cinema itself. It is also an important
document of the forces that nearly tore America apart
in the '60s.
"Open Your Eyes" (1997, Sci-fi)
25-year-old wunderkind director Alejandro
Amenabar (in only his second feature!) drew on
sources ranging from Plato and Descartes to Freud
and Philip K. Dick and cinematic influences as diverse
as "Total Recall" and " The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" to
fashion this metaphysical tale. Eduardo Noriega stars
as Cesar, a handsome playboy who meets the love of
his life, Sofia (Penelope Cruz), only to be grotesquely
disfigured in a car accident—qr is he? Anticipating
"The Matrix" by two years, Amenabar plays the same
sort of reality-and-illusion puzzles. He relies less on
special effects, however, than subtle but effective
artistry and excellent performances from Noriega,
Cruz, Fele Martinez, Najwa Nimri and Chete Lera.
"Open Your Eyes" takes the viewer on a wild and
scary ride, with a destination far more profound than
that of its American counterpart.
"Tommy" (1975, Musical)
Director Ken Russell has had a wildly uneven career,
and despite a strong cult following he has rarely suc
ceeded in crossing over to the mainstream. "Tommy"
was his biggest commercial success, due no doubt to
the popularity of The Who's best-selling concept
album on which it is based. Russell turned it into a
gleefully over-the-top religious allegory, with mind
blowing psychedelic imagery and a soundtrack
recorded in the all-new "Quintaphonic" system. Ann-
Margret and Oliver Reed star as the parents of the
eponymous hero, a "deaf, dumb and blind kid" who
"sure plays a mean pinball." Additional musical num

bers are contributed by Elton John, Eric Clapton,
Tina Turner, Keith Moon, The Who and Jack Nichol
son (!). Be warned: "Tommy" is a rock OPERA, and as
a result all dialogue is sung, and the emotions are
sometimes disturbingly intense.
"Once Upon a Time in the West" (1969, Western)
Three sinister gunmen wait at a deserted train sta
tion. The train arrives. A Man (Charles Bronson) gets
off. The train departs. The Man notices that the wait
ing gunmen have only three horses between them.
"Looks like we're shy one horse," they explain. "No,"
the Man replies, reaching toward his holster. "You
brought two too many." So begins Sergio Leone's
classic Western, surely one of the greatest films not
available on DVD. (Why??) Leone's epic vision of the
development of the West, as reflected through a
landowning widow (Claudia Cardinale) and the three
men who fight to possess her (Bronson, Henry Fonda
and Jason Robards), completely transcends the label
"spaghetti Western." Leone and screenwriters
Bernardo Bertolucci and Dario Argento (both of
whom would go on to become highly successful direc
tors in their own right) used the tropes of the Western
genre, but reinterpreted them as elements of a grand
ly mythic opera. Ennio Morricone's brilliant score has
lost none of his impact, and Fonda's fans will never
forget the impact of seeing the ail-American star por
tray one of the most vicious villains, in cinema history.
"Ryan's Daughter" (1970, Epic)
When cinema buffs think of David Lean, they think of
the lavish, big-budget epics he direct from 1957 on
wards: "The Bridge on the River Kwai," "Lawrence of
Arabia," "Doctor Zhivago" and"A Passage to India."
Sadly forgotten is this 1970 masterpiece. Like
"Kwai," it deals with the struggle of humans against
their environment. Like "Lawrence," it is a penetrat
ing character study. And like Zhivago, it tells of a
doomed romance set against a backdrop of war and
revolution. Freddie Young's Oscar-winning cine
matography perfectly captures the most beautiful
parts of Ireland, and an international cast headed by
Robert Mitchum, Sarah Miles, Trevor Howard, John
Mills (who also won an Oscar for this film) and Leo
McKern give startlingly effective performances.
Robert Bolt's screenplay explores an extraordinarily
wide range of emotions in depth and Lean's direction
is brilliant as always, especially in a bravura sequence
involving a storm at sea. Although this film, too, is not
available on DVD, admirers of Lean would do well to
seek it out on video.
"Mon Oncle d'Amerique" (1980, Drama)
At the most superficial level, "Mon Oncle
d'Amerique" is the story of three French citizens — a
low-level executive (Gerard Depardieu), a slick politi
cian (Roger Pierre) and a semi-successful actress
(Nicole Garcia) — whose lives intersect briefly at a
moment of crisis before diverging again. But director
Alain Resnais, whose earlier films "Hiroshima Mon
Amour" and "Last Year at Marienbad" revolutionized
the use of editing and cinematography, is here out to
create a new kind of cinematic narrative. This is done
by introducing Dr. Henri Laborit (playing himself)

wide range of emotions in depth and Lean's direction
is brilliant as always, especially in a bravura sequence
involving a storm at sea. Although this film, too, is not
available on DVD, admirers of Lean would do well to
seek it out on video.
"Mon Oncle d'Amerique" (1980, Drama)
At the most superficial level, "Mon Oncle
d'Amerique" is the story of three French citizens — a
low-level executive (Gerard Depardieu), a slick politi
cian (Roger Pierre) and a semi-successful actress
(Nicole Garcia) — whose lives intersect briefly at a
moment of crisis before diverging again. But director
Alain Resnais, whose earlier films "Hiroshima Mon
Amour" and "Last Year at Marienbad" revolutionized
the use of editing and cinematography, is here out to
create a new kind of cinematic narrative. This is done
by introducing Dr. Henri Laborit (playing himself)
and his theories about the biological forces that drive
human behavior. By lightheartedly juxtaposing La
borit's theories with the main storyline, Resnais adds
an additional level to the film, and brings up many
profound questions about what kind of behavior is
truly "human." "Mon Oncle d'Amerique" is an ab
solutely one-of-a-kind film, and there is no way a sim
ple plot summary could describe the intricate emo
tional tapestry that Resnais and screenwriter Jean
Gruault weave. Just see it!
I wrote this article in order to shine a light on 10
movies that I think very highly of and which are rel
atively unknown, even among film buffs. These films
do not represent a "10 Best" of anything. In order to
make the list as diverse as possible, I chose 10 major
genres and one film which I consider a masterpiece
from each of them.
"Sleuth" (1972, Mystery)
After noticing his friend Stephen Sondheim's fasci
nation with solving puzzles and playing games, play
wright Anthony Shaffer concocted his Tony Award
winning play "Sleuth," which he would later adapt
into one of the two best mystery films of the 1970'5.
(The other, "The Last of Sheila," was co-written by
Sondheim.) Upper-class snob and mystery writer An
drew Wyke (Laurence Olivier) is, like Sondheim, a
game-lover obsessed with winning at any cost.
Lower-class hairdresser Milo Tindle (Michael Caine)
has other things on his mind; he's having an affair
with Mrs. Wyke and wants to marry her. Fine, An
drew says, but first let's play a game. They end up
playing several, with increasingly high stakes and an
increasingly high level of viciousness. Shaffer's high
ly entertaining screenplay, which sticks very close to
his stage success, contains several enthralling plot
twists, and 4-time Academy Award-winner Joe
Mankiewicz does an excellent job of direction. Ken
Adam's amazing production design does a great job
at keeping the film from seeming stagebound, and
John Addison contributes a fun score, but the movie
really belongs to the two leads, both of whom give
virtuoso performances that were deservedly Oscar
nominated.
"Black Sunday" (1977, Action)
An intelligent action movie might seem to be a con
tradiction in terms, but master director John
Frankenheimer ("The Manchurian Candidate")
made one back in 1977. Based on a novel by Thomas
Harris ("The Silence of the Lambs"), "Black Sunday"
stars Robert Shaw ("Jaws") as Kabakov, an Israeli in
telligence agent trying to stop a terrorist plot to blow
up the Super Bowl. The terrorists are a Palestinian
woman (Marthe Keller) and a disenfranchised Viet
nam vet (Bruce Dern), who has a job piloting the
Goodyear Blimp. While these characters could have
been treated as larger-than-life cliches, the film
makes them painfully human—and in doing so, takes
a hard look at the Arab-Israeli conflict. The climax,
one of the greatest action set pieces in modern cine
ma, was shot at an actual Super Bowl —with real play
ers, fans, sportscasters and cheerleaders as extras —
and the resulting sense of realism is invaluable.
"Phenomena" (1985, Horror)
No listing of overlooked movies is complete without
a mention of Italian horror stylist Dario Argento.
Some might fault Argento's movies for lack of plot
coherence, but their hypnotic dreamlike flow and
the director's genuine feel for cinema more than re
deem any flaws. "Phenomena," Argento's most de
veloped film, synthesizes the two genres in which he
most frequently works: the murder mystery and the
supernatural thriller. Jennifer Connelly stars as a
girl who can communicate telepathically with in
sects; British horror vet Donald Pleasance co-stars as
an entomologist who teaches her how to use this
ability to catch a serial killer. "Phenomena" is vio
lent, gory and disturbing, and yet it is also undeni
ably beautiful, in a surreal, grotesque way. For hor
ror fans who are not familiar with Argento's work,
this is an ideal place to start.

[Editor's note: Dario Argento is a sick, sick fuck. I had
nightmares about mutant dwarfs and decapitation fora
week after watching this movie.]
"Koyaanisqatsi" (1983, Documentary)
Godfrey Reggio's groundbreaking non-narrative film
is not a documentary in the conventional sense;
rather, it is a hypnotic kaleidoscope of images, backed
by a highly influential minimalist score by Phillip
Glass. Although it can be enjoyed simply as a sound
and light show, there is a serious message. The title is
a Hopi Indian word meaning "life out of balance,"
and by contrasting urban sprawl with natural beauty,
Reggio tries to indicate that our modern industrial
society is simply too fast for its own good. Though this
is a rather naive hypothesis, "Koyaanisqatsi" is a sen
sory experience well worth having whether or not you
agree with its message.
"Medium Cool" (1969, Political)
The concept was deceptively simple. Working on an
extremely low budget, Academy Award-winning (ine
matographer Haskell Wexler wrote and directed a
story about a news cameraman (Robert Forster) who
quits his job for political reasons and falls in with a re
cently transplanted widow from West Virginia (Verna
Bloom) and her young son (Harold Blankenship).
Then Wexler went with a camera crew into Chicago
during the 1968 Democratic National Convention,
hoping to capture some of the tension built up by
racial and antiwar protests going on there. He ended
up getting more than lie bargained for, as a full-scale
riot broke out, and he was able to film his story right
in the middle of it. The result is "an extremely power
ful and totally unique statement about the way indi
viduals are affected by social and political move
ments, as well as a meditation on the political role of
the camera and of cinema itself. It is also an important
document of the forces that nearly tore America apart
in the '60s.
"Open Your Eyes" (1997, Sci-fi)
25-year-old wunderkind director Alejandro
Amenabar (in only his second feature!) drew on
sources ranging from Plato and Descartes to Freud
and Philip K. Dick and cinematic influences as diverse
as "Total Recall" and " The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" to
fashion this metaphysical tale. Eduardo Noriega stars
as Cesar, a handsome playboy who meets the love of
his life, Sofia (Penelope Cruz), only to be grotesquely
disfigured in a car accident—qr is he? Anticipating
"The Matrix" by two years, Amenabar plays the same
sort of reality-and-illusion puzzles. He relies less on
special effects, however, than subtle but effective
artistry and excellent performances from Noriega,
Cruz, Fele Martinez, Najwa Nimri and Chete Lera.
"Open Your Eyes" takes the viewer on a wild and
scary ride, with a destination far more profound than
that of its American counterpart.
"Tommy" (1975, Musical)
Director Ken Russell has had a wildly uneven career,
and despite a strong cult following he has rarely suc
ceeded in crossing over to the mainstream. "Tommy"
was his biggest commercial success, due no doubt to
the popularity of The Who's best-selling concept
album on which it is based. Russell turned it into a
gleefully over-the-top religious allegory, with mind
blowing psychedelic imagery and a soundtrack
recorded in the all-new "Quintaphonic" system. Ann-
Margret and Oliver Reed star as the parents of the
eponymous hero, a "deaf, dumb and blind kid" who
"sure plays a mean pinball." Additional musical num

bers are contributed by Elton John, Eric Clapton,
Tina Turner, Keith Moon, The Who and Jack Nichol
son (!). Be warned: "Tommy" is a rock OPERA, and as
a result all dialogue is sung, and the emotions are
sometimes disturbingly intense.
"Once Upon a Time in the West" (1969, Western)
Three sinister gunmen wait at a deserted train sta
tion. The train arrives. A Man (Charles Bronson) gets
off. The train departs. The Man notices that the wait
ing gunmen have only three horses between them.
"Looks like we're shy one horse," they explain. "No,"
the Man replies, reaching toward his holster. "You
brought two too many." So begins Sergio Leone's
classic Western, surely one of the greatest films not
available on DVD. (Why??) Leone's epic vision of the
development of the West, as reflected through a
landowning widow (Claudia Cardinale) and the three
men who fight to possess her (Bronson, Henry Fonda
and Jason Robards), completely transcends the label
"spaghetti Western." Leone and screenwriters
Bernardo Bertolucci and Dario Argento (both of
whom would go on to become highly successful direc
tors in their own right) used the tropes of the Western
genre, but reinterpreted them as elements of a grand
ly mythic opera. Ennio Morricone's brilliant score has
lost none of his impact, and Fonda's fans will never
forget the impact of seeing the ail-American star por
tray one of the most vicious villains, in cinema history.
"Ryan's Daughter" (1970, Epic)
When cinema buffs think of David Lean, they think of
the lavish, big-budget epics he direct from 1957 on
wards: "The Bridge on the River Kwai," "Lawrence of
Arabia," "Doctor Zhivago" and"A Passage to India."
Sadly forgotten is this 1970 masterpiece. Like
"Kwai," it deals with the struggle of humans against
their environment. Like "Lawrence," it is a penetrat
ing character study. And like Zhivago, it tells of a
doomed romance set against a backdrop of war and
revolution. Freddie Young's Oscar-winning cine
matography perfectly captures the most beautiful
parts of Ireland, and an international cast headed by
Robert Mitchum, Sarah Miles, Trevor Howard, John
Mills (who also won an Oscar for this film) and Leo
McKern give startlingly effective performances.
Robert Bolt's screenplay explores an extraordinarily
wide range of emotions in depth and Lean's direction
is brilliant as always, especially in a bravura sequence
involving a storm at sea. Although this film, too, is not
available on DVD, admirers of Lean would do well to
seek it out on video.
"Mon Oncle d'Amerique" (1980, Drama)
At the most superficial level, "Mon Oncle
d'Amerique" is the story of three French citizens — a

cian (Roger Pierre) and a semi-successful actress
