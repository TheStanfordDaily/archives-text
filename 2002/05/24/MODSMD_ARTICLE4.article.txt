The Mechanical Engineering Department held an
open house yesterday to showcase the new Mechani
cal Engineering Research Laboratory.
The building, located on Panama Mall near the
Mitchell Earth Sciences Building, was open for people
explore the new facilities.
The ceremony began with acknowledging faculty,
staff and administrators who were involved in the de
velopment and construction of the building.
Mechanical Engineering Prof. Christopher Ed
wards, who specializes in thermodynamics, complet
ed the ribbon-cutting ceremony with a blow torch.
The laboratory, which has been planned for five
years and cost about $25 million to build, contains
space for various engineering pursuits. It will allow
for collaboration between students and professors
and lab work for research within the department that
would not have been possible before.
However, despite its name, the building will not be
used solely for research purposes. It will also be used
by both graduate and students for
classes and research.
Prof. Ronald Hanson, Chair of the Mechanical En
gineering Department, said, "The building is primar
ily for graduate research, but space has also been allo
cated for undergraduate instruction and projects."
There are three large labs for undergraduate pro
ject-based and laboratory instruction.
Sophomore Jennifer McDonald was very pleased
