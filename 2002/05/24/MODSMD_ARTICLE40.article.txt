# Clinic and Radiohead ... bands separated at birth?
## 
### KARAN MAHAJAN 
1 n all honesty, everything I
say, do or feel is related — in
the holistic scheme of things
—to Radiohead. However,
that said, I am enamored of
"Walking With Thee," not be
cause Clinic is Radiohead's fa
vorite band, but because this

is one album that rises above the post-mil
lennial gloom of its themes to truly, madly,
mercilessly live.
Yet, 1 am somewhat bitter about this
album. In recent conversations with friends,
toes, professors, grandparents, zoo-keepers
and palients-tied-to-their-beds 1 have been
known to bring up and discuss extensively
the extremely important question on which
depends the fate of rock V roll — what will
Radiohead's next album be like? 1 had
imagined it to be a combination of garage
rock elements with melodies that strove to
break the confines of bleak existentialism
and instruments that revered and reversed
notions rather than violated it. But Clinic
has made such an album. They beat Radio
head to it! No one's supposed to ever beat
my Radiohead!
Not convinced that Clinic is special?

mances while attired in surgical outfits,
masks and random bloodstain for kicks —

magically combine
paranoia, Velvet
Underground fuzz,
Floydian-psyche
delia and rough
hewn rock sounds
on this great album.
The Radiohead

influence is clear in the tormented pathos of
the music, its chilling, millennial atmosphere
and even the v<x:als of Blackburn, vocals.
But unlike "Amnesiac" or "Kid A" —
both of which were as much a part of that at
mosphere as they were decriers of it —
"Walking With Thee" is groovier, cooler
and spunkier.
For starters, organs and haunting vibra
phones feature prominently on the album.
They lend the album a '60s / '70s feel that is
different from the retro-style in vogue these
days (flaunted so shamelessly by The
Strokes and The Hives). The opening track,
"Harmony," begins with desperate synthe
sizer tones and a drunken vibraphone that
is alternatively happy and sad. The beat is
bouncy and is a precursor to the groovy
tracks that follow.
The Velvet Underground influence is ob
vious on "Pet-Eunuch" (a shorter "Sister
Ray"?) and the dreamy-pale-blue-eyed "Mr.

Moonlight" ("People in the shows
are just people in the shows / Rush
them on the sands and all go home").
The lyrics are quirky yet earnest. On
"Pet-Eunuch," Blackburn's voice is
obscured by a hazy halo of punkish,
pounding guitars while the synth
beats in the background like a time
bomb; the joy lies in mentally sepa
rating and observing the various ele
ments that fuel this beautiful fuzz.
The title track uses organs exten
sively; the moment of silence created
in the midst of the spiraling chords
and the scared incantation-ary cho
rus allows Blackburn to shout "no"

before everything closes onto him in one
glowering, snarling ass-kicker of a song.
Many tracks are like livelier Radiohead
songs; they could possibly even be dance
tracks. Imagine taking "Idioteque" (from
"Kid A"), reducing the distance and atmos
phere, dousing it in a nice hook, and you've
(perhaps) imagined "Equalizer," "The Vul
ture" and "Come Into My Room." The
album ends on the serene, minimalist yet
unsettling notes of "For The Wars," which
sounds like a new-age psychedelic "Scar
borough Fair" — "you're all made up for
the wars".
' The album is wonderful, if a bit obvious in
its influences. That doesn't disturb me. I

guess that's because the album and I have
the same influences. I hate being a "con
sumer guide" (All! Those unsullied bastions
of rock criticism!), but if you listen to Radio
head you ought to buy this album. And if you
don't listen to Radiohead, then listen to Clin
ic first. You might just start appreciating Ra
diohead. Or Clinic. Or both.
Oh, and you should thank me lor my re
straint in making cliched puns about Clinic
be "patient" with the album; they wield their
"instruments"; this is "anesthetic for the soul,
dude"; the album is my friend; it's "walking
with me!"; they're so awesome I want to
"check myself in to the clinic."
Okay, I'll stop.


We've run out of medical puns. Damn you, Karan!
