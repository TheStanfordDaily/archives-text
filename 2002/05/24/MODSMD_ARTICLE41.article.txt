# Yee-haw! Do-si-do! Intermission and Raitt!

Bonnie Raitt is nothing if not a veter
an. Having played guitar for more than
four decades and made albums for
more than three, it is all the more re
markable that the last dozen years have
been her most successful yet, starting
with her Capitol debut "Nick of Time"

and follow-up "Luck of the Draw." Following these with two
more studio albums and a live one, Raiit's now back again with
"Silver Lining," an album that shows that she can still make
beautiful music.
This is her second album with production team Tchad
Blake and Mitchell Froom, well known for their work with
Suzanne Vega, Crowded House and Elvis Costello. Like Don

Was did on "Time" and "Draw," Blake and Froom reign in
their experimental tendencies to co-produce with Rait t and let

her shine on what she does best — soulfully
singing traditionally-constructed American
pop music.
This is the genre dubbed adult contempo
rary, one unfortunately associated with
Kenny G, Michael Bolton and Rod Stewart.
Jazz and the blues are not, however, reduced

to mush in the hand of Rait t and her collaborators, but rather
merely given a sleek shine, as on the rough but crystal clear
"Gnawin' on It." "Time of Our Lives" is a lyrical and musical
sequel to her hit about rumors leading to love, "Something to
Talk About." Songs like "Hear Me Lord," with its mixture of
various genres of Old and New World dance music, keep up
enough variety to keep this from sounding like just another

reliable and respectable artist reselling old wares.
Where Raitt really shines, however, is on the ballads, as any
one who's heard her heartbreaking "I Can't Make You Love
Me" can attest. "Wherever You May Be," about a lost love, and
"Wounded Heart," about a seemingly impossible attempt to
move on afterwards, are the other ballads on this album, and
done well they are. Like the other songs on the album, they are
age-appropriate, with a mature attitude toward love.
Granted, there aren't any shocking flashes of inspiration on
this album, but that's best left to the young; and it's much bet
ter to have 12 very good tracks on an album than one great
one surrounded by filler. The singer herself wrote only three
tracks, but she leaves her distinctive mark on all of them. "Sil
ver Lining" is a strong album of tender moments, one in which
Bonnie Raitt shows that she still has something to talk about,
and a great way of relating it as well.
