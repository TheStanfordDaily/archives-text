# Should she be worried?

### 
Dear Milo the Dog,
I recently learned that my boyfriend watches porn with his
friends and masturbates. I feel somewhat betrayed. Should I
consider his behavior a form of cheating?
Sincerely,
Confused While My Boyfriend Wacks His Weiner
Dear Confused,
Let me begin by telling you a little story. When 1 was
about 14, I read that each night, you dream about the
last thing you were thinking about before dozing off.
Being 14, I came to the brilliant realization that I could
spend a half-hour imagining the beautiful woman of my
choosing and then proceed to have a marvelously vivid
dream about violating various Biblical conventions with
her throughout the night. Yes, even at that young age,
I had already demonstrated a propensity toward char
acteristically male innovative thinking.
The problem was, however, that I rarely remem
bered my dreams. Then, one day, it happened. I had
remembered my dream!
Unfortunately, my deep plan for nocturnal sexual
fulfillment had gone awry. It seems I had just dreamed
about being one of the X-Men and that I had just
fought Magneto and Mr. Sinister alongside Cyclops,
Beast, Wolverine and Jean Crey. My superpower was
the ability to redirect the Magneto's energy field at
tacks back at him.

Ah, to be 14 once again.
The point is this: in addition to bring somewhat stu
pid, men have very different sexual minds than women.
Should you be concerned about this? The answer is

somewhat complex.
Generally speaking, if your companion has just
watched one or two porn films with his friend, there's
no reason to be concerned. This is a ritual of male bond
ing that, though somewhat awkward for everyone in
volved, is bound to occur from time to time. Men like
naked women. Especially attractive to men are sex
crazed, naked women begging mediocre actors to fuck
the sensation out of their nervous systems. As for the
masturbation, there are a couple of ways to judge
whether or not it is healthy.
The first thing that you should know is that men mas
turbate. Don't believe anyone who tells yon otherwise.
For many men, this is a healthy way to relieve sexual
tension when their wives or girlfriends are either not
present or have a headache or something. However,
some men can develop an obsessive attitude toward
porn and masturbation, developing a habit that can
leave their partners alienated.
If you feel that your boyfriend gets more sexual ful
fillment from his porn than from being with you, there
is an obvious problem. Additionally, if you ever get the
impression that he prefers masturbation to your com
pany, there is a definite problem. He probably needs to
seek counseling.
In his famous interview with Playboy magazine in
the late '70s, Jimmy Carter confessed that, at times, he
had committed adultery in his own heart. Your
boyfriend might masturbate once in a while. He might
even think of another woman while doing it. There's a
huge difference, however, between an occasional fan
tasy or daydream and a mindset that will eventually de
stroy a relationship.
There can be a healthy place for masturbation in
every relationship, but both parties need to agree on
this. Most importantly, don't be afraid to challenge
your boyfriend if you feel hurt by his behavior.
