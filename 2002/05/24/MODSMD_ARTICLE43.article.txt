# A 						nostalgic return to the glory days of the '90s

### ALEJANDRO TAGLIABUE 
By March of 1990,
Acid House, as the out
door rave movement
became known, was
blowing up all over the
UK at an unstoppable'
pace. At this time "con
ventional" rock bands

were absorbing these
high-BPM musical influences. The
Happy Mondays, the Stone Roses and
New Order were all busy redefining the
division between traditional "rock" and
"dance" music.
Against this backdrop Primal Scream,
previously known for attempting rea
sonable Stonesy rock on its previous two
albums, moved from its native Glasgow
to Brighton. Drugs and the band's love
of the new movement profoundly influ
enced the metamorphosis it underwent
on "Screamadelica." The founding
members of the group, Bobby Gillespie
and childhood friends Andrew Innes
and Robert Young (all regular ravers),
recruited London-based club DJ An
drew Weatherall (now of On-U Sound
dub fame) to remix a track from their
previous eponymous album. This be
came "Loaded" and proved to be a hit
with the club goers, slowly climbing to

no. 12 in the UK charts. Another remix
by Terry Farley soon moved "Come To-

gether" to new
ground as well and
these two singles, al
tered markedly from
their original form,
were the genesis of
"Screamadelica."
The band con-

tinued to explore
new tangents in their musical visions,
flushed with the loved-up, optimistic,
community-spirited, MDMA-soaked
vibe. Odes to change, drugs, love and
hope in all forms punctuate the songs.
The opening beats of the album al
ways lift my spirits. "Moving On Up,"
which opens the proceedings, is a
gospel, kind-of-Stonesy tune, yet betrays
the new direction to come. This kicks in
on "Slip Inside this House" as bustling
beats and a tight arrangement rise and
fall hypnotically through the 13th Floor
Elevators original.
"Higher Than the Sun" is the most
obvious elegy to F: "My brightest star's
my inner light, let it guide me / Experi
ence and innocence bleed inside me/
Hallucinogens can open me or untie
me." First under The Orb's direction
and then extended and beautifully re
worked by Weatherall into "A dub sym

phony in two parts," the song is a sound
track to the nature of the times: every
one loved everyone, there was no fric
tion and anything was possible. Gille

spie, not known for his "full range"
singing voice, assumes an almost ethere
al presence, his vocals seemingly float
ing above the music.

"Inner Flight" crawls,
winding its way on a jour
ney of sound, dragging you
into its instrumental bliss.
The aforementioned
remixes of "Come Togeth
er" and "Loaded" reinject
the party vibes and press
home the "fusionary" na
ture of the record. The
opening sample of "Come
Together" explicitly ques
tions all genre barriers:
"Music is Music." You've
gotta bet this was carefully
chosen.
We slide out of "Screa
madelica" slowly, losing
ourselves in the structures
of the final few songs, twist
ing with the melodies, float
ing on out there with them.
"I watch you dance, you
look so happy / Lost in a
moment of abandon,
you're set free . . ." And so
we were; everyone was
dancing, spirits roused
from apathy.
