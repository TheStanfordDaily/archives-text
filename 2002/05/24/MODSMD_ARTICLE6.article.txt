# Hoover Archives a hidden resource
## 
### AMELIA DELAPAZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Elena Danielson has a difficult job. As
the director of the I loover Library and
Archives, she works with decades-old
documents, making them available and
interesting to the modern, hi-tech Stan
ford students of today—not to mention to
those of the future.
While most students know about and
use Green Library and the other libraries

at Stanford, the Hoover Archives are an
underutilized, yet extremely rich re
source to the Stanford community.
Though the archives are open to any
one who wants to use them, whether af
filiated with Stanford University or not,
many students do not know what the
archives have to offer.
When asked about what the archives
contained, several freshmen suggested
artistic items or legal documents. In fact,
it collects both. Danielson said, "We want

one-of-a-kind items or things that are
printed for one moment in history."
Freshman HannaChiou said that she
didn't know about the archives because
there had never been any general orien
tation or informational sessions about
them.
Danielson agrees that the archives are
not used as much as they could be. "Our
big push is to make the documents more
accessible," she said.
In her attempt to have students
become familiar with the archives,
she has invited writing classes to
tour the archives. Right now, ap
proximately 25 percent of the Pro
gram in Writing and Rhetoric
classes incorporate this tour into
their curriculum.
Senior Kevin Lim said that he
had toured the archives in his
freshman writing class but was still
intimidated by them.
"I've always wanted to use them.
It seems like there's a lot of cool ar
tifacts and objects but I feel like I
haven't been trained to take such
raw, undigested information and
turn it into something I could use,"
Lim said.
The library offers an over
whelming number of resources to
explore. The collection, which is
part of the Hoover Institute, con
tains over 1 million books and (50
million documents, including
100,000 posters. Almost all of these
documents are primary sources.
For students who are looking
for more general information, the
specificity of the documents can be
as much of a challenge as the num
ber. Freshman Dan Anthony used
the archives because they had the
only copy of a book he needed but
feels he was not able to take full ad
vantage of them.
"I think it is a great archive and
the system would be great for spe
cialization when you need original
documents but it was not so effec
tive for books," Anthony said.
As Danielson works to modern
ize the archives, in order to make
them more accessbible to the com
munity, she tries to keep faithful to
the original mission of the archives.
Danielson has an impressive
legacy to keep up with. Since Her
bert Hoover established the
archives in 1919, the "collecting ef
forts have sought to document the
greatest issues of our time: war,
revolution and peace," as the
Hoover Institution's brochure
states.
I'he archives span broad areas,
both geographically and temporal
ly. There are documents from all
over the world and spanning al
most the entire 20th century, with a
few documents from earlier peri

ods as well. Half of these docu
ments are in English and about a
quarter are in Slavic languages —
demonstrative of the international
quality of the collection.
The global focus of the archives
is appropriate, considering that the
archives date back to World War I.
When the war broke out in Eu
rope, Hoover, a Stanford graduate
with a degree in geology, was living
in London. He was a very success
ful businessman working in min
ing, but his horror at the war
caused him to turn his attention to
public service.
He was extremely interested in
the.causes of World War I. Con
cerned that many of the first
hand accounts and primary docu
ments would disappear after the
war, like those of previous war pe
riods had, he set out to collect im
portant documents from all over

Europe. Thus the Hoover
Archives were born.
Hoover continued to finance
and make donations to the archives
until his death.
Even today, most of the new ad
ditions are the result of the gifts of
generous donors. The approxi
mately 10 percent of the collection
that the archives has purchased has
been obtained through gifts made
by families of the people involved
in whatever conflict the document
pertains to.
The kinds of documents in the
archives tend to relate to then-cur
rent events. For example, during
the Cold War, there was a large in
flux of Russian and Eastern Euro
pean documents.
Most of all, the archives want
documents that "explain the inner
logic of disasters of the 20th centu
ry," Danielson said.


The Stanford Daily Archive
The Hoover Library and Archives houses over 1 million books and 60 million
documents, including 100,000 posters. Several PWR classes have toured the
archives to allow students to become familiar with the archives.
