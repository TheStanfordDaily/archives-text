As the school year conies to a
close, junior Monica Henestroza
and sophomore Nick Rodriguez,
the new ASSU president and vice
president, prepare to put into ac
tion their campaign promises of
promoting student interests and
university accountability.
According to Henestroza, their
primary goal for next year is to en
sure that the University acknowl
edges students as key "stakehold
ers." To promote the interests of
students, she will work with the
ASSU to light lor such changes as in
creasing transportation options and
giving students more say in Univer
sity decisions.
Consistent with these goals, the
pair's campaign slate called lor a
"re-opening and expanding of av
enues for students to exercise their
voice," according to Henestroza.
During the campaign, they advo
cated, among other things, a cost of
living campaign, an accountability
initiative and a safe and supportive
Stanford.
Their main campaign strategy
was "to define and research our is
sues," Henestroza said. Instead of
making T-shirts and stickers, as
many candidates traditionally do,
Henestroza and Rodriguez focused
on producing issue-ofiented flyers.

They also met with student
groups and talked to students at dif
ferent election forums to better un
derstand which issues are relevant.
Henestroza attributed the success of
their campaign to the support of
students who went out and cam
paigned for them.
"( )ne of the best parts of the cam
paign was seeing students come to
gether to support a common vision
for our university that emphasizes
strong advocacy lor students by stu
dents," Henestroza said.
A top priority for next year, Ro
driguez said, will be to ensure that
the ASSU is responsive and account
able to student interests. Henestroza
said that she envisions an ASSU "in
which all students feel ownership."
The University also needs to lis
ten to students, Rodriguez said.
"Rather than paying lip service,
the University needs to provide re
sources, services and support to our
student constituency, which is both
numerically and philosophically sig
nificant to our institution of higher
learning," Rodriguez said.
Henestroza and Rodriguez re
cently met with junior Matthew
Brewer and senior Christine
Cordero, this year's ASSU president
and vice president. They have also
