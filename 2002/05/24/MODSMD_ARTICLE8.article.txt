# Students weigh options for summer storage
## 
### ELIZABETH MADJLESSI STAFF WRITER 
With the end of the quarter drawing near,
many students are looking into storage op
tions lor the summer. Student Housing Ser
vices is offering students on-campus storage
space, as well as a special package with Shur
garcl Storage To Go.
Storage in the basements of Lagunita
Court, Wilbur Hall, Stern Hall and Toyon
Hall is available lor students with fall housing
assignments.
"Last year, we stored about 2,000 boxes
for students," said Enrique J evons, housing
enterprises supervisor for Student Housing
Services. "This year, with the addition of a
Web site, we anticipate storing about 2,500
boxes."
For the first time, students have the choice
of purchasing boxes only through Housing
Services. 1 iousing Services is offering this op
tion in response to student interest from pre
vious years.
"We have added the [online] purchase of
boxes only as an option this year," | evons
said. "Students may now sign-up on-line and
have the boxes delivered to them at no addi
tional cost."
The Student Housing Services Web site
states, "When you order online, labels will be
printed for you and attached to boxes, which
will be delivered to your campus room or
apartment the next business day."
Students can store their boxes themselves
at the designated storage areas or arrange for
student storage staff to pick-up and deliver
them for an additional fee of $50. Those
using this pick-up and delivery service will be
limited to six boxes and a bike.
Jevons encourages students to write their
names in very large letters or draw pictures
on all sides of the Im>x to help quickly identify
boxes when they come to retrieve them from
a room full of identical boxes.
Many students take advantage of on-cam
pus storage.
"I thought the summer storage [on cam
pus] was a lot more convenient than using
an off-campus company," said sophomore
Jade Hwa. "It also ended up being cheaper
for me."

However, Hwa added, "My only com
plaint is that I couldn't get any of my stuff
when 1 came back to campus early."
As an Orientation volunteer, Hwa moved
in early in September. She had not scheduled
the necessary appointment to arrange for
early retrieval of her items.
Other students were unenthusiastic about
their storage experiences.
"I don't really think it's as convenient as
Shurgard," said sophomore Louis Chang. "It
takes a lot of time to set it up and actually stor
ing stun isn't any easier either."
Student 1 lousing Services has negotiated
a special package price of $395 for Stanford
students from Shurgard Storage To Go.
The package includes a storage container
(5 feet by 8 feet by 8 feet), lock, $25 worth of
the packing materials, four months storage,
pick-up and delivery at selected drop sites.
Junior Marisa Anz had difficulty using
Shurgard. "There was confusion in the drop
off time and they were not at all accommo
dating when I tried to straighten out their
mistake on the phone," An/ said. Nonethe
less, she plans to use them again this year.
Some students find storage options off
campus.
Junior Steph Cheung from Los Gatos re
calls that students in her freshman dorm
gave her several bikes, refrigerators and
computers to store in her garage over the
summer.
