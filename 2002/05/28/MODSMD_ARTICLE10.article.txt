# Breast milk, antibiotics and moons, oh my!

Breast-feeding may increase intelli
gence. The Journal of the American

Medical Association published an

article two weeks ago on a

study showing evidence

/ o ~
that test scores increased if
the individual had been
breast-fed. June Reinish,
one of the authors, be
lieves breast milk may

have a key component that

either protects the central ner-

vous system or stimulates its devel-

opments. The best candidate for this

component is DMA, a polyunsaturated
acid found in human, but not in cow, milk.
The authors believe a subtler reason may
also be at play: mothers who devote more
time to breast-feeding their babies proba
bly invest more time and energy in up
bringing, which may be reflected in the in
fant's intellectual aptitude.

A growing body of literature indicates
that Alzheimer's disease is caused by a
protein which leads to plaque accumula
tion. One component in the hypothe
sized mechanism is the protein amyloid
P. Immunologist Mark Pepys and col
leagues have published a study in Nature
showing how a drug called CPHPC can
reduce the amount of amyloid Pin the
blood, thus reducing its deposits in the
brain. The drug works by binding to the
protein, which then cannot bind to fur
ther amyloid molecules. Pepys and his

team performed their tests in mice and
found that those treated with CPHPC
had significantly less plaque accumula-

tion. They are hoping to begin human
clinical trials by the end of this year.
Astronomers announced early this
month that they have discovered 11
new moons orbiting Jupiter. All 11 bod
ies are small and irregular with diame
ters of about two to four kilometers.
Their orbits are highly elliptical and
about 21 million kilometers from the
planet. They are also retrograde, mean
ing that the moons revolve in the oppo
site direction of the planet's rotation. In
terms of number of moons, this discov
ery puts Jupiter at first place with 39,
ahead of Saturn with 31. The discovery
was made from images taken in Decem
ber 2001 at Mouna Kea, Hawaii. The
researchers believe Jupiter may have as
many as 100 satellites of at least one
kilometer in diameter.

Scientists at Scripps Research Institute
have announced the synthesis of ramo
plnanin, an agent two to 10 times more po
tent than vancomycin, the current last-re
sort antibiotic. The study was published in

the Journal of the American Chemical

Society last month. The drug disrupts

bacterial cell wall construction by in-

hibiting key protein biosynthesis.
Its core structure contains a 49-
member ring and 17 amino acids.
Ramoplanin is the latest develop-

ment in a race that has been going

on since the development of antibi-

otics. First penicillin was invented, and

dien some bacteria developed resistance.

Since then, humans have been developing
more potent antibiotics, which bacteria
then become resistant to.
The Computer Emergency Response
Team is a branch of the Department of
Defense that deals with cyberterrorists.
David Fisher, director of the center at
Carnegie Mellon, has developed a pro
gramming language called Easel to
specifically track hackers. Easel uses
emergent algorithms, which enumerate
only certain properties to detect unusual
entry patterns. Its logic is designed to op
erate in a world of incomplete informa
tion, and works in situations of imprecise
answers. Fisher and colleagues have suc
cessfully tested Easel against worms —
viruses that quickly propagate on a net
work. They are currently working on
better algorithms that improve the sur
vivability of critical infrastructure in the
case of a malicious attack.
