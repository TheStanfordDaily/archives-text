# UC-Berkeley resistance poetry class under fire
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
After a UC-Berkeley rally calling for
the university to dispose of its stock
holdings in corporations that do busi
ness with Israel led to the arrest of 41
students last month, the school across
the Bay is now facing new tensions re
lated to the Middle East.
UC-Berkeley administrators are ex
amining an English class on Palestinian
resistance poetry scheduled for fall 2002
that they believe violates their Faculty
Code of Conduct by discouraging "con
servative thinkers" from enrolling in it.
The course listing for"The Politics
and Poetics of Palestinian Resistance"
states that the class "takes as its starting
point the right of Palestinians to fight for
their own self-determination.
" The brutal Israeli military occupa
tion of Palestine, an occupation that has
been ongoing since 1948, has systemati
cally displaced, killed and maimed mil
lions of Palestinian people," it says."And
yet from under the brutal weight of the
occupation, Palestinians have produced
their own culture and poetry of resis
tance."
The final line of the course descrip
tion states that "conservative thinkers
are encouraged to seek other sections."
According to doctoral candidate Sne
hal Shingavi, the course instructor, "con
servative" was not a political term but
rather referred to people who are "limit
ed or narrow in scope."

"Students are encouraged to take my
class irrespective of their political convic
tions," he said in an interview with The
Daily Californian.
However, Shingavi did emphasize
that the course was not meant to be a dis
cussion oflsraeli and Palestinian politics
and would only focus on "pro-Palestin
ian" arguments.
"If you can't accept that Palestinians
have the right to self-determination, it is
impossible to read resistance poetry,"
Shingavi said. "Instructors should have
the right to teach the material that they
want and should have control over the
discussion."
Maintaining that the course descrip
tion violates the university's Code of Con
duct, UC-Berkeley officials and English
Department administrators are working
to make it comply and ensure that the
course is accessible to all students.
"It is not appropriate for an academic
class to discourage or exclude anyone
from attending on political grounds,"
UC-Berkeley Chancellor Robert
Berdalil told The Daily Californian.
"That is very objectionable. The dis
course cannot be constrained by the po
litical perspective of an instructor."
The Daily Californian also reported
that UC-Berkeley English Department
Chair Janet Adelman would be sitting
in on the class to make sure t hat it abid
ed by the Code of Conduct's clause pre
cluding "discrimination, including ha
rassment against a student on political
grounds."
