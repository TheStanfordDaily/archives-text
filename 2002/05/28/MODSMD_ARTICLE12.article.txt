# Barge causes bridge collapse

WEBBERS FALLS, Okla. (AP) â€”
Divers pulled a fourth body from the un
derwater tangle of steel and concrete
where a barge collapsed a section of a
bridge, but they halted the search yester
day when authorities said the threat of
lightning made it too dangerous to con
tinue.
Authorities said several vehicles re
mained underwater from Sunday's col
lapse of the Interstate 40 bridge over the
murky, swiftly (lowing Arkansas River.
They said as many as twelve people may
have plummeted into the river and died
when the barge smashed into two massive
bridge pilings.
The dive was suspended early yester
day as a thunderstorm moved into the
area. Rescuers were using sonar to map
the debris field and were bringing in
cranes to lift chunks of the bridge and ve
hicles from the water.
Divers were not planning to return to
the river until this morning, said Highway
Patrol Lt. Chris West.
The bodies of three women and one
man were recovered by yesterday. At least
five people escaped with injuries when a
500-foot section of the nearly 2,000-foot
bridge was sheared off.
llie accident occurred when Joe Ded
al on, the 01-year-old pilot of a towboat
pushing two barges side-by-side, apparent
ly blacked out at the helm, said Joel Hen
derson, a spokesman for Magnolia Marine
Transport Co., which owns the boat.

Dedmon appears to have passed out
for about two minutes and was unable to
steer the barges through the river chan
nel under the bridge, Henderson said.
Nobody was on hand to take the Helm
from him.
Preliminary tests on the captain
showed he had not been using alcohol or
drugs. Dedmon regained consciousness
after the collision but remained hospital
ized yesterday pending further tests.
Divers weren't able to see anything in
the deepest parts of the churning river,
and resorted to feeling their way around
twisted steel in search of vehicles. Terry
Stephens, coordinator of the Highway Pa
trol's dive team, said mangled cars were
piled on top of each other.
Rescuers were using sonar to map the
debris field and were bringing in cranes to
lift debris from the water.
The barge was moving upstream and
about 300 feet outside the regular naviga
tion channel when the accident hap
pened, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
spokesman said.
Huge rock-filled bumpers protect
bridge supports near the navigation
channel from boats or debris moving
downstream, but the columns are not
protected from vessels moving upstream,
said Dennis Johnson, the corps' area
manager.
I le said it is unusual fora barge to hit a
bridge while moving upstream outside
the channel.
