## The 						Stanford Daily University should strengthen Middle Eastern studies 
### 
Published Since J 891

The Middle East conflict has
sparked controversy again at UC-
Berkeley. The recent issue has
been whether or not a UC-Berke
ley doctoral candidate, Snehal Shingavi,
will be allowed to teach an English class
next year entitled, "The Politics and Poetics
of Palestinian Resistance," because Shingavi
discouraged "conservative thinkers" from
enrolling in the class.
While Shingavi's attempt at restricting
students from his course seems objection
able, at least UC-Berkeley, unlike Stanford,
offers a wide variety of classes on the Middle
East. The Middle East is an extremely im
portant and strategic area of the world right
now, and we believe that Stanford should
make it a priority to quickly expand its

course offerings focusing on that region of
the world.
After the Sept. 11 attacks, Americans have
wanted to learn more and more about the
Middle East. Sept. 11 forced many of us to
start asking questions like "Why are many
people in the Middle East angry at the Unit
ed States?" and "Why is the United States al
lies with undemocratic Arab regimes?" It is
up to universities like Stanford to attempt to
answer these complex questions.
The aftermath of Sept. 11 has definitely
shifted the interests of many Stanford stu
dents as classes on international relations, ter
rorism and the Middle East have been over
flowing with students this year. The Interna
tional Politics class (Political Science 35) had
its largest student turnout ever, and, for the

first time, the Beginning Arabic class needed
two separate sections to accommodate all in
terested students. It is the University's re
sponsibility to adjust its priorities to meet
these changes in students' academic interests.
„ Unfortunately, Stanford is currently be
hind most elite American universities regard
ing Middle Eastern studies. UC-Berkeley,
Harvard and Princeton all have strong Mid
dle Eastern studies programs. As a compari
son, Stanford does not even have one politi
cal science professor who specializes in the
Middle East. Stanford's Middle East repre
sentation has been primarily History prof.
Joel Beinin. History prof. Ahmed Dallal, who
focuses on Islamic movements, was recently
hired to address the huge void in Middle
Eastern studies at Stanford.

While the Arabic language program had
its biggest student turnout ever this year,
the program is still not permanent and
could end when and if the current director,
Khalil Barhoum, decides to leave Stanford.
In addition, Stanford still lacks a perma
nent Islamic studies position in the Reli
gious Studies department. Considering
Islam is the second largest religion in the
world, at least one Islamic studies professor
is a necessity.
University administrators and academic
departments should understand that for
Stanford to remain an academically com
petitive school, it must address its weak
nesses. Stanford's Middle Eastern studies
— or lack of it — is definitely near the top of
that list.
