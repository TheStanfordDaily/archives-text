# SHOOTING FROM THE HIP
## America's elitist bastards 
### 
At a certain Ivy League Universi
ty in upstate New York, they ac
tually have a full-blown lecture
course on wine tasting. Each
session provides an opportunity for
about 200 students to sip Merlots,
Chardonnays and Zinfandels while the
professor explains the characteristics of
each wine. I, for one, have a serious
moral problem with such a course. The
university is simply perpetuating and
encouraging a growing problem in
American society: wine snobbery.
I'm not sure what it is about ferment
ed grape juice that turns otherwise nor
mal people into haughty connoisseurs.
When you get right down to it, wine's not
even a particularly complex alcoholic
beverage. Beer at least has fermented

grains plus hops. Cer
tain cordials, such as
Mike's Hard Lemonade,
contain enough mutant
additives to warrant an
independent FDA inve§-
tigation.
Wine, on the other
hand, is incredibly sim
ple. And yet there are

thousands of people out there who can
wax eloquent,.for hours on end, about
the unique character of hundreds of dif
ferent wines. And they certainly don't
hesitate to share their knowledge.
Not that you could ever hope to un
derstand what they're saying. The first
rule of wine snobbery is: Always use the
most absurd, nonsensical descriptions
for any given wine. I've heard one
Cabernet Sauvignon described as
"chewy" and another as "chunky," both
interesting adjectives fora liquid.
Other wines are lauded as having "ex
cellent focus." This is high praise, since
you just know how many wines' minds
have a tendency to wander. In addition,
some wine descriptions seem to have
been lifted from trashy romance novels.
A New York Times wine review de
scribes the 1997 Alto Adige Pinot Nero as
"masculine, supple and sexy." I can see
this wine entering into a torrid love affair
with the Romanee-Saint-Vivant Grand
Cru, which the Times calls "feminine
and voluptuous."
Thankfully, there aren't a whole lot of
wine snobs among the Stanford student
population. Part of this is due to simple
economics — most college students
don't have the disposable cash to spend
on expensive, high-quality wines. For
example, my own dorm room's wine cel
lar consists of a single half-full container
of Franzia boxed wine, comfortably chill
ing in my mini-fridge. For those of you
who haven't sampled this vintage, let me
just say that the only adjective appropri
ate to Franzia is "God-awful." This is a
wine that could pull double duty as a
paint remover. We usually cut it with
Minute Maid orange soda, thus making

a delightful concoction that is both bub
bly and barely tolerable.
I should add that my friends and I are
equally highbrow when it comes to din
ing out. A few weeks ago we went out to
a nice restaurant to celebrate a female
friend's birthday. As the waiter came
around taking our drink orders, my
roommate beckoned him over and said,
in his most suave and sophisticated tone,
"bring us a bottle of your cheapest wine."
The waiter was mortified. I practically
swooned with pride. Here was a man
who knew how to have a good time with
out breaking the bank.
Also, many Stanford events, even if
they feature nice wine, don't cultivate an
atmosphere conducive to wine snobbery.
Special Dinners at Row Houses and Eat
ing Clubs are a great example. The wine
at these events is pretty good, but the
drinking atmosphere is similar to what
you'd find hanging out with 60 year-old
winos on skid row. The basic goal is to get
extremely drunk in an extremely short
period of time, and then get up from the
table and start doing the sort of things re
ally drunk people do. If someone tried to
drone on about wine at your average
Special Dinner, he or she would quickly
found themselves dangling upside-down
from a third-floor window.
Most Stanford parties and progres
sives don't even have wine at all. This re
duces the snobbery level to right about
zero, because you can't pull the kind of
descriptive stunts with other alcoholic
drinks as you can with wine. Take beer,
for example. Beer is a blue-collar, no
frills kind of drink. It's the Chevy Truck
of the alcohol "world — nothing fancy,
but always dependable.
Sure, there are some microbrews out
there, featuring blends of exotic hops
and barley. But even these species are
just Chevy Trucks with shiny chrome
rims. No one gushes on about micro
brews the way wine snobs do about their
favorite wines.
Hard liquor is even more inappropri
ate as a focus of snobbery. Let's be honest
— no one really likes the taste of hard
liquor. Generations of collegfe students
have spent countless hours experiment
ing with different mixers just to make
hard alcohol cocktails taste "okay." You
couldn't find a genuinely appealing flavor
in vodka or gin if your life depended on it.
No, the wine snobs are certainly a
unique breed, with no real rival among all
the millions of drinkers in this country. At
best, we should resignedly tolerate their
flowery talk and tedious descriptions.
Maybe we can we even find a little humor
in it all. But the minute I ever start talking
about the "bouquet," the "nose" or the
"body" of a wine, please shoot me
