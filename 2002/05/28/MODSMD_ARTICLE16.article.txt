Depression at Stanford 'important
to bring to light 7
We were glad to see a front-page arti
cle on depression last week, ft is impor
tant to bring to light an issue that so
many people at Stanford deal with and
yet never talk about.
We were surprised that the article ref
erenced Elizabeth Shin's suicide at MI 1
but did not mention the recent suicide of
one of Stanford's own, Minna Sandmeyer,
who took her life last summer.
Her 3-week disappearance and the dis
covery of her death left many of our com
munity struggling with grief, confusion, and
questions about our own mental health.
Sandmeyer was loved by many,
seemed filled with joy, and was about to
become an Resident Assistant. The fact
that her friends never knew about her
severe depression shows how skillful
Stanford students can be at hiding their
problems, and how much stigma still ex
ists around depression.
If Sandmeyer can be compared to a
canary in a coal mine, then how many
other students are struggling with simi
lar problems and not talking about it?
Secrecy can be so painful and dangerous,
yet pride and independence prevent us
from reaching out to friends.
We would like to see a community in
which people feel comfortable reaching out
for help, in which friends notice depression
and offer support, and in which medica
tions can be discussed without stigma.
We believe the University needs to
make a greater effort to open the con
versation around mental health. While
depression may begin with a genetic pre

disposition, it is exacerbated by high
pressure environments like Stanford. It
we are to be held to abnormally high ex
pectations, we need more support and
better resources.
We would like to see more panels on
depression in dorms and community cen
ters. We would also like to see Counseling
and Psychological Services expanded or
reformed; it is not appropriate to have two
week delays in seeing a counselor.
We laud (he Bridge for its Wellness
and Depression group and would like to
encourage more people attend. A second
group for graduate students will be start
ing in mid-June.
Most of all, we would like to encourage
people to speak up about their own strug
gles and to see their friends as resources.
Sandmeyer could not see the network
of love and support that her friends
could offer; if she had shared her strug
gles with us, we would have done any
thing to help her.

Master's students, Earth Systems
Senior proposes changes
;\s a graduating senior, I have had four
years to lavish in what is wonderfully right
about Stanford. But not even paradise is
perfect. So if I had another year here,
these are the changes 1 would strive for:
• A place to meet. The burned-out Ca
reer Development Center building would
be an ideal'location fora 24-hour student
meeting center. Ideally filled with 20 or
more small, five-to-10 person rooms, like

those in the Bing Wing, it could offer a
place to hold office hours, executive meet
ings of student groups, study groups, and
maybe even music practice.
• A three-tiered Draw system. A system
that divides Draw numbers into premium
(0-1000), preferred (1001-2000) and un
preferred (2001 +) would eliminate much
of the unfairness of the current system.
Why do some students live in houses all
three years while others never leave dorm
life? As more premium housing becomes
cordoned off for fraternities, the opportu
nities for students to squeeze onto the
Row will become even rarer. A three
tiered system may also help resolve the
residence staff debate — about whether
to count their staff year as preferred or
unpreferred — by offering a compro
mise. While the third tier may complicate
draw and force students to live apart who
would otherwise draw together, many
other colleges give their students even less
freedom to choose. Some strictly ecmate
one's year in school with their priority,
and others force students to draw only
with people in their residential college.
• Club sports for mainstream sports.
* Hey, high-school varsity captains of
America: why haven't you kicked a soc
cer ball, spiked a volleyball, or batted a
baseball in three years? And no, intra
murals, open gym, and athletics classes
don't count. Do you not miss having
practice that matters, a team that's a fam
ily, and a coach who pushes you to your
fullest potential? Clet together a dedicat
ed group of competitive (but not quite
Division I) athletes who share your pas
sion, and go talk with Asst. Athletic Di
rector Sherry Posthumus about forming
a club team. Just do it.
• "State" representatives. The Senate is
detached from students, lacks clear objec
tives, and gives its senators little incentive
to be productive after they get elected. I
am embarrassed to go to a University
where we vote for students because they
have cute slogans. A far better and — get
this — more "accountable" system would
have representatives elected from dorms.
Then everyone would know who and
where their representatives were, and
could discuss issues with them over din
ner. If the United States can elect senators
by geographic reasons, why can't we?
• Preclaring a major. Students do de
clare too late. I wish I had been able to
sink into my major — international rela

tions — by the beginning of junior year,
to get to know professors better, to do
more research, and to develop a tighter
network with others in my major. But I
am so grateful that Stanford does not
force us to decide prematurely — by
sophomore year — like some other
schools. So how can Stanford encourage
students to declare earlier without mak
ing it mandatory? What if by the begin
ning of sophomore year, students had to
"preclare" no more than five or so ma
jors? They would then get on the de
partment mailing list and be keyed into
Time Schedule changes, faculty lunches,
guest lectures, summer internships, and
other students with their interests.
Then departments, already motivated
by financial reasons to encourage more
majors would know which students were
interested in them and could design
events to help lost sophomores decide.
You are Stanford. Take the greatest
school on earth and make it better.

Mexico 'our closest problem'
Public attention is focused on places

like Afghanistan, where our troops are
involved, but our closest problem is Mex
ico which, despite the apparently cordial
relations between Presidents George W.
Bush and Vincente Fox, has serious dis
agreements with the United States. Most
publicized is the problem of Mexican mi
gration into the United States, but more
intractable is the fight over water, notably
of the Rio Grande.
The protest "Tractorcade" at Pharr
on the Rio Grande was sufficiently im
portant to rate a feature article in The
New York Times, ft said that "the water
crisis grows in a test of U.S.-Mexico rela
tions." The 1944 treaty, which was sup
posed to regulate the division of Rio
Grande water, is falling apart. It was sup
posed to be one third to the United
States, two thirds to Mexico. Texans said
that in thirty days they would be out of
water if Mexico does not comply. It owes
the United States billions of gallons. Fox
is asking the United States to lend it $430
million, which infuriates the Texans,
who see it as blackmail.
Texas governor Rick Perry urged
Bush not to lend Mexico a dime. The
desperate Mexican farmers of the lower
Rio Grande accuse Chihuahua state, fur
ther upstream, of taking the water. They

are reduced to praying to San Isidro
Labrador, the Flower, a Spanish saint,
the patron of his native Madrid. Unfor
tunately it is just a little late, since his
feast day is May 15.
Much documentation about U.S.-
Mexican problems is appearing; 1 re
ceive a lot of it. I assume that the Uni
versity of Texas and the UC-San Diego
are collecting it. Other universities
should too, including Stanford, but
there we run into the problem of the re
lations between Hoover and Green Li
braries. According to the new dispensa
tion, Green will collect books, while
Hoover will concentrate on
manuscripts and pamphlets, or so I was
told when asked.
I asked Hoover Archivist Elena
Danielson how "pamphlet" is defined
and mentioned the Mexican documenta
tion I receive. She said that Hoover was
interested only in rare materials, not in
things which can easily be found. This, 1
assume, would mean say material on the
civil war in Georgia, in Georgian, and
therefore incomprehensible to the ordi
nary American. The Hoover Archives
are essentially a place for scholars en
gaged in advanced research.
Following Danielson's advice, as I in

variably do, I sent some documents on
Mexican-U.S. relations to Green Library,
which I hope will accept them. How they
will be organized I do not know. The Stan
ford Daily encouraged students to use the
Hoover Archives. Of more immediate
concern to them will be the Mexicans in
Green Library, since U.S.-Mexican rela
tions will be a major issue between our two
countries for an indefinite time.
