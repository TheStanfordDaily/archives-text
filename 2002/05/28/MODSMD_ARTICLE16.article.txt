Depression at Stanford 'important
to bring to light 7
We were glad to see a front-page arti
cle on depression last week, ft is impor
tant to bring to light an issue that so
many people at Stanford deal with and
yet never talk about.
We were surprised that the article ref
erenced Elizabeth Shin's suicide at MI 1
but did not mention the recent suicide of
one of Stanford's own, Minna Sandmeyer,
who took her life last summer.
Her 3-week disappearance and the dis
covery of her death left many of our com
munity struggling with grief, confusion, and
questions about our own mental health.
Sandmeyer was loved by many,
seemed filled with joy, and was about to
become an Resident Assistant. The fact
that her friends never knew about her
severe depression shows how skillful
Stanford students can be at hiding their
problems, and how much stigma still ex
ists around depression.
If Sandmeyer can be compared to a
canary in a coal mine, then how many
other students are struggling with simi
lar problems and not talking about it?
Secrecy can be so painful and dangerous,
yet pride and independence prevent us
from reaching out to friends.
We would like to see a community in
which people feel comfortable reaching out
for help, in which friends notice depression
and offer support, and in which medica
tions can be discussed without stigma.
We believe the University needs to
make a greater effort to open the con
versation around mental health. While
depression may begin with a genetic pre

disposition, it is exacerbated by high
pressure environments like Stanford. It
we are to be held to abnormally high ex
pectations, we need more support and
better resources.
We would like to see more panels on
depression in dorms and community cen
ters. We would also like to see Counseling
and Psychological Services expanded or
reformed; it is not appropriate to have two
week delays in seeing a counselor.
We laud (he Bridge for its Wellness
and Depression group and would like to
encourage more people attend. A second
group for graduate students will be start
ing in mid-June.
Most of all, we would like to encourage
people to speak up about their own strug
gles and to see their friends as resources.
Sandmeyer could not see the network
of love and support that her friends
could offer; if she had shared her strug
gles with us, we would have done any
thing to help her.

Master's students, Earth Systems
Senior proposes changes
;\s a graduating senior, I have had four
years to lavish in what is wonderfully right
about Stanford. But not even paradise is
perfect. So if I had another year here,
these are the changes 1 would strive for:
• A place to meet. The burned-out Ca
reer Development Center building would
be an ideal'location fora 24-hour student
meeting center. Ideally filled with 20 or
more small, five-to-10 person rooms, like

those in the Bing Wing, it could offer a
place to hold office hours, executive meet
ings of student groups, study groups, and
maybe even music practice.
• A three-tiered Draw system. A system
that divides Draw numbers into premium
(0-1000), preferred (1001-2000) and un
preferred (2001 +) would eliminate much
of the unfairness of the current system.
Why do some students live in houses all
three years while others never leave dorm
life? As more premium housing becomes
cordoned off for fraternities, the opportu
nities for students to squeeze onto the
Row will become even rarer. A three
tiered system may also help resolve the
residence staff debate — about whether
to count their staff year as preferred or
unpreferred — by offering a compro
mise. While the third tier may complicate
draw and force students to live apart who
would otherwise draw together, many
other colleges give their students even less
freedom to choose. Some strictly ecmate
one's year in school with their priority,
and others force students to draw only
with people in their residential college.
• Club sports for mainstream sports.
* Hey, high-school varsity captains of
America: why haven't you kicked a soc
cer ball, spiked a volleyball, or batted a
baseball in three years? And no, intra
murals, open gym, and athletics classes
don't count. Do you not miss having
practice that matters, a team that's a fam
ily, and a coach who pushes you to your
