## Baseball gets sweep, but not Pac-10 title 
### MAC LEVINE STAFF WRITER 
For the No. 9 Cardinal (40-16,
16-8 Pacific 10 Conference), the
agenda for the regular season's final
weekend was simple — win and
hope that No. 17 Southern Califor
nia wasn't as fortunate.
The Cardinal did its job, sweep
ing last-place Washington State (21-
33, 6-18) at Sunken Diamond, but
help from other squads was
nowhere to be found. USC (34-22,
17-7) also won all of its three games
over UCLA (26-35,9-15) to capture
the Pac-10 crown by a single game
and win the league's automatic
berth to the NCAA Tournament.
Stanford entered the weekend in
a second-place tie with Washington
(30-.25-1, 15-9), just one game be
hind USC. But while the Trojans
swept, the Huskies lost, 5-2, to Ari
zona (31-24, 9-15) on Sunday, and
the Cardinal finished the season in
sole possession of second place.
The end of this year's regular
season should sound familiar, as it
marked the second straight year in
which USC beat the Cardinal by just

one game to win the conference title
despite a Cardinal sweep in the last
weekend of Pac-10 play.
The second-place finish is the
21st time in the last 23 seasons that
the Cardinal has finished either first
or second in the Pac-10's final con
ference standings.
The Cardinal began the three
game sweep of the Cougars on Fri
day night with a 10-0 victory, as ju
nior ace Jeremy Guthrie improved
to 10-1 on the season with the win.
Guthrie, named one of the five
finalists for the Golden Spikes
Award for the best college pitcher
in the country last week, extended
his consecutive scoreless inning
streak to 19, while scattering seven

"If you're going to have a chance
of competing in the postseason or
for the Pac-10 tide, you're going to
need a real good front-line starter,
and we're fortunate that we've got
one of die best in the country," head
coach Mark Marquess said about

Guthrie. "Jeremy is just a great col
lege pitcher."
leaving the game after seven
frames, Guthrie broke his run of
four straight complete games, as the
hard-throwing righthander was
being kept to a strict pitch count with
the postseason just a week away.
The Cardinal offense provided
more than enough support for
Guthrie, picking up seven runs in
the first two innings to put the game
out of reach.

Chris Carter led off the Cardinal
first with a home run, his fifth of the
season, and the Cardinal never
looked back.
Junior catcher Ryan Garko had
the game's other long ball, hitting a

home run.

The game was knotted at 3-3 in
the middle of the seventh inning,
but the Cardinal put up six runs in its
half of the inning to ensure victory.
Senior infielder Arik VanZandt
homered in the win, as four Cardi

including Fuld, who went 2 for 4

with a double and two RBI.
On Sunday, Stanford complet

nior Tim Cunningham (8-2)
picked up his third straight win
with 7 2/3 strong innings, giving up
just three hits and two runs while

For the No. 9 Cardinal (40-16,
16-8 Pacific 10 Conference), the
agenda for the regular season's final
weekend was simple — win and
hope that No. 17 Southern Califor
nia wasn't as fortunate.
The Cardinal did its job, sweep
ing last-place Washington State (21-
33, 6-18) at Sunken Diamond, but
help from other squads was
nowhere to be found. USC (34-22,
17-7) also won all of its three games
over UCLA (26-35,9-15) to capture
the Pac-10 crown by a single game
and win the league's automatic
berth to the NCAA Tournament.
Stanford entered the weekend in
a second-place tie with Washington
(30-.25-1, 15-9), just one game be
hind USC. But while the Trojans
swept, the Huskies lost, 5-2, to Ari
zona (31-24, 9-15) on Sunday, and
the Cardinal finished the season in
sole possession of second place.
The end of this year's regular
season should sound familiar, as it
marked the second straight year in
which USC beat the Cardinal by just
