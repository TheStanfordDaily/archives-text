## Baseball gets sweep, but not Pac-10 title 
### MAC LEVINE STAFF WRITER

agenda for the regular season's final
weekend was simple â€” win and
hope that No. 17 Southern Califor

33, 6-18) at Sunken Diamond, but

the Cardinal finished the season in
sole possession of second place.
The end of this year's regular
season should sound familiar, as it
marked the second straight year in
which USC beat the Cardinal by just

The second-place finish is the

the Cardinal has finished either first
or second in the Pac-10's final con
ference standings.
