WOMEN'S TENNIS

Saturday: Seniors Gabriela Lastra and
Lauren Kalvaria won the NCAA Doubles
Championship

Seniors Lauren Kalvaria and Gabriela Lastra
wrapped up the 2002 NCAA Championships —
and their collegiate careers — by defeating
UCLA's Megan Bradley and Lauren Fisher, 6-2,
6-3, in the doubles final at Taube Tennis Center.
"This is incredible and just a dream come
true," Lastra said.
Stanford had not captured the doubles cham
pionship since 1990.
"I've been dreaming about this for four
years, so this is a long time coming," said
Kalvaria, who began playing doubles with
Lastra back in high school.
Kalvaria and Lastra. the top-seeded doubles
tandem, outlasted Washington's Claire Carter
and Darija Klaic, 6-3, 6-7(7), 6-2, on Thursday,
and dispatched Florida's third-seeded Lindsay
Dawaf and Jessica Lehnhoff, 6-2,6-4, on Friday to
advance to the tide match. There the Cardinal
duo's experience, accuracy, and aggressive net
play proved too much for the Bruins' young tan
dem of freshman Bradley and sophomore Fisher.
"Once we were able to win the second game of
the first set, everything was going well," Kalvaria
said. "They are a young team and we have expe
rience and know how to play in those situations."
Bradley and Fisher, who weren't even seeded
in the doubles draw, knocked off two seeded
tandems before falling to the Cardinal.
"They're a great team and they played well,"
Fisher said of Kalvaria and Lastra. "We didn't
play as well as we wanted to, and you have to be
on your game to beat them."
Stanford's No. 2 doubles team of Burdette
and sophomoi Barnikow fell on Thurs
day in the quarterfinals to Kentucky's fourth

seeded Carolina Mayorga and Sarah Witten, 6-
3, 6-7(5), 6-4.
The Cardinal also fared well in the weekend's
singles tournament, where freshman Erin Bur
dette and Lastra made it to the semifinals belore
bowing out.
Lastra defeated Tennessee's Vilmarie Castel
lvi, 6-2, 7-5, on Thursday before falling to Flori
da's third-seeded Lehnhoff, 6-4,6-2, on Friday.
"The plan was to keep it going with forehand
to-forehand rallies, then go back to her back
hand," Lehnhoff said, explaining how she with
stood Lastra's tremendous volleying skills.
"1 knew that [Lehnhoff] is a grind-it-out type
of player," Lastra said. "1 think that if I had been
able to get my backhand in a little more I could
have moved her around."
Burdette edged past Arizona State's Adria

Engel, ti-4, 5-7, 6-3, on Thursday, but fell to
Wake Forest's top-seeded Bea Bielik, 6-1, 6-0,
on Saturday.
"She hits a really good ball and I just never got
used to it," Burdette said.
Burdette was not alone, as the overpowering,
six-ftx)t Bielik set an NCAA record en route to the
singles title, losing only 21 games in her six singles
victories to break former Stanford star Laura
Granville's 22-game mark, set in 2000.
On Saturday, Bielik breezed past Lehnhoff, 6-
2,6-0, in only 51 minutes for the singles crown.
"1 played a really g(x>d tournament," Bielik
said. "Bringing the trophy back to Wake Forest is
definitely very satisfying."

Senior Lauren Kalvaria hits a forehand while senior Gabriela Lastra looks on at the Taube Family Ten
nis Stadium on Saturday. The Stanford tandem defeated UCLA's Meghan Bradley and Lauren Fisher,
6-2, 6-3, to win the NCAA doubles title.
Stanford last week, Lehnhoff, a se
nior, was happy to have made it to
the doubles final four and the sin
gles final.
"I fought hard today but it just
wasn't enough," Lehnhoff said. "It's
sad for die season to end like this,
but at the same time [Bielik] played
a great match, and I did everydiing
I could."
Burdette, Kalvaria and Lastra
garnered Ail-American honors
for making it to the round of 16
last Wednesday.
Although a Cardinal player was
unable to capture the singles
championship, the players
weren't disappointed, despite
their notoriously high standards
for themselves.

"I'll take the doubles title,"
Kalvaria said. "A triple crown in this
sport is almost unrealistic. I'm very
happy with the way we were able to
play this weekend and throughout
the tournament."
Kalvaria, Lastra, and senior
Keiko Tokuda were all able to end
their careers on a high note. Ihey
will leave Stanford having won
three national championships while
only losing four team matches over
their four-year tenure.
"I'm so ecstatic for Gabby and
Lauren," head coach Lele
Forood said. "They got to finish
their college careers as doubles
champions. They deserve it so
much and have played great dou
bles all four years.
"They have a lot of faith in one
another and are such good friends
off the court that they want to win
for each other, and that's the most

stood Lastra's tremendous volleying skills.
"1 knew that [Lehnhoff] is a grind-it-out type
of player," Lastra said. "1 think that if I had been
able to get my backhand in a little more I could
have moved her around."
Burdette edged past Arizona State's Adria

Engel, ti-4, 5-7, 6-3, on Thursday, but fell to
Wake Forest's top-seeded Bea Bielik, 6-1, 6-0,
on Saturday.
"She hits a really good ball and I just never got
used to it," Burdette said.
Burdette was not alone, as the overpowering,
six-ftx)t Bielik set an NCAA record en route to the
singles title, losing only 21 games in her six singles
victories to break former Stanford star Laura
Granville's 22-game mark, set in 2000.
On Saturday, Bielik breezed past Lehnhoff, 6-
2,6-0, in only 51 minutes for the singles crown.
"1 played a really g(x>d tournament," Bielik
said. "Bringing the trophy back to Wake Forest is
definitely very satisfying."

the doubles final four and the sin

"I fought hard today but it just
wasn't enough," Lehnhoff said. "It's
sad for die season to end like this,
but at the same time [Bielik] played
a great match, and I did everydiing
I could."
Burdette, Kalvaria and Lastra

weren't disappointed, despite
their notoriously high standards
for themselves.

"I'll take the doubles title,"
Kalvaria said. "A triple crown in this
sport is almost unrealistic. I'm very
happy with the way we were able to
play this weekend and throughout
the tournament."

their college careers as doubles
champions. They deserve it so
much and have played great dou

another and are such good friends
off the court that they want to win
for each other, and that's the most
important thing."

WOMEN'S TENNIS

Saturday: Seniors Gabriela Lastra and
Lauren Kalvaria won the NCAA Doubles
Championship

Seniors Lauren Kalvaria and Gabriela Lastra
wrapped up the 2002 NCAA Championships —
and their collegiate careers — by defeating
UCLA's Megan Bradley and Lauren Fisher, 6-2,
6-3, in the doubles final at Taube Tennis Center.
"This is incredible and just a dream come
true," Lastra said.
Stanford had not captured the doubles cham
pionship since 1990.
"I've been dreaming about this for four
years, so this is a long time coming," said
Kalvaria, who began playing doubles with
Lastra back in high school.
Kalvaria and Lastra. the top-seeded doubles
tandem, outlasted Washington's Claire Carter
and Darija Klaic, 6-3, 6-7(7), 6-2, on Thursday,
and dispatched Florida's third-seeded Lindsay
Dawaf and Jessica Lehnhoff, 6-2,6-4, on Friday to
advance to the tide match. There the Cardinal
duo's experience, accuracy, and aggressive net
play proved too much for the Bruins' young tan
dem of freshman Bradley and sophomore Fisher.
"Once we were able to win the second game of
the first set, everything was going well," Kalvaria
said. "They are a young team and we have expe
rience and know how to play in those situations."
Bradley and Fisher, who weren't even seeded
in the doubles draw, knocked off two seeded
tandems before falling to the Cardinal.
"They're a great team and they played well,"
Fisher said of Kalvaria and Lastra. "We didn't
play as well as we wanted to, and you have to be
on your game to beat them."
Stanford's No. 2 doubles team of Burdette
and sophomoi Barnikow fell on Thurs
day in the quarterfinals to Kentucky's fourth

seeded Carolina Mayorga and Sarah Witten, 6-
3, 6-7(5), 6-4.
The Cardinal also fared well in the weekend's
singles tournament, where freshman Erin Bur
dette and Lastra made it to the semifinals belore
bowing out.
Lastra defeated Tennessee's Vilmarie Castel
lvi, 6-2, 7-5, on Thursday before falling to Flori
da's third-seeded Lehnhoff, 6-4,6-2, on Friday.
"The plan was to keep it going with forehand
to-forehand rallies, then go back to her back
hand," Lehnhoff said, explaining how she with
stood Lastra's tremendous volleying skills.
"1 knew that [Lehnhoff] is a grind-it-out type
of player," Lastra said. "1 think that if I had been
able to get my backhand in a little more I could
have moved her around."
