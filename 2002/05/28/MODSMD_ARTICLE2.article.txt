# Seniors take sustainability pledge
## 
### MICHELLE KELLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the class 0f2002 prepares for Com
mencement, seniors will soon be getting
their customary graduation garb, caps
and gowns â€” and some will sport a green
ribbon, taking part in a growing Stanford
tradition. For the second year in a row,
graduates can wear this ribbon after sign
ing the Pledge of Sustainability.
Started in 1987 at Humboldt Suite
University, the pledge is a commitment
that, according to many students, seniors
sign to "to explore and take into account
the social and environmental conse
quences of any job [they] consider and try
to improve these aspects of any organiza
tions for which [they] work."
"It's a great way for people entering
the working world to think about the ef
fects that their choices have," said Au
drey Chang, a first-year graduate stu
dent in Earth Systems who signed the
pledge last year as a senior and has
signed it again this year as she works to
wards her master's degree. She is cur
rently the co-coordinator of a social and

environmental awareness group called
Students fora Sustainable Stanford.
Stanford students joined the tradition
of schools like Cornell, Princeton and
Harvard in signing the pledge in 2001
and organizers hope to continue this tra
dition for years to come. The Sustainabil
ity Pledge was started at Stanford
through a partnership of the Future So
cial Innovators Network and Students
fora Sustainable Stanford.
"I think social and environmental re
sponsibility are goals which most people
probably aspire t0... but which they are
not consciously reminded of, in part be
cause as a society, and especially in the
corporate world, the reward systems
don't recognize those goals," explained
senior Jason Glickman, who is one of the
pledge's organizers this year.
"Our vision was that Stanford stu
dents are bound to become leaders in
their fields, and to the extent that we can
educate them that the profit motive and
environmental responsibility are not
mutually exclusive, and are even com
plementary, we could have a huge im
pact," Glickman added.

Several students who have signed the
pledge were already considering careers
with a socially conscious or environmen
tal spin, but signing the pledge is a rein
forcement of their commitments.
"I was already personally committed
to the principles of the pledge before I
had even heard about it. Just signing it
sends also a clear message to others that
these are issues that a substantial portion
of the graduating class cares about,"
Chang added.
Approximately 21 percent of the class
of 2001 sported green ribbons at last
year's Commencement and student lead
ers are hoping to increase this percent
age. As of May 17, 250 seniors had al
ready signed the pledge.
Seniors who sign are also given a
small pledge certificate as a symbol of
their promise.
Students are asked to seek socially re
sponsible careers and lifestyles where
they can make the difference in their
workplace and in their everyday lives.
Some students have chosen jobs that ad

dress s(x ial issues such as poverty or envi
ronmental justice, while others are consid
ering careers in the environmental field.
Lynette Cheah, a first year graduate student
in management science and engineering
and tne main coordinator of the pledge this
year plans to return to Singapore and work
in environmental management after gradu

ating from Stanford.
"I plan to make small changes within my
capacity to ensure that what I do takes into
account factors that affect society. I someday
hope to help companies enhance their envi
ronmental performance, while maintaining
t heir bottom line," Cheah said.
Cheah and other organizers of the event
urge all seniors to sign the pledge and
change conditions in their workplace to ful
fill their promise.
"Ideally, no matter what job one under
takes, you can still fulfill the pledge by con

sidering what changes you can make at the
workplace that would make a difference.
One could work fora 'socially irresponsible'
company and still make a difference by say,
encouraging recycling in the office, or
choosing a supplier that adheres to some so
cial and environmental principles. Small
things add up, and one can make changes
from the inside," added Cheah.
The pledge is open to both undergradu
ate and graduate students who will graduate
in 2002. To sign the pledge, go to sustain
