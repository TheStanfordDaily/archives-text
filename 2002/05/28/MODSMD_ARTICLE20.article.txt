# Stanford miffed by NCAA baseball bracket
## 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Several weeks ago, the NCAA tournament se
lection committee made it known that keeping
teams close to home would be its top priority in
building the 16 four-team regional match-ups.
Yesterday, it let everyone know it wasn't joking.
The No. 9 Cardinal received good news then
bad news as the field was announced on na
tional television yesterday morning. First, Stan
ford (40-16) was awarded the No. 8 national
seed, ensuring the all-important home-field ad
vantage until the College World Series.
The bad news, though, came as a shock to al
most everyone around college baseball, save the
committee itself. Headed to Palo Alto for this
weekend's Regional are three other top-25
teams, all from the West Coast — No. 22 Long
Beach State (37-19), No. 18 San Jose State (45-
15) and No. 25 Cal State-Fullerton (36-20), un
doubtedly the best No. 4 seed in the tourna
ment's history. The Palo Alto regional will be
the tournament's most loaded in years.
For head coach Mark Marquess and his play
ers the disappointment, frustration and confu
sion at the stacked draw were all clearly visible.
"It's unfortunate that they had to do it that

way," Marquess said. "I think when you re
gionalize it so much, it compromises the na
tional championship."
He also voiced his concern that perhaps the
tournament was not being given the respect it
deserves compared to other NCAA sports.
"We're a big-time championship. We pay for
ourselves and make money, so this is not a
Mickey Mouse national championship where
we're costing the NCAA money. We're making
money — quite a bit of money," Marquess said.
Senior second baseman Chris O'Riordan,
who has seen plenty of difficult regionals in
his time at Stanford, agreed with his coach's
assessment.
"You have to shake your head and wonder
how they put all four of these teams in the same
regional," O'Riordan said. "But at the same
time there's work to be done. It's a really tough
draw that we got, so bring it early I guess."
Sophomore centerfielder Sam Fuld,
though, summed up the feeling on the team
that despite the committee's questionable deci
sions, the Cardinal must move on.
"It doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but
there's nothing you can do about it. It's disap
pointing, but we're gonna have to play good
teams no matter what and we're playing well

enough right now to beat anybody, so we might
as well take on the best."
Marquess surely will not be alone in his
criticism of the 64-team field. A prime exam
ple of the seeming lack of balance in the tour
nament is the regional in Los Angeles, where
No. 17 Southern California did not receive a
national seed but will host just one other top
-25 team.
Unranked Maine and unranked Brigham
Young were sent to play at Dedeaux Field along
with No. 15 Cal State-Northridge, while both
Cal State-Fullerton and Long Beach State head
north to Sunken Diamond — a situation that
could have been avoided with some swaps be
tween the two brackets.
In addition, Cal State-Fullerton and Long
Beach State played six times in 2002 and both
hail from the Big West Conference. The 49ers
swept the Titans over the weekend, but the
teams could meet six days later in Saturday
playofT games at Sunken Diamond.
"The other thing," Marquess said, "is that
the winner of USC's region plays the winner
of this region [to go to the College World Se
ries]. If it's Stanford, we've played [USC] six
