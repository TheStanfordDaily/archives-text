# Bloodthirsty takes men's Ultimate title
## 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Two hundred seventy-five men's col
lege Ultimate teams around the country
began in the running for this year's nation
al championship. If there was anything to
be learned from this past weekend's Ulti
mate Player Association College Champi
onships it was that Bloodthirsty, Stanford's
men's team, is clearly better than the na
tion's 274 other squads.
Top-seeded Bloodthirsty won Stan
ford's first men's Ultimate national champi
onship since 1984 with a 15-5 pounding of
third-seeded Wisconsin in the champi
onship game on Sunday in Spokane, Wash.
Superfly, Stanford's women's team,
nearly made Stanford the second sch<x)l to
ever sweep the national titles, advancing to
the finals. But second-seeded UC-San
Diego cut those hopes off with a 15-7 win in
the championship game, and third-seeded
Superfly settled for its second straight na
tional runner-up finish.
"The weekend was a testament to the
work ethic and drive of both the men's and
women's teams this year," said graduate
student Jit Bhattacharya, Bloodthirsty's
main handler. "After four years, the Stan

ford men were back where they belong in
the finals. After 18 years, the men brought
national championship trophy back home.
"112 low does it feel? Let's just say trying to
pass my classes in the next three weeks will
take a significant effort," he said.
Bloodthirsty was dominant in die field,
showing the most stifling defense at the
tournament all three days. Stanford al
lowed 10 or more points in only one game.
The team cruised through pwl play on
Friday, easily handling Texas and Michi
gan before disposing of long-time rival UC-
Santa Barbara, 15-6, to earn a spot in the
quarterfinals.
The defensive efforts of juniors Bail
Watson and Shreyas Vijaykuma, senior
1 hint Alcott and graduate students Jeff Di-
Carlo and Mike Whitaker helped shut
down UNC-Wilmington, 15-6, in the quar
terfinals on Saturday.
With Bhattacharya's throwing dead on
and senior Hunt Alcott catching every
thing in sight. Bloodthirsty then held off a
surprisingly strong llth-seeded William
and Mary, 15-10, in the semifinals.
""The key to our victory this weekend
was our defense," Whitaker said. "We take
pride in having the best man-to-man de
fense in the country and have worked ex

tremely hard on our marks, conditioning
and speed to make that possible."
Superfly started play on Friday strong,
picking up easy pool-play wins over Vir
ginia and Texas. But MIT turned in an im
pressive offensive showing in defeating
Stanford, 15-9, to force Superfly into an
other match before the quarterfinals.
Superfly opened Saturday's play with a
dominating 15-2 win over Northwestern in
the pre-quarters, but two tough matches
on the road to the final took a lot out of the
Stanford squad.
Senior Erin Percival hit sophomore
Karen Milch in the end zone to break a 12-
12 tie and start a three-point run for Su
perfly in its 15-12 win over fourth-seeded
Carleton in the quarterfinals.
Solid throwing by Percival and ju
niors Ciwen Ambler and Jamie Nuwor
helped Superfly overcome a 13-9 deficit
to take out top-seeded Colorado, 17-15,
in the semifinals.
But the Stanford squad looked to be out
of gas in the championship game, as UC-
San Diego's zone defense contained Super
fly's long bucks and Stanford couldn't slow
down the Psycho's offense. UC-San Diego
turned an 8-6 halftime lead into a 15-7 win
for the national title.
