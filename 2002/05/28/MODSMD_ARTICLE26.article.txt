### MATT BABIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Going into this weekend's play
at the NCAA Championships in
Auburn, Wash., the Stanford
women's golf team was riding a
streak of eight consecutive top-10
NCAA finishes. It was a streak
that unfortunately came to an
end this year at the Washington
National Golf Club, as the Cardi
nal finished the four-day tourna
ment in 11th place in the field of
24 teams.

WOMEN'S GOLF

Tuesday-Friday: Stanford
finished 11th at the NCAA
Championships

The Cardinal finished the first
round of the tournament in
ninth position, the same place in
which it ended the tournament
last year. It must have been a
comfortable spot, as the Cardinal
stayed in ninth after the second
and third rounds, falling to 11th
only on the final day of play.
The leader for the Cardinal
was sophomore Marcia Wallis.
Starting the tournament with a
hot hand and a two-under-par
round, her strong play continued
throughout the week. The two
sport star finished her first NCAA
Championships tied for Bth
place, her career best finish. She
ended the weekend with a one
under-par 287 (70-73-73-71).
Junior Kim Rowton, ranked
39th nationally, and sophomore
.Angela Rho were behind Wallis,
finishing 41st and 50th, respec

lively. While the two found them
selves in the top 25 going into the
final round, very competitive
play and lower scores across the
board negated their strong play
and pushed the two down in the
individual standings.
Rounding out play for the Car
dinal in the tournament were
sophomore Kim Kouwabunpat
and freshman Wendra Liang.
Kouwabunpat finished in a tie for
99th place, carding a 3.09 (78-80-
74-77), while Liang, also compet
ing in her first championship, tied
for 109 th position.
The national team tide went to
Duke, which was ranked No. 2 na
tionally coming into the tournament.
Stanford's Pacific 10 Conference
rival Arizona finished tied for 2nd,
as the Wildcats and the Blue Devils
traded places over the course of the
fourth and final round.
Virada Nirapathpongporn of
Duke took the individual honors
of the tournament at nine
under. She held off a pack of
challengers over the final round
to finish one shot ahead of a
group of four golfers who tied
for second place.
The future looks bright for the
Cardinal squad, as the young team
will lose no seniors and will have
gained another year's worth of
valuable experience.
Second Team All-Pac 10 player
Rowton, Pac-10 Honorable Men
tion player Liang and the rest of the
team will come back next season
eager not only to continue the
streak of 14 consecutive NCAA
Championship appearances, but
also to begin a new streak back in
the top 10.
