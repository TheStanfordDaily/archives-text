# Lack of funds forces student-founded Law Project to close
## 
### ANNA GALÁN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Facing a lack of money, the East Palo
Alto Community Law Project will perma
nently close its doors by Aug. 31, the pro
ject's board announced last week. The
law office, located on Bay Rd., was
founded by Stanford law students in
1984 to provide free legal services to the
newly incorporated community of East
Palo Alto.
"Everybody has been sad to see the
law project close," said Barton Thomp
son, Jr., vice dean of Stanford Law
School. "It has been a central part of our
clinical program for 18 years."
While the law project is an indepen

dent corporation, Stanford law students
have worked at the Law Project through
the Volunteer Attorney Program and
through a community law clinic class that
is part of their curriculum. Spring se
mester, 14 law students worked with at
torneys at the Law Project as part of the
class. In all, about 80 law students work
at the Law Project as volunteers each
year.
Thompson said the Law School still be
lieves it is important to have an office that
provides community services. He antici
pates that a new office will be run and
funded by the University.
By Sept. 1, the Law School plans to
create an office in East Palo Alto or East
Menlo Park that will allow students in the

community law clinic class to continue to
provide the residents of local communi
ties with some of the legal services that
the Law Project provided in the past.
"Everyone views this as an opportuni
ty for the Law School to open up a new
clinical office in the community," said
Thompson. "Hopefully we can create
something that both the University and
the community can be proud of."
Stanford funded $350,000 of the Law
Project's budget last year, with the rest of
the expenses for the project coming from
grants and private donors.
Last year, operating expenses and
salaries for the Law Project added up to
$850,000.
"In recent years, the project had

struggled really hard to have ehough
money to pay its bills," board member
Steven Dinkelspiel told the San Jose
Mercury News. Dinkelspiel, one of the
student founders, said that the financial
support has never measured up to the
amount of community support.
The Law Project's services to the com
munity focus on immigrant rights, work
place injuries and ensuring safe and af
fordable housing. It also provides legal
advice and representation, holds advice
clinics, and does policy work. The pro
ject has partnered with other local orga
nizations to address specific needs in the
community and has made efforts to edu
cate residents on relevant legal issues.
Renee Glover, the project's former ex

ecutive director, told the Mercury News
that one of the project's attorneys had in
spired her to go to law school.
"I'm stunned," Glover said. "It was 18
years. Eighteen years founded on the
blood and sweat of a lot of talented law
students."
According to Thompson, Stanford
law students will still have plenty of op
portunities for serving the community
through legal work.
Thompson said that over the past year
and a half, the Law School has begun
building a new group of legal clinics and
hiring new professors to focus on com
munity issues. He noted that in addition
to their regular classes, students
can take clinics to provide train
ing in a real-world setting. Clin
ics focus on issues such as envi
ronmental law, education advo
cacy, criminal prosecution, civil
rights and cyber law.
He said that through the clinics,
students typically represent either
individuals in low-income commu
nities or non-profit organizations.
According to the Mercury
News, Executive Director of the
Law Project Margaret Stevenson
struggled to find a positive way of
looking at the project's imminent
close.
"1 guess the only silver lining
to this— I'm trying really hard
to look for silver linings —is
there are many ways agencies
and people can work together,"
she said.
