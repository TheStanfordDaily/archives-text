# New magazine spotlights research at Stanford

### ALI ALEMOZAFAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
What is best characterized as an intellectu
al quest — a new magazine highlighting re
search at Stanford called Odyssey —, pub
lished its first issue less than two weeks ago.
Earlier this year, junior Farnaz Alemi,
Odyssey's editor in chief, decided to create
the magazine for the benefit of the entire
Stanford research community.
Unlike most research institutions, Stan
ford does not have a research magazine.
The Cornell Engineering Magazine,by
contrast, is published three times a year by
the school's college of engineering.
"Stanford does amazing research and is
known as a research-based institution, yet
there isn't a contemporary mainstream pub
lication that highlights the cutting-edge re
search," Alemi said.
According to Alemi, the plan was to create
a magazine unlike any other. "If you're going
to make a magazine, you should go all out,"
she said.
Odyssey is understandable to the lay audi
ence, similar to a popular science magazine,
Alemi added.
"It is contextually a mix between the Na
tional (ieographic and Stanford magazine
[but] at a smaller scale."
The first issue of the 112 ull-color magazine
includes an interview with Nobel Laureate
Richard Taylor and articles on topics that
range from biomotion to extraterrestrial
messages.
"We have touched upon faculty, under
graduate and graduate work done at Stanford
... we have provided a great mix between the
fuzzy and the techie fields," Alemi said.
Junior Kate Berland, who served as the
magazine's layout editor, said that she had been
involved in publications outside of Stanford,
but she joined the staff because she liked the
idea of having "research be accessible ... and
the lx*st part was meeting the [graduate] stu-

dents and being a part of putting together all
this world-class research and hopefully getting
other people interested."
Alemi hired a staff of five undergraduate
students from an applicant pool of over 100.
Ihe five-member team — comprised of ju
niors Golnaz Alemi and Berland and seniors
Eric Hendrix, Rebecca Milner and Nick
Ellis — worked for weeks to meet the pro
jected deadline.
"I told my stafTthat I want to see it and
get it out on May 15," Alemi added. "We
hit it right on the button."
"We didn't get anyone's support," she said.
"I think we did an amazing job with five [un
dergraduate] staff members."
Berland added that despite the "early
mornings and late nights [working on the
publication] it was worth it."
Funding has been an impediment to the
magazine's publication. Since the University
was reluctant to offer financial support, Alemi
said, it was necessary to kx)k elsewhere to
meet the projected budget.

Financial sources included grants from the
Arrillaga Center and the Wallenberg Foun
dation, a Swedish organization that strives to
improve teaching through technology. The
foundation is currently building the Stanford
Center for Innovations in Learning, which
will be located in Wallenberg Hall, the former
home of the political science department.
"I won a $'1,000 scholarship from the Arril
laga Center," Alemi added. "1 applied for the
grant and we made exactly the $11,000 that
we budgeted for in the beginning of the year."
"1 thought that it looked professional,"
Becca Nycum, a junior, said. "The layout
was great and the graphics were really in
triguing and captivating. I think it will be a
great conversation starter because it's been
widely distributed and ... a lot of people will
recognize it now."
Odyssey will be distributed to the top 50
universities nationwide and Stanford affiliates
around the world. Any sch<x>l piloting the
