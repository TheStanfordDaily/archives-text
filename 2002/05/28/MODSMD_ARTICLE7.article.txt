Proposed bill would
force government
agencies to keep e-mails
CORONA, Calif. (AP), — Local government agen
cies would have to save their e-mails under an Assem
bly bill that could face a vote as early as today.
The measure by Assemblyman Dennis
Hollingsworth, R-Murrieta, would expand the state's
Public Records Act to list e-mails, faxes and photo
copies as public documents.
Currently, many agencies delete or discard them.
"It's a very important thing to do to make sure the
Public Records Act keeps up with technology,"
Hollingsworth said.
There is no formal opposition to the bill, which was
prompted by a 1999 lawsuit.
Former resident Richard L). Ackerman sued the
Riverside County city of Corona after learning that it
routinely deleted e-mails from residents complaining
about morning traffic congestion.
The lawsuit was settled a few months later when
Corona drafted a policy on retaining e-mail. Acker
man later proposed a statewide bill to Hollingsworth.

Walnut Creek debates
ordinances to encourage
neighborly conduct
WALNUT CREEK, Calif. (AP) — Cily planners
are considering rules to help people be "good
neighbors."
Walnut Creek is filled with homes, meaning that
additions and expansions sometimes block neighbor
ing houses' sunlight and views.
City officials anticipate building will increase in the
next few years, raising the issue of where and how
much homeowners can expand and remodel.
Planners and city commissioners are discussing
limits on house sizes, limiting second-story floor plans
to 40 percent of existing square footage and requiring
second stories to be set back at least 10 feet from the
sides of properties.
But planners don't want to trample on property
owner's rights, and said the best solution might be to
set up some rules but allow for case-by-case evalua
tion.
"Good neighbors is what this is about," said Joseph
Corny, Design Review Commission chair. "And it's
hard to legislate being a good neighbor."
The commission is expected to continue debating
the matter next month.
