# Broccoli chemicals may prevent stomach cancer

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Broccoli and
broccoli sprouts contain a chemical that
kills the bacteria responsible for most
stomach cancer, say researchers, confirm
ing the dietary advice that moms have
been handing out for years.
In laboratory tests the chemical, sul
foraphane, killed helicobacter pylori, a
bacteria that causes stomach ulcers and
often fatal stomach cancers.
And the good news is there appears to
be enough of it in broccoli sprouts and
some varieties of broccoli to benefit peo
ple who eat the vegetables.
The researchers could not say how
much broccoli one would have to eat for
there to be an impact, something they
said could not be determined without
long-term tests involving humans.
" Fhe levels at which we tested
it . . . are such that those could be
achieved by eating broccoli or broccoli
sprouts. It's a reasonable level that we
think would be reached in the stomach,"
said Jed W. Fahey of the Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine.
The findings are reported in last
Tuesday's issue of Proceedings of the
National Academy of Science. Broccoli
sprouts are tiny three day-old plants that
resemble alfalfa sprouts and have a pep
pery flavor.
"I feel quite comfortable suggesting
people eat more fruits and vegetables,
specifically cruciferous vegetables, specif
ically broccoli," Fahey said. "We know it's
safe and healthy ... we know sul

foraphane is effective in protecting
against cancers."
Dr. Paul Talalay, a co-researcher at
Johns Hopkins, had previously reported
sulforaphane is an effective anticancer
agent and the new studies extended that
work to the bacteria that causes stomach
cancer and ulcers.
In the lab, the scientists found that sul
foraphane even killed helicobacter that
was resistant to commonly used antibi
otics.
They also showed it can kill the bac
terium whether it's inside or outside
cells. In people the bacteria can hide in
cells lining the stomach, making it more
difficult to get rid of the infection, said
Fahey.
The studies concentrated on mice and
the researchers will now seek to deter
mine of the same effect occurs in humans.
"If future clinical studies show that a
food can relieve or prevent diseases asso
ciated with this bacterium in people, it
could have significant public health im
plications in the United States and
around the world," Fahey said.
"In some parts of Central and South
America, Africa and Asia, as much as 80
percent to 90 percent of the population is
infected with helicobacter, likely linked to
poverty and conditions of poor sanita
tion," said Fahey, a plant physiologist.
Fhe bacteria can usually be treated
with antibiotics, but these are too costly
and scarce in many parts of the world, he
noted.
