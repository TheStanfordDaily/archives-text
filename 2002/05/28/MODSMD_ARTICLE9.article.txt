PETACH TIKVAH, Israel (AP) â€”A
suicide bomber blew himself up at an ice
cream parlor in an outdoor mall near Tel
Aviv yesterday, also killing two others in
cluding a 2-year-old girl whose blood
stained stroller lay on its side after the blast
amid a tangle of white plastic chairs. About
20 were wounded.
The attack, which came as Israeli troops

continued operations against Palestinian
militants in several West Bank towns,
demonstrated how exposed Israel's heart
land remains to attackers who appear able
to cross into its territory with virtual im
punity, despite a high-security alert.
Earlier yesterday, Israel's army de
clared a curfew in Bethlehem, where
troops arrested militants and searched

for arms and explosives as part of a poli
cy of quick raids on Palestinian towns.
Troops also conducted sweeps of two
other West Bank towns, Tulkarem and
Qalqilya.
In another development, the Palestin
ian Cabinet said yesterday it was "possible"
that presidential and parliamentary elec
tions would be held in December.
