SF planners want developers
to use building permits
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Planning commissioners
are telling developers with a building permit to "use it or
lose it."
With a glut of empty office space since the tech economy
faltered, planning commissioners say they don't want de
velopers holding onto permits if they don't have immediate
plans to build.
"We need an accurate assessment of what's going up and
what's not," commission president Hector Chinchilla said.
The San Francisco Planning Commission will hold a
hearing tomorrow to determine the status of construction
permits for millions of square feet that have not materialized
into offices.
Under the city's planning code, officials can revoke per
mits if developers do not start building within 18 months of
receiving the permit.
Real estate brokers have said they face an uncertain fu
ture with the tech downturn. Rent for prime space in the
city's financial district has fallen from $80 per square foot
two years ago to an average of $30 per square foot today.

Man faces jail time for
killing neighbor's dog
THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) — A man was sentenced
to 120 days in jail with work furlough for fatally shooting a
neighbor's dog with a pellet gun because he was annoyed by
its barking.
Gerald Thieman, 37, of Thousand Oaks, was arrested in
February after a 2-year-old beagle belonging to a family
across the street died from a pellet round. X-rays showed the
dog had been shot at least three other times with lead pellets.
Thieman pleaded guilty to one count of felony animal
cruelty. Under terms of his sentence, Thieman will be al
lowed to work at his construction job during the day but
must spend his nights in jail, beginning June 5.
Attorney Philip Dunn said his client didn't intend to kill
the dog, feels remorseful and has enrolled in anger-man
agement classes. In a letter to the judge, Thieman said he
had previously called police to complain about the animal,
but the barking continued.
