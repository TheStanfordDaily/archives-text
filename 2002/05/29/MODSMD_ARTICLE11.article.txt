1956
On May 29,1956, The Daily printed an ar
ticle about UCLA finding "the goods" on
Stanford.
"Charging that they 'have the goods, but
not the signed proof on Stanford, a group of
UCLA 'sleuths' rocked the Pacific Coast last
night with charges the United Press says
would place USC and the University of Cali
fornia under the Rose Bowl ban.
"An unnamed spokesman for the group
said, 'We've got it all down in black and white
on Southern California and we have the dope
jusLabout ready on California.
\ would say we have it on Stanford, too,
except we can't get it signed. The man who
gave us the dope on Stanford says that Dr.
Wallace Sterling, University president, has
warned that he'll fire every man on the Stan
ford athletic staff if anything is ever found
wrong with the recruiting and pay to athletes
there. And this fellow doesn't want to see foot
ball coach Chuck Taylor get the axe.'
"A1 Masters, Stanford Athletic Director,
chortled, 'That's a laugh,' when he was in
formed of the statements.
"'You are apt to find occasional under-the
table payments to an individual, but we don't
know of any.'
"Earlier this week the director said: 'If they
have anything on us, let them speak up.
We're ready to take our medicine if we have
done anything wrong. . . .I'll give them a bat
tle if they come up with just phony rumors
about us.'
"Masters' statement that 'I personally feel
we are in the clear and they know it' seemed
to best sum up official University feelings.
"The spokesman for the 'sleuths' refused
to reveal his name to the public, but definite
ly said his group, working on behalf of UCLA,
has 'all the facts necessary' to ban Cal and
USC from the Rose Bowl."
Bottom Line: Unlike today, Daily writers in the '50s
were obviously on crack, at least judging from this
story. However, it remains easier to find ' the dope"
at Cal than at Stanford.
