# 'America's Army' and batteries

### UDARA FERNANDO STAFF WRITER 
There's a new player in the multi-billion
dollar video gaming industry. This July, the
U.S. Army will launch a game called "Ameri
ca's Army" to boost its ranks. The software
gives users the power to conduct their own
Special Operations missions. Similar in for
mat to the wildly popular "Counterstrike,"
the game is network-only, meaning that team
strategies are the key to achieving mission ob
jectives. The game will be free, thanks to the
Army's guaranteed income stream from tax
money. Players can download the game from
goarmy.com, or it can be found as a CD-RC )M
game in upcoming issues of three computer
gaming magazines. Army recruiting stations
will also be handing out copies.

Once upon a time, Gatorade took the sports
nutrition world by storm. Champion Lyte
hopes to create another revolution. This ener
gy-drink promises to be a calorie-free alterna
tive that keeps people hydrated and replaces
electrolytes without sugar. The beverage is
made with a nonnutritive sweetener called ace
sulfame potassium, competing with Gatorade's
6-percent glucose-fructose-sucrose solution
that has 50 calories per 8-ounce serving.
Dealing with the myriad of battery sizes
available on the market can be a tedious task.
However, Panasonic's nickel-metal-hydride
battery set makes things easier by converting
AAs to C or D batteries. The set comes with
rechargeables, but regular alkalines work as
well. Just pop the AA battery into the appro
priate jacket. The downside is that this batter
lias the life of an AA, not of longer-lasting Cs
and Ds. The price is $30, and includes six AAs,

two AAAs, four adapters and a charger.
A $200,000 simulation of the human diges
tive tract by Belgian artist Wim Delvoye is cur
rently on display at New York City's New Mu
seum of Contemporary Art. The work is called
"Cloaca," after the Latin word for sewer. It fits
into Delvoye's usual theme: the mechanization
of society and its effects on the human body.
"Cloaca" has a huge plastic funnel "mouth"
t hat delivers food and water twice a day to a set
of glass chambers, so that one can observe
each step during the digestive process. Elec
tronic sensors monitor each chamber and sig
nal a series of electric pumps to keep the food
moving along the 33-foot long installation,
while the machine reproduces the level of
acidity found in the human stomach. In the
final chamber, liquid is drained into a waste
bucket, and the machine deposits an artificial
bowel movement on a conveyor belt.
