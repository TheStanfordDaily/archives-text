# Florida voters not intentionally denied rights

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice De
partment said yesterday it found no credible
evidence that any Florida residents were in
tentionally denied their right to vote in the
state that handed George W. Bush his margin
of victory in the 2000 presidential election.
The Justice Department, in a letter to
Congress, detailed findings so far in its inves
tigation of possible voting irregularities in
three Florida counties: Orange, Miami-Dade
and Osceola. The department is considering
lawsuits in those counties, saying that even
though polling problems were unintention
al, they may have deprived some voters of
their rights.
In the letter, the department acknowledged
polling problems in the three counties may
have led to small numbers of voters choosing to
leave the polls without casting ballots.
"While the Civil Rights Division discovered
evidence of significant confusion and delay in

the three counties, there were relatively few
voters who actually did not vote because of
these problems," wrote Assistant Attorney
General Ralph Boyd.
He said the small number "doesn't reason
ably cast any doubt on President Bush's sever
al hundred vote margin of victory in Florida."
"The Civil Rights Division found no credible
evidence in our investigations that Floridians
were intentionally denied their right to vote dur
ing the November 2000 election," Boyd said.
Poll watchers representing the Democratic
Party allege that many voters were turned away.
Boyd said that one of the three counties —
he did not say which one — may have em
ployed too fevy bilingual workers, causing de
lays in providing assistance.
"This may have resulted in at least 26 vot
ers choosing to leave the polls," the chief en
forcer of the nation's civil rights laws wrote
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman

Patrick Leahy, O-Vt.
Boyd said that his investigators confirmed
that a clerk denied poll watchers permission
to help four voters who asked for bilingual as
sistance. The denial constitutes a violation of
the Voting Rights Act.
In another of the other three counties —
again, the county was not specified — the inves
tigation found two cases of Haitian-American vot
ers being denied language assistance, Boyd said.
However, the investigation was unable to
confirm any of about 15 other alleged instances
of voters being denied bilingual assistance.
In the third county, political party poll
watchers alleged that approximately 140 vot
ers had difficulty casting ballots, "but it ap
pears that in every instance the voter was re
ferred to the Supervisor of Elections office"
for assistance, Boyd wrote. "The Civil Rights
Division has no evidence that any of these in
dividuals were unable to cast a ballot."
