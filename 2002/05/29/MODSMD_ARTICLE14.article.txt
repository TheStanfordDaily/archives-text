WEBBERS FALLS, Okla.
(AP) â€” Rescuers hoisted two ve
hicles with four bodies inside
from the murky Arkansas River
yesterday, bringing the death toll
from the collapse of an interstate
bridge to 13.
Lightning, rain and rising waters
hampered the rescuers, who picked
their way through the muddy water
searching for an unknown number
of people still missing after an out
of-control barge hit the Interstate
40 bridge and knocked out a 500-
foot section of highway. *
"We're determined because we
know there's family members out
there wondering if one of their
own is in here," said Dennis
Splawn, a diver with the Oklahoma
Highway Patrol.
The bodies of seven women and
six men have been recovered from
the waters below the ridge, said
highway patrol Lt. Chris West.
With the help of sonar, a crane had
hoisted 10 vehicles from the pile of
mangled concrete and twisted steel.
A champion horse trainer and a

police detective were among those
killed, authorities said.
About 10 families of people
trapped in cars at the bottom of
the river waited at the Webbers
Falls City Hall for news. About a
dozen vehicles plummeted into
the water Sunday morning after
the barge hit.
Earlier yesterday, an investiga
tor said towboat crew members' ac
counts support the towboat com
pany's contention that the pilot
had blacked out.
George Black of the National
Transportation Safety Board said a
crewman who visited with captain
Joe Dedmon five to 10 minutes be
fore the accident said everything
seemed normal.
Others who were not with the
captain said they heard no alarm or
change in the sound of the engine
that would indicate he was trying to
avoid a crash, Black said.
Dedmon, who tested negative
for drugs and alcohol, was to be in
terviewed by NTSB investigators
later yesterday.
