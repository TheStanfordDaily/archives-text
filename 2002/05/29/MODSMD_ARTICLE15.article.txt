## The
						Stanford Daily Athletic-academic relationship deserves examination 
### 
Published Since 1891

Cardinal athletics enjoyed a banner
weekend over the Memorial Day hol
iday. Two Stanford seniors captured
the NCAA women's doubles tide in
tennis, after the team won the national champi
onship a week before. Stanford baseball swept
past Washington State and picked up home
field advantage for the NCAA regionals. The
list of athletic achievements could go on — the
Cardinal is poised, after all, to win its seventh
consecutive Sears Director's Cup.
Stanford has exceptional athletes, just as it
has exceptional students. Athletes work ex
tremely hard at their sports and they deserve
our respect. Athletics are an integral part of Uni
versity life. Yet some faculty members, trustees
and students increasingly worry that Stanford
has very few exceptional student-athletes.
The University should address concerns
about the integration of sports and academics
head-on and seek ways to make athletic ac
complishment more compatible with aca

demic excellence.
The issues that concern the trustees and fac
ulty members who have spoken to us are signif
icant, if familiar. We share their worry that some
athletes self-segregate, often opting to live with
their teammates in Mirrielees rather than in
dorms or Row houses populated by students
who are not members of varsity sports teams.
While academic standards are not lower for
athletes, most students are aware that some of
the classes favored by varsity athletes have a rep
utation for academic laxity. In a similar vein, we
appreciate professors' complaints that sports
teams' travel schedules prevent team members
from doing serious research or otherwise en
gaging fully in the class curriculum, even when
they make up the work. This is not the athletes'
fault, but it does deserve to be examined.
The special privileges for varsity athletes at
Stanford — evidenced by a "training table"
menu in dorms, free clothing and tutors and
special class arrangements — can unwittingly

create a separate class of students who do not
truly belong to Stanford life.
These concerns merit attention. All Stanford
students should be held to the same academic
standards and expectations. The ones most
hurt by an indulgent attitude towards athletes
are the athletes themselves. They are the stu
dents who do not experience the full measure
of what Stanford has to offer. But the rest of the
University suffers, too.
Athletes' pursuit of sports accomplishment
is valuable because it fosters a love of excel
lence and develops a type of discipline that
contributes to a healthy intellectual life. If
athletes are separated from the general stu
dent body, the University as an intellectual
community loses the important perspective
on achievement and the distinctive discipline
of mind that athletes bring to the search for
knowledge.
Stanford should take steps to ensure that ath
letics contribute to the intellectual goals of the

University and the development of well-round
ed students. While a number of committees al
ready exist to address student-athlete issues,
they are spread across different branches of the
University and rarely cooperate. Perhaps Uni
versity President John Hennessy should ap
point a special joint task force on athletics and
academics at Stanford, to be comprised of facul
ty members, students, athletes and coaches. The
task force could focus on broad issues in the re
lationship between academics and athletics
while seeking specific ways to improve the inter
play between the two.
The place of varsity sports at Stanford
should be assessed. Stanford students, athletes,
coaches, faculty and parents take immense
pride that the University can blend top-flight
academics and athletics so well — the Universi
ty must work to make sure that this is really the
case. The bonding of athletics and academics
should be strengthened. Stanford students,
athletes and not, require nothing less.
