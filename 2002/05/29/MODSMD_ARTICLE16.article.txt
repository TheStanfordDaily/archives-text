# RUNNING ON EMPTY
## Formal: a fishy situation 
### 
Several months ago I received an
e-mail from the senior class pres
idents warning me to "get ready
for the best night of your life."
1 have heard that line before. Four
years ago, 1 was also promised the best
night of my life by the organizers of the
Huntington Beach High School senior
prom.
Not to be cynical, but sitting around a
giant tent with 500 horny teenagers and
a bouffant hairdo supported by an im
penetrable web of hairspray barely
cracks the top 20. I was not about to fall
for that one again.
Also, if your grandmother ever offers
to take you to her hairdresser before a
big event, tell the old lady no.
Like the prom, senior formal was

pitched as a Night to Re
member, or an Evening
Under the Stars, or An
other Generic Formal
Theme that Suggests
Romance Without Con
doning Sex or Drinking.
However, the Class of
2002 does not tolerate
the kind of second-rate

rented tent that passes for memorable in
suburban high school circles. We require
class. We require style. We require fish.
The dance was at the Monterey Bay
Aquarium.
I he only thing better than an evening
under the stars is an evening under giant
fiberglass whale models. I was in. For my
date I enlisted a very fun friend who
once distinguished himself at a boat
dance by ljc king the side of the boat on a
$3 bet. Any girl reading this who would
like his number can e-mail me.
A campaign of e-mails leading up to
the dance informed us that in addition to
music, hors d'oeuvres and the company
of 900 of my closest friends, the formal
would feature access to the Deep Sea ex
hibit, which, as we were frequently re
minded, closed at 1 1 p.m.
All of these proved to be very enter
taining.
Note to future formal planners: Fish
are nice, but the considerable price of the
ticket should include a few other perks,
such as a seven-course dinner, dancing
elves and a personal appearance by Jesus
Christ.
We could also purchase tickets to a
bus that would transport us from Tresid
der to Monterey. In theory, this sounds
like a giant roving party that ensures a
safe and sloshed night for everyone.
In reality, it is very hard to sustain a
buzz for two and a half hours in traffic
with 70 people sharing a closet-sized
bathroom. We stumbled off the bus in
Monterey bleary-eyed but psyched, in
plenty of time to see the Deep Sea exhib
it before it closed at 11 p.m.
There they were! The fish! They were

luminous, mesmerizing and very pa
tient, considering the slightly intoxicated
people bumping into their tanks and the
chef serving fried calamari less than four
feet away.
The aquarium encourages hands-on
understanding of our friends in the sea.
On the lower level there was a shallow
pool filled with live destingered
stingrays that you can reach in and
touch.
On this particular night, all of the
stingrays were huddled together des
perately in the farthest corner of the
pool, flapping over each other in an at
tempt to avoid the drunk people gazing
woozily into the - water and swiping
clumsily at them. You could almost hear
them cursing their lack of limbs with
which to fight back.
In addition, we also got to play in the
children's exhibit, "Flippers, Flukes and
Fun." Did you know that a baby whale
can drink up to 80 pounds of milk a day?
Learning is awesome!
The revelry continued until 11:00,
when a large man appeared out of
nowhere and began shouting that it was
time to leave the Deep Sea exhibit.
Lights dimmed. An automatic door start
ed to seal off the entryway as people
dived beneath it. Confused students
were physically blocked from getting
back in to retrieve drinks and forgotten
dates. It was like the last moments of the
Titanic.
What do the fish do after 11 p.m. that
the public must not see? Do they need
privacy to sleep? To mate? Do they hop
out of their tanks, light up cigarettes and
bitch about the stress of the entertain
ment industry?
Whatever it is, the closure of the ex
hibits meant that it was time to dance. I
like dancing and welcome the chance to
do so in large, sweaty groups.
My dancing repertoire consists of a
single move that has evolved only slight
ly since 10th grade. "The Move" involves
a semi-synchronized swinging of my hips
and elbows that can be speeded or
slowed according to the music. It can be
interspersed with short leaps during
"Jump Around" or simple hand forma
tions during "YMCA." It is very, very
white. However, it works for me.
Bopping along in the teeming sea of
drunken humanity that is the senior
class, seeing our happiness reflected in
the underbelly of the gray whale replica
hanging overhead, I couldn't help but
feel a little sentimental. Will we all stay in
touch? Will I miss times like these? If I
bet him $3, will my date lick a stingray?
We'll see, yes and I don't want to
know.
