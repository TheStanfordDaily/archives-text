Immigration control an
environmental necessity
Immigration as a national security
issue has been a hot topic since the Sept.
11 tragedy, but the real threat of immi
gration remains environmental. I dare
you to name one problem our nation
feces that more people would help solve.
You can't, can you.
Last decade the United States added
34 million people—Bs percent through
legal and illegal immigration. Therefore
we must severely limit further immigra
tion if we are not to become another
China, India or Mexico.
Humans are not an endangered
species on this planet but animals are. We
have too many people, and are rapidly
losing fisheries, forests, farms, and our
feathered and furry friends, not to men
tion energy resources and quality of life.
Naive Democrats ignore immigration
because most immigrants vote Democratic;
myopic Republicans and greedy business
men tolerate immigration because it keeps
wages low and unions weak. Ironically, im
migration hurts our poor, our minorities
and yesterday's immigr ants the most.
This issue has nothing to do with racism,
ethnocentrism or xenophobia; it is simply a
numbers problem. Don't call yourself an
environmentalist unless you are doing
something to limit immigration and popu
lation. Remember: "All causes are lost caus
es without population control."

Stanford needs wake-up call in labor
negotiations
Over 75 Stanford students are camping
out in the Main Quad, calling on Universi
ty President John Hennessy to "wake up"
to his responsibility to Bon Appetit workers,
who are currently in contract negotiations.
On May 31, the workers' contract ex
pires with Bon Appetit, a subcontractor
that provides food services at Stanford.
Students are calling on Hennessy to direct
Bon Appetit to provide parity in wages and
benefits with directly hired food-service
employees and, if necessary, amend the
University contract with Bon Appetit to
make this possible.
Bon Appetit workers are a prime ex
ample of the workers currently over
looked by Stanford's "living wage" policy
and the way subcontracting has been
used to undercut wages at Stanford.
Hennessy's so-called living wage poli
cy, announced in February, established a
minimum wage of $10.10 per hour with
benefits or $ 11.35 without benefits. How
ever, this policy applies only to subcon
tracted, non-unionized employees at
Stanford. The starting wage for Bon Ap
petit workers is currently $8.50, but be
cause these workers are unionized, Hen
nessy's policy does not apply to them.

Directly hired dining services workers,
on the other hand, who have similar job
descriptions, have starting wages of
$10.35 per hour. Students and workers
are demanding equal pay for equal work:
parity in wages and benefits between sub
contracted Bon Appetit workers and di
rectly hired dining-service workers.
Following worker and student protests
last winter, Haivard set the precedent for
university administrations intervening to
uphold labor standards for unionized sub
contractors. Harvard President Larry
Summers announced a new campus labor
policy on Jan. 31 that called for parity in
wages and benefits between directly hired
and subcontracted workers. As a result,
unionized janitors at Harvard won parity in
their contracts in February.
Stanford administrators continue to
claim that they cannot interfere with con
tract negotiations and will not make a state
ment supporting Bon Appetit workers, but
the Harvard example illustrates that the
administration can have a direct impact on
labor standards at Stanford.
The Coalition for Labor Justice at Stan
ford has been calling fora Code of Con
duct for labor standards at Stanford
throughout this academic year. The Code
of Conduct calls fora living wage and af
fordable benefits for all workers at Stan
ford, neutrality in organizing and a mora
torium on subcontracting out formerly di
rectly hired positions.
This is also a wake-up call for students to
demonstrate their support for the workers
that serve them. Come join us today and
tonight as we camp out in Main Quad.

lean on Bon Appetit to pay their workers

wages and benefits that equal what the Uni

As a graduate student, I should proba

ASSU's Undergraduate Senate. However,
a recent incident involving a newly elected
senator as well as occasional perusals of the
ASSU's newsgroup have pointed out a sec
tion in the ASSU constitution that I find
somewhat disturbing.
The section in question involves the re

ing to the constitution, a member can be re
moved by either a vote from the under
graduate population or by a two-thirds vote
from the Undergraduate Senate. Some
grounds for removal are listed, including a
consistent failure to attend meetings. How
ever, what disturbs me is that the grounds
for dismissal start with the phrase "shall in
clude, but not be limited to."
While this is perfecdy fine for when stu
dents want to recall a member, this phrase
should not apply to the removal of a mem
ber by other members. Otherwise, any sen
ators expressing or defending a minority
opinion could conceivably be removed by a
two-thirds majority. /Ml of the grounds al
lowing for the expulsion of a member by fel
low members need to be explicidy defined.
Finally, the Undergraduate Senate
should try to accommodate their fellow sen

them. If students running fora position on
the Undergraduate Senate know that they

Stanford needs wake-up call in labor
negotiations
Over 75 Stanford students are camping
out in the Main Quad, calling on Universi
ty President John Hennessy to "wake up"
to his responsibility to Bon Appetit workers,
who are currently in contract negotiations.
On May 31, the workers' contract ex
pires with Bon Appetit, a subcontractor
that provides food services at Stanford.
Students are calling on Hennessy to direct
Bon Appetit to provide parity in wages and
benefits with directly hired food-service
employees and, if necessary, amend the
University contract with Bon Appetit to
make this possible.
Bon Appetit workers are a prime ex
ample of the workers currently over
looked by Stanford's "living wage" policy
and the way subcontracting has been
used to undercut wages at Stanford.
Hennessy's so-called living wage poli
cy, announced in February, established a
minimum wage of $10.10 per hour with
benefits or $ 11.35 without benefits. How
ever, this policy applies only to subcon
tracted, non-unionized employees at
Stanford. The starting wage for Bon Ap
petit workers is currently $8.50, but be
cause these workers are unionized, Hen
nessy's policy does not apply to them.

Directly hired dining services workers,
on the other hand, who have similar job
descriptions, have starting wages of
$10.35 per hour. Students and workers
are demanding equal pay for equal work:
parity in wages and benefits between sub
contracted Bon Appetit workers and di
rectly hired dining-service workers.
Following worker and student protests
last winter, Haivard set the precedent for
university administrations intervening to
uphold labor standards for unionized sub
contractors. Harvard President Larry
Summers announced a new campus labor
policy on Jan. 31 that called for parity in
wages and benefits between directly hired
and subcontracted workers. As a result,
unionized janitors at Harvard won parity in
their contracts in February.
Stanford administrators continue to
claim that they cannot interfere with con
tract negotiations and will not make a state
ment supporting Bon Appetit workers, but
the Harvard example illustrates that the
administration can have a direct impact on
labor standards at Stanford.
The Coalition for Labor Justice at Stan
ford has been calling fora Code of Con
duct for labor standards at Stanford
throughout this academic year. The Code
of Conduct calls fora living wage and af
fordable benefits for all workers at Stan
ford, neutrality in organizing and a mora
torium on subcontracting out formerly di
rectly hired positions.
This is also a wake-up call for students to
demonstrate their support for the workers
that serve them. Come join us today and
tonight as we camp out in Main Quad.
THE COALITION FOR LABORJUSTICE

Prof supports Bon Appetit workers
1 am writing concerning the on-going
negotiations between the workers and Bon
Appetit. It seems that the workers at Bon
Appetit are not being paid wages that are
comparable to dining service workers, al
though they do the same job. I call upon
University President John Hennessy to
lean on Bon Appetit to pay their workers

wages and benefits that equal what the Uni
versity gives its own food semce staff.

Grad student objects to section of
ASSU Constitution
As a graduate student, I should proba
bly not care about what happens in the
ASSU's Undergraduate Senate. However,
a recent incident involving a newly elected
senator as well as occasional perusals of the
ASSU's newsgroup have pointed out a sec
tion in the ASSU constitution that I find
somewhat disturbing.
The section in question involves the re
moval of members from the Undergradu
ate Senate (Article 11, Section 3.J). Accord
ing to the constitution, a member can be re
moved by either a vote from the under
graduate population or by a two-thirds vote
from the Undergraduate Senate. Some
grounds for removal are listed, including a
consistent failure to attend meetings. How
ever, what disturbs me is that the grounds
for dismissal start with the phrase "shall in
clude, but not be limited to."
While this is perfecdy fine for when stu
dents want to recall a member, this phrase
should not apply to the removal of a mem
ber by other members. Otherwise, any sen
ators expressing or defending a minority
opinion could conceivably be removed by a
two-thirds majority. /Ml of the grounds al
lowing for the expulsion of a member by fel
low members need to be explicidy defined.
Finally, the Undergraduate Senate
should try to accommodate their fellow sen
ators' absences instead of trying to remove
them. If students running fora position on
the Undergraduate Senate know that they
will l>e studying abroad for part of their
term, they should clearly point that out be
fore the election. If they still get elected,
then their fellow senators need to accept the
fact that their presence on the Undergrad
uate Senate is the will of the students.

Immigration control an
environmental necessity
Immigration as a national security
issue has been a hot topic since the Sept.
11 tragedy, but the real threat of immi
gration remains environmental. I dare
you to name one problem our nation
feces that more people would help solve.
You can't, can you.
Last decade the United States added
34 million people—Bs percent through
legal and illegal immigration. Therefore
we must severely limit further immigra
tion if we are not to become another
China, India or Mexico.
Humans are not an endangered
species on this planet but animals are. We
have too many people, and are rapidly
losing fisheries, forests, farms, and our
feathered and furry friends, not to men
tion energy resources and quality of life.
Naive Democrats ignore immigration
because most immigrants vote Democratic;
myopic Republicans and greedy business
men tolerate immigration because it keeps
wages low and unions weak. Ironically, im
migration hurts our poor, our minorities
