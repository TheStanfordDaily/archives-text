# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## A 						hunger for peace: questioning the military-academic complex 
### 
Two weeks ago, 12 Santa Clara
University students fasted for
four clays straight on the steps
of the school's Mission Church.
Their fast came during a student-led
campaign against the school's connection
with military industry, a struggle that
began several months ago when Santa
Clara received a gift of $50,000 from the
Lockheed Martin corporation for its engi
neering department, part of the $1.5 mil
lion that the school has received over the
past 25 years.
Concerned about the ethical and moral
implications of their university's relation
ship with the world's number-one
weapons manufacturer, students asked
the administration to return the most re
cent gift, hoping it would lead toward
breaking ties with Lockheed.
Santa Clara's situation raises deep con
cerns about Stanford's multi-faceted rela
tionship with the military-industrial com
plex. Lockheed Martin, for example, is no
stranger to Stanford — a recent entry of
"Lockheed Martin" on the Stanford
search engine yielded 311 results.
Lockheed is one of the top four U.S. de
fense contractors, manufacturing aircraft,
missiles and launch systems. One half of all
Lockheed sales go to the U.S. Govern
ment, which in turn sells $14 billion worth
of weapons to nations around the world,

many of whom are known human rights
violators.
Lockheed sells weapons to countries
on both sides of conflicts, fueling war,
and has also refused to sign a statement
that would reject the production and
usage of landmines, as 19 other compa
nies have. And Lockheed, with offices in
Sunnyvale, is clearly eager for fresh Stan
ford graduates to come contribute to the
development of destructive weapons, as
the company's presence at last week's ca
reer fair shows.
But Lockheed is only the tip of the ice
berg. In fact, Stanford is a classic example
of the Cold War university, meaning that
it is largely dependent on patronage
from the military and from foundations
and other industries that support mili
tary research.
Consider the following: Stanford is one
of the top three schools in the United
States in its direct involvement with nucle
ar weapons explosion simulation, through
the Academic Strategic Alliance Program
and under the guidance of the Depart
ment of Energy. The program is part of a
project of three nuclear weapons labs in
volved in the nuclear "stockpile steward
ship and management program." Closely
linked to this project is Stanford's Center
for Integrated Turbulence Simulations
and the Stanford / NASA Center for Tur

bulence Research.
In other words, the Department of En
ergy uses the on-campus programs to
train and recruit the next generation of
nuclear weapons specialists and creates
perhaps involuntary associations between
student and faculty research and the de
sign and operation of weapons of mass de
struction. The research in question en
compasses physics and mathematics as
well as astronomy, biology, chemistry,
computer science and various engineer
ing disciplines.
Rumor has it that some students and
professors have taken the initiative to dis
entangle themselves from any research
directly connected to the military, but I
wonder how many more don't realize the
potentially destructive implications of
their work.
I came to Stanford hoping to learn how
to help create a more peaceful and just
world — not expecting expecting that my
university would support research on
weapons that destroy rather than support
human life. By accepting the status quo we
implicitly support it.
Stanford is an elite academic institution
in the world's richest nation, and the posi
tion of power and influence we wield obli
gates us to, at the very least, adopt a sense
of social responsibility in our business
partnerships. Furthermore, we should

start striving to act in the interests of the
world's poor and oppressed, who suffer
disproportionately from the impacts of the
militarism that the University's research
partnerships perpetuate.
So why did Santa Clara students choose
to fast? As student organizer Mckinsey
Miller explained in a recent interview,
"We believe that we are obliged to act
against injustice, and that part of that pro
cess is claiming personal agency rather
than simply allowing administrators to
think and act for us. In fasting, we sought
to remind ourselves of the suffering in the
world and our inherent ability to resist as
sociations with systems that promote the
continuation of that suffering.
We at Stanford would do well to use
the example set by Santa Clara students
as an opportunity to examine our own
conscience regarding military research
at our university. Past examples of Stan
ford activism can inspire and motivate
us —in 1977, students convinced the
University to divest funds from corpora
tions in apartheid South Africa, sparking
a massive movement for divestment
across the country. It started with just a
few students.
Change doesn't come overnight, and
no, Santa Clara University has not yet re
nounced its ties with Lockheed Martin.
But a friend involved in last week's hunger

fast reports, "The biggest thing we have
accomplished thus far is to change this
campus from one that is apathetic and
apolitical to one that is contemplative and
questioning." Open dialogue on the issue
is a necessary start. And the changes at
Santa Clara should serve as a call and a
challenge for us to do the same.

University students fasted for
four clays straight on the steps
of the school's Mission Church.
Their fast came during a student-led
campaign against the school's connection
with military industry, a struggle that
began several months ago when Santa
Clara received a gift of $50,000 from the
Lockheed Martin corporation for its engi
neering department, part of the $1.5 mil
lion that the school has received over the
past 25 years.
Concerned about the ethical and moral
implications of their university's relation
ship with the world's number-one
weapons manufacturer, students asked
the administration to return the most re
cent gift, hoping it would lead toward
breaking ties with Lockheed.
Santa Clara's situation raises deep con
cerns about Stanford's multi-faceted rela
tionship with the military-industrial com
plex. Lockheed Martin, for example, is no
stranger to Stanford — a recent entry of
"Lockheed Martin" on the Stanford
search engine yielded 311 results.
Lockheed is one of the top four U.S. de
fense contractors, manufacturing aircraft,
missiles and launch systems. One half of all
Lockheed sales go to the U.S. Govern
ment, which in turn sells $14 billion worth
of weapons to nations around the world,

many of whom are known human rights
violators.
Lockheed sells weapons to countries
on both sides of conflicts, fueling war,
and has also refused to sign a statement
that would reject the production and
usage of landmines, as 19 other compa
nies have. And Lockheed, with offices in
Sunnyvale, is clearly eager for fresh Stan
ford graduates to come contribute to the
development of destructive weapons, as
the company's presence at last week's ca
reer fair shows.
But Lockheed is only the tip of the ice
berg. In fact, Stanford is a classic example
of the Cold War university, meaning that
it is largely dependent on patronage
from the military and from foundations
and other industries that support mili
tary research.
Consider the following: Stanford is one
of the top three schools in the United
States in its direct involvement with nucle
ar weapons explosion simulation, through
the Academic Strategic Alliance Program
and under the guidance of the Depart
ment of Energy. The program is part of a
project of three nuclear weapons labs in
volved in the nuclear "stockpile steward
ship and management program." Closely
linked to this project is Stanford's Center
for Integrated Turbulence Simulations
and the Stanford / NASA Center for Tur

bulence Research.
In other words, the Department of En
ergy uses the on-campus programs to
train and recruit the next generation of
nuclear weapons specialists and creates
perhaps involuntary associations between
student and faculty research and the de
sign and operation of weapons of mass de
struction. The research in question en
compasses physics and mathematics as
well as astronomy, biology, chemistry,
computer science and various engineer
ing disciplines.
Rumor has it that some students and
professors have taken the initiative to dis
entangle themselves from any research
directly connected to the military, but I
wonder how many more don't realize the
potentially destructive implications of
their work.
I came to Stanford hoping to learn how
to help create a more peaceful and just
world — not expecting expecting that my
university would support research on
weapons that destroy rather than support
human life. By accepting the status quo we
implicitly support it.
Stanford is an elite academic institution
in the world's richest nation, and the posi
tion of power and influence we wield obli
gates us to, at the very least, adopt a sense
of social responsibility in our business
partnerships. Furthermore, we should

start striving to act in the interests of the
world's poor and oppressed, who suffer
disproportionately from the impacts of the
militarism that the University's research
partnerships perpetuate.
So why did Santa Clara students choose
to fast? As student organizer Mckinsey
Miller explained in a recent interview,
"We believe that we are obliged to act
against injustice, and that part of that pro
cess is claiming personal agency rather
than simply allowing administrators to
think and act for us. In fasting, we sought
to remind ourselves of the suffering in the
world and our inherent ability to resist as
sociations with systems that promote the
continuation of that suffering.
We at Stanford would do well to use
the example set by Santa Clara students
as an opportunity to examine our own
conscience regarding military research
at our university. Past examples of Stan
ford activism can inspire and motivate
us —in 1977, students convinced the
University to divest funds from corpora
tions in apartheid South Africa, sparking
a massive movement for divestment
across the country. It started with just a
few students.
Change doesn't come overnight, and
no, Santa Clara University has not yet re
nounced its ties with Lockheed Martin.
But a friend involved in last week's hunger

fast reports, "The biggest thing we have
accomplished thus far is to change this
campus from one that is apathetic and
apolitical to one that is contemplative and
questioning." Open dialogue on the issue
is a necessary start. And the changes at
Santa Clara should serve as a call and a
challenge for us to do the same.
