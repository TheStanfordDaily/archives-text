## Tennis finishes long season 
### JERRY LU STAFF WRITER 
The NCAA Individual Championships
were a microcosm of the entire year for the
men's tennis team. The tournament illus
trated that, despite missing several key play
ers, the team flourished and came up with
big wins when necessary.
Out of the three Stanford players enter
ing the 64-deep singles tournament, held at
Texas A & M, two advanced to the semifinals
before losing close sets to worthy rivals.
The lone Stanford doubles team en
tered in the tournament and fought its
way through a field of 32 to the champi
onship game.
Junior Ryan Haviland, playing singles,
had previously upset seventh-seeded Ro
main Ambert of Mississippi State in the
first round.
He then won six of the next seven sets
against stiff competition to earn a spot in
the semifinals.
Haviland's blistering streak ran him
headlong into the Jesse Witten, the No. 4
seed from Kentucky, who had dropped only
one set so far in the tournament.
Although Witten managed to take the
first set, 6-4, Haviland fought back, securing
the second set, 7-5. But fatigue and the hot
Texas sun played to Witten's advantage, al
lowing him to take the final set, 6-1.
"I pulled out a close second set, but my
calves had been cramping since 5-5 of the
set," Haviland explained. "It was so hot that
we had to take a 15-minute break, which
only made my muscles cramp up worse. I
had the momentum going out of the second
set, but after the break, I had trouble moving
and serving."
"It hurt to play, but I didn't want to de
fault since I was representing my school. It's

a real shame. I felt I was playing well and it
was my time," he added.
For fellow junior David Martin, his sec
ond year in the NCAAs proved to be more
rewarding than the first.
After progressing through the first two
rounds, Martin found himself facing fifth
seeded A1 Garland of Pepperdine, who had
defeated Martin earlier in the year, leading
to the Cardinal's dual-match loss against
the Waves.
The match turned out to be a straightfor
ward, slightly anti-climactic 6-3, 6-4 victory
over Garland.
"I played well last time we met, but I
didn't finish him off," said Martin.
"When he's down he starts going for
more. This time, I made an effort not to
let him do it again."
Martin then blitzed past Bay Area rival
John Paul Fruttero of California, 7-3, 6-2 in
another quick victory.
In his third straight-set win in four days,
Martin rapidly took control of the match,
and was able to dictate the entire second set.
"I went out loose, going after my shots.
I went out wanting to play the right way,"
said Martin.
It was No. 1 seed, Matias Boeker of Geor
gia, defending champion and top-ranked
player in the country, who eventually shut
Martin down.
Boeker crushed Witten 7-5,6-0 in the fi
nals, leaving him the undisputed singles
champion for the second consecutive year.
Witten, who had defeated Stanford junior
Scott Lipsky in the second round, leaves
with the infamy of taking out two of Stan
ford's best.
In the other half of the tournament, the
lone Stanford doubles team in the draw per-

formed up to the high expecta
tions that earned Lipsky and Mar
tin a No. 1 national ranking lor
much of the season.
The pair reached the semifi
nals last year only to lose, ironi
cally, to Boeker and Travis Par
rett of Georgia.
This year, the second-seeded
tandem used their familiarity with
the tournament to fight their way
through a draw that saw the rest of
the seeded doubles teams defeated
in quick succession.
"It's another year of experience

with a lot more matches under our
belt," explained Martin.
Lipsky and Martin, reaching
the doubles final for the first time
in their careers, dueled with An
drew Colombo and Mark Kovacs
of Auburn for the title.
Despite performing in a well
played and exhausting match, the
Cardinal duo fell, 6-2, 3-6, 6-2.
"We started down 5-0, but it
wasn't as if we were being de
stroyed out there," said Lipsky.
"Every game was close, so we
weren't demoralized at all.
In the second set we jumped on
their serves more, but after the 10-
minute break for heat, we might
have been a little tight."
Looking back on the season the

players leave the Championships
with mixed feelings.
"It was a real roller-coaster year.
We had the best team in the coun
try, and we showed that at the [Na
tional Team] Indoors.
But injuries happen, and you
have to deal with them," said Hav
iland, who ended the year 30-11.
"Next year's going to be real
ly exciting.
The four of us who will be se
niors next year have learned a lot
from the years before, and we'll
be able to lead the team," said
Lipsky.
"We've had a good team the
last two years, and next year will
be great. It should be fun,"
added Martin.

of Auburn for the title.
Despite performing in a well
played and exhausting match, the
Cardinal duo fell, 6-2, 3-6, 6-2.
"We started down 5-0, but it
wasn't as if we were being de
stroyed out there," said Lipsky.
"Every game was close, so we
weren't demoralized at all.
In the second set we jumped on
their serves more, but after the 10-
minute break for heat, we might
have been a little tight."
Looking back on the season the

players leave the Championships
with mixed feelings.
"It was a real roller-coaster year.
We had the best team in the coun
try, and we showed that at the [Na
tional Team] Indoors.
But injuries happen, and you
have to deal with them," said Hav
iland, who ended the year 30-11.
"Next year's going to be real

The four of us who will be se

from the years before, and we'll
be able to lead the team," said
Lipsky.
"We've had a good team the
last two years, and next year will
be great. It should be fun,"
added Martin.
The NCAA Individual Championships
were a microcosm of the entire year for the
men's tennis team. The tournament illus
trated that, despite missing several key play
ers, the team flourished and came up with
big wins when necessary.
Out of the three Stanford players enter
ing the 64-deep singles tournament, held at
Texas A & M, two advanced to the semifinals
before losing close sets to worthy rivals.
The lone Stanford doubles team en
tered in the tournament and fought its
way through a field of 32 to the champi
onship game.
Junior Ryan Haviland, playing singles,
had previously upset seventh-seeded Ro
main Ambert of Mississippi State in the
first round.
He then won six of the next seven sets
against stiff competition to earn a spot in
the semifinals.
Haviland's blistering streak ran him
headlong into the Jesse Witten, the No. 4
seed from Kentucky, who had dropped only
one set so far in the tournament.
Although Witten managed to take the
first set, 6-4, Haviland fought back, securing
the second set, 7-5. But fatigue and the hot
Texas sun played to Witten's advantage, al
lowing him to take the final set, 6-1.
"I pulled out a close second set, but my
calves had been cramping since 5-5 of the
set," Haviland explained. "It was so hot that
we had to take a 15-minute break, which
only made my muscles cramp up worse. I
had the momentum going out of the second
set, but after the break, I had trouble moving
and serving."
"It hurt to play, but I didn't want to de
fault since I was representing my school. It's

a real shame. I felt I was playing well and it
was my time," he added.
For fellow junior David Martin, his sec
ond year in the NCAAs proved to be more
rewarding than the first.
After progressing through the first two
rounds, Martin found himself facing fifth
seeded A1 Garland of Pepperdine, who had
defeated Martin earlier in the year, leading
to the Cardinal's dual-match loss against
the Waves.
The match turned out to be a straightfor
ward, slightly anti-climactic 6-3, 6-4 victory
over Garland.
"I played well last time we met, but I
didn't finish him off," said Martin.
"When he's down he starts going for
more. This time, I made an effort not to
let him do it again."
Martin then blitzed past Bay Area rival
John Paul Fruttero of California, 7-3, 6-2 in
another quick victory.
In his third straight-set win in four days,
Martin rapidly took control of the match,
and was able to dictate the entire second set.
"I went out loose, going after my shots.
I went out wanting to play the right way,"
said Martin.
It was No. 1 seed, Matias Boeker of Geor
gia, defending champion and top-ranked
player in the country, who eventually shut
Martin down.
Boeker crushed Witten 7-5,6-0 in the fi
nals, leaving him the undisputed singles
champion for the second consecutive year.
Witten, who had defeated Stanford junior
Scott Lipsky in the second round, leaves
with the infamy of taking out two of Stan
ford's best.
In the other half of the tournament, the
