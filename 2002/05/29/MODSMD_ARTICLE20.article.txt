# Women prepare for NCAAs
## Stanford women travel south in search of NCAA Championship 
### MINAYO NASIALI STAFF WRITER 
After a third-place finish in last week's
Pacific 10 Conference Championships, 13
of the the Cardinal's top-scoring athletes are
preparing for this weekend's NCAA Cham
pionships in Lousiana.
Held at LSU in Baton Rouge, Division 1
teams from around the nation will send
their qualifying athletes to the annual three
day meet, from May 29 to June 1.
The Cardinal will meet with stiff com
petition in this elite athletic arena. How
ever, the individual athletes have the ad
vantage of their team's support , and their
own separate resolve, dynamism, and
qualifying marks.
Some of the 13 athletes with the qualify
ing marks to compete in this season's NCAA
championships will participate in distance
events, while the remainder will compete in
field events. As the Cardinal has consistent
ly demonstrated its strength in the distance
and field events, the contingent of Stanford
athletes reflects this dynamic.
In the distance events, Stanford dis
patches junior team captain distance run
ners Lauren Fleshman, and freshman Sara
Bei to represent Stanford in the 5,000 me
ters. Fleshman garnered her NCAA qualify
ing time at the Mt. SAC Relays on April with
her first-place finishing time of 15 minutes,
35.39 seconds.
She is the 2002'Pac-l0 champion in the

5,000 meters and her 18 team points con
tributed to the Cardinal's third-place rank
ing at the Pac-10 Championship.
Currently ranked first among collegiate
runners, Fleshman's 5,000-meter time is al
most 16 seconds faster than the No. 2 time
this year. The defending champion
in the 5,000 meters, she is also the 2002
NCAA indoor 3,000 meter champion.
Senior Caroline Annis, and junior Erin
Sullivan will compete in the 10,000 meters.
Annis ran her NCAA qualifying race at the
Stanford Invitational on March 29 finishing
with a time of 34:09.4. She is an All-Ameri
can in cross country, a four-time All Pac-10
selection in track and cross country, and an
NCAA Post-Graduate Scholarship winner.
Sullivan qualified at the Stanford Invita
tional with a time of 34:10.32. Ranked sixth
all-time at Stanford, she is also the 2002 Pac
-10 champion in the 10,000 meters. A two
time Ail-American in cross country, Sullivan
was named the 1999 Pac-10 Cross country
Athlete of the Year, and the 1999 Pac-10
Newcomer of the Year.
Senior Maurica Carlucci and redshirt ju
nior Malindi Elmore will represent the Car
dinal. Finishing fourth in the 1,500 meters
and seventh in the 800 meters at the 2002
Pac-10 Championships, Carlucci also quali
fied to run the 800 meters, but will instead
focus on the 1,500 to conclude her under
graduate athletic career.
Senior Laura Turner, the school
record holder in the 3,000 meter steeple
chase, set her qualifying mark at Big Meet
on May 4 with a time of 10:13.47. Senior
Ashley VVysong ranks No. 2 all-time at
Stanford and will compete in the 800 me-
