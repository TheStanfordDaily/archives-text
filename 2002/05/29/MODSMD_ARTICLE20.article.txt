pionships in Lousiana.
Held at LSU in Baton Rouge, Division 1
teams from around the nation will send
their qualifying athletes to the annual three
day meet, from May 29 to June 1.
The Cardinal will meet with stiff com

own separate resolve, dynamism, and
qualifying marks.
Some of the 13 athletes with the qualify

championships will participate in distance
events, while the remainder will compete in
field events. As the Cardinal has consistent

athletes reflects this dynamic.
In the distance events, Stanford dis

ners Lauren Fleshman, and freshman Sara
Bei to represent Stanford in the 5,000 me

in the 5,000 meters, she is also the 2002
NCAA indoor 3,000 meter champion.
Senior Caroline Annis, and junior Erin
Sullivan will compete in the 10,000 meters.
Annis ran her NCAA qualifying race at the
Stanford Invitational on March 29 finishing
with a time of 34:09.4. She is an All-Ameri
can in cross country, a four-time All Pac-10
selection in track and cross country, and an
