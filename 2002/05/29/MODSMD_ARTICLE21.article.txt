# Men's track and field heads to Louisiana
## Cardinal men look to defend NCAA Championship title 
### DANIEL URBAN STAFF WRITER 
Balmy Baton Rouge, La. will
host the 2002 NCAA Track and
Field Championships May 30
through June 2, and the Cardi
nal men's squad enters in full
stride.
Riding the momentum of its
second consecutive upset victory
at the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships, Stanford is send
ing 11 men to nationals, looking to
improve on last year's fourth
place finish or even match 2000's
Cinderella win.
Many of the athletes who quali
fied gave huge performances in

the clutch at the Pac-10 meet and
the national championship will re
quire an even greater effort.
Judging by the season thus far,
the Cardinal is up to the challenge,
with talent spanning the distances,
jumps and throws represented at
the championships.
Senior Jonathon Riley leads the
Cardinal pack as the seasoned vet
eran and most accomplished long
distance runner on the team.
His finishing kick in the final
100 »meters of last year's 5,000-
meter race at the NCAA champi
onship gave him the national title,
and he returns in the same event
this year for his final collegiate
race. Riley is seeded sixth.
Joining Riley in the 5,000-
meter is junior Louis Luchini,
whose time of 13 minutes, 42.31
seconds ranks 1 Ith in the nation.
A hero of the Pac-10 meet for
his third-place finisfi in the 5,000-

meter sans one shoe, Luchini will
run both the 5,000 and the 10,000
meters in the Championships. Lu
chini's 10,000-meter time of 28
minutes, 49.86 seconds ranks
tenth in the nation.
The 5,000-meter race will be
stacked with Cardinal jerseys, as
sophomores Crant Robison and
Seth Hejny bring the total of Stan
ford athletes entered in the event
to five.
Hejny enters the race with a
time of 13:50.77, while Robison
has posted a 13:40.30. All five ath
letes are threats in what could po
tentially be a huge point-scoring
race for Stanford.
No less likely to significantly in
crease the Cardinal's point total is
the 1,500 meters.
Stanford has three athletes en
tered in the event: Robison.
sophomore Don Sage and senior
Cabe Jennings.

Jennings' races this season have
been solid, but not nearly as spec
tacular as some of his previous
performances. However, Jen
nings possesses extraordinary tal
ent and an uncanny ability to ex
plode with a huge race.
He was the NCAA champion in
the event in 2000, the runner-up
in 2001, and may be the Cardinal's
best hope for an individual victory
in 2002.
As if having Jennings in the
race weren't enough, opponents
must also face Robison and
Sage, two of the nation's best
middle-distance runners in
their own right.
Sage's time of 3:41.61 and Ro
bison's 3:42.14 rank ninth and
11 th amongst collegians.
Junior Jesse Thomas ran a ca
reer best time of 8:39.90 in the

Cardinal Invitational, which ranks
him sixth among the tough field in
the event at nationals.
Senior Adam Tenforde quali
fied in the 10,000 meters with a
time of 28:57.65.
Completing the Cardinal army
of distance runners, sophomore
lan Dobson grabbed the final
qualifying spot for tfie 10,000 me
ters with his time of 29:06.41.

Altogether, the Cardinal is rep
resented in every event 1,500 me
ters or longer.
Only two non-distance athletes
represent Stanford at the Cham
pionships, and both are returning
competitors from last year's
Championship.
Juniors Omer I nan and
Michael Ponikvar competed in the
discus and high jump, respective
ly, last year and both came away
with eighth-place finishes.
Inan has had an outstanding
season from the start, setting a
school record with his throw of
198 feet, 7 inches.

Ponikvar struggled with early
injuries but has come on incredi
bly strong in the season's later
meets, and enters nationals with a
jump of 7-ft-2.5.
A top finish at nationals for the
Cardinal depends on many it's".
Every competitor must be at his
best when the time comes.
While the Cardinal is not fa
vored to win the national title, the
team seems to have a bit of magic
this season, seen in its upset win at
the Pac-10 championship.
If every Cardinal athlete per
forms at his peak, another surprise
victory is hot out of the question.

second consecutive upset victory
at the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships, Stanford is send
ing 11 men to nationals, looking to
improve on last year's fourth
place finish or even match 2000's
Cinderella win.
Many of the athletes who quali
fied gave huge performances in

the clutch at the Pac-10 meet and
the national championship will re
quire an even greater effort.
Judging by the season thus far,
the Cardinal is up to the challenge,
with talent spanning the distances,
jumps and throws represented at
the championships.
Senior Jonathon Riley leads the
Cardinal pack as the seasoned vet
eran and most accomplished long
distance runner on the team.
His finishing kick in the final
100 »meters of last year's 5,000-
meter race at the NCAA champi
onship gave him the national title,
and he returns in the same event
this year for his final collegiate
race. Riley is seeded sixth.
Joining Riley in the 5,000-
meter is junior Louis Luchini,
whose time of 13 minutes, 42.31
seconds ranks 1 Ith in the nation.
A hero of the Pac-10 meet for
his third-place finisfi in the 5,000-

meter sans one shoe, Luchini will
run both the 5,000 and the 10,000
meters in the Championships. Lu
chini's 10,000-meter time of 28
minutes, 49.86 seconds ranks
tenth in the nation.
The 5,000-meter race will be
stacked with Cardinal jerseys, as
sophomores Crant Robison and
Seth Hejny bring the total of Stan
ford athletes entered in the event
to five.
Hejny enters the race with a
time of 13:50.77, while Robison
has posted a 13:40.30. All five ath
letes are threats in what could po
tentially be a huge point-scoring
race for Stanford.
No less likely to significantly in
crease the Cardinal's point total is
the 1,500 meters.
Stanford has three athletes en
tered in the event: Robison.
sophomore Don Sage and senior
Cabe Jennings.

Jennings' races this season have
been solid, but not nearly as spec
tacular as some of his previous
performances. However, Jen
nings possesses extraordinary tal
ent and an uncanny ability to ex
plode with a huge race.
He was the NCAA champion in
the event in 2000, the runner-up
in 2001, and may be the Cardinal's
best hope for an individual victory
in 2002.
As if having Jennings in the
race weren't enough, opponents
must also face Robison and
Sage, two of the nation's best
middle-distance runners in
their own right.
Sage's time of 3:41.61 and Ro
bison's 3:42.14 rank ninth and
11 th amongst collegians.
Junior Jesse Thomas ran a ca
reer best time of 8:39.90 in the

Only two non-distance athletes
represent Stanford at the Cham
pionships, and both are returning
competitors from last year's
Championship.
Juniors Omer I nan and
Michael Ponikvar competed in the
discus and high jump, respective
ly, last year and both came away
with eighth-place finishes.
Inan has had an outstanding
season from the start, setting a
school record with his throw of
198 feet, 7 inches.

Ponikvar struggled with early
injuries but has come on incredi
bly strong in the season's later
meets, and enters nationals with a
jump of 7-ft-2.5.
A top finish at nationals for the
Cardinal depends on many it's".
Every competitor must be at his
best when the time comes.
While the Cardinal is not fa
vored to win the national title, the
team seems to have a bit of magic
this season, seen in its upset win at
the Pac-10 championship.
If every Cardinal athlete per
forms at his peak, another surprise
victory is hot out of the question.
