# Stanford adds kayaking team
## 
### 
Stanford is no stranger to innovation — in
fact, we're renowned for it. Still, it was
somewhat a surprise for me to discover the
extent to which Stanford athletics are also
a part of that tradition.
The latest culprit is the Stanford Flatwater
Kayak team.
While kayaking has gained increased recre
ational popularity over the years, the American
public has yet to be convinced of its entertain
ment value, preferring instead the glitz of the

NBA playoffs and the spectacle
of the Super Bowl and other
events of that ilk.
However, the sport is much
bigger in Asia, Europe, and
Canada and holds Olympic sta
tus in the summer games, giv
ing it a big international pres
ence. With a growing following
here in the United States, colle
giate kayaking emerged last

year with the hope that universities would de
velop programs over the next few years.
Stanford was one of the very first to jump in.
Gina Sanchez, a graduate student in interna
tional relations, formed the club this past year,
hoping to see it reach club sport status soon.
Sanchez has plenty of experience — including
competing at the U.S. Nationals — and used
her expertise to put together a championship
racing team.
Though Georgia Tech has the only other col
legiate program in the country, one cannot dis
count the club's accomplishments this season,
which culminated in the college championship.
Displaying the same ingenuity and energy as
any start-up, the team managed to put together
an impressive array of sponsors, including
Berkeley Rowing and Paddling Club, Portland
Canoe and Kayak Club, the Newport Aquatic
Center, Seattle Canoe Club, and Sacramento
State. These groups provided the capital —
namely the boats and equipment — necessary
to get the club running, or rowing, as the case
may be.
The Stanford Crew program also proved in
dispensable to the group, providing the rowers
with advice and support on how to build a suc
cessful program from the ground and helping
to garner student support for the club.
It would seem all the preparation paid off. In
its inaugural season, the 20-member team col
lected 35 medals at the championships in Chula
Vista, Calif.
Co-president Andrew Waxman finished
strong with gold medal wins in both the Novice
1000 meter K-l and the Novice 200 meter K-l,
while teammates Emily Slota, Clare Baldwin,
Tee Sing, Mark Lim, and Michelle deVigneaud
also added to the gold medal collection.
In a testament to the program's strength,
Stanford qualified two boats to compete in the
World University Games to be held in Bari,
Italy in September while others qualified to be
alternates. Such a move sent a strong message
to the rowing community as to the strength of
Stanford's program and will hopefully encour
age other teams to emerge.
Other west coast programs in the early stages
of development include California, the UG- San
Diego, Oregon and Washington.
The emergence of more teams would mean a
stronger competitive schedule for the club as
well as the possibility to host various regattas.
Stanford plans to continue to play a forma
tive role next year, announcing it will hold a
long-distance regatta in the fall and a sprint re
gatta in the spring, in addition to the interna
tional competition it take part in.

While the flatwater club deals
specifically with head-to-head
racing on calm water, many of its
participants come from the more
insane disciplines of whitewater

kayaking adding to the versatility
and the skill group of the team.
The group is determined to pro
mote American kayaking in all its
forms and help it develop.
With a little bit of dedication,
tenacity, and adaptability, this
club has become a legitimate
leader in the growth of its sport
and yet another Stanford pioneer.
