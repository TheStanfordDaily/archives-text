# Detroit gets a taste of nostalgia
## 
### 
Game 6 of the NHL Western Conference
Finals between the Detroit Red Wings
and the Colorado Avalanche starts
tonight at 5 p.m. in Denver. As the Red
Wings woefully trail the series 3-2, the livelihood of
Detroit sports memories in this century rides pure
ly on the skates of its team.
Detroit is a no-frills kind of city that lives vicari
ously through its sports history. A deluge of sports
memories fills our heads whenever we reflect back
on our childhood.
We remember rising out of our seats at Tiger
Stadium to see the immortal Pat Sheridan hit a
home run in the 1987 American League Champi-

onship Series against the Minneso
ta Twins and lead the Tigers to a
crucial 1-0 playoff victory.
We remember a chilly Monday
evening in 1994, when the Detroit
Lions made a playoff run on the
back of Barry Sanders, who twist
ed, jibed, and danced for almost
200 yards in a nationally-televised
upset victory of the defending

world champion Dallas Cowboys.
And we still remember watching Vinnie John
son's clutch jumper with 0.7 seconds left on the
clock that clinched the Pistons' championship in
1990 over the Portland Trail Blazers. From Gordie
Howe to A1 Kaline, and Isiah Thomas to Barry
Sanders, sports celebrities exist in the treasured an
nals of the city's history.
Unfortunately, the Tigers haven't won a playoff
game since that fateful October day. Likewise, the
Pistons haven't won a title since Vinnie sank that
shot, and the Lions haven't even made a champi
onship game since they won the NFC champi
onship decades ago.
So, the city of Detroit has had to rely only on the
Red Wings to carry on its sports legacy. Conse
quently, for us Detroiters here at Stanford, the Red
Wings have become a way through which we can
reflect on our hometown and recollect our child
hood memories.
Over the past decade, as the Red Wings have be
come a premier NHL franchise, Detroit has be
come "Hockeytown," engendering an identity and
creative spirit quite unlike other cities, especially
the Detroit of previous decades.
The eight-legged octopi that rest motionless on
the windowsills of people's home all over Detroit as
well as the "Go Wings!" flags that flutter from car
antennas serve as a reminder that sports culture is
ingrained into the way of life of Detroiters.
Recently, names such as Hull, Robitaille, and
Hasek have been added to the vocabulary of Michi
gan's sports fanatics, joining current Wings' lumi

naries like Yzerman, Fedorov, and Lidstroin.
These are names that decorate conversations
both in Detroit and and in out dorm rooms here
Stanford. The Red Wings' roster now boasts at least
nine future Hall-of-Famers, who, along with the
rest of the team, are on a mission to bring a third
Stanley Cup to the city.
Each player has sacrificed his ego to come togeth
er in the Detroit tradition of companionship and
teamwork, in no small part due to the Wings' coach,
the winningest in Nlll, history, Scotty Bowman, who
has imaginatively fiised the talent together.
These personalities, along with the perennially
sold-out Joe Louis Arena, the home of the Red

Wings and one of the oldest profes
sional hockey arenas in the coun
try, combine to produce the rich
hockey culture in Detroit that cre
ates a feeling of nostalgia for us.
This Ã¼biquitous spirit intensifies
whenever we watch a Red Wings
game on television or see someone
walking down the street wearing
that acclaimed red-and-white jersey

with the letters "YZERMAN" sewn onto the back.
A cursory examination of us Michiganders might
reveal a leigned apathy toward our home state.
Let's be honest, the winters are harsh, the pot
holes are endless on Interstate 94, the Motor
City's largest freeway and burned-out homes mar
the landscape around the downtown area.
These familiar attractions are an integral part of
our history, constantly visible to us and those visi
tors who we can cajole into visiting us.
In reality, however, we could be no prouder
about our hometown. Detroit has produced a
range of exceptional individuals, ranging from
Madonna to Henry Ford to Stevie Wonder.
It is a place where individuals survive
through the hardships and struggles of the day,
to celebrate companionship and an inimitable
culture by nighttime. Detroit is a town where
success or luxury has never come at the expense
of its humanity.
With Chicago to the south, and Canada to the
north, the city has had to foster its own ethos and
somehow convince 1 million inhabitants to also sub
scribe to that.
And if it takes a frozen octopus sliding across
the crisp ice of the hockey rink at Joe Louis Arena
to remind us of t hat fact, so be it.
