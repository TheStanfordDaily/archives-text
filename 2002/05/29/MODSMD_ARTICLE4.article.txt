# SAID promotes world research

### IRENE NOGUCHI STAFF WRITER 
Harvard has a group dedicated to studying interna
tional development. So does UC-Berkeley. But until
January, Stanford didn't.
It took four frustrated seniors and a few coffee meet
ings at Tresidder Union before the Stanford Association
for International Development came to life. The net
work linking students with professionals and with other
undergraduates kicks off its inaugural conference this
Saturday at the Bechtel International Center.
"We were all pretty frustrated by the fact there was
nothing really out there for Stanford students to access,"
said co-founder Caitlin Gerdts. "We had all done our
own [international] work, but had a hard time finding
the resources, the faculty connections and certainly the
student connections."
Gerdts had spent the summer studying reproductive
health in Mongolia. Her co-founders — Yeling Tan,
Jesse Torrence and Shad Ahmed — were also returning
from around the world. Torrence
researched ecotourism's impact in
South America, Ahmed worked for
non-governmental organizations
providing loans to Cairo women
and Tan studied the effects of mi
crofinanceon women in Nepal. But
there was no one to share their find
ings with.
Besides his thesis work on eco
tourism, "which will get seen by my
advisor and the library staff," Tor
rence said, "[my experience] was
limited to the pictures I put up on
my wall." ,
"The few times I did share with
other people, that's when it got ex
citing, and I haven't been that excit
ed since I've been down [in Chile],"
Torrence said.
Students needed an outlet to get
together and talk, he said. "There
were plenty of campus groups, but
each worked separately.
"1 don't know how many times I
walked into a meeting with a Stan
ford international society, and in t he
room next door was another group
doing similar stuff but with no idea
the other existed," Torrence said.
The organization, more com
monly known by its acronym, SAID,
aims to change that. 'Hie group has
already held a series of dinners
called "Never Been SAID." Stu
dents are linked up with profession
als like Nicholas Hope, the director
of the Center for Research on Eco
nomic Development and Policy Re

form who also worked at the World
Bank for 13 years.
"You get an inside perspective of
the very real things you have to deal
with as a person who wants to dedi
cate his life to [international devel
opment]," Torrence said. "Unlike
other careers, there's not a definite
path everybody takes, like bache
lor's., masters, doctorate. Do 1 go to
work fora non-governmental orga
nization? Do I go back to school?
Maybe die Peace Corps? There are
a million different routes you can
take and it's kind of overwhelming."
Armin Rosencranz, a consulting
professor of human biology and
founder of Pacific Environment,
talked about running a non-gov
ernmental organization at a group
dinner two weeks ago. Since most
international development pro
grams are interdepartmental, the
dinners provide a common ground
for students and professors, accord
ing to Rosencranz.
"The faculty are so scattered
that they don't talk to one anoth
er," Rosencranz said. "The right
hand doesn't know what the left
hand is doing."
But he said there's a vast interest
in international development.
When he taught a seminar on the ef
fects of globalization on labor and
the environment, over 80 students
showed up the first day.
"A lot of people say that it's some
thing that should have been around
a long time ago, and we filled a gap,"
Tan said.
Tan and her co-founders flew to
Boston in April for an international
conference at I farvard. It was Har

vard's eighth. This weekend is Stan
ford's first.
A panel of experts as well as up
perclassmen who have worked
overseas will be speaking, followed
by a non-profit exhibition of devel
opment opportunities.
Stanford used to have a similar
group years ago, Tan admits, but
it fizzled out. To guard against
that, the four seniors decided to
name themselves as founders
since they will graduate in June.
Sophomores and juniors were
elected to be officers.
Junior Tanya Goldman, the
president-elect for next year, is
planning to build an internship pro
gram for graduating seniors with a
non-governmental organization,
similar to a joint program Pr i nce
ton has with the International Res
cue Committee. According to Gold
man, 120 members have signed
onto the group's Web site (said.stan
fbrd.edu) since it was launched last
week. The site is modeled after Club
Nexus, linking students together so
they can discuss jobs, internships
and development in general.
Goldman herself is a wellspring
of development experience, having
grown up overseas when both her
parents worked for the U.S. Agency
for International Development.
"Growing up in a place like New
Delhi, every time you go out onto
the street you see children begging
at corners, people with leprosy and
other diseases, and you really un
derstand the need for development
in a country of one billion people,"
Goldman said.
"I've been to villages and seen

the need for wells within closer
walking distance. In Rwanda, you
will see small children under 10
years old lined up in huge long lines
waiting to use a water pump to fill
up a plastic jerry-can, and walking
over a mile carrying a couple gallons
back to their home."
Sharing these experiences is
what enables development work to
move forward and actually have a
positive impact, Gerdts said.
"If you go fora summer and
leave again, there's nothing left [to
continue] what you've done,"
Gerdts said. "It can be a negative
aspect of international work if you
don't provide sustainability. We
want to provide a foundation
where people can build off work
done by Stanford students previ
ously, and not have to reinvent the
wheel every time a project needs to
get done."
In the future, the group said it
hopes to work closely with others
like Volunteers in Asia, the Society
for International Affairs at Stanford,
Caribbean Students Association,
Volunteers in Latin America, Pro
ject Dosti, Stanford Project on
Hunger and Nutrition and the
Stanford South Asian Society.
The founders themselves will be
spreading across the world after
graduation. Gerdts is joining the
Peace Corps in Ecuador and
Ahmed is returning to work fora
non-governmental organization in
Egypt. Tan will be working with the
Asia Foundation through the Tom
Ford Fellowship, and Torrence is
looking to join a non-governmental
organization in South America.

the street you see children begging
at corners, people with leprosy and
other diseases, and you really un
derstand the need for development
in a country of one billion people,"
Goldman said.
"I've been to villages and seen

the need for wells within closer
walking distance. In Rwanda, you
will see small children under 10
years old lined up in huge long lines
waiting to use a water pump to fill
up a plastic jerry-can, and walking
over a mile carrying a couple gallons
back to their home."
Sharing these experiences is
what enables development work to
move forward and actually have a
positive impact, Gerdts said.
"If you go fora summer and
leave again, there's nothing left [to
continue] what you've done,"
Gerdts said. "It can be a negative
aspect of international work if you
don't provide sustainability. We
want to provide a foundation
where people can build off work
done by Stanford students previ
ously, and not have to reinvent the
wheel every time a project needs to
get done."
In the future, the group said it
hopes to work closely with others
like Volunteers in Asia, the Society
for International Affairs at Stanford,
Caribbean Students Association,
Volunteers in Latin America, Pro
ject Dosti, Stanford Project on
Hunger and Nutrition and the
Stanford South Asian Society.
The founders themselves will be
spreading across the world after
graduation. Gerdts is joining the
Peace Corps in Ecuador and
Ahmed is returning to work fora
non-governmental organization in
Egypt. Tan will be working with the
Asia Foundation through the Tom
Ford Fellowship, and Torrence is
looking to join a non-governmental
organization in South America.
Harvard has a group dedicated to studying interna
tional development. So does UC-Berkeley. But until
January, Stanford didn't.
It took four frustrated seniors and a few coffee meet
ings at Tresidder Union before the Stanford Association
for International Development came to life. The net
work linking students with professionals and with other
undergraduates kicks off its inaugural conference this
Saturday at the Bechtel International Center.
"We were all pretty frustrated by the fact there was
nothing really out there for Stanford students to access,"
said co-founder Caitlin Gerdts. "We had all done our
own [international] work, but had a hard time finding
the resources, the faculty connections and certainly the
student connections."
Gerdts had spent the summer studying reproductive
health in Mongolia. Her co-founders — Yeling Tan,
Jesse Torrence and Shad Ahmed — were also returning
from around the world. Torrence
researched ecotourism's impact in
South America, Ahmed worked for
non-governmental organizations
providing loans to Cairo women
and Tan studied the effects of mi
crofinanceon women in Nepal. But
there was no one to share their find
ings with.
Besides his thesis work on eco
tourism, "which will get seen by my
advisor and the library staff," Tor
rence said, "[my experience] was
limited to the pictures I put up on
my wall." ,
"The few times I did share with
other people, that's when it got ex
citing, and I haven't been that excit
ed since I've been down [in Chile],"
Torrence said.
Students needed an outlet to get
together and talk, he said. "There
were plenty of campus groups, but
each worked separately.
"1 don't know how many times I
walked into a meeting with a Stan
ford international society, and in t he
room next door was another group
doing similar stuff but with no idea
the other existed," Torrence said.
The organization, more com
monly known by its acronym, SAID,
aims to change that. 'Hie group has
already held a series of dinners
called "Never Been SAID." Stu
dents are linked up with profession
als like Nicholas Hope, the director
of the Center for Research on Eco
nomic Development and Policy Re

form who also worked at the World
Bank for 13 years.
"You get an inside perspective of
the very real things you have to deal
with as a person who wants to dedi
cate his life to [international devel
opment]," Torrence said. "Unlike
other careers, there's not a definite
path everybody takes, like bache
lor's., masters, doctorate. Do 1 go to
work fora non-governmental orga
nization? Do I go back to school?
Maybe die Peace Corps? There are
a million different routes you can
take and it's kind of overwhelming."
Armin Rosencranz, a consulting
professor of human biology and
founder of Pacific Environment,
talked about running a non-gov
ernmental organization at a group
dinner two weeks ago. Since most
international development pro
grams are interdepartmental, the
dinners provide a common ground
for students and professors, accord
ing to Rosencranz.
"The faculty are so scattered
that they don't talk to one anoth
er," Rosencranz said. "The right
hand doesn't know what the left
hand is doing."
But he said there's a vast interest
in international development.
When he taught a seminar on the ef
fects of globalization on labor and
the environment, over 80 students
showed up the first day.
"A lot of people say that it's some
thing that should have been around
a long time ago, and we filled a gap,"
Tan said.
Tan and her co-founders flew to
Boston in April for an international
conference at I farvard. It was Har

vard's eighth. This weekend is Stan
ford's first.
A panel of experts as well as up
perclassmen who have worked
overseas will be speaking, followed
by a non-profit exhibition of devel
opment opportunities.
Stanford used to have a similar
group years ago, Tan admits, but
it fizzled out. To guard against
that, the four seniors decided to
name themselves as founders
since they will graduate in June.
Sophomores and juniors were
elected to be officers.
Junior Tanya Goldman, the
president-elect for next year, is
planning to build an internship pro
gram for graduating seniors with a
non-governmental organization,
similar to a joint program Pr i nce
ton has with the International Res
cue Committee. According to Gold
man, 120 members have signed
onto the group's Web site (said.stan
fbrd.edu) since it was launched last
week. The site is modeled after Club
Nexus, linking students together so
they can discuss jobs, internships
and development in general.
Goldman herself is a wellspring
of development experience, having
grown up overseas when both her
parents worked for the U.S. Agency
for International Development.
