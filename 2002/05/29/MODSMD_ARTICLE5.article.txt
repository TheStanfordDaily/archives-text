# Students hold two-day labor protest
## Students with SLAC, NAACP and other groups rally for higher wages 
### ALI ALEMOZAFAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
More than 50 Stanford students
camped out in the Main Quad last night
and Monday night, calling on the Uni
versity's administration to "wake up"
and make changes to increase' the
wages and benefits Bon Appetit em
ployees receive.
Several tents and a backdrop of
signs stood out in front of University
President John Hennessy's Building 10
office. The protest was spearheaded by
the Coalition for Labor Justice, a group
partly composed of the Stanford's
chapter of t he National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People
and the Stanford Community for Peace
and Justice.
"[I have] friends who are in [the
Stanford Labor Action Coalition] and I
think it's a great cause," said junior
Luna Federici.
Prepared with books and blankets,
students say they will sleep in the Quad
until the University takes notice.
Junior Meghana Reddy, the co-co
ordinator of the coalition, told Dean of
Students Marc Wais on Monday that
students would stay in the Quad "as
long as the workers want us out here."
Today at noon, Bon Appetit work
ers will also stage their own protest
starting at Tresidder Union and walk

ing to the Quad.
The protest took place amid negoti
ations between Bon Appetit workers
and company management, in light of
the looming May 31 expiration of their
current contract. Both students and
workers are demanding that the Uni
versity set a baseline for the wages and
benefits that all subcontracted and di
rectly hired dining workers receive.
"Hennessy said earlier this year the
he cares about every single worker on
the Stanford campus," said Jeramie
Scott, who works with the Stanford
chapter of the NAACP. "We are here to
get Hennessy to take concrete action to
show he really is committed to the well
being of all Stanford workers."
Bon Appetit, a Stanford subcontrac
tor, is not obligated to offer its employ
ees the same wages and benefits given
to directly hired workers for Dining
Services. The starting wage for Bon
Appetit workers at Tresidder Union
and the Graduate School of Business is
$8.50 an hour with benefits less than
those of directly hired Stanford work
ers, who make a minimum of $ 10.10 an
hour, according to organizers.
"Very depressing," said one Bon
Appetit worker who asked to remain
anonymous. "Just because it's the same
work and there are some workers that
are getting paid less."
Freshman Anna Mumford, one of
the event's organizers, said, "We're out
here to ask Hennessy to give equal pay
to all workers. The University is con
cerned about this but they don't really
know what to do."
Wages and benefits for subcontract-

Ed campus workers is an ongoing issue
on campus. A protest last 112 all sought to
address wages for some janitors at Stan
ford Hospital, who were also subcon
tracted by the University.
"(The University doesn't] have this
official policy that will eliminate this

problem," sophomore lan Slattery
said. "They just [have to] stop brushing
the students off and start working with
them."
According to protest organizers, Ron
Appetit workers are an example of the
way subcontracting has been used to un
dercut wages of Stanford workers. Sub
contracting to unionized workers eludes
Hennessy's living wage policy, which es
tablished a minimum wage of $ 10.10 an
hour with benefits of $11.35 an hour
without, organizers said.
Worker and student protests last win
ter led Harvard University President
Larry Summers to announce a new cam
pus labor policy calling for parity in
wages and benefits between directly
hired and subcontracted workers. The
outcome of events at Harvard shows that
Stanford can have a direct impact on
labor standards, protest organizers said.
"We're here telling Hennessy that
fair wages needs to be a priority when
he writes the budget," said freshman
Kelly Wells.
"[There is] a level of apathy on cam
pus," junior Katrina Logan said. "Peo
ple don't care."
Logan's "equal pay for equal work"
button summed up the protestor's ob
jectives: a normalization of the wages
and benefits of all subcontracted and di
rectly hired campus workers.
