# Neural technologies change brain

Ever dream about moving things with just
your mind? Or wonder about the "Matrix"-like
possibility of plugging into a virtual-reality world
through a jack attached to the back ofyour skull?
I hesc cyber fantasies could become reality as
advances in the field of neuroscience and electri
cal engineering push the boundaries of what re
searchers can do with the human brain.
Stanford researchers are at the forefront of
developing neural prosthetic technologies. Kr
ishna Shenoy, a professor of electrical engineer
ing and neurosciences, heads the new Neural-
Prosthetic Systems Laboratory, a part the inter
disciplinary Bio-X Program.
Shenoy's work involves implanting devices
that decipher signals from the brain, offering
hope for severely paraly/ed patients to regain
lost motor functions.
"We really want to build interfaces with the
brain, to bypass injured parts of the body by
reading signals out of the body to control
things," Shenoy said.
His research is similar to (he recently pub

lished work of Brown University researchers
who used a sophisticated processing algorithm
to translate brain signals from rhesus monkeys
into computer signals. This allowed the monkeys
to move a computer cursor with their minds in
real time.
"We're reverse engineering the brain, trying
to figure how neurons encode and represent in
formation," Shenoy said.
Surgical procedures to implant devices in the
brain require high-precision technology to en
sure the lowest risk of harm.
"We plan the lowest-impact pathway. We go
through the areas of the brain that undoubtedly
have important functions, but if you tear some of
them up, you're not as sensitive to the deficits."
Shenoy said.
While Shenoy's interest is in restoring func
tionality to severely disabled people, there are
fears that others might use these technologies for
cosmetic-enhancement purposes since "it's theo
retically possible to get much higher-level per
formance, to make people super-functional."
For example, the military is very interested in
having fighter pilots control air
planes just by thinking about it, ac
cording to Shenoy.
Other researchers are hoping
to create artificial vision for certain
blind people by implanting tiny,
laser-powered microchips in the
retina and using wireless video
goggles to feed visual information
to the "eye chip."
While scientists are only begin
ning to tap into the brain's visual
processing system, it is possible
that one day they will produce im
plants that systematically write a
complete visual world.
The danger is that "if someone
taps into that system, they may be

able to control what people see,"
Shenoy said.
Therefore, developments in
neural implantation technologies
raise serious ethical concerns
about clinical safety, as well as the
broader questions regarding limits
of human capability, and the
boundaries between the mind and
the machine.
If neuroscience and engineer
ing continues its pace in decipher
ing the mysteries of the human
brain, creating a "Matrix"-like vir
tual reality may one day leave the
realm of science-fiction.
"The assumption is that we'll al
ways be in control of the chip," said
junior Erin Boyd. "What if the
chip malfunctions? You're not just
interfering with somebody's body,
but with somebody's mind and
personality."
