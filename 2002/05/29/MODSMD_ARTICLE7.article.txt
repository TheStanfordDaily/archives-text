# Ecologist, economist combine efforts

### AMIR ZAMANI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford ecologist Gretchen Daily
and Pulitzer-Prize winningjournalist
Katherine Ellison, '79, combined
their efforts in a new book, "The New
Economy of Nature" to show that
economics and ecology are, in fact,
compatible. The book was released
last month.
Daily and Ellison offer an econom
ic model of supply and demand as a
starting point: As more and more
ecosystems are exhausted, the supply
of ecosystems has decreased, which
has increased their value.
According to Ellison, we have to
maintain and protect our natural re
sources "because they are our greatest
assets in the natural world." Daily and
Ellison view ecosystems as a form of
capital and believe that its benefits can
lx- classified in four distinct categories.

First, ecosystems are a source of
"goods," such as timber and seafood.
Second, they are a source of "life-sup
port services," a phrase Daily uses to
refer to the pollination of crops, the
purification of the water and air and
I lie- mitigation of flooding.
Third, ecosystems provide hu
mans with "life-fulfilling services" in
that they are a source of intellectual
stimulation and fascination, particu
larly in the tourism industry. Lastly,
they preserve "options for individu
als" both in the present and future.
For instance, tropical rain forests are a
potentially invaluable resource in aid
ing the pharmaceutical industry in
combating new diseases.
According to Daily, "the challenge
is to capture the potential value" of
ecosystem capital. Each chapter of the
book examines a different method
which cities and countries have imple
mented to capture this value.

For instance, planners in New
York City decided to invest in its wa
tershed in the Catskill Mountains by
protecting thousands of acres of land
instead of paying for an expensive
new water-filtration plant. Interest
ingly, despite having the largest unfil
tered water system in the country,
New York has some of the best-tasting
water of any city. The final result is
that the people of New York City are
enjoying clean water at the cheapest
possible cost while simultaneously
helping to protect the environment.
Likewise, residents of Napa Valley,
Calif., re-created a huge wetland area
by removing the dams and levees
from the Napa River to restore flcxxl
control services. This decision cost the
people of Napa a half-cent increase in
sales tax, and in return, downtown
Napa has remained dry, tourism has
