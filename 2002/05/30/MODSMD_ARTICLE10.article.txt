# FBI admits missing clues to 9/11

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — FBI
Director Robert Mueller said yes
terday there may have been more
missed clues before the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, and he suggested
for the first time that investigators
might have uncovered the plot if
they had been more diligent about
pursuing leads.
"The jury is still out on all of it,"
Mueller said, during a wide rang
ing, two-hour presentation at FBI
headquarters. "Looking at it right
now, I can't say for sure it would
not have, that there wasn't a possi
bility that we could have come
across some lead that would have
led us to the hijackers."
Mueller's remarks came after
his announcement of a broad reor
ganization of the nation's premier
law enforcement agency —
changes at least partly in response

to criticism of the FBI after the at
tacks. The director is moving hun
dreds of agents, mostly from drug
investigations, to focus on terror
ism and prevent future attacks.
The FBl's new marching or
ders will focus on terrorists, spies
and hackers, in that order.
Mueller's statement on clues
represented the first time any se
nior official in the Bush adminis
tration has allowed that countert
errorism investigators might have
detected and averted the Sept. 11
hijackings if they had recognized
what they were collecting. That
question is the focus of a congres
sional inquiry, and is almost cer
tain to come up next week during
Judiciary Committee hearings on
the FBl's reorganization plans.
"Putting all the pieces together,
who is to say?" Mueller said,

though he also noted that those
pieces amounted to "snippets in a
veritable river of information."
Mueller took over as FBI director
just days before Sept. 11.
Attorney General John
Ashcroft said the time had come to
change the "structure, ctfiture and
mission" of the agency.
President Bush has bristled
over suggestions that the govern
ment knew enough to avert the at
tacks. "Had I known that the
enemy was going to use airplanes
to kill on that fateful morning, I
would have done everything in my
power to protect the American
people," Bush said earlier this
month.
Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-
Wis., chairman of the Flouse Judi
ciary Committee, praised the reor
ganization plan.
