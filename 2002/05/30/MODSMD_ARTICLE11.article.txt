# Bush helps preserve Everglades

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” President Bush anted
up $235 million in federal funds yesterday to shel
ter Florida's Everglades and beaches from oil and
gas drilling, an environmental deal that his broth
er, the state's governor, acknowledged as a re-elec
tion boon.
"Florida is known worldwide for its beautiful
coastal waters and (he Everglades. Today we are
acting to preserve both," the president said in a
written statement.
Environmentalists mostly cheered the action but
challenged Bush to apply similar protections to
Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the Rocky
Mountain Front and other areas he wants to open
to energy production.
Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, seeking a second term in
November, escorted to the White House members
of the Collier family, who are to receive $120 mil
lion for their oil and gas drilling rights if Congress
approves the agreement.
The second half of the deal, a $115-million set
tlement buying out nine oil and gas leases to pre
clude drilling in Gulf of Mexico areas closest to Pen
sacola, does not require legislation and will proceed
without Congress, said Interior Secretary Gale

Norton.
Asked outside the White House if his campaign
stands to benefit politically in a state where polls
show 75 percent of Floridians opposed to offshore
drilling, Jeb Bush, the president's younger broth
er, replied:
" I hope so. But more importantly, it is good pub
lic policy and when there's a convergence of good
politics and good public policy, I don't think we
should be ashamed about it."
Phil Clapp, president of the National Environ
mental Trust, said the agreement was a "$235 mil
lion campaign contribution to the Re-Elect Jeb
Bush Committee, courtesy of U.S. taxpayers."
Florida, decisive in the 2000 presidential cam
paign, is also critical to any re-election plans Presi
dent Bush has for 2004.
Using the Everglades' nickname, Rep. Mark
Foley, R-Fla., heralded the deal as the most signifi
cant single act by any president to preserve the
Florida wetlands. "The River of Grass is now Bush
country," Foley said.
Jeb Bush also addressed the apparent discrep
ancy between the president's push to open the
Alaskan refuge to oil drilling.
