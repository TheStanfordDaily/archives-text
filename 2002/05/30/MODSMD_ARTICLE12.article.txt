## The 						Stanford Daily Protesters should attempt alternative methods 
### 
Published Since 1891

The Coalition for Labor Justice has
spearheaded a protest to increase
the wages and benefits of Bon Ap
petit employees, who currently
receive less than directly hired Stanford
workers. We support their goals and their
belief of equal pay for equal work. Howev
er, we believe the protesters' direct appeals
to the President for change are misguided,
as they should be simultaneously lobbying
Bon Appetit company management. Fur
ther, we wish these groups would attempt
educating the Stanford community about
living wages to help their cause gain mo
mentum on campus.
Because Bon Appetit is an independent
company, the only response the University

can have to the wage negotiation process is
to dissolve its contract with Bon Appetit,
leading to the unemployment of Bon Ap
petit workers. Students involved in the
protest have stated that they "want [Presi
dent] Hennessy to give equal pay to all
workers." Some protesters also held a can
dlelight vigil outside of Lou Henry Hoover
house Tuesday night. We think both of
these actions are misdirected and, unless
the dissolution of Bon Appetit is the goal of
the protest, undermine the protest's cause.
Asking the President to provide an ulti
matum of contract dissolution if Bon Ap
petit wages do not equal Stanford wages is
not the most effective way to bring about
change. Perhaps students feel that as Uni

versity members, it is easier to redress the
administration than to affect change in Bon
Appetit. But considering yesterday's Bon
Appetit statement that, if workers strike,
they will be fired, protestors should simul
taneously approach the Bon Appetit man
agement if they hope for change.
Protesters also complain about apathy
from the general student body regarding
the living wage cause. We believe that edu
cation and utilizing campus resources for
teach-ins and a lecture series would vastly
improve student support of protests. Free
speech and protests are important, espe
cially at an academic institution like Stan
ford, but the effective execution of a protest
is also essential to promote its underlying

cause. In the past, student protesters' one
track tactics have compromised their causes
and made the University administration
wary of student protests in general.
We applaud efforts like those taken by
the Stanford African Students Alliance,
who offered teach-ins to the campus com
munity and silently protested F. W. de
Klerk's lecture sponsored by the ASSU
Speakers Bureau. We think similar educa
tional approaches would garner more sup
port for the living wage cause, while the
current mode of operation alienates many
students from joining in protests. Offering
teach-ins, department-sponsored lectures,
and increasing faculty support would be
good first steps.
