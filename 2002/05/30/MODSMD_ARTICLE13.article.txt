# CANNONBALL COMING
## Ozzy's busty company 
### 
From bottles of booze to big boo
bies, reality TV is changing, boys.
God, help us. Fresh off the success
of MTV's fantastic show chroni
cling the mumbling life and stuttering
times of the ancient alcoholic shock-rock
er, Ozzy Osbourne, "E! Television" is
bringing us a show that follows around the
classiest actress-model of our time.
Of course, that's Anna Nicole Smith â€”
the 34-year-old former Playmate of the
Year, star of such gems of the silver screen
as "Naked Gun 33 1/3" and the Hudsuck
er Proxy and the noted widow of 89-year
old wheelchair-bound billionaire J.
Howard Marshall.
1 he series reportedly will follow around
our busty beauty, her 18-year-old son, her
lawyer and her assistant as they navigate

the minefield that is Los
Angeles on $50,000 a day.
According to CNN, it'll
start showing in late July
or early August.
Now, as Stanford's of
fitial celebrity reality
show reviewer, I must say
that Anna won't be quite
as popular as Ozzy. At the

end of the day, the Prince of Darkness is a
lovable old coot who earns your sympathy.
There's a lot of love in the Osbourne
house, no matter how many times they
drop the f-bomb. But it's pretty hard to re
ally feel much fora woman who married a
man hooked up to an oxygen machine just
so she could light his heirs for millions of
dollars after he died.
But, if you like watching a good train
wreck as much as 1 do, you'll watch Anna
this summer. Why? lake one good look at
her bio.
According to CelebrityCD.com, a terrif
ic little site that has refreshingly disregard
ed the annoying strictures of the English
language, the former Vickie Lynn Hogan
was doing well as a 1 louston-area stripper
with a "bounteously proportioned" ass,
"But she still wasn't good looking to be
come a well-known person. So Anna gave
fate a helping by using her body to make
some quick money and to become star.
She had several face operation and her
bosom was tilled up with silicon."[sic]
The slight nips and tucks moved her
from a 33 A to a 35 1)1), giving her that nat
ural, girl-next-door quality she's so famous
for. She then started getting modeling work
in 1989, which led to more offers. Finally, a
breakthrough. "She was several times on
the frontage of Playboy and in 1993 she was
the Playmate of the Year." | sic ]
From there, her career took off . Cast in
1993's Playboy's Video Centerfold, Anna

moved onto the 1993 and 1994 Video
Playmate Calendar, playing herself. That
led to a star turn as Za /a in the Hudsuck
er Proxy, followed by a stunningly tender
portrayal of hermaphrodite Tanya Peters
in"The Naked Gun 33 1/3 - The Final In
sult". Then came a string of projects, in
cluding 1995's Playboy - The Best of Anna
Nicole Smith, in which she played herself,
and two critically acclaimed thrillers - "To
the Limit" and "Skyscraper". Alter those
exploded at the box-office, she moved to
Edenguest: Anna Nicole Smith, Anna
Nicole Smith Exposed and Playboy - Play
males of the Year: The 90's.
Quite a busy bee. That's a commitment
to the craft that rivals Glenn Close, Meryl
Streep, Sally Field and Carmen Electra. In
fact, next week, Anna will be appearing on
Bravo's "Inside the Actor's Studio," when
James Lipton will painfully, ponderously
ask her, "What profession. . .would you. .
not. . .like ... to participate . . . in?" and
"What. . .is . . .your favorite . . .curse .. .
word?"
(In case you're wondering, a quick pe
rusal of the Bravo website shows that
celebrities, like the Osbournes, over
whelmingly love to say "P*k." Except Sissy
Spacek. Always a rebel, her favorite swear
word is "barbiturate." Wild.)
While Anna seems fit for the job, other
proposed Ozzy-knock-offs have made me
cringe.
Rap impresario P. Diddy tracked down
MTV to try and get in on the action. I'm
not really following this one. He's got a
successful career, a line of hot women wait
ing to cuddle, no discernible speech prob
lems or drug dependencies, and a flat
chest. Sure, he's an embarrassment to hip
hop. But the entertainment value of this
show would be . . .where?
Now, if Biggie were back in the picture
to act as Puffy's fat, wacky, mumbling
next-door neighbor, and J-Lo came by to
shake her thang, forcing the heartstruck
Diddy to carry out a series of crazy
shenanigans to get her back, then maybe
we'd have a show. We could call it "Diddy
Knows Best."
But as it is, the Puff is out.
Instead, we need real dysfunction for
one of these shows to work.
We need rags-to-riches, we need sili
cone, we need blatant stupidity and dirty
family intrigue.
We need Anna Nicole Smith.
Thank God for "E!"

Anna's insightful interview with l/irry King
hrst night.
