Military-academic link "naive and
insulting"
As a graduate student whose research is
funded by the U.S. Air Force, I have some
problems with Jessica Jenkins' article on
Stanford's relationship with the military
(Campus Viewpoint, Wednesday, "A
hunger for peace: questioning the mili
tary-academic complex").
The implication that some professors
and graduate students may do "involun
tary" research for the military and ". . .
don't realize the potentially destructive
implications of their work," is both naive
and insulting. If Ms. Jenkins or The Daily
wants to know how professors and gradu
ate students feel about doing military
funded research, it should ask them.
An uninformed rant is not a good way
to start an "open dialogue" on the issue.

Student-Athlete not an oxymoron
As a member of the Stanford
Women's Varsity Field Hockey team, I
am writing in response to Wednesday's
article, "Athletic-academic relationship
deserves examination."
Gross generalizations and incorrect evi
dence do little to support the weak argu

ment presented in this article. Not only do
student-athletes on this campus make aca
demics their number one priority, but they
also continue to be successful in upholding
a strong commitment to athletic achieve
ment. While I can speak only on behalf of
my own team in arguing against your claim
of mediocrity, we are not the sole example.
Just this year, two members of our team
have received acceptance to graduate schools
— one to the Columbia School of Medicine
and the other to the Stanford School of Edu
cation. Seven members of the squad repre
sent four different campus sororities, and
twelve members of the '01-'O2 sqtiad were
named Academic Ail-Americans. Five
women have staffed positions including peer
health educator, residence tutor, kitchen
manager, vx ial coordinator and house man
ager. We have representatives from the Stan
ford in- Washington program and the Sum
mer Research (College. Seven team members
have outside jobs, ranging from lifeguarding
and messengeiing, to tutoring and research
assistant positions. And despite your claim,
only two members of our team currently live
together.
As student-athletes, we have not only
become active in campus life, we have
done so without sacrificing our commit
ment to academics or athletics.

ASSU rules questioned
As a graduate student, I should really
not care less about what happens in the
ASSU's Undergraduate Senate. Howev
er, a recent incident involving a newly
elected senator as well as occasional pe
rusals of the ASSU's newsgroup have
pointed out a section in the ASSU consti
tution that I find somewhat disturbing.
The section in question involves the re
moval of members from the Undergradu
ate Senate (Article 11, Section .S.J). Ac
cording to the constitution, a member can
be removed by either a vote from the un
dergraduate population or by a two-thirds
(majority?) vote from the Undergraduate
Senate. Some grounds tor removal are
listed, including a consistent failure to at
tend meetings. However, what disturbs
me is that the grounds for dismissal start
with the phrase "shall include, but not be
limited to."
While this is perfectly fine for when stu
dents want to recall a member, this phrase
should not apply to the removal of a mem
ber by other members. Otherwise, any
senators expressing or defending a mi
nority opinion could conceivably be re
moved by a two-thirds majority. All of the
grounds allowing for the expulsion of a
member by fellow members need to be ex
