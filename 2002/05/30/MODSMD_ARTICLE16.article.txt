## Sunshine Daydream: reviving a favorite Frost tradition 
### JENNY QUIROZ ANDREW GUSTIN GUEST COLUMNISTS 
I his Sunday, June 2, a largely forgot
ten Stanford tradition will be resurrected.
Led by a founding member of the Grateful
Dead, Phil Lesh and Friends will play an
afternoon show at Frost Amphitheater.
At one time, rock concert?, at l iost were
a regular part of Stanford life. A beautiful
outdoor theater that many Stanford stu
dents have never even set loot in, Frost was
once one oft he most adored venues 011 the
West Coast concert circuit.
Between 1982 and 1989, the Stanford
Concert Network and legendary rock pro

moter Bill Crahain Presents produced 14
Grateful Dead shows at Frost. Lines of
Stanford students waiting for tickets to the
highly-anticipated shows would wind
around the Tresiddei parking lot and
stretch through White Plaza.
In addition to the Dead, Frost has
played host to such legendary ads as Kric
Clapton, Miles Davis, Santana, |oan Baez.
the Band and 8.8. King.
But problems at some shows threatened
this tradition. In July 1971, the administra
tion imposed a moratorium 011 rock con
certs in Frost. I his decision followed an
eruption of violence between a motorcycle
gang, polite and audience members at a
Cold Blood - Flvin Bishop show.

Nearly two decades later, in 1989, the
administration banned the Grateful Dead
from returning to Frost. Fens of thousands
of Deadheads, many without tickets to the
sold-out shows, flocked to Stanford each
year. I hey camped out in classrooms at
the (Graduate School of Business and gen
erally caused a ruckus around campus.
We pined the Concert Network with
the vision of reviving the Frost tradition,
while ensuring a safe and secure environ
ment. We have been working on this show
for the last three years, and with tickets
nearly sold out, the dream appears to be
coming true just two weeks before we
graduate.
(letting here, however, has been an up

hill battle. Often we doubted if we could
actually pull it off. Among our greatest
challenges were finding the means to pay
for the show and developing security
plans. We have been lucky enough to work
with a superb staff and our always-avail
able, incredibly devoted advisor, Asst. Di
rector of Student Activities Judith Biller.
At the same time, Phil Lesh's own desire
to return to Frost dramatically helped
make the show a reality. It has long been
one of his favorite places to play music,
and he has been waiting for 12 years for
the chance to return.
In addition, the Grateful Dead's histor
ical ties to Stanford date back considerably
farther than their Frost shows in the

1980s. The band's earliest incarnations ac
tually took shape in Palo Alto in the micl
'60s. Long before their Frost shows, the
Dead played at Tresidder in 1966, as well
as a legendary show at Maples Pavilion on
Feb. 9, 1973.
This Sunday's Frost show is not only a
revival of Stanford tradition, it is a home
coming.
