## Tough field looms at Regionals Eighth-seeded Cardinal opens the NCAA Tournament against three nationally ranked California teams 
### MALCOLM LEVINE STAFF WRITER 
All year long, the No. 9 Cardinal (40-16) has
donned prac tic e t-shirts with the words "Unfinished
Business" on the backs — a phrase undoubtedly in
reference to the program's two consecutive losses in
the National Championship game.
In 2000 Stanford fell 6-5 to Louisiana State in the
finals, and last year Miami handed the Cardinal a 12-
1 defeat.
As the old adage goes, "So close, yet so far away."
However, on Friday, the quest for the holy grail
begins once again, as postseason play gets underway
at Sunken Diamond with the NCAA Regionals.
For the seventh-straight year, the Cardinal is host
ing a regional, a four-team double-elimination tour
nament that sends one team to next weekend's Super
Regionals.
However, this year's draw looks a little different
than those in years past with this regional arguably
being the most difficult that Stanford has ever had to
endure and the most difficult out of all of the eight
brackets this year.
Awarded the No. 8 national seed by the NCAA
tournament selection committee, the Cardinal is .the
host and No. 1 seed of the Palo Alto regional, while
Long Beach State (37-19) is the regional's No. 2 seed,
San Jose State (45-15) is the No. 3 seed, and Cal State-
Fullerton (36-20) is the No. 4 seed.
"We are in one of the toughest, if not the toughest
bracket in the tournament, but at this point of the sea
son all of the teams you are going to be playing are
quality," said head coach Mark Marquess. "We need
to play our best baseball at this time if we hope to win
this Regional."
Fortunately for Marquess, the Cardinal has been
playing some of its best baseball of the year in recent
weeks, after a rough stretch that saw the team drop to
5-6 in conference play.
Winners of its last four Pac-10 games, and 11 of its

last 13, Stanford nearly caught eventual Pac-10
champion USC in the final weekend of the regular
season, finishing just one game behind the Trojans,
in sole possession of second place.
This finish marked the 20th time in the last 22
years that the Cardinal has ended up either first or
second in the conference, but all that gets thrown out
the window when it comes time for tournament play.
One thing that the great regular season finish does
provide for the Cardinal is t he opportunity to play at
home all the way up to the World Series, as is the case
for each of the top eight national seeds.

This plays right into Stanford's hands, as the
friendly confines of Sunken Diamond have truly
been an advantage this season, with the team compil
ing a 24-4 record at home as opposed to a 1 (5-12
record on the road.
Tournament play gets underway on Friday as
Long Beach State takes on San Jose State in the open
er at 3 p.m., while the Cardinal faces Cal State-FuUer
ton at 7 p.m.
This will not be the first time that the Cardinal has

battled the Titans this season, with
the Cardinal taking two of three
games from Fullerton in the sea
son's opening series.
The Cardinal has also faced San
Jose State already this year, as the
two teams split a pair of noncon
ference match-ups, while the Car
dinal has not faced Long Beach
State since 1998 when the Dirtbags
knocked Stanford out of the Palo
Alto Regional.
Friday's match-up could very
well turn out to be an old-fash
ioned pitchers' duel between the
teams' two aces, Cardinal junior
Jeremy Guthrie and Titans sopho
more Wes Littleton.
Guthrie, named Pac-10 Pitcher
of the Year on Wednesday, has
been downright unstoppable in
recent weeks, running his record
to 10-1 while lowering his league
leading ERA to 2.52. Guthrie also
led the Pac-10 in strikeouts (115)

and opposing batting average
(.235), in addition to finishing sec
ond in wins and innings pitched
(121.1).
The hard-throwing righthander
comes into the weekend riding a
streak of 19 straight scoreless in
nings, but his likely opponent is no
slouch either. Littleton finished 9-4
with a 2.31 ERA on the year.
Guthrie was not the only mem
ber of the Cardinal to receive per
sonal accolades on Wednesday, as
five other members of the team
earned All-Pac-1() honors.
Senior second baseman Chris
O'Riordan and sophomore out
fielders Sam Fuld and Carlos
Quentin were all named to the
All-Pac-10 team for the second
time in as many yetfrs, while ju
nior catcher Ryan Garko and ju
nior designated hitter Jason
Cooper each picked up their first
league honors.

teams from Friday will meet at 11

the two winners will play at 3 p.m.

for the right to go to the Regional
Championship game on Sunday.
All year long, the No. 9 Cardinal (40-16) has
donned prac tic e t-shirts with the words "Unfinished
Business" on the backs — a phrase undoubtedly in
reference to the program's two consecutive losses in
the National Championship game.
In 2000 Stanford fell 6-5 to Louisiana State in the
finals, and last year Miami handed the Cardinal a 12-
1 defeat.
As the old adage goes, "So close, yet so far away."
However, on Friday, the quest for the holy grail
begins once again, as postseason play gets underway
at Sunken Diamond with the NCAA Regionals.
For the seventh-straight year, the Cardinal is host
ing a regional, a four-team double-elimination tour
nament that sends one team to next weekend's Super
Regionals.
However, this year's draw looks a little different
than those in years past with this regional arguably
being the most difficult that Stanford has ever had to
endure and the most difficult out of all of the eight
brackets this year.
Awarded the No. 8 national seed by the NCAA
tournament selection committee, the Cardinal is .the
host and No. 1 seed of the Palo Alto regional, while
Long Beach State (37-19) is the regional's No. 2 seed,
San Jose State (45-15) is the No. 3 seed, and Cal State-
Fullerton (36-20) is the No. 4 seed.
"We are in one of the toughest, if not the toughest
bracket in the tournament, but at this point of the sea
son all of the teams you are going to be playing are
quality," said head coach Mark Marquess. "We need
to play our best baseball at this time if we hope to win
this Regional."
Fortunately for Marquess, the Cardinal has been
playing some of its best baseball of the year in recent
weeks, after a rough stretch that saw the team drop to
5-6 in conference play.
Winners of its last four Pac-10 games, and 11 of its

last 13, Stanford nearly caught eventual Pac-10
champion USC in the final weekend of the regular
season, finishing just one game behind the Trojans,
in sole possession of second place.
This finish marked the 20th time in the last 22
years that the Cardinal has ended up either first or
second in the conference, but all that gets thrown out
the window when it comes time for tournament play.
One thing that the great regular season finish does
provide for the Cardinal is t he opportunity to play at
home all the way up to the World Series, as is the case
for each of the top eight national seeds.

This plays right into Stanford's hands, as the
friendly confines of Sunken Diamond have truly
been an advantage this season, with the team compil
ing a 24-4 record at home as opposed to a 1 (5-12
record on the road.
Tournament play gets underway on Friday as

battled the Titans this season, with
the Cardinal taking two of three
games from Fullerton in the sea
son's opening series.
The Cardinal has also faced San
Jose State already this year, as the
two teams split a pair of noncon
ference match-ups, while the Car
dinal has not faced Long Beach
State since 1998 when the Dirtbags
knocked Stanford out of the Palo
Alto Regional.
Friday's match-up could very
well turn out to be an old-fash
ioned pitchers' duel between the
teams' two aces, Cardinal junior
Jeremy Guthrie and Titans sopho
more Wes Littleton.
Guthrie, named Pac-10 Pitcher
of the Year on Wednesday, has
been downright unstoppable in
recent weeks, running his record
to 10-1 while lowering his league
leading ERA to 2.52. Guthrie also
led the Pac-10 in strikeouts (115)

and opposing batting average
(.235), in addition to finishing sec
ond in wins and innings pitched
(121.1).
The hard-throwing righthander
comes into the weekend riding a
streak of 19 straight scoreless in
nings, but his likely opponent is no
slouch either. Littleton finished 9-4
with a 2.31 ERA on the year.
Guthrie was not the only mem
ber of the Cardinal to receive per
sonal accolades on Wednesday, as
five other members of the team
earned All-Pac-1() honors.

O'Riordan and sophomore out
