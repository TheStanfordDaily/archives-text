# Women hope Indy brings checkered flag
## Stanford crew heads to Indianapolis for premiere in NCAA Championships 
### SCOTT ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
Less than one week removed from a
controversial finish at the Indianapolis
500, Indiana's capital still has that rac
ing feeling.
This weekend, Indianapolis will
play host to the NCAA Division I Na
tional Women's Rowing Champi
onships and, for the first time ever,
Stanford is invited to the party.
Sixth-ranked Stanford earned an
invitation to compete in the twelve
team field following an impressive reg
ular season that included wins over the
under-23 British National team, Cali
fornia and USC.
After finishing fourth at the Pacific
10 Championships, the Stanford
women were unsure whether or not

they would receive a bid. The Cardinal
could only hope its success thus far
would not be overlooked.
Luckily, when the NCAA selection
committee announced the field last
Tuesday, Stanford was in. The NCAA
selected one team from each region
and seven, including the Cardinal,
at-large.
Preliminary heats begin tomorrow
on Eagle Creek Reservoir and the fi
nals will be held Sunday morning.
Each team will field two boats of
eight and one boat of four rowers. In
addition to the 12 teams invited, four
other schools earned at-large bids to
race one eight-women boat.
Washington edged out Brown and
Michigan in last year's varsity-eight
Grand Final, held in Gainesville, Ga.,
to clinch the team points title.
Washington was the team runner
up in 2000 and team national champi
ons in 1998 and 1997.
While Washington has been a title
contender for several decades, winning
seven-of-eight National Champi
onships from 1981 to 1988, this year's

field is testament to the lact that nu
merous West coast schools are becom
ing more competitive on a national
scale.
Besides Stanford, which finished
fifth in the regular season Pac-10
standings, four other Pac-10 schools
will he represented. Washington
State and USC each earned at-large
varsity-eight bids, while perennial
powers Cal and top-ranked Washing
ton received team bids.
Washington State will be making its*
first appearance since 199(5.
Five schools from the Ivy League
will also compete, as Yale, Princeton,
Brown and Harvard received team
bids and Cornell an at-large eight.
Michigan, Michigan State, Syracuse
and Ohio State round out the team
field, while Notre Dame also received
its first invitation in school history with
an at-large eight bid.
With undefeated varsity and junior
varsity eights, Washington and Brown
are arguably the team favorites head
ing into the weekend.
Meanwhile, the men's crew team be

gins competition this morning at the
IRA Championships in Camden, N.J.
Over 60 colleges and universities will
compete in the three-day competition,
the oldest collegiate rowing champi
onship in the country.
Preliminary and semifinal heats will
be held today and tomorrow. The
championship finals will begin Satur
day morning.
Stanford is coming off its second
consecutive fourth-place finish at the
Pac-10 Championships, behind Wash
ington, Cal and Oregon State, three of
the top eight teams in the nation.
In its first heat today, the men's var
sity eight will row alongside defending
IRA Champion Cal, Marietta, Brown,
Navy and Colgate.
At last year's IRA championships,
the men's varsity eight finished sixth in
the Petite Final and Stanford finished
fifth in the open-four Grand Final. The
team has made great strides since then,
returning all rowers from the varsity
eight boat that earned a 12th place na-
tional finish and putting together
one of the greatest seasons in
school history.
The Cardinal began its spring
season with convincing victories
over Santa Clara and Sacramento
State. One of the highlights from
the men's successful season came a
week later as the Cardinal placed
its varsity, junior varsity and fresh
man eight boats in the Grand Fi
nals at the San Diego Crew Classic.
Cal, Washington and Yale, among
other highly regarded crew teams,
competed at the event.
The Cardinal also defeated
UCLA and finished second at the
Windeinere Cup in Seattle.
As Cal and Washington remain

the teams from the West that draw
the most attention nationally,
Stanford crew will look to surprise
some people this weekend in New
Jersey and Indiana alike.
Regardless of how both teams

fare in the coming days, there is no
discounting the unprecedented
success the Cardinal has achieved
this season. Some icing on the
cake, however, would make finals
week that much more bearable.

sity eight will row alongside defending
IRA Champion Cal, Marietta, Brown,
Navy and Colgate.
At last year's IRA championships,
the men's varsity eight finished sixth in
the Petite Final and Stanford finished
fifth in the open-four Grand Final. The
team has made great strides since then,
returning all rowers from the varsity
eight boat that earned a 12th place na-
tional finish and putting together
one of the greatest seasons in
school history.
The Cardinal began its spring
season with convincing victories
over Santa Clara and Sacramento
State. One of the highlights from
the men's successful season came a
week later as the Cardinal placed
its varsity, junior varsity and fresh
man eight boats in the Grand Fi
nals at the San Diego Crew Classic.
Cal, Washington and Yale, among
other highly regarded crew teams,
competed at the event.
The Cardinal also defeated
UCLA and finished second at the
Windeinere Cup in Seattle.
As Cal and Washington remain

the teams from the West that draw
the most attention nationally,
Stanford crew will look to surprise
some people this weekend in New
Jersey and Indiana alike.
Regardless of how both teams

fare in the coming days, there is no
discounting the unprecedented
success the Cardinal has achieved
this season. Some icing on the
cake, however, would make finals
week that much more bearable.
