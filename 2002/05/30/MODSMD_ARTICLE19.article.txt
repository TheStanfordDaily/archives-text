# The 						Three Capitals of Sports Hell

### 
It's a well known fact that certain cities are just in
nately less desirable locations than others, and
nothing can be done to change this fact. No one
wants to spend Spring Break in l'rovo, Utah.
No one wants to pass an exhilarating summer in
Topeka, Kansas.
But why is it that certain cities, both the desirable
and undesirable alike, are just innately cursed when
it comes to their professional sports franchises?
There are a number of cities whose teams have
been perennially horrid performers during the en
tirety of my life on this earth with little hopes of
changing this trend anytime in the near future.
Take Milwaukee as a case in point. The Bucks and
the Brewers are to professional sports what dietitians
are to Milwaukeeans: seldom effective and mostly
overlooked.
l his year has proved especially painful for Mil-

waukee, as the Bucks recently com
pleted one of the worst collapses in
NBA history and missed the play
offs on the final day of the season,
despite being just one game from
the NBA finals the year before.
And the Brewers are holding up
their end of the deal as well, proving
yet again that, although it seemed
like a good idea at the time, hiring a

bunch of badly trained cricket players to masquerade
as a professional team just does not win games.
One could argue that the Packers should be
clumped into this group of Wisconsinizans (what do
yon call someone from Wisconsin other than "obese"
or "the guy with the funny accent" anyway?), but I
think that even cheeseheads would have more digni
ty than to allow themselves to be put into the same cat
egory as Bud Selig.
And one shouldn't overlook Kansas City's contri
butions to the unabashedly wretched sports cities of
North America. The Chiefs, despite having one of the
most dominating defenses throughout the early '90s,
never had any semblance of an offense to comple
ment Derrick Thomas and company (do you remem
ber Christian Okoye? You shouldn't).
So despite coming close on so many occasions, the
Chiefs let the '90s slip by without any spectacular
achievements of note, and now seem doomed to
mediocrity for many years to come.
But the one good thing that the Chiefs can claim is
that at least they have outperformed the Royals dur
ing that period. Now, I'm told that there was some
guy by t he name of George Brett who was pretty good
at one point or another, but by my lifeline, that is an
cient history. Since 1985, the Royals have been the de
finition of mediocrity and underachievement, with
no sign of improvement in the near future.
While these may represent prominent examples
of sporting futility, Cleveland might just be the
worst case in history. The city has been so bad that
its football team decided to pack up and move to
Baltimore — where it almost immediately won a
Super Bowl, a movie was made mocking the impo
tence of its baseball team (Major League was per
haps the greatest sports movie of all time, along with
Rocky and Rocky IV), and I'm pretty sure they
stopped playing basketball in Cleveland after
Michael Jordan hit that famous game-ending shot
over Craig Ehlo.
But these cities should not despair for long. Parity is
at hand. Watching the Nets, Celtics, and Kings still play
ing ball in late May should prove without a doubt that


Ryan Stewart
even for the most putrid of sporting
venues, hope cannot be far away.
Unless, of course, you're rely
ing on Bud Selig's baseball. Then
you might as well move to Milwau
kee, load up on the brew and
bratwurst, and just hope that the
Packers' don't mind sharing their
success with others.

Ryan Stewart is a junior majoring in
economics, and he is ecstatic that the
Dallas Mavericks are finally con
tenders again. He can be reached at
