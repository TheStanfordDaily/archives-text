Seven NFCA All-American
awards. Three NFCA All-American
Scholar Athlete awards. Two Acade
mic All-Americans. Three N F( LA
National Player of the Week awards.
Eleven All-Pacific 10 Conference
team awards. One National Team
member. The first Cardinal trip to
the College World Series. A total of
182 victories. Three seniors pursu
ing graduate degrees this fall. Four
irreplaceable athletes.
This is a sample of the awards,
achievements, and endeavors of the
Stanford softball senior class.
First baseman Sarah Beeson,
tight fielder Jessica Draemel, cen
ter fielder Jessica Mendoza and
shortstop Robin Walker form the
class that many describe as the best
in Cardinal softball history.
"They are the class that brought
Stanford to another level," said ju
nior left fielder Cassi Brangham.
"They helped make us the team

I hat we are â€” a top-10 team, a na
tional contender."
Three of these four seniors
began their Cardinal Softball careers
on a field absent from the Stanford
map, with a team goal of a .500 sea
son and a head coach only in his sec
ond year at the helm. Today these
same students, with the integral ad
dition of Draemel as a junior trans
fer, practice in a stunning stadium,
boast four consecutive berths to
postseason play and have Stanford
Softball's first-ever trip to the College
World Series under their belts.
These athletes' accomplishments
also extend to the classroom.
"They epitomize what our pro
gram is about," Brangham said.
"Excellent softball players who are
also focused on their [academics]."
Their Stanford achievements
have helped to create the futures
these seniors will Ix-gin this fall.
Walker's outspoken leadership
and commitment over these four
years (she holds the Stanford career
record for most games played) will
aid her as she enters the competitive

realm of law school at UC-Davis.
While Walker sees her future in
the court room, Beeson plans on
trading in her I xmisville Slugger for
a stethoscope at the Washington
University, Saint Louis Medical
School, ranked third nationally by
U.S. News and World Report.
Beeson leaves the human biolo
gy department at Stanford after
Commencement, but Mendoza will
follow her passion for education

here on the Farm and complete her
co-terminal master's degree.
Draemel shares Mendoza's inter
est in education and will work on
academic advising programs for
student athletes at Stanford this
summer, with the hope of attending
graduate school in the near future.
Softball offers nothing in lieu of
the WNBA draft or LPGA tour,
but that won't force Beeson and
Mendoza to retire just yet. Both
left yesterday for the USA Nation
al Team Training Camp in ('hula
Vista for the second year in a row.
Mendoza is a returning member
of the National team and Beeson
hopes to join her on the journey to
the 2004 Summer Olympics.
"1 think we are really going to
miss the seniors' leadership," said
junior pitcher Dana Sorensen.
" They are each a leader in a differ
ent way."
Although their immense skill
translates automatically into leader
