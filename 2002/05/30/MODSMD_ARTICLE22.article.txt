In case lectures and problem sets have blurred
your view of the real world, here's a quick re
minder: the Lakers play Friday in a must-win
Game 6.
You should root against them.
A Laker loss means not having to watch Shaq

squirt champagne on Rick Fox. It
means not hearing Phil Jackson
compared to Carl von Clausewitz
for at least four months. It means
an end to the distraction of the
NBA playoffs, since everyone
knows those games back Fast are
merely a consolation bracket.
If Los Angeles falls Friday, you
can mentally give the Kings a well
deserved title and free your mind

for more important things, such as finals, summer
internships and the World Cup.
You should also root against the Lakers — vio
lently, passionately, as if you were raised in the
Sacramento suburbs and spent high school idoliz
ing Vlade Divac — because Kobe and the Gang ru
ined my senior year.
Born and raised in Oregon, I grew up adoring
the Portland Trail Blazers, the state's only major
league team in any sport. Unless you really were
born in suburban Sacramento, you don't under
stand this devotion.
Think of concentrating the whole Bay Area's fan
power into the Raiders. Think of reading about
nothing but the Raiders in your sports pages for 10
months of the year. Think of Rich Gannon and Tim
Brown recording a rap song come playoff time.
Think of every major radio station in the area play
ing that song, say, 15 times an hour.
Now you understand why 65-year-old women
call Portland talk shows and'complain that Rasheed
Wallace is "a nice, misunderstood young man."
All my life, the Blazers have tortured me. Every

year, they make the playoffs. Twice they've made
the Finals. Always, they blow it.
Then, in the spring of 2000, my senior year at
Stanford, Portland magically pushed the hated
Lakers to a Game 7 in the Western Conference Fi
nals. Even then, everyone knew the winner would
take the NBA title. The Fast was weak. Filings
haven't changed much since 1 was your age.
I lived in Suites, with something like 342
Laker-crazy roommates. We all piled in front of
our $150 Daewoo television (a September special
at Fry's) and watched the Blazers build a 15-point
fourth-quarter lead. Beer flowed. 1 cheered.
They sulked.
And of course, the Blazers blew it. Couldn't buy
a basket, couldn't stop anyone wearing purple and
yellow. Kobe lobbed to Shaq. Shaq lobbed to Kobe.
A dynasty was born.
I cried for days. I slapped a title page on 150
pages of Con Law notes from sophomore year
and called it my honor's thesis. I wore black to
graduation.
I still have nightmares.
I'm mostly over it now. I moved back to Fort
land, and 1 still root for the Blazers. But lucky for
me, they blew it early this year — losing in the first
round to, well, you guessed it.
Like 1 said, you've got plenty of good reasons to
root for Sacramento tomorrow night. The Kings,
they're the most exciting team in a largely un
watchable league. The Lakers, they're boring, and
Phil von Clausewitz hardly ever uses Mark Madsen
in games.
Me, 1 don't want your pity. Don't root against the
Lakers just because of me.
On second thought, do. Those guys ruined my
senior year.
