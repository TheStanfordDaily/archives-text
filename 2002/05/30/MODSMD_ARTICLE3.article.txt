## 
### MARISA PAVLIK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Bon Appetit will fire and per
manently replace any workers who
strike, Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Gene Awakuni relayed to a
crowd protesting wage disparity
between the directly hired and
subcontracted workers yesterday.
Yesterday's rally began at noon
with a march from Tresidder to
the Faculty Club to the Main
Quad, where approximately 50
students pitched tents Monday
night and began a "sleepout for
labor justice."
Heading the protest is the
Coalition Tor Labor Justice, partly
composed of the Stanford chapter
of the National Association lor the
Adavancement of Colored People
and the Stanford Community for
Peace and Justice. The group
hopes to encourage University ad
ministrators to influence the nego
tiations between Bon Appetit and
Service Employees International
Union Local 715.
The three-year contract between
the union and Bon Appetit expires
tomorrow. The 50 union employ
ees who work at the restaurants at
Tresidder Union and the Graduate
School of Business are considering
a strike if they do not get improve
ments in their wages and benefits.
Junior Meghana Roddy, co-co
ordinator of the coalition, said Bon
Appetit's warning was a "very hos
tile and aggressive threat that
pushed us to another level of in
tensity and commitment."
At Tuesday's meeting between
the union and Bon Appetit man
agement, some workers said they
felt insulted by the offer of a 25-
cent raise and were inclined to
wards a strike. But the threat yes
terday changed the atmosphere,
sophomore Leticia Ramirez said.
"Striking is still an option, but that

threat has really changed the dy
namic [for the workers] knowing
that they could lose their jobs."
"We do not want anyone to lose
their jobs," Ramirez said.
Junior Anna Sale, a member of
the coalition, cited Bon Appetit as
an example of how subcontracting
undercuts wages. "The starting
wages are nearly two dollars apart
for doing the same work," she said.
Currently, minimum wage for
Bon Appetit workers is $8.50 per
hour. Stanford dining services em

ployees start at $ 10.35.
"Bon Appetit is paying workers
poverty wages," Redely said. "The
University needs to uphold a cer
tain labor standard and use their
influence to ensure that Bon Ap
petit workers receive equal wages
for equal work."
The University maintains its re
fusal to get involved in the Bon Ap
petit labor negotiations. Awakuni
has met with Bon Appetit manage
ment, reminding them that the
University recently adopted a liv

ing wage policy of $10.10 an hour
with benefits, and $11.35 without.
Protest organizers argue that
this action is not sufficient and say
they will continue the sleepout in
definitely.
"Not intervening is a statement
in itself not in support of workers,"
Sale said. "The University needs to
accept that it does have responsi
bility for workers on campus."
Sale said the protest "has been a

success getting administrators to
think about the role Ron Appetit
plays and putting pressure on
them. VVe have more and more
people coming out to join us."
Reddy said she is heartened by
the news that Stanford officials are
in discussion with Harvard offi
cials about their new campus labor
policy calling for parity in wages
and benefits between directly
hired and subcontracted workers.
"We're very excited," Reddy said.
"It shows that Stanford does really
want to help workers as much as
they can."
"Stanford has the choice,"
Reddy said. "Stanford chooses
which vendor comes on campus; it
has the power to show what values
Stanford upholds."
