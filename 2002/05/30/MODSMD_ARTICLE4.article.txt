## Hit movies, student-produced shows featured on channel 
### HELEN CHENG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For many Stanford students,
entertainment is a vital part of
college life. Unfortunately, the
quest to find it is often an ex
pensive one. Thanks to Stan
ford Cardinal Broadcasting
Network, classics like "Pulp Fic
tion," "The Godfather," "Pretty
Woman" and "Legally Blonde"
no longer require rental fees or
cable subscriptions.
SCBN is Stanford's own stu
dent-run television station,
l his underused resource fea
tures a line-up of hit movies
every day, as well as access to
the College Television Network
and student-produced shows.
Students can catch movies
like "The Thomas Crowne Af
fair," "Backdraft," "Schindler's
List," "Jerry Maguire" and
"Bridget Jones' Diary" for free
in the afternoons, from 1 p.m.
to 5 p.m., and at night from 7
p.m. to 3 a.m.
Current student-produced
shows include SCBN News,
which features daily Stanford
and off-campus news; "The
Lincoln Report," a sketch com
edy inspired by "Saturday
Night Live" and "Kids in the
Hall;" and "Dyeria," a creative
exploration into one man's life.
" Fhe line-up of movies on
SCBN is great," sophomore

Chris Edstrom said. "It rivals
that of a premium movie chan
nel, hut unfortunately 1 think
that not many students know
about or utilize SCBN's capabil
ities."
SCBN's station manager,
senior Ilya Lyashevsky, em
phasizes how student-run
shows deal with issues that are
closer to home. "It's not only
that the shows themselves are
well-made and fun to watch,
but rather that students don't
just see some faraway MTV
studio or a Hollywood set, but
their own fellow Stanford stu
dents in recognizable settings,"
lie said.
In addition, these shows
allow the opportunity for Stan
ford students to participate in
the production process or even
star in front of the camera.
"It's the fascination of seeing
your own world on television, a
fascination which we hope will
grow and bear fruit in the form
of more student shows," Lya
shevsky said.
Past programming has in
cluded "The Oval," a sketch
comedy show; "Straight No
Chaser," a student produced
sitcom; and "Night Chat,"a late
night talk show. Other show
ideas have ranged from "Stan
ford Cribs," "Stanford Blind
Date" and various talk pro
grams to serials and soap op
eras.
SCBN also organizes a mo
bile film unit, a crew of experi
enced members who video
tape campus events. In addition
to training its members in post
production and filming tech
niques, SCBN boasts an equip
ment stockpile that includes
cameras, tripods, microphones,
lighting kits, editing worksta
tions, and the advantages of its
own studio set.
" fhe bottom line is that we be
lieve the greatest service SCBN
can provide is to offer television to
students as a creative outlet," Lya
shevsky said.
SCBN plans to increase and
continue fostering student pro
duction, as well as boost student
awareness of the television sta
tion, its purpose, and its re
sources. With the creation of a
new organizational infrastructure

and guidelines, SCBN hopes to
welcome many new members
next year.
These goals have been aug
mented by the fact that SCBN was
granted special fee funding after
it didn't pass the ballot during the
ASSU elections. SCBN, which
needs the $15,000 special fee to
provide students with newly re
leased movies, was left off the on
line voting ballot. Approximately
850 votes had already been cast
before the error was corrected.
ASSU by-laws state that, "If a
Special Fee request which has
met all Elections Commission
deadlines is left off the ballot,
then the request may be funded
from the Special Buffer Fund by
a 2/3 vote of the Association leg
islative bodies."
As a result, SCBN received its
special fee funding and will con
tinue to build its library and free
services for students next year.
