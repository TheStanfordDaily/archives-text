# Rice draws fire as grad speaker
## 
### SARAH PAPÉ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Controversy and commence
ment speakers have almost be
come synonyms at Stanford.
A group of students is condem
ing the selection of National Secu
rity Adviser Condoleezza Rice as
this year's commencement speak
er because they feel that the poli
tics of Rice, Stanford's provost
from 1993-1999, do not represent
the Stanford community as a
whole.
"My concerns are Rice's policies
and actions, not her personally,"
said senior Becky Blanchard, who
is involved in the group. "I feel
proud to attend a university today
that selected an African-American
woman to be commencement

speaker."
The group hopes to raise
awareness within the Stanford
community and encourage people
to learn about Rice's policies, said
senior Josh Zide
"To me, Rice is not a role
model, nor someone that I feel
should be Stanford's commence
ment speaker, based upon the gulf
between the ideals of the Funda
mental Standard in which I as a
Stanford student take much pride,
and Rite's policies and actions,"
Blanchard said.
Blanchard's statements echo
the group's petition that lists con
troversial actions taken by Rice, in
cluding actions taken by the U.S.
against Afghanistan. Hie list focus
es on her time as provost at Stan
ford, her tenure on the board of di

rectors at Chevron and her cur
rent position in Bush's administra
tion.
The petition will be available in
White Plaza from 11:30 a.m. to
1:30 p.m. for the rest of this week
and next. Zide is also hoping to put
together an open-microphone ses
sion in White Plaza.
"Our goal has been to offer
other members of the Stanford
community who have concerns
about Dr. Rice's selection an op
portunity to participate in raising
awareness about those issues and
joining in solidarity to make a non
disruptive statement at com
mencement to express our con
cerns," Blanchard said.
