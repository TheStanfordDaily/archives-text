# Rice draws fire as grad speaker
## 
### SARAH PAPÉ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Controversy and commence
ment speakers have almost be
come synonyms at Stanford.
A group of students is condem
ing the selection of National Secu
rity Adviser Condoleezza Rice as
this year's commencement speak
er because they feel that the poli
tics of Rice, Stanford's provost
from 1993-1999, do not represent
the Stanford community as a
whole.
"My concerns are Rice's policies
and actions, not her personally,"
said senior Becky Blanchard, who
is involved in the group. "I feel
proud to attend a university today
that selected an African-American
woman to be commencement

speaker."
The group hopes to raise
awareness within the Stanford
community and encourage people
to learn about Rice's policies, said
senior Josh Zide
"To me, Rice is not a role
model, nor someone that I feel
should be Stanford's commence
ment speaker, based upon the gulf
between the ideals of the Funda
mental Standard in which I as a
Stanford student take much pride,
and Rite's policies and actions,"
Blanchard said.
Blanchard's statements echo
the group's petition that lists con
troversial actions taken by Rice, in
cluding actions taken by the U.S.
against Afghanistan. Hie list focus
es on her time as provost at Stan
ford, her tenure on the board of di

rectors at Chevron and her cur
rent position in Bush's administra
tion.
The petition will be available in
White Plaza from 11:30 a.m. to
1:30 p.m. for the rest of this week
and next. Zide is also hoping to put
together an open-microphone ses
sion in White Plaza.
"Our goal has been to offer
other members of the Stanford
community who have concerns
about Dr. Rice's selection an op
portunity to participate in raising
awareness about those issues and
joining in solidarity to make a non
disruptive statement at com
mencement to express our con
cerns," Blanchard said.

dictate in economics defended the
choice of Rice as a speaker.
"We have the honor of hearing
National Security Advisor Con
doleez/a Rice speak," said
Mt Bride. "It is clear that Mr. Zide
disagrees with Ms. Rice's political
views, and more likely her admin
istration's less than submissive na
ture. A difference in political views
is inevitable, hut to tread farther
and impugn Ms. Rice's character
for killing Afghani civilians is intol
erable."
"We are the first Stanford class
to graduate after the tragic events
[that] took place and our world
was re-shaped," said Nicholas Lar
son, one of the senior class presi

dents. "Condi's incredible influ
ence over world events and her po
sition as national security advisor
place her in an excellent position
to share with us her thoughts
about [Sept. 11] and the ever
changing world in front of us."
Zide said he thinks that a com
mencement speaker should be a
role model.
"1 lis or her actions should serve
as an example to us all," he said. "I
support Stanford's Fundamental
Standard as a basic criteria; a Com
mencement speaker should be
someone who shows, such respect
for order, morality, personal
honor, and the rights of others as is
demanded of a good citizen."
Stanford's 111 th Commence
ment will be held on June 16, and
25,000 graduates and family mem
bers are estimated to attend the
ceremonies at Stanford Stadium.

Last year controversy swirled
around the selection of Hewlett-
Packard Corp. Chief Executive
Officer Carly Fiorina as the com
mencement speaker. But contro
versy centered more on the
process by which she was selected.
Fiorina was not on the final list on
nominations given to University
President John Hennessy, and
some were disappointed by the
selection.
In an e-mail written last year to
the senior class with regards to the
selection process Hennessy said he
sought out "a Commencement
speaker whose accomplishments,
contributions and ability to influ
ence the world gave him or her a
distinctive point of view from
which to offer advice about issues
of consequence. As has been tradi
tion, we gave priority to speakers
with a Stanford connection."

honor, and the rights of others as is
demanded of a good citizen."
Stanford's 111 th Commence
ment will be held on June 16, and
25,000 graduates and family mem
bers are estimated to attend the
ceremonies at Stanford Stadium.

Last year controversy swirled
around the selection of Hewlett-
Packard Corp. Chief Executive
Officer Carly Fiorina as the com
mencement speaker. But contro
versy centered more on the
process by which she was selected.
Fiorina was not on the final list on
nominations given to University
President John Hennessy, and
some were disappointed by the
selection.
In an e-mail written last year to
the senior class with regards to the
selection process Hennessy said he
sought out "a Commencement
speaker whose accomplishments,
contributions and ability to influ
ence the world gave him or her a
distinctive point of view from
which to offer advice about issues
of consequence. As has been tradi
tion, we gave priority to speakers
with a Stanford connection."
