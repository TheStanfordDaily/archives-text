A $75 laptop? A $15 futon? A
free car? How can you access such
deals from the comfort of your
dorm room? The answer:
su.market, a newsgroup which al
lows members of the Stanford
community to buy and sell every
thing from furniture to concert
tickets.
A few weeks ago, junior Andrew

Hill used su.market to buy an elec
tric guitar and amp from a gradu
ating senior.
"The guitar / amp package only
cost me $60, which is only a little
more than the amp retails for,"he

don't want, or to get things they do

Macintosh and Unix, including
Outlook, Outlook Express, Pine
and Netscape. Of the over 8,500
newsgroups at Stanford, su.mar
ket is possibly the most popular.

"You'd be surprised at the
number of people who check
su.market regularly. It's strangely
addicting," said junior Patrick
Perry, who identified himself as
one such addict. "In two years of
reading su.market, I have only
bought one thing, but I still check
it twice a day."
There is no newsgroup moni

su.market participants will fre

their computer, there's always
