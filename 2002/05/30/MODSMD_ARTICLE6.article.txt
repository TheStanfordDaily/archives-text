# Su.market offers online community bazaar
## Students buy, sell, trade on Stanford's most popular newsgroup 
### SARAH LUSTBADER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A $75 laptop? A $15 futon? A
free car? How can you access such
deals from the comfort of your
dorm room? The answer:
su.market, a newsgroup which al
lows members of the Stanford
community to buy and sell every
thing from furniture to concert
tickets.
A few weeks ago, junior Andrew

Hill used su.market to buy an elec
tric guitar and amp from a gradu
ating senior.
"The guitar / amp package only
cost me $60, which is only a little
more than the amp retails for,"he
said.
Hill describes "su.market as, "a
convenient place for students, fac
ulty and staff to unload things they
don't want, or to get things they do
want. People sell textbooks, con
cert tickets, musical instruments,
and also advertise moving sales
and available housing and sublets,
among other things.
"Sti.market is like eßay, only
with a bit more security, because
everyone is close by, and you can

see an item before you buy," he
added.
Especially now, as spring quar
ter draws to a close and students
prepare to leave school, they look
to sell or give away unwanted items
on su.market.
A month ago, the newsgroup
was receiving about 40 posts per
day. This week it has been getting
about 75 a day, and on Monday,
115 messages were posted.
Su.market can be run through
various programs on Windows,
Macintosh and Unix, including
Outlook, Outlook Express, Pine
and Netscape. Of the over 8,500
newsgroups at Stanford, su.mar
ket is possibly the most popular.

"You'd be surprised at the
number of people who check
su.market regularly. It's strangely
addicting," said junior Patrick
Perry, who identified himself as
one such addict. "In two years of
reading su.market, I have only
bought one thing, but I still check
it twice a day."
There is no newsgroup moni
tor, but some of the more active
su.market participants will fre
quently respond to posts, accord
ing to Perry.
"If someone ever tries to sell
their computer, there's always
some guy who looks on the Inter
net fora better deal, and then posts
to tell everyone about it."
Junior Brian Quistorff saw en
vironmental benefits in the use of
the newsgroup. "Su.market makes
sure that a lot of unwanted items
don't end up in the dumpster,
which promotes general environ
mental well-being," he said.
"One interesting thing about
su.market is I he amount of useless
junk that people try to unload for
money," Hil said. "For every au
tomobile or cheap electric guitar,
there are three or four potted
plants from somebody's dorm
room for $2, or a broken monitor
for $1, or a desk lamp for $3. Col
lege students love good junk at
low prices."
Perry, too, is often surprised by
the unusual items sold on su.mar

ket. "Remember Rockapella, the
all-male a capella group from the
'Where in the World is Carmen
Sandiego' show? Someone was
selling tickets to their concert on
su.market. I didn't even know

Rockapella had concerts."
Perry stated one final advan
tage to the newsgroup: "Whenev
er you check your e-mail and you
have no new messages, su.market
is always there for you."
