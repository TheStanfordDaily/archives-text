# Police work on alcohol safety
## Officers collaborate with Dean of Students Office, party planners 
### MATT BRICKER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At a school where a party gets
shut down once a quarter and run
ning from cop cars at 3 a.m. on a
Friday night seems like a distant
tin ill, students are often puzzled by
the Stanford Sheriff's role in alco
hol monitoring.
"Of course our job is to enforce
the law," said Police Chief Laura
Wilson. "But our goal isn't to go
out there and arrest students; it's
to make sure that people are se
cure and that general public safety
is upheld."
Many of the University's poli
cies, including those on alcohol,
hinge on student responsibility.
"The mission of the University
is really to encourage students to
look out for one another and to en
able them to make their own choic
es," said Associate Dean of Stu
dents Morris Graves. "They then
have to deal with the conse
quences. It's an extension of the
fundamental standard."
"We want people to drink and
behave responsibly and to look out
for each other," Wilson said. "We
want to maintain balance with the
University's mission of education.
[The police department is] part of
that system in that we are real life
education."
Despite the official attitude to
wards drinking at Stanford, the
police depart ment still takes a very
active role in engaging with the ad
ministration to oversee alcohol-re
latecl incidents.

"Officers are encouraged to
focus their attention on public
safety issues," Wilson said. "In
stead of focusing on one underage
student having a beer in his room,
we are concerned with raging par
ties and people passed out on
lawns — things of that sort."
To achieve this type of watch
fulness, the police department
works directly with the Dean of
Students Office.
"Obviously, when we arrest
someone, the University gets that
notice," Wilson said. "Also, if we
become aware of an unregistered
party, we send a quick e-mail to the
dean of students."
"The police department is one
of the main groups that brings al
cohol misconduct to our atten
tion," Graves said.
The police department will even
work with student party planners to
help avoid potential conflicts. This
is especially true when an issue of
security or privacy is concerned.
"A couple of weeks ago, Mir
rielees had their annual luau
party," Wilson said. "They did
everything 1 ight in terms of plan
ning, but the law students had a
final the next day, and so we
helped them find a new location
for the party. In a case like that, we
work closely with students."
The police department patrols
campus on a regular basis, but on
nights with a lot. of parties more of
ficers are out and about.
"On weekends, we ad just to the
number of parties on campus,"
Wilson said. "We have anywhere
from three to six officers patrolling
campus. And those are sworn offi
cers. We have other public safety
officials as well."
Even though officers routinely
patrol campus, they claim to let on

campus facilities that serve alcohol,
namely the Treehouse and the
Coffee House, monitor their own
underage drinking.
"To a degree we let the Tree
house and the Col lo police them
selves," Wilson said. "If they don't,
they can lose their liquor license,
which is a pretty serious penalty.
That comes through the Alcoholic
Beverage Control, not us."
Even though parties are only shut
down when noise or crowd com
plaints are raised by neighboring res
idents or when a serious incident
takes place, citations are still a reality
on campus — even around the
Treehouse and the Coffee House.
"I used to be really careful
about drinking in public on cam
pus," said an anonymous sopho
more. "Then I got an MIP [Minor
in Possession] outside the CoHo
and since then I have been way
more lax about it. I mean, if I got
an MIP even when I was careful, it
doesn't seem worth it to always
look over my shoulder. Once you
pass the point of getting a citation
there isn't all that much to lose-es
pecially since the chances of get
ting another MIP seem so low."
Even though many students
know someone who has gotten a
citation in a similar way or have
had experiences that seem con
trary to what Wilson and Graves
were saying, the police depart
ment maintains that their primary
concern is not the actual illegality
of underage drinking.
"On any college campus, alco
hol is a concern," Wilson said.
"But it's not the drinking itself that
is the real issue. Instead it is the be
havior — vandalism, fighting,
sexual assault, accidents — associ
ated with alcohol misuse that we
are looking to control."

is especially true when an issue of
security or privacy is concerned.
"A couple of weeks ago, Mir
rielees had their annual luau
party," Wilson said. "They did
everything 1 ight in terms of plan
ning, but the law students had a
final the next day, and so we
helped them find a new location
for the party. In a case like that, we
work closely with students."
The police department patrols
campus on a regular basis, but on
nights with a lot. of parties more of
ficers are out and about.
"On weekends, we ad just to the
number of parties on campus,"
Wilson said. "We have anywhere
from three to six officers patrolling
campus. And those are sworn offi
cers. We have other public safety
officials as well."
Even though officers routinely
patrol campus, they claim to let on

campus facilities that serve alcohol,
namely the Treehouse and the
Coffee House, monitor their own
underage drinking.
"To a degree we let the Tree
house and the Col lo police them
selves," Wilson said. "If they don't,
they can lose their liquor license,
which is a pretty serious penalty.
That comes through the Alcoholic
Beverage Control, not us."
Even though parties are only shut
down when noise or crowd com
plaints are raised by neighboring res
idents or when a serious incident
takes place, citations are still a reality
on campus — even around the
Treehouse and the Coffee House.
"I used to be really careful
about drinking in public on cam
pus," said an anonymous sopho
more. "Then I got an MIP [Minor
in Possession] outside the CoHo
and since then I have been way
more lax about it. I mean, if I got
an MIP even when I was careful, it
doesn't seem worth it to always
look over my shoulder. Once you
pass the point of getting a citation
there isn't all that much to lose-es
pecially since the chances of get
ting another MIP seem so low."
Even though many students
know someone who has gotten a
citation in a similar way or have
had experiences that seem con
trary to what Wilson and Graves
were saying, the police depart
ment maintains that their primary
concern is not the actual illegality
of underage drinking.
"On any college campus, alco
hol is a concern," Wilson said.
"But it's not the drinking itself that
is the real issue. Instead it is the be
havior — vandalism, fighting,
sexual assault, accidents — associ
ated with alcohol misuse that we
are looking to control."
