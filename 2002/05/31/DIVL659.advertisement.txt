See the films alumni are calling
"just like being at Stanford!"
LAST SPRING, three camera crews roamed the campus, capturing the
undergraduate experience on film. And sometimes getting in everybody's
way! Sorry about that...
As part of the Think Again National Tour, these four film segments have been
shown in eleven cities across the country and we'd like to share them with
the campus community this weekend.
Sponsored by the Campaign for Undergraduate Education and the Stanford
Alumni Association, the Think Again National Tour invites all students,
faculty and staff to see this extraordinary cinematography at a special,
"one time only," media run-through this Saturday, June 1 at 10:00 am in
Memorial Auditorium.
