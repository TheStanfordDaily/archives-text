# Nanotechnology, stem cells and early Americans

### AMIT GARG STAFF WRITER 
Are computers and humans made of
the same stuff? Aye, there is the rub. IBM
researchers have built transistors out of car
bon nanotubes that are more efficient than
silicon ones, which form the basis of chips
powering modern computers. Two weeks
ago, their study was published in "Applied
Physics letters." Nanotechnology is die sci
ence of building things on the molecular
level. Nanotubes are a hot commodity be
cause of their ability to conduct electricity
with minimal resistance. The researchers
propagated signals much quicker in the
carbon nanotubes than standard silicon
wires. Full-scale use of carbon nanotubes is
still far away, though. The researchers ob
served random behavior at the ends of the
nanotubes, which does not occur in silicon
transistors; indeed nanotubes diemselves
are not well understood.

Who said space is void? Researchers from
the National Space Science and Technolo
gy Center are watching the sun in an effort
to better predict space weather. Solar flares
lift billions of particles diat impact the mag
netosphere, die magnetic filed around the
Earth. The study published in"The Astro
physical Journal" diis April describes how
scientists can now better track solar erup
tions and predict their effects. David Fal
coner, one of the authors, described the
sleuth work as watching clouds and trying
to predict if it is going to rain. Solar flares
can dismpt transmission on Earth but even
more dangerous to astronomers and satel
lites orbiting die planet and therefore widi
out atmospheric protection. With the bet
ter equipment, the staff from the center
hopes to provide better advance warnings.
Researchers in the Imperial College in
London have successfully transformed
mice stem cells into lung tissue. Stem cells

are theoretically totipotent, that is, they can
transform into any kind of cell. The ethical
controversy is that stem cells are currendy
obtained from embryos. The United States
has enforced strict laws regulating stem cell
research but the United Kingdom has been
more lenient. The English experiment
raises hope that stem cells might be used to
regenerate damaged lung tissue. Ilie re
searchers now are going to test dieir find
ings in vivo, by glowing cells in especially
designed bioactive foams and scaffolds.
South Korea is mobilizing rapidly to elimi
nate surges of foot-and-mouth disease,
which is caused by a virus carried by many
types of livestock, especially by pigs. The
disease does not affect humans, although it
can remain in nasal passages up to 28
hours. The virus is extremely contagious,
with a close to 100 percent infection rate. Its
biggest economic effect is cows giving less
milk and debilitated livestock. Britain suf

fered a massive outbreak in 2001, leading
to the slaughter of 4 million pigs and cows.
The current outbreak in Korea has
claimed about 100,000 pigs. South Korea
will be receiving almost half a million visi
tors due to the Soccer World Cup, which
started this weekend.
Sustainable farming is no longer a concept
restricted to activists as many scientists have
embraced it, too. Modern agriculture is
heavily based on specialization, artificial se
lection and fertilizers. Specialization means
a farm is dedicated to a single crop, which
often depletes the soil quickly and uneven
ly. Artificial selection is an age-old tradition:
Farmers select plants that yield the best
harvest. This, however, reduces genetic
variability and increases the risk that a
plague can devastate an entire far m. Final
ly, fertilizers pollute the environment and
create imbalances in the ecosystem. Collab
oration among academic researchers and

companies has increased in recent years.
Nevertheless, a recent study by the Univer
sity oflllinois has concluded that increasing
awareness among fanners is crucial to
wards sustainable farming.
How did humans move to the Americas?
'Flie two main theories are that they came
via an ice bridge between Russia and Alas
ka and island hopping across the Pacific.
Recent evidence suggests that both migra
tions may have taken place. Archaeologists
from the National University of Australia
are investigating the second theory by as
sessing the development of sailing boats,
linguists, agriculture and pottery in North
ern Philippines. The researchers hope to
find evidence linking the Philippine abo
rigines to Amerindians and learn what the
early migrants brought to the New World.
