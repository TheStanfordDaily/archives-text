Oakland City Council
attempts to expand A's
lease at Coliseum
OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — The City Council will con
tinue negotiations with the Oakland Athletics on ex
tending the team's lease at Network Associates Colise
um.
Owners had considered moving the team to another
city for both business reasons and past political prob
lems in Oakland, A's consultant Sam Spear said Tues
day.
Now, co-owner Steve Schott has "totally focused his
energies" on Oakland, Spear said.
City representatives will spend two more weeks dis
cussing a new proposal with the A's. The deal could in
clude a five-year lease extension for $450,000 a year in
rent and about $150,000 annually from a ticket sur
charge. The lease expires in 2004.
Negotiations also include the possibility of a new
downtown Oakland ballpark.

16-year-old accused of
killing two classmates
scheduled for hearing
EL CAJON, Calif. (AP) — A teen-ager accused of
killing two students in a shooting rampage at his high
school last year is scheduled to have a preliminary hear
ing on July 11.
Charles "Andy" Williams appeared in court yester
day for the first time in more than 13 months. The case
had been delayed by legal challenges brought by the de
fense.
At the preliminary hearing, prosecutors will attempt
to show there is sufficient evidence to try Williams on
dozens of charges, including murder, attempted mur
der and assault.
Williams, 16, is accused of opening fire with a hand
gun at Santana High School in Santee on March 5,
2001, killing two boys and wounding 13 other people.
He has been charged as an adult and could spend the
rest of his life in prison if convicted.
The teen-ager is being held without bail in Juvenile
Hall. He said little during the brief court appearance.
