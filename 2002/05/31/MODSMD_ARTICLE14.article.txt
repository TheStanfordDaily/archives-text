• • Ever since I learned that Mo
hamedAtta made his reservation for
Sept. 11 using his laptop and the
American Airlines Web site, and that
several of his colleagues used Drave
locity.com, I've been wondering how
the entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley
were looking at the 9/11 tragedy —
whether it was giving them any
pause about the wired world they've
been building and the assumptions
they are building it upon.
In a recent visit to Stanford Univer
sity and Silicon Valley, I had a chance
to pose these questions to techies.
I found that at least some of their
libertarian, technology-will-solve
everything cockiness was gone. I
found a much keener awareness that
the unique web of technologies Silicon
Valley was building before 9/11 —
from the Internet to powerful encryp
tion software — can be incredible
force multipliers for individuals and
small groups to do both good and evil.
And I found an acknowledgment that
all those technologies had been built
with a high degree of trust as to how
they would be used, and that that
trust had been shaken. In its place is a
greater appreciation that high-tech
companies aren't just threatened by
their competitors — but also by some
of their users.

the May 26 issue of The New Yorfc Times.
