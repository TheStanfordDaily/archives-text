# Stanford still struggles to obtain female faculty
## 
### AMELIA DELAPAZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In 1977, no women held facility positions
in tlie Computer Science Department here,
and, despite some increases in the numbers,
there are only four women now.
In fact, women make up a relatively small
percentage of the faculty in almost Jill depart
ments at Stanford, especially science and en
gineering.
Research examining the number of
women faculty at Stanford started in 1993.
That year, education professor Myra Strober
and a group of researchers published the Re
port of the Committee on the Recruitment
and Retention of Women Faculty at Stanford,
known as the Strober Report.
I lie report stated, "Relative to the 20 uni
versities with which we usually compare our
selves, Stanford is seriously lagging with re
spect to recruitment and retention of women
faculty." Among the suggestions were a rapid
change in the procedures and policies of hir
ing at Stanford.
Nearly 10 years later, there are a variety of
reasons for why there are large differences in
the numbers of male and female faculty mem
bers. One of the causes is that fewer female
graduates pursue academic c areers.
In the School of Engineering, 18 to 20 per

cent of doctoral students and 23 percent of
masters' students are women. Yet women
make up only about 10 percent of the faculty.
Jeffery Koseff, senior associate dean of en
gineering, said diat although more than half
of his graduate students are women, "it's dis
appointing how few are interested in academ
ic careers."
Many people say fewer women choose aca
demic careers because of the societal pressure
to raise a family. President Hennessy said re
cendy that faculty careers are not always fam
ily-friendly careers.
The lac k of women faculty may also be
caused by a deeper social bias that discourages
them from seeking more prestigious posi
tions. For example, studies show many em
ployers will chose a male candidate over an
equally qualified female candidate.
Another bias that applies specifically to en
gineering is society generally encourages men
to enter these fields in greater numbers. Com
puter Science Professor Daphne Roller attrib
utes diis to the idea that girls need to appeal to
men to be successful in life and that by study
ing science or engineering, they will not be
able to do this.
Sophomore Sabrina Williams also has ex
perienced this bias. "When I was younger,
girls weren't supposed to like math and sci
ence," Williams remembers. However, unlike

many girls, Williams used this to help her. "I
ended up doing techie tilings because I always
liked to prove people wrong about me. That's
why math and science became my best sub
jects," she said.
Iliis lack of encouragement is one cause of
what many call the "pipeline problem," which
refers to the decrease in the number of
women at each stage of education. For exam
ple, more women get bachelors' degrees in
Computer Science than get masters' degrees
and fewer receive doctoral degrees dian be
come tenured faculty.
The pipeline issue is one of die most influ
ential contributing to die lack of female facul
ty members, according to administrators. "To
make dramatic increases [in the number of
women faculty] will be very difficult without
addressing the pipeline issue in a comprehen
sive way," Koseff stated.
In order to do this, he feels that Stanford
must continue to create a welcoming and
comfortable environment for its female grad
uate students and faculty.
"Recendy, Stanford has done a pretty good
job about creating a nurturing environment
for young women faculty," Koseff comment
ed. He feels that the University has offered
support if women decide to have a family and
