# Stanford still struggles to obtain female faculty
## 
### AMELIA DELAPAZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In 1977, no women held facility positions
in tlie Computer Science Department here,
and, despite some increases in the numbers,
there are only four women now.
In fact, women make up a relatively small
percentage of the faculty in almost Jill depart
ments at Stanford, especially science and en
gineering.
Research examining the number of
women faculty at Stanford started in 1993.
That year, education professor Myra Strober
and a group of researchers published the Re
port of the Committee on the Recruitment
and Retention of Women Faculty at Stanford,
known as the Strober Report.
I lie report stated, "Relative to the 20 uni
versities with which we usually compare our
selves, Stanford is seriously lagging with re
spect to recruitment and retention of women
faculty." Among the suggestions were a rapid
change in the procedures and policies of hir
ing at Stanford.
Nearly 10 years later, there are a variety of
reasons for why there are large differences in
the numbers of male and female faculty mem
bers. One of the causes is that fewer female
graduates pursue academic c areers.
In the School of Engineering, 18 to 20 per

cent of doctoral students and 23 percent of
masters' students are women. Yet women
make up only about 10 percent of the faculty.
Jeffery Koseff, senior associate dean of en
gineering, said diat although more than half
of his graduate students are women, "it's dis
appointing how few are interested in academ
ic careers."
Many people say fewer women choose aca
demic careers because of the societal pressure
to raise a family. President Hennessy said re
cendy that faculty careers are not always fam
ily-friendly careers.
The lac k of women faculty may also be
caused by a deeper social bias that discourages
them from seeking more prestigious posi
tions. For example, studies show many em
ployers will chose a male candidate over an
equally qualified female candidate.
Another bias that applies specifically to en
gineering is society generally encourages men
to enter these fields in greater numbers. Com
puter Science Professor Daphne Roller attrib
utes diis to the idea that girls need to appeal to
men to be successful in life and that by study
ing science or engineering, they will not be
able to do this.
Sophomore Sabrina Williams also has ex
perienced this bias. "When I was younger,
girls weren't supposed to like math and sci
ence," Williams remembers. However, unlike

many girls, Williams used this to help her. "I
ended up doing techie tilings because I always
liked to prove people wrong about me. That's
why math and science became my best sub
jects," she said.
Iliis lack of encouragement is one cause of
what many call the "pipeline problem," which
refers to the decrease in the number of
women at each stage of education. For exam
ple, more women get bachelors' degrees in
Computer Science than get masters' degrees
and fewer receive doctoral degrees dian be
come tenured faculty.
The pipeline issue is one of die most influ
ential contributing to die lack of female facul
ty members, according to administrators. "To
make dramatic increases [in the number of
women faculty] will be very difficult without
addressing the pipeline issue in a comprehen
sive way," Koseff stated.
In order to do this, he feels that Stanford
must continue to create a welcoming and
comfortable environment for its female grad
uate students and faculty.
"Recendy, Stanford has done a pretty good
job about creating a nurturing environment
for young women faculty," Koseff comment
ed. He feels that the University has offered
support if women decide to have a family and
that the School of Engineering, at
least, has attempted to make them
feel less marginalized in the deci
sion-making process.
He also maintains that recruit
ing faculty at the senior level is an
unproductive method of increasing
the numbers of female faculty in the
School of Engineering. According
to Koseff, the most effective hiring
process will be to recruit aggressive
ly at the assistant professor level.
Koseff claims Stanford is doing
well in comparison to its peer insti
tutions in junior professor recruit
ment, and the statistics on percent
ages of female faculty show that
Stanford is equal to, or nearly equal
to, its peer institutions in almost all
departments.
The University as a whole has al
ready taken some measures to help
young assistant professors.
One is the gender-neutral exten
sion of the tenure clock. If male or
female faculty members play a sig
nificant role in the raising of their
children, the University will allow
them more time before they must
apply for tenure. They can then
have time to spend with their fami
ly because, instead of working in
tensely fora short period of time,
they can accomplish research over

several years.
Ideally, this allows both mem
bers of a couple pursuing academic
careers to achieve faculty positions
if they wish to do so.
This is only one part of the in
creased efforts to create a more
family-friendly environment for
faculty members and give them in
creased childcare options. Right
now, the children of faculty have
priority at the Bing Nursery School
on campus.
According to researchers, creat
ing long-lasting gender equality
among faculty will require the
elimination of deeply rooted psy
chological biases. However, they
express hope that in making peo
ple aware of the biases, the re
searchers are taking the first step
toward eliminating them.
Administrators have worked
hard over the last 10 years to com
bat unconscious biases that result in
gender inequality. The University
has been trying actively to hire fe
male professors by displaying what
President Hennessy referred to as
"constant vigilance."
This simply means that those
hiring professors for Stanford must
always be aware of the biases they
hold. In interviews they must make
sure enough women are informed
of the open position and that
enough women are interviewed.
"There has certainly already
been attention to trying to improve

the situation," Hennessy said.
With the increased awareness and
the improving statistics, he, as well
as other administrators, are opti
mistic about the future of female
professors at Stanford.
Another group on campus, the
Society of Women Engineers, is
trying to combat the issue begin
ning even earlier. The group spon
sors many events around the Bay
Area, including several engineer
ing competitions for elementary
through high school age kids.
These events are not, however,
gender specific. "We try to show
to everyone that science and engi
neering is fun, as well as to serve
as female role models," said ju
nior Alexis Wallen, the secretary
ofSWE.
The group also has a graduate
branch that provides role models
for undergraduates who are con
sidering higher engineering de
grees or faculty positions.
Williams also commented that
she felt like there was a lack of fe
male role models in more technical
departments, but she is doing what
she can to try and change that.
" The lack of female professors
(and women in general) in my
classes isn't a deterrent for me - it is
an inspiration," she said. "Hopeful
ly someday I can be an example for
someone else who does need that
role model to help them pursue
whatever goal she may have."
