## The 						Stanford Daily Editor in Chief bids farewell to The Daily, readers 
### 
Published Since 1891

About four months ago, I welcomed
you, the readers, to volume 221 of
The Stanford Daily. Now, I am
writing to tell you farewell. I admit
that it is a bit premature: There are two is
sues left in the volume, one for Dead Week
and one for Commencement.
One of the things that I am most thankful
and grateful for during these past four
months is the opportunity to work with the
100 or so extremely talented students who
are editors and writers. Every day that I have
been at The Daily, the skill, talent and cre
ativity of the staff have amazed me. I would
like to take this opportunity to publicly thank
all the members of The Daily staff for their
hard work and congratulate them on the
great papers that they have produced.
But I have no doubt that this level of tal
ent is limited to Daily staff members. My

time at The Daily has convinced me even
more firmly that everyone at Stanford has
these exceptional skills.
I hope that you, the readers, have en
joyed reading this volume of The Daily and
found it informative. We have tried our
hardest to deliver a paper each morning
that is interesting, well-researched, correct
and occasionally provocative. We hope that
we have succeeded in this goal.
There is a saying that "newspapers are
the first draft of history." I believe that is
true, and I believe it is a privilege and a re
sponsibility to contribute to the history of
Stanford in this way. It amazes me to think
that, in 20 years, someone might be looking
at these newspapers in the Green Library
archives and using them as a lens to view
Stanford in winter and spring 2002.
We know that over 10,000 students, facul

ty, staff and local residents pick up The Daily
each day. If they glance at the headlines or
read it cover to cover, they still read it. Know
ing this only makes me and the entire staff
try harder to print the best paper possible.
I remember the first story that I wrote
for The Daily as a freshman, about two and
a half years ago. Even today, I recall that I
talked to Dean of Students Marc Wais
about a bonfire at Texas A&M and the ef
fect it had on the bonfire (or lack thereof) in
Lake Lagunita. Now, I will bid farewell to
this newspaper that has taken up so much
of my time since then. During that time, it
has frustrated me and challenged me but
always left me satisfied.
So in about two weeks, I will say goodbye
to The Daily, certainly with much sadness. I
will miss the camaraderie of the newsroom,
the thrill of interviewing someone impor

tant, the satisfaction of reading an editorial
that makes the perfect argument, or the
humor or fun of reading a funny article in
Intermission. 1 will miss the late nights and
the aggravation that inevitably results when
things don't go as planned or the newspa
per isn't perfect.
But nevertheless, I will always be thankful
for the opportunity and the memories that
The Daily and its staff have given to me. I will
be thankful for the privilege and the respon
sibility of leading The Daily and communi
cating the news to everyone at Stanford.
