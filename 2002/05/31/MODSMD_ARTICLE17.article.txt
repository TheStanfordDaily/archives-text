# THE 						FRIDAY COLUMN
## Aim for another Iron Chef 
### 
Some of my friends will be graduating
in the next few days. Not just gradu
ating as in getting their diploma and
then going on to more school, but
graduating and, after almost 20 years of
school, being through with it.
For the first time since before preschool,
they'll no longer be eligible for student dis
counts, no longer have an easy answer to
questions like, "What are you doing with
your life?" or "Why aren't you making any
money?" or "How could you?"
"I'm senile" and "mental instability" are
actually the only answers as good as "I'm a
student" for questions like these.
I wonder what this year's graduates
will do.
Judging from the way people talk
around this time of year, probably they'll

cure cancer, end teiror
ism, save the panda, dis
cover another universe
and in general make ev
erything perfect, all by
September, leaving noth
ing for the next year's class
to do.
Judging by the record
of past graduating classes,
though, while they may

indeed do many great things, they'll leave
at least a few things left.
In case anyone needs any ideas — other
than the obvious things like serving your
community, doing your best and taking
care of your family — here are some con
crete suggestions, covering a diversity of
spheres and of a variety of sizes.
I'm watching "Iron Chef USA: Show
down in Las Vegas" as I write this. It is an
imitation of the Japanese show where chefs
spar in a cooking competition that is, in the
words of the Food Network, "'Ultimate
Fighting' meets Julia Child." Hosted by
"The Chairman" William Shatner, it is
quality television. I would like to see a grad
uate of the Class of 2002 create another
show of this creative caliber.
Moving from the realm of entertain
ment to the arena of business and from the
slighdy trivial to the more significant, grad
uates could aim to uphold their ethics in the
workplace. At commencement day, most
students have consensus on what's right
and wrong. Hurting the environment,
gouging consumers, taking advantage of
sick people — all bad things, everyone
would agree.
Somewhere along the way, though, val
ues sometimes morph. Probably the Enron
employees who cooked up schemes with
names like "Death Star," "Fat Boy," and
"Ricochet" to bypass irksome regulations
and get money into their hollow company
were at one point young people much like
this year s graduates. The Enron managers
who allegedly filled a trading room with
people pretending to talk on phones to im
press visiting analysts may have once been
like this year's graduates, too.
Or maybe not. But those grads who do
find it easy to keep their moral compass in

the business world can do even more. They
could live up to the so-called Graduate
Pledge: to consider "the social and environ
mental consequences" of employment op
portunities and "try to improve these as
pects of any organizations" they work for.
There are plenty of things to improve in
business. Besides Enron, Merrill Lynch has
been in trouble. Driven by the interests of
the investment-banking side of the compa
ny, analysts at Merrill Lynch gave "buy"
recommendations on companies that they
internally called "pieces of junk," and
other, less appropriate synonyms for
"junk." I hope this year's graduates going
to work for financial companies don't do
diings like that.
I also hope those going into the phar
maceutical business make some changes. It
seems, from reports this week, that some
drug companies manipulate the patent sys
tem. A company very slightly alters a drug
shordy before its patent on it expires and
then applies fora patent on the new ver
sion, thereby continuing to keep cheaper
generic alternatives from the public.
The new version will often be heavily pro
moted by die company to doctors and to the
public, even if it is no better. Bristol-Meyers
Squibb, hours before its patent on BuSpar
expired in 2000, obtained a new patent on
how drug is metabolized, what happens to it
after you swallow it. Until overturned by a
court, it thus maintained its lucrative stran
glehold on the market for the drug.
Besides the arts and business, this year's
discerning graduate can also set sight on
goals in public policy. Quelling terrorism
may be the most pressing issue to get in
volved in, but there are others too. Working
towards nuclear disarmament is a perenni
al one that's as important as ever. And the
environment is another "oldie but goodie."
According to a United Nations report
released last week, unless immediate action
is taken, within three decades over 50 per
cent of humanity will live in drought. Pollu
tion, global warming and desertification all
menace. In 2032, 70 percent of remaining
animal species will be threatened. Even
today, one in four mammal species is in
danger. Widiout this generation's help, the
only way to maintain many animals will be
through Jurassic Park-style cloning, the
way Australian scientists are currently try
ing to bring back the extinct Tasmanian
tiger. That's sad.
And with the worldwide gap between
rich and poor growing, global instability
will only worsen. Someone should address
that, too.
So there you go. That's some of what this
year's graduates can set as aims. The grad
uates will definitely have a fun time, despite
some of the bleak depictions above. Be
sides, they'll probably solve the problems
anyway, by September. Hopefully even the
need for an Iron Chef spin-off.

the business world can do even more. They
could live up to the so-called Graduate
Pledge: to consider "the social and environ
mental consequences" of employment op
portunities and "try to improve these as
pects of any organizations" they work for.
There are plenty of things to improve in
business. Besides Enron, Merrill Lynch has
been in trouble. Driven by the interests of
the investment-banking side of the compa
ny, analysts at Merrill Lynch gave "buy"
recommendations on companies that they
internally called "pieces of junk," and
other, less appropriate synonyms for
"junk." I hope this year's graduates going
to work for financial companies don't do
diings like that.
I also hope those going into the phar
maceutical business make some changes. It
seems, from reports this week, that some
drug companies manipulate the patent sys
tem. A company very slightly alters a drug
shordy before its patent on it expires and
then applies fora patent on the new ver
sion, thereby continuing to keep cheaper
generic alternatives from the public.
The new version will often be heavily pro
moted by die company to doctors and to the
public, even if it is no better. Bristol-Meyers
Squibb, hours before its patent on BuSpar
expired in 2000, obtained a new patent on
how drug is metabolized, what happens to it
after you swallow it. Until overturned by a
court, it thus maintained its lucrative stran
glehold on the market for the drug.
Besides the arts and business, this year's
discerning graduate can also set sight on
goals in public policy. Quelling terrorism
may be the most pressing issue to get in
volved in, but there are others too. Working
towards nuclear disarmament is a perenni
al one that's as important as ever. And the
environment is another "oldie but goodie."
According to a United Nations report
released last week, unless immediate action
is taken, within three decades over 50 per
cent of humanity will live in drought. Pollu
tion, global warming and desertification all
menace. In 2032, 70 percent of remaining
animal species will be threatened. Even
today, one in four mammal species is in
danger. Widiout this generation's help, the
only way to maintain many animals will be
through Jurassic Park-style cloning, the
way Australian scientists are currently try
ing to bring back the extinct Tasmanian
tiger. That's sad.
And with the worldwide gap between
rich and poor growing, global instability
will only worsen. Someone should address
that, too.
So there you go. That's some of what this
year's graduates can set as aims. The grad
uates will definitely have a fun time, despite
some of the bleak depictions above. Be
sides, they'll probably solve the problems
anyway, by September. Hopefully even the
need for an Iron Chef spin-off.

Some of my friends will be graduating
in the next few days. Not just gradu
ating as in getting their diploma and
then going on to more school, but
graduating and, after almost 20 years of
school, being through with it.
For the first time since before preschool,
they'll no longer be eligible for student dis
counts, no longer have an easy answer to
questions like, "What are you doing with
your life?" or "Why aren't you making any
money?" or "How could you?"
"I'm senile" and "mental instability" are
actually the only answers as good as "I'm a
student" for questions like these.
I wonder what this year's graduates
will do.
Judging from the way people talk
around this time of year, probably they'll

cure cancer, end teiror
ism, save the panda, dis
cover another universe
and in general make ev
erything perfect, all by
September, leaving noth
ing for the next year's class
to do.
Judging by the record
of past graduating classes,
though, while they may

indeed do many great things, they'll leave
at least a few things left.
In case anyone needs any ideas — other
than the obvious things like serving your
community, doing your best and taking
care of your family — here are some con
crete suggestions, covering a diversity of
spheres and of a variety of sizes.
I'm watching "Iron Chef USA: Show
down in Las Vegas" as I write this. It is an
imitation of the Japanese show where chefs
spar in a cooking competition that is, in the
words of the Food Network, "'Ultimate
Fighting' meets Julia Child." Hosted by
"The Chairman" William Shatner, it is
quality television. I would like to see a grad
uate of the Class of 2002 create another
show of this creative caliber.
Moving from the realm of entertain
ment to the arena of business and from the
slighdy trivial to the more significant, grad
uates could aim to uphold their ethics in the
workplace. At commencement day, most
students have consensus on what's right
and wrong. Hurting the environment,
gouging consumers, taking advantage of
sick people — all bad things, everyone
would agree.
Somewhere along the way, though, val
ues sometimes morph. Probably the Enron
employees who cooked up schemes with
names like "Death Star," "Fat Boy," and
"Ricochet" to bypass irksome regulations
and get money into their hollow company
were at one point young people much like
this year s graduates. The Enron managers
who allegedly filled a trading room with
people pretending to talk on phones to im
press visiting analysts may have once been
like this year's graduates, too.
Or maybe not. But those grads who do
find it easy to keep their moral compass in

the business world can do even more. They
could live up to the so-called Graduate
Pledge: to consider "the social and environ
mental consequences" of employment op
portunities and "try to improve these as
pects of any organizations" they work for.
