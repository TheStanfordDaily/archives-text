Senior 'thrilled' to hear Rice speak
On May 17, the graduating class at UC-
Berkeley sat in the Greek Theater and
heard Johnny Moseley describe his jour
ney from narcissism to self-realization. I
don't feel I am in any way disrespecting
Moseley by saying that, after four years of
hard work at Stanford, I am looking for
more in my commencement speech. I am
proud that my university has as distin
guished an associate as Condoleezza Rice,
and 1 am looking forward to what she has
to say when 1 graduate on the 16th.
It would not surprise anyone who
knows me to learn that I agree with most
of the policies Rice has pursued since as
suming the office of National Security Ad
viser. However, more important to me
than a speaker with whom 1 agree is one
who is relevant, and one from whom I
think I can learn. Rice fits this description
well, and considering both her close ties
with the University and her status as per
haps the most powerful woman in the
world right now, 1 would be thrilled to
hear her speak regardless of my politics.
One of the most popular vote-getters
among the senior class's nominations for
commencement speaker was former presi
dent Bill Clinton; had Rice proved unavail
able to speak, I would have been almost as
happy to hear our former president, re
gardless of my opinions on his job in office.
Rice and Clinton are controversial fig
ures who share remarkable personal histo
ries and accomplishments that can be an
example to us all. As The Daily noted back
in February, "Show us someone who has
never done anything to which some Stan
ford students could object on ideological
grounds, and we'll show you someone who
has never done anything of import in the

public sphere." Somewhere at Stanford,
I'm sure there is a skier who believes that
the Dinner Roll is a desecration of mogul
skiing, but I don't know if that counts.

Lacrosse player's teammates 'very
exceptional student-athletes'
A statement in Wednesday's editorial
("Athletic-academic relationship deserves
examination") mentioned that Stanford
has "very few exceptional student-ath
letes." Speaking as a member of the
women's lacrosse team, I can honestly say
at least 90 to 95 percent of the team's
members are exceptional people and very
exceptional student-athletes. I have never
been more amazed and impressed with a
group of people in my life.
I think the author of the editorial may
need to think about who exactly he or she
is making a blanket statement about be
fore saying it. I am personally offended to
read a statement like that that blankets
athletes as a whole, which includes my
team. Thank you for listening.

Masturbation and pornography
'unhealtn/
We are saddened by the advice given by
Milo the Dog in last Friday's Intermission
section regarding the "healthy place for
masturbation in every relationship" and
the columnist's acceptance that using

pornography is a "ritual of male bonding."
It is our belief that pornography is the
exploitation of human bodies for the ex
press purpose of arousing, feeding and
gratifying one's sexual drive. It has be
come an industry which profits from the
commodification of sex and, according to
Milo, has become an acceptable form of
entertainment. Surely the male race can
devise more creative ways to bond than
over "sex-crazed, naked women."
If pornography is a natural part of the
male experience, then a relationship
where you and your partner are Hilly com
mitted to one another in body, mind and
spirit cannot exist. This assumption says to
your partner that he or she is not enough.
Likewise, masturbation implies that the
purpose of sex is not for the intimate ex
pression of love but for one's own sexual
satisfaction instead. While Milo correctly
recognizes that obsessions with porn and
masturbation can be alienating, he fails to
understand that the acts themselves, how
ever occasional, set unhealthy foundations
fora relationship involving respect, trust
and commitment.
Finally, we'd like to address the photo
accompanying Milo's advice to "Confused
While My Boyfriend Wacks His Weiner."
The headline and caption asking "Should
she be worried?" and "Is this who your
man is thinking about?" beg comparison
between the partner and the toned,
breathy, damp and ripe model that invites
the voyeur into her world.
Is this what it takes to satiate the sexual
appetite of the men Milo talks about? Ulti
mately, pictures like this and pornogra
phy objectify and belittle the partner for
whom porn is a substitute. Hiey reinforce
