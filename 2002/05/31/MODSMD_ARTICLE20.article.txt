# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## The
						Coalition for Labor Justice responds to Daily editorial 
### COALITION FOR LABOR JUSTICE GUEST COLUMNIST 
The Coalition for Labor Justice
would like to respond to The Daily and
to the larger Stanford community con
cerning yesterday's editorial, which
overlooked several crucial pieces of in
formation concerning the sleep-out for
labor justice.
First, The Daily claimed that the coali
tion is incorrectly applying pressure on
University President John Hennessy in re
gard to Bon Appetit's contract negotia
tions with its workers and should instead
focus on the management of Bon Appetit
itself. The pressure is directed to Hen
nessy because he is the ultimate financial
authority at Stanford.
The editorial board writes that the Uni

versity's involvement in the contract nego
tiations can only amount to the dissolution
ofits own contract with BonAppetit. How
ever, this statement is misguided. The
University can set labor standards for ven
dors and subcontractors.
The threat of the contract's dissolution
alone is a powerful tool because having
Stanford as a client is a valuable asset to
Bon Appetit. It adds prestige to the com
pany's resume and opens possibilities of
employment across the nation. The Uni
versity thus lias control over the labor
standards at Bon Appetit on this campus
and should act to insure that Bon Appetit
treats their workers fairly.
Second, the sleep-out and surround
ing events are not isolated actions. They
are part of the larger Code of Conduct
campaign that began earlier' this year.

The Code of Conduct is meant to ensure
that all workers on campus are given the
respect they deserve as members of the
Stanford community through the provi
sion of a true living wage and benefits.
Part ofthe Code of Conduct would ensure
that equal wages and benefits are given to
all workers performing the same job 011
the Stanford campus, 110 matter whether
they are subcontracted or directly hired
by the University.
Hennessy has stated earlier this year
that he is committed to the well-being of
every single worker on the Stanford cam
pus. If this is true he should demonstrate
his authority as Stanford's chief repre
sentative and decision-maker and ac t 011
his commitment to a living wage at Stan
ford by pressuring Bon Appetit to pro
vide its workers with the same pay and

benefits as directly hired Stanford din
ing-hall employees.
Despite generalized statements from the
editorial board, the coalition has indeed
been actively educating the campus regard
ing labor justice at Stanford and this cam
paign in particular. Educational forums
have been held with the organizers of Har
vard's living wage campaign. We have fly
ered bathrooms across campus, and dorm
presentations were organized last week.
The Coalition has also done extensive
outreach to campus groups, giving pre
sentations to numerous groups including
Sanskriti, the Black Student Union, the
Stanford Community for Peace and Jus
tice and many others.
Finally, the Coalitions has organized a
campaign to gain faculty support and in
volvement through the organization of a

faculty committee on labor justice. It is es
timated that 90 percent of our group's ef
fort flows to outreach and creating aware
ness, and it is regrettable that this continu
ous effort has not been acknowledged by
The Daily.
Finally, this protest, which"began Mon
day, is itself an effective form of outreach
an education. Through our presence in
the Quad in front of Hennessy's office, we
are raising awareness of the administra
tion's lack of response to the very immedi
ate problem of unjust treatment of the
Bon Appetit workers on our campus.
But most importandy, the sleep-out for
labor justice is directed toward Hennessy,
who bears the final responsibility to ensure
that fair labor conditions are met at Stanford.
Our victory last night proved that our
tactics are working.
