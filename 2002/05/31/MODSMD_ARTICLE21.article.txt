# Lucent scientists under review
## Stanford Physics Prof. to head investigative panel 
### ALI ALEMOZAFAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On May 10, Lucent Technolo
gies received information from an
outside researcher alleging that two
of its scientists had engaged in mis
conduct when conducting poten
tially revolutionary research in mol
ecular computing.
In response, Lucent has assem
bled an independent panel of high
level scientists to investigate the
findings, marking the first time a
major research laboratory has
taken such a drastic measure. The
panel is headed by Stanford Prof, of
Applied Physics Malcolm R.
Beasley, a former dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences.
According to Beasley, the repu
tation of the scientific method is at
stake.
"We want people to believe what
they read in a [scientific] journal,"
he said.
"The management of Bell Labs
called me .... [and] they felt that it
was appropriate to have an investi
gation," Beasley added. "An in
quiry is required to see if there is
anything serious here."
Last year, scientists Hendrik
Schon and Zhenan Bao of Bell

Labs, a subsidiary of Lucent Tech
nologies, won acclaim fora series of
articles on molecular electronics
published in journals like Science,
Nature and Applied Physics let
ters. In one of these articles, Schon
and Bao revealed a possible break
through in molecular computing,
based on an experiment in which
an electronic switch was made from
a single molecule.
This finding has been met with
skepticism by some who noted that
portions of data from separate ex
periments appeared nearly identi
cal, including patterns of "noise"
that should be random.
Further skepticism has arisen
due to the difficulty other scientists
have had in reproducing the results,
the New York Times reported,
o The committee Lucent formed
consists of people both inside and
outside of Bell Labs, Beasley said.
"To do this sort of thing, you
have to get people that, are good,"
he said.
Other members on the commit
tee are Herbert Kroemer, a profes
sor of electrical and computer engi
neering at UC-Santa Barbara and a
winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics
in 2000; Supriyo Datta, a professor
of electrical and computer engi
neering at Purdue University; Her
wig Kogelnik, a scientist at Bell Labs
and Donald P. Monroe, a scientist
at Agere Systems.

Private research labs are not ob
ligated to follow federal research
misconduct guidelines. However,
Beasley added that Lucent would
the guidelines.
"Scientific misconduct has a well
defined meaning," Beasley said.
Misconduct is defined by the Of
fice of Science and Technology Pol
icy as fabrication, falsification or
plagiarism in proposing, perform
ing or reviewing research, or in re
porting research results.
"Fraud in science is rare, but the
most important and exciting scien
tific results are always subjected to
intense scrutiny," Stanford Assistant
Prof, of Physics David Goldhaber-
Gordon told Reuters. "Should er
rors or even fraud occur in such crit
ical areas, they will be exposed."
Goldhaber-Gordon added that
acclaimed experiments tend to
draw peer review, and that the
public should await the commit
tee's results before passing judg
ment on Schon.
"This has to be a considered
process .... we have to start with
some allegation and go out from
there," Beasley said. He further
added that the committee's first
task is to "extract all the informa
tion that [they] can."
"The report of the Bell Labs re
sults has been transmitted to the
committee," Beasley said. "We're
on our wav ."
