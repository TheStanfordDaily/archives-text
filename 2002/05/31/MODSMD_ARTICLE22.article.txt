# New fusion reactor sparks controversy
## 
### SEAN MOONEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On March 22, 1989, the scientific world was
shaken by an announcement that Drs. Stanley
Pons and Martin Fleischmann had created a fu
sion reactor in a glass tube that worked at room
temperature, lhe reactor involved deuterated
water and palladium electrodes. It held the pos
sibility of an endless supply of energy from little
more than water.
Unfortunately, these amazing experiments
were not reproducable as described, and it
seemed that "cold fusion" would be forever stig
matized in the scientific community.
Desktop fusion is a technological dream that
could hold a solution to many societal ills. With
this technique, dependence on foreign fossils
fuels and a seemingly limitless thirst for energy
could potentially be ameliorated over night.
In the March 8 edition of the journal Science,
Oak Ridge National Libs researcher R. Tale
yarkhan and colleagues found evidence that
desktop fusion may be possible, once again stir
ring painful memories of the past. Their system is
quite different from the original experiment in
1989, but the significance is also great and so is the
controversy.
Roughly, the technology relies on bringing
two protons (hydrogen nuclei) together to form
a deuteron, a positron and an electron neutri

no, in a process that releases a large amount of
energy. Deuterons can then participate in
other reactions to form additional elements
such as helium.
Hydrogen nuclei possess a +1 charge and
repel each other, so that strong coloumbic
forces must be overcome for them to fuse. This
process usually takes place at extremely high
temperatures and pressures, such as in the nu
clear furnace at the sun's center. On Earth,
these reactions can be obtained in megavolt ac
celerators, with an apparatus that produces the
required conditions. .
The researchers use a phenomenon observed
in imploding gas bubbles that have been induced
in deuterated acetone by acoustic waves. When
the individual bubbles collapse, researchers de
tect temperature and pressure levels compatible
with a fusion event.
A series of experiments aimed at understand
ing the phenomena associated with fusion in
clude observation of neutrons and production of
tritium, the third isotope of hydrogen. Based on
such experiments, they cautiously claim observa
tion of fusion.
Donald Kennedy described the controversy in
an editorial published in the same issue of Science
that showed the report by the Oak Ridge team.
Alter accepting the manuscript for publication,
the senior science managers at Oak Ridge Na
tional Laboratory contacted the editors of Science

and urged them to delay publication of the man
uscript.
This was due to "certain reservations about the
findings and their interpretation," the managers
said. According to the editorial, Science received
two additional letters from scientists urging not to
publish. A speech by Robert Park of the American
Physical S<xiety also announced his reservations.
Science nonetheless decided to continue with
publication.
"What we are very sure of is that publication is
the right option, even — and perhaps especially
— when there is some controversy," Kennedy
said.
At Stanford, Professor and Nobel Laureate
Douglas Osheroff is aware of this controversy.
"Ifcold fusion were real it would be very excit
ing," he said. He continued to explain that in the
case of the original Pons and Fleischmann tubes,
there is a body of evidence that it likely doesn't
work.
"[They were] not getting more energy than
they put in," Osheroff said.
However, the latest controversy is a bit differ
ent, according to Osheroff . He believes that it isn't
yet cleat whether the Oak Ridge team is observ
ing the reactions they claim are occurring.
"Publishing the results as they did was a bit
premature," he said, suggesting another experi
ment that they could have performed and in
cluded in their results.
