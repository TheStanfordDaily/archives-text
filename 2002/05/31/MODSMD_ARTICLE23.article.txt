## Home-court title caps women's season 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFf 
The Stanford women's tennis team (27-1)
made good on four years of expectations
when it captured the NCAA Championship
on May 19.
"This is something we've been looking for
ward to since our freshman year when we
found out we were hosting [the Champi
onships]," senior Keiko Tokuda explained.
This year's team, led by seniors Lauren
Kalvaria, Gabriela Lastra and Tokuda, cap
tured the Cardinal's second consecutive na
tional title. For the three seniors, who helped
Stanford to a 116-4 record during their four
years, it was the third championship they have
brought back to the Farm.
This year got off to a great start, as the Car
dinal played well in individual tournaments in
the fall and entered the spring season as the
top-ranked team in the nation. However, just
as the dual match season was getting under
way, Kalvaria came down with a virus afflict
ing her vision, and the Cardinal had to shuffle
its lineup, with its No. 1 player only able to
compete in No. 3 doubles.
"The toughest moment was hitting with
Lauren and knowing that she can't really see,"
Tokuda said. "1 think that was the low point,
thinking, 'This could happen to me.' "
Without Kalvaria's presence in the lineup,
the Cardinal fell, 4-3, to nemesis Georgia on
Feb. 9 at the National Team Indoor Champi
onships in Madison, Wise.
"Had we all been healthy, it definitely
would have been a different story," Kalvaria
said at the time. "This should motivate us the
rest of the year."
How right she was.
The Cardinal, energized and determined
not to lose again, would not drop another

match. Kalvaria returned to her traditional
spot in the lineup on Feb. 15 against UNLV
with a dominating 6-0, 6-0 win over then-No.
59 Paulina Janus.
From then on, it was business as usual for
the Cardinal, which won its last 23 matches,
never surrendering three points in a match,
and surrendering two points only once.
"When the season was rolling along, we
wanted to keep winning," said head coach
Lele Forood.
For the season, the Cardinal shut out its op
ponent 14 times, including three times in the
NCAA Championships.
The Cardinal faced off against some very
tough teams in the Pacific 10 Conference, but
went an undefeated 8-0 in conference match
es to win its 15th consecutive Pac-10 title.
At the Pac-10 Individuals, Lastra won the
Singles Championship and was subsequently
named Pac-10 Player of the Year.
Fhe Cardinal breezed through the NCAA
Team Championships, defeating Sacramento
State, No. 36 Pepperdine, No. 17 Kentucky,
No. 7 North Carolina, No. 3 Georgia, and No.
1 Florida.
In the Individual Championships, fresh
man standout Erin Burdette, Kalvaria and
Lastra all earned All-American honors by ad
vancing to the round of 16 in singles, and both
Burdette and Lastra made it to the semifinals.
In doubles, Kalvaria and Lastra cruised to
the national title, capping off a partnership
and friendship that dates back to high school.
The Cardinal has celebrated its success for
a lot of reasons. For the seniors, it was impor
tant to win the title on their home courts to
wind up their collegiate careers. For every
one, it was important to avenge losses to Geor
gia — both in February of this year and in the
2000 NCAA Championship finals — and to
prove to everyone that the Cardinal, and not

Florida, Georgia or anybody else, was the No.
1 team in the nation.
"It's incredible to win it, and on your home
courts," Tokuda said. "It's been a really great
season."
Tokuda ended the season on a 23-match
winning streak. She was so efficient that she
managed to finish and win her match in all six
of Stanford's NCAA team matches. Tokuda
finished the year at 33-4, (27-1 in dual match
es), playing mostly at No. 5 singles.
Kalvaria was 23-7 (15-3 dual) playing No.
1. and Lastra ended up at 41-8 (23-3 dual),
mostly in the second flight. I n the pre-tourna
ment rankings, Kalvaria was No. 4, and Lastra
was No. 6.
Kalvaria and Lastra formed the nation's
top doubles team, going 34-3 (21-2 dual) en
route to their NCAA Doubles Championship.
Clearly, the Cardinal can't hope to instant
ly replace such tremendous production. For
next year's title defense, the Cardinal will be
bereft of seniors, with current sophomores
Emilia Anderson, Lauren Barnikowand Lizzy
Bennett being the eldest players.
However, the Cardinal was in a similar sit
uation four years ago, and look how things
have turned out for that young team.
"I'm very excited," Burdette said. "I'm not
looking at it as pressure."
Burdette crescendoed during her fresh
man campaign, as she accumulated a team
best 43 victories against only seven losses (25-
1 dual). Her No. 13 ranking will doubtlessly
improve when the final rankings are pub
lished today.
Barnikow, ranked No. 16, finished at 30-1 1
(19-5 dual) playing in the third flight.
Barnikow and Burdette will likely play
doubles together again next year. This season

Senior Gabriela Lastra strikes a powerful backhand. Lastra capped off four
years of success with a Cardinal national team title, and teamed up with
senior Lauren Kalvaria for the NCAA doubles championship.
they racked up a 33-11 (20-6 dual)
record and a No. 14 ranking.
Anderson, playing No. 6 sin
gles, came through with a 29-8
record (23-4 dual).
Other returning players in
clude Bennett (4-6 overall record,
1-0 dual), freshman Kara Guzman
(5-5 overall, 2-0 dual) and fresh
man Story Tweedie-Yates (9-4
overall, 7-1 dual), who was Toku
da's third-flight doubles partner
this year.
They all know what it takes to
be a national champion, and they
won't settle for any less next year.
"I don't think there's any rea
son why that isn't an attainable
goal for us," Burdette said. "Our
team will be able to step it up and
take care of business."
