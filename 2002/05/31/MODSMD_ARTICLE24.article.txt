# Injuries obliterate Card NCAA hopes

### JERRY LU STAFF COLUMNIST 
There comes a time in every
college student's career in which
he or she realizes how short a time
we have before moving on, and
just how precious and irreplacable
the time spent here truly is.
For elite collegiate athletes, this
realization is coupled with a sense
of urgency to achieve greatness
and to perforin in that one great
season before departing The
Farm.
A player on the men's tennis
team is constantly aware of the
pressures from the expectations
that being on a well-known cham
pionship team bring. A glance at
the outside wall of Tan be Tennis
Center recalls the glories of the
past. A look at the rosters of past
years is a list of current American
greats: John McEnroe, Jeff
Tarango and Alex O'Brien.
In the course of a long season,
one's body is physically pounded,
depleted by a seemingly endless
cycle of opponents waiting for the
team to slip off thel7-NCAA-
Championship-pulpit, waiting for
a chance to humble the mighty
Stanford.
After injuries and a stringofbad
luck, only pride is left. Pride in
one's program, pride in one'scoac,

and pride in one's self, The Cardi
nal, after all the adversity faced this
year, played with unbridled pride,
a pride transcending any accom
plishment a petty numerical mile
stone could have provided.
II anything is remembered
about this season, let it be known
that the Stanford men's tennis
team played with skill and tenacity
until the very end, and surmount
ed challenges that would have de
stroyed any lesser program.
These traits are those of the
same team that, in the beginning
of the season, confirmed their
preseason No. 2 ranking with a
thrilling victory over then-No.
Illinois in the USTA / ITA Na
tional Men's Team Indoor
Championships on Feb. 10. The
Cardinal proved that it would be
a force to be reckoned with, and a
definite contender for the NCAA
championships â€” then still more
than three months in the future.
These are the traits of the same
team that suffered a devestating
home loss to California 011 Feb.

winning streak over the Golden
Bears, as well as a 75-game home
winning streak. The Cardinal,

close loss, bounced back the next

of the Cardinal men were forced to adjust late in the season, with injuries
plaguing the squad from top to bottom.
week with a truly punishing per
formance against Utah and Santa
Clara, during a weekend of play
in which Stanford players won 17
of 18 sets in straight-set victories.
It very well might have contin
ued that way for the rest of the sea
son, but fate has a fickle way of
playing favorites. Already feeling
the effects of losing junior Carter
Morris for the year due to a bout of
mononucleosis, the Cardinal suf
fered a string of injuries to the rest
of the squad. After the April 13
game against Arizona, senior
standout K.J. Hippensteel had to
withdraw from play with recurring
back pain. What was supposed to
be a temporary injury turned out
to sideline the NCAA doubles
champion and three-time Ail-
American for the rest of the season.
The April 16 match against
Pepperdine begain a string of
close losses, but also summed up
the creed by which the team
played by. Hippensteel, junior
Ryan Haviland and freshman

Sam Warburg were all benched
with injuries that day, leaving the
Cardinal short-staffed and
prompting the forfeit of No. 3
doubles and N0.6 singles because
of lack of players.
Despite the long-odds, there
was no loss of heart, and no sur
render. Some of the squad may
have fallen, but the rest stepped
up to take their place. Sopho
more Joe Kao, thrust into No. 4
singles, and junior Scott Lipsky,
playing No. 2 singles for the first
time, both delivered victories for
the team against the waves.
Thus, the team carried on
through one of the toughest
schedules of collegiate season, tak
ing the Cardinal through Pacific
10 Conference rivals UCIA and
USC, which along with Stanford
constitute the "Big-3" of college
tennis. In both competitions, the
Stanford men still almost pulled
off victories over the top-10 teams.
Although many may consider
this a disappointing season after the
disheartening loss in the second
round of the NCAA team competi
tion against a resurgent Washing
ton team, fewer remember that two
of the four players in the individual

semifinals wore Cardinal red, and
that a Stanford team competed for
doubles honors. Although the men
walked away for the second year
without NCAA Championships,
nothing can convey the fighting
spirit that kept Stanford right in the
thick of the competition through all
adversity.
After the conclusion of the reg
ular season, Hippensteel was
voted Pac-10 player of the year,
despite missing the last two weeks
and two conference games. Hip
pensteel, the leader, lone senior
and heart of the team, was ac
corded his accolades in a fashion
that echoes the expected congrat
ulations that the entire Stanford
squad deserves.
This season, like those past,
will soon be confined to history.
There is always next season to
look forward to, and many are
encouraged by the strong charac
ter expected of the team next
year. But all those who were a
part of this rollercoaster cam
paign should be considered
champions in their own right,
and be remembered as the team
that never gave up and always
gave it I heir all.
