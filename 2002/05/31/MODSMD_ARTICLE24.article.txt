There comes a time in every
college student's career in which
he or she realizes how short a time
we have before moving on, and
just how precious and irreplacable
the time spent here truly is.
For elite collegiate athletes, this
realization is coupled with a sense
of urgency to achieve greatness
and to perforin in that one great
season before departing The
Farm.
A player on the men's tennis
team is constantly aware of the
pressures from the expectations
that being on a well-known cham
pionship team bring. A glance at

of the season, confirmed their
preseason No. 2 ranking with a
thrilling victory over then-No.

tional Men's Team Indoor
Championships on Feb. 10. The
Cardinal proved that it would be
a force to be reckoned with, and a
definite contender for the NCAA
championships â€” then still more

These are the traits of the same
team that suffered a devestating
home loss to California 011 Feb.

winning streak over the Golden
Bears, as well as a 75-game home
winning streak. The Cardinal,
