# Stanford Softball finishes season of surprises
## 
### DEBORAH SPLANSKY STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford softball season did
not end like it was supposed to this
year.
After four years of firsts, record
breaking performances and contin
ual improvement, this year's squad
reached the end of tin- season un
satisfied.
Returning to the field with the
program's first berth to the
Women's College World Series be
hind it, this year's team was deter
mined not only to make it to Okla
homa City, but also bring back a
championship.
With its goals in place, and a
team chemistry enviable by any
standards, it seemed like nothing
could stop this squad — greatness

was its destiny.
But, every year has its surprises,
and this season would be lull of
them.
Hie Cardinal's first set back was
the sidelining oftwo-time All-Amer
ican junior pitcher Dana Sorensen.
Sorensen pitched the first game of
the season, before suffering a knee
injury and red-shirting the remain
der of the year.
The loss of Sorensen in the circle
was an obvious set back, but also al
lowed fora breakout season lor
2002 Second Team All-Pacific 10
Conference pitcher Tori Nyberg, a
junior.
Nyberg finished the season with
26 .victories atul 203 strikeouts,
while posting a 1.51 ERA.
Nyberg and junior pitcher Mau
reen I iocq became the two every

day pitchers fora team that de
pended on them, and both rose to
the occasion.
"I think that as pitchers, fori
and I accomplished so much this
year from the beginning of the sea
son to how we finished," LeCocq
said. "When I)ana got hurt, I think
a lot of hopes disappeared, and to
be able to accomplish all that we did
was awesome."
However, breakthrough indi
vidual accomplishments do not end
with the Cardinal pitching staff as
junior second baseman Kira Clung
hit .333 on the year, and was named
a member to the First Team All-Pa
cific Region team.
Repeat performances of excel
lence were also recognized as senior
center fielder Jessica Mendo/a was
named as a First Team All-Arneri

can for the fourth consecutive .sea
son, the first softball player in Stan
ford history to accomplish the feat.
Also, senior first baseman Sarah
Beeson was bestowed All-Ameri
ca n status lor the third time in her
career.
However, these individual per
formances and personal bests did
not define the season, nor what the
Stanford softball program is all
about.
Although ibis year's squad did
not earn a repeat bid to the
Women's College World Series, it
did follow the same method of hard
work and togetherness — a formu
la that has become ac cepted as the
team's recipe for success.
"I think the best pan of the sea
son was the way our team came to
gether and really battled all year
long," LeCocq said." 1 think a lot of
people had doubts that we would
be successful this year, and eveiy
one really stepped up and worked
together to make it happen."
However, eveiything isn't de
pendent on hardwork, and some
times a little luck is involved as well.
The luck ran out when the post sea
son regional field was announced.
For the first time in NCAA softball
history not a single No. 1 seed or
Pac-10 squad would host a regional.
Stanford was sent to arguably
the toughest of the eight regionals
across the country .The regional
was the only one with two Pac-10
teams. The Cardinal was joined by
No. 3 seed California — the even
tual 2002 national champions.
Stanford won its first game of
the regional convincingly over a
familiar foe, the Pacific Tigers.
But, then the Cardinal suffered
two consecutive defeats — a
seven-inning battle ending in a 1 -
0 loss to the California Bears, fol
lowed by a season ending loss to
the No. 1 seed Fullerton Titans.

The Stanford softball team fin
ished with a 44-20 record, a post
season bid as a No. 2 seed and t hree
preseason tournament champi
onships — a list of accomplish
ments with which many teams
would be satisfied.
But, the Cardinal's goals have
changed over the years, and the
program that five years ago did not
have a field, can no longer be
pleased with anything, but the
highest honors college softball has
to offer.
"We fell short of our goal of a na
tional championship, which obvi
ously was disappointing," said se
nior right fielder Jessica Draemel.
"However, the Stanford softball
program now expects not only to
make a world series appearance,
but to go to Oklahoma City and win
it all."
A graduating senior, Draemel
recognizes that this season is not
the end of Stanford softball's
dream of bringing home a nation
al championship.
The Cardinal plans on utilizing
this year's season ending as motiva
tion for the future.
"We will look to next year to
improve," said junior left fielder
Cassi Brangham. "We'll learn
from this year, but our focus is
now on the future."
