The Stanford softball season did
not end like it was supposed to this
year.
After four years of firsts, record
breaking performances and contin
ual improvement, this year's squad
reached the end of tin- season un
satisfied.
Returning to the field with the
program's first berth to the
Women's College World Series be
hind it, this year's team was deter
mined not only to make it to Okla
homa City, but also bring back a
championship.
With its goals in place, and a
team chemistry enviable by any
standards, it seemed like nothing
could stop this squad — greatness

was its destiny.
But, every year has its surprises,
and this season would be lull of
them.
Hie Cardinal's first set back was
the sidelining oftwo-time All-Amer
ican junior pitcher Dana Sorensen.
Sorensen pitched the first game of
the season, before suffering a knee
injury and red-shirting the remain
der of the year.
The loss of Sorensen in the circle
was an obvious set back, but also al

2002 Second Team All-Pacific 10
Conference pitcher Tori Nyberg, a
junior.
Nyberg finished the season with
26 .victories atul 203 strikeouts,

said. "When I)ana got hurt, I think
a lot of hopes disappeared, and to
be able to accomplish all that we did
was awesome."
However, breakthrough indi
vidual accomplishments do not end
with the Cardinal pitching staff as
junior second baseman Kira Clung
hit .333 on the year, and was named
a member to the First Team All-Pa
cific Region team.
Repeat performances of excel

center fielder Jessica Mendo/a was
named as a First Team All-Arneri

can for the fourth consecutive .sea
son, the first softball player in Stan
ford history to accomplish the feat.
Also, senior first baseman Sarah
Beeson was bestowed All-Ameri
ca n status lor the third time in her
career.
However, these individual per
formances and personal bests did
not define the season, nor what the
Stanford softball program is all
about.
Although ibis year's squad did
not earn a repeat bid to the
Women's College World Series, it
did follow the same method of hard
work and togetherness — a formu

team's recipe for success.
