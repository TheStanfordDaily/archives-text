# Resident swami calls regional picks
## 
### 
It's the bracket of.death —
four top 25 teams, all of
which have been to Omaha
at least once since 1998.
Nope, it's not fair, not to Stanford
nor the other three ballclubs that
the NCAA decided to send to
Sunken Diamond. Though it's not
Marquesas, it sure sounds like
"Survivor."
But it starts today, and there's
no way around that simple fact.
Cardinal head coach Mark Mar
quess has come to terms with it

after some highly
critical venting
earlier in the
week. He knows
his opponent is
not the NCAA,
but the Cal State
Fullerton Titans,
and the best way
to shove the sheer
insanity and arro-

gance of the selection committee
back in its (ace is to win.
Surely, that task is much easier
said than done. The key to win
ning an NCAA Regional lies in
winning your first two games,
making it to Sunday with your
pitching staff intact and having
two chances to advance. Lose one
of those first two, and your week
end becomes 72 hours of hell.
Of course, the Cardinal's been
through the inferno before. Last
season, Stanford needed a gutsy
win over Marist and then two
heart-stoppers over Texas in
order to advance to Super Region
al after losing to the Longhorns
on Saturday.
This year, however, pitching is
thin. Marquess will be in a much
different situation come Saturday
if his team does not stand at 2-0,
with some veiy difficult decisions
to make.
It says here, though, that he
won't have to.
Tonight's contest, pitting all
world Jeremy Guthrie against Ti
tans ace Wes Littleton, could be
the best ballgame between a No. 1
and No. 4 seed the tournament
has ever seen in the four years of its
current format. The Titans will be
Stanford's first ranked opponents
since March, but the team's been
tested lately during conference
play and will surely be prepared
for the weekend of grueling com

petition. Stanford and Fullerton
have met eight times in the past
two seasons, including twice in
Omaha last year, so they know
each other about as well as two col
lege teams can.
With no surprises for both
clubs, I say the outcome won't be a
surprise to anyone either. While
Littleton will surely improve on his
4 2/3, 7-run outing when he faced
Guthrie in February, 1 don't think
he'll have enough to match zeroes
with the Golden Spikes Award fi
nalist that owns the hottest arm in
the nation. The right-hander
hasn't allowed a run in 19 innings
and should be fresh, as lie received
some must needed rest with a
shorter outing last weekend to fol
low up four consecutive complete
games. Stanford 3, Fullerton 1.
Here's where it gets tough. I
like San Jose State over Long
Beach State, if only because I've
seen the Spartans play this season
and know they're legitimately
scary. They pounded the Cardi
nal, 12-0, just a month ago and lost
5-4 on an eighth-inning, three-run
homer at Sunken Diamond in
April.
While all bets are off in a re
gional of this caliber, I see a Satur
day match-up between the Cardi
nal and the Spartans. Last year,
Stanford dropped this game to
Texas and had to run off three
straight in order to advance. This
time around, I think the veteran
Cardinal will break out in its most
important game of the season.
Yesterday, senior Chris O'Rior
dan said he believed tins Stanford
team has the most potential of any
he's played on at Stanford — and
lie's been to three College World
Series. It may be hard to beat the
2000 squad's trio of Jason Young,
Justin Wayne and Joe Borchard,
but this group of seniors that has
never ended a season outside of
Rosenblatt Stadium isn't about to
find out what it's like. Stanford will
crush the Spartans behind a
strong outing from junior Tim
Cunningham and roll into Sunday
needing just one more win. Stan
ford 11, San Jose State 3.
I lie Cardinal's Sunday oppo
nent is nearly impossible to pre
dict, as all three teams feature solid


Brett Kaufman
pitching and competent lineups,
but I tend to lean toward the Ti
tans. They're loose with a chip on
their shoulder after finishing the
season by getting swept by the
Beach, and despite head coach
George Horton's assurances that
his team is simply happy to be
here, they'll be ready to go.
But Sunday will prove to be the
Cardinal's day yet again. I've
never seen a regional end before
the second championship game at
Sunken Diamond, but this year 1
believe it will happen. The Sum
lord rotation is hot, and it will
carry the Cardinal through to next
weekend's Super Regionals. Stan
ford 6, FuUerton 4.
Then again, I could be wrong.

Marquesas, it sure sounds like
"Survivor."
But it starts today, and there's
no way around that simple fact.
Cardinal head coach Mark Mar
quess has come to terms with it

after some highly
critical venting
earlier in the
week. He knows
his opponent is
not the NCAA,
but the Cal State
Fullerton Titans,
and the best way
to shove the sheer
insanity and arro-

gance of the selection committee
back in its (ace is to win.
Surely, that task is much easier
said than done. The key to win
ning an NCAA Regional lies in
winning your first two games,
making it to Sunday with your
pitching staff intact and having
two chances to advance. Lose one
of those first two, and your week
end becomes 72 hours of hell.
Of course, the Cardinal's been
through the inferno before. Last
season, Stanford needed a gutsy
win over Marist and then two
heart-stoppers over Texas in
order to advance to Super Region
al after losing to the Longhorns
on Saturday.
This year, however, pitching is
thin. Marquess will be in a much
different situation come Saturday
if his team does not stand at 2-0,
with some veiy difficult decisions
to make.
It says here, though, that he
won't have to.
Tonight's contest, pitting all
world Jeremy Guthrie against Ti
tans ace Wes Littleton, could be
the best ballgame between a No. 1
and No. 4 seed the tournament
has ever seen in the four years of its
current format. The Titans will be
Stanford's first ranked opponents
since March, but the team's been
tested lately during conference
play and will surely be prepared
for the weekend of grueling com

petition. Stanford and Fullerton
have met eight times in the past
two seasons, including twice in
Omaha last year, so they know
each other about as well as two col
lege teams can.
With no surprises for both
clubs, I say the outcome won't be a
surprise to anyone either. While
Littleton will surely improve on his
4 2/3, 7-run outing when he faced
Guthrie in February, 1 don't think
he'll have enough to match zeroes
with the Golden Spikes Award fi
nalist that owns the hottest arm in
the nation. The right-hander
hasn't allowed a run in 19 innings
and should be fresh, as lie received
some must needed rest with a
shorter outing last weekend to fol
low up four consecutive complete
games. Stanford 3, Fullerton 1.
Here's where it gets tough. I
like San Jose State over Long
Beach State, if only because I've
seen the Spartans play this season
and know they're legitimately
scary. They pounded the Cardi
nal, 12-0, just a month ago and lost
5-4 on an eighth-inning, three-run
homer at Sunken Diamond in
April.
While all bets are off in a re
gional of this caliber, I see a Satur
day match-up between the Cardi
nal and the Spartans. Last year,
Stanford dropped this game to
Texas and had to run off three
straight in order to advance. This
time around, I think the veteran
Cardinal will break out in its most
important game of the season.
Yesterday, senior Chris O'Rior
dan said he believed tins Stanford
team has the most potential of any
he's played on at Stanford — and
lie's been to three College World
Series. It may be hard to beat the
2000 squad's trio of Jason Young,
Justin Wayne and Joe Borchard,
but this group of seniors that has
never ended a season outside of
Rosenblatt Stadium isn't about to
find out what it's like. Stanford will
crush the Spartans behind a
strong outing from junior Tim
Cunningham and roll into Sunday
needing just one more win. Stan
ford 11, San Jose State 3.
I lie Cardinal's Sunday oppo
nent is nearly impossible to pre
dict, as all three teams feature solid


Brett Kaufman
pitching and competent lineups,
but I tend to lean toward the Ti
tans. They're loose with a chip on
their shoulder after finishing the
season by getting swept by the
Beach, and despite head coach
George Horton's assurances that
his team is simply happy to be
here, they'll be ready to go.
But Sunday will prove to be the
Cardinal's day yet again. I've
never seen a regional end before
the second championship game at
Sunken Diamond, but this year 1
believe it will happen. The Sum
lord rotation is hot, and it will
carry the Cardinal through to next
weekend's Super Regionals. Stan
ford 6, FuUerton 4.
Then again, I could be wrong.

Brett Kaufman is a junior majoring in
International Relations and Spanish.
Knock on wood.
