Of the 13 Stanford women's
track team athletes competing in
the NCAA Championships at Lou
siana State University, five made
their mark on Wednesday's com
petition.
Junior Kathleen Donoghue
highlighted Stanford's first day of
competition, capturing All-Ameri
can honors in the pole vault by fin
ishing fourth among 20 competi
tors. Donoghue cleared the bar at
13 feet, 1.5 inches, while Tracy
O'Hara of UCLA won the NCAA
title with her vault of 13-5.25. With
this impressive end to her 2002
season, Donoghue becomes the
first Stanford athlete to earn two
time Ail-American honors in the
outdoor pole vault.
Senior Ashley Wysong finished
sixth in the first heat of the 800 me
ters with a time of 2 minutes, 7.7
seconds. Although she did not
qualify for Friday's 800-meter
final, Wysong concludes her Car
dinal career as Stanford's second
all-time leading 800-meter run
ner.
A transfer from Missouri State
University, Wysong burst onto the
Stanford scene to challenge the
longtime school record of 2:04.38
set by Regina Jacobs in 1982.
Wysong's career best, an NCAA
qualifying time 0f2:04.75, was just
shy of usurping the longtime
record.
Both junior Erin Sullivan and
senior Caroline Annis competed
for the Cardinal in the 10,000 me
ters. With the competitors tightly
bunched in the first 5,000 meters,
the heat and humidity took its toll
on the runners, which spread the
field in the second half of the race.
Kristin Price of North Carolina
Suite won with a time of 34 min
utes, 26.63 seconds. 2002 Pacific
10 Conference champion Sullivan
placed tenth with 35:06.7, while
runner-up 2002 Pac-10 champion
Annis finished 13th with a time of

35:23.69.
After a break through freshman
season, sophomore Jessica Pluth
remains one of Stanford's all-time
throwers in the hammer. In
Wednesday's competition, Pluth
finished 15th with a throw of 185
feet, 4 inches. Her season-best and
NCAA qualifying throw was 196

the 1,500 meter preliminaries. Se
nior Maurica Carlucci took third
in her heat at 4:17.00 to move on
to the finals, but junior Malindi El
more's time of 4:20.18 was not
good enough for her to advance.
