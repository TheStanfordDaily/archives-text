Of the 13 Stanford women's
track team athletes competing in
the NCAA Championships at Lou
siana State University, five made
their mark on Wednesday's com
petition.
Junior Kathleen Donoghue
highlighted Stanford's first day of
competition, capturing All-Ameri
can honors in the pole vault by fin
ishing fourth among 20 competi
tors. Donoghue cleared the bar at
13 feet, 1.5 inches, while Tracy
O'Hara of UCLA won the NCAA
title with her vault of 13-5.25. With
this impressive end to her 2002
season, Donoghue becomes the
first Stanford athlete to earn two
time Ail-American honors in the
outdoor pole vault.
Senior Ashley Wysong finished
sixth in the first heat of the 800 me
ters with a time of 2 minutes, 7.7
seconds. Although she did not
qualify for Friday's 800-meter
final, Wysong concludes her Car
dinal career as Stanford's second
all-time leading 800-meter run
ner.
A transfer from Missouri State
University, Wysong burst onto the
Stanford scene to challenge the
longtime school record of 2:04.38
set by Regina Jacobs in 1982.
Wysong's career best, an NCAA
qualifying time 0f2:04.75, was just
shy of usurping the longtime
record.
Both junior Erin Sullivan and
senior Caroline Annis competed
for the Cardinal in the 10,000 me
ters. With the competitors tightly
bunched in the first 5,000 meters,
the heat and humidity took its toll
on the runners, which spread the
field in the second half of the race.
Kristin Price of North Carolina
Suite won with a time of 34 min
utes, 26.63 seconds. 2002 Pacific
10 Conference champion Sullivan
placed tenth with 35:06.7, while
runner-up 2002 Pac-10 champion
Annis finished 13th with a time of

35:23.69.
After a break through freshman
season, sophomore Jessica Pluth
remains one of Stanford's all-time
throwers in the hammer. In
Wednesday's competition, Pluth
finished 15th with a throw of 185
feet, 4 inches. Her season-best and
NCAA qualifying throw was 196
feet.

high jump finals with a top mark of
5-7.25.

to the 3,000-meter steeplechase fi
nals after coming in sixth
(10:07.77) in her preliminary heat
yesterday.
Stanford had mixed results in
the 1,500 meter preliminaries. Se
nior Maurica Carlucci took third
in her heat at 4:17.00 to move on
to the finals, but junior Malindi El
more's time of 4:20.18 was not
good enough for her to advance.
Men's Track
Stanford earned its first points
at the NCAA Championships from
a strong showing in the 10,000-
meter finals yesterday.
Sophomore Louis Luchini
picked up four points for the Car
dinal with a fifth-place finish at
29:29.70. Junior Adam Tenforde
was two spots back, picking up an
other two points for Stanford with

of the North American Sailing Championships in Keehi Lagoon, Hawaii.

Sophomore Jillian Camarena heaves the shot put. Camarena is one of 13
Stanford women competing at the NCAA championships this week in Baton
Rouge.
today.
The field was very closely
packed, with all 12 qualifiers fin
ishing within ten seconds of the
winner.
Sailing
For most students spending
the critical end of the quarter
crunch period on a sailboat in
Hawaii seems like little more than
wishful thinking. However, for
the Stanford women's sailing
team, finals are put on the back
burner as it competes against the
top collegiate teams in the coun
try in the North American Cham

pionships in Keehi Lagoon,
Hawaii.
Despite inconsistent winds on
Wednesday's opening day, the
Cardinal finished in 10th place
with 105 points, after the first 12
races of the three-day com
petion.
Sailing is scored on a point sys
tem, with faster times nabbing
lower total points. While the Stan
ford women had several strong
races in both the A-I)ivision and
the B-Division, the wind condi
tions forced them to put up some
high numbers as well.
"It was not a consistent day for
anyone," said junior captain Kara
Sweeney of the day's racing.
To adapt to the changing con
ditions, the Cardinal subbed vari
ous athletes in and out of the A I)i

vison and B Division boats.
Sophomores Jen Porter and Jess
Gray combined to lead off in the A
Division, while freshman Ashley
Frush and sophomore Jenais
Zarlin started off in the B Division.
In the third and fourth races, ju
niors Sarah Zukerman and
Sweeney subbed in in the A and B
Division, respectively. Zarlin
closed out the B Division's fifth
and sixth races.
Old Dominion led the field, tal
lying only 45 points in Wednes
day's competion.
With 24 races left to go, Stan
ford looks to move up in the
standings.
"Everyone's stepping up, and
we definitely haven't filled in
everything we have," said
Sweeney.
