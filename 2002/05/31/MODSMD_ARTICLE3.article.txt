# New Bon Appetit contract ups workers' wages
## 
### MARK BOUCHER ELIZABETH MADJLESSI 
Just before midnight yesterday, the union repre
senting workers for Bon Appetit completed negotia
tions on a new contract that will set wages at the same
level as workers for Stanford Dining Services.
"They've been in negotiations since 1 p.m. and they
just reached a tentative agreement that still needs to be
voted on by the workers," said Zev Kvitky, president of
United Stanford Workers. "I am sure they will support
the agreement."
The wage parity will be phased in over two years,
meaning that after two years, wages for workers at Bon
Appetit will be the same as those for workers at Stan
ford Dining Services and will remain that way. In ad
dition, the monthly cost of health benefits and dental
benefits for Bon Appetit workers was reduced.
"It's not exactly what we were asking for, but we got
everything that is important to us," Kvitky said. "I'm
very pleased with the outcome."
Amid hugs and upbeat Mexican music, 70 students,
including members of the Coalition for Labor Justice,
celebrated this outcome in the Main Quad.
Having slept out since Monday in support of high
er wages for union workers, members of the coalition
were ecstatic.
"This is amazingly unbelievable," said freshman
Anna Mumford, a member of the Stanford Labor Ac
tion Coalition, which has supported the union during
the negotiations. "Students really came together to get

what we want from the University
... It's a huge victory we did not re
ally expect to get," Mumford said.
Several workers from Bon Ap
petit congregated in the midst of
the 23 tents set up for the sleep out.
Among them was Danielle Ma
hones, a union negotiator.
"I am very, very happy," Ma
hones said. "I want to thank all of
the students who supported us

throughout the campaign. With
out their work, we wouldn't be
able to accomplish all of this."
The negotiators managed to
add several benefits to the con
tracts as well.
"On all of the important issues,
we won. We have health insurance
and a wage parity," said Maria Es
tela Diaz, a Bon Appetit worker at
the Graduate School of Business.
"The good thing about us winning
is that we can make sure everyone
comes out of poverty. We also won
an extra personal day off."
The festivities also attracted a

number of students not explicitly
involved in the coalition.
Junior Jatzin Alvarado said she
came "to celebrate all the huge ef
forts the students put forward and
to support them for their accom
plishments."
Earlier yesterday, members of
the Coalition for Labor Justice had
handed out informational packets
outside the Faculty Senate meet
ing about their campaign and
about the negotiations.
"It's another way to pressure
[University President John] Hen
nessy," said Mumford.

"We've certainly had a few dis
cussions with Bon Appetit," said
Hennessy. "But we've avoided in
terfering with the negotiations. We
think they are best settled by the
union and Bon Appetit."
According to Mumford, a fur
ther rationale for handing out the
packets was to educate the faculty
and to gather faculty support for
their campaign.
Those participating in the camp
out said they planned to take down
their tents because they were satis
fied with the settlement that was
reached.
