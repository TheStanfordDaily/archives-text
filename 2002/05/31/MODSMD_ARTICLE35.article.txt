### KAREEM GHANEM ANTHONY HA 
In this final issue of Intermission, we hope to
evoke that latent part of all of your personalities
that continually asks questions — that inquisitive,
restless part of your souls that demands an elusive
answer to an important conundrum. The ques
tion? You already know what that is.
"How can I impress women (or men, or both, as
it were) and earn their sweet, sweet lovin'?"
As Intermission editors, we are taking this final
opportunity to respond to the pained, desperate
call of the masses. We may not be individually
qualified to guide you through your romantic tra
vails. Frankly, even our combined experiences
don't account for much.
That is why we have assembled the greatest,
most talented, most sexually astute troupe of war

rior-writers this side of the Rio Grande to assist us
in shining light upon the elements that add to
gether to make the perfect date.
In this week's issue, you will find several pro
files of restaurants, bakeries and other places to
take your love interest on a first date. A perfect
date wouldn't be complete without the appropri
ate music, though. To that end, we've compiled a
list of the finest songs for any romantic occasion:
cuddling, hanging out, kissing, having sex, mak
ing love or fucking like rabid monkeys.
And when it comes to that last activity, you're
probably at a loss for ideas of places to go, unless
you enjoy it when your roommate watch it. That's
why you're reading this, right? We here at Inter
mission predicted that far in advance and compiled
a collection of excellent places at which to bring the
night to perfect fruition, again and again.

That's not all, though! As you page through this
issue, keep your eyes peeled for suggestions for al
ternative date activities, potential date movies and
advice on excellent (and not-so-excellent) places to
pick people up. Additionally, the irreplaceable
Roxy Sass (well, there'll be another Roxy Sass next
year, but . . . you know what we mean) graces the
pages of this issue with her final words to Stan
ford's adoring masses before graduating. Be sure
that you don't miss out on this important, beauti
ful, even historic moment.
Let it be a final farewell from us to you — a
"thank you" to those of you who read this paper,
an enduring kiss good-bye, a light pat on the ass
before you leave our tender care and enter that
harsh jungle that is the world of romantic interac
tion.
Good luck, kids.
