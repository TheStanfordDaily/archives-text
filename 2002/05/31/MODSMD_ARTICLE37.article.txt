Steeped in American dating tradition, the movies
remain the destination of choice for most couples
seeking to spend some time together. Hut instead of
heading to the local cineplex for your next first
date, why not stay in and get cozy away from prying
eyes? These suggested romantic flicks from our
writers are bound to turn your ordinary date into
something more memorable.
When you decide to watch a movie fora date,
you can always take the cute, safe romantic
comedy route. But much more exciting (and
more likely to lead to bodily contact or grop
ing) is a good horror movie. Rent "Hal
loween" or "What Lies Beneath" and they
will give you a reason to move m closer and
clench each other. In the end, you'll be happy
you passed up the traditional John Cusack
film when your date asks you to stay the
night, and the two of you start coming up
with creative ways to rid your minds of the
horrible killer.

A great movie for breaking the ice,
"Labyrinth" makes fora nice evening in, fea
turing crazy muppets, fantastical locales, a
few creepy scenes and David Bowie prancing
around and singing as the "Goblin King." Any
girl or boy born in the early '80s should love
this one.

"Amelie" is a playful film that makes fora perfect
date for an established couple. The film features light,
clever dialogue and humor, beautiful Paris and two
whimsical lovebirds falling for one another in a most
romantic way.

"America's Sweethearts" was absolutely terrible. Just
wretched. So wretched, in fact, that my girlfriend and
I can't actuallv say we've really seen the whole movie.

One lazy evening, we rented it from Blockbuster and
spent most of the two hours talking, making fun of the
movie and getting cuddly. So, I guess it was good for
something after all.

Many might disregard this suggestion as that
of a bona fide music geek. 1 wouldn't exactly
blame you. But I suggest that you try John
Cusack's "High Fidelity" fora romantic
night in. It's an amusing, self-deprecating
and wistful film, featuring John Cusack play
ing more-or-less the same guy he plays in
every movie, except that in this one, he owns
a record store and hangs out with two music
snobs who keep the film constantly enter
taining. The one played by Jack Black almost
steals the show from Cusack. It's almost
enough to forgive Cusack for ever starring in
"America's Sweethearts" and "Serendipity."

This may seem a little strange, but I think
that Ingmar Bergman's "The Seventh Seal"
is a wonderful date movie. Sure, it may be a
little bit of a downer, but it's a brilliant film.
Hey, life ain't always love and lollipops.
More to the point, when you're confronted
by the vast indifference of God, well, then
they only thing left to do is make out franti
cally.
Woody Allen's sweetly melancholy "Annie
Hall" is the best relationship movie that
I've ever seen. Everyone can identify little
bits of themselves in Allen's neurotic Alvy
and Diane Keaton's warm, naive Annie, and
the inevitable laughter at the scene in which
the couple's nervous thoughts are juxta
posed with their "deep" conversation is the
laughter of pained, bemused recognition.
In the final scene, when Alvy concludes that
for all the hurt and heartbreak, relation
ships are still worth it because "I need the
eggs" (uh, it makes more sense in context),
you and your date will hug each other just a
little bit tighter.

The second season of "Buffy the VampiFe Slay
er," the most swooningly romantic show on
television, hits DVD on June 11. And yes, I have
been counting the days. This is the season
where "Buffy" really took off, and there's some
thing here for everyone: angst, romance, sharp
dialogue, kick-ass action, hot girls and hot guys.
Episodes like "Surprise" and "Innocence," cen
tering on the doomed relationship between
vampire slayer Buffy and cursed vampire
Angel, are perfect cuddling material. If your
date doesn't burst into tears at the end of "Be
coming," the heartbreaking season finale,
you'll know that that she's a cold, heartless
bitch.

The risk of recommending a date movie is that 1
will just recommend a movie that I really like, re
gardless of whether or not it's actually a good
date movie. 1 think that is exactly what 1 am
about to do to you now, my adoring, mewling lit
tle public. Still, "Shaolin Soccer" rocks the
house. It's got tough-luck kung-fu masters who,
teamed with a crippled former soccer star, form
the awesome-est soccer team you will ever see.
It's hilarious and wonderful, and if you hate
your date (as many of us are fated to), you can
focus on the movie. If not, you can always find
time to slap some booty and make it jiggly with
laughter.

Honeychunks, the best movies are the ones you make
yourself. You know what I mean.


Buffy rules!


John Cusack plays the same guy in every movie.


Only marginally weirder than Ziggy Stardust,
