# Hit the sweet spot?

### MARISA TAYLOR 
If you are looking fora sophisticated
evening in the city with your love interest,
try Citizen Cake for dessert. While a bit re
moved from the more popular nightlife
destinations in North Beach or the Mis
sion, Citizen Cake is a quiet, romantic and
chic San Francisco spot in which to impress
a date.
With high ceilings, wood-paneled walls,
Christmas lights and subtle jazz music, Cit
izen Cake has a calm, comfortable am
biance and is frequented by an attractive,
well-dressed 20- and 30-something crowd.
Our server, John, the general manager,
was very friendly and explained to us that
all of their desserts are homemade with
fresh ingredients by executive pastry chef
Elizabeth Falkner.
My date and 1 sampled the restaurant's
dessert specialty, a rose petal creme brulee
($7.50) that was light, sugary and fluffy.
We also tried the chocolate chip mania
($9.00): a thin Blondie topped with a de
lectable homemade brown sugar-chocolate
crunch ice cream, chocolate puff pastry, a
douse of fresh whipped cream and artfully
decorated with dots of chocolate syrup.
Also notable on the menu was a panna
cotta made with goat's milk served with

rhubarb and a rose-geranium sorbet, as
well as a "forbidden parfait" of coconut
tapioca, Thai spice sorbet and banana co
conut ice cream. My date and I enjoyed the
interesting, unorthodox combinations of
flavors that Falkner chose to utilize on her

dessert menu.
While Citizen Cake does not yet have a
full liquor license, its menu features a small
selection of local and French wines, as well
as a wide range of espresso drinks.
Citizen Cake also has a take-out counter
in which one can walk in to pick up cakes,
tarts, cookies, homemade ice cream and
fresh breads on almost any day of the week.

The restaurant is best known for its
innovative dessert menu, but Citizen
Cake also has a dinner menu featur
ing such mouth-watering options as
Alaskan halibut served with ginger
and lemongrass as well as Chesa
peake soft shell crab.
Citizen Cake's only drawback is its
rather exorbitan! prices; for the tiny
little tastes of dessert that we or
dered, we felt that the bill was a bit
steep. So if you are not sure you like
your date enough to schlep him or
her up to the city and spend a lot of
cash, perhaps you should save this
spot for someone with whom you are

more enamored.
Citizen Cake is located in San Francisco at 399
Grove Street and is open until 10 p.m. on Tues
day through Sunday evenings.


Careful your date doesn't eat too much of this.


Kinda like William Faulkner, except not.
