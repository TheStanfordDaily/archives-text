# Fac Sen delays AP credit talks
## 
### JENNIFER KONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Two standing committees of the Faculty Senate —
the Committee of Academic Appraisal and Achieve
ment and the Committee on Undergraduate Admis
sion and Financial Aid — have introduced proposals
that would reduce the number of Advanced Placement
units undergraduates can count towards the 180 units
required to graduate.
The senate was originally scheduled to fully address
the issue at a meeting last night but instead decided to
defer discussion to the fall.
Under the current system, students can use up to 45
AP units to fulfill part of the 180-unit graduation re
quirement.
ITle academic committee has proposed that the
number of countable units be reduced to 15, while the
admission committee has suggested that no AP units be
counted as credit.
According to Committee of Academic Appraisal and
Achievement Chair Robert Hall, an economics profes
sor and a Hoover Institution senior fellow, the current
system provides unfair advantages to students who ex
tensively use AP units towards graduation.
"A minority of students are able to get through Stan-
ford with reduced course loads by
applying up to a year of AP units,"
Hall said. "This situation is unfair
to the majority who take full
loads."
Hall stressed that while the two
committees have called fora de
crease in the number of AP units
that can be used towards gradua
tion, this change would not affect
the use of AP test scores in class
placement. Placement into high
er-level classes is the "important
role" of AP testing, Hall said.
Overall, student reaction to
the proposed changes has been
negative, according to a March

survey conducted by student rep
resentatives on the committees.
Solicited through e-mails,
1259 responses were received.
ASSU President Monica Hene
stroza, a junior, said that this is an
especially high turnout for an on
line survey and indicates stu
dents' "investment" in die issue.
The survey reported that
more than a third of students use
AP units as credit for such reasons
as lightening course loads, reduc
ing stress, studying abroad and
relieving financial burdens. 'Hie
report concluded that most stu
dents have effectively used units
to "augment" and "not under
mine" their Stanford education.
According to the data, 72 per
cent of respondents expressed
opposition to a proposal to cut AP

units for credit to 15 and about 89
percent opposed eliminating all
AP credit.
Student responses have not
been given enough considera
tion, Henestroza said.
"While students are the prixna
iy stakeholders and have offered
themselves as resources for evalu
ating and refining unit policies,
the committees as a whole have
not matched our efforts," Hene
stroza said. "I urge members of
the Faculty Senate to consider
student feedback when they
vote."
Senior Elizabeth Aab, an ad
mission committee student rep
resentative, voiced similar con
cerns. If the University were to
implement a new policy, she said,
the administration should hold

focus groups or find some other
way to accommodate students
who might be negatively affected.
She cited as an example engi
neering students, many of whom
she said already find it difficult to
graduate in four years and who
use AP units to alleviate their
course loads.
Eric Roberts, senior associate
dean of the School of Engineer
ing and a member of the senate,
also expressed resei-vation about
changes, citing concerns that sev
eral issues have yet to be ad
dressed, such as Stanford's attrac
tiveness to potential students.
"112 think the delay [in discus
sion] is valuable because diere are
several concerns that many of us
have not yet had an opportunity
to think through," Roberts said.
