# Play these tunes on the jukebox and you'll be all hers
## 
### 
Ah, music — the soundtrack of our lives.
And really, when are you in greater need of a
soundtrack than those moments of wild aban
donment, when you and your special someone
have your arms wrapped around each other
and you find yourself trapped deep in his or
her, uh, eyes? When the two of you are getting
funky, shouldn't there be something funky
playing in the background? If you've met with
failure time and time again trying to get it on
to the strains of "What's Up Pussycat?" Limp
Bizkit's "Break Stuff," Creed's "With Arms
Wide Open" or anything by Kenny G, fret
not! Just pop one of these babies into the CD
player and "Porn Grooves" will be playing in
your head in no time.

Dave Matthews Band, "Crash" — Aside
from the sexy guitar melody, the tune
turns purely pornographic lyrics into
poetry. It makes the words "Hike up
your skirt a little more / And show your
world to me" so erotic, and yet so per
fectly romantic at the same time. Be
sides, what college student isn't a sucker
for Dave Matthews these days? [Editor's
Mote: £/s.]
— ERICK FLORES
Prince, "Purple Rain" — If this doesn't
get your motor running, I don't know
what will. A total make-out record,
Prince keeps it hot and delivers the slow
jams, all indue time. Put this one on re
peat for "extended listening pleasure."
Nat King Cole, "Mis Mejores Can
ciones" — This beautiful, beautiful
album includes "Aquellos Ojos Verdes,"
"Quizas, Quizas, Quizas" and others
sung in broken Spanish by the unrivaled
crooner Cole. Dripping with r-o-m-a-n
-c-e from start to finish, this album will
keep the mood right for the entire
evening.
— RYAN SANDS
"Smooth Grooves Vol. 1: A Sensual

Collection" — When you're making
love, the music should have an irre
sistible bass line, a passionate melody
and a steady beat. Basically the record
should be smooth and it should groove.
Therefore "Smooth Grooves Volume
1: A Sensual Collection" will relieve
anyone struggling to secure the bone.
Not only does every one of the collec
tion's 12 artists convey some sort of
lovemaking message, but they were
also all actually making love during the
recording sessions. If Earth, Wind and
Fire's "Reasons," the album's opening
track, doesn't induce pant dropping,
then the Manhattans' version of "Shin
ing Star" most definitely will. And if

you're not knee deep in the love
game by track nine, Average White
Band's "A Love Of Your Own," then
the music ain't the problem. Oh,
and in case classic soul doesn't suit
your mate, try Air's "Moon Safari"
— contemporary French ambient
pop that stinks of sex.
— BENJAMIN L. FRIEDLAND
Tool, "Aenima" — Moody sex for
angry people, sad people and drama
queens. Not to be confused with anal
cleansing enemas, which in my per
sonal experience are not nearly as
exciting. Good songs include "H."
and "Stinkfist" (both radio singles).
But really, if you want to have good
sex, one or two songs are not going
to do it. You should let the whole
album run through. Luckily these
songs are the first few tracks, so you
can sing along before you start
breathing too heavily. If you need
more to get you started, the album
comes with holograms of naked peo
ple in obscene positions.

— KIM SAMEK
Marvin Gaye, "Let's Get It On" — Is
this an obvious choice? Some may think
so. But if any single one of you out there
doubts the inherent sexiness of the man
named Marvin Gaye, then I challenge

you to listen to play this song fora date.
One thing is certain: the song will get
your point across to whoever you're
with. For that reason, you might want to
hold off on this one until you've estab
lished some semblance of a relationship.
Extra bonus love points if you have a
turntable and an old vinyl copy of this
record — it's just sexier that way. You
can listen the whole way through the
album which also includes "Distant
Lover," a song sure to bring you closer
together. Just try not to think of your
parents in polyester clothes, having sex
to this record. You know they did.
The Ramones, "I Wanna Be Your
Boyfriend" — It seems as if three-quar
ters of all the Ramones' songs were
about love in some way or another: quite
a remarkable feat fora punk band. This
one is one of the band's sweetest,
though. Featured on the group's debut
album, it showcases Joey, Johnny, Dee
Dee and Tommy's sensitive side. It can
do the same for you too if you play it for
your love interest at the right time.
My Bloody Valentine, "We Have All
The Time In The World" — No one re
ally knows what this band is singing in its
songs. That doesn't really matter,
though, because My Bloody Valentine's

songs have never been about lyrics;
they're about mood and emotion. This
song has an airy, fresh and lovely feeling
to it. With string arrangements layered
over distorted vocals, it is sure to create
a perfect romantic haze around you and
your date.
— KAREEM GHANEM
The Sex Pistols, "Sub Mission" —
Johnny Rotten's hymn to cunnilingus
should inspire you when it's time to
dive.
Nine Inch Nails, "Head Like A Hole"
or "Closer" — These are perfect for
anyone who likes it rough.
Garbage, "Queer" — Shirley Manson
has the sexiest voice in the world and
when she sings, "Let me dirty up your
mind," chills run down my spine
The Cure, "Just Like Heaven" — Be
cause when you're with your ladylove, it
should be.
The Beatles, "I Want To Hold Your
Hand" — But only if you're really, real
ly twisted.
— ANTHONY HA

have your arms wrapped around each other
and you find yourself trapped deep in his or
her, uh, eyes? When the two of you are getting
funky, shouldn't there be something funky
playing in the background? If you've met with
failure time and time again trying to get it on
to the strains of "What's Up Pussycat?" Limp
Bizkit's "Break Stuff," Creed's "With Arms
Wide Open" or anything by Kenny G, fret
not! Just pop one of these babies into the CD
player and "Porn Grooves" will be playing in
your head in no time.

Dave Matthews Band, "Crash" — Aside
from the sexy guitar melody, the tune
turns purely pornographic lyrics into
poetry. It makes the words "Hike up
your skirt a little more / And show your
world to me" so erotic, and yet so per
fectly romantic at the same time. Be
sides, what college student isn't a sucker
for Dave Matthews these days? [Editor's
Mote: £/s.]
— ERICK FLORES
Prince, "Purple Rain" — If this doesn't
get your motor running, I don't know
what will. A total make-out record,
Prince keeps it hot and delivers the slow
jams, all indue time. Put this one on re
peat for "extended listening pleasure."
Nat King Cole, "Mis Mejores Can
ciones" — This beautiful, beautiful
album includes "Aquellos Ojos Verdes,"
"Quizas, Quizas, Quizas" and others
sung in broken Spanish by the unrivaled
crooner Cole. Dripping with r-o-m-a-n
-c-e from start to finish, this album will
keep the mood right for the entire
evening.
— RYAN SANDS
"Smooth Grooves Vol. 1: A Sensual

Collection" — When you're making
love, the music should have an irre
sistible bass line, a passionate melody
and a steady beat. Basically the record
should be smooth and it should groove.
Therefore "Smooth Grooves Volume
1: A Sensual Collection" will relieve
anyone struggling to secure the bone.
Not only does every one of the collec
tion's 12 artists convey some sort of
lovemaking message, but they were
also all actually making love during the
recording sessions. If Earth, Wind and
Fire's "Reasons," the album's opening
track, doesn't induce pant dropping,
then the Manhattans' version of "Shin
ing Star" most definitely will. And if

you're not knee deep in the love
game by track nine, Average White
Band's "A Love Of Your Own," then
the music ain't the problem. Oh,
and in case classic soul doesn't suit
your mate, try Air's "Moon Safari"
— contemporary French ambient
pop that stinks of sex.
— BENJAMIN L. FRIEDLAND
Tool, "Aenima" — Moody sex for
angry people, sad people and drama
queens. Not to be confused with anal
cleansing enemas, which in my per
sonal experience are not nearly as
exciting. Good songs include "H."
and "Stinkfist" (both radio singles).
But really, if you want to have good
sex, one or two songs are not going
to do it. You should let the whole
album run through. Luckily these
songs are the first few tracks, so you
can sing along before you start
breathing too heavily. If you need
more to get you started, the album
comes with holograms of naked peo
ple in obscene positions.

— KIM SAMEK
Marvin Gaye, "Let's Get It On" — Is
this an obvious choice? Some may think
so. But if any single one of you out there
doubts the inherent sexiness of the man
named Marvin Gaye, then I challenge

you to listen to play this song fora date.
One thing is certain: the song will get
your point across to whoever you're
with. For that reason, you might want to
hold off on this one until you've estab
lished some semblance of a relationship.
Extra bonus love points if you have a
turntable and an old vinyl copy of this
record — it's just sexier that way. You
can listen the whole way through the
album which also includes "Distant
Lover," a song sure to bring you closer
together. Just try not to think of your
parents in polyester clothes, having sex
to this record. You know they did.
The Ramones, "I Wanna Be Your
Boyfriend" — It seems as if three-quar
ters of all the Ramones' songs were
about love in some way or another: quite
a remarkable feat fora punk band. This
one is one of the band's sweetest,
though. Featured on the group's debut
album, it showcases Joey, Johnny, Dee
Dee and Tommy's sensitive side. It can
do the same for you too if you play it for
your love interest at the right time.
My Bloody Valentine, "We Have All
The Time In The World" — No one re
ally knows what this band is singing in its
songs. That doesn't really matter,
though, because My Bloody Valentine's

songs have never been about lyrics;
they're about mood and emotion. This
song has an airy, fresh and lovely feeling
to it. With string arrangements layered
over distorted vocals, it is sure to create
a perfect romantic haze around you and
your date.
— KAREEM GHANEM
The Sex Pistols, "Sub Mission" —
Johnny Rotten's hymn to cunnilingus
should inspire you when it's time to
dive.
Nine Inch Nails, "Head Like A Hole"
or "Closer" — These are perfect for
anyone who likes it rough.
Garbage, "Queer" — Shirley Manson
has the sexiest voice in the world and
when she sings, "Let me dirty up your
mind," chills run down my spine
The Cure, "Just Like Heaven" — Be
cause when you're with your ladylove, it
should be.
The Beatles, "I Want To Hold Your
Hand" — But only if you're really, real
ly twisted.
— ANTHONY HA


The sexiest voice in the world?


Dreaming up new forms of sexual healing


Before they started doing acid.
Ah, music — the soundtrack of our lives.
And really, when are you in greater need of a
soundtrack than those moments of wild aban
donment, when you and your special someone
have your arms wrapped around each other
and you find yourself trapped deep in his or
her, uh, eyes? When the two of you are getting
funky, shouldn't there be something funky
