# Marisa goes on the date...from Hell!
## 
### MARISA TAYLOR 
1 think that the world needs to hear about the horrible date
that I now affectionately call "the attack of the lecherous Lat
ter-Day-Saint," not only for the sheer entertainment value it
delivers, but also for the priceless lesson that can be gleaned
from it: Never, ever trust a guy who wears brown burlap and
tells you it's cashmere.
My drawmates and I were all going to the Row Formal in
Santa Cruz and, frustrated with our lack of attractive or inter
esting male options, decided that we would set each other up
with hot, new male blood. While I should have known better
than to attempt to seek spontaneous romance on the Stanford
campus, the idea of being set up on a blind date of sorts felt ex
citing. One of my drawmates had a friend who, for die sake of
anonymity, I will call Randy. I had met him a few times when
he had come over to our house and I thought he was pretty
cute, so my friend agreed to set us up.
Randy's one drawback was that he was Mormon, meaning
that he would not want to imbibe on the bus with the rest of us,
but 1 figured that that would mean a) fie was probably a very
courteous, gentlemanly guy and b) I would not have to worn'
about my date getting drunk and trying to pull any scandalous
moves on me.
It turned out that I couldn't have been more off the mark.

My first clue at what a strange guy Randy was and how
horrible the night would turn out came when he arrived.
Rat her than looking into my eyes directly, Randy would
kind of turn his head and look at me out of the corner of
his eyes with a creepy stare. He reminded me of a fish in
that he actually seemed to prefer looking at people from
a side view. Chalking up this oddity to his possible ner
vousness, I decided to take him outside and introduce
him to everyone at the pre-party we were throwing on
our house's balcony.
It was then that 1 noticed what he was wearing. I had
decided to get decked out in my most pimped-out for
mal gear: my strapless paisley disco clress, brown snake
skin high heels and fur-trimmed camel coat. A bit over
the top, yes, but I felt that I looked pretty hot. However,
Randy was donning an ensemble that was quite strange.
While the other men at the party were wearing the trite
but traditional cornflower blue button-downs and ties
that were appropriate for spring, Randy was wearing a
heavy, dark brown suit made of burlap-like fabric that
looked as if it could have been woven on a loom by my
Mennonite ancestors. When one of my friends com
mented (in earnest) that his suit was very interesting,
Randy boasted that it was cashmere. While I am no expert

on male fashion, I am pretty sure that there is no such thing as
a cashmere suit. And if there were, I have the feeling that it
would not be so brown and bizarre looking.
On the bus, we chatted a bit and got to know each other a
little better. As a general rule, I have found that no matter how
shy or socially awkward a Stanford student is, each and every
one has something incredibly interesting to share about him
or herself; you just have to dig it out in some cases. But in the
case of Randy, 1 was beginning to feel like a talk show host, ask
ing him question after question about himself to spur the con
versation along. I was unable to extract any remarkable story
from him, except for the fact that he seemed to have no inter
ests outside of school and was involved in absolutely no ex
tracurricular activities at Stanford, which I found utterly mys
tifying. Finally, with nothing else to ask about, we discussed his
two-year Mormon mission.
When we finally got to Santa Cruz and got off the bus, the
groping began. While I certainly don't mind a man opening
doors, pulling out chairs and the like, Randy felt the need to
put his arm around my waist and lead me toward the formal.
1 keep trying to walk more briskly so that he couldn't keep his
arm there, but he kept catching up with me and inching his
fingers down my hips and derriere.
To keep things a little more light-hearted, I suggested that
we go check out the boardwalk and the beach. 1 had envi

sioned perhaps walking fora bit in the sand and smoking
some cigarettes to just chill out fora little, but his agenda was
different. He sat me down on some steps by the sand and im
mediately went in for the kiss. I was so shocked that I didn't re
ally know what to do, so I kissed him fora little while. But then
he started putting his hands all over my knees and trying to
work his way up my thighs in a very calculated way, suggest
ing to me that he had pulled these kinds of moves before.
Mumbling some sort of excuse about his itchy beard, I told
him that 1 wanted to go back inside. My friends seemed to be
getting along with their dates, all of whom seemed to know
each other and were mingling quite well. Randy, however,
didn't know anyone at the whole formal, except for one guy
from his dorm who appeared to be avoiding his eye contact.
At this point, I desperately wanted to escape since I felt more
like I was babysitting than going on a date, but I tried to be a
good sport and bring him to the dance floor.
1 spent the entire time trying to avoid his schwerving pelvis
and wandering hands. I couldn't believe that this guy was
Mormon! Telling him that I was tired, I decided that I would
have to drink a few gin and tonics if 1 were going to make it
through the rest of the night without throwing myself into the
ocean. When I returned from the bar, Randy was sitting palm
pilot in hand next to two of my friends, earnestly concentrat
ing on the screen and quickly punching in numbers. It turned

out that he had entered an online auction and was
bidding on a cashmere shirt. In die middle of a for
mal. On a Friday night.
While I was not sure whether he had been
t lying to show me how bored he was or whether lie
genuinely wanted to participate in the online auc
tion, 1 did not stick around long enough to tind out.
The rest of the night was a blur because I spent it at
the bar gulping down shots of Jagermeister to ease
my pain. All I remember is that for revenge, I made
Randy (who didn't smoke and probably found it im
moral) come outside with my friends and help us so
licit passersby for cigarettes.
I also recall that as our group gathered to
gether to take a picture before we got back on the
bus, he attempted to lay a fat wet one on my cheek.
One of my friends has the picture framed on her
bookshelf, next to a picture of her boyfriend. She
says that she loves the picture not because all of
our best friends are in it, but because every time
that she looks at me lunging away from that boy
with a harried look on my face, she remembers
how lucky she is to have found a decent man on
the Stanford campus.
