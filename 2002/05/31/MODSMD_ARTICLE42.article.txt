The great thing about Sushi Kuni is
how quaint it is. It's family-run, and
the sushi chef's are actually Japanese,
lending to its authenticity. Many of the
customers were also Japanese, which is
another good sign. The owner, Kunio
Akabori, does a great job accomplish
ing his goal of creating a comfortable
family-style restaurant. There is an in
timate nature to the place, maybe be
cause of its size* which was pretty
small, but also because of how friendly
the waiters and waitresses were. They
were incredibly polite and incredibly
attentive, but without being intrusive.
Looking around at the other cus
tomers, a combination of groups of
friends and families with small chil
dren, I got a sense that everyone there

was really enjoying the company of
the people they were there with and
also enjoying life as a whole. It seemed
in some ways to be an oasis from the
hustle and bustle that usually consti
tutes life in Silicon Valley. There also
appeared to be many repeat cus
tomers who chatted with the waiters
and sushi chefs.
As a date place, I think it's ideal.
The environment is quiet enough to
allow for some degree of intimacy, or
at least as much as can be expected of
any restaurant environment, and the
ambience of Sushi Kuni fosters relaxed
conversation and a chance to really get
to know your date. Despite its small
size, we didn't have to wait in line fora
table, which is always a plus.
The food was good and reasonably
priced for sushi. Akabori, the owner,

was trained as a sushi chef in Japan, so
the food is both delicious and authen
tic. Although I didn't try the udon and
tempura dishes they offered, if they
were anywhere as good as the sushi, I
would have been ecstatic. All the in
gredients were fresh, and all the sushi
was artistically placed on traditional
dishes.
It was also cool to see the row of
Japanese chefs artfully rolling the
sushi behind the sushi bar. They not
only interacted with each other, but
also interacted with the customers.
I also really liked the leisurely pace
of everything. Each of the different
types of sushi we ordered came out on
a separate dish, which not only helped
me differentiate the different types of
sushi *teut also fostered a slow stroll
through dinner. Unlike many Ameri

can restaurants, the bill did not come
until after we had completely finished
eating, which I really liked. There was
also no rush to kick us out. In fact, we
stayed awhile talking even after the
bill was paid and no one made an ef
fort to expedite our exit. Although we
were obviously there to eat, the
restaurant staff seemed to understand
that dinner is not just about food, but
also about enjoying the company of
those you are with.
If you want to have some great sushi
in a quieter environment away from
the sake bombs and noise that accom
panies a place like Miyaki's, I suggest
you try out Sushi Kuni.
