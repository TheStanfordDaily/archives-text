# Unagi, California, Roll, Uni and more, raw fish!
## 
### PETER KAZANJY 
Sushi is the king of date cuisine. It
used to be one of those things that
people in New York would giggle
about when bashing Californians.
Oh, how the times have changed.
Still, while popular and ever more
pervasive, sushi, like hip-hop, can
easily be done terribly wrong. Thank
god you're in California where the
eastern delicacy has attained almost
yuppie state-dish status.
But why date food? Sushi is a great
alternative to the traditional (read:
hackneyed) $ 15/ plate date-restau
rants you'll find clustered around
inegaplex movie theatres (e.g. Left at
Albuquerque's, Alcatraz Brewing
Company, etc.). It eschews the heav
ier palate-bullying flavors of other
cuisines, is low-fat and leaves one en
ergized for whatever may come next.
Speaking of which, sushi is also
renowned for its aphrodisiacal prop
erties. Japanese men have been
singing the praises of unagi (eel) for
centuries as a natural stamina en
hancer. Uni (sea urchin), served with
an unbroken quail yolk crown, sup
posedly stimulates so much that it
traditionally is not served to women.
The oddly neon-green Wasabi

(Japanese horseradish) and ginger,
invitingly soft and pink, also make
the lurve fuel list. Oh, and everyone
knows about oysters.
Furthermore, like its yuppie
brethren oenophilia, sushi provides
that oh-so-important opportunity to
showcase your suitability as a mate by
flaunting knowledge of the exotic
and obscure. Who could resist some
one who can order eel in Japanese,
and knows the reason for ordering it
no less? Chaperoning your date
through the wilds of the sushi world,
choosing delicious dishes and having
a witty repartee to go along with each
will do more for your unagi than any
Abercrombie and Fitch ensemble, no
matter how well-layered.
That said, here are a few places to
choose from. Each has its own specif
ic appeal, depending on your aim. Co
forth and eat raw fish.
Miyake, 140 University Avenue
Palo Alto
(650) 323-9449
It seems as if this place is a rite of
Stanford passage. But I'm here to let
you in on a secret: It's not really a
sushi bar. It's more a bar that serves
sushi. As you'll note driving by on a
Friday night, Miyake's lack of quality

sushi doesn't necessarily drive away
the customers. Rather, it seems to at
tract them. If you're down with rub
bing elbows with the elite of Paly

riign and Deing entertained
by surly waiters, call ahead,
because there may be a wait.
Order the sake bombs, but
note that according to the
sorority girls on the tables,
they're best drunk in trios.
Fuki Sushi,4ll9 El Camino
Real
Palo Alto
(650) 494-9383
The atmosphere at Fuki
Sushi nicely complements
the food. There's rushing
water, teakwood furniture,
low ceilings and rice paper
windows; Kurosawa could
have shot here. The wait

staff is very friendly, and the food is
tasty. Particularly well done here is
the spicy agedashi tofu, and the tuna
sashimi. They also have floor seating
banquet rooms in the back for parties
of ten or more, which serves nicely
for pre-formal dinners.
Naomi Sushi, 1328 El Camino Real
Menlo Park

(650) 321-6902
For bare bones but delicious sushi,
look no further than two miles north
on El Camino. Naomi Sushi, while

lacking the pomp of Fuki, claims the
best-close-sushi title. It's very diffi
cult to go wrong with anything at
Naomi, but be sure to try the masa
roll and the spicy tuna roll. For the
beginner, the sushi assortment plat
ters are a good way to start and can
be shared for those occasional "Lady
and the Tramp" moments.
