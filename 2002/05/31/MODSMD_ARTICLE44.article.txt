# Step right through the 'Slanted Door'
## 
### RANDY MANO 
Too often, when venturing into the windy, cold envi
rons of San Francisco, you are subject to three of the city's
restaurants' major faults: (1) skimpy portions, (2) exag
gerated prices and (3) parking shortages.
1 have a solution for those hungry, cranky, poor souls.
For anyone who has not yet sauntered into the ultra-pop
ular Slanted Door, you are truly missing out on an enrich

ing and wholly worthwhile experience. I guarantee that
you will, at the very least, admire the richness in flavors
and relative authenticity in Vietnamese cuisine. But it
would not be hip if the place did not try to fuse in other
tastes and textures. One of the The Slanted Door's most
notable characteristics is the range of organic vegetables
— from Blue Sky Farm baby bok choy to T.D. Willey savoy
spinach — and the delectable sauces that complement al
most everything on the menu.

Let's first start with the
signature dishes. As far as appe
tizers go, the spring rolls are
king. The ones given the
restaurant moniker have
shrimp, pork, rice noodles and
mint, with the to-die-for peanut
sauce coming in a side contain
er. There are also vegetarian
spring rolls and crispy imperial
rolls for those who are more ad
venturous.
In terms of meat dishes,
the chicken claypot — sim
mered in a lightly spicy caramel
sauce — and the shaking beef
are my personal faves. The beef
is what really caught my atten
tion because of the filet
mignon's tenderness and the
complimentary garnish of or
ganic spring onions and garlic.
For seafood, it's definite
ly all about the specialty dish of
the moment, the oven-roasted
halibut. As a side note, the om
nipresent Chilean sea bass ap
pears to have been booted from
the menu to make way fora

crispy Tai snapper dish and some seared dayboat scallops.
And of course, with any fine meal, one must look at the
dessert menu, which has the obligatory creme brulee but
also a daring pineapple concoction and a flourless choco
late cake. All in all, I don't really see how you could go
wrong with any dessert.
You may be wondering how the place looks, or how the
service is. The Slanted Door recently moved to 100 Bran
nan from its seven-year home in the Mission District. Ac
cording to Executive Chef Charles Phan, the old venue is
being expanded over the next year to accommodate the
large demand for reservations. (Apparently, prime-time
spots can be filled up to six weeks in advance!)
The Slanted Door — in close proximity to Pacßell Park
— now crosses the Embarcadero and overlooks the Bay
Bridge and the N-Judah line, which is remarkably silent
when you're sitting inside the restaurant. The sleek interi
or fits the South Beach area quite well, with its soft yellow
hues and oak tables giving a very bourgeois and classy un
derstated feel.
The restaurant's only flaw was the cold and austere ser
vice alforded by our serveusse Mimi and the opening host
ess. The dishes are doled out onto the tables by different
individuals, thus creating a distance between restaurant
and patron that may not be a welcome sight by those seek
ing a fun romantic evening.
However, if you are willing to spend about $15 for
lunch (note: no lunch reservations) or $20 for dinner, The
Slanted Door is the top destination in the city for food with
world-renowned quality and sufficient quantity. And for
those who don't seek to battle traffic and parking, The
Slanted Door is accessible by public transit via Caltrain and
then the N-Judah MUNI line.
