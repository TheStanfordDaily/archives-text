Restaurants
Piatti Ristorante. A-2 al the Shopping Center. (650) 324-9733.
It's gonna lie in the upper price range (look to spend about
$40 sans drinks and tip for the two of you as long as you're not
planning on getting a half-portion of elbow macaroni, you
frickin' cheapskate). My last visit here included steak (me), pasta
(her), an appetizer (bruschetta with pear and gorgonzola) and
tea afterwards (her idea, I swear). The atmosphere is great...
perfect fora classy first date. It's brightly lit, fiui and loud
enough to not be too romantic that she'll feel uncomfortable.
Make sure to make reservations because the wait gets upwards
of 45 minutes if you don't. At the end of the meal, consider get
ting dessert. I suggest the affogato al cafe — hazelnut liqueur
and caramel drizzled over vanilla ice cream with a shot of
espresso poured over it. Liquid orgasm at $6, but it might be the
only pleasurable experience of the night, so you might as well,
um ... splurge.
Siam Royal. 338 University Ave. (650) 329-8129.
This is your not-too-pricey casual selection. 1 don't like the

lighting much fora first date. The environ
ment doesn't help facilitate good conversa
tion. Unless you're seeking a spot fora
lunch date, it's too casual and tends to lie a
quick in / out place. Food's great, though. If
yon like duck, try their duck noodle soup.
I'm a big fan of Tom Kali Gai, a tasty co
conut soup.
Mac Arthur Park. 27 University Ave. (650)
321-9900.
Gourmet dining and wonderful am
biance. The baby-back ribs are to die for —
definitely worth trying. They've got a wine
list up the wazoo, and since your ID obvi
ously says you're 21, start browsing once
seated. Look to spend about $60 at the end
of the night if you include appetizer. This

girl better he worth it if you're taking her here, though.
Entertainment
Movies on the first date suck, but so does being stuck talking
to someone you don't want to Uilk with anymore. It's important
to leave yourself a way out, so here's a small range of options:
Jazz Clubs in the City. There's no better background music for

conversation.
Museums. Museums make for great pas
sive entertainment. If you like your date,
you'll be able to sit there spellbound by a
master painter's work and discuss. Hope
fully you both like art. If you don't like
your date, you can pretend to lie interest
ed in some sculpture while you secretly
fantasize about impaling yourself on it.
Too bad SFMOMA closes at 5:45 p.m.
Movies. Sure it's overrated, but it can also
set the mood with the wonderful Social
Psych concept of projection where she
projects character roles onto the two of
you. Now you know that Brad Pitt really
is g<K)d for something. Buy the damn tick-

ets ahead of time if you don't want to scream your conversations
over hundreds of kids in line.
Coffee. I'd say on-campus is your best bet, because if it doesn't
go well, all you need to do is drop her in White Plaza and let her
walk her ass home. No awkward drive back from a far-away
place. Call this idea the Cherry on Top if you know you're not
getting any action, but die date is still going well enough to not
end it after dinner and the entertainment.
