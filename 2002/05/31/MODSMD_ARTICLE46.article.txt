Sexual intercourse is a completely natural activity that, like
many other natural activities, can be done anywhere. Anyone
who has seen dogs in a public park or a bull mounting a dairy
cow in a green field knows this to be true. But humans? Well,
we tend to be a bit more discrete in our sexunl activity. While
most of the suggestions below focus on places to actually have
sex, most oj them will work just fine for flirting or getting to
know each other — except the Bender Reading Room, where if
you aren't fucking, you d better be studying for finals!

There are many storied locations in the world in
which to have sex: the beach, the hot tub, an airplane
bathroom. But if you're looking fora great place to re
ally impress your latest date, or just looking fora great
place to fuck right here on campus next year, Roble
Hall's pool table is quite the challenge. It must be dur
ing one of their big blow-out parties, though — it adds
some welcome spice to know there are a couple hundred
people dancing next door, as you ride each other to ec
stasy! The table's a little hard, so no doggy-style here . .
. that is, unless you bring your knee-pads along.

Considering the recent popularity of "Gladiator," the
universal appeal of the Roman Empire, (q.v. Las Vegas

to Reno to Shake
speare), and the
übiquity of Plato's
"Symposium" in
I HUM, the fol
lowing location
seems especially
germane. If
you're tired of ro
mantic and would
rather go Ro
manesque, this is
definitely it. What
is it, exactly?
Five miles
north of Stan
ford, just off High-

way 280, one finds the Las Pulgas
Water Temple, a neoclassical struc
ture built over the outpour of the
Hetch Hetchy Tunnel, which leads
from the eponymous reservoir. The
building itself is open to the sky, locat
ed at the head of a manicured field
lined with Cypress trees, with a re
flecting pond to properly embellish
the naturally phallic columns. To
avoid gender-centricity, one will also
kindly note that the site benefits from
the constant soothing gurgle and gush
of the tunnel's outpour. Bring a
blankey for the grass (beginner) or a
Therm-a-Rest for the temple's altar
(advanced).
To get there, take 280 north, exit
left on Edgewood Road. If you hit 96,
you've gone too far. Turn right on
Canada Road and it's about three
minutes on your left. You may want to
scope it out during the day first to
avoid that awkward "I've been here a
million times; I'm just a little mixed
up" experience (at which point he
knows that you just read it in Inter
mission, and your cover's blown). And
remember, even the purest marble

columns benefit from protection, so bring your Trojans

Bend-Her Reading Room. (Okay,
that was bad.)
No, I'm serious. If you're one
of our more adventurous readers,
picture this: The room is full of
stressed-out students, frantically
preparing for their finals, their at
tention devoted to silently paging
through their engineering text
books. Suddenly, you and your
date start getting it on in a hot and
heavy way in the corner. The
panic! The horror! First, everyone

will express their dis
approval via the
famed Bender Room
glare, but when you
guys keep going,
they'll be too battled
and shocked to over
come the taboo on ac
tual speech. People
will either stare
dumbfounded or
walk out. If the for
mer, you and your
honey will have an
appreciative audi
ence; if the latter,
you'll get the whole
Bender Room to
romp around in.

Ujamaa, Room 123A
To tell you the
truth, I find it hard
to choose my fa
vorite fucking spot.
Stanford's plethora

of locales just beg deviant sexual dalliances. My person
al favorites have been the handicapped showers —
right after they have been cleaned — and the Late
Night Marguerite — there are so may bumps in the
road, it just adds to the adventure! The Mirrielees roof
top was pretty fun, too, but I am kind of scared of
heights, so it wasn't as great as it could have been. I've
always wanted to sneak into the Rodin garden at night,
start my foreplay with Adam, let my partner get horny
on Eve and then do it doggy-style against the Gates of
Hell, with Rodin's Thinker watching me from above. I
figure if I am not damned after my hot night in Mem-
Chu, nothing can take me to hell . . . Additionally, I
have heard various rumors claiming that Room 123A in
Ujamaa is a prime destination. This is likely to be just a
Stanford myth, though.

At Roble, the ball curves even when you hit it straight.

you aren't fucking, you d better be studying for finals!
Corner Pocket
There are many storied locations in the world in
which to have sex: the beach, the hot tub, an airplane
bathroom. But if you're looking fora great place to re
ally impress your latest date, or just looking fora great
place to fuck right here on campus next year, Roble
Hall's pool table is quite the challenge. It must be dur
ing one of their big blow-out parties, though — it adds
some welcome spice to know there are a couple hundred
people dancing next door, as you ride each other to ec
stasy! The table's a little hard, so no doggy-style here . .
. that is, unless you bring your knee-pads along.

Et Tu Brute?
Considering the recent popularity of "Gladiator," the
universal appeal of the Roman Empire, (q.v. Las Vegas

to Reno to Shake
speare), and the
übiquity of Plato's
"Symposium" in
I HUM, the fol
lowing location
seems especially
germane. If
you're tired of ro
mantic and would
rather go Ro
manesque, this is
definitely it. What
is it, exactly?
Five miles
north of Stan
ford, just off High-

way 280, one finds the Las Pulgas
Water Temple, a neoclassical struc
ture built over the outpour of the
Hetch Hetchy Tunnel, which leads
from the eponymous reservoir. The
building itself is open to the sky, locat
ed at the head of a manicured field
lined with Cypress trees, with a re
flecting pond to properly embellish
the naturally phallic columns. To
avoid gender-centricity, one will also
kindly note that the site benefits from
the constant soothing gurgle and gush
of the tunnel's outpour. Bring a
blankey for the grass (beginner) or a
Therm-a-Rest for the temple's altar
(advanced).
To get there, take 280 north, exit
left on Edgewood Road. If you hit 96,
you've gone too far. Turn right on
Canada Road and it's about three
minutes on your left. You may want to
scope it out during the day first to
avoid that awkward "I've been here a
million times; I'm just a little mixed
up" experience (at which point he
knows that you just read it in Inter
mission, and your cover's blown). And
remember, even the purest marble

columns benefit from protection, so bring your Trojans

Bend-Her Reading Room. (Okay,
that was bad.)
No, I'm serious. If you're one
of our more adventurous readers,
picture this: The room is full of
stressed-out students, frantically
preparing for their finals, their at
tention devoted to silently paging
through their engineering text
books. Suddenly, you and your
date start getting it on in a hot and
heavy way in the corner. The
panic! The horror! First, everyone

will express their dis
approval via the
famed Bender Room
glare, but when you
guys keep going,
they'll be too battled
and shocked to over
come the taboo on ac
tual speech. People
will either stare
dumbfounded or
walk out. If the for
mer, you and your
honey will have an
appreciative audi
ence; if the latter,
you'll get the whole
Bender Room to
romp around in.

Ujamaa, Room 123A
To tell you the
truth, I find it hard
to choose my fa
vorite fucking spot.
Stanford's plethora

of locales just beg deviant sexual dalliances. My person
al favorites have been the handicapped showers —
right after they have been cleaned — and the Late
Night Marguerite — there are so may bumps in the
road, it just adds to the adventure! The Mirrielees roof
top was pretty fun, too, but I am kind of scared of
heights, so it wasn't as great as it could have been. I've
always wanted to sneak into the Rodin garden at night,
start my foreplay with Adam, let my partner get horny
on Eve and then do it doggy-style against the Gates of
Hell, with Rodin's Thinker watching me from above. I
figure if I am not damned after my hot night in Mem-
Chu, nothing can take me to hell . . . Additionally, I
have heard various rumors claiming that Room 123A in
Ujamaa is a prime destination. This is likely to be just a
Stanford myth, though.

At Roble, the ball curves even when you hit it straight.


Imagine this room filled with your screams of ecstasy.
