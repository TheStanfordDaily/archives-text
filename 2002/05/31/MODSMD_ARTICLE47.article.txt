### BENJAMIN LOVE FRIEDLAND 
Good places to pick up a date require the
following: lots of people, low lighting, music,
a romantic atmosphere, lots of drunk people
and enough happening to stimulate con
stant conversation. As you can tell, few places
satisfy all these criteria.
For that reason, a quick note is in order.
No matter how perfect the pick-up spot, tak
ing someone home or even walleting a
phone number demands a certain amount

of initiative, confidence and luck. And while
these suggested locations may indeed in
crease chances, they by no means secure
anything. And, of course it helps to be sexy as
hell.
At Palo Alto bars like the Rose and Crown
and the Blue Chalk alcohol is, of course, a
plentiful social lubricant. Neither place,
however, guarantees a nighttime compan
ion. After all, bars like the seedy former or
the more upscale latter don't usually provide
dance floor space. Also, when the house DJ is

a jukebox, expect AC / DC and at least
seven "Sweet Child O' Mine" spins to
ruin even the slickest game.
Other obvious choices include the
bowling alley, the racetrack and Costco.
Despite some attractive qualities, each
has several downfalls.
First of all, philandering at the
bowling alley, a popular high school get
away, warrants the usual question: Is
this person who just lent me this nine
pound ball old enough to drive? Al
though free from SAT preppers and full
of sex-seeking ■ gamblers, playing the

ponies may not be the best bet ei
ther. The distraction of the actual
race and the excitement of a win
ning quinella can prove over
whelming to even the most diehard
Casanova. 1 n I he same way, Costco's
abundance of foodstuffs and furni
ture will no doubt spoil hopes of the
love-game. Costco's nonstop sam
pling and sheer immensity, howev
er, compensate for the earlier obsta
cles.
As for the Stanford campus,
house parties and special dinners
work well for some, but don't dis
miss the Corner Pocket or steam-

tunneling. In its gourmet cuisine and deli
cate atmosphere, the Tresidder pizza place
has launched countless bones. Likewise,
steam-tunneling accounts for widespread
budding romance. "1 met my last three girl
friends down there," said steam-tunrjel reg
ular Heath Nord.
Willing bodies certainly fill San Francisco,
San Jose and Santa Cruz, and the distance
away from campus may help. Sometimes the

most relaxed and ferocious prowl occurs
well away from home. However, without the
necessary transportation, these surrounding
cities could be too difficult and too expensive
for their yield.
But have no fear; other options exist. For
the resourceful mind, the Stanford Credit
Union, Mardi Gras or New Haven, jewel of
the East, can be a virtual gold mine just wait
ing to be tapped.
