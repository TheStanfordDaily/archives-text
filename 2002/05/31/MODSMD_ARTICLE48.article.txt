# San Jose's classic take on a popular pasttime
## 
### RYAN SANDS 
Drive-in movie theaters, once the locus
of American heavy petting, have all but
disappeared from the modern teenager's
cotning-of-age experience. While their
numbers once peaked at over 4,000 the
aters in 1958, now less than 300 (accord
ing to some sources) are still running fea
tures in the United States. Luckily for us
Stanford students, one of the few remain
ing drive-ins is located a mere 35 minutes
away in San Jose.
The Century Capitol Drive-In is part
of a complex that includes a few chain
restaurants and a regular sit-down Capi
tol Multiplex. Do not be distracted by
these modern marvels as you proceed
toward this place's real attraction. Hie
Capitol Drive-In features six screens
and shows a double-feature each night,
starting around 8:30 p.m. It's a cheap
$6.50 per head to get in (unless you pull
the classic move of hiding your date in
the trunk), and is a steal compared to
the nearly $ 10 tickets at most cineplexes.
I've taken my girlfriend to the Capitol
Drive-In on two occasions (to see "Mon
sters, Inc." and "Spiderman") and im
mediately felt a wave of nostalgia and ex
citement upon pulling my little station

wagon through the entrance gates. At
this theater, you listen to the movie over
your car radio, and are free to bring
your own snacks and beverages in with
you. Don't fret though, if you forgot to
bring your own food there is a huge tent
that serves peanuts, popcorn and cotton
candy for the patrons.
As for watching the film, your best bet
is to park far enough back that the
screen will fit within the view of your
windshield and then recline your seats
all the way down. If you are lucky
enough to have a sedan with one big
jumper seat in the front, you can snug

gle with your honey during the film
(Sorry manual transmission drivers, that
shifter will not facilitate snuggling of any
kind!) If you are even luckier and have a
station wagon, you can park backwards
with the hatch open and relax with blan
kets or a sleeping bag. Both of the times
my girlfriend and I visited the Capitol,
we loved being able to talk to each other
and crack jokes about the movies with
out worrying about bugging other peo
ple.
The Capitol Drive-In is really a per
fect place to go on a date. You get to
enjoy the spectacle of watching a movie

On the big screen while
still enjoying the privacy
of your car's front seat.
And if you're really hav
ing a good time, um,
watching the film, you
can stay through the sec
ond feature which usually
lasts until around 1 a.m.
Though the majority of
people at the theater are
on dates, the drive-in is
also a great place to go
with a group of friends,
or as a family; Just bring
your fold-out chairs and

chill drinking sodas in front of your car.
Whichever way you want to go, the
Capitol Drive-In makes fora memorable
evening away from the humdrum Stan
ford / Palo Alto social scene.
Century Capitol Drive-In Theatre is locat
ed at Capitol Expressway tsf Snell Avenue
in San J ose. Its phone number is
(408)226-225
