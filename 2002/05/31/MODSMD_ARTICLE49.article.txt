# Get schooled in soul by the 'Unbelievable' Otis

This is the eleventh article in a series called "The Record Bin,"
exploring classic albums from the past: pop music for people who
like pop music.

It is somewhat re
markable to think that
in a career lasting just
five short years, Otis
Redding's name be
came synonymous with
soul music, a genre
characterized by its
throaty, earnest vocals
and brassy instrumen
tal arrangements. His

early death in a plane crash, at the age of 26, in 1967 is
reminiscent of other musical pioneers lost at an early
age — Kurt Cobain immediately comes to mind — ex-

cept that Redding had only
begun his journey as an
artist and a musical titan.
Respected by his peers,
Redding had songs covered
by the Rolling Stones and
admired by the Beatles. Ad
ditionally, Aretha Franklin's
rendition of his song, "Re
spect," became a popular
sensation a few years after
he died. Sadly, his biggest
hit was the posthumously
released "(Sitting by the)
Dock of the Bay," a song that
when played today on adult
contemporary radio makes
all the Whitney Houston
and Celine Dion singles be
fore and after it seem ama
teurish.
Redding's "Dictionary of
Soul" album stands out as

one of the finest recordings of the '60s. Its somewhat
pretentious title should be taken with a wink and a
smile, for it belies the singer's considerable dexterity.
"Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa (Sad Song)" will naturally appeal to
anyone who has loved without having that love recip
rocated — a description that fits all of

us at some time.
Though there are a few covers
on the album — including the Beatles'
"Day Tripper" and the soul standard
"Tennessee Waltz" — most of the
songs are Redding originals. Several
are co-written with Steve Cropper,
guitarist for Booker T and the MGs,
the house band that backed Redding
on many of his recordings. On "Sweet
Lorene," Redding even gets help from

Isaac Hayes, who worked as a keyboardist for the Stax
/ Volt label, but who is better known for performing
the "Shaft" theme song.

"Hawg For
You" emerges as
one of the album's
highlights; it is a
blues-heavy, lusty
ode to desire, deliv
ered with a sexy,
love-drunk swagger.
Redding's songs are
always touching and
never saccharine.
On "My Lover's
Prayer," he seduc
tively asks, "What
you gonna do
tonight / When you
need some loving
arms to hold you
tight? / What you
gonna do tonight/
When you need my
heavy voice to tell
you good night?"

The answer is simple, really. After listening to Red
ding's "Dictionary," you'll probably be compelled to
start from the beginning of the album once more.



I'm a hawg for Otis.
