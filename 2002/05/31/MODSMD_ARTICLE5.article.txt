# SImps spring show to showcase spontaneity
## 
### SARA WEEKLY 
There will be no scripts when
the Stanford Improvisors take
the Pigott Theater stage tonight
and Saturday.
In fact, the Simps Spring
Show will bear little resemblance
to traditional drama.
Showcasing a series of comedic
and dramatic scenes, the show
will feature a combination of
sports improv, with teams of cast
members competing against one
another, and maestro improv,
which involves individuals vying
for die championship.
However, just because the ma
terial will be spontaneously gen
erated does not mean that the en
semble members have not pre
pared for die show.
The type of improv that the
Simps will use emphasizes good
storytelling. They practice for the
performance by going over nar
rative skills and specific topics
likely to arise during the show.
"We spend a lot of time learn
ing how to make the other peo
ple on stage look good," said
Simps member Sara Neff. "It is
very much an ensemble thing.
Everyone has to feel comfort
able together."
Named "Theatre Machine"
as a tribute to improv guru

Keith Johnstone, tonight's per
formances will feature only ac
tive members of the Simps
while alumni and inactive mem
bers may participate on Saturday.
"This year's group has been
wonderful. There is lots of new
talent and Simps continues to be
a group that loves practicing,
loves performing and is a real
community at Stanford," said
Simps member Jacob Klein.
Since shows are composed as
they are performed, each time
will be completely unique.
"It is a show unlike any you
have ever seen, and the show
will never be seen again," said
Klein. "In an era of mechanical
reproduction, it is unusual to see
something so original and tem
porary. That is the special ap
peal of improv."
Another distinguishing charac
teristic of die improv show is audi
ence participation. Often audi
ence members are included in the
scenes or solicited for topics.
"We are happy to do scenes
out of nothing, but we really love
to have the audience involved,"
Neff said.
The Simps perform at 8 p.m.
and 10 p.m. tonight at Pigott
Theater and at 8 p.m. on Satur
day. Tickets are $5 on sale today
in White Plaza or at the door.
