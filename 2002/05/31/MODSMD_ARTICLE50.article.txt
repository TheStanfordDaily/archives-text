# Roxy gets some T & A from her T.A.
## 
### 
Dearest Stanfordians,
The perfect date ... ah, the eternal
search for the impossible. Since the rest
of the issue is dedicated to what to do on
the perfect date, let's talk about the per
son, that very special Dudley-Do-Right
of Dating, and how to find him or her.
Of course, in Roxy's opinion, the per
fect date is one who pays for dinner and
doesn't boot in your hair, but my edi
tors claimed that wouldn't be enough
fora column.
So how to find that perfect date? If
it's maturity you want, look no further
than your nearest classroom. No, not
your fellow students. Roxy implores
you to give a second, and perhaps
third glance at your TAs. Roxy has re
ceived hundreds, hundreds of
emails about the hot TAs of, say,
Bioethics, CS377A and Science and
Religion. Okay, maybe not hundreds,
but somewhere around 20. Okay,
that's even stretching it. Actually Roxy
just heard the TAs talking about how
hot they were in the CoHo one night.
But they are tasty little vittles, and
quite representative of the TA popula
tion campus wide.
First, all of the conventional wisdom

says to wait until you've finished their class. That's a
bunch of hooey. If you're already out of their class, how
will going out with you TA help your GPA? On the
other hand, if you generally make an ass of yourself and
/ or don't plan to put out, perhaps waiting a quarter
isn't such a bad idea.
But how does one go about acquiring a date with
these perfect dates? This can be a delicate proposition.
They are skittish creatures — you must approach them

adroitly. The best way to do this is by dropping hints in
your papers or problem sets; if it's a CS class, maybe
you'll want to comment it out. Of course, many of you
are skeptical. Roxy's suggestion may sound ill advised,
but it actually kills two birds with one stone. Many of us
wonder whether the TAs actually read our papers any
way, so drop a subtle hint such as:
Robert Beezer, one of the dissenting judges, wrote about reex-

amining 'the historic presumption that
all human lives are equally and intrinsi
cally valuable' and you, [insert TA name
here], are equally and intrinsically hot.
This can answer once and for all
whether the grades we get are based
on the work we do. It is possible that
this is not a question any of us want
answered, so keep your findings to
yourself.
If these sort of hints are too sub
tle for the elevated TA mind, you
may have to resort to office hours,
where you come bearing some vari
ety of soy concoction (with advanced
age comes concern for the environ
ment) and wearing something taste
fully revealing but, more important
ly, made chiefly of natural fibers.
Read up on current events, be pre
pared to discuss deep philosophical
issues and allow your well-worn
copy of Nietzsche's "Jenseits von
Gut und Bose" (obviously the Ger
man version) to "accidentally" fall
from your backpack, but then
quickly, modestly, put it away. If
they don't drop what they're doing,
swipe everything off their desk, and
bend vou over it, vou missed a step

somewhere. Maybe try something "by Heidegger in
stead.
