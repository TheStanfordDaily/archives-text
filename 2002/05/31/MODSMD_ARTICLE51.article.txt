# Flowers to make the girls swoon
## 
### MIKEY LEE 
Roses are red. They're also yellow,

white, orange, pink and laven
der. They're also not the only
kind of flower, and if you play
your cards wrong, you might as
well bring her a diamond ring
and see how she'll react to that.
Roses, as a general rule, should
not be part of your first-date
checklist unless you're going to a
formal or Screw Your Room
mate. Also, be careful of the gen
eral underlying messages of each
color: Red is generally known as
love, yellow is friendship, white
can either be purity or mourning
and the rest have a variety of in
terpretations.
Wildflowers are your best bet,
and depending on the girl, you
might not even have to make the
trip down to the Village Flower
Shoppe. Instead, you can go over
to the island of flowers growing
in the middle of road in front of
Cowell. Bring scissors and be
ready to dodge cars.
Daisies are good for most oc
casions, as are tulips, lilies and
daffodils. You're a sensitive guy,

aren't you? Try to show it by sticking to
something simple and fun first and deal
with the more expensive plants after

gauging her interest at the end of
round one.
Flowers are great for subtle messages,

too. Two roses can be a really serious
hint that'll cost you around 10 bucks. If
there's an inside joke that can be repre-

sented through the giving of flow
ers, do it; it shows that you actually
do think about her passing
thoughts. I've made roses out of alu
minum foil. I've given a 4-foot-tall
plastic rose from Safeway to a date
who was s'o" and another to a date
who was 6'5" tall. I gave a sunflower
to a blonde hottie and serenaded her
with Phantom Planet's "One Ray of
Sunlight," her favorite song. One of
my friends attests that she looks only
for "something different" because
"roses are so boring and expected."
Don't just forget to buy flowers,
either. Given that most first dates
should just be casual dinner outings,
even a small, simple, unwrapped
bouquet of flowers has a place in a
woman's heart right next to choco
late and oral sex. Or so I'm told.
Finally, go and get her flowers
when she's not expecting it. If she's
got too much studying to do before
finals, drop by, hand her a rose, give
her a quick kiss on the cheek and
book it. You won't have to worry
about calling or e-mailing first, I
promise.
