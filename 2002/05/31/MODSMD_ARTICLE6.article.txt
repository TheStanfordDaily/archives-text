# Stanford reviews grading after Harvard's overhaul
## 
### CYNTHIA CHO EDITORIAL STAFF 
At a closed meeting last week, the
faculty at Harvard University voted
in favor of two sweeping changes re
garding its grading system. Har
vard will switch from a non-tradi
tional 15-point grading scale to the
more conventional scale — one in
which a 4.0 is an A and a zero is an F
— and also will limit the number of
students allowed to graduate with
honors to 60 percent of a class, the
New York Times reported recendy.
These changes come after a com
mittee of the Faculty of Arts and Sci
ences at Harvard decided — follow
ing a yearlong debate — that grade
inflation exists at Harvard and that
it fails to distinguish the truly excep
tional students from those who are
just "very good."
For some time, Harvard has re
ceived criticism that too many of
its students were receiving A's and
graduating with honors. In last
year's graduating class at Har

vard, nearly 90 percent of the stu
dents graduated with some form
of honors.
Harvard's decisive action on the
topic has raised speculation that
other colleges and universities may
soon follow suit.
"What Harvard does is impor
tant because of its history and role in
American higher education," said
Stanford University Registrar
Roger Printup. "I am sure that its
action in this matter will spur discus
sion around the country on the
meaning of grades, grading stan
dards and related issues. I am also
sure, however, that the responses of
other universities will vary depend
ing on their own histories, practices
and values."
At Stanford, the Faculty Senate is
currently in the process of reviewing
the University's grading proce
dures.
The Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement, which
reports to the senate, was asked by
the Steering Committee of the sen

ate to look into issues of grading and
grade inflation this year, according
to Senate Chair John Rickford, a
professor of linguistics.
"Appraising and responding to
student work is of course an impor
tant pait of a university education
and grades are just one element of
it," Rickford said. Greater issues
than grades and percentages, such
as "the substantive commentary and
feedback faculty should provide [to
students] or the way our teaching
should be shaped and informed by
the evidence of learning evaluation
provides throughout a course" are
involved in current discussions, ac
cording to Rickford.
The Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement is ex
pected to present an information re
port at the next Steering Committee
meeting on June 4.
"Whether and to what extent
grade inflation exists for Stanford
undergraduates probably deserves
study," said Hank Greely, vice chair
of the senate and professor of law.

"Just labeling something 'grade in
flation,' though, doesn't necessarily
mean that is a problem that needs to
be solved.
"If the average undergraduate
CPA had climbed, to use a hypo
thetical example, from 3.2 to 3.3
over the past 40 years, that might be
grade inflation, but it probably
wouldn't be worth worrying about,"
Greely said. "If, on the other hand,
equally hypothetically, the average
GPA had climbed from 3.2 to 3.7
over the last 10 years, that would
seem clearly to deserve some atten
tion."
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education John Bravman ex
pressed similar sentiments.
"Grade inflation exists in the
straightforward numerical sense, in
that the average grade assigned to
Stanford's undergraduates has very
gradually risen over the years. I
think this reflects the growing excel
lence of our students, and I see no
discernible impact upon them,"
Bravman said.
Printup also addressed the diffi
culty in proving the existence of
grade inflation.
"In the popular press, grade in
flation has come to mean giving stu
dents grades that are higher than
they actually deserve. 1 have not
seen a study that can actually prove
that this is, in fact, the case, even at
institutions where grades have in
creased appreciably over the years,"
Printup said.
"Certainly, many studies have
shown that grades have increased
over time, but proving that students
did not deserve those grades is
much more difficult," he said.
Unlike at Harvard, undergradu
ates at Stanford can graduate "with
honors" and / or "with distinction."
At Stanford, a student can grad
uate "with honors" upon comple
tion of an honors thesis within the
honors program in an academic de
partment. A faculty committee from
the department reviews, approves
and awards the designat ion "with
honors in (name of department),"
which appears on the diploma and
transcript.
A student can only be given the
designation "with honors." There is
no "with honors, with high honors,
with highest honors," or "cum
laude, magna cum laude, or summa
cum laude," according to Printup.
There is also no limit placed on the
number of students who can write
an honors thesis and attempt to
graduate "with honors."
Graduating "with distinction" is
based on the student's cumulative
GPA The designation is given to
the top 15 percent of the graduating
class and appears on both t he diplo

ma and the transcript. No more
than 15 percent of a class ever grad
uates "with distinction."
"Stanford's system of awarding
'with honors' and 'with distinction'
is quite different from Harvard's. In
light of the current debate at Har
vard, I think Stanford's two ways of
recognizing academic achievement
makes much more sense," Printup
said.
'"With honors' recognizes work
in a specific discipline and, because
of the honors thesis requirement,
requires much more effort on the
part of the student than graduating
without honors. 'With distinction' is
a designation that takes into account
a student's entire academic record,"
he said.
Of the 1,628 undergraduates in
the Class of2ool, approximately 19
percent — 317 students — gradu
ated "with honors."
"Given the way that we define
honors — fulfilling a set of require
ments defined by a department or
program — I would hope that
more students would elect to pur
sue this option," Bravman said.
"As we have gready expanded
the scope of our undergraduate re
search programs, this is likely to
happen over a period of years," he
said.
Stanford has four grading sys
tems. The most general grading
system is a scale ranging from A+ to
NP. A4- is a 4.3 and NP is a zero.
The Law School uses numbers (4.3,
4.2, 4.1, etc.), the Medical School
uses pass/fail and the Business
School uses H (honors), HP (high
pass), P (pass), LP (low pass), U (un
satisfactory) and + (LP or better).
"Faculty have almost complete
autonomy in grade assignments,"
Bravman said. "In some depart
ments, in larger classes, there are ef
forts to normalize the grading
across sections, but there is no cen
tral control whatsoever."

over the last 10 years, that would
seem clearly to deserve some atten
tion."
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education John Bravman ex
pressed similar sentiments.
"Grade inflation exists in the
straightforward numerical sense, in
that the average grade assigned to
Stanford's undergraduates has very
gradually risen over the years. I
think this reflects the growing excel
lence of our students, and I see no
discernible impact upon them,"
Bravman said.
Printup also addressed the diffi
culty in proving the existence of
grade inflation.
"In the popular press, grade in
flation has come to mean giving stu
dents grades that are higher than
they actually deserve. 1 have not
seen a study that can actually prove
that this is, in fact, the case, even at
institutions where grades have in
creased appreciably over the years,"
Printup said.
"Certainly, many studies have
shown that grades have increased
over time, but proving that students
did not deserve those grades is
much more difficult," he said.
Unlike at Harvard, undergradu
ates at Stanford can graduate "with
honors" and / or "with distinction."
At Stanford, a student can grad
uate "with honors" upon comple
tion of an honors thesis within the
honors program in an academic de
partment. A faculty committee from
the department reviews, approves
and awards the designat ion "with
honors in (name of department),"
which appears on the diploma and
transcript.
A student can only be given the
designation "with honors." There is
no "with honors, with high honors,
with highest honors," or "cum
laude, magna cum laude, or summa
cum laude," according to Printup.
There is also no limit placed on the
number of students who can write
an honors thesis and attempt to
graduate "with honors."
Graduating "with distinction" is
based on the student's cumulative
GPA The designation is given to
the top 15 percent of the graduating
class and appears on both t he diplo

ma and the transcript. No more
than 15 percent of a class ever grad
uates "with distinction."
"Stanford's system of awarding
'with honors' and 'with distinction'
is quite different from Harvard's. In
light of the current debate at Har
vard, I think Stanford's two ways of
recognizing academic achievement
makes much more sense," Printup
said.
'"With honors' recognizes work
in a specific discipline and, because
of the honors thesis requirement,
requires much more effort on the
part of the student than graduating
without honors. 'With distinction' is
a designation that takes into account
a student's entire academic record,"
he said.
Of the 1,628 undergraduates in
the Class of2ool, approximately 19
percent — 317 students — gradu
ated "with honors."
"Given the way that we define
honors — fulfilling a set of require
ments defined by a department or
program — I would hope that
more students would elect to pur
sue this option," Bravman said.
"As we have gready expanded
the scope of our undergraduate re
search programs, this is likely to
happen over a period of years," he
said.
Stanford has four grading sys
tems. The most general grading
system is a scale ranging from A+ to
NP. A4- is a 4.3 and NP is a zero.
The Law School uses numbers (4.3,
4.2, 4.1, etc.), the Medical School
uses pass/fail and the Business
School uses H (honors), HP (high
pass), P (pass), LP (low pass), U (un
satisfactory) and + (LP or better).
"Faculty have almost complete
autonomy in grade assignments,"
Bravman said. "In some depart
ments, in larger classes, there are ef
forts to normalize the grading
across sections, but there is no cen
tral control whatsoever."
At a closed meeting last week, the
faculty at Harvard University voted
in favor of two sweeping changes re
garding its grading system. Har
vard will switch from a non-tradi
tional 15-point grading scale to the
more conventional scale — one in
which a 4.0 is an A and a zero is an F
— and also will limit the number of
students allowed to graduate with
honors to 60 percent of a class, the
New York Times reported recendy.
These changes come after a com
mittee of the Faculty of Arts and Sci
ences at Harvard decided — follow
ing a yearlong debate — that grade
inflation exists at Harvard and that
it fails to distinguish the truly excep
tional students from those who are
just "very good."
For some time, Harvard has re
ceived criticism that too many of
its students were receiving A's and
graduating with honors. In last
year's graduating class at Har

vard, nearly 90 percent of the stu
dents graduated with some form
of honors.
Harvard's decisive action on the
topic has raised speculation that
other colleges and universities may
soon follow suit.
"What Harvard does is impor
tant because of its history and role in
American higher education," said
Stanford University Registrar
Roger Printup. "I am sure that its
action in this matter will spur discus
sion around the country on the
meaning of grades, grading stan
dards and related issues. I am also
sure, however, that the responses of
other universities will vary depend
ing on their own histories, practices
and values."
At Stanford, the Faculty Senate is
currently in the process of reviewing
the University's grading proce
dures.
The Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement, which
reports to the senate, was asked by
the Steering Committee of the sen

ate to look into issues of grading and
grade inflation this year, according
to Senate Chair John Rickford, a
professor of linguistics.
"Appraising and responding to
student work is of course an impor
tant pait of a university education
and grades are just one element of
it," Rickford said. Greater issues
than grades and percentages, such
as "the substantive commentary and
feedback faculty should provide [to
students] or the way our teaching
should be shaped and informed by
the evidence of learning evaluation
provides throughout a course" are
involved in current discussions, ac
cording to Rickford.
The Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement is ex
pected to present an information re
port at the next Steering Committee
meeting on June 4.
"Whether and to what extent
grade inflation exists for Stanford
undergraduates probably deserves
study," said Hank Greely, vice chair
of the senate and professor of law.

"Just labeling something 'grade in
flation,' though, doesn't necessarily
mean that is a problem that needs to
be solved.
"If the average undergraduate
CPA had climbed, to use a hypo
thetical example, from 3.2 to 3.3
over the past 40 years, that might be
grade inflation, but it probably
wouldn't be worth worrying about,"
Greely said. "If, on the other hand,
equally hypothetically, the average
GPA had climbed from 3.2 to 3.7
over the last 10 years, that would
seem clearly to deserve some atten
