# Semester at Sea gives global perspective
## 
### CHELSEA DUDEK 
It's been called many things — "semester at sex,"
"party at sea," "the love boat" — but none of these
stereotypes serve as an accurate description of the Se
mester at Sea program, according to many partici
pants. Unlike the typical study-abroad program,
where students spend one or more quarters at a single
foreign location, Semester at Sea exposes students to
many cultures and people around the world.
Stanford students typically complete Semester at
Sea offered through the University of Pittsburgh. The
program has existed for over 30 years and has been
completed by over 35,000 students. Students visit nine
countries during the course of the 100-day voyage.
While this may seem like a long vacation, Semester
at Sea isn't all play. Hie program requires students to
take a minimum of 12 credits during their study.
Students choose from 70 different upper and lower
division courses offered through the College of Arts
and Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh. The pro
gram is designed with classes from many departments
so students with various academic backgrounds can
participate. All participants are required to take Geog
raphy 100: Global Perspectives, which provides an
overview of the areas and issues encountered during
the voyage.
Senior Suzanne Radotic, who partic
ipated in the fall 2000 program, re
members most the shocking things that
happened to her in evei*y country, such
as instances where people tried to rob
her or viewing situations of extreme
poverty.
"People would come back really ex
cited after having been at port and
would want to share everything they
had experienced with each other,"
Radotic said.
Throughout the program, stu
dents are at port almost as much as
they are on board the ship. They gen
erally spend four to six days at each
location and have the opportunity to
look first-hand at the societies they
are studying.
Field activities are designed to
meet specific needs of individual class
es and to provide opportunities for
travel to places of significant cultural,
historical, and political interest. While
at port, students have had a wide
array of experiences, from surfing in
South Africa and going on safari in
Kenya, to hearing Fidel Castro speak
to a special audience granted specifi
cally for the program.
About 20 percent of the credit is 112 ul
filled through field work done while
students are at port.
Stanford does transfer units com
pleted on board, though credit is
evaluated upon the student's return.
Radotic was able to transfer 22.5
units from her trip, and they all
counted towards GERs or her major
requirements.
Faculty members of the program
also come from around the world. The
majority of them are on sabbatical or
personal leave from their home institu
tions.
"I had the best professors there,"
Radotic saidi
Fall and spring semesters are con
ducted aboard the S.S. Universe Ex
plorer, a converted cruise ship that lias
been transformed into a floating uni
versity. Aboard the ship are such
amenities as a theater, student union,

fitness facility, swimming pool, and, of
course, classrooms. Students live in cab
ins similar to regular college dorm
rooms that are either doubles or triples.
The idea of spending 100 days
aboard a ship may seem daunting to
some students.
"Livingon a ship, in tight quarters, is
definitely a bit claustrophobic at first,
but you get used to it pretty quickly,"
said senior Caroline Osterwise, who
was part of the fall 2000 voyage.
Senior Jason Powers, also a member
of the fall 2000 voyage, didn't have any
problems with the confined space.
"There were so many people, you
could go days without seeing somebody
if you just didn't happen to cross
paths," Powers said.
After overcoming the issues of space,
students still had to deal with seasick
ness. Osterwise found having barf bags
in her classrooms a little disturbing.
"However, this was balanced out by
having classes canceled due to rough
seas," she added.
Many students grew close to their
fellow shipmates after sharing these
common experiences.
" I n each country you're a little afraid
of what you're gonna face," Radotic
said. "Eveiyone's going through the
same thing, and it brought us all a lot
closer."
Residence Dean and Residential Ed
ucation Student Affairs Officer Anne
Dowd serves as the Semester at Sea rep
resentative at Stanford and was a mem
ber of the Student Life $taff for the pro
gram during the fall 2000 voyage. For
her particular trip, 23 Stanford stu
dents participated, giving the Universi
ty the third-highest representation
aboard the ship.
"Fhe group of students on each voy
age is dynamic and contributes im
mensely to the overall quality of the
program," Dowd said.
Powers found the program unique
and enriching.
"Through this experience I was able
to grow as a person in a way I couldn't
have had through any other program,"
Powers said.
Dowd shared his enthusiasm.
"In my opinion, it's impossible to
complete the semester and not be
changed in some way," she said.
