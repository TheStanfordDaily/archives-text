# Semester at Sea gives global perspective
## 
### CHELSEA DUDEK 
It's been called many things — "semester at sex,"
"party at sea," "the love boat" — but none of these
stereotypes serve as an accurate description of the Se
mester at Sea program, according to many partici
pants. Unlike the typical study-abroad program,
where students spend one or more quarters at a single
foreign location, Semester at Sea exposes students to
many cultures and people around the world.
Stanford students typically complete Semester at
Sea offered through the University of Pittsburgh. The
program has existed for over 30 years and has been
completed by over 35,000 students. Students visit nine
countries during the course of the 100-day voyage.
While this may seem like a long vacation, Semester
at Sea isn't all play. Hie program requires students to
take a minimum of 12 credits during their study.
Students choose from 70 different upper and lower
division courses offered through the College of Arts
and Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh. The pro
gram is designed with classes from many departments
so students with various academic backgrounds can
participate. All participants are required to take Geog
raphy 100: Global Perspectives, which provides an
overview of the areas and issues encountered during
the voyage.
