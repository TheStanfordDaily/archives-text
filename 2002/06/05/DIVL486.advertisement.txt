Congratulations
Graduating Seniors!
Thank you to all who helped Stanford divert 53% of its waste from the landfill this year.
No matter where you go this summer, be sure to conserve resources by reducing your waste, reusing and recycling
what ever you can, and buy items that have recycled content in them.
V*.. l/„ _,.,fl K3MoloiYi about oaybaoo,
Did T OU Know:
Very little degradation occurs in a landfill because water is kept out to reduce the chance of groundwater contamination.
Newspapers are still readable after 20 years, and food, such as T-bone steaks and hot dogs, remain relatively
unchanged for more than a decade.
Recycling aluminum saves 95% of the energy that would be requiredto mine bauxite ore and extract
alumina, the raw material needed to manufacture aluminum.
Glass never wears out - it can be recycled forever.
Waste paper accounts for about 40% of our garbage.
Recycled paper saves water. Recycled paper production uses 58% less water compared to virgin paper production.
Americans represent only 5% of the world's population, but generates 30% of the world's garbage.
When buried, some plastic materials may lost for 700 years.
Fallen leaves contain 50-80% of the nutrients that a tree extracts from the Earth.
9 By composting them, we're helping the earth replenish itself.
Used oil can be re-refined into new lubricating oil. Oil never wears out, it just gets dirty. If all used motor oil in the U.S.
were recycled, it would result in a savings of 1.3 million barrels of oil per day.
If you have a question about reducing, reusing, recycling,
buying recycled, or composting, please call or email us at:
