Arm injury interrupts
Winona Ryder's hearing
BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) —Winona Ryder's
preliminary hearing on shoplifting and drug charges was
interrupted Monday when she told the judge she was
struck by a television camera and was given time to see a
doctor for an arm injury.
Ryder arrived late, in time for only brief testimony by
a store security official before a lunch break, and then fur
ther testimony was postponed when Ryder told the judge
she had been hit on the elbow on the way in.
It was unclear which elbow was hurt: She cradled her
left elbow after walking through a crush of reporters at
the courthouse door, but when she emerged from the
judge's chambers her coat was off and she had a large
white bandage on her right elbow.
"At this point in time, I'm advised there is some
swelling," Superior Court Judge Elden S. Fox said,
adding that Ryder would be seen by a physician.

Former internees receive
high school diplomas
OXNARI), Calif. (AP) — Weeks before her Oxnard
High School graduation, Yoshie Fujita Hagiya was forced
from her home and sent to an internment camp to spend
graduation day surrounded by armed soldiers and
barbed wire fences.
Next week, after 60 years, the Japanese-American
woman gets her diploma. The 77-year-old grandmother
who missed graduation day in 1942 will don a cap and
gown for ceremonies at the high school June 14.
In the last 15 years, at high schools from inner-city Los
Angeles to rural Gilroy, dozens of former internees have
been recognized and, decades later, handed diplomas.
But as these survivors reach their 80s, the effort to fix an
old injustice has taken on added urgency.
At Oxnard High, 11 seniors were sent to relocation
camps in 1942. School officials say they have tried to
reach all of them for this month's recognition ceremony,
which is a first for the school. At least one has died and an
other can't be found. Others, including one from Wis
consin, plan to attend.
Wearing black gowns and mortarboards, they will sit
among the 2002 Oxnard High graduates. When their
names are called, they will walk across the stage, shake the
principal's hand and soak up the crowd's applause, just as
they would have six decades ago.
