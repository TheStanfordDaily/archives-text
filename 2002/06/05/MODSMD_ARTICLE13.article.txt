1990
On June 5, 1990, The Daily printed an ar
ticle about former Soviet Union President
Mikhail Gorbachev visiting Stanford.
"In a whirlwind of smiles, speeches, cam
era flashes and chants of protest, Soviet Pres
ident Mikhail Gobachev extended an open
hand to the Stanford campus yesterday on
one of the final legs of his five-day visit to the
United States.
"Introduced by University President Don
ald Kennedy as 'the architect of a great world
transformation,' Gorbachev charmed many
during a visit that culminated in the Soviet
leader's declaration to a cheering audience:
'The Cold War is now behind us. Let us not
wrangle over who won it.'
"Gorbachev, arriving at the Oval nearly an
hour late, wasted no time in plunging into the
crowds of the Quad to shake hands and ex
change greetings with the thousands of well
wishers there....
"The 47-car motorcade of the Soviet dele
gation raced down Campus Drive and
turned onto Palm Drive at 11:50 a.m., just an
hour after Gorbachev concluded a breakfast
discussion with former President Ronald
Reagan in San Francisco. Gorbachev and his
wife Raisa emerged from their car surround
ed by a tight ring of Secret Service and KGB
agents and were barely visible to television
cameras as they greeted Kennedy and other
members of the welcoming party."
Bottom Line: In 1990, Stanford warmly greeted Gor
bachev, but said farewell to the USSR just a year later.
