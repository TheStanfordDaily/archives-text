d G Willson Kimeli Naiyomah is a
Maasai warrior, raised to respond to
every emergency. But his upbringing
was of no use Sept. 11, as he watched
people crying in the streets during a
visit to New York City.
The feeling of helplessness stayed
with Naiyomah, and when he returned
to his village last month he told elders
about the attack on the World Tirade
Center that killed more than 2,800 peo
ple. Many of the Maasai of Enoosaen,
a village 250 miles southwest of Nairo
bi, had not heard of the terror attack.
Captivated and saddened, they decided
to show solidarity and on Sunday pre
sented the American people with 14
cows, the most prized and sacred pos
session in Maasai culture....
Naiyomah was in New York to visit
Kenya's U.N. ambassador. He is
studying pre-med at Stanford Univer
sity in California.
