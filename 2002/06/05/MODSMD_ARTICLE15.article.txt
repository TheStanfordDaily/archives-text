# SLAC researchers awarded grants

Researchers from Stanford and the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center w ill
team up with scientists from Russia and
Armenia this summer thanks to special
grants from the United States Civilian
Research and Development Founda
tion. The non-profit organization,
founded in 1995, awards two-year
grants to support poorly funded scien
tists from the former Soviet Union and
to build cooperative scientific relation
ships across international boundaries.
Several different groups received
funding of between $60,000 and
$100,000. The current projects include
research on polarizing electrons, the
study of microdiamonds, the creation
of photon beams of light and the appli
cation of mathematical proof theory to
theoretical computing.
James Clendenin, a SLAC physicist,
was granted $65,000 to study polarized
photocathodes with Yuri Mamaev of
the State Technical University in St. Pe
tersburg, Russia. The pair originally

met at a SI.AC workshop in 1993 and
had previously worked on a two-year
grant together beginning in 1997.
Clendenin expressed excitement that
he could collaborate with Mamaev's
team once again.
"One of the strengths of this propos
al is that there is crucial work to be done
both in Russia and the United States,"
he said. SLAC scientists will visit Russia
to provide specifications for the growth
of photocathode crystals in St. Peters
burg. Afterward, the Russian scientists
will use SLAC equipment to accurately
measure the crystals.
Polarized photocathodes are semi
conductor crystals used to generate
electrons that all spin in the same direc
tion. According to Clendenin, this re
search is important for future linear
colliders. "Polarization allows you to
separate unwanted background noise
of decay products," Clendenin said. "It
gives accurate measurements of the en
ergy involved."
"[Our technical idea is that] if this
project is successful, it will be a boost on
our plans for the Next Linear Collider,"

Clendenin said. The multi-national
Next Linear Collider project aims to
build a more powerful, 30-kilometer
long collider.
Clendenin said that while the goal of
fostering scientific collaboration is
good, politics might play a role in the
foundation's grants. He said that eco
nomic hardship can be a problem for
scientists in the former Soviet states.
Additional funding could divert scien
tists from applying their technological
expertise in so-called rogue nations,
and prevent a "brain drain" from the
Russian scientific community.
Although the dollar amounts of
these grants are fairly low, Clendenin
noted that money can be stretched
much further in the former Soviet re
publics. The grants "give these guys the
chance to do legitimate science," Clen
denin said.
"High-energy physics has always had
a tradition of working slightly beyond
the political frontier," SLAC
spokesman Neil Calder said. "Multina-
tional projects are the backbone
of the success of the high-energy
physics program at SLAG."
"For example," Galder said,
"the biggest experiment we're
currently running at SLAG has
600 physicists from 10 nations.
The paradox is that building this
big experiment is difficult in
terms of management and deliv
ering equipment from so many
different countries."
Despite the logistical chal
lenges, Galder said the field of
high-energy physics has demon

strated the power of internation
al collaboration.
Geological and Environmen
tal Sciences Prof. Juhn-Guang
Liou received a $100,000 grant
to investigate microdiarnonds
with Nikolai Sobolev in North
ern Kazakhstan. At less than half
a millimeter in diameter, micro
diamonds are not favored for
jewelry but may become impor
tant industrial tools for cutting
and polishing.
Philosophy Prof. Grigori
Mints (who also has a courtesy
appointment in mathematics and
computer science) and Vladimir
Orevkov from the Steklov Insti
tute of Mathematics in St. Peters
burg, Russia, were awarded

$53,000 to study complex com
puter Science problems using
proof theory.
SLAC user and University of
Massachusetts Prof. Peter Bosted
received $60,000 to study photon
beams with Robert Avagyan of
the Yerevan Physics Institute in
Armenia.
The grant program receives
monetary support from the U.S.
State Department, the National
Science Foundation, (he National
Institutes of Health, the Ameri
can Academy of Sciences, and
about 12 for-profit companies.
According to the grant program's
own data, its cooperative grants
have reached over 3,500 scien
tists and engineers since 1995.
