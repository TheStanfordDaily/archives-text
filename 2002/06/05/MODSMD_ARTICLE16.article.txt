IBM researchers have recently built
transistors out of carbon nanotubes that
are more efficient than silicon ones,
which form the basis of chips powering
modern computers. The study was pub
lished in Applied Physics Letters two
weeks ago. Nanotechnology is the sci
ence of building things on the molecular
level, and nanotubes are a hot commodi
ty because of their ability to conduct elec
tricity with minimal resistance. The IBM
researchers transmitted signals much
quicker in the carbon nanotubes than in
standard silicon wires. Full-scale use of
carbon nanotubes is still out of reach,
however. The researchers observed ran
dom behavior at the ends of the nan
otubes, which does not occur in silicon
transistors. Nanotubes' production is
also difficult and expensive.

researchers are watching the sun in an ef
fort to better predict space weather. Solar
flares lift billions of particles that impact
the magnetosphere, the magnetic field
around the Earth. The study published
in The Astrophysical Journal this April
describes how scientists can now better
track solar eruptions and predict their ef
fects. David Falconer, one of the authors,
described the sleuth work as simply
watching clouds and trying to predict if it
is going to rain. Solar flares can disrupt
transmissions on Earth, but are even
more dangerous to satellites orbiting the
planet, which are without atmospheric
protection. With better equipment, the
center hopes to eventually provide better
advance warnings.
Researchers in the Imperial College in
London have successfully transformed
mice stem cells into lung tissue. Stem cells
can theoretically transform into any kind
of cell. The ethical controversy is that
stem cells are currently obtained from

embryos. The United States has enforced
strict laws regulating stem cell research,
but the United Kingdom has been more
lenient. The English experiment raises
hope that stem cells might be used to re
generate damaged lung tissue. The re
searchers now are going to test their find
ings by growing cells in especially de
signed bioactive foams and scaffolds.
As South Korea expects almost half a
million visitors for the World Cup that
started this weekend, it is also mobilizing
to eliminate outbreaks of foot-and-mouth
disease. The disease is caused by a virus
carried by many types of livestock, espe
cially pigs. The disease does not affect hu
mans, though it can remain in their nasal

passages up to 28 hours. T he virus is extremely conta
gious, with a nearly 100 percent infection rate. Its
biggest economic effect is due to the fact that the disease
lessens milk production and debilitates livestock.
Britain suffered a massive outbreak in 2001, leading to
the slaughter of 4 million pigs and cows. The current
outbreak in Korea has claimed about 100,000 pigs.
Sustainable farming is no longer a concept restricted
to activists. Many scientists have embraced it too. Mod
ern agriculture is heavily based on specialization, artifi
cial selection and fertilizers. Specialization implies that a
farm is dedicated to a single crop, which tends to deplete
the soil quickly and unevenly. Artificial selection is an
age-old tradition: farmers select plants that yield best
harvest. This technique, however, reduces genetic vari
ability and increases the risk that a plague can devastate
an entire farm. Finally, fertilizers pollute the environ
ment. Collaboration among academic researchers and
companies has increased in recent years. Still, a recent
study by the University of Illinois has concluded that in
creasing awareness among farmers is crucial for sustain
able farming.
How did humans get to the Americas? The two main
theories claim that an ice bridge stretched between
Russia and Alaska, or that migrants and island-hopped
across the Pacific. Recent evidence suggests that both
migrations may have taken place. Archaeologists from
the National University of Australia are investigating
the second theory by assessing the development of sail
ing boats, linguists, agriculture and pottery in North
ern Philippines. The researchers hope to find evidence
linking the Philippine aborigines to Amerindians and
explaining what the early migrants brought to the New
World.
