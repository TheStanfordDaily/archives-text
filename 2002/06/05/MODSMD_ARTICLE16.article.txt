IBM researchers have recently built
transistors out of carbon nanotubes that
are more efficient than silicon ones,
which form the basis of chips powering
modern computers. The study was pub
lished in Applied Physics Letters two
weeks ago. Nanotechnology is the sci
ence of building things on the molecular
level, and nanotubes are a hot commodi
ty because of their ability to conduct elec
tricity with minimal resistance. The IBM
researchers transmitted signals much
quicker in the carbon nanotubes than in
standard silicon wires. Full-scale use of
carbon nanotubes is still out of reach,
however. The researchers observed ran
dom behavior at the ends of the nan
otubes, which does not occur in silicon
transistors. Nanotubes' production is
also difficult and expensive.
Who said space is void? National
Space Science and Technology Center

researchers are watching the sun in an ef
fort to better predict space weather. Solar
flares lift billions of particles that impact
the magnetosphere, the magnetic field
around the Earth. The study published
in The Astrophysical Journal this April
describes how scientists can now better
track solar eruptions and predict their ef
fects. David Falconer, one of the authors,
described the sleuth work as simply
watching clouds and trying to predict if it
is going to rain. Solar flares can disrupt
transmissions on Earth, but are even
more dangerous to satellites orbiting the
planet, which are without atmospheric
protection. With better equipment, the
center hopes to eventually provide better
advance warnings.
Researchers in the Imperial College in
London have successfully transformed
mice stem cells into lung tissue. Stem cells
can theoretically transform into any kind
of cell. The ethical controversy is that
stem cells are currently obtained from

embryos. The United States has enforced
strict laws regulating stem cell research,
but the United Kingdom has been more
lenient. The English experiment raises
hope that stem cells might be used to re
generate damaged lung tissue. The re
searchers now are going to test their find
ings by growing cells in especially de
signed bioactive foams and scaffolds.
As South Korea expects almost half a
million visitors for the World Cup that
started this weekend, it is also mobilizing
to eliminate outbreaks of foot-and-mouth
disease. The disease is caused by a virus
carried by many types of livestock, espe
cially pigs. The disease does not affect hu
mans, though it can remain in their nasal
