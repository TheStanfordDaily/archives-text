# Hurlbut participates in human cloning debate

### VICTOR REKLAITIS STAFF WRITER 
This month, the U.S. Senate will debate
and vote on long-delayed human cloning
legislation. Human Biology Prof. William
Hurlbut has participated in the national
discussion on the issue this year. He is a
member of the President's Council on
Bioethics, a group of 18 doctors, ethicists,
lawyers and scientists that advises the
White House on moral questions that arise
from advances in biomedical science and
technology.
The House ofßepresentatives voted to
ban human cloning entirely in July 2001
and the Senate was expected to debate this
issue in February or March.
"It would be better for the country if we
delayed this further, talked about it
longer and waited also for the President's
Council on Bioethics to issue a statement,"
Hurlbut said.
According to Hurlbut, the goal of the
council is not to reach a consensus, but in
stead to express a diversity of views, clarify
the issues and focus the debate.
The Senate is considering two main
bills. A bipartisan bill sponsored by Sena
tors Sam Brownback (R-Kansas)and Mary
Landreiu (D-Louisiana) would completely
ban human cloning. President George W.
Bush h&s asked the Senate to ratify this bill.
An alternative bill, also bipartisan,
would ban human cloning for reproduc
tive purposes but would allow it for bio
medical research. Backing this bill are sen
ators such as Dianne Feinstein (D-Califor
nia), Orrin Hatch (R-Utah),Ted Kennedy
(D-Massachusetts) and Arlen Specter (R-
Pennsylvania).
As reflected by both bills, most Ameri
cans currently oppose reproductive
cloning — creating babies that are genetic
copies of adults. They reject it either for
ethical reasons, or because of the inherent
risks. Soon after Scottish scientists present
ed Dolly, the cloned sheep, to the world in
1997, the California state legislature
passed a five-year moratorium on human
cloning for reproductive purposes.

The California moratorium did not ad
dress the matter on which the two U.S.
Senate bills currently disagree: human
cloning for research purposes, commonly
called "therapeutic cloning." Most scien
tists now describe this kind of work as "nu
clear transplantation."
Hurlbut described the procedure for
nuclear transplantation, technically de
fined as somatic cell nuclear transfer.
"First, they harvest eggs by hyper-stim
ulating the ovaries of a woman, a common,
practice in IVF [in vitro fertilization]," he
said. "This produces on average a dozen
eggs, most of which will not turn out to be
successfully fertilized."
Then, the somatic cell — often a skin
cell — enters the picture.
"They take the eggs and a somatic cell,
take the nucleus out of the egg, and put the
nucleus of the somatic cell into the egg,"
said Hurlbut. "Or alternatively they fuse
the cells, and the egg's nuclear material is
extruded."
According to Hurlbut, the cytoplasm of
the egg then reprograms the DNA of the
somatic cell nucleus to take it back to its
embryonic status.
"Once the reprogramming has taken
place, theoretically the cell produced is
equivalent to a zygote, which is a fertilized
egg," he said. "It follows a course that is the
same as natural human development, but
it joins the journey a little later."
It can then continue to develop in a
petri dish, and at the blastocyst stage four
to five days later, specific cells are removed
and cultured to establish embryonic stem
cell lines.
The major advantage of this technique
is that the resulting cells have the same ge
netic make-up as the somatic cell, so the so
matic cell donor's immune system does not
reject them when they are used in cellular
therapies. This type of work has the po
tential to find cures for diseases such as
Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease
and diabetes.
"The moral dilemma is that what is pro-
duced is an embryo," Hurlbut said.
"We may consider it an artifact
from a medical or scientific per
spective, as one member of the
council has proposed," he said.
"But from the standpoint of its
moral significance, it's probably ca
pable of being implanted and suc
cessfully gestated ... it has this
human potential."

The next President's Council on
Bioethics meeting to discuss this
issue is scheduled for June 19.
At the council's meeting on
April 25, Hurlbut said he appreci
ated hearing the perspective of
Catherine Verfaille, a researcher
from the University of Minnesota
who presented her findings.
Brownback and others who op
pose scientific research on em
bryos have used Verfaille's unveri
fied but remarkable results with
adult stem cells to bolster their ar
guments.

"But Verfaille herself affirms
that scientific inquiry across the
broadest front [work on both em
bryonic and adult cells) would be
ideal," Hurlbut said. "I think we
should acknowledge that."
"That doesn't remove the moral
questions, however, which we still
have to address, because there are
some things that would l>e beneficial
to do scientifically, that are preclud
ed by moral concerns — whether
nuclear transplantation is one of
them is the current debate," he said.
