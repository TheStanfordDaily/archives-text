## The 						Stanford Daily Protesters should honor pledge to avoid disruption 
### 
Published Since J !891

A group of Stanford students led by
senior Josh Zide, among others, has
condemned the selection of Nation
al Security Advisor and former Uni
versity Provost Condoleezza Rice as the
keynote speaker at this year's Commence
ment. The group has begun a petition drive
protesting Rice's selection, and intends to or
ganize formal protest events as well.
Students' freedom to express their opin
ions by staging protests is an important one.
However, we are concerned that the protest
movement spearheaded by Zide and his fellow
coordinators advances arguments that are
themselves anti-free speech in nature. The pe
tition circulated by the protestors unfairly im
pugns Rice's personal character, while their
tactics threaten to undermine their pledge to
refrain from disrupting the proceedings.
The protestors' leading objection to Rice
as Commencement speaker is that her opin
ions "do not represent our views or the views

of the Stanford community." But we see no
reason why holding views that agree politi
cally with particular segments of the Stanford
population should be a criterion for an ac
ceptable graduation speaker. The protestors'
argument amounts to saying that they want
to hear only speakers who share their politi
cal preferences.
That desire is narrow-minded and strik
ingly illiberal. Students should be willing to
listen to others — be they eminent public fig
ures or fellow students — with opinions dif
ferent from their own. A willingness to listen
to Rice does not mean one must necessarily
agree with what she says or the policy posi
tions she advocates.
The petition circulated by the protest
group incorrectly claims that by inviting Rice
to speak, the University affiliates itself "in an
official capacity" with her ideas and policy
stances. Not so. University President John
Hennessy and the members of the senior class

who voted to invite Rice have concluded only
that she is a qualified speaker with worthwhile
things to say. They have not in any way en
dorsed her political views.
Zide and his fellow protestors are correct,
however, in suggesting that the University has
"endorsed" Rice at some level. What Hen
nessy's invitation reveals is that he, and pre
sumably the senior class presidents regards
Rice as a responsible individual with sound
personal character. That conclusion does not
sound particularly outlandish to us, but the
protestors apparently think otherwise.
The list of allegations against Rice attached
to their petition includes the charge that she
has participated in the killing of "more Afghan
citizens than died in the World Trade Center."
The petition blasts Rice for advocating action
against Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, sug
gests she colluded in an alleged attempt by the
U.S. government "to subvert democracy in
Venezuela" via a military coup and calls her

statements about pre-Sept. 11 terrorist intelli
gence "blatant lies."
One gets the idea from reading the
protestors' bill of indictment that Rice is one
step away from war-criminal status. Such
charges are not supported by the evidence the
protestors claim to offer — mostly Internet
news links. Claiming that Rice acquiesced in
or even advocated the slaughter of thousands
of innocent Afghan citizens sounds more like a
personal smear campaign than a rational po
litical disagreement.
But then the protestors' petition shows a
disturbing inability to treat political disagree
ments for what they are: honest differences of
opinion. The petition lists a number of Bush
administration policies and other decisions
made by Rice while provost as evidence that
Rice herself does not measure up to the Fun
damental Standard.

This editorial represents the views of the members of The Daily's editorial board. The board consists of The Daily's editor in chief, managing editor for daily special sections, two opinions
editors and three community members at-large. Signed columns and contributions are the view of die writer and do not necessarily represent the view of the editorial board.
The protestors are welcome to dis
agree with Rice about her tenure de
cisions at Stanford or her advice to
support a ballistic missile shield, but
there is no reason to think these ac
tions and others like them constitute
great moral failings. Just because Rice
does not share the protestors' political
outlook does not mean she is a moral
ly reprehensible person.
The protestors' decision to contact
"outside groups" that also dislike
Rice's policies and invite them to join
in Commencement Weekend
protests sounds like a prelude to a po
tential media circus. We hope those
who object to Rice's presence will
honor their word and not disrupt
graduation exercises for other Stan
ford students and their guests.
More broadly, we hope that all Stan
ford students will take the time to ac
quaint themselves with Rice's biogra
phy and beliefs. She is a vastly influen
tial woman. Zide and his fellow
protestors should be applauded for
seeking to raise awareness about the
political issues in which Rice is in
volved. We only wish they would be
more open-minded, more fair, and
more respectful when doing so.

disturbing inability to treat political disagree
ments for what they are: honest differences of
opinion. The petition lists a number of Bush
administration policies and other decisions
made by Rice while provost as evidence that
Rice herself does not measure up to the Fun
damental Standard.

The protestors are welcome to dis
agree with Rice about her tenure de
cisions at Stanford or her advice to
support a ballistic missile shield, but
there is no reason to think these ac
tions and others like them constitute
great moral failings. Just because Rice
does not share the protestors' political
outlook does not mean she is a moral
ly reprehensible person.
The protestors' decision to contact
"outside groups" that also dislike
Rice's policies and invite them to join
in Commencement Weekend
protests sounds like a prelude to a po
tential media circus. We hope those
who object to Rice's presence will
honor their word and not disrupt
graduation exercises for other Stan
ford students and their guests.
More broadly, we hope that all Stan
ford students will take the time to ac
quaint themselves with Rice's biogra
phy and beliefs. She is a vastly influen
tial woman. Zide and his fellow
protestors should be applauded for
seeking to raise awareness about the
political issues in which Rice is in
volved. We only wish they would be
more open-minded, more fair, and
more respectful when doing so.
