# CANNONBALL COMING
## The end of a dream
### 
After four years at Stanford, Cali
fornia and I are both back to
where we started. After a few years
of having a crush on hip, fancy
companies that promised people the ability
to run their lives from the luxury of their
comfy corner couch, Silicon Valley is back to
what it was originally: a brilliant center of vi
brant, young, realistic companies trying to
prove that their good ideas can actually
make money, without providing a foosball
table in every office.
And, after a few years of dabbling in
economics and business and general b.s.
in the wilds of California, I'm back where
I was — reading and writing and pon-

dering current events
and international poli
tics, . .and sports.
My three-hour-long
stroll through the online
newspapers Monday
morning helped put ev
erything in perspective.
Amid talk of the World
Cup and the Lakers mas-

tery of the Kings, there was some real news
that would have dropped jaws a few years
ago.
Without much hype or publicity, Nap
ster declared bankruptcy.
The announcement got a little bit of
press — only because Napster got so much
pub in the first place. But the little coverage
it got told me that if truly is the end of an era.
'I"he bubble is burst and I'm graduating
from Stanford.
For many college students — mostly
male, mainly bespectacled — there was
nothing like Napster to demonstrate the
tine capabilities of the Internet.
True, through Amazon 1 could buy
Harry Potter translated into Urdu, on
EBay, a crocheted seat cushion made by a
woman sitting on her front porch in Mobile,
Ala., and at Pets.com, a five-pound bag of
dry cat food with hairball control. But Nap
ster had so much more power. I mean, it
was all about the music, man.
Within minutes, you could download al
most any song by any artist without paying
any money. You could make your own
soundtrack for studying or a rollicking
party mix. Or, like my friend, you could cre
ate a sonic backdrop for love. Because, as we
learn in "American Pimps," "it's not about
the matrimony, it's about the mack-a-roni."
Napster will probably live on. On May
17, it was bought by Bertelsmanm AG, the
German media conglomerate, with the
bankruptcy filing included as part of the
deal, in order to decrease Bertelsmann's lia
bilities. Bertelsmann will likely fold Napster
into its stable of subsidiaries and move on.
Even if Napster never resurfaces, aficiona
dos have a host of other "sharing" applica
tions to choose from.
But the saddest part of the whole
thing is that Bertelsmann paid only $8
million for Napster. In the summer of

2000, just a couple of years ago, valuing
your company at $8 million wasn't
enough even to start a conversation.
That summer, between my sophomore
and junior years at Stanford, I started a
company with three friends in a room in
Roble. For us, Napster was just the first step.
We were going to do what legendary
founder Shawn Fanning and his friends
couldn't — pay the bands and pay the fans.
The only problem was that none of us could
program more than 10 lines of code.
But back then it didn't really matter.
We educated ourselves about the music
industry and about organizing a compa
ny, writing a business plan, creating fi
nancial projections and on and on. We
concocted a 20-page map of the compa
ny's future and five years of in-depth pro
jections. Armed with our papers, we set
out to pimp some old guys. We bulled our
way into a meeting with some Venture
Capitalists. Then we dreamed.
Looking at my spot-on projections again,
we were scheduled to break even next year.
Two years later we were supposed to rake in
over $50 million a year in profit. My friend's
only concern was whether he could afford a
Lotus or settle fora Ferrari. Yeah, we were
in the game for all the right reasons.
It quickly crumbled around us. We were
two months and 20 programmers too late.
More than close enough to smell the bills but
not near enough to feel a stack.
Before we crashed, I had a conversation
or two with my parents about what I would
do if this thing really worked out. I'd take a
year off of school or something. I'd try to
make it as an Internet entrepreneur. I'd get
rich and pay for school on my own.
Then a few weeks after that, I was back
at school learning about war and weapons
and politics and other dorky things that I
find interesting. Now I'm graduating on
time with negative dollars to my name,
scrimping until the graduation gifts start
piling up so I can move to Washington
D.C. and start busing tables.
After all that, I still don't really under
stand how to set up my bookmarks on
Netscape. I don't even remember how our
business was going to work. Yet I can still
look back at my time at Stanford and know
that, fora few short months, I was in the
middle of the game.
With graduation coming oh-so-shortly,
I'm right back where I started. But the jour
ney to California — through the Internet
bubble and the high-flying dot-com times
— and then back to the stately, sober na
tion's capital has been well worth it.
Of course, I wouldn't have minded a
Porsche or two for the trip back cross
country.
