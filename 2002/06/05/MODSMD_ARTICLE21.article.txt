Flag burning not a 'party game'
This past Saturday night, we were
deeply saddened by an event meant to
protest "The Man's" control of American
society. We watched as an American flag
erupted in flames in Columbae house's
front yard, to the delight of throngs of elat
ed onlookers. Viewing a scene that more
closely resembled a cultish ceremony than
a party, our stomachs turned as the "par
tygoers" roasted marsh mallows over the
anti-patriotic embers.
This is not the first time we have been
saddened to see Columbae's defaming the
U.S. flag, a symbol of the very same pro
tected speech that allowed such an inci
dent to lawfully occur. We clearly remem
ber, in the immediate wake of the
tragedies that plagued our country late
last year, seeing a U.S. flag flying proudly
above Columbae's front door. However,
on closer examination, we noticed that this
was no ordinary flag. Instead of stars, tiny
corporate logos dotted the blue square.
We felt queasy then too. So soon after
Sept. 11, this was hardly a fitting display.
While we strongly support everyone's
right to protest the status quo, we feel
there are both appropriate and inappro
priate ways of expressing these concerns.
On this spectrum, flag burning occupies
the unconscionable realm.
To us, burning a flag is a protest against
everything this country stands for. Of
course this includes a number of social and
political problems, but also includes the
countless ways in which America nurtures
and protects its own citizens.
Burning the flag, an act of free speech
upheld by the Supreme Court in 1990 as
constitutional, protests free speech. It
cries out against civil liberties, discards
the notions of fair trials, and questions

the validity of democracy.
Perhaps most importantly, setting a
flag aflame is essentially a hollow act; it ob
viates the rational debate that should ac
company any issue of concern. We see no
positive outcome. As far as we could see, it
only gave an angry, inebriated mob brief
pleasure, while giving us a nauseous feel
ing that has yet to subside.
Protests are typically aimed at increas
ing awareness through social action. Ide
ally, they open peoples' minds to new
ideas in hopes of eliciting change. Colum
bae's flag burning has served the opposite
cause. It has made their views appear so
extreme and disrespectful of the very fab
ric of this country that our eyes and ears
are now closed to whatever useful mes
sages they may have.
Hag burning is not frivolous enough to
be a party game. Supporting it makes a
bold statement that deeply offends many
Americans and protests more issues than
anyone can even begin to comprehend.

Union disagrees with editorial
I am glad that The Daily supports
equal pay for equal work. Anyone work
ing full-time should be able to support
themselves and their families, and not be
relegated to a life of endless and poverty.
This holds particularly true amidst the
wealth at Stanford.
Rut I take issue with the opinion ex
pressed by The Daily editorial t hat the stu
dents' appeals to University President

John Hennessy are misguided and inef
fective. Negotiations between the United
Stanford Workers and Bon Appetit occur
within the constraints of a contract be
tween Bon Appetit and Stanford. The
University has the ability to alter the terms
of this contract.
Furthermore, Bon Appetit depends on
Stanford for both income and public
image. It places high value on its presence
here, and do not want their contract with
Stanford dissolved. An important source
of income for Bon Appetit would dissolve
as well, and they would face public embar
rassment. It must pay close attention if
pressured by the University administra
tion to change its ways.
We believed it was not enough to pres
sure Bon Appetit management, knowing
that if our message could be transmitted
through the President's office, it would
likely be heeded â€” instead of merely
being heard.
We were right. Before the students' ac
tions this week, Bon Appetit's offer was a
25-cent increase. Thursday night we
reached an agreement with Bon Appetit
that achieved wage parity with directly
hired employees after two years of wage
increases. We won huge benefit improve
ments that will provide health care for em
ployees at no cost, and for their families at
greatly reduced costs.
This was a tremendous victory, one that
for many workers heralds an end to living
in poverty. It would not have been possi
ble without the pressure brought to bear
on Bon Appetit by the President's office,
and such pressure would not have been
produced without the outstanding efforts
of students throughout the week.
