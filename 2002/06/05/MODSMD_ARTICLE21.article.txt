Flag burning not a 'party game'
This past Saturday night, we were
deeply saddened by an event meant to
protest "The Man's" control of American
society. We watched as an American flag
erupted in flames in Columbae house's
front yard, to the delight of throngs of elat
ed onlookers. Viewing a scene that more
closely resembled a cultish ceremony than
a party, our stomachs turned as the "par
tygoers" roasted marsh mallows over the
anti-patriotic embers.
This is not the first time we have been
saddened to see Columbae's defaming the
U.S. flag, a symbol of the very same pro
tected speech that allowed such an inci
dent to lawfully occur. We clearly remem
ber, in the immediate wake of the
tragedies that plagued our country late
last year, seeing a U.S. flag flying proudly
above Columbae's front door. However,
on closer examination, we noticed that this
was no ordinary flag. Instead of stars, tiny
corporate logos dotted the blue square.
We felt queasy then too. So soon after
Sept. 11, this was hardly a fitting display.
While we strongly support everyone's
right to protest the status quo, we feel
there are both appropriate and inappro
priate ways of expressing these concerns.
On this spectrum, flag burning occupies
the unconscionable realm.
To us, burning a flag is a protest against
everything this country stands for. Of
course this includes a number of social and
political problems, but also includes the
countless ways in which America nurtures
and protects its own citizens.
Burning the flag, an act of free speech
upheld by the Supreme Court in 1990 as
constitutional, protests free speech. It
cries out against civil liberties, discards
the notions of fair trials, and questions

the validity of democracy.
Perhaps most importantly, setting a
flag aflame is essentially a hollow act; it ob
viates the rational debate that should ac
company any issue of concern. We see no
positive outcome. As far as we could see, it
only gave an angry, inebriated mob brief
pleasure, while giving us a nauseous feel
ing that has yet to subside.
Protests are typically aimed at increas
ing awareness through social action. Ide
ally, they open peoples' minds to new
ideas in hopes of eliciting change. Colum
bae's flag burning has served the opposite
cause. It has made their views appear so
extreme and disrespectful of the very fab
ric of this country that our eyes and ears
are now closed to whatever useful mes
sages they may have.
Hag burning is not frivolous enough to
be a party game. Supporting it makes a
bold statement that deeply offends many
Americans and protests more issues than
anyone can even begin to comprehend.

Union disagrees with editorial
I am glad that The Daily supports
equal pay for equal work. Anyone work
ing full-time should be able to support
themselves and their families, and not be
relegated to a life of endless and poverty.
This holds particularly true amidst the
wealth at Stanford.
Rut I take issue with the opinion ex
pressed by The Daily editorial t hat the stu
dents' appeals to University President

John Hennessy are misguided and inef
fective. Negotiations between the United
Stanford Workers and Bon Appetit occur
within the constraints of a contract be
tween Bon Appetit and Stanford. The
University has the ability to alter the terms
of this contract.
Furthermore, Bon Appetit depends on
Stanford for both income and public
image. It places high value on its presence
here, and do not want their contract with
Stanford dissolved. An important source
of income for Bon Appetit would dissolve
as well, and they would face public embar
rassment. It must pay close attention if
pressured by the University administra
tion to change its ways.
We believed it was not enough to pres
sure Bon Appetit management, knowing
that if our message could be transmitted
through the President's office, it would
likely be heeded — instead of merely
being heard.
We were right. Before the students' ac
tions this week, Bon Appetit's offer was a
25-cent increase. Thursday night we
reached an agreement with Bon Appetit
that achieved wage parity with directly
hired employees after two years of wage
increases. We won huge benefit improve
ments that will provide health care for em
ployees at no cost, and for their families at
greatly reduced costs.
This was a tremendous victory, one that
for many workers heralds an end to living
in poverty. It would not have been possi
ble without the pressure brought to bear
on Bon Appetit by the President's office,
and such pressure would not have been
produced without the outstanding efforts
of students throughout the week.
I here have been teach-ins on a living
wage this academic year, but a forum, as
suggested by The Daily, would hardly pro
vide the needed influence in the final and
critical days of negotiations.
Protestors utilized alternate methods,
such as sleeping out in the Main Quad,
surrounded by banners and testimonials
of campus workers. In the end, their suc
cessful actions won a huge victory for
dozens of workers.

Coalition writes to thank supporters
Hie Stanford Labor Action Coalition
and the Coalition for Labor Justice would
like to thank everyone who demonstrated
support for Bon Appetit workers in the
past month — from faculty members who
sent letters, to petition signers, to those
who slept in front of Building 10.
Last Friday, after a month-long struggle,
Bon Appetit workers finally won their de
mands for parity in wages and benefits with
direcdy-hired workers. This victory would
have been impossible without the support of
the Stanford community. The work of
groups like the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored Persons, Students
for Environmental Action at Stanford,

MEChA, Stanford Community for Peace
and Justice, and the Black Student Union
helped forge a coalition with Bon Appetit
workers that made this victory possible.
We would also like to thank Bon Ap
petit and the University administration for
coming together and finding a just solu
tion to this labor dispute. Even though the
University did not provide any financial
assistance to Bon Appetit, it is clear that
significant progress in negotiations came
only after students pressured the Univer
sity's administration.
We commend the administration on its
willingness to set a high labor standard of
parity in wages and benefits for the ven
dors and subcontractors on this campus.
We also commend Bon Appetit for en
suring that its workers on the Stanford
campus earn wages that allow workers to
live above the poverty line. We encourage
the Stanford community to support re
sponsible labor practices by taking their
business to Bon Appetit.
The struggle to end poverty wages at
Stanford is far from over. There continue
to be workers who are earn wages as low as
$7.50 per hour, who go without health
care for themselves and their families, and
who experience racial, gender, sexual and
language discrimination on the job.
It is for these reasons that a Code of
Conduct for Employment at Stanford is
crucial. The labor practices of all subcon
tractors and vendors at Stanford must be
regulated. We hope the victory of Bon Ap
petit workers will serve as a preliminary
framework for the implementation of
such a policy.

The Stanford Labor Action Coalition
and the Coalition for Labor Justice will
continue to fight until this universal policy
is enacted.
Finally, we ask that the communities
and allies who showed their support in the
Bon Appetit struggle to actively continue
to help in the fight for labor justice at Stan
ford. We also hope that this significant vic
tory will help more people understand
just how powerful the voice of unified
communities can be.
Next time you hear of a rally or an ac
tion, please take the time to show your sup
port. Your presence can contribute to the
enactment of fair labor practices on cam
pus. Thank you to all of our supporters.

Seniors 'expect much more from
a cartoon dog'
We would like to add our support to the
letter written last week opposing Milo the
Dog's column on masturbation.

We ourselves have just come to terms
with the deleterious effects of self-love on
the lives of young people. In order to stay
home to watch pornography and mastur
bate, we were frequently forced to miss
such riveting Stanford events as Midnight
Breakfast, the post office's student appre
ciation day, and even a recent party at
Sterling Quad.
In fact, due to the large amount of
funds we have spent on lubricant and vi
brators to support our habit, we were
both nearly unable to pay our Phi Beta
Kappa dues this spring. Furthermore,
there is no way to describe the heartache
we feel when a vibrator breaks, nor the
emotional terror of our occasional vibra
tor-induced pregnancy and Venereal
Disease scares.
Scores of boyfriends have broken up
with us claiming they would prefer that
we bed the entire football team instead
of pleasuring ourselves. In an age of
rampant teenage pregnancy and AIDS,
we of course can't help but agree with
them.
Because masturbation is such an inher
ently public act, Me felt that we should
share this with you, our peers, in order to
attempt to force your views to conform to
our own. In the end, we are very disap
pointed in The Daily, Intermission and
Milo. We would expect much more from a
cartoon dog.

This holds particularly true amidst the
wealth at Stanford.
Rut I take issue with the opinion ex
pressed by The Daily editorial t hat the stu
dents' appeals to University President

John Hennessy are misguided and inef
fective. Negotiations between the United
Stanford Workers and Bon Appetit occur
within the constraints of a contract be
tween Bon Appetit and Stanford. The
University has the ability to alter the terms
of this contract.
Furthermore, Bon Appetit depends on
Stanford for both income and public
image. It places high value on its presence
here, and do not want their contract with
Stanford dissolved. An important source
of income for Bon Appetit would dissolve
as well, and they would face public embar
rassment. It must pay close attention if
pressured by the University administra
tion to change its ways.
We believed it was not enough to pres
sure Bon Appetit management, knowing
that if our message could be transmitted
through the President's office, it would
likely be heeded — instead of merely
being heard.
We were right. Before the students' ac
tions this week, Bon Appetit's offer was a
25-cent increase. Thursday night we
reached an agreement with Bon Appetit
that achieved wage parity with directly
hired employees after two years of wage
increases. We won huge benefit improve
ments that will provide health care for em
ployees at no cost, and for their families at
greatly reduced costs.
This was a tremendous victory, one that
for many workers heralds an end to living
in poverty. It would not have been possi
ble without the pressure brought to bear
on Bon Appetit by the President's office,
and such pressure would not have been
produced without the outstanding efforts
of students throughout the week.
I here have been teach-ins on a living
wage this academic year, but a forum, as
suggested by The Daily, would hardly pro
vide the needed influence in the final and
critical days of negotiations.
Protestors utilized alternate methods,
such as sleeping out in the Main Quad,
surrounded by banners and testimonials
of campus workers. In the end, their suc
cessful actions won a huge victory for
dozens of workers.

Coalition writes to thank supporters
Hie Stanford Labor Action Coalition
and the Coalition for Labor Justice would
like to thank everyone who demonstrated
support for Bon Appetit workers in the
past month — from faculty members who
sent letters, to petition signers, to those
who slept in front of Building 10.
Last Friday, after a month-long struggle,
Bon Appetit workers finally won their de
mands for parity in wages and benefits with
direcdy-hired workers. This victory would
have been impossible without the support of
the Stanford community. The work of
groups like the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored Persons, Students
for Environmental Action at Stanford,

MEChA, Stanford Community for Peace
and Justice, and the Black Student Union
helped forge a coalition with Bon Appetit
workers that made this victory possible.
We would also like to thank Bon Ap
petit and the University administration for
coming together and finding a just solu
tion to this labor dispute. Even though the
University did not provide any financial
assistance to Bon Appetit, it is clear that
significant progress in negotiations came
only after students pressured the Univer
sity's administration.
We commend the administration on its
willingness to set a high labor standard of
parity in wages and benefits for the ven
dors and subcontractors on this campus.
We also commend Bon Appetit for en
suring that its workers on the Stanford
campus earn wages that allow workers to
live above the poverty line. We encourage
the Stanford community to support re
sponsible labor practices by taking their
business to Bon Appetit.
The struggle to end poverty wages at
Stanford is far from over. There continue
to be workers who are earn wages as low as
$7.50 per hour, who go without health
care for themselves and their families, and
who experience racial, gender, sexual and
language discrimination on the job.
It is for these reasons that a Code of
Conduct for Employment at Stanford is
crucial. The labor practices of all subcon
tractors and vendors at Stanford must be
regulated. We hope the victory of Bon Ap
petit workers will serve as a preliminary
framework for the implementation of
such a policy.

The Stanford Labor Action Coalition
and the Coalition for Labor Justice will
continue to fight until this universal policy
is enacted.
Finally, we ask that the communities
and allies who showed their support in the
Bon Appetit struggle to actively continue
to help in the fight for labor justice at Stan
ford. We also hope that this significant vic
tory will help more people understand
just how powerful the voice of unified
communities can be.
Next time you hear of a rally or an ac
tion, please take the time to show your sup
port. Your presence can contribute to the
enactment of fair labor practices on cam
pus. Thank you to all of our supporters.

Seniors 'expect much more from
a cartoon dog'
We would like to add our support to the
letter written last week opposing Milo the
Dog's column on masturbation.

We ourselves have just come to terms
with the deleterious effects of self-love on
the lives of young people. In order to stay
home to watch pornography and mastur
bate, we were frequently forced to miss
such riveting Stanford events as Midnight
Breakfast, the post office's student appre
ciation day, and even a recent party at
Sterling Quad.
In fact, due to the large amount of
funds we have spent on lubricant and vi
brators to support our habit, we were
both nearly unable to pay our Phi Beta
Kappa dues this spring. Furthermore,
there is no way to describe the heartache
we feel when a vibrator breaks, nor the
emotional terror of our occasional vibra
tor-induced pregnancy and Venereal
Disease scares.
Scores of boyfriends have broken up
with us claiming they would prefer that
we bed the entire football team instead
of pleasuring ourselves. In an age of
rampant teenage pregnancy and AIDS,
we of course can't help but agree with
them.
Because masturbation is such an inher
ently public act, Me felt that we should
share this with you, our peers, in order to
attempt to force your views to conform to
our own. In the end, we are very disap
pointed in The Daily, Intermission and
Milo. We would expect much more from a
cartoon dog.

Flag burning not a 'party game'
This past Saturday night, we were
deeply saddened by an event meant to
protest "The Man's" control of American
society. We watched as an American flag
erupted in flames in Columbae house's
front yard, to the delight of throngs of elat
ed onlookers. Viewing a scene that more
closely resembled a cultish ceremony than
a party, our stomachs turned as the "par
tygoers" roasted marsh mallows over the
anti-patriotic embers.
This is not the first time we have been
saddened to see Columbae's defaming the
U.S. flag, a symbol of the very same pro
tected speech that allowed such an inci
dent to lawfully occur. We clearly remem
ber, in the immediate wake of the
tragedies that plagued our country late
last year, seeing a U.S. flag flying proudly
above Columbae's front door. However,
on closer examination, we noticed that this
was no ordinary flag. Instead of stars, tiny
corporate logos dotted the blue square.
We felt queasy then too. So soon after
Sept. 11, this was hardly a fitting display.
While we strongly support everyone's
right to protest the status quo, we feel
there are both appropriate and inappro
priate ways of expressing these concerns.
On this spectrum, flag burning occupies
the unconscionable realm.
To us, burning a flag is a protest against
everything this country stands for. Of
course this includes a number of social and
political problems, but also includes the
countless ways in which America nurtures
and protects its own citizens.
Burning the flag, an act of free speech
upheld by the Supreme Court in 1990 as
constitutional, protests free speech. It
cries out against civil liberties, discards
the notions of fair trials, and questions

the validity of democracy.
Perhaps most importantly, setting a
flag aflame is essentially a hollow act; it ob
viates the rational debate that should ac
company any issue of concern. We see no
positive outcome. As far as we could see, it
only gave an angry, inebriated mob brief
pleasure, while giving us a nauseous feel
ing that has yet to subside.
Protests are typically aimed at increas
ing awareness through social action. Ide
ally, they open peoples' minds to new
ideas in hopes of eliciting change. Colum
bae's flag burning has served the opposite
cause. It has made their views appear so
extreme and disrespectful of the very fab
ric of this country that our eyes and ears
are now closed to whatever useful mes
sages they may have.
Hag burning is not frivolous enough to
be a party game. Supporting it makes a
bold statement that deeply offends many
Americans and protests more issues than
anyone can even begin to comprehend.

tion to this labor dispute. Even though the
University did not provide any financial
assistance to Bon Appetit, it is clear that
significant progress in negotiations came
only after students pressured the Univer
sity's administration.
We commend the administration on its
willingness to set a high labor standard of
parity in wages and benefits for the ven
dors and subcontractors on this campus.
We also commend Bon Appetit for en
suring that its workers on the Stanford
campus earn wages that allow workers to
live above the poverty line. We encourage
the Stanford community to support re
sponsible labor practices by taking their
business to Bon Appetit.
The struggle to end poverty wages at
Stanford is far from over. There continue
to be workers who are earn wages as low as
$7.50 per hour, who go without health
care for themselves and their families, and
who experience racial, gender, sexual and
language discrimination on the job.
It is for these reasons that a Code of
Conduct for Employment at Stanford is
crucial. The labor practices of all subcon
tractors and vendors at Stanford must be
regulated. We hope the victory of Bon Ap
petit workers will serve as a preliminary
framework for the implementation of
such a policy.

The Stanford Labor Action Coalition
and the Coalition for Labor Justice will
continue to fight until this universal policy
is enacted.
Finally, we ask that the communities
and allies who showed their support in the
Bon Appetit struggle to actively continue
to help in the fight for labor justice at Stan
ford. We also hope that this significant vic
tory will help more people understand
just how powerful the voice of unified
communities can be.
Next time you hear of a rally or an ac
tion, please take the time to show your sup
port. Your presence can contribute to the
enactment of fair labor practices on cam
pus. Thank you to all of our supporters.

Seniors 'expect much more from
a cartoon dog'
We would like to add our support to the
letter written last week opposing Milo the
Dog's column on masturbation.

We ourselves have just come to terms
with the deleterious effects of self-love on
the lives of young people. In order to stay
home to watch pornography and mastur
bate, we were frequently forced to miss
such riveting Stanford events as Midnight
Breakfast, the post office's student appre
ciation day, and even a recent party at
Sterling Quad.
In fact, due to the large amount of
funds we have spent on lubricant and vi
brators to support our habit, we were
both nearly unable to pay our Phi Beta
Kappa dues this spring. Furthermore,
there is no way to describe the heartache
we feel when a vibrator breaks, nor the
emotional terror of our occasional vibra
tor-induced pregnancy and Venereal
Disease scares.
Scores of boyfriends have broken up
with us claiming they would prefer that
we bed the entire football team instead
of pleasuring ourselves. In an age of
rampant teenage pregnancy and AIDS,
we of course can't help but agree with
them.
Because masturbation is such an inher
ently public act, Me felt that we should
share this with you, our peers, in order to
attempt to force your views to conform to
our own. In the end, we are very disap
pointed in The Daily, Intermission and
Milo. We would expect much more from a
cartoon dog.
