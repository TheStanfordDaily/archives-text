# RUNNING ON EMPTY
## Aagh! Nostalgia and panic 
### 
Aaaaaaaugh! Commencement is 11 days
away, I have no job, no place to live and
an anxious pack of relatives who call with
increasing frequency demanding tickets
to the Senior Class Day Luncheon. Apart from
lying motionless on the fkx)r and groaning, ran
dom shrieking has become my primary mode of
communication.
Aaaaaaaugh!
In these, the last gasping breaths of our time at
Stanford, the two basic emotions of a graduating se
nior are nostalgia and panic.
Even the most mundane tasks are fraught with

the knowledge that you could be
doing them for the Last Time. Oh
sweet Old Union drop box —is
this the last pink phone-bill enve
lope I will give you? The guy who
glares at me when he swipes my
card in Tresidder Fitness—will we
ever meet again?
Worse than the knowledge that
we have to graduate is the gnaw-

ing suspicion that we won't be able to. From the day
the commencement checklist arrives from the Reg
istrar, every senior lives with the harrowing fear that
diere is some form unfilled, some signature unob
tained, some secret meeting you forgot to attend
diat will block you from your diploma like an angry
nightclub bouncer.
There is the pulse-stopping nightmare that you
will find yourself on June 16 two units short, out of
luck and explaining to your poor grandmother
who came all the way from Palm Desert why you're
watching Wacky Walk from the stands.
In the quiet moments, graduation is a time for
reflecting on the past and looking towards the fu
ture. For example, was the English major the right
choice for me? Or should I have considered a
course of study that might have given me a shot in
hell of ever getting a job? How can I translate a B+
in Sleep and Dreams into a lucrative entry-level po
sition? In terms of housing, what provides more in
sulation, a Dumpster or a cardboard box?
As much as I have loved Stanford, in my heart I
know it is time to leave. And on some level, that is
OK. I am tired of paying large bills every quarter to
the University and am looking forward to paying
large bills eveiy month to the gas, water, power and
phone companies.
I am moving to Washington, DC., with four fan
tastic people. We will cook each other dinner, play
Yahtzee every night after work and have zany, sit
com-worthy adventures. It's going to be great.

I think I would feel better if there was just some
sort of assurance that things are going to turn out
OK. I don't have to know where exacdy I'll end up
or who I will meet along the way.
However, I would appreciate some confirma
tion that I am not going to default on my loan, get
a job in telemarketing, grow facial hair and die
alone in a dusty house filled with teddy-bear knick
knacks and cats.
Maybe knowing would take the fun out of it. Part
of what has me excited about next year—and con
sequently, makes it okay to leave this place—is the
fact that for the first time in my life there is no neon
arrow pointing to the next direction. Four years
ago, the acceptance letter from Stanford felt like
proof that whatever the question was, I had given
the right answer. 11 was a ticket to something better.
Now, all I have are questions with answers 1 have
to find somewhere else. My diploma also feels like a
ticket, but with no destination written on it. It's ex
hilarating. Anyone who says they are not at least a
litde bit scared is a big fat liar.
This is my last column. It's hard to believe that
it's over—the good times we shared, the laughter,
the tears. Writing this has been a lot of fun. I'd es
pecially like to thank the people who wrote to me or
to The Daily about something they saw in here.
Here's a peek inside the mailbag:
From an alum: "It really took all of my self-con
trol to stay awake while reading the tired, old cliches
dished out by Con ine [sic] Purtill."
From a visiting Swedish engineer: "Maybe we
can meet in the future? I'm a total freak. But I look
great."
From my dad: "I read your latest article [on. the
Sexual Health Peer Resource Center] and believe
that you have offered a valuable service to fellow
students.... That being said, a future article should
be entitled '101 reasons why you shouldn't give
your grandmother a link to The Stanford Daily's
Web site.'"
Also, I received a number of column sugges
tions. In the few words I have left, here are sum
maries of the best.
Tenacious D: Yeah!
White people with dreadlocks: No.
Jonathan Stull: ?
OK, that's it. Good luck to you. I hope your path
is a good one, and if ours should cross, please stop
and say hello. There will always be a special place in
my Dumpster just for you.
