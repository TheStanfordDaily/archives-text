# SHOOTING FROM THE HIP
## Blow 'em back to the stone age 
### 
By now we're well into the
summer movie season,
when the studios annually
trot out their high-octane,
slam-bang thrillers. As I write this,
Ben Affleck is busy traipsing around
Russia, trying to stop nuclear war in
"The Sum of All Fears." Natalie
Portman is baring her midriff and
saving a whole galaxy in "Star Wars:
Episode II," while Toby Maguire is
mixing awesome superpowers with
teenage angst in "Spider-man."
We're all set for an entire summer

filled with car chas
es, explosions, elab
orate martial arts se
quences and, of
course, guns. Lots
and lots of guns.
Summer movies fea
ture more guns than
an entire National
Rifle Association

convention. And while there's noth
ing wrong with this per se, Holly
wood really needs to get its act to
gether when it comes to accurate
portrayals of gun violence. Film
makers apparently have no idea
what kind of damage a bullet actual
ly does to the human body, and their
ignorance shows.
Movies are chock-full of gun
gaffes, firearm follies and ballistics
bloopers. Look for these common
mistakes, coming to a theater near
you:
First, "Get the bullet out!" This is
my all-time favorite. A good guy gets
shot, and they rush him to the hos
pital, where surgeons frantically at
tempt to remove the bullet from his
body. There's a scene in "Ronin"
where Robert de Niro is so obsessed
with fishing a bullet out of his side
that he pays a shady underground
doctor to poke around in his chest
cavity for it, sans anesthesia. Even
more absurdly, in "Terminator 2"
Linda Hamilton spends several min
utes pulling bullets out of Arnold
Schwarzenegger, who is — ahem —
a robot.

1 have yet to understand why
movie characters are so anxious to
pull bullets out of people. Nine
times out of 10, real-life doctors
don't bother. After all, a bullet does
its damage by making big holes in
people's bodies. It doesn't make
sense to cut more holes in the poor
gunshot victim, just to extract a lit
tle piece of metal that's sitting qui
etly inside. And no, a lead-cored
bullet will not give you lead poison
ing if you leave it in. At worst, you
might set off some really sensitive
airport metal detectors.
Second, "the benign shoulder
shot." It's an article of faith in Holly
wood that when a character gets
shot in the shoulder, that's code for
"They winged him, but he'll be OK."
Filmmakers have an absolute love
affair the shoulder as the preferred
spot for not-too-serious gunshot in
juries. For example, in another
Schwarzenegger flick, "Eraser," our
friend Arnold gets shot clean
through the shoulder, but can still
use that arm to support his entire
body weight during a fistfight atop a
crane.
The truth about shoulder
wounds isn't so pretty. Not only will
a bullet through the shoulder land
you in the hospital fora long time,
there's a really good chance that
you'll be crippled for life. All the
nerves for your arm run right un
derneath the shoulder joint, and a
bullet is likely to slice clean through
them. After getting shot in the
shoulder, you'd be lucky if you can
ever again raise the affected arm
above your head, let alone perform
death-defy ing stunts with it.
To all the future filmmakers
reading this: For non-serious gun
shot wounds, feel free to use the
forearm. Or the lower leg. Even the
abdomen is probably OK, with
today's modern antibiotics to ward
off infection. But for the love of God,
don't keep shooting your characters
in the one place, other than the
spine, that's most likely to cause per

manent paralysis.
Third, "Blow the guy through
the plate glass window." This one is
also know as "blow the guy off the
side of the building," and "blow the
guy into the swimming pool, where
his blood stains the water red." Film
makers have this peculiar notion
that bullets can lift people off their
feet and fling them backwards sever
al yards, like tornado-force winds.
In real-life, on the other hand, it's
hard to even knock a good-sized
man down with anything less than a
high-caliber machine gun. Certainly
a handgun or rifle wouldn't do the
trick.
The ironic thing is, after seeing so
many violent movies, most real-life
gunshot victims are genuinely sur
prised when the bullet fails to fling
them backwards. In fact, due to the
surprising lack of force, it usually
takes them a few seconds to even re
alize that they've been shot. Such is
the power of Hollywood: When
filmmakers tell us that bullets send
people tumbling backwards, we ac
tually believe it.
I don't mean to pick on our poor
film industry. With so many conser
vative politicians blasting it (no pun
intended) for graphic displays of vi
olence, the last thing it needs is a
smart-mouthed columnist com
plaining that the violence isn't real
istic enough. But in the end, we ap
preciate movies for their realism as
much as anything else. Your aver
age summer blockbuster could only
be improved by treating gun vio
lence with a little more accuracy.
Firearms are exciting, and dan
gerous, and horrifying enough in
real life. There's no need for film
makers to perpetuate gun misper
ceptions in an effort to ratchet up
these qualities. Just tell it like it is,
boys. That's enough for me.

etly inside. And no, a lead-cored
bullet will not give you lead poison
ing if you leave it in. At worst, you
might set off some really sensitive
airport metal detectors.
Second, "the benign shoulder
shot." It's an article of faith in Holly
wood that when a character gets
shot in the shoulder, that's code for
"They winged him, but he'll be OK."
Filmmakers have an absolute love
affair the shoulder as the preferred
spot for not-too-serious gunshot in
juries. For example, in another
Schwarzenegger flick, "Eraser," our
friend Arnold gets shot clean
through the shoulder, but can still
use that arm to support his entire
body weight during a fistfight atop a
crane.
The truth about shoulder
wounds isn't so pretty. Not only will
a bullet through the shoulder land
you in the hospital fora long time,
there's a really good chance that
you'll be crippled for life. All the
nerves for your arm run right un
derneath the shoulder joint, and a
bullet is likely to slice clean through
them. After getting shot in the
shoulder, you'd be lucky if you can
ever again raise the affected arm
above your head, let alone perform
death-defy ing stunts with it.
To all the future filmmakers
reading this: For non-serious gun
shot wounds, feel free to use the
forearm. Or the lower leg. Even the
abdomen is probably OK, with
today's modern antibiotics to ward
off infection. But for the love of God,
don't keep shooting your characters
in the one place, other than the
spine, that's most likely to cause per

manent paralysis.
Third, "Blow the guy through
the plate glass window." This one is
also know as "blow the guy off the
side of the building," and "blow the
guy into the swimming pool, where
his blood stains the water red." Film
makers have this peculiar notion
that bullets can lift people off their
feet and fling them backwards sever
al yards, like tornado-force winds.
In real-life, on the other hand, it's
hard to even knock a good-sized
man down with anything less than a
high-caliber machine gun. Certainly
a handgun or rifle wouldn't do the
trick.
The ironic thing is, after seeing so
many violent movies, most real-life
gunshot victims are genuinely sur
prised when the bullet fails to fling
them backwards. In fact, due to the
surprising lack of force, it usually
takes them a few seconds to even re
alize that they've been shot. Such is
the power of Hollywood: When
filmmakers tell us that bullets send
people tumbling backwards, we ac
tually believe it.
I don't mean to pick on our poor
film industry. With so many conser
vative politicians blasting it (no pun
intended) for graphic displays of vi
olence, the last thing it needs is a
smart-mouthed columnist com
plaining that the violence isn't real
istic enough. But in the end, we ap
preciate movies for their realism as
much as anything else. Your aver
age summer blockbuster could only
be improved by treating gun vio
lence with a little more accuracy.
Firearms are exciting, and dan
gerous, and horrifying enough in
real life. There's no need for film
makers to perpetuate gun misper
ceptions in an effort to ratchet up
these qualities. Just tell it like it is,
boys. That's enough for me.

By now we're well into the
summer movie season,
when the studios annually
trot out their high-octane,
slam-bang thrillers. As I write this,
Ben Affleck is busy traipsing around
Russia, trying to stop nuclear war in
"The Sum of All Fears." Natalie
Portman is baring her midriff and
saving a whole galaxy in "Star Wars:
Episode II," while Toby Maguire is
mixing awesome superpowers with
teenage angst in "Spider-man."
We're all set for an entire summer

filled with car chas
es, explosions, elab
orate martial arts se
quences and, of
course, guns. Lots
and lots of guns.
Summer movies fea
ture more guns than
an entire National
Rifle Association

convention. And while there's noth
ing wrong with this per se, Holly
wood really needs to get its act to
gether when it comes to accurate
portrayals of gun violence. Film
makers apparently have no idea
what kind of damage a bullet actual
ly does to the human body, and their
ignorance shows.
Movies are chock-full of gun
gaffes, firearm follies and ballistics
bloopers. Look for these common
mistakes, coming to a theater near
you:
First, "Get the bullet out!" This is
my all-time favorite. A good guy gets
shot, and they rush him to the hos
pital, where surgeons frantically at
tempt to remove the bullet from his
body. There's a scene in "Ronin"
where Robert de Niro is so obsessed
with fishing a bullet out of his side
that he pays a shady underground
doctor to poke around in his chest
cavity for it, sans anesthesia. Even
more absurdly, in "Terminator 2"
Linda Hamilton spends several min
utes pulling bullets out of Arnold
Schwarzenegger, who is — ahem —
a robot.

1 have yet to understand why
movie characters are so anxious to
pull bullets out of people. Nine
times out of 10, real-life doctors
don't bother. After all, a bullet does
its damage by making big holes in
people's bodies. It doesn't make
sense to cut more holes in the poor
gunshot victim, just to extract a lit
tle piece of metal that's sitting qui
etly inside. And no, a lead-cored
bullet will not give you lead poison
ing if you leave it in. At worst, you
might set off some really sensitive
airport metal detectors.
