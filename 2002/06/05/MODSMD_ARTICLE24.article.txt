# Finding space for cars is no walk in the park
## 
### MAISY SAMUELSON 
On a campus the size of a small
town, students, faculty and staff
are wondering why they have
problems finding a parking spot.
Parking is particularly difficult
in the center of campus during the
day and at facilities such as the
Stanford Medical School. Senior
Jason Miller frequently transports
heavy equipment between two re
search labs.
"Because both labs lack ade
quate parking, people take the 20-
minute spots and stay there for
the whole day, hoping not to get
caught. If you absolutely need to
drive, and there isn't a legal spot
available, there is no choice but to
park illegally," said Miller, who
has amassed over $500 in parking
tickets during his five years at
Stanford.
"Ill don't get a place in my res
idential area then I have to risk it,"
said freshman Trevor Lovett, who
petitioned fora permit because he
has an off-campus job.
Usually this risk turns into a
parking ticket. In one year,
Lovett has already paid over $200
in tickets.
"It is ridiculous that they make
you buy permits and then don't
have enough parking. They are
basically forcing you to break the
law. There is no other choice,"
Lovett said.
Parking at residences is usually
a lesser problem than parking
near the center of campus. This
applies especially to dormitories
where a lot of freshmen, who are
not allowed to have cars, live. At
Roble, senior Brooke Brody-
Waite says she can almost always
find a legal spot if she is persistent
enough.
Row houses and the Sterling
Quad pose more of a problem. Ju
nior Larisa Speetzen, who lived in
Sterling Quad last year, remem
bered students coming home late
at night and having to park in re
mote spots.
"It isn't safe to be walking back
at night — especially for women,"
she said.
Part of the reason for Stanford's
increasing parking shortage in
central areas is its overall develop
ment scheme. In the past 25 years,
the University has built more than
60 new buildings and major struc
tures on campus. These buildings
have been erected on a central
core of 1,816 acres out of Stan
ford's 8,180 total acres. Frequently
the new buildings have been con
structed right on top of existing

parking. The trend towards cen
tral development moves parking
further and further away from the
core campus.
Most students get frustrated
with the University when the lack
of parking causes petty annoy
ances. However, Stanford park
ing is limited by stringent restric
tions from Santa Clara County.
Stanford, like other landowners,
must follow regulations adopted
by municipal, county and state
governments. ,
Under the current General Use
Permit, the University is allowed
no new net traffic flow over the
next 10 years. The county will
measure traffic flow by counting
the number of cars going in and
out of campus during peak times
fora six-week period each year.
This measurement will then be
compared to previous years. If
traffic is shown to have significant
ly increased for two consecutive
years, then Stanford will be re
sponsible for costly intersection
improvements.
While the GUP contains these
stringent traffic restrictions, it does
allow Stanford to develop 3,000
new housing units and 2 million
square feet of academic space in
the next 10 years. Although these
two forces — development and
traffic restrictions — seem contra
dictory, the purpose of restricting
parking is to offset the negative im
pacts of development for the sur
rounding community, according
to Community Relations Director
Andy Coe.
As a corollary to its "no in
creased net flow of traffic" restric
tion, the GUP also puts a cap on
the number of parking spaces
Stanford can add. The GUP allows
for the construction of only "2,300
net new parking spaces above the
campus base of 19,351." About 60
percent of the new parking spaces
will be designated for new student
housing and the rest will be placed
strategically around busy spots in
an attempt to alleviate parking
pressure in the middle of campus.
The University's Transporta
tion Demand Management team
also plans to re-structure parking
in the center of campus, adding
loading zones and short-term
parking to maximize access to
parking spaces.
Another option that could re
lieve parking pressure in the cam
pus core is to build satellite park
ing and shuttle people in. The
"cordon line" is approximately the
area contained by the north side of
Campus Drive, Junipero Serra
and Stanford Avenue. Any park
ing outside of this line would not
count towards the limited number
of spaces Stanford is allowed.
However, parking outside the cor
don line would still not reduce the
number of trips in and out of cam
pus that matter in determining
traffic flow. Moreover, satellite
parking is generally expensive and
less convenient.
As a cheaper and more effective
long-term solution, the team is
working to provide alternative
forms of transportation. Greg Cile
ichman, manager of parking and
transportation demand manage
ment for Parking & Transporta
tion Services, said, "We are work
ing towards a balanced program
that includes improving parking
and providing good alternatives to
driving a single-occupancy vehi
cle."
Such new program ideas in
clude a universal transit pass that
would allow Stanford affiliates (fac
ulty, staff and commuting stu
dents) to use public transporta
tion, including Call rain, for free.
The University already has a Clean
Air Cash Rewards Program that
pays Stanford affiliates up to $160
a year not to drive to work.
The transportation team also
plans to improve the Marguerite
by increasing the frequency of its

shuttles and expanding its off
campus service. As a further disin
centive for drivers, Stanford is one
of the few institutions in the area to
charge parking fees.
The University's most contro
versial step towards alleviating the
parking crunch has been to pro
hibit freshmen from having cars
on campus, starting in 2000.
According to the Parking and
Transportation Services Web site,
the restrictions have been applied
to freshmen because they are least
likely to be impacted by the policy:
"Freshmen are required to live in
residence halls with board plans,
and any freshman who needs a job
may obtain one on campus. Fresh
men are also supported by a wide
array of special social activities in
their residence halls and elsewhere
on campus," reads the web site
Brody-Waite believes this policy
is unfair to freshmen. She remem
bers how important having cars
was for her freshman class.
"When I was a freshman, every
body depended on people with
cars for emergency situations,
dorm trips, late-night Jack in the
Box runs and going to the
movies," she said.
Many other freshmen agree
that not having a car makes the
campus seem more isolated and
limits social options to on-campus
parties that usually include loud
music and alcohol. Freshman
Gabe Turow feels that not having
cars makes dating more difficult.
"What are you going to do, in
vite someone fora ride on the Mar
guerite? You take the Marguerite

into Palo Alto for dinner, and then
what are you supposed to do take
the Call rain to the movies? With
out a car, it is harder to get off cam
pus," Turow said.
From the community's per
spective, Stanford's efforts to cut
back on traffic have been over
whelmingly successful. The Stan
ford Report quotes Kathleen
Much of Menlo Park praising the
University's efforts to reduce traf
fic.
"[Stanford 1 has done a lot better
job than anyone else in the county.
It's sort of silly for us to be advising
them. It ought to be the other way
around," Much said.
Joe Kott, head of Palo Alto's
transportation division, expressed
a similar view in the Report: "If all
employers did what Stanford's
done the [overall] statistics would
be much less grim."
According to 1990 U.S. Census
data, 45 percent of Stanford's fac
ulty and staff commute to work by
means other than a single occu
pancy vehicle, compared to the
Santa Clara County-wide average
of 22 percent.
Miller feels that students are
frustrated by the parking situation
because they are not aware of
Santa Clara County's restrictions.
"There is a fundamental mis
communication between the ad
ministration and the student
body," Miller said. "Most students
do not understand that the park
ing policy ties into a larger Univer
sity policy. The administration
doesn't have absolute say — Santa
Clara County does."
