# Finding space for cars is no walk in the park

### MAISY SAMUELSON 
On a campus the size of a small
town, students, faculty and staff
are wondering why they have
problems finding a parking spot.
Parking is particularly difficult
in the center of campus during the
day and at facilities such as the
Stanford Medical School. Senior
Jason Miller frequently transports
heavy equipment between two re
search labs.
"Because both labs lack ade
quate parking, people take the 20-
minute spots and stay there for
the whole day, hoping not to get
caught. If you absolutely need to
drive, and there isn't a legal spot
available, there is no choice but to
park illegally," said Miller, who
has amassed over $500 in parking
tickets during his five years at
Stanford.
"Ill don't get a place in my res
idential area then I have to risk it,"
said freshman Trevor Lovett, who
petitioned fora permit because he
has an off-campus job.
Usually this risk turns into a
parking ticket. In one year,
Lovett has already paid over $200
in tickets.
"It is ridiculous that they make
you buy permits and then don't
have enough parking. They are
basically forcing you to break the
law. There is no other choice,"
Lovett said.
Parking at residences is usually
a lesser problem than parking
near the center of campus. This
applies especially to dormitories
where a lot of freshmen, who are
not allowed to have cars, live. At
Roble, senior Brooke Brody-
Waite says she can almost always
find a legal spot if she is persistent
enough.
Row houses and the Sterling
Quad pose more of a problem. Ju
nior Larisa Speetzen, who lived in
Sterling Quad last year, remem
bered students coming home late
at night and having to park in re
mote spots.
"It isn't safe to be walking back
at night — especially for women,"
she said.
Part of the reason for Stanford's
increasing parking shortage in
central areas is its overall develop
ment scheme. In the past 25 years,
the University has built more than
60 new buildings and major struc
tures on campus. These buildings
have been erected on a central
core of 1,816 acres out of Stan
ford's 8,180 total acres. Frequently
the new buildings have been con
structed right on top of existing

parking. The trend towards cen
tral development moves parking
further and further away from the
core campus.
Most students get frustrated
with the University when the lack
of parking causes petty annoy
ances. However, Stanford park
ing is limited by stringent restric
tions from Santa Clara County.
Stanford, like other landowners,
must follow regulations adopted
by municipal, county and state
governments. ,
Under the current General Use
Permit, the University is allowed
no new net traffic flow over the
next 10 years. The county will
measure traffic flow by counting
the number of cars going in and
out of campus during peak times
fora six-week period each year.
This measurement will then be
compared to previous years. If
traffic is shown to have significant
ly increased for two consecutive
years, then Stanford will be re
sponsible for costly intersection
improvements.
While the GUP contains these
stringent traffic restrictions, it does
allow Stanford to develop 3,000
new housing units and 2 million
square feet of academic space in
the next 10 years. Although these
two forces — development and
traffic restrictions — seem contra
dictory, the purpose of restricting
parking is to offset the negative im
pacts of development for the sur
rounding community, according
to Community Relations Director
Andy Coe.
As a corollary to its "no in
creased net flow of traffic" restric
tion, the GUP also puts a cap on
the number of parking spaces
Stanford can add. The GUP allows
for the construction of only "2,300
net new parking spaces above the
campus base of 19,351." About 60
percent of the new parking spaces
will be designated for new student
housing and the rest will be placed
strategically around busy spots in
an attempt to alleviate parking
pressure in the middle of campus.
The University's Transporta
tion Demand Management team
also plans to re-structure parking
in the center of campus, adding
loading zones and short-term
parking to maximize access to
parking spaces.
Another option that could re
lieve parking pressure in the cam
pus core is to build satellite park
ing and shuttle people in. The
"cordon line" is approximately the
