### BRENDAN MARTEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A conference at the Stanford Humanities
Center on May 24 focused on gender, global
ization and attacks on feminist theory and
perspectives in the context of Sept. 11.
The conference coordinator Patricia Pen
der, a graduate student in English, explained
that the concept for the event arose from a
concern about the lack of objective analysis of
issues concerning Sept. 11.
Pender said that students were worried
about the lack of discussion about the signifi
cance of the event.
"Discussion was discouraged as an un-
American activity," she said. "We wanted to
open a space, particularly at Stanford, in
order to be able to bring out these issues into
the open and discuss them."
Pender said that dialogues during the day
long event dealt with "issues like citizenship
and the media and the role that the media is
playing in the mobilization toward war and
the continuation of the war on terror."
She stressed the importance of "bringing

analytical skills to bear on one of the most
urgent political and international issues of
the day."
The conference was organized by the Fem
inist Theory Workshop, a relatively new
group at Stanford that attempts to deal with
current issues.
"[The workshop] started this year," Pen
der said. "The idea was to create a space
where we were able to discuss issues of cut
ting-edge feminist research. It seemed liked
new transnational feminist perspectives such
as those on Sept. 11 were as current as you
could get."
Pender discussed how guest lecturers were
chosen for the different components of the
conference.
"We had read their works through out the
year in the workshop," Pender said. "We
thought they were some of the most exciting
writers on globalization at the moment and
found that many were in the Bay Area, so we
felt it was an ideal opportunity to bring them
to Stanford."
Assoc. English Prof. Paula Moya was one of
the conference speakers.

"I enjoyed it, I thought it was a very suc
cessful conference," Moya said. "It was im
pressive in that it had participants from across
California. There were audience members
that came from all those different campuses.
That is good, that is very impressive fora con
ference for this sort."
Pender mentioned that she noticed some
things she hadn't anticipated while watching
the conference's different presentations.
"It was interesting how a lot involved visu
al representations," she said. "In order to talk
about incredibly complex political phenome
non, a lot of people turned to pictures from
newspapers and cartoons from magazines.
This means dealing with Sept. 11 means deal
ing with the representational fallout that has
been in (he media."
Pender said she thought the event overall
was very rewarding for all involved.
"People from all different departments
came up during the day and said how they
were so glad something like this was happen
ing at Stanford," Pender said. "It was very ex
citing to create an event at Stanford that cre
ated that kind of energy."
