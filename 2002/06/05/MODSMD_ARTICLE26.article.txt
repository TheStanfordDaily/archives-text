# Scholars search Patagonian rock for oil clues
## Alumni and students join to create computer models for oil-exploration projects 
### MICHELLE KELLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Earlier this spring, 9,000 miles away in the
windy Patagonian terrain, a group of Stanford
students spent three weeks collecting data 011
rock systems. The students are using their find
ings from the research and other projects that
have been conducted in Patagonia to create
three-dimensional computer models that can
be applied to oil-exploration projects in the
deep-sea terrains off the coast of West Africa.
The Patagonia investigation is part of a
greater collaboration of projects managed by
the Stanford Project on Deep-Water Deposi
tional Systems, funded by 15 oil companies.
The group was composed of two alumni,
one undergraduate student and seven gradu
ate students, including Will Crane, a doctoral
candidate in geology, who led the research
that will form part of his dissertation.
"The research was motivated by a couple
of factors," Crane said. "This area had not re
ally been researched before. The last work
done in [there] was in the late 1970s and 80s.

When my advisor [Stephan Graham] went to
do some early research in the area, he con
cluded that there vyas room to do a more de
tailed study in this region."
The research is being conducted in Patag
onia, where tectonic plates have pushed the
sediment above ground and it can be more
easily studied.
"It may not seem immediately obvious
since there's a world of difference, at least in
geography and distance, between West Af rica
and the far-south tip of South America," said
Geological and Environmental Sciences Prof.
Graham. "But in terms of the processes by
which sediment is laid down, there are pretty
great similarities."
Oil exploration in deep-sea terrain is often
difficult and the current tools available such
as sensing tools and the occasional drilling
hole do not provide sufficient data needed to
begin an oil-drilling project. The project cur
rently has many research sites around the
world in areas like California, Arkansas, Peru
and Romania that are working on studying
and modeling sedimentary systems in the
deep-sea terrains that will be used by the pe
troleum companies in future ventures.
Students spent their days on the field col
lecting data which will then be transcribed
into a digital format for later processing.
"We generally worked in teams of two or

three," said senior Tzvetina Erohina, the only
undergraduate on the trip. "We measured
the thickness of stratographic sections, grain
sizes and did other depositional measure
ments. We would hike to the area and spend
the entire day working in the field."
Although the students agreed that it was an
extraordinary experience, they also said that
working in Patagonia was a challenge. The Tor
res del Paine National Park, where the group
did all of its work, is located on the southern
most tip of Chile and is subject to very unpre
dictable weather and violent winds. Although
the group was well advised to expect the volatile
conditions, there were still a few surprises.
"I remember one time when we were in the
field and I was standing next to some of my
partners who were not facing me," Erohina
said. "A huge gust of wind suddenly picked
me up and carried me five meters away in an
instant. When my partners turned around,
they gasped at how far the wind had carried
me and instantly asked if 1 was OK."
For Crane, doing geology field research in
Chile this March was not a first.
"I had done a few trips before this last
one," he said. "[1 did] a reconnaissance trip
and another trip with a smaller group last
year."
This was the first year that
Crane led a larger group of stu
dents, and while he admits that
the organization of a larger
group was more difficult, he said
that the amount of data they were
able to collect was at least eight to
nine times as much as the pre
ceding trips.
"We covered a lot more
ground with a larger group. By
the end of the trip we had 10 to

11 field notebooks that I now
have to transcribe. I plan to start
(lie digital modeling in the fall,"
Crane said.
While Crane plans to finish his
dissertation this year, for stu
dents like Erohina, this trip was
only a beginning. Originally
planning to major in earth sys
tems, Erohina switched her focus
to geology and plans to start
graduate work next year with her
advisor, Geology Prof. James
Ingle. She says she plans to re
turn to Patagonia sometime next
winter or spring to start on her
own research project.
