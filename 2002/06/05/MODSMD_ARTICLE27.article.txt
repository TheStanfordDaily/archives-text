### BRENDAN MARTEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I he campaign team seeking to elect Steve
Westly as California State Controller held a vol
unteer-recruitment meeting at its headquarters
last night.
Westly, a Stanford graduate (BA, MBA) is run
ning as the Democratic Party nominee in the race.
The recruitment meeting was targeted toward
Bay Area college students who have an interest in
getting involved with politics. Student volunteers
at Wesdy's Redwood City headquarters will work
this summer.
Volunteer Coordinator Erika Soto, a senior, said
that about a dozen students showed up at the meet
ing. Of those, 75 percent were Stanford students.
According to Soto, many students who were inter
ested in politics and most were upperclassmen.
Soto mentioned that upperclassmen are more
frequently interested in this sort of summer work,
' since they are less likely to return home while
school is out.
Freshman Tom Hanada agreed with Soto's ob
servation.
"I'd think volunteering would be a great expe
rience; if seems like it would really make you feel
like you are making a difference in the world,"
Hanada said. "But I would personally wait until
later in school to start doing that."
Soto discussed what the attending students
learned during the meeting, which the office enti
tled "Campaign 101."
"The goal was to introduce prospective volun
teers to the campaign and the candidate and [to
offer them] a basic understanding of what cam
paigning means," Soto said.

At the meeting, the campaign manager, Greg
Larson, discussed campaign goals and California
politics. The field director and fund-raising direc
tor spoke about various aspects of the campaign,
such as how to encourage voter involvement and
raise funds.
The actual responsibilities of a young volunteer
can vary quite a bit, according to Soto.
"There are a handful of activities that they can
participate in," she said, "[like] coming in on a reg
ular basis and helping with everyday critical tasks
or working on research projects. Filings seem to
come up all the time for volunteers to do."
Soto explained that young people such as col
lege students are a critical component of political
campaigns.
"The campaign believes that high school and
college students are essential to the making every
thing work, and we have had a lot of Stanford stu
dent involvement," Soto said. "In a campaign, you
need to get out there in the field and be exciting.
College students have always been part of the cam
paign aspect of work; campaigns and young peo
ple are almost a perfect fit."
Soto recalled how fellow party activists have pre
viously been impressed by the energy of young vol
unteers involved in political campaigning.
"We went to the California convention in March
and [the students] shocked everyone by their par
ticipation," Soto said. "A lot of the attendees were
blown away by the support and excitement that the
young volunteers showed. These are the grass
roots activists of the party."
Soto commented that the participation of young
people in political campaigns can be very inspiring.
"It is really motivating to see their support,"
Soto said.
