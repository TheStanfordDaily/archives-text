# Blood Center implements new regulations

### SARAH LUSTBADER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
New guidelines issued by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration to tighten restrictions on blood dona
tion in the United States were implemented at the
Stanford Blood Center last Friday. The restrictions
are part of an effort to prevent Variant Creutzfeldt-
Jakob disease, the human form of "Mad Cow Dis
ease," from entering the U.S. blood supply.
According to the center's Web site, the following in
dividuals are, since last Friday, ineligible to donate
blood: "Individuals who spent a total of three months
or more in the United Kingdom between 1980 and
1996; individuals who were in the U.S. military, or
civilian military and were stationed in certain Euro
pean countries for six months or more between 1980
and 1996; individuals who lived in France for five
years or more since 1980" and "individuals who re

ceived a blood transfusion in the United Kingdom
since 1980."
Additional regulations will be put into practice be
ginning Oct. 28. As of that date, those who have spent
at least five years in "some other European countries"
since 1980 will also become ineligible. These dates are,
however, specific to the Stanford Blood Center and
may vary at other centers.
Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, also known as
vCJD, is one of six progressive degenerative neuro
logical diseases known as transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies that affect humans. The disease
may have been introduced to humans through conta
minated food products.
"The FDA has implemented these new restrictions
to protect the [U.S.] blood supply from a theoretical
risk," said Michele Gassaway, community and media
relat ions coordinator of the center.
"So far, there is no evidence that vC-JI) can be trans

mitted through transfusions. The restrictions are
stringent but patient safety comes first."
By implementing the new restrictions in two phas
es, the FDA hopes to prevent a sudden loss of blood
donations.
"We expect to lose about four percent of our cur
rent donors, which comes out to approximately 1,600
people," Gassaway said.
This loss, coupled with an increased demand for
blood due to new cancer and heart-disease treatment
programs, is causing blood centers to seek new
donors.
"If not carefully prepared for, the sudden loss of
donors could have a devastating impact on the blood
supply," Gassaway said. "With hospital usage rising
and our donor base shrinking, it is imperative that
more people start donating blood."
The center has created a Travel
er's Club, hoping to encourage de
ferred donors to remain involved
by recruiting new donors.
According to the center's Web
site, Doreen Leith, mobile recruit

ment supervisor said, "People in
the Bay Area travel a lot and many
companies have additional offices
in Europe."
The center encourages those
who suspect they will be deferred
to discuss their specific situation
with a representative.
A non-profit community orga
nization, the Stanford Blood Cen
ter supplies more than 35,000 pints

of blood and blood components a
year to five hospitals, helping an es
timated 105,000 patients. It collects
160 pints of blood each day to meet
the need of area patients.
Each donation can save up to
three lives.
"Many patients can't survive
without blood transfusions," Gas
saway said. "Donors are literally
giving someone the gift of life."
