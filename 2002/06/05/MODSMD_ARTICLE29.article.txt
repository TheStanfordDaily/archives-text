### ALBERT LEUNG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Friday and Saturday evening, the Lesbian, Gay,
Bisexual and Transgender Community Resource Cen
ter sponsored the Queer Theatre's rendition of Oscar
Wilde's play, "An Ideal Husband," in the courtyard of
La Maison Francaise. This late-19th-century play focus
es on a reputable marriage threatened by scandal in
England's aristocratic society.
" This project is the first in a new Queer Theatre ini
tiative designed to explore the works of queer play
wrights and queer characters in the canon," said sopho
more Ed Iskandar, the director of the play. "Although
outwardly a depiction of a hetero-normative marriage
in a normal home, Wilde has created a highly elabora
tive metaphor for the closet and the secrets that are hid
den within."
Queer Theatre is a newly established independent
student organization that plans to produce three to four
shows a year for the Stanford community.
Wilde is known as a gay playwright, and this work is
thought to possess sexual overtones in the plot and
character development.
"There are a lot of messages and images that flow
throughout the play. Our goal for [Queer] Theatre is to
present the Stanford community with diverse issues that
face gay people," said sophomore Brooke Fineberg, the
producer. "We selected this play by Wilde because he's
an incredibly talented playwright, and he really chal
lenged gender issues that were way ahead of his time.
Wilde brought a sense of modernity to these issues with
his subtle metaphors."
The event attracted a diverse group of people t hat in
cluded students, faculty and parents among the audi
ence. Admission was free.
"T his play was targeted for everybody, and we tried
to make it as accessible as possible to the Stanford com
munity," said Fineberg.
"Even though the stage consisted chiefly of a couple
chairs and a desk, the director and cast managed to
bring British high society to life; 1 was really intrigued
by Lord Coring's character because he faced many in
ternal struggles throughout the play's development,"
said freshman Yining Ni.
The play featured performances with Page as Lord
Arthur Goring, sophomore Lief Haniford as Lord
Robert Chiltern, Benson as Lady Gertrude Chiltern, ju
nior Kendra Arimoto as Miss Mabel Chiltern, Jessica
Joffe as Mrs. Laura Chevely, AJ Magnuson as Lord
Caversham and Maya Powch as Lady Marby.
The theater has begun to make plans for future
performances.
V'ln February 2003, we will perform a jazz musical
called Lulu that explores the relationship between a cour
tesan with an upper-class lover. It will be co-produced by
the Bent Spoon Dance Company," Fineberg said.
