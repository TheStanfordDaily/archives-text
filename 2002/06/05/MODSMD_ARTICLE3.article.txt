## Stanford at the Oscars 
### IRENE NOGUCHI STAFF WRITER 
Stanford has 23 Nobel laureates
and seven straight Sears Cups. Hut
in the basement of the Communi
cation Department, students have
quietly been building another Stan
ford legacy — 17 student Academy
Awards in documentary film and
video since 1984.
Communication master's stu
dent Thomas Burns won the 17th
Oscar in May, when he snagged
one of nine prizes awarded by the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences for student documen
tary films. His film, "Revolutions
Per Minute," placed in the top
three. Burns will find out if he won
gold, silver or bronze (and the ac
companying $5,000, $3,000 or
$2,000 prize) at the 29th annual
ceremony on J line 9 at the Samuel
Coldwyn Theater in Los Angeles.
"It is the highest award you can

get as a documentary student," said
Kristine Samuelson, chair of the
Communication Department.
Alumni Porter Gale and Laleh
Soomekh, Class of '01, captured
gold last year for "XXXY," a docu
mentary on hermaphrodites.
Burns called "Revolutions Per
Minute" a "love letter" to the gold
en age of vinyl records, before they
were edged out by compact discs.
He interviewed two record lovers in
the film: John Goddard, a bearded
record-store owner, and Jack
Brown, the elderly manager of a
record-pressing plant.
"The golden business of
"Grease" and ["Saturday Night
Live"] fever was over," Goddard
said in the film. Rows of records
surround him in his store, Village
Music, in Mill Valley. "The record
business was in the toilet by the
late '80s."
The film is seven minutes long,
but Burns manages to squeeze in

interviews alongside images of CDs
and records being manufactured.
Robot arms press compact discs
into place. In the record plant,
workers stand beside flowing tanks,
the black liquid blooming into per
fect circles beneath the pr esses.

Communication master's student Thomas Burns is the 17th Stanford student
ever to win a student Academy Award in documentary film and video. Burns
said his film is a "love letter" to the golden age of vinyl records.
the film. "Vinyl is an extension of all
of those human sounds, all of those
human feelings, all of those human
hesitations."
"Revolutions" was Burns's third
project in the documentary film
program. He chose records as a
topic because he loves the sound
and because lie grew up in Austin,
Texas, where vinyl was a "culture,"
he admits.
"There's something really excit
ing about playing on a vinyl record,"
Burns said. "Part of it is how it
sounds, and part is putting the
record on and having to drop the
needle. It's more of a spiritual expe
rience than just pressing 'play.'"
Burns shot the entire movie on
16-millimeter film. It's superior to
digital video, he said, just as records
surpass CDs.
"All four of the projects that he
produced in the program pay
homage to days gone by," said
Communication Prof. Jan Krawitz,
the director of the program in doc
umentary film and video.
Burns admitted to having a
"neurosis of nostalgia." After earn
ing a bachelor's in history at Reed
College, lie used his fluent Russian
to work fora magazine in the Cau
casus Mountains in the U.S.S.R.
That led to photojournalism, which
led to video work, which led to what
he has now: a ticket to the Academy

Awards this Sunday.
The four films required of Stan
ford's program are the first he has
made. His current thesis — Soviet
jazz during the Cold War — will be
the longest at 20 minutes. "But un
like other film schools," Burns said,
"you get to be the director of your
own film."
His documentary career got its
kick-start at the Cow Palace, a rodeo
fairground in San Francisco. Burns
was shooting his first film on Amer
ican bullfighters, "the real heroes of
the rodeo," he said.
"This world-class bucking bull
had tossed this cowboy in three sec
onds," Burns said. 'The bull was
lowering his head and just about to
kill this guy, and out of nowhere the
subject of my film jumps in between
the cowboy and the bull and dis
tracts the bull away."
The "subject" of his film was a
world-class master of bullfighting,
who diverts the bull's attention to
keep the cowboy safe. But it's those
subjects that Burns loves, that keep
him scouring the radio and news
papers for something that fasci
nates him, he said.
Documentary filmmakers al
ways keep up their "antennae of cu
riosity," said Eriko Yamato, a sec
ond-year film student. She and
Burns partnered on "Train" last
year, a film about train engineers
and the deaths they inevitably wit
ness on the tracks.
"Thomas is a very, very good
cinematographer," Yamato said.
"If we shot the same thing, I could

never show it the way he does."
Students often team up, work
ing as each other's crew. The pro
gram is two years long — in the first
year students make three short
films and in the second year they
write a thesis.
"Because the pace here is so
fast, you really do have to with
draw into the little cave of your edit
room and work pretty feverishly
for weeks," said John Neely, a sec
ond-year student.
Burns is a filmmaker who "shuts
the rest of the world out to maintain
his focus," Neely said.
Hie students spend hours upon
hours in the editing rooms. Yamato
even admits to keeping a sleeping
bag there.
"It's a creative campout that's
happening in the sub-basement of
our communication department,"
said Samuelson, laughing.
But teamwork might attest to
their success, she said. "Really won
derful films are not made in isola
tion," Samuelson said. "There may
be a primary visionary bringing the
work to completion, but [he] needs
a lot of help along the way."
"Documentaries are about com
municating with people," Yamato
said. The more intimate the story,
she said, the better the film.
The plant manager, Brown,
echoes that in the film. Framed by a
wall of shiny records, he says,
"There's a strange thing about
human communication — that's
the essence of whatever it is that re
mains in the ear of the listener."

ican bullfighters, "the real heroes of
the rodeo," he said.
"This world-class bucking bull
had tossed this cowboy in three sec
onds," Burns said. 'The bull was
lowering his head and just about to
kill this guy, and out of nowhere the
subject of my film jumps in between
the cowboy and the bull and dis
tracts the bull away."
The "subject" of his film was a
world-class master of bullfighting,
who diverts the bull's attention to
keep the cowboy safe. But it's those
subjects that Burns loves, that keep
him scouring the radio and news
papers for something that fasci
nates him, he said.
Documentary filmmakers al
ways keep up their "antennae of cu
riosity," said Eriko Yamato, a sec
ond-year film student. She and
Burns partnered on "Train" last
year, a film about train engineers
and the deaths they inevitably wit
ness on the tracks.
"Thomas is a very, very good
cinematographer," Yamato said.
"If we shot the same thing, I could

never show it the way he does."
Students often team up, work
ing as each other's crew. The pro
gram is two years long — in the first
year students make three short
films and in the second year they
write a thesis.
"Because the pace here is so
fast, you really do have to with
draw into the little cave of your edit
room and work pretty feverishly
for weeks," said John Neely, a sec
ond-year student.
Burns is a filmmaker who "shuts
the rest of the world out to maintain
his focus," Neely said.
Hie students spend hours upon
hours in the editing rooms. Yamato
even admits to keeping a sleeping
bag there.
"It's a creative campout that's
happening in the sub-basement of
our communication department,"
said Samuelson, laughing.
But teamwork might attest to
their success, she said. "Really won
derful films are not made in isola
tion," Samuelson said. "There may
be a primary visionary bringing the
work to completion, but [he] needs
a lot of help along the way."
"Documentaries are about com
municating with people," Yamato
said. The more intimate the story,
she said, the better the film.
The plant manager, Brown,
echoes that in the film. Framed by a
wall of shiny records, he says,
"There's a strange thing about
human communication — that's
the essence of whatever it is that re
mains in the ear of the listener."

in the basement of the Communi

quietly been building another Stan
ford legacy — 17 student Academy
Awards in documentary film and
video since 1984.
Communication master's stu
dent Thomas Burns won the 17th
Oscar in May, when he snagged
one of nine prizes awarded by the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences for student documen
tary films. His film, "Revolutions
Per Minute," placed in the top
three. Burns will find out if he won
gold, silver or bronze (and the ac
companying $5,000, $3,000 or
$2,000 prize) at the 29th annual
ceremony on J line 9 at the Samuel
Coldwyn Theater in Los Angeles.
"It is the highest award you can

get as a documentary student," said
Kristine Samuelson, chair of the
Communication Department.

gold last year for "XXXY," a docu

Burns called "Revolutions Per
Minute" a "love letter" to the gold
en age of vinyl records, before they
were edged out by compact discs.
He interviewed two record lovers in
the film: John Goddard, a bearded
record-store owner, and Jack
Brown, the elderly manager of a
record-pressing plant.
"The golden business of
"Grease" and ["Saturday Night
Live"] fever was over," Goddard
said in the film. Rows of records
surround him in his store, Village
Music, in Mill Valley. "The record
business was in the toilet by the
late '80s."
The film is seven minutes long,
but Burns manages to squeeze in

interviews alongside images of CDs
and records being manufactured.

Communication master's student Thomas Burns is the 17th Stanford student
ever to win a student Academy Award in documentary film and video. Burns
said his film is a "love letter" to the golden age of vinyl records.
the film. "Vinyl is an extension of all
of those human sounds, all of those
human feelings, all of those human
hesitations."
"Revolutions" was Burns's third
project in the documentary film
program. He chose records as a
topic because he loves the sound
and because lie grew up in Austin,
Texas, where vinyl was a "culture,"
he admits.
"There's something really excit
ing about playing on a vinyl record,"
Burns said. "Part of it is how it
sounds, and part is putting the
record on and having to drop the
needle. It's more of a spiritual expe
rience than just pressing 'play.'"
Burns shot the entire movie on
16-millimeter film. It's superior to
digital video, he said, just as records
surpass CDs.
"All four of the projects that he
produced in the program pay
homage to days gone by," said
Communication Prof. Jan Krawitz,
the director of the program in doc
umentary film and video.
Burns admitted to having a
"neurosis of nostalgia." After earn
ing a bachelor's in history at Reed
College, lie used his fluent Russian
to work fora magazine in the Cau
casus Mountains in the U.S.S.R.
That led to photojournalism, which
led to video work, which led to what
he has now: a ticket to the Academy

Awards this Sunday.
The four films required of Stan
ford's program are the first he has
made. His current thesis — Soviet
jazz during the Cold War — will be
the longest at 20 minutes. "But un
like other film schools," Burns said,
"you get to be the director of your
own film."
His documentary career got its
kick-start at the Cow Palace, a rodeo
fairground in San Francisco. Burns
was shooting his first film on Amer
ican bullfighters, "the real heroes of
the rodeo," he said.
"This world-class bucking bull
had tossed this cowboy in three sec
