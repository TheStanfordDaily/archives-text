## Stanford at the Oscars 
### IRENE NOGUCHI STAFF WRITER 
Stanford has 23 Nobel laureates
and seven straight Sears Cups. Hut
in the basement of the Communi
cation Department, students have
quietly been building another Stan
ford legacy — 17 student Academy
Awards in documentary film and
video since 1984.
Communication master's stu
dent Thomas Burns won the 17th
Oscar in May, when he snagged
one of nine prizes awarded by the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences for student documen
tary films. His film, "Revolutions
Per Minute," placed in the top
three. Burns will find out if he won
gold, silver or bronze (and the ac
companying $5,000, $3,000 or
$2,000 prize) at the 29th annual
ceremony on J line 9 at the Samuel
Coldwyn Theater in Los Angeles.
"It is the highest award you can

get as a documentary student," said
Kristine Samuelson, chair of the
Communication Department.
Alumni Porter Gale and Laleh
Soomekh, Class of '01, captured
gold last year for "XXXY," a docu
mentary on hermaphrodites.
Burns called "Revolutions Per
Minute" a "love letter" to the gold
en age of vinyl records, before they
were edged out by compact discs.
He interviewed two record lovers in
the film: John Goddard, a bearded
record-store owner, and Jack
Brown, the elderly manager of a
record-pressing plant.
"The golden business of
"Grease" and ["Saturday Night
Live"] fever was over," Goddard
said in the film. Rows of records
surround him in his store, Village
Music, in Mill Valley. "The record
business was in the toilet by the
late '80s."
The film is seven minutes long,
but Burns manages to squeeze in

interviews alongside images of CDs
and records being manufactured.
Robot arms press compact discs
into place. In the record plant,
workers stand beside flowing tanks,
the black liquid blooming into per
fect circles beneath the pr esses.

The first scene shows a needle —
when it touches the record, music
begins.
"You can almost hear ... the
breath of the singer," Brown said in
