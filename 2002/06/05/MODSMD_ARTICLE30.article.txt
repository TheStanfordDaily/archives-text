## Baseball sweeps to Super Regional 
### MAC LEVINE STAFF WRITER 
The toughest NCAA Regional
competition in the country? So
what? What else can you throw at
us? Bring on Southern California.
This past weekend at Sunken
Diamond, the No. 8 seeded Cardi
nal (43-16) advanced to the Super
Regionals to face rival and Pacific
10 Conference champion USC.
Stanford pulled off three straight
victories at home in the double
elimination regional.
As a result of a more regional
ized method of bracketing, the
Cardinal was placed in a four-team
bracket with three other top-25
teams from California — Long
Beach State (39-21), San Jose State
(45-17) and Cal State-Fuller ton
(37-22). These four teams made
up the nation's most difficult draw.
But, relying on its spectacular
starting pitching and flawless de
fense, the Cardinal was able to ad
vance in the minimum number of
games, maintaining a flair for the
dramatic that has been one of the
team's staples all year long.
On Sunday afternoon, the Car
dinal advanced with an 8-4 victory
over Long Beach State, beating

the Dirtbags for the second day in
a row. Sophomore hurler John
Hudgins threw a complete game
to move to 9-1 on the season.
Hudgins struck out six while
scattering 11 hits and four runs
over nine innings of work, throw
ing the team's second complete
game in three days.
Although the Cardinal got off
to a quick start as freshman desig
nated hitter Chris Carter hit a
leadoff home run — the second in
as many days for Stanford — the
Dirtbags didn't give up, as the
game entered the bottom of the
fifth with the score knotted, 2-2.
However, the Cardinal took
control in its half of the fifth inning.
Junior catcher Ryan Garko got the
five-run inning started with an
RBI double to score Sam Fuld.
The next batter, junior leftfield
er Jason Cooper, put the Cardinal
ahead for good with a two-run
blast, his 13th of the season, and the
team picked up two more un
earned runs in the inning to cush
ion the lead that ultimately put the
Cardinal one step closer to Omaha.
Before the team celebrated on
Sunday, though, it played two
