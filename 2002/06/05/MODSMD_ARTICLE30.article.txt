## Baseball sweeps to Super Regional 
### MAC LEVINE STAFF WRITER 
The toughest NCAA Regional
competition in the country? So
what? What else can you throw at
us? Bring on Southern California.
This past weekend at Sunken
Diamond, the No. 8 seeded Cardi
nal (43-16) advanced to the Super
Regionals to face rival and Pacific
10 Conference champion USC.
Stanford pulled off three straight
victories at home in the double
elimination regional.
As a result of a more regional
ized method of bracketing, the
Cardinal was placed in a four-team
bracket with three other top-25
teams from California — Long
Beach State (39-21), San Jose State
(45-17) and Cal State-Fuller ton
(37-22). These four teams made
up the nation's most difficult draw.
But, relying on its spectacular
starting pitching and flawless de
fense, the Cardinal was able to ad
vance in the minimum number of
games, maintaining a flair for the
dramatic that has been one of the
team's staples all year long.
On Sunday afternoon, the Car
dinal advanced with an 8-4 victory
over Long Beach State, beating

the Dirtbags for the second day in
a row. Sophomore hurler John
Hudgins threw a complete game
to move to 9-1 on the season.
Hudgins struck out six while
scattering 11 hits and four runs
over nine innings of work, throw
ing the team's second complete
game in three days.
Although the Cardinal got off
to a quick start as freshman desig
nated hitter Chris Carter hit a
leadoff home run — the second in
as many days for Stanford — the
Dirtbags didn't give up, as the
game entered the bottom of the
fifth with the score knotted, 2-2.
However, the Cardinal took
control in its half of the fifth inning.
Junior catcher Ryan Garko got the
five-run inning started with an
RBI double to score Sam Fuld.
The next batter, junior leftfield
er Jason Cooper, put the Cardinal
ahead for good with a two-run
blast, his 13th of the season, and the
team picked up two more un
earned runs in the inning to cush
ion the lead that ultimately put the
Cardinal one step closer to Omaha.
Before the team celebrated on
Sunday, though, it played two

Senior Andy Topham turns a double play against Cal State-Fullerton on Fri
day night at Sunken Diamond. Stanford won all three of its NCAA Regional
games over the weekend and will host USC this weekend in the Super Re
gional, with the winner advancing to the College World Series.
tough games earlier in the week
end that tested the nerves of Car
dinal fans and players alike.
The Regional got underway
on Friday evening with the Car
dinal outlasting Cal State-Fuller
ton, 3-2, in 13 innings. Junior ace
Jeremy Guthrie put on an iron
man performance for the Stan
ford, gutting out all 13 innings on
the mound.
Named the Most Outstanding
Player of the Regional, Guthrie
kept the Cardinal in the game as
Titan starter Wes Littieton stymied

Down 2-0 with two outs in the
bottom of the eighth, the Cardinal
made it a one-run game with an
RBI single by Carter. Then, the
Cardinal tied the game in the bot
tom of the ninth as senior second

baseman Chris O'Riordan
knocked in senior pinch-runner
Tobin Swope with a line-drive sin
gle up the middle.
Stanford eventually prevailed
in the 13th when senior Scott
Dragicevich hit a bases-loaded sin
gle, deservedly giving Guthrie a
victory on a night when the Gold
en Spikes Award finalist amazed
the 2,854 in attendance.
Throwing 145 pitches over 13
innings, Guthrie gave up just two
runs on nine hits to move to 11-1
on the season with a 2.34 ERA.
On Saturday, the Cardinal con
tinued its great play in its first
meeting with Long Beach State,
winning 5-4 behind 6 1/3 strong
innings by junior lefthander Tim
Cunningham (9-2).
Carrying a 5-2 lead into the bot
tom of the ninth inning, the Cardi
nal saw the game get a little too
close for comfort, as the Dirtbags
scored two before putting the tying
and winning runs in scoring posi

tion with two outs.
However, senior reliever Dan
Rich came through in the clutch,
inducing a grounder to O'Riordan
for the game's final out.
The Cardinal defense was solid
all weekend long, as the infield, led
by senior shortstop Andy
Topham, executed play after play,
making the spectacular look rou
tine after three days.
When asked after the game if
the Cardinal infield was one of the
best defensive unit that he had
ever seen, Dirtbags head coach
Mike Weathers summed it up with
the single world: "Absolutely."
Added Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess: "You can go to
any major league game you want,
and not see better plays in baseball.
I don't care what level it is."
Three members of the Cardinal
infield — O'Riordan, Topham and
Dragicevich — were named to the
All-Regional team, as were Carter,
Cooper, Garko and Guthrie.
