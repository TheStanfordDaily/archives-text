# Crew teams finish seasons on high notes
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Following a year of grueling training that
translated into impressive regular seasons, the
Stanford men's and women's crew teams
capped their seasons last weekend with strong
showings at the International Rowing Associa
tion and NCAA Championships, respectively.
There were few surprises at the NCAA
Women's Rowing Championships in Indi
anapolis, Ind., as Brown University and de
lending champion Washington dominated the
field of 12. But the Cardinal varsity eight ad
vanced to the Grand Final in its first-ever NCAA
C championship appearance.

Brown edged out the Huskies for the team
points title, 67-63, but Washington's varsity and
junior varsity eights remained undefeated, as
they handed Brown's varsity and junior varsity
eights their first losses of the season.
Coming off one of its best regular seasons in
history, the Cardinal varsity eight had high
hopes heading into the weekend. With a third
place finish behind Yale and Brown in their first
heat on Friday morning, Stanford advanced to
the semifinals. The Cardinal was a miniscule .03
seconds behind Yale for second place.
Stanford, led by coach Aimee Baker, the ad
vanced to the Grand Final following an impres
sive third-place finish in the semifinals on Satur
day. I he Cardinal finished 3.5 seconds behind
first-place Brown and ahead of Michigan and

Southern California, both of which competed in
last year's Grand Final.
After rowing two of its best races of the year
in the heat and semifinal, the Cardinal strug
gled somewhat in the Grand Final and finished
sixth, 16 seconds behind first-place Washing
ton. After California, which Stanford beat dur
ing the regular season, overtook Ohio State for
third place during the second 500 meters, the
positions remained unchanged through the fin
ish.
Fora team that was unranked two years ago
and finished 19th among varsity eights last year,
an NCAA berth, let alone a sixth-place finish,
could be considered an amazing accomplish

ment.
Meanwhile, Stanford's junior varsity eight,
coming off a strong third-place finish at the Pa
cific 10 Conference Championships, finished
fifth in the Petite Final. After a slow start, the
Cardinal made a push over the last 1,000 meters
and finished less than a second behind Harvard
for fourth place and less than two seconds be
hind Cal for third.
As a team, Stanford finished with 26 points,
good for 10th place overall. Cal finished third,
giving the Pac-10 three schools in the top 10.

The Stanford women's crew team finished 1 Oth at the NCAA Championships last weekend. The light
weight women's crew team placed sixth and the men's crew team finished 13th.
Phillips, bbth rowers on the varsity
eight, have been a large part of
Stanford's rise the past few years. An
NCAA bid was a fitting conclusion to
their Stanford careers.
"It made this season extra spe
cial to me," Tuiasosopo said. "Last
year, with the progress we made
and all the training we were plan
ning for this year, I knew we would
make it. However, when I first
started crew as a freshman I would
have never guessed it.
"I owe our success to my team
mates who are all warriors in their
own right and my wonderful
coach, Aimee Baker, who taught us
to be fearless, determined, and to
believe [in myself]."
With valuable postseason expe
rience, however, Stanford will re
turn a group of rowers eager to get

back to the NCAA Championships
and defend its place among the na
tion's elite crews.
Several hundred miles northeast,
the Stanford men's team, under the
guidance of coach Craig Amerkha
niar, wrapped up one of its better
seasons in history at the IRA Cham
pionships in Camden, N.J.
In its first heat on Thursday, the
Cardinal varsity eight rowed to a
third-place finish behind eventual
Grand Final winner California and
Grand Final qualifier Navy. In a
repechage later that morning, the
varsity eight again finished third,
holding off Boston University.
In the semifinals on Friday,
Dartmouth defeated Stanford by
less than a second, but the second
place finish was good enough fora
spot in the third-level final.
On Saturday morning, Stan
ford exacted revenge against Dart
mouth in the third-level final,
which also featured Marist, Brown,

Boston University and George
town. The Cardinal finished more
than two seconds ahead of second
place Dartmouth and finished 13th
overall among varsity eights.
"It was the race of our lives,"
said senior Justin Virgili. "The
whole weekend sort of reminded
me of boats and races I had been
in during my whole four-year ca
reer and this was a great way to
go out."
Gal defeated Wisconsin in the
Grand Final, with Pac-10 crews
Washington and Oregon Suite a
close third and fourth, respectively.
The Stanford freshmen eight,
which had not competed at the
IRA Championships last year, fin
ished third in the third-level final
and finished 15th overall.
A fifth-place finish in its first heat
put the freshmen eight in a
repechage later that morning,
which turned out to be one of Stan
ford's most exciting races of (he

weekend. The Cardinal finished
0.13 seconds behind Northeastern
for second place, a position that
would have given the Cardinal a
spot in a semifinal.
The men's varsity four, made
up of rowers on the junior varsity
eight during the regular season,
finished fifth in its repechage and
failed to qualify fora final.
Wisconsin edged Princeton,
323-316, for the team-points title,
and Stanford finished Kith in a
field of more than 60 schools.
In addition to Virgili, seniors
Nathan Schuett and Mario Luis
Ramirez, both key contributors to
Stanford's success the past few sea
sons, will graduate this year.
The men will return a strong
squad next year as they look to be
competitive in the Pac-10, which
has quickly become one of the best
conferences in the sport.
"I think the program is headed
in a great direction," Virgili said.

and Stanford finished Kith in a
field of more than 60 schools.
In addition to Virgili, seniors
Nathan Schuett and Mario Luis
Ramirez, both key contributors to
Stanford's success the past few sea
sons, will graduate this year.
The men will return a strong
squad next year as they look to be
competitive in the Pac-10, which
has quickly become one of the best
conferences in the sport.
"I think the program is headed
in a great direction," Virgili said.
Following a year of grueling training that
translated into impressive regular seasons, the
Stanford men's and women's crew teams
capped their seasons last weekend with strong
showings at the International Rowing Associa
tion and NCAA Championships, respectively.
There were few surprises at the NCAA
Women's Rowing Championships in Indi
anapolis, Ind., as Brown University and de
lending champion Washington dominated the
field of 12. But the Cardinal varsity eight ad
vanced to the Grand Final in its first-ever NCAA
C championship appearance.

Brown edged out the Huskies for the team
points title, 67-63, but Washington's varsity and
junior varsity eights remained undefeated, as
they handed Brown's varsity and junior varsity
eights their first losses of the season.
Coming off one of its best regular seasons in
history, the Cardinal varsity eight had high
hopes heading into the weekend. With a third
place finish behind Yale and Brown in their first
heat on Friday morning, Stanford advanced to
the semifinals. The Cardinal was a miniscule .03
seconds behind Yale for second place.
Stanford, led by coach Aimee Baker, the ad
vanced to the Grand Final following an impres
sive third-place finish in the semifinals on Satur
day. I he Cardinal finished 3.5 seconds behind
first-place Brown and ahead of Michigan and

Southern California, both of which competed in
last year's Grand Final.
After rowing two of its best races of the year
in the heat and semifinal, the Cardinal strug
gled somewhat in the Grand Final and finished
sixth, 16 seconds behind first-place Washing
ton. After California, which Stanford beat dur
ing the regular season, overtook Ohio State for
third place during the second 500 meters, the
positions remained unchanged through the fin
ish.
Fora team that was unranked two years ago
and finished 19th among varsity eights last year,
an NCAA berth, let alone a sixth-place finish,
could be considered an amazing accomplish

ment.
Meanwhile, Stanford's junior varsity eight,
coming off a strong third-place finish at the Pa
cific 10 Conference Championships, finished
fifth in the Petite Final. After a slow start, the
Cardinal made a push over the last 1,000 meters
and finished less than a second behind Harvard
for fourth place and less than two seconds be
hind Cal for third.
As a team, Stanford finished with 26 points,
good for 10th place overall. Cal finished third,
giving the Pac-10 three schools in the top 10.

The Stanford women's crew team finished 1 Oth at the NCAA Championships last weekend. The light
weight women's crew team placed sixth and the men's crew team finished 13th.
Phillips, bbth rowers on the varsity
eight, have been a large part of
Stanford's rise the past few years. An
NCAA bid was a fitting conclusion to
their Stanford careers.
"It made this season extra spe
cial to me," Tuiasosopo said. "Last
year, with the progress we made
and all the training we were plan
ning for this year, I knew we would
make it. However, when I first
started crew as a freshman I would
have never guessed it.
"I owe our success to my team
mates who are all warriors in their
own right and my wonderful
coach, Aimee Baker, who taught us
to be fearless, determined, and to
believe [in myself]."
With valuable postseason expe
rience, however, Stanford will re
turn a group of rowers eager to get

back to the NCAA Championships
and defend its place among the na
tion's elite crews.
Several hundred miles northeast,
the Stanford men's team, under the
guidance of coach Craig Amerkha
niar, wrapped up one of its better
seasons in history at the IRA Cham
pionships in Camden, N.J.
In its first heat on Thursday, the
Cardinal varsity eight rowed to a
third-place finish behind eventual
Grand Final winner California and
Grand Final qualifier Navy. In a
repechage later that morning, the
varsity eight again finished third,
holding off Boston University.
In the semifinals on Friday,
Dartmouth defeated Stanford by
less than a second, but the second
place finish was good enough fora
spot in the third-level final.
On Saturday morning, Stan
ford exacted revenge against Dart
mouth in the third-level final,
which also featured Marist, Brown,

Boston University and George
town. The Cardinal finished more
than two seconds ahead of second
place Dartmouth and finished 13th
overall among varsity eights.
"It was the race of our lives,"
said senior Justin Virgili. "The
whole weekend sort of reminded
me of boats and races I had been
in during my whole four-year ca
reer and this was a great way to
go out."

A fifth-place finish in its first heat
put the freshmen eight in a
repechage later that morning,
which turned out to be one of Stan
ford's most exciting races of (he

weekend. The Cardinal finished
0.13 seconds behind Northeastern
for second place, a position that
would have given the Cardinal a
spot in a semifinal.
