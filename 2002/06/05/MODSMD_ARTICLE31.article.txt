# Crew teams finish seasons on high notes
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Following a year of grueling training that
translated into impressive regular seasons, the
Stanford men's and women's crew teams
capped their seasons last weekend with strong
showings at the International Rowing Associa
tion and NCAA Championships, respectively.
There were few surprises at the NCAA
Women's Rowing Championships in Indi
anapolis, Ind., as Brown University and de
lending champion Washington dominated the
field of 12. But the Cardinal varsity eight ad
vanced to the Grand Final in its first-ever NCAA
C championship appearance.

Saturday: Stanford men finished 13th at
the IRA championships; Stanford women
finished 10th at the NCAA Championships
Sunday: Stanford women's lightweight
finished sixth at the IRA Championships

Brown edged out the Huskies for the team
points title, 67-63, but Washington's varsity and
junior varsity eights remained undefeated, as
they handed Brown's varsity and junior varsity
eights their first losses of the season.
Coming off one of its best regular seasons in
history, the Cardinal varsity eight had high
hopes heading into the weekend. With a third
place finish behind Yale and Brown in their first
heat on Friday morning, Stanford advanced to
the semifinals. The Cardinal was a miniscule .03
seconds behind Yale for second place.
Stanford, led by coach Aimee Baker, the ad
vanced to the Grand Final following an impres
sive third-place finish in the semifinals on Satur
day. I he Cardinal finished 3.5 seconds behind
first-place Brown and ahead of Michigan and

Southern California, both of which competed in
last year's Grand Final.
After rowing two of its best races of the year
in the heat and semifinal, the Cardinal strug
gled somewhat in the Grand Final and finished
sixth, 16 seconds behind first-place Washing
ton. After California, which Stanford beat dur
ing the regular season, overtook Ohio State for
third place during the second 500 meters, the
positions remained unchanged through the fin
ish.
Fora team that was unranked two years ago
and finished 19th among varsity eights last year,
an NCAA berth, let alone a sixth-place finish,
could be considered an amazing accomplish

ment.
Meanwhile, Stanford's junior varsity eight,
coming off a strong third-place finish at the Pa
cific 10 Conference Championships, finished
fifth in the Petite Final. After a slow start, the
Cardinal made a push over the last 1,000 meters
and finished less than a second behind Harvard
for fourth place and less than two seconds be
hind Cal for third.
As a team, Stanford finished with 26 points,
good for 10th place overall. Cal finished third,
giving the Pac-10 three schools in the top 10.
