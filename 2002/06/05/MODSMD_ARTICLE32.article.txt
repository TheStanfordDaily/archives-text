# Guthrie's legendary outing paces Card
## 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Friday night was one of those
special evenings at the yard, a 13-
inning classic that will be remem
bered as one of the greatest base
ball game ever played at Sunken
Diamond. Stanford defeated Cal
State-Fullerton in their NCAA Re
gional opener with clutch hitting, a
never-say-die approach and, most
importantly, Jeremy Guthrie.
Guthrie, the Cardinal's No. 1
starter, battled on the mound for
all 13 frames, needing just 144
pitches to complete the longest
and most rewarding outing of his
career. With the Cardinal trailing
by one run in the ninth inning,
though, Guthrie contemplated the
possibility that it could be his final
collegiate start.
"It's a lot like you're at the end of
your life," he said after game dur
ing an emotional press conference.
Speaking through tears, he
continued: "In the ninth when I
had the two outs, I kind of looked
around . . . and I just realized . .
. that it could have come to an
end right there, and that's not a
good feeling."
The junior, who will undoubt
edly sign a professional contract
after being selected 22nd by the
Cleveland Indians in yesterday's
draft, saw his teammates scratch
out the tying run in the boUom
half of the ninth and extend the
game, giving Guthrie new lite.
Knowing he may never have
taken the Sunken mound again is
"what made me want to go out
there and keep throwing," he said.

"There's nothing left. . . That's
what pushed me through it. There
were so many thoughts and so
much emotion and gratefulness in
my heart that I really wanted to go
out there and help the team win
and be there until the end."
Titans head coach George Hor
ton said Guthrie was surely one of
the nation's finest pitchers.
"And knowing how competitive
lie is, 1 knew they were going to
have to rip the ball out of his
hands," Horton said. "Besides his
stuff, that's kind of what makes
him pretty special."
Special, indeed. Guthrie need
ed barely more than 11 pitches per
inning and allowed only one
earned run over the course of the
game. He didn't pile up his usual
high strikeout total, fanning just
four, and he walked three while
hitting three more. But with guts
and heart, Guthrie finished a ball
game that, so far, is his crowning
moment as a Stanford pitcher.
"We've had unbelievable pitch
ers here at this school, and he's in
the mold of the best that we've had
here," said head coach Mark Mar
quess, placing Guthrie in line with
former Cardinal pitchers such as
Jack McDowell, Mike Mussina and
Jason Young.
Friday's outing was the latest in
the hottest stretch fora collegiate
pitcher in recent memory. Over
iiis last six starts, Guthrie has com
piled a 5-1 record, an astounding
1.64 ERA and five complete
games. The only game he did not
finish — last week against Wash

Junior pitcher Jeremy Guthrie has been the top pitcher for the Cardinal the
entire season and is a candidate for the Golden Spikes Award given to the
nation's top collegiate player.
ington State — he worked seven
innings on a predetermined pitch
count in order to stay fresh lor Fri
day's start. Apparently, it worked.
It also inspired two more out
standing outings by Cardinal
starters over the weekend. On Sat
urday against Long Beach State,
junior Tim Cunningham pitched
into the seventh and allowed just
three runs on four hits. Sunday,
sophomore John Hudgins went
the distance — but just nine in
nings this time — in his most ef
fective start since late April at Ore
gon State.
Said Guthrie: "We're all start
ing to feed off each other, where
every great start is backed up by
another one."
"The whole pitching staff looks
up to Jeremy," Hudgins said. "1

think he's the best pitcher in col
lege baseball, and he sets a great
example for all of us. We're just
out there trying to duplicate what
he does."
Junior catcher Ryan Garko
commended his battery mates for
their performances under post
season pressure and their an
choring of the team over the
weekend.
"All the guys had big spots [this
weekend], and they won them,"
Garko said. "You have to give
credit to these guys because they
carried us all weekend, and hope
fully they'll carry us all the way to
Omaha."
The Cardinal starting trio is
now 29-4 on the season with a solid
3.53 ERA heading into this week
end's Super Regional best-of-three
series with Southern California.
Guthrie, Cunningham and Hud
gins are a combined 3-1 against the
Trojans this year in six starts.
