# Guthrie's legendary outing paces Card
## 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Friday night was one of those
special evenings at the yard, a 13-
inning classic that will be remem
bered as one of the greatest base
ball game ever played at Sunken
Diamond. Stanford defeated Cal
State-Fullerton in their NCAA Re
gional opener with clutch hitting, a
never-say-die approach and, most
importantly, Jeremy Guthrie.
Guthrie, the Cardinal's No. 1
starter, battled on the mound for
all 13 frames, needing just 144
pitches to complete the longest
and most rewarding outing of his
career. With the Cardinal trailing
by one run in the ninth inning,
though, Guthrie contemplated the
possibility that it could be his final
collegiate start.
"It's a lot like you're at the end of
your life," he said after game dur
ing an emotional press conference.
Speaking through tears, he
continued: "In the ninth when I
had the two outs, I kind of looked
around . . . and I just realized . .
. that it could have come to an
end right there, and that's not a
good feeling."
The junior, who will undoubt
edly sign a professional contract
after being selected 22nd by the
Cleveland Indians in yesterday's
draft, saw his teammates scratch
out the tying run in the boUom
half of the ninth and extend the
game, giving Guthrie new lite.
Knowing he may never have
taken the Sunken mound again is
"what made me want to go out
there and keep throwing," he said.

"There's nothing left. . . That's
what pushed me through it. There
were so many thoughts and so
much emotion and gratefulness in
my heart that I really wanted to go
out there and help the team win
and be there until the end."
Titans head coach George Hor
ton said Guthrie was surely one of
the nation's finest pitchers.
"And knowing how competitive
lie is, 1 knew they were going to
have to rip the ball out of his
hands," Horton said. "Besides his
stuff, that's kind of what makes
him pretty special."
Special, indeed. Guthrie need
ed barely more than 11 pitches per
inning and allowed only one
earned run over the course of the
game. He didn't pile up his usual
high strikeout total, fanning just
four, and he walked three while
hitting three more. But with guts
and heart, Guthrie finished a ball
game that, so far, is his crowning
moment as a Stanford pitcher.
"We've had unbelievable pitch
ers here at this school, and he's in
the mold of the best that we've had
here," said head coach Mark Mar
quess, placing Guthrie in line with
former Cardinal pitchers such as
Jack McDowell, Mike Mussina and
Jason Young.
Friday's outing was the latest in
the hottest stretch fora collegiate
pitcher in recent memory. Over
iiis last six starts, Guthrie has com
piled a 5-1 record, an astounding
1.64 ERA and five complete
games. The only game he did not
finish â€” last week against Wash
