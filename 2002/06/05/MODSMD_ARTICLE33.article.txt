MEN'S TRACK AND FIELD
Thursday-Saturday: Stanford fin
ished eighth at the NCAA Championships

Willi preliminary heats on Wednesday,
Stanford's first opportunity to score points
came on Thursday with the 1 (),()()() meters.
Junior Louis Luc hini placed fifth in the
event with a time of 29 minutes, 29.70 sec
onds. Junior Adam Tenforde, competing
in his first outdoor championship, fin
ished close behind in 29:31*.47 for seventh
place.
Both athletes earned All-American sta
tus, a first-time honor for Tenforde. Luchi
ni is now a four-time All-American. Team
mate sophomore lan Dobson started the

race as well, but had to pull out halfway
through due to a foot injury.
On Friday, junior Jesse Thomas became
Stanford's first All-American in the 3,000-
meter steeplechase, placing eighth with a
time 0f8:42.57.
Junior Omer Inan was the Cardinal's
lone representative in the throws, and
placed ninth in the discus with a mark of
191 feet, 1 inch.
Stanford saved the best for last, garner
ing most of its points on Saturday, the last
clay of competition.
On his final attempt, junior Michael
Ponikvar cleared 7-4.5 in the high jump,
two inches higher than any of his previous
jumps this season, for third place. Hie
mark was as high as any in the competition,

but the two other jumpers to clear that
height beat out Ponikvar with fewer misses.
On the track, the 1,500 meters held the
highlight of the men's competition, and a
quite unexpected one at that.
Two days earlier, a Cardinal hopeful for
the 1,500-meter tide, senior Gabejennings,
surprisingly missed qualifying for the finals
by a tantalizing .03 seconds.
Sophomore Don Sage, who placed fifth in
the event last year as a true freshman, is al
ways a threat to win at any time, but had yet
to have a breakthrough race this season.
With Sage's performance a question
mark and Jennings absent, the Cardinal's
hopes in the event seemed to have
dimmed.
However, Sage found his breakthrough

race at exactly the right time, winning the
event in a time 0f3:42.65.
"I knew it was possible to win, but I
didn't expect it. because I hadn't won a race
all season," said Sage. "You don't get third
in [Pacific 10 Conference Championships]
and expect to win NCAAs."
For most of the race, it appeared as
though Sage's expectations would prove
true.
Sage sat near the back of the pack for the
first three laps, waiting for the last 400 me
ters to make his move. With 150 meters to
go, Sage had already worked his way be
hind leaders Adrian Blincoe and Alan
Webb.
