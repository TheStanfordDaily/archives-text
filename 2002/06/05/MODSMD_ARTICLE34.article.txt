# U.S. hooliganism nearing fever pitch

It's so electric you can't help but be
energized by all of the excitement in
the air. Everywhere you turn peo
ple are talking about it, reliving all
of the ini :redible moments, idolizing all of
their childhood heroes, and dreaming
about t'he national team going to the
podium with the championship trophy
hoisted high above their heads.
One e again, it's World Cup time in the
United States of America.
One e every four years, a nation sits cap
tivated as the finest athletes in the world
gather on foreign soil (well, for most of the
teams anyway) and contest each other in
the w< Drld's most popular sporting event.
Stores i close early. United States soccer
flags 1 lang high in every window.
Ev en the national media gets into the
hype and hysteria of the World Cup.
ESPT vj.com is prominently displaying its
hypt .*rlink to World Cup coverage on the
horn ie page of its Web site, listed seventh
in tl ie menu, just below the link to auto
racing and just above the link to coverage
of tl ne WNBA.
t \nd Americans are eating it all up.
Th ere were unconfirmed reports that
sin ce the networks have started live
br< Dadcasting of some of the games
pi; lyed at 2:30 a.m. due to the time dif
fe 1 rence between the United States and
S( )uth Korea, ratings of traditionally
p< Dwerhouse shows in that time-slot —
namely re-runs of Starsky and Hutch
a nd Cinemax soft-core porn — have

taken a nose dive as soc
cer-fanatic Americans
are changing channels
to watch the exhilarat
ing, high-flying action
of Argentina's 1-0 win
over Nigeria.
And just like four
years ago, American
streets are overrun with

raucous fans reveling in the World Cup
experience. Police forces all around the
nation are getting ready to implement
riot protection plans in case the United
States scores a win over their long time
nemeses, Poland, Portugal and South
Korea. Police are hoping to avoid a re
peat of the mayhem and destruction that
took place after America's women won in
2000.
Yes, it certainly does seem as though
the country has been overwhelmed by
the shear magnitude and national im
portance of the World Cup. Americans
show a true passion for the world's most
popular game that just cannot be ri
valed anywhere else in the world.
The loyalty and dedication with
which Americans stand in support of the
true "America's team" is nothing short
of awe-inspiring. One can't avoid walk
ing down a busy street and hearing ex
cited school children comparing play
ers' stats and bios as if they'd been living
and breathing the game all of their lives.
And once again all other sports in the

country take a back seat to the nation's
first true passion. I'he NBA semifinals
and finals will be subordinated to tape
delayed broadcasts coming in from the
opposite side of the globe. The U.S. Open
of golf and the French Open of tennis will
be mere afterthoughts as the front pages
of newspapers across the country fill up
with article after article of analysis and
coverage of every second of World Cup
action.
It's a great atmosphere for watching
the games, and you can't help but feel
that little twinge of excitement running
up and down your spine. The feeling of
camaraderie with your fellow Americans
as you gear up to support USA soccer on
its championship run is a truly unique
feeling that we only get to share every
four years.
There's no use trying to deny it, resis
tance is futile. We are first and foremost a
nation completely dedicated to soccer.
Truly, madly, deeply, it courses through
the blood in our veins and takes over the
daily events of our lives. Embrace it, love
it, live it. Because it'll be another four
years before we can stand up toe-to-toe
with our Uruguayan and Senegalian foes
and defiantly chant "USA, USA".
1 love this game.
