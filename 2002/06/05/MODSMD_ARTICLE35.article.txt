# Women's sailing finishes 11th at national regatta

### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
If there is one lasting thought from the
Stanford women's sailing team's 11th
place finish at the Intercollegiate Sailing
Association championships last weekend,
it is simply this:
Catch them in a couple of years â€” they
just might win the darn thing.
The future certainly looks bright for
the Cardinal women, who were led by a
group of sophomores and juniors to a sat
isfying I lth-place finish.
Junior Sarah Zukerman teamed with
sophomores Jen Porter and Jess Gray to
take 10th place in the A-division, the most
competitive division at the champi

onships. Only 10 points separated the sev
enth through 10th place teams.
The Cardinal contingent also sent two
teams to the B-Division. These teams
combined to take 12th place with 189
points. The B-Division teams were made
up of junior Kara Sweeney and sopho
mores Ashley Frush, Jenais Zarlin, Liz
Shearer and Taylor Clark.
Old Dominion won its first ICSA title in
more than 10 years, edging out host
Hawaii by just nine points.
The season is not over, however, for
Stanford sailing. The Cardinal sends its
coed team to Honolulu for this weekend's
ICSA Coed Sailing Championships.

The Stanford women's sailing team placed 11th at the ICSA Championships in Honolulu,
Hawaii last weekend. The coed sailing team travels to Hawaii this weekend for their shot at an
ICSA title.
Leading the way for the Cardi
nal in the coed championships
will be juniors David Kenny, Ted
Conrads, Zukerman and
Sweeney, sophomores Jess Gray,
David Phillips and Peter Deming
and freshmen Lauren Gross and
Amy Halvorsen.
The coed championships will
cap a sailing season that has had
some ups and downs, and was
highlighted by a first-place finish
by the women's team and a sec
ond-place finish by the coed team
at the Pacific Coast Champi

onships.
The win there by the women's
team was extra special, since the
Cardinal edged out the same
Hawaii team that took second
place at the ICSA Championships
last week.
"I'm so proud of the women
for knocking off defending North
American Champions Hawaii,"
said coach Jay Kehoe of Stan
ford's first-place finish at the con
ference championships. "All their
time on the water paid off, [and]
they [lived] up to Stanford's win
ning tradition."
The spring schedule also hit a
high point in San Francisco in
April, when the Cardinal took top
honors in the St. Francis Invita

tional. Stanford outlasted 27
other teams to take the invitation
al title.
The victory in San Francisco
came on the heels of a fifth-place
finish at the Jeremy Mclntyre
Team Race at home in March.
The Cardinal went 5-8 over the
course of the two-day event, far
behind champion Boston Col
lege, which finished 12-2.
Still, at that point, Kehoe no
ticed that his team had the poten
tial for something great.
"We learned a number of
lessons this weekend that will
make us stronger going into the
[Pacific Coast Championships],
and then onto the national cham
pionships," Kehoe said.
