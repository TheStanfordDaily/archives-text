### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
If there is one lasting thought from the
Stanford women's sailing team's 11th
place finish at the Intercollegiate Sailing
Association championships last weekend,
it is simply this:
Catch them in a couple of years â€” they
just might win the darn thing.
The future certainly looks bright for
the Cardinal women, who were led by a
group of sophomores and juniors to a sat
isfying I lth-place finish.
Junior Sarah Zukerman teamed with
sophomores Jen Porter and Jess Gray to
take 10th place in the A-division, the most
competitive division at the champi

onships. Only 10 points separated the sev
enth through 10th place teams.
The Cardinal contingent also sent two
teams to the B-Division. These teams
combined to take 12th place with 189
points. The B-Division teams were made
up of junior Kara Sweeney and sopho
mores Ashley Frush, Jenais Zarlin, Liz
Shearer and Taylor Clark.
Old Dominion won its first ICSA title in
more than 10 years, edging out host
Hawaii by just nine points.
The season is not over, however, for
Stanford sailing. The Cardinal sends its
coed team to Honolulu for this weekend's
ICSA Coed Sailing Championships.
