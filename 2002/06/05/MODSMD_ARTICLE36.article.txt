# Five Stanford players taken in first day of MLB draft
## 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For the No. 7 Stanford Cardinal, whose Super
Regional series with 14th-ranked Southern Califor
nia begins Friday night, the College World Series in
Omaha is the only thing left to worry about.
Well, almost.
Yesterday, five Stanford players were chosen in
the first day of Major League Baseball's First-Year
Player Draft, and more could follow in today's final
30 rounds.
The headlining selection was junior pitcher Je
remy Guthrie, selected by the Cleveland Indians in
the first round with the 22nd overall pick. Guthrie,
one of five finalists for the Golden Spikes Award
given to the nation's top player, led the Stanford
pitching staff for the second straight season and
compiled a 11-1 record and a 2.34 ERA. Yesterday,
he became the 13th first-round pick from Stanford
in the last 16 years.
Guthrie said he wasn't surprised that he ended
up with Cleveland and was excited that his decision
to return to school this year had worked out for the
best. Last year, the Pittsburgh Pirates nabbed
Guthrie with their third-round pick but the two
parties could not come to terms in the off-season.
The Indians also selected junior outfielder Jason
Cooper with their third-round choice, the 82nd
pick of the draft.
"I had some expectations of some other teams
that showed interest in some other earlier positions,
but Cleveland also showed a lot of interest before
the draft," Cooper said. "The draft's a strange
thing, and people get shifted and you can never re
ally predict how it's going to go. I was fortunate
enough to get drafted early and I'm excited be
cause it's a great opportunity."
Out of high school, Cooper was a second-round
selection of the Philadelphia Phillies.
A pair of Cardinal seniors sort of saw their names
light up the draft boards as well. Senior reliever J. D.
Willcox monitored the draft online, and placed
phone calls to senior second baseman Chris O'Ri

ordan and senior shortstop Andy Topham when he
heard their selections.
The Texas Rangers chose O'Riordan with their
eighth-round choice and Topham was picked one
round later by the Houston Astros. Both were se
lected for the first time.
"At first I thought he might be joking a little bit,"
Topham said of Willcox's phone call. "But I went
over and checked on the computer, and sure
enough it was there. It's really exciting."
The last Cardinal player chosen in the first of two
draft days was junior pitcher Darin Naatjes. Naatjes
was converted from a rarely used infielder to a re
lief pitcher this season, and he pitched to the tune
of a 4-0 record and a 2.53 ERA. He was chosen by
Philadelphia in the 14th round. He moved up from
being a 22nd-round choice out of high school in the
1999 draft.
Despite the excitement surrounding the draft,
every Cardinal player chosen said he was more con
cerned with the upcoming task of reaching the Col
lege World Series than yesterday's events.
Cooper credited former Cardinal standout out
fielder Joe Borchard's experience with the 2000
draft and the 2000 College World Series as an exam
ple of how to balance his individual interests in the
draft with the team's focus on getting back to Omaha.
"I think it takes a certain amount of maturity and
confidence in your ability, and just a lot of focus on
the task at hand," he said. "Obviously Joe was some
one to look at and see that he was really focused on
Stanford and winning the championship and he
didn't let that [draft] stuff get to him, and that's the
approach that I'm attempting to follow."
O'Riordan agreed, saying that "the draft is real
important to all of the players that are playing here,
but at the same time we all realize that first comes
our college game, and this weekend is the biggest
weekend in any of our college baseball careers."
That assessment may change if Stanford is able
to advance past this weekend, giving O'Riordan
and Topham's senior class four consecutive trips to
Omaha — a would-be first in the Cardinal's proud
baseball history.
