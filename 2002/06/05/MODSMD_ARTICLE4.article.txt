# Taking advantage of the University's flexible enrollment policy...
## Students stop out 
### BILL BOWEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
As graduation draws near, many graduating
seniors look forward to a dizzying number of
postgraduate options â€” work, intensive ser
vice, or some time off to relax, travel, and pon
der their futures. But thanks to a flexible en
rollment process, these options are open to
Stanford students well before their degree is fin
ished.
Some students spend time engaged in inten
sive service in the developing world. Some em
bark on religious pilgrimages to foreign coun
tries. Some spend time at home caring for idling
parents or friends. The reasons why students

take time off are as diverse as the places where
they choose to live.
Sophomore Lizzi Heydamen spent 10
months in the Young Judaea Year Course,
where she spent three months on a kibbutz, a
socialist commune in Israel where she volun
teered in the kitchen and the pre-kindergarten
and a quarter of study in Jerusalem where she
studied Hebrew, the Torah, modern Israeli
politics, Zionism, and the history of Jerusalem,
among other things.
For Heydamen, taking time off was neces
sary to help her delve into issues of her cultural
and religious identity that she could not fully
address on campus.
"I took a break from the traditional flow of

an American student in order to explore issues
and places I felt it was time to learn more
about," she said. "I'd always been interested in
religion, specifically my own, which I felt I
knew little about by the time I got into college.
There were a thousand places I hadn't been in
the world that I would have loved to explore,
but I felt going to Israel meshed my desire to
learn more about Judaism with the adventure
some spirit within."
I n fact, a number of students on campus stop
out to delve deeper into their religious beliefs
and values. Many religions encourage or even
mandate that followers to take time off' from
academic and career pursuits to
gain a deeper understanding of
their faith and share it with others.
Junior Jared Grose spent two
years in Spain serving as a mission
ary for the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-Day Saints. Grose said the
time he spent in Spain was valuable
in and of itself, but it also allowed
him to put his academic experiences
into a bigger perspective.
"Being away from Stanford for
two years changed a lot of my per
ceptions." he said. "I came back a lit
tle more mature and looked at edu
cation as something that could com
pliment my life, but not life itself ."
Heydamen agrees. "Words like
'education' and 'learning' have
taken on very limited meanings for
college-bound Americans," she said.
"We think of the important, docu
mentable kinds of education and
learning as happening only in class
es."
Junior Casey Godelfer is also tak
ing time off to focus on non-acade
mic learning. According to
Godelfer, "While you can do any
thing you want at Stanford, there is
only so much time in the day. I de
cided a year off would give me the
time I needed to pursue music, get
back into soccer, and learn things on
my own that I don't have time to
here, like another language."
Ironically, realizing that there is
more to life than academics leads
some students to a greater appreci
ation of'the academic opportunities
here. "A wider perspective helped
me decide what I want to do profes
sionally and academically." Grose
said. "When I returned I was deter
mined to really exploit the opportu
nities that Stanford offers, whereas I
previously might have taken them
for granted."
Godelfer agreed. "Time off will
give me much-needed relaxation,"
she said. "It will allow me to pursue
interests that I don't have time for at
Stanford, and it will probably give
me more insight into what I want to
do with my life. By the time I come
back, I will know more of what I
want and how to get it... so I can
fully take advantage of everything
Stanford has to offer."
In fact, many students take time
off precisely so they can have time to

think about their academic interests
before choosing a major and career
path. According to Assoc. Director
of Undergraduate Advising Dandre
DeSandies, "Students who have a
hard time pinning down an acade
mic direction express a feeling of
embarrassment that they are wast
ing their parents' money. What usu
ally happens is that they go away, re
alize the limitations of not having a
degree and return to finish. Alter
natively, they get jobs in fields they
find interesting, find an academic
passion and come back to pursue
that passion."
DeSandies emphasized that ad
visors rarely suggest that students
stop out, but openly discuss the op
tion with students who are consider
ing it.
DeSandies said students typically
use their time away from Stanford
to finish uncompleted coursework,
recuperate from illness or find an
academic passion. The amount of
time students take to do this can
vary widely.
"The most interesting cases like
this have been students who
stopped out in the '70s and who pick
up now where they left off." De-
Sandies said. "I find these students
remarkably focused. They usually
had less-than-stellar academic ca
reers before leaving and now
achieve straight A's in their majors."
University Registrar Roger
Printup cited many additional rea
sons why students choose to stop
out, including pursuing different
educational opportunities through
other universities. "Some students
just want to take a break from their
studies and few fortunate souls get
to hike, bike, or sail in far-flung cor
ners of the world," he added.
Some students seek more per
manent career opportunities dur
ing their time off from Stanford.
This was common during the dot
com boom in the Bay Area, accord
ing to Printup and DeSandies.
"In the past few years, some
Stanford students left to seek their
fortune in Silicon Valley." Printup
said. "A few found fortune. More of
them came back to complete their
degree."
Returning from time off can add
perspective to academic pursuits,
but it can also be difficult to jump
back into a heavy academic sched
ule, according to many students.
"Coming back to Stanford was
harder than I imagined," Grose

said. "It wasn't that the schedule
was too demanding, but in my case,
getting back into the sciences was
hard. It had been almost five and a
half years since 1 had taken my last
chemistry class and that made get
ting back even harder."
Some students also have difficul
ty adjusting to the student lifestyle,
particularly if they have led a highly
independent and vivid experience
their time off .
When Heydamen returned to
college, she found herself older than
her fellow freshman in terms of both
age and experience. "I thought col
lege was boring and unchallenging.
1 found the day-to-day drone of
classes, meals, classes, meals and
dorm life sort of blah."
Others worry that their time off
can make it difficult to maintain con
tact with friends, relationships with
mentors, and involvement in ex
tracurricular activities.
However, Heydamen said that
not taking advantage of the oppor
tunity to stop out can also be risky.
"I talk to so many people here
who say they wish they'd taken a
year off ," she said, "My mom tried to
tell me that I could go explore Is
rael, Judaism and the world after
college ... but you can't make guar
antees about plans five years down
the road. 1 knew I'd be a different
person by then."
"Life has no finish line, and I fig
ure the last few years of our lives we
spend wishing we'd done more with
the first few, valuing them, cherish
ing them and filling them with as
much joy and experience as possi
ble," she said, "Because when we're
old we'll be sitting in our ixxking
chairs talking about what we did
when we were younger, and it won't
matter whether I graduated college
in 2003 or 2004."
"Basically, the choice to defer for
a year was probably the best decision
I ever made. I learned more about
people, myself, my religion that I
never would have dreamed possi
ble, and I ;ilso learned that there is
more that I don't know and will
never know than I ever thought
possible," Heydamen said.
"I came to college ready to work
and ready to learn, because I'd had
that year to get so much of my high
school childishness out of my sys
tem. I often say that taking a year off
between high school and college
should be a graduation require
ment."
