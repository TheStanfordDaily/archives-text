WOMEN'S TRACK AND
FIELD
Thursday-Saturday: Stan
ford finisned seventh at the
NCAA Championships

Despite the elements, Stanford
rose to challenge the stiff competi
tion, returning to the Farm with
an NCAA champion and four All-
American athletes.
Thirteen Stanford athletes
competed at the meet from May 29
to June 1, scoring 25 points over
the four days. Stanford's seventh
place showing was its best finish
since the 1986 season when the
Cardinal finished sixth.
South Carolina won this year's
title with 82 points.
Five athletes competed in
Thursday's competitions, with se
nior Maurica Carlucci and junior
Malindi Elmore running the 1,500
meters, junior Kimberly Stone
competing in the high jump, and
senior Laura Turner running in
the 3,000-meter steeplechase.
In her final undergraduate
track season, Carlucci set high per
sonal marks, with a career-best
time of 4 minutes, 16.51 seconds in
the 1,500 meters, good enough for
third overall. Her performance
propelled her into the fifth all-time
in the Stanford record books. El
more finished ninth in the prelim
inary rounds, narrowly missing a
spot in the finals.
In the high jump, Stone
reached a height of 5 feet, 7.25
inches to place 18th overall.

Turner concluded her under
graduate career by notching a
school record in the steeplechase.
Finishing 10th in her trials heat,
Turner, turned in a time of
10:07.77 in the preliminary
rounds, beating her previous
school record of 10:13.47.1n the fi
nals, Turner finished 12th but was
unable to beat her preliminary
mark.
In Friday's events, junior Lau
ren Fleshman and freshman Sara
Bei competed in the 1,500 meters,
sophomore Molly Meyer threw the
discus, and sophomore J illian Ca
marena competed in the shot put.
Fleshman once again captured
top honors in the 5,000 meters,
winning the championship and
making Stanford track and field
history as only the third Cardinal
woman to win two NCAA titles in
the same year. Fleshman placed
first with a time of 15:53.91. Earli
er this year, she won the indoor
3,000 meter NCAA title.
Taking the early lead in the
race, Fleshman dropped back as
far as seventh place.
"My plan was a little more flexi
ble this year," said Fleshman. "I
thought between 1,000 and 500
meters I would go for it. I knew the
pace was slow, but that was good
for me because I have a solid kick,
but I also felt that if the pace was
fast, I would still be in good shape.
I had a really good mind set. I was
ready for anything."
With six laps to go, Fleshman
held her place in a five-woman
pack before breaking away with a
strong kick. Pushed by Colorado's
Sara Gorton, Fleshman took a de
finitive lead during the bell lap,
separating herself on the back
stretch to finish strongly.
Competing in her first NCAA
Outdoor Championship, Meyer
placed 14th in the discus finals with
a mark of 162 feet, 9 inches. She has
improved her distance this season
by nearly 19 feet, qualify ing for the
NCAAs with a throw of 175-3 at the
Cardinal Qualifier on May 10.
Camarena continued her
steady rise as one of the nation's

top collegiate shot putters. Finish
ing third in the finals, she threw a
career best of 55-1 to maintain her
place as Stanford's second all-time
leading shot putter.

"I felt I could have thrown far
ther, but I can't complain," Ca
marena said. "I was expecting a big
throw and I got it. Now I can focus
on my finals at Stanford."
