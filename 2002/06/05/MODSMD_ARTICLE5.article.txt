Though the ASSU Undergrad
uate Senate passed about 50 Early
Discretionary Funding bills at
their Tuesday meeting and gave
Psychology Prof. Ewart Thomas
the ASSU Teaching Award, the
body's generosity failed to extend
to the ASSU Constitutional Coun
cil and Down With Gravity, a stu
dent juggling group.
Senator Brigitte Zimmerman, a
freshman, introduced a bill to
transfer the Council's entire $1,300
budget into stipends for the body's

four members. The bill failed 1 -5-1.
Despite Down With Gravity
President Miguel Chavez contest
ing the decision, the Senate up
held the Appropriations Commit
tee's recommendation that the
honorarium for famous juggler
Jason Garfield be cut from $3,000
to $1,500.
Chavez explained that while
Garfield's honoraria for perform
ing in a planned October 11 show
was only $ 1,500, Garfield probably
would not appear without getting
his travel expenses paid. However,
Chavez admitted that Down With
Gravity had not looked for other

sources of funding yet.
"The committee was concerned
that $3,000 was a lot for honorari
um," Appropriations Committee
Co-Chair Josh Shipp, a freshman,
explained.
Professor Ewart Thomas, who
taught Psychology 10/ Statistics 60
during winter quarter, received
the 2003 ASSU Teaching Award.
The Senate also voted to grant
$750 to finish the joint SOCA
ASSU Mural Project, started
under former ASSU President
Matt Brewer's administration. The
mural will be unveiled this Friday
at 5 p.m. in Tresidder Union.
