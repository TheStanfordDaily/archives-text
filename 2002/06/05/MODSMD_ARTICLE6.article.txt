### WAYNN LUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Undergraduate
Research Journal, a new student
publication on campus, featured 13
student-written pieces in its first
issue, which came out last Tuesday.
Sponsored by the ASSU Publica
tions Board, the Office of the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion. Undergraduate Research Pro
grams and various departments,
the first issue of the journal included
papers from disciplines ranging
from literature to psychology.
"[Our first issue] strives to show
case a wide array of original re
search conducted bycurrent under
graduates, thus providing a forum
in which individuals from diverse
fields can learn about research in
disciplines other than their own,"
said sophomore Patrick Wong, one
of the managing directors of the
journal.

The publication has attracted at
tention and sponsorship from at
least 10 departments ranging from
Art and Art History to Mechanical
Engineering. In addition, the Office
of Undergraduate Admissions has
expressed interest in using it as a
promotional tool by passing out
copies to high schools nationwide.
The journal also received the
Dean of Students 2001:2002 Out
standing Achievement Award.
"We had upwards of 60 submis
sions, and they were all very good,"
said freshman Alex Bradford, a co
editor-in-chief. "Our editors did a
great job selecting the papers that
represent the most exciting and in
novative research here at Stanford,
but I wish we could reward all stu
dents who submitted their research
to [the journal]."
All undergraduates were invit
ed to submit their papers for con
sideration in mid-February, as
long as they were the primary au

thors. Other contributors, includ
ing faculty, could be listed as sec
ondary authors.
"The staff of 35 undergraduates
has worked tirelessly this year to
produce [these] 74 pages," said
freshman (111 lis Baer, who is the sec -
tion editor for natural sciences and
engineering.
Since the journal is a peer-re
viewed research journal, the staff
includes three different section
editors for humanities, social sci
ences and natural sciences and
engineering.
The staff has high hopes for the
future.
"It was a great first year for us,
and we plan to continue working to
make (the journal] one of the top
undergraduate research journals in
the United States," said sophomore
Rachel Siegel, the director of the
production board and a section edi
tor for humanities.
"Not only are we thrilled with
the final product (which has been
well-received by the Stanford com
munity), but we are equally pleased
with the fact that we have created a
new niche among campus publica
tions - one that celebrates both the
breadth and depth of research here
at Stanford," said senior Donald
Matsuda, who is co-editor-in-chief
along with Bradford.
