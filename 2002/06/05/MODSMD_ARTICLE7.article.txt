# Student-run courses to come up for review
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When the Faculty Senate's
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies reconvenes this autumn, it
may review and propose changes
to the Student Initiated Courses
program.
Established during spring
quarter of last year, the program
tries to allow students to work with
faculty to create courses that ex
plore issues not otherwise covered
in the University curriculum. The
courses are offered fora few units
apiece. Teams of students coordi
nate the curriculum with faculty
sponsors and may invite guest
speakers.
Senior Rebecca Trotzky-Sirr,
one of the two student co-directors
of the program, explained what
she sees as the result of the classes.
"Student Initiated Courses en
hance the academic climate on
Stanford's campus by building a
structure for students to design
and participate in courses in areas
that are currently under ex
plored," Trotzky-Sirr said. "The
program empowers students to
pursue and direct their intellectu
al passions and create innovative
learning experiences."
A number of students have
found the courses to be a positive
asset by making the University
more responsive to the needs of its
undergraduates.
"('lasses organized through
[the program] help students dis
cuss things that undergraduates
think are important and express
things that might otherwise be
avoided," said junior Srinivas
Panguluri.
ASSU Vice President Christine

Cordero, a senior, expressed sup
port for the program, but suggest
ed there should be some revision
in its current structure.
"I completely support Student
Initiated Courses," Cordero said.
"But as with all projects and orga
nizations, [it] needs logistical im
provement that can only be at
tended to over time because orga
nization and program-wise it is a
very young group. I think the Uni
versity should use its own re
sources to help improve [the pro
gram] as an option for students to
further their education."
Many administrators and facul
ty members have also voiced
doubts about the program as it
now operates. Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education John
Bravman discussed how some in
dividuals have brought up the spe
cific worry that there is not enough
faculty-led supervision.
"University credit is meant to
reflect something that is delivered
by the sanction of a University-ap
proved faculty member," Brav
man said. "I know some colleagues
have felt almost pressured by stu
dents to sign off on something with
minimal oversight. A lot were
caught off-guard by this, some felt
pressured by students just to sign it
and that is certainly not OK."
While expressing concern
about the issue of oversight by the
faculty, Bravman said he is not op
posed to the program as a whole.
"I applaud the initiative part of
it very much," said Bravman. "We
should do all we can to teach cours
es students want to take; I am all
for that."
University Registrar Roger
Printup is among the administra
tors who have personally ques
tioned the level of oversight in the
program.
"There have been cases
brought to our attention where
these courses have very little or no
faculty supervision," Printup said.
"The faculty is supposed to be
doing the teaching — the faculty,
not the students."
Trotzky-Sirr explained that the

Committee for Undergraduate
Studies had initially planned to
begin an inquiry into reported
shortcomings of the program be
fore the end of this academic year,
but the scheduled meeting was
later called off.
Despite the cancellation, Print
up said that the matter would still
be investigated.
"The [committee] will be look
ing into the role of the faculty
being very heavily involved in the
teaching of these courses," Printup
said. "Students and parents are
not paying Stanford tuition to
have undergraduates teach them.

That would be considered a pretty
serious matter if that were the
case."
Until the program is actually re
viewed, Trotzky-Sirr discussed
some of the measures the program
is taking in the meantime to ensure
the its vitality.
"We're introducing a Web site
that will disseminate accurate in
formation to faculty and students
about the requirements of the pro
gram," Trotzky-Sirr said. "Also,
we're increasing training for
course leaders. Together, this will
ensure consistent quality control
for the program."
