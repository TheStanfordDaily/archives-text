"A detailed and decidedly
upbeat description of [world]
changes." (New York Times)
An enlightening evening with Benjamin Creme
More and more it becomes evident that a wiser voice is needed
in the world, one that will be listened to from many points of
view. Such a voice will soon be heard above the cries for revenge
and hate, says futurist Benjamin Creme. Maitreya, the World
Teacher - with his group of advanced spiritual teachers, the
Masters of Wisdom - is here to help humanity create a new
civilization in which the needs of all are met and the earth's
environment is restored.
