To
Kimberly "Z" McClelland
Stanford Class of 2002
Congratulations! !!
For all you've done in four short years;
For all the triumphs, trials and tears.
We've been 3,000 miles apart —
But never closer, heart to heart...
For all the class and grace you've shown,
For all you've helped—and all you've grown;
For all you did for Talisman —
The CD ("Passage"); the guiding hand...
One fact you've learned that's oh so true
Is "Things get better" when you do!
So when Life's curves are "something else"
Keep working harder on yourself...
Exploring where your passions lie,
You've honed your talents — "Do or Die!"
To have done less, a Cardinal sin —
Yes, Stanford tests what's deep within...
You've been our "Star" since you were born;
And Freshman year, two Stars were joined—
But now you'll go your separate ways
With lasting ties to bygone days.
So here's to Stanford grad, Miss "Z",
Whose best in life is yet to be!
As your fine Class receives its due,
We'll praise its awesome "Sister": YOU!
With so much Love, Joy, and Pride
