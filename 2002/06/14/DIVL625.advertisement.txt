The Annual
RED BARN Festival August 24th
When you think back on your days at Stanford, keep a little place in your heart
for the Red Barn, where it all started as the Palo Alto Stock Farm in 1876.
Long before Leland and Jane Stanford built the famed university, they bred world
champion trotters and race horses and Leland, Jr. rode his ponies and developed
his many talents.This beautiful, spacious campus wouldn't be here without
"The Farm" that became the treasured University we enjoy and benefit from today.
The Red Barn is also the home of the Stanford Equestrian Team.
If you're in the neighborhood on Saturday, August 24th, please join us for the
traditional Day On The Farm.There will be exciting equestrian events, pony
rides and a petting zoo for the kids, and snacks.
Open 10:30 am to s:oopm. San Mateo County Color Guard opening ceremony
at 11 AM. Ticket discount with ID card for University and Hospital students,
faculty and staff.
For more information on the Festival and evening barbeque,

From the sonnet and painting, "The Red Barn and Electioneer: Down History Lane" by Drue Kataoka (Stanford '00),
nationally-acclaimed Sumi-e artist. Commissioned by Bill Lane (Stanford '42)
