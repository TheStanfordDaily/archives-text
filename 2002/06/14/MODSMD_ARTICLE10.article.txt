### 
Sometimes graduating is hard. It
feels like getting kicked out of your
favorite place. I worry that I'm not
ready to leave this sun-sweet home
of infinite nurturing, where 1 have been
equally coddled and challenged.
Right now, I walk around campus and
know that everything is here for me. I can
wander into any building, enter my SUNet
11) on a computer, check my e-mail and take
advantage of free printing. 1 can talk to any
administrator and his job is taking care of
me. If I get stuck across campus at night, I
can call fora golf cart. Important people
give speeches on campus for me. The din
ing hall workers cut up watermelon and buy
skim milk for me. Gardeners mow and
prune for me. Professors are here to edify
me. The libraries are spacious and full of

slouchy nap-friendly chairs for me.
Soon this will not be true. Soon I will just
another alum, one of a zillion people who've
lived and loved and learned here. I will have
no claims to special significance. I will return
to campus as a visitor and roam through the
sandstone arches with the wide eyes of
someone who no longer belongs.
Sure, I'm looking forward to the cere
monies and a day celebrating my accom
plishments, such as they are. I'm even excit
ed about being an alum. I have a degree
from Stanford and no one can take it away.
It's a great thing I get to carry around for the
rest of my life.
But I still have moments where my heart
clutches with anticipation of loss. Gradua
tion marks the end of so much. This is it!
Time to go. 1 can only hope I loved my four

years enough.
I list my regrets: I never took social dance
or sailing. I never went to a basketball game.
I never went to Viennese Ball. I never lived
on the Row.
I list the goals I met: I made friends who
are hilarious and generous and true. I stud
ied Shakespeare's comedies in Oxford. 1
was a managing editor at The Daily. I
danced like a f<x)l to Backstreet Boys songs
at Chi Omega formals in San Francisco. I
spent spring break in Maui: snorkeling, sip
ping pineapple wine and singing with my
friends on a balcony overlooking the ocean.
I cheered at water polo, volleyball and foot
ball games. I was in an earthquake. I made
a snowman in Tahoe. I ran with the Band.
Memories keep circling around me. "Re
member when... ?" I ask my friends.

Remember that trip to Ireland where we
stayed in a series of hostile hostels, nearly got
blown off the Cliffs of Moher and tried to
keep warm huddling under hand dryers at
the Dublin airport?
Remember when we danced on the roof
of the Psychology Building, looking out at
the gilt-edged church guarded by palm
trees, the amber lights illuminating the
quad, the pale pink clouds, and faraway, the
gold sparkling of city lights?
Even the sill) things — especially the silly
things — make me wistful. Remember try
ing to move all our worldly possessions
across campus to Roble without a car? Re
member having our palms read on the
Fourth of July in Monterey?
My heart is breaking — because it's so
full.

At the beginning of spring quarter, I said
that Stanford gave me everything except
the ability to leave it. But now, after sorting
through my memories and testing their heft
and shape, I find 1 am strengthened. I find
that 1 am equipped to move forward.
It is precisely because I have been so nur
tured at Stanford that I can leave. I am
wealthy in knowledge acquired in class
rooms and in dorm hallways. I am warmed
by close friendships. 1 am buoyant with con
fidence. I walk with gratitude for the past
and eagerness for the future. I am ready for
the next great thing.

Marisa Pavlik is graduating with a degree in
English with a creative writing emphasis. To her
family and friends: 7 ran no other answer make
but thanks. And thanks. And ever thanks."
