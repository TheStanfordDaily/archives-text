A small part of me feels proud to
hear North Korea named as
part of the "axis of evil." Since
my parents were born in a
Korea once unified, I feel that I could be
evil too. I aim to pledge allegiance to the
army of darkness, since otherwise 1
would by default support President
George W. Bush and National Security
Advisor Condoleezza Rice.
As my senior year comes to a close I've
heard many heated debates about the ap
propriateness of Rice as our speaker. To
be honest I didn't give a rat's ass, as most
of you seniors out there feel. As long as it
was not Carly Fiorina, I figured I would be

sitting pretty in the andience, clapping
after whomever spoke — may it be
Salmon Rushdie or Jesse Jackson.
A group of Iranian students changed
my mind the other night. I learned for the
first time how hard it is to he a student
from Iran. To visit their homes, they have
had to apply for exit visas in Mexico. Oth
erwise students traveling to Iran without a
re-entry visa would risk not being able to
come back to the United States.
Due to a new legislation which recently
became law, these same students must
apply for visas back in their homeland.
Wary that visas will be too difficult to ob
tain, students are afraid to travel abroad

and are essentially trapped in the U.S. un
able to go home in case a family emer
gency arises.
How do we blame the problem of na
tional security on these students who al
ready risk their education in order to see
their families at home during summer va
cation? In Thursday's New York limes,
an article describes the desperation of
North Koreans with their mad dashes to
China, hoping to jump the fences of em
bassies, which are now lined with barbed
wire. As minions of the North Korean
"devil incarnate," if any of these souls
reach U.S. shores, even these refugees are
part of the threat to our homeland de

tense.
Now policy is hoping to fingerprint all
visitors from the Middle East. Very fitting,
considering the fact that two recent terror
ist suspects carried European passports.
After years of historical boo-boos, in
which Americans have searched fora racial
scapegoat, I would have hoped fora coun
try wiser and more just. Logically I guess
the "axis of evil" makes sense since every
other minority — from the Irish, Jewish,
Italians, African-Americans, Japanese, to
the Mexicans have been pinpointed as "the
problem" at one point or another.
Nevertheless I fully support Rice as the
speaker for my commencement. I can

think of few who are more relevant today.
Though she is Republican and stands for
many issues that I personally detest, I
know that her political views shape presi
dential policy, and that her work will im
pact our generation of college graduates.
At the same time I plan to proudly carry
a North Korean flag into the ceremony as
declaration to my joining forces with the
dark side. Perhaps I will be able to convince
my friends to carry the flags of the other
three countries that are part of the "axis."

Joy Lee will be graduating with a degree in psy
chology ami comparative studies in race and eth
nicity.
