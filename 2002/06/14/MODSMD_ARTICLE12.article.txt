I wrote a poem today. Two years ago,
at a dorm boat dance, as I was stand
ing on deck while going under the
Golden Gate Bridge, I couldn't but
notice the majesty, the beauty and ele
gance of this most famous San Francisco
monument, even as I was hearing the hip
hop rhythms from the deck below. I was
mesmerized by the moment, and I told
myself that I would write a poem about it
when I got home. Well, two years later, I fi
nally found the time to do it.
That kind of sums up how I feel some
times about my experiences I've had at
Stanford. There's been so much to do,
and so little time to do it. There are, ad
mittedly, several uniquely Stanford ex
periences that I have missed out on in my

years here, mostly because I was too
busy. I've (gasp!!!) never gone fountain
hopping or steam-tunneling. I haven't
had the chance to take Sleep and
Dreams. And I've never lived in a Row
house or studied abroad.
What in the world was I doing in
stead? Well, there were the evenings
working on problem sets until the wee
hours of the morning. There were the
all-nighters that I've pulled getting some
lab project finished. I will always remem
ber walking into Packard seeing the bril
liant sun about to set on a beautiful clay,
and walking back out into the cold, quiet
and dark night way past midnight.
But as I was finishing up the poem
today, 1 thought about it some more, and

realized how precious my time at Stan
ford has been. Some say that as one ages,
life becomes a series of snapshots. Well,
all in all, my snapshots here have actual
ly been pretty good.
1 can still vividly recall stumbling across
the Lagunita lawn during freshman orien
tation and getting welcomed by yelling,
excited resident assistants. Remember the
first Flicks you went to, with the Band and
the paper fights? How about the time you
rode your bike across the Main Quad on
your way to class, seeing the beauty of
Memorial Church and remarking silently
what a beautiful sunny day it was? Anyone
remember spending their twenty-first
birthday with close friends?
For another thing, other people hold

their dances at hotel ballrooms. We held
our senior formal among the fish, at
Monterey Bay Aquarium.
Yes, I will miss this place when I leave,
even the long nights doing work. Form
ing bonds with the people you're work
ing with in lab and on problem sets,
learning about how computers really tick
on the inside, taking pride in finishing a
project and showing it to other people,
these things I will miss long after I leave.
And, I'll always reminisce about the ex
tracurricular activities that I involved my
self with and the great people who I met
and worked with. I've produced dorm
yearbooks and organized dorm budgets,
edited a newspaper and helped organize
BASES E-Challenge, the premier business

plan competition in the United States.
That's what life at Stanford was all
about. That's why I had to wait until
today to write my poem, 112 was too busy
until now, but busy in good. And, in
deed, I did finally find the time to get the
poem finished, putting that snapshot of
the Golden Gate Bridge that's been in
delibly etched in my mind into words.
Regrets? What's there to regret? It's def
initely been time well-spent.
