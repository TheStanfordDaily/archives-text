Approaching Stanford four years
ago, I got the following sound
piece of advice: Do not let acade
mics take any more than 50 per
cent ofyour time while in college. Devote the
rest to other, equally essential things.
I took this advice to heart. As my four
years on the Farm are drawing to an end,
I can't help but ask myself: did I do right?
Maybe 1 missed out on some opportu
nities that I never again will have. It's in
evitable. Four years is not nearly enough
time to do everything if you're at a place
like Stanford. It's like a game of Taboo,
but instead of trying to guess as many
words as you can in one minute, you
have to do as many things as you can in
four years. And one of the best things

about this place is the variety of things
you can choose to do with your time.
112 don't know how wise my choices were.
What I do know is that years from now, I can
look back into the attics of my life and have
the satisfaction of having lived my four years
on the Farm up to the fullest.
I never made it to the renowned Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center; instead,
I hiked up the Foothills to watch the me
teor shower in the night sky.
I slept through many a morning lec
ture, but I stayed up all night having
heated dorm discussions on topics as di
verse as global citizenship and anti-intel
lectualism in rap culture.
I skipped through numerous pages of
international political theory, but I sim

ply devoured the books on global con
flicts I borrowed from my friends.
1 didn't play intramural sports, but 1
was a two-meter defender on the Oxford
water polo team while 1 was overseas.
I never took a communication class,
but I attended an Academy Awards party
with a Stanford friend who was interning
at Entertainment Weekly in Los Angeles.
My European friends will turn green
with jealousy when I show them the pic
ture 1 have with David Hasselhoff.
I didn't take the "World Food Econo
my" class, but I learned how to cook Bul
garian shopska salad for 50 of my co-op
housemates.
I turned a few papers in late, but I
never missed a deadline on an article for

The Daily either as a water polo and swim
team reporter or as a features editor.
I didn't major in mechanical engi
neering, but I helped a friend hold his
car together with Epoxy and duct tape
after getting into a wreck when we went
surfing in Santa Cruz.
I didnft score perfectly on the LSAT, but
when my LSAT prep class refused to deliv
er on their promised services, I spearhead
ed the class protest and eventually forced
the company to change its practices.
I didn't climb the mountains in
Yosemite, but I jumped into the 50-degree
Kings River, along with my raft-mates, dur
ing my house's white-water rafting trip.
I didn't get multiple degrees, but I ac
quired an illuminating education in in

ternational relations and, even more im
portantly, a wealth of friendships along
the way.
And when I'm 64, I'll stumble upon that
old, wrinkled, yellowed list a friend of mine
and I made. It was a list of the things we
wanted to do and the places we wanted to
see. Like visiting the famous Bodleian li
brary in Oxford. Or fountain-hopping. I
might not remember if I made it to all the
places on that list. But I will remember how
we laughed and fretted and learned and
dreamed. And I'll smile. For the good times.
