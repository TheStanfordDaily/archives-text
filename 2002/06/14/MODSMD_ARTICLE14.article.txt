Once, I drafted a speech fora
junior official at the White
House in which I wrote about
"the wisdom of the Franklin
Mountains" in El Paso, Texas. The offi
cial did not understand how mountains
could be wise. I told her it was a
metaphor. In that same vein, we might
consult the oldest and, therefore, wisest
things at Stanford—buildings, institu
tions, and sculptures—for sage advice
upon graduation. Here's what the build
ings might say.
Hoover Tower: "You are a rising
star." Herbert Hoover rose from humble
beginnings as an orphan to the presi
dency of the United States. In 1891, he
failed entrance exams to Stanford Uni
versity, but he was admitted on the con
dition that he enroll in summer school,
retake his exams and improve his writing
abilities. At Stanford, he managed the
varsity football team (there's a picture of
him and the team above the first seating
booth in the Treehouse), worked hard
and met the requirements for gradua
tion. He donated materials on war and
peace held in Hoover Tower, and he
helped establish the Graduate School of
Business. The lesson: Graduation is the
beginning of your rising trajectory!
Meyer Library: "Be ready to adapt." A
couple years ago, this library actually
held books as well as comfortable places

for studying. It has been gutted of its
books and shelves and transformed into
a computer facility. The post-graduation
lesson: Be ready to accommodate new
ideas and people into the personal, acad
emic and professional framework that
you've developed at the University.
The Pedestal of the Thinker: "Step up
for leadership." Good ideas travel fast.
In fact, they travel so fast that the
Thinker has spent the entire year in Aus
tralia and Southeast Asia ("Thinker Pon
dering a life down under," The Stanford
Daily, Nov. 12, 2001). His pedestal has
been empty. Meanwhile, the space has
been filled by students, chairs, grocery
carts and orange cones. Lesson: Don't be
afraid to step into leadership when you
see an empty pedestal. It's an invitation.
David Packard Electrical Engineering
Building: "Take risks." After graduating
from Stanford, David Packard worked
r >r General Electric for two years in Sch
enectady, N.Y., returned to Palo Alto
and started a company in 1939 with his
friend and former classmate William
Hewlett. Their first "plant" was a small
garage in Palo Alto. They had $538 in
capital but produced an audio oscillator
based on Hewlett's design from graduate
school. Take-home lesson: Run with
your own ideas. It's more fun (and po
tentially more lucrative) than being a cog
in someone else's machine.

The Dish: "Enjoy the simple plea
sures." The walk to the satellite dish in
the Foothills behind campus is serene,
beautiful and refreshing. The small
things in life, such as enjoying a meal or
taking a walk, will bring a lifetime of sat
isfaction. Post-grad lesson: Enjoy the
simple pleasures.
Palm Drive Entrance Gate: "Don't be
arrogant." The noble gate at the inter
section of Palm Drive and El Camino
Real bespeaks strength, dignity and
pride, but it crumbled into a pile of rub
ble during the earthquake of 1906. Les
son: Don't be arrogant. Haughty pride
rests on a shallow foundation, and it will
be easily destroyed.
Lake Lagunita: "Be ready for para
dox." Things aren't always what they
seem. First of all, the name of this spot is a
misnomer because "lagunita" means "little
lagoon" in Spanish. The name Lake Lagu
nita is as repetitive as calling your mother
"Mom Mama." It's a double whammy.
Second, there is no water in Lake Laguni
ta. It is bone dry. Pictures from the last
century show students boating and sailing
at Lake Lagunita. Not this year. It's as bar
ren as Rachel's womb. Post-graduate les
son: Be ready for paradox.
The Stanford Daily: "Read your local
paper." The world is bigger than your
job. Reading the local newspaper will
Help you understand the community. In

addition, your local paper will tell you
about activities, fun events and impor
tant developments affecting you. Post
graduate lesson: Stay informed!
Cantor Art Museum: "Take a break
for culture." The Cantor Art Museum
holds a little bit of everything including
ancient Greco-Roman artifacts and mod
ern art. It has a great cafe, too, for taking
it easy. It's an oasis of culture, in the mid
dle of Silicon Valley, that broadens our
outlook with reminders of past times and
places. Take-home lesson: Make time for
culture in your life.
Memorial Church: "Have a little
faith." Jane Stanford wanted this church
to be the centerpiece of the University.
The original church had a steeple that
was twice the height of today's roof. The
original facade said, "Erected to the
Glory of God and in Loving Memory of
My Husband Leland Stanford." It was
rebuilt after Jane Stanford's death and
the 1906 earthquake without those criti
cal words of endearment. Nevertheless,
Jane Stanford's values are carved into
the interior walls of the church. One ex
ample: " The greatest of all safeguards,
and the most encouraging of all stimulat
ing influences to a noble life — that is,
the power of personal religion." Post
grad lesson: A little faith will help you ac
complish great things.
Roble Gym: "Have a balanced life."

Roble Gym sits near academic buildings,
Tresidder Union and the offices of The
Stanford Daily. It's home to many athlet
ic offices, courses and lockers. Lesson:
Don't forget to take care of your body
and have a little fun while you're in the
working world.
Frances C. Arrillaga Alumni Center:
"Give something back." The University's
main connection to you after graduation
will be asking for money. However,
there are other ways to give something
back. You can organize internships for
undergraduate students or mentor them
to the next level. Post-grad lesson: Re
member where you came from because it
will be a source of strength for you and
your alma mater.
Individual students will have person
al memories of their time at Stanford,
but our collective memory will dwell in
the buildings, institutions, and sculp
tures which—with the possible exception
of Rodin's Thinker—will be here fora
long time to come. This collective mem
ory should be shared with our visiting
friends and family. Above all, it should
speak to our lives after graduation.
