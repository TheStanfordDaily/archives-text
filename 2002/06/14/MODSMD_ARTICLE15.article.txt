# Students fight for wage hike
## 
### ALI ALEMOZAFAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
More than 50 Stanford students
camped out in the Main Quad last
night and Monday night, calling on
the University's administration to
"wake up" and make changes to in
crease the wages and benefits Bon
Appetit employees receive.
Several tents and a backdrop of
signs stood out in front of Universi
ty President John Hennessy's
Building 10 office. The protest was
spearheaded by the Coalition for
Labor Justice, a group partly com
posed of the Stanford's chapter of
the National Association for the Ad
vancement of Colored People and
the Stanford Community for Peace
and Justice.
"[I have] friends who are in [the
Stanford Labor Action Coalition]
and I think it's a great cause," said
junior Luna Federici.
Prepared with books and blan
kets, students say they will sleep in
the Quad until the University takes
notice.
Junior Meghana Reddy, the co
coordinator of the coalition, told
Dean of Students Marc Wais on
Monday that students would stay in
the Quad "as long as the workers
want us out here."
Today at noon, Bon Appetit

workers will also stage their own
protest starting at Tresidder Union
and walking to the Quad.
The protest took place amid ne
gotiations between Bon Appetit
workers and company manage
ment, in light of the looming May
31 expiration of their current con
tract. Both students and workers
are demanding that the University
set a baseline for the wages and ben
efits that all subcontracted and di
rectly hired dining workers receive.
"Hennessy said earlier this year
the he cares about every single
worker on the Stanford campus,"
said Jeramie Scott, who works with
the Stanford chapter of the
NAACP. "We are here to get Hen
nessy to take concrete action to
show he really is committed to the
well-being of all Stanford workers."
Bon Appetit, a Stanford sub
contractor, is not obligated to offer
its employees the same wages and
benefits given to directly hired
workers for Dining Services. The
starting wage for Bon Appetit
workers at Tresidder Union and
the Graduate School of Business is
$8.50 an hour with benefits less
than those of directly hired Stan
ford workers, who make a mini
mum of $ 10.10 an hour, according
to organizers.
"Very depressing," said one

Bon Appetit worker who asked to
remain anonymous. "Just because
it's the same work and there are
some workers that are getting paid
less."
Freshman Anna Mumford, an
event organizer, said, "We're out
here to ask Hennessy to give equal
pay to all workers. The University
is concerned about this but they
don't really know what to do."
Wages and benefits for subcon
tracted campus workers is an ongo
ing issue on campus. A protest last
fall sought to address wages for
some janitors at Stanford Hospital,
who were also subcontracted by the
University.
"[The University doesn't] have
this official policy that will eliminate
this problem," sophomore lan Slat
tery said. "They just [have to] stop
brushing the students off and start
working with them."
According to protest organizers,
Bon Appetit workers are an exam
ple of the way subcontracting has
been used to undercut wages of
Stanford workers. Subcontracting
to unionized workers eludes Hen
nessy's living wage policy, which es
tablished a minimum wage ot
$10.10 an hour with benefits of
$11.35 an hour without, organizers
said.
Worker and student protests

last winter led Harvard University
President Larry Summers to an
nounce a new campus labor policy
calling for parity in wages and ben
efits between directly hired and
subcontracted workers. The out
come of events at Harvard shows
that Stanford can have a direct im

pact on labor standards, protest or
ganizers said.
"We're here telling Hennessy
that fair wages needs to be a priori
ty when he writes the budget," said
freshman Kelly Wells.
"[There is] a level of apathy on
campus," junior Katrina Logan

said. "People don't care."
Logan's "equal pay for equal
work" button summed up the pro
testor's objectives: a normalization
of the wages and benefits of all sub
contracted and directly hired cam
pus workers.
