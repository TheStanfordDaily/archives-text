## 
### ELIZABETH MADJILESSI STAFF WRITER 
A crowd of close to 400 people
gathered in Memorial Church yes
terday afternoon to listen to trib
utes, prayers and music in remem
brance of Wall Street Journal re
porter Daniel Pearl, who received
a bachelor's in communications
from Stanford in 1985.
Pearl was researching a story
for The Journal in Karachi, Pak
istan when a group of extremists
kidnapped him. The State De
partment confirmed bis death
Thursday.
"He was abducted and mur
dered because he was an Ameri
can, a journalist and a Jew," said
Rabbi Patricia Karlin-Neumann,
associate dean for religious life.
The memorial focused on Pearl
as a person and the way he
touched the lives of the those with
whom he came into contact.
Several speakers, including his
former professors and classmates,
spoke fondly of Pearl's influence
on their lives.
"The horror of Danny's death
can easily overshadow the
grandeur of his life," Karlin-Neu
mann said. "He conveyed his love
to his family and friends through
his humanity and zest for life."
University President John Hen
nessy, who attended, was like most
of the audience in that he did not
know Pearl personally.
Hennessy came to t he event "to
honor [Pearl]," he said.
"Danny was extraordinary,"
Hennessy said. "A decent man
who was loved by all those who

knew him. He was part of the spe
cial extended family, embodying
the spirit of the Stanford family
with a passion for truth and un
derstanding."
To commemorate Pearl's life,
the Communication Department
at Stanford will begin an endow
ment for undergraduates in
Pearl's name.
"I came this afternoon because
I felt it was important to support
the work of journalists who are
abroad right now, especially a
Stanford graduate who has
brought so much honor to this in
stitution," sophomore Katy Quar
les said. "Even though 1 did not
know him, I truly sympathize with
his wife and unborn child. It's not

fair that this has happened to
them."
Many of the tributes focused on
the role of the journalist in general
and how Pearl's commitment to
his field reflected his dedication to
understanding people's differ
ences.
Pearl "did what he wanted to do,
what he loved," said Craig Sher
man, a member of the class of 1985.
"Reporters suppress the urge to
let anger affect their work," said
Knight Fellow James Areddy.
"[His captors] did not recognize
Danny as their ally. Good re
porters everywhere wake up pur
suing truth.
"What disgusts me is those who
killed Danny Pearl cut out their

own tongues," Areddy said. "He
was their best opportunity to be
come understood. Regardless of
his personal sentiments, he could
have shown their humanity."
Ty Kim, class of 1986, knew
Pearl and reflected on his passing.
"Many will miss him," Kim said.
"World news is reserved for the
very best [reporters], and that is ex
actly what Danny is, the very best."
Between choked sobs, his
friend Karen Edwards, class of
1985, remembered Pearl's fond
ness for Kurt Vonnegut and reg
gae music.
"I truly would like to believe
that in the countless hours he was
held captive, he achieved a state of
grace," Edwards said.
His former professors also con
tributed their memories of Pearl's
presence on campus.
"Danny was a standout â€” very
smart, his wit was quick, but he
wasn't cynical or ironic," Com
munications Prof. Henry Bre
itrose said. "Journalism is a pro
fession that serves others; they
follow a story to help us know
things others would have wanted
to conceal. They don't work for
their publishers; they work for us,
the people."
Marion Lewenstein, professor
emeritus of communications,
echoed these sentiments.
"Danny was quiet, gentle and
earnest," Lewenstein said. "He
turned in beautifully researched
papers that reflected an unexpect
ed perspective because he had
such depth and liked to explore
the material."
