# Murals unveiled at Tresidder Union

### JOHN HUETTER EDITORIAL STAFF 
Despite hosting hoards of
temporary exhibits, the closest
thing to a permanent art display
at Tresidder Union in the past
was either the downstairs bul
letin board or the movie posters
in the Stanford Store window.
That all changed last Friday
when representatives from the
ASSU and Student Organizing
Committee for the Arts official
ly unveiled a new, student and
community created mural in
the upstairs lobby of Tresidder.
"In the 20 years I've been
here, this is the first student
mural," said Jeanette Smith-
Laws, director of Meeting Ser
vices. "It's going to look great."
"We've been working [on the
mural] since the beginning of
last quarter," said Karen Larter,
one of the leaders of the project.
The mural consists of 12
panels arranged in six stag
gered columns suspended from
the ceiling. A painting of a bar
ren tree extends throughout
the panels to form the back
ground, and tiny, individually
decorated panels are glued
over it.
"They were all given a color
palette and an overall design
[and told to] go with it," said se
nior Seth Cohen, SOCA founder
and outgoing president.

"We said, 'Do whatever you
want [with the tiles],"' said Eto
Qtitigbe, a second year master's
student in product design and
one of the project leaders.
"[ The mural is] the chance
for the mural assistants to define
what Stanford is for them," Otit
igbe agreed.
"We wanted a symbol that
wasn't too complex, but it kind
of represented the school,"
said sophomore Andi Hansen,
who was one of the mural's as
sistant artists.
"It should reflect that it sits in
the student union," Cohen said.
The four leading artists —
graduate students Otitigbe,
Larter, and Daniel Lee, and un
dergraduate Bly Pope — and
about 15 assistants divided up
the panels and decorated them
however they wished to a gener
al theme of "Stanford life."
"We each did 30 to 50 tiles, I
think," Hansen recalled.
Other students were given a
shot at decorating tiles, and
muralists took some of the tiles
out to the Stanford Communi
ty Day to have attending com
munity members, particularly
children, decorate a few tiles on
what Stanford means to them.
"It's all different artists," Otit
igbe said. "There are over 100
different people on
this . . . Stanford students, little
kids, old people."
