# Sex columnist Roxy Sass says good night
## 
### 
Editor's Note: For many years, the
proud mantle of Roxy Sass has passed
Jrom one student to another, equally
denoted to bringing the best darned sex
column possible to the Stanford com
munity. The time has come again to
bow our heads in silent memory as the
latest incarnation of Roxy graduates.
Without further adieu, we present her
final column from May 31, 2002.
Dearest Stanfordians,
The perfect date . . . ah, the
eternal search for the impossible.
Since the rest of the issue is dedi
cated to what to do on the perfect
date, let's talk about the person,
that very special Dudley-Do-
Right of Dating, and how to find
him or her. Of course, in Roxy's
opinion, the perfect date is one
who pays for dinner and doesn't
boot in your hair, but my editors
claimed that wouldn't be enough

fora column.
So how to find that perfect
date? II it's maturity you want,
look no further than your near
est classroom. No, not your fel
low students. Roxy implores you
to give a second, and perhaps
third glance at your teaching as
sistants. Roxy has received hun
dreds, yes, hundreds of emails
about the hot TAs of, say,
Bioethics, CS377A and Science
and Religion. Okay, maybe not
hundreds, but somewhere
around 20. Okay, that's even
stretching it. Actually Roxy just
heard the TAs talking about how
hot they were in the Coffee
House one night. But they are
tasty little vittles, and quite rep
resentative of the TA population
campus wide.
First, all of the conventional
wisdom says to wait until you've
finished their class. That's a

bunch of hooey. If you're already
out of their class, how will going
out with you TA help your GPA?
On the other hand, if you gener
ally make an ass of yourself and /
or don't plan to put out, perhaps
waiting a quarter isn't such a bad
idea.
But how does one go about ac
quiring a date with these perfect
dates? This can be a delicate
proposition. They are skittish
creatures â€” you must approach
them adroitly. The best way to do
this is by dropping hints in your
papers or problem sets; if it's a CS
class, maybe you'll want to com
ment it out. Of course, many of
you are skeptical. Roxy's sugges
tion may sound ill advised, but it
actually kills two birds with one
stone. Many of us wonder
whether the TAs actually read our
papers anyway, so drop a subtle
hint such as:

Robert Beezer, one of the dissent
ing judges, wrote about reexam
ining 'the historic presumption
that all human lives are equally
and intrinsically valuable' and
you, [insert TA name here], are
equally and intrinsically hot.
This can answer once and for
all whether the grades we get are
based on the work we do. ft is pos
sible that this is not a question any
of us want answered, so keep your
findings to yourself.
If these sort of hints are too
subtle for the elevated TA mind,
you may have to resort to office
hours, where you come bearing
some variety of soy concoction
(with advanced age comes con
cern for the environment) and
wearing something tastefully re
vealing but, more importantly,
made chiefly of natural fibers.
Read up on current events, be

prepared to discuss deep philo
sophical issues and allow your
well-worn copy of Niet/.sche's
"Jenseits von Gut und Bose" (ob
viously the German version) to
"accidentally" fall from your back
pack. but then quickly, modestly,
put it away.
If they don't drop what
they're doing, swipe everything

off their desk, and bend you over
it, you missed a step somewhere.
Maybe try something by Heideg
ger instead.
Smooches to you all,
Roxy
