Think you know about music, kidt You don't
know about music. Think you know about life?
Ha! You don'/ know about life, little child. Let us
school you in two musical genres you may know
little about. Then, and only then, will you be
ready to go out and kick ass.
PUNK
What is punk? Damned if I know. Some
facts: punk started sometime in mid-'7os
New York, was based largely on quick
three-chord songs, spread like a wildfire
and disappeared as a coherent movement
—if it ever was one —in the early '80s.
But rumors of punk's death have been
greatly exaggerated: although they may
not resemble the original CBGB badasses,
important, dynamic "punk" bands keep
popping up.
The best punk is angry, sneering and
loud, a venomous "go away!" to the rest of
(be world. Here's a purely personal top
three punk album list:

The Sex Pistols, "Never Mind the Bol
locks, Here's the Sex Pistols" — For all
their catchiness, punk's greatest anthems
"Anarchy in the U.K." and "God Save the
Queen" are filled with a desperate, right
eous anger. Lead singer Johnny Rotten
famously proclaimed, "You don't sing
about love to people on the dole," and he
doesn't take grief from anyone here. On
"Bodies," Rotten shrieks, "Screaming .. .
bloody mess!" which describes the Sex
Pistols pretty accurately. They rocked like
no one else.
Sleater-Kinney, "Dig Me Out" — On
this album, post-riot girl trio Sleater-Kin
ney constructed a perfectly punk tribute to
punk music. Every track is a gem, from the
mournful longing of "One More Hour" to
the relentless "Not What You Want," but
the real standouts are the songs about
songs: "Dance Song 97" 's delirious ur
gency is contagious, and when Corin
Tucker wails "Turn turn it up!" on "Words
+ Guitar," I invariably do exactly that.

The Clash, "London Calling" — With
its third album, the Clash decided to take
on the world in a diverse array of tunes,
ranging from the reggae-tinged "Revolu
tion Rock" to the old-school rock 'n' roll of
"Brand New Cadillac." The album's finest
moment is "Death or Glory," a critique of
idealism.

CONSCIOUS HIP HOP
In the past decade, hip hop has become
commercially viable mainstream enter
tainment. However, though popular
artists like Jay-Z and Snoop Dogg domi
nate the popular radar, hip hop will always
have its roots in the underground and in a
socially conscious attitude. Conscious hip
hop is a genre of music devoted to ad
dressing and questioning social and cul
tural problems, whether they be racism or
corporate influence in everyday life. Three

albums to check out:
Public Enemy, "It Takes a Nation of
Millions to Hold Us Back" — Public
Enemy is really where conscious hip hop
begins. Rapper and lyricist Chuck I) pas
sionately decries the venomous racism he
sees all around him. This is an abrasive,
urgent record. A year alter this album was
released in 1988, Public Enemy provided
the theme song to Spike Lee's seminal
film, "Do The Right Thing."
Spearhead, "Chocolate Supa High
way" — People may debate about exactly
where San Franciscan Michael Franti and
his group Spearhead lit into the hip hop
community. One thing that is not in ques
tion, however, is that Spearhead is terrifi
cally innovative, steadily emerging as a
voice against social in justice. Released after
the Oklahoma City bombing, "Chocolate
Supa Highway" features Franti standing
against popular bigotry, "1 remember the
time in Oklahoma / You tried to blame an

Arab / But whitey was the bomber." Even
when he's not being so serious, his message
still stings.
A Tribe Called Quest, "Midnight Ma
rauders" — Q-Tip, Phife and Ali Shaheed
Muhammad formed one of the most in
fluential hip hop groups of all time. At
times, A Tribe Called Quest could be
somewhat immature. Take for instance,
one of Phife's verbal odes to women: "1
like 'em black, yellow, Puerto Rican and
Haitian." At other times, though, the
group made astute social observations. On
"Sucka Nigga," Q-Tip meditates on the
historical use of the word "nigger" both in
popular culture and among the African-
American community. His concludes that
using the word as a term of endearment
can be a way to deal with the prejudices
still present in society.

film, "Do The Right Thing."
Spearhead, "Chocolate Supa High
way" — People may debate about exactly
where San Franciscan Michael Franti and
his group Spearhead lit into the hip hop
community. One thing that is not in ques
tion, however, is that Spearhead is terrifi
cally innovative, steadily emerging as a
voice against social in justice. Released after
the Oklahoma City bombing, "Chocolate
Supa Highway" features Franti standing
against popular bigotry, "1 remember the
time in Oklahoma / You tried to blame an

Arab / But whitey was the bomber." Even
when he's not being so serious, his message
still stings.
A Tribe Called Quest, "Midnight Ma
rauders" — Q-Tip, Phife and Ali Shaheed
Muhammad formed one of the most in
fluential hip hop groups of all time. At
times, A Tribe Called Quest could be
somewhat immature. Take for instance,
one of Phife's verbal odes to women: "1
like 'em black, yellow, Puerto Rican and
Haitian." At other times, though, the
group made astute social observations. On
"Sucka Nigga," Q-Tip meditates on the
historical use of the word "nigger" both in
popular culture and among the African-
American community. His concludes that
using the word as a term of endearment
can be a way to deal with the prejudices
still present in society.
