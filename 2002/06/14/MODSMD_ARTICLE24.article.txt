## Cardinal heads to Omaha after Super Regional sweep Stanford beats USC twice behind pitching of Guthrie and Cunningham 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford seniors, pack your bags.
Again.
The Cardinal senior class will make its
fourth straight visit to the College World
Series in Omaha, Neb. after sweeping the
Southern California Trojans this weekend
at Sunken Diamond.
Stanford (45-1(5) beat the Trojans (37-
24) for the seventh time in eight meetings
between the teams this season, winning
Friday night's Super Regional opener, 4-
2, and taking the Saturday matinee, 5-3, to
clinch its 14th College World Series ap
pearance in school history.
"I'm very proud of our seniors — four
straight years at the College World Series,

that says something about their class and
what they've meant to Stanford baseball,"
said a tired but excited Cardinal head
coach Mark Marquess. "1 can't say enough
about them. They didn't come in as stars
and a lot oft! m had to wait a year or two
to get to play, and when they got their
chance they've led by example on the
field."
They may not have entered as stars, but
they certainly finished their Sunken Dia
mond careers that way on Saturday.
First, senior Scott Dragicevich came to
the plate in the sixth inning with Stanford
trailing, 2-1. He lined a clutch two-Rlil
single to right field with two outs, giving
the Cardinal its first lead of the game and
starting a four-run rally that followed two
USC errors.
Stanford wouldn't look back, thanks to
the performance of another senior, reliev
er Dan Rich. Rich threw 1 1/3 innings of
one-hit ball to close down his second game
of the weekend, sending the Cardinal to
Omaha by snagging a ground ball back to

the box and running all the way to first for
the unassisted putout.
"I think we were all a little nervous in
the preseason when our media guide
came out and it said 'Heading for Home'
with a picture of Omaha on the front,"
Dragicevich admitted after his 4-for-4 af
ternoon. "It made vis all nervous, but we
had our eyes on that goal the whole time.
Senior leadership is a huge part of this
team as you saw today, so it's a thrill for
us."
Both Dragicevich's and Rich's contri
butions in Saturday's Super Regional
match-up with the Trojans were espe
cially sweet. Dragicevich re-entered the
Cardinal lineup in May after a mid-sea
son stretch that saw his average drop to
.308. Marquess inserted him at third
base, rather than his traditional short
stop position, and moved "senior Andy
Topham to short — a move that's
worked to perfection.
Dragicevich raised his average to .367,
good enough for second on the team in
batting, and played what Marquess called
major-league quality defense in a surprise
all-senior infield of Dragicevich, Topham,
Chris O'Riordan and first baseman Arik
VanZandt.
A grateful O'Riordan went hitless in his
final home game, getting plunked on the
helmet in his last plate appearance at
Sunken Diamond. Maybe not the perfect
way to say goodbye, but after Saturday's
win, he'll take it.
"One thing we kept telling each other
throughout the year is to realize how hard
it is to get to Omaha, and how many things
have to go right," O'Riordan said. "We've
had a lot go right for us in these last few
years, and at the same time we've had
some unbelievably clutch performances
from some great players. It should be fun,
especially going with these six seniors. It's
like we've grown up together."
'Hie Cardinal fell behind early on Sat
urday as junior starter Tim Cunningham
walked two Trojans and hit one to load the
bases in the bottom of the second. He re
covered and escaped down just 1-0 after a
sacrifice fly and a groundout, settling
down to finish with 5 2/3 innings of two

run, four-hit baseball and improving to
10-2 this season, and 21-4 all-time.
Sophomore Carlos Quentin drove
home a run in the third with a two-out
double but made a poor base running mis
take that ended the inning and left the
game tied at one apiece.
The Trojans answered with one run in
the fifth before Stanford broke out in the
following inning. Stanford has scored
more runs in the sixth this season than any
other inning, this time putting up four
runs in the frame on run-scoring hits by
Dragicevich, sophomore'outfielder Brian
Hall and Topham.
Dragicevich credited the Cardinal pen
chant for scoring in the sixth frame to Tro
jan fatigue as well as to smart adjustments
by Stanford hitters the third time through
the order.
"I think it's a mixture of things," he
said. "It's just a matter of making adjust
ments and figuring out what the pitcher's
doing. [Saturday, USC starter Cory] Cam
pos was trying to get us out away, and I

think we made an adjustment to move up
on the plate a little bit and take away that
changeup that he was throwing down and
away."
(JSC picked up a single run in the sev
enth to cut the Stanford lead to 5-3 in the
late innings, but junior Ryan McCally
didn't allow a run in two innings of solid
relief before handing the ball to Rich, who.
closed out the game in style.
Friday night the Cardinal looked to
their ace, junior Jeremy Guthrie, to shut
down the Trojans and put Stanford just
one win away from Omaha.
Guthrie, the 22nd overall pick in Tues
day's Major League Baseball draft, re
sponded as usual in the Cardinal's 4-2 vic
tory. He dominated USC batters for eight
innings, scattering four hits and allowing
two runs before making way for Rich, who
picked up the first of two saves on the
weekend.
Aside from an eighth inning that saw a
