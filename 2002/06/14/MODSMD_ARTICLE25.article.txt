No respect? Not anymore.
Ever since a loss to No. 3 Georgia
(26-2) on Feb. 9 dropped it from the
top spot in the rankings, the No. 2
Stanford women's tennis team (27-
1) has been determined to prove
who the best team in the country re
ally was. 1 -ast night at the Taube
Tennis Center, the Cardinal did just
that, defeating top-ranked Florida

(24-2), 4-1, to claim its second
straight NCAA Championship.
"To end it on the home courts, in
front of people who have been sup
porting us for four years, is an in
credible feeling," senior Lauren
Kalvaria said.
After freshman Erin Burdette's
backhand winner skipped past
Alexis Gordon, the Cardinal players
piled on top of each other in the
middle of the court in celebration.
Once they disentangled themselves,

they all donned T-shirts that read
"Stanford 2002 NCAA Champions"
on the front and "No Respect" on
the back.
"We were ranked as low as sixth,
and that's ridiculous," Kalvaria said.
The Cardinal is number one
now, though.
".All the hard work this season
has paid off," Burdette said.
Stanford accomplished its goal,
and now the team can sit back and
relish what it has accomplished.
"It was an unbelievable season,"
head coach Lele Forood said. "Our
team really worked hard."
The championship match was
no exception, lasting four hours
after rain delayed the start for three
hours. From the beginning, Florida
made it clear that it was not going to
go quietly.
In doubles, Florida's Alexis Gor
don and Julia Scaringe knocked off
Stanford's No. 14 duo of sopho
more Lauren Barnikow and fresh
man Erin Burdette in the second
lliglit. Senior Keiko Tokuda and
freshman Story Tweedie-Yates out
hustled Annika Bengtsson and
Zerene Reyes, winning 8-4 in the
third lliglit. Senior Gabriela Listra
and Kalvaria, the nation's top
ranked doubles team, outlasted No.
3 Lindsey Dawaf and Jessica Lehn
hoff, winning 8-0 in a hard-hitting
first-flight match marked by repeat
ed service breaks.
The Cardinal erupted in cheers
and congratulations, and headed
into the break between the doubles
matches and the singles matches in
high spirits.
"It's just a huge momentum
thing," Forood said. "It sure feels
good when yon go into singles
knowing you only have to split
them."
Despite the tall order facing
them — winning four of six singles
matches against the nation's best
singles lineup — the Florida players
did not back down.
Florida's Reyes, a 4-foot-10 left
handed freshman ranked No. 53
nationally in singles, knotted the
score at 1-1 by upsetting No. 10
