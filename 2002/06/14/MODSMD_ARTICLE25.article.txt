No respect? Not anymore.
Ever since a loss to No. 3 Georgia
(26-2) on Feb. 9 dropped it from the
top spot in the rankings, the No. 2
Stanford women's tennis team (27-
1) has been determined to prove
who the best team in the country re
ally was. 1 -ast night at the Taube
Tennis Center, the Cardinal did just
that, defeating top-ranked Florida

(24-2), 4-1, to claim its second
straight NCAA Championship.
"To end it on the home courts, in
front of people who have been sup
porting us for four years, is an in
credible feeling," senior Lauren
Kalvaria said.
After freshman Erin Burdette's
backhand winner skipped past
Alexis Gordon, the Cardinal players
piled on top of each other in the
middle of the court in celebration.
Once they disentangled themselves,

they all donned T-shirts that read
"Stanford 2002 NCAA Champions"
on the front and "No Respect" on
the back.
"We were ranked as low as sixth,
and that's ridiculous," Kalvaria said.
The Cardinal is number one
now, though.
".All the hard work this season
has paid off," Burdette said.
Stanford accomplished its goal,
and now the team can sit back and
relish what it has accomplished.
"It was an unbelievable season,"
head coach Lele Forood said. "Our
team really worked hard."
The championship match was
no exception, lasting four hours
after rain delayed the start for three
hours. From the beginning, Florida
made it clear that it was not going to
go quietly.
In doubles, Florida's Alexis Gor
don and Julia Scaringe knocked off
Stanford's No. 14 duo of sopho
more Lauren Barnikow and fresh
man Erin Burdette in the second
lliglit. Senior Keiko Tokuda and
freshman Story Tweedie-Yates out
hustled Annika Bengtsson and
Zerene Reyes, winning 8-4 in the
third lliglit. Senior Gabriela Listra
and Kalvaria, the nation's top
ranked doubles team, outlasted No.
3 Lindsey Dawaf and Jessica Lehn
hoff, winning 8-0 in a hard-hitting
first-flight match marked by repeat
ed service breaks.
The Cardinal erupted in cheers
and congratulations, and headed
into the break between the doubles
matches and the singles matches in
high spirits.
"It's just a huge momentum
thing," Forood said. "It sure feels
good when yon go into singles
knowing you only have to split
them."
Despite the tall order facing
them — winning four of six singles
matches against the nation's best
singles lineup — the Florida players
did not back down.
Florida's Reyes, a 4-foot-10 left
handed freshman ranked No. 53
nationally in singles, knotted the
score at 1-1 by upsetting No. 10

Seniors Keiko Tokuda, Lauren Kalvaria and Gabriela Lastra clutch their third
NCAA championship trophy in their fourth year on the Farm. This year the
Stanford tennis team captured the national championship on its home court.
Barnikow, 6-0, 0-2, in the third
flight.
The next two matches to finish,
though, were Stanford victories,
putting the pressure on Florida.
1 okuda ended her collegiate career
on a 23-match winning streak, tak
ing out Bengtsson, 6-3, 6-1, in the
fifth flight. Sophomore Emilia An
derson followed with a 6-3, 0-4 win
over Scaringe in No. 6 singles.
No. 13 Burdette then followed
with her 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 title-clinching
victory over No. 118 Gordon,
kalvaria's and Lastra's matches
were then abandoned.
No. 4 Kalvaria was down, 2-6, 6-
0, 4-2, to top-ranked LehnhofFin a
showdown between two powerful
baseline hitters, and No. 0 lustra
had gained a 6-2,5-7,4-1 advantage

against No. 18 Lindsey Dawaf due
to her relentless volleying.
Stanford accomplished its final
goal of the season with its victory
over Florida. On Saturday, though,
the team accomplished another im
portant goal — getting back at
Georgia.
Stanford, by winning 4-0, was
avenging its February loss and its
defeat to the Bulldogs in the 2000
championship match.
"It was very sweet to be able to
play them on our home courts and
beat them one last time," Lastra said.
"We wanted to get back at Georgia
so badly."
In doubles, Kalvaria and Lastra
clinched their match without any
resistance, dispatching No. 15
Agatha Cioroch and Lori Grey, 8-1,
after which Tokuda and Tweedie-
Yates checked in with an 8-4 victo
ry over Anne Nguyen and Alexan
dra Smith. Barnikowand Burdette
were up, 7-6, on No. 33 Tina Ho

jnik and Mariel Verban, who had
no answer for the Cardinal's strong
net play.
Singles were even breezier, as the
Bulldogs were still shocked from
doubles.
" I think wejust came 011 so strong
that they were shell-shocked," Las
tra said. "They were kind of like, 'Oh
my God, what happened?'"
Tokuda was first to finish, with a
6-1,6-0 triumph over Hojnik. Bur
dette followed with a 6-3, 6-4 win
over Grey, and Lastra clinched the
match by putting away No. 37 Ver
ban, 6-3,6-4.
Kalvaria was down, 4-6, 1-4, to
No. 7 Cioroch, at that time, and
Barnikow trailed Nguyen, 2-6, 4-5.
Anderson had a 6-2, 2-1 edge 011
Smith.
As soon as Lastra clinched her
match, Kalvaria left her point in
progress, running over to hug Las
tra. The rest of the team soon joined
in the celebration of the Cardinal's

16th trip to the championship
match in 21 years.
"We weren't successful in that
match in February, so we had a lot to
play for," Forood said.
Stanford advanced to the cham
pionships by defeating Sacramen
to State (20-4), 4-0, and No. 36
I'epperdine (13-14), 4-0, in region
al play.
On Thursday, Kalvaria and Las
tra, as well as Tokuda and Tweedie-
Yates lost in doubles, before the
team came back to defeat No. 17
Kentucky (18-9), 5-1 .
On Friday against No. 7 North
Carolina (25-5), the Cardinal en
dured another doubles scare, as all
three doubles teams fell behind, 3-0.
Tokuda and Tweedie-Yates fell,
8-6, to Lee Bairos and Kate Pinch
beck, and the other two matches
went down to the wire. Fortunately
for the Cardinal, Barnikow and
Burdette fought their way to a 9-8
win over No. 47 Kendall ( '.line and

Aiiiela Mojzis, while Kalvaria and
Lastra came back from a (3-2 deficit
to edge Marlene Mejia and Julie
Rotondi, 9-8, in an aggressively
played battle.
in singles, Anderson overpow
ered Cline, 6-1, 6-2, before
Barnikow fell, 6-0,6-3, to the hyper
kinetic Rotondi. Tokuda took care
of Bairos, 6-4,6-1, though, and Las
tra followed with a 6-3,6-3 win over
No. 14 Pinchbeck.
Kalvaria was up, 6-2, 3-3, on No.
36 Mejia when the match ended,
while Burdette had a 6-4, 4-1 ad
vantage over Mojzis.
However, any individual accom
plishments for the Stanford players
are just icing on the cake. The team
is the NCAA champion, and that's
all that really matters.
"To win it at home, your senior
year? It doesn't get any better than
that," Lastra said.
