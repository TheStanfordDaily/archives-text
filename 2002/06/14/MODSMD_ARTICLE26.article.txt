# Dettamanti retires a champion
## 
### VESSELA STOYANOVA STAFF WRITER 
Dante Dettamanti had little
time to take his shoes off before
jumping into the pool to cele
brate his retirement gift â€” a na
tional championship.
Last weekend's NCAA Champi
onship, hosted by top-ranked Stan
ford, crowned a stellar season for
the men's water polo team, which
finished with a record of 22-1 and its
ninth national title. The 8-5 victory
in Sunday's final game over two
time defending national champion
UCLA was Dettamanti's last hurrah
after 25 years as Stanford's head
coach.
For the four seniors on the
squad, this was a last shot at the na
tional title after narrowly missing it
twice. I'he Cardinal finished as the
runner-up in both 1998 and 1999.
"We lost my freshman and
sophomore years and I got a taste of
that, but I really wanted a taste of
this. And it's bloody good," senior
Onno Koelman said.
After beating UCLA three times
during the season, Stanford quickly
came out to reassert its dominance
over the Bruins by jumping to a 3-0
lead less than four minutes into the
game.
"A 3-0 lead in the first quarter is
tough to come back from when
you're playing against such a great
defense like [Stanford], and such a
good goalie [junior Nick Ellis],"
said Bruins head coach Adam
Krikorian.
The Cardinal drew first blood
when redshirt freshman Tony
Azevedo, named the Tournament's
Most Valuable Player, put Stanford
on the board with a penalty shot.
Only 18 seconds later, junior Jeff
Nesmith chalked up another goal
on a fast break after receiving an
outlet pass from Ellis. The Cardinal
solidified its lead after an extra-man
advantage was capitalized on by ju
nior hole man Peter I ludnut.
Despite a one-goal comeback by
UCI As senior Alfonso Tucay at the
end of the first period, Stanford
continued building its insurmount
able lead in the second quarter of

the match. While at close range of
the net, Azevedo turned around to
launch a shot that went past the
Bruins goalkeeper, junior Brandon
Brooks. With two minutes to go in
the half, Koelman sent a backhand
shot into UCLA's net to extend
Stanford's halftime lead to 5-1.
I'he third period witnessed an
other attempted comeback by the
desperate Bruins. Tucay tacked on
a turnaround shot from the two
meter position that cut the Cardinal

lead to 5-2.
Stanford junior Brian Harrow
responded with a lob shot that re
stored his team's four-goal lead.
However, UCLA kept up the
suspense, rallying back for two
more goals that brought it into tro
phy contention and narrowed the
Cardinal's winning margin to 6-4 at
the end of the third quarter.
