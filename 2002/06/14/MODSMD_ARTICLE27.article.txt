# Volleyball ends victorious

### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
For most teams, just playing in the Final
Four would be pressure enough.
But not for the Stanford women's volley
ball team.
For the Cardinal, after a season full of re
markable comebacks, no championship run
would have been complete without having
to dig out of a few more holes.
So, true to style, the Cardinal fell into a
pair of seemingly hopeless situations in the
first two games of its NCAA semifinal match
against defending champion Nebraska on
Dec. 13. And then it did it again in the first
game against top-seeded Long Beach State
in the championship match on Dec. 15.
True to style, the Stanford squad some
how prevailed.
Now the Cardinal will raise another na
tional championship banner in Maples
Pavilion.
Stanford (33-2) posted an improbable 3-
0 win over the Cornhuskers (31-2) in the
semifinals and then ended the 49ers' (33-1)
hopes of an undefeated season with a stun
ning 3-0 win in the finals to claim the Cardi
nal's fifth NCAA crown.
"This group has shown a remarkable
ability to stay relaxed this year," said Stan
ford head coach John Dunning, who was
named National Coach of the Year in his
first season with the Cardinal. "We were
down in several matches, down hopelessly at
Arizona [on Nov. 17]. They didn't panic and
they remained patient, and they took ad
vantage of our serve, which was really on."
The Cardinal's win against Long Beach
made for sweet revenge.
The49ers handed Stanford its first loss of
the season on Sept. 25. So naturally it was
the Cardinal's pleasure to return the favor
— especially with Long Beach State being

the clear-cut favorite in most people's eyes
heading into the final — and cut oft the
49ers' bid to post only the third undefeated
season in NCAA history.
Under a new coach, the Cardinal im
proved on its 19-12 2000 season to claim the
top spot in the country.
Even without the national title, this
would have been a championship season for
the Stanford women's volleyball team.
Of course, no one is going to mind that
fifth championship banner that'll be going
up in Maples Pavilion.
But the Cardinal's postseason run was
merely the cherry on top of an already sweet
season for the Stanford volleyball program.
Coming off a forgettable 19-12 season
last year, the Cardinal faced the nation's
toughest schedule in 2001 with 18 matches
against ranked opponents.
With four teams from the Pacific 10 Con
ference in the top 10 all season and four
other squads in the conference always capa
ble of a big upset, Stanford's Pac-10 sched
ule would've been challenging enough on
its own.
And all this was under the guidance of a
new head coach who had only been hired a
couple weeks before the Cardinal's presea
son practices started.
With all of this standing in the face of the
Stanford squad at the outset of the season,
the team's stated goal of a national champi
onship may have seemed farfetched to
many.
Rest assured, the Cardinal was more
than happy to prove the unbelievers wrong.
"This is a really neat group of 14 players,"
said head coach John Dunning, in his first
year at Stanford after 16 at Pacific. "They
did a good job together with a new coach
who they didn't know if he knew anything
