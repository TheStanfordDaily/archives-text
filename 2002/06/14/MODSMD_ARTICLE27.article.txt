# Volleyball ends victorious

### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
For most teams, just playing in the Final
Four would be pressure enough.
But not for the Stanford women's volley
ball team.
For the Cardinal, after a season full of re
markable comebacks, no championship run
would have been complete without having
to dig out of a few more holes.
So, true to style, the Cardinal fell into a
pair of seemingly hopeless situations in the
first two games of its NCAA semifinal match
against defending champion Nebraska on
Dec. 13. And then it did it again in the first
game against top-seeded Long Beach State
in the championship match on Dec. 15.
True to style, the Stanford squad some
how prevailed.
Now the Cardinal will raise another na
tional championship banner in Maples
Pavilion.
Stanford (33-2) posted an improbable 3-
0 win over the Cornhuskers (31-2) in the
semifinals and then ended the 49ers' (33-1)
hopes of an undefeated season with a stun
ning 3-0 win in the finals to claim the Cardi
nal's fifth NCAA crown.
"This group has shown a remarkable
ability to stay relaxed this year," said Stan
ford head coach John Dunning, who was
named National Coach of the Year in his
first season with the Cardinal. "We were
down in several matches, down hopelessly at
Arizona [on Nov. 17]. They didn't panic and
they remained patient, and they took ad
vantage of our serve, which was really on."
The Cardinal's win against Long Beach
made for sweet revenge.
The49ers handed Stanford its first loss of
the season on Sept. 25. So naturally it was
the Cardinal's pleasure to return the favor
— especially with Long Beach State being

the clear-cut favorite in most people's eyes
heading into the final — and cut oft the
49ers' bid to post only the third undefeated
season in NCAA history.
Under a new coach, the Cardinal im
proved on its 19-12 2000 season to claim the
top spot in the country.
Even without the national title, this
would have been a championship season for
the Stanford women's volleyball team.
Of course, no one is going to mind that
fifth championship banner that'll be going
up in Maples Pavilion.
But the Cardinal's postseason run was
merely the cherry on top of an already sweet
season for the Stanford volleyball program.
Coming off a forgettable 19-12 season
last year, the Cardinal faced the nation's
toughest schedule in 2001 with 18 matches
against ranked opponents.
With four teams from the Pacific 10 Con
ference in the top 10 all season and four
other squads in the conference always capa
ble of a big upset, Stanford's Pac-10 sched
ule would've been challenging enough on
its own.
And all this was under the guidance of a
new head coach who had only been hired a
couple weeks before the Cardinal's presea
son practices started.
With all of this standing in the face of the
Stanford squad at the outset of the season,
the team's stated goal of a national champi
onship may have seemed farfetched to
many.
Rest assured, the Cardinal was more
than happy to prove the unbelievers wrong.
"This is a really neat group of 14 players,"
said head coach John Dunning, in his first
year at Stanford after 16 at Pacific. "They
did a good job together with a new coach
who they didn't know if he knew anything
or not. 1 can't say how hard this
team worked."
Dunning earned National
Coach of the Year honors in his in

augural season at the Farm, an
award he deserved not only for the
team's turnaround from last sea
son, but lor the transformation he
guided the team through this year.
The Cardinal began the season
as a team that won by brute
strength, overpowering oppo
nents' attacks with a devastating

blocking game and relying heavily
on its lethal oflensive combination
of All-American left side hitters, ju
nior Logan Tom and freshman
Ogonna Nnamani.
But after weeks of effort during
its midseason practices, Stanford
finished the year as a finesse team.
By season's end, the Cardinal boast
ed a balanced attack with five play
ers averaging over two kills per
game, and the team's digging and
block recovery was on par with the
best defensive teams in the country.
1 heir numbers may not stick out
too much in the season stats, but the
five seniors on the roster deserve a
great deal of credit for leading the
team's transformation on the court.
Fifth-year senior setter Robyn
I .ewis — the only player on the ros
ter to have already won a national
title, back in 1997 — ran the Stan
ford offense to perfection as the
year went along.
Her career bio at Stanford reads
like an anatomy book; a slew of in
juries sidelined her for most of the
last two seasons.
But she returned this year for
one more run at a championship
ring, and her ability to keep the
Cardinal attack mixed while still
getting the most from Nnamani
and Tom is one of the main reasons
she's graduating with another piece
of jewelry on her linger.
"It's so sweet and so great [to
win my last year]," said Lewis,
who ends her career fourth all
time at Stanford in assists. "It's a
great way to leave with a national
championship. It's an amazing
feeling."
With Nnamani occupying the
outside hitter spot they shared last
season, seniors Michelle Chambers
and Sara Sandrik only saw playing
time this year as defensive special
ists.
But along with senior defensive
specialist Emily Lawrence, these se
niors led the Cardinal's midseason
defensive thrust, which turned
Stanford from a mere contender to
a national champion.
"We were doing a lot of new sys
tem stuff that I had brought in that
was a little bit different," Dunning

said. "But the longer you do it to
gether, the more you can do it with
out having to talk a lot. It was a
growth we went through during
the season."
Senior middle blocker Lara
Conrad was one of Stanford's most
consistent players all season long.
She was second in the Pac-10 in
blocks per game, but by season's
end the team relied on her as much
for her attacking and serving as it
did on her blocking. Conrad fin
ished-third on the team in aces and
kills, helping her earn Pac-10 Hon
orable Mention honors.
The efforts of Conrad,
Lawrence, Sandrik and Chambers
kept them from becoming the first
senior class in 10 years to graduate
without a championship ring.
But of course one cannot over
look the individual efforts of Tom
and Nnamani in weighing the suc
cess of the 2001 Cardinal squad.
Tom, now a three-time All-
selection, finally earned
the AVCA National Player of the
Year award after setting a Cardinal
single-season record with 021 kills.
She also turned in 60 service aces
and 420 digs, both the second-best
single-season marks at Stanford.
The bright-eyed Nnamani spent
most of the season too blown away
by the whole Stanford experience
to notice, or at least acknowledge,
that she had become a prominent
figure on the national volleyball
scene.
She should now.
After finishing sixth in the Pac
-10 in kills and averaging 3.95 kills
per game during the NCAA tour
nament, Nnamani was selected as
Volleyball Magazine's Freshman of
the Year and named a second-team
All-American.
"I had a dream one day that we
were going to win the national
championship, but I didn't tell any
body because if you tell your
dreams to someone, they might not
come true," Nnamani said. "Now
I'm confessing that it's great. The
dream came true. This team has
been so wonderful."

and Nnamani in weighing the suc

Tom, now a three-time All-
selection, finally earned
the AVCA National Player of the
Year award after setting a Cardinal
single-season record with 021 kills.
She also turned in 60 service aces
and 420 digs, both the second-best
single-season marks at Stanford.
The bright-eyed Nnamani spent
most of the season too blown away
by the whole Stanford experience
to notice, or at least acknowledge,

figure on the national volleyball
scene.
She should now.
After finishing sixth in the Pac
-10 in kills and averaging 3.95 kills
per game during the NCAA tour
nament, Nnamani was selected as
Volleyball Magazine's Freshman of
the Year and named a second-team
All-American.
"I had a dream one day that we
were going to win the national
championship, but I didn't tell any
body because if you tell your
dreams to someone, they might not
come true," Nnamani said. "Now
I'm confessing that it's great. The
dream came true. This team has
been so wonderful."

Junior leftside hitter Logan Tom spikes the ball over the net. Tom, a three-time
All American selection, led the Stanford women's volleyball team to a na
tional championship.
For most teams, just playing in the Final
Four would be pressure enough.
But not for the Stanford women's volley
ball team.
For the Cardinal, after a season full of re
markable comebacks, no championship run
would have been complete without having
to dig out of a few more holes.
So, true to style, the Cardinal fell into a
pair of seemingly hopeless situations in the
first two games of its NCAA semifinal match
against defending champion Nebraska on
Dec. 13. And then it did it again in the first
game against top-seeded Long Beach State
in the championship match on Dec. 15.
True to style, the Stanford squad some
how prevailed.
Now the Cardinal will raise another na
tional championship banner in Maples
Pavilion.
Stanford (33-2) posted an improbable 3-
0 win over the Cornhuskers (31-2) in the
semifinals and then ended the 49ers' (33-1)
hopes of an undefeated season with a stun
ning 3-0 win in the finals to claim the Cardi
nal's fifth NCAA crown.
"This group has shown a remarkable
ability to stay relaxed this year," said Stan
ford head coach John Dunning, who was
named National Coach of the Year in his
first season with the Cardinal. "We were
down in several matches, down hopelessly at
Arizona [on Nov. 17]. They didn't panic and
they remained patient, and they took ad
vantage of our serve, which was really on."
The Cardinal's win against Long Beach
made for sweet revenge.
The49ers handed Stanford its first loss of
the season on Sept. 25. So naturally it was
the Cardinal's pleasure to return the favor
— especially with Long Beach State being

the clear-cut favorite in most people's eyes
heading into the final — and cut oft the
49ers' bid to post only the third undefeated
season in NCAA history.
Under a new coach, the Cardinal im
proved on its 19-12 2000 season to claim the
top spot in the country.
Even without the national title, this
would have been a championship season for
the Stanford women's volleyball team.
Of course, no one is going to mind that
fifth championship banner that'll be going
up in Maples Pavilion.
But the Cardinal's postseason run was
merely the cherry on top of an already sweet
season for the Stanford volleyball program.
Coming off a forgettable 19-12 season
last year, the Cardinal faced the nation's
toughest schedule in 2001 with 18 matches
against ranked opponents.
With four teams from the Pacific 10 Con
ference in the top 10 all season and four
other squads in the conference always capa
ble of a big upset, Stanford's Pac-10 sched
ule would've been challenging enough on
its own.
And all this was under the guidance of a
new head coach who had only been hired a
couple weeks before the Cardinal's presea
son practices started.
With all of this standing in the face of the
Stanford squad at the outset of the season,
the team's stated goal of a national champi
onship may have seemed farfetched to
many.
Rest assured, the Cardinal was more
than happy to prove the unbelievers wrong.
"This is a really neat group of 14 players,"
said head coach John Dunning, in his first
year at Stanford after 16 at Pacific. "They
did a good job together with a new coach
who they didn't know if he knew anything
or not. 1 can't say how hard this
team worked."
Dunning earned National
Coach of the Year honors in his in

augural season at the Farm, an
award he deserved not only for the
team's turnaround from last sea
son, but lor the transformation he
guided the team through this year.
The Cardinal began the season
as a team that won by brute
strength, overpowering oppo
nents' attacks with a devastating

blocking game and relying heavily
on its lethal oflensive combination
of All-American left side hitters, ju
nior Logan Tom and freshman
Ogonna Nnamani.
But after weeks of effort during
its midseason practices, Stanford
finished the year as a finesse team.
By season's end, the Cardinal boast
ed a balanced attack with five play
ers averaging over two kills per
game, and the team's digging and
block recovery was on par with the
best defensive teams in the country.
1 heir numbers may not stick out
too much in the season stats, but the
five seniors on the roster deserve a
great deal of credit for leading the
team's transformation on the court.
Fifth-year senior setter Robyn
I .ewis — the only player on the ros
ter to have already won a national
title, back in 1997 — ran the Stan
ford offense to perfection as the
year went along.
Her career bio at Stanford reads
like an anatomy book; a slew of in
juries sidelined her for most of the
last two seasons.
But she returned this year for
one more run at a championship
ring, and her ability to keep the
Cardinal attack mixed while still
getting the most from Nnamani
and Tom is one of the main reasons
she's graduating with another piece
of jewelry on her linger.
"It's so sweet and so great [to
win my last year]," said Lewis,
who ends her career fourth all
time at Stanford in assists. "It's a
great way to leave with a national
championship. It's an amazing
feeling."
With Nnamani occupying the
outside hitter spot they shared last
season, seniors Michelle Chambers
and Sara Sandrik only saw playing
time this year as defensive special
ists.
But along with senior defensive
specialist Emily Lawrence, these se
niors led the Cardinal's midseason
defensive thrust, which turned
Stanford from a mere contender to
a national champion.
"We were doing a lot of new sys
tem stuff that I had brought in that
was a little bit different," Dunning

said. "But the longer you do it to
gether, the more you can do it with
out having to talk a lot. It was a
growth we went through during
the season."
Senior middle blocker Lara
Conrad was one of Stanford's most
consistent players all season long.
She was second in the Pac-10 in
blocks per game, but by season's
end the team relied on her as much
for her attacking and serving as it
did on her blocking. Conrad fin
ished-third on the team in aces and
kills, helping her earn Pac-10 Hon
orable Mention honors.
The efforts of Conrad,
Lawrence, Sandrik and Chambers
kept them from becoming the first
senior class in 10 years to graduate
without a championship ring.
But of course one cannot over
look the individual efforts of Tom
and Nnamani in weighing the suc
cess of the 2001 Cardinal squad.
Tom, now a three-time All-
