# Water polo avenges last year's loss
## Women's team beats UCLA in NCAA championship to claim first-ever title 
### KIM ROBERTS STAFF WRITER 
One year after losing to UCLA in the
NCAA championship game and one
week after falling to the Bruins in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation title
game, the women's water polo team fi
nally got its revenge. The Cardinal de
feated UCLA, 8-4, last night in Los An
geles to earn its first-ever national
championship.
Of course, the NCAA championship in
women's water polo has only existed for
two years. But, both final matchups have
come between the Cardinal and the Bru
ins. Last year, UCLA shocked the Cardi
nal by handing Stanford its first loss of the
season at the most inopportune time.
This year, however, Stanford's depth
propelled it to victory. Six different play
ers scored in the match.
As it has done all year, Stanford got on
the board quickly with goals by sopho
more Wendy Watkins, junior Julie Gard
ner and senior Ellen Estes. After the first
quarter, Stanford led the match, 3-1.
Then, after a second period where the
two teams played each other evenly, the
game entered the half at 4-2.
The Bruins were led by sophomore
Natalie Golda, who scored her second of
three goals of the game early in the third
quarter. With the Bruins only down by
two, after a UCLA shot hit the crossbar,
freshman Kelty Luber scored to increase
the Stanford lead to three.

Even though the Bruins scored four
goals in the fourth quarter, Stanford kept
the lead with three goals of its own.
Estes and Gardner led the way with
two goals. Also scoring for Stanford were
sophomores Brenda Villa, Jeanine Jack
son, Wat kins and Luber.
Frank was honored for her perfor
mance throughout ihe tournament as she
was named to the NCAA All-Tournament
Team. She was also named Stanford's
Most Valuable Player. Also honored with
First All-Tournament Team selections
were Villa and Estes. Gardner, Watkins
and senior Margie Dingeldein were Sec

ond Team selections.
Stanford defeated fourth-seeded
Michigan, 13-3, on Saturday to earn a
berth in the championship game. With
four goals in the first quarter, Stanford
took the early lead and never looked
back. The team was led by Villa with four
goals. Gardner, Jackson and sophomore
Lauren Faust each had two.
