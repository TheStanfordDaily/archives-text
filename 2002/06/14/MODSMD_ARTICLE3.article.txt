# Band suspended from Pac-10s
## University punishes Band after violation of alcohol probation 
### RAMIN SETOODEH EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Stanford Band was placed
on travel suspension last week
after alcohol containers were
found in the Band Shak, said
Assoc. Dean of Students Morris
Graves.
"The Band has [been suspend
ed] because they flagrantly violat
ed the alcohol probation that had
been put on them," Graves said.
At least one keg and many
empty bottles of beer were found
by custodial staff inside the Band
Shak on Thursday morning after a
party, said Graves. The alcohol was
related to the selection of the new
Tree mascot for the 2002-2003
school year.
"I was also informed that people
had thrown up and not cleaned up
[after themselves]," Graves said.
Senior Mike Huijon, public re
lations manager for the Band, said
the gathering was neither "pre
meditated nor publicized." He also
said he wouldn't call it a "party."
The Band was put on alcohol
probation by the Office of Student
Activities in mid-February for
undisclosed incidents involving al
cohol consumption. The proba
tion had not affected the Band's
traveling schedule.

But as a result of the suspen
sion, the Band was not allowed to
travel with the women's basketball
team to the Pacific 10 Conference
Tournament at the University of
Oregon. They will also not be able
to play at the upcoming men's Pac
-10 Conference Tournament,
which will take place in Los Ange
les beginning Thursday.
"We want the Band [there], "
said Assoc. Athletic Director Dar
rin Nelson. "But being there is not
a right, it's a privilege. They have
to earn their way there just like our
teams earn their way there. They
have to behave appropriately."
Huijon said that only a few
Band members were involved in
the alcohol consumption that led
to the suspension.
"A small subset of the Band vio
lated our alcohol probation," Hui
jon said. "Our new Tree was select
ed last Week. During the selection
process, a bit of a mess was made in
the Band Shack and the Athletics
Department made an unan
nounced inspection of the fire
sprinklers the next morning.
"It was in between the Tree
event and cleaning up. They saw
the mess and were understandably
upset."
University administrators said
they were unsure whether the sus
pension would affect the Band's
appearance at the upcoming
men's and women's NCAA basket
ball tournaments.
"It will depend on whether they
will deal with this responsibly or if

they'll blow it off and say it's not
their fault," Graves said.
"Being in a leadership position
makes it hard for one to make de
cisions. ft appears that a significant
number of leaders in the Band are
not willing to make those deci
sions," he said.
Huijon said the many members
of the Band were disappointed
with the suspension.
"We enjoy trips," he said. "But
more than that, we feel it's unfair,
t he two basketball teams are hav
ing really great years and we enjoy
supporting them and we feel we're
an invaluable source of support for
them.
"The prevailing feeling is that it
was a quick reaction to an issue
they feel needed to be addressed
— we can't insult them for that."
Several administrators are
scheduled to meet with Band
members on Thursday to discuss
the violation.
"We expect them to submit a
written document stating exactly
what the [Band] leadership will do
to resolve this issue, and how they
will better manage their facilities,"
Graves said.
Huijon said he thinks the mat
ter will be resolved.
"We're working with the Athlet
ics Department and the adminis
tration," he said. "We feel confi
dent that the measures we propose
will be accepted and our travel sus
pension will be lifted."
Graves also said that he was op
timistic that the administration

would reach a compromise witli
the Band.
"What we have found is that
when the Band has been willing to
work with us to resolve problems,
we always resolve them," he said.
'That's what we're hoping for."
But Graves added the possibili
ty that the Band could also be sus
pended as a recognized student
group. In that case, the Band
would no longer receive ASSU
funding and would not be able to

use University facilities.
"That's the worst-case sce
nario," Graves said. "That's if the
Band refuses to cooperate."
Nelson said that the Athletics
Department would adhere to the
decision that is made by the Of lice
of Student Activities.
"Should the Band lose their
funding and the University throws
them off campus, athletics will go
along with that and not let them
perform in any of our events," Nel

son said.
Nelson said he hoped fora fa
vorable outcome.
"We hope they'll be able to
play again," Nelson said. "But
we'll need to talk to [the Office of
Student Activities] and the Band
members to see how they can cor
rect these things, and to see if
they can play in the NCAA Tour
nament."

"That's the worst-case sce
nario," Graves said. "That's if the
Band refuses to cooperate."
Nelson said that the Athletics
Department would adhere to the
decision that is made by the Of lice
of Student Activities.
"Should the Band lose their
funding and the University throws
them off campus, athletics will go
along with that and not let them
perform in any of our events," Nel

son said.
Nelson said he hoped fora fa
vorable outcome.
"We hope they'll be able to
play again," Nelson said. "But
we'll need to talk to [the Office of
Student Activities] and the Band
members to see how they can cor
rect these things, and to see if
they can play in the NCAA Tour
nament."

The Band was put on travel suspension in March after alcohol was found in the Band Shak. As a result, the Band did
not perform at the Pacific 10 conference tournaments for the men's and women's basketball teams.
The Stanford Band was placed
on travel suspension last week
after alcohol containers were
found in the Band Shak, said
Assoc. Dean of Students Morris
Graves.
"The Band has [been suspend
ed] because they flagrantly violat
ed the alcohol probation that had
been put on them," Graves said.
At least one keg and many
empty bottles of beer were found
by custodial staff inside the Band
Shak on Thursday morning after a
party, said Graves. The alcohol was
related to the selection of the new
Tree mascot for the 2002-2003
school year.
"I was also informed that people
had thrown up and not cleaned up
[after themselves]," Graves said.
Senior Mike Huijon, public re
lations manager for the Band, said
the gathering was neither "pre
meditated nor publicized." He also
said he wouldn't call it a "party."
The Band was put on alcohol
probation by the Office of Student
Activities in mid-February for
undisclosed incidents involving al
cohol consumption. The proba
tion had not affected the Band's
traveling schedule.

But as a result of the suspen
sion, the Band was not allowed to
travel with the women's basketball
team to the Pacific 10 Conference
Tournament at the University of
Oregon. They will also not be able
to play at the upcoming men's Pac
-10 Conference Tournament,
which will take place in Los Ange
les beginning Thursday.
"We want the Band [there], "
said Assoc. Athletic Director Dar
rin Nelson. "But being there is not
a right, it's a privilege. They have
to earn their way there just like our
teams earn their way there. They
have to behave appropriately."
Huijon said that only a few
Band members were involved in
the alcohol consumption that led
to the suspension.
"A small subset of the Band vio
lated our alcohol probation," Hui
jon said. "Our new Tree was select
ed last Week. During the selection
process, a bit of a mess was made in
the Band Shack and the Athletics
Department made an unan
nounced inspection of the fire
sprinklers the next morning.
"It was in between the Tree
event and cleaning up. They saw
the mess and were understandably
upset."
University administrators said
they were unsure whether the sus
pension would affect the Band's
appearance at the upcoming
men's and women's NCAA basket
ball tournaments.
"It will depend on whether they
will deal with this responsibly or if

they'll blow it off and say it's not
their fault," Graves said.
"Being in a leadership position
makes it hard for one to make de
cisions. ft appears that a significant
number of leaders in the Band are
not willing to make those deci
sions," he said.
Huijon said the many members
of the Band were disappointed
with the suspension.
"We enjoy trips," he said. "But
more than that, we feel it's unfair,
t he two basketball teams are hav
ing really great years and we enjoy
supporting them and we feel we're
an invaluable source of support for
them.
"The prevailing feeling is that it
was a quick reaction to an issue
they feel needed to be addressed
— we can't insult them for that."
Several administrators are
scheduled to meet with Band
members on Thursday to discuss
the violation.
"We expect them to submit a
written document stating exactly
what the [Band] leadership will do
to resolve this issue, and how they
will better manage their facilities,"
Graves said.
Huijon said he thinks the mat
ter will be resolved.
"We're working with the Athlet
ics Department and the adminis
tration," he said. "We feel confi
dent that the measures we propose
will be accepted and our travel sus
pension will be lifted."
Graves also said that he was op
timistic that the administration

would reach a compromise witli
the Band.
"What we have found is that
when the Band has been willing to
work with us to resolve problems,
we always resolve them," he said.
'That's what we're hoping for."
But Graves added the possibili
ty that the Band could also be sus
pended as a recognized student
group. In that case, the Band
would no longer receive ASSU
funding and would not be able to

use University facilities.
"That's the worst-case sce
nario," Graves said. "That's if the
Band refuses to cooperate."
Nelson said that the Athletics
Department would adhere to the
decision that is made by the Of lice
of Student Activities.
"Should the Band lose their
funding and the University throws
them off campus, athletics will go
along with that and not let them
perform in any of our events," Nel
