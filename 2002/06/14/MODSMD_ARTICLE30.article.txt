# Giovacchini leads quietly
## 
### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
For Tony Giovacchini, the
year began with so much
promise.
The 2001-02 season was a
journey the senior point guard
would control — a journey he
had waited three years to grasp,
to clutch, to call his own.
In some respects, nothing has
changed. Giovacchini is still the
starting point guard, the guy who
runs the club. He's also still vocal
in team huddles, and he implores
his teammates to play with inten
sity day-in and day-out.
In other respects, though,
Giovacchini's role is not the
same. His minutes are down.
The number of skeptics is grow
ing. His presence in critical mo
ments of games is declining.
But why? I le has certainly
done everything asked of him,
and the Cardinal has been suc
cessful when he has been on the
court.
Six times in non-conference
play, Giovacchini played 25 or
more minutes. Stanford's
record? 5-1. In fact, the only loss
was an overtime defeat to Texas
in which the 6-foot-2, 180-pound
senior spent the entire extra ses
sion on the bench.
Slowly, those minutes have
declined. He played only 17 at
Oregon, 15 against Washington
State, 16atUCLAand 16 against
Arizona. The Cardinal's record?
Just 2-2.
So why not Giovacchini? He's
certainly got the right attitude.
"I always want to have the op
portunity to help our team on the
floor," he said. "There are a lot of
things that don't involve putting
the ball in the basket or making a
flashy play that really do help the
team."
Like consistent defense. Or
position rebounding. Or a 2-to-l
assist-to-turnover ratio. Or help

ing his teammates even if lie's not
in tlie game.
"It has to be tough for him, but
in the huddles at t lie end of the
game, if he's still on the bench, he
comes in and gives advice. If he
sees something, he lets it be
known," said redshirt sopho
more forward Justin Davis.
Giovacchini just might be a
victim of bad timing. If last year's

team was here (excluding point
guard Michael McDonald), one
that had four dependable scor
ing threats on the court at all
times, he would probably be av
eraging 30 minutes per night.
This year, however, a lack of of
fensive production from other po
sitions has throttled his playing

Senior Tony Giovachinni contemplates life beyond Stanford. The point
guard helped lead the Stanford men's basketball team to a 12-6 record
in Pac-10 play.
time.
"We're not getting a lot of
points at the [power forward]
right now, so you've got to get
scoring from all spots on the floor.
Tony's not necessarily been a
scorer," Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery said.
With four perimeter players in
junior Casey Jacobsen, junior
Julius Barnes, freshman Josh Chil
dress and Giovacchini, the Salt

Lake City native has often been the
odd man out, particularly against
up-tempo teams.
Yet, throughout it all — the crit
icisms and disappointments, de
feats and deterrents — Giovacchi
ni's confident demeanor has never
wavered and his objectives are still
t he same.
"My personal goal is the same as
our team's: To be as good as we can
possibly be," Giovacchini said. "I
also need to understand that we
have a lot of guys on our roster that
have a lot of talent. I have to sup
port that."
Frankly, from day one, Giovac

chini has understood that he
would be the player that kept
everyone on task and focused.
As the team left for its season
opener in New Mexico, while his
teammates bustled with excite
ment and energy, Ciovacchini sat
by himself, silently focused.
This trip, like all other road
trips this season, would be busi
ness-only. No indulgence. Or
amusement. Just business.
Safe to say, Ciovacchini simply
took care of business by tallying a
season-high 13 points at The Pit,
including a 3-for-3 showing fiom
behind the arc, and led the Cardi

nal to an 81-66 victory. It made a
statement to Cardinal fans that the
loss of McDonald would not be a
problem.
1 fe then matched a career-high
with eight assists in Stanford's next
game against Southern Utah.
But all of a sudden, as freshman
point guard Chris Hernandez
showed signs of growth and point
guard Barnes displayed his athleti
cism, energy and scoring ability,
Ciovacchini's minutes have begun
to wane.
So while Hernandez and
Barnes have received the nod dur
ing the last five minutes in crucial

games at Oregon and against the
Arizona schools, Giovacchini has
sat on the bench, wondering if he'll
ever get the opportunity to lead his
team again.
"If all these guys and go out and
play hard, I can cope with the fact
that I'm not going to play 40 min
utes a game," Giovacchini said.
Hut what about 30 minutes? Or
even 25? What about playing him
down the stretch?
One can say he's earned it.
"Tony's important to us and it's
important for me to keep him
playing so he recognizes that he's
important," Montgomery said.

"Of all the players, he probably
knows best what it is we're trying to
do."
Of course he does. He's the
fourth-year senior. He's the force.
And lie's the glue.
Therefore, the season still holds
much promise tor Giovacchini. If
only he would got a chance
Just take a look at any basketball
media guide or poster, which bears
his surname, jersey and profile.
I he answer is simple: This is
still his team.
And this is still his time.
