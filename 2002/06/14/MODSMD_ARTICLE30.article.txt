# Giovacchini leads quietly
## 
### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
For Tony Giovacchini, the
year began with so much
promise.
The 2001-02 season was a
journey the senior point guard
would control â€” a journey he
had waited three years to grasp,
to clutch, to call his own.
In some respects, nothing has
changed. Giovacchini is still the
starting point guard, the guy who
runs the club. He's also still vocal
in team huddles, and he implores
his teammates to play with inten
sity day-in and day-out.
In other respects, though,
Giovacchini's role is not the
same. His minutes are down.
The number of skeptics is grow
ing. His presence in critical mo
ments of games is declining.
But why? I le has certainly
done everything asked of him,
and the Cardinal has been suc
cessful when he has been on the
court.
Six times in non-conference
play, Giovacchini played 25 or
more minutes. Stanford's
record? 5-1. In fact, the only loss
was an overtime defeat to Texas
in which the 6-foot-2, 180-pound
senior spent the entire extra ses
sion on the bench.
Slowly, those minutes have
declined. He played only 17 at
Oregon, 15 against Washington
State, 16atUCLAand 16 against
Arizona. The Cardinal's record?
Just 2-2.
So why not Giovacchini? He's
certainly got the right attitude.
"I always want to have the op
portunity to help our team on the
floor," he said. "There are a lot of
things that don't involve putting
the ball in the basket or making a
flashy play that really do help the
team."
Like consistent defense. Or
position rebounding. Or a 2-to-l
assist-to-turnover ratio. Or help

ing his teammates even if lie's not
in tlie game.
"It has to be tough for him, but
in the huddles at t lie end of the
game, if he's still on the bench, he
comes in and gives advice. If he
sees something, he lets it be
known," said redshirt sopho
more forward Justin Davis.
Giovacchini just might be a
victim of bad timing. If last year's

team was here (excluding point
guard Michael McDonald), one
that had four dependable scor
ing threats on the court at all
times, he would probably be av
eraging 30 minutes per night.
This year, however, a lack of of
fensive production from other po
sitions has throttled his playing

guard helped lead the Stanford men's basketball team to a 12-6 record
