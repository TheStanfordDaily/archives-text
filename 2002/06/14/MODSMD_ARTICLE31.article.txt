# Kalvaria, Lastra a dominant duo

### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Seniors Lauren Kalvaria and
Gabriela the No. 1 women's
tennis doubles team in the nation,
have led defending NCAA champi
on No. 1 Stanford to a 22-1 mark
this year and have posted a 24-2
record as a tandem.
For Kalvaria and Lastra, the
road to this year's national champi
onship began six years ago with a
"why not?" proposition.
"There's a big national tourna
ment called the Easter Bowl, and
neither Lauren nor 1 had doubles
partners, so we just decided to play
together," Lastra said. "We were 15
or 16 and everyone was paired off
and we'd both heard of each other.
Surprisingly enough, we ended up
winning the tournament."
What began as a last-minute
pickup team was already on its way
to becoming much more.
"We just decided to stay togeth
er after that," Kalvaria said.
The duo did not let the distance
between them — Kalvaria is from
Florida, Lastra from Nevada — in
terfere with their partnership.
"We would just meet up at tour
naments and play together,"

Kalvaria said.
From the beginning, it was clear
to both players that their skills com
plemented each other.
"Lauren was always the one with
the ground strokes and would just
bang from the baseline, while I was
more of the finesse player at the
net," Lastra said.
Kalvaria and Lastra also found

that they helped each other out on
the court psychologically.
"I'm more of a laid-back person,
whereas Lauren is more intense,"
Lastra said. "She's helped me to be
more vocal on the court."
"Cabby's got a very laid-back
mentality and that's important to

years.
have, to be even-keeled," added
Kalvaria. "I've learned that from
her."
While they rolled to more victo
ries on the high school circuit,
Kalvaria and Lastra found that they
complemented each other well off
the court, too.
"Gabby's kind of goofy, and
we're very different people, and
that works pretty well," Kalvaria
said. "I'm more serious."
Added Lastra, "We're just kind
of opposites."
The two bonded by traveling to
gether around the globe to play in
tournaments.
"We traveled together to Italy,
Brazil, Paraguay, Australia and Bel
gium," Kalvaria said, trying to re
calling all their exotic destinations.
As Kalvaria and Lastra wound
up their high school careers, they
each faced the question of which
university to attend. Stanford ad
mitted four players that year: Las
tra, Kalvaria, senior Keiko Tokuda,
and Marissa Irvin, who now plays
on the professional tour.
"Me, Keiko, and Marissa all gave
Lauren a call to try and persuade
her to come here," Lastra said.
Kalvaria, deliberating between
Stanford and Florida, chose Stan
ford.
"Gabby signed before I did and
once Gabby signed, it was definitely
an incentive to come to Stanford,"
Kalvaria said.
From the beginning, the pair
was glad they'd both chosen the
Farm.
"Coming into Stanford and not
knowing anyone can be tough, but
having kind of a ready-made friend
was important to me," Kalvaria
said.
At Stanford, the two honed their
individual games as well as their
doubles skills. Besides forming the
country's top tandem, Kalvaria is
ranked No. 4 in singles, while Las
tra is ranked No. 10.
On the doubles court, no one
can match their ability and team
work.
"We're a very versatile team as
compared to other teams," Lastra
said.
Explained Kalvaria, "We know

what shot we should take and what
shot our partner can reach, so it's
just a very natural thing."
Even today, the approach that
got them through their first tour
nament comes in handy.
"Gabby has always been a very
good volleyer with good hands,"
Kalvaria said. "I would set up the
point for Gabby to attack at the net.
That's pretty much what we do
now, only with more accuracy."
As they improved their chem
istry on the courts, Kalvaria and
Lastra also became closer off the
courts as college progressed They
now room together.
"We've definitely become very
close friends," Lastra said. "With
Keiko also, we've formed a special
bond. We're pretty tight."
Added Kalvaria, "Gabby's defi
nitely my best friend. She's kind of
a sister to me. We fight and we
laugh and we can talk about
things."
Their friendship is especially
tight because it has withstood chal
lenges on and off the courts.
"You have your other friends at
Stanford, but they can't really un
derstand what you go through [on
the courts]," Lastra said. "It's great
to have someone who does the
exact same thing; they can help you
out the most."
The Cardinal's season is wind
ing down, as are Kalvaria's and
Lastra's collegiate careers. This
weekend the team competes in
the Pac-10 Individuals in Ojai,
Calif., and the NCAA champi
onships start on May 10. Kalvaria
and Tokuda are taking the week
end off to rest for their final run
at the NCAA title.
For most college teammates and
friends, graduation is an end of
things. Not so for Kalvaria and Las
tra, who both plan to play profes
sional tennis.
"We're going to coordinate our
schedules and play some doubles
together," Kalvaria said. "We're
still going to see each other."
Sometimes, the duo can't believe
how far they've come together, as
teammates and as friends.
"Every now and then we'll be
like, '1 can't believe how we started
off playing together,'" Lastra said.
"I guess it was just meant to be, it
was fate for us to play together."
