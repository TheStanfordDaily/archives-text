Seniors Lauren Kalvaria and
Gabriela the No. 1 women's
tennis doubles team in the nation,
have led defending NCAA champi
on No. 1 Stanford to a 22-1 mark
this year and have posted a 24-2
record as a tandem.

more of the finesse player at the
net," Lastra said.
Kalvaria and Lastra also found

whereas Lauren is more intense,"
Lastra said. "She's helped me to be
more vocal on the court."
"Cabby's got a very laid-back
mentality and that's important to
