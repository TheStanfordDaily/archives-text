# Senior Riley sets pace for men's track

### DAN URBAN STAFF WRITER 
He's an NCAA champion, a world-record holder a
14 time All-American, and he's not done yet.
Senior Jonathon Riley has, no doubt, been one of
the most decorated and successful runners in Stanford
history.
A studio art major, Riley says he may possibly design
racing shoes one clay.
But for the time being, he races in other people's de
signs, and does so extremely well.
Making an impact since day one on the Farm, Riley
helped the cross country team to its 1997 national
championship in his freshman season.
As the team's fifth and final scorer, Riley's contribu
tion was crucial, since it allowed Stanford to edge rival
Arkansas by three points.
"[Running at the NCAA meet] was definitely

something I was working toward," Riley said. "I had
been running varsity but not scoring all season. To
have my best race of the season at nationals and be
part of a national championship my freshman year,
1 was very fortunate."
With his tremendous freshman season, Riley made
the tough transition to the college level, something that
not all star high school runners are able to do.
"I came into college being successful, but I knew
college would be a whole other level and it would
like a lot to reach that," he said. "1 knew with the
right coaching and training, things would work out
the right way."
Things started working out the right way veiy
quickly for Riley. In track that year, he was the top
ranked true freshman in the nation in the 5,000 me
ters. As a sophomore, he placed ninth at the N(A\
Cross Country Championships.
