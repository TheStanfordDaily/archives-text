# Senior Riley sets pace for men's track
## 
### DAN URBAN STAFF WRITER 
He's an NCAA champion, a world-record holder a
14 time All-American, and he's not done yet.
Senior Jonathon Riley has, no doubt, been one of
the most decorated and successful runners in Stanford
history.
A studio art major, Riley says he may possibly design
racing shoes one clay.
But for the time being, he races in other people's de
signs, and does so extremely well.
Making an impact since day one on the Farm, Riley
helped the cross country team to its 1997 national
championship in his freshman season.
As the team's fifth and final scorer, Riley's contribu
tion was crucial, since it allowed Stanford to edge rival
Arkansas by three points.
"[Running at the NCAA meet] was definitely

something I was working toward," Riley said. "I had
been running varsity but not scoring all season. To
have my best race of the season at nationals and be
part of a national championship my freshman year,
1 was very fortunate."
With his tremendous freshman season, Riley made
the tough transition to the college level, something that
not all star high school runners are able to do.
"I came into college being successful, but I knew
college would be a whole other level and it would
like a lot to reach that," he said. "1 knew with the
right coaching and training, things would work out
the right way."
Things started working out the right way veiy
quickly for Riley. In track that year, he was the top
ranked true freshman in the nation in the 5,000 me
ters. As a sophomore, he placed ninth at the N(A\
Cross Country Championships.
Though he redshirted what
would have been his sophomore
track season, Riley continued to im
prove.
His time of 13 minutes, 36.69
seconds in the 5,000 meters that
year remains his personal best to
this day, and that race at the Cardi
nal Invitational stands out as a mile
stone in his career.
"That 13-second breakthrough
in the [5,000-meters] showed I
could make it," Riley said.
"There's a big difference between
guys running 14 minutes and
guys in the 13:30'5. Doing that as a
sophomore got me tired up."
Riley continued to deliver huge
performances when they mattered
most, placing fifth in the 5,000 me
ters to help Stanford to the 2000
NCAA outdoor track title, as well as
anchoring Stanford's world
record-setting distance medley
relay team.
A consistent and tough competi
tor, Riley made his 2001 track sea
son even better than the previous
years'.
Starting with a 7:48.79 in the
3,000 meters in the indoor season
— the fourth fastest collegiate time
in history — Riley was just gett ing
warmed up.
In his first ever 10,000-meter
race, Riley ran a 28:33.71, the sec
ond-fastest time in the nation that
years.
Things did not go as well in the
10,000 meters at the NCAA
Championships, where he placed
10th.
Riley was sitting near the back of
the pack midway through the 5,000
meters just two days later, and spec
tators unaware or Riley's race strat
egy feared another disappointing
finish.
Instructed by coach Vin Lanan
na to lay back for the first two miles,
Riley "felt comfortable sitting in the
pack. I was going in with no expec
tations, like a weight was off my
shoulders."
When the leaders broke from
the main pack, Riley went with
them, eventually passing the race

favorites in a dramatic final 100
meters for the NCAA title.
Riley has run with some of
Stanford's greatest all-time run
ners, in addition to being one of
them.
He says he has been inspired by
senior Gabe Jennings's passion for
racing and by alumnus Brad
Hauser's model of consistency and
hard work.
"When he got to the starting
line, you knew he was going to get
the job done," said Riley of Mauser.
"He showed what it means to go out
there and compete even when
you're not having your best day."
Riley has exemplified that
competitiveness and passed it on
to the new generation of Stanford
runners.
"He runs so well consistently
and he's so tough mentally,"
said sophomore lan Dobson.
"He's the epitome of a tough
competitor, showing that not
everything has to be perfect to
run well."
As evidence, Riley ran a
13:40.52 in the 5,000 meters with
nobody to push him in his first race
of this season. It was his first colle
giate race of the season after being
forced to sit out the cross country
and indoor track seasons due to el
igibility reasons.
Riley has been an invaluable
contributor to some of Stanford's
most spectacular, and unexpect
ed, victories.
Whether toppling defending
champion Arkansas in cross
country in 1997, winning the Na
tional Outdoor Track Champi
onship in 2000, or surprising
everyone with a victory in the
2001 Pacific 10 Conference
Championships, Riley has been a
point-scorer and a leader.
Repeating as conference cham
pions will be no easy task for the
Cardinal, but Riley's view of the
team's aggressive training schedule
and early-season success has him
optimistic.
"The Pac-10 championships are
the measure of how good a com
plete team is, and this year's team is
better across the board than it's ever
been," Riley said.

quickly for Riley. In track that year, he was the top
ranked true freshman in the nation in the 5,000 me
ters. As a sophomore, he placed ninth at the N(A\
Cross Country Championships.
Though he redshirted what
would have been his sophomore
track season, Riley continued to im
prove.
His time of 13 minutes, 36.69
seconds in the 5,000 meters that
year remains his personal best to
this day, and that race at the Cardi
nal Invitational stands out as a mile
stone in his career.
"That 13-second breakthrough
in the [5,000-meters] showed I
could make it," Riley said.
"There's a big difference between
guys running 14 minutes and
guys in the 13:30'5. Doing that as a
sophomore got me tired up."
Riley continued to deliver huge
performances when they mattered
most, placing fifth in the 5,000 me
ters to help Stanford to the 2000
NCAA outdoor track title, as well as
anchoring Stanford's world
record-setting distance medley
relay team.
A consistent and tough competi
tor, Riley made his 2001 track sea
son even better than the previous
years'.
Starting with a 7:48.79 in the
3,000 meters in the indoor season
— the fourth fastest collegiate time
in history — Riley was just gett ing
warmed up.
In his first ever 10,000-meter
race, Riley ran a 28:33.71, the sec
ond-fastest time in the nation that
years.
Things did not go as well in the
10,000 meters at the NCAA
Championships, where he placed
10th.
Riley was sitting near the back of
the pack midway through the 5,000
meters just two days later, and spec
tators unaware or Riley's race strat
egy feared another disappointing
finish.
Instructed by coach Vin Lanan
na to lay back for the first two miles,
Riley "felt comfortable sitting in the
pack. I was going in with no expec
tations, like a weight was off my
shoulders."
When the leaders broke from
the main pack, Riley went with
them, eventually passing the race

favorites in a dramatic final 100
meters for the NCAA title.
Riley has run with some of
Stanford's greatest all-time run
ners, in addition to being one of
them.
He says he has been inspired by
senior Gabe Jennings's passion for
racing and by alumnus Brad
Hauser's model of consistency and
hard work.
"When he got to the starting
line, you knew he was going to get
the job done," said Riley of Mauser.
"He showed what it means to go out
there and compete even when
you're not having your best day."
Riley has exemplified that
competitiveness and passed it on
to the new generation of Stanford
runners.
"He runs so well consistently
and he's so tough mentally,"
said sophomore lan Dobson.
"He's the epitome of a tough
competitor, showing that not
everything has to be perfect to
run well."
As evidence, Riley ran a
13:40.52 in the 5,000 meters with
nobody to push him in his first race
of this season. It was his first colle
giate race of the season after being
forced to sit out the cross country
and indoor track seasons due to el
igibility reasons.
Riley has been an invaluable
contributor to some of Stanford's
most spectacular, and unexpect
ed, victories.
Whether toppling defending
champion Arkansas in cross
country in 1997, winning the Na
tional Outdoor Track Champi
onship in 2000, or surprising
everyone with a victory in the
2001 Pacific 10 Conference
Championships, Riley has been a
point-scorer and a leader.
Repeating as conference cham
pions will be no easy task for the
Cardinal, but Riley's view of the
team's aggressive training schedule
and early-season success has him
optimistic.
"The Pac-10 championships are
the measure of how good a com
plete team is, and this year's team is
better across the board than it's ever
been," Riley said.

Senior Jonathon Riley captured a Pac-10 cross country title in his final sea
son at the Farm. Last Saturday at the US Open held at Stanford he ran the
fifth-fastest mile in school history.
He's an NCAA champion, a world-record holder a
14 time All-American, and he's not done yet.
Senior Jonathon Riley has, no doubt, been one of
the most decorated and successful runners in Stanford
history.
A studio art major, Riley says he may possibly design
racing shoes one clay.
But for the time being, he races in other people's de
signs, and does so extremely well.
Making an impact since day one on the Farm, Riley
helped the cross country team to its 1997 national
championship in his freshman season.
As the team's fifth and final scorer, Riley's contribu
tion was crucial, since it allowed Stanford to edge rival
Arkansas by three points.
"[Running at the NCAA meet] was definitely

something I was working toward," Riley said. "I had
been running varsity but not scoring all season. To
have my best race of the season at nationals and be
part of a national championship my freshman year,
1 was very fortunate."
With his tremendous freshman season, Riley made
the tough transition to the college level, something that
not all star high school runners are able to do.
"I came into college being successful, but I knew
college would be a whole other level and it would
like a lot to reach that," he said. "1 knew with the
right coaching and training, things would work out
the right way."
Things started working out the right way veiy
quickly for Riley. In track that year, he was the top
ranked true freshman in the nation in the 5,000 me
