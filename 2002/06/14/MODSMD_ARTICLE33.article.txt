# Safety Williams leads Card defense
## 
### ANTHONY LEE STAFF WRITER 
In one of college football's most memorable
games this season, a safety named Williams
dashed past opposing offensive linemen on a
blitz and lunged at a superstar quarterback
playing in one of America's most hostile stadi
ums.
He hit the signal-caller's arm and caused the
ball to flutter in the air and into the hands of an
awaiting defender.
It was a play that spurred his team to victory
and thrust it into the national spotlight. A pho
tograph of the play even appeared in Sports Il
lustrated.

Surely, everyone knows by now that the free
safety was a Cardinal named lank (not Okla
homa's Roy), the quarterback was Oregon's
Joey Harrington (not Texas' Chris Simms), the
defender was Stanford's Marcus Hoover (not
C)klahoma's Teddy Lehman) and the venue was
Autzen Stadium (not the Cotton Bowl).
Eerily similar to Roy's play earlier this year,
Tank's spectacular effort in Stanford's improba
ble 49-42 upset of the Ducks took place amidst
much less hoopla.
ABC broadcaster Brent Musburger did not
lobby for it to appeal on magazine covers. ESPN
did not replay it continuously. Columnists did
not proclaim it to be the greatest play they had
seen in years.

And senior free safety Tank Williams did not
care. In fact, being unrecognized is the story of
his life.
"I feel like I was definitely overlooked out of
high sch(X)l because of an injury," said Williams,
who was hardly recruited.
Many coaches are probably wondering how
they let a ferocious 112 ree satiety with a linebacker's
size, a cornerback's speed and a too-good-to-be
true personality fly under the radar.
"He certainly was a steal out of high school,"
Stanford defensive coordinator Kent Baer said.
"Nobody knew about him."
Luckily for Stanford, assistant coach Phil
Zacharias discovered the hidden treasure along
the gulf coast of Mississippi.
If the soft-spoken Williams thought that life
in Palo Alto was faster than what he was accus
tomed to in his "laid-back" town when he first
arrived on the Farm, he quickly realized how
fast the action was on the field when he played
as a true freshman.
"My first year out on the field, I was running
around like a chicken with my head cut off,"
Williams said. "I wasn't able to read the offenses
that well because I did not know the defensive
schemes as well as I do now."
From a true freshman who was thrown into
the water and told to stay afloat while learning
various schemes and defensive subtleties,
Williams has transformed into a senior defen
sive anchor and leader.
"My experience has helped me the most in
becoming better," Williams said. "1 can now go
out and play more confidently because 1 don't
have to think as much on the field now."
After having a breakthrough season last year
with three interceptions, Williams was tagged to
have a spectacular senior season, and the Jim
Thorpe Award candidate has lived up to his
billing.
During Stanford's 54-37 victory at Arizona,
Williams displayed his full defensive repertoire.
Not only did he intercept his fourth pass of
the season, Williams also sacked Wildcat quar
terback Jason Johnson and caused him to fum
ble, enabling fellow free-safety prospect Coy
Wire to return the ball 89 yards fora touch-
