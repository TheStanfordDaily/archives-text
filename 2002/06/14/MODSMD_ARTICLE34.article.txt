# Ripple, Foschi make a splash for Stanford
## 
### CLARA SHIH STAFF WRITER 
The Pac-10 Championships in Long Beach,
Calif, are just two weeks away and Ripple and
Foschi are top-ranked nationally in the 200 but
terfly and 500 freestyle, respectively, and are
heavily favored to win those events and others at
the NCAA Championship Meet from March 21
to March 23 in Austin, Texas.
But NCAA's are nothing new for either Foschi
or Ripple. They have qualified with the"A" stan
dard every collegiate season they have competed.
Foschi is the reigning NCAA champion in the 500
freestyle and notched her 17th consecutive win in
the event last week against Southern California.
She also grabbed runner-up in the 1650 freestyle
at last year's NCAA championship meet.
Ripple too, is a NCAA champion in the 200
yard and 400 medley relays. During her senior
season, she's qualified for the NCAAs in 11 events
including the 200 butterfly and the 200 medley
relay
"Whether in competition or practice, Shelly
and Jess step up to get the job done in critical sit
uations," said head coach Richard Quick. "I
wouldn't have to be paid to coach Jessica Foschi
and Shelly Ripple."
A native New Yorker, Foschi began swimming
at age four with siblings Pam, J.P. and Christian
during summers at the family's Manhasset coun
try club. Foschi has fond memories of her early
swimming days at the country club.
"I would lay my bathing suit out the night
before the championships at the end of the
summer," said Foschi. "I got so excited even
t hough it was just to swim one lap. Looking
back at those summers makes me happy. I
understand all over again why I wanted to
swim in the first place."
Foschi is very close to her family and par
ents Bob and Margaret have always been very
supportive. As a child, Foschi played basket
ball, volleyball, lacrosse, and softball. At age
11, however, she began to focus on swim
ming. She joined a local team, the Long Is
land Aquatic Club, and quickly amazed par
ents and coaches with her rapid improve
ment, qualifying for junior nationals in 1993
and U.S. nationals in spring 1994. The next
year, she joined Ripple on the national junior
team in Paris.
Foschi attended Friends Academy in Long Is

land. Although the school had no swim team,
Foschi swam independently at state meets and set
New York state records in the 200 freestyle and
500 freestyle.
"At Stanford, I discovered who I was," Foschi
said. "It translated to the pool. In addition, there
is a lot of team bonding. Even though swimming
is an individual sport, the collegiate experience is
about training with other swimmers and coaches.
That's why swimming here is so great, you swim
more for the team."
Ripple is a native of Baton Rouge, La. Her
athletic success also runs in the family. Her
father, Steve, was a linebacker at Louisianna
State and her mother, Jan, was a professional
triathlete and swam in the 1976 U.S. Olympic
Trials.
She attended Parkview Baptist High School
and was a four-time All-American. Ripple set a
National Independent 1 ligb School record in the
100 backstroke in 1998 and is the holder of more
than 60 state swimming records in Louisiana and
led her high school to four straight champi
onships.
She is one of the top swimmers in the nation

and (he world, and, as she continues to improve
during her final season, she's solidifying her place
among Stanford's all-time Top 10 in seven differ
ent events.
Ripple has a friendly, competitive spirit. She
loves to race and possesses an extremely high
level of determination, which has been her key to
success in so many meets.
Foschi and Ripple have been an unbreak
able force, uniting the unusually large team
this year with their hard work and excellence.
"We all look to Jess and Shelly for inspiration
and dedication,'.' said sophomore Haley Cham
pion.
"I never want to take for granted the great and
consistent job that Jessica Foschi and Shelly Rip
ple always do,"Quick said.
Foschi, a political science major and
human biology minor, is considering law
school. Ripple will be graduating in June with
a degree in communication. Both hope to
participate in the 2004 Summer Olympics in
Athens.
