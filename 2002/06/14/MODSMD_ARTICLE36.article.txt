# Yamasaki moves on after time at Farm
## Senior guard helped women's team to 18-0 Pac-10 finish 
### TERRY HURLBUTT STAFF WRITER 
Stanford senior Lindsey Ya
masaki almost has it all.
Her name permeates the Stan
ford women basketball records.
She's already seventh in school
history for three-pointers made
and 10th in free throw percent
age (.777).
This past weekend in Hawaii,
she became the 22nd Cardinal
player to breach 1,000 career
points — and she's only two weeks
into the season.
The Pacific 10 Conference has
tossed two Honorable Mention
Selections her way, and she
picked up her first gold medal at
the World University Games this
summer.
So far this year, she has led her
team to two consecutive tourna
ment championships in presea
son play at the Stanford Invita
tional and the Rainbow Wahine
Classic, garnering MVP recogni
tion in both.
She's even played in an NCAA
Championship game, albeit in
volleyball.
After choosing to concentrate
solely on basketball, the only
thing missing from Yamasaki's
trophy case is a national champi
onship in basketball. And don't
think she doesn't know it.
"My goal this year is to be on a
national championship team,"
Yamasaki said.
After a few years out of the na
tional spotlight, the No. 7 Cardi
nal is making no secret of its de
sire for big wins in March, and
this senior group, especially Ya
masaki, brings a sense of urgency
to the team and the season.
A resourceful player who can
shift effectively from guard to for
ward, her offense includes a
deadly three-point shot coupled
with penetrating drives to the

hoop. Her skills allow her to be an
offensive threat from anywhere
on the court, as opponents quick
ly realize her versatility.
While known for her offense,
Yamasaki's defensive abilities
cannot be overlooked; she's aver
aging seven rebounds a game,
second only to sophomore for
ward Nicole Powell.
Her defensive contributions
resulted in three steals against
Minnesota this past weekend and
a game-high 10 rebounds Sunday
night against Penn State.
"Lindsey's been playing great
on both ends of the court," said
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer.
While Yamasaki has an impor
tant role in the team's strategy,
her experience and maturity
make her an important leader
both on and off the court.
"I think 1 bring a lot of versatil
ity," Yamasaki said. "I have a lot
of experience and I've gained a
lot of leadership that helps keep
things under control."
Control will be key as Stanford
gears up to face its tough schedule
— preseason competition alone
sees the Cardinal face off against
No. 2 Tennessee on Dec. 16 before
preparing to defend its Pac-10 title.
Yamasaki's composure and talent
will be driving forces behind the
team's march this season.
Although she's made an NCAA
tournmaent appearance in each
of her three years on the Farm,
Yamasaki is ready to go much far
ther and feels that this is the team
to do it.
With national attention begin
ning to focus on the depth of tal
ent on the team, Yamasaki will
count on her teammates to take
the pressure off her and to dis
courage opponents from double
teaming her.
So far Stanford has proven it
self quite capable of that. On Sun
day the attack against the Lady
Lions came from all sides, as five
Cardinal players, including Ya
masaki with 25, scored in double
digits.
"We all get excited — for each

other, for ourselves," said Ya
masaki about her team's chem
istry this year. "Everyone plays,
everyone contributes. It says a lot
about our maturity that everyone
can get in."
Though the senior still hasalot
to accomplish before graduation,
her international play this past
summer hints at some of her post-
Cardinal plans.
Yamasaki's diploma will state
sociology, but "I say basketball is
my major," she said. "I want to
[play], whether ii be overseas or
here, but we'll see."
Yamasaki has quite a tradition
to guide her should she continue
playing after graduation.
Two former Cardinal mem

bers participated on U.S.
Olympic teams, and four were
U.S. National team players. Van-
Derveer coached the squad that
captured the 1996 Olympic gold
medal.
Stanford has also seen an im
pressive 26 players go on to the
pros, including overseas play, the
former American Basketball
League and the WNBA
However, first things first. For
the time being, Yamasaki is look
ing to pack a bit more into her col
legiate career — and her trophy
case — including bringing Stan
ford its third women's basketball
national championship.

ford women basketball records.
She's already seventh in school
history for three-pointers made
and 10th in free throw percent
age (.777).
This past weekend in Hawaii,
she became the 22nd Cardinal
player to breach 1,000 career
points — and she's only two weeks
into the season.
The Pacific 10 Conference has
tossed two Honorable Mention
Selections her way, and she
picked up her first gold medal at
the World University Games this
summer.
So far this year, she has led her
team to two consecutive tourna
ment championships in presea
son play at the Stanford Invita
tional and the Rainbow Wahine
Classic, garnering MVP recogni
tion in both.
She's even played in an NCAA
Championship game, albeit in
volleyball.
After choosing to concentrate
solely on basketball, the only
thing missing from Yamasaki's
trophy case is a national champi
onship in basketball. And don't
think she doesn't know it.
"My goal this year is to be on a
national championship team,"
Yamasaki said.
After a few years out of the na
tional spotlight, the No. 7 Cardi
nal is making no secret of its de
sire for big wins in March, and
this senior group, especially Ya
masaki, brings a sense of urgency
to the team and the season.
A resourceful player who can
shift effectively from guard to for
ward, her offense includes a
deadly three-point shot coupled
with penetrating drives to the

hoop. Her skills allow her to be an
offensive threat from anywhere
on the court, as opponents quick
ly realize her versatility.
While known for her offense,
Yamasaki's defensive abilities
cannot be overlooked; she's aver
aging seven rebounds a game,
second only to sophomore for
ward Nicole Powell.
Her defensive contributions
resulted in three steals against
Minnesota this past weekend and
a game-high 10 rebounds Sunday
night against Penn State.
"Lindsey's been playing great
on both ends of the court," said
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer.
While Yamasaki has an impor
tant role in the team's strategy,
her experience and maturity
make her an important leader
both on and off the court.
"I think 1 bring a lot of versatil
ity," Yamasaki said. "I have a lot
of experience and I've gained a
lot of leadership that helps keep
things under control."
Control will be key as Stanford
gears up to face its tough schedule
— preseason competition alone
sees the Cardinal face off against
No. 2 Tennessee on Dec. 16 before
preparing to defend its Pac-10 title.
Yamasaki's composure and talent
will be driving forces behind the
team's march this season.
Although she's made an NCAA
tournmaent appearance in each
of her three years on the Farm,
Yamasaki is ready to go much far
ther and feels that this is the team
to do it.
With national attention begin
ning to focus on the depth of tal
ent on the team, Yamasaki will
count on her teammates to take
the pressure off her and to dis
courage opponents from double
teaming her.
So far Stanford has proven it
self quite capable of that. On Sun
day the attack against the Lady
Lions came from all sides, as five
Cardinal players, including Ya
masaki with 25, scored in double
digits.
"We all get excited — for each

other, for ourselves," said Ya
masaki about her team's chem
istry this year. "Everyone plays,
everyone contributes. It says a lot
about our maturity that everyone
can get in."
Though the senior still hasalot
to accomplish before graduation,
her international play this past
summer hints at some of her post-
Cardinal plans.
Yamasaki's diploma will state
sociology, but "I say basketball is
my major," she said. "I want to
[play], whether ii be overseas or
here, but we'll see."
Yamasaki has quite a tradition
to guide her should she continue
playing after graduation.
Two former Cardinal mem

bers participated on U.S.
Olympic teams, and four were
U.S. National team players. Van-
Derveer coached the squad that
captured the 1996 Olympic gold
medal.
Stanford has also seen an im
pressive 26 players go on to the
pros, including overseas play, the
former American Basketball
League and the WNBA
However, first things first. For
the time being, Yamasaki is look
ing to pack a bit more into her col
legiate career — and her trophy
case — including bringing Stan
ford its third women's basketball
national championship.

Senior Lindsey Yamasaki pulls up for the jump shot. Yamasaki earned a po
sition on the All Poc-10 First Team this season, leading the Cardinal in scor
ing all season. The women's basketball team swept through the regular sea
son with only one loss but lost in the third round of the NCAA tournament.
