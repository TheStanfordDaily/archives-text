Seven NFCA Ail-American awards.
Thi ee NFCA All-American Scholar Ath
lete awards. Two Academic A1 (-Ameri
cans. Three NFCA National Player of
the Week awards. Fleven All-Pacific 10
Conference team awards. One U.S. Na
tional Team member. The First Cardinal
trip to the College World Series. A total
of 182 victories. Three seniors pursuing
graduate degrees this fall. Four irre
placeable athletes.
This is a sample of the awards,
achievements, and endeavors of the
Stanford Softball senior class.
First baseman Sarah Beeson, right
fielder Jessica Draemel, center fielder
Jessica Mendoza and shortstop Robin
Walker form the class that many de
scribe as the best in Cardinal softball
history.
"They are the class that brought Stan

ford to another level," said junior left
fielder Cassi Brangham. "They helped
make us the team that we are â€” a top
-10 team, a national contender."
Three of these four seniors began
their Cardinal softball careers on a field
absent from the Stanford map, with a
team goal of a .500 season and a head
coach only in his second year at the
helm. Today these same students, with
the integral addition of Draemel as a ju
nior transfer, practice in a stunning sta
dium, boast four consecutive berths to
postseason play and have Stanford soft
ball's first-ever trip to the College World
Series under their belts.
These athletes' accomplishments also
extend to the classroom.
"They epitomize what our program
is about," Brangham said. "Excellent
softball players who are also focused on
their [academics]."
Their Stanford achievements have
helped to create the futures these se
niors will begin this fall.

Walker's outspoken leadership and
commitment over these four years (she
holds the Stanford career record for
most games played) will aid her as she
enters the competitive realm of law
school at UC-Davis.
While Walker sees her future in the
court room, Beeson plans on trading in
her Louisville Slugger fora stethoscope
at the Washington Univ., St Louis Med
ical School, ranked third nationally by
U.S. News and World Report.
Beeson leaves the human biology de
partment at Stanford after Commence
ment, but Mendoza will follow her pas
sion for education here on the Farm
and complete her coterminal master's
degree.
Draemel shares Mendoza's interest in
education and will work on academic
advising programs for student athletes
at Stanford this summer, with the hope
of attending graduate school in the near
future.
Softball offers nothing in lieu of the
WN BA draft or LPGA tour, but that won't
force Beeson and Mendoza to retire just
yet. Both left yesterday for the USA Na
tional Team Training Camp in Chula
Vista, Calif, for the second year in a row.
Mendoza is a returning member of
the national team and Beeson hopes to
join her on the journey to the 2004 Sum
mer Olympics.
"I think we are really going to miss
the seniors' leadership," said junior
pitcher Dana Sorensen. "They are each
a leader in a different way."
Although their immense skill trans
lates automatically into leadership by
example, each of these seniors possess
personalities that have guided the
S f anford softball program to team-fo
cused success beyond individual ac
complishments.
"Robin is a silent leader, one that the
team can count on to always do her job,"
Sorensen said. "Beeson and Mendoza
are more vocal leaders on the field.
Draemel leads through her commit
ment and dedication to hard work."
These four seniors are true scholar
athletes who chose to attend Stanford to
build both their intellect and the softball
program.
"Making the decision to come to
Stanford was a hard one," Mendoza
said. "The program here was so new,

her final season at the Farm.
and compared to many other
programs in the country, il had
not yet established a name for it
self. However, by choosing to
come here, I knew that 1 would be

a part of something very unique.
I would help build a program
rather than just add to a long his
tory of one."
Beeson, Draemel, Mendoza,
and Walker did not join a perenni
al national powerhouse. Instead,
they created one.
