# Weikel-Magden grows into top-flight collegiate wrestler
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Five years ago, Levi Weikel-Magden
walked into the first day of wrestling prac
tice as a nervous, slender 118-pounder.
Now, more confident than ever, 40 pounds
heavier and a member of the All-Academic
Pac-10 First Team, Weikel-Magden is tak
ing it to his competition as Stanford's lone
senior starter.
"I walked in the first day thinking 'What
am 1 doing here?' said Weikel-Magden.
"Not even knowing it, I went toe to toe with
a guy who was a starter at my weight. Since
that clay it's been a slow convincing process,
hut something definitely happened that
first day."
That slow process that got Weikel-Mad

den to where he is now. with a 14-8 record,
two pins and 44.5 team points (third on the
team), actually began much earlier.
"I started wrestling when I was about five
years old," he said. "Some of my fondest
memories and what really got me hooked
on the sport was getting to travel around
with the high school team when I was eight
or nine."
Despite a brilliant high school career,
during which Weikel-Magden captured
three top-five finishes at Oregon's state
championships, wrestling was not initially
part of his future plans.
"1 knew 1 didn't want to go to school and
just be a student, but I'd seen some stellar
athletes go to college and they just didn't
