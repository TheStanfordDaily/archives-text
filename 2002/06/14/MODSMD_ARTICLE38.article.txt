# Weikel-Magden grows into top-flight collegiate wrestler
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Five years ago, Levi Weikel-Magden
walked into the first day of wrestling prac
tice as a nervous, slender 118-pounder.
Now, more confident than ever, 40 pounds
heavier and a member of the All-Academic
Pac-10 First Team, Weikel-Magden is tak
ing it to his competition as Stanford's lone
senior starter.
"I walked in the first day thinking 'What
am 1 doing here?' said Weikel-Magden.
"Not even knowing it, I went toe to toe with
a guy who was a starter at my weight. Since
that clay it's been a slow convincing process,
hut something definitely happened that
first day."
That slow process that got Weikel-Mad

den to where he is now. with a 14-8 record,
two pins and 44.5 team points (third on the
team), actually began much earlier.
"I started wrestling when I was about five
years old," he said. "Some of my fondest
memories and what really got me hooked
on the sport was getting to travel around
with the high school team when I was eight
or nine."
Despite a brilliant high school career,
during which Weikel-Magden captured
three top-five finishes at Oregon's state
championships, wrestling was not initially
part of his future plans.
"1 knew 1 didn't want to go to school and
just be a student, but I'd seen some stellar
athletes go to college and they just didn't

add up. I didn't think that I would
add up."
After getting deferred during
the early decision at Stanford,
Weikel-Madden contacted long
time head wrestling coach Chris
Horpe, now director of wrestling.
As it turned out, Horpel needed
someone at Levi's weight and he
was recruited.
Once at Stanford, Weikel Mad
den's road to success was not easy.
After becoming extremely sick and
dropping several pounds the sum
mer before his sophomore year,
Weikel-Madgen would redshirt
his second season while wrestling
at 133 pounds.
"The next year, I was a small
141-pounder and as a senior, I was
a big 141-pounder," Levi recount
ed. "The biggest jump in weight ac
tually occurred this year, when I
jumped from 141 all the way up to
149 pounds and then 157 pounds."
Weikel-Madden has made the
weight adjustment seem easy and
attributes his success this season to
several factors.
"I finally feel like I'm hitting my
peak physically and I've got a bet

ter attitude," he said. "I'm a senior
and I've got nothing to lose, so I go
out and wrestle that way."
VVeikel-Madden's love for the
sport and willingness to spend
extra hours in the wrestling room
after practice transcended the clif
ficulties he endured during his
first few years on the Farm. Quit
ting never entered his mind. Well,
almost never.
"I think that a serious wrestler
only thinks about quitting when it's
time for morning practice,"
Weikel-Magden said. "11 you're
thinking about it when the sum
mertime comes and you're think
ing it would be so much easier the
next year to not wrestle, then you
probably are going to quit. 1 never
did that."
With a month and a half left in
his final season, Weikel-Madden
refuses to believe he's experi
enced his defining moment at
Stanford.
"Until I wrestle my last match
ever, I'm never going to be satisfied
with what I've done here," he said.
"It'salways going to be in the future
and that's what excites me. It'll be
something that I view when I'm all
done and I look back on my days at
Stanford."
