about 2:45 a.m. CST, under a
steady rain, in the most improbable
of elections, Gore Campaign
Chairman Bill Daly uttered the
most improbable of words: 'Our
campaign continues!' .... More
than an hour after all major net
works had projected Bush as the
winner of Florida, and therefore
the election, Florida officials re
leased figures showing the race to
be too close to call, leading Gore to
retract his earlier concession and
putting the election's outcome in
doubt."
