Hennessy corrects errors in
two letters
I would like to correct a mis
representation made by two let
ters to the Daily regarding the
resolution of the contract negoti
ations between Bon Appetit and
its unionized workers.
University administrators did
not play any role in the negotia
tions between Bon Appetit and its
workers. As Vice Provost Gene
Awakuni has stated, he made Bon
Appetit management aware of
the University's living-wage poli
cy, but he also made it clear that
the University would not inter
fere with the collective bargain
ing process.
When I spoke with the stu
dents camped out in the Main
Quad, I reiterated that 1 would
not become involved in negotia
tions between Bon Appetit and its
workers and that 1 would contin
ue to support and respect the col
lective-bargaining process. 1 also
told the students that 1 believed
collective bargaining was the ap
propriate way to reach a compro
mise on conflicting positions and
that management and the union
were the best parties to resolve
these issues. Given the result of
the negotiations, that appears to
be exactly what happened.
The University continues to
respect the principle of collective
bargaining between manage

ment and workers and reasserts
its long-held position of non-in
terference in that process.

Columbae resident responds to
flag burning
As a resident of Columbae, I'd
like to respond to Matthew Garl
and Amer Ahmed's letter con
cerning the recent tlag burning at
Columbae. First I'd like to point
out that not everyone in Colum
bae was involved in the flag burn
ing, and that this letter represents
only my personal views.
Portraying the participants in
the flag burning as "elated," "de
lighted" and "inebriated" is a ma
nipulative misrepresentation that
reveals your ignorance of what
was happening. No one involved
was drunk, and serious discus
sion of the significance of burning
the flag had taken place during
the preceding week. You say that
these protests make you queasy in
the wake of the Sept. 11 deaths
and destruction.
What nauseates me is that the
U.S. government should use this
tragedy as an excuse to overturn
supposedly inalienable freedoms
by monitoring private communi
cations without consent, to combat
terrorism by dropping bombs on

innocent civilians and twice the
Red Cross, to start a war over evi
dence that has not been revealed to
the public, to increase military
spending and power, and to cast
three countries under the label
"Axis of Evil," with dissent effec
tively squashed by a cultish patrio
tism that seems to hold that our
country was founded on principles
of war, intolerance, revenge and
greed rather than freedom from
unjust persecution.
It is not flag burning that dis
cards the notion of a fair trial as you
suggest in your letter, but rather
our own government, which re
places them with military tribunals.
To us, burning the flag did not
mean spitting on our country's
ideals, but instead protested an ad
ministration which abuses these
ideals to further its own interests
while duping the public with hyp
ocritical hurrahs of patriotism.
In fact, I strongly support the
ideals for which the flag (and our
government along with it) is sup
posed to stand, including the elec
tion of a president by the people,
freedom from unjustified inva
sions of privacy, the right to know
what the government is doing and
why and the right of people
around the world to live free from
baseless persecution at the hands
of an angry government.

Stanford Dining should
not serve veal
This is a letter to express our
concern with Stanford Dining
Services serving veal dishes in
dining halls.
The conditions for animals
who eventually become veal are
among the crudest in the entire
produce industry. People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals,
cites many harsh facts: male
calves are taken from their moth
ers no more than a few days after
birth. Also, they are chained and
kept in darkness for virtually the
entire day. Less than 14 weeks
after they are born, the calves are
finally slaughtered.
Virtually all calves are fed a nu
trient-deficient milk-substitute diet
that is designed to keep them ane
mic, so that their skin turns whiter.
The European Union's Scientific
Veterinary Committee's 1995 Re
port on the Welfare of Calves con
cluded that a diet deficient in essen
tial nutrients such as iron can lead to
serious maladies for calves. Also,
they stilted that calves not provided
solid feed would generally die be
fore adulthood.
In addition, serving veal can pose
a significant health risk to individuals
consuming it. The Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) found more
than a dozen veal production com
panies give calves clenbuterol, a dan
gerous and illegal drug. This sub

stance is used to speed die growth of
calves, by inducing weight gain and
transforming a greater proportion
of muscle to fat. Importandy, even
small amounts of denbuterol am
cause severe illness in humans, in
cluding increased heart rate,
tremors, fever, and possibly death.
Although we understand that the
goal of dining services is to accom
modate the preferences of all stu
dents, we strongly believe that serv
ing veal poses significant ethical and
health hazards to Stanford students.
We strongly urge Stanford Dining
Services to find suitable alternatives
that meet acceptable standards.
Our group is more than willing pro
vide assistance in this regards.

Library cuts harmful
I am writing as the only under
graduate member of the Com
mittee on Libraries and as a con
cerned student to complain about
the University's plans to reduce
hours during dead week and fi
nals week next year.
For those who are not already
aware, the University is cutting its
budget for the next school year in
just about every department, in
cluding the libraries. The libraries'
collective budget will be reduced
by 5 percent, which, in the case of

Green Library, means not only a
hold on hiring but more visible re
ductions in student services such
as the elimination of extended
hours during the final two weeks
of each quarter.
I am sure that many students
will agree with me that these extra
hours (until 2 a.m.) are vital to ef
fective studying.
Not only do many students
need the extra time to use the li
brary's resources to work on re
search and other projects, but they
have come to rely on the library as
a calm, quiet and comforable
haven in which to escape the
dorms and to study in peace.
The University must recognize
that by cutting back the library's
budget — and therefore forcing
the library to cut back on hours —
it is severely curtailing students'
study options during the impor
tant final weeks of each quarter.
I implore other students who
will miss the extended hours to
pressure the University to find
the extra money — and we're not
talking about millions of dollars
— to keep this important aspect
of student life going.
It would be a great sign of the
University's committment to stu
dents to continue to offer this ser
vice even during financially diffi
cult times.
