# NADIRA HIRA
## 
### 
It's been so long since my last Daily by
line that 1 think I'd forgotten how
much each one takes out of me. This
morning, a day alter my original
deadline, I resolved to buckle down and
bring my laptop out to the Oval. Of course,
that assumed that the fog would burn off. At
11, still without sun, I thought, next best
thing, Starbucks. Right.
At 11:15, 1 drove past Starbucks, turned
impulsively onto Page Mill Road, got on
Route 280, and now I'm sitting on a bluff at
I lalf Moon Bay State Beach, watching two
Latino men on my left tease their wives with
the prospect of a dip in the freezing water
and a lesbian couple on my left play with
their three sons, one black and two white.
Days like this are poetry, and their in
herent narratives are better than anything I
could ever hope to conjure up sitting at
home in the dark writing fiction to Count
ing Crows.
Anyone reading this who has not yet said
to himself, "Easy, there, Nadira — the
dark, Adam Dm it/.?" should probably hold
off on the real world. And to those ofyou as
tute enough to ask those obvious questions,
the artist in me cites her journalist counter
part, ever the voice of reality.
I suppose that skepticism — the ever
present worry that, for instance, I will be at
tending wine-and-cheese parties with
hopelessly artificial writer-types in a matter

of years, and love it — speaks to the larger
matter of why Stanford has been so g(x>d
for me. I have loved it for all the obvious
U.S. News & World Report reasons, yes,
but I will remember it fondly decades from
now for the many ways it failed me.
I here was no celebrated, supported,
or often even visible community of artists
here, and that left me in the same place
as many other people desperately trying
to forget the travesty of teenage nature
poets and love story writers. For every
one good poet in the world, I knew about
1,000 would-be creators who made me
certain I didn't want to he a member of
the club.
Thus, at Stanford, I chose to continue
with the writing of writers I thought I
could relate to, which brought me to The
Daily. A few nervous breakdowns and 80-
hour work-weeks later, in the fall of my se
nior - year, I decided I wanted to take some
creative-writing classes. Soon enough, I
realized I wanted to do much more in the
field than take a couple fiction and poetry
writing classes.
Again, any normal person would call
that sad, after all my time at The Daily. I
would call it the best possible path. It is ac
tually what I learned about good journal
ism that most helped me — generally, as
there are certainly some bad days — to
avoid writing awful fiction and poetry

and, more importantly, kept me from
being too writerly, by which I mean, melo
dramatic and crazy.
The lack of a community of artists is, of
course, the failure that is most relevant
here, but, needless to say, there are many
others. There was, in Stanford, an admin
istration, an administrative philosophy,
and a basic academic and institutional di
rection that I have never and likely will
never fully support.
But that is not to say that they are not
worthy of someone's support somewhere.
Moreover, I had to reconcile my lovely,
day-to-day personal Stanford with the
broader goals implicit in the perceptions of
the University as an insular, tech-focused
oasis of luxury liberalism. That challenge
has been an invaluable part of my educa
tion. I love my country. That hardly means
I have to support its policies or its president.
"Life-lesson" does not begin to describe.
Another g(x>d example: 1 came to Stan
ford from a white-collar New York City sub
urb that, though extremely diverse in gen
eral, boasted a grand total of about four In
dian families. I got here, became "South
Asian," realized that didn't really capture
the West Indian aspect of my genealogy, be
came "Indo-Caribbean," and went around
in circles like that from one obsessive Uni
versity group to another — cultural, social
and otherwise — until I. got some sense.

These clays, I'm working on being silent
— quite a task, as anyone who knows me
can attest — and examining my many lu
natic contradictions alone. It is personal de
velopment, rather than a naming of parts
or search for those who are similarly brown,
or similarly tall or similarly neurotic.
Even the scx ial life here gets thrown into
the mix. Stanford's freshman scene being
what it is — dorm-based and hyperactive
— I found myself with the most unlikely
crew of friends, which has actually served
me well. As we've grown up and spread out,
our circles have, too, which leaves us now
with best buds from all sorts of places, many
of them undoubtedly shady, but all perfect
for the proverbial college experience.
And, though I must agree with all those
who've said, through the ages, that Stan
ford doesn't exactly create an ideal situa
tion for romance, I know it's here if you
want it. Even better, the effort of seeking it
out eventually makes you an infinitely
more interesting, often somewhat
cracked, and essentially cool person who
can roll with the punches.
Which brings us back to Half Moon Bay.
John, now behind me, just sold his leed
and-fuel business to Carl across Route 1,
and he's wasting away his day with his
buddy, Paul, enjoying the year off before he
moves up to his new ranch in Oregon. John
came over to compliment me for bringing

my work out to the beach. Four years ago, I
would have looked at him askance and
packed up. Of course, four years ago, I
probably would have been writing in the li
brary, far too edgy a girl tor Starbucks, and
not quite edgy enough for surf, so obvious
ly best in hiding.
John and Paul say congratulations, two
wishes we wouldn't have had if not for an
other major Stanford failure.— namely,
Palo Alto. In fact, 1 so hated it that I'm stay
ing to work awhile; nothing motivates me to
explore the linguistic rationale of the word
"freeway" like University Avenue, and I'm
not quite ready yet to give up the windows
down, speeding-ticket, classic-rock after
noons like this one.
I hope all of this will be for my sister what
it has been for me. Oh, yes, swallow those
sighs of relief. Stanford failed me so beauti
fully that my baby sis has decided to try her
hand at it. Here's to endings and beginnings
and knowing that we're still too young to
end reflection pieces with lines about classic
rock afternoons like this one.

Nadira Hira will graduate with a degree in
English with a creative uniting emphasis in po
etry. Mommy, Lizu rd, Kam and Bay, I love you.
Caneel and Mario, words are not enough. The
rest of the Nadira advisory council — you know
who you are — hugs and kisses. On to bigger
and better things.
