## Summer editor welcomes readers to The Weekly 
### AMANDA CANEVARO EDITORIAL STAFF 
The life cycle at Stanford is divided up
into four phases. Fall, winter and spring
each have their virtues as students con
sume academics, activities and sometimes
relationships in ten-week servings. But as
far as quarters go, summer prevails; it is
the chance to do everything or anything
that doesn't fit into the neatly segmented
academic quarters.
Yes, it's barbecues, baseball and bore
dom, but it's also internships, classes and
research projects, which scatter students

all over the country and world to pursue
opportunities that speak to what drives
them as people. The answer to the übiq
uitous question of "What are you doing
this summer?" will reveal more about a
person than their major, dorm or home
town ever will.
The campus is markedly different over
the summer as the University plays host
to countless conferences, summer camps
and visiting students and scholars. And
this year, Palo Alto and the surrounding
areas have inherited current students,
who in a lean job and internship market,
chose to stay in the area, including a

record number of participants in Stan
ford's Summer Research College.
This newspaper also goes through a
summer metamorphosis as The Stanford
Daily becomes The Stanford Weekly, tra
ditional newspaper format gives way to a
more leisurely magazine layout, and fea
tures, photographs and movie reviews
dominate the pages. Attitudes are altered
as work and play mix and blend during
the summer months, and — as summer
editor — I hope that this paper is a reflec
tion of the distinctness of the summertime.
The Weekly affords those of us with a
penchant for journalism to produce a

summer publication that showcases the
Stanford community, and whether you
are at Stanford for the summer, working
at a camp or interning in Washington,
D.C., I encourage you to submit story
ideas, comments, questions or even just a
hello to me at eic@daily.stanford.edu.
It's summertime, the living is easy and
I hope that you enjoy reading The Week
ly as much as we enjoy producing it.
