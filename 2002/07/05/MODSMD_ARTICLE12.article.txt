# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Maybe soccer can lead to peace in the Middle East 
### BROOK ROSENBAUM GUEST COLUMNIST 
And just as quickly as it burst on to the
scene a month ago, the World Cup is gone.
The tournament captured the world's col
lective attention and Brazil proved why
they still are the masters of "the Beautiful
Game."
Even people in the United States
watched this year, and the U.S. team per
formed unexpectedly well — so well, in fact,
that soccer might even pass midget-tossing
and lumberjack competitions in the pan
theon of American sports.
Will soccer really catch on in the United
States, this time? Will the U.S. team build
from this success and field a contending
team for the 2006 World Cup in Germany?
I'll let others take up that subject. In
stead, I'd like to use this space to propose
another lesson that the whole world could
learn from the World Cup: Instead of using
suicide bombers, mortar fire and machine
guns as the tools for solving international
disputes, we should use soccer.
The paradigm case for this proposal is
the Israeli-Palestinian saga. Look, the en
tire planet has watched these two groups
grapple over control of the strip of desert
between the Mediterranean Sea and the
Jordan River for decades. Both sides have
blood on their hands, and it goes without
saying that no end to the bloodletting is in
sight. I think I speak for all mankind when
I say this "war" is starting to get a bit hack
neyed. We are tired of this violent soap
opera and we are ready to move on.
To this end, I propose that the two sides
get together and decide the issue in a win
ner-take-all soccer match. Ridiculous,
right? Just hear me out.
First, we'd have to figure out who would
play on the team. We'd start by having Ariel

Sharon and Yasser Arafat tend their re
spective goals. After that, we'd fill the
squads with key figures on both sides. The
Israelis would have Shimon Peres, Ben
jamin Netanyahu and Ehud Barak among
others. The Palestinians would field a team
of.. .Uh-oh.. .I'm not sure I know any
other Palestinian officials. Are there any?
We'll have to look in to that.
Anyway, the teams wouldn't be limited
to their own government officials. The Is
raelis could probably get Donald Rumsfeld,
Colin Powell and Paul Wolfowitz. The
Palestinians could use Saddam Hussein,
leaders of Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Fatah,
and they could bring Osama Bin Laden in
from off the bench if anybody ever figures
out where he is.
Sure, some of these folks probably aren't
in the best shape of their lives, and there'd
be at least a few heart attacks ("Cheney goes
down untouched againlU Oh, and this time
he will get a yellow card— just as soon as
they get his heart started up again.") But if
people have to die to resolve this squabble,
maybe it should be those who make the de
cisions instead of 19-year-olds. Just a
thought.
Anyway, back to the action. The game
would have to take place in a neutral site ...
let's say, Switzerland. And we'd have to find
a neutral officiating crew ... how about,
the Swiss.
The game would generate a huge
amount of revenue. The broadcasting
rights alone would fetch in the billions. All
of this money could be applied to rebuild
ing the area's infrastructure, monuments
and businesses that have been devastated in
recent years.
In the end, it probably wouldn't even
matter who won. The outcome would in-
