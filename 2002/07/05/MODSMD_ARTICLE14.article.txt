# DISPATCHES FROM THE OUTER DARKNESS
## Summertime, and the living is queasy 
### MARK GANEK STAFF COLUMNIST 
Now that the majority of students have
departed like rats from a sinking ship, we
hardy summer-dwellers can now roll up our
metaphorical sleeves and get down to busi
ness: survival. Hie campus has suddenly be
come awash in an unfamiliar stew of tourists,
prospective students and summer camps, and
the social scene seems a desolate moonscape.
Of course, it only seems that way. In re
ality it is much, much worse. On the moon,
at least they had a dune buggy. Consider
this column your survival guide.
So who am I to give advice? I am a veter
an of three Stanford summers, and they
have changed me. Partially scarred and
partially enhanced by the experience, the
summer's peculiar mix of ennui and self
discovery becomes your harsh mistress, the
honey-voiced Siren, calling your name.

"Come back to me, Roy," she sings. Perhaps
your name is not Roy. Soon it will be. Soon
it will be.
1 don't mean for this to be all sulfur and
brimstone, but you must be warned. Severed
from society, even more severely than is
usual for Stanford, you begin to inhabit your
own island reality. Ensconced in this solipsis
tic universe, your personality begins to exag
gerate itself along with your bad habits.
If you are a smoker, by the end of the
summer you will be a chain-smoker. If you
are a nail-biter, you fingers will be ragged
nubs. Ifyou are into hard drugs, you will be
dead. You must recognize that by staying
on campus, you are not only flirting with
disaster, you have bought her a drink and
are gazing soulfully into her eyes.
But is there no hope? When I find myself
in a difficult situation, I look to history for
guidance. Studying the lives of
many important historical fig
ures, one immense commonali
ty inevitably strikes me: they are
all dead. It's true. George
Washington, Napoleon, Gand
hi. Dead, dead, and dead. His
tory is a dangerous place. It is a
good thing you do not live
there. Since you are at Stanford
instead, you may have a fight
ing chance.
My advice is to find arbitrary
projects and work maniacally
upon them. Become politically
informed, despite the moral
vertigo that comes from gazing
at the frothing chaos of the
world from your comfortable
perch. It may raise unpleasant

questions such as, "Does it
make me a bad person to live so
comfortably while a vast major
ity of the world lives in poverty
and political repression?" Of
course it does. Deal with it.
Write some really horren
dous poetry. Study an obscure
historical epoch. Argue with
hippies. Realize that arguing
with hippies is hopeless and
scoff at them instead. There are
rich opportunities before you,
gentle reader.
So go forth and frolic in the
sun-dappled fields of your
mind, and keep with you the
immortal words of Benjamin
Franklin, "I am being devoured
by worms." Ckkxl luck, Roy.
