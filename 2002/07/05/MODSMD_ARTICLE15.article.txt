## 'Pledge' ruling really a fair interpretation of the law 
### JOSEPH L. LEMON, JR. STAFF COLUMNIST 
Boy, people sure got bent out of shape
when the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
handed down its opinion last week holding
the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional
and therefore unfit to be recited every
morning in public schools.
I confess that I was among the shocked
observers who couldn't believe that the
brief phrase "under God" was sufficiently
religious to violate the portion of the First
Amendment on which the principle of
separation of church and state is based.
And, while the court might have lost some
popularity as a result of this decision, the
fact is that it probably did get the law
right.
The First Amendment's Establishment
Clause asserts that "Congress shall make
no law respecting an establishment of reli
gion." On its face, the Pledge's reference to
"God" hardly seems to rise to the level of
"establishing a religion."
Furthermore, the Pledge would initial
ly appear to pass the Supreme Court's
Lemon test, which requires that a govern
mental action must have a secular pur
pose, must not either advance or inhibit a
religion and must avoid governmental en
tanglement with religion. And, even

though the pledge mentions God,
shouldn't some allowance be made for the
fact that the mention is practically a histor
ical cultural icon?
Eighty-seven percent of Newsweek read
ers polled thought so, and so did 99 U.S.
Senators who voted in favor of a resolution
supporting the pledge on the day after the
court's ruling came down. While most of us
may appreciate God in the pledge, that
doesn't make it constitutional. In fact, the
Bill of Rights and most other constitutional
guarantees exist to protect the very minori
ty that is unable to stand up for itself in the
political process.
A little investigation reveals how the
pledge violates the Establishment Clause.
The phrase "under God" was not added
until 1954, after a lobbying campaign
spearheaded by the Knights of Colum
bus, a men's Catholic civic organization,
in response to the threat of Communist
atheism.
In fact, when President Dwight D.
Eisenhower signed the act amending the
pledge to include "under God," he pro
nounced: "From this day forward, the mil
lions of our school children will daily pro
claim in every city and town, every village
and rural schoolhouse, the dedication of
our Nation and our people to the
Almighty." Not only does that make the

pledge seem a lot less ancient, it also
demonstrates that the reference to God is
much more than incidental.
The ruling is noteworthy not because it
merely prohibits its compelled recitation,
which has long been held unconstitution
al, but because it invalidates saying the
pledge in schools altogether. It should be
noted, though, that the court's ruling is
currently binding only on several western
states and the decision has been stayed
pending appeal.
In this case, the distinction between
the pledge and references to God in gov
ernmental or other civic functions ("In
God We Trust," "God Bless America,")
makes all the difference. The dictionary
defines a pledge as a "solemn, binding
promise," which is certainly more mean
ingful than shoving a dollar bill into a
vending machine.
Even though students are not "forced"
to recite the Pledge of Allegiance, as the
court's opinion points out, being sur
rounded by others who are reciting it pre
sents an objecting student with "the unac
ceptable choice between participating and
protesting."
The ironies surrounding the pledge and
this decision abound. First, the pledge was
first written in 1892 by Francis Bellamy, a
socialist clergyman.

Although he probably would have not
resisted the reference to God in the pledge,
by the time it was adopted in the height of
the Cold War, he surely would have been
run out of town by McCarthyites, because
his politics were probably more aligned
with Karl Marx than Eisenhower.
Second, the appeals court that decided
this case has been branded as a liberal insti
tution because of its controversial rulings
and the fact that 17 of the 23 active judges
were appointed by Democratic presidents.
However, the author of the opinion, Alfred
T. Goodwin, is actually a senior judge who
was chosen by Richard Nixon.
Finally, the plaintiff who challenged the
pledge, Michael Newdow of Sacramento,
has received numerous death threats for
asserting his constitutional rights. Appar
ently the people who want to keep God in
the pledge are willing to kill for it.
God is great and merciful, and probably
more appropriately relevant in our daily
lives than ever since Sept. 11. But, unfor
tunately, He just doesn't belong in the
Pledge of Allegiance.
