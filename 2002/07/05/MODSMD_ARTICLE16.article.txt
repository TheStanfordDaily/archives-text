# Remember 'liberty and justice for all' on Independence Day
## 
### MARK BOUCHER EDITORIAL STAFF 
Certainly we all celebrated In
dependence Day a little differently
yesterday. The fireworks were just
as brilliant and the potato salad was
just as tasty, but something was un
doubtedly sticking in the back of
our minds. Last year's terrorist at
tacks have been indelibly burned
into our memories.
Not surprisingly, they tend to be
remembered more strongly when
we commemorate the United
States. Now, with nearly a year
gone by, we can begin to see that
bleak day with a different perspec
tive. We can begin to see even
more clearly how the basic con
cepts that lie at the heart of this
great country were attacked.
'fhe people who died in Man
hattan, Virginia and Pennsylvania
in September were defending
American values just as much as
the Continental Army soldiers who
perished at Valley Forge, or the
Union soldiers who died on the
Civil War battlefield of Antietam or
the Navy cadets who died at Pearl
Harbor. Through their lives, those
3,000 civilians showed the results
of, as the Pledge of Allegiance says,
"liberty and justice for all."
fhe American idea of liberty is
simple: We the people have certain
inalienable rights and the govern

ment has specific and limited pow
ers. This idea was revolutionary
when the Founding Fathers intro
duced it, and it is still critically im
portant today. As a result, we are
free to speak, worship, and travel
as we please. Terrorists find our
many freedoms repugnant and
threatening, but Americans cannot
imagine life without them.
Americans treasure the idea of
justice just as strongly. Ideally, we
treat everyone equally and fairly.
The Constitution says that no
group should be favored for pref
erential treatment and no group
should be intentionally shunned.
The courts and the government
are accessible to anyone.
We have tremendous resources
rightly devoted to ending the ves
tiges of historic discrimination
against various groups of people.
Americans are tolerant of those
who are different in race, color,
creed or personality. And we con
sistently welcome immigrants from
around the world.
These ideals of liberty and jus
tice fit perfectly with the people
who died on Sept. 11. By living and
prospering in our democratic sys
tem, they became the products of
these values. American creativity
and American hard work — made
possible by our traditions of liberty
and justice — built the World
Trade Center and the Pentagon,

and they built the businesses and
military that filled their vast offices.
The people who worked there:
free, just, successful and content
people, were just as much the results
of these ideals. In this way, they died
defending these great values.
Against their choice, they became
soldiers for these noble causes.
The constant application and re
finement of "liberty and justice for
all" over the past 226 years has cre
ated a great nation. It has created
the richest nation in the world, one
where we can provide for the basic
needs of all inhabitants. It has cre
ated a diverse country where peo
ple of all races and religions can
live, work and prosper together.
It has created a land of equal op
portunity for many, where hard
work and ingenuity can lead to
success. It has created a nation of
people with faith in the future.
By creating these things, it has
created a nation that all its citizens
can be immensely proud of and
grateful for. And therefore, it has
created a nation that will not fold
under a brutal attack on its build
ings, its people or its values.
