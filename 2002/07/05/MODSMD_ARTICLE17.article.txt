## Frustrating losses send Cardinal home early Cardinal falls to Texas twice as seniors fail to capture national title in four consecutive trips to College World Series 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER AARON LEVINE STAFF WRITER 
It wasn't supposed to end this way, on this night.
But it did.
With a 6-5 loss to the Texas Longhorns at the College World
Series on June 20, six Cardinal seniors completed their
tremendous run at Stanford short of their ultimate goal for the
fourth consecutive season.
The Cardinal (47-18) bowed out of the 2002 CWS with their
second one-run loss to Texas (56-15) this year in Omaha, as ju
nior Jason Cooper grounded into a 3-6-3 double play to end
the ballgame with the team's unofficial captain, senior Chris
O'Riordan, waiting in the on-deck circle.
"It was a little frustrating, but it's no different than sitting on
the bench with everyone else," O'Riordan said. "I wanted a shot
at the end, but it just didn't work out that way."
Down one run heading to the bottom of the ninth, many
Stanford faithful expected to see the same magic that has char
acterized the Cardinal program during the tenure of O'Rior
dan 8c Co. But this time, things went poof instead.
After a leadoff bunt single by sophomore All-America first
teainer Sam Fuld, sophomore Ryan Carko lined a ball to deep
center field but the Longhorns' Kalani Napoleon tracked it
down for the first out. Four pitches later, Texas closer Huston

Street picked up his 13th save by getting Cooper to ground to
first baseman Jeff Ontiveros to start the twin killing that also
killed the 2002 Stanford season.
Cardinal ace Jeremy Guthrie, a first-team 2002 All-America
with Fuld, suffered his second loss of the year and his first in the
postseason all-time, allowing six runs (four earned) in 6 1/3 in
nings while working on four days' rest.
Guthrie battled the Longhorns with sub-par stuff that
showed the wear and tear of a Stanford record 157 2/3 innings
pitched and short rest, but he exhibited the guts and toughness

that defined his two-year Cardinal career.
"He wanted the ball today, and that's a credit to
him," said head coach Mark Marquess of Guthrie.
"He gave us everything he's got, and he gave us a

chance to win. It just wasn't meant to be.'
The contest's deciding blow came in
the seventh on what would be a final
pitch not worthy of Guthrie's superb
collegiate career. Longhorn left fielder

Dustin Majewski reached down to take a 3-0 fastball
into the right-center field seats and give Texas the 6-5
lead.
"Guthrie was really dealing on us fora while," On

tiveros said. "We talked about how we needed to hit
his mistakes, and sure enough we did."

While Guthrie's fastball to Majewski was a solid

pitch down low—despite clocking in at 88 m.p.h.,

about five below his average velocity—On

tiveros took the junior ace's biggest mistake

several rows deep in left field in the fifth

to give Texas a 5-3 lead.

pitch later to drive in a run. Next, on a 2-2 slider hung up in the
zone, Ontiveros made Guthrie pay with a two-run blast that
shifted momentum to the Longhorns and spoiled what could
have been a heroic outing for Guthrie on his first wedding an
niversary.
"I didn't have the mental toughness tonight," Guthrie said,
stifling back tears. "I just didn't come up with the big pitches,
and I got beat."
Stanford opened the scoring early, getting a leadoff home
run in the bottom of the first inning from freshman Chris
Carter. Later, RBI singles from seniors O'Riordan and Scott
Dragicevich gave the Cardinal an early 3-0 advantage and had
the Longhorns sweating with Guthrie on the hill.
But a costly error in the top of the second by the celebrated
Stanford infield allowed the storybook ending to unravel. With
two outs and the bases empty, the sure-handed Dragicevich
stayed back on a hard grounder to third, mishandling it and
opening the door fora two-run, two-out Texas rally.
"I think I let it eat me up," Dragicevich said of the ground
ball. "It took a funny hop, and I should have caught it before it
took that hop."
Despite being regarded as one of the most talented infields
ever in college baseball for consistently making spectacular
plays appear routine, it was the botched routine play on Thurs
day that kept the Cardinal from doing something spectacular,
like coming out of the loser's bracket to win the national cham
pionship.
Guthrie threw 18 pitches after the error before the end of the
second, contributing to his loss of gas in the seventh and the
Majewski homer that provided the winning Longhorn margin.
"I got beat in that [second] inning after the error, and I got
beat in the fifth," Guthrie said. "It was tough for me, and it was
unfortunate that I couldn't do better."

On June 20, Jeremy Guthrie sat at the
postgame press conference with his heart
in his throat. The junior pitcher struggled
to hold back his tears, fighting to force the
words from his mouth.
It was a scene all too reminiscent of three
weeks ago when, following a gritty 13-in
ning victory in an NCAA Regional opener

over Cal State-Fullerton,
Guthrie had recalled pon
> dering the prospect of
that game being his last.
But this time, there was no

pondering.
This time, when Guthrie spoke
about the Cardinal's 6-5 loss to Texas

at the College World Series, there

was a sense of finality. A sense of
emptiness. And a sense of "never

coming back."

It is safe to say that
Guthrie will not be back next

year. As a first-round pick by

the Cleveland Indians, it is
unlikely that Guthrie will

pass up another multi
. million dollar contract

to return as Stanford's

ace on the mound.

And Guthrie
won't be the
only one miss

ing. The six se

niors—first baseman Arik VanZandt, sec
ond baseman Chris O'Riordan, shortstop
Andy Topham, third baseman Scott Drag
icevich, and pitchers Dan Rich and J.D.
Wilcox—will also be gone, and so will the
talent, leadership and responsibility that
these players brought to the table.
Yet, on a night when disappointment
overwhelmed the Cardinal clubhouse—a
night when "unfinished business" re
mained unfinished—Guthrie, who swal
lowed his pride and admitted his stuff
wasn't the best when Stanford needed it
the most, seemed to be a perfect
spokesman for everyone on the team.
"I feel like I got beat physically and men
tally," said Guthrie, a candidate for the
Golden Spikes Award given to the nation's
best player. "It was tough for me, and it's
unfortunate that I couldn't throw the
pitches."
Pitching on only four days of rest for just
the second time this year, Guthrie, who fin
ished this season with a 13-2 record and a
2.51 ERA, tired sooner than he normally
had. But despite conceding a three-run
homer to the Longhorns' Jeff Ontiveros,
and despite giving up the winning run on a
solo shot by Dustin Majewski in the seventh
inning, there was no question that Guthrie
