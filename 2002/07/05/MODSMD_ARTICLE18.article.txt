# Jacobsen and Borchardt skip senior year for NBA
## 
### ARISHA HATCH STAFF WRITER 
The speculation began four months ago.
It was Senior Day.
However, as Stanford seniors Tony Gio
vachini and Kyle Logan greeted their
mothers at half court with roses and kisses,
two other potential and much more signifi
cant farewells lingered secretly in the minds
of Sixth Man Club members, although no
one wanted to admit it.
Admitting it might make it real — ignor
ing it was the best option at that time.
But as junior swingman Casey Jacobsen
fouled out of Stanford's 95-92 loss to UCLA
with less than a minute left to play in front
of a capacity Maples Pavilion crowd and a
national CBS television viewing audience,
the hopes of Sixth Man Club members bel
lowed without restraint as the hearts of the
Cardinal faithful who begged in vain for the
return of Jacobsen and junior center Curtis
Borchardt.
"One more year," they chanted in uni
son. "One more year."
Stanford fans had every reason to hope
that "one more year" was a possibility for
this team.
With "one more year," redemption —
rather than rebuilding —would be the sea
sonal theme. With "one more year," not so
distant memories of a Cardinal ranked atop
the NCAA standings could become a thing
of the present. Ancl with "one more year,"
the ever-tantalizing and unrealized dream
of a Final Four appearance seemed more
and more attainable.
Rumors engulfed the campus as both
Borchardt and Jacobsen announced their
respective decisions to test the waters of
the draft. The decisions of each man not
to hire an agent left open the possibility of
a return to the Farm for their senior cam
paign, offering a glimmer of hope to Stan

ford fans.
Speculation as to whether Borchardt
would leave his fiancee Susan King, who
still has two years of NCAA eligibility re
maining, lent itself to the possibility of his
return, while Jacobsen's questionable first
round draft status left open the window for
more talk.
But all talk ended on June 19th when
both Jacobsen and Borchardt opted to stay
in the draft, making them ineligible to par
ticipate in their remaining year of NCAA
competition.
Jacobsen announced during a telecon
ference from New Jersey that: "I'm going to
stay in the draft. I've worked too hard not
to take a shot. My workouts have went too

well too ignore. I talked to a lot of people in
the NBA and I asked them, 'If I need to go
back to school yon need to tell me,'" Jacob
sen said. "Not one single coach, GM, or
NBA person told me to go back to school."
Borchardt's decision to stay came after
Jacobsen's. Borchardt said that he became
more comfortable with the idea of leaving
Stanford after working out with a few
teams.
Technically it was all over then, but less
than a week later on June 25th the hammer
was nailed into the coffin as Borchardt was
announced as the 18th pick by the Orlando
Magic. The 7-foot-1 center was expected by
many to be a lottery pick, but fell five spots
out of the top-13, most probably because of

his past foot problems. The Magic quickh
traded him to the Utah Jazz for the No. K
pick Ryan Humphrey from Notre Dame
and the No. 47 pick Jamal Sampson frorr
California.
The trade will reunite Borchardt witl
fellow Stanford alum Jarron Collins in Sail
Lake City.
Jacobsen also received an invite to Madi
son Square Garden for the N BA Draft, ar
offer extended to only 16 players who art
expected to be picked in the first round. Ja
cobsen attended skeptically. "1 knew I wa>
going to be the last guy there," Jacobsen
told reporters in response to his invite.
But Casey didn't have to wait much
longer than Curtis. He was picked up a few
minutes later at the No. 22 spot, sending
the southern California native to Phoenix
Ariz. Speculation prior to the draft had J a
cobsen heading to the Los Angeles Laker;
as the No. 29 pick, a move that would havt
allowed for another Cardinal reunion and
a chance to play for the 3-peat champior
Lakers who Jacobsen grew up watching.
"If you had told me to rank the teams, 1
would have ranked Phoenix No. 1 /'Jacob
sen said. "Sure, I would have liked to have
gone real high, but money and draft statu*
aside, Phoenix is the place for me. It's me
It's a great, organization and a great place
to live."
The draft may not have gone exactl)
how either man wanted, but things coulci
have been worse. Both Jake anel Borch wil
sign three year guaranteed deals, a feat thai
only six other Stanford players have man
aged, officially dashing Sixth Man Clul:
hopes. Instead, the unanswered cries oft
faithful fan base will inevitably be reincar
nated next season into cheers of gratitude
and well-wishes for Phoenix and Utah-clad
ex-Cardinal players just passing through
town to face the Golden State Warriors in
stead of the Golden Bears.

with less than a minute left to play in front
of a capacity Maples Pavilion crowd and a
national CBS television viewing audience,
the hopes of Sixth Man Club members bel
lowed without restraint as the hearts of the
Cardinal faithful who begged in vain for the
return of Jacobsen and junior center Curtis
Borchardt.
"One more year," they chanted in uni
son. "One more year."
Stanford fans had every reason to hope
that "one more year" was a possibility for
this team.
With "one more year," redemption —
rather than rebuilding —would be the sea
sonal theme. With "one more year," not so
distant memories of a Cardinal ranked atop
the NCAA standings could become a thing
of the present. Ancl with "one more year,"
the ever-tantalizing and unrealized dream
of a Final Four appearance seemed more
and more attainable.
Rumors engulfed the campus as both
Borchardt and Jacobsen announced their
respective decisions to test the waters of
the draft. The decisions of each man not
to hire an agent left open the possibility of
a return to the Farm for their senior cam
paign, offering a glimmer of hope to Stan

ford fans.
Speculation as to whether Borchardt
would leave his fiancee Susan King, who
still has two years of NCAA eligibility re
maining, lent itself to the possibility of his
return, while Jacobsen's questionable first
round draft status left open the window for
more talk.
But all talk ended on June 19th when
both Jacobsen and Borchardt opted to stay
in the draft, making them ineligible to par
ticipate in their remaining year of NCAA
competition.
Jacobsen announced during a telecon
ference from New Jersey that: "I'm going to
stay in the draft. I've worked too hard not
to take a shot. My workouts have went too

well too ignore. I talked to a lot of people in
the NBA and I asked them, 'If I need to go
back to school yon need to tell me,'" Jacob
sen said. "Not one single coach, GM, or
NBA person told me to go back to school."
Borchardt's decision to stay came after
Jacobsen's. Borchardt said that he became
more comfortable with the idea of leaving
Stanford after working out with a few
teams.
Technically it was all over then, but less
than a week later on June 25th the hammer
was nailed into the coffin as Borchardt was
announced as the 18th pick by the Orlando
Magic. The 7-foot-1 center was expected by
many to be a lottery pick, but fell five spots
out of the top-13, most probably because of

his past foot problems. The Magic quickh
traded him to the Utah Jazz for the No. K
pick Ryan Humphrey from Notre Dame
and the No. 47 pick Jamal Sampson frorr
California.
The trade will reunite Borchardt witl
fellow Stanford alum Jarron Collins in Sail
Lake City.
Jacobsen also received an invite to Madi
son Square Garden for the N BA Draft, ar
offer extended to only 16 players who art
expected to be picked in the first round. Ja
cobsen attended skeptically. "1 knew I wa>
going to be the last guy there," Jacobsen
told reporters in response to his invite.
But Casey didn't have to wait much
longer than Curtis. He was picked up a few
minutes later at the No. 22 spot, sending
the southern California native to Phoenix
Ariz. Speculation prior to the draft had J a
cobsen heading to the Los Angeles Laker;
as the No. 29 pick, a move that would havt
allowed for another Cardinal reunion and
a chance to play for the 3-peat champior
Lakers who Jacobsen grew up watching.
"If you had told me to rank the teams, 1
would have ranked Phoenix No. 1 /'Jacob
sen said. "Sure, I would have liked to have
gone real high, but money and draft statu*
aside, Phoenix is the place for me. It's me
It's a great, organization and a great place
to live."
The draft may not have gone exactl)
how either man wanted, but things coulci
have been worse. Both Jake anel Borch wil
sign three year guaranteed deals, a feat thai
only six other Stanford players have man
aged, officially dashing Sixth Man Clul:
hopes. Instead, the unanswered cries oft
faithful fan base will inevitably be reincar
nated next season into cheers of gratitude
and well-wishes for Phoenix and Utah-clad
ex-Cardinal players just passing through
town to face the Golden State Warriors in
stead of the Golden Bears.
