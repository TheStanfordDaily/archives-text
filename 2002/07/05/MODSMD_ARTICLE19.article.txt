# Athletic elite descend on Stanford for U.S. Nationals
## 
### KENNETH GARRETT EDITORIAL STAFF 
Finals were over and school was
out, but the pressure remained as
the country's elite track and field
athletes descended upon Cobb
Track and An gel 1 Field at Stanford
for the U.S. Track and Field Na
tionals held on June 21-23.
With $450,000 in prize money
on the line and, more importantly,,
a chance to compete with Team
USA at the lAAF World Cup in
Madrid, Spain this September, the
country's best came from far and
wide fora chance at glory.
Among the more anticipated
events were the men's and
women's 100-meter sprints.
The world's fastest woman,
Marion Jones, ran a 10.90 this
spring and a 10.98 into a headwind
in the preliminaries, generating
excitement in the crowd as she
lined up for the final sprint.
She delivered an uncharacteris
tically lackluster performance with
a final time of 11.01 that still man

aged to edge out Stanford alumna
and 2001 U.S. 100-meter champi
on Chryste Gaines' time of 11.05.
World Record holder and
Olympic champion Maurice
Green faced his only serious com
petition in 2001 US National
Champion Tim Montgomery.
Sprint legend Michael Johnson
said that Montgomery might have
beat Green with a better start, but
that wasn't to be.
Green had what he thought was
his best start ever, with a reaction
time out of the blocks of 0.113 sec
onds — 0.100 seconds is consid
ered physically impossible and is a
false start. In the end, Green
crossed the line decisively in 9.88 to
Montgomery's 9.89.
As if that wasn't enough enter
tainment, Saturday's record crowd
of 7,178 was treated to quite a show
in the shot-put ring by Olympic sil
ver medalist Adam Nelson. Before
each throw, he walked around in
tight circles, ripped his shirt off,
took deep breaths, turned red in
the face and finally hurled the ball.

His preparation was funny, but
the results were not — at least not
to his competition. On the final
throw of the meet he threw 72 feet,
11 inches for the win, beating
three-time World Champion John
Godina.
As expected, current and for
mer Stanford athletes shone in the
distance events. Rising senior
Louis Luchini placed fifth in the
5000-meter with a time ofl 3:34.18,
while teammate Jonathan Riley
finished close behind in seventh
(13:40.99).
Lauren Fleshman also ran the
5000-meters, coming in ninth
in 15:50.91.
Sara Bei, coming out of a stellar
freshman year on The Farm, won
the U.S. Junior National Tide in
the 3000-meter run in 9:32.98.
Her win allows her to compete with
Team USA at the World Junior
Track and Field Championships in
Kingston, Jamaica later this
month.
Stanford All-American Jesse
Thomas broke the school record in

the 3000-meter steeplechase wit ha
time of 8:35.83, going on to take
12th in the finals with a time of
8:51.66.
In one of the last events, rising
junior Grant Robison was in 6th

place in the 1500-meter for most oi
the race, but a heroic push down
the final stretch bumped him tc
fourth with a time of 3:41.72.
The stage looks set fora prolific
showing in Madrid.
