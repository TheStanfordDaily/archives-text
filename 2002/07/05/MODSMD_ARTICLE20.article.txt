# Cardinal completes quest for eighth consecutive cup
## 
### TERRY HURLBUTT EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Sears Cup is the Holy
Grail of collegiate athletics — and
Stanford's constant claim on it
lias reduced the drama from the
realms of Camelot to the quirks of
Monty Python.
Take this year for example.
Our brave Ted Leland and his
Cardinal Athletic Department,
appropriately humble in spite of
seven previous victories, em
barked on the seemingly impossi
ble (okay, not really impossible,
but it sounds better that way)
quest to bring home the cup for
the eighth straight year.
Awarded to the university with
the best all-around athletic pro
gram in the country, the Sears
Cup is merely reflective of how
well the department's teams — or
knights errant if you will — fin
ish.
And there can be little doubt
that within the finishes, if not the
overall cup race, lies the real
drama.
Having first to tackle the brisk
chill of fall, the Cardinal jumped
into the fray, determined to make
its presence immediately known,
which it did.
Leading the way was Stan
ford's own version of Lancelot —
the men's water polo team.
After braving the dark waters
(again, hyperbole for the sake of
dramatization) of swimming
pools across the nation, the team
captured the school's first nation
al championship of the year on
December 2, defeating the previ
ous two-time champion UCLA as
a parting gift for their coach,
Dante Dettamanti.
However, as in Monty
Python's version, there were no
damsels in distress to be found
here — only damsels causing dis
tress.
After a grueling season of div
ing and rolling and spiking and
blocking and yes, killing, the
women's volleyball team, led by
then-junior Ail-American Logan
Tom, swept Long Beach State,

thus bringing home Stanford's
second NCAA championship of
the year in a matter of days.
While a harsh winter prevent
ed the Cardinal from any addi
tional national championships,
the spring proved more friendly
to its noble quest.
The women's tennis team
overcame No. 1 Florida to win its
second consecutive national title
and its twelfth in the sport's 22-
year NCAA history before Lau
ren Kalvaria and Gabriela Lastra
nabbed the national doubles title
as well.
Not to be outdone by their
male counterparts, the women's
water polo team helped end the
year by collecting Stanford's
fourth and final national champi
onship for the 2001-2002 season
with a win over UCLA.
This victory marked the ninth
time in school history that Stan
ford garnered four or more na
tional titles — a national title in its
own right.
While others fell short of col
lecting their own cups, Stanford's
11 top-five finishers and 22 top
-10 teams played a huge part in
the Cardinal's eventual collective
victory over Texas by a spread of
388.5 points.
Those brave allies included
men's swimming and diving
(2nd), men's cross country (2nd),
baseball (3rd), men's soccer (3rd),
women's swimming and diving
(3rd), baseball (4th), women's in
door track and field (sth),
women's cross country (sth),
women's gymnastics (6th), men's
gymnastics (6th), men's volleyball
(6th), men's fencing (6th),
women's outdoor track and field
(7th), men's outdoor track and
field (Bth), women's basketball
(9th), women's soccer (9th) and
women's crew (10th).
As easy as defeating the
knights of "Nee."
After recording points in the
maximum of 10 women's and 10
men's sports, Stanford tallied
1499.0 points surpassing run
ners-up Texas (1110.5), Florida
(1078.0), North Carolina

(1065.5) and UCLA (1026.0).
It would appear die real race
lay in die fight for second-place.
Thus Stanford keeps its holy
grail for another year — and
Gaities has more fodder for its in

comparable dialogue discussing
the various uses the university
can find for these Waterford tro
phies (and they are inventive).
So, while the quest for the
Sears Cup may lose some of its

shine, the individual quests for
individual titles continue to pro
vide the drama and yes, occasion
ally grandeur, of Arthur's
Camelot.
That's enough for me.
