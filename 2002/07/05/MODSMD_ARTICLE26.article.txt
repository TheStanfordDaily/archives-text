## 'Men in Black' back, but off track 
### RAMIN SETOODEH EDITORIAL STAFF 
The intergalactic battle between good and
evil just got duller with "Men in Black II,"
the limp sequel to the 1997 summer block
buster that was imaginative in its special ef
fects if not story line. Director Barry Son
nenfield, who was also involved the first time
around, has re-assembled the ingredients
that made the original picture a success: the
playful camaraderie between Tommy Lee

Jones and Will Smith as secret agents Kay
and Jay; a screenplay that swerves between a
farce and an extra-terrestrial action thriller;
the manipulative villain (this time played by
Lara Flynn Boyle as an alien misfit who
adopts the form of a Victoria's Secret
model); and the band of ho-hum, good-na
tured aliens who disguise themselves as
Homo sapiens.
But the result is distant and hollow, a
gallery of computer-animated images with
no cohesive framework to keep the story to
gether. It is clear from the opening action se
quence, an exaggerated exercise that is more
disconnected than disappointing, that "Men
in Black II" does not have its heart in the ma
terial: The movie is structured around shoot

outs, alien bouts and ultimately, an ending
that is pure cop-out.
Smith and Jones, who were never as vi
able as action heroes as they were as spokes
men for Ray-Ban sunglasses, seem eerily un
comfortable in their scenes together. And
perhaps for good reason. In the five years
since the first film, their two characters seem
to have undergone complete role reversals.
Jones's Agent Kay, whose memory was
wiped clean at the end of the original film, is

now a mild-mannered postal worker with no
knowledge of the alien-control headquarters
he once headed. And Smith's Agent Jay, the
rookie in the original, is now depicted as the
top agent.
The two reunite when the evil Serleena
(Boyle) holds the rest of the staff at Men in
Black hostage with what appears to be a very
advanced form of Play-Doh. Kay eventually

recovers his memory, but the re
lationship between him and Jay
remains problematic. Neither
knows who should relinquish au
thority and adopt the sidekick
role, and the outcome is as con
fusing for the audience as it is for
the characters.
Boyle's villain, dressed in flimsy
lingerie that would make even
Heidi Klum squirm, is more shal
low than sinister. She searches for
what is enigmatically referred to as
"The Light", but the screenplay
decides to keep her indoors and
stationary (although still in scantly
clad lingerie) alongside her
hostages. It is not a good sign when
the predatory character spends
more time pacing than preying.
Also tepid is the romance be
tween Smith's character and Laura
Vasquez (Rosario Dawson), a wait
ress at a local pizzeria. He falls in
love with her, and they spend the
entire movie eyeing each other with
strange detachment. They are torn
apart in the finale under the pre
tense of melodrama, but only be
cause tlie romantic chemistry be
tween the two is so strained that no
ending with them together could
possibly be considered happy.
