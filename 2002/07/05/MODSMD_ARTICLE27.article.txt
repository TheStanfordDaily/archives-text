new film was directed by Steven
Brill, who assembled a popular
cast, including Adam Sandler,
Winona Ryder, Steve Buscemi and
John Turturro.
The movie's title character —
who calls himself Deeds but not
Mister — is a small-town guy
who owns a pizza parlor. His
quasi-picturesque life is dis
turbed when two suits arrive to
inform him that not only does he
have an uncle, but his uncle has
died and left Deeds a company
worth $40 billion.

relinquish control of the company
to receive the money. He flies out
to New York City in the company
helicopter — leaving Mandrake
Falls, Conn, for the first time —
and lands atop his extravagant,
newly inherited apartment,
which he immediately tests for its
echo effects.
Deeds becomes buddies with
his servant, Emilio (John Turtur
ro), who provides laughs in an
otherwise meager comedy by ap
pearing "very sneaky" at unex
pected moments and enjoying an
intense foot fetish. The money
and luxury is nothing more than
a novelty to Deeds — throughout
the film, he is portrayed handing
out packets of $20,000 to chil
dren in the park and people in
love. He is an all-around good
guy, aside from the few punches
he throws whenever it seems
appropriate.
Just as expected, small-town guy
meets big-city life and, with that,
big-city love. He meets Babe Ben
nett (Winona Ryder) on the street
when he saves her from a mugging.
The catch is that she had the whole
thing staged to gain access into his
life, as she is a producer for gossip

show "Inside Access." After he
thoroughly beats up her assailant
and then helps her off the sidewalk,
she introduces herself as "Pam
Dawson," a school nurse. This is by
far the most ridiculous thread of
the plot. Ryder's character is not
the least bit convincing or funny as
she tries to save herself from being
fired by catching Deeds's most pri
vate moments on camera.
It's disappointing to see
Ryder playing Babe Bennett, as
she isn't given the chance to de
velop as a character. It's hard to
take the movie seriously when
Babe, surprise of surprises, falls
in love with Deeds, because he is
a "good-hearted guy who
doesn't share our sense of ironic
detachment." There are more
big words in that sentence than
in the rest of the movie; Sandler
constantly underscores Deeds's
small-town upbringing by using
"wicked" in every third sentence.
There's no question that "Mr.
Deeds" would have been better
without any attempt at drama.
Brill asks too much from his audi
ence when the violins swell and we
are magically supposed to muster a
semblance of empathy for his shal
low characters. Instead, Brill
should have focused on creating
more funny moments, because as it
stands now, the groans outweigh
the laughs.
