The Bourne Identity

Matt Damon stars as a man
thrown into a high-paced pur
suit of answers, his assailants
and his own identity.
Director Doug Liman ("Swingers"
and "Go") takes a 1980 bestseller by
Robert Ludlum and pumps in solid fight
scenes and an impressive car chase that
turn the generic spy movie into a rich
thriller with suspense.
The audience journeys with Damon as
he races across Europe alongside Maria
(Franka Potente of "Run Lola Run"), skirt
ing danger and settling on "Jason Bourne"
as an identity.
Damon's character begins to discover
astoundingly intuitive superskills buried
within him—fluency in several languages,
martial arts moves that disable foes in sec
onds and some serious driving skills.
Unlike pal Ben Affleck's "The Sum of
All Fears," there is much more movement
in Damon's "Identity." Its closest relative
is the ABC spy show "Alias," and Damon,
like Jennifer Garner, plays young Bourne
with inviting vulnerability. Overall, the
acting borders on the muted and gray,
much like the movie's wintry European
backdrop, but the film is redeemed in ag
gressive, thrilling action.

Lilo & Such

The tots in the audience started
chanting, "We love Stitch!" prior
to a showing of this animated
film. But when the lights dimmed and
the projector rolled, it was obvious there
was little to love about the blue Martian
who makes up the latter half of Disney's
"Lilo & Stich": The chubby creature, a
cross between the Tazmanian Devil and
one of the less colorful seven dwarfs, is a
one-grunt whalchamacallit. He destroys
and devours, but there's not a furball of
emotional depth to the character.
The real hero of the film is Lilo (pro
nounced Lee-low and voiced by Daveigh
Chase), an orphaned Hawaiian who
finds the shipwrecked Stitch and calls
him her own. She is what every Disney
heroine should be: brave, yet vulnerable,
and full of hula-dancing hip moves that
will have even the boys in the theater
snapping their fingers.
The first hour of the movie is de
pendable Disney, the only exception
being the low-voice Elvis ballads on the
soundtrack. But then the story collaps
es into a silly sci-fi finale that plays like
it's been yanked from the after school
cartoon, "Darkwing Duck." It's not a
stitch of fun.

Minority Report

Steven Spielberg's second sci-fi film
in two years is based on a short story
by renowned futurist Philip K. Dick.
Tom Cruise plays the head of an experi
mental agency called Pre Crime that uses
a trio of psychics ("PreCogs") to arrest
criminals before they commit murders.
But when the Pre Cogs finger Cruise, he
must run and solve the mystery of his
own future.
Pounded on a killer premise, "Minority
Report" somewhat falls victim to the com
mercial instincts of Spielberg and Cruise.
The enticing messages about the meta
physics of free will, personal privacy in die
information age and the dangers of science
and "Big Government" eventually take a
back seat to "Mission: Impossible" action.
The special effects depicting tech
nologies are generously advanced for
2054, but nicely rendered nonetheless.
Swift acting and a stylish noir feel fine
(borrowing questionably from "L.A.
Confidential"). But the potential of
Dick's original idea deserves more
thought, and Spielberg still needs to be
cured of his happy-ending syndrome.
"Minority Report" is no masterpiece.
Still, as a summer popcorn movie it'll
have to do.

WINDTALKERS

r ■ "The latest film directed by John
Woo, the Hong Kong director
JL. famed for his action sequences, is
about Navajos serving in the U.S. Armed
Forces during World War 11. These sol
diers used their language to formulate a
communication code used by the Ameri
can military that the Japanese were un
able to break.
The action sequences in "Windtalk
ers" follow the recent trend (e.g. "Saving
Private Ryan") of showing more gore in
war films. Woo does a nice job of shoot
ing these scenes: They are crisp and cre
ate undeniable tension for the audience.
The acting by Nicholas Cage and Christ
ian Slater, who are officers assigned to
protect these Navajo code-talkers, is also
first-rate.
But the plot is never smart enough
for the action. The film fails in tired mo
ments where Private Ben Yahzee (Adam
Beach), one of the Navajo soldiers,
fights racism from his fellow white sol
diers or performs a mystical Native
American ceremony.
The tale of these Navajo soldiers could
have been very riveting, but instead the
action scenes are the primary driver of
the movie.

But when the Pre Cogs finger Cruise, he
must run and solve the mystery of his
own future.
Pounded on a killer premise, "Minority
Report" somewhat falls victim to the com
mercial instincts of Spielberg and Cruise.
The enticing messages about the meta
physics of free will, personal privacy in die
information age and the dangers of science
and "Big Government" eventually take a
back seat to "Mission: Impossible" action.
The special effects depicting tech
nologies are generously advanced for
2054, but nicely rendered nonetheless.
Swift acting and a stylish noir feel fine
(borrowing questionably from "L.A.
Confidential"). But the potential of
Dick's original idea deserves more
thought, and Spielberg still needs to be
cured of his happy-ending syndrome.
"Minority Report" is no masterpiece.
Still, as a summer popcorn movie it'll
have to do.

WINDTALKERS

r ■ "The latest film directed by John
Woo, the Hong Kong director
JL. famed for his action sequences, is
about Navajos serving in the U.S. Armed
Forces during World War 11. These sol
diers used their language to formulate a
communication code used by the Ameri
can military that the Japanese were un
able to break.
The action sequences in "Windtalk
ers" follow the recent trend (e.g. "Saving
Private Ryan") of showing more gore in
war films. Woo does a nice job of shoot
ing these scenes: They are crisp and cre
ate undeniable tension for the audience.
The acting by Nicholas Cage and Christ
ian Slater, who are officers assigned to
protect these Navajo code-talkers, is also
first-rate.
But the plot is never smart enough
for the action. The film fails in tired mo
ments where Private Ben Yahzee (Adam
Beach), one of the Navajo soldiers,
fights racism from his fellow white sol
diers or performs a mystical Native
American ceremony.
The tale of these Navajo soldiers could
have been very riveting, but instead the
action scenes are the primary driver of
the movie.
