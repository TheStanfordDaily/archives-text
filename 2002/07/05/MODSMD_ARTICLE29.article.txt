# DVD pick of the week

### 
After a solid first season, Joss Whedon's cult TV show, "Buffy the
Vampire Slayer," took off in its second year, becoming one of the
the most imaginative shows on television. All the elements that
made "Buffy" remarkable from the start — particularly its genre-

spanning aesthetic, deftly moving
from horror to comedy to melodra
ma to action, and its central insight
that, as an adolescent, life can feel
like a horror movie — were
brought into refined form
The season's central plot is the
star-crossed romance between Bully
(Sarah Michelle Cellar), a Southern
California high-schooler gifted with
supernatural strength so that she
can fight the übiquitous forces of
darkness, and Angel (David Bore
anaz), a vampire cursed with a soul.
The two pivotal episodes, "Inno
cence" and "Becoming" (both writ
ten and directed by show creator
Whedon), mav be the finest and

most heartbreaking hours in the six seasons "Buffy" has run so far.
Cellar delivers incredible performances in both of them, proving that
she can handle sarcasm, tears and sword-lighting with equal aplomb.
Like the episodes themselves, the second-season DVDs are
much improved from the first. Extras include three featurettes on
the making of the show, most notably a detailed look at the process
of make-up design, a tour of the set for BufTy's house and scripts
and writer commentaries on four episodes. Whedon's voiceover
for "Innocence" is the most entertaining and insightful of them
all; at one point, he launches into a comparison between the
episode and "Citizen Kane," acknowledging that despite his pas
sion for the show, it might not add up to "a black-and-white movie
about a bald guy."
