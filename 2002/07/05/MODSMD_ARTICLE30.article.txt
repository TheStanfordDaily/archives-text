# Beyond Al Green: Roxy's guide to getting it on
## 
### 
Dear Roxy,
My friends and I were swapping first hook-up tales and
I was shocked by the lack of common sense involved in these
encounters. I mean, I'm all for carpe diem, sweep off the
table, I-can't-wait-to-have-you passion, but my friends —
and even their female counterparts — seem to lack all fore
sight. I definitely consider myself a planner when it comes to
these things, but nou> I'm worried that I may be overdoing it.
Can you do us all a favor and expound on the dos and don 'ts
of the first exchange?
Sincerely,
Chagrined in Schwab
Ms. Sass lias a little experience in this area and has cer
tainly lived through enough nights of chocolate-covered
strawberries and rose petals in the bathtub to sympathize
with you. Of course there are no strict rules in this arena,
but whether you end up at his place after a dinner date
or a campus party, here are a few fundamentals on the
art of love. And for anyone planning to stop reading this
now, trust me, Cassanova, you don't know as much as
you think you do.
Since you may not have successfully anticipated luring
company into your lair, some of these things needs to be
managed within the first few moments of entering your
room. First, set the itkxxl widi some music. Make sure that
you have a quality rotation set up — don't go from Dave to
Jay-/. You won't impress your partner or your roommates
with your Lilith Fair Live CI), and never ever use KMEL.
Once you've got the music down, the lights should go
with it. A word to the wise: Pitch blackness only leads to dis
aster, so go for dim but not dark. You don't want her wak
ing up looking like she's been in a bar-brawl with your
headboard. That said, though, dorm lighting is about as
sexy as grass, so lose it fora more flattering floor or desk
lamp as soon as possible.
And, on a related note, for those of you trying to cool
down the sex den with an open window or two, please,
please, think of your neighbors. Of course, deafening
your partner with the air conditioner isn't ideal either, so

play it by ear.
Now that you have made your bed, it's time to make
sure that you'll both by lying in it. Your mission: to extend
the overnight invitation. You've been engaging in some
flirty banter and she asks if you're heading to bed
soon-read: Are you heading to l)ed alone soon? Don't be
afraid to take the bull by the horns. Respond, "Yes, but
you're welcome to join me."
Another successful approach is to put the ball in
her court with a coy remark like, "This is going so well,
but I don't want to assume anything . . ." Whatever
you do, make sure that she leels wanted but free to
block your advances.
You're nearing sure-thing territory, so don't ruin it
with your cell phone, Palm, IM or any other slightly less
than cool Silicon Valley stylings. Turn it all oil'now so it
won't do the same to you later.
Though this next point requires a little forethought, at
about this moment in the saga that is hooking up, it be
comes key to rapidly assess one's clothing. If your guy
needs a manual for your super-strappy, ultra-pushup,
drive-him-wild sexy bra, the sun may rise before he does,
so keep it simple.
And, ladies, always — always — pants for that first
round, (letting it on in a short skirt is as good as taking
off your own clothes (which, incidentally, is definitely
not good).
Now, with die deed finally on the horizon, it's time to
pick the perfect location. Consider carefully, because the
spot you choose will likely be die best metaphor for the re
lationship to come.
A teeth-brushed, pajama-clad, tender tryst in the bed
room spells commitment, no matter how you look at it.
But, though a session 011 the coffee table may put you at
the top of the weekend's "To Do" list, you probably won't
get a dinner invitation when your partner's parents roll
into town.
The mood is finally set, and with that Ms. Sass will take
a cue from a famous would-be virgin and leave you want
ing more. Next week, we'll venture under the covers fora
closer l(X)k at the highs and lows of sealing the deal.
