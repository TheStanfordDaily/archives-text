# Rapper Smith, no 'Reign' man
## 
### PETER KAZANJY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Will Smith is, has always been, will always be and
should never try to be other than the cute rapper. No
body's going to deny that. That, or the fact that he's
funny, well-spoken, shrewd in his media exposure,
and so on.
Like everything about his highly produced life,
everything on his album has surely been agonized over
by an army of publicists and attorneys in pursuit of the

pertect exposition ot w ill
ness. For example, he
deftly borrows Eminem's
style by having his kit! ap
pear on the album. Ex
cept Eminem's son, Haley-
Mathers, shouts, "My
daddy gone crazy!" in a
half-measure-long sam
ple, where Jaden Smith
babbles fora good 55 sec
onds, thoroughly re
minding us that, yes, Big
Willie is the "responsible
rhyme-sayer," a good
daddy and all of that.
Which is fine. We
need more people like le
prince frais making this
sort of statement. Would
that it were the only
statement he tried to

make or at the very least, that his other statements
didn't fly in the face of something that appears to be
so important to him.
There are no less than six thug-life pictures in the
liner notes (one even has Will hanging from a chain,
with a little karate kick action to better floss his new
Lugz). There are far fewer "Ah, ha ha; Ah, ha ha"s of
"Big Willie Style," fame than growling, shouting
rhymes of the new tender yet hard "Big Will." (Or is it
hardly tender? Regardless, this hardness is aimed to
make some serious legal tender for Columbia). Un
fortunately, it comes off less complicated and intro
spective than as a poorly thought-out publicity stunt.
But all hypocrisy and paradox aside, if Willy was

born to reign over anything, it's the summertime an
them (past hits include "Summertime," "Men In
Black," "Gettin'Jiggy Wit It," "Miami"). For the most
part, he always had help, "borrowing" tunes from
Motown's greats to help him on his way, and the for
mula worked wonderfully. The problem here is that
Will tries to do it all again, but it doesn't quite fit. It's
like when "Saved By the Bell" started back again with
a new cast. Everyone knew who was supposed to be
Slater, who was supposed to be Zach and which poor
sap was slated as the sequel to Screech.

Similarly, "Block
Party" may be heir to "Sum
mertime's" legacy and
"Black Suits Gomin' " may
be the lead song in the
"Men in Black" sequel, but
neither stand up to the stan
dard set by those that came
before. "Black Suits
Comin' " comes off angry,
and about what we're left
guessing. Perhaps angry
about how broke this much
product placement sounds:
"Black suit, the black
shades, the black shoes, the
black tie with the black atti
tude/ new style black Ray
Bans, I'm stunnin' man /
new hot in this pitch black
[Mercedes] 600 man." Or
mavbe angry about how ret-

respective it all sounds: "The best lookin' crime fight
since myself in part one!" or "What yon thought I
wouldn't come again/ leave you hangin' without
bringin' the fun again?" 1 know why I'd be angry, and
it's not just because track 13 is a remix of track seven
(let's not get too ahead of ourselves here Will).
But there are a couple of reasons to smile. DJ Jazzy
Jeff makes a quick cameo on "Block Party" to reprise
his and Willy's smash from way back, "Summertime."
It's fun listening, but it doesn't capture the carefree
ness of the original, mistakenly opting for smoldering
R&B hooks instead of the lighter fare of its predeces
sor. Oh, well, Pony Boy, as we all learned from"The
Outsiders," nothing gold can stay.
