# Moby falls short of perfect with '18'

### PETER KAZANJY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Moby's new album, "18," sets its
own intergalactic planetary aspira
tions with the title of its first track,
"We Are All Made of Stars." It'sjust
a shame that it can't support that
with what follows. Problem
notwithstanding, props go to
Moby for naming a song after a
Carl Sagan quote.
The album borders on eerie.
The ingredients are all there, it
would seem. Guitar everywhere,
from the Depeche Modal start in
"Stars," to the U2 riff that sweeps
in after, to the over-reverbed,
fuzzed out axe on "Signs of
Love." They all sound great, too.
Strings appear in about every
song, whether real violin, cello or
synthy pseudo-approximations
of the same.
Hut the parts mesh only curso
rily, and the songs themselves are
never as nifty as the sounds. The
sounds aren't wasted, of course,
but instead of giving the whole

work feel that "Play" really had
wired, "18" just sounds like a
rewind of that which has come be
fore. Which, being Moby, is still
good listening. It'sjust not great
listening.
In fact, if you're a Moby fan
from way back, listening to the
album may make you a bit nostal
gic for Moby's previous cuts, be
cause they are all there to be heard
within "18."
The "Play" gospel singers are
clapping and shouting, the strings
are still straining. But at times it
gets almost alarming, with the
same old high-speed piano scales
showing up, too.
1 challenge you to compare
"Hymn," off "Everything is
Wrong" (1995) with "In My Heart"
off "18." You'll see what I mean
about a tour de Moby of years gone
by. You will be grateful to note,
though, that all the raging-speed
shouting was left behind on
"Everything" and "Animal Rights"
(1993). Apparently, Moby has mel
lowed with age.

There are occasional new
parts, too, though like mentioned
above, nothing is as groundbreak
ing as "Play." Moby seemed to
have found two-step / Garage
years before everyone else on
"Everything is Wrong's" and
"Everytime You Touch Me." This
time around, he tries a little hip
hop with his gospel on "Jam for
the Ladies" (so much for Em
inem's claims about our hero's
sexuality).
"Great Escape" sounds like it
was written after a Bell and Sebas
tian concert, with the 808 even
missing on this one. However,
dropping your standby instru
ment for just one track does not
wild innovation make.
Again, while the parts are all
there, they just fail to coalesce
into a definitive whole. Nothing
on the album truly transcends the
sum of its parts, though 1 would
still prescribe to anyone driving
through Yosemite; Moby always
had a knack for producing
sounds of the epic.
