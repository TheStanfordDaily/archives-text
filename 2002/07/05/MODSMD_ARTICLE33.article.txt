# Imperial Teen album brings mature sound
## 
### KAREEM GHANEM STAFF WRITER 
Lately, it's been New York City's rock 'n' roll revivalists that
have attracted the lion's share of critical enthusiasm. The Strokes
obviously come to mind, but attention has swirled around other
bands, like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Interpol. This is perhaps
why Imperial Teen's third and latest record, "On," is such a plea
surable listen; the quartet's newest work is definitive proof that
San Francisco's rock scene can still produce bands that rival any in
the world.
To say that Imperial Teen has a certain skill with a pop hook is
somewhat of an absurd understatement; the band drips with pop
rock throughout "On" in the finest tradition of the Beach Boys and
the Ramones. The CD is smothered in upbeat guitars, keyboards,
drumming and enough "ooh ooh"s, "ah ah"sand "yeah yeah"s to
keep your head singing hours after you've stopped listening.
Part of the band's appeal is that their sound belies the intensity
and sharpness of their lyrics. The second track, "Baby," bursts with
singer / guitarist Roddy Bottum's slacker-bubblegum voice and the
sly sexuality of verses like: "Shake shake, va va voom, vis-a-vis / Go
go I do you, you do me/Take take I'll call you sugarfree/ Slow slow,
I love you, you love me."
Other songs, such as "Our Time," have the words San Francisco
stamped all over them: "All the girls are dressed in leather /And the
boys are wearing feathers/ It's our time." Perhaps hinting at the way
the group sees itself, singer Will Schwartz continues with the decla
ration: "We are fighting the fight / A libertarian plight / And it's our
time / I leavy metal in the sound / And there's still an underground
/ It's our time."
"Teacher's Pet" is built on a droning keyboard synthesizer and
insistent drum beat. It sounds like an updated cover of an eighties
hit at first, but Imperial Teen is far smarter than that. The band
might very well be singing about a pop star past her prime or about
the state of pop music itself: "She's a mixed up kind of girl / The
kind you wish you never met / And like a dried up pot of glue / She
only sticks when she is wet."
"On" 's 12 tracks are the types of tunes that one could hear time
and time again and passively enjoy. I he album's secret, however, is
that you're likely to enjoy it far more if you pay attention to what the
songs are saying. In tins respect, the band is immediately reminis
cent of the Pixies and the album of the Pixies' classic, "Doolittle."
Like that album, "On" 's only real weakness is that it grows a bit slow
at the end. Though the last few songs add a measure of diversity to
the album, they also drag on a bit in comparison to the earlier ones.
That aside, though, "On" is likely one of the best new CDs you'll
hear — once you're turned "On," you'll likely find it difficult to
turn back.
