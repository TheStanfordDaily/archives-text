# 'Trading Spaces' is not the typical reality show

### ERIN ARCHERD EDITORIAL STAFF 
Television programmers laud reality
television as the next big thing, wildly pop
ular and inexpensive.
But maybe it isn't such a new idea, be
cause the kind of reality television that I
enjoy, home improvement, has been
around as long as I've been watching tele
vision. No, not the Tim Allen sitcom,
though the fact that he was spoofing the
improvement genre a decade before the
wonderous "Big Brother" or "Survivor"
aired certainly shows it's a part of our na
tional TV-viewing consciousness.
It used to be you could only find home
improvement shows on PBS—that
netherworld of "Sesame Street" and
British detective films. As a kid, I would
sit and watch the "Yankee Home Work
shop" or "This Old House." I wanted the
Barbies and the Legos, but I also wished
we had a workshop in our garage with a
routing saw and those special drills that
carve table legs.
And even at the age of eight, I knew
Norm ran the show and Bob Villa was
there for comic relief.
I never got the jig-saw, but I did help
my mom build a fence and pour a concrete
driveway. Manual labor on one's home is
about as fulfilling as manual labor can get
and having worked as a janitor, I have a
pretty good perspective on the value of

manual labor.
As I entered middle school and my at
tention turned towards the shows that
teens either watched and at least pretend
ed to enjoy, or risk joining the rejects or

sympathy cases whose par
ents didn't let them watch
television, I tuned off Bob
and Norm. Imagine my
surprise when my senior
year of high school I began
to notice home improve
ment shows appearing on
cable TV. Maybe they were
kept alive by the unholy
duo of Tim "The Tool
Man" Taylor and Martha
"My Perfect World is Being
Investigated by the SEC"
Stewart. Suddenly, the Dis
covery Channel and TLC
were showing programs on
home decorating and re
modeling. Then, home im
provement had its own net
work, Home and Carden
Television.

But how can you make home improve
ment into a game show, something that
can compete with "Survivor"? This is
where the programming genius occurs.
Not to be outdone by HGTV, The Learn
ing Channel developed "Trading Spaces,"
by far the best reality programming to
date (my editor thinks it's "Big Brother 2,"

but unfortunately, he's wrong).
This hour-long show has drama, sus
pense, a cast of regular characters and
still provides home decorating tips. Plus
it has major beef-cake factor—cast car-

penter Ty Pennington,
was named one of Peo
ple Magazine's Top 50
Bachelor's of the Year.
During the show, a pair
of couples each has two
days and $1,000 to re
decorate a room in the
other's house. They are
each guided, ordered
around really, by a de
signer.
There's a group
of six designers that ap
pear regularly on the
show. By the show's
second season, the par
ticipants are aware of
the particular tenden
cies of the designers
and plead with their

friends to save them from too much crazi
ness. Usually, though, the designers ha
rangue their team into carrying out their
wacky schemes.
The designer you love to hate is Doug
Wilson. He has a penchant for modernism
and painting over wood furniture, chairs
and flooring, rarely listens to the sugges
tions of his design team and doesn't han

die criticism well. More animosity has been
caused by Doug than all of the other de
signers combined.
The current host, Paige Davis, is a
perky pixie who goes between the teams,
helps sew pillow covers, paints walls and
occasionally takes the residents' side
against the designers.
The dynamic between the couples is an
exciting part of the show as well. Some
couples appear to enjoy the experience,
while others barely make it through with
out eviscerating each other.
The results are always incredible and
reactions range from tears of happiness
to curses and cries of disbelief. Highlights
include a room with walls covered in
moss, to which a confused homeowner
wrinkled her nose and asked, "What's
that smell?" And a bedroom decorated
like a harem, which the owners' 13-year
old daughter loved.
I find myself choosing sides as soon as
the show begins — which designer I like
the most, which couple will do a better
job with the least amount of fighting.
Usually I pick the winner, but the best
part is that winning and losing is com
pletely subjective.
I may watch the season premiere of
"Big Brother 3" this Wednesday. But I will
never miss "Trading Spaces" on Saturday
nights and I try to catch the reruns week
days at 4 p.m. Reality television doesn't get
much better than home improvement.
