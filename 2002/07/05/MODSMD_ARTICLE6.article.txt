## Students begin summer research experience 
### ERIN ARCHERD EDITORIAL STAFF 
While most students leave the Farm for
the summer months, some stay on to par
ticipate in one of Stanford's newest under
graduate research opportunities: Summer
Research College.
SRC 1 , allows students to work with facul
ty, learn about research and academics
and enjoy social activities like beach trips
and camping. SRC is run by the Under
graduate Research Programs office in con
nection with the vice provost for Under
graduate Education.
Participants work with professors from
a variety of departments, from Psychology
and Sociology to Computer Science and
Electrical Engineering. Departments have
different ways of notifying students about
available projects, and either the depart
ment or an individual faculty member may
choose students to participate.
Senior Jason Anderson, a Computer
Science major, is working with Prof. Marc
Levoy on the Digital Michelangelo Project,
which uses computer technology to aide
researchers and help recreate 3-dimen
sional pieces of art. One of their goals is to
make a permanent miniature copy of the
"David."
"My part is to get a miniature replica of
the David built using a rapid prototyping
technique and then calibrate projectors to
illuminate the statue with actual color or
UV data," explained Anderson.
Sophomore Ken Jones is also working
in the Computer Science department up
dating library files for Prof. Eric Roberts.
"Right now I'm working on a web site.

My job is to try to get libraries to work with
various compilers, like Microsoft .Net or
Code Warrior for example," said Jones.
This year's program houses students in
680 Lomita, Theta Delta Chi, Kappa
Sigma and Paloma. Students attend week
ly house meetings where they listen to res
idents speak about their research projects.
"The research presentations given by
residents during house meeting have been
very interesting. People here are working
on such amazing things," said junior
Annie Gai, who is working with Prof.

Camilla Kao in the Chemical Engineering
department.
Salaries for the research range by de
partment and faculty and they can choose
whether to pay a stipend or an hourly
wage. Most students in the technical areas
make around $5,000. Room and board,
which are deducted from this amount, cost
about $2,500 for the summer. All students
are required to purchase a meal plan.
Although students find the meal plan
convenient, some feel that the Florence
Moore Dining Hall is not large enough to

accommodate both SRC participants and
people in conference or summer camp
housing at Flo Mo.
"With the meal plan, it seems like we're
paying more for lower quality food than
we would normally get during the school
year, and the dining hall is extremely
crowded during peak dining times," said
Anderson.
Unlike the regular school year, there is
no homework and no tests. Students work
at their research positions during the day,
but nights and weekends are their own.
"It's really awesome to be here during
the summer," said junior Ginger Xu.
"This is a nine-to-five lifestyle, but being a
student is 24-7. It's assimilating us into fu
ture work mode, and I'm able to appreci
ate the campus more."
SRC also allows students to focus more
intensely during the workday. Annie Gai is
continuing a Chemical Engineering pro
ject she began during winter quarter.
"I can really immerse myself in my re
search project. I don't have to plan out my
experiments around my classes, allowing
my project to progress much faster," she
said. "I've probably accomplished more
the past two weeks than during the past
two quarters," she said.
Student reactions to the caliber of cam
pus life and activities during the summer
vary.
"I thought the campus would be aban
doned during the summer, but I think it is
actually more active because of all the sum
mer conferences and visitors," observed
Simmons.
"Campus is a little bit empty, but during
lunch everyone's here," laughed Jones.
