Lythcott-Haims named
to newly created position
Julie Lythcott-Haims, current Assistant
to the President, was named Assistant Vice
Provost and Dean of Freshman and Trans
fer Students.

The new position strives
to make it easier for un
dergraduates to make the
transition to the academic
and social climate at Stan
ford. Reporting directly
to Vice Provost of Student
Affairs Gene Awakuni,
Haims will also oversee
the Haas Center for Pub
lic Service, the office of

New Student Orientation and the Career
Development Center.
"Julie's work in student affairs at the
Law School and experience as a lawyer in

private practice, coupled with a love for
Stanford that dates back to her time as a
resident assistant at Branner and senior
class president, make her a perfect fit for
the job," Awakuni said.
The inspiration for such a job struck
Lythcott-Haims when she first entered
Stanford.
"Since the day I entered Stanford in the
fall of 1985 and was greeted by efferves
cent orientation volunteers and knowl
edgeable resident assistants who knew my
name and where I was from, I have want
ed to be a part of delivering the essence of
Stanford to the next generation of Stan
ford students," said Lythcott-Haims.
Lythcott-Haims earned a bachelor's de
gree in American Studies at Stanford in
1989, and a law degree from Harvard in
1994. She was a practicing attorney in the
Bay Area until 1998 when she returned to
Stanford.
West elected newest trustee
Richard West, a prominent Native

American and alumnus of Stanford Law
School, was elected to Stanford Universi
ty's Board of Trustees during its last meet
ing of the academic year on June 14.
West is a member of the Cheyenne and
Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma and is cur
rently director of the Smithsonian Institu
tion's National Museum of the American
Indian. As director of the NMAI, West will
guide the opening of its exhibition facility
in New York City, the Cultural Resource
center in Maryland and the museum on
the National Mall.
While Stanford's Native American Cul
tural Center was unaware of West's nomi
nation, it is taking advantage of the oppor
tunity to involve West in Native American
affairs on campus.
"We have planned to schedule the
NACC advisory board meeting at the same
time he's on campus for the Board of
Trustees next fall," explained Assistant
Dean of Students and Director of the
NACC Winona Simins.
Stanford's Native American community
worked with West before his appointment

and inducted him into the Alumni Hall of
Fame in October, 2001.
Before becoming NMAI director, West
co-founded an Indian-owned law firm in
Albuquerque. He earned his law degree
from Stanford in 1971 and was editor of
the Stanford Law Review. He served on
Stanford Law School's Board of Visitors
from 1978 to 1981 and is a former adjunct
professor at the Law School.
"As our first Native American trustee,
he increases our diversity," said Isaac
Stein, chair of the Board of Trustees. "But
more important, he brings a unique skill
set to our activities. As a lawyer and as the
founding director of the National Muse
um on the American Indian, Richard has a
broad range of experience in the not-for
profit sector."
Earle becomes
Vice President of Public Affairs
Gordon Earle, a communications pro-


Julie
Lythcott-Haims
fessional formerly of the Mac-
Neil-Lehrer News Hour, was
named Vice President of Public-
Affairs.

A former John
Knight Fellow in
1988 at Stanford,
Earle returns to
the Farm after
heading his own
communications
firm, which had
such high-profile
clients as IBM

and AT&T Wireless.
Reporting directly to the pres
ident, Earle will direct and coor
dinate Stanford's relations with
the local community and govern
ment agencies, while overseeing
media relations.
Earle, who will formally begin
his job in August, is particularly
interested in the university's rela
tionship with the surrounding
community. The Woodside High
School graduate's first act was the
announcement of the continua
tion of Stanford Community

Day, an open house for the sur
rounding community.
"This event represents an im
portant step in strengthening the
university's ties to the local com
munity," said Earle. "I hope this
will be one hallmark of my tenure
— a growing sense of partnership
and shared values between Stan
ford and the many individuals
and groups that care deeply about
the future of our community."
Earle had previously spent
seven years at PBS covering busi
ness, financial and economic
news. Earle was awarded the
George Foster Peabody Award
for his work supervising pro
gramming fora seven-part series
on Japan's economy. He also re
ceived a citation for reporting ex
cellence from the American Bar
Association.
Recommended by a nine
member search council, Presi
dent Hennessy felt that Earle was
a great fit for Stanford and the
community.
"Gordon is an ideal fit for this
critical new position," Hennessy
said. "He brings extensive expe
rience in journalism and commu
nications to Stanford, combined
with a knowledge of the local
community."

Lythcott-Haims named
to newly created position
Julie Lythcott-Haims, current Assistant
to the President, was named Assistant Vice
Provost and Dean of Freshman and Trans
fer Students.

The new position strives
to make it easier for un
dergraduates to make the
transition to the academic
and social climate at Stan
ford. Reporting directly
to Vice Provost of Student
Affairs Gene Awakuni,
Haims will also oversee
the Haas Center for Pub
lic Service, the office of

New Student Orientation and the Career
Development Center.
"Julie's work in student affairs at the
Law School and experience as a lawyer in

private practice, coupled with a love for
Stanford that dates back to her time as a
resident assistant at Branner and senior
class president, make her a perfect fit for
the job," Awakuni said.
The inspiration for such a job struck
Lythcott-Haims when she first entered
Stanford.
"Since the day I entered Stanford in the
fall of 1985 and was greeted by efferves
cent orientation volunteers and knowl
edgeable resident assistants who knew my
name and where I was from, I have want
ed to be a part of delivering the essence of
Stanford to the next generation of Stan
ford students," said Lythcott-Haims.
Lythcott-Haims earned a bachelor's de
gree in American Studies at Stanford in
1989, and a law degree from Harvard in
1994. She was a practicing attorney in the
Bay Area until 1998 when she returned to
Stanford.
West elected newest trustee
Richard West, a prominent Native

American and alumnus of Stanford Law
School, was elected to Stanford Universi
ty's Board of Trustees during its last meet
ing of the academic year on June 14.
West is a member of the Cheyenne and
Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma and is cur
rently director of the Smithsonian Institu
tion's National Museum of the American
Indian. As director of the NMAI, West will
guide the opening of its exhibition facility
in New York City, the Cultural Resource
center in Maryland and the museum on
the National Mall.
While Stanford's Native American Cul
tural Center was unaware of West's nomi
nation, it is taking advantage of the oppor
tunity to involve West in Native American
affairs on campus.
"We have planned to schedule the
NACC advisory board meeting at the same
time he's on campus for the Board of
Trustees next fall," explained Assistant
Dean of Students and Director of the
NACC Winona Simins.
Stanford's Native American community
worked with West before his appointment

and inducted him into the Alumni Hall of
Fame in October, 2001.
Before becoming NMAI director, West
co-founded an Indian-owned law firm in
Albuquerque. He earned his law degree
from Stanford in 1971 and was editor of
the Stanford Law Review. He served on
Stanford Law School's Board of Visitors
from 1978 to 1981 and is a former adjunct
professor at the Law School.
"As our first Native American trustee,
he increases our diversity," said Isaac
Stein, chair of the Board of Trustees. "But
more important, he brings a unique skill
set to our activities. As a lawyer and as the
founding director of the National Muse
um on the American Indian, Richard has a
broad range of experience in the not-for
profit sector."
Earle becomes
Vice President of Public Affairs
Gordon Earle, a communications pro-


Julie
Lythcott-Haims
fessional formerly of the Mac-
Neil-Lehrer News Hour, was
named Vice President of Public-
Affairs.

A former John
Knight Fellow in
1988 at Stanford,
Earle returns to
the Farm after
heading his own
communications
firm, which had
such high-profile
clients as IBM

and AT&T Wireless.
Reporting directly to the pres
ident, Earle will direct and coor
dinate Stanford's relations with
the local community and govern
ment agencies, while overseeing
media relations.
Earle, who will formally begin
his job in August, is particularly
interested in the university's rela
tionship with the surrounding
community. The Woodside High
School graduate's first act was the
announcement of the continua
tion of Stanford Community

Day, an open house for the sur
rounding community.
"This event represents an im
portant step in strengthening the
university's ties to the local com
munity," said Earle. "I hope this
will be one hallmark of my tenure
— a growing sense of partnership
and shared values between Stan
ford and the many individuals
and groups that care deeply about
the future of our community."
Earle had previously spent
seven years at PBS covering busi
ness, financial and economic
news. Earle was awarded the
George Foster Peabody Award
for his work supervising pro
gramming fora seven-part series
on Japan's economy. He also re
ceived a citation for reporting ex
cellence from the American Bar
Association.
Recommended by a nine
member search council, Presi
dent Hennessy felt that Earle was
a great fit for Stanford and the
community.
"Gordon is an ideal fit for this
critical new position," Hennessy
said. "He brings extensive expe
rience in journalism and commu
