A tortilla-throwing, banner
toting group of almost 25,000
thousand spectators looked on as
4,588 exuberant students gradu
ated from Stanford University at
its 111 th Commencement.
Featuring United States Na
tional Security Advisor Con
doleezza Rice as the keynote
speaker, the ceremony began
with a /.any Stanford tradition:
the wackv walk. One last license

to go crazy, the traditional walk
to the stadium includes costumes
of various colors and tastes inter
spersed with a mixture of hula
hoops and beach balls.
President John Hennessy,
while addressing the Class of
2002 for the last time, highlight
ed the balance between old and
new that each student would
make during his or her lifetime.
"As you leave this university, I
hope you carry a deep apprecia
tion of the values and traditions
that are everlasting as well as a

willingness to be bold and to ap
proach the challenges before you
with a fresh perspective," Hen
nessy said.
Hennessy, in the Stanford tra
dition, noted the statistics of the
graduating class: The University
granted 1,736 bachelor's de
grees, 1,985 master's degrees
and 867 doctoral degrees. Of this
number, 424 seniors graduated
with departmental honors and
268 earned University distinc
tion.
Rice, who first came to Stan
ford in 1981, refrained from lay
ing out any policy during her ad
dress, but terrorism and its ef
fects played a key role in her mes
sage. Growing up in Birming
ham, Ala. during the civil rights
movement, Rice recounted that
she saw terrorism first-hand
when her childhood friend died
in the bombing of the 16th Bap
tist Church.
"Some have declared this most
virulent form of hatred a clash of
civilizations. Taken literally, that
is a very dangerous idea," re
marked Rice. "Cultural differ
ences do exist, they are real, not
imagined — and they are part
of what makes the human race vi
brant."
Rice, who spoke to many of the

graduating students as provost
during their freshman orienta
tion in 1998, reminisced on what
she had instructed the then-en
tering students.
"Back then, I said that your
job here was to find your pas
sion," Rice said. "Not just some
thing that interested you, but
something that you couldn't live
without."
"I also urged you four years
ago to try many paths; try some
thing hard; and to take time to
get to know those around you —
particularly those beyond your
ethnic, religious or ideological
background."
During her address, Rice con
centrated on the obligations of
the graduates. Students have an
obligation to search for the truth,
a responsibility to be optimistic
and a duty to spread the seeds of
their Stanford experience else
where.
About two dozen graduates
turned their backs to Rice and at
tached red fliers to their mortar
boards to protest the Bush ad
ministration's policies, while
some 40 people from the local
community protested outside
the stadium.
During the ceremony, Hen
nessy paid tribute to social ac
tivist and Stanford alumnus
John Gardner who died in Feb
ruary. Hennessy related how
Gardner defined what it meant
to be a citizen: "Freedom and re
sponsibility, liberty and duty.
That's the deal."
