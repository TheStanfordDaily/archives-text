## 
### KATIE TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On July 3, the San Jose Sym
phony performed at Frost Am
phitheater what was one of its few
scheduled concerts during the
next 18 months, at its annual pre
lndependence Day celebration.
In addition to a concert and fire
works show, organizers allowed
concertgoers to picnic while
watching the light and sound
show.
The Symphony, which is 123
years old, has a roughly $3 mil
lion deficit and announced in
early June that it would file for
bankruptcy.
The Symphony's Executive
Transition Committee has deter
mined thai it is necessary for the
Symphony to "go dark" fora pe
riod of time in order to separate
the recreated San Jose Symphony
from the problems of the previ
ous organization.
The San Jose Symphony Advi
sory Panel Report states that be
fore the Symphony reopens it
must have a new board, new man
agement, new artistic direction,
solid funding, more effective
marketing, a program which re
flects audience demand, a pro
gram to educate audiences, musi

cian involvement in determining
future direction and a variety of
venues at which to perform.
The Symphony is projected to
reopen within the next year and a
half, but will not do so until all
these elements are in place.
Tim Beswick, the San Jose
Symphony's interim administra
tor, is optimistic about the future.
"Our hope is that in going
through this process the phoenix

will rise from the ashes and the
Symphony will perform again."
During the Symphony's
"dark" period, they will still be
playing a limited number of en
gagements but will not have a reg
ular concert season until at least
2003.
Tim Beswick said of the July 3
concert at Frost, "We are grateful

Jose Symphony 7 s pre-lndependence Day concert, which featured a repertoire
of patriotic music followed by a fireworks show.

services and allowing our musi
cians to perform and keep up a
presence in the community."
Peter Katz, the Director of
Marketing and Communications
for Stanford Lively Arts, noted
that the financial troubles of the
symphony should not affect the
annual Independence Day Con
cert in the future.
"I don't think it affects [Stan
ford Lively Arts] directly per se
since we have our concerts
booked for the next few years,"
said Katz. "[The symphony has

been] kind enough to honor their
commitment. In fact, they were
anxious to play on July 3, but in
the future we will have to decide
what we want to do with the July
3rd celebration instead."
At this year's program, Leonid
Grin conducted the Orchestra in
American-themed tunes such as
the "Star-Spangled Banner,"
"Fanfare for the Common Man"
and "Porgy and Bess: A Sym
phonic Picture." The evening
ended with John Philip Sousa's
Stars and Stripes Forever signal
ing the start of the fireworks dis
