Cheikha Remitti, Issa Bagayoco, PlB
AND SPECIAL GUEST HUUN-HUUR-TU
Sunday, July 14, 5:30 pm / Frost Amphitheater
Gates open at 4:30 pm
World music reverberates through beautiful Frost
Amphitheater this summer. Sit outside, picnic with
friends, and enjoy electrifying performances at this
exuberant festival imported from France.
CHEIKHA Remitti, the "grandmother of Algerian
ra'i music," burns hot like funk and sad like the
blues. A living legend, she belts out bawdy ballads
in a deep soulful rasp that could grate the hide off
a rhinoceros.
Malian singer/songwriter ISSA BAGAYOGO
infuses jazzy basslines, electronics, and strong
downtempo beats into Mali's centuries old
Wassoulou tradition. The result is hypnotic and
eminently danceable.
PI 8 takes its name from the 18th district of Paris,
the hippest and most cosmopolitan section of the
city. The band fuses Cuban music and urban dance
electronica into a powerful Afro-Cuban dance beat
with a healthy dash of Caribbean spice.
Special guest HUUN-HUUR-TU, the spine
tingling throat singers of Tuva, dazzle listeners with
their unique ability to simultaneously sing multiple
tones from a single voice. "The Tuvans will ride into
your brain and leave hoofprints up and down your
spine." (San Francisco Bay Guardian)
$35/ chair; $30/ lawn
Please note:
Lawn, beach and folding chairs, large coolers, strollers,
wagons, umbrellas, barbecue grills, and pets are not permitted
at these performances. No smoking.
