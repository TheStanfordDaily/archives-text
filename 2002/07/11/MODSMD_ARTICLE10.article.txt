## DISPATCHES FROM THE OUTER DARKNESS Here comes the bride 
### MARK GANEK STAFF COLUMNIST 
The summer days are so beauti
ful that one almost forgets the op
pressive heat and sun. I'd have to
say that summer is my favorite sea
son, apart from a few others. And
while spring is generally thought to
be the season for love, summer is
universally recognized as the sea
son during which your ex-girl
friend gets married. And by uni
versally, I mean by me.
But even when one does not ac
count for egocentric cosmology,
the marriage of an ex-girlfriend is a
momentous occasion in a man's
life. It is one of the little signs that
he is no longer young, much like
ear-hair growth or voting Republi
can. The wedding bells barely
drown out the sound of Age's with
ered foot stomping near. And do
not ask for whom the foot strolls, it
strolls for me.
To be perfectly clear about it,
one of my ex-girlfriends has gotten
married. This event Hies in the face
of several natural laws. There is a
very strict procedure that, until
now, my ex-girlfriends have in
evitably followed.
First there is the wistful sighing,

then the stilled wailing and the
barely lived shadow-life and finally
the remainder of earthly days spent
in cloistered seclusion.
I am stunned at her flaunting of
protocol, but I do not wish her ill. I
realize that she rashly embarked
on this stable, healthy and loving
relationship only to conceal her
wounded longing for the arduous
and unfulfilling dalliance she had
so unceremoniously broken oil
with me. You can't help but feel
sorry for her.
Marriage itself is a little suspect in
my book. I tend to overrule myself
several times a day, and I shouldn't
be let anywhere near decisions that
would affect the remainder of any
one's life, much less my own.
And honestly, what kind of
damaged person would want to
spend that much time with me? To
paraphrase Groucho Marx, I
refuse to belong to any marriage
that would have me as a member.
And the practice of marriage is
even more dubious than its theory.
It shocks me to this day that people
marry their high-school sweet
hearts. I can't imagine how anyone
with even a few mangled tatters of
sanity left would do such a thing.
My parents are living proof.

They began dating in high school,
and look at them now. Nobody can
be as wonderful, well-adjusted and
loving as they are without being se
verely deranged.
And during these summer days
you can hardly sneeze without ru
ining the cake at a Stanford cou
ple's marriage. These smug, Stan
ford marriages are even worse than
those of high-school sweethearts.
Every action of the bride and
groom seems to shout, "Look at us.
We're successful and happy and

athletic and our children are going
to be superhuman pod-people
chosen by the government to be
launched into space to perpetuate
the species when the apocalypse
comes and you're single and miser
able." Luckily, this is not true. The
government will most likely bury
the pod people beneath the polar
ice caps. Shooting them into space
would just be silly.
1 do want to say that I wish my
ex-girlfriend nothing but the best,
though I really could've done with

out the wedding and honeymoon
photos. I do not want to discourage
all of you readers out there from
enjoying years of marital bliss with
wonderful husbands or wives, and
perhaps both. And for all you kids
out there, remember: Marriage,
like death, is a natural part of life.
