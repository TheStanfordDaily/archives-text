# LETTER TO THE EDITOR

ITie words "under Cod" in the
Pledge of Allegiance are perfectly
appropriate under our system of
constitutional law, and Joseph
Lemon ("Pledge ruling really a fair
interpretation of the law," July 5)
misses the big picture when he sup
ports the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court's
decision (now stayed pending ap
peal) that these words violate the Es
tablishment Clause of the First
Amendment. At first glance, these
words seem to violate the "three
pronged" test elucidated in 1971 by
the U.S. Supreme Court in Lemon
vs. Kurtzman. But diat case has been
the subject of intense criticism and,
in recent years, the Supreme Court
has relied upon it less and less.
The Lemon test is controversial,
unsettled and p<x>r guidance for de
termining the constitutionality of
the Pledge of Allegiance. Judge Al
fred Coodwin's strict, and technical,
interpretation of the First Amend
ment would require us to abolish the
printing of "In God We Trust" on
national currency and the swearing

in of the president with his hand on
the Bible. That would be ridiculous.
Each one of these traditions is an im
portant part of contemporary public
life. 'ITie references to Cod are sim
ple, unobtrusive, and minimal.
'Hie law recognizes "ancient tra
ditions" as an exception to the Es
tablishment Clause. The adoption of
the words "under God" in the 1950s
belies the fact that they have been an
ancient tradition since this country's
founding. 'Hie Declaration of Inde
pendence, which we celebrated last
week, says "that all men are created
equal, that they are endowed by
their Creator with certain unalien
able Rights." Thomas Jefferson
wrote these words as a clear tribute
to Cod. Many of the Founding Fa
thers were Deists who believed in a
Supreme Being. The concept was
imprinted into our nation's birth
certificate on July 4,1776.
Commentators have said that
Goodwin's decision is "technically"
correct. But the law is an organic
force that rests, as Justice Ruth

Bader Ginsburg said, on "the cli
mate, not the weather, of our times."
An overwhelming 95 percent of
Americans believe in God. Iliat's
the climate of our times. The public's
confidence is the bedrock of out
legal system. Their faith in the accu
racy, fairness, and ultimate truth of
judicial determinations sustains the
legal system and keeps us living
under die rule of law.
Goodwin's decision threatens the
judicial system's fundamental credi
bility. People lose faith in a system
that is unmoored from their princi
pal source of values-in our case,
God. ITiose three letters form a nor
mative expression of the collective
values in America.
The judiciary is already, as
Alexander Hamilton said, the "least
dangerous branch of government."
Indeed, it is the weakest. Goodwin's
decision would make it even weaker.
Judges rely on the executive branch
to enforce all of their decisions. That
is a fundamental limitation. It means
their decisions are only as gwxl as

the president who enforces them
and, in this case, President George
W. Bush has very little incentive to
enforce a ban on the words "under
God." That is the real reason why
Goodwin's decision was withdrawn
so quickly for the entire Ninth Gir
cuit to consider and, most likely,
overturn, before it leads to a crisis in
public confidence.
Judges are enmeshed in a system
of checks and balances and, to an
extent, they too are political instru
ments. They need the public's trust,
confidence, and respect. The judi
ciary should not provoke a show
down with the other branches of
government.
Imagine the potential impact of
Goodwin's decision. It would not be
readily enforced. As an example,
the famous Brown vs. Board of Ed
ucation decision of 1954 took
decades to implement with follow
up litigation, injunctions and de
crees obtained in district courts
around the country. That was a
worthwhile fight. This one is not.

To implement Good win's decision
would require litigation against lit
tle schools all over the country
where children say "under God" in
the morning pledge. That is not the
type of litigation this country needs.
I can appreciate Joe Lemon's
technical reading of the Lemon v.
Kurtzman standard. However, I
cannot believe that either G(x>dwin
or Joe Lemon is to be taken serious
ly. Neither do 99 U.S. Senators who
recently voted their full support for
the pledge.
This is a nation "of the people, by
the people, and for the people." ITie
laws serve us, not the other way
around. In this case, the people have
spoken clearly and crisply with their
immediate outrage to Goodwin's
decision. Their cry should be prop
er humiliation for Goodwin and
others who believe that courts are
entitled to make technical decisions
that violate the fundamental values
of the people whom t hey serve.

unsettled and p<x>r guidance for de
termining the constitutionality of
the Pledge of Allegiance. Judge Al
fred Coodwin's strict, and technical,
interpretation of the First Amend
ment would require us to abolish the
printing of "In God We Trust" on
national currency and the swearing

in of the president with his hand on
the Bible. That would be ridiculous.
Each one of these traditions is an im
portant part of contemporary public
life. 'ITie references to Cod are sim
ple, unobtrusive, and minimal.
'Hie law recognizes "ancient tra
ditions" as an exception to the Es
tablishment Clause. The adoption of
the words "under God" in the 1950s
belies the fact that they have been an
ancient tradition since this country's
founding. 'Hie Declaration of Inde
pendence, which we celebrated last
week, says "that all men are created
equal, that they are endowed by
their Creator with certain unalien
able Rights." Thomas Jefferson
wrote these words as a clear tribute
to Cod. Many of the Founding Fa
thers were Deists who believed in a
Supreme Being. The concept was
imprinted into our nation's birth
certificate on July 4,1776.
Commentators have said that
Goodwin's decision is "technically"
correct. But the law is an organic
force that rests, as Justice Ruth

Bader Ginsburg said, on "the cli
mate, not the weather, of our times."
An overwhelming 95 percent of
Americans believe in God. Iliat's
the climate of our times. The public's
confidence is the bedrock of out
legal system. Their faith in the accu
racy, fairness, and ultimate truth of
judicial determinations sustains the
legal system and keeps us living
under die rule of law.
Goodwin's decision threatens the
judicial system's fundamental credi
bility. People lose faith in a system
that is unmoored from their princi
pal source of values-in our case,
God. ITiose three letters form a nor
mative expression of the collective
values in America.
The judiciary is already, as
Alexander Hamilton said, the "least
dangerous branch of government."
Indeed, it is the weakest. Goodwin's
decision would make it even weaker.
Judges rely on the executive branch
to enforce all of their decisions. That
is a fundamental limitation. It means
their decisions are only as gwxl as

the president who enforces them
and, in this case, President George
W. Bush has very little incentive to
enforce a ban on the words "under
God." That is the real reason why
Goodwin's decision was withdrawn
so quickly for the entire Ninth Gir
cuit to consider and, most likely,
overturn, before it leads to a crisis in
public confidence.
Judges are enmeshed in a system
of checks and balances and, to an
extent, they too are political instru
ments. They need the public's trust,
confidence, and respect. The judi
ciary should not provoke a show
down with the other branches of
government.
Imagine the potential impact of
Goodwin's decision. It would not be
readily enforced. As an example,
the famous Brown vs. Board of Ed
ucation decision of 1954 took
decades to implement with follow
up litigation, injunctions and de
crees obtained in district courts
around the country. That was a
worthwhile fight. This one is not.

To implement Good win's decision
would require litigation against lit
tle schools all over the country
where children say "under God" in
the morning pledge. That is not the
type of litigation this country needs.
I can appreciate Joe Lemon's
technical reading of the Lemon v.
Kurtzman standard. However, I
cannot believe that either G(x>dwin
or Joe Lemon is to be taken serious
ly. Neither do 99 U.S. Senators who
recently voted their full support for
the pledge.
This is a nation "of the people, by
the people, and for the people." ITie
laws serve us, not the other way
around. In this case, the people have
spoken clearly and crisply with their
immediate outrage to Goodwin's
decision. Their cry should be prop
er humiliation for Goodwin and
others who believe that courts are
entitled to make technical decisions
that violate the fundamental values
of the people whom t hey serve.
