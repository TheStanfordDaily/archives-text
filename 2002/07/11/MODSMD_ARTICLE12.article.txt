## Blame Snackwells, not Southwest 
### JOE LEMON STAFF COLUMNIST 
Southwest Airlines recently de
cided to begin enforcing a 22-year
old policy of charging higher
prices to large passengers whose
frames extend beyond the bound
ary of the airline's 18-inch coach
class seats. The decision has been
controversial, with overweight
people complaining that the policy
discriminates against the obese.
Maybe these complainers should
lay oft the french fries if they want
to fly the friendly skies.
While it's true that Southwest's
coach seats might not provide gen
erous accommodations, their 18-
inch size is reasonable. Consider
the geometry: assuming that the
width of the chair roughly approx
imates the diameter of a human
being, that means that a person
would have to have a waist size of
nearly 60 inches before he or she
would spill over into the next seat.
That's almost 3 Britney Spearses!
All Southwest is doing is allocat
ing the cost of obesity to the source
of the problem. When people
want to move into a bigger apart
ment, it costs more. Why should
there be any difference when a
person's rear end consumes more
real estate?
The Centers for Disease Con
trol describes obesity in America
as an epidemic. Indeed, since

1991, the incidence of adult obe
sity has risen by 60 percent! Obe
sity-related diseases lead to
300,000 premature deaths annu
ally, second only to tobacco in
killing Americans.
Tobacco companies are de
scribed as ruthless murderers in
guerrilla advertising campaigns
and civil lawsuits. Yet, nobody
wants to assign the blame for their
obesity to Frito-Lay, Anheuser-
Busch, McDonalds or (gasp!)
themselves. By the way, does any
one else think it's curious that
Kraft foods used to be owned by
R.J. Reynolds and is now a sub
sidiary of Philip Morris?
That's right: the culprit respon
sible for America's expanding
waistlines is our good old friend,
capitalism. The benefits of a bal
anced diet and regular exercise
are well-documented, but some
how Doritos and Snackwells man
age to have a greater stronghold
over our attention than any study
issued by the New England Jour
nal of Medicine.
By adding saturated fats,
countless sweeteners and
enough preservatives to embalm
a cat, food "manufacturers" are
able to develop products that
cost less to produce, sell like hot
cakes and can sit on store shelves
into the next millennium. These
all result in greater profits to
shareholders.

And, now, it seems that the an
tidote is a dose of the very same
market forces that led to the mass
obesity in the first place. It would
be nice if people ate more reason
ably and exercised more regular
ly simply because such behavior
improves their health. But, if
that's not enough incentive, per
haps an appeal to the pocketbook
will curtail the consumption of
Hot Pockets.
More likely, it will take those
ravenous lawyers that give the
legal profession its reputation to
bring suits against the snack com
panies. Can't you see the Congres
sional hearings now: "No, Mr.
Chairman, I do not believe that
Oreos are addictive."
Until that happens, how will
these fat people be able to afford
higher ticket prices on Southwest
Airlines? Here's a suggestion: hold
off'on supersizing that next Happy
Meal, and stuff" the savings in your
piggy bank. Or, try collective ac
tion: How about a hunger strike?
