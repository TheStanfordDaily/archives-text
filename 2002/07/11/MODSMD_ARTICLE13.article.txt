## Seven steps to becoming French 
### Ql ZHAI GUEST COLUMNIST 
Paris ... city of lights, city of ro
mance, city of. . . awkward T
shirt-and-cargo-shorts-clad Amer
ican tourists? Yes, it's true. Thou
sands of these unfitting beings dart
around this jardin-dotted city
broadcasting their "1 Am A
Tourist" radar signals and being
oblivious to the general ambience
of sophistication in Paris.
These are the people who per
sistently mispronounce Metro sta
tion names, sometimes adding a
Georgian twang and speak at inel
egantly loud volumes.
Should you, dear reader, one
clay have the good fortune of find
ing yourself in Paris for longer than
a tour-bus-bound week, please
avoid touristy faux pas. Follow these
tips to becoming a real Parisiev(m):
Getting around Paris
• When crossing streets, ignore
pedestrian traffic lights. Walk with

authority as if you have every right
to be on the road, as all Parisians
do. Timidly waiting for the pedes
trian green will only give away
your Galifornian roots.
• Buy a Carte Orange. A monthly
or weekly Metro ticket will save you
the money and hassle of buying a
new ticket every time you go some
where. Plus, it's proof that you're a
com mi tted Parisien(ne).
• Put on a "Metro face." This is
the best advice a darling friend
gave to me. Leave your Sunshine
Galifornian Smile at home when
you head for the Metro.
If you are a girl, in certain
quartiers, a friendly smile is read
not so much as a greeting as it is
an invitation, and since most
French men tend to look like Ger
ard Depardieu and not Vincent
Perez, beware.
• Once you're familiar with your
own quartier, stop to give directions
in French, to French people. It'll
boost your confidence it) becoming
an authentic Parisian.

Looking and sounding French
• Blase is always a la mode. Take in
the wonders of the city, but be re
served about it. Cawking will only
give you away as an American or
someone from the south of France.
• If you are a smoker, light up every
where, beginning with the baggage
claim at the airport. Actually obey
ing the "No Smoking" signs are a
dead giveaway of a tourist.
• If you are from the American
South, absolutely and at all costs
leave any strong twang you may
have at home. The French are not
fond of Americans in general, and
even less so of those they think
sound like George W. Bush.
