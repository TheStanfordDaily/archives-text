# Dilemma of the carless
## 
### JEN GRAHAM GUEST COLUMNIST 
The rising sophomore is a unique
species. Torn from the incubating
environment of the freshman dorm,
it is cast out into the sea of University
life, faced with new concerns that
plague throughout the summer, ft
muses, in its still nascent Stanford
ese vernacular: "Without a PAA,
how will I formulate my four-year
plan? And if the ASSU's transporta
tion initiatives prove fruitless, how
will I get Fro Yo?"
Careful observation reveals
that, contrary to what the layper
son would suspect, this last
quandary causes particular anxi
ety. Indeed, an acute knowledge
of the ins and outs of Stanford life
reveals the true cause of this fes
tering apprehension.
Vroom vroom. Beep. As the
Neon once said, "Hello."
All, yes, the rising sophomore is
faced with the reality of another
year of Stanford life without a
motor-operated vehicle — this
time not because of campus law,
but rather the harsh logistical reali
ties of life. The rising sophomore
trembles from the implications of
such a circumstance: "Another year
of the Domino's guy knowing me
by name. Anot her year of my week
end entertainment consisting sole
ly of watching (gulp) SCBN."
As is more than blatantly obvi
ous, the outlook is rather bleak for
our fine Cardinal friend.
Yet hope is not lost. A dedicated
team of researchers has identified
the main obstacles that life's reali
ties present. For this student, I ad
dress these obstacles below and
propose several courses of action.
(Obstacle one: Visualize a person
rubbing their thumb against their
index and middle fingers. That's
right, money.
For the average sophomore,
there is no doubt that funds are the
largest barrier separating you from
a phat ride, or any ride.
Realistically, it is impossible for
many students to overcome the
cha-ching consideration. The
$38,000 price tag of Stanford alone
is a huge burden, and fora sub
stantial portion ofStanfordians, the
combined fixed and variable costs
of a car are simply too great.
For these Farmers, the options
are simple. I larass your roommate.
Manipulation can go a long way.
Make them listen to tapes of
revving engines in their sleep and
before you know it, you'll be cruis
ing down El Camino Real.
For those who are lucky enough
to have the option of owning a ve
hicle, Sum ford is full of under-uti
lized ways to earn a few bucks,
which you'll need, because keeping
your junker up to California's
emission standards is no small task.
The Psychology Department is a
thriving entity, willing to pay über
bucks for only half an hour of work.

If you don't mind watching violent
images while eager psych majors
take notes on you, you've got 30
bucks. Do that twice a week all year
and there's 1800 bucks. Auto insur
ance: done.
And don't forget gas. But that's
where your trusty Stanford Daily
comes in. Perpetually in need for
writers, The Daily will pay the rising
sophomore to pen what amounts to
only one-fourth of an I HUM paper.
In the fall, call news at 5-2100, exten
sion 504, and ask for Jen.
If you still need a bit more fora
down payment, just make up a fake
club and whore yourself out to The
(that's a capital T) Stanford Fund.
The obvious solution here is to
bring that car you drove in high
school, which brings us to the other
fly-trap in the quest for mobility:
Obstacle two: Parents.
When it comes to cars, Mom
and Dad can majorly cramp your
style, like that babysitter who
never let you stay up late. Unfor
tunately, our rising sophomore,
still under the overly-cautious
thumbs of its domestic overlords,
needs their consent.
They will say: "There's no park
ing anyway."
Rebuttal: Freshmen don't even
have cars and they could find a way
to park in the Branner lot, so obvi
ously this is a moot point.
They will say: "You don't have
any time to be going anywhere in
a car."
Rebuttal: You seemed to have
found time to imbibe numerous al
coholic beverages last year and still
pulled a 3.95 GPA, so is it such a
crime if instead of hitting the Row
one night, you hit the AMC Merca
do? Being the minors you are, you'll
go bowling, not clubbing. Just don't
tell them about your fake ID.
They will say: "Well, what would
you actually do with a car?"
Rebuttal: Say you live 45 min
utes from the cultural Mecca that is
San Francisco, yet its myriad trea
sures are lost to you. If this doesn't
work, go for the jugular by getting
Darwinian.
Simply remind them that many
individuals do find their mates at
college but that the on-campus
"dating" scene at Stanford consists
of drunken frat hook-ups. Gently
state that if they ever want to have
legitimate grandkids, their resis
tance is counter-productive aqd
they need to give it up, so that you
can (in a morally sound manner,
after graduation, when you and
your Stanford honey have wed, of
course).
While the obstacles are many,
the only thing standing between
the rising sophomore and a vehicle
is a willingness to light the good
fight. Godspeed.

ance: done.
And don't forget gas. But that's
where your trusty Stanford Daily
comes in. Perpetually in need for
writers, The Daily will pay the rising
sophomore to pen what amounts to
only one-fourth of an I HUM paper.
In the fall, call news at 5-2100, exten
sion 504, and ask for Jen.
If you still need a bit more fora
down payment, just make up a fake
club and whore yourself out to The
(that's a capital T) Stanford Fund.
The obvious solution here is to
bring that car you drove in high
school, which brings us to the other
fly-trap in the quest for mobility:
Obstacle two: Parents.
When it comes to cars, Mom
and Dad can majorly cramp your
style, like that babysitter who
never let you stay up late. Unfor
tunately, our rising sophomore,
still under the overly-cautious
thumbs of its domestic overlords,
needs their consent.
They will say: "There's no park
ing anyway."
Rebuttal: Freshmen don't even
have cars and they could find a way
to park in the Branner lot, so obvi
ously this is a moot point.
They will say: "You don't have
any time to be going anywhere in
a car."
Rebuttal: You seemed to have
found time to imbibe numerous al
coholic beverages last year and still
pulled a 3.95 GPA, so is it such a
crime if instead of hitting the Row
one night, you hit the AMC Merca
do? Being the minors you are, you'll
go bowling, not clubbing. Just don't
tell them about your fake ID.
They will say: "Well, what would
you actually do with a car?"
Rebuttal: Say you live 45 min
utes from the cultural Mecca that is
San Francisco, yet its myriad trea
sures are lost to you. If this doesn't
work, go for the jugular by getting
Darwinian.
Simply remind them that many
individuals do find their mates at
college but that the on-campus
"dating" scene at Stanford consists
of drunken frat hook-ups. Gently
state that if they ever want to have
legitimate grandkids, their resis
tance is counter-productive aqd
they need to give it up, so that you
can (in a morally sound manner,
after graduation, when you and
your Stanford honey have wed, of
course).
While the obstacles are many,
the only thing standing between
the rising sophomore and a vehicle
is a willingness to light the good
fight. Godspeed.

The rising sophomore is a unique
species. Torn from the incubating
environment of the freshman dorm,
it is cast out into the sea of University
life, faced with new concerns that
plague throughout the summer, ft
muses, in its still nascent Stanford
ese vernacular: "Without a PAA,
how will I formulate my four-year
plan? And if the ASSU's transporta
tion initiatives prove fruitless, how
will I get Fro Yo?"
Careful observation reveals
that, contrary to what the layper
son would suspect, this last
quandary causes particular anxi
ety. Indeed, an acute knowledge
of the ins and outs of Stanford life
reveals the true cause of this fes
tering apprehension.
Vroom vroom. Beep. As the
Neon once said, "Hello."
All, yes, the rising sophomore is
faced with the reality of another
year of Stanford life without a
motor-operated vehicle — this
time not because of campus law,
but rather the harsh logistical reali
ties of life. The rising sophomore
trembles from the implications of
such a circumstance: "Another year
of the Domino's guy knowing me
by name. Anot her year of my week
end entertainment consisting sole
ly of watching (gulp) SCBN."
As is more than blatantly obvi
ous, the outlook is rather bleak for
our fine Cardinal friend.
Yet hope is not lost. A dedicated
team of researchers has identified
the main obstacles that life's reali
ties present. For this student, I ad
dress these obstacles below and
propose several courses of action.
(Obstacle one: Visualize a person
rubbing their thumb against their
index and middle fingers. That's
right, money.
For the average sophomore,
there is no doubt that funds are the
largest barrier separating you from
a phat ride, or any ride.
Realistically, it is impossible for
many students to overcome the
cha-ching consideration. The
$38,000 price tag of Stanford alone
is a huge burden, and fora sub
stantial portion ofStanfordians, the
combined fixed and variable costs
of a car are simply too great.
For these Farmers, the options
are simple. I larass your roommate.
Manipulation can go a long way.
Make them listen to tapes of
revving engines in their sleep and
before you know it, you'll be cruis
ing down El Camino Real.
For those who are lucky enough
to have the option of owning a ve
hicle, Sum ford is full of under-uti
lized ways to earn a few bucks,
which you'll need, because keeping
your junker up to California's
emission standards is no small task.
The Psychology Department is a
thriving entity, willing to pay über
bucks for only half an hour of work.

If you don't mind watching violent
images while eager psych majors
take notes on you, you've got 30
bucks. Do that twice a week all year
and there's 1800 bucks. Auto insur
ance: done.
And don't forget gas. But that's
