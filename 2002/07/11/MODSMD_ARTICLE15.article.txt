## Cardinal tennis champions swing into pro ranks 
### JIMMY WU STAFF WRITER 
Down a set and a break at 4-3, with her
opponent having yet to give up a service
game, Laura Granville was in trouble.
With her back against the wall, Granville
was treading on some relatively unfamiliar
territory.

However, on this occasion, she was not
facing any ordinary collegiate opponent.
Instead, die woman bouncing the ball and
readying her serve across the net from
Granville was none other than U.S.
women's tennis great Mary Pierce, a former
champion of the French and Australian
Opens.
Accustomed to dominating collegiate

tennis during her two years at Stanford,
Granville was playing in the biggest
match of her life in the third round of the
Wimbledon Championships held two
weeks ago.
To the delight of her fans, the then
134th-ranked Granville did not disappoint.
With her signature consistency and solid
groundstroke game, Granville was able to
regain the break in the second set, and
went on to hold her own serve before
breaking Pierce again for the set.
The first-time Wimbledon qualifier pro
ceeded to dampen Pierce's spirits, taking
advantage of the momentum shift by clos
ing out the third set in typical Granville
style fora 3-6, 6-4, 6-1 victory.
In an interview after her huge victory
against Pierce, Granville reflected on the
match.
"Playing against Mary Pierce, it almost
didn't feel real," she said. "I can't really de
scribe it. At the end of the third set, 1 really
didn't even feel that much pressure just be
cause it didn't really feel real."
With the win, Granville advanced into
the Round of 16, joining an elite American
group of Jennifer Capriati, Chanda Rubin,
Lisa Raymond, Monica Seles, Venus
Williams and eventual Wimbledon champi
on Serena Williams.
Granville faced ninth-seeded Amelie
Mauresmo of France in the next round,
and her Cinderella run at the All-England
Club ended with a 6-2, 6-2 loss.
With her successful run at Wimbledon,
Granville leapt from 134 to 91, a career
high, in the Sanex WFATour rankings.
According to Granville, her recent expe

rience was almost too good to be true.
"It was definitely a little surreal to find
myself so far at Wimbledon," she said. "I re
membered watching 'Breakfast at Wimble
don' every year when I was growing up, so
playing at Wimbledon is a dream come true
for me."
Adding to the magnitude of her latest
achievement was the fact that Granville had
to first qualify for the main draw by winning
three matches in three days. By the time she
ended her Wimbledon run, she had played
six matches in a week and a half.
In order to earn her chance against
Pierce, the former Stanford star upset 31st
seeded Australian Nicole Pratt in the first
round, 7-5, 7-5, and then defeated German
Marlene Weingartner, 6-3, 6-4, in the sec
ond round.
It has been little more than a year since
she raised the trophy for both the NCAA
Team and Individual Singles Champi
onships; and Granville showed that she lias
slowly acclimated to the rigors of the pro
fessional ranks.
"1 think it takes a while to adjust to the
WTATour," she said. "I knew the Tour was
going to be difficult coming out of college
because the depth of good players is in
credible. So, I wasn't very surprised with
how difficult it was to adjust to that level. I
think the confidence to believe you can play
with the top Tour players is very important
and that only comes with time and experi
ence."
Before making splashes at Wimbledon,
Granville spent her first year out of college
