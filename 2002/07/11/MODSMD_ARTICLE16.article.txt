### TERRY HURLBUTT EDITORIAL STAFF 
The festivities lasted all weekend long for
the U.S. women's water polo team at the
Holiday Cup tournament held at the Avery
Aquatic Center.
The United States brought home the cup
for the third-consecutive year after defeating
rival Canada 8-6 in the championship game
on Sunday night.
The win came only two days after the
team tied Canada 2-2 on the opening day of
tournament play.
Playing in its largest American-hosted in
ternational tournament of the season, Team
USA came ready to make a strong showing
against powerhouses Canada, Brazil and
Japan.
After its opening game against Canada,
the women trounced Brazil 14-2 on Friday
night.
The American offensive assault came
from all directions as 10 different players
scored on the night. Team captain Heather
Moody, Ericka Lorenz, and Stanford alum

na and former Olympian Ellen Estes tossed
in two apiece.
The team turned next to Japan, whose
success of late has increased their interna
tional recognition and made them an oppo
nent to be reckoned with.
The Japanese team proved its mettle
early on in the match by closing the Ameri
can lead to 3-2 at the end of the first half.
Third quarter goals by Lorenz and Stanford
junior Brenda Villa, who led all scorers in
the game with two goals, helped cushion the
lead before Thalia Munro threw in another
with 2:44 remaining to play. The 6-3 win
moved the United States into the champi
onship game, setting up a rematch with
Canada.
After defeating the United States in a pre
tournament exhibition match and stuffing
the team during last year's bronze medal
game at the World Championships held in
Japan, the U.S. women's water polo team
was looking fora little revenge against Team
Canada.
