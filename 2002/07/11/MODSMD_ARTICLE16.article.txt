# U.S. women collect third-consecutive Holiday Cup
## 
### TERRY HURLBUTT EDITORIAL STAFF 
The festivities lasted all weekend long for
the U.S. women's water polo team at the
Holiday Cup tournament held at the Avery
Aquatic Center.
The United States brought home the cup
for the third-consecutive year after defeating
rival Canada 8-6 in the championship game
on Sunday night.
The win came only two days after the
team tied Canada 2-2 on the opening day of
tournament play.
Playing in its largest American-hosted in
ternational tournament of the season, Team
USA came ready to make a strong showing
against powerhouses Canada, Brazil and
Japan.
After its opening game against Canada,
the women trounced Brazil 14-2 on Friday
night.
The American offensive assault came
from all directions as 10 different players
scored on the night. Team captain Heather
Moody, Ericka Lorenz, and Stanford alum

na and former Olympian Ellen Estes tossed
in two apiece.
The team turned next to Japan, whose
success of late has increased their interna
tional recognition and made them an oppo
nent to be reckoned with.
The Japanese team proved its mettle
early on in the match by closing the Ameri
can lead to 3-2 at the end of the first half.
Third quarter goals by Lorenz and Stanford
junior Brenda Villa, who led all scorers in
the game with two goals, helped cushion the
lead before Thalia Munro threw in another
with 2:44 remaining to play. The 6-3 win
moved the United States into the champi
onship game, setting up a rematch with
Canada.
After defeating the United States in a pre
tournament exhibition match and stuffing
the team during last year's bronze medal
game at the World Championships held in
Japan, the U.S. women's water polo team
was looking fora little revenge against Team
Canada.

The U.S. women's national team brought home its third-consecutive Holiday Cup after defeating
rival Canada 8-6 in the championship game held at the Avery Aquatic Center.
"They're a good team, no question about
it," said head coach Guy Baker. "But we al
ways step up our game against them. It's a
reflex."
The United States delivered a solid win
behind three goals by Villa, who was named
the tournament's most valuable player.
Coralie Simmons added four goals of her
own and led all tournament scorers with
seven goals, including one in the final game's
opening seconds.
Boasting one of the most talented rosters
in the world, the United States is looking to
make a name for itself on the road to the
2004 Summer Olympics.
The 2000 silver-medalists in Sydney, the
Americans began training together again in
June. Foes turned into friends as Pacific-10
Conference rivals reunited as teammates.
Little over a month ago Stanford stars

Villa, Estes and Margie Dingeldein battled it
out with UCLA rivals (and now national
teammates) Robin Beauregard, Simmons,
Munro and Amber Stachowski in the NCAA
championship game — a contest which Stan
ford won.
Baker, who coached at UCI A, admits to
watching the NCAA matches with mixed
feelings.
"It's hard to watch them play against each
other sometimes," said Baker. "We all spend
so much time together during the year that
when they're playing each other, I feel like a
parent watching my kids compete. I derive
no pleasure from it whatsoever. It's tough.
But the games are always good and it'll be a
strong rivalry for a long time."
For now it's simply Team USA, and the
strength and talent of its collegiate rivals
have made it the team to beat in the interna
tional arena.
With the talent displayed at the Holiday
Cup, it appears that the team's desired desti
nation, the gold medal podium in Athens,
might not be too far away.
