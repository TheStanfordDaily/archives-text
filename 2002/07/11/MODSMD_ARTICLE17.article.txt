# Stanford swimmers diving in and heating up
## Cardinal stars better times and defend titles at Santa Clara Grand Prix 
### KENNETH GARRETT EDITORIAL STAFF 
It's summer and the sun is shining, which
for most people means it's time to jump in
the pool. You may have the best cannon-ball
on the block, but when it comes to swim
ming, leave it to the Stanford men's and
women's swimming teams to show you how
it's done.
The Santa Clara Grand Prix — which ran
from June 28 to June 30 at the George
Haines International Swim Center in Santa
Clara — featured many of the biggest names
in the swimming world, including some of
Stanford's brightest stars.
Former Stanford swimmer Tara Kirk es
tablished her dominance early in the sum
mer with wins in her two signature events,
the 100 and 200 meter breaststroke. The
NCAA champion in both events, Kirk was
also the defending Santa Clara champion in
the 100 breast. This year she set personal
and meet records with a time of 1 minute,
9.26 seconds.
"I've been training really hard lately,"
said Kirk. "I'm really pleased to go a person
al best."
On the men's side, alum Randall Bal had
an outstanding performance in the 200
backstroke, finishing a close second to senior
Markus Rogan. It was in the 50 freestyle,
however, that Bal really shone. His time of
23.33 was good enough for the win — but
more importantly, it reminded his competi
tion that he won a world title last summer,

and that he intends to stay at the head of the
pack in 2002.
"I'm very happy with how I swam
tonight," said Bal. "We've been training
hard lately, so I think I swam about where I
should be."
Bal was also part of the group of Cardinal
standouts that took first through fourth
places in the 100 meter backstroke. Rogan
(56.76), Peter Marshall (56.80), Jayme
Cramer (57.11) and Bal (57.37) — three of
whom are ranked second in the world in var
ious backstroke events — proved once again
that Stanford's backstroke stars simply can
not be beat.
Fora normal person, Rogan's perfor
mance would have been one for the ages but,
for him, it was just a warmup to bigger events
this summer. Rogan crushed the competi
tion at Santa Clara, taking first not only in
the 100 backstroke, but also the 200 IM
(2:02.85) and the 200 backstroke (2:00.99).
Rogan's second-place finish in the 400 IM
in 4:19.85 was only .03 seconds behind the
winner, but he was far from disappointed —
his outstanding performance earned him an
Austrian national record.
"I had no expectations, and 1 think that
helped me," said Rogan. "I was able to relax
the whole way and just swim my race."
With these wins, a strong third-place fin
ish in the 800 freestyle and contributions to
various relays, Rogan was the recipient of the
annual High-Point Award for the second
consecutive year. Such great success this
early in the season undoubtedly struck fear
into the hearts of countless European swim
mers, as they will have to face Rogan at the
European Championships later this month.
Rogan's American teammates also have a
blockbuster event quickly approaching —
the Phillips 66 Summer National Champi-

onships. Five international teams will be se
lected at Summer Nationals in August: the
2002 Pan Pacific Championships team, the
2003 World Championships team, the 2003
Duel in the Pool team, the 2003 World Uni
versity Games team and the 2003 Pan Amer-

ican Games team.
I n preparation for nationals, the Cardina
men and women continue their summei
competition in Los Angeles for the Jane
Evans Invitational held July 18 through Jul)
21.
