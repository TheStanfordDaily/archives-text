# Abrupt and disappointing ending to All-Star Game
## Baseball commissioner Bud Selig makes call to end game tied at 7-7 after 11 innings 
### 
MILWAUKKE (AP) — Baseball commis
sioner Bud Selig vowed Wednesday to
make changes to the All-Star game to avoid
ties, but he said expanding the rosters isn't
the answer.
Selig said the sport needs to return to its
past, when managers didn't feel pressured
into using every player.
"There is a different bit of thinking
today," Selig said. "I'm not going to be crit
ical of the managers. They felt they were
doing the right thing and they got every
body in."
"But I think it's time (for change). We do
have 30 players. We've expanded the ros
ter. So, hopefully that should be enough."
Selig said he had a sleepless night after
calling off Tuesday's game with the score
tied, 7-7, after the 11th inning. Fans, who
paid up to $ 175 fora ticket, were outraged.
Selig called it a "horribly painful and
heartbreaking lesson."
"We will learn from this," he vowed.
" This will never happen again."
He said there was"a series of ways we
can solve it, but that's for another day. I've

talked to both managers and it's an easy
problem to solve once you know you have a
problem. But I didn't have that luxury."
Selig believed he had no choice but to
declare a tie when managers Bob Brenly
and Joe Torre told him they had run out of
players.
Brenly informed Selig that pitcher Vi
cente Padilla had trouble loosening up.
Selig said that if Padilla had been healthy,
he would have ordered the game to con
tinue.
Although Selig called the solutions easy,
he said they wouldn't be discussed until
after the season. But he suggested man
agers return to using starters deeper into
the game and discarding the pitcher-per
inning trend.
Selig said he thought All-Star games
have been managed differently since base
ball took a public relations beating in 1993,
when Mike Mussina, then with the Orioles,
didn't get into the All-Star game in Balti
more.
Selig said he had no other option Tues
day night but to call the game.
"Look, we can have the debate about
how you should use players in the All-Star
game, but we were past that," Selig said. "I
didn't have that option to sit and sort of
pontificate about what they should have
done. That's for another day.'"

Selig, already dealing with the possibili
ty of a strike and reports of steroid abuse in
baseball, said he understands the disap
pointment of the fans, but that no one was
more disappointed than him.
Many fans at Miller Park booed Selig's
decision and some threw bottles and give
away seat cushions onto the field.
"Joe Torre called just to find out how I
was doing," he said. "I spent a very lonely
and sad evening. It was a great, great five
days, but fora couple of minutes."
Selig said he would announce his deci
sion differently if he could do it over. Per
haps having a player announce the news to
the crowd would have been the way to go,
such as when Joe Girardi told a crowd at
Wrigley Field that a game was canceled
when Darryl Kile died, Selig said.
"That's the one thing I think we should
have done better," he said. "I'm not sure
anyone would want to come out and deliv
er that message."
Selig said he had a heavy heart when he
left Miller Park.
"Nobody wanted to play more than I
did, but I have to balance the concerns and
hopes of the fans against the welfare of the
players and the game," Selig said. "And
every so often you get caught in a really dif
ficult and sensitive situation. This is why
they have a commissioner, because some

body has to make those decisions."
And Selig said lie doesn't second-gues:
himself. Allowing a pitcher back into tin
game was out of the question.
"Joe and Bob were very nervous abou
that," he said. "Pitchers have showered
dressed, a lot of them gone."
What about allowing a position player tc
pitch?
"If you want to engage in another trav
esty, that would be it," Selig said. "Yes, o
course teams do it during the season whet
they're hopelessly behind and they don'
want to waste anybody in their bullpen. Bu
that was a very unattractive option and ont
that, at least in baseball, there's no suppor
for."
And Selig dismissed as gimmicky the no
tion of ending a tie with a home run derb)
much like soccer breaks a tie with ;
shootout.
"I can't find any support for that,"' Selig
said. "That's not the way to solve the prob
lem."
Selig also said he briefly considerec
naming co-MVl's before deciding not t(
name any.
"But this is a big honor, the game was ;
tie,"he said. "And it was just difficult tc
award under these circumstances, especial
ly because this was the first year we hac
named it in honor of Ted Williams."

talked to both managers and it's an easy
problem to solve once you know you have a
problem. But I didn't have that luxury."
Selig believed he had no choice but to
declare a tie when managers Bob Brenly
and Joe Torre told him they had run out of
players.
Brenly informed Selig that pitcher Vi
cente Padilla had trouble loosening up.
Selig said that if Padilla had been healthy,
he would have ordered the game to con
tinue.
Although Selig called the solutions easy,
he said they wouldn't be discussed until
after the season. But he suggested man
agers return to using starters deeper into
the game and discarding the pitcher-per
inning trend.
Selig said he thought All-Star games
have been managed differently since base
ball took a public relations beating in 1993,
when Mike Mussina, then with the Orioles,
didn't get into the All-Star game in Balti
more.
Selig said he had no other option Tues
day night but to call the game.
"Look, we can have the debate about
how you should use players in the All-Star
game, but we were past that," Selig said. "I
didn't have that option to sit and sort of
pontificate about what they should have
done. That's for another day.'"

Selig, already dealing with the possibili
ty of a strike and reports of steroid abuse in
baseball, said he understands the disap
pointment of the fans, but that no one was
more disappointed than him.
Many fans at Miller Park booed Selig's
decision and some threw bottles and give
away seat cushions onto the field.
"Joe Torre called just to find out how I
was doing," he said. "I spent a very lonely
and sad evening. It was a great, great five
days, but fora couple of minutes."
Selig said he would announce his deci
sion differently if he could do it over. Per
haps having a player announce the news to
the crowd would have been the way to go,
such as when Joe Girardi told a crowd at
Wrigley Field that a game was canceled
when Darryl Kile died, Selig said.
"That's the one thing I think we should
have done better," he said. "I'm not sure
anyone would want to come out and deliv
er that message."
Selig said he had a heavy heart when he
left Miller Park.
"Nobody wanted to play more than I
did, but I have to balance the concerns and
hopes of the fans against the welfare of the
players and the game," Selig said. "And
every so often you get caught in a really dif
ficult and sensitive situation. This is why
they have a commissioner, because some

body has to make those decisions."
And Selig said lie doesn't second-gues:
himself. Allowing a pitcher back into tin
game was out of the question.
"Joe and Bob were very nervous abou
that," he said. "Pitchers have showered
dressed, a lot of them gone."
What about allowing a position player tc
pitch?
"If you want to engage in another trav
esty, that would be it," Selig said. "Yes, o
course teams do it during the season whet
they're hopelessly behind and they don'
want to waste anybody in their bullpen. Bu
that was a very unattractive option and ont
that, at least in baseball, there's no suppor
for."
And Selig dismissed as gimmicky the no
tion of ending a tie with a home run derb)
much like soccer breaks a tie with ;
shootout.
"I can't find any support for that,"' Selig
said. "That's not the way to solve the prob
lem."
Selig also said he briefly considerec
naming co-MVl's before deciding not t(
name any.
"But this is a big honor, the game was ;
tie,"he said. "And it was just difficult tc
award under these circumstances, especial
ly because this was the first year we hac
named it in honor of Ted Williams."
