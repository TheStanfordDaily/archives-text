# Penalties cost California's football program
## 
### DAN URBAN STAFF WRITER 
The University of California at
Berkeley. Cal. The Golden Bears.
The Weenies. By any name, they
have lost the Big Game to Stan
ford seven years in a row.
With the Cardinal emerging
into the national spotlight as a
football powerhouse and Cal
being slapped with penalties for
academic and recruiting viola
tions, Stanford could keep pos
session of the legendary Axe for
as long as it collects Sears Cup tro
phies, read: indefinitely.
Big Game aside, the penalties
imposed by the NCAA are a seri
ous blow to the Bears, who strug
gled last year with a 1-10 record.

The charges levied against the
Cal football program concerning
some of its student athletes in
clude eligibility and recruiting vi
olations and academic fraud.
The history of the infractions
goes back at least five years, ac
cording to the NCAA.
The Pacific-10 Conference ear
lier ordered Cal to forfeit its 1999
victory over Arizona State because
some of the Cal players were ineli
gible. The Pac-10 also handed the
Bears a one-year probation
Now the NCAA has gone even
further, placing Cal on probation
for five years and ordering the
school to forfeit all 11 games of
that 1999 season in which ineligi
ble athletes played.
Additionally, Cal will lose nine

scholarships over the next five
seasons, as well as being banned
from the 2002 post season.
Given last year's performance,
that last penalty could be a moot
point.
The UC-Berkley administra
tion is appealing the decision, ac
cepting responsibility for its viola
tions but deeming the NCAA
penalties too harsh.
"We take violations of NCAA
rules very seriously at Cal," said
Chancellor Robert Berdahl. "In
the case of academic fraud, there
is no university that takes this
issue more seriously. For this iso
lated incident of academic impro
priety we accepted without chal
lenge scholarship loss and proba
tion from the Pac-10 â€” indeed we

self-imposed those sanctions."
Cal forfeited four of its own
scholarships, admitting that the
university had not done enough to
monitor and prevent violations.
The nine additional scholarship
losses and the post season ban im
posed by the NCAA, however,
came as a surprise to the adminis
tration.
"In the case of the additional
infractions, the NCAA-imposed
penalties appear unduly exces
sive, and that is why we have de
cided to appeal," Berdahl said.
The incident is doubly unfor
tunate for the Bears given that
the program has just been turned
over to a new coach, Jeff Tedford.
"It is unfortunate that a new ad
ministration and coaching staff must

bear this burden," said Ted ford.
However, Tedford seems opti
mistic about the future of the
Bears, and views this difficulty as
a short-term hurdle without any
serious long-term consequences.
"Obviously, we would like to
have a full complement of schol
arships and no bowl restrictions
this year," he said. "But I don't
expect this ruling to be an imped
iment for our football program
reaching its ultimate goals."
Athletic Director Steve Glad
stone regrets that the behavior of
a few student-athletes has tar
nished the image of their peers.
"As a whole, Cal features a
group of student athletes that can
rival any college in the United
States," said Gladstone.
