## 'Perdition' is a road worth taking 
### RAMIN SETOODEH EDITORIAL STAFF 
Sam Mendes's "Road to Perdition" has
been marketed as a traditional tale about
gangsters. But it's not a gangster movie, not
really anyway. The story involves a boy and
his father on the run, frightened but not help
less, who try to carve new lives for themselves.
They travel together for several months in the
winter of 1931, and what they learn along the
way is achingly poignant.

At the core of the film is Tom Hanks in one
of the best performances of his career. That is
a phrase that movie critics like to use. But
Tom Hanks, who has won two Academy
Awards, is always expected to be good. What
is surprising in "Perdition" is how good he ac
tually is. Almost every scene revolves around
his character, and he is wise enough to un
derscore the role with the subtlety and depth
that it needs.
Hanks stars as Michael Sullivan, a man
who works for the mob and doesn't fulfill any
of the gangster stereotypes. His boss, John
Rooney (Paul Newman), can be vicious and
uncompromising, but acts as a father figure to
him. The two men play the piano together at

a funeral parlor in the beginning of the film, a
scene that nicely demonstrates the sense of re
liance they share.
"Sons are put on this Earth to trouble their
fathers," Rooney says. He is right. The movie
shows us that in more ways than one.
Michael has two sons and is married to a
beautiful woman referred to in the press
notes as 'Wife.' She is played by Jennifer Jason
Leigh and, as Wife, she knows something
about Husband's dealings â€” but not as much

as she should. There is some confusion, and
then a murder. And then two more. Michael
is forced to flee from his home with his oldest
son (Tyler Hoechlin), and the remainder of
the film focuses on their journey together to
the town of Perdition, where Michael thinks
they can find refuge.
