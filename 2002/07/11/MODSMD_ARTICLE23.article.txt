## 'Perdition' is a road worth taking 
### RAMIN SETOODEH EDITORIAL STAFF 
Sam Mendes's "Road to Perdition" has
been marketed as a traditional tale about
gangsters. But it's not a gangster movie, not
really anyway. The story involves a boy and
his father on the run, frightened but not help
less, who try to carve new lives for themselves.
They travel together for several months in the
winter of 1931, and what they learn along the
way is achingly poignant.

At the core of the film is Tom Hanks in one
of the best performances of his career. That is
a phrase that movie critics like to use. But
Tom Hanks, who has won two Academy
Awards, is always expected to be good. What
is surprising in "Perdition" is how good he ac
tually is. Almost every scene revolves around
his character, and he is wise enough to un
derscore the role with the subtlety and depth
that it needs.
Hanks stars as Michael Sullivan, a man
who works for the mob and doesn't fulfill any
of the gangster stereotypes. His boss, John
Rooney (Paul Newman), can be vicious and
uncompromising, but acts as a father figure to
him. The two men play the piano together at

a funeral parlor in the beginning of the film, a
scene that nicely demonstrates the sense of re
liance they share.
"Sons are put on this Earth to trouble their
fathers," Rooney says. He is right. The movie
shows us that in more ways than one.
Michael has two sons and is married to a
beautiful woman referred to in the press
notes as 'Wife.' She is played by Jennifer Jason
Leigh and, as Wife, she knows something
about Husband's dealings — but not as much

as she should. There is some confusion, and
then a murder. And then two more. Michael
is forced to flee from his home with his oldest
son (Tyler Hoechlin), and the remainder of
the film focuses on their journey together to
the town of Perdition, where Michael thinks
they can find refuge.
Many of the scenes in "Road to Perdition"
are shot in the impenetrable rain, with the

streets masked in silhouettes. Other
scenes are filmed in the open coun
tryside. This is intended to demon
strate Michael's own struggle be
tween darkness and light, damna
tion and salvation. Michael hopes
that the path to Perdition can save
his son from the life that he has led.
Is he right? You decide.
The film is at times quiet and
contemplative, and at other times
very violent. But the violence in the
movie works to advance the story
line, not to interfere with it — which
is the case with so many other sum
mer movies. Hie deaths in "Road to
Perdition" are portrayed as cold
and brutal, as they should be, and
Sam Mendes has a gift for building
tension and releasing it at precisely
the right moment.
Hanks's performance oper
ates on three levels. The first two,
as a father to his own son and a
son to Rooney, look simple
enough —but they are not. The
ease at which Hanks accomplish

es them is a testament to his own
abilities as an actor.
The third level, as the hunted
man, could have turned into stan
dard melodrama. Yet the screen
play is too accomplished to let that
happen. There is a scene between
him and the man hired to assassi
nate him (Jude Law) at a diner,
where the two face each other in
opposing booths and start to talk.
They are portrayed as humane yet
animalistic, desperate yet eerily
comfortable, and the scene is han
dled so maturely that it elevates
the story line to a new strata of so
phistication.
"Road to Perdition" is the first
film directed by Sam Mendes since
"American Beauty," which won
the Academy Award. In many
ways, it is just as absorbing. The di
alogue isn't as ironic and the
themes aren't as potent, but the
story is reflective in a different way.
The cinematography looks and
feels real, the plot doesn't rely on
any gimmicks and the conclusion
is both logical and necessary.
"Road to Perdition" is a real jewel:
It knows where it wants to go, and
it isn't afraid to get there.
