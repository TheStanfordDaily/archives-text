# Dragons full of smoke, not enough 'Fire'

### PETER KAZANJY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Holy Firebreathers! Here's a
pop quiz, hotshot. You're caught
in the near future, battling fire
spitting, ash-eating, genuinely
unpleasant dragons for the fate of
all humanity. What do you do?
What do you do?
If you take a cue from Rob Bow
man's "Reign of Fire," you simply
follow the easy rules of post-apoca
lyptic, epic movie making.
Rule No. 1: The hero (Christian
Bale from "American Psycho" as
Quinn) must be a reluctant one. It is
better if his mother / sister / brother
has been killed by the object to be
fought. In this case, a big ugly drag
on. Revenge possibility? Check.

If the hero is reluctant to fight,
the viewer will be held in suspense
about whether he actually will. Sus
pense? Check.
Further, his initial reluctance
will make any success all the more
triumphant. Triumph? Check.
Likewise, if there is a female love
interest (in this case, the wild Amer
ican Alex, played by Izabella
Scorupco, whose Polish accent is
never quite explained) our hero will
be probably be reluctant to kiss her
right away. Sexual tension? Check.
Rule No. 2: The reluctant hero
must be forced to team up with
someone, and typically against his
better judgment. If suspect team
mate is American, brash, bald and
hugely buff (Matthew Mc-
Conaughey as Denton Van Zan),

the reluctant hero will be all the
more reluctant. This adds conflict.
Conflict is the basis of all drama.
Conflict? Check. Drama? Hello,
drama?
This is where it all falls apart.
Realistically, "Reign of Fire"
should have the makings of a
grand time. Ask Homer about
reluctant heroes. Odysseus is the
best. Ask J.R.R. Tolkien about

dragons. Smaug has terrified
and thrilled children for five
generations. "Reign of Fire" is
supposed to be an epic journey, a
quest to save mankind. But the
viewer never feels a sense of ur
gency behind the whole dragon
fighting enterprise.
According to the plot, dragons
burn things up and eat the ash.
After they've burned everything,
there's nothing left to eat. ITiey die.
In a cute twist of paleontology and
geology, this explains the mass ex
tinction of the dinosaurs, and the
last Ice Age (ash in the air blocks out
the sun, you get the point).
When we meet Quinn's band of
survivors, they know all this and
that the dragons are "starving" as
