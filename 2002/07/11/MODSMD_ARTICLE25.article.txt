The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys

Director Peter Care's debut release
comes off as haphazard at best.
Kieran Culkin and Emile Hirsch
give lackluster performances as Tim and
Francis, two teen-agers who have a knack
for finding trouble. The main conflict be
gins when the two draw sacrilegious
comics depicting their teacher (Jodie Fos
ter) as "Nunzilla." Along the way, Francis
falls for Margie (Jena Malone) who quickly
reveals to him that, first, her older brother
has had sex with her, and second, that she
wanted him to. The performance isn't be
lievable, even fora minute.
Ilie movie manages to pack incorpo
rate issues of suicide, incest, Catholic
school, friendship and loss of innocence
without striking any genuine chords. In
stead, these issues are touched upon only
superficially, especially in the random an
imated sequences throughout the movie
that depict the boys as superheroes.
"The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys" is
like a less accomplished version of "The
Virgin Suicides," which also wrestled with
issues of religion and troubled youth. Al
though not boring, "Altar Boys" may in
spire groans when it aims for tears.

About a Boy

Hugh Crant plays his usual charm
ing jerk, but with a bit more heart
in this film (which opened nation
wide in May and recently started playing at
the Palo Alto Square). Based on the best
selling novel by Nick Hornby, and set in
suburban London, the movie focuses on
the relationship between Will (Grant), a
rakish bachelor who discovers that single
mothers make low-maintenance dates, and
Marcus (Nicholas Moult), a lonely chap
dealing with persecution at school and a
mentally unstable mother (Toni Collette).
Will lives very comfortably off royal
ties from a Christmas tune written by his
father. Through a series of encounters
precipitated by Will's visits to single-par
ent support groups, he becomes a men
tor to Marcus, counseling him on fashion
and music. But Will finds himself in a
pickle when he falls in love with one of
the single moms and enlists Marcus' help
in trying to woo her.
The performances are excellent, partic
ularly when Grant and Hoult appear to
gether. "About a Boy" manages to remain
comical and realistic until the end, which
seems a bit too sweet to be real.

Scooby-Doo

Yipes! To a generation raised on
the animated cartoon, a live-ac
tion version of "Scooby-Doo"
might be considered pure blasphemy.
Yet somewhere between the Scooby
snacks and Shaggy's impeccable Cali
fornian stoner slur, the movie works.
Matthew Lillard carries the film as
Shaggy, perfectly portraying the man
nerisms of the cartoon character we know
so well, and more importantly, he makes
us believe that the computer-animated
Scooby is really standing alongside him.
The movie reunites the Gang on Mystery
Island, where rowdy spring breakers are
being mysteriously transformed into zom
bies. Fred (Freddie Prinze Jr.), still clad in
preppy sweater and kerchief, quotes from
his machoistic autobiography; Velma
(Linda Cardanelli) has parlayed her geek
dom into a job at NASA; and Daphne (Sarah
Michelle Gellar) is still pretty in purple.
The subtle marijuana references pro
vide ample adult humor in what can be con
sidered a film that plays to every age group
— it has irony for grownups, slapstick for
the kiddies and a burping scene that would
please anyone who has ever let one rip.

CQ

In his debut feature, writer/director
Roman Coppola (son of Francis Ford)
riffs from "8 1/2," "Barbarella" and the
French New Wave, creating an entertain
ing, if ultimately forgettable, film.
The film's hero Paul (Jeremy Davies)
works by day as the editor of a cheesy sci
fi movie "Dragonfly" and at night he films
his life in late-1960s Paris, attempting to
create a movie that's "real." As he be
comes obsessed with "Dragonfly" and its
gorgeous star Valentine (Angela Lind
vall), Paul's relationship with his girl
friend Marlene (Elodie Bouchez) begins
to disintegrate, as does the line dividing
reality and fantasy.
Coppola poses interesting (if hardly
original) questions about the tension be
tween the commercial, personal and cre
ative elements in art, but "CQ" rarely ex
amines them in any significant way.
Still, the movie is never dull. The bits that
we see of "Dragonfly" are kitschy fun, and
Coppola's real achievement is the distinc
tive, intimate look that he gives to his scenes
set in the "real world." The movie is not as
accomplished as "The Godfather," but for
the young Coppola, it's a promising start.
