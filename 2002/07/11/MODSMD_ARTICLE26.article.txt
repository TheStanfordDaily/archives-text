It's always been hard to describe the films of writer/director Wes
Anderson — they are a delicate mix of whimsy and melancholy with
unmistakable visual style. They take place in a world that
is, even at its most outrageous and fantastic, deeply personal.

Even more than with "Rushmore," the
charm of "The Roy ill Tenenbaums" is near
ly impossible to convey. It's a film that mov
ingly combines a simple story with sophisti
cated filmmaking. Hie familiar tile of famil
ial reconciliation deals with prodigal father
Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) re
turning to the family that he abandoned
decades ago. The three grown Tenenbaum
children are Chas (Ben Stiller), a financial
whiz full of rage and insecurity; Margot
(Gwyneth I'altrow), a bnxxling, secretive
adopted daughter; and Richie (Owen Wil
son), a former tennis star who secretly
yearns for Margot.

Despite a plot with a final destination that is obvious 20 minutes
into the film, "The Royal Tenenbaums" succeeds in getting under
the viewer's skin. It's subtly, unpredictably funny; the wonderful di
alogue is often sad and hilarious at the same time. The story and
characters touch upon basic themes of rejection and longing.
What distinguishes "The Royal Tenenbaums," however, is
the depth and belief that Anderson invests into his fantasy New
York. The film's locations bring to mind the off-kilter,
surreal city depicted in children's literature. Every inch of the
Tenenbaum home has been meticulously planned and lovingly de
tailed; it is a home and a family with genuine history.
Criterion's two-l)VI) set pays tribute to Anderson's creation. The
wealth of extras, from audio commentary by Anderson to pre-pro
duction sketches of each room in the Tenenbaum house, make the
viewer realize how much thought has gone into this movie. It's ex
actly the four-star treatment that Anderson's magical film deserves.
