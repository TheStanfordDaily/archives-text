# Roxy on top, a guide to a sassy bedside manner
## 
### 
Welcome back for part two of Roxy's guide to the
first hook-up. Last week, we set the stage. You don't
know each other that well. Music, lights and location
have all been decided. Now that you're actually hook
ing up, let's go over the ways to make sure that your
first time together isn't your last.
To start, even if you've already invited your guest
to spend the night, that usually doesn't result in an im
mediate trip to the bedroom (and, if it does, be careful
— she's probably trying to take advantage of your sub
stance-induced bad judgment).
So, guys, take this opportunity to show her your hot
aggressive side. Reach a hand around her shoulders
and gently pull her over. Or if you're already pros
trate from a hard night of drinking and grooving, a lit
tle creative legwork or lifting can be the perfect way to
show off both your skills and your bod.
Don't get too carried away with your acrobatic hi
jinks, though—a trip to the emergency room probably
won't increase your game much, and neither will a slap
in the face from your excessively manhandled partner.
In general, to avoid any such violence, hurt feelings
or general consternation, let your environment dic
tate the tone of your hook-up. For instance, if you guys
have been laughing all night, it's probably okay to take
a similarly silly approach to your romantic interlude.
But if you haven't said two words to each other since
Pro Fro weekend, you might want to avoid talking up
a storm in sack.
And just as it's usually best not to laugh at your part
ner without an excellent explanation that has nothing
to do with his penis or his technique, one should try to
steer clear of melodrama at all costs. Whether you're
hooking up after a foam party or a teary-eyed viewing
of "Bounce," it is never advisable— I mean, really, re
ally resist the urge - to tell her that every part of your
body cries out for her, or anything like.
As invariably happens during every hook-up, at
some point, one question must be answered: Sex?
Now, gentlemen, I know you're trying to be subtle

with your slow opening of the condom drawer or
quick rustle of the classy brown bag while flipping her
over, but while you may be good enough to take your
girl's mind off your questionable body hair or fruit
print boxers, you're almost certainly not good enough
to distract from that (and, if you are, please see Ms.
Sass's e-mail address below).
That said, it's best to just face that fateful moment
head-on. Better to tell your partner how far you're
willing to go at the start of the night than to get caught
up in the heat of the moment and find yourself mar
veling at your hook-up's comedic talents in the morn
ing — how ever did he so cleverly switch in his far less
attractive frat brother without waking you up?
Still, no matter what your angle is on the activities
of the evening, be sure not to let the talk take the steam
out of your night. End it on a good note — the hug,
the spoon, the goodnight kiss — if at all possible.
Of course, just when you think you've survived the
worst of it, you find you've been staring at the ceiling
for two hours, or maybe he woke you up with soft kiss
es on the back of your neck. Either way, it's officially
The Morning After and time to put a good face on —
literally and figuratively.
Ladies, your host will probably use the home-field
advantage to get up first and brush his teeth. While
he's gone, don't throw on your clothes and run out the
door, but do dress and take this time to minimize your
raccoon-like appearance — i.e. run a brush through
your hair and try to get rid of any leftover mascara.
Just as the location set the tone, the morning after al
lows you to send your partner signals about where you
two are heading. If he doesn't extend the breakfast in
vitation, make sure you have a story ready about lots of
work or a worried roommate (after all, you're obvious
ly not the kind of girl who often spends the night else
where). Playful jokes and any kind of in-the-light kiss
ing form the foundation fora relationship, so beware.
Whatever you do, ladies, don't
pretend it didn't happen — even if
you never want it to happen again.
Offer her some daytime clothing

and a ride home, as the walk of
shame is no fun and will likely lead
her to cast all sorts of aspersions on
your character.
After the first time, you've
shared enough time and enough
skin to know if you're interested in
sharing some more, so just buckle
down and take hold of the future.

Recognize that an encore pre
sentation brings with it expecta
tions, so don't hook up in the
morning unless you are ready to
think about tomorrow. Of course,
if you want to investigate an ex
tended run, don't be afraid to say
so; a little forthrightness never
hurt anyone.

And just as it's usually best not to laugh at your part
ner without an excellent explanation that has nothing
to do with his penis or his technique, one should try to
steer clear of melodrama at all costs. Whether you're
hooking up after a foam party or a teary-eyed viewing
of "Bounce," it is never advisable— I mean, really, re
ally resist the urge - to tell her that every part of your
body cries out for her, or anything like.
As invariably happens during every hook-up, at
some point, one question must be answered: Sex?
Now, gentlemen, I know you're trying to be subtle

with your slow opening of the condom drawer or
quick rustle of the classy brown bag while flipping her
over, but while you may be good enough to take your
girl's mind off your questionable body hair or fruit
print boxers, you're almost certainly not good enough
to distract from that (and, if you are, please see Ms.
Sass's e-mail address below).
That said, it's best to just face that fateful moment
head-on. Better to tell your partner how far you're
willing to go at the start of the night than to get caught
up in the heat of the moment and find yourself mar
veling at your hook-up's comedic talents in the morn
ing — how ever did he so cleverly switch in his far less
attractive frat brother without waking you up?
Still, no matter what your angle is on the activities
of the evening, be sure not to let the talk take the steam
out of your night. End it on a good note — the hug,
the spoon, the goodnight kiss — if at all possible.
Of course, just when you think you've survived the
worst of it, you find you've been staring at the ceiling
for two hours, or maybe he woke you up with soft kiss
es on the back of your neck. Either way, it's officially
The Morning After and time to put a good face on —
literally and figuratively.
Ladies, your host will probably use the home-field
advantage to get up first and brush his teeth. While
he's gone, don't throw on your clothes and run out the
door, but do dress and take this time to minimize your
raccoon-like appearance — i.e. run a brush through
your hair and try to get rid of any leftover mascara.
Just as the location set the tone, the morning after al
lows you to send your partner signals about where you
two are heading. If he doesn't extend the breakfast in
vitation, make sure you have a story ready about lots of
work or a worried roommate (after all, you're obvious
ly not the kind of girl who often spends the night else
where). Playful jokes and any kind of in-the-light kiss
ing form the foundation fora relationship, so beware.
Whatever you do, ladies, don't
pretend it didn't happen — even if
you never want it to happen again.
Offer her some daytime clothing

and a ride home, as the walk of
shame is no fun and will likely lead
her to cast all sorts of aspersions on
your character.
After the first time, you've
shared enough time and enough
skin to know if you're interested in
sharing some more, so just buckle
down and take hold of the future.

Recognize that an encore pre
sentation brings with it expecta
tions, so don't hook up in the
morning unless you are ready to
think about tomorrow. Of course,
if you want to investigate an ex
tended run, don't be afraid to say
so; a little forthrightness never
hurt anyone.
