# 'Eminem Show' doesn't flow
## 
### PETER KAZANJY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Eminem's, rhymes are so var
ied that it has become a hobby for
rap enthusiasts to figure out who
influences him. On his latest re
lease, " Fhe Eminem Show," he
gives a definitive list: "It goes
Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac, and Biggie,
Andre from Outkast, Jada, Ku
rupt, Nas and then me." Even
though Marshall lists himself
last, Mr. Mathers might be the
most talented and original
rhyme-sayer putting tracks on
wax since Biggie Smalls died by
the same sword he lived by.
But it is the promise of such tal
ent that makes "The Eminem
Show" such a disappointing re
lease, especially after Eminem's
original blockbuster "The Slim
Shady LP" and his brilliant follow
up, "The Marshall Mathers LP."
"Show" has its ups and downs, but
for the most part, the album fails to co
alesce as well as its predecessors. Em
inem has such a talented flow, but it
gets obscured by poor execution else
where on the tracks. Limping beats,
confused subject matter and lame
guest emcees all become more glaring.
Eminem's attempts at singing
R&B hooks in the refrains fall flat
and the occasional grotesque lyrics
for grotesque lyrics' sake turn the
listener off.
In fact, it's quite confusing why
Eminem does sing on so many tracks
(2,4,7,8,12 and 14), when he actu
ally admits, "Yo, I can't sing," on
"Hailie's Song."Oddly enough, this
song is the only track on which the
singing actually clicks, leaving a pret
ty solid piece. You can chalk up its
success to an earnestness that can't be
hidden and the raw emotion behind
the lyrics or you can attribute it to
verse three, which brings the rhymes
just as the crooning starts to fail.
Whatever it is, it works.
That isn't the only time that Em
inem's rhymes come riding to the

rescue. Track 16, "When the Music
Stops," has the makings of a com
plete and total sonic massacre but
Eminem's lyrics make the song
barely bearable.
Eminem also has to compensate
for guest rappers like D-12, who
bring the same fluffy stuff that
made their recent album a com
plete flop (that is, except the tracks
that Eminem appeared on).
Maybe it's the fact that the first
guest rapper mistakes "dillinger"
for "derringer" when rapping
about what kind of gun he likes
to shoot people with.
Or perhaps the biggest mistake
was Bizarre's confusion of Priscilla
Presley for her daughter Lisa-
Marie as Michael Jackson's, um,
real Billy-Jean. Since Eminem will
go to the depths of the dictionary
to find the perfect rhyme, listen
ing to these jokers screw up simple
current events is too painful not to

press 'skip.' It's too bad also, since
the harpsichord, piano and kick
drum come together to really
make your head nod.
Other production successes are
"My Dad's Gone Crazy," which
combines steel drums and toddler
samples, and "Sing For the Mo
ment," where Steven Tyler's
singing outclasses Eminem's vocal
stylings by light-years and shows
what good can come when an
artist sticks to what he's best at.
The stomps and claps on "Till I
Collapse" perfectly complement
the 'I will survive' feel of the track.
Despite these bright spots, and
the masterfully done "Without
Me," the album falls short of the ex
pectations. Eminem's flow is still on,
but you have to wade through quite
a bit to pull out the occasional gems.
Verdict: eßay or Half.com, be
lieve me, you can wait the week it
takes to ship.
