# BIG BROTHER 3
## 
### 
Last night's first episode of
"Big Brother 3" (CBS, 9 p.m.)
proved to be a promising start
for the series. The 12 house
guests provided the usual dose of
stupidity that prevails in the "Big
Brother" household.
The season began thrillingly
with the Tree Sitting contest,
where the houseguests were
asked to perch in straw-covered
nests for money. Instant sex ap
peal was achieved when one of

the couples, who claimed they
didn't have enough space, started
to "straddle."
The winners were Bible-tot
ing Jason (needless to say, there
was no straddling in his tree) and
Lori (a bank representative who
apparently needed some dough),
who made it more tan four hours
without a bathroom break. Their
prize? A whoping $3,000 per
week (split two ways) for as long
as they remain together in the

house. Our guess is that one of
them will be gone very soon.
The Head of Household victo
ry went to Lisa (the bartender
with big attitude). Now she has to
make the toughest decision of her
lifetime. Who to nominate for
eviction? Who to keep?
The suspense is thick enough
to cut with a water pick.
We're tempted to pick Josh as
the one to be given the boot (a
waiter from Long Island, N.Y.
who is so pathetic that he lied
about his profession), but we're ul
timately going with Marcellas (the
gay stylist who got on everyone's
nerves by projecting "bad ener
gy"). His motto for life is, "First
one on the cover of' lime' wins."
We don't know about that, but he
might get a mug shot in the enter
tainment pages when he loses.
