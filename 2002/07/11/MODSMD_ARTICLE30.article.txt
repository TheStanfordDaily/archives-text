# D.J. Shadow album is nice musical mix

There's nothing easy about making music entirely out of sam
ples. And there's nothing easy about really making good music
out of them. Nowadays, anyone with an ißook and some serious
time on his hands can make "music" out of samples, but it takes a
true master, a hip-hop ninja, a DJ monk like Josh Davis, better
known as DJ Shadow, to make the aural masterpieces found on
"The Private Press." There's something ethereal and paradisiacal
about the tracks on "Press."
Davis' debut, "Endtroducing" stormed the electronic/trip/hip
hop scene with some of the bangingest beats to come out of Cow
Town (yes, he's from Davis and, yes, his last name is Davis). There
were other good elements to the tracks, like the masterfully ma
nipulated organ on "Organ Donor" and the tidbits of funky bass
lines throughout, whose supporting roles teased out the intrica
cies of the beats.
While "Press" bears this standard forward, bringing the per
cussive prowess, the beats took a back seat to the melodies on this
album. Each piece of every song was painstakingly unearthed
from the dusty archives of modern music, dug from stacks of
records a hundred deep and hundreds wide before being perfect
ly melded with the other pieces — the products of exactly the same
process carried out a hundred times before. It takes not only the
talent of a producer, but the patience of a seer.
Shadow's vision on "Press" is nothing short of preternatural. He
appears to have now mastered the art of onomatopoetic sampling,
as "Mashin' On The Motorway" proves. '
The song produces that racecar feel — from the bass line that
sounds like the throaty acceleration of a Vl2 engine, to the honk
like single guitar chord that recurs, with the usage of actual car
noises and the oh-so appropriate surf guitar, which raises the
tempo perfectly.
The fact that guitar ends up on so many tracks, accompanied by
piano, harpsichords, strings, harmonicas, flutes and harps, fur
ther shows how the release is less the bang and boom and more the
soar and swoop. Nearly every track features at least one guitar,
and some, like the absolutely epic "You Can Never Go Home,"
boast nearly a half-dozen separate sampled axes.
Teamed with nearly as many synthesized samples, a flute and
some strings, "Home" wins the best track of the album award
hands down.
Its final track achieves something typically found only in the
realm of classical music, and is so rare among modern pop — a
true climax. Hopefully, the same is not true of Mr. Davis himself,
as it would be a crime for "Press" to mark the peak of this young
maestro's career.
Verdict: Buy one today. Buy one for your loved one tomorrow.
