# Mieville's 'Scar' tells worthy tale
## 
### ANTHONY HA STAFF WRITER 
Although China Mieville's last
two novels, "King Rat" and
"Perdido Street Station," were im
pressive books that deserved con
siderable critical acclaim, but it is
only with his latest work, "The
Scar," that he has created a fiilly
fledged masterpiece. Where the
first novels were collections of bril
liant moments that didn't quite gel
in the end, "The Scar" feels like a co
hesive whole, a brilliantly imagined,
deeply felt mix of science fiction,
horror and fantasy.
Mieville's new book shares "Per
dido" 's setting, but it's more of a
novel set in the same world than a
sequel. As the book opens, Bellis
Coldwine flees the sprawling,
Dickensian metropolis New
Crobuzon. She gains passage as a
linguist aboard a slaving ship
bound for the a faraway colony,
but before long the ship is hi
jacked, its passengers brought to
the enormous floating city of Ar
mada. Bellis soon learns that two of
the city's leaders, a bizarrely
scarred couple known as the
Lovers, have secret plans for Ar
mada involving the long chains

below from the city and the
leviathans that inhabit the ocean's
depths.
"The Scar" is a sprawling novel
tackling dozens of themes and
ideas. At one level, it is Mieville's
most successful critique yet of
Tolkien-esque fantasy. While "The
Scar" is hardly a didactic work of
social protest, Mieville's political
leanings (he's a socialist with a doc
torate in political science from the
London School of Economics) are
evident in his attack on the genre's
reactionary cliches.
He depicts violence and war
fare as nightmarish and futile,
rather than glorious and en
nobling, and his characters are
touchingly fallible rather than
noble and destined for greatness.
While most fantasy tells us that
racism is true, that all ores are evil
and all dwarfs are grumpy but lov-

able, Mieville's world is filled with
races (among them giant crus
taceans and animate cacti) as di
verse and unpredictable as hu
manity. At every turn, he resists
Tolkien's assertion that fantasy's
primary purpose is "consolation;"
he confronts us with the strange,
filthy and painful, rather than the
familiar, sanitized and comforting.
The world of "The Scar" is as em
broiled in class and race struggle
as our own, making it seem all the
more real and urgent.
Above all, "The Scar" is a grip
ping story. In many ways, it's
"Moby Dick" painted on an even
larger canvas — Mieville's "god
whale" dwarfs Melville's white
whale, and the Lovers' obsessive
ambition makes Ahab look ordi
nary in comparison. The new novel
has much of the classic work's
power, not to mention its reverent
awe for the mysteries of the sea.
And for the first time, Mieville is
able to give his tale the effective,
resonant conclusion that it needs.
"The Scar" can be difficult and
painful to read, but it is just as dif
ficult to put down. This story of
scars both literal and metaphori
cal cuts deep, but, in the end, it
also heals.
