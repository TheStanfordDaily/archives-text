## Administrators laid off at Stanford Hospital Hospital's new CEO implements restructuring to improve patient care 
### ERIN ARCHERD EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford Hospital recently restructured
its management, eliminating several posi
tions and creating others, as part of a new
strategy to streamline business operation
and improve clinical care and customer ser
vice.

The administrative re
structuring, which took ef
fect July 1, is one of the
many changes implement
ed by the hospital's new
CEO Martha Marsh. Marsh
arrived in April from the
UC-Davis Hospital in
Sacramento.
"When you have a new

CEO it's fairly standard to create a new sys
tem," said Director of Media Relations
Ruthann Richter. "This is her vision of how
the organization should be set up to reach
the mission of the hospital."
The new plan seeks to create a manage
ment structure that will improve patients'
clinical care, look for ways to improve cus
tomer service and strengthen the financial
situation of the hospital.
"The first change is that the major clinical

services will be organized into centers, each
one with a director," said Richter. "These
will be divided into clinics for cancer, cardiac
care, transplants, neural science and ortho
pedics."
Among the administrators laid off were
Karen Rago, vice president of program de
velopment, and Betsy Williams, vice presi
dent of clinical support. Their jobs have
been consolidated into the new position of
vice president of clinical services, for which a
national search is underway.
Two other administrators laid off were
Dennis Kneppel, director of patient-care
services for critical care, and Isabel Uibel, di
rector of patient-care services for medi
cine/surgical.
Two management jobs created by the re
structuring are a new vice president of
process improvement, who will be responsi
ble for streamlining systems among depart
ments and clinics, as well as a new vice pres
ident of clinical quality, who will help man
age patient care.
The hospital, with a good reputation in
clinical care, is looking to enhance its cus
tomer service. For Richter, good customer
service involves improving the way in which
the patient interacts with the system.
"Making appointments quickly, minimiz
ing wait times in the hospital, if they have fol
low-ups like a MRI — [Customer service is]
making sure everything is coordinated fora
good experience for patients," said Richter.
The hospital has been dealing with finan
cial difficulties for the past few years as the

result of a failed merger with two UC-San
Francisco hospitals that caused losses ofs 172
million for the institutions involved.
Stanford also faced a 51 -day nurses' strike
in the summer of 2000 that cost the hospital
$32 million in addition to a loss of $20 mil
lion a year in federal subsidies as part of

changes in federal support for teaching hos
pitals.
Richter emphasized that the administra
tors were not fired — their jobs were simply
no longer there.
"It wasn't a question of performance, it
was a question of function," Richter said.
