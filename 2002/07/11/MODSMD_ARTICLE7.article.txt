# New department mixes biology and engineering
## The 						Schools of Engineering and Medicine team up to create new department 
### JEFF EGER 
The newly-established Department of
Bioengineering, approved by the Board of
Trustees in June, may begin accepting
graduate students as soon as the fall quar
ter of 2003. A bachelor's of science pro
gram is on the horizon for 2005.
The Department of Bioengineering
represents a combined effort by the
School of Medicine and t he School of En
gineering. Philip Pizzo, dean of the
School of Medicine, and James Plummer,
dean of the School of Engineering, will
jointly head the new interdisciplinary de
partment.
"We're not really joining engineering
and biology'," noted Plummer. "We're
building something new which sits at the
intersection of engineering and the life sci
ences. We believe that interdisciplinary
teaching and research at this intersection

represent one of the great opportunities
for this century."
The idea for creating an independent
bioengineering department at Stanford is
hardly new.
"Engineers have worked on problems de-

riving from medical needs
for many years," Plummer
pointed out. "But in our
view these research projects
do not, by themselves, pro
vide the basis fora new dis
cipline and therefore a new
department. What has
changed is that biology has
become a quantitative sci-

ence in the past decade or so."
Other prominent universities have pre
ceded Stanford in creating degree-granting
programs in the field of bioengineering.
However, Stanford's approach should be
something special.
"Almost all major schools of engineering
either have or are building new departments
in the bioengineering field. What is unique
about the Stanford opportunity is the ability
to do this jointly between the engineering
and medical schools because of their close

physical proximity," Plum
mer added.
"It is important for uni
versities to be bold and to
reinvent themselves,
while at the same time
avoiding the temptation
to create programs that
are faddish or tempo
rary," stressed University

President John Hennessy. "As new fields
and disciplines emerge, leading universi
ties must help them develop. Stanford has
been a leader in such initiatives."
The new Bioengineering Department
will find a temporary home in the James H.
Clark Center for Biomedical Engineering
and Sciences. The Clark Center, which is
currently under construction, aims to bring
together researchers from the fields of engi
neering, medicine, biology and other sci
ences under one roof.
The department will operate within the
broader Bio-X program, but will not rely
on Bio-X to grant degrees or formulate cur
riculum. The Bioengineering Department
and its faculty will be in charge of these
tasks. And if adequate funding is secured,

the department will have its own building.
" Financial backing is always essential. The
University, through the Schools of Engi
neering and Medicine, is making a major
commitment," explained Plummer. "We ex
pect to engage government agencies to
sponsor research in the new department,
and private sources to help us build the facil
ities and programs that will be needed."
Concerning Stanford's commitment to
provide students with current and cut
ting-edge education, Hennessy re
marked: "Education is a key motivation
for creating a department, as is the cre
ation of new knowledge and understand
ing. You need both to have a depart
ment."
Brandon Stroy, a graduate of Duke Uni
versity with a B.S. in biomedical engineering
and a master's in engineering management,
was excited about the idea of pursuing a doc
torate in bioengineeringat a top-ranked uni
versity such as Stanford.
"Stanford is an attractive option lor edu
cation, period," said Stroy. "Its reputation in
these areas, especially medicine, is great, and
I'm confident their new Bioengineering De
partment will preserve this reputation."
