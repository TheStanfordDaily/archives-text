## Moving from the Superior Court to the Stanford Quad Vice provost for campus relations comments on her time at Stanford and the path that brought her back to the Farm 
### ANTHONY HA STAFF WRITER 
In March of last year, after
spending 19 years in Santa Clara
County's Municipal and Superior
Courts, LaDoris Hazzard Cordell
returned to Stanford University to
serve as vice provost and special
counselor to the president for cam
pus relations.
A 1974 graduate of Stanford
Law School, Cordell ran a private
legal practice in East Palo Alto
and, from 1978 to 1982, was assis
tant dean for student affairs at the
law school, where she played a key
role in increasing minority enroll
ment. She then became the first
African American woman to sit on
the Superior Court in Northern
California.
"I go to a lot of meetings," she
laughed when asked about her
current responsibilities at the Uni
versity.
As vice provost for campus rela
tions, she oversees the five offices
that comprise campus relations:
the Ombudsperson's Office, the
Sexual Harassment Office, the
Work Life Office, the Diversity and
Access Office and the Help Center.
Cordell explained that her role
as the special adviser to the presi
dent is less clearly defined.
"That's a role that's evolving
and is kind of one that President
Hennessy created for me. I'm a
troubleshooter, I put out fires and
come up with ideas. It allows me to
be creative and maybe take a dif
ferent approach and look at things
differently than people have in the
past."
Cordell said that the transition
from the legal system to academia
has been rough at times, particu
larly in the aforementioned meet
ings. She noted that as a judge, she
had been the final authority in
court and could blunt ly tell lawyers
when she felt that they were out of
line.
"So I come here, and I'm in a
meet ing, full of highly-placed staff,
and everybody's very
bright... but occasionally these
people say some very stupid
things," she said. "So part of me,
the judge part, wants to say,
'Would you please sit down? That
is so stupid.' You can't do that.
Here you have to say, 'Isn't that
something? I'll think about that.
Thank you for sharing that.'"
Still, Cordell pointed out that
she has accomplished a great deal
in her first year as a vice provost.
Among other things, she helped
organize an AIDS Walk in San Jose

that generated $10,000, brought
Anita Hill to speak at Stanford,
wrote a protocol on how to deal
with acts of intolerance on campus
and set up Spanish classes for
members of her staff to enable
them to interact with more of Stan
ford's workers.
Rosa E. Gonzalez, the director
of the Diversity and Access Office,
has worked closely with Cordell on
a number of projects, including the
AIDS Walk and Admit Weekend
events focusing on graduate diver
sity.
"[Cordell] has a very can-do atti
tude. Instead of asking, Why? she
asks, Why not?" Gonzalez said.
"She really lives it. It's not just an
eight-to-five job for her. She cares
deeply about it, and about issues of
justice."
In describing her past year,
Cordell said that the activities of
student labor groups — including
campaigns to stop subcontracting,
increase workers and pay a living
wage — have given her a sense of
deja vu.
"I used to be one of those stu
dents," she said. "1 appreciate stu
dents that are passionate and do
care. I think that the real problem
these days is apathy, so these things
are so important. At the same time,
now that I'm an administrator, I
can see both sides. I know that I'm
working for people of good will
who care about the conditions of
people everywhere. Otherwise, I
wouldn't be here."
Cordell has diverse interests.
Benita Jones, a friend of Cordell's

and her former bailiff, noted,
"There's a balance about her. She
combines not just the intellect, but
the creative and the artistic."
Cordell's artwork has been fea
tured in two exhibitions, and four
calendars of her legal cartoons
have been published. In both cases,

the proceeds went to support
groups such as the Support Net
work for Battered Women and the
East Palo Alto Mural Project.
"When [the cartooning] started,
I'd sit at the bench and believe it or
not, sometimes things get really
boring in court," Cordell ex
plained. "Sometimes judges sleep,
sometimes they doodle [or] they
play computer games. So I'd sit
there and I started doing little doo
dles. Then I got an idea, which
was: Why don't I use these doodles
to do something good?"
Cordell, who grew up in a black
community in Philadelphia that
serviced the old money families of
the area such as Dupont and
Heinz, leels that one of the forces
that has shaped her life is slavery.
"My great-grandmother was 12
when the Emancipation Proclama
tion was signed. Before she was
freed, she ran away twice from the
plantation, and twice she was
caught. This little kid was brought
back and severely whipped on the
back. If this little child refused to
give in to an oppressive system and
dared to do that, there's no way
that we should not be out there,
trying to do better and make life
better for others and not give in to
what we perceived to be an oppres
sive system."

She first became interested in
the law through the co-op pro
gram at Antioch College. It was
while tutoring black children in
Mississippi during the early days of
integration that she first saw
African American lawyers. She was
particularly impressed by a female
African American lawyer, who had
come to the community from the
North to help its black population
register to vote.
The real decision, however,
came when Cordell was approach
ing graduation from Antioch. A
theater major, she was wondering
how she would support herself,
when a professor suggested she
take a Business Law course.
"1 liked the thinking and the
analysis. What better thing for me?
Here I am, a theater major. I'm in
court as a litigator. I'm on stage!
I've got an audience: the jury. I
have this plot, this story to tell, and
I have to figure out how to do it.
And then I became a producer and
director, because I became a
judge."
Cordell added, "And then
there's the part of me that said,
'Make a difference. Do something
to make things better in this world.'
That's where the law for me came
in. It enables one to go into a lot of
different things."


LaDoris Cordell has an extensive background in law and a penchant for
art. The cartoons "Class Action" (above) and "High Court" (below)
appeared in her 2002 calendar, "Court Dayz." The calendar, whose pro
ceeds go to charity, contains a series of visual legal puns.

campaigns to stop subcontracting,
increase workers and pay a living
wage — have given her a sense of
deja vu.
"I used to be one of those stu
dents," she said. "1 appreciate stu
dents that are passionate and do
care. I think that the real problem
these days is apathy, so these things
are so important. At the same time,
now that I'm an administrator, I
can see both sides. I know that I'm
working for people of good will
who care about the conditions of
people everywhere. Otherwise, I
wouldn't be here."
Cordell has diverse interests.
Benita Jones, a friend of Cordell's

and her former bailiff, noted,
"There's a balance about her. She
combines not just the intellect, but
the creative and the artistic."
Cordell's artwork has been fea
tured in two exhibitions, and four
calendars of her legal cartoons
have been published. In both cases,

the proceeds went to support
groups such as the Support Net
work for Battered Women and the
East Palo Alto Mural Project.
"When [the cartooning] started,
I'd sit at the bench and believe it or
not, sometimes things get really
boring in court," Cordell ex
plained. "Sometimes judges sleep,
sometimes they doodle [or] they
play computer games. So I'd sit
there and I started doing little doo
dles. Then I got an idea, which
was: Why don't I use these doodles
to do something good?"
Cordell, who grew up in a black
community in Philadelphia that
serviced the old money families of
the area such as Dupont and
Heinz, leels that one of the forces
that has shaped her life is slavery.
"My great-grandmother was 12
when the Emancipation Proclama
tion was signed. Before she was
freed, she ran away twice from the
plantation, and twice she was
caught. This little kid was brought
back and severely whipped on the
back. If this little child refused to
give in to an oppressive system and
dared to do that, there's no way
that we should not be out there,
trying to do better and make life
better for others and not give in to
what we perceived to be an oppres
sive system."

She first became interested in
the law through the co-op pro
gram at Antioch College. It was
while tutoring black children in
Mississippi during the early days of
integration that she first saw
African American lawyers. She was
particularly impressed by a female
African American lawyer, who had
come to the community from the
North to help its black population
register to vote.
The real decision, however,
came when Cordell was approach
ing graduation from Antioch. A
theater major, she was wondering
how she would support herself,
when a professor suggested she
take a Business Law course.
"1 liked the thinking and the
analysis. What better thing for me?
Here I am, a theater major. I'm in
court as a litigator. I'm on stage!
I've got an audience: the jury. I
have this plot, this story to tell, and
I have to figure out how to do it.
And then I became a producer and
director, because I became a
judge."
Cordell added, "And then
there's the part of me that said,
'Make a difference. Do something
to make things better in this world.'
That's where the law for me came
in. It enables one to go into a lot of
different things."


LaDoris Cordell has an extensive background in law and a penchant for
art. The cartoons "Class Action" (above) and "High Court" (below)
appeared in her 2002 calendar, "Court Dayz." The calendar, whose pro
ceeds go to charity, contains a series of visual legal puns.

In March of last year, after
spending 19 years in Santa Clara
County's Municipal and Superior
Courts, LaDoris Hazzard Cordell
returned to Stanford University to
serve as vice provost and special
counselor to the president for cam
pus relations.
A 1974 graduate of Stanford
Law School, Cordell ran a private
legal practice in East Palo Alto
and, from 1978 to 1982, was assis
tant dean for student affairs at the
law school, where she played a key
role in increasing minority enroll
ment. She then became the first
African American woman to sit on
the Superior Court in Northern
California.
"I go to a lot of meetings," she
laughed when asked about her
current responsibilities at the Uni
versity.
As vice provost for campus rela
tions, she oversees the five offices
that comprise campus relations:
the Ombudsperson's Office, the
Sexual Harassment Office, the
Work Life Office, the Diversity and
Access Office and the Help Center.
Cordell explained that her role
as the special adviser to the presi
dent is less clearly defined.
"That's a role that's evolving
and is kind of one that President
Hennessy created for me. I'm a
troubleshooter, I put out fires and
come up with ideas. It allows me to
be creative and maybe take a dif
ferent approach and look at things
differently than people have in the
past."
Cordell said that the transition
from the legal system to academia
has been rough at times, particu
larly in the aforementioned meet
ings. She noted that as a judge, she
had been the final authority in
court and could blunt ly tell lawyers
when she felt that they were out of
line.
"So I come here, and I'm in a
meet ing, full of highly-placed staff,
and everybody's very
bright... but occasionally these
people say some very stupid
things," she said. "So part of me,
the judge part, wants to say,
'Would you please sit down? That
is so stupid.' You can't do that.
Here you have to say, 'Isn't that
something? I'll think about that.
Thank you for sharing that.'"
Still, Cordell pointed out that
she has accomplished a great deal
in her first year as a vice provost.
Among other things, she helped
organize an AIDS Walk in San Jose

that generated $10,000, brought
Anita Hill to speak at Stanford,
wrote a protocol on how to deal
with acts of intolerance on campus
and set up Spanish classes for
members of her staff to enable
them to interact with more of Stan
ford's workers.
Rosa E. Gonzalez, the director
of the Diversity and Access Office,
has worked closely with Cordell on
a number of projects, including the
AIDS Walk and Admit Weekend
events focusing on graduate diver
sity.
"[Cordell] has a very can-do atti
tude. Instead of asking, Why? she
asks, Why not?" Gonzalez said.
"She really lives it. It's not just an
eight-to-five job for her. She cares
deeply about it, and about issues of
justice."
In describing her past year,
Cordell said that the activities of
student labor groups — including
campaigns to stop subcontracting,
increase workers and pay a living
wage — have given her a sense of
deja vu.
