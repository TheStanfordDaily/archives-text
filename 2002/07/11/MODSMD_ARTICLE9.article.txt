# Drilling project digs deep
## 
### JERRY LU STAFF WRITER 
II may not reach all the way to
China, but it is certainly a good
start. For the last few weeks, Mark
Zoback, professor of Geophysics,
has been overseeing the tunneling
of a 1.4-mile deep research hole
near the central California town of
Parkfield.
Working alongside researchers
from the United States Geological
Survey and personnel from
around the world, Prof. Zoback
hopes that the hole drilled near the
San Andreas Fault, will provide in
formation that will test different
hypotheses about how earth
quakes function. This effort is
largely based on research expertise
accumulated during Zoback's time
teaching in the School of Earth Sci
ences.
"My research is in the mechan
ics of earthquakes and faulting —
basically, how the earth works as a
mechanical system," said Zoback.
"Right now I'm supervising the dif
ferent contractors we've brought
in for the actual drilling."
The current excavation project,
which began June 12, is meant to
serve as a pilot hole for the upcom
ing San Andreas Fault Observatory
at Depth (SAFOD) project that will
start drilling in the fall.
SAFOD, if approved, will be one
of the most elaborate ground-cor
ing endeavors of its kind. First a

1.4-mile deep hole will be drilled
into the ground just west of the
fault. Then, using techniques bor
rowed from the field of oil excava
tion, the hole will be directed diag
onally east across the fault to a
depth at which earthquakes origi
nate.
SAFOD is part of a larger un
dertaking collectively known as
Earth Scope, which is a proposed
effort to apply the newest sampling
and analytical technologies to test
theories about the physical proper
ties of the North American conti
nent.
Researchers are optimistic that
information gathered by the cur
rent dig and other SAFOD experi
ments will help predict the timing
and severity of earthquakes along
the 800-mile fault, and explain
how and why geological events
such as earthquakes and volcanic
eruptions occur.
Several graduate students in the
Geophysics Department have
made trips to the experiment site
to help conduct research and for
most of them, including fourth
year doctoral candidate Naomi
Boress, the experience has been in
teresting and rewarding.
"It's important that people from
the local area are interested in what
we're doing," said Boress. "One
goal of this project is hazard pre
diction, and it'll have a great im
pact on people in this area."
SAFOD cannot begin opera

liens until funding for Earth Scope
is approved by the Congress. How
ever, Zoback stresses that even if
SAFC )1) is not immediately funded,
there is plenty of information to
work with.
"The pilot hole is a stand-alone
experiment," said Zoback. "After
drilling we'll leave an array of seis
mometers 011 the bottom of the
borehole. They should help us pin
point the exact location of the mini
faults we're trying to study."
Parkfield, a location for earth
quake studies since 1985, is ideal
because of its location along a "slip
pery" portion of the fault, which
results in a less severe pressure
buildup and smaller, more fre
quent earthquakes.
Once the drilling is completed
to the full 7,000-foot depth, data
gathering and experimentation
will begin. Scientists will place seis
mic recording instrumentation at
various depths into the excavation,
and core samples will be drawn for
laboratory study.
For Zoback, this experiment is
the attainment of a long-anticipat
ed research goal.
"I've been working on the pro
ject for 10 years," recalls Zoback.
"The first workshop 1 conducted
was in December of 1992. Current
ly the pilot hole is at 6,000 feet, and
we expect the project to be finished
in a couple of weeks."
"It's been a long process, but a
rewarding one," he added.
