In order to maintain a high level of service at all meal periods, Bon Appetit Management Company
announced today that it is restructuring the hours of operation at several of its cafes. Baker Street/Java City will
now serve hot breakfast and will remain open from 7:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. The Cafe at Tresidder Union will now
be open from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. The Coffee House and GSB will implement simi
lar changes in the near future. The changes will result in reorganization of staff. This will be done in full accor
dance with the collective bargaining agreement.
Like many businesses across the country, Bon Appetit has experienced a decline in business during the cur
rent economic downturn. Cafe and conference sales have been especially hard hit. In addition, the relocation of
several key campus offices has decreased foot traffic at Tresidder. "We hope the upcoming changes will allow us to
stay economically viable while still offering great food and great service to our guests," said Marvin Rodriguez, Bon
Appetit General Manager.
