## DISPATCHES FROM THE OUTER DARKNESS American dreaming 
### MARK GANEK STAFF COLUMNIST 
Draw near, my little embryos,
for the ancient one has a few choice
words to impart. There is old say
ing where I come from: "With age
comes wisdom. Or not." How true
that is. 1 definitely have the age
part down, since it took me six
years to graduate, but the wisdom
part is a lit lie shaky.
My undergraduate career
managed to swell from a slim
novella into a mammoth quest
epic similar to "Pilgrim's
Progress," only with less sex. But
my store of wisdom seemed to
dwindle as I went along. And now,
like Socrates, 1 am left only with
the knowledge that 1 know noth
ing. Also like Socrates, 1 tend to
drink things that aren't good for
me, which helps alleviate the pain
associated with the knowledge.
I now find myself in the strange
land of the recently graduated. And
as I gaze from the Precipice of
Achievement back on the Glisten
ing Slope of Academic Study, sadly
unaccompanied by the Sherpas of
Dignity, I realize that 1 have forgot
ten to turn off the Curling Iron of
Chaos in the Bathroom of Stability.
Quite frankly, the life of a recent
graduate is a barren wasteland.
The mind is a churning cauldron
of ambition, idealism and hor
mones, and no one seems to be of
fering cash on the hogshead for
being quirky. One's knee-jerk re

action is to run headlong for the
American Dream, that shimmer
ing, indistinct vision in the dis
tance. Hut even this has its perils.
The American Dream has long
been a topic of debate. It has been
declared everything from "alive
and well" to "sick and dying" to
"presumably working at a gas sta
tion in the Yukon with Elvis." And
at the risk of shedding my Socratic
mantle, I know something about it
because 1 actually saw it once. As
luck would have it, the Dream was
residing in a tiny principality on
the Mediterranean known as
Monaco.
My discovery was completely ac
cidental, as I only happened to be
in Monaco for the World Push
Championships with the U.S. bob
sled team. I'm going to omit the
tale of how I found myself in this
situation, since the story is less than
glamorous. In fact, it is somewhat
reminiscent of the way monkeys
end up on the Space Shuttle.
At first, Monaco seemed a lot
like paradise. People were uni
formly wealthy. Ridiculously, ob
scenely wealthy. The kind of
wealthy where you hire people to
spit on your servants for you. The
city was clean, and everyone there
seemed happy. Giddy. Ecstatic.
But then, gradually, the dark un
derbelly began to emerge.
After the competition, the
prince of Monaco threw a party for
us, apparently because he was
bored. The night quickly turned a

sinister shade of weird. He had or
ganized a cabaret show for ns,
which, due to a futuristic theme,
featured topless women with gi
gantic prosthetic brains, an image
which has haunted my nightmares
ever since.
After dinner, the prince took us
all to a bar that featured beer cost
ing $40 per bottle and an indoor
grotto. Mesmerized, I stared at the
dance floor, which seemed to be
the center of some bizarre ritual. It
was populated almost exclusively
by young, beautiful women of su
permodel quality. Meanwhile, a
circling pack of immaculately
dressed middle-aged men, with
necks spilling over their collars and
shoes costing more than Stealth
Bombers, patrolled the outer rim

like sharks circling a school offish.
Every so often one of the men,
invariably sporting a wedding ring
tan and no wedding ring, would
dart in and whisper something in
the ear of one of the women, and
they would immediately leave to
gether. And as 1 watched these un
blinking predators prowling
around the dance floor, I realized
that these fat-necked sharks were
living the American Dream.
It was not the obsolete, picket
fence-and-golden-retriever ver
sion of the Dream that gets trotted
out for special occasions like a prize
heifer at a county fair. It was the
updated version. It was the hedo
nistic frenzy I'd been brought up to
seek, conditioned by countless TV
commercials, music videos and

movies. Here was the shining city
on a hill.
It was a shock at the time, but
after returning to America, 1 see
that the Dream lives on. I've seen
friends of mine chasing this
Dream. But the Dream is fickle. So
if it leaves you one night at 3 a.m.
and you end up staring into the
bathroom mirror at your aging
face and the blasted wreckage of
wasted years behind you, don't say
I didn't warn you. I looked into the
dead eyes of the fat-necked sharks.
And I know.
