# LETTER TO THE EDITOR

### 
Rob Gaudet's letter regarding
Joseph Lemon's July 5 piece
("Pledge ruling really a fair inter
pretation of the law") is a case in
point of why the Constitution in
cludes language such as the Estab
lishment Clause.
Christians like Gaudet seem un
able to conceive of non-believers
who are offended that their own
government is shoving religion
down their throats.
As an atheist, I find the refer
ences to God in the Pledge of Alle
giance, the courts, and on U.S. cur
rency to be nothing short of ap
palling. In fact, 1 refuse to recite
the Pledge of Allegiance because it
is offensive to me. I would just as
soon pledge my allegiance to "one
nation under Martha Stewart."
Gaudet cries that the court's de

cision "violates the fundamental
values of the people they serve."
The only fundamental value 1
know of that the decision violates is
one of narrow-mindedness and in
tolerance for the religious beliefs of
others. Even if 95 percent of Amer
icans believed in God, as Gaudet
claims, they would have absolutely
no right to impose that belief on
the other 5 percent of us.
A primary reason for the exis
tence of the Bill of Rights is to pro
tect the minority from the tyranny
of the majority. As John Stuart Mill
wrote in "On Liberty:" "There is a
limit to the legitimate interference
of collective opinion with individ
ual independence; and to find that
limit, and maintain it against en
croachment, is as indispensable to
a good condition of human affairs

as protection against political
despotism."
It is unfortunate that many of
these references to God have be
come so ingrained into our gov
ernment that a court will contra
dict the Constitution to protect
them.
Nevertheless, references to
God have no place in the busi
ness of a government that sup
posedly respects the beliefs of all
of its citizens.
Judge Alfred Goodwin knew
that his decision would inspire a
massive backlash of bigotry under
the thin veil of "patriotism." To
issue the correct ruling in spite of
that makes his act all the braver.
