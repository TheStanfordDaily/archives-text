## Martha Stewart 'Living': bedsheets and back deals 
### JOE LEMON STAFF COLUMNIST 
As Yogi Berra told us, "It's like
deja vu all over again." There is a
Bush in the White House; the
United States is fighting a war in
the Middle East; young black men
are getting beaten up by cops in
Los Angeles and the economy is in
the toilet. Can somebody wake me
when it's no longer 1992? The '90s
did happen, right? There was such
a thing as the Internet, wasn't
there? I'm pretty sure I've got

some 112 ree T-shirts and mouse pads
that can prove that.
Today, as Titanics like Enron
and World Com are sinking amid
accusations of widespread fraud
and misrepresentation, George W.
Bush — the first U.S. President to
hold an M.B.A — and his col
leagues in Congress are grasping
for ways to buoy the drowning S.S.
Dow Jones. And, the cast of char
acters caught up in this financial
maelstrom would make for pretty
good big-screen entertainment if
their misdeeds weren't costing
American shareholders trillions of
dollars in lost value.
Clearly, the most intriguing
player in the script thus far is
Martha Stewart. The woman who
has built a financial empire by sim
ply being a more perfect person
than the rest of us tragically Hawed
mortals seems to have made her
first known faux pas. And we're
not talking about using the wrong
little spoon to slurp chilled melon
soup. No, Martha Stewart is being
investigated for insider trading,
which doesn't just mean getting
into the Farmer's Market an hour
before it opens.
Rather, Stewart managed to
unload 4,000 shares of ImClone
stock on Dec. 27 of last year — one
day before it was publicly revealed
that the Food and Drug Adminis
tration would not be considering
an application for the company's
key cancer-fighting drugs. Coinci
dence? Of course not. That's what
insider trading is. You see, her

buddy, Sam Waksal, ImClone's
CEO, has been arrested by the FBI
and charged with tipping off
friends and family.
Stewart's suspiciously uncanny
timing resulted in a savings of
$40,000 to $57,000 on the transac
tion. While that buys a lot of sloppy
joes for regular folks like you and
me, that sum hardly makes a dent
in her monthly pate budget. In
deed, a friend of mine suggested
that because 50 grand is such
chump change to her, she would
not have engaged in the risky busi
ness of insider trading to save such
a nominal amount.
But that perspective ignores
Stewart's obsessive-compulsive
pathology, which is both a sick
ness and the key to her success.
Only she would see a beautifully
prepared banquet table and no
tice that the ivory-colored napkin
rings clash with the bone-colored
tablecloths. This would annoy her
so much that she'd probably fash
ion the napkins into a noose
rather than suffer the indignity of
throwing an imperfect gala.
Everything has to be perfect, in
cluding the timing of her stock
trades, apparently.
Securities laws are in place to

protect the public from these
deals. Regardless of whether Stew
art is subjected to criminal liability,
Wall Street has already been ex
acting its punishment. In the
month of June, her Martha Stew
art Omnimedia company shares
lost close to half of their value,
slashing about $200 million from
her personal net worth. It's amaz
ing: The free market system has
sentenced her with a fine that
would violate the Eighth Amend
ment's prohibition against cruel
and unusual punishment.
Don't get me wrong. It's not
that I relish in Stewart's misfor
tune. It's just that maybe now I can
look at myself in the mirror with a
little less shame for not making my
bed with hospital corners every
morning. At least I haven't de
frauded the public and been
soaked in the capital markets to the
tune of 200 million big ones.
