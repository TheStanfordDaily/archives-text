# WORLD VIEWPOINT
## Living as a Parisian 
### QI ZHAI GUEST COLUMNIST 
Now I hat the initial frenzy of ar
riving and trying to blend in with
the Parisian cityscape is over (see
the July 11 column, "Seven steps to
becoming French"), it's time to
think about diving deeper into all
aspects of French life. Be it food,
work or travel, take time to discov
er the French way of life. I would
like to offer a few more humble
and practical tips on making the
most of your time in France.
Shopping for groceries
• After you've settled into your
cozy apartment (where all appli
ances and furniture are a quite a
few sizes smaller than their sturdy
American counterparts), make
friends with the boulangers (bread
makers), boucliers (butchers) and
other specialist vendors in your
neighborhood. Visiting these little
shops regularly is a convenient and
interesting way to stock up on gro
ceries. It's far superior to a one
stop-gets-all run to the Safeway
like supermarkets.
• Go to a fromagerie and explore
cheeses made of hit cru. Cheeses
made from unpasteurized milk
cannot be imported to the United
States. Developing a love for spe
cialty cheeses will endear you in
the hearts of the French and bump
your connoisseurship up from
Cheeze Whiz class.
• As for baguettes, buy one every
day and walk home with it tucked
under your arm. Fresh bread on a
daily basis is a healthy and easy way
to supply yourself with enough
carbohydrates to fuel your busy
Parisian life.
• Invest in a rolling punier. This
shopping basket on wheels will
allow you to tote your daily gro
ceries in true Parisian style. Be sure
to select one with good wheels that
can withstand the tumble of cob
blestone streets.
Working and living
• If you are working in France,
ditch your American work ethic
and go on strike when the rest of
your colleagues inevitably do. Just
remember to complain bitterly

when other people, such as the
metro workers and museum work
ers, go on strike.
• Be frugal. Paris is an expensive
city, which is why residents have
learned to avoid the tourist-trap
areas in order to get by. This lets
the foreigners feed the French
economy.
Excursions
• The sun sets late in the summer,
around 9:30 p.m. This gives you
ample time to pick up your Paris
map and hit any random quartier
fora promemide after work. There
are so many wonders that I guar
antee you'll walk into something
interesting, regardless of which
metro station you exit from.
• On Sundays when all Parisian
stores are closed, pack a book and
some sunblock, and head for the
Jardin des Tuileries. This magnifi
cent stretch of greens and statues
leading up to the Louvre is a pop
ular relaxation spot. Get there
early so you can secure one of the
lounge chairs or a nice patch of
grassy lawn to lie on.
• Buy a French guidebook like
"Guide de Routards." They're a
great resource for planning
weekend trips outside of Paris.
Traveling by train is an efficient
and inexpensive way to discover
all of France.
• If you're ever here around
Bastille Day (July 14, France's na
tional holiday) take full part in all
the festivities. La Place de la
Bastille hosts outdoor concerts on
the night of the July 13. The next
day, get up early to watch the tra
ditional military parade on the
Champs-Elysees.
Then, at night, join tens of
thousands of French people and
tourists at the foot of the Eiffel
Tower fora fireworks show. Final
ly, bring a good supply of two-euro
coins so you can buy beer from
vendors carrying iced buckets.
