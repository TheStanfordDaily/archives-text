# Eldridge says 'I do' to Cardinal volleyball program
## 
### EZRA CALLAHAN STAFF WRITER 
Something old, something new, some
thing borrowed and something blue.
Subscribers to old adages everywhere will
tell you that no bridal ensemble is complete
without all four. For soon-to-be-bride Katy
Eldridge, who is getting married this week
end, the something new came a little early
and in a somewhat unexpected form: she got
a new job.
Last week, Eldridge was hired as an assis
tant coach for the Stanford women's volley
ball team.
In taking the position, Eldridge took care of
the something old too —well, sort of. Eldridge
will reunite with her old head coach from her
days at Pacific, John Dunning, who heads into
his second year at the helm of the Cardinal.
The only things blue are a bunch of faces
down at Santa Clara University, where the
Broncos volleyball squad is left without their
top assistant coach from last year.
"It's been a whirlwind the last few days,"
Eldridge said. "A good one. But it was a whirl-

wind closing out my job at
Santa Clara and starting the
one here. And then with get
ting married, there's so
much going on. I definitely
have a full plate right now."
It would be nice to say
that things will slow down a
bit for Eldridge once the last
piece of wedding cake is fin-

ished. But with Stanford's annual summer
volleyball camps currently in full swing and
the Cardinal volleyball team's first match just
live weeks away, it may be awhile before
there's time for all those thank-you notes. Es
pecially with the defending national champi
on Cardinal in solid position to repeat its
NCAA title run from last year.
Volleyball Magazine put Stanford at the
top of its preseason rankings last week, indi
cating that many think the Cardinal will still be
playing as late as Dec. 21 when the next NCAA
champion will lx' decided in New ()rleans.
It's expectations like those that will likely
require the biggest adjustment for Eldridge
in making the 20-mile move from Santa Clara

to Stanford — a move about 100 times as long
in terms of volleyball. Making just their sixth
postseason appearance last season, the Bron
cos barely have more NCAA tournament
berths than the Cardinal has national titles.
Filing seasons at Stanford in the disap
pointment bin if they don't result in another
championship banner hanging in Maples
Pavilion might take some getting used to for
Eldridge, who guided Pacific to the NCAA fi
nals during her sophomore year in 1990
under Dunning.
"Santa Clara is climbing. They have a
young, athletic team, and they should be in
the toj) 25 next year," she said. "It's different
from here [at Stanford]. There's an estab
lished tradition of winning here that they are
trying to build there."
Eldridge may also face some daunting ex
pectations on a personal level as she fills the
coaching vacancy left by former Stanford
standout Kim Oden.
Oden, named AVCA National Player of the
Year at Stanford in 1984 and 1985, left the Uni
versity last month to become a guidance coun
selor at Saint Francis High School in Mountain

View. Returning to the Farm as a coach in 2000,
the all-time leader in blocks at Stanford guided
the Cardinal to the top of the Pacific-10 Confer
ence in blocking both seasons she was here.
It would be a stressful honeymoon at
Stanford for Eldridge if she were expected
to fill Oden's shoes — though, to be sure,
she is largely qualified to do so with four
years of coaching experience and nine years
of professional play under her belt. More
likely, a reassigning of responsibilities
among Eldridge, Dunning and associate
head coach Denise Corlett will take place
over the next couple of weeks.
"When you hire someone new, it's a peri
od of mixed feelings," said Dunning, who
coached Eldridge at Pacific from 1989 to
1992.
"We're partially sad because Kim is leav
ing. We're happy for Kim because she is real
ly excited about her new job and she's going
to make a great counselor."
"Katy doesn't have to replace Kim, and
Katy isn't coming in to do Kim's job. She has


Katy Eldridge
lots of different volleyball experi
ence, and she's going to bring in lots
of new ideas. Once summer camps
are over, we're going to sit down and
redraw everyone's job descriptions."
Eldridge was a four-time All-Big
West Conference selection at Pacif
ic, where she is currently fifth on the
career digs list. She was Pacific's
MVP in 1992, and is enshrined in
the I 'iger Hall of Fame.
The chance to be reunited with
Dunning, albeit at Stanford and not
in Stockton, was one of the biggest
draws to the coaching job.
"We've kept a friendship for the
past 10 years, but it's nice to be to
gether in a different role as col
leagues," Eldridge said of Dunning.

"I think there's a lot I can learn
from him. He's been in the coach
ing profession for 30 years."
Eldridge will also be there to
provide moral support to Dunning
when he makes his first official t rip
to Pacific, where he coached for 16
years before coming to Stanford last
year, for the Cardinal's Oct. 22 face
off with the Tigers in Stockton.
Eldridge will get a close-up look
at her old Santa Clara squad on
Nov. 26 in Stanford's regular-sea
son finale.
Of course, all of that is a good
four months away.
But don't assume that Eldridge
won't be thinking about volleyball
heading into this weekend's wed
ding festivities — this wedding is
likely to have a volleyball feel to it.
Her husband-to-be, Joe Riggs, is
a volleyball coach at Los Gatos High
School.
