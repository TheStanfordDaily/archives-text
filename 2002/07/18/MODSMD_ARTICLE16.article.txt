# World's ultimate sportsmen compete at Pentathlon
## Pentathlon tradition unfolds for spectators and athletes alike on Stanford campus 
### DANIEL URBAN STAFF WRITER 
In addition to being one of the top col
legiate athletic facilities in the world, Stan
ford has put itself on the map as a venue for
professional, Olympic-caliber competition.
Having just held the United States
Track and Field Championships last
month, Stanford is currently hosting the
2002 Modern Pentathlon World Champi
onships from July 15 to July 21.
The event features 256 athletes from 46

nations, and is co-hosted by the United
States Modern Pentathlon Association and
the Bay Area Sports Organizing Commit
tee, the group working to bring the
Olympic Games to the San Francisco Bay
Area in 2002.
The pentathlon is a modern rendition
of an ancient tradition. The ancient Greeks
esteemed the winner of the pentathlon, the
man who proved his mettle in running,
discus throwing, wrestling, archery and
spear throwing, as the greatest athlete of
the Olympic Games.
Nowadays, the event consists of run
ning, pistol shooting, fencing, equestrian
jumping and swimming, and is a competi
tion for both men and women.
The choice of events may seem random,
but like the marathon and the Iditarod

dogsled race, it has a heroic story as its in
spiration.
Allegedly, an officer in Napoleon's army
had a critical message to deliver and had to
ride through enemy territory and shoot
down enemy soldiers from his horse. Out
of ammunition, he 112 aced and defeated op
ponents with his saber. Upon reaching a
river his horse could not ford, the mes
sanger swam to the other side, and then
ran the rest of the way to deliver the mes
sage.
Athletes in this week's competition
must complete an equestrian jumping
circuit on an unfamiliar horse (the
French officer's horse was not his own),
fire shots from a standing position at a
target 10 meters away, run a 3,000-meter
cross country course, swim a 200-meter

freestyle and fence against every other
competitor.
For obvious reasons, the shooting from
horseback has been divided into two separate
events for the modern-day competition.
A predetermined system converts per
formances in the live events into points,
and the athlete with the highest cumulative
point total claims the gold medal.
While the modern pentathlon may be a
bit tamer than the officer's epic experience,
it is nonetheless extremely demanding.
Combining all five events into one day cre
ates a grueling test of brute strength and
stamina as well as precision and control.
By hosting the event, Stanford will pro
vides spectators with the rare opportunity
to witness the international search for the
ultimate all-around sportsman.
