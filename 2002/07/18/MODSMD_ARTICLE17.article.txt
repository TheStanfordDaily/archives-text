# Copa mundial de beísbol: reviving a pastime

### CHUCK ARMSTRONG GUEST COLUMNIST 
If you happen to be one of the
millions of people in America who
watch, attend, listen or in any way
follow the current events of Major
League Baseball, then you are
aware of the apparent strife the
league is going through.
Players wanting more money,
owners saying they're not getting
enough money, ticket sales declin
ing, the looming contraction of the
Twins and the Expos and, proba
bly the most shocking to the aver
age fan, the recent suspicions of
anabolic steroid use by many of
baseball's biggest stars.
And that was all before the heat
ed arguments about the All-Star
Game.
With all of this tension mounting
in the baseball community, the
amount of criticism coming from
fans and reporters is understand
able, if perhaps a bit extreme.
Sportswriters go out of their way to
call baseball the "ex-pastime" and

are incessantly implying that the
sport is, if not dead, on the brink of
committing complete hara-kiri.
Well, that needs to stop.
All over the world, in places
where just recently baseball was as
foreign to the locals as cricket is to
the average American, the great
American pastime is becoming in
creasingly popular.
There are professional leagues
in the Netherlands, Italy, Australia
and China, just to name a few.
There are semi-professional
leagues in South Africa, Spain, the
United Kingdom, Russia, France,
Germany and the Czech Republic.
And let's not forget Central and
South America, where baseball is
practically a religion.
I needn't even mention Japan.
In the past 10 years, baseball
has exploded in countries on all
continents (barring Antarctica,
because really, that's just silly). In
that time, the quality of play has
improved dramatically, with the
best teams in countries like the
Netherlands and Italy playing

better ball than most of America's
Division I college teams.
Here's a little trivia question for
all you international baseball buffs:
Who was the first team to beat
Cuba at baseball in the Olympics?
Not the U.S., that's for sure. It was
the Netherlands in a 4-2 victory
during the 2000 Summer
Olympics in Sydney.
Of course, our professional play
ers don't play in the Olympics, our
best collegiate athletes do, but of all
the teams to knock off the Cubans,
we'd have hoped it would have
been us, or at least the Canadians.
But that wasn't the case and the
best players from a country where
the name of the game translates to
"honkball" were able to do what no
group of American college players
(or anyone else for that matter) has
ever done.
And you're telling me that base
ball's dead?
Well if it is, then we're strik
ing out.
We are finally on the verge of t he
possible actualization of what is sure

to be one of the coolest spectacles in
the history ofbaseball and indeed the
entire world of sports: the real World
Series. Now you're probably think
ing that in this World Cup of base
ball, the United States would just
dominate in the way our basketball
team has come to do in the Olympics
— that we'd pick an All-Star team
from both leagues and become un
stoppable right?
Not quite.
Similar to the World Cup of
soccer, players would play for
their respective home countries.
Imagine the Japanese team
with Ichiro, Hideo Nomo and
Kazuhiro Sasaki. The Dominican
team with Pedro Martinez and
Sammy Sosa.
Plus we'd get to see the best and
brightest from every other coun
try's various leagues. And you
know something? The series really
wouldn't be that one-sided. Sure
the USA would be the favorite with
the likes of Randy Johnson, Barry
Bonds, Jason Giambi and (if he
ever gets healthy) Ken GrifFev I r.

but many other countries would
certainly prove to be worthy foes.
Granted, it will be a while be
fore the series actually takes place
(though the plans are being laid
even as you read this) and present
ly, most of the world doesn't play
at the same level as the U.S., but
over the next several years, the
baseball gap between us and the
world will surely become smaller.
So is baseball dead or even on
its way out?
Hardly.
Perhaps the business side of base
ball has some issues it needs to work
through, but I think it will take a lot
more than labor strife to ultimately
kill America's true pastime.
And if the front offices of base
ball can't work things out? Well, 1
don't know about you, but I'd hate
to see us lose to a bunch of guys that
call our sport "honkball."

best teams in countries like the
Netherlands and Italy playing

better ball than most of America's
Division I college teams.
Here's a little trivia question for
all you international baseball buffs:
Who was the first team to beat
Cuba at baseball in the Olympics?
Not the U.S., that's for sure. It was
the Netherlands in a 4-2 victory
during the 2000 Summer
Olympics in Sydney.
Of course, our professional play
ers don't play in the Olympics, our
best collegiate athletes do, but of all
the teams to knock off the Cubans,
we'd have hoped it would have
been us, or at least the Canadians.
But that wasn't the case and the
best players from a country where
the name of the game translates to
"honkball" were able to do what no
group of American college players
(or anyone else for that matter) has
ever done.
And you're telling me that base
ball's dead?
Well if it is, then we're strik
ing out.
We are finally on the verge of t he
possible actualization of what is sure

to be one of the coolest spectacles in
the history ofbaseball and indeed the
entire world of sports: the real World
Series. Now you're probably think
ing that in this World Cup of base
ball, the United States would just
dominate in the way our basketball
team has come to do in the Olympics
— that we'd pick an All-Star team
from both leagues and become un
stoppable right?
Not quite.
Similar to the World Cup of
soccer, players would play for
their respective home countries.
Imagine the Japanese team
with Ichiro, Hideo Nomo and
Kazuhiro Sasaki. The Dominican
team with Pedro Martinez and
Sammy Sosa.
Plus we'd get to see the best and
brightest from every other coun
try's various leagues. And you
know something? The series really
wouldn't be that one-sided. Sure
the USA would be the favorite with
the likes of Randy Johnson, Barry
Bonds, Jason Giambi and (if he
ever gets healthy) Ken GrifFev I r.

but many other countries would
certainly prove to be worthy foes.
Granted, it will be a while be
fore the series actually takes place
(though the plans are being laid
even as you read this) and present
ly, most of the world doesn't play
at the same level as the U.S., but
over the next several years, the
baseball gap between us and the
world will surely become smaller.
So is baseball dead or even on
its way out?
Hardly.
Perhaps the business side of base
ball has some issues it needs to work
through, but I think it will take a lot
more than labor strife to ultimately
kill America's true pastime.
And if the front offices of base
ball can't work things out? Well, 1
don't know about you, but I'd hate
to see us lose to a bunch of guys that
call our sport "honkball."
