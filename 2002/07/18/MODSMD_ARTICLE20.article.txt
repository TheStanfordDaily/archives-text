## 'Widowmaker,' a sub-par sub movie 
### ANTHONY HA STAFF WRITER 
Well, it's not as bad as it sounds.
"K-19: The Widowmaker" is crippled by a
terrible title, but it still manages to be sporadi
cally entertaining and even, on occasion, quite
moving.
The film, directed by Kathryn Bigelow
("Strange Days") from a script based on a true
story by Christopher Kyle, is set in 1961.

moved from his post for not preparing the ves
sel quickly enough for its test run. Demoted to
executive officer, he is replaced by Alexei
Vostrikov (1 farrison Ford), a hard-driving cap

The submarine leaves port on schedule and
successfully fires a test missile, but then its nu
clear reactor springs a leak near a NA TO base.
A core meltdown could cause the warheads on
K-19 to detonate, which would lead to World
War 111.
The story brims with heroism and tragedy,
but the movie makes so many mistakes in telling
this tale that its inherent dramatic power only
shines through from time to time.

The Russian characters all speak English,

More harmfully, the film wastes its entire
first hour documenting one boring drill after
another. Within the first 10 minutes, the script
establishes Vostrikov as a gruff officer in con
trast to the compassionate Polenin, but that's it
for character development. There are a few
memorable moments: K-19 sitting at dry-dock
like a beached whale, a (XJI shot from the ship's

interior through its thin hull and a game of soc
cer between the crew, played on the ice that the
sub has just recently broken. But they're far out
numbered by monotonous shots of men run
ning through the sub's claustrophobic tunnels.
And worse still is the truly execrable score by
Klaus Badelt, one that brings to mind John
Williams, but without the talent. Badelt insists
on turning the volume up on every single emo-
