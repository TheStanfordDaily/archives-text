# Eight is not enough, 'Freaks' never gets it on

In a strange twist of marketing,
"Eight Legged Freaks" is promot
ed as a movie from the same pro
ducers of "Godzilla" and "Inde
pendence Day." Riding the coal
tails of "11)4," 1 can understand.
But "Godzilla"? That's like saying,

While "Eight Legged Freaks"
(please ignore the murder of our
language, proper hyphenation is
clearly out) is not a total triumph, it
easily outclasses its larger, dumber
brothers and has some fun in the
process. What else would you ex
pect from a movie populated with
cow-sized spiders and a big-rig
dwarfing tarantula?
The movie shares some traits
with "Godzilla," but they're mostly
positive. As in, it has wonderful
creature effects. "Arachnophobia"
was creepy without this kind of
computer work, but these newfan
gled spiders are just plain cool.
Unfortunately, though, "Eight

LIGHTS OUT: "Eight Legged Freaks" stars David Arquette as an engineer
in a small town where spiders mutate into gigantic beasts.
Ix-gged Freaks" relies on the spi
ders too often and pursues the
dangerous path that many big
budget productions have fol
lowed: something for everyone.
The hero in this case is the nerd
ed-out son of the local sherifi (the
local, hot sherifi that is). I lis inter
actions with the spiders seem little
more than opportunities to slum -
case his palm pilot, which constant
h whirs and clicks and lakes live
video, as well as his propensity to
spit out the names of animal
species in Latin. We get it already,
smart and young is cool. Can we
please move on?
This of course, is for the

munchkins in the theater. For the
teenies, we have spiders, spider
mayhem (there are more actual
deaths depicted in this movie than
in "Saving Private Ryan" — I dare
you to count), dirt bikes, making
out and more mayhem. Anything
that resembles MTV, such as the
five-minute-long music video
esque dirt bike chase scene, is
aimed at this target market.
Obviously we need something
for the parents that drove the two
previous groups to the theater.
Enter the prodigal son, Chris Mc-
Cormack (David Arquette), who
has returned home to his long
pined-after love, Sheriff Sam Park
er (Kari Wuhrer). Will he get to
gether with her? Will he not? Will
the spiders eat them both and make
it all stop!
Spider bites are painful, bu not

as painful as Arquette doing Romeo.
He's much, much better doing what
he does best — making his 'scared
to death' face and running from spi
ders, which he also does quite a bit.
Capitalizing on your strong suit is
rarely a bad thing.
A perfect example of this is the
short and sweet performance
turned in by Rick Overton in the
role of bumbling Deputy Pete. 11
only the rest of the cast members
had his timing in delivering their
lines, the movie would have fared
much better. Perhaps it's because
Overton is a stand-up comedian.
If you're willing to sit through
some mediocrity and audience
pandering in order to gel the occa
sional flashes of comic success, I
recommend the film. Don't expect
brilliance; just expect to laugh,
both with it and at it.
