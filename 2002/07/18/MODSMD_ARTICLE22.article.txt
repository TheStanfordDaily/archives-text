Mr. Deeds
To put things politely, the latest com
edy starring Adam Sandler is an
embarrassing remake of a 1936
Frank Capra movie.
Sandler plays the movie's title charac
ter, who does not call himself "mister." In
fact, Deeds is a small town guy with a pizza
parlor whose life is disturbed when two
suits arrive from the big city. They inform
him that his uncle has died and left Deeds,
his closest living relative, a company worth
$40 billion.
Many of the scenes in "Mr. Deeds" aim
at the lowest denominator of comedy. San
dler has never been the pillar of good taste,
but he does a poor job balancing the
humor with a slilted romance between
him and an investigative reporter (Winona
Ryder).
There'snoquestion"Mr. Deeds" would
have been much better without any at
tempt at drama or serious investment in
plot. Director Steven Brill asks too much
from his audience when the violins swell
and we are magically supposed to produce
a semblance of empathy for his shallow
characters. Instead, he should have fo
cused on creating more funny moments,
as the groans outweigh the laughs.

Men in Black II
irtcCrti
The intergalactic batde between good
and evil just got a lot duller with this
limp sequel to the 1997 summer
blockbuster directed by Barry Sonnenfield.
Sonnenfield has recollected some of
the key elements that made the original
movie a success, including a screenplay
that swerves between a farce and an
extra-terrestrial thriller. But the result is
remarkably hollow, a gallery of comput
er-animated images with no cohesive
framework to keep the story together.
It is clear from the opening action se
quence, an exaggerated exercise that is
more disconnected than disappointing,
that "Men in Black II" does not have its
heart in the material. The movie is
structured around shoot outs, alien
bouts and ultimately, an ending that is
pure cop out.
Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, who
were never as viable as action heroes as
they were spokesmen for Ray-Ban sun
glasses, seem eerily uncomfortable in their
scenes together. And perhaps for good
reason. In the five years since the first film,
their two characters seem to have under
gone complete role reversals.
It's enough to give a viewer whiplash.

Road to Perdition
★★★★
Sam Mendes's first film since
"American Beauty" has been mar
keted as a traditional tale about
gangsters. But it's not a gangster movie,
not really anyway.
At the core of the film is Tom Hanks
in one of the best performances of his ca
reer. That is a phrase that movie clitics
like to use often. But Tom Hanks, who
has won two Academy Awards, is always
expected to be good. What is surprising
in "Perdition" is how good he actually is.
Hanks stars as Michael Sullivan, a man
who works for the mob. His boss, John
Rooney (Paul Newman), can be vicious and
uncompromising, but acts as a father figure
to him. There is a murder. Then two more
and Michael is forced to llee with his son
(Tyler Hoechlin) to the town of Perdition,
where he believes they can find refuge.
The movie is at times quiet and con
templative, and at other times very vio
lent. Bui the violence in the movie works
to advance the story line, not to interfere
with it. The deaths in "Perdition" are por
trayed as cold and unflinching, as they
should be, and Sam Mendes has a gift for
building tension and releasing it at pre
cisely the right moment.

Reign of Fire
irtrCrti
Holy firebreathers! "Reign of Fire"
is supposed to be an epic jour
ney, a quest to save mankind.
But the story line never creates a sense of
urgency behind the dragon-fighting en
terprise.
The plot revolves around post-apoca
lyptic dragons that burn things up and
eat the ash. After they've burned every
thing, there's nothing left to eat. They
die. In a cute twist of paleontology and
geology, this explains the mass extinc
tion of the dinosaurs, and the last ice-age
(ash in the air blocks out the sun, you get
the point).
When we meet the film's hero,
Quinn (Christian Bale) he knows all this
and that the dragons are "starving" as a
result. Instead of putting two and two
together, and waiting them out, he de
cides now is the time to strike.
Why? The only reason we're given is
from his daft sidekick Van Zan
(Matthew McConaughey): starvation is
making the dragons "meaner."
The real stars in"Reign of Fire" are
the special effects. But the special effects
aren't as big a part of the movie as they
should be.
