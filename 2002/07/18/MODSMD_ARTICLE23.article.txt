Akira Kurosawa's "Rashomon" (1950) begins in feudal Japan when
a commoner enters a ruined gatehouse seeking shelter from the rain.
Already within are a woodcutter (Takashi Shimura) and a priest (Mi
nora Chiaki), both muttering, "I don't understand." The pair reveals

that they are despairing over the recent
trial of a bandit (Toshiro Mifune) who
ambushed a samurai (Masayuki Mori)
and raped his wife (Machiko Kyo). At
some point, the samurai was killed.
However, each of the three characters
(the samurai testifying from beyond
the grave) gives a wildly different ac
count of how he died.
Few films have subverted viewers'
faith in events on-screen as effectively as
"Rashomon." Kurosawa makes us
aware of how easily distorted "real life"
becomes in its retelling, since the movie
is his retelling of a retelling of a retelling
and what actually transpired between
the three principals remains a haunting
mystery. Ultimately, the film shows how

human beings are incapable of being honest, even with themselves.
Kurosawa utilizes dazzling cinematography to tell a story that is as
gorgeous as it is thought-provoking. The present, shrouded in doubt,
is drenched in torrents of rain, while the past, illuminated by sharp
rays of sunlight piercing through the trees, is at once more real and al
most hallucinatory. The acting initially feels a little overwrought, but
the performances actually have substance and subtlety, particularly in
their small, crucial shifts from one retelling to another.
"Rashomon" has been released on DVD by Criterion, which is
known tor its superior bonus material. The audio commentary by film
historian Donald Ritchie buries a few insights between statements that
are either thuddingly obvious or just plain wrong, but there is some
consolation in the clips from"The World of Kazuo Miyagawa," a re
vealing documentary about the movie's cinematographer.
