# 'State' shines with Falco and Bassett
## 
### ADAM WOOLEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At first, "Sunshine State"
seems like a biting commen
tary about the war between
small town folks and evil big
business.
There's a struggle for
survival, as small business
owners and home owners
fight out-of-city developers
who march into town and
try to get everyone to sell

out.
Director John Sayles makes no
effort to convince us that his film
will be about anything but that. We
even see corporate villains dis
cussing "key properties" needed to
get everyone else to fall.
There are two main communi
ties in the film: Delrona Beach,
populated by white small business
owners and retirees, and Lincoln
Beach, a long time community for
black residents. Typically, this
would result in a film about small
business owners fighting evil cor
porate real-estate developers, and
about a small black community
being squeezed out of town by rich
white businessmen. But that is not
the case.
"Sunshine State" is a character
driven story about people, their
complex lives and relationships,
and how they adapt and change.
The developers aren't even all
that bad.

"The Sopranos") and Desiree (Angela Bassett), a

woman who has returned with new her
husband (James McDaniel) to visit her
mother after leaving town when she was
15 years old. Each of the two main char
acters, whom we follow in two parallel
story lines, are surrounded by several
supporting characters, and the film
thrives on the relationships that sur-
