# "Mia!" full of song, adventure, dance
## 
### TIFFANY LEE 
"Mamma Mia!" captures the au
dience and draws them into a zany
universe full of song, dance, laugh
ter and tears.
The musical is constructed
around songs written by ABBA,
the Swedish musical group that
came together in the 19705. The
tunes are alive and upbeat, and
"Mamma Mia!" works as a comedy
although it contains material that
could be found in a drama.

The musical's heroine, Sophie
(Michelle Aravena), is a young
woman who is planning her wed
ding while also trying to find the
identity of her father, whom she
never met. The premise may
sound boring at first, especially to
someone who is not familiar with
the production — but on the
stage, it is wonderfully choreo
graphed.
After doing a little digging, So
phie discovers that her mother,
Donna (Dee Hoty), slept with

three different men in the
months preceding her concep
tion. So she does the only thing
that she can: She invites all three
of the men to the wedding with
out telling her mother.
The confrontation, one of the
musical's more memorable
scenes, is wonderful. Hoty gives a
a very moving rendition of the
title song. Her voice is spectacu
lar, the lighting is perfect and she
throws the audience into fits of
laughter. She over exaggerates as
a subtle reminder to the audience
to not take life too seriously.
After Donna's two best friends
realize her distress, they quickly
run to her rescue by applying a
never fail remedy. They sing into
hair dryers and hair brushes
while jumping up and down on
the bed, and reminisce about
their past adventures as an all
girl band.
Granted, some of the other
scenes don't appear to (it the gen
eral plot. They seem more like an
excuse just to sing more ABBA
music, but this doesn't hurt the
overall impact of the musical. In
fact, the randomness adds to the
general attitude and ambience of
the whole play, making it even
more fun loving, entertaining
and endearing.
It's been a long time since I've
encountered anything that made
me smile and laugh outright as
much as this production did.
"Mamma Mia!" opened on
Broadway last year, and like all
good musicals, has now found its
way into the Bay Area. It is wild
and unpredictable and a real
treat.
Showtimes: Now through
Sept. 14 at the Orpheum The
atre. Matinees are on Saturday
and Sunday at 2 p.m. Evening
shows run Tuesday through Sat
urday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at
