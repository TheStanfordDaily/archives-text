# E-40 album 'Grind,' too fast for its flow
## 
### PETER KAZANJY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
E-40 is a big tan of his own flow. I'm not. In his latest album, "Grit
and Grind," he likes to talk about how he doesn't "rap too fast, "y'all
just listen too slow." True, speed of delivery can make hip-hop that
much hotter. But the rapper shouldn't need to resort to end
rhyming to support that speed.
Sure, end-rhyme is the traditional format of hip-hop rhyme mak
ing, but it is also the most simplistic. One can't help but think that in
E-40's pursuit of lightning speed, he might be missing out on devel
oping other parts of his game â€” perhaps some internal rhyme,
some serious alliteration, something. Because right now, he's playing
checkers while Blackalicious and Del spit straight chess.
That's not to badmouth checkers. It's a popular game, just as E
-40 is a fairly popular rapper. But he's really not breaking any barri
ers here or transcending anything of note.
Granted, "Grit and Grind" might be fun for your barbecue. Track
eight especially, since what barbecue would be complete without
"Mustard and Mayonnaise"? Of course, our boy devotes this song to
the tires on his car, and not anything made by Heinz or Kraft. But it
still sounds good. The title at least. The intro is pretty hot, as E-40
talks cars with his son and provides in the process a fairly compre
hensive East Bay hip-hop vernacular primer. Hot too is the samba
beat over which 'E' raps. He even gets a chance to use that diamond
encrusted whistle that he flosses so heavily on the cover and liner
notes of the album.
But the cool production goes to waste on this track in that E-40
raps it the same as he raps every track: fast. Most emcees like to talk
about riding on the beat, melding your flow with its. Look at Eminem
or the above-mentioned Blackalicious for great examples of this. E
-40 doesn't ride it. He plows right through it sticking to the same lilt
ing inflection you've heard for the seven previous tracks, and that
you'll hear on the next seven too. Eventually, enough is enough, and
it's time to go get another CD.
A notable exception to this comes in the form of Afroman's guest
appearance on "Roll On," which brings the same free-wheeling
rhyming everyone liked so much on "Because I Got High." His guest
rapping won him a new fan, while making all the more plain exactly
why E-40 doesn't make the grade.
fhe Bay Area is a great place for hip-hop, distinctive and innova
tive hip-hop. If you want the blin- blingboom-boom of Cash Money's
dirty south, seek it there. If you want gang banging, check out mid
90s Death Row. If you want Bay Area at its best, you won't find it on
"Grit and Grind." Life's too short for grade 'E' rap.
Verdict: Might go well with a keg of Natty Ice. Or maybe only after
a keg of it.
