# BIG BROTHERS 3 Watch
## 
### 
To our great relief, the second week in the "Big Brother
3" household continued the show's trend of setting the high
est benchmark in quality television.
Here's what happened:

THURSDAY, July 11. Bible-toting
Jason, who is 25 and from Mobile, Alab., re
vealed that, yes, he was still a virgin. Had
this been the raunchy MTV show "Tail
daters" (indeed, another program that sets
the standard for sophisticated television) he
would have been laughed into the next
Promise Keeper's convention. But this,
clearly, is "Big Brother 3" — and the other
sex-starved women houseguests swooned

over him until the next commercial break. 1 le was IW-ecl later,
but at a luxury competition with a Hawaiian theme.
Josh, the waiter from Long Island, N.Y. who lied about his
profession, decided that it was time for an alliance. I le bond
ed with six other members of the house — including Gerry
(a real teacher) and 1 lead of Household Lisa. They discussed
who to boot and who to keep. The dialogue turned exclu

sionary. It was very Republican of them.
The episode ended with one of the most climactic televi
sion moments of all time. Lisa (the bartender who still has big
attitude), decided — drum roll please —that she would put
the two most "distant" houseguests up for eviction. They
were: Marcellas (as we predicted), the gay stylist who project
ed "bad energy"; and Lori (as we also predicted) the single
mom who won the Tree Straddling Contest last week with
Jason.
Don't worry, ladies: He's still a virgin. There was no extra
straddling in their Tree.

SATURDAY, July 13. A hush tell over
the liig Brother 3 household as host Julie
Chen (fashionably chic and unfashionably
un-joumalistic, as usual) announced to the
houseguests that they were in fora "big"
surprise. We held our breaths lor the next
45 minutes to learn what it was.
In the meantime, the houseguests
stripped to their bathing suits (they seem to
disrobe even to mop the floor) to play the

next Food Competition Challenge. Amy (the real estate ap
praiser from Memphis, Tenn.) wanted cheese. She loves
cheese. Then the houseguests hid the cheese from her as a
joke. She cried. They felt bad. They returned the cheese.
Chen later announced a new wrinkle in the Big Brother
household that would change the game (gasp! gasp!) forev
er. Each week, a houseguest will have a chance to veto one of
the nominees and save them by winning the Beetle Compe
tition. If the winner decides to use his power, the head of
household must select another nominee to replace the one

who luts been "saved" (the Beetle winner, obviously, will be
immune), Gerry won the Beetle. He rejoiced at his victory. If
he shaved off his moustache, he'd l)e as unstoppable as
wrestler-t u rned-goverrlor J esse Ventura.
WEDNESDAY, J uly 17. Last night, things broiled past the
"boil" knob on the Big Brother 3 household.
Gerry decided to (of all horrors) rebel from the alliance.
He realized that the only reason Marcellas was nominated for
eviction was because he was (1) black; and (2) gay. Duh. Then
he spent the remainder of the episode saying that he had two
black nephews and many gay friends. Jesse Ventura would
have been proud.
Meanwhile, things got steamy in the Big Brother 3 bath
room. Danielle (the media buyer from Fairfield, Calif.) no
ticed that Gerry didn't wash his hands after doing his busi
ness. She held a house meeting, and discussed the obvious
problem at hand. Thankfully, it wasn't anything that a little
soap and water couldn't fix.
Finally, Gerry shocked the world when he announced
that, indeed, he would use his Beetle power. He saved Mar
cellas from eviction. This irked Lisa, as well as the other four
people in her alliance, and she decided (at last) to nominate
Amy in Marcellas's place.
OUR PREDICTION: It's difficult choosing between Amy
(who is beginning to act more and more like a blond corn
husker) and Lori (who started shouting at Danielle for being
"two-faced" about the whole Hand Washing dilemma). But
we're going to go with Lori. I ler motto: "I'm here fora good
time, not a long time." Well, we hope she's had fun. Because
after tonight, her time will be over.
