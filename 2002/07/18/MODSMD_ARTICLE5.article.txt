## Makeover of Building 160 nears completion Improvements aim to integrate technology with research and education 
### JEFF EGER 
Construction is nearing an end
on the Quad as the newly-remod
eled Building 160 prepares to re
open its doors and welcome its
newest occupant, the Stanford
Center for Innovations in Learn
ing
Home to the University's first li
brary, the turn of the century
building has housed both the Law
School and the Department of Po
litical Science. I his fall, the remod
eled building will open as Wallen
berg Hall, with the official inaugu
ration scheduled for Oct. 24.
Designed to be a technological
marvel for use by researchers as
well as students, one focus of Wal
lenberg Hall will be to advance re
search that bridges technology and
education. SCIL will govern and
operate the building.
"It's about researching and in
venting the future of learning,"
said SCI L's co-director, Education
Prof. Roy Pea.
At 50,000 square feet, it will be
come the fourth-largest classroom
building on the Quad.
Besides housing SCIL, Wallen
berg Hall highlights include a cafe,
five foreign language teaching
rooms and two media editing
rooms for students within its base
ment. The upper floors will in
clude numerous classrooms, re

search areas and meeting rooms.
SCIL, along with the Stanford
Humanities Laboratory and Media
X, will be located on the fourth
floor, an area that will showcase
movable walls that can be re
arranged and allow researchers to
reshape their work areas.
The exterior of the building will
blend in with other buildings locat
ed in the Quad. Inside, however,
state-of-the-art technology will set
the building apart.
Some of the educational-based
technological goodies will include
real-time audio and video commu
nications, and whiteboards capable
of storing written information for
students to download later.
Although it will display the most
current learning-based technolo
gy, Wallenberg Hall was built with
the intention of adapting to future
formats.
SCIL's director of technical
services, Bob Smith, remarked
that the building was designed
with an infrastructure that would
support whatever technology de
velops over the lifetime of the
building.
For example, rather than hid
den in the walls, cables and com
puter wiring run under raised
floors, allowing ease of accessibility
in the future.
This merging of education with
technology will allow researchers
to study and formulate new and
better methods for teaching stu
dents at all levels.
Pea and Stig Hagstrom, profes
sor emeritus of Materials Science
and Engineering, will lead SCIL.

"We want to contribute to and
build on the knowledge that ad
vances the science of how people
learn," Pea said.
Within Wallenberg Hall, both
will take an active role in guiding
the future of education.
"The real theme is lifelong
learning," said 1 lagstrom. "We will
try to erase the boundaries be

tween the phases of education."
The newly-renovated building
is named after the Wallenberg fam
ily.
In 1999, a $15 million grant to
the University from the Knut and
Alice Wallenberg Foundation and
the Marianne and Marcus Wallen
berg Foundation of Sweden
helped initiate the renovation of

Building 160.
Part of the money also went to
fund projects that utilized technolo
gy in education beginning with the
Stanford Learning Lab, now closed,
which was launched in 1997 to ex
plore the use oI technology in high
er education.
SOIL will also receive funding
from the Wallenberg grant.
