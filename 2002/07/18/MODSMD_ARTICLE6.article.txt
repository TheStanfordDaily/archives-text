### KATIE TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This year, 10 Stanford undergraduates
received national merit scholarships, in
cluding the Morris K. Udall scholarship,
the Beinecke scholarship, the Barry M.
Goldwater scholarship and the Truman
scholarship.
Two Morris K. Udall scholarships were
awarded to juniors Felicia Y. Frizzell,
Jonathan A. Neril and Linda E. Orie, while
junior Joshua I. Herlands received an hon
orable mention. Out of the 447 nomina
tions sent to the Udall foundation by col
lege professors, 80 scholarships were
awarded. Scholars received $5,000 to be
used for academic purposes while students
who were awarded an honorable mention

received $850 for academic purposes.
Junior Valerie Brar received the Bei
necke scholarship, which awards students
$2,000 just prior to entering graduate
school and $80,000 during graduate
school. The Beinecke scholarship program
lias recognized more than 295 college ju
niors from 92 different schools since 1975.
Sophomores Yvonne Y. Chen, Tejaswini
K. More and junior Melinda K. Munos were
selected as Barry M. Gold water Scholars.
The Goldwater foundation awarded schol
arships to 809 students this year out of the
1,115 students nominated by professors.
The Goldwater foundation recognizes
students in the fields of mathematics, sci
ence and engineering. Each scholar is
awarded $7,500 to be used for academic
purposes over the next year for current ju

niors, and the next two years for current
sophomores.
"I'm grateful for the scholarship as it has
allowed for me the opportunity to stay
here at Stanford for the summer to do re
search," said More.
"In the future 1 hope to pursue inter
disciplinary research that is problem-solv
ing oriented and therapeutically driven,"
said More. "This entails not only pursuing
answers to basic science questions but also
asking how those answers can be used to
design ways of treating human ailments."
Juniors Nina Robertson and Theresa
Bridgeman were recipients of this year's
Truman Scholarship, which selects schol
ars based on their leadership potential, in
tellectual ability and likelihood of "making
a difference."

Truman scholars are elected by 15 inde
pendent selection panels and receive
$3,000 for their senior year of college and
$27,000 to be used for graduate study.
"When students win one of these
awards, it's not just a sign of their individ
ual accomplishments, but also of the amaz
ing support and mentoring that they have
received from Stanford faculty," said Susie
Brubaker-Cole, director of Undergradu
ate Research Programs.
"All of these awards require at least
three letters of recommendation, and the
letters from faculty describe in detail how
students developed close intellectual rela
tionships with their mentors. It's always a
thrill to read these letters and to see how
mutually invested students and faculty are
in common projects and interests."
