HYDERABAD, Pakistan (Al») — Sen
tenced to hang for the kidnap-murder of a
Wall Street Journal reporter, a British-born
Islamic militant threatened Pakistan's rulers
Monday and warned that the battle lines be
tween Muslims and non-Muslims have been
drawn.
"We shall see who will die first, me or the
authorities who have arranged the death
sentence for me," Ahmed Omar Saeed
Sheikh said in a statement read by a defense
lawyer after the court convicted him and
three accomplices in the killing of journalist
Daniel Pearl.
President Pervez Musharraf should know
"Allah is there and can get his revenge," said
Saeed, a 28-year-old former student at the
London School of Economics. "Everybody is
showing whether he is in favor of Islam 0r...
non-Muslims."
Fhe trial has enraged Pakistan's Islamic
militant movement, which considers
Musharraf a traitor for backing the United
States in the war against terrorism.
Saeed and his co-defendants — Salman
Saqib, Fahad Naseeni and Shaikh Adil — sat
motionless as Judge Ali Ashraf Shah an
nounced his verdict.
All four men were convicted of murder,
kidnapping, conspiracy to kidnap and tam

pering with evidence. Saeed's three accom
plices got life sentences — which in Pakistan
means 25 years in prison.
Defense lawyers said they would appeal, a
process that could take months or years. The
last prominent Islamic extremist to be exe
cuted in Pakistan, Haq Nawaz, was hanged
on Feb. 28, 2001, for killing an Iranian
diplomat a decade earlier.
The 38-year-old Pearl disappeared Jan.
23 in Karachi while researching Pakistan's
Islamic extremist community, including
possible links to Richard C. Reid, arrested in
December on a flight from Paris to Miami
with explosives in his shoes.
In February, a videotape received by U.S.
diplomats confirmed Pearl was killed. A
body believed to be Pearl's was found in May
in a shallow grave in Karachi, but results
from I)NA tests have not been announced.
Seven other suspects are at large.
Prosecutors said Saeed lured Pearl into a
trap by promising to arrange an interview
with an Islamic cleric who police believe was
not involved in the conspiracy.
The defendants were also collectively
fined $32,000. Chief prosecutor Raja
Quereshi said the money would go to Pearl's
widow Mariane and their son, who was born
after his father was killed.

U.S. officials welcomed the verdict, but
the U.S. Embassy was on a heightened secu
rity alert. U.S. grand juries have indicted
Saeed in the Pearl case and in the 1994 kid
napping in India of an American who was
released unharmed.
"This is a further example of Pakistan
showing leadership in the war against ter
ror," White House spokesman Aim Fleischer
said Monday.
State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher said the United States still has an in
terest in extraditing Saeed but would watch
developments in Pakistan before deciding
what to do. He urged Americans in Pakistan
to remain vigilant about their safety.
The Pearl family, in a statement posted
on its Web site, said it was "grateful for the
tireless efforts" by U.S. and Pakistani au
thorities "to bring those guilty of Danny's
kidnapping and murder to justice."
Saeed's father, Ahmed Saeed Sheikh,
proclaimed his son's innocence and de
scribed the trial as a painful ordeal. "It's a
horrible feeling," he said.
In London, Saeed's brother, Awais
Sheikh, termed the conviction a "grotesque
miscarriage of justice" and said the family
"will not stand by and let one of its members
be executed fora crime he did not commit."

The prosecution presented 23 witnesses,
including taxi driver Nasir Abbas, who testi
fied he saw Pearl get into a car with Saeed in
front of a Karachi restaurant on the night
the reporter vanished. The defense claimed
the government coached the witness.
The United Jehad Council, an organiza
tion of 15 Islamic militant groups, said the
verdict "will definitely add to the hatred
against America."
Although Pakistani authorities braced for
a violent backlash, there were no reports of
protests in the country late Monday. The
trial began April 22 in Karachi but was
moved here after prosecutors said they re
ceived death threats.
Pearl's kidnapping was the first in a series
of attacks against Westerners in Pakistan. On
March 17, an attacker hurled grenades into
Protestant church in the capital of Islam
abad, killing himself and four others, includ
ing two Americans.
A bomb exploded May 8 in Karachi,
killing 11 French engineers and three Pak
istanis. Another explosion killed 12 Pakista
nis outside the U.S. Consulate in Karachi on
June 14. Last weekend, grenades were
thrown at a bus carrying European tourists
in northern Pakistan, injuring a dozen peo
ple, most of them Germans.
