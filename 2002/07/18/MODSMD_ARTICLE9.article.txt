# SAT reporting procedure changes
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — The scores of SAT exams
taken by disabled students who needed extra time
will no longer be "flagged," or pointed out to col
leges and others looking at the results, The College
Board says. Advocates had said the practice violat
ed federal law.
The announcement on Monday came as part of
a settlement with Disability Rights Advocates, a
nonprofit law firm in Oakland, Calif., averting a
possible lawsuit.
The new policy, which takes effect Oct. 1, 2003,
applies not only to the widely-used college entrance
exam but to the College Board's PSAT and Ad
vanced Placement exams.
Disability advocates praised the decision as end
ing a discriminatory practice, though some admis
sions officials have warned that flagging tests deters
false disability claims filed by students who want
more time to take exams in hopes ofboosting their
scores.
Flagging is done by adding the words "nonstan
dard administration" on score reports.
The vast majority of test takers who receive spe
cial accommodation get more time, typicallv lor at
tention deficit disorder and dyslexia. Among more
than 1 million students who took the various Col
lege Board tests in the school year that ended in
June, 55,550 required special accommodation, said
spokeswoman Cniara Coletti.
"We're extremely pleased," said Alison Anbre
juan. a Disability Rights Advocates attorney. I lie
group is now looking at the ACT's college entrance
test — the SATs rival — and other admissions tests
such as the LSAT for law schools, she said.
"We're hopeful that, in light of today's settle
ment with the College Board, these other testing
agencies will be re-evaluating their policies and
cease their practice of flagging."
ACT Inc. plans to continue flagging exams taken
by the disabled for the time being, but is re-evaluat
ing its policy, spokesman Ken Cullette said.
The new policy is a sort of postscript to a 1999

federal lawsuit that Disability Rights Advocates
brought against the College Board's independent
spinoff, the Educational Testing Service of Prince
ton, N.J., which develops and administers College
Board tests along with its own exams.
The lawsuit was brought initially by Mark
Breimhorst, who has no hands and requested extra
time to take ETS's business school admissions test,
the GMAT. The International Dyslexia Association
and Californians for Disability Rights later joined as
plaintiff's. In late 2000, a settlement was reached,
with ETS agreeing it would no longer llag its tests
taken with extended time.
The College Board also took part in those settle
ment talks. Part of the ETS settlement was an agree
ment that a special panel take up the question of
flagging College Board tests. If the College Board
failed to resolve the issue, the plaintiffs would be
free to sue.
This April, the panel recommended the College
Board stop flagging extended-time tests.
" This is really going to change the lives of people
with disabilities," said Breimhorst, 32, who is now a
student in Stanford University's MBA program.
" I liey don't have to have this scarlet letter at
tached to their transcript. 'Here's this guy who got
this score, but...,'" he said.
Gaston Caperton, president of the College
Board said in a prepared statement that, "we have
agreed to abide by their decision. While agreeing
that the rights of disabled persons should prevail
over other considerations, we also recognize the on
going concerns raised by guidance counselors and
admissions directors... to ensure that extended test
taking time is not granted to students who do not
require this accommodation."
While each high school is responsible for deter
mining whether a disability merits extra time, Col
lege Board guidelines say proof of such an impair
ment should include a school file documenting <i
history of problems requiring accommodation and
a diagnosis b\ an expert.
