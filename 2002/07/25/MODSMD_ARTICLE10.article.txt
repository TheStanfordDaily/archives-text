### JIMMY WU STAFF WRITER 
With the coveted U.S. Open peeking
over the horizon, some of the world's finest
women's tennis players have demonstrated
their competitive lire while honing their
skills at the Bank of the West Classic, being
played at Stanford's own Taube Family
Tennis Stadium.
In one of Stanford's biggest athletic
events of year, the women in the singles
draw have pleased large crowds with their
incredible speed, deftness and joy in the
game.
Included in the final draw are six of the
top-10 women in the world. Receiving byes
in the lirst round were Americans No. 2
Venus Williams, No. 3 Lindsay Davenport,
No. 4 Monica Seles, and 2001 Classic cham
pion No. 5 Kim Clijsters from Belgium.
Rounding out the top-eight seeds in the
tournament were No. 6 Jelena Dokic from
Yugoslavia, No. 7 Justine Henin from Bel

gium, No. 17 Daja Bedanova from the
Czech Republic and No. 18 AnnaSmashno
va from Israel.
The current field has quite a history at
the Classic, as the top-seeded Williams was
the 2000 Champion (finalist in 1998 and
1999), Davenport held the trophy in 1998
and 1999 (also a finalist in 2000 and 2001),
and Seles was a Bank of the West Classic
Champion in 1990 and 1992 (finalist in
1996). Ai Sugiyama from Japan was also a fi
nalist in 1995, and Conchita Martinez
reached the finals in 1997.
When the draw was released on Friday,
Stanford lims received an unexpected sur
prise when four Stanford alumni were
scheduled to play in the main draw of the
singles and doubles tournament.
Based on her strong performance in the
first half of the season, former Cardinal and
two-time NCAA singles champion Laura
Cranville, ranked No. 92 in the world, re-

Stanford alumna Marissa Irvin upset No. 7 Justine Henin 6-3, 4-6, 6-1 on Tuesday to advance to
the second round of the Bank of the West Classic.
ceived a wild card after advancing
to the fourth round of Wimbledon
a few weeks ago.
However, even with the Stan
ford Band practicing in the back
ground, Granville was unable to
reproduce some of that magic on
Monday night as she fell to the
Spaniard great Martinez, 6-3, 6-3.
No. 74 Martinez made it to the
draw as a qualifier.
Despite her second first-round
exit in as many years at the Classic,
Granville was glad to be back.
"It feels great to be back playing
on the Farm," she said. "1 always
love coining back here. Some of my
friends are taking summer school
classes now, so they were out there
cheering for me."
Another former Cardinal who
made it into the draw as a qualifier
was No. 63 Marissa Irvin.
Irvin, who reached two NCAA
singles finals while at Stanford,
played the match of her life against
sixth-seeded Henin, getting out to
an early lead and capturing the
first set 6-3.
After dropping the second set,
Irvin did not disappoint her
home crowd fans, and pulled off
the first upset of the tournament
with a 6-3, 4-6, 6-1 victory over
the Belgian.
"This is definitely my biggest

win to date," she said. "I came out
playing some of the best tennis that
I've played in my life. Winning that
first set was pretty big."
The last two Stanford affiliates
were recent graduates Lauren
Kalvaria and Gabriela Lastra. The
2002 NCA\ doubles champions
made it into the doubles draw as a
wild card, and they faced Rita
Grande and Patricia Tarabini yes
terday, but Kalvaria and Lastra
could not compensate for their
lack of experience as they lost 7-5,
6-2.
Also pulling off an early upset
was No. 56 Anna Kournikova, who
impressed fans with a victory over
Smashnova on Tuesday night.
Mired in a recent two-month,
five-match losing streak, the popu
lar Kournikova showed that she is
not just a great spokeswoman with
a convincing 6-3, 6-2 victory over
Smashnova. She will face qualifier
Wynne Prakusya of Indonesia in
the second round.
While much attention was fo
cused on Kournikova, Clijsters and
American Meilin Tu were battling
it out on Court One.
Tu had advanced to meet Cli
jsters with a minor upset on Mon
day, by squeaking past fellow com
patriot Alexandra Stevenson 7-5,
6-4. Unfortunately, Tu's victory
pitted her against defending
champion Clijsters and the Belgian
proved too much in the second
round as she won 7-5,6-2.
The action continued on

Wednesday as Dokic, who had lit
tle trouble advancing into the sec
ond round after defeating No. 60
Amy Frazier, 6-3, 7-5, defeated
Martinez 1-6, 6-0,6-1.
The old pros took to the court
Wednesday night as both Lindsey
Davenport and Monica Seles ad
vanced into the next round.
Davenport trounced No. 21
Anne Kremer 6-3, 6-0 to leave her
mark on the court.
On the opposite court, Seles
eventually dispatched No. 27
Tamarine Tanasugarn 6-4, 3-6, 6-
1 to move ahead in the tourney.
In the doubles bracket, both the
No. 2 and No. 4 seeds have already
been knocked out of contention
while top-seeded Lisa Raymond
and Rennae Stubbs and third
seeded Kournikova and Meghann
Shaughnessy both advanced into
the second round.
Granville and her partner Jen
nifer Hopkins pulled off a win on
Wednesday night to stay in the
tournament.
In a long match, Granville and
I lopkins took Alexandra Fusai and
Caroline Vis in three sets 6-3, 6-7,
7-6
The action continues today as
Williams takes to the court to lace
No. 19 Shaughnessy in the evening
