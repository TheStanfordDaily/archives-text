# Tennis's new appeal tries tradition
## 
### TERRY HURLBUTT EDITORIAL STAFF 
Visit Taube Family Tennis Sta
dium this week, and you will find
yourself caught between two
worlds at the Bank of the West
Classic.
With the advent of the new mil
lennium, women's tennis finds it
self a growing commercial power
in the world of athletics. 1 lowever,
capitalizing on this power means a
serious transition fora sport that
has enjoyed a long history of nobil
ity — it means accommodating a
broader fan base.
In plain terms, it's a battle be
tween progress and tradition — a
conflict as old as time itself.
The trappings from the past are
present today. Only in tennis do
plush velvet red ropes exist, which
gently but firmly prevent anyone
from going to one's seat prema
turely, possibly hindering the view
of the lounging spectators.
The umpire's polite reprimand
for voices travelling onto the court,
— presumably disrupting the play
ers' concentration — is a voice
from the past.
The reverent silence that fol
lows the continued movement of
the ball is suspect for its very lac k of
heckles and wild cheers.
And the women still wear skirts.
Well, sort of.
In fact, it is the athletes them

selves who best bridge the division
between past and present de
mands.
From the first night of play, the
women on the court showed how
the game has changed.
Former Stanford player Laura
Granville returned to her home
court to face one of the sport's vet
erans in Conchita Martinez.
While Granville had the Stanford
Band (playing in the background)
and her friends behind Iter, she
was no match for Martinez's expe
rience.
Martinez put on a dazzling
show, placing balls all over the
court with near impeccability and
proving that age can indeed be an
advantage.
Stanford alumna Marissa
Irvin took to the court Tuesday
afternoon against No. 7 Justine
Henin in a hard-fought three-set
match.
Irvin pulled off the upset after a
breathless display of athleticism.
While Irvin's serve reached 109
miles per hour, her strength did
not distract from either the sheer
strategy of her game plan or
I lenin's quick responses.
Intelligent players make the
game much more rewarding.
By Tuesday night, some of the
biggest changes the sport has had to
endure were on display as the
crowd reacted to Anna Kournikova.
While Kournikova was busy

concentrating on defeating Smash
nova 6-3,6-2, a large percentage of
the males in the crowd was Imsy
concentrating on her.
With every stoppage of play,
camera flashes lit the stadium —
with some fans even settling for the
best possible shot of the back of her
head.
After the match ended, a surge
of fans raced to the railings in a des
perate attempt to get an autograph
on anything — framed pho
tographs, tennis balls and Fed Ex
boxes.
However, Kournikova is not the
only one setting the style.
Monica Seles, Venus Williams,
Kim Clijsters and Lindsay Daven
port are all foremothers of a new
era of female physical prowess in
tennis. These women dive and
jump and, yes, grunt.
They're fun to watch.
In fact, the players are the rea
son women's tennis is enjoying
such a level of popularity among
such a diverse fan base.
So as old continues to merge
with new, a delightful spectacle un
folds for both fans and players
alike.
"1 still enjoy it — that's why 1 do
it," said Martinez. "Its a hard pro
fession but 1 like to play. Whenev
er I'm ready to go I'll know, but
right now is not the time to throw
in the racket."
Thank goodness.
