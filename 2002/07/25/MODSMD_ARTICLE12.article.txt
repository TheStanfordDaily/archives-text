# Cardinal swimmers make splash at meet
## Junior Tara Kirk leads Cardinal at Janet Evans Invite 
### KENNETH GARRETT EDITORIAL STAFF 
The worst of their training
may be over, but the pressure is
still mounting for the Stanford
men's and women's swimming
teams.
With just three weeks left be
fore the Phillips-66 National
Swimming Championships in Ft.
Lauderdale, Fla., last weekend's
Janet Evans Invitational in Los An
geles provided an excellent forum
for the Cardinal to prove its mettle
on the national stage.
Fhe NCAA's reigning breast
stroke queen, junior Tara Kirk,
wasted no time in cowing her com
petition. Saturday's 200-meter
breaststroke final saw Kirk rocket
to a first-place finish in 2 minutes
and 29.25 seconds, ahead of 2000
Olympic bronze medalist Amanda
Beard (2:29.29) and incoming
Stanford freshman Kristen Caver
ly (2:32.59).
In what is becoming a pleasing

pattern for Kirk, she also took gold
in the 100 breast with a time of
1:08.5 i, defeating Olympians Sta
ciana Stitts of California (1:09.86)
and Beard (1:10.11).
Sophomore teammate Lacey
Boutwell clocked a stellar time for
herself in the 100 freestyle, taking
sixth place with a mark of 58.11,
after posting a 57.66 in prelims.
Boutwell had some fire left for the
100 backstroke, and took 17th
place with a time of 1:05.72.
The Cardinal men also fared
well in Los Angeles, and feel pre
pared to trounce their competi
tion at nationals.
"We all know we're going to be
faster," said junior Peter Marshall.
"This past meet was just a warmup
for Ft. Lauderdale."
If senior Randall Bal is just
warming up, his competition
might as well just quit now. Bal
produced personal records in the
100 and 50 freestyle events, com
ing in fourth and third respective
ly. With less than a second separat
ing Bal from first place in the 100
last weekend, anything is possible
next month.
"I had no idea I would drop a
second and a half," Bal said.
"There's no way to get in better

shape now. I need to just focus on
techniques and hope it all comes
together."
Bal also showed his strength in
the 100 backstroke.
"There was a lot of pressure

swimming against the fastest back
strokers in the world," Bal said in
reference to current world record
holders Lenny Krayzelburg and
Aaron Piersol, as well as teammate
Marshall.

Whereas such stiff competition
might frighten the weak, it only
makes these Cardinal champions
crave the victory more. Though
