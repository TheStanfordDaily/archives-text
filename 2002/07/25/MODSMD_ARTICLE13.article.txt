# Cardinal athletes host summer fun with camps on Farm
## Stanford's reputation makes summer camps among best in nation

They jump, they swing, I hey tackle and
i hey lunge. Touche!
Some sail, others swim and most run.
Fhey may be small, but these athletes have a
drive to succeed as large as the Stanford su
perstars whose facilities they've invaded.
They're campers at the 2002 Stanford
Summer Sports Camps, olfered in over 20
sports ranging from football and basketball
to sailing, swimming, lacrosse and even fenc
ing. The sports are different but the camps
have at least two things in common: they're
among the best in the country, and they're a
ton of fun.
In fact, thousands of campers come from
all over the country and the world to fill a
very limited number of spots, and waiting
lists are often full.
"We have strong men's and women's var
sity programs," said soccer camp director
J.T. Batson in explanation for the popularity
ol Stanford's Summer Sports Camps. "Not
many schools can match our track record."
With the Cardinal's eighth-consecutive
Sears Cup now on display in the Hall of
Fame, swim camp director Skip Kenney
couldn't help but agree.
"Parents hope that some of the success of

Stanford's athletes will rub oil on their kids.
The Stanford name sells itself."
Stanford's superb athletic facilities, good
weather, unparalleled reputation and
above-par accommodations combine to
make a perfect setting for sports camps. But
it is undoubtedly the outstanding coaching
staff that bring the camps to life.
"The coaches have knowledge, enthusi
asm and great character," said swim-camper
Dan Murrow, a winner of the coveted Skip
Kenney Award for being a selfless and dedi
cated camper. "It's great working with these
coaches because they train college kids who
are Olympians. Taking knowledge from

people who know so much really makes you
feel good."
An average day at most camps consists of
skill work in the morning and a chance to
practice newly-minted techniques in the af
ternoon. It's a lot of work, hut fun is still the
most important part of the equation.
"When they're having fun, learning just
happens," Kenney said.
A perfect example is the mock America's
Cup held each week at the sailing camp. The
campers break into teams, decorate their
boats by country (one clever group chose to
represent Vatican City) and race around a
course at the Stanford Sailing Center near

Redwood City.
"This is a great chance to get into the
boats and really learn how to sail," said sail
ing camp director Amy Gross.
In light of the pervasive and erroneous
myth that the Stanford Athletics Depart
ment is hilly funded by Nike contracts and
gate revenues, many find it hard to under
stand why Stanford would open its facilities
to camps. But the truth is, the camps are an
economic necessity for many sports pro
grams on the Farm.
"Stanford sailing is a non-revenue varsity
sport, and we raise our own money," Gross
said. "We travel two weekends out of the
month for two seasons. This summer camp is
necessary or there'd be no Stanford sailing
team. It's the money we live on."
Even larger and more established pro
grams find the camps a requirement. Camp
revenues allow the coaches to stay on cam
pus over the summer to train varsity athletes
and recruit new ones. In addition, camp
wages help offset the exorbitant housing
costs in the Silicon Valley. Without the
camps, it would be very difficult to attract the
best coaches to Stanford.
With such a successful track record for
Stanford's sports camps, one might be reluc
tant to fix what's not broken.
"The soccer camps sell out and we don't
even advertise," Batson said.
But, like their athletes, Stanford coaches
won't settle for good enough, and the camps
are constantly improving. In addition to out-

fitting campers in a full line of pro
fessional gear masterminded by a
former Bloomingdale's manager
this year, Kenney's swim camp also
uses video analysis to give campers
more personal attention.
" They not only get their own
strokes critiqued, but learn from
watching each other's videos,"
Kenney said.
The sailing camp, though still
in its infancy, piloted a one-week,
combined crew and sailing camp
with director of rowing Craig
Amerkhanian.
"It was a huge success and we'll
continue it in the future, as well as
offer a higher level racing camp,"
Gross said.
The coaches aren't (he only ones
looking forward to next summer.
"I'd come back in a heartbeat,"
said 18-year-old Murrow enthusi
astically. "If I was nine, I'd go
everv vear until I was 18."
