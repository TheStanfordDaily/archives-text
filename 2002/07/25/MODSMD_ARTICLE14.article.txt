# Triathlon team sends lucky three to France
## 
### TERRY HURLBUTT EDITORIAL STAFF 
A swim, a run or a bike ride â€”
most people consider doing one, or
none, of the above in any singular
workout.
And then there are the triath
letes.
These ambitious individuals
combine all three activities into one
grueling test of strength and en
durance that definitely separates the
endorphin-addicted from the rest of
the world.
Stanford is the training ground
to some of the nation's and the
world's most talented triathletes
with its club team sending three
members to the World Champi
onships, which will be held in France
in September.
Senior Katya Meyers, medical
student Megan Fix and Eric Bean, a
master's student in Mechanical En
gineering, will travel to Nice to com
pete in a 4000-meter swim, a 130-
kilometer hike ride (78 miles) and a
30-km run (18.6 miles).
Both Meyers and Fix qualified
after finishing iti the top-15 at the
Pacific Crest 1/2 Ironman with times
0f4:59:40 and 4:59:50 respectively.
Bean, who competes profession
ally, impressed the USA Triathlon

committee, which is in charge of
choosing the six men and six women
to represent the country in the pro
fessional category, with his past ex
perience and success.
Attaining such a level of competi
tion is the direct result of an exhaus
tive and effective training schedule
that often resembling something out
of Dante's "Inferno."
A typical week involves intense
training Tuesday through Sunday.
Weekdays see combinations of hik
ing, swimming and running, usually
for about three hours. The week
ends are strictly for the hard-of
heart.
On Saturdays, while the majority
of the campus community catches
up on a few desperately needed
hours of sleep, the triathletes hit the
hills on their hikes for upwards of
five to six hours.
On Sundays, again before most
of us even dream of waking, they
pull on their running shoes for long
and arduous runs, thus bringing
new meaning to the word dedica
tion.
Fix, who must also balance the
demands of medical school, finds re
lief in her workouts.
"Triathlon has been so much
fun," Fix said. "It's a wonderful
mental break for me from medical

school."
Bean, who also serves as the Stan
ford triathlon coach, expects the
training to increase in preparation
for France.
"Both of these athletes will also
start to do a variety of bike-run
workouts to simulate World Cham
pionships, and some swim-bike-run
workouts as well: 2000-meter swim,
60-70 mile bike, one-hour run - and
also practice descending on the hike
fast down the mountains to improve
that skill, which is a necessity for the
Nice course," said Bean.
"Their longest day leading up to
World's will he eight or more hours
of training."
While only three members are
headed to the World Champi
onships, the Stanford team, which
boasts over 41 members, finished
fourth in the collegiate champi
onships this year and hopes to im
prove its standings in the near fu
ture.
"As a team we seek to win Nation
al Championships," Bean said.
"Outside of competition, we want to
promote the sport of triathlon to the
Stanford community and promote
collegiate triathlon nationally."
While the workout schedule
might seem daunting to the uniniti
ated, in actuality, the team is ex

tremely accommodating.
"We're very relaxed about atten
dance and participation," said ju
nior captain Julia Nelson. "There's
no pressure. The team understands
the stresses of Stanford, and each
person participates to their ability
level and capacity, given their time
commitments."
In addition to training, the team
also undertakes fundraising efforts
to collect the necessary money to
send the three members to France.
"We are doing a one-day
triathlon camp in conjunction with
the All-Sports camp to raise about a
fourth of the money we need lor the
trip," Bean said.
"Additionally, we may do an ex
tended triathlon camp in late Au
gust."
vMI this preparation will culmi
nate at the World Championships
where these Cardinal athletes will
put themselves against the some of
the most outstanding athletes in the
world.
"It is such a wonderful opportu
nity to travel to France to represent
the USA," Fix said. "That is a goal I
never dreamed that I would have,
let alone accomplish. And now that it
is happening, my goal is to enjoy the
trip, the journey, my team and do
my best in Nice."
