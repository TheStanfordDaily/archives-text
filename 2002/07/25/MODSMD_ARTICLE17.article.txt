## Powers loses mojo, 'Gold' is a no-go 
### RAMIN SETOODEH EDITORIALS STAFF 
To say that "Austin Powers in Goldmem
ber" never climaxes is an understatement.
In his third time around, the international
man of mystery returns without a luscious
heroine to rescue or a new comedic path to
pursue. He is, in short, a character without a
mission—brought back as a masturbatory
remembrance of two prior films that re
launched actor Mike Myers's career after the
not-so-loved comedy, "So 1 Married an Axe
Murderer."

So ilie franchise is feeling flaccid now; that
doesn't mean "Goldmember" doesn't have
some charm.
The first two films prided themselves on
sexual innuendoes and pointed double en
tendres. As vehicles that mocked the spy
thriller genre, they took their shots at the
babe-on-each-arm action hero played by Sean
Connery and known to swooning girls of the
'60s as Bond: James Bond.
But the very naughty Austin Powers, as
played by Myers, was nothing more than a
extended "Saturday Night Live" caricature
— with chest hair pasted over his buttoned

down disco shirt — poking fun of the secret
agent's promiscuous bedside manners.
What made the films a guilty pleasure, then,
was (he inspired voracity in which Myers
played not only Powers but his arch neme
sis, Dr. Evil, and also, in episode two, the
hefty henchman Fat Bastard.
They are all back in "Goldmember"
and so are Dr. Evil's two sons — the first,
biological (Seth Green), and the second, a
miniature clone called Mini-Me (Verne

Troyer). The female sidekick this time is
Foxxy Cleopatra, played by Beyonce
Knowles with fine comedic precision.
(She is more self-assured than previous
Powers women: Elizabeth Hurley in the
original installment and Heather Graham
in I he second).
Part of the problem with "Goldmeinber"
is the disconnected plot, which hinges on

BEHAVING BADLY: Mike Myers stars as Austin Powers in the fourth installment of the spoof
movies. This time around, Beyonce Knowles plays his flirtatious sidekick Foxxy Cleopatra.
