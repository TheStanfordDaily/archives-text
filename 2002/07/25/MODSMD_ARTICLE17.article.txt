## Powers loses mojo, 'Gold' is a no-go 
### RAMIN SETOODEH EDITORIALS STAFF 
To say that "Austin Powers in Goldmem
ber" never climaxes is an understatement.
In his third time around, the international
man of mystery returns without a luscious
heroine to rescue or a new comedic path to
pursue. He is, in short, a character without a
mission—brought back as a masturbatory
remembrance of two prior films that re
launched actor Mike Myers's career after the
not-so-loved comedy, "So 1 Married an Axe
Murderer."

So ilie franchise is feeling flaccid now; that
doesn't mean "Goldmember" doesn't have
some charm.
The first two films prided themselves on
sexual innuendoes and pointed double en
tendres. As vehicles that mocked the spy
thriller genre, they took their shots at the
babe-on-each-arm action hero played by Sean
Connery and known to swooning girls of the
'60s as Bond: James Bond.
But the very naughty Austin Powers, as
played by Myers, was nothing more than a
extended "Saturday Night Live" caricature
— with chest hair pasted over his buttoned

down disco shirt — poking fun of the secret
agent's promiscuous bedside manners.
What made the films a guilty pleasure, then,
was (he inspired voracity in which Myers
played not only Powers but his arch neme
sis, Dr. Evil, and also, in episode two, the
hefty henchman Fat Bastard.
They are all back in "Goldmember"
and so are Dr. Evil's two sons — the first,
biological (Seth Green), and the second, a
miniature clone called Mini-Me (Verne

Troyer). The female sidekick this time is
Foxxy Cleopatra, played by Beyonce
Knowles with fine comedic precision.
(She is more self-assured than previous
Powers women: Elizabeth Hurley in the
original installment and Heather Graham
in I he second).
Part of the problem with "Goldmeinber"
is the disconnected plot, which hinges on

BEHAVING BADLY: Mike Myers stars as Austin Powers in the fourth installment of the spoof
movies. This time around, Beyonce Knowles plays his flirtatious sidekick Foxxy Cleopatra.
impotent flashback scenes more
often than it should. Powers must
travel back and forth in time to
save his father, Nigel (Michael
Caine), from the evil Goldmem
ber (played by Myers in his
fourth-billed role), a villain who
through some undisclosed
method replaces the genitalia of
men with gold.
Myers's performance as Gold
member is deft and convincing, so
much so that the actor is almost
unrecognizable in make-up. But
Goldmember, as a villain, is not
painted in the same layers of depth
and humor as Dr. Evil or Mini-Me
— both of whom spent too much
of the film locked away in a maxi
mum security prison.
But more problematic is the fact
that Austin Powers, the character,
has almost outworn his welcome.
The first film relied on the fish
out-of-water premise and sent
Powers, a spy from the '60s, to the
19905. In I lie second film, Powers
returned to the past and the days
of disco. By "Goldmember," Pow
ers has been back to the future and
back again; the secret agent clearly
has nowhere left to go.
"Austin Powers 3" is not as
inane or empty as "Men in Black
II," which is intended as a compli
ment — alt hough the same can be
said for most other films released
in the past month.

The opening scene of the film is
as inventive as any other in the
franchise and features splendid
cameos from Tom Cruise,
Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey
and Danny DeVito. It is one of the
self-referential, bitingly ironic mo
ments that one always hopes for in
a parody; revealing any more
would be revealing too much, but
it ends with an Oscar-brandishing
Steven Spielberg who exclaims:
"The opening credits are always
the best part." Rarely has a film
been so adept at describing itself .
Almost as pleasant are the song
and dance numbers dispersed
throughout the story line. There is
something intelligently surreal,
and almost magical, about Myers
boogieing down a vacant street
alongside a band of back-up
dancers dressed in '70s attire. The
choreography is hip and fun, and
will inspire a smile on even the
most cantankerous viewer.
The biggest mystery of the
movie, however, is that Austin
Powers does not shag a single
woman, British or otherwise, in
"Goldmember." This is odd, con
sidering the other films have al
ways found laughs in Powers's
after-hours escapades.
The closest he comes to a sexual
encounter is at the beginning, dur
ing some intense flirting with two
Asian American twins named Fook
Mi and Fook Yu. The scene bor
ders on giddy comedy, but is inter
rupted prematurely. It's symbolic
of the entire film: 97-minutes of
foreplay without a payoff...
