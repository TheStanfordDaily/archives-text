If you're reading this, odds are
that you're older than the target au

younger than the chaperones of
said audience.
But don't be so skeptical.
"Stuart Little 2" isn't that bad. In

"Stuart Little" was targeted solely at
the younger audience, it is clear the
sequel — a true family picture —
has learned from the mistakes of
the first. (It is also fortunate that,
unlike some other recent movies,
seeing the original movie is not vital
to understanding the sequel.)
In the three years since the first
movie, computer graphics have im
proved greatly, and the movie cer
tainly takes advantage. The promi
nence of the celebrities who voiced
the three computer-enhanced
characters has also risen. Reprising
their roles, Michael J. Fox ("Spin
City") stars as Stuart Little, while
Nathan Lane ("The Producers") is
the voice of Snowball the family cat,
and the city of New York itself.

HIGH GLIDING: The animated Stuart Little (voiced by Michael J. Fox)
returns in a sequel that is more accessible than the first film.
