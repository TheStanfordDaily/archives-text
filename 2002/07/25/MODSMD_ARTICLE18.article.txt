"Stuart Little" was targeted solely at
the younger audience, it is clear the
sequel — a true family picture —
has learned from the mistakes of
the first. (It is also fortunate that,
unlike some other recent movies,
seeing the original movie is not vital
to understanding the sequel.)
In the three years since the first
movie, computer graphics have im
proved greatly, and the movie cer
tainly takes advantage. The promi
nence of the celebrities who voiced
the three computer-enhanced
characters has also risen. Reprising
their roles, Michael J. Fox ("Spin
City") stars as Stuart Little, while
Nathan Lane ("The Producers") is
the voice of Snowball the family cat,
and the city of New York itself.

HIGH GLIDING: The animated Stuart Little (voiced by Michael J. Fox)
returns in a sequel that is more accessible than the first film.
Granted, there is a problem with
the opening scene in which Stuart is
involved in a soccer game with peers
10 times as high, it's a hit of a stretch.
The scene is supposed to emphasize
the obvious fact that Stuart is often
left out of childhood social activities
due to his size, but it's more ridicu
lous than anything else.
From there, disbelief is suspend
ed and the movie works.
Actually, it soars on the wings of
canary Margalo (voiced by Melanie
Griffith). She quite literally drops
out of the sky, and, Stuart — who is
lonely due to his declining social
life — eagerly saves her from a fal
con (voiced by James Woods). Stu
art gets a friend and an adventure
all in the same day. Happy ending?
Not yet. To say more would spoil
the plot, which is filled with sur
prise and gleeful subplots that con
nect in the end.
"Stuart Little 2" is filled with

humor and action, and pulls ofF
enough adventure to keep view
ers of all ages entertained. Lane,
as expected, gets most of the
laughs. The human actors in the
Little family (Geena Davis, Hugh
Laurie and Jonathan Lipnicki) are
also back with smarter dialogue
than before. Their roles are large
ly two-dimensional and reactive,
and they nicely leave room for the
animated Stuart to work his
magic.
There are also some tender
scenes, as touching as in the first
movie but not quite as artificial. The
platonic love between mouse and
bird somehow seems more believ
able than between mouse and
human. Inter-species love (and no,
not the kind that results in baby
mules) wins out.
The first "Stuart Little" hit home
the message that families are made
up of people who love one another,
as different as they might be. To this,
the second includes the adage that
loving someone often means loving
him or her enough to set them free.
At least until the next sequel.
