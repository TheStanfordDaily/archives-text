Eight Legged Freaks
irtttrC?
This shallow special effects-driven
movie is about a small town in Ari
zona where, after a chemical spill,
spiders mutate into gigantic, man-killing
beasts.
Obviously, the movie needs a hero.
The more goofy, the better. Enter prodi
gal son, Chris McCormack (David Ar
quette), who has returned home to his
long pined-after love, Sheriff Sam Parker
(Kari Wuhrer). Will he get together with
her? Will he not? Will the spiders eat
them both to make it all stop!
Spider bites are painful, but not as
painful as Arquette doing Romeo. He's
much, much better doing what he does
best — making his 'scared to death' face
and running, which he also does a bit.
Capitalizing on your strong suit is rarely
a bad thing.
A perfect example of this is the short
comical performance turned in by stand
up comedian Rick Overton in the role of
bumbling Deputy Pete. It works.
If you're willing to sit through some
mediocrity and audience pandering in
order to get the occasional flashes of
comic success, 1 recommend the film.
Don't expect brilliance, just expect to
laugh, both with the movie and at it.

Road to Perdition
****
Sam Mendes's first film since "Ameri
can Beauty" has been marketed as a
traditional tale about gangsters. But
it's not a gangster movie, not really anyway.
At the core of the film is Tom Hanks in
one of the best performances of his ca
reer. That is a phrase that movie critics
like to use often. But Tom Hanks, who
has won two Academy Awards, is always
expected to be good. What is surprising
in "Perdition" is how good he actually is.
Hanks stars as Michael Sullivan, a
man who works for the mob. His boss,
John Rooney (Paul Newman), can be vi
cious and uncompromising, but acts as a
father figure to him. There is a murder.
Then two more and Michael is forced to
flee with his son (Tyler Hoechlin) to the
town of Perdition where he hopes they
can find refuge.
The movie is at times quiet and con
templative, and at other times very vio
lent. But the violence in the movie
works to advance the story line, not to
interfere with it.
The deaths in "Perdition" are por
trayed as cold and unflinching, as they
should be, and Sam Mendes has a gift for
building tension and releasing it at pre
cisely the right moment.

Sunshine State
★★★<?
At first, the movie seems like a biting
commentary about the war be
tween small town folks and evil big
business Director John Sayles makes no
effort to convince lis that his film will be
about anything else.
But that's not the case. "Sunshine State"
is a character-driven story about people,
their complex lives and relationships and
how they adapt and change.
There are two main communities in
the film: Delrona Reach, populated by
white small business owners and retirees,
and Lincoln Beach, a long time commu
nity for black residents. The characters
we spend the most time with are single
small business owner Marly (Edie Falco
of "The Sopranos") and Desiree (Angela
Bassett), a woman who has returned with
new her husband (James McDaniel) to
visit her mother after leaving the town
when she was 15 years old. We follow
each of the two main characters in two
parallel story lines.
"Sunshine State" runs at an intimidat
ing 150 minutes, but Sayles makes it
work. And the talented cast, especially
Bassett and Falco, provide a welcome al
ternative to the usual summer block
buster.

K-l 9: The Widowmaker
irtrCrti
Well, it's not as bad as it sounds.
"K-l9: The Widowmaker" is
crippled by a terrible title, but it
still manages to be sporadically enter
taining and even, on occasion, quite
moving.
The film, directed by Kathryn Bigelow,
is set in 1961. Mikhail Polenin (Liam Nee
son), the commander of the Soviet flagship
submarine K-19, is removed from his post
for not preparing the vessel quickly enough
for its test run. He is replaced by Alexei
Vostrikov (Harrison Ford), a hard-driving
captain whose father was executed in the
Gulag. The submarine leaves port on sched
ule, but then its nuclear reactor springs a
leak near a NATO base. A core meltdown
could cause the warheads on K-l9 to deto
nate, which would lead to World War 111.
The story brims with heroism and
tragedy, yet it makes so many mistakes in
telling this tale that its inherent dramatic
power only shines occasionally. Worse
still is the execrable score by Klaus
Badelt. He insists on turning the volume
up on every single emotion, drowning
even the film's best sequences in annoy
ing bombast.
"K-19" doesn't sink, but the voyage
isn't as worthwhile as it could be.

comical performance turned in by stand
up comedian Rick Overton in the role of
bumbling Deputy Pete. It works.
If you're willing to sit through some
mediocrity and audience pandering in
order to get the occasional flashes of
comic success, 1 recommend the film.
Don't expect brilliance, just expect to
laugh, both with the movie and at it.

Road to Perdition
****
Sam Mendes's first film since "Ameri
can Beauty" has been marketed as a
traditional tale about gangsters. But
it's not a gangster movie, not really anyway.
At the core of the film is Tom Hanks in
one of the best performances of his ca
reer. That is a phrase that movie critics
like to use often. But Tom Hanks, who
has won two Academy Awards, is always
expected to be good. What is surprising
in "Perdition" is how good he actually is.
Hanks stars as Michael Sullivan, a
man who works for the mob. His boss,
John Rooney (Paul Newman), can be vi
cious and uncompromising, but acts as a
father figure to him. There is a murder.
Then two more and Michael is forced to
flee with his son (Tyler Hoechlin) to the
town of Perdition where he hopes they
can find refuge.
The movie is at times quiet and con
templative, and at other times very vio
lent. But the violence in the movie
works to advance the story line, not to
interfere with it.
The deaths in "Perdition" are por
trayed as cold and unflinching, as they
should be, and Sam Mendes has a gift for
building tension and releasing it at pre
cisely the right moment.

Sunshine State
★★★<?
At first, the movie seems like a biting
commentary about the war be
tween small town folks and evil big
business Director John Sayles makes no
effort to convince lis that his film will be
about anything else.
But that's not the case. "Sunshine State"
is a character-driven story about people,
their complex lives and relationships and
how they adapt and change.
There are two main communities in
the film: Delrona Reach, populated by
white small business owners and retirees,
and Lincoln Beach, a long time commu
nity for black residents. The characters
we spend the most time with are single
small business owner Marly (Edie Falco
of "The Sopranos") and Desiree (Angela
Bassett), a woman who has returned with
new her husband (James McDaniel) to
visit her mother after leaving the town
when she was 15 years old. We follow
each of the two main characters in two
parallel story lines.
"Sunshine State" runs at an intimidat
ing 150 minutes, but Sayles makes it
work. And the talented cast, especially
Bassett and Falco, provide a welcome al
ternative to the usual summer block
buster.

K-l 9: The Widowmaker
irtrCrti
Well, it's not as bad as it sounds.
"K-l9: The Widowmaker" is
crippled by a terrible title, but it
still manages to be sporadically enter
taining and even, on occasion, quite
moving.
The film, directed by Kathryn Bigelow,
is set in 1961. Mikhail Polenin (Liam Nee
son), the commander of the Soviet flagship
submarine K-19, is removed from his post
for not preparing the vessel quickly enough
for its test run. He is replaced by Alexei
Vostrikov (Harrison Ford), a hard-driving
captain whose father was executed in the
Gulag. The submarine leaves port on sched
ule, but then its nuclear reactor springs a
leak near a NATO base. A core meltdown
could cause the warheads on K-l9 to deto
nate, which would lead to World War 111.
The story brims with heroism and
tragedy, yet it makes so many mistakes in
telling this tale that its inherent dramatic
power only shines occasionally. Worse
still is the execrable score by Klaus
Badelt. He insists on turning the volume
up on every single emotion, drowning
even the film's best sequences in annoy
ing bombast.
"K-19" doesn't sink, but the voyage
isn't as worthwhile as it could be.
