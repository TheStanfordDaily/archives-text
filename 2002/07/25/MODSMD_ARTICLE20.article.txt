# Roxy Sass tries her hand at the job
## 
### 
First things first: Big, sloppy
thank-yous to all the Roxy read
ers who checked in to make sure
Ms. Sass hadn't retired to greener
pastures after her absence last
week. Actually, it was quite the op
posite. Starved for the stuff that
truly sexy columns are made of, I
decided to take a break from the
business of column-writing and
throw myself, headfirst, into the
rigors of research.
For all of you gutter-rats (and I
love you), we'll discuss the physi
cal aspects of said research when I
think you're good and ready, but,
today, I felt I had to comment on
a surprising discovery 1 made last
week. Reading through the Aug.,
2002, issue of Glamour (remem
ber: it's "research"), 1 stumbled
across what I soon identified as
one of the few subjects able to
drive normal college men to im
passioned debate — namely, the
hand job.
One studly Glamour intervie
wee, in a piece titled "59 Sexy
Things He Wants You to Know
About His Body," is quoted as say
ing, "I think whoever invented
hand jobs should be shot." This
vehement denouncement under
standably piqued my curiosity,
and I was motivated to some in
formal polling. The very eloquent
explanation from a good (male,
self-proclaimed sexpert) friend:
"Girls are wet." [Pregnant pause.]
"Boys are dry."
So why all the fuss? It seems that
for as long as hopeful men have
been urging reluctant heads to
ward tumescent penises, demure
women have been substituting will

ing hands for wetter techniques. Of
course, we think we're being clever
(mind you, this is a very loosely de
fined "we"; the men who have
melted in Ms. Sass's hands are a tes
tament to her talent, not her in
tent). After all, he came, and isn't
that what we're after here?
Ladies, ladies, ladies. Fora
group of people who know how
easy it is to fake it, and how hard it
is to stop once you start or, heaven
forfend, talk about it, it shouldn't
be too difficult to understand how
your seemingly satisfied counter
parts might actually be dying for
something different. Just because
he can come at the drop of a hat —
and does, despite your fingers
doing their (likely unlubricated)
best to stop him—doesn't mean he
favors your methods of getting him
to that oh-so-cute collapse.
But where to go from there? As
many an indignant man has told
me in the last few days (looking for
an exciting evening, girls? Walk up
to a guy in a bar and tell him you're
interested in his opinion on hand
jobs...), pretty much anything
you're planning to do to him with
your hands, he's already done to
himself. Countless times. To much
better fantasies.
As one 26-year-old San Jose in
vestment banker put it, at the end
of the day, he doesn't really need
the extra hand, so he might as well
save the cash he would have spent
on her dinner and spring fora
much cheaper date with Jeanine
instead.
The key to satisfaction, then, no
matter how you eventually decide
to please your man, is to make the

experience distinct and memo
rable, for the right reasons. If you
must stroke him into submission
(and I understand; if you must, you
must), then be sure to use the prop
er lubrication, get a very good han
dle on angle, grip and speed before
you get a handle on him, and think
of creative ways to spice it up.
And if you're too squeamish
for that kind of planning — i.e.
you're holding him at a distance
and trying your best not to see,
smell or feel him — you might
want to take a break from the
bedroom and reconsider your
readiness altogether.
Similarly, for you la/.y types
who'd just rather get him there and
roll over, minus the mess, remem
ber that when you're writing your
"he won't go down on me" letter.
We must give to receive.
And, guys, don't think you're
getting off scot-free, either. J list be
cause women seem to be a little
more evenly split on the digit vs.
tongue debate doesn't mean you
can just take the easy route. Ask the
right questions, and she'll definite
ly want to return the favor.
The bottom line: Love the
penis. Whether you want it in your
mouth or in your hand, or you just
want to hold the hand it's indirect
ly attached to, giving it the atten
tion that it deserves never has to be
a chore. And, as long as it doesn't
condemn you to eternal damna
tion or some such thing, the next
time you're about to go mano-a
member, it might be worth it to lit
erally suck it up and try something
new. Trust Ms. Sass here; she
knows.

hand job.
One studly Glamour intervie
wee, in a piece titled "59 Sexy
Things He Wants You to Know
About His Body," is quoted as say
ing, "I think whoever invented
hand jobs should be shot." This
vehement denouncement under
standably piqued my curiosity,
and I was motivated to some in
formal polling. The very eloquent
explanation from a good (male,
self-proclaimed sexpert) friend:
"Girls are wet." [Pregnant pause.]
"Boys are dry."
So why all the fuss? It seems that
for as long as hopeful men have
been urging reluctant heads to
ward tumescent penises, demure
women have been substituting will

ing hands for wetter techniques. Of
course, we think we're being clever
(mind you, this is a very loosely de
fined "we"; the men who have
melted in Ms. Sass's hands are a tes
tament to her talent, not her in
tent). After all, he came, and isn't
that what we're after here?
Ladies, ladies, ladies. Fora
group of people who know how
easy it is to fake it, and how hard it
is to stop once you start or, heaven
forfend, talk about it, it shouldn't
be too difficult to understand how
your seemingly satisfied counter
parts might actually be dying for
something different. Just because
he can come at the drop of a hat —
and does, despite your fingers
doing their (likely unlubricated)
best to stop him—doesn't mean he
favors your methods of getting him
to that oh-so-cute collapse.
But where to go from there? As
many an indignant man has told
me in the last few days (looking for
an exciting evening, girls? Walk up
to a guy in a bar and tell him you're
interested in his opinion on hand
jobs...), pretty much anything
you're planning to do to him with
your hands, he's already done to
himself. Countless times. To much
better fantasies.
As one 26-year-old San Jose in
vestment banker put it, at the end
of the day, he doesn't really need
the extra hand, so he might as well
save the cash he would have spent
on her dinner and spring fora
much cheaper date with Jeanine
instead.
The key to satisfaction, then, no
matter how you eventually decide
to please your man, is to make the

experience distinct and memo
rable, for the right reasons. If you
must stroke him into submission
(and I understand; if you must, you
must), then be sure to use the prop
er lubrication, get a very good han
dle on angle, grip and speed before
you get a handle on him, and think
of creative ways to spice it up.
And if you're too squeamish
for that kind of planning — i.e.
you're holding him at a distance
and trying your best not to see,
smell or feel him — you might
want to take a break from the
bedroom and reconsider your
readiness altogether.
Similarly, for you la/.y types
who'd just rather get him there and
roll over, minus the mess, remem
ber that when you're writing your
"he won't go down on me" letter.
We must give to receive.
And, guys, don't think you're
getting off scot-free, either. J list be
cause women seem to be a little
more evenly split on the digit vs.
tongue debate doesn't mean you
can just take the easy route. Ask the
right questions, and she'll definite
ly want to return the favor.
The bottom line: Love the
penis. Whether you want it in your
mouth or in your hand, or you just
want to hold the hand it's indirect
ly attached to, giving it the atten
tion that it deserves never has to be
a chore. And, as long as it doesn't
condemn you to eternal damna
tion or some such thing, the next
time you're about to go mano-a
member, it might be worth it to lit
erally suck it up and try something
new. Trust Ms. Sass here; she
knows.
