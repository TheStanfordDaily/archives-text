"Waking Life," a mind-bending animated feature from
Richard Linklater, alternates between innovative brilliance and
mind-numbing pretension, but its combination of beautiful im
agery with rambling, didactic dialogue is impossible to forget.
The film consists of loose vignettes: talkative, (pseudo-) intellectu-

als lecture the nameless protagonist (Wiley
Wiggins) on topics like existentialism, evo
lution and the corporate-controlled state.
Interspersed with the dialogues are shots
of Wiggins wandering through the city —
sometimes walking, sometimes flying.
If this all sounds immensely boring, it
often is. The film's resistance to traditional
narrative can be frustrating.
"Waking Life" is almost entirely a cere
bral movie, a 99-minute discussion of the
nature of consciousness. Some ideas feel
underdeveloped and sophomoric, like
late-night rant sessions with 110 direction,
but they are delivered with style. The ver-

bal pyrotechnics hit a high point with Speed Levitch's monologue on
the Brooklyn Bridge, in which he declares, "And on really romantic
evenings of self, I go salsa dancing with my confusion!"
More importantly, "Waking Life" is absolutely gorgeous. A live
action cut of the movie, first created on digital video, was used as
the basis for the animation. Even the most mundane lecture holds
a visual treat: For example, Caveh Zahedi's discussion of Andre
Bazin's theories of film is illustrated as a movie within a movie.
The DVD has several special features. By far the most interesting is
a sampling of scenes from the live-action cut of "Waking Life." In ad
dition to the fun of seeing what the actors "really look like," it makes
one realize how important the animation is to the film — words and
images are both essential to the haunting power of "Waking Life."
