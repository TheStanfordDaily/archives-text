# 'Street' leads to strong tunes
## 
### KAREEM GHANEM STAFF WRITER 
For most music listeners, Nir
vana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit" is
synonymous with gnarled guitar
distortion. Similarly, current pop
favorites Weezer built a career out
of a penchant fora fuzzy, disci
plined musical racket. Ultimately,
both bands owe their legacies, in
part at least, to Sonic Youth.
Alter all, Sonic Youth is the
band that perfected and harnessed
the cacophonous din of guitar
feedback in rock 'n' roll songs. An
interesting irony may explain why
large mainstream audiences have
yet to catch on to the longtime
New York heroes.
As one critic wrote of the band,
the more it abandons its roots in
avant-garde experimentalism for
traditional song structures, the
more likely it is to appeal to a wider
audience.
Of course, such a move also en
tails a loss of what made Sonic
Youth so inventive and interesting
in the first place.
"Murray Street," Sonic Youth's
latest effort, manages to balance
the artfully clamorous excursions
that the band is known for with a

degree of accessibility that keeps
the album from becoming self-in
dulgent. Though it's unlikely that
"Murray Street" will sell near the
top of the Billboard charts, it is
both remarkably faithful to the
band's roots in New York post
punk, no-wave music and an ex
cellent introduction for those new
to the band.
Named after the Manhattan
street on which the group's
recording studio is situated, "Mur
ray Street" is at times both confus
ing and exhilarating.
The album's first three tracks
are catchy in a way that evokes pre
vious releases such as the band's
seminal late-'Bos record, "Day
dream Nation," and singer
Thurston Moore's laid-back drawl
evokes the anthemic "Teenage
Riot."
"Disconnection Notice," the
second song, twists an eclectic gui
tar riff to sound almost like a cello.
Despite this sort of effect, the track
remains pleasantly hummable.
Perhaps hinting at the Sept. 11
calamity, Moore sings, "This is no
direction / Prepare the city / Angels
turn on heaven's light," which is
certainly reasonable considering
that an engine from one of the hi

jacked airplanes (ell on the real-life
"Murray Street" during the attacks
and that the New York City Police
Department cordoned off the
street for some time.
"Rain On Tin" maintains a re
freshing, musical structure that
shows off the group's ability to
weave tight, disciplined tunes that
are as mesmerizing as its all-out
noise sessions.
The 11-minute "Karen Revis
ited" begins as a beautiful lyrical
return to a confused, bruised
character from the older Sonic
Youth song "Tunic (Song for
Karen)," but slowly descends into
an ethereal, twinkling, atmos
pheric haze of guitar blips and
cooing feedback. It then pro
ceeds to transform once again
into a frightening wall of pound
ing noise before exiting in near
silence.
Equally schizophrenic is the
two-minute "Plastic Sun," one of
just two tracks featuring band
member Kim Gordon on vocals.
With bitter, confused, angry lyrics
layered over a guitar attack that
sounds like the sirens of an on
coming train, Gordon maintains a
surprising and unsettling sexiness
in her voice when she warns,

"Watch your back or you're dead
meat baby / Throw the dog a bone
and you still get rabies."
After nearly two decades at the
forefront of musical innovation,
Sonic Youth has yet to disappoint.
"Murray Street" even features
some saxophone work at one point
— an idea that would have been

unthinkable for the band even a
few years ago. While it's clear the
band will not soon abandon the in
novation on which its reputation is
staked, it's equally clear that "Mur
ray Street" is a great place to get
started if you're looking fora hip
rock 'n' roll record that also chal
lenges your conventions.
