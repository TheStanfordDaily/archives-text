# 'Lips' album, a flaming hit
## 
### PETER KAZANJY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The hottest thing about the Flaming Lips has always
been their name. Their music is best described with a
cooler, calmer tone.
While they may not be all that sizzling, the Lips
are best known for their sonic depth and scope. And
the best thing about their latest cut, "Yoshimi Battles
the Pink Robots," is their brave new foray into the
land of the electronic.

"The Soft Bul
letin" (1999) still
sets the mark by
which all their
music should be
measured, and
"Yoshimi" doesn't
exactly challenge it.
Instead, it branches
out from the path
set by "Bulletin."
Clearly Coyne
and company have
done their fair
share of listening to
"Kid A" and others
in preparation for
this one, with stellar
results. Coyne's
Oklahoma drawl
still floats in and out
of the tracks airily,
and the Lips
haven't forgotten
how to layer guitars
with the best of
them.
But the previous
slamming (drum-

mer Steven Drozd rocks so hard, his headphones typi
cally have to be taped down) has been replaced by
drum and bass snare loops.
This melding is the key to the whole album, with
what made the Lips great before mixing deliciously
with what makes them great now.
A perfect case in point is the warm strumming
acoustic guitar at the beginning of "Yoshimi Battles the

Pink Robots Pt. 1."
Just as you think you're hearing another round of
the same old acoustic intros, the guitar cuts out like
a record when the power is out. It may be the first
time a DJ's transition move has been applied to an
acoustic guitar, and it sounds great. The guitar is
tweaked, resampled, slowed, sped up and all-around
played with, making the title track one of the
strongest on the album.
Other strong points include "In the Morning of the
Magicians," which switches back-and-forth between

two seemingly
disparate, but
in the end com
plement a r y
sub-songs. It
too shows us
exactly what
great things
can come of the
Lips's new
blend, with
tracks one,
three and five
exemplifying
the newer style.
Meanwhile,
songs two and
four retaining
the spacey,
soothing feel of
"Bulletin."
Props to
Drozd's drum
ming that mas
terfully sup
ports both
styles.
In fact,
props to all the

members of the Flaming Lips, whose work seems to
only get more involved and important with time.
This album, like "The Soft Bulletin" and "Zareika"
before it (if you haven't heard the latter, do yourself
a favor and do so immediately), will only reward re
peated listens, both casually in the car and intently
under headphones. Verdict: Worth whatever Tower
may be charging, but currently on sale at Borders.
