# BIG BROTHER 3 watch
## 
### 
In the third week of "Big Brother 3," things
heated up considerably. And we're not just talking
about what was cookin' in the kitchen.
Here's what happened:
THURSDAY, JULY 18. The first "live" episode
of the season proved to be as dazzling as we had
hoped. Host Julie Chen demonstrated, beyond
reasonable doubt, that she is even less capable as a
journalist than Geraldo Rivera.
First, her earpiece didn't function properly and
she couldn't hear the houseguests inside the well-in
sulated studio. But she covered up the snafu nicely
by exclaiming to them, "I can't read your lips!"
Well played.
Then later, she misidentified the houseguests
who were eliminated from the Head of Household

competition. But she also handled
the mishap like a pro by saying,
"I'm having eye problems tonight."
Who is she trying to be: the
Helen Keller of game show hosts?
Meanwhile, back in the house,
the first evictee of the game was
decided. By a razor-thin 5-4 tally,
Lori was voted out (as we predict
ed) over Amy, the ex-beauty

pageant contestant who loves cheese. She then
hugged the rest of the houseguests (through
clenched teeth) before making her exit.
What awaited Lori in the outside world was
rather painful: a 5-minute interview with Chen.
Let's say the questions could have been better
asked by a Muppet with a tele-prompter.
The night ended with an inane Head of House
hold competition that brought a twist of Shake
spearean proportions to the house. The winner?
Marcellus, the gay stylist who was nominated for
eviction last week. There hasn't been a comeback
this big since singer-turned-mother Celine Dion re
leased her latest album, "A New Day Has Come."
SATURDAY, JULY 20. Disturbed by the fact
that no one in the house had shed his clothes for the
last 15 minutes, Amy announced that the house
guests should have a make-your-own-bathing-suit
beauty pageant. The suggestion was met with
cheers from all, especially the viewers at home.
The girls went first and spent hours putting to
gether bikini tops made of flowers. When they real
ized that the flowers would not stick, they decided to
use peanut butter as an adhesive. Martha Stewart

would have been proud, especially since they also
used the peanut butter to cover their torso regions.
Unfortunately, the peanut butter started to melt
— which shocked Jason, the videographer and self
proclaimed virgin from Mobile, Alab., who appar
ently has never seen the female body naked before.
Then it turned to the guys, who weren't as crafty
or as creative. Jason and Gerry wrapped themselves
in toilet paper (for the record, it was un-used). We
would also describe how Roddy and Eric dressed
themselves, but we still can't tell them apart. (The In-

ternet fans tell us that Eric, the lire
fighter, looks more like an ape. But
Roddy, the brains of the house,
looks equally monkey-ish to us.)
And speaking of Monkey Busi
ness, Eric and Chiara (the house
guest with the DUI — don't they
screen these folks?) seem to be
sharing some serious bed space. Is
it lust at first sight? You betcha.

The episode ended with the toughest decision of
Marcellas's life. He needed to decide which two
houseguests to nominate for eviction. His choices?
Josh, the waiter from Long Island, N.Y., who has
clearly has a problem with honesty, and Tonya, the
single mother who had breast implants five weeks
before entering the house.
Looks like she's sprung a leak.
JULY 24. Last night, the shenanigans in the
house continued to escalate. Josh used Marcellas's
electric razor to shave his chest hair; this brought
many cries of disgust from Marcellas who said he
"sterilizes" everything. He then proceeded to ster
ilize the razor, but was still upset because it had
Josh's "bad karma" on it.
The episode proved fortuitous, however, for
Danielle, who won both the Veto Competition and
the Human Bowling Competition.
The first victory allowed her to veto one of the
nominees (she chose not to), and the second al
lowed her to select the exercise equipment for the
house (she chose cardiovascular equipment).
We're guessing that her luck will change very soon.
OUR PREDICTION. Logic would tell us that
Josh, the meanest member of the house, is the next
to go. But this is "Big Brother 3" where logic loses
every time (the houseguests probably couldn't even
add their IQ scores together).
Josh has already rallied a lot of houseguests
against Tonya: Roddy and Eric (apparently he can
tell them apart), as well as Jason, Amy and Danielle.
That's five, and all he needs to stay in the house.
And we haven't even taken into consideration the
swing vote from Lisa.
We might be wrong, but we're going to predict
that Tonya is leaving the house. Her motto: "Life is
a game; it's meant to be played."
Perhaps, but after tonight, she and her implants
will be taking root elsewhere.
