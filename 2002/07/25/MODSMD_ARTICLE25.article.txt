# Athletes and Stanford test Olympic waters at Pentathlon
## 
### DANIEL URBAN STAFF WRITER 
Perfect California weather greeted the in
ternational field of athletes at the 2002 World
Pentathlon Championships, held on the
Stanford campus July 17 through July 22.
Over 250 athletes from over 40 countries
competed lor the title of the world's greatest
sportsman and sportswoman.
The grueling event consists of equestrian
jumping, pistol shooting, fencing, swimming
and running, all on the same day, making for
a marathon test of endurance, strength and
skill.
Moreover, each completed this ordeal
twice, once for the preliminaries and once for
the finals, with only one day's rest in between.
If the concept of the pentathlon sounds
unfamiliar, it is because the event is not wide
ly practiced in America.
Originating with the legend of a French
officer having to ride a horse, clear his way
through enemy lines with pistol and sword,
swim across a river and then run to deliver an
urgent the sport has traditionally
been dominated by European competitors.
This week's Championships were no ex
ception.
The highest American finisher in the fi
nals, Mary lagorashvili, placed 19th in the
women's competition.
None of the American men scored a single
point in the finals, each finishing in a tie with
30 other competitors for last place.
Hungarian women claimed the two first
place finishes in the women's final, with Bea
Simoka winning the gold medal.
Michal Sedlecky of the Czech Republic
won the men's competition.
With the individual competition complet
ed by Friday, athletes competed Saturday
and Sunday for national pride in the relays.
Each country picked three of their athletes
to create that nation's pentathlon dream
team.

The Czech men were unable to match
their compatriot's individual victory, finish
ing last in the relay competition, while Ger
many claimed their second-ever pentathlon
relay gold medal.
The Czech women, on the other hand, de
feated Germany and every other team in the
field, winning the gold for their first time.

The American men, Chad Senior, Eli Bre
mer and Scott Christie may not have scored
any points in the individual competition, but
teamed together they tallied 5,148 points for
12th place in the relay.
Mary lagorashvili, Monica Fling and
Sharon Sander likewise proved that their
sum was greater than their parts, placing fifth

in the women's relay.
Stanford came out a winner from the
week of competition, providing a nearly per
feet setting for the competition. If the Bay
Area successfully completes its 2012 Olympic
bid, the recent Championships may not be
the last time we see an international champi
onship held on the Farm.
