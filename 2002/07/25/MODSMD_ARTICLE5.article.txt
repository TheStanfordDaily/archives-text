## Tenure for women continues to cause concern While gains have been made in junior faculty appointments, female professors still find tenure process difficult. 
### AUDREY HARRIS 
Walking through the halls of a Stanford
coed residence, a visitor may perceive the
University as a model community of gender
equity. Indeed, Stanford prides itself on the
fact that it has been coed since its founding in
1891.
Step into a classroom, however, and a vis
itor will discover ajarring fact: While the stu
dents represent a harmonious mix of males
and females of varying ethnic backgrounds,
approximately three times to one, the pro
fessor at the head of the classroom is male.
Stanford is making gains toward resolv
ing this incongruity. For example, three of
Stanford's seven schools — Law, Educa
tion, and Humanities and Sciences — now
boast female deans.
Stanford is also recruiting female junior
faculty at a fast clip. Over the last five years,
the proportion of women among junior
tenure-line hires has risen from 17 percent
to 30 percent, a significant jump.
The proportion of women among the
newly-appointed tenured faculty, however,
has not demonstrated the same promising
gains.
According to a May report to the Faculty
Senate, only 17 percent of those appointed
to senior tenure-line positions in the last five
years have been women. Also, of the 17 total
senior tenure-line hires made during the
past academic year, only two were women.
However, Senior Associate Provost Kathy
Gillam points out that the percentage of men
and women offered full tenure is equal. As
suming an acceptance rate of 50 percent, if
10 men and 4 women were up for review, 5
men and 2 women would be offered tenure.
The Road to Tenure
After an initial term of three or four years,
assistant professors face a review by their de
partment fora possible reappointment for
an additional three or four years.
The tenure review process then begins
during the seventh year, as the assistant pro
fessors face a subcommittee of tenured facul
ty from their department. This body evalu
ates their research and writing, and solicits
up to 18 letters of recommendation from
scholars within their field and from students
who have worked under the supervision of
the candidates.
The subcommittee presents a file on the
candidates to the full-tenured faculty of the
department fora vote.
In most of Stanford's sch<x>ls, if the facul
ty recommends approval, the file moves on
for review by a committee of the respective
dean's office.
This committee advises the dean whether
or not to approve candidates. If the dean ol
the individual school recommends ap
proval, he or she sends the case to the
provost. The provost, in consultation with
his staff, decides whether to send the case

along to the Advisory Board, a body consist
ing of seven senior professors of varying dis
ciplines elected by Stanford's entire faculty.
If the candidates receive approval, the
Advisory Board forwards the file to the pres
ident for final approval.
Rejection of a file at any step in this
process means the end of the road fora can
didate, unless he or she files a successful ap
peal.
The case of Anthropology Prof. Akhil
Gupta provides an example of such an ap
peal. His bid for tenure was ended by then-
Dean of the School of Humanities and Sci
ences John Shoven, despite the unanimous
endorsement of his department. Respond
ing to his ensuing appeal, then-Provost Con
doleezza Rice forwarded his case to the Ad
visory Board, citing procedural problems in
the review of Gupta's case.
The Advisory Board eventually recom
mended that Gupta be promoted with
tenure, and then-President Gerhard Casper
approved this recommendation.
Partly as a result of charges of inconsis
tency, attempts to streamline the appeals
process and create clearer time guidelines
were made. A new version of the process
provides fora committee of eight to twelve
individuals to serve as fact-finders who ad
vise the provost on issues that arise in ap
peals.
One of the primary purposes of tenure is
to protect academic freedom, and allow fac
ulty members the chance to explore non
traditional subjects within their field without
worrying about job security.
Women and Tenure
It can be hard to pin down evidence of
overall discrimination against women in uni
versities, according to Stephanie Wildman, a
law professor at Santa Clara University spe
cializing in sex discrimination and the law.
"Though its forms are subtle, anecdotal
evidence from women nationally on tenure
decisions suggests that discrimination still
exists," she said.
In February 1997, Stanford's Depart
ment of History recommended to Dean
John Shoven that assistant professor Karen
Sawislak, a specialist in 19th-century U.S.
history, be granted tenure. Shoven rejected
her promotion, stating in a letter that lie did
not believe the quality and quantity of her
scholarship did not meet the standards of
the University.
Sawislak filed an appeal and a grievance.
The Advisory Board motioned to grant her
grievance.
In response, President Casper offered
her a unique opportunity: to start the tenure
process afresh. Sawislak declined, then filed
a gender discrimination complaint with the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commis
sion and a class action complaint to the De
partment of Labor, with a group that even
tually consisted of 32 female and minority

faculty members.
The suit was eventually settled out of
court, but Sawislak's story raised a new level
of awareness about the position of female
faculty within the University.
In a September, 1999 article for the
Chronicle of Education titled "Denying
Tenure: Who Said anything about Fair
ness?," Sawislak tells her side of the story of
her battle with Stanford over tenure.
According to Sawislak, the standards for
tenure are unclear and constantly changing
and a system that provides "a recipe for fa
voritism and discrimination.
The Advisory Board, in a statement on
her case, expressed "concern about the lack
of a clearly-articulated, widely-disseminated,
University-wide policy on some aspects of
faculty affirmative action."
Of the University's treatment of her dur
ing the appeals process, Sawislak writes, "As
anyone who has been denied tenure can at
test, the institution and its defenders do their
best to reinforce a sense of personal inade
quacy and shame."
Despite the difficulties of the appeals and
grievance process, Sawislak wrote that the
result of her "refusal to go quietly" was"the
conviction that 1 did not fail. Quite the re
verse: There is no doubt in my mind that
Stanford failed to treat me with fairness of
with equity."
In Sawislak's opinion, because tenure de
cisions are based on subjective evaluations of
the future promise of the candidate, the ad
ministration places itself in the position of
holding the definitive right to comment on
the fairness of each decision.
"Stanford administrators swear up and
down, to me and to everyone else, that their
tenure process is fair. I think they sincerely
believe that. But how can the rest of us be
sure? Because those who run the system say
it is so?"
Colleen Crangle, who was hired by the
Stanford Medical School as a senior research
scientist in 1995, claims that after she se
cured funding fora grant, an associate dean
and another male colleague cut back her re
sponsibilities and limited her research.
After she complained of differential treat
ment, she claims that she was forced to re
port to another colleague, becoming the
only senior research scientist forced to do so.
Citing retaliation, she filed a gender discrim
ination complaint. Then, the University
fired her.
In March 2000, Crangle was awarded
more than half a million dollars in court.
After Stanford appealed the case, the two
parties settled out of court.
Crangle, in a statement released by the
American Association of University Women,
which provided $35,000 to fund her case,
said that she and other women have "en
counterfed ] subtle but impenetrable barriers
that many, even the established hierarchy at
Stanford, believe are long gone."

Commenting on the case of Crangle,
Debra Zumwalt, the University's general
counsel, said, "The University did not dis
criminate or retaliate against her. The court
found that there was not sufficient evidence
of discrimination to even allow that part of
case to go to trial. The judgment on the re
taliation claim was vacated."
Referring to the women who have filed
gender discrimination complaints after an
unfavorable tenure decision, Zumwalt said,
"People often look [when they're unhappy
about a tenure decision] to see if there are
reasons other than the merits of their case."
While she applauded the "various initia
tives" by members of the administration to
support women, she said, "I don't think that
the litigation at Stanford has done anything
to improve the situation for women. What
these complainants are doing is asking for
money for themselves."
Sylvia Newman, president of the Legal
Advocacy Fund of the American Association
of University Women — an organization
that also provided funding for the cases of
Sawislak and Crangle — takes a different po
sition on the litigation.
Newman takes it as an indication that
there's a problem.
"We're not sure that Stanford has done
anything to improve the situation for its fe
male faculty. We have had four cases
brought against Stanford University . . .
considering what it takes fora woman to file
a lawsuit and bring it through to its end, I
would find it difficult to think they do it to get
money for themselves."
Newman emphasizes, "We're not in the
business of trying to get people to sue. We
would like to help universities get into the sit
uation where women will not have to sue."
"We see that women are heavily concen
trated among assistant professors and un
ranked positions, such as lecturer, and least
concentrated among full professors. Only
13.5 percent of full professors as Stanford
are women, while the national average is 18
percent. I do think that these numbers rep
resent an injustice to women," Newman
said.
New Measures
Changes in the administration have led to
revised policies and renewed interest in is
sues faced by female faculty.
Upon his inauguration, President John
Hennessy's cited the recruitment and reten
tion of female faculty as one of his top goals.
In 2001, Hennessy and Provost John
Etchemendy enumerated a ten-point plan
for promoting faculty diversity at a Faculty
Senate meeting.
"We must make extra efforts to seek out
qualified women and minority candidates
and to evaluate such candidates. This oblig
ation must be taken seriously for senior ap-
pointments where active outreach
to potential candidates is required
as part of the search process."
He also highlighted the cre
ation of the new Advisory Commit
tee on the Status of Women Facul
ty and the Advisory Committee on
Faculty Diversity. Furthermore,
he called for the need lor annual
reviews of the status of female fac
ulty at the University.
Looking over the nearly two
years of his presidency, Hennessy
remarked, "The progress [towards
gender equity in the faculty] has
been slower than 1 wish it were."
He attributed the pace to the
fact that "the set of challenges ...
differ across disciplines. [It's] not
easy to address the problem."
Asked whether factors of race
and gender come in to play at the
time of decisions on tenure, (as
they do in the recruitment of ju
nior faculty) he answered with an
emphatic "No."
"We have one standard for
tenure between men and women."
He said that his administration
was placing an emphasis on being
"creative . . . toward hiring
women when the pool is small,
even if they have slightly different
qualities than the ones looked for."
This consideration acknowl
edges the historic complaints of fe
male faculty that their often less
traditional branches of specializa
tion have been less-highly prized
than traditional scholarship.

A Focus on Family
Associate Prof essor of Pediatrics
Phyllis Dennery is chair of the sub
committee of the new Advisory
Committee on the Status of
Women Faculty in charge of re
cruitment, promotion and reten
tion. Since its creation, the com
mittee has been in a fact-finding
phase.
Dennery described the tenure
process which is a game of social
networking, often difficult for
women who don't know the rules.
"The chance to have role mod
els and mentors is important," she
said.
In particular, Dennery noted
that one of the biggest obstacles to
the attainment of tenure for
women was family.
"[Women] have a different pace
because of family obligations. Let's
say they took some time off to have
kids and had limited opportunities
to publish .. . they still had a solid
track record, but had moved at a
different pace," said Dennery.
Dennery also commented that
child-rearing often sharpens cre
ativity.
Another obstacle toward devel
oping this record suggested Vice
Provost for Faculty Development
Patricia Jones, lies in the very na
ture of women and, in particular,
the propensity for Stanford's fe
male faculty to serve on University
committees.
"Many women are very nurtur
ing and want to be helpful. Cer
tainly, they do need to keep in
mind the main things they will be
considered for for tenure — they
have to develop the track record to

show that they will be valuable fac
ulty members," she said. "It is true
that too much time spent [on com
mittees] could be harmful to this
record."
On the (lip side, Jones noted
that while female professors at
other institutions, most visibly at
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, feel alienated from
community life, Stanford's female
professors are given many oppor
tunities to get involved in their de
partments, to the point that they
can get over-committed.
Many of the issues that Dennery
and Jones are tackling at the ad
ministrative level can seem daunt
ing to young female faculty mem
bers, some of whom take a less op
timistic look at the University's
support networks for women with
families.
One lecturer in the Department
of English, who preferred not to be
named, said that that the race
against the tenure time clock can
be intimidating fora young
woman considering starting a fam
ily, and can involve sacrifices that
women are not willing to make.
"To make those kinds of choic
es, that's tough," she said. "[l'm]
much happier being a lecturer
than being under the tenure track,
which seems relentless."
"In general, I think the profes
sorial life is more difficult for
women. Watching my female
friends looking for work [in acade
mia], I saw that married men were
looked upon as stable, while
women in relationships were seen
as more dangerous. In that way,
it's still a boy's school."
