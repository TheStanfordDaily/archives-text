# Kids forget their worries at Camp Kesem
## Working Magic 
### JONATHAN MARRON 
112 g magine waking up at
S 7:00 am to a cold, bug
( J M infested cabin two
hours away from much
of anything. The cabin's toilet has flooded
the bathroom twice in the past two days
and your hands are dyed fifteen different
colors thanks to the previous day's art
project. Calls of "Good morning guys. It's
time to get up," fail to elicit a single re
sponse from the half-dozen campers hud
dled in their respective sleeping bags.
Add to that a splitting headache from
when a camper stepped on your head
while climbing out of his bunk to go to
the bathroom in the middle of the night,
and you have the ingredients fora beau
tiful morning.
To some, this would be nothing short
of a living nightmare. To a select group,
however, this is the magical, chosen way
to spend the week following the conclu
sion of spring quarter.
Having just completed its second year,
Camp Kesem is a week-long overnight
camp in Sonoma County for 49 children,
ages six through thirteen, who have a par
ent who has died from cancer or is cur
rently battling the disease.
Kesem, which means "magic" in He
brew, is a service project of Hillel, a Jew
ish student organization at Stanford. It
was created, funded and planned by
Stanford students, who volunteered their
time. The camp is free of cost to each child
who attends, thanks to the generous do
nations of foundations, corporations and
various individuals from around the Bay
Area and across the country.
The counseling staff is completely
comprised of Stanford student volun
teers, over 30 in all. Camp Kesem main
tains a 2-to-l camper to counselor ratio,
which is complemented by a professional
staff of nurses, therapists and other pro
fessionals, also all volunteers.
Camp Kesem was conceived in the
spring of2ooo by Iris Rave, then the Jewish
Campus Service Core Fellow for Hillel.
Rave imagined Camp Kesem as a place
where the children of individuals suffering
from cancer could " just lx* kids" fora week
and leave their problems at home.
She prrx eeded to recruit a core group of
Stanford students to help plan and orga

nize Camp Kesem's inaugural year, and
she herself took on the full-time role of
camp director and head administrator. At
that point, Camp Kesem hit the ground
running and hasn't looked back since.
"We've run into many types of obsta
cles over the past two years," says Rave,
"But the magic that we've gotten to expe
rience the past two summers has made all
that worthwhile ten times over."
Camp Kesem 2001 quickly grew from
an idea to a reality, as a campsite was
found, campers signed up, money was
raised, counselors were recruited and
camp programs were developed. Over
the course of the 2000-2001 academic
year, the student leaders of Camp Kesem
raised over $85,000; and, on June 17, the
camp officially began.
Camp Kesem 2001 lasted for six days
and included such highlights as a camp
fire, a team-building trip on the ropes
course, an all-camp talent show and a clos
ing carnival complete with a dunk tank.
The camp has grown both in size
(nearly 50 campers and over 30 coun
selors) and duration (a full eight days).
Between September 2001 and June
2002, the students behind Camp Kesem
pooled their resources to raise an as
tounding $110,000 and planned count
less programs and activities, devoting lit
erally thousands of hours of their time in
the process.
When Camp Kesem 2002 finally oc
curred, it was a rousing success. Along
with camp essentials such as arts and
crafts, drama, sports, swimming, nature
walks, S'mores and several gallons of in
sect repellent, the camp also included a
puppeteer and a magician.
Many counselors chose to adopt
"camp names" in order to further aug
ment the magical feeling of camp. The
adopted names ranged from those of fa
vorite animals to fictional characters to
hometown sports teams.
(hampers and counselors alike left (lamp
Kesem with tears in their eyes but joy in
their hearts knowing that the next Camp
Kesem was only twelve months away.

Several members of the Green Dragons look on as a fellow camper conquers the perch,
the most difficult event of the ropes course. Eleven-year-old Nina explained, "I got to meet
friends and meet new people [at Camp Kesem], I feel like other people understand."
