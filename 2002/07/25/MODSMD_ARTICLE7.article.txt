## DISPATCHES FROM THE OUTER DARKNESS Eschatonic: a fizzy take on the end of the world 
### MARK GANEK STAFF COLUMNIST 
Q: A giant asteroid of doom walks
into a bar.
A: That's not a question.
Ha, ha. You must forgive my
light-hearted tomfoolery, but the
total annihilation of life on Earth
makes me giddy. In case you
haven't heard, the plucky, pith hel
met-wearing Dr. Benny Peiser of
Liverpool John Moores University
in the United Kingdom, told BBC
News Online that astronomers
have found the most threatening
object in the short history of aster
oid detection. Observations of this
cheeky bit of space-rock big
enough to destroy a continent sug
gest that it is on a collision course
with Earth.
Luckily, Dr. Benny is on the
case, selflessly taking time off from

his regular job as an oatmeal re
pairman. I think we can all rest
easy knowing the fate of civilization
is in the hands of Dr. Benny. This is
a guy whose name sounds like the
stuffed bear a pediatrician uses to
distract kids before poking them
with needles. Which, by the way,
ensures that psychiatrist offices of
the future will be chock-full of pa
tients with major trust issues,
thereby completing the Circle of
Life. I think photosynthesis is also
involved, but I forget how.
Let us refocus and march on
ward like a line of fire ants toward
a nudist picnic. The plucky, pipe
smoking, taut-thighed Dr. Benny
licked his lips lasciviously and con
tinued, "Additional observations in
coining weeks will almost certainly
— we hope — eliminate the cur
rent threat."
How can you not love Dr.
Benny? My confidence in him is so

great that I will spend the next
year whimpering in my closet
under a blanket.
In the incredibly unlikely event
that the irascible but cuddly Dr.
Benny should tail, a backup plan
must be drawn up. 1 suggest that
our effort in asteroid diversion
should center on a tbrce more
powerful than any other known to
man: pornography. Almost every
technological advance in history
has eventually been put into the
service of pornography, from the
printing press to photography, the
Internet to cosmetic surgery.
I'm sure that if we could only re
verse the equation and use
pornography to drive the engine
of technological progress, we
would be able to avoid complete
destruction. For instance, I believe
we could figure out a way to pre
vent the asteroid from annihilating
itself against Earth if we could just

convince those NASA geeks there
was really great porn on it.
If our porn-powered technolo
gy is not yet operational, I say we
just send Janet Reno up there to
give the asteroid a stern talking-to.
This tough-talking bayou babe not
only made gutsy calls in the CMill
ion administration, she is now
kicking up a storm in the Democ
ratic primary for governor in
Florida. After becoming the basis
fora Saturday Night Live sketch
entitled "Janet Reno's Dance
Party," she then appeared on the
show in that sketch. And now, she
has thrown a campaign fund-rais
er called, you guessed it, "Janet
Reno's Dance Party."
Anyone who can achieve this
level of self-referentiality is a better
woman that I. Some would argue
she is a better woman than I because
of qualities like, I don't know,
ovaries. These people are tiresome

and should not be invited to cocktail
parties, unless they are invited only
to be pelted with some sort of appe
tizer. And yes, an ovary is a quality.
I don't know about you, but as
long as we have Dr. Benny,
pornography and Janet Reno
going for us, 1 can sleep soundly,
ignoring the whooshing sound the
asteroid doesn't make as it zips
through space. Of course, com
plete and utter devastation may
not be all bad. Our rendezvous
with the asteroid of doom isn't
scheduled until Feb. 1, 2019, by
which time most of us will be
trapped in soulless jobs and failing
marriages, and will be begging for
death anyway. Happy stargazing!
