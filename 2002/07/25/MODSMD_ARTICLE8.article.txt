# Doing things the Sicilian way
## 
### MARK DOMINIK GUEST COLUMNIST 
Sicily has an interesting reputa
tion in America. The mention of the
island that lies between the Italian
peninsula and the African coast con
jures images of poverty, long, hot
days and fat, pasta-eating and
Porsche-driving mafiosi.
Obviously the Sicily of myth is not
the Sicily of fact. People in Sicily lead
lives much like those we lead in the
United States. They have (mostly le
gitimate) jobs and go home at night
to families they care for.
But it is true that things are done
a bit differently on this island. In the
small town of Salemi where our
team of archaeologists lives, I wait in
line at the bank while people in front
of me withdraw 1700 euros (about
$1700) in cash. Local bigwigs occa
sionally leave to go to "pharmaceuti
cal conventions" in St. Petersburg.
Armed thugs unload cigarettes from
trucks into unmarked buildings.
Bridges go on for miles along the au
tostrada, for no particular reason
other than to generate business for
the construction industry. And in
Palermo, a city of 750,000 people,
the occasional out-of-control horse
runs through the streets.
Firefighting in Sicily is particu
larly different from its counterpart

in the United States. Much like the
hills surrounding Stanford, the
Sic ily area in the summer is a tin
derbox waiting to catch fire. From
the top of Monte Polizzo, where
our team excavates, it is possible to
see fires in all directions every day.
At night, the distinctive oscillating
siren of Italian fire trucks wakes us
as emergency crews speed past the
dig house to the latest flare-up.
Last Monday, we had a fire of our
own, and the sirens were coming to
put out the blaze that threatened
our home.
As we waited lor the fire engines
to arrive, the 60 Stanford students
who work on the excavation rushed
with water of all kinds to wet the
flaming field of brush that lies be
hind our house. Buckets of water
dirty from washing 2600-year-old
pottery and bottles of Fabrizia min
eral water alike were poured onto
the blaze. When the fire department
and the Corpo Forestale arrived, we
thought our work was done.
We were wrong. From the sec
ond-floor window of the house, we
watched as the firefighters
quenched two of the three blazes in
the field below. Most of the team had
returned to work, assuming the
threat was over. After seeing the two
most threatening blazes quenched, I
decided to go to bed fora few hours

ot'pausa.
Two hours later, the lire had re
turned. The fire department had
packed up and gone back to the sta
tion after it quenched two of the
blazes, leaving the third to smolder
until a bit of wind spread it to virgin
straw. This time, we didn't trust the
fire department to take care of the
fire by itself. The team was out there
with bottles of mineral water,
quenching every ember and watch
ing the firefighters at work.
As the professionals were pack
ing to leave, one team member no
ticed a log still aflame. He called
them over to put it out. Hose in
hand and cigarette in mouth, the
firefighter extinguished the blaze.
At 7 p.m., the firefighters left. At
11:30 p.m., two brave team mem
bers finished their work with water
bottles and shovels, making sure the
blaze didn't return.
Before the firefighters left, they
determined that the fire was most
likely started by a cigarette. We
can only hope that next time, the
fire department lets us extinguish
the blaze.
