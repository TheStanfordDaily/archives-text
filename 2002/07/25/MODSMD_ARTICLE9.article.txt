# LETTER TO THE EDITOR
## 
### 
I write this reply to Louis
Eisenberg's letter of last
week. First, he addressed his
argument to "Christians like
Gaudet" despite the fact that 1
have never held myself out as a
Christian in The Stanford Daily.
The simple fact that 1 defended
the words "under God" in the
Pledge of Allegiance does not
make me Christian. 1 could be
Sikh, Muslim, Sufi or Jewish. It
makes no difference for the pur
pose of the discussion.
According to figures cited in
Stephen L. Carter's book, "God's
Name in Vain," survey data from
1997 show that 84 percent of Amer
icans believe in God and another 10
percent believe in a higher power.
It is not my "claim," as Eisenberg
protests, but rather an empirical
fact about our country. Of course,
these statistics tell us very little.
God means so many things to
different people that, in the end,
the mere word has very little sig
nificance. In religion, it is the ex
perience of transcendence that
matters most. This type of experi
ence can be found especially in
the lives of mystics, but we are all
capable of it. The words in the
pledge are trivial by comparison,
and they amount to nothing
more than an expression of our
general convictions.

Eisenberg overstates the case
when he says these words are being
"shoved down our throats." Their
truth is in the ear of the listener. For
some, God means Beauty. For oth
ers, God is an Overlord. The con
cept of God is so general that, even
in the Bible, He is called by many
different names. There is no dogma
in those three letters.
Judge Alfred Goodwin's deci
sion is good precedent in the Ninth
U.S. (Circuit Court of Appeals until a
majority of the active judges vote to
consider it en banc. That has not
been done. The opinion was stayed
so it cannot be enforced, but it stands
as precedent. Media outlets have in
correctly reported that the decision
was withdrawn. It currently stands.
The individual freedoms in the
First Amendment are safe when
Eisenberg can refuse to recite the
pledge, as he does. That : s fine. A
previous case heard by the U.S.
Supreme Court exempted Jeho
vah's Witnesses from reciting the
pledge because they believed that
heralding flags was akin to idol wor
ship. That's line too. We know our
constitutional rights are healthy
and secure when atheists and Jeho
vah's Witnesses can share the same
bed for very different reasons.
