## Bank of the West Classic Cashing in at Bank of the West No. 2 Venus Williams collects her second title on the Farm 
### JIMMY WU STAFF WRITER 
Nearly 17 years ago, a father
told his young daughter that
she was about to become one of
the best tennis players in the
world.
Williams, one of the most
feared players on the WTA Tour,
certainly proved her father right
when she basically walked
through the singles draw at the
Bank of the West Classic played
last week at Taube Family Tennis
Stadium. This title was her sec
ond in three years â€” she also
claimed the trophy in 2000 but
didn't compete in 2001.
After winning all three of her
matches leading into the finals in
straight sets and after dropping
only 15 games total, the second
ranked Williams faced No. 5 Kim
Clijsters, the defending Classic
champion, on Sunday.
In front of a sellout crowd of
4,506, Williams not only over
powered the Belgian, but also
showed her improved overall
game, highlighted by a per

fectly placed drop shot from
near her own baseline, on the
way to a dominating 6-3, 6-3
performance.
However, the score fails to tell
the whole story, as Clijsters
played well.
Williams was simply much better.
"She brought out some of the
best in my game," Williams said.
"She ran down a lot of balls and
she returned my serve very well
at times, which made it a little
challenging."
Clijsters, the fourth seed in the
tournament, upset second-seed
ed Lindsay Davenport 4-6,6-4,6-
2 in the semifinals to earn her
spot in the finals.
This was Davenport's first
WTA event of the year as she has
been kept off the courts for eight
months due to a knee injury.
After making it to the finals for
the second year in a row, the 19-
year-old Clijsters just couldn't
muster enough punch to counter
Williams's polished game.
"It's so tough," Clijsters said.
"You feel like every shot has to be
almost perfect."
Although Williams had some
difficulty with the sun, evidenced
by her uncharacteristic 10 double
faults, Clijsters was unable to
overcome a serve that reached a
tournament-high speed of 119

mph. Clijsters did not gain a
break until late in the second set,
when the outcome was almost in
evitable.
With the victory, Williams will
stay put as No. 2 in the world be
hind her sister Serena, who best
ed Venus in the final at Wimble
don. Although she was the run
ner-up, Clijsters will actually fall
from No. 5 to No. 7 after the
tournament.
The doubles bracket also cul
minated on Sunday, as top-seed
ed Lisa Raymond and Rennae
Stubbs showed why they are
ranked third in the world with a
6-1,6-1 walloping of 55th-ranked
Janette Husarova and Conchita
Martinez.
Unfortunate enough to face
Williams on her way to the tro
phy were Americans Meghan
Shaughnessy and Raymond, and
Russian Anna Kournikova.
The second round matchup
between Williams and Shaugh
nessy was a repeat of last year's
quarterfinal, which Shaughnessy
won in one of the biggest match
es of her career with a 2-6, 7-5, 7-
6(4) upset. This time, Williams
made sure there was no deja vu as
she sent her opponent packing
with a 6-4, 6-1 victory.

Nineteen-year-old Belgian Kim Clijsters will slide from No. 5 to No. 7 after
failing to defend her 2001 Bank of the West title against No. 2 Venus
Williams.
