## Bank of the West Classic Cashing in at Bank of the West No. 2 Venus Williams collects her second title on the Farm 
### JIMMY WU STAFF WRITER 
Nearly 17 years ago, a father
told his young daughter that
she was about to become one of
the best tennis players in the
world.
Williams, one of the most
feared players on the WTA Tour,
certainly proved her father right
when she basically walked
through the singles draw at the
Bank of the West Classic played
last week at Taube Family Tennis
Stadium. This title was her sec
ond in three years â€” she also
claimed the trophy in 2000 but
didn't compete in 2001.
After winning all three of her
matches leading into the finals in
straight sets and after dropping
only 15 games total, the second
ranked Williams faced No. 5 Kim
Clijsters, the defending Classic
champion, on Sunday.
In front of a sellout crowd of
4,506, Williams not only over
powered the Belgian, but also
showed her improved overall
game, highlighted by a per

fectly placed drop shot from
near her own baseline, on the
way to a dominating 6-3, 6-3
performance.
However, the score fails to tell
the whole story, as Clijsters
played well.
Williams was simply much better.
"She brought out some of the
best in my game," Williams said.
"She ran down a lot of balls and
she returned my serve very well
at times, which made it a little
challenging."
Clijsters, the fourth seed in the
tournament, upset second-seed
ed Lindsay Davenport 4-6,6-4,6-
2 in the semifinals to earn her
spot in the finals.
This was Davenport's first
WTA event of the year as she has
been kept off the courts for eight
months due to a knee injury.
After making it to the finals for
the second year in a row, the 19-
year-old Clijsters just couldn't
muster enough punch to counter
Williams's polished game.
"It's so tough," Clijsters said.
"You feel like every shot has to be
almost perfect."
Although Williams had some
difficulty with the sun, evidenced
by her uncharacteristic 10 double
faults, Clijsters was unable to
overcome a serve that reached a
tournament-high speed of 119

mph. Clijsters did not gain a
break until late in the second set,
when the outcome was almost in
evitable.
With the victory, Williams will
stay put as No. 2 in the world be
hind her sister Serena, who best
ed Venus in the final at Wimble
don. Although she was the run
ner-up, Clijsters will actually fall
from No. 5 to No. 7 after the
tournament.
The doubles bracket also cul
minated on Sunday, as top-seed
ed Lisa Raymond and Rennae
Stubbs showed why they are
ranked third in the world with a
6-1,6-1 walloping of 55th-ranked
Janette Husarova and Conchita
Martinez.
Unfortunate enough to face
Williams on her way to the tro
phy were Americans Meghan
Shaughnessy and Raymond, and
Russian Anna Kournikova.
The second round matchup
between Williams and Shaugh
nessy was a repeat of last year's
quarterfinal, which Shaughnessy
won in one of the biggest match
es of her career with a 2-6, 7-5, 7-
6(4) upset. This time, Williams
made sure there was no deja vu as
she sent her opponent packing
with a 6-4, 6-1 victory.

Nineteen-year-old Belgian Kim Clijsters will slide from No. 5 to No. 7 after
failing to defend her 2001 Bank of the West title against No. 2 Venus
Williams.
Williams then moved on to face
the popular Kournikova. The
56th-ranked Kournikova had
been impressive in the first two
rounds with victories over No. 8
Anna Smashnova and Indone
sia's Wynne Prakusya. Before the
tournament, the Russian had not
won a singles match in over two
months.
Although Kournikova provid
ed her with some stiff competi
tion, Williams showed off her
trademark power game and ad
vanced with a 6-3, 6-4 victory.
In the semifinals, Williams
faced the surprising 28th-ranked
Raymond. The doubles specialist
had already pulled off one of the
major upsets of the tournament
by defeating fan-favorite No. 4

Monica Seles 6-4, 6-2 in the quar
terfinals. However, her quest to
become both a singles and a dou
bles champion at the Classic
ended with a 6-3, 6-0 loss to
Williams.
In a tournament that saw three
of its top eight seeds disappear
after the second round, the
crowds were treated to some awe
inspiring tennis from the wild
cards and qualifiers, as well as the
proven players.
After the first round, five wild
cards and qualifiers had ad
vanced with gutsy victories over
highly-ranked players. No. 266
Jelcna Jankovic of Yugoslavia
even advanced into the quarter
finals with a courageous 7-6(8),
2-6, 6-3 victory over No. 17
Daja Bednova, overcoming a
leg injury in the middle of the
second set.
However, aside from Ray
mond's spectacular run, which

included the termination of the
hopes of former Stanford great
Marissa Irvin, everything else
went according to plan.
In the end, it was just
Williams's improved ability to
pounce on her chances to pull
away that sealed the victory for
her.
"It was just a few years ago that
I wasn't very good with the big
points," said Williams, who con
verted all four of her break
chances. "I could get to the big
points, but I couldn't close the big
points. It was just a learning ex
perience. Now, a majority of the
time, I make the shot and I go for
a lot more."
Now with the fourth and final
Grand Slam of the year peeking
over the horizon, and after
Venus's stunning performance at
the Classic, Serena had better not
get too comfortable as the top
player in the world.
