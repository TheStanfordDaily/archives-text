# Rivalry motivates second-ranked sis

### KENNETH GARRETT EDITORIAL STAFF 
Last Sunday was a chance for Venus
Williams not only to win not
only to reclaim the trophy she last held
in 2000, and not only to avenge her loss
to Kim Clijsters earlier this year in the
final at Hamburg.
The final match of the Bank of the
West Classic held at Stanford's Taube
Family Tennis Stadium was most im
portantly a chance for Venus to remind
us why we love the Williams sisters —
their sibling rivalry, played out at the
highest echelon of athletic excellence, is
simply great drama.
As the older and thus far more success
ful of the Williams duo, Venus became too
comfortable and lost her edge in the final
at Wimbledon earlier this summer.
"I was still cruising on two great years
and she [Serena] was clawing her way
through," Williams said. "She had
much more fight."
As a result, Venus lost her No. 1 rank

ing to Serena, and now stands nearly
1,000 points behind her at No. 2.
"Once you get to No. 1, it's not so nice
to go back to No. 2," Williams admitted.
The fact that her ranking went to her
sister, however, motivates Venus all the
more to get it back.
In order for another switch to occur,
Venus has to defend her titles in San
Diego, New Haven and Flushing Mead
ows. Serena, on the other hand, has
only to defend her Canadian Open title
and reach the final in New York to stay
on top. As a result, it's very unlikely that
Venus will regain her No. 1 ranking this
summer.
But in the meantime, Venus — a two
time Wimbledon and U.S. Open cham
pion — has a lot of work to do.
Williams attributes her recent lacklus
ter performances against her sister to the
weakness of her technical game, and
feels that changes in the coming months
will help her rocket back to No. 1.
"If you aren't doing everything right, it
gives you much less confidence in all your

shots, especially at the slams," Venus said.
"I wasn't able to do as much as I wanted to
against Serena [at Wimbledon] as I did
against other players."
Williams did quite enough against
Clijsters on Sunday, however, clocking
in serves as fast as 119 mph at one point.
Her precise yet powerful shots kept the
19-year-old Clijsters on the move, and
compensated for Williams's 10 double
faults.
"It's always pretty effective," Williams
said of her serve. "But when it's really
effective it's better for me. It makes the
match a little easier."
There is no reason to doubt that
Venus will make the changes necessary
to reclaim her top ranking. The defeat
ed Clijsters was the first to recognize
Williams's ability to fight.
"When she feels she needs to, she
does a little bit extra," Clijsters said.
And a little bit extra is what will be
needed in the final weeks before the
