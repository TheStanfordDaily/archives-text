Panthers to pay Fasani $1.5 million
The Carolina Panthers agreed to a four-year, $1.5
million contract with former Cardinal quarterback
Randy Fasani. The deal has the potential for big payoffs
in 2005.
The Panther's fifth-round draft pick, Fasani will re
ceive a $175,000 signing bonus, and earn the league
minimum base salary for the first three years. By partic
ipating in 55 percent of the Panther's offensive plays
during any of his first seasons, Fasani will trigger the con
tract's escalator clause entitling him pay equal to the
NFL's highest tender offer in 2005.
If he does not reach that mark, his 2005 base salary will
be significantly lower.
The Panthers currently have Fasani as their No. 3
quarterback behind starter Chris Weinke and 14-year
NFL veteran Rodney Peete.
The Tennessee Titans have also settled terms with
Stanford alumnus Tank Williams, who was the fourth
safety chosen in the draft.
Williams, a 6-fbot-2,223-pc>und .safety, earned All-Pacific 10
Conference honors following his senior season at Stanford
that included five interceptions, 68 tackles and two sacks.
Logan leads USA sweep over Cuba
Stanford senior Logan Tom led the U.S. women's na
tional team as it swept Cuba 3-0 on July 21 at the FIVB
World Grand Prix.
Tom scored 11 points while Danielle Scott added 10 to
the victory.
Tom had six kills, a match-high three blocks and two
service aces to lead the United States to a (6-12) to a 25-
21, 25-17, 28-26 win.
The win gave Team USA a 2-1 record in Pool D play
and a 3-3 overall record in the tournament.
Schroeder wins first international gold
The U.S. Under-23 Men's Eight won gold at the Na
tion's Cup in Genoa, Italy.
Stanford junior Jamie Schroeder won his first interna
tional crew medal in his first international competition.
Sitting in seat five, Schroeder helped push his boat's
winning time of 6:12.05, finishing 3.67 seconds ahead of
second-place Canada.

The U.S. placed well overall with four medals, includ
ing gold in the men's eight, silver in the women's pair
and bronze medals in both the women's double sculls
and men's pair.
USA World Team defeats USA Elite for softball title
The USA World Team climbed out of the loser's brack
et to defeat the USA Elite team 4-0 to capture softball's
Canada Cup championship.
The game saw former Cardinal teammates Jessica
Mendoza and Sarah Beeson square off against one an
other as well.
The match was a battle of superior pitching. The USA
World Team did its damage in the sixth inning, scoring
four unearned runs, including one from Mendoza, who
reached on a passed ball after striking out.
Beeson, playing for the USA Elite team, went 1 -for-2 at
the plate with a walk.
Wideman to be inducted into New England Hall of Fame
Former Stanford guard Jamila Wideman will be a
member of the inaugural class of the New England Bas
ketball Hall of Fame.
Wideman was a standout guard while on the Farm,
twice earning first team All-Pacific-10 Conference hon
ors. She still ranks among the school's top-five in assists
(585), steals (255) and games played (127).
After graduating, she played four seasons in the
WNBA in Los Angeles (1997-98), Cleveland (1999) and
Portland (2000).
U.S. brings home fourth consecutive Nordic Cup
The U.S. Women's Under-21 National soccer team
won its fourth-consecutive Nordic Cup on Sunday after
defeating Germany 3-1.
Leading the way in the championship game was Stan
ford senior Marcia Wallis, who scored two of the team's
goals. Her first goal came early in the game as she
knocked a header into the lower left corner of the net.
She collected her second just minutes into the second
half to put the United States up 2-0.
After falling to Denmark 1-0, the U.S. almost forewent
a shot at the championship for the first time in six years.
But the team earned the right to face Germany based on

its goal difference and won its group.
The win marked the fifth time in six years that the
Americans won the Nordic Cup — an event considered
to be the top under-21 competition due to the lack of a
FIFA-sanctioned tournament for this age group.

U.S. brings home fourth consecutive Nordic Cup
The U.S. Women's Under-21 National soccer team
won its fourth-consecutive Nordic Cup on Sunday after
defeating Germany 3-1.
Leading the way in the championship game was Stan
ford senior Marcia Wallis, who scored two of the team's
goals. Her first goal came early in the game as she
knocked a header into the lower left corner of the net.
She collected her second just minutes into the second
half to put the United States up 2-0.
After falling to Denmark 1-0, the U.S. almost forewent
a shot at the championship for the first time in six years.
But the team earned the right to face Germany based on

its goal difference and won its group.
The win marked the fifth time in six years that the
Americans won the Nordic Cup — an event considered
to be the top under-21 competition due to the lack of a
FIFA-sanctioned tournament for this age group.
