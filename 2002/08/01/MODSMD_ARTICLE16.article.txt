## 'Signs' points in the right direction 
### RAMIN SETOODEH EDITORIAL STAFF 
The subterranean style of spook-and-thrill
director M. Night Shyamalan infects the screen
with united wonder in his latest, and perhaps
most ambitious, film "Signs."

the night. But Shyamalan, a master of sus
pense, loads every scene — every joint of the
film — with slow, subversive and suitably sen
sational camerawork.
"Signs" is intense, rich, mesmerizing and it
features one of the best horror movie se
quences of all time. Yet just when it edges to
ward the brink of cinematic magnificence, the
pinnacle of excellence that few movies reach,
does it stumble, tumble even, into a morass of
incredulous melodrama.
In other words, "Signs" is the antithesis of
"The Sixth Sense": The beginning skyrockets
into thriller territory, but the end fizzles and ul
timately disappoints.
That is not to say that the movie, as a whole,
doesn't please. In fact, almost every aspect of

it does — especially the deft characterizations
from a screenplay by Shyamalan and a sly
Hitchcockian score by James Newton
Howard.
The plot develops slowly, but with ad

mirable ease. Mel Gibson stars as Graham
Hess, an Episcopalian minister who loses his
faith after his wife is killed in a brutal car acci-
