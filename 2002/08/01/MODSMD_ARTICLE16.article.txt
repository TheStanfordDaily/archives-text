## 'Signs' points in the right direction

The subterranean style of spook-and-thrill
director M. Night Shyamalan infects the screen
with united wonder in his latest, and perhaps
most ambitious, film "Signs."
Almost never does a filmmaker expect so
much from his viewer by giving him so little, in

film — with slow, subversive and suitably sen
sational camerawork.
"Signs" is intense, rich, mesmerizing and it
features one of the best horror movie se
quences of all time. Yet just when it edges to
ward the brink of cinematic magnificence, the
pinnacle of excellence that few movies reach,
does it stumble, tumble even, into a morass of
incredulous melodrama.
In other words, "Signs" is the antithesis of
"The Sixth Sense": The beginning skyrockets
into thriller territory, but the end fizzles and ul
timately disappoints.

church behind him and dwells, un
employed apparently, on a farm
near Philadelphia with his two chil
dren and younger brother, Merrill
(Joaquin Phoenix).
They are all spooked one morn
ing when a series of enigmatic crop
circles appear in their fields. At first,
Graham thinks that they are the
outcome of a prank hosted by local
teenagers, but similar crop circles
are soon reported around the
world. Perhaps, the characters
begin to believe, supernatural
forces are at play.
"Signs" borrows unquestionably
from Alfred Hitchcock's "The
Birds," just like previous Shya
malan films have always nudged to
ward the style of the great film di
rector. The result, for most of the
picture, is unquestionably eerie —

and Hitchcock, if he were alive
today, would most likely appreciate
the subdued storytelling process.
Another one of Shyamalan's
strong assets, in addition to creating
edge-of-your-seat tension, is the de
velopment of child characters; they
are not merely cardboard cuties
who sit on the corners of the plot,
but intelligent beings who help
string the story line together. In
"Signs," he gives us Graham's son
Morgan (Rory Culkin) and daugh
ter Bo (Abigail Breslin), both of
whom demonstrate acute sensibili
ties not normally afforded to young
supporting actors.
In fact, the entire cast hits the
mark necessary to achieve suspense
in a thriller of this nature. Gibson is
protective and vulnerable, nurtur
ing and wounded; he is the lens
through which the plot unravels.
Cherry Jones, as a police officer
who inspects the house, nicely de
picts the small-roots of the town in
which the film is set. And the young
Breslin, who appears alongside

Culkin, reads each line of dialogue
with guarded sincerity.
It is in the end, and only then,
that "Signs" loses its footing —
and by a margin wide enough to
inspire outrage and indignation
from its viewers. The final scene
does not resonate, as in"The
Sixth Sense," with creepy terror at
what had and had not been re
vealed in the storytelling process.
Nor does it foster understanding,
as in "Unbreakable," of the char
acters and the world in which they
inhabit.
Rather, Shyamalan smashes the
strands of his story line into a mil
lion disconnected pieces: By the
closing credits, nothing coheres,
and the audience witnesses the tired
adage of religious faith dominating
over the forces of evil.
Still, "Signs" works on the funda
mental level of a well-executed
thriller. The strands of the story
never converge, but each scene is
worth examining for the artistic in
genuity that it provides.
