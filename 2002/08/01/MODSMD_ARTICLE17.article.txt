# 'Disguise' fails to mask its fundamental flaws
## 
### PETER KAZANJY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Terrible is a strong word. But drastic
times call for drastic measures. "The Master
of Disguise," starring Dana Carvey, is sim
ply that — terrible. Bad acting can be ex-

cused sometimes.
Poor writing, the
same. But when a
movie actively
strives to insult the
intelligence of its
viewers, even if
ihey are kids, it's
unbearable. •
This movie is
targeted at kids.

However, if I were any older than five years
old, I would have hated it. Further, if I had
a kid of my own, I wouldn't let him watch it
for numerous reasons — not least among

them a major plot element based on sexual
harassment and objectification of women,
the prevalence of blatant and ugly product
placements and a penchant for trying to
make kids dumber.
"Shrek" was a great movie for kids, and
was pretty much appreciated by everyone.

"Master of Disguise" leads
to similar unity, in that pret
ty much everyone should
be repelled by it.
Sexual harassment you're
wondering? Well, Pistachio
Disguisey (Carvey), a young
man who somehow grew up
in New York sharing the
same Italian accent his immi
grant parents have, discov-

ers that he is heir to age-old powers of dis
guise. Clearly he must have an assistant. The

assistant in question turns out to be
leggy Jennifer (Jennifer Esposito).
Apparently though, Pistachio
has a penchant for women with,
well, a little junk in the trunk.
While interviewing potential assis
tants, Pistachio and his grandfa
ther discuss whether or not they
can hire someone who doesn't
have a curvy-enough ass. Yes, in
the interview. Yes, this is what the
future of tomorrow is watching.
Yes, it's deplorable.
But if you're going to be de
plorable, let's go all-out. Jennifer
searches for the villain but not using
any of the traditional spy methods.
No, she shouts across the apart
ment that she's found him on Class
mates.com. As if those pop-ups on
Yahoo! weren't annoying enough,
now they've invaded the Cineplex.
Maybe gender insensitivity can

be forgiven, and maybe they're just
trying to make a buck with the
product placement. But how do
they answer to the charge of active
ly trying to make the next genera
tion of young Americans dumber?
Pistachio's kidnapped father is
being used for his spectacular dis
guising abilities, so that evil Devlin
Bowman (Brent Spiner.. .yes Data
from "Star Trek") can get his
hands on the treasure of America.
First he dresses as Michael John
son to steal the Constitution. Then
he disguises himself as Jesse Ven
tura to thieve the Liberty Bell. But
when he takes on the form of Brit
ney Spears to steal the Apollo 11
lunar lander, it was too much.
Regardless of her multiple tal
ents, even Miss Spears would have
difficulty retrieving something
that's been on the moon ever since
it landed there in 1969. Though
doubtful, perhaps the movie could
have pulled out of such a drastic
nosedive. But I wouldn't know. I
walked out.
