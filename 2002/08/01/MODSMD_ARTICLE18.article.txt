Austin Powers in Goldmember
irirtrC?
To say that "Austin Powers in Gold
member" never climaxes is an un
derstatement.
In his third time around, the Interna
tional Man of Mystery does not shag a sin
gle woman, British or otherwise. This is
odd, considering the other "Austin Pow
ers" films have always found laughs in the
his after-hours pursuits.
So the franchise is feeling flaccid now;
that doesn't mean "Goldmember" doesn't
have some charm.
All the faithful characters are back:
Austin, his arch nemesis Dr. Evil and the
hefty henchman Fat Bastard (all played by
Mike Myers). In this film, Powers tries to
save his long-lost father, Nigel (Michael
Caine), from the evil Goldmember (Myers
in his fourth-billed role.)
The major problem with "Goldmem
ber" is the fact that Austin Powers, the
character, has almost outworn his wel
come. The first film relied on the fish
out-of-water premise and sent Powers, a
spy from the '60s, to the 19905. In the sec
ond film, Powers returned to the past
and the days of disco. By "Goldmember,"
Powers has been back to the future and
back again.
This secret agent clearly has nowhere
left to go.

Road to Perdition
****
Sam Mendes's first film since "Ameri
can Beauty" has been marketed as a
traditional tale about gangsters. But
it's not a gangster movie, not really anyway.
At the core of the film is Tom Hanks
in one of the best performances of his
career. That is a phrase that movie crit
ics like to use often. But Tom Hanks,
who has won two Academy Awards, is al
ways expected to be good. What is sur
prising in "Perdition" is how good he ac
tually is.
Hanks stars as Michael Sullivan, a
man who works for the mob. His boss,
John Rooney (Paul Newman), can be vi
cious and uncompromising, but acts as a
father figure to him. There is a murder.
Then two more and Michael is forced to
flee with his son (Tyler Hoechlin) to the
town of Perdition where he hopes they
can find refuge.
The movie is at times quiet and con
templative, and at other times very vio
lent. But the violence in the movie
works to advance the story line, not to
interfere with it.
The deaths in "Perdition" are portrayed
as cold and unflinching, as they should be,
and Sam Mendes has a gift for building
tension and releasing it at precisely the
right moment.

Stuart Little 2
If you're reading this, odds are that
you're older than the target audience
for "Stuart Little 2" but younger than
the chaperones of said audience.
But don't be so skeptical. "Stuart Little
2" isn't that bad.
In fact, it is quite good. While the origi
nal "Stuart Little" movie (released in 1999)
was targeted solely at the younger audi
ence, it is clear the sequ.el — a true family
picture — has learned from the mistakes
of the first.
In the three years since the first movie,
computer graphics have improved great
ly, and the movie takes advantage of this.
The prominence of the celebrities who
voiced the computer-enhanced charac
ters has also risen. Reprising their roles,
Michael J. Fox ("Spin City") stars as Stu
art Little, while Nathan Lane ("The Pro
ducers") is the voice of Snowbell the fam
ily cat.
The first "Stuart Little" hit home the
message that families are made up of
people who love one another, as dif
ferent as they might be.
To this, the second includes the
adage that loving someone often
means loving him or her enough to set
them free. At least until the next se
quel.

K-19: The Widowmaker
irtrCrC?
Well, it's not as bad as it sounds. "K
-19: The Widowmaker" is crip
pled by a terrible title, but it still
manages to be sporadically entertaining
and even, on occasion, quite moving.
The film, directed by Kathryn
Bigelovv, is set in 1961. Mikhail Polenin
(Liam Neeson), the commander of the
Soviet flagship submarine K-19, is re
moved from his post for not preparing
the vessel quickly enough for its test
run. He is replaced by Alexei Vostrikov
(Harrison Ford), a hard-driving captain
whose father was executed in the Gulag.
The submarine leaves port on schedule,
but then its nuclear reactor springs a
leak near a NATO base.
A core meltdown could cause the war
heads on K-19 to detonate, which would
lead to World War 111.
The story brims with heroism and
tragedy, yet it makes so many mistakes in
telling this tale that its inherent dramatic
power only shines occasionally. Worse still
is the execrable score by Klaus Badelt. He
insists on turning the volume up on every
single emotion, drowning even the film's
best sequences in annoying bombast.
"K-19" doesn't sink, but the voyage isn't
as worthwhile as it could be.
