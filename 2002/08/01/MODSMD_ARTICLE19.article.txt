# BIG BROTHER 3 watch
## 
### 
The third week in the "Big Brother o" household
brought another healthy dosage of smut, scandal
and steamy love triangles that would have the soap
opera Gods spinning in loops. Isn't reality televi
sion marvelous?
Here's what happened:
THURSDAY, JULY 25. The third "live" episode
of the season brought back host Julie Chen in front
of the cameras. We're beginning to think that she
has even less journalistic aptitude than the average
viewer at home, especially since she committed an
other series of unforgivable blunders.
But we mocked her enough last week, so we are
going to have to pass on the cheap shots for now.
Shots that we will discuss, however, are the ones
that Amy gulped down. The ex-beauty pageant
contest apparently loves the bottle

as much as she loves cheese. She's
been clnig chug chugging since
Day One.
Then there was the much-antic
ipated vote for eviction. By a 5-3
tally, Tonya (as we predicted) was
booted out of the house over Josh.
The single mother of five (who
had breast implants five weeks he
fore entering the house) was

shocked. It looks like her falsies weren't as popular
as she'd hoped.
The night came to a close with another inane
Head of Household competition. The winner?
Roddy, the writer, and the only person intelligent
enough to be able to add the weight of 10 house
guests together.
Amy, on the other hand, thought that the other
houseguests would weigh an average of 80 pounds.
Ladies and gentlemen, there's no stopping this
Southern Belle.
SATURDAY, JULY 27. First, the love triangles:

Chiara and Roddy are "dating" (in the most vague,
hooking-up-at-Stanford sense of the word). This,
however, has not stopped Chiara from flirting with
Jason, the self-proclaimed virgin from Mobile Alab.
The two sat in the hammock together and she
fingered his toes. Apparently, she's trying to de
flower Bible boy.
Then there's Marcellas, the gay stylist who has a
crush on Roddy who is already with Chiara even if
she is sometimes with Jason.
Something tells us that the jenny Jones interview

is lurking just around the corner.
Lisa and Eric have also been
sharing a bed and serious person
al space in the last week. Eric has a
girlfriend at home. But, thankful
ly, that doesn't bother these folks
much.
The episode ended with the
toughest decision of Roddy's life.
He needed to decide which two
1 . r

houseguests to nominate for evic
tion. His choices? Amy and (ouch) Marcellas.
Looks like he learned the hard way that love hurts.
WEDNESDAY, JULY 31. Last night, things con
tinued as expected in the Big Brother 3 house.
After another very dull Veto Competition, Eric
emerged victorious.
He decided, subsequently, that he would not use
his veto power maybe because — dull — he's in an
alliance with Roddy.
We also learned (after much anticipation) that
America voted for Marcellas to have dinner with a
houseguest of his choice. He chose Amy. Needless
to say, the bottles of alcoholic beverages were pop
ping faster than a bag full of kernels at the movies.
OUR PREDICTION. Well, here's a no-brainer.
We're guessing the other members of the house
would rather spend time with Marcellas than Amy,
who right now is about one notch less annoying than
the sound of nails screeching against the chalkboard.
Her motto? "I never loved another person the
way I loved myself." How touching. Well, after
tonight, she'll be loving herself outside of the
house, and maybe, if she's sensible — she'll also
check herself into the Betty Ford Clinic.
