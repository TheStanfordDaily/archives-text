Writer/director Sam Raimi's "Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn"
(1987) may not have been the first movie to spoof the horror
genre, but it's indisputably the funniest. And it's hard to resist the
charm of a film that features the hero decapitating his girlfriend in
its first five minutes.

Splatter movies have always hov
ered dangerously close to self-parody,
so Raimi and his co-writer Scott Spiegel
simply give their film a little push over
the edge. "Evil Dead II" is drenched in
blood, guts and all the old favorites, but
here they're used so outrageously that
you can't help but laugh.
This sequel to the ultra-low-budget
"Evil Dead" remakes the first film's
zombies-in-the-forest story line as a
"Three Stooges" comedy with chain
saws. Ash (Bruce Campbell) shacks up
in an abandoned cabin with his girl
friend, hoping fora quite vacation in
the woods. Not surprisingly, all sorts
of hell break loose. Decapitation is
only the beginning.

Although other unlucky characters eventually stumble into the
cabin-o-horrors, the movie's strongest moments come in its first
half hour, when our hero struggles alone against a zombie-fied
girlfriend, a possessed hand and other cheesy manifestations of
the forces of darkness. Campbell, an astonishingly talented physi
cal comedian, is clearly the film's best special effect. The scene in
which he wrestles his own hand has an indescribable, psychotic en
ergy, and no one can say "Groovy" with the same deranged glee.
Add in plenty of monsters, an eerie yet comical score from Joseph
LoDuca and the same fast-paced, visceral direction that Raimi
brought to "Spider-Man," and the result is one of the funniest and
most stomach-churning movies ever made.
The newly-released "Special Edition" DVD includes commen
tary by Raimi, Spiegel, Campbell and makeup supervisor Greg
Nicotero, as well as "The Gore the Merrier," a documentary about
the film's special effects. If you're looking for in-depth analysis, you
won't find it here. Instead, the commentary resembles an episode of
"Mystery Science Theater 3000," as the movie's creators mock the
absurdity of their "splatstick" masterpiece.
