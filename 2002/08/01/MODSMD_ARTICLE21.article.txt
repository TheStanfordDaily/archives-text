# 21 things to do when you're under 21 ...or just young at heart
## 
### AUDREY HARRIS 
It's the third month of the summer. The sun is out. The camp children
are swarming around campus. And you're bored.
What to do?
Palo Alto has a wide selection of restaurants and bars, but that's not what
most college students are looking for — they're yuppy and expensive.
Besides, most of the students on campus are under the age of 21 and,
ahem, no one at Stanford owns a fake ID. So here's a list of the top 21 things
to do this summer if you're under the age of 21 (or just young at heart...)
Cheers.
Swim at DeGuerre Pool
The only Olympic-sized pool on campus is located at the Arrillaga Fam
ily Sports Center on the far east side of campus. Lifeguards are on duty and
admission is free. But best of all, one can often see the Stanford varsity div
ing teams practice their preseason Hips. Nothing beats an afternoon of
watching would-be Olympians hone their skills.
Hours: Noon-6 p.m. daily. If you arrive before 2 p.m., you'll miss the camp kids and
conference goers.
Go to a Giants game at
Pac Bell Park
A bleacher seat at this intimate ballpark offers views of the bay as
well as proximity to San Francisco Giants player Barry Bonds, the
hard-hitting left fielder known for antics and attitude, but you'll be
far enough away from Benito Santiago to avoid being blinded by his
beauty.
Price :$9 fora bleacher seat.
Transportation: Take CalTrain. Train service is unavailable on the weekends this
summer, but a bus service runs on a similar route in its place. For scheduling infor
mation, go to http://untmcaltrain.com.

Rent a DVD in the
basement of Green
Little-known fact alert: Green Library not only checks out
books and research material, but DVDs as well. Two can be
taken out each night for the duration of one night each (re
newals can be done on-line). The selection varies from the clas
sics ("Psycho," for instance) to the modern ("Ali," "Boogie
Nights" and "Mulholland Drive"). The service may be (how
shall we say this nicely?) a little slow, but hey, it beats paying the
rental fees at Blockbuster.
Hours: Vary, check umidibrmy.stnnford.edu
Cost: Free.
Take a stroll in the
Gamble Gardens
Bright, towering flowerbeds fill this historic garden in Palo
Alto. lake a stroll past the clusters of white roses and huge,

en benches are located under sprawling California oak trees,
so you can bring a book and read the morning away.

Go Fountain Hopping
Take off your shoes and jump in the water — it's a well
versed Stanford tradition to beat the hot summer sun.

fountain on campus. There's a handful to choose from. Or,
take a midnight swim with a significantly other, or a few
others.
Eat Yumi Yogurt
It's tasty and fat-free, carbo-lite and low-calorie. Yum. Ok, so
we don't know what's in it, but it's a perfect compliment to a
side salad with no dressing afternoon.

Play the games at
Chuck E. Cheese

those cameras.

the hall — there's no better place for an outdoor sporting
