# Roxy tests your Sass to help you score big
## 
### 
Gray areas abound when it comes to relationships y so Ms. Sass has devised
a quick quiz to help you figure out whether you should be scouting other
prospects or settling in for the long haul.
Are you the perfect pair ?
* To all Roxy's adoring male fans, make the appropriate substitutions
because you'll need the advice as much as the ladies do.

1. There's an encounter on
the horizon. How do you
get ready?
A. You wear an outfit you
know will ruin him, plan your
one-minute hello ahead of
time and make sure your
phone 5 on high.
3. You don your beet pants
based outfit and select a few
revelatory stories to inform
him about your life.
C. You tell him to have dinner
ready, pick up a movie and
hope he notices you're wear
ing his favorite perfume.
P. You throw on your sweats
and settle in to wait for him
over Rocky Road and "Road
Rules."
2. You'd love to see your guy
this Saturday night. How
do you make it happen?
A. You go home after a girls'
night out, leave him a racy
voicemail and change into
nothing but your shortest
black dress when you get the
late-night invite.
3. You call the day before with
Mostly 7
So you enjoy back-breaking
sex in the wee hours of the morn
ing and sneak out before your
partner's friends have a chance to
catch you in the elevator. It's the
perfect arrangement: no public
drama, no awkward morning
after, just the thrill of a killer late
night romp. Don't despair;
there's no shame in it.
This is the kind of sex we all
should have once (or a hundred
times, if Ms. Sass's experience is
any indication). There's nothing
tender about it, and that's the best
part. Let him throw you against
the wall, hang you off the side of
the bed, explore the limits of your
flexibility and spur you to breathy
affirmations of his skill. Raw is
good — that is, as long as every
one's on the same page.

a planned group activity, in
sist on a dinner out and do
your all-around best to avoid
going home until there's
nothing left to do but hook up.
C. You call him Saturday af
ternoon, complain that you
don't have plans and protest
just enough to make him ride
to the rescue.
P. You give his schedule a
mental once-over and drop by
with McDonald's when you
know he'll be lounging.
3. You walk in the door together
after an evening of hanging
out. What's the first thing
you do?
A. You continue the make-out
session that started in the
driveway while you sweep off
the counter/coffee table/
floor and collapse onto it.
3. You talk to his roommate
fora respectable few minutes
before heading to bed for the
standard nightcap.
C. You pop in a movie and
change into pajamas to
snuggle fora while and
share a few tender good-
If you're both between rela
tionships and in need of an in
spired, but uncomplicated, outlet
for your sexual frustrations, then
more power to you. But if one of
you is laying it down Wilt Cham
berlain-style while the other is
hoping against hope for the obvi
ously inevitable marriage propos
al, the situation may merit a sec
ond look.
And girls, while it's true that sex
is sex is sex, the only real differ
ence between a ho and an empow
ered woman is approach, so make
sure you're meeting your man
after-hours because you want to,
not because you're trying to moti
vate him to revelations of love.
Finally, keep in mind that the
charm of the sex-only relation
ship is just that: It's just sex. So
the likelihood of turning it into an
enduring romance usually is and
probably should be zero.
There's a reason whv vou two

night kisses.
P. You debrief each other on
the evening over greasy food
and end a tired night in the
same bed under separate
blankets.
4. The highlight of your night
together is:
A. Orgasm, orgasm, orgasm!
3. Learning his middle name.
C. Second base.
P. Talking about other possi
ble hook-ups.
5. It's the morning after, and
you:
A. Wake up in your own bed,
having high-tailed it out of his
place shortly after the after
hook-up afterglow began to
fade.
3. Rush to the bathroom to
wash off your mascara and
rectify your hair situation be
fore he sees you.
C. Spoon for an hour before
making breakfast together.
P. Open the blinds, turn on
ESPN and punch him periodi
cally till he wakes up to drive
you home.
don't spend time together in the
light — the attraction is animal,
and it works best that way. Take
advantage of the situation now
and accept happily that it's re
membered best years into a lov
ing marriage as a hot stretch of
college nights that set your sex
bar appropriately high.

Maybe he played romantic
Brazilian music on your first date,
or maybe you two made a connec
tion at a party, but regardless of the
circumstances, you made the dan
gerous decision to sleep with an ac
quaintance that you want to con
tinue to see in the future. Now the
caring must catch up to the pas
sion, and the sex is gradually going
to decrease in urgency and in

crease in emotion. The music may
turn to opera and parties might be
come quiet dinners, but make sure
you remember that initial "I can't
not have you" intensity.
Consider yourself lucky. Most
couples spend months trying to
get the sex right, while you get
the backdrop of post-coital bliss to
paint a picture-perfect relation
ship. After you catch your breath,
whisper a compliment as you
snuggle up to him in bed. Your
task: Add substance without los
ing color. If you invest in some
quality vertical time, the horizon
tal can be much more worthwhile.
Know that every hook-up
doesn't have to turn into a rela
tionship, but if you want to make
it work, you can. Okay, so you
can't keep your hands off each
other, but try to schedule activities
out of the house so that you can
get to know each other with your
clothes on. Pencil your partner
into your day as much as you've
written him into your evenings.
Add friends to the mix — group
activities are a great way to show
case the most real and compelling
parts of your personality.
While your spring fling may
have started on a more immedi
ate physical note, use lazy sum
mer days to explore the possibili
ty of a few extended movements.
But remember, if things don't
work out, you still enjoyed some
hot nights with a cool guy.
Mostly C' s ?
So you have tried to successful
ly convert a friend into a lover,
and probably with mixed results.
In this situation, your friend —
the one who makes you laugh,
quotes movie lines with you and
generally "gets you" — became a
hook-up. Be sure not to confuse
this relationship with a sex buddy
arrangement; you two know each
other well and you should expect
good (if not great) sex that is
laden with inside jokes and play
ful banter.
Your hook-ups may be playful,
but be sure not to play games, be
cause this relationship will have
repercussions far beyond your
ability to get consistent booty. Un
less you're friends with the cast of
"Dawson's Creek," your pairing
will probably create some tension
among your circle, so try to mini
mize the drama.
Be fun, but don't laugh when
you're hitting the sheets. It's easy
to fall into the comfortable
rhythm in bed that you have dur
ing ballgames, but nothing will
send your relationship into early
retirement as quickly as reminisc
ing about your many shared em
barrassing escapades.

He may always look at you as a
friend first — and that isn't nec
essarily a bad thing — but that
doesn't mean you can't also star
in his hottest fantasies. Let him
follow your lead as your sweet
Charlotte gets recast as a sexy
Samantha.

Face it: You and your some
time make-out partner are simply
endearingly confused best
friends. It's easy to look at those
caring blue eyes and broad per
fect-to-cry-on shoulders and
imagine that they could belong to
the future father of your children,
but reliability alone does not a
good boyfriend make.
Of course, your friends will tell
you that your perfect friendship
with Mr. Wonderful is just a pas
sionate evening away from being
the ideal relationship. Don't be
fooled. You and your buddy are
close enough that, if sex was in
the cards, you'd both know it and
would likely have already dis
cussed or even had it. The fact
that you haven't done the nasty
isn't just about circumstance —
"he's too shy," "she likes to take it
slow" — it's about your natural
connection, which is fundamen
tally non-sexual.
Whether you take Ms. Sass's
word for it or not, it's probably not
worth the risk of ruining a lifelong
friendship to find out. As we all
learned from the famous Kyle
and-Keri debacle on "Real World:
Chicago," when friends become
lovers (or almost lovers, or snug
gle buddies, or whatever, Kyle)
and things go awry, the damage is
always ugly and often irreparable.
Ms. Sass's advice? Stop imagin
ing the possibilities and start ap
preciating the good fortune of
achieving the practically mythical
co-ed best-friendship.
-The Bottom Line-
No matter which category your
current hook-up falls into, there's
always room for improvement.
The ideal relationship isn't even
on Ms. Sass's list, as if you were in
it, you wouldn't need this column
at all.
The best-case scenario is, of
course, meeting someone you
don't know terribly well, going
out on a few dates with the shared
hope for romance, and gradually
building both the emotional and
physical aspects of your relation
ship at a matching rate.
Until the time when such
healthy outlooks are in large sup
ply, though, know your relation
ship and plan ahead. Roxy-style.
