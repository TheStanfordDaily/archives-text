## Quest Scholars learn about college and service 
### ANTHONY HA STAFF WRITER 
This Saturday, 21 high-school stu
dents will graduate from the five-week
Quest Scholars Program, joining a group
of graduates that will include 85 Stanford
students come this fall. Every summer,
Quest attempts to bring underserved
high-schoolers to the Stanford campus,
putting them through a rigorous envi
ronmental science-centered curriculum,
as well as assisting with their personal and
professional growth.
Michael McCullough, the co-founder
and co-president of Quest , along with his
wife, Ana Rowena Mallari McCullough,
said that they conceived of Quest when
they met while studying overseas at Ox
ford.
"We wanted a hobby that we could
work on together," he said. Because
Michael McCullough had already co
founded the Stanford Medical Youth Sci
ence Program, "it made sense [for me] to
do the same sort of thing that I was in
volved in before."
The result was the Stanford Youth En
vironmental Science Program, founded
in 1988. When a separate chapter of
SYESP opened at Harvard in 2000, the
program's name was changed to Quest to
indicate that the endeavor was not solely
affiliated with Stanford University. Exec
utive director Sarah Chandler said that
Quest ran for two summers on the East
Coast, and that Harvard is currently con
sidering starting a similar program on its
own.

Chandler, a 2000 Stanford graduate
with a bachelor's degree in earth systems,
first became interested in the program
after seeing a flier in her dormitory's
bathroom.
"One of my drawmates saw it and said,
'This program is you. You have to
apply,"' she said. "1 was really drawn to
the environmental focus, but then kind of
tapped into the culture of warmth here."
Chandler said that Quest uses several
methods to try to get its application into
the hands of intelligent but underserved
and at-risk youth. One method is a PSAT
search. Another solicits students through
teacher recommendations and the pro
gram's Web site (www.questscholars.org).
This year, 21 high-school stu
dents were chosen from 2300 applicants,
through a process that involves extensive
personal and group interviews, in addi
tion to the lengthy written application.
Once the program begins, Quest stu
dents are housed at Lambda Nu, which is
staffed by 19 in-house counselors. Chan
dler estimated that, if professors, men
tors and out-of-house counselors are
counted, the staff-to-student ratio is 110
to 21.
Chandler divided Quest's curriculum
into four parts. The first revolves around
environmental science and consists of
one to three lectures a day, reading, es
says and other academic activities. The
second part of the curriculum attempts to
prepare students for college, with lec
tures and activities discussing topics like
SAT preparation and lecture notes.
"The third aspect is our public service

curriculum, and it's kind of how we justi
fy having such a hands-on approach to
such a small number of students," Chan
dler said. Quest graduates are required
to develop a public service project in their
home community. Funded jointly by the
program and a group that helps young
people launch enterprises called Youth
Venture, past projects have included
sending relief packages to AIDS orphans
in Africa, starting environmental clubs
and creating multilingual brochures for

health care. Graduates are also required
to start a larger-scale outreach project at
some point in their lives.
"It's important to us that they see
Quest as an exchange, not something
that's a handout or something free that
we give them," Chandler said, "because
that doesn't seem to foster good senti
ments from either side."
The final aspect of the Quest curricu-

lum focuses on personal growth.
One hour is set aside each clay
for personal reflection, during
which students might, among
other possibilities, write, draw,
sing or pray. Students also listen
to lectures focusing on self-ex
amination and exploration.
Quest's administrators say
they hope to hold two or three
sessions next summer and ex
pand even further in years to
come. In addition, the program
is using local professionals to ex
pand its mentoring capabilities
for both current students and
graduates.
"It's a very exciting time in
Quest," Ana McCullough said.
"We're trying to build it so it can
last, so that it has a sustainable
structure and sustainable finan
cial systems."
Michael Umpierre, a direct
ing partner at Quest, said that
his story is an example of how
the program can empower at
risk students. Born and raised in
Burbank, Calif, by his Cuban
immigrant parents, Umpierre
attended Quest in 1997.
"I came from a very support
ive home, but I felt like I needed
information about college," he
said. "I think what I lacked was

social capital. That was one of
the more important things
about QUEST for me as a stu
dent: It was able to bridge gaps
of information that were really
kind of relevant in my life and
enabled me to attend Stanford."
Umpierre graduated from
Stanford last June with a bache
lor's degree in public policy. As a
recipient of Stanford's John
Gardner Public Service Fellow
ship, he will work next year in
Washington, D.C., at the Youth
Law Center. He said he hopes to
eventually become an advocate
for children in poverty, a goal he
chose while working at Quest.
"I had an epiphany, in some
sense of the word," he said. "I
was a counselor and I became
friends with one of the students.
She ultimately revealed that she
was abused at home. It hit me
like a ton ofbricks. I mean, I had
always known that abuse hap
pened, but this was my first ex
perience with it. And I realized
that that was something that I
wanted to change."
Michael McCullough, dis
cussing Quest's focus on em
powerment, said, "We present a
ladder for the kids to climb up,
but it's not an escalator."
"I can't teach hunger, but it's
tragic if you have that hunger
that's not hooked up to support.
That's the niche that Quest
serves; it's a bridge of support."

cussing Quest's focus on em
powerment, said, "We present a
ladder for the kids to climb up,
but it's not an escalator."
"I can't teach hunger, but it's
tragic if you have that hunger
that's not hooked up to support.
That's the niche that Quest
serves; it's a bridge of support."
This Saturday, 21 high-school stu
dents will graduate from the five-week
Quest Scholars Program, joining a group
of graduates that will include 85 Stanford
students come this fall. Every summer,
Quest attempts to bring underserved
high-schoolers to the Stanford campus,
putting them through a rigorous envi
ronmental science-centered curriculum,
as well as assisting with their personal and
professional growth.
Michael McCullough, the co-founder
and co-president of Quest , along with his
wife, Ana Rowena Mallari McCullough,
said that they conceived of Quest when
they met while studying overseas at Ox
ford.
"We wanted a hobby that we could
work on together," he said. Because
Michael McCullough had already co
founded the Stanford Medical Youth Sci
ence Program, "it made sense [for me] to
do the same sort of thing that I was in
volved in before."
The result was the Stanford Youth En
vironmental Science Program, founded
in 1988. When a separate chapter of
SYESP opened at Harvard in 2000, the
program's name was changed to Quest to
indicate that the endeavor was not solely
affiliated with Stanford University. Exec
utive director Sarah Chandler said that
Quest ran for two summers on the East
Coast, and that Harvard is currently con
sidering starting a similar program on its
own.

Chandler, a 2000 Stanford graduate
with a bachelor's degree in earth systems,
first became interested in the program
after seeing a flier in her dormitory's
bathroom.
"One of my drawmates saw it and said,
'This program is you. You have to
apply,"' she said. "1 was really drawn to
the environmental focus, but then kind of
tapped into the culture of warmth here."
Chandler said that Quest uses several
methods to try to get its application into
the hands of intelligent but underserved
and at-risk youth. One method is a PSAT
search. Another solicits students through
teacher recommendations and the pro
gram's Web site (www.questscholars.org).
This year, 21 high-school stu
dents were chosen from 2300 applicants,
through a process that involves extensive
personal and group interviews, in addi
tion to the lengthy written application.
Once the program begins, Quest stu
dents are housed at Lambda Nu, which is
staffed by 19 in-house counselors. Chan
dler estimated that, if professors, men
tors and out-of-house counselors are
counted, the staff-to-student ratio is 110
to 21.
Chandler divided Quest's curriculum
into four parts. The first revolves around
environmental science and consists of
one to three lectures a day, reading, es
says and other academic activities. The
second part of the curriculum attempts to
prepare students for college, with lec
tures and activities discussing topics like
SAT preparation and lecture notes.
"The third aspect is our public service

curriculum, and it's kind of how we justi
fy having such a hands-on approach to
such a small number of students," Chan
dler said. Quest graduates are required
to develop a public service project in their
home community. Funded jointly by the
program and a group that helps young
people launch enterprises called Youth
Venture, past projects have included
sending relief packages to AIDS orphans
in Africa, starting environmental clubs
and creating multilingual brochures for

health care. Graduates are also required
to start a larger-scale outreach project at
some point in their lives.
"It's important to us that they see
Quest as an exchange, not something
that's a handout or something free that
we give them," Chandler said, "because
that doesn't seem to foster good senti
ments from either side."

lum focuses on personal growth.
One hour is set aside each clay
for personal reflection, during
which students might, among
other possibilities, write, draw,
sing or pray. Students also listen
to lectures focusing on self-ex
amination and exploration.
Quest's administrators say
they hope to hold two or three
sessions next summer and ex
pand even further in years to
come. In addition, the program
is using local professionals to ex
pand its mentoring capabilities
for both current students and
graduates.
"It's a very exciting time in
Quest," Ana McCullough said.
"We're trying to build it so it can
last, so that it has a sustainable
structure and sustainable finan
cial systems."
Michael Umpierre, a direct
ing partner at Quest, said that
his story is an example of how
the program can empower at
risk students. Born and raised in
Burbank, Calif, by his Cuban
immigrant parents, Umpierre
attended Quest in 1997.
"I came from a very support
ive home, but I felt like I needed
information about college," he
said. "I think what I lacked was

social capital. That was one of
the more important things
about QUEST for me as a stu
dent: It was able to bridge gaps
of information that were really
kind of relevant in my life and
enabled me to attend Stanford."
Umpierre graduated from
Stanford last June with a bache
lor's degree in public policy. As a
recipient of Stanford's John
Gardner Public Service Fellow
ship, he will work next year in
Washington, D.C., at the Youth
Law Center. He said he hopes to
eventually become an advocate
for children in poverty, a goal he
chose while working at Quest.
"I had an epiphany, in some
sense of the word," he said. "I
was a counselor and I became
friends with one of the students.
She ultimately revealed that she
was abused at home. It hit me
like a ton ofbricks. I mean, I had
always known that abuse hap
pened, but this was my first ex
perience with it. And I realized
that that was something that I
wanted to change."
