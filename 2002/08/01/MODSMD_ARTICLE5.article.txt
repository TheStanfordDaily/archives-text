## Quest Scholars learn about college and service 
### ANTHONY HA STAFF WRITER 
This Saturday, 21 high-school stu
dents will graduate from the five-week
Quest Scholars Program, joining a group
of graduates that will include 85 Stanford
students come this fall. Every summer,
Quest attempts to bring underserved
high-schoolers to the Stanford campus,
putting them through a rigorous envi
ronmental science-centered curriculum,
as well as assisting with their personal and
professional growth.
Michael McCullough, the co-founder
and co-president of Quest , along with his
wife, Ana Rowena Mallari McCullough,
said that they conceived of Quest when
they met while studying overseas at Ox
ford.
"We wanted a hobby that we could
work on together," he said. Because
Michael McCullough had already co
founded the Stanford Medical Youth Sci
ence Program, "it made sense [for me] to
do the same sort of thing that I was in
volved in before."
The result was the Stanford Youth En
vironmental Science Program, founded
in 1988. When a separate chapter of
SYESP opened at Harvard in 2000, the
program's name was changed to Quest to
indicate that the endeavor was not solely
affiliated with Stanford University. Exec
utive director Sarah Chandler said that
Quest ran for two summers on the East
Coast, and that Harvard is currently con
sidering starting a similar program on its
own.

Chandler, a 2000 Stanford graduate
with a bachelor's degree in earth systems,
first became interested in the program
after seeing a flier in her dormitory's
bathroom.
"One of my drawmates saw it and said,
'This program is you. You have to
apply,"' she said. "1 was really drawn to
the environmental focus, but then kind of
tapped into the culture of warmth here."
Chandler said that Quest uses several
methods to try to get its application into
the hands of intelligent but underserved
and at-risk youth. One method is a PSAT
search. Another solicits students through
teacher recommendations and the pro
gram's Web site (www.questscholars.org).
This year, 21 high-school stu
dents were chosen from 2300 applicants,
through a process that involves extensive
personal and group interviews, in addi
tion to the lengthy written application.
Once the program begins, Quest stu
dents are housed at Lambda Nu, which is
staffed by 19 in-house counselors. Chan
dler estimated that, if professors, men
tors and out-of-house counselors are
counted, the staff-to-student ratio is 110
to 21.
Chandler divided Quest's curriculum
into four parts. The first revolves around
environmental science and consists of
one to three lectures a day, reading, es
says and other academic activities. The
second part of the curriculum attempts to
prepare students for college, with lec
tures and activities discussing topics like
SAT preparation and lecture notes.
"The third aspect is our public service

curriculum, and it's kind of how we justi
fy having such a hands-on approach to
such a small number of students," Chan
dler said. Quest graduates are required
to develop a public service project in their
home community. Funded jointly by the
program and a group that helps young
people launch enterprises called Youth
Venture, past projects have included
sending relief packages to AIDS orphans
in Africa, starting environmental clubs
and creating multilingual brochures for

health care. Graduates are also required
to start a larger-scale outreach project at
some point in their lives.
"It's important to us that they see
Quest as an exchange, not something
that's a handout or something free that
we give them," Chandler said, "because
that doesn't seem to foster good senti
ments from either side."
