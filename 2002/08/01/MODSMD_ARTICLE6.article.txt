# Stanford reacts to Princeton-Yale admissions scandal

### ERIN ARCHERD EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford University's admissions infor
mation is secure, said Dean of Admissions
and Financial Aid Robin Mamlet, after the
recent exposure of misconduct by Prince
ton University's Undergraduate Admis
sions Office.
This past April — when most students
were eagerly awaiting notification of ad
mission to their chosen universities —
Princeton's Director of Admissions
Stephen E. LeMenager illegally entered a
Web site designed by Yale University to
notify students of their status. Yale, Prince
ton's greatest rival in undergraduate ad
missions, filed a complaint with the Feder
al Bureau of Investigation on July 25.
Using the birth dates and Social Securi
ty numbers of Princeton applicants who
also applied to Yale, LeMenager gained ac
cess to the Yale Web site.
While Stanford does have a Web site for ad
mits, it does not notify of admission on the
Web.

"We are very careful to protect the pri
vacy of out entire applicant pool, " Mamlet
said, when asked about the security of the
applicants' information.
"And we do not make any information
available via commonly accessible traits,
such as Social Security Number or birth
date," she emphasized.
Princeton officials called LeMenager's
actions a "serious lapse in judgment."
This was the first year for Yale's ad
missions Web site, which was designed to
display congratulations if the prospective
student was admitted or a consolation
message if they were not accepted. The
Web site also had information about ex
tracurricular and academic interests.
Only applicants were allowed to log on to
the site.
Some contended that the incident was
prompted by competition between the two
schools for students. Princeton had 14,521
applications fora class of 1,160, and Yale
had 15,400 applications fora class of 1,300,
less than one in 10 for each school.
Stanford has a similar rate of admission

for its freshman class. For the Class of
2005, there were 19,052 applicants and
1,616 entering freshmen. The general ad
mission rate was 12.6%.
Dean Mamlet said she feels that Stan
ford does not compete against other
schools, but encourages students to enroll.
"Our starting point is not that we are
competing with other institutions," she
said.
"We are not out to 'get' students and be
sure they don't enroll elsewhere; rather,
we work hard to be sure that Stanford
emerges compellingly so that students who
are right for us will choose to enroll."
Stanford's yield of 679 c for the Class of
2005 is very high, and rivaled only by a few
Ivy League institutions, notably Harvard
and Princeton.
"Students admitted to both Stanford
and Harvard will frequently choose Stan
ford, but more often choose Harvard. Stu
dents admitted to Stanford and Princeton
split about 50/50. Students admitted to
Stanford and other institutions most often
choose Stanford," Mamlet said.

Still, Mamlet doesn't see any rivalry be
tween Stanford and other elite universities.
"To be frank, we don't think of it as 'ri
vals,' but our biggest competition does
come from Harvard," she admitted.
Other schools, like the University of
Pennsylvania, have set up Web sites for
prospective students, but these sites re
quire passwords rather than easily ob
tained birth dates and Social Security
Numbers.
Harvard University informs its students
of admission status via e-mail, which it be
lieves is more secure. Stanford only e-mails
notification to international admits, to
compensate for slow mail service.
Stanford is considering a Web-based
system in which students can see if their ap
plication is complete, but has not yet con
sidered online notification of the actual ad
mission decision, Mamlet said.
"1 regret that the actions of one of my
colleagues may cause students to feel that
they are being 'watched' by other institu
tions," she said.
"Stanford would never do this."
