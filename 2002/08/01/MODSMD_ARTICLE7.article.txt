lii some respects, they could not be any
more different. The first celebrates its 30-
th anniversary and is a six-week extrava
ganza for the ears and eyes. The second is
the first of its kind, a week-long tutorial for
the body that strives to hone technique
and rhythm. Yet both the annual Stanford
Jazz Festival and the first-ever Waltz Week
typify midsummer events that aim to edify
the minds and please the souls of their
participants.
Waltz Week, held primarily in the
Roble Dance Studio, teaches the many
variations of the waltz. Considered vulgar
and immoral when the dance was first in
troduced in the late 1700s, the waltz is now
a mainstay at Stanford, as it is taught in
numerous Social Dance classes and is a key
component of the Viennese Ball.
"Everyone comes to the waltz fora dif
ferent reason," said Richard Powers, a
dance instructor at Stanford and the orga
nizer of this first Waltz Week. "Some like it
for the romance. Some might like it for the
trance-like euphoric state. The repetitive
nature of the waltz can create quite a dif
ferent physical sensation, which you don't
find in other dances."
"I've been leading Waltz Weekends
around the country for five years, and the

interest has been steadily building, to the
point that dancers from across the country
wanted a full week, not just a weekend,"
Powers said.
In addition to Waltz Week, Stanford is
host to six weeks of jazz courtesy of the
Stanford Jazz Workshop. Holding several
free concerts outside Tressider Union and
in the Coffee House, the Stanford Jazz
Festival highlights a mix of jazz styles, in
cluding the world premiere of Bata Ketu.
Ketu, a performer who displays the evolu
tion of Africa's Yoruban Music in Brazil
and Cuba, is set to perform on Aug. 1.
"We retained our typical format for this
year's festival, presenting 33 concerts be
tween the final weekend of June and the
middle of August," said Carina Berglund,
associate director of the Stanford Jazz
Workshop and Festival. "We also retained
the festival's traditional focus of present
ing both jazz legends and emerging new
talents playing a full range of jazz styles
from early, traditional jazz to Afro-Cuban
to avant-garde to straight-ahead."
Fhe festival, which ends Aug. 10, will
feature several staples of jazz, including
Kenny Garrett, Sam Rivers, Jimmy Cobb
and Christian Mcßride.

notes the differences between this

"There is a cohesive spirit that is
building through this week by stay
ing with one subject day and
night," Powers said. "Stanford day
time classes only briefly touch on a
subject, and other dance weeks
usually cover a wide variety of
dances. The Waltz Week is build
ing a sustained emotional connec
tion between the dancers and a
stronger resonance with the spirit
of waltzing."
Sid Hetzler, who began waltzing
more than a decade ago, said that
Waltz Week allows for an immer
sion that is not normally available.
"[This week] allows much more
variety from the instructors," Het
zler, a founder of the Atlanta Waltz
Society, said. "You really learn re
discovering, using old forms in new
ways ... Unlike other times, what
you're learning is not choreo
graphed, but an improvised step."
Berglund, rather than stressing
the differences between the Jazz

festival and other performances,
focuses on a similarity.
"One of our participants recent
ly said to me in the hallway: This is
as close to New York as you can get

without getting on a plane,'"
Berglund said. "He was referring
to the tremendous wealth of artists
and style one can hear on any given
night."
