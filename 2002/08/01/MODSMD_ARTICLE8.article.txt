## DISPATCHES FROM THE OUTER DARKNESS Living with chicks in the years betwixt 
### MARK GANEK STAFF COLUMNIST 
The parched earth stretches out
before you, cracked from the sun's
withering onslaught. A blurred
vision of an oasis hovers in the dis
tance, but it has fooled you too
many times for you to take it as
truth. You trudge onwards — what
other choice do you have? Your
legs give way suddenly, and you fall
to your knees, clawing feebly at the
air. You should never have come
here. But you had no choice. It is
the scabrous wasteland known as
the Early Twenties.
These years exist only to be a
sort of connective tissue linking you
to the rest of your life. Other than
that, they create a shadowy nether
world of existence, defined only as
a void between other things.
In truth, I was really a bit sur
prised by my own lack of tangible
plans. I had unwittingly internal
ized all those auspicious speeches
about my refulgent future after

graduation, and I was a bit sur
prised it wasn't waiting tor me
along with my diploma, perhaps in
a glitter-labeled goodie bag.
Of course, not everyone is bare
ly existing in the metaphysical non
space. There are those cheerfully
purposeful wunderkinder who
know exactly what they want and
churn on unceasingly toward it,
lives pre-scheduled though retire
ment in 15-minute increments.
I am convinced that these "peo
ple" are actually flesh-eating
cyborgs who are in the midst of a
world takeover. Okay, I don't have
proof that they literally eat flesh,
but I think flesh-eating is standard
on the '03 Nissan Cyborg, so it's a
reasonably safe bet.
My quasi-existence is currently
centered on a three-legged couch
in an apartment where a few nice
women have agreed to take me in,
presumably because they were
offered a free pass to Heaven by
God himself. God wants to keep
me alive as long as possible so He

doesn't have to be my Roommate.
"Lo, I ask ye, My heavenly host,
who spilled Ramen on the harps?"
I am a less-than-ideal room
mate. Whereas most people tend
to view raised horizontal surfaces
as places to work, eat or read, I
use them mainly for crucial wrap
per storage or as a handy exami
nation area for checking on my
ingrown toenail.
This summer is not my first
foray in inter-gender living spaces,
and living with women over the
years has taught me a great many
things. For instance, I am a chow
derhead. I suppose that I am a
congenital chowderhead, but it
was only living with women that
made me conscious of my natural
gift for having a brain composed
of a creamy, potato-based soup.
One particular summer, I spent
the better part of two months care
fully avoiding the roommate who
obviously had a major crush on me,
so as not to disturb the apartment
ecosystem. After weeks of heroic

avoidance, I finally unburdened my
soul to another roommate. Her
response was instructive: "You do
realize she's a lesbian?"
"Odd that she would have a
crush on me," I replied.
"You also realize that she's my
girlfriend?" I had not realized that.
Not only disabusing me of spu
rious crush notions, my female
roommates also bestowed invalu
able advice when I made forays
into the dating sphere.
"Stop being a chowderhead,"
they would say. "Just fora few
hours." Unfortunately, this proved
constitutionally impossible.
I've never been very good with
advice, anyway. I think my favorite
piece of advice is, "I've got to learn
to enjoy the finer things in life."
Now that's good advice. I recall
one particular night, I went out for
a bottle of Dom Perignon and a filet
mignon, simply because the combi
nation of the letter "g" and the let
ter "n" was a theme for me that
evening.

Later, I took a spin in my Ferrari
and picked up the bikini-model
triplets I was dating, and we made
wild jungle-ferret love for about
three hours. And afterward, I
remember sitting on the edge of
the bed with my head in my hands,
weeping fierce, bitter tears, saying
over and over, "If only I could
enjoy this."
I think the real trick would be
learning to enjoy the terrible
things in life. Like your early
twenties betweenness. Or if that's
too hard, start with the flesh-eat
ing cyborgs. But if I may wax
philosophic fora moment, I sup
pose that the nature of man is to
exist in between — the bright
spark of life between the vast dark
nesses of birth and death, past and
future, earth and sky. Behold the
path of Chowderhead Zen.

offered a free pass to Heaven by
God himself. God wants to keep
me alive as long as possible so He

doesn't have to be my Roommate.
"Lo, I ask ye, My heavenly host,
who spilled Ramen on the harps?"
I am a less-than-ideal room
mate. Whereas most people tend
to view raised horizontal surfaces
as places to work, eat or read, I
use them mainly for crucial wrap
per storage or as a handy exami
nation area for checking on my
ingrown toenail.
This summer is not my first
foray in inter-gender living spaces,
and living with women over the
years has taught me a great many
things. For instance, I am a chow
derhead. I suppose that I am a
congenital chowderhead, but it
was only living with women that
made me conscious of my natural
gift for having a brain composed
of a creamy, potato-based soup.
One particular summer, I spent
the better part of two months care
fully avoiding the roommate who
obviously had a major crush on me,
so as not to disturb the apartment
ecosystem. After weeks of heroic

avoidance, I finally unburdened my
soul to another roommate. Her
response was instructive: "You do
realize she's a lesbian?"
"Odd that she would have a
crush on me," I replied.
"You also realize that she's my
girlfriend?" I had not realized that.
Not only disabusing me of spu
rious crush notions, my female
roommates also bestowed invalu
able advice when I made forays
into the dating sphere.
"Stop being a chowderhead,"
they would say. "Just fora few
hours." Unfortunately, this proved
constitutionally impossible.
I've never been very good with
advice, anyway. I think my favorite
piece of advice is, "I've got to learn
to enjoy the finer things in life."
Now that's good advice. I recall
one particular night, I went out for
a bottle of Dom Perignon and a filet
mignon, simply because the combi
nation of the letter "g" and the let
ter "n" was a theme for me that
evening.

Later, I took a spin in my Ferrari
and picked up the bikini-model
triplets I was dating, and we made
wild jungle-ferret love for about
three hours. And afterward, I
remember sitting on the edge of
the bed with my head in my hands,
weeping fierce, bitter tears, saying
over and over, "If only I could
enjoy this."
I think the real trick would be
learning to enjoy the terrible
things in life. Like your early
twenties betweenness. Or if that's
too hard, start with the flesh-eat
ing cyborgs. But if I may wax
philosophic fora moment, I sup
pose that the nature of man is to
exist in between — the bright
spark of life between the vast dark
nesses of birth and death, past and
future, earth and sky. Behold the
path of Chowderhead Zen.
