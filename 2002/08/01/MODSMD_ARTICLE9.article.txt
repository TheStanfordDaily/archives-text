# Surrounded by a moat in the middle of Manhattan

### ANNA-CHRISTINA DOUGLAS GUEST COLUMNIST 
Kim Catrall is just as tall and
good-looking in real life as she is
on TV. Supposedly, she wears
more make-up, but I couldn't
tell. I only saw her back as she
walked past me and two fellow
interns. We were grabbing lunch
while we staked-out the "Sex and
the City" set. As we sat on a
stoop at the corner of 93rd St.
and Madison Ave., I was far too
engrossed in my designer salad
to look up and catch Samantha as
she blew by me.
New York is filming country,
especially during the summer
and, in particular, near the
Cooper-Hewitt National Design
Museum (part of the Smithsonian
Institution), where I am working
this summer. The Education
Department lecture room is act
ing as the extras holding area,
and arrowed signs point the way
to the set where extras with
empty Bergdorf-Goodman bags
and borrowed puppies will walk
and re-walk down the block. Last

week, the front facade of the
Museum played the role of Pryce
Academy in the upcoming
Brittany Murphy blockbuster,
"Molly Gunn." I even had to
wade through a sea of plaid-skirt
ed girls with fake monogrammed
jumpers to get to the moat where
I work.
But the real heart of my sum
mer has not been the glitz of film
crews or the star sightings. It has
been working on amazing proj
ects in a moat. Seriously. The
Andrew Carnegie Mansion that
houses Cooper-Hewitt was built
at the turn of the 20th century
with a protective stone moat
around it. The moat never held
any water, but it is murder for my
cell-phone reception. It is here,
with a staff of fewer than 10 and
a budget tight enough to make a
Daily staffer weep, that some
amazing programs and discover
ies have been taking place.
The event that has gotten the
most press by far has been the
discovery of an unsigned
Michelangelo chalk drawing in
the archives. Found in April by a
visiting scholar from Scotland, its

authorship was unanimously
confirmed several weeks ago by
an international group of
experts. It is a sketched plan for
a six-foot-tall, seven-armed can
delabra, although the arms are
implied, replete with seraphim
and cherubs. The masterful ren
dering of even the toes on the
figures are breathtaking.
Luckily, I had the chance to see
the sketch during the staff view
ing. I have also fielded calls
about it from inquiring New
Yorkers: "When is it going on
display?"
"They haven't announced that
y et -"
"How much is it worth?"
"Ten to 12 million dollars."
"How much did they buy it
for?"
"Under $60."
"Any more lying around?"
"No."
The excitement of the discov
ery overshadowed the announce
ment of the National Design
Awards, another event based at
Cooper-Hewitt. This was fol
lowed closely by the preparation
for the Summer Design Institute,

a conference for teachers with
designers and design educators.
The week of July 15 to July 19
brought over 100 participants to
the National Design Museum to
hear speeches and participate in
workshops with over 60 leaders
in the field of design education.
Our very own Mechanical
Engineering Prof. David Kelley
was one of the best-received
keynote speakers. As one of his
advisees, I became a para-celebri
ty for the week and had the rare
chance to take a trip to Circuit
City with my professor to make
the fastest, most decisive pur
chase of a DVD player I have
ever seen. The player became a
gift to the Education Department
afterward.
The program that I have had
the most fun working on, howev
er, has been CrossCurrent, the
annual free garden concert
series. This year, in lieu of the
regular live performances by
more traditional groups, which
have in the past included
Hawaiian dancers and Bang on a
Can, CrossCurrent hosted sever
al DJ dance parties with interna

tionally renowned designer
Karim Rashid, who spoke at
Stanford in the fall. Over three
consecutive Tuesdays, we
brought over 7,000 people to the
museum, even when it rained.
There is a lot to be said for
working at a government institu
tion. I got 20 percent off astro
naut ice cream at the Air and
Space Museum and I get into all
museums free with my
Smithsonian badge. But the peo
ple are what have made this
internship a wonderful experi
ence. From getting manicures
with my co-interns after work to
the in-office camaraderie and
working on some great and
meaningful projects, I would rec
ommend it highly to any
Stanford student. So next sum
mer, instead of banking in a sky
scraper or coding in a basement,
consider a moat. You might even
end up in a movie.
