## DISPATCHES FROM THE OUTER DARKNESS California grudge match: smog vs. smug 
### MARK GANEK STAFF COLUMNIST 
Driving over the mountains that
overlook the City of Angels just as
the morning sun was hitting its
stride, I looked through the wind
shield upon the vast urban dream
land and thought exactly what
early settlers must have thought as
they caught the first glimpse of
their new home. "I can't believe
I'm going to be breathing that!"
The brown gunk that hangs in
the air, occasionally snapping up
pets or small children, was part of
the fun, but the smog certainly
wasn't the only highlight on my
scouting trip to what will soon be
my home. 1 also got to chat with
some of the wonderful Los Angeles
"people". I use quotation marks
only because I am unsure what
percentage of a human being must
be composed of actual flesh in
order to be classified as a person.
I am especially fond of the bit
past-middle age men and women
who are desperately clinging to the
last few tatters of their youth by
stretching, tucking, winching and,
in some cases, soldering. My
favorite fad is the shooting of botu
lism toxins directly into the face in
order to paralyze the muscles that
cause wrinkles, thereby creating
the illusion of a remarkably well
preserved corpse.
After extensive experimenta
tion, I found that if you jump out
from behind a building and
scream "Boo!" at these people,
they will vainly attempt to simulate
a facial expression by manipulat
ing their faces with their hands, as
if they were life-size puppets.

I am told by my more socially
conscious friends that the obses
sion with looks, or "lookism," is
essentially my fault because I am
male and therefore have a tyranni
cal gaze and all. 1 didn't believe
them until this weekend, but now I
finally realize what it must be like
for women to be oppressed by
gaze, because Los Angeles is the
only city on Earth where the
power structure is reversed and
the breasts stare at you. It's eerie.
You will be walking along,
minding your own business
(accounting), when suddenly
something approaches you. It is
not so much a woman as a breast
delivery device. As you vainly try to
avert your eyes, you gradually real
ize that these are not quite breasts.
They are artificial, military-grade
assault boobs, anti-gravity
enhanced floating orbs of doom.
And they're looking at you! Like
the eyes in great paintings, they
seem to follow you wherever you
go. Absolutely terrifying.
I think we could pitch these
women to President George W.
Bush as an low-budget way of
eliminating the pesky Iraq prob
lem. We could drop leaflets all over
Los Angeles stating that the newest
reality-dating show or open-cast
ing movie opportunity would be
taking place just northwest of
Kuwait. Imagine the horror in the
Republican Guard's eyes as they
saw an army of silicone-enhanced
death machines, head shots in
hand, come spilling over the top of
a sand dune.
The entire Iraqi army would
run shrieking into the desert. I
know I would. The only problem is

that I am reasonably sure that this
tactic is in violation of the Geneva
convention. Not that we seem too
worried about that, these days.
Aside from the physical endow
ments of Los Angeles, the personal
side left me underwhelmed as well.
Usually, I am a slightly gregarious
character, meaning that 1 tend to
talk to anything that seems to be
breathing semi-regularly. In more
voluble moods I have been known
to banter with the occasional
houseplant. When 1 am drunk* 1
will attempt to get its phone num
ber. It will refuse, but it never hurts
to ask.
However, in Los Angeles, I

would strike up conversations with
strangers, then suddenly get the
feeling that I didn't really have to
be there. The person I was talking
to would be just as happy talking to
a frog, or a sturdy chair. I was not
conversing as much as being pres
ent for the dispensation of a pre
packaged conversational niblet.
A nagging question now indis
creetly presents itself like a Venice
Beach meathead elbowing his way
to the bar: why am I moving to
Los Angeles? In my case, rationale
usually lags decision by about
eight months, but let's see how
much retroactive sense we can
make here.

A majority of a human being's
time on this planet is spent in a
state of unsatisfied longing, and I
think this is true regardless of
geography. However, the intrin
sic quality of this longing varies
from region to region. In the
Midwest, my childhood home,
the longing takes the form of a
vague and gnawing sense that a
beautiful, exciting life lies just
over the horizon.
In Los Angeles, there is a more
direct and active form of dissatis
faction, in that every person seems
to have a clear idea of exactly who
