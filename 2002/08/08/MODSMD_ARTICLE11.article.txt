# Reduce taxes by shrinking the government
## 
### MARK BOUCHER EDITORIAL STAFF 
Last week I redeemed some
frequent-flyer miles for a free air
line ticket. Except the ticket wasn't
free. After 1 had chosen the flights,
the reservation agent informed
me that I would be charged a $5
security tax. This irked me a bit.
It's not that I mind paying $5 tor
my safety. The tax is small, and I
wouldn't have even noticed it if I
had paid full price for the ticket,

but it was really the principle that
bothered me: either the ticket is
free or it isn't. The whole episode
made me think about how many
taxes we pay.
Let's start with your paycheck.
First, the federal and state govern
ments withhold income tax. Then
the black holes of Social Security
and Medicare suck up another
eight percent of your money.
After leaving work, you till up
your car with gas, paying federal
and state taxes on every gallon.

You buy some clothes at the mall,
paying eight percent extra in sales
tax. At home, you pay your wire
less phone bill, where taxes and
government fees can add as much
as 10 percent to the monthly
charge. Finally, your broker calls
to tell you that your timely sale of
stock earned you a tidy sum, but
the federal government takes 20
percent of it in capital gains taxes.
That's a lot of different taxes on a
lot of different things. It doesn't
take long for the 86 cents of sales

tax and the $11.13 Medicare
deduction to become a significant
amount of money.
I am not suggesting that taxes
are evil and immoral, as some
politicians seem to think; Taxation
is imperative in allowing the gov
ernment to function. Taxes are a
necessary evil and many times,
they serve a perfectly good and fair
purpose. We need to pay for police
protection, primary education,
national defense and other crucial
government functions. The prob

lem is that many taxes simply fund
programs that benefit relatively
small groups of people.
Everyone obviously benefits
from the police department and
the court system. These are uni
versal government functions that
are best supported by taxes and
best run by the government. But
many government programs sim
ply subsidize certain groups with
other people's money.
lake, for example, the federally
sponsored Stafford Loan program.
It allows many students to borrow
money for college at a ridiculously
low interest rate. It's probably one
fourth of what they would pay if
they borrowed from a bank. But
many of these students are not so
poor that they couldn't afford to
pay back the money at a higher
interest rate. (Subsidized loans for
truly poor people is a valuable pro
gram and one that I don't necessar
ily mind paying for.) The federal
government is basically giving these
students (including me) a huge
windfall, and someone else's tax
dollars are paying for it. I'm not
sure that's fair to those taxpayers. I
wouldn't think it was fair if the situ
ation were reversed. I truly appre
ciate the opportunity for the low
interest loan, but it's not the best
use of national tax money.
My point is that if we want
lower taxes, we must be willing to
severely limit the functions of the
government. We must eliminate its
non-essential programs, even
those that benefit us personally. In
an effort to lower taxes, we could
quarrel forever about which pro
grams most deserve government
funding, but that argument
wouldn't be productive. Instead,
it's simpler, fairer and easier to just
say that the government should
limit its activities to those that ben
efit everyone, or nearly everyone.
This is not to say that we should
cut programs that help the poor, a
position that is commonly linked
with the "reduce government"

attitude. They need help, and the
government should provide it. But
to argue that the government
should finance a new baseball sta
dium, for example, is preposter
ous. Social Security helps a lot of
poor seniors afford a decent stan
dard of living, but it also helps a lot
of middle-class seniors afford a
winter home in Boca Raton. It's
that kind of government assistance
that we need to eliminate.
I've never calculated whether
the amount I pay in taxes is
greater than the extra interest I
would pay without a government
sponsored loan. But I'm willing to
bet that I would come out ahead
with low taxes and high interest
payments. And that doesn't
include the psychological effects.
I'd feel a lot better making interest
payments. That money is helping
to pay for my education, which is
something I value highly and
something I am willing to spend
my money on. Whereas if the
money goes to the government, I
can't help but think it gets wasted
on $500 toilet seats.
In a democratic society, we can
institute change if we feel our
taxes are too high and too numer
ous. We can advocate for lower
taxes, but we must be willing to
shrink the size and the scope of
the government. We must be will
ing to critically ask, "Should the
government be doing this?" even
when the program in question
helps us. By doing this, we can
reduce the omnipresence of taxes
and vsatly improve everyone's
economic situation.

I'd feel a lot better making interest
payments. That money is helping
to pay for my education, which is
something I value highly and
something I am willing to spend
my money on. Whereas if the
money goes to the government, I
can't help but think it gets wasted
on $500 toilet seats.
In a democratic society, we can
institute change if we feel our
taxes are too high and too numer
ous. We can advocate for lower
taxes, but we must be willing to
shrink the size and the scope of
the government. We must be will
ing to critically ask, "Should the
government be doing this?" even
when the program in question
helps us. By doing this, we can
reduce the omnipresence of taxes
and vsatly improve everyone's
economic situation.
