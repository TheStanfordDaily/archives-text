# Reduce taxes by shrinking the government
## 
### MARK BOUCHER EDITORIAL STAFF 
Last week I redeemed some
frequent-flyer miles for a free air
line ticket. Except the ticket wasn't
free. After 1 had chosen the flights,
the reservation agent informed
me that I would be charged a $5
security tax. This irked me a bit.
It's not that I mind paying $5 tor
my safety. The tax is small, and I
wouldn't have even noticed it if I
had paid full price for the ticket,

but it was really the principle that
bothered me: either the ticket is
free or it isn't. The whole episode
made me think about how many
taxes we pay.
Let's start with your paycheck.
First, the federal and state govern
ments withhold income tax. Then
the black holes of Social Security
and Medicare suck up another
eight percent of your money.
After leaving work, you till up
your car with gas, paying federal
and state taxes on every gallon.

You buy some clothes at the mall,
paying eight percent extra in sales
tax. At home, you pay your wire
less phone bill, where taxes and
government fees can add as much
as 10 percent to the monthly
charge. Finally, your broker calls
to tell you that your timely sale of
stock earned you a tidy sum, but
the federal government takes 20
percent of it in capital gains taxes.
That's a lot of different taxes on a
lot of different things. It doesn't
take long for the 86 cents of sales

tax and the $11.13 Medicare
deduction to become a significant
amount of money.
I am not suggesting that taxes
are evil and immoral, as some
politicians seem to think; Taxation
is imperative in allowing the gov
ernment to function. Taxes are a
necessary evil and many times,
they serve a perfectly good and fair
purpose. We need to pay for police
protection, primary education,
national defense and other crucial
government functions. The prob

lem is that many taxes simply fund
programs that benefit relatively
small groups of people.
Everyone obviously benefits
from the police department and
the court system. These are uni
versal government functions that
are best supported by taxes and
best run by the government. But
many government programs sim
ply subsidize certain groups with
other people's money.
