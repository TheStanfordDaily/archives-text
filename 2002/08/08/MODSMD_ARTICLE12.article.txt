## Sidling up to the Bar 
### JOE LEMON STAFF COLUMNIST 
The opening line to Elvis
Costello's "God's Comic" is: "I
wish you'd known me when I was
alive, I was a funny feller." As a
self-proclaimed "funny feller,"
those words resonated with me
last week as 1 experienced a pre
mature and (fortunately for the
Daily fans who have lived without
this column for the past two
weeks!) temporary death known
as the California Bar Exam that
sucked all the humor right out of
my otherwise hilarious brain.
The Bar Exam is a bit of a
marathon, not only because it
comprises 18 hours of testing over
three days, but also because of the
two months of mindless prepara
tion classes you have to endure
prior to sitting for the exam.
When you add the three years you
invested in law school just to get
the privilege to enter the testing
facility, you begin to think of Mao's
Long March as little more than a
weekend jaunt.
When suffering through the
latter stages of this process, you
invariably wonder why there is a
bar exam at all. Intuitively, the
answer is obvious: we want to
ensure that those people who
practice law are sufficiently quali
fied to represent their clients well.
This intention, while noble, prob
ably has little to do with the
administration of the bar exam,
however.
Rather, the design is more like
ly fueled by a desire to restrict the
membership of the little club of
attorneys, which naturally results
in more employment for those
who are already practicing.
Indeed, the Bar Association is a
private organization; state govern
ments play no role in the adminis
tration of the Bar Exam.
The California Bar Exam is
offered semi-annually. In the July
administration, about half of the
applicants pass; in February, less
than 40 percent do. An old story
says that upon entering law
school, a dean would tell you to
look at the people to your right

and left. "At the end of one year,
one of you will not be here," the
dean would say. Whoa.
Intimidating, but generally
untrue today.
However, at the Sacramento
Convention Center last week,
when the room was divided into
two halves, I couldn't help hop
ing that I had been assigned to
the right side of the aisle. Are the
people who don't pass remark
ably less qualified than the
lawyers you encounter every day?
Probably not.
The subject matter of the exam
illustrates this somewhat. In our
review classes, a professor would
tell us, "This is the rule regarding
illegal search and seizure." We all
began writing furiously.
The professor would then
assure us, "But, they're not going
to test you on this." Then, the pro
fessor would explain the main
exception to that rule; again, our
fingers would fly. "But, they're not
going to test you on this,"the pro
fessor would say.
Instead, the bar examiners want
to test you on the exception to the
exception to the exception. Why?
Because that kind of question is
easier to grade; more people will
fail it. Does it test a more meaning
ful aspect of the law than the gen
eral rule? Of course not — but that
wouldn't make for easy grading
and symmetrical bell curves.
Ethics is rightfully a hot-button
topic for the Bar Association.
When Watergate decimated the
esteem of lawyers in the mid
-19705, law schools instituted
mandatory ethics requirements
and bar associations agreed on a
half-day examination of the rules
of professional responsibility in
addition to the regular exam. I
have no particular objection to
such heightened awareness of
professional duties. In fact, in the
aftermath of Enron and
World Com, we might wonder
whether CEOs shouldn't be sub
ject to similar examinations.
What is curious, however, is
how the bar examiners treat the
applicants during the test itself.
Unlike the presumption of inno

cence guaranteed by the U.S.
Constitution, the bar examiners
— a la Tom Cruise in "Minority
Report" — seem to anticipate that
every single applicant is going to
cheat on the exam.
Believe me, Stanford students
who are accustomed to the rights
and responsibilities afforded by
the Fundamental Standard must
surely feel like they are trying to
pass through international airport
security checkpoints donned in
florescent turbans and shoes made
entirely of plastique.
The proctors are sufficiently
invasive during the test that you
begin to wonder whether their
title has the same etymology as
"proctologist." They don't, as it
turns out.
Every day, we had to submit to
a different kind of authentication
of our identity: fingerprints, hand
writing samples, our mother's
maiden name, family dog, moth
er's maiden name of family dog,
and so on. I started to wonder if
they were just trying to collect
every single Internet password
that 1 have created in the past five
years. Wait a minute, I only want
to represent criminals, not be
treated like one!
What's funny is that I remem
ber feeling held hostage to similar
inequities when I took the SAT
and the LSAT.
"These tests don't represent
who I am as a person," I tritely
complained. But, when the expe
rience is all over, and you find that
you stumble past these obstacles,
you lose the venom you once had
for the unfairness of the regime.
As my dad described it to me,
"Once you cross the moat, you
help pull up the drawbridge."
Let's just hope that by the
time the results come out in
November, my passion for
reforming the system will derive
from genuine altruism, and not
just sour grapes.

than 40 percent do. An old story
says that upon entering law
school, a dean would tell you to
look at the people to your right

and left. "At the end of one year,
one of you will not be here," the
dean would say. Whoa.
Intimidating, but generally
untrue today.
However, at the Sacramento
Convention Center last week,
when the room was divided into
two halves, I couldn't help hop
ing that I had been assigned to
the right side of the aisle. Are the
people who don't pass remark
ably less qualified than the
lawyers you encounter every day?
Probably not.
The subject matter of the exam
illustrates this somewhat. In our
review classes, a professor would
tell us, "This is the rule regarding
illegal search and seizure." We all
began writing furiously.
The professor would then
assure us, "But, they're not going
to test you on this." Then, the pro
fessor would explain the main
exception to that rule; again, our
fingers would fly. "But, they're not
going to test you on this,"the pro
fessor would say.
Instead, the bar examiners want
to test you on the exception to the
exception to the exception. Why?
Because that kind of question is
easier to grade; more people will
fail it. Does it test a more meaning
ful aspect of the law than the gen
eral rule? Of course not — but that
wouldn't make for easy grading
and symmetrical bell curves.
Ethics is rightfully a hot-button
topic for the Bar Association.
When Watergate decimated the
esteem of lawyers in the mid
-19705, law schools instituted
mandatory ethics requirements
and bar associations agreed on a
half-day examination of the rules
of professional responsibility in
addition to the regular exam. I
have no particular objection to
such heightened awareness of
professional duties. In fact, in the
aftermath of Enron and
World Com, we might wonder
whether CEOs shouldn't be sub
ject to similar examinations.
What is curious, however, is
how the bar examiners treat the
applicants during the test itself.
Unlike the presumption of inno

cence guaranteed by the U.S.
Constitution, the bar examiners
— a la Tom Cruise in "Minority
Report" — seem to anticipate that
every single applicant is going to
cheat on the exam.
Believe me, Stanford students
who are accustomed to the rights
and responsibilities afforded by
the Fundamental Standard must
surely feel like they are trying to
pass through international airport
security checkpoints donned in
florescent turbans and shoes made
entirely of plastique.
The proctors are sufficiently
invasive during the test that you
begin to wonder whether their
title has the same etymology as
"proctologist." They don't, as it
turns out.
Every day, we had to submit to
a different kind of authentication
of our identity: fingerprints, hand
writing samples, our mother's
maiden name, family dog, moth
er's maiden name of family dog,
and so on. I started to wonder if
they were just trying to collect
every single Internet password
that 1 have created in the past five
years. Wait a minute, I only want
to represent criminals, not be
treated like one!
What's funny is that I remem
ber feeling held hostage to similar
inequities when I took the SAT
and the LSAT.
"These tests don't represent
who I am as a person," I tritely
complained. But, when the expe
rience is all over, and you find that
you stumble past these obstacles,
you lose the venom you once had
for the unfairness of the regime.
As my dad described it to me,
"Once you cross the moat, you
help pull up the drawbridge."
Let's just hope that by the
time the results come out in
November, my passion for
reforming the system will derive
from genuine altruism, and not
just sour grapes.
