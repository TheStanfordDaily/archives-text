## Cardinal stars compete for coveted national spots 
### KENNETH GARRETT EDITORIAL STAFF 
Yon don't have to be a swimmer to be ex
cited right now, although, if you are a swim
mer, you can hardly wait. Any fan of athletic
excellence can appreciate the importance of
the 2002 Phillips 60 Summer National
Championships, which kicks off Aug. 12 in
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and is the most im
portant domestic swim meet since the 2000
Olympic Trials.
Most excited of all are the members of
the Stanford men's and women's swim
teams, who have a rare opportunity to chal
lenge the brightest stars in the world of
swimming.
Though the competition will be held in
Fort Lauderdale, the athletes will be think
ing mostly of Athens, Greece, and Yoko
hama, Japan.
â€¢ Athens is in sight because it is the home
of the 2004 Olympic Games, and this event
is a stepping stone to that competition.
"If your competitors beat you here, they
win one before Olympic Trials," said junior
Peter Marshall. "You don't want them to
have a mental leg up on you, so everybody
will pull out all the stops at this meet."
"It's a good gauge to see where you stack
up," said junior Michael Bruce.
More urgent than the Olympics, howev
er, is a desire to land a trip to Yokohama,
Japan, the home of the 2002 Pan-Pacific
Championships. This meet, to be held im
mediately following U.S. Summer Nation
als, is the premier international meet of the
summer.

"Making an international team would be
a great experience," said sophomore Matt
McDonald. "The more international com
petition you have before 2004, the more
prepared you'll be for Trials."
l lie Pan-Pacific team is only one of five
international teams to be selected in Florida
next week. The gold and silver medalists in
each final race will make the National A-
Team, which will compete at the Pan-Pacific
Championships, the 2003 Dual in the Pool
and the 2003 World Championships in
Barcelona.
A newborn tradition, the Dual in the
Pool will pit the very best swimmers from the
United States against those of Australia.
These two swimming powerhouses infor
mally compete against each other in the
medal counts at each major international
competition, but this will be the first time the
two will meet head to head.
The third- and fourth-place finishers at
Nationals will be a part of the B-Team, which
will compete at the Pan-American games to
be held next year in Santo Domingo, Do
minican Republic.
Finally, the fifth and sixth place finishers
will compete at the 2003 World University
Games in South Korea.
Along with each of these teams come fi
nancial incentives, free travel and, most im
portantly, a chance to represent the United
States.
With strong performance from both the
men and the women at the Santa Clara and
Janet Evans invitational meets earlier this
summer, the Cardinal is poised for some
stellar performances in Florida.

Fans will look for the 100-meter back
stroke to be one of the fastest events on the
docket. With Stanford superstars and world
champions Randall Bal and Peter Marshall
competing for the top spots against world
record holders Lenny Krayzelburg and
Aaron Piersol, anything could happen.
"They may be the underdogs, but
they're two of the most talented underdogs
ever," said Bruce of his teammates. "I think
their time has come."

Bruce has his work cut out for him as
well in the 100 and 200 breaststroke events.
Along with teammates Pat Fowler and Gary
Marshall, a recent transfer from the Univer
sity of Virginia, as well as Tara Kirk of the
women's team, the Cardinal breaststroke
corps will try to make an impressive mark on
the national stage.
In addition to some fast times from Mc-

Junior Peter Marshall will join several teammates as they compete in the 2002 Phillips 66 Summer
National Championships, which starts Aug. 12 in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.
Donald, Jay me Cramer and Dai
Westcott in the butterfly event;
and from sophomore Lac)
Boutwell in the backstroke, some
of the most intense competitioi
will be in the sprint freestyle
events. Because the National A
Team takes the top six in eacl
sprint freestyle event to fill out the
relay squads, the chances of mak
ing an elite team are greater.
But that also means more peo
pie will try their skill at the starting
blocks, and some fast races art
bound to follow.
"Where you place means a lot
at most meets, but especially at thi;
one," McDonald said. "There is sc
much on the line. It really add;
another level to the excitement."
