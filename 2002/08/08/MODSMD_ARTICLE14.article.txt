# Women's soccer uses early practices to get head start
## 
### KENNETH GARRETT EDITORIAL STAFF 
If you look at a calendar, we are techni
cally just a bit past the midpoint of sum
mer. Before we return to a life of dining
hall food and naps in the Bender Room,
most of us still have plans for road trips,
bonfires on the beach and a few too many
reruns of "I Love Lucy."
The members of the Stanford women's
soccer team, on the other hand, have no
time for such simple summer pleasures.
Tomorrow marks the beginning of anoth
er season of determined preparation on
the road to NCAA glory.
Of course, coming back to the Farm is
little more than a change in location and
company, as most of the team members
have been training hard all summer in var
ious locations around the country.
Senior Marcia Wallis and juniors Ally
Marquand and Nicole Barnhart have been
busy in Turku, Finland, defending Ameri
ca's hold on the coveted Nordic Cup as
members of the Under-21 National Team.
In the final game of the tournament,
Wallis scored two goals and led the Ameri

cans to a 3-1 victory over the skilled Ger
man team.
"We knew Germany was an estab
lished, talented team and had come
through a tough bracket to get to the
final," Wallis said. "But [head coach Jerry
Smith] told us that we were the better team
and if we played our best game we would
win."
Other team members have been play
ing in the W-league, the soccer equivalent
of minor league baseball, while many have
turned to former club teams or to disci
plined individual training to prepare for
the fitness tests on Aug. 14.
"Slacking off is just not an option at
all," said junior Jenna Shuer.
"That's what makes the team so great.
Everyone wants to train at the greatest in
tensity," Shuer added. "It's pretty amazing
to be in that environment."
A Cardinal team with unrealized talent
and a 100 percent commitment should
make the team a force to be reckoned with
in 2002 and 2003.
The Cardinal entered the 2001-2002
season ranked No. 15 in the nation, and
was expected to finish fourth in the Pacific

10 Conference. Instead, the team climbed
the ranks to as high as No. 2, finishing one
goal shy of the Pac-10 title and ninth in the
NCAA tournament. Their final record was
1.5-4-2, and 6-2-1 in the Pac-10.
A successful 2002 spring season, in
cluding shutouts in every game except a
scrimmage against a local boys team, gives
hope that this year will be even more im
pressive.
The Cardinal women will feel the loss
of three talented players. Defender Amy
Saner, now playing professionally for the
WUSA in San Diego, was an important
leader on the team. Fifth-year senior
Christy LaPierre was a source of glue for
team cohesion, while goalkeeper Carrie
Walsh's Cinderella-like transformation
after the first-string-keeper was sidelined
by knee surgery inspired teammates and
fans alike.
Despite these losses, the addition of
seven extremely talented freshmen will
bring the roster to a whopping 26. With so
many talented women competing for lim
ited time on the field, it should raise the
bar of excellence across the team.
And it won't take long before team

chemistry is put to the test. Beginning at
midnight the morning of Aug. 14, the first
day it's legal for freshmen to begin train
ing, the entire team will undergo fitness
tests. Just hours later, the team will be on a
jet headed for Europe, where they will face
off against national and club teams in the
Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.
"Victories in Europe won't significant
ly affect our reputation," Shuer said. "This
trip is largely for the experience, and to
get some good tough games in before we
start our season. The competition won't be
lax at all. They'll challenge lis and make us
better."
Inspired by a desire to win the NCAA
championship this year, the Cardinal
women will try to take advantage of every
opportunity they have to improve.
"We know we have a lot of talent and
we know the championships are within
our reach," Shuer said. "It's a matter of
channeling all that knowledge into some
thing that will work, not something that
will burn us into the ground, make us
cocky or set us up for failure. We have to
maximize our potential."
And with this team, the sky's the limit.
