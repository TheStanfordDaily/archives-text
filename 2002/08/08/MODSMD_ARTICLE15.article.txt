# Dunk marks change in women's sports
## Leslie's landmark shows leaps and bounds made by female athletes 
### TERRY HURLBUTT STAFF COLUMNIST 
It only took five years, but
Lisa Leslie did it.
She became the first player in
the history of the \VN BA to dunk.
And then her team lost.
But really, the loss is almost
beside the point.
Many may wonder: Who
cares? It's not like the rest of the
world has never witnessed a
dunk before — indeed, it's not
even the first time a woman has
dunked in basketball.
So what then is the point?
The point is that women's bas
ketball, really women's sports in
general, have come a long way
and show no sign of slowing
down.
Women aren't typically ex
pected to dunk. Alley-oops are
not taught as regulation plays in
either collegiate or professional
ball and female post players are
never warned about hanging 011
the rim after jamming it down
their opponent's throat. Why is
that? Clearly such a situation is
possible, but we never think
about it. In fact, most female
players never seriously consider

dunking even now.
At one of the basketball camps
I attended in the past, that ques
tion was posed to one of the
camp's coaches who thought
about it and then gave an answer
that, while probably not encom
passing the whole reason, made
an impression on me.
When boys enter a gym, re
gardless of age, tliey all jump and
try to touch the net or the rim or
whatever. Girls (usually) do not.
With this in mind, I headed
over to Maples Pavilion to watch
my younger sisters play during
their final day of basketball camp
— a camp that I had been to
many times in the past. As I set
tled into both my seat and my du
tiful and supportive big sister role
I was suddenly struck by a sense
of deja vu.
I marveled that I used to have
that much energy, that my hair
ever whipped around in high
ponytails and that I used to reck
lessly (live after every loose ball
that came my way. Those sights
were all familiar, as were the
drills and the genuine enthusi
asm of the young athletes.
But something was different
too — different enough to make
me feel old at the tender age of
20.
As I watched my sisters play,
who are both, admittedly, better
than I ever was, I realized there
was something different overall

about these players.
Among the 14-year-olds, girls
had developed absolutely gor
geous three-point shots. They
mastered dribbling between the
legs and behind the back.
The high-schoolers demon
strated remarkable court sense
and one-on-one moves that
dropped my jaw open in admira
tion and awe (and yes, a little bit
of envy).
These girls were good.
I'm sure there were girls like
that even in my camp days some
five or six years ago. However,
I'm also pretty sure girls that
good, at that age, were more the
exception than the rule.
So what's the difference?
1 looked to my own sisters try
ing to determine what had
changed and it hit me that they
started playing much, much ear
lier than I, and most of my
friends, did
Programs and camps now
exist for girls as young as six or
seven years of age — much like
the guys.
Club teams and spring
leagues are now the norm for
most players, even before they
get to high school.
More and more, girls are
growing up playing basketball,
picking it up at seven or eight in
stead of eleven or twelve. And
those few extra years appear to
be making a difference.

It's not just basketball either
— it's soccer, Softball, swimming,
tennis and volleyball, just to
name a few.
We take girls' sports seriously.
My sisters have both grown
up watching women play — in
college and the pros. They have
role models within the sport,
many of whom, by the way, have
Stanford roots. And it's really
cool to see. I can think of many
reasons for this slow, but steady
change and won't speculate on
all of them, nor the degree to
which they've been responsible
— except to say this.
While the implementation of
Title IX is not without some
faults, especially in regards to
smaller male sports, it has not
been a waste by any means.
It has gone a long way in mak
ing opportunities within sports
more available and acceptable to
girls who are now reveling in
those opportunities.
So as the debate over Title IX
continues and indeed, picks up
steam, 1 just hope people look for
solutions that continue this trend
of phenomenal female athleti
cism.
Because while I didn't notice
any of the older girls try to touch
the rim, I never watched the
younger girls. And who's to say
they haven't already decided
that dunking is not outside their
range of possibilities?
