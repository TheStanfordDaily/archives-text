Foot injury sidelines Borchardt
Former Cardinal center, Curtis Bor
chardt, recently reinjured his right foot,
sidelining him for four to six weeks.
Borchardt was a first-round draft
pick in the 2002 NBA draft and was ac
quired by the Utah Jazz in a subse
quent trade and signed to a three-year
$3 million contract on July 12.
The Jazz physician diagnosed
Borchardt with a hairline fracture on
the top of his right arch — an injury
that sidelined the 7-foot center for
the last 14 games of the 2000-2001
season.
While the Jazz have not ruled out
the possibility of surgery, Borchardt al
ready has two screws in his foot from
surgery last March.
