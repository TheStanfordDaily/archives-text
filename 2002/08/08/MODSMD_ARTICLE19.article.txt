## Triple 'X' marks the good spot 
### PETER KAZANJY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A bald James Bond? Shave Pierce Brosnan's
head, and yon won't get Xander Cage, the hero
played by Vin Diesel in an update of the geriatric
Bond franchise.
To get into the X-zone in "XXX," you need more
than just less hair. You need to be buff, bad and re
freshingly funny. We don't mean droll. No, we'll leave
that to 007. We mean one-liners that best Arnold
Schwarzenegger's, comebacks that don't spare the
rod and delivery, delivery, delivery.

Until now,
Americans re

had their own

"True Lies" might count, though he really can't
pull off that Austro-American accent enough to be
a Real American Hero. (And don't even get me
started on the "Last Action Hero.") To fill this gap,
X marks the spot.
Where Bond is upper-class British twaddle, Xander
is all about a hard day's work. Bond's martinis have

requisite Armani monkey suit,
Xavier's haute musculature is
fashionable in any setting. What's
more, Xavier doesn't even chase
skirts for longer than five minutes
total. That's virtual celibacy com
pared to what one would find in
the latest Bond offering.
The movie has the business
oriented approach, for better and
for worse. What it lacks in its im
plausible plot (derivative a little of
"La Femme Nikita"), it makes up
in pure action-flick muscle. One
wouldn't expect any less from di
rector Rob Cohen, whose "The
Fast and the Furious" also starred
Diesel, though with less successful
results.
In "XXX," not only is Diesel's
performance swift and edgy, but
those turned in by his costars are
no less accomplished, given the

intended guts and glory goal. Asia
Argento does well not to fall into
truism of Bond girls. True, some
Bond films have attempted to
change this, but really, anything
Denise Richards has to say just
shouldn't be heard, period.
Argento's character Yelena
comes off as stunning without sac
rificing her intelligence, and
shows great chemistry with Diesel
near the start of the film.
Samuel L. Jackson plays the
straight-shooter to Xavier's loose
cannon; he is like M.was to Bond.
Jackson demonstrates the requisite
hard nose, the obligatory obscure
scar from a mission of days gone
by. However, his Agent Gibbons
seems a little flat in the end, per
haps because of his limited screen
time. Or perhaps it's because the
writers cashed out their creative
bank trying not to make Xander
the stereotypical hero. Whatever
the reason, it doesn't detract from
the movie greatly. But they better
work on it for next time.

With "XXX," a lot of the payoff
comes down to the amount ex
citement it tries to generate. The
movie does exactly what it sets out
to do.

Whether future movies live up
to the original or take the sequel
slide will depend on if the action
sequences can get bigger and
more flame-intensive. So long as

the keepers of "XXX" keep that in
mind and make sure Mr. Vin
keeps up with his acting classes,
this franchise should have a long
and successful future.
