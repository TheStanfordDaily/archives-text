# Eastwood's 'Blood' doesn't quite work
## 
### RAMIN SETOODEH EDITORIAL STAFF 
Clint Eastwood, the tough
wrangler of the 1960s West
ern film, has aged nicely into
the lone star everyinan of mod
ern-day cinema. In "Space
Cowboys," which opened two
years ago this month, he
played a veteran astronaut
who comes out of retirement
to save the world from a
plummeting satellite. In his
latest film, "Blood Work" (in
which he also directs himself),
Eastwood plays a veteran FBI
agent who comes out of re
tirement to save a lovely lady
from a murderer.
The plot may be tweaked
a little, but the message re-

mains the same: Clint
Eastwood, now in his 70s,
may be considered an old
turkey in some circles,
yet on the silver screen In
still commands a pres
ence that is dominant
and anchored, full of
warmth and reliable
comedic timing.

As an actor and director,
he can test the waters of great
cinematic vision — as in "Un
forgiven." Or, less pleasurably,
he can serve his audience the
same old cinematic meal with
the ripe patience of someone
who enjoys filmmaking —as
in "True Crime."

wood doesn't try to reinvent

drama are rehashed threads
from the standard made-for
television police thriller. Yet
the movie doesn't even suc

complish — namely, to follow
in the footsteps of greater films
that merge action with police
drama effortlessly like the
original "Lethal Weapon."

IN THE LINE OF FIRE: Eastwood brandishes a
rifle in "Blood Work."
Most of the blame lies with the
screenplay by Brian Helgeland,
which abandons the development
of its characters in favor of shoot
and-kill scenes that don't add to
gether in the end. Eastwood is
good, but not good enough to rise
above material this inherently
bad.
Eastwood stars as Terrell Mc-
Caleb, the aforementioned veteran
FBI director who is pushed into re
tirement after a near-death injury

in the line of duty. He leaves an un
solved mystery on the desk where
the murderer left him a nine-digit
number that no one can decipher.
(There is a pun in the last sentence
for anyone who has seen the film
and its ridiculous finale.)
His doctor (Anjelica Huston)
advises him to get some rest and
coast through retirement on the
boat that he now inhabits. Fate,
however, is not so kind — and soon
Terrell is approached by Graciela
Rivers (Wanda De Jesus), a young
woman whose sister was murdered
at a convenience store. The case is
still wide open, and she wants Ter
rell to help her crack it.

The chemistry between East
wood and De Jesus is strong and ef
fective. The dialogue hinges on
ridiculous banter at times, but it is
delivered with such intensity that
many of their exchanges seem sim
ilar to acting done by noir film stars
Fred Mac Murray and Barbara
Stanwyck in the 19405.
Him: "1 don't think I can help
you, miss."
Her: "Why don't you look at [the
picture] again. 1 have a double. You
know, two for the price of one."
Him: [Accepts] "Don't go thank
ing me and don't get your hopes
up. I'm just going to take a look."
Terrell decides to take the case,

for reasons that should not be re
vealed, and enlists the help of his
neighbor, Buddy (Jeff Daniels), to
drive him around town. Early in
the film, Terrell tells Buddy that a
health complication doesn't allow
him to sit in the front seat of a car
with airbags. This is usually the
type of information that weaves
back into the thread of a skillful
story. In "Blood Work," it never
does.
Other colorful characters that
Terrell works with in the investiga
tion include a detective who he be
friends (played by Tina Lifford,
who also has a nice chemistry with
Eastwood) and a loud-mouthed

police officer (Paul Rodriguez)
who remains skeptical of what Ter
rell is trying to accomplish.
The guilty pleasure in a movie
like "Blood Work" is to try to guess
the identity of the killer from the
small cast of characters that sur
round Eastwood. I spotted him in
less than 30 minutes. It shouldn't
take you any longer.
In an early scene (too early to
necessitate a spoiler warning), Ter
rell is chasing a killer when he col
lapses against a wiry fence and suf
fers a heart attack. Eastwood, of
course, recovers. "Blood Work,"
on the other hand, never manages
to resuscitate itself.
