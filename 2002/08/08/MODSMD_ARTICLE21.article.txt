Austin Powers in Gchdmember

To say that "Austin Powers in Gold
member" never climaxes is an un
derstatement.
In his third time around, the Interna
tional Man of Mystery does not shag a sin
gle woman, British or otherwise. This is
odd, considering the other "Austin Pow
ers" films have always found laughs in the
his after-hours pursuits.
So the franchise is feeling flaccid now;
that doesn't mean "Goldmember" doesn't
have some charm.
All the faithful characters are back:
Austin, his arch nemesis Dr. Evil and the
hefty henchman Fat Bastard (all played by
Mike Myers). In this film, Powers tries to
save his long-lost father, Nigel (Michael
Caine), from the evil Goldmember (Myers
in his fourth-billed role.)
The major problem with "Goldmem
ber" is the fact that Austin Powers, the
character, has almost outworn his wel
come. The first film relied on the fish-out
of-water premise and sent Powers, a spy
from the '60s, to the 19905. In the second
film, Powers returned to the past and the
days of disco. By "Goldmember," Powers
has been back to the future and back again.
This secret agent clearly has nowhere
left to go.

Master of Disguise

Terrible is a strong word. But dras
tic times call for drastic measures.
"The Master of Disguise," starring
Dana Carvey, is simply that - terrible. Bad
acting and writing can be excused. But
when a movie actively strives to insult the
intelligence of its viewers, it's unbearable.
Pistachio Disguisey (Carvey), a young
man who has grown up in New York yet
somehow shares the same Italian accent
his immigrant parents have. His family
also shares spectacular abilities to dis
guise themselves..
Pistachio's father (James Brolin) is kid
napped for those abilities and used by the
evil Devlin Bowman (Brent Spiner) who
wants to get his hands on the treasure of
America. First Brolin dresses as Michael
Johnson to steal the Constitution. Then
he disguises himself as Jesse Ventura to
thieve the Liberty Bell. But when he
takes on the form of Britney Spears to
steal the Apollo 11 lunar lander, it was too
much.
Even Miss Spears would have difficulty
retrieving something that's been on the
moon ever since it landed in 1969. Though
doubtful, perhaps the movie could have
pulled out of such a drastic nosedive. But I
wouldn't know. I walked out.

Road to Perdition

Sam Mendes's first film since "Ameri
can Beauty" has been marketed as a
traditional tale about gangsters. But
it's not a gangster movie, not really anyway.
At the core of the film is Tom Hanks
in one of the best performances of his
career. That is a phrase that movie crit
ics like to use often. But Tom Hanks,
who has won two Academy Awards, is al
ways expected to be good. What is sur
prising in "Perdition" is how good he ac
tually is.
Hanks stars as Michael Sullivan, a man
who works for the mob. His boss, John
Rooney (Paul Newman), can be vicious
and uncompromising, but acts as a father
figure to him. There is a murder. Then two
more and Michael is forced to flee with his
son (Tyler Hoechlin) to the town of Perdi
tion where he hopes they can find refuge.
The movie is at times quiet and con
templative, and at other times very vio
lent. But the violence in the movie
works to advance the story line, not to
interfere with it.
The deaths in "Perdition" are portrayed
as cold and unflinching, as they should be,
and Sam Mendes has a gift for building
tension and releasing it at precisely the
right moment.

Signs

The subterranean style of spook
and-thrill director M. Night Shya
malan infects the screen with
muted wonder in his latest and most ambi
tious film yet.
The plot develops slowly, but with ad
mirable ease. Mel Gibson stars as Graham
Hess, a minister who loses his faith after his
wife is killed in a brutal car accident. He
puts the church behind him and dwells,
unemployed apparently, on a farm near
Philadelphia with his two children (Ron
Culkin and Abigail Breslin) and younger
brother, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix).
They are all spooked one morning
when a series of enigmatic crop circles ap
pear in their fields. Perhaps, the characters
begin to believe, supernatural forces are at
play.
"Signs" is intense, rich, mesmerizing
and it features one of the best horror
movie sequences of all time. Yet just when
it edges toward the brink of cinematic
magnificence, the pinnacle of excellence
that few movies reach, does it stumble,
tumble even, into a morass of melodrama.
In other words, "Signs" is the antithesis
of "The Sixth Sense": The beginning sky
rockets into thriller territory while the end
fails in everything it tries to accomplish.
