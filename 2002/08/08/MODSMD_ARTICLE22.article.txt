# BIG 3 BROTHER
## 
### 
Week four in the "Big Brother" house contin
ued to whet our appetite for all the good fixings of
reality television. Here's what happened:
THURSDAY, AUGUST 1. The third."live" evic
tion proved to be the least suspenseful. Even skillful
editing from CBS couldn't fool us into thinking the
voting results were anything less than unanimous.
By a 7-0 tally, Amy was booted out of the house
(as we predicted) over Marcellus. The ex-beauty

pageant contestant exited the
house to meet her toughest chal
lenge yet: a five-minute interview
with host Julie Chen, who mum
bled and bumbled the time away.
Meanwhile, the other contest
ants prepared for the Head of
Household competition. The
game dwindled until Gerry and
Eric were left, and a tie-breaker
question asked them to add the

heights of the three previous evicted women.
Since Eric, the firefighter from Milford, Conn.,
can't add anything other than the number of
women he's bedded, he burned out by guessing
that each evictee measured an average of more
than seven feet tall.
Ahem — we haven't seen anyone so inept at an
swering trivia since those Playgirl playmates ap
peared on "Dog Eat Dog."
Thankfully, Gerry — the teacher from Shadow
Hills, Calif. — managed to fare better. He was
named the new Head of Household.
SATURDAY, AUGUST 3. Another night in the
house yielded heightened suspicions among the
houseguests, especially since no one knew who
Gerry would nominate. To complicate things fur
ther, Gerry (who fluctuates between a kind-hearted
Jesse Ventura and a sinister Louie Anderson) had
made a pact with almost everyone.

In other "Big Brother 3" news, the bedtime be
havior was not affected whatsoever by Gerry's fore
boding decision. Lisa and Eric continued to bump
and hump into the night. The "turning point" in
the relationship arrived when Eric turned away
from lip-locking for air and muttered "hello" to
Lisa. This brought tears to the slender bartender's
eyes, who always dreamed that a man would say
"hello" to her in the middle of nocturnal activities.
(Now she can tell her friends that it wasn't just
sexual attraction that put them together, but that

he really did "have her at hello.")
Their moment of bliss, howev
er, did not last for long. Lisa was
frightened when Eric, who has be
come notorious for babbling in his
sleep, started making death threats
against her. She cried. He comfort
ed her and asked her to come back
to bed. As of press time, no murder
had been reported in the house.
The episode ended with the

toughest decision of Gerry's life. He needed to de
cide which two houseguests to nominate for evic
tion. His choices? Lisa and Eric.
Looks like they've been bitten by love.
WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 7. In twist that proba
bly challenged "Survivor" copyright laws, the Veto
Competition was revealed to be the stand-on-the
box-and-turn-over-tiles game. (If you saw it on the
first "Survivor," you know what we're talking about.)
Lisa wanted it to save Eric. Eric wanted Lisa to
get it so that she would save him.
But, alas, Chiara ended up getting the prize and
she — coerced by Roddy — decided not to use it.
The nominations stood as Gerry wanted them.
OUR PREDICTION: Both Lisa and Eric are
well liked, and it'll probably come down to the clos
est vote the house has seen yet. Voting against Lisa
we're guessing will be Roddy, Josh and Chiara (the
back-stabber). Against Eric will be Danielle, Mar
cellusand Jason.
That's 3-3. And Gerry will break the tie by giving
Eric the boot. His motto, "You could die tomorrow,
so why not be happy today?"
Well, tonight he'll be gone and that won't make
Lisa happy.
