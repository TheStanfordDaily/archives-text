When filmmakers claim that a movie doesn't fit into one of the
standard genres, they often come off as disingenuous or unbearably
pretentious. But director Robert Altman's witty and moving "Gos
ford Park" (2001) really isn't a murder mystery; those hoping for an

Agatha Christie-potboiler will only be disap
pointed.
There are superficial resemblances: The
film opens in 1932 as British socialites gather
at the manor of the wealthy Sir William Mc-
Cordle (Michael Gambon) for a hunting expe
dition. The guests all harbor different agen
das, setting the stage for the usual skuldug
gery. However, the murder doesn't actually
occur until more than halfway through the
film, and the subsequent investigation by In
spector Thompson (Stephen Fry) is played al
most entirely for laughs. The mystery and its

solution serve important roles in the film's plot, but they clearly aren't
its central focus.
Instead, Altman and screenwriter Julian Fellowes seek to
illuminate the servants' world, often glossed over by the clinking
teacups and embalmed refinement of Merchant-Ivory dramas and
their ilk. This time around, the butlers and maids — not their
masters — are the protagonists. There are a few moments of trite,
obvious moralizing, but more often "Gosford Park" breathes hu
mane, believable life into the complex relationship between the
worlds "above stairs" and "below stairs."
As always, Altman proves to be master of the ensemble cast, jug
gling over 30 characters and keeping the audience from becoming
too confused. Standouts from the group of British luminaries include
the wonderfully understated Jeremy Northam as real-life movie star
Ivor Novello and the always-charming Richard E. Grant as the ef
feminate, gossipy servant, George.
The disc's extras include a making-of featurette and filmmaker
commentary. None of it is particularly thrilling, but the bonus mate
rials do illustrate the level of research that went into the film and give
a glimpse of a distinguished, unconventional director at work.
