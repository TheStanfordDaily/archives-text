# El-P album, 'Fantastic' debut for hip-hop fans
## 
### KAREEM GHANEM STAFF WRITER 
In the past 20 years in the world of hip-hop,
stage monikers have run the full gamut, from
the very clever (Mos Del, Gift of Gab) to the
clearly not-so-clever (Vanilla Ice and R Diddy).
El-P, the celebrated New York Gity producer /
rapper (whose name is short for "El-Produc
to") definitely fits into the first category.
"Fantastic Damage," El-P's solo debut gen
erally reflects the artistic ingenuity of a guy
who calls himself by the same name as hip
hop's original musical instrument: the 12-
inch vinyl LP record.
The album, which features cameos by
indie hip-hop heroes Aesop Rock, Camu Tao
and others, is loud, boisterous and deafen
ing. El-P's music bears almost no resem
blance to the jazzy, soulful stylings of fellow
Brooklyn scenesters Mos Def and Talib
Kweli. If Mos Def can be compared to
smooth '60s R&B crooner Sam Cooke, then
El-P is his James Brown. If Mos Def is the

Beatles, then El-P is the Iggy Pop to his Paul
McCartney. You with me?
El-P is insane.
That's hardly a bad thing, though. On
"Deep Space 9mm," released earlier this year
as a 7-inch single, he dismisses the once-inde
pendent label Rawkus, which is currently
merging with major heavyweight MCA. "Sign
with Rawkus?" he asks. "I'd rather be fucked
by Nazis unconscious!"
That's the level of subtlety that permeates
"Fantastic Damage." El-P and his ilk are true
hip-hop soldiers; they are an angry response
to the vapid, money-grubbing shamelessness
of crews like Master P's No Limit Army in the
late '90s.
Each of the record's songs consists of lyrics
layered over heavily punctuated pulses of dis
tortion, dense percussion and faded bass os
cillations with various effects thrown in for
spice. For example, the back-to-back "Delore
an" and "Truancy," the sixth and seventh
tracks, do several neat sonic tricks. Beginning
with the echoes of a man screaming, "Great

Scots! Doc!" the song morphs into what
sounds like a slowed-down drum and bass
tune with a whining synthetic keyboard beat.
The two tracks are separated by El-P and
his cohorts repeating the line, "We need to go
back in time / The way fuckers could rock"
and someone else, who yells, "McFly!" in an
irritating, nasally voice. The lyrics introduce
several themes relating to the past and the fu
ture, including a reference to old-school DJ
Jam Master Jay and several mentions of the
Apocalypse. In the last minute or so, the song
slows down with some piano keystrokes and
an elegant exit.
These two tracks are the album's high
lights. Seamlessly weaving lyrics and music
around the central theme of time and using
the seminal '80s action-comedy Hick "Back to
the Future" as a motif, they showcase El-P at
his cleverest. They're also somewhat funny
when you stop to consider the uncanny re
semblance between the real-life El-P (Jaime
Meline) and Michael J. Fox's on-screen neme
sis, Bill. These are the possibilities when El-P's

madness is focused lor a few minutes.
Taken in 10-minute doses like that, "Fan
tastic Damage" makes for a terrifically satis
fying listen. The album's only flaw is inti
mately tied to its greatest strength; it is so in
tense that it becomes overwhelming at times.
El-P gives you no time to rest, and a listener
can only withstand that kind of ass-kicking
for so long. At 70 minutes, "Fantastic Dam
age" wreaks havoc upon the skulls of all but
the most patient.
