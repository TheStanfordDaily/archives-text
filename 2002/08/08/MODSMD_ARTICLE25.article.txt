# 'Green' not so big

If Green Day has rocked hard,
it's only because they have stood on
the shoulders of punk giants. Exact
ly who these giants are, they show
us in their latest release, an amal
gam of covers, B-sides and rarities
playfully dubbed "Shenanigans."
Two covers, a handful of unre
leased songs from the "Nimrod" ses
sions and some general goofing
about round out the "new"'offering.
Weighing in at a smidge over 30
minutes, this 15-track disc leaves the
listener wondering if it really quali
fies as an album. And considering a
lack ofa common theme amongst the
songs or flow in song arrangement, it
really shouldn't count as one.
Which would make this the sec
ond time Green Day has released
repackaged old in lieu of the new in
as many years.
Still, that doesn't preclude this
from being a fun listen. You just
shouldn't come looking for hot new
Green Day rockers, because they're
really just not there.
But do give a listen to the covers,
especially "Outsider" by the Ra
inones and "Tired of Waiting" by
The Kinks. The Kinks cover in par
ticular comes off" nicely, with Billy
Joe Armstrong's voice proving pli
able enough to abandon his signa
ture whining gutter-mouth in favor
of a more melodic croon.

At least for two-and-a-half min
utes. "Espionage," recorded for
"Austin Powers: The Spy Who
Shagged Me," also makes an ap
pearance, though it doesn't sound
like punky spy music so much as just
another song off of every other spy
soundtrack you've heard before.
Wasn't the swinging '60s Lon
don portrayed in the first "Austin
Powers" movie what the Sex Pistols
were pissed about anyway?
Regardless, the album rebounds
and finishes strong with a previous
ly unreleased track, "Ha Ha, You're
Dead," whose sarcastic lyrics
bounce perfectly along on top of the
fuzzy guitars. If this is a hint of what
to expect for the next "real" album,
we're all in for something cool.
In the end, the new Green Day
album is no "Dookie," but it's not
crap either. Non-Green Day fans
should probably pass this one by, but
for the archival punker who needs to
have it all, you might as well pick this
one up, too.
