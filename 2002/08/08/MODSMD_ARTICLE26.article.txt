# Roxy works on office affairs
## 
### 
Dear Roxy,
Long-time reader; first-time writer. I am the
meat in the proverbial sandwich — stuck be
tween work and pleasure. I just started my first
job a few months ago and love the work, except
that I never get out. Reading your column is one
of the few pleasures I have during the week, that
is, until a young lady started work a few weeks
back. Suddenly, there in the office was someone
who shoved aside my work and boiled my water.
We hooked up once, but I have backed away be
cause I'm just not sure about combining work
with the pleasures of baking the love loaf. What
should I do?
Sincerely,
Chef Screw-r-dee
While people in glass houses shouldn't throw
stones — and it's true that Ms. Sass has both initiat
ed and no doubt ruined her fair share of newspaper
newbies and higher-ups — it still behooves me to
start this column with a little of the obvious from the
"Book of Love": Don't, don't, don't hook up with
your coworkers. The reasons are obvious — every
thing from the laughable success rate to the poten
tial office drama — so read on with this initial dis
claimer in mind.
That said, if you just can't resist that work
ing-girl booty, there are definitely a few key
tricks of the trade. First, make sure this is the
kind of girl who won't mind mixing it up with
you in the bedroom without causing a scene at
work. Don't get into it with someone who ex
pects any more — or any less, a la Roxy — than

you do. Needless to say, the last thing you need
is an office full of colleagues thinking you
abused the intern or got taken advantage of by
the new exec.
Don't use inter-departmental mail to return
left-behind items; earrings poking through your
correspondence are as obvious as making out in
the copy room. Keep squabbles — major or minor
— of! of the conference table, even if your mind is
still on how she can't leave the board room behind
when you're in the bedroom.
Also, the workplace necessitates a whole new
set of rules that complicate the game. You might
be able to send bland numbered e-mails to your
colleagues, but you'll probably have to spice
things up when you enumerate your feelings to
your paramour, so smith your words carefully lest
she think yoti are being terse.
Of course, as is always the case in matters of
the carnal, it goes deeper than that. To be worth
the risk of scandal at all, your lady has got to be
able to put it down in the bedroom. That doesn't
mean you have to jump into bed right away to
conduct an evaluation, but suffice it to say that if
she treats your belt-line like the Berlin Wall, you
might need to reassess. Unless, that is, you want
to add new-student orientation and peer tutor
ing to your list of office duties.
Finally, decide whether it's a long-term invest
ment or if you're in it for a quick buck. Any future
gains will certainly come at the cost of some office
harmony, so start compartmentalizing now to avoid
being swept away in a windfall.
But if you are just resorting to the office for a lit
tle excitement, Ms. Sass recommends you consider
buying James Bond Racing for Playstation 2 before
trying to create your own spy-thriller at work.
