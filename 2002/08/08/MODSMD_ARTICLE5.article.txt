## Rally held to protest proposed cuts by Bon Appetit 
### NEMIL DALAL EDITORIAL STAFF 
Protesting recently proposed layoffs by
the company, students and Bon Appetit
workers rallied at Tresidder Union on Mon
day and presented a letter to Jeffrey Wach
tel, senior assistant to University President
John Hennessy.
Citing a downturn in business, Palo Alto
based Bon Appetit Management Company
is trying to fire workers and convert certain
full-time positions to part-time positions in
the near future.
"Like many restaurants across the coun
try, Bon Appetit has experienced a decline
in business during the current economic
slowdown," wrote Marvin Rodriguez, the
general manager of Bon Appetit on cam
pus, in a letter to employees. "In order to
maintain high levels of service at all meal pe
riods, Bon Appetit will restructure hours of
operations at several campus cafes."
"We understand there need to be some
layoffs," said Roxana Rivera, work-site man
ager for SEIU Local 715. "Bon Appetit says
they have a sales drop of 40 percent. We
think [the proposed cuts] are too extensive."
In order to reduce costs, Bon Appetit will
layoff workers and close the Coffee House
from Aug. 11 till Sept. 9.
According to union members, Bon Ap
petit is aiming to cut 300 hours a week in
work. The company would do this by laying
off certain workers, while offering others
four-hour days. However, as part-time help,
the formerlv full-time workers would lose

many of the benefits currently guaranteed
to them.
About 30 students and workers, as part of
the afternoon rally, walked to the offices of
Hennessy and Bon Appetit management.
Several students attended Monday's
rally, including senior Megluma Reddy, a
member of the Stanford Labor Action
Coalition.
"A lot of people are invested in this,"
Reddy said, referring to the labor situation
with Bon Appetit. "A lot of people slept out
with us... We have people from all over the
country calling us to see how we're doing."
Students this past week met with Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Gene Awakuni to
discuss the labor issues. In the past, the Uni
versity's position has avoided getting in
volved between Bon Appetit, a private com
pany, and the company's own workers.
"We met and we talked about the situa
tion," Awakuni said. "Our position is un
changed. The University will not intervene
in a management-labor dispute. [The par
ties] had a collective bargaining process that
ran it's course."
A little over two months ago, the labor
union won a new contract that aimed to set
wage parity with Stanford Dining Services
over a two-year period. That agreement was
reached partly as a result of the student pres
sure put on both the University and Bon Ap
petit after more than 50 students slept in the
Main Quad over a four-day period.
"What they're doing with these layoffs is
undoing everything these students worked
for," said Zev Kvitky, president of United

Stanford Workers. "We haven't seen any
data that sales are low."
By holding a rally, and intensifying pres
sure on Stanford University, Rivera said, stu
dents and workers hope to get the adminis
tration to change their position.
"We're going to have to make this a situa
tion where Stanford checks in," Rivera said.
"[Bon Appetit management] feelfs] uncom

fortable when there are numbers."
"It was only two months ago that we had
a contract," Rivera added. "Now they want
to gut all those achievements."
Labor representatives and students say
they are waiting for Bon Appetit to provide
more information about the company's cur-
