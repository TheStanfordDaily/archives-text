# Stanford student's lawsuit alters SAT reporting system
## 
### AUDREY HARRIS 
Students with disabilities applying to col
lege no longer need worry that their SAT
scores will be accompanied by a flag.
The policy change is the latest result of a
1999 federal lawsuit brought against the Ed
ucational Testing Service by Mark
Breimhorst, a second-year Stanford Gradu
ate School of Business student who was born
without hands.
Breimhorst, who received his bachelor's
degree from Stanford in 1992 and a master's
in education in 1993, worked as a paralegal
and disability rights advocate at the Disabili
ty Rights, Education and Defense Fund for
five years before applying to business school.
After his applications were denied,
Breimhorst filed suit against the testing ser
vice in 1998, claiming that their addition of
the words "nonstandard administration" to
the score reports of students who receive ad
ditional time on standardized tests violated
the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act.
The International Dyslexia Association and
Californians for Disability Rights joined him
as plaintiffs. All the plaintiffs were represent
ed by Disability Rights Advocates, a non

profit group based in Oakland.
"I brought the complaint because I knew
the flag was discriminatory and it would not
help me with the admissions process,"
Breimhorst said.
In a 2000 ruling, San Francisco Federal
District Court Judge William Orrick denied
the testing service's motion to dismiss the law
suit, deciding that the tests should "equally
measure the skills of disabled and non-dis
abled test-takers." Assuming these condi
tions, Orrick deemed the flag unnecessary.
In its settlement, the testing service
agreed to stop flagging its own tests, which
include graduate entrance exams like the
GMAT and the GRE. In addition, it agreed
to review the flagging policies of The Col
lege Board, whose tests — including the
SAT, PSAT and Advanced Placement
Exams — it administers.
That review resulted in The College
Board's July decision to stop flagging scores
from non-standardly administered tests.
"[The exams administered by The Col
lege Board] are the ones you need to get into
college. You've got to get somewhere, and
it's good to get the young people in there,"
said Breimhorst, who now works in venture

philanthropy.
"I'm very proud and excited that... I was
able to play a role in helping younger [dis
abled] students have a shot at education."
Disability rights advocates hope that the
changes at the testing service and The Col
lege Board will encourage other testing
agencies, including those that administer
the ACT, the LSAT and the MCAT, to fol
low suit.
Critics of the new measures say that the
flag serves as a deterrent to students who
might consider making false disability claims
in hopes that extra time on tests will raise
their scores.
In 2000, California state auditors found
that wealthy, white private school students
were more likely to receive extra time on the
SAT. On the other hand, the parents and
schools of poorer students were less likely to
petition for extra time.
However, Breimhorst and other disabili
ty rights advocates say that the burden of
proof should fall on the doctors who certify
disabilities and the schools that grant stu
dents extra time, not on the score reports.
Fhe new flagging policy goes into effect
on Oct. 1, 2003, making the high-school

graduating class of 2004 the first group of
students to be affected by the change.
While Associate Dean of Admissions
Anna Marie Porras described the flag on
SAT score reports as "an unanswered
question" in a student's file, she said that
the flag does not necessarily indicate a dis
ability. For example, a student who has
broken her wrist and wears a cast might re
quire a non-standardly administered test.
And the admissions office is not told what
kind of accommodations have been grant
ed to a student.
For these reasons, Porras said she believes
that the flag is not discriminatory and will
not have a significant impact on admissions
results at Stanford.
Self-identification is a choice for disabled
students applying to Stanford, but Porras
describes disclosure of a disability as a help
ful "piece of the puzzle" that can help ex
plain weak areas in a student's application.
Porras also acknowledged that non-stan
dard administration policies can be source of
abuse. However, she said, Stanford will con
tinue to trust Fhe College Board to make
sure that only the students who need special
test accommodations get them.
