### JERRY LU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After almost two months of reno
vation, the Arrillaga Family Weight
Room reopened on Monday sport
ing a new floor, new benches, new
machines and a new attitude.
"It looks nice," said computer
science graduate student Manu
Kumar. "The floor is well done,
there are a lot more weights, and
the layout is a lot better."
"The old place was getting run
down, so I'm glad they renovated,"
he added.
The new gym includes much of
the same equipment as before, but
much of the older equipment has
been upgraded. The new floor
plan also separates the cardiovas
cular equipment from the weights.
A new set of regulations has
been putin place in order to main
tain order and cleanliness in Stan
ford's largest weight room.
Each weight rack and accessory

bin contains a set number of com
ponents, and stringent care is
taken by Arrillaga stall to make
sure all weights and bars are re
placed correctly.
In addition, each machine and
bench now has a default height
and weight setting that must also
be reset before leaving.
"We're just making sure that the
equipment is clean and that it is
easy to find weights," said junior
Alex Himmel, a front-desk staff
member. "We're trying to do a
good job of keeping this place in
good condition."
For anyone who can remember
the chaos of an over-capacity Arril
laga, these changes are a welcome
step in the right direction, although
some say that it doesn't address the
overcrowding of the old Arrillaga.
"I think the new rules are some
what impractical," said sophomore
Will Tang. "What we needed were
more benches, not somebody
telling us how to reset the bars."

The Department of Athletics
decided to renovate the weight
room when it became clear that the
old weight room wasn't meeting
the needs of the Stanford commu
nity.
"We were motivated by the new
football coach and program," said
Don Chu, the director of perfor
mance enhancement.
"When we stepped back, we saw
that the old room was outdated
and in great disrepair, and not
meeting the needs for any of our
groups, whether varsity sports,
staff or recreation."
The Varsity Weight Room,
which served as Arrillaga's replace
ment during renovation, will con
tinue to offer recreational hours
during the school year.
"We're going to maintain as
much of a facility in the Varsity
Weight Room [as possible]," Chu
said. "It may be a smaller place, but
is still as useful to the entire Stan
ford community."
