### WAYNN LUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On July 14, the Bid Evaluation Task
Force of the United States Olympic Com
mittee visited Stanford as part of a two-day
visit to the San Francisco area to evaluate
its suitability as an Olympic site. The com
mittee stayed for two hours, looking at var
ious parts of campus and how they might
be used in San Francisco's bid.
Stanford will play a crucial role in the
2012 Olympics if San Francisco is chosen as
the host city. San Francisco joins Houston,
New York and Washington, D.C., in sub
mitting a bid to the committee.
One of tbe changes that Stanford will
face is the renovation of Stanford Stadium,
making it into a better venue for Olympic
events. Under the preliminary bid, the

opening and closing ceremonies for the
games would be at the stadium.
"We know that Stanford Stadium can be
converted into an intimate football stadi
um, and that it can also be converted to an
Olympic track stadium," said Ted Leland,
director of the Department of Athletics.
Other parts of the bid include renovat
ing Maples Pavilion, Sunken Diamond and
the Avery Aquatic Center, as well as build
ing more stands for audiences.
"One of the biggest advantages of our bid
is that we don't have to build very much,"
said Tony Winnicker, the communications
director of the Bay Area Sports Organizing
Committee. "We can just rent from great
universities like Berkeley and Stanford."
Stanford would host all track and field
events, badminton, softball, archery and
the swimming and diving events.

A unique {Dart of the San Francisco bid
has Stanford leading the "Academic
Olympiad," a curriculum designed to edu
cate the public about different aspects of
the Olympic Games, from the mental to the
historical. Guest lecturers from around the
country would be invited to give presenta
tions before the games in 2012.
"Some professors are already involved
in putting together a curriculum for the
four years leading up to the Olympics,"
Winnicker said.
Representatives of Stanford say they are
optimistic about San Francisco's bid.
"We've got a premier faculty, a great
staff and the leadership capability to stand
out in all fields to motivate and captivate the
world," said Don Chu, director of perfor
mance enhancement in the Athletic De
partment.

A recent Washington Post article quoted
an unnamed U.S. official as saying that San
Francisco and Washington, D.C., have an
advantage over the other two cities being
considered by the United States Olympic
Committee. Though it was denied by the
USOC, the story encouraged members of
Bay Area Sports Organizing Committee.
"Stanford is really excited about playing
a role in bringing the Olympics to San
Francisco," Leland said.
Stanford is no stranger to hosting inter
national sporting events, having already
hosted games for the World Cup.
"Stanford benefited a lot from hosting
men's and women's World Cup games,"
Leland said.
