### KATIE TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Gerald Gunther, the William
Nelson Cromwell Professor of
Law emeritus and a constitu
tional law scholar at Stanford,
died at home on July 30 from

complications
related to lung
cancer. He was
75 years old.
Gunt h e r
was born in
1927 in Usin
gen im Taunus,
Germany, and
came to the

United States with his family in
1938. He grew up in New York
City and attended Brooklyn
College, finally earning a mas
ter's degree in public law and
government from Columbia
University. After using law case
books to teach political science,
Gunther decided to study law
formally and earned his law de
gree from Harvard University.
In 1956, Gunther returned
to Columbia University as a fac
ulty member at the law school.
He left there in 1962 to teach at
Stanford Law School, where he
remained until his retirement.
He also spent time as a visiting

professor at Harvard Law
School, the Illinois Institute of
Technology, Chicago-Kent Col
lege of Law, Brooklyn Law
School, Northwestern School of
Law and Arizona State Universi
ty College of Law.
Gunther was best known in
his field for putting together
the casebook, "Constitutional
Law in the 19605." The book
has been the most widely used
text on the topic ever since.
The casebook was described as
"the leading publication in the
field, from which a generation
of American lawyers have
learned constitutional law" by
the late Supreme Court Justice
Lewis F. Powell Jr.
Another of Gunther's well
known publications is "Learned
Hand: The Judge and the
Man," a biography of Judge
Learned Hand, who Gunther
clerked for before becoming a
professor. The book, the prod
uct of 20 years of work by Gun
ther, won the Erwin N. Griswold
Triennial Prize from the
Supreme Court Historical Soci
ety and the Triennial Award of
the ()rder of the Coif.
Gunther was favored at vari
ous points in his career for a po
sition on the U.S. Supreme
Court, and although he himself
never received an appointment,
he testified at the confirmation
hearing of Ruth Bader Gins
burg, one of his students from
his years at Columbia.
