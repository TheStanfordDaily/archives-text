One hundred and twenty years ago, a Saturday on the Palo Alto
Stock Farm would find young Leland Stanford Jr, riding his pony
and demonstrating his equestrian ability for his proud
parents, Leland and Jane.
His father, California Governor and soon to be US Senator
Stanford, was there to supervise the training and breeding of
nine world champion trotting and race horses who set thirty
world records!
Today, the beautifully restored Victorian barn and a life-sized
bronze statue of "Electioneer" pay eloquent tribute to the
crucial role that the Red Barn played in Stanford's amazing
history.
This year,The 13th Annual Red Barn Festival celebrates with a
spectacular panapoly of equestrian skill that would make
Governor Stanford himself lean back, smile and pat his ample
belly. Please join us!
