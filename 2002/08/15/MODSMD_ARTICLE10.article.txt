# LEMON HARANGUE PIE
## Hollywood defames a sacred institution 
### JOE LEMON STAFF COLUMNIST 
I'm never going to find true
love. Think about it. If Billy Bob
Thornton and Angelina Jolie
can't make it, how will 1 ever be
able to forge a marriage that will
last for all eternity?
1 was shadowing their every
move. I prepared a vial of my
blood for my betrothed to wear
around her neck. I sequestered an
unblemished section of my
alabaster skin to display my wife's
name like a cattleman's brand. I
sketched prospective tattoos of my
lover in seductive poses that
would make even the most ardent
3Com "Palma Sutra" fans blush.
Boy, was I ready.
Then, to everyone's amaze
ment, Hollywood's favorite mar
ried couple decided to call it quits.
And contrary to their continual
attempts to shock us with "public

displays of obsession," they picked
the most trite and jaded of reasons
to dissolve their matrimony:
"irreconcilable differences." Come
on, Angelina, throw us a bone. Tell
us that you're leaving Billy Bob
because he just won't do the lion
tamer act anymore or because he
won't get his spleen pierced with a
sharpened rib plucked from your
petite torso.
Why do stars and starlettes go
through the motions of getting
married anyway? Is it because
they're concerned that their
adoring public will puritanically
disapprove of them if they main
tain consensual romantic rela
tionships without pronouncing
their wedding vows? Somehow I
doubt that.
Do they want to have the
opportunity to throw a big party?
Unlikely, since they already com
plain about having to attend
their glamorous premieres and

post-Oscar fetes. In fact, they all
seem to want to escape the
paparazzi by fleeing to their
ranches in Montana.
Incidentally, why do celebrities
always shy from public attention?
Isn't that why they try to become
celebrities in the first place? Isn't
that what celebrity means?
Whatever the reason for their
ill-considered nuptials, they
make a mockery of the venerable
institution of marriage. What
part of '"til death do us part"
don't they understand? Are there
valid reasons to end a marriage?
Of course. It's challenging to
make a partnership last. All I'm
suggesting is that maybe these
stars should devote at least as
much attention to their decision
to get married as to their next
photo Opportunity — particular
ly if each event is really one and
the same.
By the time Jolie wed Thornton,

she was only 24 and already once
divorced. She appeared the
ingenue, however, compared with
her 45-year-olcl husband who had
been previously married four times.
Their courtship lasted all of two
months. Thornton's girlfriend at
the time, actress Laura Dern, only
learned of his relationship with Jolie
when she heard the two had gotten
married: "Hi honey, it turns out 1
won't be able to spend the weekend
with you after all, since I just mar
ried someone else."
To make matters worse, the
Thorntons recently adopted an
infant from Cambodia. Now a
small child's life will forever be
shaped by the arrogant familial
madness of this eclectic pair.
Don't get me wrong. I'm not
some kind of latter-day Dan
Quayle. By the way, can't you see
the former vice president's reac
tion to all of this? And you
thought Murphy Brown's single

parenthood was scandalous! He
must surely be spinning in his
grave — I mean, his political
future is dead, right?
I'm no prude. Believe me, I
want Jolie and Thornton to
explore the outer limits of their
intimacy together. Heck, 1
wouldn't even mind hearing the
details.
But, please don't insult the
institution of marriage. Play, have
fun, enjoy each other, take pic
tures and put them on the
Internet. America will still come
to your movies if you're living in
sin. And, don't worry, in the morn
ing, we won't respect you any less
than we already do.
