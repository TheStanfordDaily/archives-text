## Stanford favorite to defend title 
### EZRA CALLAHAN STAFF WRITER 
Because lie had won national champi
onships during his first two seasons as head
coach at Pacific in 1984 and 1985, there was
a natural question to ask Stanford head
coach John Dunning after last season's
NCAA championship game on Dec. 15 at
the Cox Arena in San Diego.
After guiding Stanford to its NCAA
record fifth women's volleyball champi
onship during his first year at the helm of
the Cardinal, a reporter had to ask during
the postgame press conference: "That
means he's going to win it again in his sec
ond year on the Farm, right?"
I listory is on Stanford's side — the Car
dinal was the last team to repeat as NCAA
champions, in 1996 and 1997.
The NCAA coaches seem to be putting
their money on history repeating itself, giv
ing Stanford the nod at No. 1 in the
AVCA/USA Today Coaches' Preseason Poll
with 54 of the 65 first-place votes. Volleyball
Magazine placed the same bet, tabbing the
Cardinal at No. 1 in its preseason poll as
well.
They will all get an early indication on
possible returns as Stanford heads to Min
nesota next weekend for the NACWA/State
Farm Classic, traditionally t he first games of
the season. The Cardinal will take on No. 14
Northern lowa a week from tomorrow —
just 10 days after its first preseason practice
— before facing either No. 8 Pepperdine or
Minnesota the next day.
"It's different this year since we're play
ing in a few days," said junior middle
blocker Sara McGee, one of the (lardinal's
four returning starters. "We're already
getting into system stuff and not just
doing the basics. It's a tough situation, but
the coaches know what they're doing and

we'll trust them."
Fhe rest of Stanford's preseason sched
ule doesn't look much easier with tourna
ments in Florida and at home likely pre
senting three more top-15 opponents.
But all of that will just be a warm-up for
Stanford's Pacific-10 Conference season.
No. 3 Southern California, No. 6 Arizona
and No. 11 UCLA stand in the Cardinal's
way of repeating as conference champs.
However, a late-season non-conference
match at No. 2 Hawaii on Nov. 10, which
could draw over 10,000 fans, may be the
Cardinal's toughest match of the season.
"This year's schedule looks harder than
the others we've had," said senior outside
hitter Ashley Ivy. "The tournaments in
Florida and Minnesota are going to be
tough, and the Pac-10 is the most difficult
conference, so that's enough to make fora
hard schedule. We never take it easy here, so
we're used to it."
Fortunately, the Cardinal lias a lot going
for it besides history this season.
At the top of that list is three-time All-
American outside hitter Logan Tom, who
will l(X)k to end her successful Stanford ca
reer on top. Foin has a shot at winning the
AVCA National Player of the Year honor
two years in a row. She received the award
last year after posting a school-record 621
kills and tallying 426 digs and 66 aces, each
the second-best single-season marks in Stan
ford history.
Tom's partner in crime on the left side
from last season, sophomore Ogonna Nna
mani, is also back. The second-team All-
American Nnamani will be a more rounded
threat in 2002 after exploding onto the na
tional scene last season with blistering at
tacking abilities that made her Volleyball
Magazine's National Freshman of the Year.
Polished defensive skills could give her dig
ging numbers this year to match the 3.89

kills per game she ran up last year.
"You can celebrate that you won fora bit,
but people forget about [last year] and we
need to go out there and win it again," Nna
mani said. "If you don't have an aggressive
mindset about it, then it won't happen. We
know how it feels to win it all, and if we don't
have it again, it'll be hard. We can't celebrate
anymore. We need to focus on the new sea
son."
The return of Ivy, who was second on the
team in digs and aces last season, gives the
Cardinal all three of its starting outside hit
ters from last season.
McC.ee, who led the Pac-10 in blocking
last season, is Stanford's other returning
starter. Junior jenn Harvey and freshman
Courtney Schultz will battle it out for the
middle blocker skit left open by the gradua
tion of'lara Conrad.
McCee and the other Cardinal middles
will have to overcome the departure of assis
tant coach Kim Oden. Oden, Stanford's all
time leader in blocks, left that position at the
beginning of the summer after guiding the
Cardinal to the top of the Pac-10 in blocking
the past two seasons.
Meanwhile, freshman Katie Coldhahn
will give junior Anna Robinson a run for her
money for the setter spot previously held by
Robyn Lewis.
Sophomores Leahi Hall and Jennifer
Hucke and junior Jamie Brownell (who sat
out the 2001 season) are in contention to be
the starting libera, the freely-substituting
back-row position adopted by the NCAA for
the upcoming year, two years after the posi
tion was implemented on the men's side.
With such a stacked roster, not to men
tion such an experienced coaching staff, it is
easy to see why people are betting early on
the Cardinal.
All that remains to be seen is whether
Stanford can make good on those bets.
