# Stanford loyal holds out hope for fifth trip to Omaha
## 
### CHAD GOLDBERG GUEST COLUMNIST 
It's been two months since the Cardinal
baseball team saw its season end at the hands
of the Texas Longhorns in a 6-5 defeat. And
almost ever)' day this summer, 1 still find my
self thinking about what could have been for
the veteran 2002 team.
And I am just a lowly broadcaster. The
players and coaches probably feel a lot worse.
For the Cardinal, the loss to Texas was the
fourth-consecutive year that its season has
ended in Omaha. This year, like 1999, the loss
occurred in the semifinals. In 2000 and 2001,
it happened in the finals.
After the loss to Texas in June, sitting high
above Rosenblatt Stadium well over an hour
after the game ended, after both teams had left
for their respective hotels, after the fans had all
gone home, several members of the Stanford
media (myself included) sat above the stadium
and mused about what might have been. In
stead of another game, or maybe a shot at the

National Championship game, rescheduled
flights (and in my case, a Greyhound Bus ride
back to Minneapolis) awaited.
In my mind, the job of the play-by-play
broadcaster is to objectively cover the action
that occurs on the field to the best of his verbal
ability. I lowever, while it may be my job to
broadcast Stanford baseball, I consider myself
above all else a fan. I am fortunate to watch
more games than anyone who is not a member
of the team or support staff. In addition, as a
student, I see the players not just as players,
but as friends as well. 1 pull for these guys to
win as much as they do themselves. So, when
they come up short, it hurts. It is difficult to
watch the dreams of many disappear in a
cloud of a burnt orange Texas celebration.
For baseball, more than any other sport in
college, the end of the season is very strange.
School is over, there are no practices or classes
left, and everyone goes their separate ways.
The players exchange cell phone numbers
and move on to the Cape Cod League, to the
U.S. National Team, or home to recuperate.

And everyone hastily packs up their hotel
rooms, wishing that one year from now the
(light will leave on Sunday with a Champi
onship trophy, rather than on Friday.
What do 1 think lies in store for the 2003
Cardinal? Hopefully, a season much like 2001,
as the teams will lie somewhat similar. The 2003
team will have some outstanding senior lead
ership with Ryan Carko behind the plate and
Ryan McCally (and likely Tim Cunningham)
returning for their senior seasons. The outfield
should be one of the best in the country. Fuld
and Quentin will return for their third seasons
and both are likely to be preseason all-Ameri
cans. Fuld even has the potential of being one
of the best players in the country next year.
So far this summer, two players are estab
lishing themselves in the Cape and look to be
big contributors next year. Danny Putnam,
after playing sparingly in 2002, is hitting .308
with three home runs. Not many guys hit .300
in the pitching-strong Cape league. And, per
haps more importantly, junior righthander
John Hudgins is dominating Cape Cod

League hitters. I Ie is 3-1 with a 1.06 ERA, iL
numbers of a potential number-one starter.
While the loss of All-American Jeremy
Guthrie will certainly hurt, if Cunningham
comes back, the rotation of Hudgins, Cun
ningham, and either Mark Jccmen, Ryan Mc-
Cally, Drew Ehrlich, or freshman Mark Ro
manczuk l<x>ks pretty g<x>d.
The infield is the question. With Brian
Hall moving to third base, an infield of Hall,
Tobin Swope at shortstop, Jonny Ash at sec
ond base and Donny Lucy, Chris Carter, or
Billy I'aganetti at first base is not the all-senior
infield of 2002. But, who knows? Given a
chance, those guys could be very solid. I'm
looking forward to 2003 already.
For the Cardinal and for me in 2002, it was
a great five months. II only it could have lasted
two more days.
