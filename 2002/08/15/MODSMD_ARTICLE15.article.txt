## 'Blue' surfs up high-tide ride 
### RAMIN SETOODEH EDITORIAL STAFF 
"Blue Crush" could have beeu about
"Baywatch" bimbos on surfboards, but it's
more thoughtful than that. The lead charac
ter, Anne Marie, is a young female surfer who
nearly drowned at a competition three years
ago and is trying to make a comeback. Her
friends are as intelligent as she is, although
they all need to work as hotel maids to sup
port themselves.

MOVIE REVIEW
BLUE CRUSH
DIRECTED BY:
JOHN STOCKWELL
UNIVERSAL
OPENS
TOMORROW

The movie was adapted from a magazine
art icle called "Surf Girls of Maui" and direct
ed by John Stockvvell, whose last film
"crazy/beautiful" starred Kirsten Dunst as
the troubled daughter of a Congressman
who found love with Jay Hernandez. Stock
well has an ability to portray teenagers as
they really are: insecure, awkward and full of
doubt; his films are the polar opposite of any
thing starring Freddie Prinze Jr.
In "Blue Crush," he juggles the surf ele
ment with all the other standard subplots
that are usually found in films targeted for
teenagers — only they are not usually exe
cuted this well.

Kate Bosworth plays Anne Marie, the fall
en athlete who is trying to the reestablish her
reputation. She lives in Hawaii with her two
best friends (Michelle Rodriguez and Sanoe
Lake) and younger sibling Penny (Mika
Boorem), who is rebellious and stubborn —
two traits she probably picked up from her
older sister.
For most of the film, Anne Marie is sup
posed to be preparing fora big surfing tour

nament called the Pipe Masters in Oahu,
where the waves carry so much weight they
have been known to kill surfers. But instead,
she falls in love with a NFL quarterback
named Matt (Matthew Davis) who comes to
the island and wants her to give him surf les
sons. Their dialogue borders on silly banter,
but at least the actors are playful enough to
