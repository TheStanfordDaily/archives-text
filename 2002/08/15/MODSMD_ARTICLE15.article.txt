## 'Blue' surfs up high-tide ride 
### RAMIN SETOODEH EDITORIAL STAFF 
"Blue Crush" could have beeu about
"Baywatch" bimbos on surfboards, but it's
more thoughtful than that. The lead charac
ter, Anne Marie, is a young female surfer who
nearly drowned at a competition three years
ago and is trying to make a comeback. Her
friends are as intelligent as she is, although
they all need to work as hotel maids to sup
port themselves.

MOVIE REVIEW
BLUE CRUSH
DIRECTED BY:
JOHN STOCKWELL
UNIVERSAL
OPENS
TOMORROW

The movie was adapted from a magazine
art icle called "Surf Girls of Maui" and direct
ed by John Stockvvell, whose last film
"crazy/beautiful" starred Kirsten Dunst as
the troubled daughter of a Congressman
who found love with Jay Hernandez. Stock
well has an ability to portray teenagers as
they really are: insecure, awkward and full of
doubt; his films are the polar opposite of any
thing starring Freddie Prinze Jr.
In "Blue Crush," he juggles the surf ele
ment with all the other standard subplots
that are usually found in films targeted for
teenagers — only they are not usually exe
cuted this well.

Kate Bosworth plays Anne Marie, the fall
en athlete who is trying to the reestablish her
reputation. She lives in Hawaii with her two
best friends (Michelle Rodriguez and Sanoe
Lake) and younger sibling Penny (Mika
Boorem), who is rebellious and stubborn —
two traits she probably picked up from her
older sister.
For most of the film, Anne Marie is sup
posed to be preparing fora big surfing tour

nament called the Pipe Masters in Oahu,
where the waves carry so much weight they
have been known to kill surfers. But instead,
she falls in love with a NFL quarterback
named Matt (Matthew Davis) who comes to
the island and wants her to give him surf les
sons. Their dialogue borders on silly banter,
but at least the actors are playful enough to

have fun with the material.
Anne Marie: "Are you trying to
buy me?"
Matthew: "1 don't want to lose
you."
"Blue Crush" succeeds because
the story remains grounded and
real, even when it deals with ele
ments that might stretch the limits
of plausibility. Most films for
teenagers conclude at the big high
school prom, and almost every
one appears to be a contrived car
icature. In "Blue Crush," all the
characters are treated as smart
and sane, and react to problems as
we expect they would in life.
There is a scene where Penny
sneaks out to a crowded party and
Anne Marie tries to bring her
home. The confrontation plays
with the claustrophobic accuracy
of a documentary: the two sisters
shove one another as the on-look

ers watch them with hypnotized
fascination. On the I)VI) commen
tary track to "crazy/beautiful,"
Stockwell said that he cast people
off the street in small cameo roles
to give that film an authentic look
and feel. Here, he appears to have
done the same.
The surfing scenes also look
great. The camera pans in and out,
beneath and above the water; and
the sense of danger and excite
ment that accompanies the sport is
well portrayed.
The last sequence, at the Pipe
Masters, winds down to one of
those moments when the hero
must confront all her fears and
take on a wave that will win her
fame, fortune and a contract with
Billabong. It's predictable, yes, but
that doesn't mean it's any less fun
to watch.
The only problem with the
tournament is that the rules aren't
adequately explained, and it's dif
ficult to tell who Annie Marie's
competitors are. But hey, at least
no one is wearing a prom dress.
