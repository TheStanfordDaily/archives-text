# Aniston does good job in 'Good Girl'
## 
### MICHAEL BAER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Films about people stuck in lives they don't
want are becoming increasingly common. The lat
est in a list that includes "American Beauty," "Boys

Don't Cry" and "Fight Club"
is "The Good Girl," in which
Jennifer Aniston stars as Jus
tine, a woman is stuck in sur
burban Texas. As with charac
ters from the aforementioned
films, she latches onto the first
thing that seems to offer her
hope of getting out, if only
temporarily. And, as in the

other movies, this one is about how such choices
can lead to traumatic consequences.
Justine's life consists of a boring retail day job
and nights with her husband Phil (John C. Reilly),
who is well-meaning but dulled by pot and televi
sion. Phil spends most of his time with friend and

Co-worker Bubba (Tim Blake Nelson). She is also
surrounded by cheery Christian baby boomers
and bitter Gen-Xers, and despondent that this is
the life she's doomed to live.
Her situation, however, seems a sentence
wholly appropriate for someone so weak-

willed. Justine never takes any
definitive measures to improve
her life. She berates her hus
band for smoking pot, but
never tells him how unhappy
she really is.
Eventually, Justine meets some
one else equally maddened by life
(JakeGyllenhaal). 1 le is a male co
worker eight years her junior

who lives with his parents and reads "The Catcher
in the Rye" on the job. I le renames himself Hold

town, that makes him stand out
to Justine as someone who could
be her only real friend and possi
bly more. Her recognition of his
angst is enough for Holden to
want Justine. Both characters
feel liberated by the effects of
their newfound relationship
until Justine realizes Holden is at
best a child and at worst menially
ill. The events triggered by her
infidelity turn out to make her
life more constrained, instead of
less.
Both Aniston's performance
and the script itself betray Justine's
culpability in her position and illu
minate the ways in which we all
often make decisions — going with
the flow and doing what feels best
for now. As such material could
easily sink, it is commendable that
the film succeeds.
Much has been made of this
being Aniston's break-out role, a
role that finally gets her respect as
the shopworn comedy of
"Friends" winds down. It may be
that Aniston lucked into fame, but
this movie shows that she can act
as well as most other stars. She
does right by this role of a former
"good girl" with layers of needs
and behavior.
Each layer is simple enough to
provide the viewer with a charac

ter we can see pieces of ourselves
in, and together they form a com
plex enough character to guide
the film along.
The real strength of the movie,
though, is provided by director
Miguel Arteta, producer Matthew
Greenfield and writer Mike White.
Their previous film, "Chuck and
Buck," also dealt with complex re
lationships — it was about a man

who stalks his childhood friend
and hopes to reconnect with their
past.
The subtlety of major and minor
supporting roles — and the fact the
plot twists never veer into Holly
wood predictability — add to the
movie's overall effect. In spite of
some cliches inherent in the overall
concept, the movie works and is
well worth seeing.
