# 'Beach,' a funny ball

### TIFFANY LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's really about the hats. Don't
understand what I mean? Go and
see "Beach Blanket Babylon."
Steve Silver's off kilter, non
stop-action cabaret vaudeville act
is one of the longest running hit
musicals in theater history, play
ing for sold-out crowds since
1974.
It's hard to describe exactly
what genre the musical falls
under. "Beach Blanket Babylon"
combines singing, outrageous cos
tuming, big hats, big hair and bad
puns; the show is a true liberal San
Francisco response to the world of
pop culture.
But in the end, the production
lacks something. Although there
are definitely many funny and
memorable moments, something
is oddly unsatisfying about the
plot — or lack thereof.
The story line is about a Snow
White character who is traveling
around the world and looking for
true love. Along the way, she en
counters many pop culture
icons — some of them very
funny, others not so successful.
Yet the story does not come to
gether as coherently as it should,
and many of the scenes don't
have the sense of cohesiveness
they need.
The costumes are one of the
best parts of the whole produc
tion. One character wears a hat of
San Francisco, complete with a
working trolley and flashing lights
that stretches across the stage.
Who knew hats came in that size?
And who can resist Tina Turn

er's four-feet-tall hair complete
with the layering effect? In fact,
the woman who plays Tina Turn
er (Renee Lubin) puts on a mar
velous performance. The
overemphasis of her hair, swish
ing it back and forth, is constant
comedy and her singing is power
ful and timeless.
Another actor who puts on a
wonderful and economical per
formance is Val Diamond, the lip
curling obnoxious character who
follows Snow White through her
tour of the world. He is accompa
nied with a complete line of male
background singers who don
cowboy uniforms, with hats and
boots, and croon the song
"Ooooooklahoma!" at the top of
their lungs. Stretch your imagi
nation to the farthest limit,
stretch it even further, and it's
even funnier than that.
And what pop culture spoof
would be complete without pok
ing fun of the present day queen
of pop, Britney Spears?
And what would a rendition of
a Spears song be without the
schoolgirl outfit, the ponytails
and her MTV bikini-looking en
semble?
The parody of this particular
pop star is so true to life and so ex
aggerated that it is laugh out-loud
funny. It's something you should
see for yourself.
Although not perfect, overall
the musical is funny, zany and just
plain fun.
"Beach Blanket Babylon" is
playing at Club Fugazi in San
Francisco, Wednesday through
Sunday. For ticket information,
call (415)421-4222.
