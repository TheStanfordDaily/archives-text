# Roxy Sass cuts her losses
## Cashing in your chips when the love dice come up snake eyes 
### 
This week, Ms. Sass takes a cue from the rapidly
collapsing summer relationships around her to ex
amine the wonderful world of deal-breakers —
those few things for which no amount of peripher
al perfection can compensate.
The most obvious of deal-breakers is undoubt
edly style; it's what you see first, the wife-beater and
bucket hat that make you swoon. While we're all dif
ferent, there are a few universals, and chief among
them: footwear. Sneakers sans socks — or worse yet,
sandals with socks — is simply non-negotiable.
Along the same lines, if he wears more jewelry than
you do or spends more time spiking his hair and
reading Esquire (or even worse, Playboy) while his
mud-mask sets in, it's probably a safe bet that he will
never find you as beautiful as he finds himself, so
fold now while you still can.
Of course, if style is a deal-breaker, it stands to
reason that cars are, too. (Boys, before you get your
petticoats in a bunch, that isn't to say it's Ferrari or
forget it.) Rather, drive a car that fits your style so
the rest of us can be forewarned. Still, men, if your
style is a car that's white, a Jetta, a Honda CR-V or a
Rav4, you might as well just ride your bike, com
plete with streamers and a basket, onto the freeway.
Similarly, ladies, don't name your car, pet your car
or subject your car to more than the necessary up
holstery and accessories; nothing says "Clueless"
like shag seat-covers.
Also, if your paramour's passion is landing a star
ring role on "Passions," you might want to recon
sider involving yourself with such a person — that
is, someone who wants to be paid for playing a char
acter who's come back from the dead twice, only to
be caught in a love triangle with brothers. Of
course, also beware of anyone whose teen idol is
Strom Thurmond, especially when you only have
eyes for Bill Bradley. While you shouldn't judge

your partner by the bulge in his pocket (and I mean
his wallet), ambition should certainly be a factor in
your assessment.
Another red flag is someone who can't name his
favorite Sports Center tag-team. And if you're seeing
a guy who doesn't know the difference between Kobe
Bryant and Kobe, Japan, you might want to cut him
from your 25-man roster. If your lite revolves around
the seasons — and I mean football and baseball —
and your girl thinks that Milton Bradley only manu
factures board games, it might be time to mathemat
ically eliminate her from postseason play.
Finally, speaking of sports, Ms. Sass must weigh
in on another of the most oft-overlooked markers of
cool. Just as your cars should indicate matching ap
proaches to the road, it's simply not going to work
if you order a wine spritzer to her Guinness, or vice
versa. As a general rule, though, Coors Light and
Keystone are a death sentence, at least for those
under 60 or on the coasts.
At this point, you should be saying, "But what
about the sex, Roxy?" Easy, tiger; we're getting there.
To start, even if he's spent many years in the
minor league system, be wary of a man looking to
make his major league debut with you. While he
may act like he's been there before, he hasn't, and
while he might hit it like Ichiro, most rookies strug
gle before finding their major league groove. For
those of you less-versed in America's pastime, read:
Do it like a virgin, not with a virgin.
On the flip side, if he regales you unceasingly
with tales of his prowess, he's probably a worse
hook-up than your average virgin. While adequate
foreplay is definitely a deal-breaker, using 20 min
utes of the requisite six Maxwell songs to recount
your most memorable sexual conquests is not the
way to get the job done, so lick those lips and pre
pare to nibble some earlobe and suck a few toes.
If foreplay tells you about the marriage, then du
ration can probably inform about the divorce. The
two-minute (wedding night) sweat session is the
best advertisement for evaluating your partner's
skill before walking down the aisle;
doing so will save you the pricey
trips to the therapists and lawyers
that are sure to follow. He doesn't
have to go into extra innings every
time, but a solid effort, along with
a double-header every week or
two, is a reasonable baseline.
And who could forget oral sex?
Two major points for this deal
breaker: First, do it; it's fun (and
an essential part of any sex-savvy
skill-set). Second, technique, tech
nique, technique. I ( you're closing
in on 30 and still trying to figure
out the vagina, chances are you
can stop now because you won't be
close to one any time soon.
And now it's time for Ms. Sass to
sign oft. I'll leave you with this: If
each one of these is individually a
deal-breaker, then any combina
tion thereof is a catastrophe. Su
perficial they may be, but at the
end of the day, you aren't dating
for keeps, and neither is he.

al perfection can compensate.
The most obvious of deal-breakers is undoubt
edly style; it's what you see first, the wife-beater and
bucket hat that make you swoon. While we're all dif
ferent, there are a few universals, and chief among
them: footwear. Sneakers sans socks — or worse yet,
sandals with socks — is simply non-negotiable.
Along the same lines, if he wears more jewelry than
you do or spends more time spiking his hair and
reading Esquire (or even worse, Playboy) while his
mud-mask sets in, it's probably a safe bet that he will
never find you as beautiful as he finds himself, so
fold now while you still can.
Of course, if style is a deal-breaker, it stands to
reason that cars are, too. (Boys, before you get your
petticoats in a bunch, that isn't to say it's Ferrari or
forget it.) Rather, drive a car that fits your style so
the rest of us can be forewarned. Still, men, if your
style is a car that's white, a Jetta, a Honda CR-V or a
Rav4, you might as well just ride your bike, com
plete with streamers and a basket, onto the freeway.
Similarly, ladies, don't name your car, pet your car
or subject your car to more than the necessary up
holstery and accessories; nothing says "Clueless"
like shag seat-covers.
Also, if your paramour's passion is landing a star
ring role on "Passions," you might want to recon
sider involving yourself with such a person — that
is, someone who wants to be paid for playing a char
acter who's come back from the dead twice, only to
be caught in a love triangle with brothers. Of
course, also beware of anyone whose teen idol is
Strom Thurmond, especially when you only have
eyes for Bill Bradley. While you shouldn't judge

your partner by the bulge in his pocket (and I mean
his wallet), ambition should certainly be a factor in
your assessment.
Another red flag is someone who can't name his
favorite Sports Center tag-team. And if you're seeing
a guy who doesn't know the difference between Kobe
Bryant and Kobe, Japan, you might want to cut him
from your 25-man roster. If your lite revolves around
the seasons — and I mean football and baseball —
and your girl thinks that Milton Bradley only manu
factures board games, it might be time to mathemat
ically eliminate her from postseason play.
Finally, speaking of sports, Ms. Sass must weigh
in on another of the most oft-overlooked markers of
cool. Just as your cars should indicate matching ap
proaches to the road, it's simply not going to work
if you order a wine spritzer to her Guinness, or vice
versa. As a general rule, though, Coors Light and
Keystone are a death sentence, at least for those
under 60 or on the coasts.
At this point, you should be saying, "But what
about the sex, Roxy?" Easy, tiger; we're getting there.
To start, even if he's spent many years in the
minor league system, be wary of a man looking to
make his major league debut with you. While he
may act like he's been there before, he hasn't, and
while he might hit it like Ichiro, most rookies strug
gle before finding their major league groove. For
those of you less-versed in America's pastime, read:
Do it like a virgin, not with a virgin.
On the flip side, if he regales you unceasingly
with tales of his prowess, he's probably a worse
hook-up than your average virgin. While adequate
foreplay is definitely a deal-breaker, using 20 min
utes of the requisite six Maxwell songs to recount
your most memorable sexual conquests is not the
way to get the job done, so lick those lips and pre
pare to nibble some earlobe and suck a few toes.
If foreplay tells you about the marriage, then du
ration can probably inform about the divorce. The
two-minute (wedding night) sweat session is the
best advertisement for evaluating your partner's
skill before walking down the aisle;
doing so will save you the pricey
trips to the therapists and lawyers
that are sure to follow. He doesn't
have to go into extra innings every
time, but a solid effort, along with
a double-header every week or
two, is a reasonable baseline.
And who could forget oral sex?
Two major points for this deal
breaker: First, do it; it's fun (and
an essential part of any sex-savvy
skill-set). Second, technique, tech
nique, technique. I ( you're closing
in on 30 and still trying to figure
out the vagina, chances are you
can stop now because you won't be
close to one any time soon.
And now it's time for Ms. Sass to
sign oft. I'll leave you with this: If
each one of these is individually a
deal-breaker, then any combina
tion thereof is a catastrophe. Su
perficial they may be, but at the
end of the day, you aren't dating
for keeps, and neither is he.
