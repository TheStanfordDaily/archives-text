# BIG BROTHER 3 Watch
## 
### 
The fifth week in the "Big Brother 3" house
brought brought a surprise so large that our jaws
didn't just drop to the floor, they plummeted.
Here's what happened:
THURSDAY, AUGUST 8. The houseguests
voted on who to evict from the love nest that Lisa and
Eric had built. When the ballots were tallied, we
learned that the vote was tied. Yup, just like in Flori-

da. Fortunately, the rules of the
"Big Brother" house operate a little
better than those of the electoral
college. A tie meant Gerry, last
week's Head of Household, need
ed to act as the tiebreaker.
He rattled another metaphor
about playing chess in classic eru
dite form (we don't understand
him half the time either) and an-

nounced that he wanted to evict Eric. That meant
the firefighter from Millford, Conn, was a goner (as
we, once again, predicted).
Or was he?
In a twist that still has us shaking or heads in dis
approval, host Julie Chen notified Eric and the
viewing audience that one of the four houseguests
who had been evicted would return to the house.
You confused? We'll explain: Contrary to popular
belief, when Lori, Tonya and Amy left the house,
they did not return to their own boring lives.
Instead, they were whisked away to undisclosed
locations around the world so that they wouldn't be
recognized or watch the show. (Also contrary to
popular belief, fine television like "Big Brother 3"
is not broadcast around the world.) For instance,
Tonya — the single mother of five who had breast
implants that swelled larger than the Goodyear
blimp — was transported to a mysterious island in
the Carribean. In the three weeks she's been there,
she shopped for thongs and tanned in the sun.

Who does she think she is, Anna Nicole Smith?
Please, we coulcl watch E! television lor such trash
(and, for the record, we do).
In any event, the interview ended with Eric
thrilled at the new twist. No, it wasn't at the thought
of seeing Lisa (he told Chen she was the "right per
son ... for right now") but to win the cash prize.
Meanwhile, the houseguests competed for
Head of Household. The winner? Chiara.
SATURDAY, AUGUST 10. We hovered around
our television screen Saturday night, bursting with

excitement only to learn that —
drats! — that the show was pre
empted by a game of football. CBS,
don't you know that the most excit
ing sport of the summer is "Big
Brother 3"?
Need not worry, our East Coast
correspondents posted a detailed ac
count of the episode on die Internet.
In the episode, Chiara made the

toughest decision of her life. She needed to decide
which two houseguests to nominate for eviction.
Her choices? Josh and Roddy.
Yes, she is dating Roddy. But she nominated him
for eviction because she thought that he's such a
darn friendly guy that none of the other house
guests would vote him out over Josh.
No one ever said Ms. DUI was the sharpest knife
in the drawer, but it does bear some pondering that
three of the last four houseguests who were evicted
from the house were also initially used at "decoys."
Could her plan backfire? Let's just say that she
doesn't have Gerry's vote of confidence. "I know 1
swore on the soul of my dead mot her [to Chiara not
to vote against Roddy]," Gerry said, "but 1 think my
dead mother would understand."
We hope that's not a lesson he teaches at school.
WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 14. Lisa won veto.
Josh cried at his miserable plight in life. Lisa chose
not to use veto.
OUR PREDICTION: If the houseguests were
smart, they'd break their word to Chiara and vote
out Roddy — the biggest threat so far.
But Josh has irked too many to slip by this
time. He'll be voted out, and probably by a unan
imous tally.
