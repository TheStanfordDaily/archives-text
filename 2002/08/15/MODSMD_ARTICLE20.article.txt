Director Peter Jackson's "The Fellowship of the Ring" is a true
epic, bringing the much-loved novel by J. R. R. Tolkien to life as
only a I lollywood team with an obscenely large budget could.
"Fellowship," the first film in a proposed trilogy, is set in
Tolkien's Middle Earth, a fantastic world inhabited by graceful
elves, gruff dwarves and the diminutive, childlike hobbits. It tells

the story of Frodo Baggins
(Elijah Wood), a hobbit who
finds himself in the posses
sion of an immensely power
ful ring, sought by the evil
Sauron. Heeding the warn
ings of the eccentric wizard
Gandalf (lan McKellen),
Frodo and his loyal friend
Sam (Sean Astin) flee home,
with sinister black-cloaked
riders on their heels.
Jackson's film is far from
perfect. Most often, the
movie's problems are exactly
those of the book: the mind
numbing cuteness of the
hobbits, the occasional sub
stitution of racism for char
acterization and Tolkien's re
actionary fear of any kind of
change.

Yet for all its flaws, "Fellowship" remains an absorbing, powerful
film. Tolkien's plot, with its large-scale battles, noble sacrifices and
impossible odds, is even more compelling through the trimming of
screenwriters Jackson, Frances Walsh and Philippa Boyens. The
film also succeeds in conveying the deep history and enormous
wonder of Tolkien's world. In particular, the first shots of the vast,
cavernous depths of Moria remain breathtaking through second,
third and fourth viewings.
The recently released two-I)VI) set of "The Fellowship of the
Ring" is only the economy-sized version of the upcoming four-disc
extended edition and it shows. Most of the extras are either adver
tisements for the extended edition and the upcoming sequel, "The
Two Towers" or recycled television specials. They're mildly inter
esting, but hardly justify the existence of a second disc. The movie
is the only real reason to buy the I)VI), but that's reason enough.
