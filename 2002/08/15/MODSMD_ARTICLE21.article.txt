# Summer no vacation for Cardinal hoopsters

### TERRY HURLBUTT EDITORIAL STAFF 
It's no secret that the men's basketball team
will face some distinct challenges this season.
I lowever, the team is not too worried.
With Casey Jacobsen and Curtis Borchardt
gone early to the NBA, the rest of the Stanford
basketball team returned to campus for the
summer determined to prepare for the season
ahead.
"I felt last year sometimes when we lost we
were physically handled a little bit and even
mentally handled a little bit by teams that were
really aggressive," head coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "I wanted to try to change that. 1
wanted us to get together as a group and try to
develop these younger players into a certain
work ethic."
And what a work ethic it is. The team lifts and
conditions for four hours a day, four days a
week, take yoga, do individual skill work and
then play pick-up games for an hour or more.
The goals of such a regiment are fairly sim
ple, but critical.
"My personal goals over the summer have
been becoming a better all-around athlete,"
saitl sophomore Josh Childress. "I've been
working on my strength, agility, speed, lateral

quickness and my basketball skills."
Though the loss of Borchardt removes one
of the main enforcers from the Cardinal's ros
ter, the team appears increasingly confident in
its ability to challenge the toughest teams it
could face — especially in the Pacific-10 Con
ference.
"The lifting we do will help us more than
the lifting we have done in the previous years,"
said junior Matt Lottich. "The fans will see our
opponents getting thrown down this year.
There will be no repeats of USC this year. No
team will beat us because they are physically
stronger."
And after losing its leading rebounder and
leading scorer, confidence is a good thing for
the team.
"They've got to feel better about them
selves physically," Montgomery said. "They
know they've put in a pretty good summer
of work and I think that will show up next
year. A lot of confidence comes from just
working hard and feeling good about your
self physically."
Physical improvement was not the only
thing on the summer agenda.
The Cardinal's tumultuous 20-10 season
last year was saved in large part thanks to the
efforts of its NBA candidates — the numbers

from last season show that either Jacobsen or
Borchardt were high scorers in 26 of the
team's 30 games while Borchardt finished as
high rebounder in 25 games.
While such facts might worry lesser teams,
Stanford has used this summer to acknowl
edge its weaknesses and work to produce a
new crop of leaders and strengthen the team
for the challenges ahead.
"I thought it critical for them to stay to
gether as much as possible and develop a
new group of leaders," Montgomery said.
"The scoring and the leadership and the
play that's going to win is going to have to
come from different players. Other people
are going to have step up. 1 don't think
we're going to do it with one person. It has
to be a collective thing with everyone re
sponsible for it."
It's a call to action most of the team seems
eager to embrace.
"I do feel a little more pressure, but I am ex
cited about it," said Lottich. "For two seasons 1
played a back-up role to Casey and now 1 will
have the opportunity to play more and show
what 1 can do on the court."
"We are 'supposed' to have a down year,"
Childress said, "but I, as well as my teammates,
know that the hard work we are putting in in

side the weight room is going to pay off."
Outside the gym, the team lias been taking
advantage of the lazy days of summer to sim
ply get to know one another, fostering better
interaction both on and off the court.
"The team has become a lot closer," Lot
ticli said. "Guys have learned to really enjoy
one another's company. There are not many
other students on campus and as a result we
pretty much only hang out with each other."
Even the incoming freshmen joined the
team fora few weeks earlier in t he summer, ac
climating to the intense workout schedule
while getting to know their new teammates.
As the summer closes, the results of such
close company have become tangible.
"They do know each other a lot better and
1 think they have more respect for one anoth
er," Montgomery said.
How the season will unfold is anyone's
guess. There will be plenty of obstacles fin this
Cardinal squad to overcome or simply break
down, but its preparation this summer has
given it a heady confidence in its own abilities.
"I think we feel this is going to be a fun
year," Childress said. "There is no pressure
on us. We know what we're capable of and
we're going to come out and lay it on the line
every game."
