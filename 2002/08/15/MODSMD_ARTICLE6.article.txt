## URO lets undergrads explore their passions 
### ANTHONY HA STAFF WRITER 
Senior Clea Kaske is spending her vacation far from the
quiet of the Stanford campus, studying the operation of in
ternational courts in the Hague, Netherlands.
Kaske, one of 307 students whose summer research is sup
ported in some way by the Undergraduate Research Pro
grams office, has been watching trials, including that of Slo
bodan Milosevic, and interviewing officials in the United
States Embassy, the Dutch ministry of foreign affairs and in
the courts, which include the International Tribunal for the
former Yugoslavia (I(TIT) and the International Criminal
Court (ICC).
"It's proved extremely difficult to get in touch with peo
ple," Kaske said.
"Important officials and government representatives in
particular are very hard to contact, and often it's not easy to
get interviews ... There existed a general reluctance to criti
cize the United States on an official level; and most people
tried to be rather careful in what they said."
Kaske, who comes from Greece, explained that she has al
ways been interested in the Balkans, an interest that grew
after she spent last summer working with a youth group in
Kosovo.
"Most of all, I loved being together with people who often
work on a very idealistic basis, and truly believe in what they
are doing," she added. "The Dutch were also very, very
friendly, and open-minded, and I loved the Netherlands and
the Hague."
According to Laura Selznick, associate director of URP,
there were 530 projects submitted for grants this year. Gen
erally, 80 percent of students who apply receive funding.
Among the reasons that Selznick cited for turning down
applications were a lack of proper faculty support, projects
that are not research (such as payment for summer intern
ships), weak research methodology or a lack of proper acad
emic preparation.
She noted that this summer, there were particular trou
bles and delays for some projects due to the State Depart
ment's warning
about travel to India.
"As of November, if the State Department gives a location
a travel warning, then we can't give a student money to go

there," Selznick said. "Students don't necessarily think that
the world's politics will interfere with their projects, but we
want them back safe."
Selznick added that some students who had been hoping
to do research in India changed their project, while others
waited until the warning was lifted on June 27.
Alison Kahmi, like Kaske, is a senior spending her sum
mer in Europe. Kahmi is using interviews with citizens in the
East German cities of Berlin and Rostock to study their per
ceptions of recent political and economic developments and
the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall.
When asked about the development of her project, she
cited her experiences studying abroad at Stanford's pro
grams in Paris and Berlin.
"It has been, and continues
to be, a summer that seems
like a dream."

"Experiencing firsthand such major European devel
opments as the introduction of the Euro and the rise in
popularity of extreme right-wing politicians in France,
the Netherlands and Germany peaked my interest in con
temporary social and political movements in Europe,"
Kahmi said.
"They convinced me that I wanted to center my thesis on
a very recent historical event and its continued influence."
In addition to her research, Kahmi is working for the RAA
(Regionale Arbeitsstelle fur Jugendhilfe, Schule und in
terkulturelle Arbeit), which attempts to integrate immigrants
into the community and combat neo-Fascism. In this role, she
helped organize the Rostock Freedom Festival, a 10-year
memorium of the violent neo-Nazi uprising against the Viet
namese population of Rostock in 1992.
A little closer to home, senior Leif Granberg is interview
ing Bay Area users of mobility devices.
"I'm investigating how people experience the devices and
machines that they use for mobility," Granberg said. "I am
looking at how the attributes of human-machine interaction
can be manipulated to enable richer and more intuitive coor

dination between the user and the device."
As a non-traditional student who came to Stanford 10
years after his earlier university experience, Granberg has
been involved with many activities that he said sparked his
fascination with human-machine interaction — activities that
ranged from working for five summers with physically dis
abled children to contact improvisation, a dance form devot
ed to intuitive physical motion with a partner.
Granberg said that one of the pleasant surprises in his re
search was simply reading the previously published literature
on the topic.
"As someone who has primarily studied engineering and
natural science, I'm accustomed to a world where people
make one cautious statement per paper," he explained.
"This summer I've been reading in a discipline where peo
ple write these wild, stream of consciousness papers, hitting
so many notes that it takes five readings to just sort out what
they're even saying."
Another senior, Golda Philip is interviewing women for an
ethnographic study of the dowry system in the southern In
dian state of Kerala.
"A dowry is what the bride's family gives to the groom's
family (wealth like cash, material goods, gold, etc.) to make a
wedding happen," Philip said.
"So parents of girls feel like they need to pay up in order
to make sure that they can marry off their daughter. Kerala
is considered to be one of the most educated states in India,
so I'm asking the women, why, with so much education, is the
dowry system, a clear demonstration of the low status of
women, still occurring."
Philip has been videotaping these interviews, and said that
she hopes to turn the footage into a film when she returns to
Stanford. She pointed out that as someone whose parents
were born in Kerala, the issue was not just an academic one.
"My cousins, who are of marriageable age, are victims of
the system, and if my parents had not come to the States,
there's a good chance I would have been also," she said. "I
was a bit bothered by always reading about Kerala as the
model state. 1 knew it had its good and its bad, like every
where else ... but this dowry system, a very present bad, is
one I'm interested in learning about more, understanding
and contributing to stopping it."
