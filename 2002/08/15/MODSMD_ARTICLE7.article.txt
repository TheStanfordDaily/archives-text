# Students unperturbed by major construction project

### ERIN ARCHERD JEFF EGER CONTRIBUTING WRITERS 
On July 1, workers began necessary road
repairs between Serra Street and Lasuen
Mall, blocking access to portions of Santa
Teresa, Panama and Duena Streets near
Tresidder Union.
Facilities Operations lias shut down parts
of these roads to all traffic, including bicy
clists and pedestrians. The goal of the
$650,000 project include the addition of
sidewalks as well as better storm drainage
and flood protection.
"This work is a combination of upgrades
to improve accessibility to the area by adding
pathways on both sides of Duena and Pana
ma and also regrading needed to redirect
large storm water Hows overland through
the site to prevent flooding of the church
and main quad areas," explained Anne Ord

ing, the engineer in charge of the project.
The construction area is especially large
because it encompasses two different sites.
"There are two projects going on at once,
on Panama and Serra, but it was unavoid
able," said Mike Goff, director of facilities.
"We needed to redirect the storm Hows and
elevate the streets to avoid flooding the mu
seum and the library again."
Facilities was concerned that people
would find the detours confusing.
"We've had to redirect traffic and make
alternate ways available. We've added extra
signs which should help," said Goff.
To some, the barriers, orange tape, noise
and detours are an inconvenience, to others,
an eyesore, but for most, the construction is
no big deal
Vincent Terrapon, a doctoral candidate
in mechanical engineering whose office
overlooks some of the construction, was not
bothered by the work outside his window

"It won't last forever. It's not a big detour,
so it's OK," he commented.
Liz Thomas, a junior taking classes during
the summer quarter didn't know what the
construction was for, but said, "There's always
construction going on on campus. The noise
is annoying, but you just have to deal with it."
Others shared similar sentiments about
the construction around Tresidder. People
find the detours an inconvenience but are
not concerned about going out of their way.
Ording has had very few complaints about
the project, though some people have been
concerned about the noise levels during cer
tain phases of the construction, detours
around the site and why the work is necessary.
"These concerns were resolved through
direct responses to the individuals and by
providing additional signage and informa
tion about the project," said Ording.
The majority of the construction around
Tresidder should wrap up by the end of this

month, before students return for fall quar
ter. Planting, irrigation and some finishing
work will extend beyond that date.
With construction projects currently taking
place all over campus, most students seem to
be taking the sights, sounds and detours in
stride, a g<x>d thing considering how many
projects are planned for future months.
The less hectic summer months provide
a perfect opportunity to undertake major
construction projects around campus. Fa
cilities Operations is currently in charge of
over two dozen construction projects
around campus.
