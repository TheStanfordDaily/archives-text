# Bon Appetit workers continue protest

### NEMIL DALAL EDITORIAL STAFF 
The labor dispute between Bon Appetit man
agement and workers continued as students and
workers rallied inside and outside Bon Appetit's
Tresidder Union location on Friday.
The noontime rally was precipitated by the
firing and reorganization of hours for Bon Ap
petit's workers, as the company faces growing
problems in the slow economy.
"We had a battle for fair wages and they took
it away from us," said Tyson, a Bon Appetit
worker who refused to give his last name.
"Three days ago they put up a schedule and
that's how we found out [about the changes],"
translated junior Leticia Ramirez, Stanford
Labor Action Coalition co-coordinator.
"We're putting pressure on [Bon Appetit
management] to hopefully change. It's not fair
what they're doing," Tyson continued.
Carrying signs and shouting slogans like
"Bon Appetit shame on you," about 25 students
and workers walked through the company's
Tresidder location during the lunch hour as
numerous customers looked on. Then, the
group walked into the office of Bon Appetit
Management Company before marching to
President John Hennessy's office where they
held signs up to windows of the locked office.
"We're here today faced with some losses,"
said Mitch Bousson, chief steward of United
Stanford Workers. "We're not going to quietly
sit down and take this."
"Are we going to fight? Damn right."
The administration has steadfastly main
tained that this is solely a dispute between work
ers and management and refused to get in
volved.
Vice Provost of Student Affairs Cene Awaku
ni said that the University has no control over
the decisions made by the Bon Appetit manage
ment.
"Bon Appetit is a tenant in Tresidder. They
pay us rent and are thereby allowed to operate
their food service business," said Awakuni.
"We don't get involved in any management

decisions they may make, just as we would not
get involved in the management decisions made
by other tenants of Stanford-owned property."
He also pointed out that the parties involved
have rights and are protected in the collective
bargaining process.
"We believe it is important to honor that
process. Should either party have any griev
ances regarding the actions taken by the other
during the collective bargaining process or in
violation of a contract, that party has legal re
course," Awakuni explained.
"We talked to [Provost] Etchemendy," said
Clara Webb, a co-coordinator of SI AC. "He
would not meet with us, reiterating the position
that the University would not get involved."
Provost Etchemendy explained that it would
be unfair to interfere on either side's behalf.

"We are not going to put pressure on Bon
Appetit to run a money losing operation, just as
we would not put pressure on the union to set
tle for lower wages," he said.
As part of their collective bargaining agree
ment, workers filed a grievance against Bon
Appetit in the days following the rally. Man
agement has five days to respond, and if unsat
isfactory, workers can submit their grievance to
a binding arbitration decision.
"Like other legal matters, [arbitration] is
not a quick process," said Roxana Rivera,
work-site manager for SEIU Local 715. "But it
is a way in which the company can be held ac
countable for lost wages and benefits of affect
ed employees."
"In one month, Stanford students will be
back and we're pissed off," said Webb.
