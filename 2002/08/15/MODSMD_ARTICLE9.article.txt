## DISPATCHES FROM THE OUTER DARKNESS The
						unbearable lightness of fleeing 
### MARK GANEK STAFF COLUMNIST 
The escape is harder than the
entrance. Just ask Houdini. He
probably won't answer. He'll just
make decaying sounds, which I
believe is an elegant restatement
of the thesis writ large.
Departure has been a recent
preoccupation, since I'll be scrap
ing off the moss that has gathered
around my feet and setting off for
new pastures. As I have noted
before in this space, it has been a
full six years since I first arrived as
a fresh-faced youngster.
Six years is a long time. To give
you some perspective, if you had
dropped a blue marble into a jar
each day since my arrival at
Stanford, today you would have a
very large jar of blue marbles.
Staggering, isn't it?
Back then 1 was naive and full
of life, rather than the desiccated
shell of a man that now shuffles
about, muttering about politics
and the price of a soul. But now I

seek rejuvenation, a rebirth in the
baptismal font of change. And to
complete the W.C. Fields quota
tion: "Wherever you go, there you
are. Except somewhere else."
The first key to a successful
departure is stealth, thereby
avoiding the requisite emotional
scenes that take place at any good
bye function. The response to
your departure should take place
about two weeks afterward, when
someone comments, "1 haven't
seen so-and-so lately."
And of course you've changed
your name to so-and-so, which is a
very stealthy name. Many ninjas
are named so-and-so.
The second key is avoiding last
minute emotional redefinitions.
After packing one's knick-knacks
into carefully labeled boxes, one's
impulse is to order the rest of
one's life accordingly. All interper
sonal relationships brought to
suitable closure, carefully classi
fied, splayed and pithed like ento
mological specimens.
Unfortunately, the basis of most

healthy relationships is ambiguity,
misunderstanding or outright
falsehood. Without these benefi
cial mists, most relationships
would wither away in the unfor
giving sun of honesty. Even worse,
the heat could trigger a kind of
emotional chain reaction.
For example, say you've failed
the stealthy portion of your
departure and you are being
thrown a going-away party. These
events are fraught with danger, as
your imminent departure will
make an attractive friend nostal
gic. Then she will think about the
transience of life and feel herself
slipping into the dark waters of
mortality contemplation, and
then she'll grab whatever is near
by to serve as a flotation device.
And it may be your whatever.
Then you would have a compli
cated situation that involves some
serious talking and working out of
emotional damage. And you
might even have to make a return
visit to smooth everything over,
when you should probably be

spending that money on a sweet
neon beer sign for your new place.
In addition, publicizing your
imminent departure would force
you to give back all the stuff you've
borrowed from other people. And
you need that stuff, otherwise you
wouldn't have borrowed it in the
first place. You may feel a little
guilty about this, thinking, "I'm
taking advantage of my friends
like some kind of vulture."
This is simply not the case.
Vultures at least have the courtesy
to let their victims die before they
rip into their innards. You're more
of a parasite. However, many par
asites are gaining respectability,
with the recent discovery that anti
coagulants in leeches are useful
for reattaching severed extremi
ties and John Ashcroft becoming
attorney general.
To balance out your bad-bor
rower karma, you should give
away the stuff you don't need. In
this way, you can also simulate
unfelt emotion through the distri
bution of goods, using the same

principle as a birthday present for
the boss or an engagement ring.
As a last resort, if you need to
escape the emotional pressure
cooker of a going away party, lead
a sing-along of "Leaving on a Jet
Plane," and while everyone is
teary-eyed and tunelessly yowling,
throw down a few of those ninja
smoke bombs and make your
escape, so-and-so-san.
But above all, one should
always leave a place before there is
nothing left to miss, because by
that time you have waited too long
and your life has ground to a halt.
And there is nothing like a geo
graphic shift to drive home the
point that tomorrow is another
day, unless it isn't, because you're
running on borrowed time.
Especially since that's not your
watch.
