# Musharraf amends constitution
## Pakistani president grants himself additional powers, institutionalizes role of military

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) — Despite widespread
criticism, President Gen. Pervez Musharraf unilateral
ly amended the Pakistani constitution Wednesday,
granting himself sweeping powers — including the
right to dissolve parliament — and extending his
term in office.
"Pakistan is passing through a very crucial transi
tional period," Musharraf told reporters in announc
ing his decision to implement the amendments, which
were first unveiled in June. "We are taking Pakistan
from democratic dictatorship to elected democracy. I
want to introduce a sustainable democratic order."
Critics, however, claimed the 29 amendments were
a blow to the very democracy that Musharraf
promised to restore by holding elections Oct. 10 for
the national parliament and provincial legislatures.
"We don't believe that an individual or group has
the right to amend the constitution," said Raza Rabbai
of the opposition Pakistan People's Party, led by for
mer Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. "This is the sole
prerogative of the parliament."
Other amendments formalized an additional five
years in office for Musharraf that he won in a contro
versial referendum in April. He also gave the military a
formal role in governing the nation for the first time by
setting up a National Security Council that would over
see elected rulers — and include military officials.
"Musharraf has grabbed all the power and the next
prime minister will be helpless," said Nawabzada Nas
rullah Khan, head of the opposition Alliance for the
Restoration of Democracy.
Musharraf seized power on Oct. 12, 1999 in a
bloodless coup that toppled Prime Minister Nawaz

Sharif. The Supreme Court ruled that the coup was
legal but insisted that civilian government be restored
within three years. Musharraf'called elections for Oct.
10 — two days short of the deadline.
However, Musharraf, like many of his colleagues in
the senior ranks of the armed forces, has accused pre
vious elected administrations of failing to govern prop
erly. He has promised to build a "guided democracy"
in which elected leaders would be held accountable
through a series of "checks and balances" contained in
the amendments.
One of them grants the president the authority to
dissolve parliament, a power which the late President
Mohammed Zia ul-Haq decreed but which was abol
ished by Sharif.
Another amendment set up the National Security
Council, chaired by the president, to oversee the per
formance of parliament, the prime minister and his
government. The council will also include the leader of
the opposition in parliament, the military chief of staff
and heads of the army, air force and navy.
That gives the armed forces a formal role for the
first time in the ruling of a country that has been
under military rule for about half its 55 years of inde
pendence.
Musharraf insisted, however, that he would trans
fer governing powers to the new prime minister who
will be chosen by parliament and denied that the mili
tary would have a role in governance.
"The National Security Council has absolutely
nothing to do with running the country," Mushar
raf said. He said its role would be limited to consul
tation on strategic issues and matters of national im
portance.
During his press conference, Musharraf said the
next parliament would have the authority to abolish
the amendments if opponents can muster the votes.
He insisted, however, that they were necessary for sta
bility and accountability in government.
