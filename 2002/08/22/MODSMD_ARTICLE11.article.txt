## Federal appeals court refuses to halt incoming student program 
### 
RICH MON I), Va. (AP)—A feder
al appeals court refused Monday
to halt a program to expose new
students at the University of North
Carolina to information about the
Quran.
Attorneys fora conservative
Christian group on Friday had
asked the 4th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Richmond to stop
Monday's discussion sessions of a
book that interprets the Islamic
holy text. Members of the Vir
ginia-based Family Policy Net
work and three unidentified
UNC-Chapel Hill freshmen con
tended the assignment was un
constitutional.
A three-judge panel of the ap
peals court rejected the motion,
ruling that "the appellants have
failed to satisfy the requirements

for such relief."
The brief ruling contained no
further explanation.
A lower-court judge in Greens
boro, N.C., had rejected the plain
tiffs' arguments on Thursday.
Terry Moffitt, board chairman for
the Family Policy Network, said
the group had no plans to appeal
to the U.S. Supreme Court.
About 4,200 incoming fresh
man arid transfer students were as
signed to read about 130 pages of
"Approaching the Qur'an: The
Early Revelations," by Michael
Sells, a religion professor at Haver
ford College.
The Christian group said the as
signment should have been pro
hibited because it promoted Islam.
Lawyers for UNC-Chapel Hill said
such a ban would mean a loss of
free speech rights for students.
A university committee selected
the book after the Sept. 11 terror
ist attacks to introduce students to
unfamiliar ideas shared by about 1
billion Muslims around the world,

state attorneys said in a court brief
filed Saturday.
The reading and the two-hour
group discussions Monday after
noon were also designed to initiate
students into the university's intel
lectual life, state attorneys said.
Officials had said a new student
could decline the assignment but
would have to write an essay ex
plaining why. But they have also
said that students who do nothing
face no sanctions. In previous
years, they said, about 50 percent
to 60 percent of new students have
participated in the summer read
ing program.
"Participation has been ex
pressed as a requirement; but
there has never been any adverse
consequence for students who do
not participate, other than their
own self-chosen loss of a learning
opportunity," state attorneys said.
Of the students who brought
the suit, one is evangelical Christ
ian, one is Roman Catholic and
one is Jewish.
