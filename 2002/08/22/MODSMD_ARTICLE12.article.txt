## LEMON HARANGUE PIE Caught looking at another called strike 
### JOE LEMON STAFF COLUMNIST 
I don't know why baseball gets
more than three strikes. 1 mean, I
know the rules of the game. Three
strikes, you're out.
But since 1972, Major League
Baseball has endured eight sepa
rate strikes or lockouts. When can
we finally declare the game of
baseball out, over and done with?
Let's face it: baseball is a terrible
game. It's hardly athletic and it's
painfully boring. Defenders of the
game will appeal to your sense of
tradition, and refer to it as Ameri
ca's pastime. Heck, even Congress
has made a special exception for
baseball by excluding it from an
titrust laws.
However, my suspicion is that
baseball only narrowly beat out
games like lawn bowling and
watching paint dry to become

America's pastime. A lot of smart
people have advocated a lot of stu
pid positions over the years. Ben
jamin Franklin wanted to make
the turkey a national symbol. Just
because someone decided some
thing a long time ago doesn't nec
essarily make it the right choice.
Even modern observers can be
misguided. Sure, political com
mentator George Will might think
baseball's pretty sexy, but let's re
member that Will himself has
probably never been described
that way.
The childish disagreement be
tween owners and players serves
as a reminder that baseball is a
game that should played by chil
dren, not grown men. The focus
of the dispute, of course, revolves
around money. Owners with
more money than God buy teams
to round out their menageries of
assets.

Players with personal salaries
in excess of the GDPs of reason
ably sized developing nations
complain that they're indentured
servants. In fairness, this is a bit of
an exaggeration: Alex Rodriguez
only makes about 60 percent as
much money in a year as the is
land nation of Sao Tome and
Principe and only 30 percent as
much as Kiribati.
Who finances this battle of
greed? Young parents who blow
more than $ 100 to take their fami
ly of four to a game and buy a
round of hot dogs bear a signifi
cant proportion.
Another contentious issue cur
rently is drug testing of the play
ers. Increasingly, sluggers'
physiques are swelling like
they're jacked up on cocktails of
steroids, creatine and bovine
growth hormone. The balls may
be flying out of the parks with un-

precedented frequency, but the
players may want to investigate
the effects on their reproductive
organs. There may be an inverse
correlation to the increase in the
mass of their biceps.
Owners generally support the
testing, while players are resisting
it. I saw a recent interview with
home run specialist Barry Bonds
during which he asserted that he
supported voluntary, but not
mandatory, drug testing of play
ers. Uh, Barry, you can do the vol
untary testing now â€” that's what
voluntary means.
It's not that I particularly care
about Bonds's long-term physical
well-being. What I do worry about
are the school kids who look to
these behemoths to replicate their
training regimens in hope of hit
ting a few extra dingers of their
own.
The timing of the potential

strike is also disconcerting. As the
first anniversary of Sept. 11 ap
proaches and America continues
to rely on familiar traditions as the
country heals, do we really need a
bunch of avaricious egomaniacs
mucking with this piece of Ameri
cana?
Let's teach the owners and
players a lesson. Boycott the ball
parks now. Go to a little league
game or watch the WNBA, where
players actually care about win
ning and not just their bank ac
counts. Maybe then the big lea
guers will be more appreciative for
the millions of dollars we foolishly
throw at their feet.
