# Non-profits can aid development
## 
### QI ZHAI GUEST COLUMNIST 
Editor's note: This column is part one of
a two-part series. See next week's Stan
ford Weekly for part two.
It's now the last quarter of my
summer internship at the World
Association of Newspapers in
Paris. It's time to finish up proj
ects, reflect on what has hap
pened in these past few months
and think about how it will affect
the months to come.
After three years at Stanford,
I'm now fully programmed to think
in terms of quarters. The Stanford
student lives and thinks in three
month chunks. Even when we
bump into friends on campus, we
say, "What were you up to last quar
ter, I barely saw you? What classes
are you taking this quarter? What
are your plans for the summer?"
I like the "mental quarter sys
tem." It makes me take time out of
my busy schedule and think
about the big picture of why I'm

doing what I'm doing. It's a good
way to periodically assess what
I've learned and how I can apply
it to the future.
So what have I done in the last
couple months that will be a valu
able experience for the fall and
beyond? This summer was the
first time I've worked at a non
profit organization. Although I've
contributed to a few non-profit
independent projects with
friends and attended some rele
vant talks, I had never before con
sidered full-time involvement
with a non-profit.
The reason for that is, prior to
this summer, I considered myself a
hard-core pragmatist. I thought
non-profits achieved few practical
results. This mentality may be an
other Stanford syndrome, one that
especially plagues students milling
about the economics department.
I thought that the pursuit of
higher societal ideals — democra
cy, legal accountability, freedom
of speech and all that — accom
plishes very little, especially in

less-developed countries. For
these countries, it's especially true
that every occurrence in the
world is an economic phenome
non. Only when people have ful
filled their need for food and shel
ter can they afford to think about
morals, rights and freedoms.
Only when a society has sur

passed its "hunger point" can
people take a greater interest in,
and make significant achieve
ments in, attaining these higher
ideals.
When a large part of a country
still teeters on the poverty line, no
one listens to selfless activists pro
moting higher ideals. The eco

nomic problems at hand are far
more pressing. Therefore, we
should wholeheartedly devote
ourselves to developing the
economies of these countries as a
means to the end of elevating their
social and political standards. Be

fore this summer, that was my view.
The work I've done this sum
mer has softened this hard-core
pragmatism. I now question
whether economic success will
necessarily lead to improvements
in social, political and legal struc
tures. Perhaps there will never be
a bright and clear finish line
down the path of economic devel
opment. A country that has been
single-mindedly pursuing eco
nomic development may find it
difficult to shift gears and start
pursuing higher ideals. Organi
zational inertia and simple habit
would keep propelling people to
set aside socio-political concerns
in favor of economic pursuits.
This is where non-profits are
needed. Social workers and ac
tivists should always be there to
remind the establishment of what
lies outside the economic box.
They need to keep pushing the
finish line closer, telling govern
ments and organizations that now
is the time to make change in
non-monetary ways.
Previously, I measured the
value of non-profit work by what
numeric result it achieved. So
when 1 read about symbolic ges
tures in the newspapers — court
cases and politicians showing up
at soup kitchens on holidays — I
disregarded these non-profit vic
tories as insignificant because they
mean so little in terms of the num
ber of people being fed, getting an
education or earning a stable in
come. I was convinced that these
little symbolisms don't contribute
to social progress nearly as much
as billion-dollar World Bank loans
and infrastructure projects.
But that was only because I was

using the wrong scale to measure
the value of non-profit work. If I
recognize that countries face trou
bles other than economic ones, 1
should also see that the impact of
non-profit work couldn't be ade
quately measured based on sim
ple numbers. And no, the symbol
ic acts don't mean much for now.
But for the long-term develop
ment of a society or a country, they
mean an indispensable amount.
Without the non-profits and
the activists, no one would be
pushing the finish line and telling
governments that it's time to start
working on higher non-monetary
standards. Without organizations
to constantly remind us of the
many non-economic goals that
need to be accomplished, the
world's developing countries
may, at best, evolve into "new Sin
gapores" — countries with im
pressive records for their econo
my but inadequate for democracy
and freedom of expression.
1 now think that successful eco
nomic development does not nec
essarily lead to the attainment of
higher social standards.
Therefore, even as a country is
enthusiastically building its econ
omy, someone needs to keep
pushing for economic successes
to be translated into social suc
cesses. Someone needs to make
sure that a country doesn't put off
improving social, political and
legal structures and rights so far
into the future that they are for
gotten. That someone is the non
profit organization, the social
worker and the activist, which I
previously regarded so lightly.

passed its "hunger point" can
people take a greater interest in,
and make significant achieve
ments in, attaining these higher
ideals.
When a large part of a country
still teeters on the poverty line, no
one listens to selfless activists pro
moting higher ideals. The eco

nomic problems at hand are far
more pressing. Therefore, we
should wholeheartedly devote
ourselves to developing the
economies of these countries as a
means to the end of elevating their
social and political standards. Be

fore this summer, that was my view.
The work I've done this sum
mer has softened this hard-core
pragmatism. I now question
whether economic success will
necessarily lead to improvements
in social, political and legal struc
tures. Perhaps there will never be
a bright and clear finish line
down the path of economic devel
opment. A country that has been
single-mindedly pursuing eco
nomic development may find it
difficult to shift gears and start
pursuing higher ideals. Organi
zational inertia and simple habit
would keep propelling people to
set aside socio-political concerns
in favor of economic pursuits.
This is where non-profits are
needed. Social workers and ac
tivists should always be there to
remind the establishment of what
lies outside the economic box.
They need to keep pushing the
finish line closer, telling govern
ments and organizations that now
is the time to make change in
non-monetary ways.
Previously, I measured the
value of non-profit work by what
numeric result it achieved. So
when 1 read about symbolic ges
tures in the newspapers — court
cases and politicians showing up
at soup kitchens on holidays — I
disregarded these non-profit vic
tories as insignificant because they
mean so little in terms of the num
ber of people being fed, getting an
education or earning a stable in
come. I was convinced that these
little symbolisms don't contribute
to social progress nearly as much
as billion-dollar World Bank loans
and infrastructure projects.
But that was only because I was

using the wrong scale to measure
the value of non-profit work. If I
recognize that countries face trou
bles other than economic ones, 1
should also see that the impact of
non-profit work couldn't be ade
quately measured based on sim
ple numbers. And no, the symbol
ic acts don't mean much for now.
But for the long-term develop
ment of a society or a country, they
mean an indispensable amount.
Without the non-profits and
the activists, no one would be
pushing the finish line and telling
governments that it's time to start
working on higher non-monetary
standards. Without organizations
to constantly remind us of the
many non-economic goals that
need to be accomplished, the
world's developing countries
may, at best, evolve into "new Sin
gapores" — countries with im
pressive records for their econo
my but inadequate for democracy
and freedom of expression.
1 now think that successful eco
nomic development does not nec
essarily lead to the attainment of
higher social standards.
Therefore, even as a country is
enthusiastically building its econ
omy, someone needs to keep
pushing for economic successes
to be translated into social suc
cesses. Someone needs to make
sure that a country doesn't put off
improving social, political and
legal structures and rights so far
into the future that they are for
gotten. That someone is the non
profit organization, the social
worker and the activist, which I
previously regarded so lightly.

ford Weekly for part two.
It's now the last quarter of my
summer internship at the World
Association of Newspapers in
Paris. It's time to finish up proj
ects, reflect on what has hap
pened in these past few months
and think about how it will affect
the months to come.
After three years at Stanford,
I'm now fully programmed to think
in terms of quarters. The Stanford
student lives and thinks in three
month chunks. Even when we
bump into friends on campus, we
say, "What were you up to last quar
ter, I barely saw you? What classes
are you taking this quarter? What
are your plans for the summer?"
I like the "mental quarter sys
tem." It makes me take time out of
my busy schedule and think
about the big picture of why I'm

doing what I'm doing. It's a good
way to periodically assess what
I've learned and how I can apply
it to the future.
So what have I done in the last
couple months that will be a valu
able experience for the fall and
beyond? This summer was the
first time I've worked at a non
profit organization. Although I've
contributed to a few non-profit
independent projects with
friends and attended some rele
vant talks, I had never before con
sidered full-time involvement
with a non-profit.
The reason for that is, prior to
this summer, I considered myself a
hard-core pragmatist. I thought
non-profits achieved few practical
results. This mentality may be an
other Stanford syndrome, one that
especially plagues students milling
about the economics department.
I thought that the pursuit of
higher societal ideals — democra
cy, legal accountability, freedom
of speech and all that — accom
plishes very little, especially in

less-developed countries. For
these countries, it's especially true
that every occurrence in the
world is an economic phenome
non. Only when people have ful
filled their need for food and shel
ter can they afford to think about
morals, rights and freedoms.
Only when a society has sur

passed its "hunger point" can
people take a greater interest in,
and make significant achieve
ments in, attaining these higher
ideals.
When a large part of a country
still teeters on the poverty line, no
one listens to selfless activists pro
moting higher ideals. The eco

nomic problems at hand are far
more pressing. Therefore, we
should wholeheartedly devote
ourselves to developing the
