# Non-profits can aid development

Editor's note: This column is part one of
a two-part series. See next week's Stan
ford Weekly for part two.
It's now the last quarter of my
summer internship at the World
Association of Newspapers in
Paris. It's time to finish up proj
ects, reflect on what has hap
pened in these past few months
and think about how it will affect
the months to come.
After three years at Stanford,
I'm now fully programmed to think
in terms of quarters. The Stanford
student lives and thinks in three
month chunks. Even when we
bump into friends on campus, we
say, "What were you up to last quar
ter, I barely saw you? What classes
are you taking this quarter? What
are your plans for the summer?"
I like the "mental quarter sys
tem." It makes me take time out of
my busy schedule and think
about the big picture of why I'm

doing what I'm doing. It's a good
way to periodically assess what
I've learned and how I can apply
it to the future.
So what have I done in the last
couple months that will be a valu
able experience for the fall and
beyond? This summer was the
first time I've worked at a non
profit organization. Although I've
contributed to a few non-profit
independent projects with
friends and attended some rele
vant talks, I had never before con
sidered full-time involvement
with a non-profit.
The reason for that is, prior to
this summer, I considered myself a
hard-core pragmatist. I thought
non-profits achieved few practical
results. This mentality may be an
other Stanford syndrome, one that
especially plagues students milling
about the economics department.
I thought that the pursuit of
higher societal ideals — democra
cy, legal accountability, freedom
of speech and all that — accom
plishes very little, especially in

less-developed countries. For
these countries, it's especially true
that every occurrence in the
world is an economic phenome
non. Only when people have ful
filled their need for food and shel
ter can they afford to think about
morals, rights and freedoms.
Only when a society has sur

passed its "hunger point" can
people take a greater interest in,
and make significant achieve
ments in, attaining these higher
ideals.
When a large part of a country
still teeters on the poverty line, no
one listens to selfless activists pro
moting higher ideals. The eco

nomic problems at hand are far
more pressing. Therefore, we
should wholeheartedly devote
ourselves to developing the
economies of these countries as a
means to the end of elevating their
social and political standards. Be
