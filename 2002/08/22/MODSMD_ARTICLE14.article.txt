# Media gets a positive spin
## 
### MELISANDE MIDDLETON GUEST COLUMNIST 
I recently read some Stanford
research on how the media affects
children and I started wondering
what miracles — maybe even
good ones — TV, computers and
video games are doing to people.
Academic approaches to the
media and children are usually
just criticism: It's too passive, it
turns them into couch potatoes,
it's not sociable enough and it's a
lousy surrogate mother. But if
this research were to look deeper,
it would probably find that media
also has some beneficial effects on
children.
I can't think of a more media
deprived upbringing than my
own childhood: no TV at home,
no computer and no violent
movies, not even any video
games. 1 was so convinced that
video games were evil, I didn't
even sneak away to play them at a
friend's place.
I played Super Mario Brothers
on a classmate's Game Boy twice
in fifth grade, and I'm still on a
guilt-trip about it to this day. So
what did I miss out on?
Many pro-media arguments
say that many programs are edu
cational. "Sesame Street" has that
let-me-teach-you-something ap
peal to it, and"The Simpsons"
has an extra intellectual touch.
Video games can plunge you into
a virtual fantasy world that helps
build your imagination. And
from a more cynical perspective,
one can even argue that media is
useful as a babysitter.
The media provides an array
of alternative realities, and in
doing so exposes us to much
more than we could ever normal

ly experience in a lifetime. It is a
language of many dialects: picto
rial, auditory, cultural and highly
social. For example, the Internet
provides access to an extensive
communication network.
You can virtually experience
the seven continents, foreign
friendships, masses of informa
tion, violent catastrophes and
erotic pleasures.
How does the media fashion
our minds? It is quick-moving
and diverse. It also demands in
cessant shifting and readapting of
attention. This is especially true
for video games, whose purpose
is interaction with what's happen
ing on the screen. Certainly this
astonishing velocity of cognitive
movement conditions our minds
in some way.
Therefore, exposure to the
media iniglu increase intellectual
awareness and alertness. Perhaps
it even accelerates abstract think
ing or the ability to associate and
juxtapose ideas. Perhaps our
minds are inspired by the multi
ple worlds juxtaposed in video
games, or the Web's myriad and
simultaneous hypertext links.
T he media can lead us to as
sume that everything is possible,
since on the screen, it is. This ex
pansive view of the world sculpts
our minds. Certainly our percep
tions are a far cry from the rural
medieval village for which reality
extended no farther than some
rolling hills at the horizon.
If research were done on the
media's positive effects on chil
dren as much as the negative,
parents as well as kids would dis
cover a healthier attitude toward
the screens, speakers and
Play Stations that constantly
scream and buzz at us. It seems

ironic that we engage so routine
ly in this entertainment and still
criticize it.
Criticizing its portrayal of vio
lence and sex only worsens the
experience by making both par
ents and kids feel guilty about
whatever they're viewing. A first
step in the right direction would
be to grab hold of.the media in
stead of letting it grab hold of
you.
The media grabs hold of a
young child's attention and does
n't let go. There's no end to its in
triguing virtual worlds, which
makes our curiosity insatiable.
TV programs run on for what
seems like forever, new video
games are always being adver
tised and the Web never ceases to
intensify.
To resist this temptation for
ever-unfolding novelty, we must
remember that the media is a
tool. It's up to the individual to
choose when and how to use it, or
to prescribe when and how to
their children. If we figured out
precisely how the media changes
society, these questions of when
and how could be more effective
ly defined. Playing devil's advo
cate on the topic is easy, consider
ing how little research has uncov
ered about its effects on people.
Surely the media can't be too
bad, we think, in an effort to reas
sure ourselves of our sanity. Re
search on its positive effects is un
doubtedly in the works, but until
there are spectacular findings,
the arguments will remain un
convincingly stereotypical and
negative.
