# Last-minute ramblings on procrastination
## 
### WILL OREMUS GUEST COLUMNIST 
After 2 a.m., life's complica
tions start to become easier to
sort out. Distractions fade into
the background, petty concerns
disappear from view and the
specter of impending responsi
bility resolves into sharp focus as
deadlines near.
And, if the twinkling stars are
aligned just right, pages of jum
bled notes will arrange themselves
into a marvelous symphony of a
midterm paper, much like the
campy opening sequence of a fea
ture presentation at the AMC.
Otherwise, it's just another wasted
all-nighter, for what looks like a
masterpiece in the caffeine-fueled

glow of a frantic night often re
veals itself as a lot of overwrought
drivel in the cruel light of day.
Therein lies the rub on pro
crastination. It is a disease, and
the afflicted are always sleepwalk
ing a thin line between triumph
and disgrace. Not to mention
mixing their metaphors. How do
1 know so much about the sordid
life of a procrastination junkie,
one might ask? 1 would tell you,
but I don't have time; this col
umn is due in under an hour.
Affixed to the wall of my fa
ther's office is a motto that reads,
"function in disaster, finish in
style." 1 mention this to demon
strate that my condition is con
genital. I am a chronic perfec
tionocrastinator.

It's not that I enjoy stress or
thrive on pressure. I simply can't
get started on important assign
ments until the 11th hour, or
sometimes the 12th.
My mother can't understand
why I don't sit down and crank
out papers as soon as they're as
signed. "Then you'll really be
able to relax," she assures me.
There are plenty of students
for whom this approach works
swimmingly. They seem to float
effortlessly through life, their
faces suffused with a warm glow
as they delicately strum a golden
harp. Well, there aren't really any
students like that. Everyone has
to procrastinate at some point, or
the work would never stop com
ing — there would always be the

next item on the to-do list, softly
calling "do me, do me" until it
was done. Unless that next item
happened to be a beautiful
woman, this would result in a
downright miserable existence.
The question about procrasti
nation is not whether one ever
does it, but where one draws the
line — in the sand, or some
where up on a hill where one
desperately hopes the tidal
waves of late work can't reach?
Those who draw their line in
the sand may never experience
the agony of a futile all-nighter,
but I'd like to suggest that they
also miss out on one of life's most
exhilarating sensations: the vin
dicating thrill of completing the
true last-minute masterpiece.

But even for the procrastina
tors, this thrill is often dulled by
a wet blanket of uncertainty. As I
noted before I began to digress
wildly, sleep debt and time pres
sure can lead to inaccurate self
evaluation.
For instance, if I had time to
kill right now, I would review this
column with the utmost scrutiny.
But the clock just struck 3 a.m.,
and it suddenly looks like a gem.

Will Or emus is a junior, but he hasn't
decided on a major yet. He worries that
this column won't make it into the
paper because it was due 44 minutes
ago. He worries, too, that this column
will make the paper, because it might re
veal itself as a lot of drivel in the cruel
light of day.
