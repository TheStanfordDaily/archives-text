Pop Quiz: Mix some Olympians, some
world record holders, some NCAA c ham
pions and a bunch of people who would
like to have those titles. Then add one
pool, a handful of judges, and a ton of
screaming spectators. Finally, add a gener
ous serving of prestige for the winners, and
what do you get? One of the fastest, most
exciting swim meets in recent history.
The Phillips 66 National Swimming
Championships finished up last Saturday
in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and it was a com
petition none will soon forget. In addition
to three meet records and two U.S. Open
records, competitors broke two American
records and two world records at the Hall
of Fame Aquatic Complex on the south
Florida coast.
Perhaps the most exciting race of all was
the women's 100-meter backstroke. Cali
fornia's Natalie Coughlin cruised to the
finish in 59.58 seconds, shattering the old
record of 1:00.16 while appearing to exert
no more energy than she would warming
up. The entire crowd — even Stanford
fans — were on their feet to cheer for the
first woman to go the distance in under
one minute. Coughlin later broke the
American record in the 200 backstroke,
the oldest one on the books.
17-year-old Michael Phelps added an

other world record to his resume in the
400 IM, and set two American records in
the 200 IVI and the 100 butterfly.
The Cardinal men and women had
been building up to this meet, dedicating
practice hours in the summer to the per
fection of starts, strokes, turns and, most
importantly, mental readiness. And the
hard work paid off.
Junior Tara Kirk, the two-time NCAA
champion and American record holder in
the 100 yard breaststroke, finished fifth in
the 100-meter breaststroke in 1:09.53,
only half a second behind first place. Later
in the week, Kirk took third in the 200
breaststroke in 2:28.37.
Sophomore Lacey Boutwell also had a
strong meet, taking 35th in the 50 freestyle
and 36th in the 100 free behind former
Stanford stars and Olympians Jenny
Thompson (4th) and Gabrielle Rose
(10th).
As usual, the most anticipated event for
the Stanford men was the 100 backstroke,
an event in which every finalist finished
under a bla/ing 56 seconds. To the delight
of Cardinal fans, four of the eight finalists
were Randall Bal, Peter Marshall, Jayme
Cramer and Dan Westcott. The top two
spots were nabbed by world record holders
Lenny Krayzelberg and Aaron Piersol,
with Bal and Marshall close behind with
times of 54.88 and 55.23. Cramer and
Westcott took seventh and eight in 55.60
and 55.66 respectively.
Bal also took fourth in the 100 free with
a time of 49.90, ahead of Cramer (50.98)
and Andrew Schnell (51.39). Cramer also
finished sixth in the 200 fly (1:59.75) and
seventh in the 100 fly with a time of 53.94.

Sophomore Dan Trupin took the B
final of the 200 IM with a time of 2:01.90,
as well as the C-final of the 100 fly in 54.75,
just a hair ahead of junior Scott Ransen
berg's 54.76.
The 100 breaststroke saw strong per
formances from Patrick Fowler and
Michael Bruce, who turned in times of
1:04.42 and 1:04.64.
The eyes of the swimming world will
turn next to the Pan-Pacific Champi
onships. The 52-member U.S. team in

cludes Stanford's Bal and Marshall on the
men's side, as well as sisters Tara and Dana
Kirk for the women. Stanford alumni Tom
Wilkens, Gabrielle Rose and Jenny
Thompson are also among the 22
Olympians on Team USA. The team was
chosen in Fort Lauderdale based on a com
bination of success at Nationals and world
rankings.
Pan-Pacs, a bi-annual competition, is the

top event for the Pacific Rim na
tions this summer and will run
from Aug. 24 through Aug. 29 in
Yokohama, Japan.
Team USA is preparing to
represent America well. At last
year's World Championships in
Fukuoka, Japan, Australia won
the most gold medals and was
recognized as the king of the
pool.
But the United States, is
poised to reclaim that title. The
American men are ranked high
er than the Australians in eight of
13 events, while the women are
up nine out of 13, with a tie in the
50 freestyle. The American men
also rank first in the world in 7 of
13 events, compared to Aus
tralia's three.
It'll be a close race in Japan,
hut the strong showing at Na
tionals leaves hope that Ameri
can will be able to shove Australia
"down under."
