# Small sluggers could teach big leaguers a lesson or two

### TERRY HURLBUTT EDITORIAL STAFF 
As summer winds down and the possibil
ity of the Major League Baseball strike be
comes a more immediate reality, I'm busy
watching the only baseball championship I
may see this year — the Little League
World Series.
And you know, in my humble opinion, it's
actually more fun than the "real" one fora
whole lot of reasons.
For example, there's more genuine, posi
tive emotion on the field and in the stands
than usually displayed in the much more cyn
ical world of professional baseball. From the
anxious, encouraging cheers from the travel
ing fans, to the laughter and tears that eleven
year-olds simply can't hold back, there's tio
chance of being unmoved by these games.
When a multi-millionaire contract player
drops the ball (literally or figuratively) my
life moves on fairly quickly and uneventfully.
However, when a little guy does the same, I
wince right along with his mother.
And unlike the showboat moves in the

pros, these kids play textbook baseball —
while there's something to be said for putting
one's own spin on things, there's something
much more satisfying in seeing a successful
double play. In addition, the younger players
are relying simply on their own grit, deter
mination and young muscles instead of
steroids.
These boys could also teach their older
counterparts something about good grace
and sportsmanship.
When the pitcher beans the batter in the
little leagues, the batter does not angrily
throw down his bat, (his nostrils flaring like
an angry bull and charge the mound to the
delight of both teams who can then dispose
of their pent-up 112 rustrations by pummeling
anyone in the opposite jersey who just hap
pens to be involved in the same wriggling
dog pile) but instead, calmly takes his base.
The pitcher, in turn, comes over to apologet
ically give his unintended victim a high-five.
What nice boys. So sad that it's uncom
monly kindhearted in this game.
By the way, Little League has the distinc
tion of having World Series games with girls

on the rosters. That's something the big
leagues are still working on. However, for
lack of time, I won't go there today.
And finally, it's so refreshing to see players
who truly love the game. No money in
volved, no scandals (barring of course, last
year's Bronx ordeal), n0...0h yeah, no
strikes. Because these kids want to play —
more than anything they just want to go on
the field and play the game.
Which brings me back to the very real
possibility that there might not be a World
Series this year — or even, some say, a season
next year.
I've got news for you guys: Baseball is just
a game. Yes, that's right, just a game.
And fora game, I have a really hard time
crying for anybody (either players or man
agement) who wants more than his current
six or seven figure salary.
Honestly people, let's put this in some
perspective. I realize it's a business, but it's a
business based on the public paying to see
these players play in actual games, its enter
tainment.
And last time I checked, watching a strike

was not entertaining.
So guys, don't do it. There are times when
sports rise above the distinction of mere
games. That happens whenever the world of
athletics can impart serious and courageous
lessons in determination, loyalty, hard work
and honor.
Tall orders?
Maybe, but I believe when players sign on
to receive money for playing a game, they ac
cept these responsibilities.
Those kids out there on the field this week
have their favorite baseball players. They
have heroes they emulate in the confines of
their backyards. In fact, kids all over the
country have athletic heroes in a variety of
sports and it's thanks to these kids that ath
letes enjoy their overwhelming popularity.
So gentlemen, earn it.
Because a sporting world that thinks little
of disappointing the eleven and twelve-year
olds who love it is not one that I want to sup
port.
And I think I could pretty easily learn to
love the Little League World Series in lieu of
a professional series.
