## 'Sara' doesn't serve up laughs 
### PETER KAZANJY STAFF WRITER 
It only takes 34 minutes for Elizabeth I lur
ley to get nude in "Serving Sara."
OK, not totally nude, but close: First, she
appears in skimpy white lingerie, and then she
flaunts around in a dangerously short school
girl tartan skirt, tight shirt and an absurd pink
cowboy hat.

In retrospect, it's not such a terrible thing.
It's actually quite shrewd. Director Reginald
Hudlin must have decided to capitalize on
Hurley's, urn, assets.
"Serving Sara" tries to take full advantage of
all its stars' respective talents. Matthew Perry,
as hardened New York process server Joe
Tyler, uses his impeccable comic timing occa
sionally to hilarious effect, but more often to
prop up the less-than-stellar screenplay.
Cedric the Entertainer does his comedy rou
tine that worked so well on " The Original
Kings of Comedy." And Bruce Campbell, of
"The Evil Dead 2" and "Army of Darkness"
fame, tries his best to work with the material,
despite the small role that he is given.
It's when the stars are brought together

that the movie really fails to shine. Instead of
chemistry between Hurley and Perry, we get
an awkward fizzle. Perhaps they should have
watched the Farrelly brothers' version of odd
couple pairing in "Kingpin" to see how Woody
Harrelson and Vanessa Angel did it right. In
this case we just wonder why someone as beau
tiful, wealthy and intelligent as Hurley's char
acter, Sara Moore, is actually talking to the
fumbling Perry.
And instead of putting a funny spin on the

doubtlessly fit-for-comic-evisceration world of
process serving, Hudlin just serves us up a trio
of putzes. Cedric and Perry are constrained by
jokes that don't fly.
Joe Tyler's rivalry with fellow process server
Ray (Vincent Pastore) isn't so much funny as it
is disturbing, especially considering how much
they actually physically harm each other. Over
the course of the movie, Joe gets Ray frozen,
