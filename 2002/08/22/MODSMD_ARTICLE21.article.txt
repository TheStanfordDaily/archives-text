the present together with two groups of charac
ters. The British hero of Byatt's novel is trans
formed in the movie into a closet poetry-writing
American, doing research on acclaimed poet
Randolph Henry Ash. The movie presents the fic
tional 19th-century poet as one of Britain's greats,

with several shots of huge banners featuring his
face hanging outside of the British Museum.
Roland's love for Ash's poet ry leads him to a po
sition as a research assistant at the British Muse
um. Roland is passed over fora promotion and
competes with his slick British colleague Fergus

Wolff (Toby Stephens) for the at
tention of Blackadder (Tom
Mickey), the crochety old profes
sor in charge of the collection.
While searching for marginalia
of Ash's in a book at the London
Library, Roland discovers two
love letters that suggest Ash's
marriage may not have been as
perfect as it seemed. He steals

the letters and begins the search for the mystery
author of these letters.

poetess contemporary of Ash. Fer
gus recommends he speak with
Maud Bailey, an acquaintance of his
who happens to be the expert on
LaMotte. Few actresses do ice
queen better than Gwyneth Paltrow
and she puts in a solid performance
as an academic on her way to spin
sterhood.
Roland convinces Maud that
there may indeed have been an af
fair between Ash and LaMotte and
the two pay a visit to the country es
tate where LaMotte spent most of
her life. Maud is a descendent of
Miss LaMotte and Sir George Bai
ley (Graham Crowden) gives them
a tour of the rooms in which LaM
otte lived — which have remained
uncleaned and untouched since
her death a hundred years earlier.
Maud's sudden insight leads to
the discovery of a cache of love let

ters between Ash and LaMotte. The
two academics spend the night
reading each other the epistles, with
flashbacks illustrating the action.
Unfortunately, after their dis
covery, Maud calls Fergus to tell
him about their find. Fergus decid
ed this is his chance to make a
name for himself and contacts
American professor Morton Coop
er (Trevor Eve), an arrogant Ash
aficionado with a deep pocket
book. Together Maud and Roland
must travel through England and
into France in an attempt to learn
the facts of Ash and LaMotte's af
fair before Cooper and Fergus.
Along the way, they bond over
the letters and shared mystery and
fight their growing attraction to one
another. Roland assures Maud she's
safe since he's "off women" and rela
tionships, while Maud confesses that
she and Fergus have been involved
off again on again for several years
and that she has intimacy issues.
When Roland and Maud learn
that the affair ended badly, with

the death of the lesbian LaMotte's
domestic partner and LaMotte's
flight to France, their burgeoning
romance begins to fizzle, but love
and academic integrity save, the
day as they team up with Blackad
der to foil a plot by Morton and
Fergus to rob Ash's grave.
The Victorian flashbacks are
the most interesting part of the
film, with superb British actors Je
remy Northam and Jennifer Ehle
as the poet couple. The modern
couple is sedate and inhibited com
pared to this passionate pairing.
Throughout the movie,
Laßute's filming seems frosty and
muted and although Roland's
American charm melts Maud's re
serve, their romance is not enough
to make a gratifying conclusion.
The movie ends not with the
modern couple, but with the an
swer to the mystery of Ash and
LaMotte. It is this element of mys
tery in the film that proves com
pelling and satisfying in a way that
the romance does not.
