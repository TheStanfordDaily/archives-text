Blood Work

Clint Eastwood, the rough wrangler
of 1960s Western film, has aged
nicely into the lone star everyman of
modern-day cinema.
In his latest film, "Blood Work," East
wood plays Terrell McCaleb, a veteran
FBI director who is pushed into retire
ment after a near-death injury in the line
of duty. He returns two years later to
help a young woman (Wanda de Jesus)
whose sister was murdered and pleads
for his help.
Eastwood, as both actor and director,
doesn't try to reinvent the wheel in
"Blood Work": The action and drama
are rehashed threads from the standard
made-for-television police thriller. Yet
the movie doesn't even succeed in what
it is trying to accomplish — primarily, to
follow in the footsteps of greater films
that merge action with police drama ef
fortlessly like the original "Lethal
Weapon."
Eastwood is good, but not good
enough to rise above material that is this
inherently bad.
In an early scene (too early to necessi
tate a spoiler warning), Terrell is chasing
the killer when he collapses against a wiry
fence and suffers a heart attack. East
wood, of course, recovers. "Blood Work,"
on the other hand, never manages to re
suscitate itself.

Blue Crush

It could have been about "Bay
watch" bimbos on surfboards, but
"Blue Crush" is more thoughtful
than that.
The movie was directed by John
Stockwell, whose last film "crazy/beauti
ful" starred Kirsten Dunst as a troubled
high school student who falls in love with
Jay Hernandez. Stockwell has an ability
to portray teenagers as they really are: in
secure, awkward and full of doubt; his
films are the polar opposite of anything
starring Freddie Prinze Jr.
For most of the film, Anne Marie
(Kate Bosworth) is supposed to be
preparing fora big surfing tournament
called the Pipe Masters in Oahu, Hawaii,
where the waves carry so much weight
they have been known to kill surfers. But
instead, she falls in love with a NFL quar
terback named Matt (Matthew Davis),
who conies to the island and wants her to
give him surf lessons.
"Blue Crush" succeeds because the
story remains grounded and real, even
when some of the material pushes the lim
its of plausibility. Most films for teenagers
conclude at the big high school prom, and
almost everyone appears to be a contrived
caricature. In "Blue Crush," all the char
acters are treated as smart and sane, and
they react to problems as we expect they
would in real life.

The Good Girl

In this film by director Miguel Arteta,
Jennifer Aniston stars as Justine, a
woman stuck in suburban Texas. Her
life consists of a boring retail day job and
nights with her husband Phil (John C.
Reilly), who is well-meaning but dulled
by pot and television.
Phil spends most of his time with
friend and co-worker Bubba (Tim Blake
Nelson). She is also surrounded by
cheery Christian baby boomers and bit
ter Gen-Xers, and as despondent as that
is, it is the life she's doomed to live.
Much has been made of this being
Aniston's break-out role, a role that will fi
nally get her respect as the shopworn
comedy of "Friends" winds down. It may
be that Aniston lucked into fame, but this
movie shows that she can act as well as
most other stars. She does right by this
role of a former "good girl" with layers of
needs and behavior. Each layer is simple
enough to provide us with a character we
can see pieces of ourselves in, and together
they form a complex enough character to
guide the film along.
The real strength of the movie, though,
is provided by Arteta, producer Matthew
Greenfield and writer Mike White — who
also collaborated on "Chuck and Buck." In
spite of some cliches inherent in the over
all concept, the movie works and is well
worth seeing.

XXX

A bald James Bond? Shave Pierce
Brosnan's head, and yon certainly
don't get Xander ("age, the hero
played by Vin Diesel in an update of the
geriatric Bond franchise.
To get to the X-zone in "XXX," you
need more than just less hair. You need
to be buff, bad and refreshingly funny.
We don't mean droll. No, we'll leave that
to 007. We mean one-liners that best
Arnold Schwarzenegger's, comebacks
that don't spare the rod and delivery, de
livery, delivery.
The larger movie shares the business
oriented approach, for better and for
worse. What it lacks in an implausible plot,
it makes np in pure action-flick muscle.
One wouldn't expect any less from direc
tor Rob Cohen, whose "The Fast and the
Furious" also starred Diesel, though with
less successful results.
In "XXX," not only is Diesel's perform
ance swift and edgy, but those turned in by
his co-stars are no less accomplished. y\sia
Argento plays Yelena, a female character
that comes off as stunning without sacrific
ing her intelligence. Samuel L. Jackson
does his turn as the straight shooter to
Xavier's loose-cannon behavior; he is like
M.was to Bond.
With "XXX," a lot of the payoff comes
down to the amount of excitement it tries
to generate. And it succeeds on that level.

oriented approach, for better and for

it makes np in pure action-flick muscle.
One wouldn't expect any less from direc

to generate. And it succeeds on that level.

Blood Work

Clint Eastwood, the rough wrangler
of 1960s Western film, has aged
nicely into the lone star everyman of
modern-day cinema.
In his latest film, "Blood Work," East
wood plays Terrell McCaleb, a veteran
FBI director who is pushed into retire
ment after a near-death injury in the line
of duty. He returns two years later to
help a young woman (Wanda de Jesus)
whose sister was murdered and pleads
for his help.
Eastwood, as both actor and director,
doesn't try to reinvent the wheel in
"Blood Work": The action and drama
are rehashed threads from the standard
made-for-television police thriller. Yet
the movie doesn't even succeed in what
it is trying to accomplish — primarily, to
follow in the footsteps of greater films
that merge action with police drama ef
fortlessly like the original "Lethal
Weapon."
Eastwood is good, but not good
enough to rise above material that is this
inherently bad.
In an early scene (too early to necessi
tate a spoiler warning), Terrell is chasing
the killer when he collapses against a wiry
fence and suffers a heart attack. East
wood, of course, recovers. "Blood Work,"
on the other hand, never manages to re
suscitate itself.

Blue Crush

It could have been about "Bay
watch" bimbos on surfboards, but
"Blue Crush" is more thoughtful
than that.
The movie was directed by John
Stockwell, whose last film "crazy/beauti
ful" starred Kirsten Dunst as a troubled
high school student who falls in love with
Jay Hernandez. Stockwell has an ability
to portray teenagers as they really are: in
secure, awkward and full of doubt; his
films are the polar opposite of anything
starring Freddie Prinze Jr.
For most of the film, Anne Marie
(Kate Bosworth) is supposed to be
preparing fora big surfing tournament
called the Pipe Masters in Oahu, Hawaii,
where the waves carry so much weight
they have been known to kill surfers. But
instead, she falls in love with a NFL quar
terback named Matt (Matthew Davis),
who conies to the island and wants her to
give him surf lessons.
"Blue Crush" succeeds because the
story remains grounded and real, even
when some of the material pushes the lim
its of plausibility. Most films for teenagers
conclude at the big high school prom, and
almost everyone appears to be a contrived
caricature. In "Blue Crush," all the char
acters are treated as smart and sane, and
they react to problems as we expect they
would in real life.

The Good Girl

In this film by director Miguel Arteta,
Jennifer Aniston stars as Justine, a
woman stuck in suburban Texas. Her
life consists of a boring retail day job and
nights with her husband Phil (John C.
Reilly), who is well-meaning but dulled
by pot and television.
Phil spends most of his time with
friend and co-worker Bubba (Tim Blake
Nelson). She is also surrounded by
cheery Christian baby boomers and bit
ter Gen-Xers, and as despondent as that
is, it is the life she's doomed to live.
Much has been made of this being
Aniston's break-out role, a role that will fi
nally get her respect as the shopworn
comedy of "Friends" winds down. It may
be that Aniston lucked into fame, but this
movie shows that she can act as well as
most other stars. She does right by this
role of a former "good girl" with layers of
needs and behavior. Each layer is simple
enough to provide us with a character we
can see pieces of ourselves in, and together
they form a complex enough character to
guide the film along.
The real strength of the movie, though,
is provided by Arteta, producer Matthew
Greenfield and writer Mike White — who
also collaborated on "Chuck and Buck." In
spite of some cliches inherent in the over
all concept, the movie works and is well
worth seeing.

XXX

A bald James Bond? Shave Pierce
Brosnan's head, and yon certainly
don't get Xander ("age, the hero
played by Vin Diesel in an update of the
geriatric Bond franchise.
To get to the X-zone in "XXX," you
need more than just less hair. You need
to be buff, bad and refreshingly funny.
We don't mean droll. No, we'll leave that
to 007. We mean one-liners that best
Arnold Schwarzenegger's, comebacks
that don't spare the rod and delivery, de
livery, delivery.
The larger movie shares the business
oriented approach, for better and for
worse. What it lacks in an implausible plot,
it makes np in pure action-flick muscle.
One wouldn't expect any less from direc
tor Rob Cohen, whose "The Fast and the
Furious" also starred Diesel, though with
