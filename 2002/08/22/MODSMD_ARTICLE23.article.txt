# BIG BROTHERS 3 Watch
## 
### 
We cooed with delight as the past week in the
"Big Brother 3" household brought some of the
best episodes yet.
Here's what happened:
THURSDAY, AUGUST 15. The "live" eviction
proved to be more momentous than usual because,
in a twist that we have come to accept, an old evict
ed houseguest returned to the house. First,

though, there was the eviction.
The nominees were Josh, the
loud-mouthed waiter from Long
Island, N.Y., and Roddy, the pen
sive writer from Morris Town, N.J.
Both were nominated for eviction
by Chiara, who is having trouble
seeing the real threats in the
house. In fact, one might say she is
cruising along in the game as reck-

lessly as a drunken driver. (Indeed, we are punny
with our analogies: The real estate appraiser was
pulled over fora I)U I just weeks before she entered
the house.)
But, alas, we digress. It was time for — as host
Julie Chen calls it"the —"the moment of truth." By a
landslide 5-0 tally, Josh was evicted from the house
(as we predicted).
Later, it was time for the "real" moment of truth
when the (IBS revealed how one of the four evict
ed houseguests would return to the game. First, the
field needed to be narrowed down by two. Chen
gave each evictees a hypothetical: If they were to re
turn to the house and win the $500,000 prize, how
much of it would they be willing to give back?
Amy, Eric and Tonya all said $250,000. Lori, who
is so frugal she must shop at MacFrugals, said that
she'd only give back $50,000. She was eliminated.
Since there was a three-way tie, Chen asked a tie
breaker question. Eric and Amy emerged victori
ous. Tonya and her implants were sent home.
Finally, in the last leg of-the competition, the
houseguests were sequestered in different rooms
and Chen asked them to vote "live" on who they
wanted to return. Everybody expect for Roddy and
Chiara voted for Amy. That meant that the cheese
loving real estate appraiser from Memphis, Tenn.
walked back into the house and changed the rules
of the game forever.

The episode ended with the Head of House
hold competition. All of the houseguests (minus
Chiara, last week's winner) were asked to strip
down to their bathing suits (no surprise there) and
get into a large bathtub that had been assembled in
the backyard. Then Chiara was asked to dump
buckets of malicious sea creatures — squid and
electric eels, for instance — into the tub. The last
one left would win.
FRIDAY, AUGUST 16. Because football would
pre-empt Saturday's normal show (dratsl), CBS

scheduled a "special" Friday air
ing. Unfortunately, that meant the
network had less than a day to
repackage clips for the next airing.
And repackage they did.
The episode contained oddly
edited flashbacks that went back to
the early weeks. Rerun reality TV?
Excuse us, while we yawn.
But it all boiled down, in the

end, to the Head of Household competition. As the
camera zoomed in on the tub, we saw carcasses of
dead electric eels and squids float to the top of the
water. (Cruelty to animals is a small price to pay for
quality entertainment.) Two hours later, everyone
had left the tub except Amy, the winner. Now that's
a twist on a twist on a twist that we didn't expect.
WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 21. The special two
hour episode featured a special guest appearance
from Sheryl Crow. All she wanted to do was have
some fun with the houseguests.
Then it was time for Amy to make the toughest
decision of her life. She had to choose which two
houseguests to nominate for eviction. Her choices?
Roddy and Eric, the last remaining couple in the
house.
The episode ended with the Veto Challenge,
which was a slip 'n' slide competition. You guessed
it: The houseguest who slipped the farthest would
win the Veto necklace. Lisa, who said she loved
lube, lathered down as did Marcellas, but neither
could get as far as Gerry — who showed that a big
man can still slip and slide with the best of'em.
He chose, however, not to use the veto and the
nominations stood as they were.
OUR PREDICTION: It looks like Roddy, who
cut his own girlfriend loose just to ensure that he
would continue playing the game, has managed to
convince the houseguests to keep him one more
week. So we're guessing that Chiara will get the
boot. Her motto? "Everything happens fora rea
son." Well, after tonight she'll be gone — and the
reason will be that no one likes a backstabbing
drunken driver.
