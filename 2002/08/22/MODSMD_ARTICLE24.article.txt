Writer/director Richard Kelly's debut feature "Donnie Darko"
(2001) begins as the titular teenage hero (Jake Gyllenhaal) awakens on
the side of a mountain road, having apparently biked there in his sleep.
That night, an engine from an unidentified plane falls on Donnie's
room. He barely escapes death only because he is lured outside by vi
sions of a giant bunny named Frank, who tells Donnie that the world
will end in less than

a month.
Huh?
The plot contin
ues to twist in un
predictable ways
for the following
two hours, taking
the audience on a
haunting journey
that borrows
equally from J. D.
Salinger and
Stephen I lawking.
Kelly's genuinely
uncatego rizable
film might leave
the viewer a little
confused about
what's actually
going on — even
after the credits
roll — but that only
enhances its emo
tional power.
Kelly's script,
grounding Don-

nie's far-out visions with a barbed yet affectionate portrait of late
' Bos suburban life, is rich in both emotion and ideas about alien
ation, faith and predestination. At times, "Donnie Darko" feels
like a rapidly collapsing nightmare, bin it always has a touch of
reality and humanity, a touch alternately warmer and starker
than the flights of fancy.
Mary McDonnell, Holmes Osborne and Gyllenhaal's real-life
sibling Maggie portray the rest of the Darko family with a rare au
thenticity. In the end, though, the film rests on Gyllenhaal's won
derfully complex performance as Donnie: His glowering stare even
darkens scenes drenched in sunlight, yet a hint of childlike inno
cence keeps the audience sympathetic as his apparent insanity and
destruct iveness grow.
On the DVD, Kelly and Gyllenhaal deliver a serviceable audio
commentary, particularly useful for those who (like me) were left a
little puzzled by the plot's convolutions. Generally, deleted scenes
turn out to be boring (hence their deletion), but here they prove to
be the highlights of the disc.
