# 'Pluto' never ventures beyond spacey antics

existing. It's three beers short of a
six pack and several crayons short of
a box, and that's a shame.
There are some things about the
movie that could have been very
funny and inventive — perhaps
enough tojustify plopping down $5
to see it at a matinee. But instead, all
we get are some nice art direction.
Here's the deal: In the year
2087, Eddie Murphy is Pluto
Nash, a nightclub owner on the
moon who finds himself on the
run after a Donald Trump-ish
casino mogul offers to buy his
club and Nash refuses. However,
Nash isn't the kind of cool cat who
just tucks tail and runs. Instead,
he goes on a renegade road trip to
Moon City with a small group of
characters: an outdated robot
sidekick (Randy Quaid), a wait
ress from his club (Rosario Daw
son) and a sleazy smuggler who
idolizes him (Luis Guzman)
enough to win back his club.

Along the way, the group also
gets a little help from Nash's mom
(Pam Grier) and a cheesy Vegas
style singer (Jay Mohr).
That's about it, and you can
imagine where this set up goes.
Nash and the waitress find true
love. The robot learns how to be
just a little more human. And in the
end, Nash gets his club back and
everything is happy again. Done
deal? Give me a break. At no point
does "Pluto Nash" break away from

the most
cliche of the
cliche, and
at no point
do the char
acters do
anything
that was un
expected
within the

first five minutes of the film.
It would be easy to blame this on
Murphy — who, with his last film
"Show Time," may now be swing
ing one of" the worst batting aver
ages in Hollywood. But to his cred
it, this isn't really his fault. He al
most has some dignity as he goes
through the motions here, looking
as if he's doing the film because he
needs to pay the bills, and he almost
inspires sympathy. But the same
credit can't be given to the rest of
the cast. Quaid can't even look ro
botic when that's all he needs to do,
and Dawson has an awful habit of
smiling when she shouldn't be,
laughing at the wrong times and in
general doing everything wrong.
It's as if she took acting lessons from
Madonna.
There is not a single laugh in
"The Adventures of Pluto Nash."
In the end, it's a soulless, corporate,
trash bag cinema, lacking any real
emotion and any real surprises.
