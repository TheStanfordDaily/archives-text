# Sleater-K 'Beat' is number one
## 
### ANTHONY HA STAFF WRITER 
On "Step Aside," the strongest track off
Sleater-Kinney's brilliant new album "One Beat,"
vocalist Corin Tucker demands, "Why don't you
shake a tail for peace and love?" The line is a lit
tle silly, but as sung by the formidably powerful
(and loud) Tucker, it's also profound, defiant and
intensely cathartic. And it encapsulates the punk
trio's mission: to set us free through music.
Sleater-Kinney's songs have always been un
usually concerned with rock's promise and histo
ry; from"I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone" ("Call

the Doctor," 1996) and
"Words + Guitar"
("Dig Me Out," 1997)
through "You're No
Rock 'n' Roll Fun" ("All
Hands on the Bad
One," 2000), the trio's
best work has often
been songs about
songs. On "One Beat,"
Tucker (vocals, gui
tar), Carrie Brown
stein (vocals, guitar)
and Janet Weiss
(drums, vocals) con
nect music and libera
tion more explicitly
than ever. It's rock that
openly recognizes it
self as a gesture of po
litical and personal re-

bellion, where the guitars and drums are every
bit as defiant and confident as the lyrics.
To put it simply: "One Beat" rocks in every
way imaginable.
It also finds the band's members at their most
musically adventurous and sophisticated, tra
versing enormous swaths of sonic territory. They
throw bubble-gum pop, arena rock, New Wave
and raw punk into the mix, often on the same
song. Of course, the band's increased playfulness
and emotional range also mean that there's noth
ing here as blow-to-the-guts angry as its early
work, but that's the cost of growth. "One Beat"
may not say "fuck you!" quite as loudly as "Call
the Doctor," but it says it more creatively and per
suasively.
The album gets off to a strong start with the
title track, on which a steady, pounding beat ac
companies enigmatic lyrics ("Take me to the
source of chaos, let me be the butterfly, oh my /
Imperfect symmetry, underlying poetry and
rhyme") in a haunting portrait of the need for
change, and of music as an engine of progress
and transcendence.

The band soon returns to Earth with "Par
Away," the first track to acknowledge the shadow
of Sept. 11 ("One Beat'"s elliptical references to
"bloody arms and oil fields" aside), a shadow that
darkens the rest of the album. The song's crash
ing guitars and frantic drumming feel like the
end of the world, while Tucker and Brownstein's
words (intertwining more perfectly than ever) re
capture that day's confusion, terror and sadness
with near-perfect accuracy. It's a wail of pure de
spair and anger when they sing, "Why can't I get
along with you?".
"Step Aside" and "Combat Rock" are critiques
of America's response to the attacks and rallying

cries for resistance.
"Combat Rock," the more
openly political of the
two, comes off as a bit ob
vious, but it's redeemed
by a cheeky sense of
humor that manifests in
both the lyrics ("Red
white blue hot pants:
doing it for Uncle Sam!")
and the mockingly faux
patriotic music. "Step
Aside" is even better, uti
lizing soaring guitars, a
flourish of trumpets and
above all the fully un
leashed fury of Tucker's
voice to urge listeners,
"It's not the time to just
give in, / Speak up, one
time, to the beat!" .

The album also has a few moments of unfet
tered playfulness and joy, such as "Oh!" on which
Brownstein coos, "The way I feel when you call
my name, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh!/Makes me go
crazy to sane, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh!," and "Prissti
na," which features Tucker's teasing chorus, "You
want to tempt her with your dirty rock and roll!"
"One Beat" closes with "Sympathy," a moving
track that ranks with "Step Aside" as the record's
strongest. It begins as a mother's prayer for the
life of her child, but soon broadens and trans
forms into something even darker, an unflinch
ing look at faith and guilt: "When the moment
strikes / It takes you by surprise and / Leaves you
naked in the face of death and life." Yet the final
note is of hope, love and, yes, sympathy.
Music critic Sarah Vowell observed that while
"Call the Doctor" was an album that cut the lis
tener in half, "Dig Me Out" put you back to
gether. "Sympathy" manages to do both. The
song, as well as every other track on "One Beat,"
serves as a wonderful demonstration of why
we're tempted by dirty rock 'n' roll, and why we
still need it.
