# Ash's 'Free All Angels' has heavenly melody

### KAREEM GHANEM STAFF WRITER 
Rock 'n' roll bands deserve their own zoological classification. Of
course, they aren't animals per se (Motley Crue and Kiss excepted).
However, most musicians and musical groups exhibit a pronounced
cycle of life and death characterized by birth, a peak of success or cre
ativity (but rarely both) and an eventual, often drug-and-greed fu
eled, descent into obscurity. The lucky ones are able to defy expecta
tions and avoid everything that goes along with that last part.
By all estimations, Irish power-pop quartet Ash fits into that second
category. Though I can't remember the first time I ever heard the
band, I know that it was shortly after the release of the group's second
album, the cryptically-titled "1977." (It refers to the year most of the
band's members were born, "Star Wars" was released and punk ex
ploded.) At that time, bandmates Tim Wheeler, Mark Hamilton and
Rick McMurray were about 19 years old and experiencing the great
est successes of their lives.
What followed was a well-documented series of struggles with
drugs, alcohol and general destructiveness. In 1997, Ash added gui
tarist Charlotte Hatherley and came back with the excellent "Nu
clear Sounds," which critics hailed as a more "mature" album. This
is the same thing they're saying about Ash's newest record, "Free All
Angels," and while it's true, it is also essentially a statement of the ob
vious.
Certainly, the band might never have recovered from its self-in
flicted wounds. After all, the track record for other young bands isn't
exactly promising. Silverchair, anyone? But from the beginning, Ash
showed itself to be more gifted than what its record label took it for.
That is, they were more than just a highly-marketable, teenaged
Green Day clone from Britain. Now, in their mid-20s each, the mem
bers are strengthening their case.

"Free All An
gels" didn't imme
diately appeal to
me as much as
"1977" or "Nu-
Clear Sounds,"
both of which
deepened my af
fection for the
band. For one
thing, it's not near
ly as dark as either
album, at least on
the surface. The
Black Sabbath-like
sludge of earlier
tracks like "Dark
side Lightside"
and "Death Trip
21" is totally gone.
On this record, the
band's optimism is

laid bare. However, there are also sadder sentiments here that will be
new to longtime fans: fear, indignation and regret.
"Walking Barefoot" kicks things off with Beach Boys-worthy lyrics
like: "Yeah we've been walking barefoot all summer / It'll be sad my
friend / To see it come to an end." "Pacific Palisades," whose title
speaks for itself, specifically mentions Brian Wilson in the context of
longing for summer love, ll might even lead you to believe this band
is from Southern California, not Northern Ireland. The third track,
"Burn Baby Burn," a current UK favorite, matches desperate, suffer
ing lyrics to an incessant, punk-fuzz soundtrack.
Ash also steps away from Hatherley and Wheeler's punkish, proto
metal guitar dynamic to experiment with string arrangements and
guitar loops. "Candy" (not the throwaway Mandy Moore tune) pairs
Wheeler's loneliness with a beautiful orchestra layered over ambient
guitar plucking reminiscent of Dr. Dre's "Chronic 2001 "album. "Sub
mission" is a lewd overture to lust that suggests the Sex Pistols song of
the same name.
"Free All Angels" is definitely a more mature album for Ash, but
that's somewhat of a shallow statement; the group deserves more than
that. When Wheeler demands the world's attention on the frantic
closer "World Domination," everyone should listen. After all, animals
aren't supposed to speak like that and certainly not this loud.
