# 'Simone' can't create plot worth watching

There's absolutely nothing new
about "Simone." It doesn't show us
anything we didn't already know
and haven't seen a million times
before.

Whatever poignancy that earlier
film achieved under the sure, sub
tle hand of director Peter Weir has
been cast aside in favor of heavy
handed satire. And while Niccol's
film is extremely funny at times,
with images and asides that reward
you for paying attention, more
often it's loud, repetitive and over
bearing.
Pacino is in full wild-haired
rant as Viktor Taransky, a direc
tor already in desperate need of a
hit when the prima donna star of

his latest movie, "Sunrise, Sun
set" (Winona Ryder in a cameo),
walks off the set. Viktor must find
a way to salvage the picture with
out her.
Not a single actress will take
the part (which makes no sense,
but whatever). Then a crazed
computer genius (Elias Koteas),
who happens to be dying, gives
Viktor a program called Simula-

tion One,
which allows
him to create
his own star
let and digi
tally insert
her in the
film.
And so
Simone is

born. The press notes refer to
"Simone as Herself," as if she
were composed solely of pixels,
but she looks an awful lot like a
Canadian model named Rachel
Roberts.
She not only fools everyone —
including Viktor's ex-wife, Elaine
(Catherine Keener), and their
teenage daughter, Lainey (Evan
Rachel Wood from "Once and
Again") — she becomes an
overnight success.
Viktor gets greedy — after all,
Simone has rejuvenated his

career — and so he puts her in an
other movie, "Eternity Forever."
Then come the endless magazine
covers and television interviews,
the pop album and concert tour, Si
mone the cologne, the humanitar
ian work. (All this sounds familiar
. . . are we sure J.Lo's really a
human being?)
Viktor's methods for hiding the
fact that Simone is a fake, while
maintaining her übiquity, are the

chief source of laughs. She's ex
tremely shy, he explains. She's
fiercely devoted to her craft, which
includes not being in the same
room as her co-stars. Or as she puts
it,"I just find I relate better to peo
ple when they're not actually
there."
It's as funny as it sounds, until
Niccol beats the joke to death.
Pruitt Taylor Vince and Jason
Schwart/.man do breathe some life

back into the script as a pair of
tabloid reporters who don't believe
everything they see.
Keener merely plays the same
cold corporate executive she's
played over the past few years,
from "Being John Malkovich" to
"Death to Smoochy" to "Full
Frontal" — yet another in the
seemingly endless series of
movies in which Hollywood
ridicules itself.
