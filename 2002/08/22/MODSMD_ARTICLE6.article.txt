## Proposal by Stanford may widen Sand Hill 
### JIMMY WU STAFF WRITER 
After a long clay of work or fun away from
campus, imagine driving back by way of In
terstate 280, getting off at the Sand Hill Road
exit, only to be hindered by the all-too-famil
iar traffic jam found at the intersection of
Sand Hill Road and Santa Cruz Avenue.
In September, if three of Menlo Park's five
City Council members approve of a proposal
that would renovate Sand Hill Road, such a
problem would become a thing of the past.
This proposal, an accord made between
the city of Menlo Park and Stanford Univer
sity, marks a potential end to many decades
of discord over what should be done to t he
1,400-foot-strip of Sand Hill Road between
Santa Cruz Avenue and San Francisquito
Creek.
On Monday of last week, Steve Schmidt,
mayor of Menlo Park, and Larry Horton,
Stanford's director of government and com

munity relations, made public a proposal
that not only would widen this portion of the
road from two lanes to four, but would also
help open up traffic at two nearby intersec
tions.
The intersection of Sand Hill Road and
Santa Cruz Avenue will be redone in a way
that will allow cars heading in opposite direc
tions to make left turns simultaneously.
Also part of the intersection plan are the
creation of individual wheelchair ramps at
each corner for each crosswalk, a 215-foot
long by four-foot wide bike lane between the
through and right-turn traffic lanes on the
southbound approach of Santa Cruz Avenue
to Sand I lill Road and a pedestrian trail.
Changes will also be made to the Alpine
Road/Junipero Serra Boulevard intersection.
Horton called the proposal "historic" and
"a remarkable achievement" while Schmidt
declared it a "significant step" of a long
process. Stanford President John Hennessy
has been aware of the negotiations and fully

supports the agreement.
As part of the proposal, Stanford will cover
all construction costs. According to Morton,
Stanford will need to provide around $12
million in order to fund the entire project.
The University will also be responsible for ob
taining necessary approvals and permits for
the project.
If the Council members approve the pro
posal, construction could begin as soon as
2004, and it could be complete in 2006.
Contention over what should be done
with the road has been a longtime political
issue. According to Horton, Menlo Park has
been opposed to an expansion of Sand Hill in
fear of an increased traffic load.
Also of concern has been the possibility of
construction cost overruns. Horton believes
that they were able to come to an agreement
only after Stanford promised that there
would be no fiscal risk whatsoever to the city
of Menlo Park. If any cost overruns were to
appear, Stanford will pay for them.

"We've guaranteed to deliver the com
pleted project at no cost to Menlo Park,"
Morton said. "By managing the project our
selves, we believe that everything will be on
schedule."
Schmidt, who is stepping down as mayor
in December, has long been a critic of widen
ing the road, but with residents complaining
about the unbearable traffic problem, he now
believes it is time to take action.
"I think it's just a matter of accepting real
ity," he told the Palo Alto Daily News. "Times
have changed."
The signs of the proposal being approved
are very good as three of the five City Coun
cil members, including Schmidt, Nicholas
Jellins and Chuck Kinney, have said that they
are inclined to support the construction plan.
Council member Mary Jo Borak is happy
with the concessions that Stanford has made,
but she is still concerned about whether the
widening would increase the num
ber of cars on Sand Hill Road. The
fifth Council member, Paul Collac
chi, has been known as a critic of
Stanford's plans.
If construction ensues, land
from the Stanford University Golf
Course will also be needed. This
causes no concern to course man
ager and head pro Don Cheleme
dos, who feels the project will actu
ally improve the course.
Since 1997, Sand Hill Road has
been the center of much political
controversy. In that year, Palo Alto
approved of Stanford's plans to
build an apartment complex, senior
housing and an extension of Stan
ford Shopping Center near Sand
Hill Road. Also part of that approval
was the approval to extend Sand
Hill Road to El Camino Real.
As part of the project's traffic
mitigation, Stanford offered to pay
Menlo Park's and San Mateo
County's costs to widen part of the
road and modify two nearby inter
sections.
However, Menlo Park was un
happy with the proposal and in
1998, it unsuccessfully contested
the project's environmental impact
report.
Now, recent amendments to this
original proposal have led to the
possibility of finally putting this po
litical issue to rest.
Besides gaining approval from
the City Council, the university's
Board of Trustees and the San
Mateo County's Board of Supervi
sors also have to sign off. Horton
does not foresee any problems in
gaining the support of the board
and San Mateo County.
