The year is 1891 and David
Starr Jordan has just been hand
picked by Leland Stanford to be
the first president of Stanford Uni
versity. On the first of October
Stanford will open its gates to its
first college class. In the meantime,
Jordan must ensure that the school
will have students. So during the
summer he travels throughout the
state of California, likely on horse
back, to administer the entrance
examinations for Stanford Univer
sity in person. Some students fail;
others pass. Some he designates as
"specials," granting them admis
sion on the condition that they
come up to speed in certain subject
areas.
Tucked away on the second
floor of Green Library's Bing
Wing, in the Department of Spe
cial Collections and University
Archives, are Stanford University
entrance examinations dating back
to the 1890s. Each exam is roughly
20 pages in length, and demands a
working knowledge of botany, zo
ology and free-hand drawing,
among other subject areas.
These documents have recently
received attention from a group of
students participating in Summer
Research College. The students
were interested in the items con
tained in a time capsule planted by
university co-founder Jane Stan
ford in 1898 and unearthed this
past April by President John Hen
nessy. Contained in the time cap
sule, alongside a copy of the Holy

Bible and a crucifix, were several
entrance exams from the 1890s.
The examination from 1892 asks
for translations from Spanish,
French, German, Latin and Ancient
Greek. Under a section entitled
"Physiology," students are asked to
list the various digestive fluids and
describe their respective functions
and secretion mechanisms. In a sec
tion on drawing, students are asked
to "make a light and shade perspec
tive drawing .. . of a hexagonal
prism, with axis at an inclination to
the horizontal and also to the pic
ture plane, and with its highest end
farthest from the eye."
Chaddus Bruce, a senior major
ing in Economics, said he thought
the early exams represented a dif
ferent take on education.
"There are more components of
rote learning. It touches on a lot of
things. It would be a lot harder to
prepare for this test. If you had a
Kaplan back then, I don't know
how it would prepare you," he ob
served.
Margaret Kimball, the universi
ty archivist for Stan ford U ni versity,
said Jane Stanford would initially
be surprised at how little of the
exam Stanford students today
would be able to complete.
"She would be a little taken
aback but once she started talking
to students she would understand
that there's been a whole evolution
of education. These artifacts are
important for showing just how
transmission of knowledge takes
place, and for understanding what
sorts of things were important to

know at that time."
On the other hand, Kimball
said, today's students know a lot
more about technology and how to
get around in the world of infor
mation.
"My suspicion is that if the stu
dents turned around and showed
her what they knew in those areas,
she would be very impressed"
Kimball said.
Much has changed in the last
100 years in terms of university ad
missions procedures. Today stu
dents take standardized tests at the
end of high school, which they sub
mit together with a high school
transcript for review by an admis
sions committee. In the 1890s,
Kimball said, "the only way fora
student to prove his or her qualifi
cations was to show up and take the
exam." ,
Students came from California,
Oregon and the Mid-West. They
gathered in Palo Alto for the ad
ministration of the exam. Some
students had to travel a long way.
Herbert Hoover, former presi
dent of the United States, entered
the university in 1891 and was an
alum of the "pioneer class," the
first four-year class to graduate
from Stanford. He came from a
rural area of Oregon.
Kimball said that "there is still
some controversy over whether he
passed all areas of the entrance ex
amination." Ray Lyman Wilbur,
who later became president of
Stanford and serve in Hoover's
cabinet, came to Palo Alto from
Redlands in Southern California.

Rather than travel up the coast by
horseback, he arrived by boat.
"It was a new and pretty signifi
cant experiment that people per
ceived, and it didn't have the ca
chet or cost of places like Harvard
and Yale," Kimball said. "There
wasn't as much of a difference be
tween public and private universi
ties as we think of it today. The cost
of Berkeley was higher than Stan
lord. Stanford was open to pretty
much anybody, whereas Berkeley
was for people who lived in Cali
fornia."
Ellen Woods, senior associate
vice provost for undergraduate ed
ucation, said she was surprised at
how similar the 1892 exam was to
standardized tests for college ad
missions that students take today.
"Frankly, it amazes me how
much the same it is, rather than
how different," she remarked. "If
you looked at a SAT II preparation
book, how different would it look?
The field of knowledge has shifted
â€” in a 100 years there have been
discoveries. Einstein discovered
relativity. Functionally it is similar,
but the content is very different."
She compared the section of the
1892 exam entitled "Free-hand
Drawing" to the University of Cali
fornia's Practical Arts requirement.
"The drawing thing is a place
holder for what has been expand
ed in the year 2000 to include
other arts. I don't think it's differ
ent, it's just more limited."
However, Kimball suggested
that the section should not neces
sarily be seen from the artistic

point of view. She said it points to
the importance of being able to
represent things before the clay
and age of computers. Drawing
was used in representing architec
tural plans, mechanical models
and differences between animal
species.
The early entrance exams re
flect what high school preparation
looked like in the 1890s. While
studies in Ancient Greek and Latin
were standard, studies in modern
foreign languages were just being
introduced into the curriculum at
the time.
"It's revealing in so far as it's a
starting point fora college curricu
lum," Woods said.
Less than half of those eligible
attended high school in the United
States in the 1890s. Whether or not
a student attended high school, ac
cording to Woods, depended to a
large extent on local customs and
on state traditions.
"Some states had a strong tradi
tion of public high school. Califor
nia was one of them," she said.
While Stanford's entrance ex
aminations were particular to the
University, they were likely based
on the examinations for similar
private institutions such as Har
vard and Yale. Asked whether she
thought the early exams were
more difficult than today's stan
dardized college admissions
exams, Woods said, "1 don't think
the material is necessarily more de
manding, but the breadth is."
