# Symposium features undergraduates
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD EDITORIAL STAFF 
A new program to encourage
undergraduates to present their
research is nearing its final plan
ning stages. Applications are now
being accepted for Stanford Uni
versity's first Symposium of Un
dergraduate Research in Progress.
Sponsored primarily by Under
graduate Research Programs, with
secondary sponsorship by the
Stanford Alumni Association, the
symposium will take place during
Homecoming Weekend on
Thursday, Oct. 17.
The Symposium is looking for
individuals or groups of under
graduates to exhibit research and
creative projects to the entire com
munity through oral presentations
and poster displays in the Frances
C. Arrillaga Alumni Center. The
emphasis will be on work that is re
cently completed or in progress
and applications will be accepted
through Oct. 3.
SURP is meant to inspire un
dergraduates who may not have
done research in the past as well as
those who have already completed
research projects.
"The Symposium is designed in
part to be a way for undergradu
ates who have not yet become in
volved in research to gain an idea
of what the possibilities are —
both in terms of resources to sup
port research and the wide, wide
range of projects and topics that
undergraduates at Stanford work
on," said Susie Brubaker-Cole, di
rector of Undergraduate Research
Programs.
The success of other programs
encouraged URP to sponsor this

fall's event.
" The Undergraduate Research
Programs staff had been talking
about sponsoring such an event
for about two years, and, with the
growth and success of the Summer
Research College, we decided that
fall 2002 would be the right time to
implement the plan," said Brubak
er-Cole.
The SAA estimates that there
will be about 1,000 alumni on cam
pus on Oct. 17, and URP has in
cluded information about the
Symposium in all of the Reunion
Weekend alumni outreach materi
als. Brubaker-Cole believes that
holding the symposium on the
first day of Homecoming Week
end will be a valuable occasion for
students to network with alumni in
their areas of interest.
"Having alumni attend the
Symposium as audience members
should provide a wonderful op
portunity for former Stanford stu
dents to reconnect with what's
going on in contemporary under
graduate life, as well as a terrific
chance for current Stanford stu
dents to talk with alumni about
their educational and career paths
after graduation," she said.
There will also be prizes award
ed to distinguished presenters.
"There will be awards for the
most outstanding poster displays
in each of the major disciplines:
humanities, natural sciences/engi
neering/social sciences/creative
arts. Additionally, there will be
awards for the most outstanding
oral presentations in the concur
rent sessions from 4:00 p.m. to
6:00 p.m.," explained Brubaker-
Cole.
Although this is SURP's first

year, many universities across the
country already host undergradu
ate research conferences. Mem
bers of URP's staff visited Univer
sity of Washington last spring to
see how they set up their under
graduate research fair. However,
URP wants to adapt this sympo
sium to the University.
"We're both borrowing ideas
from what we've seen at other
schools and creating some aspects
on our own based on what we
know about the undergraduate re
search culture at Stanford," said
Brubaker-Cole.
While there is no set limit on the
number of presenters, URP ex
pects to have time for 20 total oral
presentations and space for about
100 poster displays during the
SURP.
Several students have already
expressed an interest in participat
ing in the event.
David Hsieh, a senior double
majoring in Physics and Mathe
matics, is thinking about present
ing a poster on laser cooling tech
niques and atomic physics. He has
never attended a symposium and
sees the conference as a good
learning experience.
"I am thinking of participating
in the SURP because it seems like a
good opportunity to present and
learn about undergraduate re
search that is taking place
throughout campus. As a re
searcher, the chance to explain
your work to others also helps con
solidate your thoughts," Hsieh
said.
Terri Mosqueda, a senior ma
joring in Political Science, plans to
present a poster on the increasing
propensity of Latinas to get elected

to the California State Legislature,
the topic of her honors thesis.
"I'm looking at term limits, re
districting and changing demo
graphics, and trying to analyze
how these variables might have al
lowed for more Latinas to run for
and subsequently be elected to of
fice," Mosqueda said.
Senior Electrical Engineering
major Greg Wientjes hopes to give
an oral presentation accompanied
by a PowerPoint slideshow on his
project, the"The Two Hop Echo
Experiment." His research is
based on a trip to Alaska during
which Wientjes and a group of
graduate students working with
Electrical Engineering Professor
Umran I nan used high frequency
antennas to heat the ionosphere
and study properties of electro
magnetic signal propagation.
Students find that their faculty
mentors play a large part in their
research.
"Professor [Luis] Fraga is an in
credible advisor and mentor — his
ability to both challenge and en
courage me has allowed me to feel
comfortable in pursuing what
could have been a very daunting
endeavor," said Mosqueda.
"Honestly, working one-on-one
with Stanford professors doing
cutting edge research in their field
is really inspirational," concluded
Wientjes.
There will be workshops dur
ing the fall to help students design
posters and prepare oral presenta
tions the SURP. More information
about these events as well as details
about the application process can
