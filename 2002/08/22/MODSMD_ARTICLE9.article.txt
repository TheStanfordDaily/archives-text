â€”Indiana University was
crowned the nation's No. 1
"party school" Monday in an
annual Princeton Review sur
vey that school leaders and
medical experts derided as irre
sponsible and unscientific.
Following IU in the rankings
were Clemson University, the
University of Alabama-
Tuscaloosa, Pennsylvania State
University and the University of
Florida.
IU officials questioned the
No. 1 ranking. The school,
which didn't appear on the list
last year, has toughened its
stance on student drinking since
the 1998 alcohol-related death
of a student.
In the past year, five IU fra
ternities have been suspended
or expelled for violations of alco
hol policies, said Bill Stephan,
the university's vice president
for public affairs.
"I think there are some seri
ous questions about the method
ology of the study and it really
calls into question the credibility
of the ranking," Stephan said.
IU freshman Anya Simonova
said her school may be perceived
as a party school, but noted that
"it's getting quieter because
they're cracking down more."
Junior Erin Pritchard agreed.
"I'd be surprised to hear we're
number one," she said. "Even
though most people party three
or four times a week, this past year
they've been a lot more strict."
The survey, conducted since
1992 and published in Princeton
Review's "Best 345 Colleges"
guide, ranks schools in 63 cate
gories based on in-person or

computer interviews with
100,000 students. The party
school designation is based on
student reports on alcohol and
marijuana use, the amount of
time spent studying outside of
class and the popularity of frater
nities and sororities on campus.
Princeton Review, a test
preparation and college admis
sions company with no connec
tion to Princeton University, de
fended its survey.
"We simply are reporting on
the conditions that exist on those
particular campuses, and if social
life continues to be an aspect that
students comment on, then I will
continue to include that list in the
book," said Robert Franek, the
company's editorial director.
Franek noted that the survey
also lists the top-20 "Stone-Cold
Sober Schools," where students
say there is little drinking.
Brigham Young University
topped that list for the third
straight year.
The American Medical Asso
ciation has repeatedly criticized
the "party school" rankings, say
ing they irresponsibly legitimize
high-risk drinking and portray
alcohol as central to college life.
On Monday, Richard Yoast
of the AMA's Office of Alcohol
and Other Drug Abuse called
the survey "a marketing gim
mick" and said it does a disser
vice to quality universities.
Following Florida, the rest of
the top 10 party schools were the
State University of New York-
Buffalo; the University of New
Hampshire; the University of
Colorado-Boulder; Florida
State University and the Univer
sity of Wisconsin-Madison.
