## DISPATCHES FROM THE OUTER DARKNESS Taming the wild beast of employment 
### MARK GANEK STAFF COLUMNIST 
Men are hunters by nature.
Millions of years of evolution
have instilled in our blood the in
stincts required to recognize the
subtle signs that prey is near. We
creep soundlessly through hostile
landscapes. Perhaps a faint scent
reaches our nostrils, triggering a
flood of adrenaline that sharpens
our vision and tightens our re
flexes. Then, in blur of deadly
speed, we lunge forward, flipping
our embossed, color-printed
cards into the attack position and
emitting the ear-searing battle
cry: "I would be a great asset to
the company."
Sadly, the skills honed by our
ancestors aren't much use in the
job hunt. Faced with a stressful sit
uation, your instincts tell you to ei
ther run away or stick a spear in
something, a response that biolo
gists call "fight or flight." And de
spite what companies say about
wanting pro-active, take-charge

decision-makers, I find that they
generally frown upon the spearing
of their personnel managers. I am
kidding, of course. They would
love to have these people skew
ered, but usually you cannot get
the spears past security.
In interviews, rather than
sprinting away shrieking or per
petrating horrific acts of vio
lence, I sweat, which is not near
ly as satisfying. 1 perspire great
gushing cataracts of sweat that
can't help but be noticed by the
smooth-faced, faux-cheerful,
corporate-culture-made-flesh
interviewer.
After such a performance, the
only way I can possibly get the job
is by hanging out in the waiting
room and drowning the competi
tion. How do I perform under
pressure? Like a sprinkler.
Despite these obstacles, I have
set my jaw, narrowed my eyes, and
stiffened my upper lip, none of
which makes me very attractive to
the opposite sex. It's too bad, be
cause I could use a little relaxation

while readying myself to plunge
into the swirling maelstrom of
doubt and soulless striving that
passes for the real world these
days. And the twitching face
cramps are almost as bad as the
sweating.
I am moving to Los Angeles,
hoping that the immediate logis
tics of sustenance in a new envi
ronment will jolt me into a voca
tion, but 1 will take precautious.
For instance, 1 will refuse to accept
any job title with completely arbi
trary syntax. Recently, most job
openings seem to have names like
"senior usability specialist" or "in
terface development strategy con
sulting." These job titles share an
increasingly common grammati
cal feature known as "ambivoidali
ty," which means that no matter
how many times you rearrange
the words in the job title, it still
means nothing.
1 may seem a little cynical about
the job market, but the working
world is a seriously scary place. My
first office job was providing Tech

nical Support for Automated
Phone Systems â€” or maybe it was
Automated Technicalities for Sys
tem Supported Phoning. I don't
really remember. The office itself
seemed possible as a physical space
only if "The Waste Land" and the
"Three Stooges" had been allowed
to mate.
When 1 first started at the job,
they put me through a day of train
ing. After the training, 1 asked my
pig-eyed supervisor if there was
anything else 1 needed to know. He
shifted his immense bulk and
squinted off into the distance.
Then he spoke. "Don't ever get
married, unless you're really, real
ly sure," he said. I don't ever think
I've seen a man more in need of a
mastodon and a spear.
These are the times that starch
men's souls, but 1 will not submit.
Despite my flaws, at least my
mother has faith that I will find a
job. I know this because on her
last visit, she confided to a friend
of mine that the two jobs she
thinks I will be able to get in Los

Angeles are stunt man and porn
star. At least it would be a job. You
know the great thing about moth
ers? Me neither.
I am flattered that she thinks my
life is much more interesting than
it actually is. Living on a three
legged couch, as 1 do, tends to
complicate a love life. At one party
1 threw, a young vixen asked me in
an insinuating, somewhat breathy
tone, "What happens if you want to
bring a girl home?" I coolly looked
her straight in the eye and said, "I
make a pillow fort."
Well, I'm oft to Los Angeles and
the job hunt. For my final word of
advice: no matter how bad office
life gets, you should resist the
temptation to turn the entire mar
keting department into smarm-ke
babs, unless you're completely out
of mastodons.

Mark Ganek is a recent graduate. He
would like to say, farewell Stanford,
land of youthful exuberance, I shall
fondly remember your blali blah blah
eloquence blah de blah. Phooey.
