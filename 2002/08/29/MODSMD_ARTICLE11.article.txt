# LETTER TO THE EDITOR

### 
So Hon Appetit is wondering
why it continues to lose cus
tomers, and thus business?
It's rather simple, really. Instead
of trying to pretend that they're
the campus equivalent of Spago,
they should return to providing a
varied, healthy selection of af
fordable food. A simple meal of
entree, side dish, beverage, and
dessert should not cost $10.
In the three years I've been at
Stanford (and purchased meals
at Tresidder at least three days a
week) I've seen a continual dete
rioration in the quality of the
food, in the variety of the lixxl, in
the size of portions, in the inclu
sions (beverage, side dish, or
dessert) — even in the propor
tion of carbon dioxide to soda in
the dispensers. This has been ac
companied by higher and higher
prices, poorer working condi
tions for their employees and a
lack of appealing offerings.
I'm not just grousing as a
naive consumer. I've had decades
of experience in and around the
f<)od service business, from serv

ice to management. I know about
margins and food costs, I know
about staffing and I know how
many food-service operations cut
their own throats by presuming
that they have a guaranteed cus
tomer base.
Bon Appetit has fallen prey to
this type of thinking, as well as the
hubris of assuming that, if they
fire workers during the summer,
they won't have to listen to pro
testers taking them to task about
their labor policies.
Hon Appetit is not the only
fcxxl source for us — better deals
and better nutrition is available
all around campus, and it's not
unheard of to actually plan ahead
and bring a lunch as well.
Maylie if we all stopped buy
ing from them, they'd have to
take a look at the policies that are
truly responsible for the decline
in their business: bad selection,
bad preparation, poorly-trained
employees and too little respect
for the consumer.
