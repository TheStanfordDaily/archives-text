# Weekly EIC says farewell
## 
### AMANDA CANEVARO EDITORIAL STAFF 
It took me three years to fig
ure out why I am so invigorated
and inspired, at least relatively
speaking, when I am on cam
pus. Whether I'm having lunch
on the Oval or fighting 11 a.m.
bike traffic, 1 am always content
and usually happy.
Even through the construc
tion, bureaucracy and other dis
organized aspects of the institu
tion, my eyes still light up when
1 see a Stanford professor on the
news or an alum on Sports Ce
nter. In fact, I will listen to, watch
or read almost anything related
to the University.
I finally figured out what cre
ates this strange sense: I am
under the Stanford Spell.
It is a spell cast by wizards —
the administrators, students and
professors — who mix academ
ics and athletics with beauty and
excellence. The product is a

feeling that, as a tile in the mosa
ic of the Stanford community,
you are both chosen and inte
gral and should be grateful and
responsible. It is captured in
that moment when you're walk
ing through the Quad and you
feel genuinely grateful that an
admissions department employ
ee put your application in the
right pile.
But, as was repeated during
Commencement ceremonies,
along with the rights and privi
leges the University affords its
students, it also brings responsi
bilities.
This summer 1 was privileged
to serve as editor of The Weekly,
and took seriously my responsibil
ity to inform the community and
reflect its diverse views and inter
ests. From Commencement to fall
sports previews, the paper cov
ered a breadth of topics and ex
plored the depths of the commit
ment and achievement that per
vade the Stanford community.

I was fortunate to have a stall
of writers, editors and photogra
phers equally charmed by the
University — or maybe just by
the promise of Wednesday night
dinners and baseball — who de
serve enormous credit for driv
ing the content and tone of the
newspaper. I first want to thank
the editorial staff for their cre
ativity, late nights and for always
keeping me entertained. I also
want to thank all of the editorial
contributors who gave their
time, words and images as well as
the advertising department who
make our work possible through
their hard work and dedication.
I also want the thank you, the
reader, for taking the time to de
vour, peruse or even just skim
the nine issues of the newspaper
this summer. I hope that through
its faults and assets, you have
been able to see the University as
I do and for its unique ability to
provoke thought, support inno
vation and develop ideas.
