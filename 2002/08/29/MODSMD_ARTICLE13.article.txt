# Don't forget non-profits in your job search

Editor's note: This column is part two of
a two-part series. See last week's Stan
ford Weekly for part one.
Successful economic develop
ment does not necessarily lead to
higher social standards. There
fore, even as a country is enthusias
tically building its economy, some
one needs to keep pushing for the
economic successes to be translated
into social successes. Someone
needs to make sure that a country
doesn't put off improving social,
political and legal structures and
rights so far into the future that
they are forgotten. Those some
ones are the non-profit organiza
tion, the social worker and the ac
tivist, which I had previously re
garded so lightly.
So given my new frame of mind,
will I shun the fall quarter Career
Fair and go work at a non-profit in
stead? I'm not quite sure yet.
There are lots of questions, big and
small, that 1 need to answer. Most
importantly, are my skills better
suited for making contributions to
the marketplace (at a private com
pany) or the social sector (at a non
profit)? Of course there are other

alternatives 011 the spectrum —
public posts, private sponsorship
of non-profit projects — but com
paring corporations to non-profits
is an easy start to thinking about
where I fit into the real world. Be
sides, having worked both at pri
vate corporations and non-profits,
I can compare the two to see which
one will satisfy more of my needs
and aspirations in life.
Perhaps you've pondered the
same question: Are the chances
that you will be happy and "make
a difference" greater if you're at a
private corporation, or if you de
vote yourself to a social cause? To
help myself work out an answer —
and to apply my summer non
profit experiences to constructing
future endeavors — I've made a
list of questions.
On my list, first comes passion.
Can I be passionate and enthusias
tic about sales, trading, manage
ment consulting and other such
projects? Or would I gain more in
tellectual and moral satisfaction
working on improving social secu
rity benefits in China?
To be honest, I need to weigh
compensation along with passion.
Even if I'm ambivalent about the
projects at a private corporation,
could I enjoy my job nevertheless

because it will pay me enough to
lead a comfortable life? Or is it
more likely that the fulfillment of
doing social work will more than
compensate fora smaller paycheck
at a non-profit?
Next is work pressure. My sum
mer non-profit internship showed
me that working styles differ from
private corporations to non-prof
its. Do I need a supervisor to set
deadlines, meetings and presenta
tions for me? Or am I a self-moti
vated employee who can work in
dependently? Surprisingly, I've
found working at a non-profit
more demanding of self-discipline.
Since I'm the only person working
on my project — a project that has
never been done before — I am
free to determine its direction and
timeline. This is a big responsibili
ty. Sometimes I almost wish I had a
supervisor to hand down specific,
timely assignments.
Work environment is more im
portant to me than I would have
thought. Regardless of whether I
like my assignments at a private
corporation, there will be a large
group of employees to socialize
with. Large private companies,
because they recruit several col
lege graduates every year, have
lively work atmospheres. I will be

able to meet bright young people
like myself.
At a non-profit, there are fewer
employees and they are generally a
more mixed group. They have dif
ferent ages, different stages of life
and different working styles. Is it
more important to me to be sur
rounded by other college gradu
ates who are also contemplating
graduate school and weekend
clubbing? Or would I appreciate
the wisdom and guidance of older
co-workers more?
Finally, I would never have
thought that my outlook on life
would be significantly affected by
a job, but it is. When I interned at
a private company, it was mostly a
light-hearted experience. I went
to work, pulled overtime hours,
and then left all my work at the
office.
At a non-profit, I've had a more
serious and sometimes frustrating
experience. Researching sad statis
tics and case studies everyday, I
can't help but think of all the things
that are wrong in the world. Worse
yet, I feel powerless to change
them. I often left work feeling as if
the weight of the world's problems
were on my shoulders.
When I go into the real world,
would I be strong enough to take

on a full-time job in serious social
issues? Or would I be better of}
maintaining high spirits while
processing private transactions
every day?
It seems that all my philosophiz
ing about economics and social
benefits has boiled down to prag
matic choices for next year. It's my
Stanford "mental quarter system"
at work. Maybe my non-profit
summer experienced hasn't
changed my mindset so much. But
at least I've thought about alterna
tive theories and choices.
Even though I now have a long
list of questions that I can't answer
yet, I am certain on one thing. If
you have the chance, do make non
profit work a part of your Stanford
experience. If you don't have the
chance, seek it out; the school has
many resources for putting you in
contact with social work. It will
teach you a lot about yourself and
the world you live in, regardless of
whether or not you decide to make
non-profit work a permanent part
of your life.

lead a comfortable life? Or is it
more likely that the fulfillment of
doing social work will more than
compensate fora smaller paycheck
at a non-profit?
Next is work pressure. My sum
mer non-profit internship showed
me that working styles differ from
private corporations to non-prof
its. Do I need a supervisor to set
deadlines, meetings and presenta
tions for me? Or am I a self-moti
vated employee who can work in
dependently? Surprisingly, I've
found working at a non-profit
more demanding of self-discipline.
Since I'm the only person working
on my project — a project that has
never been done before — I am
free to determine its direction and
timeline. This is a big responsibili
ty. Sometimes I almost wish I had a
supervisor to hand down specific,
timely assignments.
Work environment is more im
portant to me than I would have
thought. Regardless of whether I
like my assignments at a private
corporation, there will be a large
group of employees to socialize
with. Large private companies,
because they recruit several col
lege graduates every year, have
lively work atmospheres. I will be

able to meet bright young people
like myself.
At a non-profit, there are fewer
employees and they are generally a
more mixed group. They have dif
ferent ages, different stages of life
and different working styles. Is it
more important to me to be sur
rounded by other college gradu
ates who are also contemplating
graduate school and weekend
clubbing? Or would I appreciate
the wisdom and guidance of older
co-workers more?
Finally, I would never have
thought that my outlook on life
would be significantly affected by
a job, but it is. When I interned at
a private company, it was mostly a
light-hearted experience. I went
to work, pulled overtime hours,
and then left all my work at the
office.
At a non-profit, I've had a more
serious and sometimes frustrating
experience. Researching sad statis
tics and case studies everyday, I
can't help but think of all the things
that are wrong in the world. Worse
yet, I feel powerless to change
them. I often left work feeling as if
the weight of the world's problems
were on my shoulders.
When I go into the real world,
would I be strong enough to take

on a full-time job in serious social
issues? Or would I be better of}
maintaining high spirits while
processing private transactions
every day?
It seems that all my philosophiz
ing about economics and social
benefits has boiled down to prag
matic choices for next year. It's my
Stanford "mental quarter system"
at work. Maybe my non-profit
summer experienced hasn't
changed my mindset so much. But
at least I've thought about alterna
tive theories and choices.
Even though I now have a long
list of questions that I can't answer
yet, I am certain on one thing. If
you have the chance, do make non
profit work a part of your Stanford
experience. If you don't have the
chance, seek it out; the school has
many resources for putting you in
contact with social work. It will
teach you a lot about yourself and
the world you live in, regardless of
whether or not you decide to make
non-profit work a permanent part
of your life.

Successful economic develop
ment does not necessarily lead to
higher social standards. There
fore, even as a country is enthusias
tically building its economy, some
one needs to keep pushing for the
economic successes to be translated
into social successes. Someone
needs to make sure that a country
doesn't put off improving social,
political and legal structures and
rights so far into the future that
they are forgotten. Those some
ones are the non-profit organiza
tion, the social worker and the ac
tivist, which I had previously re
garded so lightly.
So given my new frame of mind,
will I shun the fall quarter Career
Fair and go work at a non-profit in
stead? I'm not quite sure yet.
There are lots of questions, big and
small, that 1 need to answer. Most
importantly, are my skills better
suited for making contributions to
the marketplace (at a private com
pany) or the social sector (at a non
profit)? Of course there are other

alternatives 011 the spectrum —
public posts, private sponsorship
of non-profit projects — but com
paring corporations to non-profits
is an easy start to thinking about
where I fit into the real world. Be
sides, having worked both at pri
vate corporations and non-profits,
I can compare the two to see which
one will satisfy more of my needs
and aspirations in life.
Perhaps you've pondered the
same question: Are the chances
that you will be happy and "make
a difference" greater if you're at a
private corporation, or if you de
vote yourself to a social cause? To
help myself work out an answer —
and to apply my summer non
profit experiences to constructing
future endeavors — I've made a
list of questions.
On my list, first comes passion.
Can I be passionate and enthusias
tic about sales, trading, manage
ment consulting and other such
projects? Or would I gain more in
tellectual and moral satisfaction
working on improving social secu
rity benefits in China?
To be honest, I need to weigh
compensation along with passion.
Even if I'm ambivalent about the
projects at a private corporation,
could I enjoy my job nevertheless

because it will pay me enough to
lead a comfortable life? Or is it
more likely that the fulfillment of
doing social work will more than
compensate fora smaller paycheck
at a non-profit?
