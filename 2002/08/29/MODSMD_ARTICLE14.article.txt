# LEMON HARANGUE PIE
## Airport security: ineffective and embarrassing 
### JOE LEMON STAFF COLUMNIST 
I recently took my first flight since
Sept. 11. (Yeah, I know, I'm a real
globetrotter.) The fact is that I have
been a little freaked about flying
since that fateful day. Consequently,
I'm a bit of airline security tint.
But, come on, let's be smart about
this. When I got to the airport at Mo
line, 111. — a known hotbed of ter
rorist activity — I was flagged fora
random inspection. No problem.
Iweedledee and Tweedledum came
over to the counter to confiscate my
meticulously packed suitcases. They
then rifled through my every be
longing with surgical gloves, but
without a surgeon's precision.
They say you should wear clean
underwear every day, in the event
that you have to make an emergency
trip to the hospital. Forget wearing
dirty laundry; I'm just glad 1 neg
lected to pack iny collection of
pornographic materials. I don't
know why I bothered to pack my
things at all. I should have just
dragged my gear up in a wheelbar
row for easier sifting.
Next was the inspection of the
carry-on bag. "Do you have a com
puter in your bag?" "Yes." "You

need to take it out of your bag to x
ray it."
112 need to take it out of my bag to
X-ray it? Wait a minute. I'm not a sci
ence major, so help me out here: the
purpose of the X-ray machine is to
see through things, isn't it? The X
ray machine can see through the
metal casing of my laptop, but only
when it's removed from my radia
tion-impervious canvas case?
So, the bags seemed to pass
muster, and it was on to the Mid
night Express-esque third-degree
search of my body. They start with
the magic wand, which is fairly in
nocuous.
Then, the guy asked me to un
buckle my belt. (I'm thinking, "Hey,
you didn't even buy me dinner;
what kind of boy do you take me
for?") I t(x)k off my belt. He scolded
me: "I didn't tell you to do that, sir."
Whatever, man.
"Unroll you waistband." I started
to unzip my pants, because I didnft
know what he meant. "I didn't ask
you to do that either, sir." Again,
whatever, man. I've never had any-
Ixxly ask me to unroll my waistband;
I don't know what that means. But,
I'll tell you what: let's make it a lull
strip search. Hey, I work out. I'm
proud of these pecs. Let's light ter

rorism and give the people a show at
the same time.
You may wonder how I remem
ber each phase of my security check
with such particularity. It's because I
was given the routine three times
during my journey. First at the X-ray
machine, then before boarding and
again in Chicago.
Let me repeat: I am all about se
curity. But, the way we are going
about it simply makes no sense. Po
litical correctness aficionados advise
us not to profile likely suspects.
What's wrong with profiling? If the
vast majority of airline terrorists in
recent memory share certain char
acteristics, why shouldn't we use this
information in our security search?
Whenever you hear about a sus
pected and apprehended criminal
in the news, they always say: "He (its
the profile; he was a loner; he
abused animals." We profile and
stereotype constantly. It's a mental
shortcut that has been encoded into
our consciousnesses.
If we're in the wilderness and we
see a bear attack another being, we
make a note to ourselves: "llmm,
might want to watch out for those
bears." If 95 percent of airline ter
rorists in have been Muslim extrem
ists, I say we keep our eyes peeled for

Muslim extremists.
Oh, yeah, there is the matter of
the Constitution and the Equal Pro
tection Clause. I'm a big fan of each,
but the U.S. Supreme Court does
allow differential treatment on the
basis of otherwise suspect classifica
tions, provided that the government
purpose is compelling and the
means to achieve that end pose the
least restrictive imposition available.
Preventing terrorism: a com
pelling interest? Yeah, no problem.
Least restrictive alternative? Maybe
not. Maybe if we want to avoid of
fending those who might be pro
filed, we should subject everyone to
the thorough search process. That
would be acceptable to me.
If we're not going to subject all
passengers to the comprehensive se
curity checks, I have an alternative
suggestion: voluntary profiling. I'd
cheerfully go into an administrative
office and be psychologically pro
filed so that airlines would know not
to suspect me. (live me an encrypt
ed photo ID card, and a lot of secu
rity concerns could be allayed and
time could be saved in future flights.
Hiis way, even people who might
otherwise be profiled could proac
tively gain clearance.
Hie security issue is about per

ception as much as it concerns actu
ally stopping terrorists. And, unfor
tunately, randomly selecting me for
a test doesn't give me any confidence
that actual potential miscreants will
be apprehended.
It doesn't take a genius to spend
five minutes brainstorming how to
skirt the security system. Not only do
at least 75 percent of the passengers
squeak through with little more
than the regular routine, as long as
you smuggle contraband by means
other than concealment in your
shoes or belt buckle, you're pretty
likely to (oil the security officers.
If someone wants to cause harm,
he can find a way. So, let's devote the
resources to finding those people,
rather than strip-searching grand
mothers who happen to purchase
one-way tickets to lopeka.
Is it a bummer that some civil lib
erties will be nominally infringed?
Of course. But our decision not to
focus on targeted profiling might
prove tragically worse.

Of course. But our decision not to
focus on targeted profiling might
prove tragically worse.

I recently took my first flight since
Sept. 11. (Yeah, I know, I'm a real
globetrotter.) The fact is that I have
been a little freaked about flying
since that fateful day. Consequently,
I'm a bit of airline security tint.
But, come on, let's be smart about
this. When I got to the airport at Mo
line, 111. — a known hotbed of ter
rorist activity — I was flagged fora
random inspection. No problem.
Iweedledee and Tweedledum came
over to the counter to confiscate my
meticulously packed suitcases. They
then rifled through my every be
longing with surgical gloves, but
without a surgeon's precision.
They say you should wear clean
underwear every day, in the event
that you have to make an emergency
trip to the hospital. Forget wearing
dirty laundry; I'm just glad 1 neg
lected to pack iny collection of
pornographic materials. I don't
know why I bothered to pack my
things at all. I should have just
dragged my gear up in a wheelbar
row for easier sifting.
Next was the inspection of the
carry-on bag. "Do you have a com
puter in your bag?" "Yes." "You

need to take it out of your bag to x
ray it."
112 need to take it out of my bag to
X-ray it? Wait a minute. I'm not a sci
ence major, so help me out here: the
purpose of the X-ray machine is to
see through things, isn't it? The X
ray machine can see through the
metal casing of my laptop, but only
when it's removed from my radia
tion-impervious canvas case?
So, the bags seemed to pass
muster, and it was on to the Mid
night Express-esque third-degree
search of my body. They start with
the magic wand, which is fairly in
nocuous.
Then, the guy asked me to un
buckle my belt. (I'm thinking, "Hey,
you didn't even buy me dinner;
what kind of boy do you take me
for?") I t(x)k off my belt. He scolded
me: "I didn't tell you to do that, sir."
Whatever, man.
"Unroll you waistband." I started
to unzip my pants, because I didnft
know what he meant. "I didn't ask
you to do that either, sir." Again,
whatever, man. I've never had any-
Ixxly ask me to unroll my waistband;
I don't know what that means. But,
I'll tell you what: let's make it a lull
strip search. Hey, I work out. I'm
proud of these pecs. Let's light ter

rorism and give the people a show at
the same time.
You may wonder how I remem
ber each phase of my security check
with such particularity. It's because I
was given the routine three times
during my journey. First at the X-ray
machine, then before boarding and
again in Chicago.
Let me repeat: I am all about se
curity. But, the way we are going
about it simply makes no sense. Po
litical correctness aficionados advise
us not to profile likely suspects.
What's wrong with profiling? If the
vast majority of airline terrorists in
recent memory share certain char
acteristics, why shouldn't we use this
information in our security search?
Whenever you hear about a sus
pected and apprehended criminal
in the news, they always say: "He (its
the profile; he was a loner; he
abused animals." We profile and
stereotype constantly. It's a mental
shortcut that has been encoded into
our consciousnesses.
If we're in the wilderness and we
see a bear attack another being, we
make a note to ourselves: "llmm,
might want to watch out for those
bears." If 95 percent of airline ter
rorists in have been Muslim extrem
ists, I say we keep our eyes peeled for

Muslim extremists.
Oh, yeah, there is the matter of
the Constitution and the Equal Pro
tection Clause. I'm a big fan of each,
but the U.S. Supreme Court does
allow differential treatment on the
basis of otherwise suspect classifica
tions, provided that the government
purpose is compelling and the
means to achieve that end pose the
least restrictive imposition available.
Preventing terrorism: a com
pelling interest? Yeah, no problem.
Least restrictive alternative? Maybe
not. Maybe if we want to avoid of
fending those who might be pro
filed, we should subject everyone to
the thorough search process. That
would be acceptable to me.
If we're not going to subject all
passengers to the comprehensive se
curity checks, I have an alternative
suggestion: voluntary profiling. I'd
cheerfully go into an administrative
office and be psychologically pro
filed so that airlines would know not
to suspect me. (live me an encrypt
ed photo ID card, and a lot of secu
rity concerns could be allayed and
time could be saved in future flights.
Hiis way, even people who might
otherwise be profiled could proac
tively gain clearance.
Hie security issue is about per

ception as much as it concerns actu
ally stopping terrorists. And, unfor
tunately, randomly selecting me for
a test doesn't give me any confidence
that actual potential miscreants will
be apprehended.
It doesn't take a genius to spend
five minutes brainstorming how to
skirt the security system. Not only do
at least 75 percent of the passengers
squeak through with little more
than the regular routine, as long as
you smuggle contraband by means
other than concealment in your
shoes or belt buckle, you're pretty
likely to (oil the security officers.
If someone wants to cause harm,
he can find a way. So, let's devote the
resources to finding those people,
rather than strip-searching grand
mothers who happen to purchase
one-way tickets to lopeka.

erties will be nominally infringed?
