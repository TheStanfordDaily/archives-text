## Lewis & Co. set out to chart new territory Coach Buddy Teevens brings "fun and gun" offense to the Farm 
### MATT LONG STAFF WRITER 
Stanford has a new coach, a new
staff and a new offensive game plan.
The Cardinal has a new locker
room, a new weight room and even
new uniforms. But from outside the
football program come the same old
low preseason expectations, and
that's largely because Stanford has
an entirely new defense.
Despite inheriting a 9-3 team

that finished last season ranked No.
16 and tied for second in the Pacific
-10 Conference, coach Buddy
Teevens will enter his first season
with the Cardinal poised to play the
role of the underdog, just as his
predecessor Tyrone Willingham
was forced to do in each of the last
seven seasons. Stanford begins 2002
out of the top-25, and picked to fin
ish anywhere from sixth to ninth in
the Pac-10 by national media
sources.
That's largely because on paper
the Cardinal has all the balance of
Enron's accounting sheets.
The Pac-10's top-scoring offense
in 2001 returns seven starters, and
that's not even counting junior

quarterback Chris Lewis (20 career
touchdowns), sophomore receiver
Teyo Johnson (last season's confer
ence co-Freshman of the Year) or
senior tailback Kerry Carter (a con
sistent producer since he starred as
a true freshman).
The offense has spent the offsea
son studying Teevens's pass-heavy
playbook. His game plan has al
ready been dubbed the "fun and
gun" in tribute to his last coaching
stint as offensive assistant under
Steve Spurrier at Florida. Teevens
has relied on the players' intelli
gence and experience to quickly
learn the plays.
"Over a two-week time, we are
basically putting a greater percent

age of our offense in the first couple
of days," Teevens said. "We are rely
ing on their ability to digest and also
to recall, which allows us to acceler
ate the process."
Even with a pass-first philosophy,
Teevens realizes the importance of
establishing a strong running game,
especially with seniors Carter and
fullback Casey Moore back after
helping the Cardinal lead the Pac
-10 in rushing last season.
"Historically Stanford has
thrown the ball a lot and I'd like to
have that ability again," Teevens
said. "Working with coach Spurrier
was a tremendous education, and
prior to that at every stop I've
thrown the ball a great deal. We'd

like to be very multiple. Of course
with our ollensive line and running
backs, we'll also have balance."
On the other side of the ball, it's a
whole different story. Teevens is
happy to have a crop of the nation's
top recruits from the past few years
to fid out his defense. The problem
is a majority have never made a hit
011 a college football field.
Just two starters, senior tackles
Matt Leonard and Craig Albrecht
return. Senior tackle Trey Freeman
and senior safety Colin Branch are
the only other players on the roster
with significant defensive experi
ence. It's not clear yet who will line
