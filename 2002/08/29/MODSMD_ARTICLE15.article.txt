## Lewis & Co. set out to chart new territory Coach Buddy Teevens brings "fun and gun" offense to the Farm 
### MATT LONG STAFF WRITER 
Stanford has a new coach, a new
staff and a new offensive game plan.
The Cardinal has a new locker
room, a new weight room and even
new uniforms. But from outside the
football program come the same old
low preseason expectations, and
that's largely because Stanford has
an entirely new defense.
Despite inheriting a 9-3 team

that finished last season ranked No.
16 and tied for second in the Pacific
-10 Conference, coach Buddy
Teevens will enter his first season
with the Cardinal poised to play the
role of the underdog, just as his
predecessor Tyrone Willingham
was forced to do in each of the last
seven seasons. Stanford begins 2002
out of the top-25, and picked to fin
ish anywhere from sixth to ninth in
the Pac-10 by national media
sources.
That's largely because on paper
the Cardinal has all the balance of
Enron's accounting sheets.
The Pac-10's top-scoring offense
in 2001 returns seven starters, and
that's not even counting junior

quarterback Chris Lewis (20 career
touchdowns), sophomore receiver
Teyo Johnson (last season's confer
ence co-Freshman of the Year) or
senior tailback Kerry Carter (a con
sistent producer since he starred as
a true freshman).
The offense has spent the offsea
son studying Teevens's pass-heavy
playbook. His game plan has al
ready been dubbed the "fun and
gun" in tribute to his last coaching
stint as offensive assistant under
Steve Spurrier at Florida. Teevens
has relied on the players' intelli
gence and experience to quickly
learn the plays.
"Over a two-week time, we are
basically putting a greater percent

age of our offense in the first couple
of days," Teevens said. "We are rely
ing on their ability to digest and also
to recall, which allows us to acceler
ate the process."
Even with a pass-first philosophy,
Teevens realizes the importance of
establishing a strong running game,
especially with seniors Carter and
fullback Casey Moore back after
helping the Cardinal lead the Pac
-10 in rushing last season.
"Historically Stanford has
thrown the ball a lot and I'd like to
have that ability again," Teevens
said. "Working with coach Spurrier
was a tremendous education, and
prior to that at every stop I've
thrown the ball a great deal. We'd

like to be very multiple. Of course
with our ollensive line and running
backs, we'll also have balance."
On the other side of the ball, it's a
whole different story. Teevens is
happy to have a crop of the nation's
top recruits from the past few years
to fid out his defense. The problem
is a majority have never made a hit
011 a college football field.
Just two starters, senior tackles
Matt Leonard and Craig Albrecht
return. Senior tackle Trey Freeman
and senior safety Colin Branch are
the only other players on the roster
with significant defensive experi
ence. It's not clear yet who will line
up behind them, but while the
trenches may be in experienced
hands, the always shaky Stanford
secondary will be mostly untested
come Sept. 7 against Boston Col
lege. For the Cardinal to become
bowl eligible, let alone challenge for
the conference crown, the rookies
must play like veterans right away.
Speedy sophomores Leigh Tor
rence and Stanley Wilson will an
chor the corners and do their best to
contain some of the nation's top re
ceivers, like Southern California's
Kareem Kelly and Washington
State's Mike Bush.

Redshirt freshman Michael
Craven needs to live up to his billing
as the nation's top linebacker recruit
and challenge running backs like
Oregon's Onterrio Smith and Ari
zona's Clarence Farmer.
"We have guys that have not set
foot on the varsity field and they
have to play like they have,"
Teevens said. "We can make a big
deal that they don't have experi
ence, but what I told the guys is that
it is the same game that they have
played fora long time. It is nothing
new to them and we have to go in
with that mindset that they are
ready to go."
One boon to the young defense is
that it will have practiced against
what may lie one of the nation's
most potent point producers come

game time.
Stanford's offensive unit boasts
the Pac-10's best offensive line,
which should present Lewis with
plenty of opportunities to find one
of his three star receivers. Junior
tackle Kwame Harris and senior
guard Greg Schindler each gar
nered preseason Ail-American hon
ors and the line also returns starting
junior tackle Kirk Chambers and
fifth-year senior guard Paul
Weinacht, who frequently saw ac
tion as a utility lineman last season.
The receiving corps also lines up
as one of college football's finest.
Johnson will be featured even more
in his second season and junior
flanker Luke Powell, last year's lead
ing receiver and a first team All-
American selection as punt return

er, can turn any play into a scoring
opportunity. His 22.3 yards per re
ception average ranks first on Stan
ford's all time list. The fi-foot-7
giant's athleticism paired with the 5-
7 Powell's explosiveness will strike
opponents with a lethal thunder
and lightning combination. And
when opposing secondaries over
commit their personnel to stopping
these two, Teevens can counter with
senior Ryan Wells (55 career recep
tions).
These talented targets, along
with a new, pass-oriented offense,
bode extremely well for Lewis. A
prized recruit out of Long Beach
Poly High School, Lewis finally has
a chance to establish himself among
the great Cardinal signalcallers.
Lewis earned his stripes as a backup

in the past two seasons, relieving in
jured Randy Fasani in several big
games and leading Stanford to vic
tory. Last season he was thrust into
the starting role in the heart of Stan
ford's conference schedule, and the
result was wins over No. 4 Oregon,
No. 5 UCLA and a 3-1 overall
record as a starter.
"He is the type of guy that [the
responsibility] does not seem to af
fect him one way or another,"
Teevens said. "I am very impressed
by what he did last year, by step
ping in after an injury. That is a
great quality to have, where noth
ing seems to rattle him. We rested
him this spring, he worked hard
this summer with the receivers and
I am excited to see what he does
this fall."

ford's all time list. The fi-foot-7
giant's athleticism paired with the 5-
7 Powell's explosiveness will strike
opponents with a lethal thunder
and lightning combination. And
when opposing secondaries over
commit their personnel to stopping
these two, Teevens can counter with
senior Ryan Wells (55 career recep
tions).
These talented targets, along
with a new, pass-oriented offense,
bode extremely well for Lewis. A
prized recruit out of Long Beach
Poly High School, Lewis finally has
a chance to establish himself among
the great Cardinal signalcallers.
Lewis earned his stripes as a backup

in the past two seasons, relieving in
jured Randy Fasani in several big
games and leading Stanford to vic
tory. Last season he was thrust into
the starting role in the heart of Stan
ford's conference schedule, and the
result was wins over No. 4 Oregon,
No. 5 UCLA and a 3-1 overall
record as a starter.
"He is the type of guy that [the
responsibility] does not seem to af
fect him one way or another,"
Teevens said. "I am very impressed
by what he did last year, by step
ping in after an injury. That is a
great quality to have, where noth
ing seems to rattle him. We rested
him this spring, he worked hard
this summer with the receivers and
I am excited to see what he does
this fall."
Stanford has a new coach, a new
staff and a new offensive game plan.
The Cardinal has a new locker
room, a new weight room and even
new uniforms. But from outside the
football program come the same old
low preseason expectations, and
that's largely because Stanford has
an entirely new defense.
Despite inheriting a 9-3 team

that finished last season ranked No.
16 and tied for second in the Pacific
-10 Conference, coach Buddy
Teevens will enter his first season
with the Cardinal poised to play the
role of the underdog, just as his
predecessor Tyrone Willingham
was forced to do in each of the last
seven seasons. Stanford begins 2002
out of the top-25, and picked to fin
ish anywhere from sixth to ninth in
the Pac-10 by national media
sources.
That's largely because on paper
the Cardinal has all the balance of
Enron's accounting sheets.
The Pac-10's top-scoring offense
in 2001 returns seven starters, and
that's not even counting junior

quarterback Chris Lewis (20 career
touchdowns), sophomore receiver
Teyo Johnson (last season's confer
ence co-Freshman of the Year) or
senior tailback Kerry Carter (a con
sistent producer since he starred as
a true freshman).
The offense has spent the offsea
son studying Teevens's pass-heavy
playbook. His game plan has al
ready been dubbed the "fun and
gun" in tribute to his last coaching
stint as offensive assistant under
Steve Spurrier at Florida. Teevens
has relied on the players' intelli
gence and experience to quickly
learn the plays.
"Over a two-week time, we are
basically putting a greater percent

age of our offense in the first couple
of days," Teevens said. "We are rely
ing on their ability to digest and also
to recall, which allows us to acceler
ate the process."
Even with a pass-first philosophy,
Teevens realizes the importance of
establishing a strong running game,
especially with seniors Carter and
fullback Casey Moore back after
helping the Cardinal lead the Pac
-10 in rushing last season.
"Historically Stanford has
thrown the ball a lot and I'd like to
have that ability again," Teevens
said. "Working with coach Spurrier
was a tremendous education, and
prior to that at every stop I've
thrown the ball a great deal. We'd

like to be very multiple. Of course
with our ollensive line and running
backs, we'll also have balance."
On the other side of the ball, it's a
whole different story. Teevens is
happy to have a crop of the nation's
top recruits from the past few years
to fid out his defense. The problem
is a majority have never made a hit
011 a college football field.
Just two starters, senior tackles
Matt Leonard and Craig Albrecht
return. Senior tackle Trey Freeman
and senior safety Colin Branch are
the only other players on the roster
with significant defensive experi
ence. It's not clear yet who will line
up behind them, but while the
trenches may be in experienced
hands, the always shaky Stanford
secondary will be mostly untested
come Sept. 7 against Boston Col
lege. For the Cardinal to become
bowl eligible, let alone challenge for
the conference crown, the rookies
must play like veterans right away.
Speedy sophomores Leigh Tor
rence and Stanley Wilson will an
chor the corners and do their best to
contain some of the nation's top re
ceivers, like Southern California's
Kareem Kelly and Washington
State's Mike Bush.

Redshirt freshman Michael
Craven needs to live up to his billing
as the nation's top linebacker recruit
and challenge running backs like
Oregon's Onterrio Smith and Ari
zona's Clarence Farmer.
"We have guys that have not set
foot on the varsity field and they
have to play like they have,"
Teevens said. "We can make a big
deal that they don't have experi
ence, but what I told the guys is that
it is the same game that they have
played fora long time. It is nothing
new to them and we have to go in
with that mindset that they are
ready to go."
One boon to the young defense is
that it will have practiced against
what may lie one of the nation's
most potent point producers come

game time.
Stanford's offensive unit boasts
the Pac-10's best offensive line,
which should present Lewis with
plenty of opportunities to find one
of his three star receivers. Junior
tackle Kwame Harris and senior
guard Greg Schindler each gar
nered preseason Ail-American hon
ors and the line also returns starting
junior tackle Kirk Chambers and
fifth-year senior guard Paul
Weinacht, who frequently saw ac
tion as a utility lineman last season.
The receiving corps also lines up
as one of college football's finest.
Johnson will be featured even more
in his second season and junior
flanker Luke Powell, last year's lead
ing receiver and a first team All-
American selection as punt return

er, can turn any play into a scoring
opportunity. His 22.3 yards per re
ception average ranks first on Stan
ford's all time list. The fi-foot-7
giant's athleticism paired with the 5-
7 Powell's explosiveness will strike
opponents with a lethal thunder
and lightning combination. And
