# Men's water polo eager to defend title
## 
### ANDREA COX 
The Stanford men's water polo team
has begun its 2002 season. With All-
Americans Tony Azevedo, Peter Hud
nut, Jeff Nesmith and Nic k Ellis leading
the way, the Cardinal secured third
place at the 2002 Men's Senior National
Championships earlier this month in
Corona del Mar, Calif.
The Cardinal, after a well-deserved
rest and a controversial Sports Illustrat
ed for Women feature, will don skull
caps and speedos and return to Avery
Aquatic Center to play a Scrimmage
Tournament on Sept. 7.
It is important to note that although
this team is featured in Sports Illustrat
ed for Women as eye candy, they have
won nine NCAA Championships, in
cluding last year's, many are All-Amer
icans and there is a star Olympian
among them. Don't let the fact that a
national magazine showcased this
group of men for their tans and pecs
distract from the reality that they are
indeed skilled players.
Currently, Azevedo and Hudnut are
with the U.S. Men's Senior National team
on its European tour. The team will begin
with a trip to Hungary for the Unicum
Cup, then head to Belgrade, Yugoslavia
for the 2002 FINA World Cup.
The Cardinal will take on UC-Santa
Cruz at Avery Aquatic Center at noon
on Sept. 8. Then they will head south to
play against UC-San Diego, and will
continue to Los Angeles to participate
in the Southern California Tourna
ment. They will return to their home
turf on Sept. 21 to face UC-Santa Bar
bara at noon. Be there to see Nesmith's
offensive skills, Ellis's skillful saves at the
net, I ludnut's and Azevedo's goals, and
the artful teamwork of this group of
men that can do more than just look
good fora picture.
