# Young squad focuses on meeting goal
## 
### JIMMY WU STAFF WRITER 
After losing five seniors, who as a group
boasted one All-American, two first team Pacific
-10 All-Conference, one Pac-10 All-Conference
Honorable Mention distinction, and three re
cent Major League Soccer draft picks, most
teams would be declaring the upcoming season
as a rebuilding one.
But for coach Bret Simon's men's soccer
squad, a NCAA title is closer to what the Cardi
nal wants to achieve.
Even with the loss of key players such as star
defender Lee Morrison, midfielder Derek
Shanahan and defender Aaron Biddle, Simon
believes that this year's team has all the potential
to be one of the top contenders in the nation.
I Jowever, he emphasizes how unpredictable the
game of soccer can be.
"In men's soccer, there's very little difference
between the top team and the 100 th team, so the
margin for error is very small," Simon said. "We
have a lot of potential, but we have a ways to go
to realize that full potential, and if we do, we'll
be one of the better teams in the country."
The preseason polls certainly think so, as
Stanford is at No. 2 behind 2001 national cham
pionship finalist Indiana. Pac-10 coaches have
also picked the Cardinal to repeat as Pac-10
champions.
Despite the return of five of Stanford's top six
scorers, Simon is worried about having an in
jury-plagued squad. Some players sustained in
juries and illnesses over the summer and a few
have been working to get back to full health
from last season.
With only 23 spots, including four in
coming freshmen, the Cardinal has a shal
low roster. Along with the health uncer
tainty of several players, it is very difficult
to gauge how the team will perform early
on.
"We have a nice group of players, but
with injuries, we haven't had the full group
together for many training sessions, so we
have a ways to go," Simon said. "I think
you'll see us in the early season still in a for
mation period. We have an idea of what
will work best, but because of new players
and injuries, it's going to take a while."
His other concern for the season is how
the Cardinal will respond to the losses of
two stalwart right defenders in Morrison
and Biddle. With seniors Andrew Terris,
Todd Dunivant and Taylor Graham man
ning the goal and left side of the defense,
the Cardinal is on a mission to find able re
placements on the right side of the field.
"For four years, Morrison was one of the
best players in the country and Biddle blos
somed into a great attacking defender; it's
hard to replace that kind of experience,"
Simon said. "The guys now might not be
quite as good, but 1 suspect you'll see that
our team's defense will continue to be a
strength and that the [defense] will be
fine."
Coach Simon hopes that out of a group
that includes sophomore Aaron Maines,
junior co-tri-captain Abe Geiger, and fresh
men Chad Marshall and Bronson McDon
ald, he will able to find a Morrison or Bid

die-like player who is able to develop play
from the back and also attack the goal.
Despite these concerns, Simon is happy
with the team's spirit, its overall fitness
level and new leadership. The five biggest
reasons for this optimism in the leadership
are senior starters Terris, Roger Levesque,
Dunivant, Graham and Johanes Maliza.

This class of seniors is most notorious
for its leadership by example and hard
work, and teammates and coaching staff
are looking to the seniors to lead the team
to much success this season.
"This group of seniors is the best group
of leaders and the most dedicated people
that 1 have had in 22 years of coaching,"
Simon said. "Each of them by themselves
would rate as a top captain for any team
that 1 have ever coached. The live of them
together make an awesome group that in
spires by their work ethic as well as their
ability."
Midfielder Maliza is a player to watch as
he is capable of becoming one of the best
field generals in the nation. Last season, he
showed flashes of brilliance with clever
play and is known for his incredible fitness.
Goalkeeper Terris had a breakthrough
season last year as he finished as one of the
nation's goals-against leaders with a 0.64
goals-against average. He recorded 11
shutouts, including a 1-0 win over Saint
Louis in the quarterfinals of the NCAA
College Cup.
Levesque, the Cardinal's star striker, re
turns as the Pac-10 Player of the Year, after
notching 37 points, 14 goals and nine as
sists, as the leading scorer in the confer
ence. One of the tri-captains of the squad,
he enters the season as one of the biggest
question marks as he continues to fight a
nagging back injury.
Joining Levesque as co-tri-captain and
player of the year candidate is Dunivant.
His attacking style from the back will be an
invaluable asset to Coach Simon's style of
play.

Fighting off a back injury, last year's Pacific-10
Player of the Year Roger Levesque will lead the
No. 2 Cardinal into its first challenge this Sat
urday against Sacramento State at Moloney
Field.


AAARIO SCUSSEL/The Stanford Daily File
Senior Johanes Maliza will use his superior fit
ness, speed and brilliance to dominate the mid
field alongside junior Mike Wilson, sopho
more Seyi Abolaji and junior Aaron Maines.
The other returning defensive
starter will be the vocal Graham,
a superior ball winner. He and
Dunivant will form a solid left de
fensive front and their talent and
experience should establish the
Cardinal "D" as a team strength.
Another key member of the
Cardinal defense is backup keep
er sophomore Robby Fulton. Ac
cording to Simon, he and Terris
are probably two of the top-10
netminders in the nation.
As for the missing pieces on
defense, the coaching staff has
been looking mainly at Maines,
Geiger, Marshall and McDonald.
Maines played some defense last
season and was a top substitute.
Geiger was a second-team All-
Pac-10 in midfield last year, but
has been used with success in the
backfield
As one of the top recruits in
the nation, Marshall will proba
bly figure in as a defensive starter
or key substitute. He is consid
ered one of the best defenders to
come out of the U.S. program in
recent times.
Accompanying Maliza in the
midfield will be junior Mike Wil
son and sophomore Seyi Abolaji.
Simon is toying with moving
Maines to midfield, and sopho
mores Todd Leber, Clayton Pe
ters and Luis Gonzalez, and
freshman Kevin Coyne will be
key contributors.
Although they will have to re
place Shanahan and Matt Moses,
two scoring midfielders, this
group can compensate with its
extensive creativity, its ball-win
ning capabilities, athleticism and
ability to keep ball possession.
The midfielders will be prima
rily responsible for creating op
portunities for the Cardinal's two
big scorers, Levesque and sopho
more Matt Janusz. Other key lor
wards on the squad include
sophomores Darren Fernandez,
James Twellman and Sean
Whalen. This group has been bit
ten by the injury bug the most
with Levesque, Janusz, and Fer
nandez all still recovering from
their ailments.
The Cardinal will begin to an
swer some of its big preseason
questions against Sacramento
State this Saturday at Maloney
Field. Before Pac-10 play begins
on Oct. 11 against Washington,
the Cardinal will have participat
ed in several tournaments in
cluding the Bay Area Classic,
Dartmouth Tourney and the
Nike Invitational.
Sophomore James Twellman
is confident.
"If we are able to play well to
gether as a team, then I don't
think that there is anyone who
can beat us."

questions against Sacramento
State this Saturday at Maloney
Field. Before Pac-10 play begins
on Oct. 11 against Washington,
the Cardinal will have participat
ed in several tournaments in
cluding the Bay Area Classic,
Dartmouth Tourney and the
Nike Invitational.
Sophomore James Twellman
is confident.
"If we are able to play well to
gether as a team, then I don't
think that there is anyone who
can beat us."
After losing five seniors, who as a group
boasted one All-American, two first team Pacific
-10 All-Conference, one Pac-10 All-Conference
Honorable Mention distinction, and three re
cent Major League Soccer draft picks, most
teams would be declaring the upcoming season
as a rebuilding one.
But for coach Bret Simon's men's soccer
squad, a NCAA title is closer to what the Cardi
nal wants to achieve.
Even with the loss of key players such as star
defender Lee Morrison, midfielder Derek
Shanahan and defender Aaron Biddle, Simon
believes that this year's team has all the potential
to be one of the top contenders in the nation.
I Jowever, he emphasizes how unpredictable the
game of soccer can be.
"In men's soccer, there's very little difference
between the top team and the 100 th team, so the
margin for error is very small," Simon said. "We
have a lot of potential, but we have a ways to go
to realize that full potential, and if we do, we'll
be one of the better teams in the country."
The preseason polls certainly think so, as
Stanford is at No. 2 behind 2001 national cham
pionship finalist Indiana. Pac-10 coaches have
also picked the Cardinal to repeat as Pac-10
champions.
Despite the return of five of Stanford's top six
scorers, Simon is worried about having an in
jury-plagued squad. Some players sustained in
juries and illnesses over the summer and a few
have been working to get back to full health
from last season.
With only 23 spots, including four in
coming freshmen, the Cardinal has a shal
low roster. Along with the health uncer
tainty of several players, it is very difficult
to gauge how the team will perform early
on.
"We have a nice group of players, but
with injuries, we haven't had the full group
together for many training sessions, so we
have a ways to go," Simon said. "I think
you'll see us in the early season still in a for
mation period. We have an idea of what
will work best, but because of new players
and injuries, it's going to take a while."
His other concern for the season is how
the Cardinal will respond to the losses of
two stalwart right defenders in Morrison
and Biddle. With seniors Andrew Terris,
Todd Dunivant and Taylor Graham man
ning the goal and left side of the defense,
the Cardinal is on a mission to find able re
placements on the right side of the field.
"For four years, Morrison was one of the
best players in the country and Biddle blos
somed into a great attacking defender; it's
hard to replace that kind of experience,"
Simon said. "The guys now might not be
quite as good, but 1 suspect you'll see that
our team's defense will continue to be a
strength and that the [defense] will be
fine."
Coach Simon hopes that out of a group
that includes sophomore Aaron Maines,
junior co-tri-captain Abe Geiger, and fresh
men Chad Marshall and Bronson McDon
ald, he will able to find a Morrison or Bid

die-like player who is able to develop play
from the back and also attack the goal.
Despite these concerns, Simon is happy
with the team's spirit, its overall fitness
level and new leadership. The five biggest
reasons for this optimism in the leadership
are senior starters Terris, Roger Levesque,
Dunivant, Graham and Johanes Maliza.

This class of seniors is most notorious
for its leadership by example and hard
work, and teammates and coaching staff
are looking to the seniors to lead the team
to much success this season.
"This group of seniors is the best group
of leaders and the most dedicated people
that 1 have had in 22 years of coaching,"
Simon said. "Each of them by themselves
would rate as a top captain for any team
that 1 have ever coached. The live of them
together make an awesome group that in
spires by their work ethic as well as their
ability."
Midfielder Maliza is a player to watch as
he is capable of becoming one of the best
field generals in the nation. Last season, he
showed flashes of brilliance with clever
play and is known for his incredible fitness.
Goalkeeper Terris had a breakthrough
season last year as he finished as one of the
nation's goals-against leaders with a 0.64
goals-against average. He recorded 11
shutouts, including a 1-0 win over Saint
Louis in the quarterfinals of the NCAA
College Cup.
Levesque, the Cardinal's star striker, re
turns as the Pac-10 Player of the Year, after
notching 37 points, 14 goals and nine as
sists, as the leading scorer in the confer
ence. One of the tri-captains of the squad,
he enters the season as one of the biggest
question marks as he continues to fight a
nagging back injury.
Joining Levesque as co-tri-captain and
player of the year candidate is Dunivant.
His attacking style from the back will be an
invaluable asset to Coach Simon's style of
play.

Fighting off a back injury, last year's Pacific-10
Player of the Year Roger Levesque will lead the
No. 2 Cardinal into its first challenge this Sat
urday against Sacramento State at Moloney
Field.


AAARIO SCUSSEL/The Stanford Daily File
Senior Johanes Maliza will use his superior fit
ness, speed and brilliance to dominate the mid
field alongside junior Mike Wilson, sopho
more Seyi Abolaji and junior Aaron Maines.
The other returning defensive
starter will be the vocal Graham,
a superior ball winner. He and
Dunivant will form a solid left de
fensive front and their talent and
experience should establish the
Cardinal "D" as a team strength.
Another key member of the
Cardinal defense is backup keep
er sophomore Robby Fulton. Ac
cording to Simon, he and Terris
are probably two of the top-10
netminders in the nation.
As for the missing pieces on
defense, the coaching staff has
been looking mainly at Maines,
Geiger, Marshall and McDonald.
Maines played some defense last
season and was a top substitute.
Geiger was a second-team All-
Pac-10 in midfield last year, but
has been used with success in the
backfield
As one of the top recruits in
the nation, Marshall will proba
bly figure in as a defensive starter
or key substitute. He is consid
ered one of the best defenders to
come out of the U.S. program in
recent times.
Accompanying Maliza in the
midfield will be junior Mike Wil
son and sophomore Seyi Abolaji.
Simon is toying with moving
Maines to midfield, and sopho
mores Todd Leber, Clayton Pe
ters and Luis Gonzalez, and
freshman Kevin Coyne will be
key contributors.
Although they will have to re
place Shanahan and Matt Moses,
two scoring midfielders, this
group can compensate with its
extensive creativity, its ball-win
ning capabilities, athleticism and
ability to keep ball possession.
The midfielders will be prima
rily responsible for creating op
portunities for the Cardinal's two
big scorers, Levesque and sopho
more Matt Janusz. Other key lor
wards on the squad include
sophomores Darren Fernandez,
James Twellman and Sean
Whalen. This group has been bit
ten by the injury bug the most
with Levesque, Janusz, and Fer
nandez all still recovering from
their ailments.
