# Young squad focuses on meeting goal

After losing five seniors, who as a group
boasted one All-American, two first team Pacific
-10 All-Conference, one Pac-10 All-Conference
Honorable Mention distinction, and three re
cent Major League Soccer draft picks, most
teams would be declaring the upcoming season
as a rebuilding one.
But for coach Bret Simon's men's soccer
squad, a NCAA title is closer to what the Cardi
nal wants to achieve.
Even with the loss of key players such as star
defender Lee Morrison, midfielder Derek
Shanahan and defender Aaron Biddle, Simon
believes that this year's team has all the potential
to be one of the top contenders in the nation.
I Jowever, he emphasizes how unpredictable the
game of soccer can be.
"In men's soccer, there's very little difference
between the top team and the 100 th team, so the
margin for error is very small," Simon said. "We
have a lot of potential, but we have a ways to go
to realize that full potential, and if we do, we'll
be one of the better teams in the country."
The preseason polls certainly think so, as
Stanford is at No. 2 behind 2001 national cham
pionship finalist Indiana. Pac-10 coaches have
also picked the Cardinal to repeat as Pac-10
champions.
Despite the return of five of Stanford's top six
scorers, Simon is worried about having an in
jury-plagued squad. Some players sustained in
juries and illnesses over the summer and a few
have been working to get back to full health
from last season.
