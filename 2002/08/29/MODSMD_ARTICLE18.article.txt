# Women kick off season
## 
### MATTHEW BABIN 
Much of the amazement about Team USA's
run to the semifinals of this summer's World
Cup was its success against European teams. An
astounding victory over Portugal and a thrilling
match against Germany showed that the Amer
icans had not only improved on their own game,
but could even match up against Europeans —
still the international measuring stick lor soccer.
The Stanford women's soccer team, looking
for some matches of its own, recently returned
from its own European tour with equally im
pressive results. The squad went 4-1 over the
tour, with an amazing 17-4 goal differential.
After winning their first four matches against
V.V. Braakhuizen (Dutch Champions), Een
dracht Aalst (Belgian Club Champions), Rapide
Wezemaal (Belgian National Champions) and
the Dutch National Team, a young lineup of
Stanford women fell to FCR Duisburg (German
Champions) in the final match of the tour.
The team adapted quickly to its foreign sur
roundings, taking its first game 6-0 against V.V.
Braakhuizen. Sophomore Amy Grady and jun
ior Brittany Oliveira each scored in the first half
before junior Marcie Ward exploded for two
goals of her own after the half.
The team then posted a shutout again Een
dracht Aalst, taking the match 4-0. The team's
veterans led the way in this one, as senior Mar
cia Wallis's 13th minute mark was followed by
two goals from Oliveira and one from senior
Kelsey Carlson.
The offense showed no signs of slowing
down against the Belgian National Champions,
finding the back of the net four times before the
half, with sophomore Natalie Sanderson notch

ing two goals in the first 15 minutes.
The Dutch National Team proved much
tougher competition than the Dutch Club
Champions, as the Cardinal had to battle
through its fourth game of the tour. After a
scoreless first half, the squad was able to sneak
off with the win on Oliveira's fourth goal of the
tour. That was was all that was needed as red
shirt sophomore keeper Nicole Barnhart held
the Dutch scoreless for the duration and gave
the Cardinal the 1-0 victory.
The fifth and final match of the tour unfor
tunately handed the Cardinal its first loss, a 3-1
defeat at the hands of FCR Duisberg. The Ger
man club team wasted no time getting started,
scoring in the first minute of play against a
young Stanford team on the pitch.
The successful trip to Europe picked up
right where the spring season left off, as the
Cardinal ran through its spring opposition with
relative ease. The spring campaign, which the
team finished with a 5-1 record, was also
marked with numerous shutouts (five) and an
exciting offensive display (14 goals scored) —
traits that are fast becoming hallmarks of this
year's team.
After such a dominant domestic spring sea
son, success in international competition only
confirms that this year's squad is looking to once
again field one of the top teams in women's col
legiate soccer.
It's a position that the team is used to, having
earned a spot in the NCAA postseason tourna
ment each of the past four years and 11 of the
past 12. The memory of last season still lingers,
when the team reached a national ranking of

Junior Brittany Oliveira notched four goals during
the Cardinal's European tour this summer, and will
look to continue her dominance on the field as
Stanford takes on Santa Clara tomorrow night.
No. 2 before they finished just one
goal shy of the Pac-10 title and
ended the season ranked No. 9 na
tionally, bowing out in the third
round of the championship tour
nament.
The success of last year, the

bumper crop of seven new fresh
man and the experience of five re
turning seniors with 299 games be
tween them have combined to
form a high level of preseason re
spect for the Cardinal. Early polls
tab them as No. 2 in the confer
ence, behind only last year's con
ference champion, the UCLA.
If predictions hold, however, the
conference will be as competitive as
ever. While the coaches' poll easily

placed UCLA and Stanford at the
top, just four points separated Wash
ington, Arizona State and California,
which rounded out the top five.
To be the best you have to beat
the best, and the Cardinal will
jump right into action with its first
game of the season tomorrow
night at Buck Shaw Stadium
against Santa Clara, the defending
national champions. The game
kicks off at 7:30 p.m.
