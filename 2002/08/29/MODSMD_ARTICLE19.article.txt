# Student athletes expand role
## 
### KENNETH GARRETT EDITORIAL STAFF 
There's a lot to being a Stanford
student-athlete. Most obvious Ls the
pain, the sweat, die blood and the time
spent in practice and competition.
And that's on top of the thankless bal
ancing act inherent in studying at a
top-notch school while competing as a
part of the world's premiere athletic
program. Of course, there's also those
tilings that make at least one Cardinal
fan wish he was 011 the field rather
than in the press lx>x — the cool
clothes, the great bodies and the glory
and sense of accomplishment that
come only from being the best.
Well, now there's even more, in
an effort both to ameliorate the first
set of characteristics and share the
second, the Cardinal Council is
preparing not only fora new year,
but fora totally new way of doing
things.
Known officially as the Stanford
Student Athlete Advisory Commit
tee (SAAC), the Cardinal Council is
not really known at all. Even the ath
letes know of it only as the group
that plans Athletes' Formal.
Created by an NCAA mandate in
1995, the Council is the athletes' of
ficial link to the Athletic Depart
ment. While membership in the
SAAC is a coveted honor at most
schools, Stanford athletes have seen
it as a chore that further diminishes
what little social life is left after class,
practice and sleep.
All that is set to change. Council
chairman Michael Bruce —a junior
on the swim team — and a group of
15 fellow athletes have spent the
summer formulating big plans that

will enhance the experience of
being both an athlete and a fan.
In addition to drafting new
membership guidelines and rewrit
ing the constitution in an effort to
make the Council more responsive
to whatever issues might arise, the
group has identified several projects
to tackle in the upcoming year.
"Each student athlete on the
Farm is standing on the shoulders of
years and years of alumni who have
made Stanford the home of cham
pions," Bruce said.
In order to honor that tradition
and inspire the current generation,
the Champion Speaker Series will
invite a former Stanford star to be
the guest of honor at a banquet. Ini
tially designed as an annual event,
the Council hopes to increase the
ties between past and present in
coming years by inviting more
alumni more often.
For those of us fans who are ei
ther too busy or too clueless to know
when the Cardinal will be stomping
its competition, the Gold Games
schedule will identify the biggest
home game for each team, and
hopes to offer some kind of induce
ment for attendance.
"The hype from the promotion
of these games will fill the stands
with enthusiastic fans when the Car
dinal needs them the most," Bruce
said. "It will send a message to the
student body that student athletes
neither want to nor can compete at
their best without the support of
their peers.'
Along with great privilege comes
great responsibility, and out of that
knowledge will be born the Varsity
Sports Clinics. Cardinal Council will

encourage each team to dedicate a
Saturday afternoon to teach Bay
Area youth the skills and knowledge
they liave gained through years of
practice and competition.
"The clinics will provide athletes
with an opportunity to give back to
the community by doing what they
do best," Bruce said.
If most Stanford students feel
they are too busy to support Sum
ford sports, athletes themselves find
time even more scarce. The Buddy
Teams program will pair each team
with another team that competes in
a different season. Teams will be en
couraged to organize barbecues, ex
change gear and actively support
their counterpart teams.
No great reform initiative would
be complete without the internet,
and Cardinal Council is no excep
tion. The Student Athlete Web site
will be an online community where
student-athletes can post upcoming
events as well as messages of good
luck and congratulations.
Primary among the issues facing
Cardinal Council aftercurrent plans
get off the ground is the subtle yet
growing antipathy between student
athletes and their non-athletic peers.
"It's an extremely important
concern for all student athletes,"
Bruce said. "We want our peers to
understand that, like them, we're
here to capitalize on our greatest
strengths while also doing our best
in the classroom. Cardinal Council
will do its best to open up lines of
communication and address these
problems."
Stanford student athletes hoe
their success 011 the field will trans
fer easily to this new endeavor.
