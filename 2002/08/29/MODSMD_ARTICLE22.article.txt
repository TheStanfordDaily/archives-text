"Eve" was graceful, clever and quick on its
toes. "French" turns the volume up and push
es the characters further, hut only ends up
being loud and abrasive.
The movie starts off nicely, at a beauty pag
eant so over-the-top it looks like it was inspired
by "Legally Blonde." Jane McGregor plays
Starla Grady, a head cheerleader who knows
how to shake her pom poms to get what she
wants — if you know what 1 mean.
Her parents (Brandon Smith and Julie
White) tell her that they have been contacted
by a French foreign exchange student who
would like to stay with them. Starla shrugs off
the suggestion, but uses it later when she's on
stage and asked her final question from the
judges. Her response prompts the entire audi
ence to erupt in applause. The last time a
crowd of extras were this enthusiastic was
when Russell Crowe won the Nobel Prize in"A

Beautiful Mind."
This is all setup for the entrance of
Genevieve (Piper Perabo), the French student
who stays with Starla. She's shy and timid at
first, until the school photographer (Trent
Ford) sees her, is smitten by her beauty and de
cides to devote an entire two-page spread to
her — aptly titled "All About Genevieve."
Such behavior doesn't exacdy qualify for eth
ical prudence in high school photojournalism,

but never mind. Genevieve starts to make
friends and steals the spotlight from under
Starla's toes. She even seduces Starla's boyfriend
(Matt Czuchry), the star quarterback whose eyes
starts drifting toward another pair of pom poms
on the field — if you know what I mean.
"All About Eve" worked because the screen
play from Joseph Mankiewicz knew how to
