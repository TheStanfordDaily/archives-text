"Eve" was graceful, clever and quick on its
toes. "French" turns the volume up and push
es the characters further, hut only ends up
being loud and abrasive.
The movie starts off nicely, at a beauty pag
eant so over-the-top it looks like it was inspired
by "Legally Blonde." Jane McGregor plays
Starla Grady, a head cheerleader who knows
how to shake her pom poms to get what she
wants — if you know what 1 mean.
Her parents (Brandon Smith and Julie
White) tell her that they have been contacted
by a French foreign exchange student who
would like to stay with them. Starla shrugs off
the suggestion, but uses it later when she's on
stage and asked her final question from the
judges. Her response prompts the entire audi
ence to erupt in applause. The last time a
crowd of extras were this enthusiastic was
when Russell Crowe won the Nobel Prize in"A

Beautiful Mind."
This is all setup for the entrance of
Genevieve (Piper Perabo), the French student
who stays with Starla. She's shy and timid at
first, until the school photographer (Trent
Ford) sees her, is smitten by her beauty and de
cides to devote an entire two-page spread to
her — aptly titled "All About Genevieve."
Such behavior doesn't exacdy qualify for eth
ical prudence in high school photojournalism,

but never mind. Genevieve starts to make
friends and steals the spotlight from under
Starla's toes. She even seduces Starla's boyfriend
(Matt Czuchry), the star quarterback whose eyes
starts drifting toward another pair of pom poms
on the field — if you know what I mean.
"All About Eve" worked because the screen
play from Joseph Mankiewicz knew how to

handle the budding rivalry between
egocentric actress Margo Channing
(Bette Davis) and her ambitious as
sistant Eve Harrington (Anne Bax
ter).
In "Slap Her . . . She's French,"
the performances are handled well.
McGregor, in the Davis role, is confi

dent and charismatic; she delivers
her lines with the same sense of ex
aggerated detachment that made
Reese Witherspoon a star.
Perabo, in more or less the Baxter
role, has the difficult job of undergo
ing several drastic character rever
sals, including one where she dis
cards hei" bookish appearance fora
short cheerleading skirt and a spot in
front of the squad. It's a testament to
her performance that Genevieve suc
ceeds as a credible villain — and Per-

Abo approaches the French accent
with a warm playfulness.
But neither actress is strong
enough to completely overcome
the material, which veers into the
not-so-spectacular territory of re
cent teen comedies like "Boys and
Girls" and "Whatever it Takes."
Much of the action, which is set in
side the walls of Splendona High
School, is disruptive and juvenile.
The screenplay by Lamar Damon
and Robert Lee King prefers to

aim for cheap laughs, instead of
the ones that require skill, wit and
the proper timing.
For instance, there's a thankless
role for Michael McKean as Mon
sieur Duke, the French teacher who
threatens to fail Starla because her
grade has dipped so low. The
humor also dips low; Monsieur
Duke spends less time thinking
about verb conjugations than the
size of Starla's pom poms —if you
know what I mean.

"Slap Her... She's French" is di
rected by Melanie Mayron, whose
last film "The Baby-Sitters Club"
(1995) was warm and cheery. It was
released before the era of Britney
Spears, when material targeted to
ward young girls taught them how
to feel good about themselves with
out dancing topless in front of a
hooting crowd. "French" may speak
the common language of promoting
smut over substance, but it never
translates into anything dignified.
