# Perabo pipes in about her film career
## 
### RAMIN SETOODEH EDITORIAL STAFF 
Piper Perabo is cheerful and enthusiastic
about her work. At the age of 24, she's also
become one of the most promising actresses
of her generation.
I interviewed her at the Four Seasons in
San Francisco earlier this month, when she
was promoting her next film "Slap Her...
She's French."
I started our conversation: "I saw your
movie, and..."
I was interrupted.
"You did!" She was genuinely, pleased.
"Thank you."
Not the typical response from a Holly
wood actress. But then again, Piper Perabo is
not typical Hollywood.
She studied acting at Ohio University
with aspirations of becoming a theater ac
tress. She must have been good, because she
graduated at the top of her class, summa

cum laude, in 1998. From there, she went to
New York — and auditioned for all sorts of
parts, including TV commercials. She hit the
jackpot when she was cast as the lead in"The
Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle." Then
came "Coyote Ugly," where she played Vio
let Sanford — a young woman who wants to
be a singer/songwriter and goes to the Big
Apple with those dreams. The movie was
one of the surprise hits in the summer of
2000; and ever since, the film roles have
been coming steadily.
Her latest performance in "Slap 1 ler...
She's French" is not her strongest work, l'er
abo stars as Genevieve LaPlouff, a French
foreign exchange student who comes to the
United States and begins to terrorize the
most popular girl in school (Jane McGre
gor). It's basically a remake of the 1950 clas
sic "All About Eve," with Perabo in the Anne
Baxter role.

DOWN WITH PIPER: The 24 year old
actress talks about her role in "Coyote Ugly."
She discussed what attracted
her to the film.
"I've been wanting to play a vil
lain for quite some time and just
wasn't being considered for the
parts because I had been playing
the goody two-shoes up until
then," she said. "So when this proj
ect came along and they asked me
to play the villain, I snatched it
right up."
That's understandable. In the
film, Perabo has some fun with her
playful French accent.
"I studied French in college and
just before this movie I had been
making a movie in Quebec with a
Swiss French woman and we had
been speaking a lot of French on
the set. The accent was different,
but it wasn't that far to go as start
ing from scratch."
Did you study "All About Eve" to
prepare for the role? I asked.
"I did watch it a number of times.
But I don't want to make too strict a
comparison because it is one of the
great classical films. 1 watched a lot
of [Baxter's] mannerisms and sort
of what makes her seem unsettling.
There are some small things she
does were she'll be standing and
watching a room work.
"I actually hadn't seen it before.
I'm not really that much of a film
buff, although I should be. In the
last few years, I've been watching
the great films. I always intended
to do theater."
But things didn't work out that
way?
"The week I graduated from
Ohio University I moved to New
York and got a waitressing job and
was just going on every and any
audition I could get — regardless
of the medium. And the first job I
booked was in film."
That movie was "Whiteboys"
(1999), a limited release from Fox
Searchlight. Perabo played Sara,
the girlfriend of the hero (Danny

Hoch) — who wanted to be a rap
per, but couldn't because of the
color of his skin.
Then came the call that most
struggling actresses dream of get
ting. She was cast for the lead role
in"The Adventures of Rocky &
Bullwinkle" (2000) — a live action
remake of the popular cartoon se
ries with a large budget and a cast
that included Robert DeNiro,
Jason Alexander and Rene Russo.
"1 was on my way to an audition
when 1 found out that I got the
part," she said. "I was on my way
actually to a pesticide audition,
which was horrible because I'm a
vegetarian and was having all these
moral qualms about whether I
could actually do a pesticide com
mercial.
"My pager went off and I was in
Penn station and I got on the pay
phone and my manager was like
screaming, 'You got the job.' Audit
was so strange that I was by myself .
I started crying and the guy at the
newspaper stand next to the
phone came up to me and said,
Are you okay?' and 1 said, 'Yeah,
I'm crying because I'm happy,' and
he said, Are you getting married?'
It's so New York — these strange
people who kind of care and who
are kind of crazy."
Perabo played Karen Sympathy,
a FBI agent who is called upon to
save Rocky and Bullwinkle from
the forces of evil. The role earned
Perabo some great reviews, espe
cially from film critic Roger Ebert
who wrote: "She has fine comedic
timing and is so fetching, she sort
of stops the clock... and becomes a
star right there before my eyes."
Was it not hard, I asked, reacting
to the Rocky and Bullwinkle char
acters — who were added in later
as computer-generated images.
"It was a lot about movement,
about remembering the weight of
people — how heavy someone's
hand is when you shake it, for ex
ample. At the beginning, it was re
ally hard for me to see where their
eye lines were — to be always able
to look at the same spot. So they

would hang like small nuts and
bolts in the air, and they would take
them out later."
One week after production
ended, she was cast in the lead role
of "Coyote Ugly" (2000). The film
had several inspired dance se
quences on the countertops of a
bar in which Perabo's character
works — and was a hit at the box
office.
"I was really pleased with how
many young women, young
teenage girls, liked it. Because
for me, what was so important
about the story was that it was
about a young woman who did
n't put her dreams on the back
burner. Kids know what they're
going to be successful at and they
should be encouraged in those
instinctual callings."
Her strongest performance to
date, however, has been in the
movie "Lost and Delirious" — one
of the best movies of last year. The
film, which played at Sundance,
features Perabo as a rebellious
teenager at a girl's boarding school
who shares a love affair with one of
her classmates (Jessica Pare).
"I do a lot of prep on my own
before I begin a movie," she said.
"For me, 'Lost and Delirious' is
the closest I've ever come to the
ideal that I set before starting the
movie. It's the closest I've come to
creating the original thing I want
ed to create."
What she does create is an in
credibly complex character, who
quotes Shakespeare in one scene
with an intensity that few actresses
can match. We talked about her
college education, and how that
helped with the role.
"I think it can't be stressed how
important college has been to me
and how important it is always.
You can't rely on inspiration all
the time. You have to have a well
formed craft and process. And
also, as a young person, because
you haven't had a lot of time, you
don't have loads of life experi
ence. So I think the more that
you've read and studied history

and literature and art, the fuller
your scope of life is and your
characters are going to be more
interesting."
Do you read your own reviews?
"No, actually 1 don't."
Never?
She shook her head. 1 told her
that Roger Ebert had written ex
traordinary things about her —
comparing her to accomplished ac
tresses like Julia Roberts and
Renee Zellweger.
She smiled.
"1 met him at Sundance and
he's so nice. 1 didn't recognize him
at first because he's shorter than 1
imagined and so 1 looked at him
and thought that he looked famil
iar and I realized who he was and
sort of went crazy. I've seen his
show so many times as a kid — 1
don't know why 1 freaked out
when 1 met him but I did."
In addition to "French," Perabo
has three more films she's complet
ed that are awaiting release. The
most promising is called "The I In
side," from German director
Roland Suso Richter.
"It's a thriller with Ryan
Phillippe and I play his wife so it's a
really good cast. I think it's going to

be a really good movie."
Can you tell?
"Sometimes you can tell. You
usually shoot really out of se
quence. But because of the location
[in Wales], we shot more in se
quence. It was more of a play in the
sense that you prepare it more in
order. You get a better sense of how
it's going to be."
Then we discuss the punctua
tion in the title of "Slap Her .. .
She's French." The posters and
press material use ellipses. But
some Internet databases have sep
arated the two clauses with a
comma ("Slap Her, She's French").
"That's so terrible that they
haven't made their decision on
their punctuation," she said. "I'm
guessing really it's a comma."
Doesn't it work either way?
"I guess so. But it should be a
comma, because there's not a peri
od at the end. I've been out of school
a little while. Are you still at school?"
Yes.
"See. That's why you noticed
the punctuation in your question
ing." She laughed. "It should be a
comma. I find that really amusing.
No one has asked me about that. I
think it's reallv astute."

was promoting her next film "Slap Her...
She's French."
I started our conversation: "I saw your
movie, and..."
I was interrupted.
"You did!" She was genuinely, pleased.
"Thank you."
Not the typical response from a Holly
wood actress. But then again, Piper Perabo is
not typical Hollywood.
She studied acting at Ohio University
with aspirations of becoming a theater ac
tress. She must have been good, because she
graduated at the top of her class, summa

cum laude, in 1998. From there, she went to
New York — and auditioned for all sorts of
parts, including TV commercials. She hit the
jackpot when she was cast as the lead in"The
Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle." Then
came "Coyote Ugly," where she played Vio
let Sanford — a young woman who wants to
be a singer/songwriter and goes to the Big
Apple with those dreams. The movie was
one of the surprise hits in the summer of
2000; and ever since, the film roles have
been coming steadily.
Her latest performance in "Slap 1 ler...
She's French" is not her strongest work, l'er
abo stars as Genevieve LaPlouff, a French
foreign exchange student who comes to the
United States and begins to terrorize the
most popular girl in school (Jane McGre
gor). It's basically a remake of the 1950 clas
sic "All About Eve," with Perabo in the Anne
Baxter role.

DOWN WITH PIPER: The 24 year old
actress talks about her role in "Coyote Ugly."
She discussed what attracted
her to the film.
"I've been wanting to play a vil
lain for quite some time and just
wasn't being considered for the
parts because I had been playing
the goody two-shoes up until
then," she said. "So when this proj
ect came along and they asked me
to play the villain, I snatched it
right up."
That's understandable. In the
film, Perabo has some fun with her
playful French accent.
"I studied French in college and
just before this movie I had been
making a movie in Quebec with a
Swiss French woman and we had
been speaking a lot of French on
the set. The accent was different,
but it wasn't that far to go as start
ing from scratch."
Did you study "All About Eve" to
prepare for the role? I asked.
"I did watch it a number of times.
But I don't want to make too strict a
comparison because it is one of the
great classical films. 1 watched a lot
of [Baxter's] mannerisms and sort
of what makes her seem unsettling.
There are some small things she
does were she'll be standing and
watching a room work.
"I actually hadn't seen it before.
I'm not really that much of a film
buff, although I should be. In the
last few years, I've been watching
the great films. I always intended
to do theater."
But things didn't work out that
way?
"The week I graduated from
Ohio University I moved to New
York and got a waitressing job and
was just going on every and any
audition I could get — regardless
of the medium. And the first job I
booked was in film."
That movie was "Whiteboys"
(1999), a limited release from Fox
Searchlight. Perabo played Sara,
the girlfriend of the hero (Danny

Hoch) — who wanted to be a rap
per, but couldn't because of the
color of his skin.
Then came the call that most
struggling actresses dream of get
ting. She was cast for the lead role
in"The Adventures of Rocky &
Bullwinkle" (2000) — a live action
remake of the popular cartoon se
ries with a large budget and a cast
that included Robert DeNiro,
Jason Alexander and Rene Russo.
"1 was on my way to an audition
when 1 found out that I got the
part," she said. "I was on my way
actually to a pesticide audition,
which was horrible because I'm a
vegetarian and was having all these
moral qualms about whether I
could actually do a pesticide com
mercial.
"My pager went off and I was in
Penn station and I got on the pay
phone and my manager was like
screaming, 'You got the job.' Audit
was so strange that I was by myself .
I started crying and the guy at the
newspaper stand next to the
phone came up to me and said,
Are you okay?' and 1 said, 'Yeah,
I'm crying because I'm happy,' and
he said, Are you getting married?'
It's so New York — these strange
people who kind of care and who
are kind of crazy."
Perabo played Karen Sympathy,
a FBI agent who is called upon to
save Rocky and Bullwinkle from
the forces of evil. The role earned
Perabo some great reviews, espe
cially from film critic Roger Ebert
who wrote: "She has fine comedic
timing and is so fetching, she sort
of stops the clock... and becomes a
star right there before my eyes."
Was it not hard, I asked, reacting
to the Rocky and Bullwinkle char
acters — who were added in later
as computer-generated images.
"It was a lot about movement,
about remembering the weight of
people — how heavy someone's
hand is when you shake it, for ex
ample. At the beginning, it was re
ally hard for me to see where their
eye lines were — to be always able
to look at the same spot. So they

would hang like small nuts and
bolts in the air, and they would take
them out later."
One week after production
ended, she was cast in the lead role
of "Coyote Ugly" (2000). The film
had several inspired dance se
quences on the countertops of a
bar in which Perabo's character
works — and was a hit at the box
office.
"I was really pleased with how
many young women, young
teenage girls, liked it. Because
for me, what was so important
about the story was that it was
about a young woman who did
n't put her dreams on the back
burner. Kids know what they're
going to be successful at and they
should be encouraged in those
instinctual callings."
Her strongest performance to
date, however, has been in the
movie "Lost and Delirious" — one
of the best movies of last year. The
film, which played at Sundance,
features Perabo as a rebellious
teenager at a girl's boarding school
who shares a love affair with one of
her classmates (Jessica Pare).
"I do a lot of prep on my own
before I begin a movie," she said.
"For me, 'Lost and Delirious' is
the closest I've ever come to the
ideal that I set before starting the
movie. It's the closest I've come to
creating the original thing I want
ed to create."
What she does create is an in
credibly complex character, who
quotes Shakespeare in one scene
with an intensity that few actresses
can match. We talked about her
college education, and how that
helped with the role.
"I think it can't be stressed how
important college has been to me
and how important it is always.
You can't rely on inspiration all
the time. You have to have a well
formed craft and process. And
also, as a young person, because
you haven't had a lot of time, you
don't have loads of life experi
ence. So I think the more that
you've read and studied history

and literature and art, the fuller
your scope of life is and your
characters are going to be more
interesting."
Do you read your own reviews?
"No, actually 1 don't."
Never?
She shook her head. 1 told her
that Roger Ebert had written ex
traordinary things about her —
comparing her to accomplished ac
tresses like Julia Roberts and
Renee Zellweger.
She smiled.
"1 met him at Sundance and
he's so nice. 1 didn't recognize him
at first because he's shorter than 1
imagined and so 1 looked at him
and thought that he looked famil
iar and I realized who he was and
sort of went crazy. I've seen his
show so many times as a kid — 1
don't know why 1 freaked out
when 1 met him but I did."
In addition to "French," Perabo
has three more films she's complet
ed that are awaiting release. The
most promising is called "The I In
side," from German director
Roland Suso Richter.
"It's a thriller with Ryan
Phillippe and I play his wife so it's a
really good cast. I think it's going to

be a really good movie."
Can you tell?
"Sometimes you can tell. You
usually shoot really out of se
quence. But because of the location
[in Wales], we shot more in se
quence. It was more of a play in the
sense that you prepare it more in
order. You get a better sense of how
it's going to be."
Then we discuss the punctua
tion in the title of "Slap Her .. .
She's French." The posters and
press material use ellipses. But
some Internet databases have sep
arated the two clauses with a
comma ("Slap Her, She's French").
"That's so terrible that they
haven't made their decision on
their punctuation," she said. "I'm
guessing really it's a comma."
Doesn't it work either way?
"I guess so. But it should be a
comma, because there's not a peri
od at the end. I've been out of school
a little while. Are you still at school?"
Yes.
"See. That's why you noticed
the punctuation in your question
ing." She laughed. "It should be a
comma. I find that really amusing.
No one has asked me about that. I
think it's reallv astute."

wood actress. But then again, Piper Perabo is
not typical Hollywood.
She studied acting at Ohio University
with aspirations of becoming a theater ac
tress. She must have been good, because she
graduated at the top of her class, summa

cum laude, in 1998. From there, she went to
New York — and auditioned for all sorts of
parts, including TV commercials. She hit the
jackpot when she was cast as the lead in"The
Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle." Then
came "Coyote Ugly," where she played Vio
let Sanford — a young woman who wants to
be a singer/songwriter and goes to the Big
Apple with those dreams. The movie was
one of the surprise hits in the summer of
2000; and ever since, the film roles have
been coming steadily.
Her latest performance in "Slap 1 ler...
She's French" is not her strongest work, l'er
abo stars as Genevieve LaPlouff, a French
foreign exchange student who comes to the
United States and begins to terrorize the
most popular girl in school (Jane McGre
gor). It's basically a remake of the 1950 clas
sic "All About Eve," with Perabo in the Anne
Baxter role.

DOWN WITH PIPER: The 24 year old
actress talks about her role in "Coyote Ugly."
She discussed what attracted
her to the film.
"I've been wanting to play a vil
lain for quite some time and just
wasn't being considered for the
parts because I had been playing
the goody two-shoes up until
then," she said. "So when this proj
ect came along and they asked me
to play the villain, I snatched it
right up."
That's understandable. In the
film, Perabo has some fun with her
playful French accent.
"I studied French in college and
just before this movie I had been
making a movie in Quebec with a
Swiss French woman and we had
been speaking a lot of French on
the set. The accent was different,
but it wasn't that far to go as start
ing from scratch."
Did you study "All About Eve" to
prepare for the role? I asked.
"I did watch it a number of times.
But I don't want to make too strict a
comparison because it is one of the
great classical films. 1 watched a lot
of [Baxter's] mannerisms and sort
of what makes her seem unsettling.
There are some small things she
does were she'll be standing and
watching a room work.
"I actually hadn't seen it before.
I'm not really that much of a film
buff, although I should be. In the
last few years, I've been watching
the great films. I always intended
to do theater."
But things didn't work out that
way?
"The week I graduated from
Ohio University I moved to New
York and got a waitressing job and
was just going on every and any
audition I could get — regardless
of the medium. And the first job I
booked was in film."
That movie was "Whiteboys"
(1999), a limited release from Fox
Searchlight. Perabo played Sara,
the girlfriend of the hero (Danny

Hoch) — who wanted to be a rap
per, but couldn't because of the
color of his skin.
Then came the call that most
struggling actresses dream of get
ting. She was cast for the lead role
in"The Adventures of Rocky &
Bullwinkle" (2000) — a live action
remake of the popular cartoon se
ries with a large budget and a cast
that included Robert DeNiro,
Jason Alexander and Rene Russo.
"1 was on my way to an audition
when 1 found out that I got the
part," she said. "I was on my way
actually to a pesticide audition,
which was horrible because I'm a
vegetarian and was having all these
moral qualms about whether I
could actually do a pesticide com
mercial.
"My pager went off and I was in
Penn station and I got on the pay
phone and my manager was like
screaming, 'You got the job.' Audit
was so strange that I was by myself .
I started crying and the guy at the
newspaper stand next to the
phone came up to me and said,
Are you okay?' and 1 said, 'Yeah,
I'm crying because I'm happy,' and
he said, Are you getting married?'
It's so New York — these strange
people who kind of care and who
are kind of crazy."
Perabo played Karen Sympathy,
a FBI agent who is called upon to
save Rocky and Bullwinkle from
the forces of evil. The role earned
Perabo some great reviews, espe
cially from film critic Roger Ebert
who wrote: "She has fine comedic
timing and is so fetching, she sort
of stops the clock... and becomes a
star right there before my eyes."
Was it not hard, I asked, reacting
to the Rocky and Bullwinkle char
acters — who were added in later
as computer-generated images.
"It was a lot about movement,
about remembering the weight of
people — how heavy someone's
hand is when you shake it, for ex
ample. At the beginning, it was re
ally hard for me to see where their
eye lines were — to be always able
to look at the same spot. So they

would hang like small nuts and
bolts in the air, and they would take
them out later."
One week after production
ended, she was cast in the lead role
of "Coyote Ugly" (2000). The film
had several inspired dance se
quences on the countertops of a
bar in which Perabo's character
works — and was a hit at the box
office.
"I was really pleased with how
many young women, young
teenage girls, liked it. Because
for me, what was so important
about the story was that it was
about a young woman who did
n't put her dreams on the back
burner. Kids know what they're
going to be successful at and they
should be encouraged in those
instinctual callings."
Her strongest performance to
date, however, has been in the
movie "Lost and Delirious" — one
of the best movies of last year. The
film, which played at Sundance,
features Perabo as a rebellious
teenager at a girl's boarding school
who shares a love affair with one of
her classmates (Jessica Pare).
"I do a lot of prep on my own
before I begin a movie," she said.
"For me, 'Lost and Delirious' is
the closest I've ever come to the
ideal that I set before starting the
movie. It's the closest I've come to
creating the original thing I want
ed to create."
What she does create is an in
credibly complex character, who
quotes Shakespeare in one scene
with an intensity that few actresses
can match. We talked about her
college education, and how that
helped with the role.
"I think it can't be stressed how
important college has been to me
and how important it is always.
You can't rely on inspiration all
the time. You have to have a well
formed craft and process. And
also, as a young person, because
you haven't had a lot of time, you
don't have loads of life experi
ence. So I think the more that
you've read and studied history

and literature and art, the fuller
your scope of life is and your
characters are going to be more
interesting."
Do you read your own reviews?
"No, actually 1 don't."
Never?
She shook her head. 1 told her
that Roger Ebert had written ex
traordinary things about her —
comparing her to accomplished ac
tresses like Julia Roberts and
Renee Zellweger.
She smiled.
"1 met him at Sundance and
he's so nice. 1 didn't recognize him
at first because he's shorter than 1
imagined and so 1 looked at him
and thought that he looked famil
iar and I realized who he was and
sort of went crazy. I've seen his
show so many times as a kid — 1
don't know why 1 freaked out
when 1 met him but I did."
In addition to "French," Perabo
has three more films she's complet
ed that are awaiting release. The
most promising is called "The I In
side," from German director
Roland Suso Richter.
"It's a thriller with Ryan
Phillippe and I play his wife so it's a
really good cast. I think it's going to

be a really good movie."
Can you tell?
"Sometimes you can tell. You
usually shoot really out of se
quence. But because of the location
[in Wales], we shot more in se
quence. It was more of a play in the
sense that you prepare it more in
order. You get a better sense of how
it's going to be."
Then we discuss the punctua
tion in the title of "Slap Her .. .
She's French." The posters and
press material use ellipses. But
some Internet databases have sep
arated the two clauses with a
comma ("Slap Her, She's French").
"That's so terrible that they
haven't made their decision on
their punctuation," she said. "I'm
guessing really it's a comma."
Doesn't it work either way?
"I guess so. But it should be a
comma, because there's not a peri
od at the end. I've been out of school
a little while. Are you still at school?"
Yes.
"See. That's why you noticed
the punctuation in your question
ing." She laughed. "It should be a
comma. I find that really amusing.
No one has asked me about that. I
think it's reallv astute."
