# Perabo pipes in about her film career
## 
### RAMIN SETOODEH EDITORIAL STAFF 
Piper Perabo is cheerful and enthusiastic
about her work. At the age of 24, she's also
become one of the most promising actresses
of her generation.
I interviewed her at the Four Seasons in
San Francisco earlier this month, when she
was promoting her next film "Slap Her...
She's French."
I started our conversation: "I saw your
movie, and..."
I was interrupted.
"You did!" She was genuinely, pleased.
"Thank you."
Not the typical response from a Holly
wood actress. But then again, Piper Perabo is
not typical Hollywood.
She studied acting at Ohio University
with aspirations of becoming a theater ac
tress. She must have been good, because she
graduated at the top of her class, summa

cum laude, in 1998. From there, she went to
New York — and auditioned for all sorts of
parts, including TV commercials. She hit the
jackpot when she was cast as the lead in"The
Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle." Then
came "Coyote Ugly," where she played Vio
let Sanford — a young woman who wants to
be a singer/songwriter and goes to the Big
Apple with those dreams. The movie was
one of the surprise hits in the summer of
2000; and ever since, the film roles have
been coming steadily.
Her latest performance in "Slap 1 ler...
She's French" is not her strongest work, l'er
abo stars as Genevieve LaPlouff, a French
foreign exchange student who comes to the
United States and begins to terrorize the
most popular girl in school (Jane McGre
gor). It's basically a remake of the 1950 clas
sic "All About Eve," with Perabo in the Anne
Baxter role.
