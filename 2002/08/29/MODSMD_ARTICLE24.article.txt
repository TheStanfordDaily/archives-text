Signs
irkirC?
The subterranean style of spook
and-thrill director M. Night Shya
malan infects the screen with
muted wonder in his latest and most ambi
tious film yet.
The plot develops slowly, but with ad
mirable ease. Mel Gibson stars as Gra
ham Hess, a minister who loses his faith
after his wife is killed in a brutal car acci
dent. He puts the church behind him
and dwells, unemployed apparently, on a
farm near Philadelphia with his two chil
dren (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin)
and younger brother, Merrill (Joaquin
Phoenix).
They are all spooked one morning
when a series of enigmatic crop circles ap
pear in their fields. Perhaps, the characters
begin to believe, supernatural forces are at
play
"Signs" is intense, rich, mesmerizing
and it features one of the best horror
movie sequences of all time. Yet just
when it edges toward the brink of cine
matic magnificence, the pinnacle of ex
cellence that few movies reach, does it
stumble, tumble even, into a morass of
melodrama.
In other words, "Signs" is the antithesis
of "The Sixth Sense": The beginning sky
rockets into thriller territory while the end
fails in everything it tries to accomplish.

Blue Crush
irkirti
It could have been about "Bay
watch" bimbos on surfboards, but
"Blue Crush" is more thoughtful
than that.
The movie was directed by John
Stockwell, whose last film "crazy/beauti
ful" starred Kirsten Dunst as a troubled
high school student who falls in love with
Jay Hernandez. Stockwell has an ability
to portray teenagers as they really are: in
secure, awkward and full of doubt; his
films are the polar opposite of anything
starring Freddie Prinze Jr.
For most of the film, Anne Marie
(Kate Bosworth) is supposed to be
preparing fora big surfing tournament
called the Pipe Masters in Oahu, Hawaii,
where the waves carry so much weight
they have been known to kill surfers. But
instead, she falls in love with a NFL quar
terback named Matt (Matthew Davis),
who comes to the island and wants her to
give him surf lessons.
"Blue Crush" succeeds because the
story remains grounded and real, even
when some of the material pushes the lim
its of plausibility. Most films for teenagers
conclude at the big high school prom, and
almost everyone appears to be a contrived
caricature. In "Blue Crush," all the char
acters are treated as smart and sane, and
they react to problems as we expect they
would in real life.

Serving Sara
irtrtrti
It only takes 34 minutes for Elizabeth
Hurley to get nude in "Serving Sara."
OK, not totally nude, but close. In ret
rospect, it's not such a terrible thing. It's ac
tually quite shrewd. Director Reginald
Hudlin must have decided to capitalize on
Hurley's, um, assets.
"Serving Sara" tries to take full advan
tage of all its stars' respective talents.
Matthew Perry, as hardened New York
process server Joe Tyler, uses his impecca
ble comic timing occasionally to hilarious
effect, but more often to prop up the less
than-stellar screenplay. Cedric the Enter
tainer does his comedy routine that
worked so well on "The Original Kings of
Comedy." And Bruce Campbell, of "The
Evil Dead 2" and "Army of Darkness"
fame, tries his best to work with the mate
rial, despite the small role that he is given.
Perry's rivalry with fellow process serv
er (Vincent Pastore) isn't so much funny as
it is disturbing, especially considering how
much they actually harm each other. Joe
gets Ray frozen, shot and run over.
It's when the stars are brought together
that the movie really fails to shine. Instead
of putting a funny spin on the doubdessly
fit-for-comic-evisceration world of process
serving, Hudlin just serves us up a trio of
putzes. And Perry are constrained by jokes
that don't fly.

XXX
irititC?
A bald James Bond? Shave Pierce
Brosnan's head, and you certainly
don't get Xander Cage, the hero
played by Vin Diesel in an update of the
geriatric Bond franchise.
To get to the X-zone in "XXX," you
need more than just less hair. You need
to be buff, bad and refreshingly funny.
We don't mean droll. No, we'll leave that
to 007. We mean one-liners that best
Arnold Schwarzenegger's, comebacks
that don't spare the rod and delivery, de
livery, delivery.
The larger movie shares the business
oriented approach, for better and for
worse. What it lacks in an implausible plot,
it makes up in pure action-flick muscle.
One wouldn't expect any less from direc
tor Rob Cohen, whose "The Fast and the
Furious" also starred Diesel, though with
less successful results.
In "XXX," not only is Diesel's perform
ance swift and edgy, but those turned in by
his co-stars are no less accomplished. Asia
Argento plays Yelena, a female character
that comes off as stunning without sacrific
ing her intelligence. Samuel L. Jackson
does his turn as the straight shooter to
Xavier's loose-cannon behavior; he is like
M.was to Bond.
With "XXX," a lot of the payoff comes
down to the amount of excitement it tries
to generate. And it succeeds on that level.
