# 'City' sinks to the bottom of sea
## 
### RAMIN SETOODEH EDITORIAL STAFF 
"City by the Sea" is a heartless
police thriller with as much energy
as an old episode of "Columbo."
Robert DeNiro stars as Vincent
LaMarca, a police detective trying
to crack a murder case that is so
open-and-shut it could be solved
by Anna Nicole Smith. Frances Mc-
Dormand is his girlfriend, a
woman who lives downstairs and
shares her bed with him on occa
sion. And James Franco plays
DeNiro's son, who was once aban
doned and now walks the streets of
New York as a junkie.
At first glance, the casting seems
to hit the mark. But the material
does not. The movie is dull and llat
and without any pleasure. I was
bored.
The instrumental problem is with
the set up, which puts all the cards on
the table in the beginning. Joey
(Franco) is in the middle of a late
night drug purchase on Long Is

land, when ihe dealer pounces on
him — and he's forced to light back.
He kills his attacker, then dumps the
body and leaves the scene.
Not the wisest thing to do — for
Joey or the film. The screenplay by

Ken Hixon
chooses to re
veal the identi
ty of the killer
in the first
frame. Vince,
the DeNiro
character, is as
signed to the
case and has no
clue he's going

after his own son.
It's the classic cat-and-mouse
chase — only this time, the cat is let
out of the bag too soon. More melo
drama is forced upon the viewer
through three developments:
(1) We discover that Vince's fa
ther worked as a moving man who
decided to kidnap a child for ran
som. Hut things went wrong, and
