# Sass says her farewell to sweet summer fling
## 
### 
It's me, not you. I know you've
heard that one before, but it really
is me this time. Yes, Ms. Sass is
pulling the plug on our summer
romance and bidding you, her
faithful reader, adieu. But before I
move on, Roxy would like to im
part some words of wisdom from
the department of disassociation
because as a wise man told her, the
end of summer is the best time to
break up. (People are far less clingy
than in the winter.)
One of Roxy's favorite break
ups — that is, the one she finds
most frenetically amusing and is
most often involved in — is calling
it quits with the person you didn't
even realize you were dating.
Let's be honest; we've all been
there. You hook up with the hot
item at Sigma Chi's Saturday party,
and by Wednesday, random peo
ple are stopping you in White
Plaza to tell you how excited they
are for you and so-and-so. You stop
short of, "Sweet — that's her
name!" and assume some unchar
acteristically alert partygoer saw
you two together and jumped to
the wrong conclusion.
Until she shows up on your
doorstep with dinner and a movie
on Friday.
Or maybe he's that guy you've
always been friends with and now

find yourself hanging out with a
lot. You're enjoying his company,
thinking how great it is that you
can just be friends with a man.
Meanwhile, back at the ranch,
your clever cowboy is practically
beside himself enjoying the im
pending success of his slow saunter
into your heart.
No matter the approach, you
eventually find yourself faced with
romantic entanglement. Unable to
do the adult thing and straighten
your would-be future spouse out
then and there, you surrender to a
little more pseudo-relationship,
and wham — you have a break-up
on your hands.
Don't despair. Whether your
imaginary coupling came out of a
frat party or a faux friendship, the
bottom line is that you can't let it go
on. Of course, breaking up may
not be the most fun way to spend
your Friday dinner, but rest as
sured that having next week's new
flavor accuse you of philandering
(on account of having recently met
your "girlfriend") will be far less
fun.
That said, don't be a jerk. Re
frain from calling her delusional or
telling him it was just hooking up.
Swallow your pride and just treat it
