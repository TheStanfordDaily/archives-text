# Sass says her farewell to sweet summer fling
## 
### 
It's me, not you. I know you've
heard that one before, but it really
is me this time. Yes, Ms. Sass is
pulling the plug on our summer
romance and bidding you, her
faithful reader, adieu. But before I
move on, Roxy would like to im
part some words of wisdom from
the department of disassociation
because as a wise man told her, the
end of summer is the best time to
break up. (People are far less clingy
than in the winter.)
One of Roxy's favorite break
ups — that is, the one she finds
most frenetically amusing and is
most often involved in — is calling
it quits with the person you didn't
even realize you were dating.
Let's be honest; we've all been
there. You hook up with the hot
item at Sigma Chi's Saturday party,
and by Wednesday, random peo
ple are stopping you in White
Plaza to tell you how excited they
are for you and so-and-so. You stop
short of, "Sweet — that's her
name!" and assume some unchar
acteristically alert partygoer saw
you two together and jumped to
the wrong conclusion.
Until she shows up on your
doorstep with dinner and a movie
on Friday.
Or maybe he's that guy you've
always been friends with and now

find yourself hanging out with a
lot. You're enjoying his company,
thinking how great it is that you
can just be friends with a man.
Meanwhile, back at the ranch,
your clever cowboy is practically
beside himself enjoying the im
pending success of his slow saunter
into your heart.
No matter the approach, you
eventually find yourself faced with
romantic entanglement. Unable to
do the adult thing and straighten
your would-be future spouse out
then and there, you surrender to a
little more pseudo-relationship,
and wham — you have a break-up
on your hands.
Don't despair. Whether your
imaginary coupling came out of a
frat party or a faux friendship, the
bottom line is that you can't let it go
on. Of course, breaking up may
not be the most fun way to spend
your Friday dinner, but rest as
sured that having next week's new
flavor accuse you of philandering
(on account of having recently met
your "girlfriend") will be far less
fun.
That said, don't be a jerk. Re
frain from calling her delusional or
telling him it was just hooking up.
Swallow your pride and just treat it
like an actual break-up. You know
how it works: "You're great. This is
great. But I'm just not at that mo
ment in my life right now." The
discomfort of handling it the right
way is worth the continuing health
of your reputation.
In the preceding situation you
are in a hole, in this case you are in
a trench. You went to bed with a
prince, woke up with a frog and
decided to date said amphibian, a
likely beneficiary of circumstance.
This is the "it's you" break-up,
where you have to wriggle yourself
out of the grips of a person who is
a little crazy, likely enamored and
definitely annoying.
Your hook-up tracked you
down — damn that Stanford Who
— and in a moment of weakness
you agreed to make a public out

ing. You survived the movie, and
even managed to make small talk
through the gelato, but some
where near the end he caught you
off guard with a, "We should do
this again sometime," and you
nodded politely. You go out
again...and again. You've mis
played your hand and found your
self in a de facto relationship.
But ever the trooper, you hang
out a few times until he mentions
how wonderful you are for the
27th time, and you want to poke
out your left eye. Even then, you
think about suffering through, es
pecially when you think about the
alternatives out there. But don't,
because soon sitting alone in a dark
room will sound appealing com
pared to another dinner and a
movie night with him.
And while he is prostrate-on
the-ground in love with you, it
doesn't necessarily mean that you
should step on him. The longer
you let it the linger, the more your

partner will languish and the
worse you'll feel in the end. Rut, of
course you're not completely sell
less because, as convenient as Mr.
Right Now is, Mr. Right could be
waiting fora space on your dance
card.
When you finally work up the
courage to declare your independ
ence, feel free to recycle the, "It's
me, not you," line, but pay some
charity lip-service to the good parts
of him and your relationship —
whether you want to or not — be
fore you induct him into your illus
trious ex-boyfriend club.
When it comes to the college re
lationship, Ms. Sass has to be hon
est: I just don't have that much
sympathy for you. "That's a
smidge harsh," you're thinking,
but bear with me a moment.
It isn't that I don't value these
relationships, or that I think break
ing them up is easy. Quite the op
posite, in fact. The college relation
ship comes in a wide range of

shapes and sizes, but no matter the
variety, the best long-term fit is al
most always a break-up.
How could that be, Roxy?
Well, think about it. Do you really
want to meet the man or woman
you're meant to marry now, when
you're 20 and hanging out on the
Row with those people from
freshman year you still haven't
cut loose? Ha.
The senior boyfriend will break
up with his junior girlfriend —
that's a done deal — but the real
question is whether she'll realize
what a favor's he's doing them
both. After all, nothing says love
like the gift of an appropriately de
baucherous senior year.
And for the two that are both
graduating, but working on op
posite coasts, you'll find your way
back to each other when the time
is right. Just don't let the end of
your romance be the end of your
friendship. Unless, of course,
you're in one of those college rela

tionships for which your friends
took odds on both the hook-up
and the break-up at the same
time. In that case, call it a good
time and let it go.
So there you have it — Roxy's
parting look at the ins and outs of
the relationship, from hook-up to
break-up, and everything in be
tween. As summer comes to a
close and the school year looms
large on the horizon, promise
yourself now that you'll take some
time out fora little love, whether
you like it hot and sexy or sweet
and subtle.
And for that moment when you
arrive at the worst break-up of all
— the one where you're in love
but know it just can't be, for what
ever reason — remember that
every good marriage is built on at
least one wonderful lost love, rim
ing is everything, and heartbreak
builds character. You have three
weeks to ponder that. See you in
September.
It's me, not you. I know you've

frain from calling her delusional or
telling him it was just hooking up.
Swallow your pride and just treat it
like an actual break-up. You know
how it works: "You're great. This is
great. But I'm just not at that mo
ment in my life right now." The
discomfort of handling it the right
way is worth the continuing health
of your reputation.
In the preceding situation you
are in a hole, in this case you are in
a trench. You went to bed with a
prince, woke up with a frog and
decided to date said amphibian, a
likely beneficiary of circumstance.
This is the "it's you" break-up,
where you have to wriggle yourself
out of the grips of a person who is
a little crazy, likely enamored and
definitely annoying.
Your hook-up tracked you
down — damn that Stanford Who
— and in a moment of weakness
you agreed to make a public out

ing. You survived the movie, and
even managed to make small talk
through the gelato, but some
where near the end he caught you
off guard with a, "We should do
this again sometime," and you
nodded politely. You go out
again...and again. You've mis
played your hand and found your
self in a de facto relationship.
But ever the trooper, you hang
out a few times until he mentions
how wonderful you are for the
27th time, and you want to poke
out your left eye. Even then, you
think about suffering through, es
pecially when you think about the
alternatives out there. But don't,
because soon sitting alone in a dark
room will sound appealing com
pared to another dinner and a
movie night with him.
And while he is prostrate-on
the-ground in love with you, it
doesn't necessarily mean that you
should step on him. The longer
you let it the linger, the more your

partner will languish and the
worse you'll feel in the end. Rut, of
course you're not completely sell
less because, as convenient as Mr.
Right Now is, Mr. Right could be
waiting fora space on your dance
card.
When you finally work up the
courage to declare your independ
ence, feel free to recycle the, "It's
me, not you," line, but pay some
charity lip-service to the good parts
of him and your relationship —
whether you want to or not — be
fore you induct him into your illus
trious ex-boyfriend club.
When it comes to the college re
lationship, Ms. Sass has to be hon
est: I just don't have that much
sympathy for you. "That's a
smidge harsh," you're thinking,
but bear with me a moment.
It isn't that I don't value these
relationships, or that I think break
ing them up is easy. Quite the op
posite, in fact. The college relation
ship comes in a wide range of

shapes and sizes, but no matter the
variety, the best long-term fit is al
most always a break-up.
How could that be, Roxy?
Well, think about it. Do you really
want to meet the man or woman
you're meant to marry now, when
you're 20 and hanging out on the
Row with those people from
freshman year you still haven't
cut loose? Ha.
The senior boyfriend will break
up with his junior girlfriend —
that's a done deal — but the real
question is whether she'll realize
what a favor's he's doing them
both. After all, nothing says love
like the gift of an appropriately de
baucherous senior year.
And for the two that are both
graduating, but working on op
posite coasts, you'll find your way
back to each other when the time
is right. Just don't let the end of
your romance be the end of your
friendship. Unless, of course,
you're in one of those college rela

tionships for which your friends
took odds on both the hook-up
and the break-up at the same
time. In that case, call it a good
time and let it go.
So there you have it — Roxy's
parting look at the ins and outs of
the relationship, from hook-up to
break-up, and everything in be
tween. As summer comes to a
close and the school year looms
large on the horizon, promise
yourself now that you'll take some
time out fora little love, whether
you like it hot and sexy or sweet
and subtle.
And for that moment when you
arrive at the worst break-up of all
— the one where you're in love
but know it just can't be, for what
ever reason — remember that
every good marriage is built on at
least one wonderful lost love, rim
ing is everything, and heartbreak
builds character. You have three
weeks to ponder that. See you in
September.
It's me, not you. I know you've
heard that one before, but it really
is me this time. Yes, Ms. Sass is
pulling the plug on our summer
romance and bidding you, her
faithful reader, adieu. But before I
move on, Roxy would like to im
part some words of wisdom from
the department of disassociation
because as a wise man told her, the
end of summer is the best time to
break up. (People are far less clingy
than in the winter.)
One of Roxy's favorite break
ups — that is, the one she finds
most frenetically amusing and is
most often involved in — is calling
it quits with the person you didn't
even realize you were dating.
Let's be honest; we've all been
there. You hook up with the hot
item at Sigma Chi's Saturday party,
and by Wednesday, random peo
ple are stopping you in White
Plaza to tell you how excited they
are for you and so-and-so. You stop
short of, "Sweet — that's her
name!" and assume some unchar
acteristically alert partygoer saw
you two together and jumped to
the wrong conclusion.
Until she shows up on your
doorstep with dinner and a movie
on Friday.
Or maybe he's that guy you've
always been friends with and now

find yourself hanging out with a
lot. You're enjoying his company,
thinking how great it is that you
can just be friends with a man.
Meanwhile, back at the ranch,
your clever cowboy is practically
beside himself enjoying the im
pending success of his slow saunter
into your heart.
No matter the approach, you
eventually find yourself faced with
romantic entanglement. Unable to
do the adult thing and straighten
your would-be future spouse out
then and there, you surrender to a
little more pseudo-relationship,
and wham — you have a break-up
on your hands.
Don't despair. Whether your
imaginary coupling came out of a
frat party or a faux friendship, the
bottom line is that you can't let it go
on. Of course, breaking up may
not be the most fun way to spend
your Friday dinner, but rest as
sured that having next week's new
flavor accuse you of philandering
(on account of having recently met
your "girlfriend") will be far less
fun.
That said, don't be a jerk. Re
frain from calling her delusional or
