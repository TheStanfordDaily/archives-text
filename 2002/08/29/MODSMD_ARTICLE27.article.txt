# BIG BROTHER 3 Watch
## 
### 
Alas, the last weeks of summer
mark the end of our guilty-pleas
ure television viewing experience
with "Big Brother 3." In mid-Sep
tember, one final houseguest will
emerge the winner of the
$500,(')()() prize.
Jason won Head of House
hold last week and, in the tough
est decision of his life, nominated

Gerry and Amy for eviction. Tonight, we predict
Gerry will be evicted. It's guaranteed.
And now, here's our rundown on the remaining
players in the house and what shot each has at win
ning the top prize:
Lisa Donahu
Odds of winning: 1:3
Strengths: This bartender from Los Angeles has
been riding low since boyfriend Eric was booted out

of the house. Plus, she's made
friends on both sides of the fence.
Weaknesses: She's not exactly
the brightest bulb on the Christ
mas tree; she'll need to win one
more HoH to seal her win.
Roddy Mancuso
Odds of winning: 1:4
Strengths: A first-class
schmoozer, he knows how to get

people to do what he wants; he's survived two nom
inations lor eviction, an impressive achievement.

Weaknesses: Many of the other houseguests see
him as too smart. And if Danielle gets her way, he'll
be gone next week.
Jason Guy
Odds of winning: 1:5
Strengths: A self-proclaimed virgin from Mo
bile, Ala., he looks more innocent than the average
nun off the street. It's definitely an advantage in a
house full of schemers.
Weaknesses: The fact that he wasn't strong
enough to nominate Roddy for eviction shows that
he may not have the faith to win.
Danielle Reyes
Odds of winning, 1:10
Strengths: She gained favor with the other
houseguests through her sense of humor and a
laugh-out-loud impression of Halle Berry.
Weaknesses: She's also insulted every member
of the house behind their backs — that can't fare
well when the jury returns to vote.
Marcellas Reynolds

Odds of winning, 1:15
Strengths: After having the
worse first week of all time in "Big
Brother" history, he's managed to
stick around for the long haul.
Weaknesses: He's also loud and
rude; Amy may drag him down
with her.
Amy Crews.
Odds of winning, 1:20

Strengths: The cheese-loving Southern Belle
redefined the word comeback when she walked
out of the house, evicted 7-0, only to return two
weeks later.
Weaknesses: She did, after all, already lose the
game once. Will the other houseguests still be will
ing to give her the victory crow? Plus, her love of
the bottle has even alienated best friend Marcellas.
