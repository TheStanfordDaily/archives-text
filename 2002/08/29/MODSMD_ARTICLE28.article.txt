# Howie Day's album 'Australia' is a breathtaking debut
## 
### SERENA BLODGER STAFF WRITER 
Ifthe burgeoning pool of male singer/song
writers hitting the mainstream this year hasn't
suited your fancy, you might want to take a
look at Howie Day. Unlike John Mayer and
Jack Johnson, who compose catchy and laid
back "pretty-boy" tunes (and darn good ones
too), songs from Howie Day's Epic Records
debut, "Australia," are full of nothing but soul.
Although Howie Day first created a name
for himself with his technical performances,
his songwriting and vocal skills really put him
above others in the industry. His detailed,
emotional lyrics make it clear that this true
artist writes and sings for none other than
himself.
Consider the lyrics from "Secret," the

third track of the album. "Don't want to step
on the cracks/the feeling is we didn't/you got
the beamiest face/car turns left I'm into
you/taking sleepy pills for rest/anxious love
gets so obsessed." If Day was trying to score a
top-40 hit, he might have chosen more logi
cal phrasing, but thankfully he risks the fa
miliar and instead composes honest words
that are easy to enjoy.
Howie Day's vocals are another high point
of his debut album. He is not afraid to sing
with passion. He takes risks with vocal quality
and treats his voice as an instrument. Such
vocal creativity is most evident in the songs
"She Says"and "Slow Down." In both songs,
Day sings in almost every vocal register he pos
sesses, switching from an eerie falsetto to a
deep Gavin Rosdale-sound and back again
within seconds.

On top of vocals and songwriting, Day also
employs heavy use of layered tracks and ef
fects. In fact, Day initially gained acclaim based
on his energetic live performances where he
records guitar tracks and plays over them
using effects. Other than this, Day is just a guy
and his guitar.
It's a shame, however, that the first single
off "Australia" is "Ghost," the blandest song
on the album. The lyrics are fine, but the
tempo is moderate, the vocals sound neutral
and the special effects are minimal. No, the
song isn't bad. And perhaps if a listener had
n't heard any other song by Day, it might
catch his ear.
It's just a little hard to understand why
Day's management would choose "Ghost" to
be his first single when it hardly represents his
sound, and understates his skill and musical

appeal. lb say it plainly, "Ghost" sounds like it
could just as well be another John Mayer song,
which can be misleading to first-time listeners
since Day's sound is most often compared to
bands birthed during the Brit-pop invasion.
Overall, Howie Day's "Australia" is a
breath-taking debut. The album was pro
duced by Mike Denneen who has worked with
Aimee Mann, Guster and Letters to Geo. It
was first released in 2000, and won two Boston
Music Awards.
Day has said that it took him nearly a year
to record the album in what should have been
a typical six-week session. He could only af
ford Denneen and a studio for about five days
at a time, and then would then have to gig
around to earn more money. Sure enough, his
dedication paid off and Epic Records decided
to rerelease "Australia" this year.
