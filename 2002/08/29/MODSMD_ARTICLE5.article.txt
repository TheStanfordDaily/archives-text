## Extended orientation slows pace for newcomers

Red-shirted Stanford students dancing as
cars drive down Palm Drive. Dorm staff
members knowing their residents' names in
stantaneously. Freshman roommates meet
ing for the first time. Listening to the Presi
dent speak at Convocation. Dorm cheers in
Memorial Auditorium.
For years, each entering class at Stanford
has cherished these first experiences on the
Farm, all of which take place during New
Student Orientation. This year, 1,752 fresh
men and transfer students will take part in
NSO 2002 from Thursday, Sept. 19 to Tues
day, Sept. 24.
A marked difference in NSC) this year is
the expansion of the program to six days in
length, as opposed to the five-day program
that had been in place for the past few years.
"We were given a charge from the Presi
dent's Office to investigate the possibility of
increasing the length of NSO to allow new
students an easier transition into life at Stan
ford," said Director of New Student Orienta
tion Jared Scherer. "The result is an increase
in the number of days of orientation without
an increase in programming."
This year's schedule reduces the pressure
for students and parents to choose between
attending important events and investing
time in settling into the dorm. Students will
have more time in the residences on the first
day of orientation, and dinner on Thursday
night will not be the traditional advising din
ner, but simply dinner in the dorms followed
by the first house meeting of the year.

"We are very excited about the debut of
our Parent Resource Center as well," Scher
er said. "It's similar to an activities fair for
parents, where they can do one-stop shop
ping for information about Stanford."
The resource center will be located in
Tresidder Union's Oak Lounge and repre
sentatives from Financial Aid, the Registrar's
Office, Visitor Information Services, the
Stanford University Police Department and
other campus services will be available to an
swer question for parents and provide writ
ten information about the University.
Besides these significant changes, this
year's orientation a cappella fest will incor
porate other performing arts groups, like
Jam Pac'cl and Salsa!, for the first time. The
New Student Party, usually held in the
Tresidder Union Courtyard, will instead
move to the Frances Arrillaga Alumni Cen
ter to showcase an often-overlooked re
source on campus.
The orientation staff has been hard at
work since the beginning of spring quarter
to implement over 200 different events.
Scherer and Krista Zizzo, a program co
ordinator, are the staff supervisors for NSO.
This year, they are guiding orientation coor
dinators sophomore J. T. Batson, senior Jor
dan Connors, junior Trang Pham and se
nior Deborah Costa, head orientation coor
dinator. NSO 2002 also has a graduate stu
dent intern on staff for the first time â€”
Cindy Welle, a master's student at South
Dakota State University.
