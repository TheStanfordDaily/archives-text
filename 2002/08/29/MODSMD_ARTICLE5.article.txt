## Extended orientation slows pace for newcomers

Red-shirted Stanford students dancing as
cars drive down Palm Drive. Dorm staff
members knowing their residents' names in
stantaneously. Freshman roommates meet
ing for the first time. Listening to the Presi
dent speak at Convocation. Dorm cheers in
Memorial Auditorium.
For years, each entering class at Stanford
has cherished these first experiences on the
Farm, all of which take place during New
Student Orientation. This year, 1,752 fresh
men and transfer students will take part in
NSO 2002 from Thursday, Sept. 19 to Tues
day, Sept. 24.
A marked difference in NSC) this year is
the expansion of the program to six days in
length, as opposed to the five-day program
that had been in place for the past few years.
"We were given a charge from the Presi
dent's Office to investigate the possibility of
increasing the length of NSO to allow new
students an easier transition into life at Stan
ford," said Director of New Student Orienta
tion Jared Scherer. "The result is an increase
in the number of days of orientation without
an increase in programming."
This year's schedule reduces the pressure
for students and parents to choose between
attending important events and investing
time in settling into the dorm. Students will
have more time in the residences on the first
day of orientation, and dinner on Thursday
night will not be the traditional advising din
ner, but simply dinner in the dorms followed
by the first house meeting of the year.

"We are very excited about the debut of
our Parent Resource Center as well," Scher
er said. "It's similar to an activities fair for
parents, where they can do one-stop shop
ping for information about Stanford."
The resource center will be located in
Tresidder Union's Oak Lounge and repre
sentatives from Financial Aid, the Registrar's
Office, Visitor Information Services, the
Stanford University Police Department and
other campus services will be available to an
swer question for parents and provide writ
ten information about the University.
Besides these significant changes, this
year's orientation a cappella fest will incor
porate other performing arts groups, like
Jam Pac'cl and Salsa!, for the first time. The
New Student Party, usually held in the
Tresidder Union Courtyard, will instead
move to the Frances Arrillaga Alumni Cen
ter to showcase an often-overlooked re
source on campus.
The orientation staff has been hard at
work since the beginning of spring quarter
to implement over 200 different events.
Scherer and Krista Zizzo, a program co
ordinator, are the staff supervisors for NSO.
This year, they are guiding orientation coor
dinators sophomore J. T. Batson, senior Jor
dan Connors, junior Trang Pham and se
nior Deborah Costa, head orientation coor
dinator. NSO 2002 also has a graduate stu
dent intern on staff for the first time â€”
Cindy Welle, a master's student at South
Dakota State University.

designed to serve as a liaison be
tween NSC) and the Undergradu
ate Advising Center, whose acade
mic orientation events make up a
large percentage of the NSO
schedule.
"I was drawn to the position by
the comprehensive nature of Stan
ford's orientation schedule," Welle
said. "Here there is such a good
balance of social, academic, resi
dential and community center
programming.
"Also, I have been very im
pressed with the fact that NSO is
student-run at Stanford, which is
different from so many other in
stitutions."
At many universities, orienta
tion programs are run by profes
sional staff members, but not so at
Stanford.
"NSO is really a student-run
program," Scherer said. "Our stu
dent coordinators are in charge of
overseeing all aspects of their
events to fruition."

"Stanford really fosters student
leadership in large-scale university
events," Costa said. "Being an ori
entation coordinator is a unique
opportunity because we have so
much ownership over the events
we plan, along with the added sup
port of our supervisors."
As head orientation coordina
tor, Costa will be representing the
Stanford student body as she wel
comes new students and their par
ents during her student address at
the 112 th Opening Convocation.
Due to all the events students at
tend during orientation, many
Stanford students find their first
days on the Farm disorienting. To
help establish continuity between
events, the orientation staff has
chosen a theme "Kaleidoscope:
Finding Your Focus" for NSO
2002.
"We hope the theme will help
bring together the different facets
of Stanford and provide some con
text for the new student experi
ence," Costa said. "The theme will
be incorporated into the events cal
endar and our publications. It will
also be verbally communicated
during Convocation and involved

visually in many of our events."
As of August 1, 2002, NSO is
under the purview of Assistant
Vice Provost of Student Affairs and
Dean of Freshmen and Transfers
Julie Lythcott-Haims.
"I've always loved the way Stan
ford does orientation," Lythcott-
Haims said. "My fondest memories
of my time as a student here date
back to Orientation 1985, when I
was greeted by helpful, eager OVs
and effervescent RAs who knew
my name and where I was from."
"NSO is rich with introductions
to academic offerings, campus re
sources and support services, with a
healthy dose of Stanford traditions
and school spirit to round things
out. As a result, students feel their
arrival has been eagerly anticipated
and that this place will soon feel like
home, and parents leave feeling re
assured. Who wouldn't be proud to
be associated with such a well-orga
nized and terrific set of events?"
Along with Lythcott-Haims, the
NSO staff and 125 orientation vol
unteers are looking forward to wel
coming the Stanford family's
newest members with open arms
next month.
