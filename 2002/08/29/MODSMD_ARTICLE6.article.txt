# NUSIP oversees housing and "roommating"
## 
### JERRY LU STAFF WRITER 
They know your interests, your habits
and even what you look like. But it's doubt
ful that you've ever heard of them.
Every incoming freshman has dealt with
the New Undergraduate Student Informa
tion Project, the office responsible for col
lecting information from all first-year stu
dents before they arrive on campus.
The summer before freshman year, in
coming students are required to turn in a se
ries of forms detailing such things as sleep
ing preferences, academic interests, hobbies
and pet peeves.
"What we do is to get information out to
students, and get it back. For the first part of
summer, we're a correspondence office," ex
plained NUSIP Senior Coordinator Laura
Johnston, a double major in political science
and religious studies.
NUSIP collects and sorts the forms that
pour in throughout summer and repack
ages them for other offices around campus,
most notably the Undergraduate Advising
Center and New Student Orientation.

Once the mail slows to a trickle, the real
work begins for the NUSIP coordinators.
Included in the summer mailings are the
housing and roommate preference forms. It
is now the coordinator's job to balance hous
ing, and more importantly, to assign room
mates.
"August and September are spent doing
roommating, using information from the
housing forms. It's a long and involved
process, which is partially why we don't di
vulge your roommate's name before you ar
rive," Johnston remarked.
At the start of the housing process, the
Freshman and Sophomore College and
Structured Liberal Education first decide
who they want to pull out for their pro
grams.
Next, students requesting housing in one
of the four cross-cultural theme houses are
hand assigned according to the pre-set quo
tas. No more than half of each house may be
assigned based on their ethnicity alone.
The preferences for the remaining fresh
man are entered into a computer database.
