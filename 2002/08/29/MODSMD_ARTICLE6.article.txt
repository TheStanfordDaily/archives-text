# NUSIP oversees housing and "roommating"
## 
### JERRY LU STAFF WRITER 
They know your interests, your habits
and even what you look like. But it's doubt
ful that you've ever heard of them.
Every incoming freshman has dealt with
the New Undergraduate Student Informa
tion Project, the office responsible for col
lecting information from all first-year stu
dents before they arrive on campus.
The summer before freshman year, in
coming students are required to turn in a se
ries of forms detailing such things as sleep
ing preferences, academic interests, hobbies
and pet peeves.
"What we do is to get information out to
students, and get it back. For the first part of
summer, we're a correspondence office," ex
plained NUSIP Senior Coordinator Laura
Johnston, a double major in political science
and religious studies.
NUSIP collects and sorts the forms that
pour in throughout summer and repack
ages them for other offices around campus,
most notably the Undergraduate Advising
Center and New Student Orientation.

Once the mail slows to a trickle, the real
work begins for the NUSIP coordinators.
Included in the summer mailings are the
housing and roommate preference forms. It
is now the coordinator's job to balance hous
ing, and more importantly, to assign room
mates.
"August and September are spent doing
roommating, using information from the
housing forms. It's a long and involved
process, which is partially why we don't di
vulge your roommate's name before you ar
rive," Johnston remarked.
At the start of the housing process, the
Freshman and Sophomore College and
Structured Liberal Education first decide
who they want to pull out for their pro
grams.
Next, students requesting housing in one
of the four cross-cultural theme houses are
hand assigned according to the pre-set quo
tas. No more than half of each house may be
assigned based on their ethnicity alone.
The preferences for the remaining fresh
man are entered into a computer database.

Laura Johnston, senior coordinator of the New Undergraduate Student Information
Project, looks at mug shots while reviewing the file of an incoming freshman.
A special freshman draw program
then decides which dorm each stu
dent is assigned to. The work from
this point on is done entirely by
hand.
Although the draw program is
useful in making sure the maxi
mum number of students obtain
one of their top housing choices,
the NUSIP coordinators then
must examine the rosters and
make certain necessary changes.
At this stage, students may be
moved between dorms, although
always between the same type of
housing.
"We start balancing by mirror
ing the ethnicities to the average of
the incoming class. We always try
to match within five to ten per
cent," Johnston said.
Other information is also con
sidered. For example, any dorm
with international students must
house at least two. If possible, clus
ters of four to six people of the
same ethnicity may be placed in the
same dorm as well.
"The purpose of this is simply
because people have reported feel
ing isolated, and this way anybody

can find a group of similar ethnici
ty," Johnston explained.
The NUSIP coordinators next
consider the percentage of athletes
in any particular dorm. Once
again, the average in any dorm is
best matched to the average of the
incoming class. Athletes in the
same sport are separated into dif
ferent dorms.
The coordinators then turn
their attention towards three final
balancing acts. The percentage of
California students in one dorm is
limited to 50 percent, freshman
may not be assigned to the same
dorm as any siblings and no more
than three students from the same
high school may live together.
"We do the best to accommo
date all these considerations, al
though housing type is always most
important," Johnston informed.
Throwing a twist into the bal
ancing process are students who
make requests fora specific dorm.
"Usually this happens because
the student knows somebody else
in the dorm. If a person requests a
dorm, however, they probably
won't get it," Johnston revealed.
"The roommating process is
very long, arduous, and specific.
We get a lot of people asking us
how we paired them with their
freshman roommate, but there

never is any single answer. How we
get two people together is com
pletely specific to them."
Because of all the housing con
siderations, NUSIP cannot accom
modate specific requests.
All students assigned to a dorm
are separated into four stacks
based on sex and location (in/out of
state), and then, more or less at
random, a student's profile is cho
sen. The coordinators read this
profile, and then read through all
other profiles from the compli
mentary stack to make a match.
"We go through fast first, to see
if there are any perfect matches.
This does happen, although it's
pretty rare," Johnston said.
New to this year's roommate
forms are "sliding scale" responses,
which allow incoming freshman to
rank their habits on a 10-point
scale. In the past, the forms only
had a few arbitrary choices that
didn't allow for much description.
"What a person writes on their
form is important to for helping us
pair them off. We occasionally get
people who either don't write
enough, or write things just be
cause they assume nobody will
read it. But it's always in their in
terest to write as much as possible,"
said Johnston.
What is most important in pair

ing roommates is what the students
find important, and what activities
the students like. The coordinators
try not to pair students of the same
ethnicity in the same room, unless
both students specifically request
it.
"We always make sure there's a
few major differences between the
roommates. What we want is to
make things as diverse as possible,"
explained Johnston.
As with dorm selection, students
who make specific requests fora
roommate will be denied. Howev
er, the coordinators state that
other types of requests will be ac
commodated â€” up to a point.
"We get all sorts of individual
requests: Sexual orientation, astro
logical signs and one person even
requested that all lines in a room
had to be perpendicular," John
ston said.
"Roommates are always paired
so that they're alike in interests, but
not in habits, or alike in habits, but
not in interests. It comes down to
whether people are placed togeth
er to provide the best living
arrangements, or to provide the
best chances for friendship."
Related to NUSIP's main mis
sion of collecting information are
records that it accumulates regard
ing each incoming class in general.

Taken together, these records pro
vide a snapshot of the general com
position of the freshman class.
Of the incoming class, 12 per
cent are African American, 20 per
cent are Asian, two percent are Na
tive American, 13 percent are His
panic, six percent are international
students and 41 percent are white.
Males outnumbered females in
the entering class 52 percent to 48
percent.
Only 40 percent of students are
from California (split evenly be
tween the north and south), while
seven percent live overseas.
The student breakdown this
year reveals several trends in shift
ing campus demographics.
Compared to past years, the in
coming class is the most ethnically
diverse ever. In comparison, for
the Class of 2005, African Ameri
cans accounted for only 10 per
cent, and Hispanic students for 12
percent of the population. The
campus appears to have become
increasingly male, bucking nation
al averages.
Finally, the dominance of Stan
ford by Californian students is
gradually lessening. Last year, 44
percent of the students called the
Golden State their home, while
only five percent of students hailed
from overseas.
