# Stanford admissions ranked toughest
## 
### AUDREY HARRIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Princeton Review ranked
Stanford the "toughest school to
get into" in its recently published
"345 Best Colleges" guide.
The book, which is the coun
try's most popular college guide,
was released on August 19. It
ranks schools in 63 categories,
including biggest party schools,
happiest students and most stu
dious student body.
While 60 of the 63 lists in the
survey are based on student opin
ions, the toughest school to get
into category is based on informa
tion reported to The Princeton
Review by each college and uni
versity, according to Erik Olson,
one of the book's editors.
The guide uses data to com
pile an "Admissions Rating,"
which in turn informs the rank
ing of toughest school to get into.
Factors that go into this rating in
clude: the percentage of students
enrolled who come from out of
state, average standardized test
scores of admitted students, the
percentage of students attending
the school from the top ten per
cent of their high school class and
acceptance rate and yield (the
amount of students who chose to
enroll).
Other schools on the list in
clude: Princeton, Cooper Union,

Harvard, Yale, the United States
Airforce Academy, the United
States Military Academy, the
United States Naval Academy,
Brown University and Colombia
University.
Although representatives from
The Princeton Review call the
"toughest schools to get into" list
"absolutely empirical," Stanford
Dean of Admission and Financial
Aid Robin Mamlet expressed
doubts about its methodology.
"When one looks at hard data
only, Stanford is not as selective as
Harvard," she said.
Indeed, according to infor
mation provided in The Prince
ton Review school profiles, Har
vard has a lower acceptance rate
than Stanford (11 percent com
pared to Stanford's 13 percent),
higher yield (78 percent com
pared to Stanford's 67 percent),
higher percentage of students
who graduated in the top ten
percent of the class and a slight
ly higher range of student SAT
scores.
However, Olson insisted that
the survey's methodology holds
water: "It's culled from a common
data set. .. It's completely statisti
cally valid," he said.
Calculation questions aside,
Mamlet asserts that The Prince
ton Review may be missing the
point, since admission to Stanford
is not just about the numbers.

"1 think Stanford is particular
ly clear that numbers alone will
get no one in: it is always a combi
nation of things, and numbers
form simply the starting point."
The ranking also raises the con
cern that potential students will be
discouraged from applying.
"The admission staff will
work hard this year. . . to work
with students so that they do
not inappropriately decide it is
not even worth it to apply,"
Mamlet said.
Laura Johnston, senior coordi
nator of the New Student Infor
mation Project, has had the op
portunity to talk to many incom
ing students this summer about
how they made their college
choice.
"Many students have told me
why they came to Stanford, and
none of them have mentioned
The Princeton Review," she said.
"I think the number one rea
son [that they chose Stanford] is
that students loved the campus,
the environment and most [of all]
the people here."
Sophomore J. T. Batson would
have to agree with Johnston's as
sessment.
When asked why he thought
The Princeton Review ranked
Stanford the toughest school to
get into for new students, he mod
estly answered, "They all want to
come to school with me."
