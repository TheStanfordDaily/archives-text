# EPASA summer program mentors EPA youths
## Six students volunteer with underprivileged Ravenswood kids 
### TAMAR LANDO 
Amidst growing concerns over low per
formance rates in the Ravenswood City
School District, Stanford students conducted
a five-week mentorship program this sum
mer with children from East Palo Alto and
Menlo Park.
This summer, six Stanford students
served as East Palo Alto Stanford Academy
counselors fora group of 30 teens and
youths from the Ravenswood City School
District, which includes East Palo Alto and
the Belle Haven area of Menlo Park. The
summer program is two-tiered: students at
tend morning classes at Palo Alto Unified
School District's summer school and spend
the afternoon on the Stanford campus,
where they participate in elective classes,
workshops and discussion groups organized
by EPASA student counselors.
Ravenswood youth that enroll in EPASA
come from severely disadvantaged econom
ic backgrounds. The Ravenswood School
District, which serves students in grades K-8,
is among the poorest in San Mateo County.
Jesse Moya, program director for EPASA
at the Haas Center for Public Service, esti

mates that the academic level of EPASA
youth is on average a grade or two below
California norms, a problem exacerbated by
language differences in the classroom.
"Often the level of the coursework is
lower than it should be. There are lan
guage issues â€” a large percentage of the
students from the Ravenswood City School
District are second-language learners," ex
plained Moya.
The Ravenswood district has witnessed
dramatic demographic changes over the
past two decades. While in the mid-'Bos the
district was 80 percent black, today it is 75
percent Hispanic. 82 percent of students en
rolled in district schools speak a language
other than English at home.
Many students who start out in
Ravenswood schools are unable to complete
a high school education. Ravenswood
schools feed into the Sequoia Union High
School District. Only 36 percent of
Ravenswood students that entered Sequoia
high schools in the fall of 1997 graduated
four years later. While signaling a high
dropout rate, these figures may also be af
fected by patterns of high demographic
transience.
The lack of resources in the district is
linked to problems involving the kinds of
teachers the district is able to attract. Moya
says that many Ravenswood teachers arrive
at their jobs wit h little or no experience.
"It's especially difficult for newer teachers

to address all the challenges that exist within
these classrooms. It takes several years fora
teacher to be a high performing teacher."
Even where Ravenswood district schools
are able to offer the same compensation as
neighboring PAUSI) schools, teachers often
prefer PAUSI), where resources are better
and where the environment is more sup
portive.
"Teachers start off in low-income districts
and then when they have experience, they
go to a higher income district, where there's
not as many issues involved," Moya said.
One of Moya's goals for EI'ASA is to cre
ate an environment where students can gain
confidence in their academic abilities.
Alvaro Alvarez is a seventh grade student
at Willow Oaks Elementary and was enrolled
in the EPASA summer program. Alvarez is
the third member of his extended family to
participate in EPASA; both his sister and
cousin graduated from the program and
now attend Eastside College Preparatory
School, a private and competitive, tuition
free school.
In comparing Willow Oaks to Jordan
Middle School, a PAUSD school he attended
over the summer through EPASA, Alvarez
said, "I like science, but [at Willow] our
teachers didn't have the materials to do ex
periments. And in Jordan we did a lot of ex
periments, so I liked the science more in Jor
dan."
Alvarez found the instructors at Jordan

more responsive.
"It helped me out because in some things
that I didn't understand in my regular
school, in Jordan I asked questions and they
explained. In Willow they don't explain ex
actly what you need to know, they just tell
you part of the things."
Counselors for EPASA are recruited from
throughout the Stanford student body.
While Moya contends EPASA does not favor
any particular ethnicity among its appli
cants, this summer's group of counselors was
hardly representative of the Stanford popu
lation. Out of a total of six counselors, three
were black, two were Hispanic and one was
of mixed ethnicity. In fact, the ethnic break
down of the counselors reflects more closely
that of the Ravenswood district population.
Student counselor Diana Vizcarra, a ju
nior majoring in comparative literature, un
derlines the similarities in talking about her
own educational and family background.
Vizcarra is Mexican-American, the
daughter of two Mexican immigrants who
moved to San Jose in the late 19705. She
learned English at the age of live, and by the
time she was ready for high school, had been
accepted to a medical magnet program for
young people interested in the health pro
fession.
"The difference between me and the
EPASA students is that I was already identi-
