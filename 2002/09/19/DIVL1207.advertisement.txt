ART 150A. STUDIO SCULPTURE WORKSHOP -In this sculpture workshop, students with and without art
making experience are welcome. Working during and outside of class time, students make three to four
sculptures using materials they have found: discarded or lost objects, organic matter, etc. At the first
meeting, we review the history of art made with found materials; throughout the workshop, we explore
tlu nature and implications of such materials and of their use in making art. The use of all necessary
tools, as well as methods of working with specific materials, are demonstrated. We discuss all finished
projects as a group. Through making, responding to, and talking about sculpture, we consider questions
both particular to three-dimensional art and common to all forms of art. Slides of a range of related
work and short articles by artists complement the experience of making sculpture. Class selection is
made by lottery at the first class meeting, September 28, in room 6, Cummings Art Building. The course
is taught by Melanie Klein and meets on September 28, October 12, October 26, November 9 and
November 23. 1 unit.
