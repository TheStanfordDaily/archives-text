"If humanity would know peace it must see itself as One. Nothing less will
take it to that blessed state. Peace will be established when justice rules and
the poor no longer beg for mercy. Without justice, unity is unthinkable and
would for ever evade man's grasp. Establish, then, the rule of justice and
bring unity and peace to this anguished world.
Through sharing alone will justice be confirmed.
Sharing alone will bring the peace desired by all the nations.
When men share and destroy the walls of separation they will know at last
the truth of their existence and flood the world with brotherhood and love."
