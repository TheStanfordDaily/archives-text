NEW COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS COURSES OFFERED
FOR FRESHMEN & SOPHOMORES INTERESTED IN ENGINEERING!
E154 Introduction to Engineering Mathematics
Multivariable calculus, linear algebra
E155A Mathematical and Computational Methods for Engineers
Ordinary differential equations
WINTER 2003
E155B Mathematical and Computational Methods for Engineers
Partial differential equations, eigensystem analysis, numerical methods
E155C Mathematical and Computational Methods for Engineers
Probability and statistics with applications, topics in optimization
SPRING 2(103
WINTER 2003
&VJ
The sequence will cover important areas of engineering mathematics and will
emphasize engineering applications and computation using MATLAB. The
intent is a) to introduce freshmen and sophomores to the relevant
mathematics and computational tools early in their college career, b) to
excite their interest in the engineering disciplines and provide early exposure
to the engineering faculty and the use of computation in solving real
engineering problems. The new sequence consisting of E154, E155A,
E155B, and/or E155C can be used to satisfy the general engineering
mathematics reouirement.
