## Rumsfeld pressures Congress 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Bush
administration pressed Congress to take
the lead in authorizing force against
Iraq yesterday after the U.S. campaign
fora tough new U.N. resolution was un
dercut by Saddam Hussein's offer on in
spections. As the White House talked
tough, United Nations weapons inspec
tors began planning their return to
Baghdad.
"It serves no U.S. or U.N. purpose to
give Saddam Hussein excuses for fur
ther delay," Defense Secretary Donald
H. Rumsfeld asserted.
Iraq's announcement that it would
accept the return of international
weapons inspectors nearly four years
after they left divided the Security
Council. The United States and Britain
pursued a resolution to force Iraq to dis
arm. But Russia and France were op
posed, as were Arab nations.
Rumsfeld, in testimony to the House
Armed Services Committee, and Presi
dent Bush, in a White House meeting
with top congressional leaders, dis
missed the Iraqi leader's llth-hour
overture as a stalling tactic.
"He's not going to fool anybody,"
Bush said.
Rumsfeld suggested that Iraq had
concealed evidence of its weapons pro
grams in a labyrinth o| tunnels and
other elaborate hiding places, certain to
complicate and prolong any new inspec
tion effort.
Western diplomats said the U.S.-
British draft would likely include new
instructions for weapons inspectors
and a timetable for disarmament that

would be tighter than one laid out in
an existing resolution passed in De
cember 1999.
U.S. officials said they did not intend
to let Iraq's maneuver blunt their efforts
for such a resolution. "1 see nothing to
suggest that the timing has changed for
what the United Nations Security Coun
cil is considering," said Bush press sec
retary Ari Fleischer.
Still, Iraq's invitation to give interna
tional inspectors unfettered access to
suspected weapons sites after a four
year absence divided the Security Coun
cil and prompted the White House to
step up its pressure on both allies and
Congress.
"Only certainty of U.S. and U.N.
purposefulness can have even the
prospect of affecting the Iraqi regime,"
Rumsfeld said.
