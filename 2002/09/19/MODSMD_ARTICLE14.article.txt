# U.S. intelligence missed clues on attacks
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Intelligence
agencies failed to anticipate terrorists Hying
planes into buildings despite a dozen clues
in the years before the Sept. 1 1 attacks that
Osama bin Laden or others might use air
craft as bombs, a congressional investigator
told lawmakers yesterday as they began
public hearings into the attacks.
Just a month before the attacks, intelli
gence agencies were told of a possible bin
Laden plot to hit the U.S. Embassy in
Kenya or crash a plane into it.
The preliminary report by Eleanor 11 ill,
staffdirector of the joint House and Senate
intelligence committee investigation of the
terrorist strike, showed authorities had
many more warnings about possible attacks
than were previously disclosed.
The reports were generally vague and
uncorroborated. None specifically predict
ed the Sept. 11 attacks. But collectively the
reports "reiterated a consistent and c ritical
ly important theme: Osama bin Laden's in
tent to launch terrorist attacks inside the
United States," Hill said.
Despite that, authorities didn't alert the
public and did little to "harden the home
land" against an assault, she said. Agencies
believed any attack was more likely to take
place overseas.
Just two months before the attacks, a
briefing for senior government officials said
that, based on a review of intelligence over
five months, "we believe that (bin Laden)
will launch a significant terrorist attack
against U.S. ancl/or Israeli interests in the
coming weeks."
"The attack will be spectacular and de
signed to inflict mass casualties against U.S.
facilities or interests. Attack preparations
have been made. Attack will occur with lit
tle or no warning," it said.
Hill read most of her 30-page report to
House and Senate members sitting togeth
er in what is believed to be the first joint in
vestigation by standing congressional com
mittees. The committees have been meet

ing behind closed doors since June to ex
amine intelligence failures leading up to
t he attacks and recommend changes.
Sen. Jay Rockefeller, I)-W.Va., said the
report revealed "far too many breakdowns
in the intelligence gathering and process
ing methods."
"Given the events and signals of the pre
ceding decade, the intelligence community
could have and in my judgment should
have anticipated an attack on U.S. soil on
the scale of 9/11he said.

Pressed by Rep. Ray Lahood, R-111., about
whether agencies had enough information
to have prevented tho attacks, 11 ill said it was
possible, but there were no guarantees.
Details of intelligence about terrorist use
of airplanes could embarrass the White
House. After questions were raised in the
spring about what President Bush knew
about terrorist threats before Sept. 11, na
tional security adviser Condoleezza Rice
said the threats were vague and uncorrob
orated.
