## The
						Stanford Daily Take time out to meet your fellow classmates

Published Since JB9l

Class of 2006, over the next few days,
you will be overwhelmed with
Freshman Orientation activities:
advising dinners, house meetings,
language tests, performances in Memorial
Auditorium and tons of panel sessions about
pretty much everything you would ever want
to know about Stanford.
But before you break out your Orientation
schedule and begin highlighting all the events
you want to attend, here is one piece of advice:
Spend your first few days on the Farm getting
to know your classmates.
Freshman Orientation is one of the only
times in your Stanford career that you won't be
burdened by classes, athletics and other activi
ties. Take advantage of it.
I remember my first days at Stanford â€” and

the first friend I made here. He was a former
soldier in the Serbian army, and I was a Mus
lim. Not exactly your perfect combination. I
even remember one of the first things he said
to me was, "You're Muslim, right? I was trained
to kill Muslims."
While that was perhaps not the best way
for him to make friends during Freshman
Orientation, I became intrigued by his stint
in the army. Although our views on the con
flict in the Balkans differed greatly, our
friendship blossomed because we were will
ing to challenge our preconceived notions
about each other.
The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and their af
termath have taught all of us the need to in
crease understanding between peoples from
different religions, nationalities and races.

There is no better place to do that than right
here at Stanford, one of the most diverse uni
versities in America.
Where else in the world can an Olympic
athlete, a future Nobel Prize winner, a for
mer Singaporean soldier and a rural South
Dakotan all live in the same hallway? Use this
invaluable opportunity to talk to someone
you might never have met if you didn't de
cide to come to Stanford.
Within a few weeks on the Farm, you'll
begin to understand what students common
ly refer to as the "Stanford bubble." Because
of Stanford's vast size and location in subur
ban Palo Alto, many students feel isolated
from the outside world. But a great way of
breaking the Stanford bubble is by breaking
your individual bubbles.

You can do this by asking your peers the
questions you are initially afraid to ask.
That's a great way to shatter stereotypes and
begin a process of mutual understanding.
Most of us come to Stanford to expand our
minds and further our intellectual curiosity.
While this university has some of the best
professors and most challenging classes in
the world, don't forget about one of its great
est resources: each other.
