# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## An Artsy Alternative 
### RAMIN SETOODEH GUEST COLUMNIST 
The most shocking discovery of my
college career arrived one night early in
freshman year.
I had done my very first load of laun
dry, figured out what classes I wanted to
take and cleaned my room from corner
to corner.
I was ready fora break.
So I went online to find a multiplex in
Palo Alto. That's when 1 found that no
such theater exists.
fhe closest first-run theaters are in
Mountain View and Redwood City, towns
that can only be reached by car.
So if I wanted to see "Meet the Par
ents," as I had planned, I would need
to make some sophomore friends with
cars — and fast.
How could I, a self-proclaimed film
buff, spend an entire year stranded not
only from my family, but the movies as
well? Those folks on "Big Brother"
might have it rough, but at least they
get paid for all their hardships.
I refused to live under such stringent
conditions. Instead, 1 asked my RAto vote
me out of the dorm so that I could go back
home, where "Almost Famous" was play
ing just down the street. (I have since
learned that no one is really voted out of
college, even if you're as dimwitted as one
of the blondes on "Sorority Life." But
then again, they do go to UC-Davis.)
Needless to say, the plan failed.
But things worked out fine once I dis
covered that the Palo Alto community is
home to some fine art house theaters.
There are three nearby, the Guild (with
one screen) in Menlo Park and the Aquar
ius and Cine Arts at Palo Alto Square (with
two screens each) in Palo Alto.
Yes, the seats aren't quite as comfort
able. fhe screen and sound quality also

aren't as good. And the selection can be
minimal, sometimes limited to only films
with subtitles.
But smaller one- and two-screen the
aters have a distinct personality that can
grown on you.
Their employees are quirkier than the
standard guy behind the concession
stand. Their ambience is cozier. And their
selection of a variety of independent films
can be more enriching than a multiplex
with "Spider Man" on 12 different
screens.
There's also the added benefit that al
most no movies ever sell out at these
smaller theaters, not even on a Friday
night. (It sounds paradoxical, 1 know, but
I'm not an Econ major, so don't ask me
for the reasoning behind that).
And because of them, films like "One
Hour Photo," "Gosford Park," "Y Tu
Mama Tambien" and"The Good Girl"
played in limited release near Palo Alto
before opening nationwide. Plus, the Palo
Alto theaters do not require cars (just a
willingness to walk 01 bike downtown).
Don't get me wrong: Now that I have a
car, 1 still like going to the local multi
plexes, even if they are a little far away.
But watching a movie at an art house the
ater is a completely dilferent experience
— one that I did not have until I came to
college.
If multiplexes with stadium seating are
like the chocolate pudding of life, sweet
and full ofenergy, then art house theaters
are like a healthy Caesar salad.
And no movie-watching diet — or col
lege education — would be balanced
without a side of each.
