Doctoral student says racial profiling will
not 'achieve the security we all seek.'
I am writing in response to Joe
Lemon's piece written on Aug. 29. I agree
that airport security does remain a key
issue. What I take issue with is your beliefs
in profiling; I object not as a "political cor
rectness aficionado," but as a pragmatist. I
will admit, however, that I have found it
challenging to argue against your posi
tion, being as non-cogent and confused as
your argument is.
First of all, profiling for "Muslim ex
tremists" does not qualify as racial profil
ing, but religious profiling, for Muslims do
not constitute a race.
The nearly 1 billion Muslims on this
planet come from each and every ethnici
ty, so I am quite taken aback by your call
for "racial profiling Muslim extremists."
Which race would that be? Caucasian?
South Asian? East Asian? Black?
Well, let us forgive this omission, and
assume that you meant "theological profil
ing." Yet, this is even more preposterous.
I cannot imagine how airport security
[employees] could look into the hearts of
men and women to judge the level of reli
gious militancy. Certainly, I would be
rather amazed if I could walk through an
airport security check that would tell me
how "extreme" my religious views are.
Perhaps, you are thinking that a proxy
for this form of extremism is the sporting
of beards and traditional clothing by men,
or hijab by women.
I lowever, despite what we see in B-class
I lollywood movies, the Sept. 11 terrorists
were not dressed in this form; in fact, as fin
as I know, they were all clean-shaven and
did not look "extremist."
So what you are proposing not only ha
rasses all those innocent people who wear
certain clothing and facial hair out of per

sonal preference but also does not even
achieve its goal of targeting terrorists.
I agree with you that there may be mo
ments when we should suspend civil liber
ties to prevent greater tragedies, even
though the suspension of civil liberties is a
tragedy of its own.
Where I disagree with you is that pro
filing of the sort you propose would
achieve the security we all seek. Ends may
justify the means, but both your ends and
means remain unjustified.
Meanwhile, please desist from strip
ping at the next security check â€” I
would hate to see airports become nudist
colonies. That too would be a tragic loss
of innocence.

Major league Baseball memorialized Sept.
11 tragedies with "dignity and grace"
I began Sept. 11 hoping that it would be
used Co remember and honor those who
died last year; however, if I had only
watched the national news media coverage,
that ideal would never have been realized.
After about five minutes of watching
the Twin lowers collapse and innocent
people jumping to their deaths re
broadcast on 12 different stations, I lit
erally began to feel ill. Was watching
them die all over again the only way we
could pay homage to those who passed
on Sept. 11, 2001?
Also, after watching the 10th story of
what the families of the victims are doing
now, 1 refused to watch television any
more on that day in some vain attempt to
destroy their obvious ploy for ratings.
I would have ended Sept. 11 angry and
embittered at the lack of basic dignity of
the news media, had I not happened to
have tickets for the Arizona Diamond

backs vs. the San Diego Padres game at
Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix.
Major League Baseball had once be
fore treated this tragedy with dignity and
grace, and I hoped to see another demon
stration of that.
1 was overjoyed to have all my hopes
fulfilled. It moved me so much that I want
ed to share will everyone back at Stanford,
in hopes that they won't lose faith in the
United States' ability to come together and
truly honor those who perished.
The ceremony began before the game
even started. First, a multi-faith choir
sang, "We Are One" from the outfield.
Once finished, the Honor Guard of all
branches of the armed forces along with
the Phoenix Police and Fire Departments
jointly marched and (lew their colors
across the field.
fhe entire stadium then hushed fora
moment of silence. After a short time had
passed, the Phoenix Fire Department's
I fonor Guard began to play "America the
Beautiful" on the bagpipes as they
mat ched from one corner of the field to
the other.
At that point, many in the stadium were
in tears, including myself. It was one of the
most moving demonstrations I have ever
seen and was followed by an almost equal
ly moving one.
Next came the ceremonial first pitch
and out of the Diamondbacks dugout
came a long chain of people holding
hands, who were introduced as New York
City Police officer Robert Lynch, New
York City firefighter Jim Dillon and the
families of Jim Snedigar, Bret Tarverand
Gary Bird who all were either at the Trade
Towers during the disaster or who had
lost family members in the line of duty.
Instead of throwing out the first pitch,
the ball was passed to each person as they
were introduced and then placed on the
pitchers mound to honor those who died
in the attack.
The ball is being sent to Governor Pata
ki of New York as a symbol of support to a
healing New York from Arizona. The first
pitch was never thrown.
Moments later, the two teams lined up
together along each foul line fora mo
ment of silence before trumpeter Jesse
McGuire performed the national an
them. This marked another moving mu
sical moment of the ceremony as he per
formed flawlessly. And, as he reached the
last note, four F-1 (>s flew over the ball
park with a thunderous boom and very
aptly culminated the ceremony.
The most impressive moment, how
ever, came as the clock neared 9:11

p.m. At ilie beginning of the game, ev
eryone in the stadium had been hand
ed white T-shirts with the words "We
Shall Not Forget."
Before the ceremonies began, the an
nouncer had explained at 9:11 p.m. that
the game would be halted for another mo
ment of silence. As 9:11 p.m. neared, ev
eryone in the stadium began to put on
their shirts and waited patiently.
Then, without any further prompting
from the announcer, at exactly 9:11
p.m., the entire stadium of spectators
rose, took off their hats, and bowed their
heads in silence.
1 his stunning display shows that while
the media may not understand how to
correctly remember Sept. 11, the Ameri
can people certainly do.
So, anyone out there feeling bitter lor a
disappointing day, should know that it
c an be done right and it was done light in
Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix, Ariz.
