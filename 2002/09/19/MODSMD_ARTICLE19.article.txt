# Alleged assault causes concern
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
On Aug. 30, a 15-year-old
Muslim girl was allegedly raped
at Long's Drug store on Univer
sity Avenue in an assault that po
lice investigated as a potential
hate crime — reminding some
members of Stanford's Muslim
community that even Palo Alto
can be hostile territory.
At 11:30 p.m., police respond
ed to a call that a sexual assault
had occurred on store property
in a basement bathroom during
business hours. Police later ar
rested Sanjay Nair, an 18-year
old East Palo Alto resident, on al
legations of rape and false im
prisonment and added a hate
crime enhancement. Both the
suspect and victim were employ
ees at the drug store.
Based on comments that Nair,
who is Hindu, allegedly made
during the assault and to police
afterwards, investigators be
lieved that the incident may have
been motivated partially by the
victim's religion.
"This wasn't white-versus-
Muslim or American-versus-
Muslim as a result of 9/11," Palo
Alto Detective Jim Coffman said
of the hate-crime allegation. "If
anything, it was more of a long
standing religious thing that had
nothing to do with Sept. 11."
In the formal charges filed by
Santa Clara District Attorney
George Kennedy's office, the
hate-crime enhancement was
not included because the office
did not find that the suspect's
motivation was primarily reli
gious or racial.
"In order for something to be
a hate crime you have to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt that
the primary motivation for the
crime was discrimintation," said
Deputy District Attorney Matt
Braker, the prosecuting attorney
for the case.
"He made derogatory re

marks to her in the weeks prior to
the attack," Braker continued.
"But he also made other com
ments that suggested that his mo
tivation in attacking her was not
solely discrimination. He com
mented on her, herself, a desire
to date her.
"Not to say that discrimination
wasn't part of it, but it was not the
primary motivation," he said.
Nair has been formally
charged with assault with intent
to commit rape.
"For [the investigators who in
terviewed the suspect], they
thought it was enough to at least
arrest him on it," said Coffman of
the initial hate-crime allegation.
"The DA has a different stan
dard. The DA files their com
plaint based on what they believe
that they can win in trial."
Coffman said that the police
department does not release
statements made by suspects.
Many Muslims at Stanford
feel that the incident was a hate
crime and in general have called
for cases involving hate acts
against Muslims to be treated
with the same seriousness as
those in which other racial and
ethnic groups are targeted.
"Muslims right now are really
sensitive, because we do see hate
crimes happening to people that
we know and that we love, and
we want to see these treated as se
riously as any other group," said
sophomore Mabrookah Henei
di, vice president of the Islamic
Society of Stanford University.
Islamic Society members
have been following the case
despite being away from cam
pus, and many feel that the in
cident — although not con
nected to Stanford — serves as
a frightening wake-up call.
"If I go back a year, talking
about when I initially moved to
Stanford, I came with a sense of
fear," Heneidi said. "But Stan
ford proved to be one of the
safest places in the country to be.

"But this [incident] was an
alarm. First and foremost, it's a
warning to other women, espe
cially because Muslim girls do
stand out — a lot of us wear
scarves, [so] w c'ic a.i obvious tar-
BeL"8 eL "
She added, "This is frighten
ing because it is so close — I shop
at that Long's Drugs."
Heneidi said that die Islamic
Society has not been in touch with
any of Stanford's Hindu groups,
but emphasized that Muslim
groups on campus have had good
relationships with them.
"To be honest, I don't think
that the hate crime was a good
gauge of campus sentiment, but
it definitely makes you think a lit
tle bit more about your own safe
ty," she said.
Heneidi cautioned against
seeing Hindu-Muslim hate
crimes as separate from the hate
crimes that many Muslims have
encountered in the United States
since Sept. 11.
"It's true that this is an inde
pendent issue because it's related
to southeast Asia, but you can't
look at it as isolated," she said.
"It's in the air — hate crimes."
In reference to recent out
breaks of religious violence in the
Indian province of Gujurat,
Heneidi added, "We don't want
the problems of India spilling
onto here, spilling onto campus."
Coffman said that from Sept.
11, 2001 through Aug. 30,
2002, there were 11 reported
hate crimes in Palo Alto, three
against people of Middle East
ern descent.
While he said that these num
bers did not deviate much from
normal hate-crime statistics in
Palo Alto, Coffman stated that
people in the Stanford commu
nity must remember that they
are not immune to hate crimes.
"Can this happen to people
in Palo Alto or Stanford cam
pus?" he said. "Sure, it can hap
pen anywhere."

She added, "This is frighten

Heneidi said that die Islamic
Society has not been in touch with
any of Stanford's Hindu groups,
but emphasized that Muslim
groups on campus have had good
relationships with them.
"To be honest, I don't think
that the hate crime was a good
gauge of campus sentiment, but
it definitely makes you think a lit
tle bit more about your own safe
ty," she said.
Heneidi cautioned against
seeing Hindu-Muslim hate
crimes as separate from the hate
crimes that many Muslims have
encountered in the United States
since Sept. 11.
"It's true that this is an inde
pendent issue because it's related
to southeast Asia, but you can't
look at it as isolated," she said.
"It's in the air — hate crimes."
In reference to recent out
breaks of religious violence in the
Indian province of Gujurat,
Heneidi added, "We don't want
the problems of India spilling
onto here, spilling onto campus."
Coffman said that from Sept.
11, 2001 through Aug. 30,
2002, there were 11 reported
hate crimes in Palo Alto, three
against people of Middle East
ern descent.
While he said that these num
bers did not deviate much from
normal hate-crime statistics in
Palo Alto, Coffman stated that
people in the Stanford commu
nity must remember that they
are not immune to hate crimes.
"Can this happen to people
in Palo Alto or Stanford cam
pus?" he said. "Sure, it can hap
pen anywhere."
