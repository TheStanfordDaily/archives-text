# Superhero stresses bike safety

### MIKEY LEE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Sprocket Man, a bicycle-safety
comic-book character designed in
1974 by a Stanford student, is mak
ing his way back to campus as a part
of Parking and Transportation Ser
vice's campaign for bike safety.
As a part of his financial-aid pack
age, Louis Saekow '76, put together
a bicycle-safety comic book for the
University. Now an art teacher at
The Art Institute in San Diego.
Saekow has designed video-game
packages for such well-known tides
as Pac-Man, Doom and Dungeons
& Dragons.
"I came up with the superhero
'Sprocket Man' as the means to add
a litde sensation to the less-dian
compelling lessons of bike safety,"
Saekow said as he recalled his own
experiences with bicycle accidents.
"One can go pretty fast on a bike,
and riding without lights or a hel
met is just asking for trouble — es
pecially when you consider how
much bike-riding a student does
since it's the most convenient way to
get around campus."
Parking and Transportation Ser
vices reported that with the fresh
man no-car policy in effect, diere
will be an estimated 12,000 bicyclists
on campus. With the campus near
ly free of hills and relatively flat, Bi
cycle Program Coordinator Ari
adne Scott said it is more convenient
for students to ride a bicycle around
campus than to drive.
"I'm not anti-car," Scott said.
"I'm pro-bike. Stanford is ideal for
cycling. You don't have to deal
with parking."
"Biking is a great form of trans
portation," said junior Jenny Miller,
a resident assistant at Robinson, the
environmental theme house. "I
diink people don't realize that it's
easy to go lots of places off-campus
by bike, as well. A bike plus public
transportation is a great alternative
to a car."
Scott stressed the importance of
bicycle safety and discussed the new
Sprocket Man campaign.
"It's very important to inform
yourself about bike safety," she
said. "While a lot of it is common
sense, students may not realize
that normal traffic laws apply to

them, as well. A lot of it is thinking
that you're driving your bike in
stead of riding it.
"Sprocket Man is our campaign
for bicycle safety. We're planning on
having a Sprocket Man Web site
and Quicktime videos, as well as
posters and comics to deliver the bi
cycle-safety program. We think it
will be a fresh and fun way to convey
a serious message."
Over 12 bicycle retailers are lo
cated within a six-mile radius of
campus, and according to Scott, the
retailers offer many discounts on
safety-related accessories. She also
mentioned the importance of bicy
cle registration.
"We want all students to license
their bikes, not only because it's a
good way to identify the bicycle in
the case of theft, but also because it
is the law," Scott said. "The fee is
only $3.50, and that is good for
three years."
Helmets and bike lights are an
other set of issues that Scott con
siders to be unhealthily ignored.
"You can get hurt riding even at
a slow pace," she said. "Students
come to Stanford and make an in
vestment in their education. Why
shouldn't they make an investment
on their brain? For about $25, you
can get a certified helmet."
While many students like Miller
may find wearing a helmet unpop
ular or inconvenient, Dean of Med

icine Philip Pizzo stressed that wear
ing one is a step toward keeping the
campus population injury-free.
"Each year students are in
jured, sometimes seriously, sim
ply because their bikes did not
liave headlights or reflectors or
because they moved across auto
mobile traffic without warning,"
Pizzo said. "Wearing a helmet and
especially having a headlight
[turned on at night] protects stu
dents and drivers.
"Using common sense and pay
ing attention to bicycle-safety guide
lines helps keep our campus safe
and healthy for all," he said.
Scott, newly appointed as the
coordinator of (he bicycle pro
gram, said that they will be hand
ing out free bike headlights — a
giveaway sponsored by the Presi
dent's Office — as well as reflec
tive leg-bands and blinking tail
lights throughout the year.
"When students register their
bikes this week, we will have free
bies like the headlights, as well as
free tune-ups and installations,"
Scott said.
Through the Sprocket Man cam
paign, headlight giveaways, and
such programs as the "Bicycle Safe
ty Road Shows," Parking and
Transportation Services strives to
bring a greater awareness of bicycle

safety to all bicyclists.
"How cyclists ride through
campus influences the campus en
vironment," said Parking and
Transportation Services Director
Brodie Hamilton. "Following the
basic rules of the road can signifi
cantly reduce the possibility of a
cyclist having an accident with
other cyclists, pedestrians or mo
torists, and contributes to creating
a safer community.
"Through the coordinated efforts
of our department and Public Safe
ty, we hope to raise the level of
awareness of students, as well as fee

ulty and staff," he said.
The road shows are programs
available to any dorm, house or or
ganization on campus that desires
bicycle-safety education.
"We can tailor the program to
the dorm or organization's spe
cific needs — be it time-al
lowance issues or a specific
focus," Scott said. "If a dorm
wants, we can even come at mid
night to put on the program. The
cycling culture can always be im
proved, and the only way we can
change it is through education."
Staff members from the pro
gram will be in White Plaza from
Sept. 19 to 21 from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
to register bicycles.

ly free of hills and relatively flat, Bi
cycle Program Coordinator Ari
adne Scott said it is more convenient
for students to ride a bicycle around
campus than to drive.
"I'm not anti-car," Scott said.
"I'm pro-bike. Stanford is ideal for
cycling. You don't have to deal
with parking."
"Biking is a great form of trans
portation," said junior Jenny Miller,
a resident assistant at Robinson, the
environmental theme house. "I
diink people don't realize that it's
easy to go lots of places off-campus
by bike, as well. A bike plus public
transportation is a great alternative
to a car."
Scott stressed the importance of
bicycle safety and discussed the new
Sprocket Man campaign.
"It's very important to inform
yourself about bike safety," she
said. "While a lot of it is common
sense, students may not realize
that normal traffic laws apply to

them, as well. A lot of it is thinking
that you're driving your bike in
stead of riding it.
"Sprocket Man is our campaign
for bicycle safety. We're planning on
having a Sprocket Man Web site
and Quicktime videos, as well as
posters and comics to deliver the bi
cycle-safety program. We think it
will be a fresh and fun way to convey
a serious message."
Over 12 bicycle retailers are lo
cated within a six-mile radius of
campus, and according to Scott, the
retailers offer many discounts on
safety-related accessories. She also
mentioned the importance of bicy
cle registration.
"We want all students to license
their bikes, not only because it's a
good way to identify the bicycle in
the case of theft, but also because it
is the law," Scott said. "The fee is
only $3.50, and that is good for
three years."
Helmets and bike lights are an
other set of issues that Scott con
siders to be unhealthily ignored.
"You can get hurt riding even at
a slow pace," she said. "Students
come to Stanford and make an in
vestment in their education. Why
shouldn't they make an investment
on their brain? For about $25, you
can get a certified helmet."
While many students like Miller
may find wearing a helmet unpop
ular or inconvenient, Dean of Med

icine Philip Pizzo stressed that wear
ing one is a step toward keeping the
campus population injury-free.
"Each year students are in
jured, sometimes seriously, sim
ply because their bikes did not
liave headlights or reflectors or
because they moved across auto
mobile traffic without warning,"
Pizzo said. "Wearing a helmet and
especially having a headlight
[turned on at night] protects stu
dents and drivers.
"Using common sense and pay
ing attention to bicycle-safety guide
lines helps keep our campus safe
and healthy for all," he said.
Scott, newly appointed as the
coordinator of (he bicycle pro
gram, said that they will be hand
ing out free bike headlights — a
giveaway sponsored by the Presi
dent's Office — as well as reflec
tive leg-bands and blinking tail
lights throughout the year.
"When students register their
bikes this week, we will have free
bies like the headlights, as well as
free tune-ups and installations,"
Scott said.
Through the Sprocket Man cam
paign, headlight giveaways, and
such programs as the "Bicycle Safe
ty Road Shows," Parking and
Transportation Services strives to
bring a greater awareness of bicycle

safety to all bicyclists.
"How cyclists ride through
campus influences the campus en
vironment," said Parking and
Transportation Services Director
Brodie Hamilton. "Following the
basic rules of the road can signifi
cantly reduce the possibility of a
cyclist having an accident with
other cyclists, pedestrians or mo
torists, and contributes to creating
a safer community.
"Through the coordinated efforts
of our department and Public Safe
ty, we hope to raise the level of
awareness of students, as well as fee

ulty and staff," he said.
The road shows are programs
available to any dorm, house or or
ganization on campus that desires
bicycle-safety education.
"We can tailor the program to
the dorm or organization's spe
cific needs — be it time-al
lowance issues or a specific
focus," Scott said. "If a dorm
wants, we can even come at mid
night to put on the program. The
cycling culture can always be im
proved, and the only way we can
change it is through education."
Staff members from the pro
gram will be in White Plaza from
Sept. 19 to 21 from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
to register bicycles.
