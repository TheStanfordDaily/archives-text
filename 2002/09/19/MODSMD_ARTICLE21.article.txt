# Campus receives summer facelift
## 
### MARK DOMINIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
On campus in the summertime,
the livin' ain't easy. Thousands of
construction workers, contractors
and engineers spent the past three
months preparing the campus for
the beginning of the academic year,
working on everything from stu
dents' beds to flower beds.
The number of construction
projects on campus this summer
was about average, according to
Cathy Blake, assistant director of
campus planning and design. What
is striking about this summer's con
struction, however, is not the num
ber of projects, but the number of
high-profile, high-visibility projects
going up around campus.
Biology and medicine
Much of this summer's construc
tion has had a medical slant: On
Campus Drive near the Medical
Center, the Clark Center — which
will be the home base (if the Bio-X
project — and the Chem-Bio build
ing are taking shape. And the new
Vaden Health Project will open its
doors on the other side of the cam
pus loop.
The Clark Center is a particular
ly large project; when finished, it
will accommodate 146,000 sq. ft. of
offices and laboratories. It will also
house the new Bioengineering de
partment, according to the Facili
ties Services Web site.
On a smaller scale, the new
Vaden Health Project will improve
health closer to campus.
Since 1996, the University had
been seeking to improve the physi
cal plant of the old Cowell Student
Health Center. After studying all of
the problems with the old building,
it became apparent that the high
cost of renovating Cowell — mak
ing it compliant with the Americans
with Disabilities Act, bringing it up
to seismic codes, removing asbestos
from walls and modernizing the
design — was unjustifiable, ac
cording to Gina Coony, a facilities
services ad ministrator.
The University decided to con
struct a new clinic instead.
The new health center is no larg
er than the previous one, but "we
were able to design in about 25 per

cent more functional space into this
new building than what was pro
posed in any of the previous re
model schemes for Cowell," Coony
said. "This is largely due to the fact,
noted above, that the Cowell struc
tural system limited flexibility in ef
ficient space layout.
"One of our major goals was to
create a place where students would
feel comfortable about seeking out
assistance with their healthcare
needs and creating a warm and
inviting environment for the deliv

ery of these health services," she
added.
Housing
This summer the student hous
ing scene wasn't sleepy either: Both
undergraduate and graduate hous
ing units underwent thorough ren
ovation.
"In Escondido Village, the Uni
versity constructed 300 new units
for graduate students," Blake said.
"Some of these units will open this
September, and the rest will open in

December."
Graduate housing shortages
have plagued the University in re
cent years. In a survey conducted
by the Graduate Student Council
last spring, housing was ranked as
one of the most serious problems
facing graduate students. The new
construction will help alleviate
some of the pressure felt by these
students, who often must choose to
live far from campus or pay rents
that far exceed their stipends.
For undergraduates, the closing
of Branner Hall for this academic
year has forced Housing and Din
ing Services to reshuffle students to
other units.
This summer, "We revised Mir
rielees floorplans in each unit to
add a third student," Blake said.
But Housing and Dining didn't
just add more beds in Mirrielees.
"Ever)' 10 or 20 years we do a
complete renovation of each resi
dence," Blake said.
"VVe look at anything that
doesn't meet current codes, any
thing deteriorating, Americans
with Disabilities Act compliance,
mechanical systems and aesthet
ics. We also do a thorough
facelift to revitalize the build
ing," she continued.
From start to finish, the process
of updating a residence is a very
time-consuming process.
"First we bring in consultants to
assess problems. They look at c ode
required, deferred maintenence.
Everyone assembles a wish list, and
we look at additional amenities that
would improve the quality of life,"
Blake said.
"We scope out the whole
building and come up with a list,
and if it all fits in budget, fine, but
everyone tries to tighten up
scope based on what has to be
done and what would be nice to
do," she added.
Branner Hall, which is a historic
building, will undergo a similar
renovation this academic year. Nor
mally part of a house is renovated
each summer fora number of
years, but due to the integrated na
ture of Branner, it is impossible to

Because of this, Branner will need
to be shut down for an enrire'yenr,

Transportation and parking
The campus was a maze of de
tours this summer, as street con
struction and regular repaving
sought to improve the driving, bik
ing and walking experiences
around Stanford.
"Serra Street is one of" our big
projects being finished this week,"
Blake said. "We want to turn Serra
Mall back into one of the axes of the
campus as a sort of multi-modal
route. We took out the median and
added about 80 permanent park
ing places, added bike lanes, Mar
guerite transit stops, sidewalks and
drop-offs for major buildings.
'Our purpose is to improve
safety and functioning of traffic on
the street. '

Academic space
Classroom space was a final
area of improvement this sum
mer. Building 160 opens its
doors again this academic year
with an enhanced interior and
high-tech facilities.
"Building 160 will be the home
teaching and research space for the
Stanford Center for Innovations in
Learning, The Stanford Humani
ties Lab, and Media X," said Laura
Goldstein, a facilities services ad
ministrator. "In addition, there are
several University classrooms, ad
ministrative offices and a new cafe."

graduation and are finished before students return to Stanford.

quad is the flexible nature of its
space utilization.
"At some level, the building will
never be 'finished'; il was specifical
ly designed to be easily reconfig
ured to accommodate the needs of
the University as they evolve," said
Bob Smith, information systems
project manager. "Installation of
systems will continue through the
beginning of fall quarter, culminat
ing with the dedication of the build
ing on Oct. 24."
High-tech functionality is inte
grated into the classrooms of Build
ing 160, which will be available to all
classes on campus.
"Advanced Resource Classrooms
have a number of features, includ
ing wireless connectivity, two rear
projection wall displays, the ability to

make an audio/video record of a
class, the ability to capture a real
time 'movie' of whiteboard notes
and drawings, and a unique com
puter collaboration environment —
developed by Ferry Winograd and
others from the Stanford Computer
Science Department — called
iSpace," Smith said.
Building 160 was a fairly large
project, according to Goldstein, but
she added that t here are much larg
er campus projects. Because of its
location, Building 160 received
some extra attention.
"This building was technically
very challenging because of its loca
tion, historic importance and its
connections to the adjacent build
ings," Goldstein said. "We demol
ished the entire interior structure
of the building while maintaining
the historic exterior. We reinstalled
the original roof tile, arcade ceiling
and interior wall to exactly match
the original condition."

quad is the flexible nature of its
space utilization.
"At some level, the building will
never be 'finished'; il was specifical
ly designed to be easily reconfig
ured to accommodate the needs of
the University as they evolve," said
Bob Smith, information systems
project manager. "Installation of
systems will continue through the
beginning of fall quarter, culminat
ing with the dedication of the build
ing on Oct. 24."
High-tech functionality is inte
grated into the classrooms of Build
ing 160, which will be available to all
classes on campus.
"Advanced Resource Classrooms
have a number of features, includ
ing wireless connectivity, two rear
projection wall displays, the ability to

make an audio/video record of a
class, the ability to capture a real
time 'movie' of whiteboard notes
and drawings, and a unique com
puter collaboration environment —
developed by Ferry Winograd and
others from the Stanford Computer
Science Department — called
iSpace," Smith said.
Building 160 was a fairly large
project, according to Goldstein, but
she added that t here are much larg
er campus projects. Because of its
location, Building 160 received
some extra attention.
"This building was technically
very challenging because of its loca
tion, historic importance and its
connections to the adjacent build
ings," Goldstein said. "We demol
ished the entire interior structure
of the building while maintaining
the historic exterior. We reinstalled
the original roof tile, arcade ceiling
and interior wall to exactly match
the original condition."
On campus in the summertime,
the livin' ain't easy. Thousands of
construction workers, contractors
and engineers spent the past three
months preparing the campus for
the beginning of the academic year,
working on everything from stu
dents' beds to flower beds.
The number of construction
projects on campus this summer
was about average, according to
Cathy Blake, assistant director of
campus planning and design. What
is striking about this summer's con
struction, however, is not the num
ber of projects, but the number of
high-profile, high-visibility projects
going up around campus.
Biology and medicine
Much of this summer's construc
tion has had a medical slant: On
Campus Drive near the Medical
Center, the Clark Center — which
will be the home base (if the Bio-X
project — and the Chem-Bio build
ing are taking shape. And the new
Vaden Health Project will open its
doors on the other side of the cam
pus loop.
The Clark Center is a particular
ly large project; when finished, it
will accommodate 146,000 sq. ft. of
offices and laboratories. It will also
house the new Bioengineering de
partment, according to the Facili
ties Services Web site.
On a smaller scale, the new
Vaden Health Project will improve
health closer to campus.
Since 1996, the University had
been seeking to improve the physi
cal plant of the old Cowell Student
Health Center. After studying all of
the problems with the old building,
it became apparent that the high
cost of renovating Cowell — mak
ing it compliant with the Americans
with Disabilities Act, bringing it up
to seismic codes, removing asbestos
from walls and modernizing the
design — was unjustifiable, ac
cording to Gina Coony, a facilities
services ad ministrator.
The University decided to con
struct a new clinic instead.
The new health center is no larg
er than the previous one, but "we
were able to design in about 25 per

cent more functional space into this
new building than what was pro
posed in any of the previous re
model schemes for Cowell," Coony
said. "This is largely due to the fact,
noted above, that the Cowell struc
tural system limited flexibility in ef
ficient space layout.
"One of our major goals was to
create a place where students would
feel comfortable about seeking out
assistance with their healthcare
needs and creating a warm and
inviting environment for the deliv

ery of these health services," she
added.
Housing
This summer the student hous
ing scene wasn't sleepy either: Both
undergraduate and graduate hous
ing units underwent thorough ren
ovation.
"In Escondido Village, the Uni
versity constructed 300 new units
for graduate students," Blake said.
"Some of these units will open this
September, and the rest will open in

December."
Graduate housing shortages
have plagued the University in re
cent years. In a survey conducted
by the Graduate Student Council
last spring, housing was ranked as
one of the most serious problems
facing graduate students. The new
construction will help alleviate
some of the pressure felt by these
students, who often must choose to
live far from campus or pay rents
that far exceed their stipends.
For undergraduates, the closing
of Branner Hall for this academic
year has forced Housing and Din
ing Services to reshuffle students to
other units.
This summer, "We revised Mir
rielees floorplans in each unit to
add a third student," Blake said.
But Housing and Dining didn't
just add more beds in Mirrielees.
"Ever)' 10 or 20 years we do a
complete renovation of each resi
dence," Blake said.
"VVe look at anything that
doesn't meet current codes, any
thing deteriorating, Americans
with Disabilities Act compliance,
mechanical systems and aesthet
ics. We also do a thorough
facelift to revitalize the build
ing," she continued.
From start to finish, the process
of updating a residence is a very
time-consuming process.
"First we bring in consultants to
assess problems. They look at c ode
required, deferred maintenence.
Everyone assembles a wish list, and
we look at additional amenities that
would improve the quality of life,"
Blake said.
"We scope out the whole
building and come up with a list,
and if it all fits in budget, fine, but
everyone tries to tighten up
scope based on what has to be
done and what would be nice to
do," she added.
Branner Hall, which is a historic
building, will undergo a similar
renovation this academic year. Nor
mally part of a house is renovated
each summer fora number of
years, but due to the integrated na
ture of Branner, it is impossible to
Ihi <* t >arts h' perwvwtioi 1. -
Because of this, Branner will need
to be shut down for an enrire'yenr,

Transportation and parking
The campus was a maze of de
tours this summer, as street con
struction and regular repaving
sought to improve the driving, bik
ing and walking experiences
around Stanford.
"Serra Street is one of" our big
projects being finished this week,"
Blake said. "We want to turn Serra
Mall back into one of the axes of the
campus as a sort of multi-modal
route. We took out the median and
added about 80 permanent park
ing places, added bike lanes, Mar
guerite transit stops, sidewalks and
drop-offs for major buildings.
'Our purpose is to improve
safety and functioning of traffic on
the street. '

Academic space
Classroom space was a final
area of improvement this sum
mer. Building 160 opens its
doors again this academic year
with an enhanced interior and
high-tech facilities.
"Building 160 will be the home
teaching and research space for the
Stanford Center for Innovations in
Learning, The Stanford Humani
ties Lab, and Media X," said Laura
Goldstein, a facilities services ad
ministrator. "In addition, there are
several University classrooms, ad
ministrative offices and a new cafe."
