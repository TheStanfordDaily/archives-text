Over the summer, Stanford welcomed two
familiar faces back to the Farm. Law School
graduate Richard West was elected to the Board
of Trustees, and former John Knight Fellow
Gordon Earle was appointed to the position of
vice president of public affairs.
Stanford's Board ofTrustees elected West, a
prominent Native American and alumnus of
Stanford Law School, at its last meeting of the
academic year on June 14.
West is a member of the Cheyenne and Ara
paho Tribes of Oklahoma and is currently di
rector of the Smithsonian Institution's National
Museum of the American Indian. As director of
the museum, West will guide the opening of its
exhibition facility in New York City, the Cultur
al Resource Center in Maryland and the muse
um on the National Mall.
While Stanford's Native American Cultural

Center was unaware of West's nomination, it is
taking advantage of the opportunity to involve
West in Native American affairs on campus.
"We have planned to schedule the NACC ad
visory board meeting at the same time he's on
campus for the Board ofTrustees next fall," said
Assistant Dean of Students and Director of
NACC Winona Simms.
Stanford's Native American community
worked with West before his appointment and
inducted him into the Alumni Hall of Fame in
Oct. 2001.
Before becoming director of the museum,
West co-founded an Native American-owned
law firm in Albuquerque, N.M. He earned his
law degree from Stanford in 1971 and was edi
tor of the Stanford Law Review. 1 le served on
Stanford Law School's Board of Visitors from
1978 to 1981 and is a former adjunct professor
at the Law School.
"As our first Native American trustee, he in
creases our diversity," said Isaac Stein, chair of

the Board ofTrustees. "But more important, he
brings a unique skill set to our activities. As a
lawyer and as the founding director of the Na
tional Museum on the American Indian,
Richard has a broad range of experience in the
not-for-profit sector."
Earle, a communications professional for
merly of the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour, was
named Vice President of Public Affairs.
A former John Knight Fellow in 1988 at Stan
ford, Earle returns to the Farm after heading his
own communications firm, which had such
high-profile clients as IBM and AT&T Wireless.
Reporting directly to the president, Earle will
direct and coordinate Stanford's relations with
the local community and government agencies
and overseeing media relations.
Earle, who formally began his job in August,
is particularly interested in the University's rela
tionship with the surrounding community. The
