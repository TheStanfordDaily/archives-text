## Lythcott-Haims, a former student, aims to help new students 
### MIKEY LEE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Julie Lythcott-Haims '89, former
assistant to the President, was named
assistant vice provost and dean of
freshman and transfer students, a new
position created by Vice Provost of
Student Affairs Gene Awakuni.
"After having been here fora few
months, [Awakuni] decided that be
cause we're such a large and decen
tralized institution, it would better
serve freshmen and transfers if there
were an office dedicated to their
unique needs."
Lythcott-Haims said that the new
post will strive to make it easier for
undergraduates to make the transi
tion to the academic and social cli
mate at Stanford.
"1 am here to be a resource at the
central level for students and their
parents," she said. "I'll be working
with the residence deans, the entire
residence staff and colleagues around
campus to ensure that our new stu
dents' needs are met."
Lythcott-Haims earned her bache
lor's in American Studies at Stanford
in 1989 and a law degree from Har

vard in 1994. She was a practicing at
torney in the Bay Area until 1998
when she returned to Stanford. She
said she is excited to be in the position
because "I adore [Stanford]."
"Julie's work in student affairs at
the Law School and experience as a
lawyer in private practice, coupled
with a love for Stanford that dates back
to her time as a resident assistant at
Branner and senior class president,
make her a perfect lit for the job,"
Awakuni said.
Her office, located at 123 Meyer, is
decorated with paper lamps, retro
couches and oversized fuzzy chairs.
"We created the office from
scratch," said Lythcott-Haims. "Most
of our furniture was purchased on
runs to IKEA. We really wanted a look
that said, 'We can relate to you.' We
wanted to be somewhat edgy."
Until office hours are established,
Lythcott-Haims said that she will be
available on a drop-in basis whether a
student has a specific question or
would just like to meet.
She said she has memorized all 87
names and faces of the incoming
transfer class.
"It's those personal connections
people have here that have the great
est impact," she said. "Rather than a
Web site or e-mail, I always prefer to
have person-to-person contact. 1 hope
to have met every freshman and trans
fer student bv the end of the year."
