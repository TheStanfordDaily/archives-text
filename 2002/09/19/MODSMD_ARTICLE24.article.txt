# Freedoms important after 9-11
## 
### 
A year ago, students and faculty re
turned to campus shocked at the hor
ror and loss of life in the tragedies in
New York City, Virginia and Pennsyl
vania. Many of us knew someone who
lost a loved one, and five Stanford
alumni died in the September attacks.
A year later, it seems appropriate to
ask what we have learned from these
tragedies, and how we have grown as
individuals and as a society.

How did the
events of Sept. 11
change my per
spective? Certain
ly, 1 have wit
nessed a loss of in
nocence and a loss
of a sense of invul
nerability. But,
perhaps these no
tions had outlived

their reality and were due to be re
tired.
More importantly, the events of
Sept. 11 have increased my apprecia
tion for the core values on which this
country and this university are based.
The principles we take for granted —
a democratically elected government,
freedom of the press and of religious
choice, equality of individuals —
were, in my mind, targets of' the at
tacks. The terrorists sought not only
to kill innocent people, but also to
spread fear and to break our commit
ment to these ideals.
Fortunately, these principles are
enshrined in the national conscious
ness in a way that no act of terrorism
can destroy. Terrorists may force us to
ask hard questions about our values

and what we are willing to do to pro
tect them, but they cannot force us to
relinquish our commitment to them.
Within the University we also rely
on a set of principles enshrined in
our motto: "The Winds of Freedom
Blow." The freedom to question and
the freedom to explore are privi
leges that we zealously guard and
without which we could not function
as a place of learning. These free
doms will serve us well as we contin
ue to grapple with the meaning and
aftermath of Sept. 11.
When Abraham Lincoln spoke on
Nov. 19,1863, at Gettysburg, he want
ed not only to pay homage to the
dead, but to seek some meaning from
the thousands of lives that had been
sacrificed there. He concluded his
speech with these well-known words:
"... that we here highly resolve that
these dead shall not have died in vain;

that this na
tion shall
have a new
birth of
free d o m;
and that
govern
ment of the
people, by
the people,
for the peo
ple, shall
not perish
from the
earth... "
Like
wise, we
might ask
ourselves

what we should do so that the vic
tims of 9/11 shall not have died in
vain. Certainly, we must take steps
to prevent such acts of terror in the
future. But we must also renew our
commitment to the enduring ideals
for which this country and our uni
versity stand.
As we work toward a better world
where such acts of terror become un
thinkable, we must remember that
the right to life, liberty and the pur
suit of happiness are universal
human desires. With that under
standing, we are better prepared to
begin the task of building a just and
lasting peace among the peoples of
the world. What a splendid memori
al that would be for the victims of
Sept. 11.

John Hennessy is the president of Stanford
University.
