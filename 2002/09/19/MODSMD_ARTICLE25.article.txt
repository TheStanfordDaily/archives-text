# New Yorker remembers tragic day
## 
### 
Slightly more than one year ago, I
awoke in a friend's bed to the sound
of a ringing telephone.
The TV was turned on, left on and
neglected. Outside, all those present
— me, the friend and the friend's
mother—collected on the balcony by
the kitchen. From the south-facing
balcony on Riverside Drive, we
watched the thick plumes of smoke

rise like a well-defined ghost over the section of the sky
where two tall buildings used to he.
We were silent and barefoot. Below us, the usual
stream of weekday joggers and women with baby car
riages ambled through the park, going along with their
usual business, on a usual day. The sun was bright and
warm. The towers did not make much sound when
they crashed; from below the upper West Side's pre
war edifices, the columns of smoke would have ap
peared like the usual, late summer cumulus clouds.
Later, 1 walked home along the West Side Highway.
Heading downtown, opposite the exodus fleeing
northwards, I passed men and women whose faces and
business suits were visibly whitened by rubble and dust.
The sun glinted off the Hudson, casting the queer, lazy
light of late afternoon over the armed guards stationed
by the entrance to the Staten Island Ferry.
I lived barely two blocks from St. Vincent's I lospital.
Our neighborhood was roped off, and for days the
only vehicles to pass by us were ambulances, fire trucks
and a host of emergency rescue vehicles, all with their
sirens and blinking lights turned off.
I in at round of ambulances poured
;n. As "missing" posters multiplied, stricken faces
roamed the neighborhood, and votive candles
cropped up like a new species of weed on every corner,
every doorstep, every public statue, square and foun
tain, I grieved even more when the ambulances
stopped coming.
