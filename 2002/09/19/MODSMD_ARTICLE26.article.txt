# Afghan-American thinks about family
## 
### 
I am an Afghan-American citi
zen, and I was born in and grew up
in Kabul, Afghanistan. After the
communists took over in
Afghanistan, I lost one of my broth
ers and moved to the United States
in December of 1979. 1 moved to
Stanford in 1989.
I am very happy that everybody
with whom 1 work is nice, and that
hasn't changed after Sept. 11 of last
year. The tragedy of Sept. 11 was

sad and unfair for
the American peo
ple, but since the
government oft he
United States
started to bomb
Afghanistan, all of
my co-workers
have shown their
sympathy to the

poor people of Afghanistan also.
111! bombing of Afghanistan has

affected me emotionally and mental
ly, and I am always thinking about my
relatives and that poor country. Since
the bombing began last fall until now,
I still have not heard from any of my
relatives.'The new Afghan govern
ment is not stable and not safe, but 1
hope I will Ije able to visit Afghanistan
again some day in the 112 uture.
