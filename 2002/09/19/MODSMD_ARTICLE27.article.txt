# Terrorist attacks have greatly affected Muslims
## 
### S. NAGEEB M. ALI GUEST COLUMNIST 
Sept. 11 was a tragedy for us all. Muslims in
America dealt not only with the loss of family
and friends, but also with the manipulation of
our faith. The murder of innocent people on
that day contravened the letter and spirit of
Islam. In the following days, members of the Is
lamic Society of Stanford University and Mus
lim Students Awareness Network participated
in vigils across the campus, city and country.
We hosted a series of events explaining our
religion. This included an open Friday prayer
service, which drew over 350 members of the
Stanford community, and a Ramadan Iftar,
where students, faculty and administrators
were invited to break fast, with us. These
events culminated in our annual Islam Aware

ness Week, which explored the roles of Islam
in America.
The university has been extremely sup
portive during this trying year. Though we re
ceived several hate emails, University Presi
dent John Hennessy and the rest of the Stan
ford administration rallied our campus
around the principles of mutual respect and
understanding.
We have been touched by the support of
the Stanford community and are optimistic
that even as civil liberties come under assault
in post-Sept. 11 America, our university will
remain committed to academic and political
freedom.

S. Nageeb M. Ali, a doctoral student in the Graduate
School of Business, is the vice president of the Muslim
Students Awareness Network.
