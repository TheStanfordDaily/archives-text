# Medical technician faces acts of hate with love
## 
### MICHAEL SOLOMON GUEST COLUMNIST 
Despite the numerous changes that have
occurred in my life this year, the one that
has made me reinvent my approach to the
world has been the events of Sept. 11,2001.
On Sept. 12 and 13,1 was called as a New
Jersey Emergency Medical Technician to
work at makeshift rescue and recovery
sites. Unlike the abstract subjects I pursued
in high school, this was problem solving for
an event that's reality was unsettling. Those
days left an indelible mark on me, and now,
my interests have shifted to fields that strive
to immediately improve people's day-to
day lives.

An even greater change occurred in my
interactions with people. Despite the dis
heartening obstacles threatening our ef
forts, 1 found comfort in the bonds 1 devel
oped with my team of emergency workers.
That companionship and camaraderie
taught me that the human spirit is not only
resilient enough to withstand the most vi
cious acts of hate, but able to face them with
love. 1 now know that such an approach to
life is possible and strive to have the same
faith iiLgflpfyone 1 meet that I had in my
quickli made friends on those days after
the tragic events of Sept. 11 *
