# One year later: Stanford remembers Sept. 11
## 
### WILL OREMUS EDITORIAL STAFF 
Sometimes silence is more elo
quent than speech.
So went the thinking of Rev
erend Scotty McLennan, dean of
religious life, in planning the Uni
versity's memorial service on the
one-year anniversary of Sept. 11,
2001. Somber in tone, yet infused
with messages of hope, the service
brought several hundred stu
dents, faculty and community
members to the Quad to remem
ber lives lost and to pray fora more
peaceful future.
The noontime event featured a
brief address from University Pres
ident John Hennessy and musical
performances by representatives of
various world religions. At the con
clusion of the service, McLennan
called upon attendees to drop a
pinch of wild flower seed into a
planter full of soil, to be spread
around the Campus Drive median.
Moments of quiet reflection
were many, as the audience re
mained silent in the intervals

between songs, chants and calls
to prayer.
"I just found it so powerful to
have a minimum of words and to
do more silence and music,"
McLennan noted after the service.
"Because what can you say, really?"
When McLennan did speak,
lie stressed the importance of
community in the process of spir
itual regeneration.
"In a number of religious tradi
tions, the period of official mourn
ing for the dead lasts one year —
dead who will of course never be
forgotten no matter how many
years pass — but after one year t he
emphasis changes to re-entering
life and recommitting ourselves to
life-sustaining and life-enhancing
tasks that indeed the dead would
want of us — tasks of re-envision
ing and rebuilding," he said in his
opening words.
McLennan's brief speech was
followed by Ghais Abduljaami's
Muslim call to prayer, Sumir
Meghani's Hindu chanting of
scripture, and spiritual folk songs
from Catholic Teresa Pleins and

Protestant J esse Rice. Noa Kushner
blew the Shofar in the Jewish tradi
tion, and David Yin followed Hen
nessy's speech by sounding a Bud
dhist bell.
In his address, Hennessy called
for "renewing our commitment to
the enduring ideals for which this
country and our university stand."
"A year ago we came together
shocked at the horror and loss of
life," he said. "One year later, it
seems appropriate to ask what
we have learned and how we
have grown as individuals and as
a society.
"What can we do so that the vic
tims of 9/11 have not died in vain?"
Hennessy pointed to the Uni
versity's motto — which translates
to "the wind of freedom blows" —
as a symbol of the community's
dedication to liberty and unfet
tered inquiry.
"These freedoms will serve us
well as we continue to grapple with
the aftermath of 9/11," he said.
