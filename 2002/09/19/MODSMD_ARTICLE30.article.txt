# Student warns against empty patriotism
## 
### 
Times of urgency reveal what lies within the core of our
souls. The Sept. 11 tragedy has brought to the surface the
reality that no firm convictions lie within the core of 21st
century Americans.
While some are encouraged by the multitude of U.S.
flags we see flying from nearly every car and home, in truth
the motivations of that patriotism are shallow and should
rather add to our fear. As the blindly nationalistic Germans
who were so easily swayed by the Nazi regime during the
19305, Americans have united with unprecedented

strength and fervor, but this patriotism is merely recourse to fear and can
be manipulated by influential leadership.
We risk attaching ourselves so tightly to America that we could sacrifice
even our democratic identity for its preservation. Nationalism without con
viction is an invitation for oppression.
One year later, we must realize that we cannot resist terror in America
without knowing what we as Americans truly believe and cannot yield, or
else we will surrender our identity for some foolish patriotic passion. We
must establish convictions. We must find and cling to the objects of our faith
iu order to give our proudly displayed flags meaning and our nation true
unity, security and longevity.
