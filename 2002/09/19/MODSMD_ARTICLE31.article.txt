# The 						Bridge warns: Don't neglect mental health
## 
### 
In the first iveek of school at the end of
SeptemberUooo, The Bridge Peer Coun
seling Center took fifteen calls—mostly
about sexuality, relationships, and eating
disorders. Only one was about stress or de
pression. The Bridge again took 15 calls in
the last week oi September 2001, but this
time nearly half of them involved stress or
depression three of those explicitly in
volved stress-a bout the Sepi. 11 terrorist at
tacks. Oui statistics suggest that the Stan
ford community was affected I))' the attacks.
However, staffers at The Bridge were
surprised bj( how little Stanford students
sought Mi in dealing with stress after the
attacks; Vei, calis about stress did increase,
but not bv rruidi — evenleis than the in
creast of calls dtiring a typical finals week.
We anti<ipi|fcdji far greater response. *

A disturbing trend we have noticed over
t he years as peer counselors is Stanford stu
dents' tendency to neglect their mental
health amid the flurry of the quarters. It
seems like dealing with personal issues
takes a back seat to classwork, extracurricu
lars and socializing. We hope that the lower
than expected volume of calls about the
tragedy of Sept. 1.1 isn't a furthq| manifes
tation of that trend. Addressing the sources
of stress and anxifty in your life can help
you deal with therfri in the long run. „
