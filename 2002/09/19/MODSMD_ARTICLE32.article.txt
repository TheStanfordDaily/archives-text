# Sikh uses tragedy to explain his faith
## 
### 
In the aftermath of Sept. 11,
Sikhs all over the United States
have been persecuted because they
wore turbans or simply "looked like
a terrorist." Both my friends and
family have been verbally and
physically abused. My aunt was
even stabbed twice in the head.
I, overwhelmed with packing
everything I owned and making
the transition from high school to
college, was initially distraught and
scared for my own well-being.
However, I vowed not to let these
tragic events events affect the way I
live my life. I was determined to
make those unaware of the Sikh re
ligion understand my cultural and
religious background. Despite the
glares and comments, I wanted to
show the world that I was not afraid
of being myself.
After arriving on campus (my

family decided
that driving was
safer than Hying), I
found that every
one here was open
and accepting.
They wanted to
know my percep
tions of what hap
pened and how it
has influenced me.

I always say that I use Sept. 11 to
explain the Sikh religion and use
those events as a springboard to ed
ucate others about my culture. By
adhering to my beliefs, 1 believe
that I have helped people see us
not just as Sikhs, but as functioning
members of America's melting pot.
