# Pakistani finds vision of America shattered
## 
### 
As much as I clo not wish to sound
callous, 1 must admit that my initial
reaction to the happenings of Sept.
11 was not profound. 1 certainly
grieved at the innocent lives lost but
I felt this was just one of many such
incidents 1 had witnessed over the
years, whether they pertained to
j terrorism in the Middle East, Kash
mir or the Balkans. I was confident
that retribution would be quick and
effective and was too overwhelmed
by the excitement of starting my
freshman year at Stanford toJhink
much more about it. g C
■Once safely inside the Stanford
bubble, my impressions of the event
were generated entirely by the brief
exchanges I had with my peers. I felt
j somewhat 1 a mini-celebrity pro
pounding my personal .viewpoint in
America itself was to some extent re
sponsible for the tragedy, and why the
subsequent actions were lot justified.
I never considered how this event
had changed the Outlook of people
back in Pakistan. This realization
only came to light when I returned

home after the span
of a year and learned
that my parents had
stopped watching
CNN and reading
TIME because they
just could not bear to
listen to the western
viewpoint on Sept.
11 any longer.

I ney now lived in eternal fear of
their son being discriminated
against in a foreign land. To be hon
est, 1 do not share such fears, but in
the eves of people back at home, 1
am no longer here seem ing a future
for myself, rather my future is in
jeopardy the longer I stay here. It is
too ear|y for me to tell whether their
fears will materialize.
Bui What I do know is that while
America's response to Sepi. U may
have inidc the world safer to t| some,
it has] just shattered the vision of
America as the land of hope and etir
nal justice for others.
