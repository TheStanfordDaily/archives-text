# SCPJ member questions U.S. govt. policies

### JESSICA JENKINS GUEST COLUMNIST 
I he planes crashing into the twin towers signaled
to me the beginning of a long string of retaliatory vi
olence. I was not mistaken. Sept. 1 1 will remain ir
revocably in our memories, but what about Oct. 7,
2001, the day the U.S. government began a bombing
campaign in Afghanistan that would take several
thousand civilian lives? And the disappearances and
detentions of immigrants, t hat have slipped past our
notice? I have struggled to make sense of these
events and to voice my opposition to the brutality
that has unfolded.
The Stanford Community for Peace and justice
emerged in the fall of 2001, seeking a constructive
peace instead of a violent retaliation, respect and jus
tice for people of all races, ethnicities, nationalities
and religions and adherence to U.S. civil liberties and
constitutional rights.
By questioning our government's policy, we do not
condone those who have attacked us; yet we find it im
perative to speak out against the military force which
does not confront the political, social and economic
bases of terrorism. We mourn Sept. 11, yet we cannot
ignore the hypocrisy and destructiveness of the vio
lent policies, at home and abroad that violate our
commitment to life and liberty. Our grief is not a cry
for war. We will keep crying out for peace.

Senior Jessica Jenkins is a cure member of the Stanford Com
in unity for Peace and Justice.
