# Panel explores changed world
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
For the 350 students, faculty and stall' on
campus for Sophomore College, Sept. 1 1 was
commemorated not only by somber reflection,
but also by an intellectual examination of the
implications of last year's terrorist attacks and
the future of United States policy.
While the general Stanford community ob
served Sept. 11 with a noontime memorial ser
vice, approximately 175 Sophomore College
participants gathered at 7 p.m. for "September
11: One Year Later," a closed panel featuring
the reflections of five Sophomore College facul
ty. The speakers, who represented a variety of
disciplines in the humanities, s(x:ial sciences and
engineering, were chosen because of the perti
nence of their classes' subject matter to Sept. 11.
Unlike the emotional memorial held earlier
in the day, the panel addressed the geopolitical

concerns of the nation, especially the potential
war in Iraq and U.S. relations with the Middle
East, and most speakers called for serious exam
ination or changes in U.S. government policies.
Assistant Vice Provost and Director of Fresh
man and Sophomore Programs Sharon Palmer,
who heads Sophomore College, said that the
panel was intentionally designed as a way to in
tellectually grapple with the issues surrounding

Sept 11.
"There are lots of memorial serv ices going on
and lots of events," Palmer said. "One of the aims
of Sophomore College is talking critically about
things."
In introducing the panel, Palmer reflected
upon the experience of last year's Sophomore

College students, who were on ami
pus during the attacks.
"Subjects that might have
seemed somehow 'academic,' in the
negative sense of being removed
from day-to-day life, now felt ur
gent, critical and very real," she said.
"I hope [the students] will go
away with the urge to grapple with
these issues further," she added.
Robert McGinn, professor of
management science and engineer
ing and co-chair of the Science,
Technology and Society Program,
began the panel discussion by re
flecting upon the changes the na
tion has gone through over the last
year but concluded that the govern
ment has failed to make necessary
changes to the status quo.
"While some things have indeed
changed since last 9/11, many of the
most important things have not,"
he said.
McGinn cited a newfound "hum
bling sense of national vulnerability"
and "an increased awareness about
the rest of the world by U.S. citizens"
as important changes in the Ameri
can mindset, and he additionally
praised the fall of the Taliban and its
oppression of women.
"However, in the U.S. many of
the most critical things have not
changed one iota," he added.
"While we are embarked on a cam
paign to defeat terrorism, we've
clone little or nothing to address the
multiple causes that gave rise to the
phenomenon of 9/11 in the first
place."
McGinn referred to the U.S. de
pendence on foreign petroleum
and consequent military presence
in the Middle East, an unbalanced
foreign policy in the Arab-Israeli
conflict, and the support of oppres

sive Arab governments as the pri
mary U.S. policies that are in need
of serious reconsideration.
"In a nutshell, then, I believe
that the U.S. response to 9/11, while
emotionally riveting, has at bottom
been superficial and not even
begun to get at the root of the polit
ical-economic policies and cultural
problems that together provide the
soil from which Bin Laden and his
ilk harvest new terrorists-to-be," he
said.
McGinn predicted that the U.S.
government will continue to use
technology and border security
practices tocombat terrorism "with
out launching anything remotely
resembling a fundamental re-ex
amination of the political-economic
assumptions and cultural practices
that have engendered so many ene
mies of the U.S., ones that we
learned a year ago can cause us a lot
more suffering than we had ever
imagined."
I le concluded by urging stu
dents to bring their critical analyti
cal powers to push the government
to change its policies.
Elizabeth Bernhardt, professor
of German studies and director of
the Stanford Language Center, fol
lowed McGinn's speech by relating
the content of her Sophomore Col
lege to Sept. 11 and relaying a per
sonal account of a defining conver
sation with a former student.
Bernhardt discussed the ties that
Dietrich Bonhoeflfer's work "Letters
and Papers from Prison," which she
teaches in her Sophomore College
class, has to the American situation
and the terrorist attacks.
She also talked about a conversa
tion she had soon after the attacks
when a student posed the question,
"What makes you so sure Bush
didn't do it?"
" That was a hard moment for
me; it still is," Bernhardt said. "But
it made me remember that we are a

country of free speech, and that that
is one of the American values for
which all of those people died."
Bernhardt said that (he attacks
and her subsequent experiences
have caused her to refocus her
course material and concentrate on
forgiveness.
Speaking after Bernhardt was
Tom Sheehan, professor of reli
gious studies, who argued against
U.S. intervention in Iraq.
"President Bush has virtually
turned 9/11 into a poster for the war
on Iraq," he said.

"While some things have indeed
changed since last 9/11, many of the
most important things have not."
Robert McGinn,
professor of management science
and engineering

Though he would rather have
spent the anniversary of the attacks
"in quiet memory of the 3,000 who
died," Sheehan said he "felt the
need to make a case against the
seemingly inevitable attack on
Iraq."
Sheehan emphasized that Sept.
11 was not a license for attack on
Iraq, questioned the administra
tion's argument that Saddam Hus
sein has viable weapons of mass de
struction and warned that the new
U.S. national-security plan "may
unhinge the Middle East."
"Iraq two — the war we are
planning, commencing and carry
ing out — will be a crime," he said,
arguing that the potential U.S. ac
tion would be in violation of inter
national law.
Sheehan then challenged Vice

President Dick Cheney's argument
that the threat posed by Iraq was
"grave, immediate and unavoid
able," citing the administration's re
luctance to go to Congress and out
of-date intelligent assessments.
He also warned that the case the
U .S. government is making for war
did not address the dangerous
precedent an attack would make,
the stability of the Middle East or a
plan for Iraq after Hussein is ousted.
"You will decide what 9/11
means to you, what you want it to
be, what it can be lor," Sheehan con-

eluded. "You can decide what you
stand for in this brave new world."
Political Science Assoc. Prof. Luis
Fraga also addressed the reaction of
the United States to Sept. 11 and
the prospect ofa war in Iraq by ask
ing questions he felt his late father,
a veteran, would ask.
Fraga framed his speech by
rhetorically asking, "What would
he ask me about 9/11 one year
later?"
He first addressed respect for
the nation's leaders and the mili
tary, remembrance of those who
died and the celebration of patrio
tism.
Fraga then said that his father
would ask if Americans had shown
respect for their citizenship and
complied with its responsibilities.
"Have you informed yourself of

the issues?" he said his father would
have asked. "Have you asked your
leaders the hard questions?"
Fraga addressed the danger of
labeling terrorists as "irrational,
non-sensical evildoers" and "mind
less, merciless and filled with ruth
less ambition."
"[My father] would ask me
whether or not, in dehumanizing
those who do us harm, we may
make ourselves incapable of under
standing why they do what they
do," he said.
He questioned if U.S. policy
could be driven by oil interest or
election-year politics and if the civil
rights and other liberties had re
mained intact.
Fraga ended by emphasizing the
individual responsibilities Ameri
cans face a year after Sept. 11.
"Son, are you doing your part as
a citizen to make sure that the choic
es your government is making are
choices that I would have support
ed if I were still there?" he said his
father would ask.
The final speaker, Andrea
Lunsford, professor of English and
director of the Program in Writing
and Rhetoric, urged the United
States to engage other nations and
expressed special concern lor the
often forgotten victims of war and
isolation — children.
Lunsford recounted her reac
tion to hearing about the terrorist
attacks just over a year ago.
"When I woke up I was seized
with terror," she said. "But it was
more terror of my government and
what my government might do,"
she said, emphasizing the degree to
which the future depends on U.S.
actions.
"I think I have thought from that
day until this about the children of
the world," she said.
Lunsford discussed the United
States' foreign policy options, mak
ing the analogy of a closed fist vei -

sus an open hand.
"I do believe that we have the
ability to hold an open hand to
those around us," she said, "espe
cially when we think not of the gov
ernment, not of the leaders, but of
the people, the children of the
world. .. all people, not just those
who look like we look, or think how
we think."
Citing the first two lines of the
Robert Frost poem "Fire and Ice"
she read at the beginning of her re
marks, Lunsford concluded her
talk by alluding to the prospect of
cooperation.
"Some say the world will end in
lire, some say in ice. I say it's our job
to reject that dichotomy," she said.
At the conclusion of the speech
es, the audience gave the panelists a
lengthy standing ovation.
Students then questioned the
panelists about the prospect of
democracy in the Middle East; the
permanence of the United States'
role as the center of global power;
the feasibility of the United States
decreasing its dependence on for
eign oil and solving the issues in the
Middle East; and the future of civil
rights in America.
While the panel represented a
range of academic disciplines, the
opinions expressed on the Bush ad
ministration's foreign policy in the
Middle East and Iraq were very
similar, with no speaker outwardly
supportive of the Bush administra
tion.
When asked about the apparent
uniformity of opinions, Palmer said
that politics was not a factor in
choosing the speakers.
"I asked faculty teaching classes
related to the topic to speak," she
said. "I did not otherwise try to in
fluence or know how they were
going to address the subject," she
added, noting that last year's facul
ty panel after Sept. 11 was more bal
anced in opinion.
