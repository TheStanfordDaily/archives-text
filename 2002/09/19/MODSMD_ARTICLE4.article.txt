# Panel explores changed world

### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
For the 350 students, faculty and stall' on
campus for Sophomore College, Sept. 1 1 was
commemorated not only by somber reflection,
but also by an intellectual examination of the
implications of last year's terrorist attacks and
the future of United States policy.
While the general Stanford community ob
served Sept. 11 with a noontime memorial ser
vice, approximately 175 Sophomore College
participants gathered at 7 p.m. for "September
11: One Year Later," a closed panel featuring
the reflections of five Sophomore College facul
ty. The speakers, who represented a variety of
disciplines in the humanities, s(x:ial sciences and
engineering, were chosen because of the perti
nence of their classes' subject matter to Sept. 11.
Unlike the emotional memorial held earlier
in the day, the panel addressed the geopolitical

concerns of the nation, especially the potential
war in Iraq and U.S. relations with the Middle
East, and most speakers called for serious exam
ination or changes in U.S. government policies.
Assistant Vice Provost and Director of Fresh
man and Sophomore Programs Sharon Palmer,
who heads Sophomore College, said that the
panel was intentionally designed as a way to in
tellectually grapple with the issues surrounding

Sept 11.
"There are lots of memorial serv ices going on
and lots of events," Palmer said. "One of the aims
of Sophomore College is talking critically about
things."
In introducing the panel, Palmer reflected
upon the experience of last year's Sophomore
