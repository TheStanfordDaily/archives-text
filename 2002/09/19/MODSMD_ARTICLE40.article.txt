## Teevens brings fun and gun to the Farm 
### MATT LONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford started its season with a
new coach, a new locker room, a
new weight room and even new uni
forms. But from outside the football
program came die same old low
preseason expectations, and that's
largely because Stanford has an en
tirely new defense.
The result so far as been a 1-1
record for new head coach Buddy
Teevens, whose first win came in last
week's home opener against San
Jose State, 63-26.
Despite inheriting a 9-3 team
that finished last season ranked No.
16 and tied for second in the Pacific
-10 Conference, Teevens entered his
first season with the Cardinal poised
to play die role of the underdog —
just as his predecessor Tyrone Will
ingham was forced to do in each of
the last seven seasons. Stanford
began 2002 out of the top 25 rank
ings, and is picked to finish any
where from sixth to ninth in the Pac
-10 by national media sources.
That's largely because, on paper,
the Cardinal has all the balance of
Enron's accounting sheets.
The Pac-10's top-scoring offense
in 2001 returns seven starters, and
that's not even counting junior
quarterback Chris Lewis (20 career
touchdowns), sophomore receiver
Teyo Johnson (last season's Pac-10
co-Freshman of the Year) or senior
tailback Keny Carter (a consistent
producer since he starred as a true
freshman).
The offense spent the off-season
studyingTeevens's pass-heavy play
book. His game plan has already
been dubbed the "fun and gun" in
tribute to his last coaching stint as of
fensive assistant under Steve Spurri
er at Florida.
There was little fun in die Cardi
nal's sloppy debut, a 34-27 loss at
Boston College. That's in part be
cause of the one-game suspension of
Lewis due to personal phone calls
made from die Stanford Depart
ment of Athletics in the summer.
Lewis was replaced by redshirt
freshman Kyle Matter, who played
well, throwing for 244 yards and a
touchdown while running for an
other score. Matter also tcxik over
for Lewis last weekend when the
starter left the game with a thigh
bruise. He led the Cardinal to five
straight touchdowns in the second
half, passing for 123 yards and rush
ing into the end zone once again.
"Chris stunned his knee a bit,
and he could have come back,"

Teevens said. "At that point we told
Kyle that he would start the second
half, and he made some very good
decisions. He really, really im
pressed me with his confidence. He
was much more relaxed after hav
ing a game under his belt."
Despite Matter's emergence,
Teevens insists there is no quarter
back controversy on the Farm and
that Lewis will start the Cardinal's
Sept. 28 contest at Arizona State.
Even with a pass-first philoso
phy, Teevens realizes the impor
tance of establishing a strong run
ning game, especially with seniors
Carter and fullback Casey Moore
back after helping the Cardinal lead
the Pac-10 in rushing last season.
"Historically, Stanford lias
thrown the ball a lot, and I'd like to
have that ability again," Teevens
said. "Working with Coach Spurrier
was a tremendous education, and
prior to that, at every stop I've
thrown the ball a great deal. We'd
like to be very multiple. Of course
with our offensive line and running
backs, we'll also have balance."
Moore is currently leading the
team with 123 yards on 19 carries.
On the other side of the ball, it's a
whole different story. Teevens is
happy to have a crop of the nation's
top recruits from the past few years
to fill out his defense. The problem
is that a majority of them have never
made a hit on a college football field.

Just two starters, senior tackles
Matt Leonard and Craig Albrecht,
return. Senior tackle Trey Freeman
and senior safety Colin Branch are
the only other players on the roster
with significant defensive experi
ence.
Speedy sophomores Leigh Tor
rence and Stanley Wilson will an
chor ihe corners, and they have
shown flashes of their potential thus
far. 1 "orrence grabbed two intercep
tions against Boston College, and
Wilson recorded a pick last week
end.
"We have guys that have not set
foot on the varsity field, and they
have to play like they have,"
Teevens said. "We can make a big
deal that they don't have experi
ence, but what I told the guys is that
it is the same game that they have
played fora long time. It is nothing
new to them, and we have to go in
with that mindset that they are
ready to go."
One boon to the young defense is
that it will have practiced against
what may be one of the nation's
most potent point producers come
game time.
Stanford's offensive unit boasts
the Pac-10's best offensive line,
which should present Lewis (and
Matter) with plenty of opportunities
to find one of his three star receivers.
Junior tackle Kwame I larris and se
nior guard Greg Schindler each

garnered preseason Ail-American
honors.
The receiving corps also lines
up as one of college football's
finest. Johnson has been featured
even more in his second season
(224 yards and three touchdowns
so far) and junior flanker Luke
Powell, last year's leading receiv
er and a first team Ail-American
selection as punt returner, can
turn any play into a scoring op
portunity. His 22.3 yards per re
ception average ranks first on
Stanford's all time list. The 6-
foot-7 Johnson's athleticism
paired with the 5-8 Powell's ex
plosiveness will strike opponents
with a lethal thunder and light
ning combination.
These talented targets, along
with a new, pass-oriented offense,
bode extremely well for Lewis. A
prized recruit out of Long Beach
Poly High School, Lewis finally has a
chance to establish himself among
the great Cardinal signal-callers.
Lewis earned his stripes as a
backup in the past two seasons, re
lieving injured Randy Fasani in sev
eral big games and leading Stanford
to victory. List season he was thrust
into the starting role in the heart of
Stanford's conference schedule,
leading the team to huge wins over
No. 4 Oregon and No. 5 UCLA
while compiling a 3-1 overall record
as a starter.

"We have guys that have not set
foot on the varsity field, and they
have to play like they have,"
Teevens said. "We can make a big
deal that they don't have experi
ence, but what I told the guys is that
it is the same game that they have
played fora long time. It is nothing
new to them, and we have to go in
with that mindset that they are
ready to go."
One boon to the young defense is
that it will have practiced against
what may be one of the nation's
most potent point producers come
game time.
Stanford's offensive unit boasts
the Pac-10's best offensive line,
which should present Lewis (and
Matter) with plenty of opportunities
to find one of his three star receivers.
Junior tackle Kwame I larris and se
nior guard Greg Schindler each

garnered preseason Ail-American
honors.
The receiving corps also lines
up as one of college football's
finest. Johnson has been featured
even more in his second season
(224 yards and three touchdowns
so far) and junior flanker Luke
Powell, last year's leading receiv
er and a first team Ail-American
selection as punt returner, can
turn any play into a scoring op
portunity. His 22.3 yards per re
ception average ranks first on
Stanford's all time list. The 6-
foot-7 Johnson's athleticism
paired with the 5-8 Powell's ex
plosiveness will strike opponents
with a lethal thunder and light
ning combination.
These talented targets, along
with a new, pass-oriented offense,
bode extremely well for Lewis. A
prized recruit out of Long Beach
Poly High School, Lewis finally has a
chance to establish himself among
the great Cardinal signal-callers.
Lewis earned his stripes as a
backup in the past two seasons, re
lieving injured Randy Fasani in sev
eral big games and leading Stanford
to victory. List season he was thrust
into the starting role in the heart of
Stanford's conference schedule,
leading the team to huge wins over
No. 4 Oregon and No. 5 UCLA
while compiling a 3-1 overall record
as a starter.

Junior quarterback Chris Lewis looks downfield while pressured by Spartan defensive end Philip Perry. Lewis, who
only played in the first half, was 12 -of-22 for 182 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions.
Stanford started its season with a
new coach, a new locker room, a
new weight room and even new uni
forms. But from outside the football
program came die same old low
preseason expectations, and that's
largely because Stanford has an en
tirely new defense.
The result so far as been a 1-1
record for new head coach Buddy
Teevens, whose first win came in last
week's home opener against San
Jose State, 63-26.
Despite inheriting a 9-3 team
that finished last season ranked No.
16 and tied for second in the Pacific
-10 Conference, Teevens entered his
first season with the Cardinal poised
to play die role of the underdog —
just as his predecessor Tyrone Will
ingham was forced to do in each of
the last seven seasons. Stanford
began 2002 out of the top 25 rank
ings, and is picked to finish any
where from sixth to ninth in the Pac
-10 by national media sources.
That's largely because, on paper,
the Cardinal has all the balance of
Enron's accounting sheets.
The Pac-10's top-scoring offense
in 2001 returns seven starters, and
that's not even counting junior
quarterback Chris Lewis (20 career
touchdowns), sophomore receiver
Teyo Johnson (last season's Pac-10
co-Freshman of the Year) or senior
tailback Keny Carter (a consistent
producer since he starred as a true
freshman).
The offense spent the off-season
studyingTeevens's pass-heavy play
book. His game plan has already
been dubbed the "fun and gun" in
tribute to his last coaching stint as of
fensive assistant under Steve Spurri
er at Florida.
There was little fun in die Cardi
nal's sloppy debut, a 34-27 loss at
Boston College. That's in part be
cause of the one-game suspension of
Lewis due to personal phone calls
made from die Stanford Depart
ment of Athletics in the summer.
Lewis was replaced by redshirt
freshman Kyle Matter, who played
well, throwing for 244 yards and a
touchdown while running for an
other score. Matter also tcxik over
for Lewis last weekend when the
starter left the game with a thigh
bruise. He led the Cardinal to five
straight touchdowns in the second
half, passing for 123 yards and rush
ing into the end zone once again.
"Chris stunned his knee a bit,
and he could have come back,"

Teevens said. "At that point we told
Kyle that he would start the second
half, and he made some very good
decisions. He really, really im
pressed me with his confidence. He
was much more relaxed after hav
ing a game under his belt."
Despite Matter's emergence,
Teevens insists there is no quarter
back controversy on the Farm and
that Lewis will start the Cardinal's
Sept. 28 contest at Arizona State.
Even with a pass-first philoso
phy, Teevens realizes the impor
tance of establishing a strong run
ning game, especially with seniors
Carter and fullback Casey Moore
back after helping the Cardinal lead
the Pac-10 in rushing last season.
"Historically, Stanford lias
thrown the ball a lot, and I'd like to
have that ability again," Teevens
said. "Working with Coach Spurrier
was a tremendous education, and
prior to that, at every stop I've
thrown the ball a great deal. We'd
like to be very multiple. Of course
with our offensive line and running
backs, we'll also have balance."
Moore is currently leading the
team with 123 yards on 19 carries.
On the other side of the ball, it's a
whole different story. Teevens is
happy to have a crop of the nation's
top recruits from the past few years
to fill out his defense. The problem
is that a majority of them have never
made a hit on a college football field.

Just two starters, senior tackles
Matt Leonard and Craig Albrecht,
return. Senior tackle Trey Freeman
and senior safety Colin Branch are
the only other players on the roster
with significant defensive experi
ence.
Speedy sophomores Leigh Tor
rence and Stanley Wilson will an
chor ihe corners, and they have
shown flashes of their potential thus
far. 1 "orrence grabbed two intercep
tions against Boston College, and
