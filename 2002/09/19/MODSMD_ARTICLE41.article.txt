# Volleyball gets Tom back tonight

Sports lesson No. 1 for all the new fresh
men: California is Stanford's rival at every
thing.
Sports lesson No. 2: The rivalry works
better in some places than others.
Stanford's seven-game winning streak in
Big Games is the first example that comes to
mind, but there are better ones than that â€”
like women's volleyball.

Women's Volleyball
vs. No. 14 Pepperdine, Saturday, 7:00 p.m.

In two weeks, it will be 20 years since Cal
won a women's volleyball match against
Stanford.
And though the Golden Bears (9-0) have
matched the best start in program history
this year, they still have an uphill battle to
prevent the two-decade mark from being
reached.
Cal gets its one shot tonight as No. 4 Stan
ford (8-1) hosts the Bears at 7:00 p.m. in
Maples Pavilion in the Pacific-10 Confer
ence opener for both teams. Though the
Cardinal played three matches at home two
weeks ago, the match will, in spirit at least,
feel like the home-opener for Stanford.
The Cardinal welcomes three-time All-
American outside hitter Logan Tom back
