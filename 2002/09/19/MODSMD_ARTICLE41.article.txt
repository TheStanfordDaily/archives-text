# Volleyball gets Tom back tonight

Sports lesson No. 1 for all the new fresh
men: California is Stanford's rival at every
thing.
Sports lesson No. 2: The rivalry works
better in some places than others.
Stanford's seven-game winning streak in
Big Games is the first example that comes to
mind, but there are better ones than that —
like women's volleyball.

Women's Volleyball
vs. No. 14 Pepperdine, Saturday, 7:00 p.m.

In two weeks, it will be 20 years since Cal
won a women's volleyball match against
Stanford.
And though the Golden Bears (9-0) have
matched the best start in program history
this year, they still have an uphill battle to
prevent the two-decade mark from being
reached.
Cal gets its one shot tonight as No. 4 Stan
ford (8-1) hosts the Bears at 7:00 p.m. in
Maples Pavilion in the Pacific-10 Confer
ence opener for both teams. Though the
Cardinal played three matches at home two
weeks ago, the match will, in spirit at least,
feel like the home-opener for Stanford.
The Cardinal welcomes three-time All-
American outside hitter Logan Tom back

face California and No. 14 Pepperdine.
into the lineup after a three-week
stint with the U.S. national team at
the World Championships.
Her return will give Stanford a
welcome boost coming off its first
loss of the season to No. 3 Florida
on Saturday, a loss that dropped
the Cardinal from the top spot in
the rankings.
"Logan's return changes things
on the court, but we've worked
hard to develop a unity and a
chemistry that she can just step
into," said sophomore setter Anna
Robinson.
Tom's passing abilities should
help the Cardinal shore up its
backcourt game, which has been
shaky at times early this season.
Cal will need to serve strongly
and hope Stanford's passing issues
continue — even with Tom on the
floor — to have any hope of taking
the match.
"Cal's much better than they
were last year, and they're 9-0,
which means they're walking in
here expecting to win," said Stan
ford coach John Dunning. "It'll be
much more difficult to play them
than it was last year [when Stan
ford beat Cal twice during the sea
son],"
Though none of the Bears' op
ponents this season received any
points in the latest AVCA / USA
Today Coaches Poll, the Bears im
pressively haven't dropped a
game yet this season, taking 27
straight.
Their strong start is largely due
to the stellar play of sophomore
outside hitter Mia Jerkov. The
Croatian national is hitting .301
and averaging an astounding 5.85
kills per game while also leading
the team in aces.
"Every team has a good player
that gets a lot of focus," Robinson
said. "We just have to get a good
block up on her and keep our de
fense up. We're excited to have

another home match."
Cal has held its opponents to an
.095 hitting percentage this year,
but the Bears have yet to the face
the likes of Stanford's attackers.
All-American freshman outside
hitter Ogonna Nnamani is leading
the way for Stanford with 4.13 kills
per game. Junior middle blocker
Sara McGee is hitting a team-high
.470 with 3.43 kills per game, and
senior outside hitters Ashley Ivy
and Lindsey Yamasaki are averag
ing nearly three kills per game
each.
Jerkov and the other Bear hit
ters also haven't faced a block as
tough as Stanford's yet this year.
Four Cardinal starters are averag
ing over a block a game.
No. 14 Pepperdine (7-4) will
come to Maples Pavilion on Satur
day for Stanford's last nonconfer
ence match until late October.
At the start of the season, most
expected this to be the Cardinal's
second contest with the Waves,
with the first supposed to have
come in the finals of the season
opening NACWAA / State Farm
Classic.
But there Pepperdine fell to a
surprisingly strong Golden Go
pher team on the first day of the
tournament, preventing a meet
ing with the Cardinal.
A loss to No. 7 Northern lowa
the next day set the tone for
what's been a disappointing year
so far in Malibu. Pepperdine was
ranked eighth in the preseason
poll and was expected to take a
spot among the nation's elite
teams this year.
Instead, the Waves dropped
their fourth match of the season to
unranked Notre Dame on Satur
day.
"When you're new to the ex
pectation game, where you have
to live with the idea that you're not
going to surprise people when you
play good, it can be tough," Dun
ning said. "Once they figure it out,
they'll be dangerous. They got off
to a bad start, but they're playing
pretty well right now."
