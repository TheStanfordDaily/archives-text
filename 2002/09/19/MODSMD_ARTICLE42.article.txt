# Card begins defense of NCAA title
## 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
There's good news and bad news for the
311 Division I women's volleyball pro
grains that didn't win the national champi
onship last year.
The bad news is that Stanford, the team
that did win it, is even better this year in
just about every aspect of its game.
The good news is that the Cardinal (8-1)
is still among the mortals — at least when it
isn't playing its best volleyball. That much
was apparent in No. 4 Stanford's sloppy 3-
0 loss to No. 3 Florida (7-1) on Saturday at
the Campus USA Credit Union Invitation
al in Gainsville.
Though the loss snapped a 27-match
winning streak and knocked Stanford out
of the top spot in the polls for the first time
this season, a good case can be made for
putting an asterisk next to the result.
That's because three-time Ail-American
outside hitter Logan Tom, last year's Na
tional Player of the Year, wasn't in uniform
for the Cardinal. Instead, she was wearing
Team USA's colors in Germany, driving
the U.S. national team's surprising run to
the silver medal at the World Champi
onships.
Tom did play in Stanford's first two
matches of the season in late August at the
NACWAA/State Farm Classic in Minneso
ta, where the Cardinal posted convincing
wins over No. 7 Northern lowa
and No. 8 Minnesota.
Since then, Tom's spot on the
leit side has been filled by fifth-year
senior Lindsey Yamasaki, who sur
prised many by returning to the
Cardinal alter a two-year absence
from the volleyball.
After playing volleyball and
basketball her first two years at
Stanford — she redshirted on the
volleyball team in 1998 — Ya
masaki chose to focus on just the
latter for the next two years. She
was drafted by the Miami Sol of
the WNBA this spring and aver
aged 3.5 points per game in 15
games during her first profession
al season this summer before com
ing back to the Farm to finish her
degree.
"Lindsay's doing this because
she just really wanted to play vol
leyball one more time, so she's got
a great attitude," said Stanford
coach John Dunning, in his second
year at Stanford. "She's been very
positive and team-oriented. She
knows that when Logan comes
back, she's probably going to leave
the court. But she has such a team
attitude, and she's willing to do
anything to make this team bet
ter."
Yamasaki's return has allowed

Stanford to focus more on its de
fense, which needed to be restruc
tured following the graduation of
all three of the team's regularly
playing defensive specialists from
last year.
Stanford has gone through
some bouts of wobbly passing early
in the season, but a triplet of
sophomores have helped put
some of the defensive concerns
largely to rest.
All-American outside hitter
Ogonna Nnamani rarely played in
the back row last season, but her
3.89 kills per game — the highest
average among Pacific-10 Confer
ence freshmen — were enough to
earn her National Freshman of the
Year honors.
She's surpassing that offensive
pace this season, but she's also
playing all the way around the ro
tation this year. In the process, she
has doubled her scariness factor to
opponents by showing that she can
dig as hard as she can hit the ball.
Her 4.13 kills and 2.53 digs per
game both currently lead the Car
dinal.
"Ogonna is at a point where she
wants to do everything better and
add more to her game," Dunning
said. "She's at a stage where she
could really improve from where
she is now because she really wants
to. Not having Logan in the lineup
had a lot more teams focusing on
()gonna, so Logan's return should
make things easier for her."

Sophomore Jennifer Hucke
has emerged as the team's libero,
(lie new back-row-only position in
stituted by the NCAA this year. She
joins sophomore Leahi I fall as the
Cardinal's defensive specialists in
the backcourt, with the pair com
bining for 3.65 digs per game in
the early season.
"The sophomores have been
working very hard," said starting
sophomore setter Anna Robinson.
"They've been doing a lot of serve
receive and defense. They've been
putting in 110 percent and it's pay
ing off."
Dunning continues to focus
heavily on defense and passing,
the Cardinal's weak spots of late, in
practice. That worksjust fine since
the offense is already up to speed
for the most part — even without
the Tom, the team's leading at
tacker the last three years.
Senior outside hitter Ashley Ivy
is looking as good as she ever has,
averaging 2.93 kills per game.
She's already served up 29 aces,
putting her on pace to crush I ere
sa Smith's 16-year-old single-sea
son record.
"Ashley's figured out a lot of
tilings this year. The last two or
three weeks is the best I've ever
seen her play," Dunning said.
"1 ler serve has been really punish
ing teams, even against Florida
when not much else about our
team was doing the same."
Junior middle blocker Sara

McGee is off to a lightening start,
averaging 3.43 kills per game
while hitting a team-high .470.
Last year's blocking leader in the
Pac-1(), McGee is ahead of last sea
son's pace with 1.43 blocks per
game.
Tom returns to the Cardinal
this week just as Stanford begins its
Pacific-10 Conference title de
fense. Tom, who is the first player
ever to play on the U.S. national
team and in the NCAA at the same
year, will help shore up the de
fense and take some of the offen
sive pressure off Nnamani.
"[Tom's] return means every
thing," said Nnamani. "She did
such a great job at the World
Championships, and we know
we're going to be even better with
her back."
As far as most are concerned,
Stanford's season really starts to
morrow when Tom dons her stan
dard number 15 Cardinal jersey
against California at Maples Pavil
ion.
"Just after the Florida loss, we
discussed how one part of our sea
son was ending," said Dunning,
who is the first coach to win na
tional championships at two differ
ent schools (he won two at Pacific
in 1985 and 1986). "With one part
being done, we can now reanalyze
the lineup as we start the next part
and start looking at who we want
to have on the court at the end of
the season."
