On Saturday, the Cardinal
destroyed San Jose State (1-2),
63-26, scoring the most points at
home since 1975. The team re
fused to relent, a trait reminis
cent of the Steve Spurrier teams
at Florida for which Teevens
was co-otfensive coordinator.
However, it took a while be
fore the game reached blowout
status.
In the first half, Stanford (1-
1) was plagued by injuries and
turnovers. On the first drive of
the game, starting junior quar
terback Chris Lewis — playing
in his first game after being sus
pended for the season opener at
Boston College — drove the
team into the Spartan red zone.
But Lewis was intercepted at the
San Jose State 3-yard line, lead
ing to a Spartan field goal.
The game remained close
throughout the first quarter and
into the second, when the Car
dinal took control behind the
play of Lewis, taking a 28-10
lead.
The Spartans stayed alive,
feeding off of Gerald Jones's
three interceptions, and cut the
lead to 28-17 with under two
minutes remaining in the half.
On the Cardinal's ensuing pos
session, Lewis was sacked in the
pocket from the blindside,

knocking the ball out of his
hands. The Spartans recovered
and kicked a field goal to make
the score 28-20 going into the
half. The sack also knocked
Lewis out for the game with a
knee injury.
"It was my first game, so it
had some ups and downs. But I
persevered, and I thought 1 had
a lot of good throws," Lewis said.
In the second half, the Spar
tans came out with a bang,
throwing a pass up the middle
that blew up into a 60-yard
touchdown.
After a failed Spartan two
point conversion, Cardinal
freshman quarterback Kyle
Matter came into the game with
Stanford up by only two points.
The Cardinal offense imme
diately took off on what would
be a 35-0 run. With runs by se
nior fullback Casey Moore,
freshman running back J.R.
Lemon and Matter, the Cardi
nal methodically pounded 65
yards down the field and into
the end zone.
With Matter in the game, the
Cardinal offense played posses
sion football, l hey pounded the
ball upfield with the run and al
lowed Matter to expose the de
fense with both his arm and feet.
Matter finished the game 7-for
-8 for 123 yards and a touch
down.
By the end of the third quar
ter, the Cardinal was up 49-26,
and the game was effectively
over.
"After the Lewis injury, we
told Kyle that he was going to
start the second half and see how
it goes," Teevens said. "He
made some very good decisions.


MATT SAYLES/The Stanford Daily
Redshirt freshman J.R. Lemon scores one of this three touchdowns after
a handoff from redshirt freshman quarterback Kyle Matter. Lemon tal
lied 69 yards on his 17 rushes.
I le was much more relaxed with a
game under his belt. I le saw things
on the field and protected the
ball."
After getting pounded in the
game against Boston College, Mat
ter was able to step his game up
with the help of the offensive line.
In the first game, Matter was
sacked five times. On Saturday, he
was never tackled fora loss, getting
plenty of time to find the open re
ceiver.
Fhe Cardinal also showed ex
cellent depth against the Spar
tans. Both starting senior run
ning back Kerry Carter and start
ing junior wideout Luke Powell
were injured in the game, but
their replacements stepped up to
fill the voids.
Lemon finished the game with
69 yards and three touchdowns,
while the entire receiving corps
shined as seven players had recep
tions. Sophomore Teyo Johnson
had his second excellent game of
the year, catching seven balls for
107 yards and two touchdowns.
The defense also played well,
