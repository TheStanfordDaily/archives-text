# Men dispel all doubt, start season brilliantly

Concerns of off-season injuries
and new starters stepping in for
five departing seniors may have
clouded the mind of Stanford
men's soccer coach Bret Simon
over the summer. But his team's
performance in its first five games

Men's Soccer
Saturday
at. Dartmouth, Sunday

of the season should have slowed
the growth of any gray hairs.
After narrowly escaping an in
spired Saint Mary's squad, 1-0, in
the Cal Legacy Tournament on
Sunday, the top-ranked Cardinal
soccer team travels to the Dart
mouth Tournament this weekend
with a perfect 5-0 record.
Despite its new position at the
top of the nation, junior tri-cap
tain Abe Geiger believes the Car
dinal is still far from its most pol

ished form.
"It's hard to tell 112 rom the scores,
but we haven't been able to put to
gether a full 90 minutes of good
soccer and not fall asleep for
chunks of game," he said. "Down
the road, good teams will punish
us for such lulls."
Although the team is a little
frustrated with its inability to put
together a complete game, the
Cardinal nevertheless has earned
its No. 1 ranking with wins over
then-No. 7 Southern Methodist
and then-No. 14 Portland in the
Bay Area Classic.
In these matchups — against
two of its stillest opponents of the
regular season on paper — the
Cardinal impressively dominated
for the first 80 minutes.
However, as Geiger noted, in
both games the squad almost gave
the match away by presenting too
many good scoring opportunities
in the waning minutes.
Against SMU, Stanford built a
commanding 3-0 lead off senior
All-American forward Roger
Levesque's goal and two assists.
With eight minutes left and a Stan
ford victory almost certain, the
sometimes-fickle nature of soccer
bit the Cardinal as the Mustangs
were able to rally off two late goals
in a brave comeback attempt.
"It's always good to beat a top
-10 team," Geiger said. "However,
being up 3-0 with less than 10 min
utes left, we have to do a better job
of killing the game and not making
the final moments nail-biting ones.
Giving up those two goals at the
end left a bad taste in our mouths.
Also, we did not play the kind of at
tractive attacking soccer that we
pride ourselves on."
In its second big test of the sea
son, the Cardinal did a much bet
ter job in keeping powerful Port
land out of the back of the net for
a satisfying 2-0 victory.
With junior striker Matt
Janusz scoring his second goal of
the year and junior midfielder
Mike Wilson notching his team
leading third goal, Stanford
handed Portland its second loss of
the young season.
Despite its third shutout of the
season, the Cardinal was close to
letting up a few scores at the end
of the match, even after Portland
was forced to play with only 10
players.
Part of the reason for why
Stanford has managed to escape
these chances from the opposing
team has been the play of the
squad's goalkeeper duo of senior
Andrew Terris and sophomore
Robert Fulton. The two have only
given up four goals combined in
five games.
One of their shutouts came in
the team's season-opening 5-0
win over lowly Sacramento State.
Despite the lopsided score, it

was clear to the fans in the first
half that the Cardinal had some
cobwebs to brush aside.
The team looked sloppy at
times, and it was only its oppo
nent's much weaker technical and
team skills that allowed the Cardi
nal to pile up so many goals.
.After its two thrilling matches
against SMU and Portland, Stan
ford hit the road for the first time
all season for games against Den
ver and St. Mary's last weekend.
Most, including Geiger, agree
that Denver has thus far been the
Cardinal's best effort all year. De
spite letting in two late goals
again, Stanford was never really
threatened with four goals in
hand at the 60-minute mark of
the match.
Levesque was the man of the
match with five points, coming
from a goal and three assists. The
Pacific-10 Conference Player of
the Week during the week of
Sept. 8 now has a team-leading 11
points and team-high seven as
sists.
Wilson is the leading goal scor
er with four. The Levesque-Wil
son combination has become
rather familiar to Cardinal oppo
nents as Levesque assisted two of
Wilson's scores. Wilson has espe
cially shown his ability to score
from the midfield position, which
is something that the Cardinal
lost with the graduation of the of
fensive-minded Derek Shanahan
last year.
The match against Saint
Mary's on Sunday was much clos
er than it should have been. De
spite the poor field conditions,
Stanford managed to control the
play in the midfield enough to
post the shutout. The low score
was a result of the Cardinal front
line inability to finish off several
scoring chances.
According to Geiger, the path
to the NCAAs from now on will
only be a continuing uphill climb
because of the Cardinal's designa
tion as the top team in the nation.

With tougher non-conference
teams such as Santa Clara and
Pac-10 rivals like UCLA and
Washington down the road, the
Cardinal will be a marked team.
Willi the Cardinal coming of!
its five wins without any signifi
cant injuries, it enters the meat of
its schedule with confidence and
continuing improvement.
One of its biggest questions of
the year was how it would react to
the loss of graduating Ail-Ameri
can defenders Lee Morrison and
Aaron Biddle. Simon was faced
with having to find players to fill
the shoes of two of collegiate soc
cer's best defenders.
Giving up only four goals in
five games, the defense, anchored
by veteran seniors Todd Duni
vant and Taylor Graham on one
side, has so far responded well. A
number of players have been fill
ing in for Morrison and Biddle,
including freshman sensations
Chad Marshall and Bronson Mc-
Donald and senior Taylor
Ahlgren.
Along with Geiger, the ex
tremely lit senior johanes Maliza
has shown capability in directing
most of the traffic in the midfield.
Besides the St. Mary's match,
the Cardinal has shown very little
trouble in tallying goals, and
much of this is courtesy of strong
play up front with Levesque and
the ever-improving Janusz.
The Dartmouth Tournament
shouldn't bring any serious
threats to Stanford, which goes
up against weaker Dartmouth
and Richmond squads.
The team returns home the
following weekend for the Stan
ford / Nike Invitational featuring
Tulsa and highly-touted Santa
Clara
As long as Stanford is able to
avoid the injury bug, its high team
spirit and spectacular individual
talents give the Cardinal every
thing it needs to make a second
straight appearance in the NCAA
Final Four.
