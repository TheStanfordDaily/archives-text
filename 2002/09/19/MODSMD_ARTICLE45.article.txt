# Breaking up is hard to do

Dear Tyrone,
OK, so it's been over nine months. Maybe
I needed a little more time than everybody
else. It's one thing to say goodbye when we're
not here, when we still have a bad taste in our mouth
after a disappointing loss in a bowl game. It's quite an
other when we see you sporting those other colors with
that grim l<x)k upon your face we've seen a thousand
times, through lx>th agony and ecstasy.
For me, the time has finally come.
The rumors came and went all the time, but circum
stances always seemed to get in the way. So maybe we
got a little smug, a little overconfident. The Bengals or
the Colts? Please. Even when the C iolden Doiners came

looking to save face, we still felt self-as
sured.
Who'd really want to leave Stan
ford anyway, especially to go to some
town in northern Indiana where
they'll hang you by the toes fora
missed extra point?
Seven years of working together will
do that to a fiui. And yes, working to
gether is an apt way of describing it, in
my mind. Every time the other students

and I trooped over to Stanford Stadium, we did our best
to make life hell for the enemy. We <ill looked on, usually
only seeing your back, but knowing that cool demeanor
had to lx_* gnawing at the opposition just a little bit.
The never-ending turmoil at other schools just made
us appreciate you even more. No player in his right
mind would stand up and spout off in front of that in
timidating glare, unless he had a death wish. You gave
our program an identity, one in which Stanford stu
dents, alumni and fans everywhere took immense
pride.

We did have some g<xxl times, though, didn't we?
Four Ixjwl games in seven years isn't ux> bad for the
Farm, when recruiting is often jumping through one
liery hoop after another. Destroying Michigan Suite in
the Sun Howl, 38-0? Man, that was fun. And that Rose
Bowl year .. . yeah, we did lose to Wisconsin 17-9, but
that Cardinal team had enough heart to last another 30
years, or at least until our next postseason trip to
Pasadena.
I'm not going to lie and say there wasn't friction now
and then. Calling your offense conservative at times
would be a little generous, and you might have been just
a little too loyal to some of your players — particularly
of the pass-dropping, tackle-missing variety. And it's re
ally a shame that most people never saw the wise-crack
ing, snarky side that found itself buried under that stern
visage and droning monotone.
But now you've got Touchdown Jesus, and the Grot
to and a few thousand would-be coaches who will accept
nothing less than that fabled national championship —
something you never got a sniff of in Palo Alto.
That's OK. Now we've got Buddy, and while we're
still just getting to know each other, the signs are there.
1 lis boys took care ofSan Jose State last Saturday, some
thing that always gave you trouble until last year. And
Chris and Teyo should be primed to explode over the
next two seasons. He's great at dealing with the fans,
and isn't afraid to have a little fim with the media.
There could be a real future with this guy. So let's say
adios to the past. After all, it's been long enough.
Goodbye, Tyrone. And good luck at Notre Dame —
you're gonna need it October 5.

Tim Kane is a senior who hopes to enjoy both a Stanford victo
ry and a (Hants playoff win on a forthcoming Saturday in Oc
tober. You can e-mail him at tim.kane@stanford.edu.
