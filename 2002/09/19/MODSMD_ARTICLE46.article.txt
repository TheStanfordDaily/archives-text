# Stanford's commercial failure
## 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford. Winners in the classroom. Winners
on the field. Ridiculously big losers when it
conies to making commercials. There are few
times that I'm ever not proud to be a Stanford
student. Maybe when I'm at a party at somewhere like
UC-Santa Barbara, and it comes out that I go to Stan
ford, or maybe when 1 show visiting friends our "Stu
dent Union" on campus.
But those are just brief flashes of embarrassment,
nothing that can't just be shrugged off.
Nothing like the total mortification 1 feel when I
see Stanford's promotional commercial during Car
dinal games on TV.
Somewhere along the line, the NCIAA seems to
have decided that networks have to give each school
playing in a televised game a commercial slot to pro
mote itself.
Most schools make the most of their air time. In 30
seconds, the University of Miami convinces you that it
is the place to go if you're an undergraduate interest
ed in one day winning a Nobel prize in chemistry or
physics. San Jose State gets you to believe (fiat no
school around here is going to land you a better job.
USC makes it look like there couldn't possibly be a
better place fora college to be located than South-
Central Los Angeles.
But then there's our commercial. Apparently
Stanford's aim is to convince you that Miami is a
better place to go for academics, San Jose State is a
better place to go to further your career potential
and USC is a better place to go fora safe, scenic
campus.
Bottom line: We have the worst commercial in the

country. Millions of people each week see it and
know. And Stanford followers are forced to hang
their heads in disgrace every time the Cardinal is on
TV.
Those of you who have seen this commercial —
and you've had plenty of opportunities since they've
been using roughly the same spot for at least three
years — are probably riled up just thinking about.
Vou know how bad that impending humiliation
feels when the other school's commercial comes on
during a game, and you know that Stanford's 30 sec
onds of shame are fast approaching.
You cringe at that first scene of exciting sports ac
tion that looks like it was filmed by Muhammad Ali
while he was standing at approximately the worst pos
sible place to see what was going on.
You start to turn red as you watch the scene of
Douglas OsherofFs physics class—clearly filmed with
a camcorder — applauding its teacher. We are told
that Osherofl is a Nobel Prize winner, apparently in
paper shuffling since that's all we see him doing at the
front of the class.
You start wondering whether you made the right
decision coming to Stanford when you then see those
two incredibly un-fun-looking guys at Commence
ment, circa 1995. They're shaking hands, likely con
gratulating each other for making it through Stan
ford without ever leaving their rooms.
All this with the absolute worst recording of "All
Right Now" they could find playing in the back
ground, just barely overshadowing the sound of your
head hitting your hands in disbelief.
The whole spot has the nerve to end with that
phrase in the first line of this column. Just to think of
the audacity of ending a commer
cial like that with the word "win
ner" being emphasized . . . I'm
choking on my own rage here.
No mention of Stanford's eight
consecutive Sears Cups. No shots
of (he Farm in all its splendor.

Nothing at all indicative of Stan
ford's second-to-none athletic and
academic reputations.
No room for such things among
bad production values, terrible
audio and a complete lack of sub
stance.
As much as it boggles the mind
that Stanford could have the worst
commercial in America in the first
place, it's just as unthinkable that
nothing lias been done about it all

these years.
Where are the rich, powerful
alumni waving their checkbooks so
Stanford could make itself a real
commercial? Where is the out
raged group of students stalking
the outside of Athletic Director
Ted Leland's office with torches
and pitchforks demanding a re
spectable advertisement to repre
sent us?
Let this be a call to action, Stan

ford Faithful. Let your voices be
heard to the Athletic Department.
Make those calls. Send those e
mails.
We shall be commercial failures
no more.
