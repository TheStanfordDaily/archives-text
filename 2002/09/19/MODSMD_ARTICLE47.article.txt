# Are you ready for some football?
## 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN STAFF WRITER 
The freshmen are returning to
campus with their red-string
neck-tags. T he first full moon of
the year is right around the cor
ner, and soon most of the campus will have
some form of mono.
Parents are everywhere, and you have
to drive around for at least 20 minutes to
find a parking spot.
Fall Quarter is starting at Stanford, but
in college football the season has been
going for almost a month.
A lot has happened in the first four
weeks of the season. And it's understand
able if, in the hustle of returning to cam
pus, you haven't been able to pay atten
tion.
So I thought I'd help out those who've
been TV-less, Internet-less and totally cut
off from what really matters in college life
by catching you up on some of the more
interesting happenings.
• Sadly, College football still doesn't
have playoffs. Yes, I too would have much
rather watched Miami-Oregon last Janu
ary. While I enjoyed watching Miami line
backer Jonathon Vilma crushing the Ne
braska players, the Cornhuskers did not
deserve to be in the game. Everyone knew
Oregon was the second best team in the

nation, and it should've had the chance to
lose to the Hurricanes instead.
Nevertheless, the BCS system remains
intact. 1 wouldn't be surprised if none of
the teams finish the season undefeated, so
I'm already looking forward to watching
lopsided bowl games as the best teams in
the nation bureaucratically avoid playing
each other for the national championship.
• Most schools are playing 12 games
this season. This is due to a quirk in the cal
endar that allows an extra week in the foot
ball season, and most schools have taken
advantage of it for the all important moola
that comes from playing an extra game.
Nebraska, among others, could end up
playing 15 games with preseason, confer
ence championship and bowl games
tacked on.
However, Stanford has elected to play
only 11 games, and I commend the De
partment of Athletics for that decision.
The department turned down profits to
allow the athletes to maintain their stand
ing as student athletes. Another game
would have put a serious strain on the
players' academic responsibilities, and it's
good to see that Stanford means it when it
says that academics come first here.
• Wouldn't it be cool if before every
class you got an "expected" grade that the
professor thought you would earn? Then
as the class progressed, you could deviate

from that grade? Sounds great — if the
professor expected you to get an A. But
the system would stink if you were "sup
posed" to get a 1).
That's pretty much how the preseason
polls operate. The polls are great fora
school like No. 18 Nebraska, which was
crushed by Penn State and remained in
the top 20. Or how about Colorado, which
lost to Colorado State but stayed ranked
above the Rams the next week. Preseason
polls cause future rankings to be based on
expectations rather than results.
I know 1 would hate that uphill battle in
class. I get tired enough as it is just biking
there.
• "Oh my god, what is that in the sky?
It's too big to be a bird. Wait! It's ... a fly
ing PIG! Oh my God!"
California is 3-0, dominating its oppo
nents.
Last week the Golden Bears destroyed
No. 15 Michigan State, 46-22. What in the
world? They have primarily the same
team as last year, but a new coach in Jeff
Tedford. Though I hate to say it, you have
to give him credit for the job he has done.
Big Game should be a good game this
season — maybe too good of a game —
and I wouldn't miss it for the world. But
don't forget that Cal is still Cal: Eventually
it will revert to its losing ways. That is, un
less hell is expecting to host the Olympic

winter games in 200(3.
• Speaking of coaching changes, I have
to mention Ty. With Tyrone Willingham
at the helm, Notre Dame has won its first
three games, rising to No. 12 in the nation.
I know you may hate him for leaving,
but give him some credit. 1 le has gone into
a program that has been struggling on and
off the field the last few years and lias al
ready made them believe that they can

win. In less than a month!
And we certainly owe him a debt of
gratitude here. He turned Stanford into a
regular Pacific-10 Conference contender
and raised expectations all around the
Farm. You think Stanford fans would've
grumbled over a 1-1 start before he got
here?

Redshirt freshman quarterback Kyle Matter scrambles for his second rushing touchdown of
the season in Stanford's 63-26 win over San Jose State on Saturday.
Of course, 1 hope we unmerci
fully destroy the Irish on Oct. 5. I
wish him the best of luck in the rest
of his games.
• Give Buddy some time to
make this Cardinal team his own.
While Teevens is already bringing
some of his own personality to this
team, it will take a few years for
him to really give the team his own
personal stamp. I think he is a
great fit for this school and that the
future of Stanford football looks
bright, starting next Saturday
against Arizona State.
• Finally, a message to the luke
warm football fans: Enjoy the sea
son.
College football is a beautiful
thing, as every Saturday each
school lays it all out on the field.
We onlv have a few years to really

be a part of it until we are off to
other places, where we may have
to look up the Stanford team on
ihe Internet without knowing a
single player.
College football gives me that
perfect break on Saturday. As I try
to choose a major, and potentially
a career, it is easy to feel swamped
by the pressures on the Farm. On
Saturday afternoons, I leave all of
that at the door. Stanford Stadium
is my sanctuary, where 1 can allow
myself a break and have some fun.
Watching football, everything just
feels right — that is, until a stupid
zebra makes a bad call.
Enjoy the chance to just be a
stupid, angry and ecstatic fan —
there is no better feeling in the
world.

single player.
College football gives me that
perfect break on Saturday. As I try
to choose a major, and potentially
a career, it is easy to feel swamped
by the pressures on the Farm. On
Saturday afternoons, I leave all of
that at the door. Stanford Stadium
is my sanctuary, where 1 can allow
myself a break and have some fun.
Watching football, everything just
feels right — that is, until a stupid
zebra makes a bad call.
Enjoy the chance to just be a
stupid, angry and ecstatic fan —
there is no better feeling in the
world.

The freshmen are returning to
campus with their red-string
neck-tags. T he first full moon of
the year is right around the cor
ner, and soon most of the campus will have
some form of mono.
Parents are everywhere, and you have
to drive around for at least 20 minutes to
find a parking spot.
Fall Quarter is starting at Stanford, but
in college football the season has been
going for almost a month.
A lot has happened in the first four
weeks of the season. And it's understand
able if, in the hustle of returning to cam
pus, you haven't been able to pay atten
tion.
So I thought I'd help out those who've
been TV-less, Internet-less and totally cut
off from what really matters in college life
by catching you up on some of the more
interesting happenings.
• Sadly, College football still doesn't
have playoffs. Yes, I too would have much
rather watched Miami-Oregon last Janu
ary. While I enjoyed watching Miami line
backer Jonathon Vilma crushing the Ne
braska players, the Cornhuskers did not
deserve to be in the game. Everyone knew
Oregon was the second best team in the

nation, and it should've had the chance to
lose to the Hurricanes instead.
Nevertheless, the BCS system remains
intact. 1 wouldn't be surprised if none of
the teams finish the season undefeated, so
I'm already looking forward to watching
lopsided bowl games as the best teams in
the nation bureaucratically avoid playing
each other for the national championship.
• Most schools are playing 12 games
this season. This is due to a quirk in the cal
endar that allows an extra week in the foot
ball season, and most schools have taken
advantage of it for the all important moola
that comes from playing an extra game.
Nebraska, among others, could end up
playing 15 games with preseason, confer
ence championship and bowl games
tacked on.
However, Stanford has elected to play
only 11 games, and I commend the De
partment of Athletics for that decision.
The department turned down profits to
allow the athletes to maintain their stand
ing as student athletes. Another game
would have put a serious strain on the
players' academic responsibilities, and it's
good to see that Stanford means it when it
says that academics come first here.
• Wouldn't it be cool if before every
class you got an "expected" grade that the
professor thought you would earn? Then
as the class progressed, you could deviate

from that grade? Sounds great — if the
professor expected you to get an A. But
the system would stink if you were "sup
posed" to get a 1).
That's pretty much how the preseason
polls operate. The polls are great fora
school like No. 18 Nebraska, which was
crushed by Penn State and remained in
the top 20. Or how about Colorado, which
lost to Colorado State but stayed ranked
above the Rams the next week. Preseason
polls cause future rankings to be based on
expectations rather than results.
I know 1 would hate that uphill battle in
class. I get tired enough as it is just biking
there.
• "Oh my god, what is that in the sky?
It's too big to be a bird. Wait! It's ... a fly
ing PIG! Oh my God!"
California is 3-0, dominating its oppo
nents.
Last week the Golden Bears destroyed
No. 15 Michigan State, 46-22. What in the
world? They have primarily the same
team as last year, but a new coach in Jeff
Tedford. Though I hate to say it, you have
to give him credit for the job he has done.
Big Game should be a good game this
season — maybe too good of a game —
and I wouldn't miss it for the world. But
don't forget that Cal is still Cal: Eventually
it will revert to its losing ways. That is, un
less hell is expecting to host the Olympic

winter games in 200(3.
• Speaking of coaching changes, I have
to mention Ty. With Tyrone Willingham
at the helm, Notre Dame has won its first
three games, rising to No. 12 in the nation.
I know you may hate him for leaving,
but give him some credit. 1 le has gone into
a program that has been struggling on and
off the field the last few years and lias al
ready made them believe that they can

win. In less than a month!
And we certainly owe him a debt of
gratitude here. He turned Stanford into a
regular Pacific-10 Conference contender
and raised expectations all around the
Farm. You think Stanford fans would've
grumbled over a 1-1 start before he got
here?

Redshirt freshman quarterback Kyle Matter scrambles for his second rushing touchdown of
the season in Stanford's 63-26 win over San Jose State on Saturday.
Of course, 1 hope we unmerci
fully destroy the Irish on Oct. 5. I
wish him the best of luck in the rest
of his games.
• Give Buddy some time to
make this Cardinal team his own.
While Teevens is already bringing
some of his own personality to this
team, it will take a few years for
him to really give the team his own
personal stamp. I think he is a
great fit for this school and that the
future of Stanford football looks
bright, starting next Saturday
against Arizona State.
• Finally, a message to the luke
warm football fans: Enjoy the sea
son.
College football is a beautiful
thing, as every Saturday each
school lays it all out on the field.
We onlv have a few years to really

be a part of it until we are off to
other places, where we may have
to look up the Stanford team on
ihe Internet without knowing a
single player.
