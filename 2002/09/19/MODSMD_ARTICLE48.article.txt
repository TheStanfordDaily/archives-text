# Boston College bests Card in season opener
## Without starter Chris Lewis, Cardinal falls to Eagles on last-minute touchdown 
### MATT LONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford football held a 27-17 lead
late in the third quarter, but lost 34-27 at
Boston College on Sept. 7, spoiling new
head coach Buddy Teevens's debut.
Playing without starting junior quarter

back Chris Lewis, who was serving a one
game NCAA suspension, Teevens was
forced to tone down his highly-touted
pass-first offense, yet Stanford still man
aged a solid three quarters against the
Golden Eagles.
Redshirt freshman Kyle Matter complet
ed 17 of 27 passes for 244 yards in his first
collegiate game and rushed fora 10-yard
touchdown in the second quarter to give the
Cardinal a 17-7 edge.
Sophomore wideout Teyo Johnson
caught four first-half passes, including a
seven-yard touchdown. Johnson was a rel

ative nonfactor in the second half because
he was often double covered. Even when
Matter managed to avoid the heavy pass
rush, he couldn't find his most dependable
target.
"In the first half we came out and really
executed offensively, executed our game
plan and we had a couple of big plays," said
Matter. "I give a lot of credit to Boston Col
lege. They made some good adjustments at
halftime, and we just didn't get the job done
in the second half like we should have."
Derrick Knight led BC with 104 yards
rushing, with his most important carry, a 12-

yard touchdown scamper, coming with 36
seconds left in the tied contest.
The young Cardinal defense looked im
pressive at times, most notably the play of
sophomore cornerback Leigh I orrence (2
interceptions) and redshirt freshman line
backer Michael Craven, who returned an
interception 33 yards fora third quarter
score.
"Overall 1 thought our guys came and
played hard," Teevens said. "A lot of guys
played young and made some mistakes
across the board, but the effort level was
there."
