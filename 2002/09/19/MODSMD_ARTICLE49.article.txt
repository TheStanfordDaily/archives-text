# Pacific-10 proving itself as nation's deepest football conference
## 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
It would be no easy task to top
the electrifying 2001 season that
saw the Pacific-10 Conference
send five schools to bowl games
and produce the nation's second
best team in Oregon. So far,
though, Pac-10 football has been
even better this year.
Six of its 10 teams are ranked
in the AP Top 25, and the confer
ence boasts a 22-4 overall record.
The conference went 8-1 last
week, including 2-1 against
ranked opponents.
As the non-conference season
winds down, it is once again clear
that this year's Pac-10 is full of
high-octane offenses and talent
ed, if sometimes exasperated, de
fenses. In the fast-paced, back
and-forth play that characterizes
so many Pac-10 contests, winning
the turnover battle and capitaliz
ing on special teams figures to be
especially important.
Regardless of how the Pac-10
does against itself, though, it has
the leg up on the rest of the na
tion. No other conference has
more top-25 teams than the Pac
10's six, and no conference has
fewer losses: The eight-team Big
East is the closest, with eight total

losses.
Last weekend's Pac-10 slate
was highlighted by No. 23 Cali
fornia (3-0), which jumped out to
a 25-0 halftime lead in a shocking
46-22 road win over then-No. 15
Michigan State (2-1). Cal quarter
back Kyle Boiler caught a touch
down, ran fora touchdown and
threw for two more.
The Bears' defense and special
teams did their part with a safety,
punt return fora touchdown, two
interceptions and three fumble
recoveries. Michigan State be
came the highest-ranked team
Cal has beaten since it knocked
off No. 14 Illinois way back in
1974. The Bears are ranked for
the first time since 1996, when
current San Francisco 49ers
coach Steve Mariucci was at the
helm.
Picked to finish last in the Pac
-10 by a wide margin in the pre
season media poll, Cal finds itself
amongst the top 25 teams in the
nation after three dominating
wins. The Bears started the year
with a 70-22 thrashing of Baylor
and a 34-13 victory over New
Mexico State, both in Berkeley.
Under first-year coach Jeff
Tedford, Cal — which scored the
fewest points in the Pac-10 last
year (18.3) and allowed the most

(39.2) en route to a winless Pac-10
campaign and a 1-10 overall
record — has revamped its of
fense and hasjumped from 114 th
to 2nd nationally in turnover dif
ferential.
It will be interesting to see how
the Bears are doing by Nov. 23,
when they host Stanford in both
schools' last game of the year. Re
gardless of Cal's record, the Big
Game will be its last contest of the
season: The Bears are barred
from participating in a bowl game
this year for NCAA violations
ranging from academic fraud to
unauthorized hotel charges be
tween 1997 and 2001.
Cal wasn't the only Pac-10
school to surprise a favored op
ponent last weekend. No. 1 1
Southern California (2-0) walked
into Boulder and embarrassed
then-No. 18 Colorado (1-2), 40-3.
USC's defense, which allowed
the fewest points in the Pac-10
last year, held Colorado to a
measly four first downs, as the
Buffaloes' frighteningly inaccu
rate quarterbacks Robert Hodge
and Zac Colvin completed two of
13 passes for 24 yards. The
ground game proved no better
for the Buffs, netting 37 yards on
35 carries.
Sultan McCuHough ran for

1 10 yards, and Carson Palmer
passed for 244 to lead the Trojan
attack. USC, always hard to score
upon, is especially dangerous
when its offense gets in gear.
No. 16 Washington State (2-1)
came up short in Columbus, Ohio
against No. 6 Ohio State (3-0),
losing a 7-6 halftime lead en
route to a 25-7 defeat. Freshman
phenom Maurice Clarett was
held to only 36 yards rushing in
the first half. But he busted loose
in the second half, ending up
with 230 yards on the afternoon,
raising questions about Washing
ton State's run defense.
Cougar QB Jason Cesser, a
Heisman hopeful, finished 25-of
-44 passing for 247 yards, but was
picked off twice in the second
half. That, combined with a
ground game that totaled only 17
yards on the ddy, spelled defeat
for Washington State.
The Cougars, who looked
tough against pedestrian Nevada
and Idaho teams, gets another
patsy when Division I-AA also
ran Montana State (2-1) comes to
Pullman this weekend.
The rest of the conference out
gunned unranked opponents,
with Stanford's (1-1) 63-26 win
over San Jose State (1-2) being
the most explosive victory.
No. 9 Oregon (3-0) overpow
ered visiting Idaho (0-3) after a
slow start, winning 58-21 despite
holding the ball fora mere 21:10.
Oregon tailback Onterrio Smith's
104 yards and three touchdowns
led the way, and with Smith in the
backfield, quarterback Jason Fife
has thus far been able to do a pret
ty nice imitation of former Duck
and current Detroit Lion Joey
Harrington.
The Ducks have played a rela
tively challenging schedule thus
far, having already faced Missis
sippi State and Fresno State.
Their explosive offense will likely
run amok against a visiting Divi
sion I-AA opponent, Portland
State (2-0).
No. 20 UCLA (2-0) rode its de
fense to a 38-24 triumph over Ok
lahoma State (1-2) in Stillwater,
Okla. Bruin QB Cory Pans passed
for three scores and ran for anoth
er, and the UCIA defense pro
duced five turnovers, allowing the
Bruins to win comfortably despite
their spotty defense letting the
Cowboys racking up 446 yards of
total offense.
UCIA, which outlasted Col
orado State 30-19 in its season
opener, gets another stiff test when

it hosts an angry Colorado team
this weekend.
Oregon State QB Derek Ander
son completed 20-of-26 passes for
356 yards and tied a school record
with five TD tosses as the Beavers
pasted UNLV (1-2), 47-17, in Cor
vallis. The sophomore also ran for
a score and has led the Beavers to
a 3-0 record and the edge of the
top 25 poll with blowout wins over
Eastern Kentucky and Temple.
On Saturday, a solid Fresno State
team will probably give Oregon
State more of a challenge.
Arizona (2-0) held on fora 23-
17 victory over Utah (2-1) in flic
son, Ariz., as Jason Johnson
passed for 416 yards and a pair of
scores and Shawn Keel booted
three field goals. This weekend,
the Wildcats will tussle with No. 22
Wisconsin (4-0).
Arizona State (3-1) came from
behind to top San Diego State (0-3)
39-28. Trailing 22-0 in the second
quarter, the Sun Devils put in
backup QB Andrew Walter, whose

first pass went fora 72-yard score.
He threw four I Ds — all to Shawn
McDonald — to lead the come
back.
Arizona State and Arizona were
both picked to finish near the bot
tom of the Par-10 but have looked
good in the preseason.
Like Stanford, Arizona State
has a bye this weekend, then will
host the Cardinal on Sept. 28.
No. 13 Washington (1 -1), which
had a bye last weekend, hosts
Wyoming on Saturday. The
Huskies are the only Pac-10 pro
gram Stanford will not face this
year, which is just as well for the
Cardinal, which was unable to
keep up with Washington in their
meeting last year.
Outside of the Pac-10, former
Stanford coach Tyrone Willing
ham led No. 12 Notre Dame (3-0)
to yet another big win, taking
down then-No. 0 Michigan 25-
23. Stanford travels to South
Bend on Oct. 5 fora can't-miss
bout with the Fighting Irish.

remains Stanford's leading receiver through two games.
