### MARK DOMINIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
Washington insiders, acade
mics and Silicon Valley executives
who met at Stanford yesterday
agreed on at least one issue in the
war on terror: cyberspace is an
area of extreme vulnerability in
the United States.
A panel of 21 industrialists, top
government officials and intellec
tuals gathered at Kresge Auditori
um to unveil the White House's
new National Strategy to Secure
Cyberspace. The plan is the result
of a year-long collaboration be
tween the public and private sec
tors, coordinated by Richard
Clarke, the chairman of the Presi
dent's Critical Infrastructure Pro
tection Board, and Howard
Schmidt, his vice chairman.
Fhe strategy's basic premise is
that the most effective way to secure
cyberspace is to urge individual cit
izens to protect their private por
tions of tlie web. It calls for citizens
to choose less-predictable pass
words, to establish firewalls, to exe
cute regular virus checks and to
carefully monitor software issues, so
that the nation's overall cybersecu
rity can be maintained.
Speakers ranging from FBI Di
rector Robert Mueller to Margaret

Purely, Canada's associate deputy
defense minister, gave five-minute
talks explaining their conclusions
and the outlook for the future.
Undersecretary of Commerce
Kenneth (uster portrayed cyberse
curity as a critical aspect of home
land security. I le drew a distinction
between national security and
homeland security, explaining that
the former requires military and
CIA coordination to protect the
United States from a visible enemy,
whereas the latter requires individ
uals to work together to protect the

whole country.
White House requests feedback
The strategy will be posted on
line for 60 days for public com
ment, Clarke said, so that private
corporations and individuals can
ofFer feedback.
"We are providing a draft of the
proposal so that everyone in the
country can see it," Clarke said.
"No one is going to have any
more right to comment on this than
