# Officials unveil cybersecurity plan
## 
### MARK DOMINIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
Washington insiders, acade
mics and Silicon Valley executives
who met at Stanford yesterday
agreed on at least one issue in the
war on terror: cyberspace is an
area of extreme vulnerability in
the United States.
A panel of 21 industrialists, top
government officials and intellec
tuals gathered at Kresge Auditori
um to unveil the White House's
new National Strategy to Secure
Cyberspace. The plan is the result
of a year-long collaboration be
tween the public and private sec
tors, coordinated by Richard
Clarke, the chairman of the Presi
dent's Critical Infrastructure Pro
tection Board, and Howard
Schmidt, his vice chairman.
Fhe strategy's basic premise is
that the most effective way to secure
cyberspace is to urge individual cit
izens to protect their private por
tions of tlie web. It calls for citizens
to choose less-predictable pass
words, to establish firewalls, to exe
cute regular virus checks and to
carefully monitor software issues, so
that the nation's overall cybersecu
rity can be maintained.
Speakers ranging from FBI Di
rector Robert Mueller to Margaret

Purely, Canada's associate deputy
defense minister, gave five-minute
talks explaining their conclusions
and the outlook for the future.
Undersecretary of Commerce
Kenneth (uster portrayed cyberse
curity as a critical aspect of home
land security. I le drew a distinction
between national security and
homeland security, explaining that
the former requires military and
CIA coordination to protect the
United States from a visible enemy,
whereas the latter requires individ
uals to work together to protect the

whole country.
White House requests feedback
The strategy will be posted on
line for 60 days for public com
ment, Clarke said, so that private
corporations and individuals can
ofFer feedback.
"We are providing a draft of the
proposal so that everyone in the
country can see it," Clarke said.
"No one is going to have any
more right to comment on this than

anyone else," he continued. "Every
individual citizen has as much right
as die biggest company to comment
on the proposal.
'This has to be a strategy not im
posed by the federal government,
but shaped by the American peo
ple," he added.
Until last weekend, it appeared
that the proposal unveiled yester
day would be a final draft. The
Washington Post reported that the
60-day comment period was not
originally part of the plan, and that
its addition may have been an at
tempt to get companies to comply
voluntarily with the policy.
Since the plan's suggestions are
nonbinding, panelists tried to en
courage adherence by underscor
ing the gravity of the cyber-threat
facing the nation. "Securi
ty of computing systems has been
a long-term concern heightened
by September 11," University
President John Hennessy said at
the conference.
"The problem with computer
security is that in the race to build
the internet, there has been insuf
ficient attention given to security,"
he added.
New technology breeds new crime
While recent advances in tech
nology have driven economic
growth in the United States, they
have also opened the door to new
and unprecedented types of crime
and terror.
"Entrepreneurs weren't the only
ones who recognized the value of
the internet — criminals did too,"
said Mueller.
The Secret Service lias noticed
that attacks are increasing both in
number and in complexity, accord
ing to Brian Stafford, the director of
the Secret Service.
At the conference, the Secret Ser
vice and the FBI announced a part
nership to target cybersecurity in
several cities. But Mueller stressed

that the Federal government can
not secure cyberspace by itself.
"()ur w M"k must be done togeth
er — the more weak links, the more
vulnerable we all are," he said.
Developing a 'culture of security'
Panelists also addressed the inex
tricable link between cybersecurity
and the global economy.
"The health of U.S. industry is
dependent 011 cybersecurity,"
J uster said. "There is no viable alter
native to partnership of the public
and private sectors."
Purdy stressed that interna
tional cooperation is key to ensur
ing cybersecurity.
"No country, no government,
no entity can address threats to cy
bersecurity alone," she said. "Deal
ing with vulnerabilities demands
seamless cooperation between
governments."
Personal responsibility was a key
issue for Federal Trade Commis
sioner Orson Swindle.
"We need to develop a culture of
security. It's like looking left and
right before crossing the street. We
need to think similarly about online
security," he said.
'Putting locks on the doors'
Clarke compared the current
lack of security in cyberspace to a
crime wave in the real world.
"It is as if we are in a town where
houses are continually being bur
glarized. fhe police investigate all
the crimes and find that there are
no locks on the doors. Should we
just go out and get more cops, or
should we put locks on the doors?"
Clarke said.
"The issue of computer security
is more pressing than in recent
years. Never before has it been so
vital that each of us individually
takes responsibility to secure cyber
space," she said.
"Homeland defense begins in (lie
home," she continued. "Nearly two
thirds of computer users believed it
was highly unlikely that their com
puter would be broken into and
would pose a threat to cybersecurity.
We need to change that."

growth in the United States, they
have also opened the door to new
and unprecedented types of crime
and terror.
"Entrepreneurs weren't the only
ones who recognized the value of
the internet — criminals did too,"
said Mueller.
The Secret Service lias noticed
that attacks are increasing both in
number and in complexity, accord
ing to Brian Stafford, the director of
the Secret Service.
At the conference, the Secret Ser
vice and the FBI announced a part
nership to target cybersecurity in
several cities. But Mueller stressed

that the Federal government can
not secure cyberspace by itself.
"()ur w M"k must be done togeth
er — the more weak links, the more
vulnerable we all are," he said.
Developing a 'culture of security'
Panelists also addressed the inex
tricable link between cybersecurity
and the global economy.
"The health of U.S. industry is
dependent 011 cybersecurity,"
J uster said. "There is no viable alter
native to partnership of the public
and private sectors."
Purdy stressed that interna
tional cooperation is key to ensur
ing cybersecurity.
"No country, no government,
no entity can address threats to cy
bersecurity alone," she said. "Deal
ing with vulnerabilities demands
seamless cooperation between
governments."
Personal responsibility was a key
issue for Federal Trade Commis
sioner Orson Swindle.
"We need to develop a culture of
security. It's like looking left and
right before crossing the street. We
need to think similarly about online
security," he said.
'Putting locks on the doors'
Clarke compared the current
lack of security in cyberspace to a
crime wave in the real world.
"It is as if we are in a town where
houses are continually being bur
glarized. fhe police investigate all
the crimes and find that there are
no locks on the doors. Should we
just go out and get more cops, or
should we put locks on the doors?"
Clarke said.
"The issue of computer security
is more pressing than in recent
years. Never before has it been so
vital that each of us individually
takes responsibility to secure cyber
space," she said.
"Homeland defense begins in (lie
home," she continued. "Nearly two
thirds of computer users believed it
was highly unlikely that their com
puter would be broken into and
would pose a threat to cybersecurity.
We need to change that."
