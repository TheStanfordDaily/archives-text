# Women triumph over turmoil
## 
### MATT BABIN STAFF WRITER 
When the Cardinal women's soccer
squad returned from a preseason Euro
pean tour, it brought back high expecta
tions as a result of its superb play, which
led to a 4-1 record with an amazing 17-4
goal differential.
But the team's spirit for the upcoming
NCAA season took what could've been a
fatal blow two days before its first game
against defending NCAA champion
Santa (Mara.
The San Francisco Chronicle reported
that a witness saw head coach Andy Nel
son shove two players to the ground dur
ing a practice, leading team members to
meet with Department of Athletics offi
cials about Nelson's future with the team.
Nelson resigned the next day lor "per
sonal reasons" according to a Stanford
press release. After a short investigation,
the Santa Clara district attorney's office
decided not to press assault c harges, but
the Cardinal was still left coach-less a day
before facing the top-ranked Broncos.
The whole incident would've derailed
most teams' hopes fora successful season,
but the Cardinal women seem to have
come out of the ordeal stronger as a
group.
Over their first four games of the reg
ular season, the team has demonstrated
that the European tour results were no
fluke, and the team shows no signs of
slowing down.
Fhe combination of a dominant spring
season and its successful international
competition over the summer show that

this year's squad looks to once again be
one of the top teams in collegiate soccer.
The Cardinal has gone a perfect 4-0-0,
allowing just one goal in four games and
rising to No. 2 in the national rankings.
After knocking oil then-No. 1 Santa
Clara 3-0 in the season opener, the Car
dinal faced then-No. 4 Texas A&M. It was
the first meeting between the teams since
the Aggies eliminated Stanford from last
year's NCAA Tournament. This time the
Cardinal prevailed, earning a hard
fought 1 -0 overtime victory behind fresh
man Jennifer Farenbaugh's first colle
giate goal.
Subsequent victories over Texas (1-0)
and St. Mary's ('5-1, behind two goals
from senior Kelsey Carlson) have ce
mented the team's status as one ofthe na
tion's most dangerous squads. It's a posi
tion that the team is used to, having
earned a spot in the NCAA tournament
each of the past four years and 11 of the
last 12.
The success of last year's ninth-ranked
squad, the bumper crop of seven new
freshman and the experience of five re
turning seniors — with 299 game of ex
perience between them — combined to
form a preseason level of respect for the
Cardinal. The Pacific-10 Conference
coaches picked Stanford to finish second
in one of the nation's toughest confer
ences, behind only last year's champion
UCLA
All three Pac-10 schools that began the
year in the top-10 — Stanford, UCLA
and California — remain there three
weeks into the season, setting up a tough
conference schedule for the Cardinal.

Stanford still remembers the disappoint
ment of losing 1-0 to the Bruins at home
in its last conference game of the 2001
season, a defeat that cost the Cardinal the
Pac-10 title.
Stanford will rely on the unity it built
during its trip to Europe in early August.
The team scheduled five games in Eu
rope, winning its first four matches
against V.V. Braakhuizen (Dutch Cham
pions), Eendracht Aalst (Belgian Club
champions), Kapide Wezemaal (Belgian
national champions) and the Dutch na
tional team. In the final match of the tour,
a younger Stanford lineup fell to FCR
Duisburg (German champions).
The team seemed to take no time to
get used to its foreign surroundings, tak
ing its first game 6-0 against V.V.
Braakhuizen. Sophomore Amy Grady
and junior Brittany Oliveira each scored
in the first half'beforejunior Marcie Ward
exploded for two goals of her own after
the half.
The team posted a shutout against
Eendracht Aalst, taking the match 4-0.
The team's veterans led the way in that
one, as senior Marcia Wallis's goal in the
13th minute was followed by two goals
from ()liveira and one from senior Kelsey
Carlson.
I he offense showed no signs of slow
ing down against the Belgian national
champions, finding the back of the net
four times before halftime. Sophomore
Natalie Sanderson notched two goals in
the first 15 minutes.

tougher competition than the Dutch
Club champions, as (he Cardinal
had to battle through their fourth
game of the tour. After a scoreless
first half, the squad was able to sneak
off with the win on account of
Oliveira's fourth goal of the tour.
That was all redshirt sophomore
keeper Nicole Barn hart needed, as
she held the Dutch scoreless for the
duration and gave the Cardinal the
1 -0 victory.
The fifth and final match of the

tour unfortunately handed the
Cardinal its first loss, a 3-1 defeat at
the hands of FCR Duisberg. The
German club team wasted no time
getting started, scoring in the first
minute of play against a young
Stanford team on the pitch.
The Cardinal's success against
professional squads has followed it
back to the Bay Area, where Stan
ford will be playing for the next
three weeks. After hosting the Stan
ford / Nike Invitational this week
end, the Cardinal will take part in
tournaments at Santa Clara and at
Saint Mary's. Stanford then opens
its conference schedule at Southern
California on Oct. 11.
