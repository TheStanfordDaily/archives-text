### MATT BABIN STAFF WRITER 
It's a busy weekend on the
Stanford campus: freshmen oc
cupied with all the activities of
orientation, upperclassmen mov
ing back into their housing —
and the Stanford Women's soccer
team competing in two full days

of soccer at Maloney Field for the
Stanford / Nike Invitational.
The Cardinal is the clear fa
vorite going into play this week
end. The team brings in a per
fect 4-0-0 record and a No. 2 na
tional ranking. Stanford re
mains in the second spot —
which ties the program's liigh
est-ever ranking — for the sec
ond straight week behind North
Carolina (6-0-1).
The Cardinal has risen in the
polls on the back of four quality
matches, including three wins
over top-10 teams. It find itself
among familiar company at the
toj), as three of the top five teams

come from the Pacific-10 Confer
ence: No. 2 Stanford, No. 3
UCLA and No. 5 California.
Following a season-opening
victory over Santa Clara (3-0) on
Aug. 30, the Cardinal knocked
off Texas A&M, 1-0 iti overtime,
and Texas, 1-0. Not until the
fourth game of the season, a 3-1
win over local rival Saint Mary's,
did the Cardinal defense even let
in a goal.
Even so, the first match of the
coming weekend should provide
excellent soccer, as Oklahoma
also brings a 6-0-0 record up
against Stanford at Maloney. At
the tail end of the Sooners' six
match winning streak is a run of
four straight shutouts.
Similar to the Cardinal, the
Sooners have consistently won
with stingy goalkeeping and ex
plosive strikers — all of which
should make the first ever meet
ing oft he teams a fantastic match.
Florida comes to the Farm on
the heels of a tough 2-1 overtime
loss to Duke last weekend. While
the Gators are only 3-3-0 on the
young season, they demonstrat
ed that they are not a team to be
overlooked with their 2-0 victory
over Syracuse last week.
The memories of last year's 3-
2 overtime victory by Stanford at
Florida will also motivate the vis
iting team.
The fourth team at the Invita

tional, Santa Clara, comes to the
Farm just three weeks after
being defeated by Stanford in
Santa Clara for the first time
since 1994 in this year's season
opener. Junior Brittany
Oliveira, junior Marcie Ward
and senior Callie Withers each
scored for the Cardinal against
the Broncos. Three goals were
more than enough for redshirt
sophomore keeper Nicole Barn
hart, whose her five saves kept
the Broncos scoreless.
The combination of excellent
defense — with an average of
under six shots per game allowed
— and sharp goaltending on the
shots that do get through has
stymied all of Stanford's oppo
nents so far. That defense com
bined along with an offensive at
tack featuring nine different
point scorers this season means
that the Cardinal will present a
nasty headache for opposing
coaches.
The weekend will kick off at
Maloney tomorrow at 5:00 p.m.
with Florida taking on Santa
Clara. Stanford will take the pitch
later tomorrow night at 7:30 p.m.
against Oklahoma.
Sunday morning will find all
the teams back on the field, with
Santa (Mara going up against ()k
-lahoma at 11:00 a.m. while Stan
ford closes the day's action
against Florida at 1:00 p.m.
