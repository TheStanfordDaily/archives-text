# Men seek narrowly lost NCAA title

### EMIL MARTINSEK 
As everyone waited for the results of the 2001 NCAA Cross
Country Championships, it appeared that Stanford may
have taken the men's title from then top-ranked Colorado.
But as the score was finalized, it was not to be as the Cardinal
lost to the Buffaloes, 90 to 91, in the closest NCAA race in his
tory.
But that was 2001, and although Stanford returns six of
the seven athletes on last year's team, the attitude is not one
of defeat, but one of challenge and excitement.
The men's team has finished in the top four the last six
years, and this year promises to be no different.
"The men look good and are in good shape," said Vin
Lananna, Stanford's director of cross country and track and
field. "They really have a great attitude and are optimistic
and confident."
With four returning cross country All-Americans, as well
as a handful of track Ail-Americans, the Cardinal has every
reason to be excited after being tabbed at No. 2 in the pre
season rankings.
"The only tiling that will validate or refute the polls is the
race," Lananna said. "There are four very good teams this
year. Any of them could take the title. It is the strongest bal

ance in the last 20 years."
Colorado and Arkansas each return five of their top seven
runners.
Colorado is lead by seniors Jorge Torres, runner-up at the
NCAA Championships a year ago, and Steve Slattery, the
NCAA runner-up in the steeplechase in outdoor track. The
fate of their No. 2 returning runner, 2001 NCAA Freshman
of the Year Dathan Ritzenhein, remains in question after lie
was diagnosed with a stress fracture two weeks ago that has
halted his training.
Arkansas brings the one-two punch of junior Alistair
Cragg, the indoor 5,000 meter champion, and senior Daniel
Lincoln, the outdoor steeplechase champion.
They are helped by returning top-40 finishers Silverus
Kimeli and Jason Sandfordt along with a group of young
middle distance talent.
Wisconsin and Northern Arizona also bring in a good
crop of new runners, while North Carolina State and Notre
Dame have had good early season showings.
Stanford won't be able to rely on one or two runners to
carry the team like Arkansas and Colorado can, but rather
will have to field a full set of runners that can hang near the

The Stanford men will try to break from the pack this year, as they did at last year's Stanford Invitational. Last year's team nar
rowily missed an NCAA title, finishing second by one point to Colorado.
