# Men seek narrowly lost NCAA title
## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK 
As everyone waited for the results of the 2001 NCAA Cross
Country Championships, it appeared that Stanford may
have taken the men's title from then top-ranked Colorado.
But as the score was finalized, it was not to be as the Cardinal
lost to the Buffaloes, 90 to 91, in the closest NCAA race in his
tory.
But that was 2001, and although Stanford returns six of
the seven athletes on last year's team, the attitude is not one
of defeat, but one of challenge and excitement.
The men's team has finished in the top four the last six
years, and this year promises to be no different.
"The men look good and are in good shape," said Vin
Lananna, Stanford's director of cross country and track and
field. "They really have a great attitude and are optimistic
and confident."
With four returning cross country All-Americans, as well
as a handful of track Ail-Americans, the Cardinal has every
reason to be excited after being tabbed at No. 2 in the pre
season rankings.
"The only tiling that will validate or refute the polls is the
race," Lananna said. "There are four very good teams this
year. Any of them could take the title. It is the strongest bal

ance in the last 20 years."
Colorado and Arkansas each return five of their top seven
runners.
Colorado is lead by seniors Jorge Torres, runner-up at the
NCAA Championships a year ago, and Steve Slattery, the
NCAA runner-up in the steeplechase in outdoor track. The
fate of their No. 2 returning runner, 2001 NCAA Freshman
of the Year Dathan Ritzenhein, remains in question after lie
was diagnosed with a stress fracture two weeks ago that has
halted his training.
Arkansas brings the one-two punch of junior Alistair
Cragg, the indoor 5,000 meter champion, and senior Daniel
Lincoln, the outdoor steeplechase champion.
They are helped by returning top-40 finishers Silverus
Kimeli and Jason Sandfordt along with a group of young
middle distance talent.
Wisconsin and Northern Arizona also bring in a good
crop of new runners, while North Carolina State and Notre
Dame have had good early season showings.
Stanford won't be able to rely on one or two runners to
carry the team like Arkansas and Colorado can, but rather
will have to field a full set of runners that can hang near the

top in each race.
"[Our] fifth runner has to be in
the top 20 if we want a shot," said
sophomore Ryan Hall, the sole
freshman on last year's NCAA
squad.
Junior Grant Robison, a six
time All-American and defending
Pacific-10 Conference cross coun
try champion, echoed a similar
sentiment.
"Most of my individual goals re
volve around the team," be said.
"Running in NCAA and USA
Track Field Championships dur
ing track has given me the confi
dence to run with anyone in the

field."
But before the Cardinal can
make a run at its third NCAA cross
country tide in the past seven years
— the Cardinal brought home
championships in 1996 and 1997
— it must first face the strength of
the Pac-10.
"Oregon should be tough,"
Lananna said. "They have Jason
Hartmann fan Ail-American at
10,000 meters]. Arizona State is
also looking very good. Washing
ton is a team that had a great out
door track season and should be
strong."
Oregon began the season
ranked ninth while Arizona State
was ranked 13th. Washington was
at No. 27 in the preseason poll.
After the Pac-10 Champi
onships, the focus will be on the

NCAA race, which will be held in
Terre Haute, Ind., on Nov. 25.
"Crosscountry is so hard to pre
dict. Anything can happen on the
day, in the conditions," Lananna
said." lam excited every year. This
is my 28th season, and I still have
the same butterflies as (he first.
With a team like this, it's hard not
to be excited."
Returning to the team along
with Sage, Robison and Hall are
Louis Luchini, 12th place at
NCAAs last year; junior lan Dob
son, 21st at NCAAs; and senior
Seth Hejny, who finished 43rd.
The squad also adds a group of
track All-Americans, junior
Adam Teneforde, sophomore
Chris Emme and senior Jesse
Thomas.
"We've had this thing where we

call ourselves the machine," said
junior Don Sage, the top returner
from the squad last year and the
reigning NCAA 1,500 meter
champion in outdoor track.
"There are a bunch of us who can
be competitive, and so we switch
people in and out of ou. Ip,
like interchangeable parts. Duru
championships, wejust have to pu
the best group together and make
the best machine we can."
The Cardinal brings eight new
