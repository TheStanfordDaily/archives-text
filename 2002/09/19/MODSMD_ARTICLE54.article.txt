# Cardinal readies for Gauchos
## 
### ANDREA COX EDITORIAL STAFF 
On a warm October day in 2001, Oct. 21 to be
exact, the Stanford men's water polo team was
preparing fora match against No. 10 UC-Santa Bar
bara. The Gauchos entered Avery Aquatic Center
ready to challenge the undefeated, top-ranked Cardi
nal and gave the team a scare.

Men's Water Polo
vs. UC-Santa Barbara, Saturday, 12:00 p.m.

Two quick goals early in the second quarter
gave the Gauchos a 5-4 lead as they threatened to
topple Stanford from its pedestal, and an upset
looked possible.
But the Stanford men stepped up and proved to
UCSB that its place was well earned, and that it was
unwilling to surrender its undefeated record and its
top rank. In the end, the Stanford men triumphed
over the Gauchos, 9-5.
This Saturday at noon, No. 1 Stanford and UCSB
will battle once more.
The visiting Gauchos finished their 2001 season in
a disappointing seventh place in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation with a 9-13 record overall.

The Cardinal ended last year at 20-1 and did not
lose a single MPSF game, going 8-0 on its way to the
MPSF title, which was suitably followed by an
NCAA championship.
The game between Stanford and UCSB isn't quite
an epic rematch as it will be the MPSF opener for
Stanford, while UCSB already has a loss in the MPSF
against Pepperdine.
The Cardinal opened its season with a dominating
21-5 victory over No. 9 UC-Santa Cruz, followed by a
14-5 win over UC-San Diego.
The Cardinal then dominated SoCal Champi
onships last weekend, downing No. 8 UC-San
Diego, No. 3 UC-Irvine, No. 4 California and No.
10 Long Beach State, to take the tournament title.
Three-time All-American goalkeeper Nick Ellis
took home MPSF Mikasa Player of the Week honors
after Stanford's five victories during which he post
ed 32 saves.
All-American sophomore Tony Azevedo, who
spent his second straight summer with the U.S. na
tional team, will be the Cardinal's most potent offen
sive threat as Stanford looks to avoid a repeat from
last season.
So while t he safe money is on Stanford, the Gau
chos proved that they are prepared to challenge
the champions.

team. The sophomore standout spent his second summer with the U.S. National team.
