### ANNE BENJAMINSON GEORGE CHIKOVANI THE DAILY CALIFORNIAN 
(U-WIRE) BERKELEY, Calif.â€”Former Califor
nia women's basketball coach Marianne Stanley
told a newly hired assistant to either have an abor
tion or quit, causing a pregnane)' discrimination
lawsuit, the Washington Post reported Monday.
The incident occurred in 1998, midway
through Stanley's four-year tenure at Cal.
ShaiTona Alexander, the plaintiff in the lawsuit,
testified in court that Stanley pressured her to have
an abortion, and demanded her resignation when
she refused.
Alexander, then an assistant at Troy State, was
hired in June 1998, and informed Stanley of her
pregnancy after arriving in Berkeley, but before
signing her contract, the Post reported.
Alexander testified that Stanley was initially
supportive of her situation and even offered to
babysit the child. During dinner at Stanley's house,
she testified she was "trying not to throw up all over
the table," when she heard of Alexander's preg
nane). Alexander signed her contract June 25.

Stanley and Alexander both testified that in a
meeting later that week, Stanley told Alexander
she could not perform the job if she continued her
pregnancy.
Alexander testified that Stanley offered to pay
for an abortion. She testified that she informed
Stanley of the decision to keep the child July 7,
when the coaching staff was on a recruiting trip in
Chicago.
That evening, Stanley had a meeting with
Alexander in the restaurant of the hotel they were
staying in and demanded Alexander return all
items issued to her by the university, along with a
letter of resignation.
Without receiving the letter, Stanley continued
on the recruiting trip, leaving Alexander at the
hotel.
After coming under pressure from university
administrators, Stanley drove to Michigan City,
Intl., July 10 to meet with Alexander and offered
her the job back. The two, however, did not come
to an agreement and Alexander did not come back
to Berkeley with the staff.
Alexander filed her lawsuit at the Alameda
County Superior Court January 25,1999.

State and federal laws prohibit the firing of em
ployees due to pregnancy.
Stanley told the Post she was concerned for
Alexander's health, given the travelling demands
of her job. She also denied offering to pay for and
scheduling her abortion, contradicting Alexan
der's testimony.
In her deposition, Stanley testified that Alexan
der's condition would prevent her from fulfilling
the travel requirements of recruiting and the phys
ical strain of conducting practice.
"That's a personal decision ... and I respected
that whatever she decided," Stanley testified. "But
... if she was going to continue with the pregnan
cy, [then] I was going to have to find someone else
who was going to be able to do the job."
According to the Post, the university paid
Alexander $115,000 to settle the suit out of court
in October 2000.
Stanley's contract was bought out by the uni
versity at the end of the 1999-2000 season. She
owned a 35-75 record at Cal.
Stanley is now the head coach of the WNBA's
Washington Mystics and was named the league's
Coach of the Year this summer.
