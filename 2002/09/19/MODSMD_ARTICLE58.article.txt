# Freshman Sports Orientation
## A 						new student's guide for sports to see, play and follow at Stanford Trees, Trumpeters and Dollies: Stanford's Crowd Pleasers 
### 
The Band
Its reputation precedes it wherever it goes. Stories
of what it has done live on for generations. And leg
ends of where it is no longer welcome flourish
around the world.
It is, of course, The One, The Only, The Truly In
comparable Leland Stanford Junior (pause) Univer
sity Marching Band. And it is, quite possibly, the best

thing Stanford has ever produced.
The Band is often the center
piece of student unity on the Farm,
and it plays a key role in just about
every Stanford tradition — at least
all of the good ones.
It's been a rough go for the
Band lately, with a spat of proba
tions and suspensions last year and
the loss of the Band Shak this year
due to the apparently high risk of it
collapsing in the near future.
Still, the homeless scatter band is
ready to put every other college's
over-glorified high school march
ing band to shame, and you too can
join the fun.
The Band has the unique dis
tinction of being the only musical
outlet on campus that is open to
students with no musical talent. So
don't let your inability to play any
instrument keep you from fulfilling

your dream of running around a football field dur
ing halftime in front of 50,000-plus people.
Many are hoping to see the Band make the trip to
South Bend, Ind. for Stanford's Oct. 5 football game
against Notre Dame. LSJUMB's tribute to the Irish
Potato Famine a few years ago didn't go over so well
— nor did the Band leader's pregnant nun outfit —
and the Band hasn't been welcome there since.
On the flip side, the Band made its triumphant re
turn to Oregon last year after an almost-decade long
ban from Eugene, Ore. following its halftme show
there about the logger-conservationist conflict in
Oregon.
No word on whether Delta Airlines, the People's
Republic of China or any one of several Los Ange

les area hotels plan to have the Band back in the
near future.
The Tree
First things first: The Tree is the Band's mascot,
not Stanford's. Stanford's mascot is the Cardinal, as
in the color (no, it doesn't make any sense).
The Band picks the Tree at the end of Tree Week,

a competition each March during which Free-hope
fuls try to outdo each other with crazy stunts around
campus. Several of the stunts performed during
Tree Weeks in years past have become the stuff of
legends on campus, though the now-annual story of
the Tree being shot with a low caliber pistol to win the
competition always draws a few skeptical eyes.
The Tree's basic duties are to run around while
the Band plays during games, to avoid passing out
from three drunken hours in its heavy costume and
to get into the occasional fight with Oski, Cal's nerd
ly bear mascot.
Since each year's Tree makes his or her own cos
tume, Frees from the past can reappear at any time.
It's not uncommon to sometimes see three or four

trees running amok at bigger sporting events.
Sophomore Andrew Parker will be the one run
ning around the football field in his new Tree cos
tume this fall.
"All Right Now"

Stanford is proud to be the only school in the

country to use a classic rock song as its

school fight song. "All Right Now," re-

leased by the British band
Free in 1970, topped the
charts in England and

made it to No. 4 in the
United States. With
in two years the

song was on the
Band's regular

playlist.
Free, whose
frontmen went on
to form Bad Com-

pany, didn't pro
duce any other hits
after "All Right

Now," but their one
big song — about a
guy unsuccessfully try-

ing to hit on a skittish 1
woman — lives on as an in
delible part of Stanford cul
ture.

The jump that Stanford students do on the
first beat of each verse originated early in the song's
history on the Farm. Members of the Band began the
tradition somewhat accidentally when they started im
itating a move in the Dollies' (see below) routine to the
song. Monkey see, monkey do, so pretty soon the
whole student body was doing hopping along, and by
the 1980s the Jump was entrenched in Stanford tradi
tion forever.
Oddly enough, the tradition of wobbly, unsturdy
benches in the student section at Stanford Stadium
started at about the same time.
The Dollies
Most schools have cheerleaders. We have Dollies.

No, they don't cheer. Yes, they're supposed to
look prostitute-ish.
The Dollies, who are also chosen by the Band each
year, have a large repertoire of dances, some of which
are passed down each year and some that are chore-

ographed by the current members.

They also make their own uni-

forms each year, though
the same, basic red-

dress, white-glove,
excessive-makeup

get-up is the tra
ditional tem
plate.

The Yell
Leaders

Since the
Dollies
don't lead

cheers,
someone has
to. That re-

sponsibility
falls upon the
Yell Leaders,

the group you see
running around

sporting events in

white hats, khaki shorts
and Stanford Hawaiian

shuts.
The Yell Leaders get mixed reviews

each year, with people generally giving them more
praise for their work during basketball games and at
smaller sports than for their showings during the foot
ball season.
The Yell Leaders are hardly cheerleaders in the tra
ditional sense, diough they occasionally do physical
stunts often associated with the profession — except
that when they throw someone in the air, diey usually
aren't too concerned about the catching part.
Stanford did have regular cheerleaders briefly be
fore the Yell Leaders' inception in 1997, but appar
endy a complete lack of support from die Band, stu
dents and just about everyone else led to their demise.

there about the logger-conservationist conflict in
Oregon.
No word on whether Delta Airlines, the People's
Republic of China or any one of several Los Ange

les area hotels plan to have the Band back in the
near future.
The Tree
First things first: The Tree is the Band's mascot,
not Stanford's. Stanford's mascot is the Cardinal, as
in the color (no, it doesn't make any sense).
The Band picks the Tree at the end of Tree Week,

a competition each March during which Free-hope
fuls try to outdo each other with crazy stunts around
campus. Several of the stunts performed during
Tree Weeks in years past have become the stuff of
legends on campus, though the now-annual story of
the Tree being shot with a low caliber pistol to win the
competition always draws a few skeptical eyes.
The Tree's basic duties are to run around while
the Band plays during games, to avoid passing out
from three drunken hours in its heavy costume and
to get into the occasional fight with Oski, Cal's nerd
ly bear mascot.
Since each year's Tree makes his or her own cos
tume, Frees from the past can reappear at any time.
It's not uncommon to sometimes see three or four

trees running amok at bigger sporting events.
Sophomore Andrew Parker will be the one run
ning around the football field in his new Tree cos
tume this fall.
"All Right Now"

Stanford is proud to be the only school in the

country to use a classic rock song as its

school fight song. "All Right Now," re-

leased by the British band
Free in 1970, topped the
charts in England and

made it to No. 4 in the
United States. With
in two years the

song was on the
Band's regular

playlist.
Free, whose
frontmen went on
to form Bad Com-

pany, didn't pro
duce any other hits
after "All Right

Now," but their one
big song — about a
guy unsuccessfully try-

ing to hit on a skittish 1
woman — lives on as an in
delible part of Stanford cul
ture.

The jump that Stanford students do on the
first beat of each verse originated early in the song's
history on the Farm. Members of the Band began the
tradition somewhat accidentally when they started im
itating a move in the Dollies' (see below) routine to the
song. Monkey see, monkey do, so pretty soon the
whole student body was doing hopping along, and by
the 1980s the Jump was entrenched in Stanford tradi
tion forever.
Oddly enough, the tradition of wobbly, unsturdy
benches in the student section at Stanford Stadium
started at about the same time.
The Dollies
Most schools have cheerleaders. We have Dollies.

No, they don't cheer. Yes, they're supposed to
look prostitute-ish.
The Dollies, who are also chosen by the Band each
year, have a large repertoire of dances, some of which
are passed down each year and some that are chore-

ographed by the current members.

They also make their own uni-

forms each year, though
the same, basic red-

dress, white-glove,
excessive-makeup

get-up is the tra
ditional tem
plate.

The Yell
Leaders

Since the
Dollies
don't lead

cheers,
someone has
to. That re-

sponsibility
falls upon the
Yell Leaders,

the group you see
running around

sporting events in

white hats, khaki shorts
and Stanford Hawaiian

shuts.
The Yell Leaders get mixed reviews

each year, with people generally giving them more
praise for their work during basketball games and at
smaller sports than for their showings during the foot
ball season.
The Yell Leaders are hardly cheerleaders in the tra
ditional sense, diough they occasionally do physical
stunts often associated with the profession — except
that when they throw someone in the air, diey usually
aren't too concerned about the catching part.
Stanford did have regular cheerleaders briefly be
fore the Yell Leaders' inception in 1997, but appar
endy a complete lack of support from die Band, stu
dents and just about everyone else led to their demise.
