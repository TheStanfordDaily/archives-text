# Get Your 6th Man On: Stanford Basketball Awaits
## 
### 
Men's Basketball
The bad news is that you're about two
or three years too late to be jumping on
the Stanford men's basketball bandwag
on. The good news is ... well, we'll have
to get back to you on that.
With center Curtis Borchardt and
guard Casey Jacobsen jetting early for the
NBA after last season, diis will be the first
year in quite some time that the Cardinal
isn't going to be on anyone's radar screens
from day one.
Last year, Stanford went 20-10, includ
ing 12-6 in the Pacific-10 Conference.
They made the NCAA tournament, as a
No. 8 seed, knocking off Western Ken
tucky before falling hard in the second
round to Kansas, which went all the way to
the Final Four.
The 2001-2002 Cardinal counted on
Jacobsen and Borchardt heavily for just
about everything from scoring points,
picking up rebounds and blocking shots.

A consistent third scoring option never re
ally emerged as the team dropped its first

game to California in nearly five years

and got swept by the Los Angeles

schools at home.
Guard Julius Barnes, the
team's only senior, will have
to shoulder a lot of offensive
— and leadership — re-

sponsibilities, especially if two-sport
star Teyo Johnson decides not to
play basketball this year. The 6-7 for
ward Johnson, the leading receiver

on the Cardinal football team, and
Barnes are Stanford's only returning

starters this year.
The Cardinal will have plenty of size
this year, with five players topping out at
or above 6-8. The tallest of those, 6-10
sophomore center Rob Little, will have

the unenviable task of replacing Bor
chardt in the middle. Junior forwards
Justin Davis and Joe Kirchofer will i

also be looked upon to step
into the spotlight, as will
sophomore guard Josh Chil-

dress, who looked impres
sive in his first year on
l the Farm.

Stanford isn't
likely to drop 105
points on an oppo
nent like it did

last year
against
I Washing
ton, but by

playing
smart and

" being tough, die Cardinal
should be able to make tilings
interesting in all of its big
games. You won't hear much
championship talk on campus
this year as the Cardinal plays an
unfamiliar underdog role, but

Stanford could make some noise on its
way to what would be a ninth straight i

NCAA appearance.

Women's Basketball
The Stanford women

had a spectacular regular
season last year, going 32-

3 and a perfect 18-0 in

conference play to repeat
as Pac-10 champions.
The team peaked at No. 2
in the national rankings
and rolled through the

first two rounds of the

NCAA tournament, knocking off i
both Weber State and Tulane by over

20 points. The ride ended premature
ly, though, as the team suffered an
upset loss to a determined Colorado
team in the regional semifinals.

All-American junior Nicole Powell led
the way last year, but she had considerable

support from current WNBA players
Lindsay Yamasaki and Cori En
ghusen.

The Cardinal has lost some of the
size that it used to dominate
many of its opponents last year,
and this year's squad will be a

much younger
k team. But in

Powell, the Pac
-10 Player of the

Year, Stanford

still boasts one of the best scor
ers, rebounders and passers in
the country. Sophomores Kelly
Suminski, F'Nae Thiel and

Sebnem Kimyacioglu, who
were the Cardinal's fourth,
fifth and sixth leading scorers
last year, will be expected to

contribute in larger roles this
season.
