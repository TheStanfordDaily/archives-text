# Students abroad find fewer outlets for grief
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
While students on campus this
Sept. 11 were offered a wide vari
ety of opportunities to commem
orate last year's tragedy, Stanford
students abroad found them
selves without clear outlets to ob
serve the anniversary.
In lieu of a formal way of rec
ognizing Sept. 11, many partic
ipants in the five new Overseas
Seminars found personal ways
to remember the attacks — ei
ther alone or with their classes
— despite being far from the
United States.
Students in Leuven, Belgium,
participating in the "Political
Economy of the European

Union" seminar, spent the day at
the I lenri-Chapelle Cemetery,
where 7,989 American soldiers
who died at the Battle of the
Bulge in World War II are
buried.
"There was definitely a
somber mood among the
group," said junior Elizabeth
Madjlessi, adding that the class's
visit to the cemetery was
planned to coincide with Sept.
11.
Junior David Guo, who was
also in Leuven, saw the visit as a
chance to put last year's events in
historical context.
"Before endless rows of im
maculate white crosses on the
green lawns, the participants of the
seminar remembered not only the
victims of 9/11, but those patriots
who gave their lives in the war for
democracy," he reflected.
At 2:46 p.m. in Belgium (8:46
a.m. ES T), the class held a mo
ment of silence at the same time as
New York's.
Many students used interna
tional cable channels to see to the
commemorative events going on
at home.
For students in Belgium, Uni
versity of Leuven Visiting Profes

sor of Economics Christophe
Crombez invited the class to his
apartment to watch a French CNN
documentary about Sept. 11.
For students in one of the two
Beijing programs, however, find
ing media coverage of American
ceremonies took active effort.
"I went with a small group of
students from our class to the
most 'Western' hotel near Beijing
University," said senior Steph
Cheung. "We couldn't get access
to CNN at Beijing University, and
there was no way to access any
channels in English.
"We went to the Shangri-La
Hotel in Beijing and sat in the
smoky bar, watching the commem
oration on CNN. At 8:45 p.m. Bei

jing time, which was 8:45 a.m. New'
York time, we held a moment of si
lence to remember 9/11."
Other students overseas found
subtle and personal ways to ob
serve Sept. 11.
" There were no formal discus
sions, and most people internally
reflected more than anything,"
Madjlessi said. "Some students
chose to wear black, others red,
white and blue."
Many students found that con
necting with the United States be
came especially important on Sept.
11, as their foreign communities
did little to observe the day.
"On Sept. I 1, 2002, in Beijing, 1
decided that it was the one day on
my three-week trip to study in

China that I truly needed to feel
like an American," Cheung said.
"It was a strange feeling to be cry
ing, holding hands, watching im
ages of America on TV, with a
swarming gibberish of Mandarin
swirling around us in the hotel bar.
"At one point, there was a band
that wanted to begin playing back
ground music. We politely asked il
(hey would refrain until after our
moment of silence."
Madjlessi described the Bel
gium she encountered on Sept. 11
as similarly unaffected.
"We visited Maastricht that day
and there really seemed to be no
reaction to anniversary ;it all," she
s;iid. "It basically seemed like any
other day in Belgium."
