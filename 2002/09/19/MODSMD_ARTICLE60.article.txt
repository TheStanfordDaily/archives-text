# The 						Card's World Series Wishes
## 
### 
Baseball
Stanford has become a fixture at the College
World Series, having made it to Omaha, Neb.

each of the last four years. But all four times,
the Cardinal has come up short of ana-

tional title. year it lost to eventual

champion Texas in the bracket
final after falling in the champi
onship game the two previous
years.

The Cardinal's return to the CWS last
year was made possible by a strong core
of players that had remained almost en
tirely intact from the previous year. But
the Major League Baseball Draft this

spring took seven players from the Car
dinal's ranks — including five under
classmen — so Stanford will have a

much different look next spring.
Senior catcher Ryan Garko will
lead the team's retooling eflort,

which will also get a lot of help
from junior outfielders Carlos
Quentin and Sam Fuld. 4

Stanford's top two starting
pitchers, Tim Cunningham and

Jeremy Guthrie, were among those leaving the Farm a year
early. That leaves junior John Hudgins, who went 10-1 last
season, as the only returning starter from hust season's 47-
18 squad. Senior Ryan McCally, who was Stanford's leading
reliever last year, will be back to help fill in the pitching

ranks for coach Mark Marquess's 27th season at the helm.

Softball
Last year's softball season was one ofdisappoint-

ments for the Cardinal, which opened the sea
son with its highest ranking ever at No. 2 in

the polls.
An early season-ending injury to two-time
All-American pitcher Dana Sorensen hit die
team hard, and the Stanford bats hit some
nasty cold streaks during the season. The
same Stanford squad that opened the year
with 11 straight wins ended up losing nine
consecutive conference games en route to a 7-
14 Pac-10 record and a sixth-place conference
finish. Stanford's season came to an early end

at the NCAA regionals, where the Cardinal
was knocked out with its second loss in

just its third game of the tournament.
Sorensen will be back this year

along with the Cardinal's two
other starters from last

year, seniors Maureen
LeCocq and Tori Ny-

berg. But the team
has some big holer

in its offense left by

four-time All-American Jessica Mendoza and Sarah Bee
son, who finished one-two, respectively, in batting last sea
son for Stanford. Senior Kira Chiang and junior Jessica Al
listcr are the Cardinal's leading offensive threats in its
group of five returning field players.
