# Relive the Glory Days of High School: Play Sports on the Farm
## 
### 
The only diing better than watching sports at Stan
ford is playing sports. Even if you're athletic abilities
aren't going to be scoring you a scholarship any time
soon, there are still tons of sports opportunities out there
at all levels of skill, competition and commitment.
The Varsity Route
Unless you're really, really good at some sport, to be
a varsity athlete here you're going to have to look at the
handful of varsity sports that are wide open to just
about every Stanford student.
The crew and sailing teams regularly recruit around
campus to fill their squads each year. Previous experience
is not a prerequisite — you don't even need to have seen
a boat before in your life. Both sports take up a fair

amount of
time. But the
bounty of free
Nike gear
awaiting those
who go the dis
tance is almost
incentive
enough to take
the plunge.
The Club
Route
If spend
ing all day on
a boat isn't
your thing,
check out
Stanford's
long list of
club sports.
Most teams
are open to

everyone, regardless of skill or experience — but don't
think fora second that that means they can't be fierce
ly competitive.
Most club sports are organized on the national level,
and many club teams take part in conferences and na
tional tournaments like their varsity counterparts. The
men's Ultimate, men's rugby and coed badminton club
teams all won national championships last year. The
women's Ultimate, men's lacrosse, women's rugby,

triathlon and squash clubs also had strong showings in
their respective national competitions.
Most club sports can be pretty chill, if that's more
what you're looking for. The occasional keg may find
its way to a rugby or Ultimate field, and most teams
breed tight friendships among their players that last
long after their playing days are over, even if you suck
it up on the playing field.
The Intramural Route
Most dorms Held teams for intramural sports, but
Stanford's intramural system isn't the strongest.
There are usually two divisions for 1M sports
(though some also have a women's division). Division I
teams, usually graduate student and staff member

squads that actu
ally practice and
have set plays,
tend to be too
competitive for
dorm teams to
have a chance.
Teams in D-11,
which includes
most dorm teams,
tend not to take
competitions seri
ously enough, re
sulting in lots of
forfeits and lop
sided games.
IMsareagood
way for dorms to
build spirit and
might be good for
an hour of fun
with your friends
once a week, but

when it comes to getting your fill of competitive sports,
you're probably going to want to look elsewhere.
The IM individual tournaments are the one excep
tion to this. If your goal is to prove you are the best, non
varsity tennis player at Stanford, IMs will give you your
shot at glory. Much anticipated is this year's addition of
a foosbol tournament in early October, which will —
much to the dismay of that person's friends—prove that
the winner is, in fact, the best foosbol player on campus.
