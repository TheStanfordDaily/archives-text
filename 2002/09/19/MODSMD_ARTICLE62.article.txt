# Will Stanford host the 2012 Summer Olympic Games?
## 
### 
Flie 2012 Summer Olympics may seem quite a ways
off, but an important decision about those Games is
coming up in November, one that could have a huge im
pact on Stanford athletics.
On Nov. 3, the U.S. Olympic Committee will
decide whether New York or San Francisco will be
the United States's bid city for the 2012 Games.
The Stanford campus serves as the centerpiece of
the San Francisco bid being pushed by the Bay
Area Sports Organizing Committee, whose plan
calls fora number of changes to the Farm's athlet
ic facilities.
BASOC would oversee a $300 million renovation to
Stanford Stadium, $150 million of which would re
portedly come out of Stanford's pocket. The renovat
ed stadium would accommodate 100,000 people —
though its capacity would be reduced to around
60,000 after the Games —and it would host the open
ing and closing ceremonies as well as the track and field
competition.
Stanford would also host the swimming compeu
tion, although the Avery Aquatic Center would only
be used for warm-up pools. A new, removable aquat
ic complex would be built on Stanford's practice foot

ball fields to host the Games swimming and diving
events.
Maples Pavilion would play host to the badminton
competition, while the Olympic softball tournament
would take place in a modified Sunken Diamond.
Stanford would also be the site for the modern pen
tathlon and the archery competition.
While the athlete's village would be located ten min
utes south of Stanford at what is currently Moffett
Field, all of the apartment-style residences on Stan
ford's campus would serve as both the media village
and the judges and referees village.
Because the United States hosted Olympics
in 1984,1996 and 2002, any U.S. city is currently consid
ered a long shot to be picked by the International
Olympic Committee in 2005 as the 2012 host. The U.S.
city's chances could be further reduced if Vancouver, a
frontrunner for the 2010 Winter Olympics, is picked to
host by the lOC next year.
Still, with current and former Stanford athletes
having tallied 47 medals over the last three Summer
Games (including 30 gold medals), you can bet that a
lot of folks at Stanford will be eagerly watching the
USOC's decision.
