Swimming and Diving
For the men's and women's swimming and
diving teams, the 2002-2003 season is going
to be about winning the national titles that
slipped through their fingers last year. Both

teams entered the NCAA Championships
as favorites, but both fell just short of
bringing home national titles.

After winning its 22nd straight Pac-10
title, the men narrowly lost the NCAA Champi
onship to Texas despite picking three individual
and three relay titles.
Junior Markus Rogan, the defending NCAA
champion in the 200 backstroke and the 200 indi
vidual medley, leads the group of returning swim
mers set on clinching that title. Junior Peter Mar
shall, the defending NCAA 100 backstroke cham
pion, and senior Randall Bal, last year's world
champion in the 50 back, will also return for the
Cardinal.
The women finished third at the NCAAs, mark
ing the 21st straight year that they had finished
among the nation's top three teams. Junior Tara
Kirk, who set a new American record in the 200
breaststroke in winning the event at the NCAAs,
leads the group of returning women.

Gill landed Stanford's first indi
vidual NCAA titles since 1996
with wins in the rings and the
vault, respectively.

at the helm of the young Cardinal
squad that graduated six seniors

last year.
The women also had a surprising end to

the season, reaching the NCAA Super Six for the
first time ever. Though the squad finished sixth at
that competition, it returns much of its core from
last year, making a return trip to the Super Six an
attainable goal for the coming season. Juniors lise

returning group.

strong team: junior Nathan Peterson (1213
