# Sample the Spring Swing of the Warm-Weather Sports Teams
## 
### 
Tennis
For the last two decades, Stanford has been the
most dominating force in the nation in men's and
women's tennis, with a total of 27 NCAA champi
onships between the two teams.
The women kept the program's winning tradi
tion going strong last year, picking up their second
straight NCAA championship.
But the men fell on tough times, as the squad,
beset by injuries, fell in the second round of the
NCAA tournament for its earliest NCAA exit in 15
years.
The women have lost Lauren Kalvaria and
Gabriela Lastra, winners of the NCAA doubles
championship last year, to graduation. But six play
ers return to the squad, led by sophomore Erin
Burdette, who reached the semifinals in last year's
NCAA singles tournament and is No. 7 in the pre
season rankings.
Junior Lauren Barnikow, ranked No. 15, will
probably play second-flight singles and forms the
nation's No. 5 doubles tandem with Burdette.
The men return without four-time All-American
K.J. Hippensteel, but all of the team's other key
players will be back. Stanford will be led by three se-

niors: No. 11 David Martin, No. 22 Ryan Hav
ilancl and No. 32 Scott Lipsky.
Lipsky and Martin were the NCAA dou
bles runners-up last year, while Haviland
and Martin both reached the semifinals of

the NCAA singles tournament.
Women's Water Polo
The Stanford women's water polo

team won its first NCAA champi
onship last year, avenging its

losses to UCLA in the previous
year's NCAA final and last '
year's Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation championship game.

All-American junior driver Brenda
Villa, who led Stanford with 60 goals
last season, is back along with senior
goalkeeper Jackie Frank, last year's
National Player of (lie Year.

The Cardinal will need to replace
two-meter Ellen Estes and driver
Margie Dingeldein, who combined
for 70 goals last season. But with 12
letterwinners returning, the Cardi- }
rial has a solid reserve of talent to j
draw from.

Men's Volleyball
Don Shaw, who won four na
tional championships during 16

years as head coach of the women's
team, heads into his second year as coach of the
men's squad.
The Cardinal showed flashes of brilliance during
last year's 17-9 campaign, but to turn in a better re
sult in 2003, the team will have to find replacements
for its two leading diggers, recent graduates Seth
Ring and Marcus Skacel.
ITie offense is in good hands, as Ail-American se
nior outside hitter Curl Toppel returns for his final

year on the farm. He'll be receiving his sets from ju
nior Kevin Hansen, who lead die team in aces and
came in third in digs during his first season as a
starter last year.
Track and Field
With the strength of Stanford's cross country
teams, it isn't surprising that Stanford's track teams
have relied on their middle distance runners the
last few years to generate points at national meets.
The recent nomination of Vin Lananna, the direc
tor of track and field and cross country at Stanford,
to coach the U.S. middle distance runners for the
2004 Olympics is a good sign that the system is
working quite well.
Coming off an eighth-place finish at last year's
NCAA Championships, the men's team returns
four All-American middle distance runners, led by
junior Donald Sage, the defending NCAA 1,500-
meter champion.
Senior Lauren Fleshman, the two-time defend
ing NCAA champion in the 5,000, leads the return
ing group of athletes on the women's team, Which
finished seventh at last spring's NCAA Champi
onships.
All-American junior shot putter Jillian Camare-

na will lead the women in the field events along
with All-American senior pole vaulter Kathleen
Donoghue.

Women's Lacrosse
The Stanford women's lacrosse team con
tinued its steady rise on the national stage

by taking the inaugural Mountain Pacific
Lacrosse League title last. The team ended

the season with an 11-7 record, including
a perfect 10-0 mark in the MPLL.

The Cardinal returns its top four
scorers from last season, sophomores Kelsey
Twist, Nina Pantano and twin sisters Julia and
Claire Calzonetti.

Seniors Rachael Neumann and Virginia
Solomon, who split time in goal last season,
will both be back in 2003 as the team looks for
its first ever NCAA tournament bid.

Golf
The days of Tiger Woods are long

passed for the men's golf team, which fell
short of the NCAA Championships last

year, finishing 17th at the West Regional (the top 10
advance). The men lost honorable mention All
American Philip Rowe to graduation, but senior
Jim Seki, a first-team All-Pac-10 selection, will re
turn. Standout junior Blake Mastilir and solid se
nior Ron Won will also pace the Cardinal this
spring.
The women placed fifth at the West Regional to
make it to the NCAA Championships for the 14th
consecutive season. Two-sport phenom Marcia
Wallis, also a leading scorer on the women's soccer
team, returns following an honorable mention All-
American season last year. Senior Kim Rowton, a
second team all-Pac-10 choice, is also back to help
the Cardinal improve on its 1 It It-place finish last
year.

The Cardinal returns its top four
scorers from last season, sophomores Kelsey
Twist, Nina Pantano and twin sisters Julia and
Claire Calzonetti.

Seniors Rachael Neumann and Virginia
Solomon, who split time in goal last season,
will both be back in 2003 as the team looks for
its first ever NCAA tournament bid.

Golf
The days of Tiger Woods are long

passed for the men's golf team, which fell
short of the NCAA Championships last

year, finishing 17th at the West Regional (the top 10
advance). The men lost honorable mention All
American Philip Rowe to graduation, but senior
Jim Seki, a first-team All-Pac-10 selection, will re
turn. Standout junior Blake Mastilir and solid se
nior Ron Won will also pace the Cardinal this
spring.
The women placed fifth at the West Regional to
make it to the NCAA Championships for the 14th
consecutive season. Two-sport phenom Marcia
Wallis, also a leading scorer on the women's soccer
team, returns following an honorable mention All-
American season last year. Senior Kim Rowton, a
second team all-Pac-10 choice, is also back to help
the Cardinal improve on its 1 It It-place finish last
year.
