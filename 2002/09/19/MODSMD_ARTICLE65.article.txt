## 
### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Monday, while most mem
bers of the Stanford student body
will still be mourning the end of
summer vacation, the Stanford
women's golf team will be focused
on the links, as it begins its 2002-
2003 campaign by participating
for the first time in the Mason
Rudolph Women's Champi
onship.

at the Mason Rudolph Colegiate Golf
Championship, Nashville,
Tenn., Monday and Tuesday, all day

The two-day, 54-hole event is
set at the 6,276-yard, par-72 Iron
Horse Course of the Legends
Club, in Franklin, Tenn., a track
which about half ihe team saw at
an NCAA event held there a cou
ples year ago.
The Cardinal, ranked No. 15
nationally in Golfworld magazine's
preseason coaches' poll, will be
tested immediately on Monday by
a very strong field. Against this stiff
competition, Stanford coach (Caro
line O'Connor says the team is

"just looking to see where we stand
for the year."
Among the stronger entries in
the tournament is host Vanderbilt,
which is ranked ninth in the nation
and returns four starters from last
year's squad.
No. 12 Ohio State will look to
defend its team title at the event,
after firing a 3-under-par 801 to
claim top honors last season.
Oregon State and No. 3 Arizona
will give the Cardinal its first taste
of Pacific-10 Conference competi
tion. The Wildcats are led by se
nior Laura Myerscough, who went
undefeated playing for the United
States in three Curtis Cup matches
during the summer and proved
herself against a strong European
team.
The Cardinal looks to build on
its momentum from last spring,
when the squad concluded the
year with a flurry of top-10 finish
es, highlighted by a fourth-place
showing at the Peg Barnard Colle
giate and fifth-place honors at the
NCAA West Regional.
At the NCAA Championships,
redshirt sophomore Marcia Wallis
paced the squad with a 1-under
par 287, good for eighth place in
the individual competition. It was

Wallis's best career finish and pro
pelled her to an honorable men
tion Ail-American selection.
But the two-sport athlete Wal
lis, who is currently the third-lead
ing scorer on the No. 2 women's
soccer team, won't be making the
trip to Tennessee because of her
obligations on the soccer field.
In her absence, O'Conner also
sees senior Kim Rowton as a key
performer for the Cardinal in the
upcoming event.
"I think you're going to see Kim
Rowton come out and have a great
spring," O'Connor said. "She's re
ally rededicated herself to playing
golf."
The Cardinal will try to im
prove upon its sluggish start last
season, which began with a 37-
over-par 613 at the Fall Preview in
Auburn, Wash., which landed the
squad in 16th place overall.
Once Stanford wraps up play
at the Mason Rudolph, the team
will get a week off before traveling
to the Edean Ihlanfeldt Invita
tional in Tacoma, Washington on
Oct. 7. The Cardinal then hosts it
first tournament of the year with
the Stanford / Pepsi Intercolle
giate at the Stanford Golf Course
on Oct. 19.
