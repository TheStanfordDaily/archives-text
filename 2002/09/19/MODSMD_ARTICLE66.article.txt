### JUDSON BOOMHOWER GUEST COLUMNIST 
Seeing as this is the Orienta
tion Issue of The Daily, I think I
am required to pass on some kind
of nugget or kernel or pearl (take
your pick, but the nuggets go best
with the barbeque sauce) of wis
dom relating to the Stanford ex
perience.
I want to just jump out and say,
"I'lay Ultimate at Stanford," but I
guess I should start oft with a more
general observation. So here's one
you've probably heard before:
College is about self-discovery.
The idea that you begin to un
derstand yourself and who you
are during your university years
has certainly proved true in my
life. I have spent the last three
years at Stanford exploring my
self. Of course, self-exploration
can take many forms. Some of
these are conducive to enlighten
ment, while at least one of the
others is a good way to make
things really awkward between
you and your roommate.
I think it's best to steer this col
umn away from how frequent
self-discovery has affected my
roommate relationships at Stan
ford and towards what I've

learned about myself from more
constructive types of reflection.
What I've come up with is a
few core truths about myself. One
of the most clarion of these real
izations has been that I am an ath
lete. I've always known that
sports were important to me, but
1 never understood how central
training and competition were to
my personality until recently.
I played a sport every season
in high school and ended up with
nine varsity letters by the time it
was all over. 1 had offers to run
cross country and track at smaller
schools, but 1 didn't have the tal
ent to join Stanford's power
house, Olympian-producing dis
tance program.
In one of the most fortuitous
events of my college career, I
heard about the Stanford Men's
Ultimate Team (SMUT) from
somebody in my freshman dorm
and went out to the first practice.
I loved it, and Ultimate has been
a central part of my life ever since.
Through the SMUT program,
I have experienced the satisfac
tion of training hard fora sport
that I love, the feeling of brother
hood that grows between team
mates, the rush of competition
and the sweet sweet satisfaction of

winning a national c hampionship
last season. I've learned that
being an athlete is not something
you do — it's something you are,
and it doesn't have to stop after
high school.
I'm not unique. A lot of athletes
come to Stanford and don't find a
home on one of our varsity teams.
It's to be expected at a school that
has won eight consecutive Sears
Cups. The club sports program is
ideal for these athletes.
At Stanford, club sports like
Ultimate traditionally practice a
few times a week (fall men's Fris
bee practices are Mondays and
Thursdays from 3:10 p.m. to 6:00
p.m. on Roble Field) and often
have a history of success, if not
domination, that rivals the Cardi
nal varsity programs.
The men's badminton club took
the national championship last
year, and the women's rugby team
has made a tradition of running
over other schools, bringing home
their most recent national title in
1999. The women's Ultimate team
has placed second at nationals the
last two years and, as mentioned,
the men won it all last year.
So as a new class of Stanford
students begins to learn about
themselves, I encourage anyone

who loves sports to check out club
athletics at Stanford. The club
sports program website
(http://www.Stanford.edu/dept/p
e/clubsports.html) has a full list ot
teams, and the new men's Ulti
mate site (smut.stanford.edu) has

all kinds of information about
playing Frisbee at Stanford.
1 hope to see lots of new faces on
Roble field this fall exploring the
joys of club sports. I also hope that
freshmen remember to lock their
doors as they explore the other

joys of self-discovery.

major in his fourth year playing Ulti
