# Stanford's rich traditions exposed and explained
## 
### EDITORIAL STAFF 
You got in, you made it to campus, you
picked out some semi-attractive yet reason
ably priced bedding and you're getting the
hang of Stanford. Congratulations. You
made it. But now is not the time to rest on
your laurels.
As you learn the ropes here, it is impera
tive that you learn a few fundamental tradi
tions. These will soon become second nature,
like clapping too fast and jumping at just the
right time when The One, The Only, The
Truly Incomparable, Leland Stanford Ju
nior (pause) University Marching Band
plays "All Right Now."
First things first: Enjoy your orientation
week, as it just might be the most carefree six
days you ever have at Stanford. Things to do
during the first week include a trip to the top
of the Hoover Tower, a bit of spontaneous
fountain hopping and attending at least one
frat party 011 the Row. Once you make it
through these traditions, you'll be well on
your way to becoming a knowing Stanford
Freshman.
Next comes the infamous Full Moon 011
the Quad, your one chance for guilt-free
tongue jousting with a total stranger. You
submit because you're supposed to. In order
to become a Stanford man or woman, ac
cording to legend, a freshman must kiss a se
nior in the Quad under the light of the full
moon. It is a little sleazier and not quite as po
etic as it sounds, but be a good sport. 1 lope

fully the moon will provide just enough light
for you to remain anonymous and unrecog
nizable. And hopefully your elder molesters
will be polite and not give you mono.
All the while, you'll see and be seen at
Stanford's one regular weekly social outing,
Flicks. These almost-up-to-date movie offer
ings screened in Memorial Auditorium are a
great opportunity to check out male pattern
baldness trends among those in the orchestra
seats, as well as your otie shot to nail that ob
noxious prep school kid in your 1-Hum class
during the pre-show paper fight. Go for the
front row of the balcony fora prime viewing
location.
Halloween sets the scene fora less whole
some, frenzied rite as the student body heads
on down to the resting place of our beloved
founders and dances on their graves. A little
morbid and ungrateful, perhaps, but the
Mausoleum provides a perfectly eerie back
drop for the wickedness of the holiday. After
you put in an appearance at the Mausoleum,
head over to Synergy for some real fun.
Once November rolls around, all the cos
mic energy on campus focuses on one deli
ciously malicious goal: beating Cal. Outcome
the name-calling, the Axe wielding and the
most high-schoolesque display of Stanford
spirit you will get out of a group of semi-apa
thetic smart people.

versus Cardinal battles. Big Game
Week includes many can't-miss
or-you're-kune events such as Gai
eties, a student-written comedy
revue that takes the opportunity to
playfully go for the Cal jugular.
Gaieties also sends more visible
Stanford icons up in flames in a
joking, pseudo-plot filled musical.
Keep your eyes peeled for the
ever-present male and female
streakers and an appearance by
the now non-bearded President
Hennessey.
You also learn the Axe Cheer
(highlighted by such tricky and
complex lines as "Give 'em the
Axe" and "Right in the neck"). Al
though Big Game week has never
been the same without the tower
ing Bonfire (canceled four years
ago because of the endangered
tiger salamander population in
the Lake Lagunita bed), plans are
always in the works to find a
"healthy alternative."
Big Game itself is the one time
yon can do the "We Got In" cheer
without feeling like your ego's the
size of Montana as the Axe Com
mittee prepares to take back its
baby. On that electric night, no
matter what the score, the campus
erupts in snoozing, boredom-rid
den silence as the all-day tailgates

take a toll, and campus turns lame,
lame, lame.
From there, Stanford takes a
turn for the worse as everybody
and anybody tries to reverse the
dateless trend that has crushed the
campus under its weight. As fun as
the whole blind date concept is in
theory, in reality it proves painful
as dormitories throw Screw Your
Roommate parties. Although you
may not meet your potential soul
mate, it is a good way to get back at
your roommate for sexiling yon
every Friday and Saturday night.
And when romantic frustration
doesn't outweigh academic frus
tration — usually for the two
weeks each quarter during Dead
and Finals Weeks — another tra
dition rears its ugly head. Every
night of Dead Week, students take
part in the Primal Scream, yelling
out of their windows at midnight,
thereby getting out I-Hum read
ing frustrations and writer's-block
woes. However, your chance of
running into a discreet encounter
in Green's south stacks does seem
to increase exponentially.
These are just a few of the tra
ditions which give Stanford a
kicked-back yet amusingly off
beat atmosphere. No one takes
them very seriously now, but
you'll miss them all too soon when
you undergo that last tradition —
graduation.
