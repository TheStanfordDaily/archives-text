# Stanford's rich traditions exposed and explained
## 
### EDITORIAL STAFF 
You got in, you made it to campus, you
picked out some semi-attractive yet reason
ably priced bedding and you're getting the
hang of Stanford. Congratulations. You
made it. But now is not the time to rest on
your laurels.
As you learn the ropes here, it is impera
tive that you learn a few fundamental tradi
tions. These will soon become second nature,
like clapping too fast and jumping at just the
right time when The One, The Only, The
Truly Incomparable, Leland Stanford Ju
nior (pause) University Marching Band
plays "All Right Now."
First things first: Enjoy your orientation
week, as it just might be the most carefree six
days you ever have at Stanford. Things to do
during the first week include a trip to the top
of the Hoover Tower, a bit of spontaneous
fountain hopping and attending at least one
frat party 011 the Row. Once you make it
through these traditions, you'll be well on
your way to becoming a knowing Stanford
Freshman.
Next comes the infamous Full Moon 011
the Quad, your one chance for guilt-free
tongue jousting with a total stranger. You
submit because you're supposed to. In order
to become a Stanford man or woman, ac
cording to legend, a freshman must kiss a se
nior in the Quad under the light of the full
moon. It is a little sleazier and not quite as po
etic as it sounds, but be a good sport. 1 lope

fully the moon will provide just enough light
for you to remain anonymous and unrecog
nizable. And hopefully your elder molesters
will be polite and not give you mono.
All the while, you'll see and be seen at
Stanford's one regular weekly social outing,
Flicks. These almost-up-to-date movie offer
ings screened in Memorial Auditorium are a
great opportunity to check out male pattern
baldness trends among those in the orchestra
seats, as well as your otie shot to nail that ob
noxious prep school kid in your 1-Hum class
during the pre-show paper fight. Go for the
front row of the balcony fora prime viewing
location.
Halloween sets the scene fora less whole
some, frenzied rite as the student body heads
on down to the resting place of our beloved
founders and dances on their graves. A little
morbid and ungrateful, perhaps, but the
Mausoleum provides a perfectly eerie back
drop for the wickedness of the holiday. After
you put in an appearance at the Mausoleum,
head over to Synergy for some real fun.
Once November rolls around, all the cos
mic energy on campus focuses on one deli
ciously malicious goal: beating Cal. Outcome
the name-calling, the Axe wielding and the
most high-schoolesque display of Stanford
spirit you will get out of a group of semi-apa
thetic smart people.
Seven years ago Stanford reclaimed the
Axe and has held it for the past seven Bears
