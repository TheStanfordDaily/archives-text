### ANTHONY HA EDITORIAL STAFF 
In the newest edition of U.S. News and World
Report's annual college rankings, Stanford moved
up from fifth to fourth place. The University is
now in a five-way tie with the Caltech, Duke, MIT
and Pennsylvania.
Princeton remains at the top in the National Univer
sities - Doctoral category, while Stanford rival UC-
Berkeley continues to hold its position at No. 20.
But Stanford students may want to hesitate be
fore gloating too loudly about their obvious superi
ority. As in past years, the rankings have not gone
without criticism, some of it from members of the
University's administration.
"Our perspective hasn't changed much over the
years," said Associate Director of University Communi

fers some g(xxl, solid stats, but our concern is over the
rankings. We hope that students don't use them to de
cide where to apply, and instead try to find the college
that's right for that particular student.
"Universities change very slowly, but the rankings
would have you believe that there's a substantial differ
ence from year to year," she added. "What really
changes is the way they crunch the numbers."
Richard Folkers, director of media relations at U.S.
News, argued that the rankings are useful when com
bined with other sources of information.
"It's very important to us that students read across
the line [of university statistics]," he said. "We're confi
dent that most of them use the rankings as they were
meant to be used —as a starting point for further re
search to find the schools that are best for them.
"We rank the schools because the information is al

ready there — it would be a cop-out if we didn't."
The magazine's methodology remains largely un
changed from last year. I Tie data, most of which are col
lected from the colleges themselves, include peer as
sessment, graduation and retention rates, faculty re
sources, student selectivity, financial resources, alumni
giving, and graduation-rate performance (a compari
son between predicted and actual graduation rates).
Among this year's additions to the list are rank-
