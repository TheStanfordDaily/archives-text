# U.S. News ranks Stanford fourth
## 
### ANTHONY HA EDITORIAL STAFF 
In the newest edition of U.S. News and World
Report's annual college rankings, Stanford moved
up from fifth to fourth place. The University is
now in a five-way tie with the Caltech, Duke, MIT
and Pennsylvania.
Princeton remains at the top in the National Univer
sities - Doctoral category, while Stanford rival UC-
Berkeley continues to hold its position at No. 20.
But Stanford students may want to hesitate be
fore gloating too loudly about their obvious superi
ority. As in past years, the rankings have not gone
without criticism, some of it from members of the
University's administration.
"Our perspective hasn't changed much over the
years," said Associate Director of University Communi
cations Kate Chesley. "We think that the magazine of
fers some g(xxl, solid stats, but our concern is over the
rankings. We hope that students don't use them to de
cide where to apply, and instead try to find the college
that's right for that particular student.
"Universities change very slowly, but the rankings
would have you believe that there's a substantial differ
ence from year to year," she added. "What really
changes is the way they crunch the numbers."
Richard Folkers, director of media relations at U.S.
News, argued that the rankings are useful when com
bined with other sources of information.
"It's very important to us that students read across
the line [of university statistics]," he said. "We're confi
dent that most of them use the rankings as they were
meant to be used —as a starting point for further re
search to find the schools that are best for them.
"We rank the schools because the information is al

ready there — it would be a cop-out if we didn't."
The magazine's methodology remains largely un
changed from last year. I Tie data, most of which are col
lected from the colleges themselves, include peer as
sessment, graduation and retention rates, faculty re
sources, student selectivity, financial resources, alumni
giving, and graduation-rate performance (a compari
son between predicted and actual graduation rates).
Among this year's additions to the list are rank-

ings of academic programs —
such as internships/co-ops,
study abroad and writing in the
disciplines — reputed to in
crease student success. In these
new categories, Stanford tied
for first in service learning and
ranked in the top 10 for senior
capstone (honors thesis), first
year experiences and under
graduate research.
According to sophomore Jen
nifer Carr, the college rankings
and statistics didn't give her the in
formation she really needed when
trying to select a school suited to
her interests.
"They don't tell you anything
useful," Carr said. "I wish that they
would have said, 'If you're interest
ed in literary critic ism, maybe you
should be headed in a Yale direc
tion [instead of Stanford].' There
was nothing that told me that this
place was so technical."
Of course, as freshman Karen
Chen noted, students are not the

only ones who use rankings.
"112 wouldn't know anything
about them if it weren't for my par
ents, who recently have taken
pride in pointing out that Stanford
is high on the list," she said. "I
would rather rely on my own ex
perience, research and even in
stincts. So these rankings had ab
solutely no effect on my decision to
come to Stanford."
Chesley expressed disappoint
ment with the magazine's handling
of criticism.
"When a college questions its
methodology, U.S. News avoids the
issue and says that the school is just
upset about its ranking," Chesley
said. "Something which is this im
portant to the public should be
open to debate."
Folkers disagreed with Chesley's
assertions, saying that U.S. News
has held hundreds of meetings with
college faculty and administration,
making many changes over the
years to address concerns.
"We're not here to make colleges
happy," he said. "The rankings are
for the benefit of students and their
families in a decision that's pretty
darned expensive.
