## 
### EDITORIAL STAFF 
Listen up: Stanford students
speak a different language from
the outside world. Call it Stan
fordese, Farmonics or Cardinalin
gÂ°-
Whatever the name, you will
soon be speaking this unique
tongue. lu principle, this regional
language consists of taking two or
more words and rendering them
into catchy little rhythmic smaller
words.
So, to get you hooked on Stan
ford Phonics, here is a short dictio
nary to get you through the next
few days.
Co Ho: The Coffee House. A tra
ditional Stanford hangout in
Tresidder Union that serves food

and drinks such as coffee and
sandwiches.
Co Po: The Corner Pocket. Locat
ed in the corner of Tressider's din
ing area, the Co Po serves pizza by
the slice and frozen yogurt. Often,
it's the best place to head if you
miss the lunch cutoff at your din
ing hall.
Dink: Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The auditorium located across
from the Co 1 fo.
Flo Mo: Florence Moore Hall. A
big dormitory located just off of
the Row, named after a woman
named Florence Moore. She gave
Stanford lots of money. Good
brunch. Great ice cream.

Fro So Co: Freshman Sophomore
College. Fro So Co holds two titles:
First, it is the most isolated and
borderline-off campus dorm, and
second, it lias the biggest and best
rooms you can get as a freshman.
Did somebody say 2-room double?
Fro Yo: Frozen Yogurt. Served at
the Co Po. A substitute for ice
cream. Many Californians are
scared of ice cream because it has
fat in it; thus, they eat fro yo.
Mem Aud: Memorial Auditorium.
An auditorium located across from
Hoover lower. They show Flicks
there every Sunday night. Flicks
are cheap movies wit li paper fights
included.
Mem Chu: Memorial Church. A

non-denominational church locat
ed in the Quad. The pews are hard
wood, but the peaceful atmos
phere of the church make it an
ideal afternoon nap spot.
Moo Goo Gai Pan: Not a part of
Stanford terminology, but a tasty
Chinese dish. Check out JingJing
in Palo Alto if you get a craving.
MuFuUnSun: Music and Fun
Under the Sun. Event that takes
place during Orientation. Find out
about a lot of Stanford clubs. Get
free food.
Pro Fro: Prospective Freshman.
You were one of these once. The
ollicial term is now "admits." 1 his
term is disliked by most students,
as there is no potential Stanfordese

word lor it. Ro Hos (Room Hosts),
students who host pro fros in their
room during Admit Weekend, are
not to be confused with Ho Hos
(I louse I losts), who coordinate the
dorm's pro fro ro ho activities.
Phew.
Res Ed: Residential Education.
Fhe people who put coordinate
educational programs in your dor
mitories all year. No relation to the
horse, Mr. Ed.
So Co: Sophomore College. Billed
as an opportunity to further the
academic pursuits of upcoming
sophomores, So Co is also a good
way to spend a week partying on
campus or take a resort cruise to
Galapagos.

Tres Ex: Tresidder Express. The
on-campus store, located in
Tresidder. They sell Cheetos, de
odorant and other tasty tilings.
For bigger orders, you'll have to
head to Safeway.
To test your knowledge, look at
the following paragraph:
My pro fro from Flo Mo stopped at
the Co Potoget a fro yo 011 her way
back from MuFuUnSun. She ran
into a friend that worked for Res
Clomp in ;i building between the
Go I lo and Dink.
11 this made sense, congratula
tions! And if you realized that
there is 110 building between the
Co Ho and Dink, you're way
ahead of the game.
