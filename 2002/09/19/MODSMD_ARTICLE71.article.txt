# Palo Alto 101: the most un-college college town in America
## 
### RYAN SANDS EDITORIAL STAFF 
Right down the street from tlie
Stanford campus lies a little town
called Palo Alto. You may have
heard of Palo Alto in the recent
survey of national average housing
costs that was published in USA
lod ay 1 1 lis past summer. Palo Alto
topped the list with a whopping av
erage housing cost of 1.8 bajillion
dollars. Downtown, you are more
likely to see a Lexus sports utility
vehicle than an old Volkswagen
Beetle, and you won't find any
record stores, bars for twenty
somethings or live music venues,
lb make the point clear: Palo Alto
is not a college town. Despite this,
it's the c losest city for Stanford kids
and does have quite a few shops
and restaurants that are well worth
chec king out.
Of course, as poor hungry stu
dents, the most important issue is
where to find something to eat.
Though the dining halls will he
doing their damnedest to roll out
delicious and impressive courses on
this weekend's menus, be assured
11 Kit once your parents have lef, and
the real school year is underway,
your dining hall will soon revert to
serving burritos, hamburgers and
pi/za every evening. This may be
your idea of exciting cuisine, but for
the rest of us, the dining hall's dish
es become too much to handle at
some point or another.
In Palo Alto, the best cheap
foods are Thai and Mediterranean
cuisine. Although there is some
contention among our staff as to
which reigns supreme as far as
quality and service goes, both
Royal Siam and Krung "Grand
Opening" Siam offer tasty Thai
food, including dishes of both the
meat-lover and vegetarian persua
sions. Krung Siam also serves up
some wicked Thai iced tea and
fried banana as dessert. Any
evening in which you eat a fried ba
nana is a good evening in my book.
You can wrangle up some good

hummus (and breakfast foods,
strangely enough) at Kan Zenian
or grab a good gyro at Gyros Gyros
near the end of University's main
drag.
Other nice places to get dinner
on the weekends are Janta and the
Mango Gafe. Janta serves up deli
cious Indian food and features a
really pleasant and intimate atmos
phere. Mango Gafe serves up
hearty island foods and huge fruit
slushies. The atmosphere is bit
more lively at the Mango Gafe, and
they usually play a tape of Garni val
activities on the screen above the
door.
Venturing into the realm of en
tertainment, Palo Alto is not usual
ly the locale of choice for those with
automobiles, it definitely provides
some places to spend your evening
when you want to skip the Row
party c irc uit. The gem of Palo Alto
is the Aquarius Theater, which op
erates under the Landmark The
atre chain. The Aquarius brings
the latest independent and inter
national films to our area, along
with its brilliant fall Midnight Mad
ness series.
During every Friday and Satur
day at midnight throughout the
fall, the theatre shows classic films
and gives away free prizes in a pre
screening trivia contest. This week
end's film is "Memento" and up
coming films include, "Better of
Dead," "Bottle Rocket," "Psycho"
and the relentlessly amazing "Pur
ple Rain". If the Aquarius sells out
of tickets, you can walk over to the
less exciting, but more historic,
Stanford Theatre to check out a
musical or black and white film
from the '50's.
Before you head to the theatres,
it's always nice to relax and talk
over a cup of coffee. Pound lor
pound, the University Golfee shop
has the best tasting coffee in Palo
Alto and also features tasty dessert
treats. Or, if you're in the mood for
a cold drink, the (Â« live (lafe serves
up pearl milk tea and delicious
peanut butter thick toast.

Aside from eats and movies,
Palo Alto has some places to get
necessary supplies for the Stanford
dorm life. As far as room decora
tions go, you need look no further
than the Movie Memories Poster
Shop on Waverly, just off of Uni
versity. They stock everything
from current releases to classic film

to underground music posters.
Owner David Kneubuhl has
been running the shop for over 20
years and has amassed quite an im
pressive collection of prints, life
size cardboard stand ups and pro
motional posters. There is surely
something for everyone within his
store walls.

Another key feature of Palo Alto
is its two drug stores, Longs and
Walgreens. Their inventory is
nothing compared to Safeway, but
blows the pants off of any on-cam
pus shopping option. These are
the ideal stores for razor blades,
one-hour photo processing and
laundry detergent. And all within

biking distance.
Hopefully this little guide will
help with you get acquainted with
our neighbor to the east, Palo Alto.
While it's no Haight-Ashbury (or
even Castro St.in Mountain View),
University Ave. does provide some
well-needed distraction from the
daily studying drag at Stanford.
