# Escape from the Stanford Bubble: off-campus trips
## 
### RYAN SANDS EDITORIAL STAFF 
You'll be running around like
crazy during the next few days,
whether you are attending orienta
tion events, meeting everyone in
your dorm or hanging out with
your roommate. The time will
come (most likely it will be sooner
rather than later) that you'll face an
irresistible urge to leave. Yep,
sometimes you just gotta get away
from the Farm.
The big question for car-less
Stanford freshmen is: "How?" The
Class of 2006 will be the first to deal
with the Caltrain's weekend clos
ing. This means that there will be
more obstacles to a Saturday trip to
San Francisco (what Stanford stu
dents call "the City"). Even once
you find a way to get off campus,
the next question is: "Where should

you go?" In this article, I'll give
some pointers on how to get
around the Bay Area and provide
some ideas fora good day trip.
The most obvious (and exciting)
place to go ofF-campus is the beauti
ful city of San Francisco. Our city on
the Bay has the highest density of
coolness per square mile, with
dozens of little neighborhoods,
each with its flavor and attractions.
After spending the past two years
exploring the City, I still find new
restaurants, parks and shops every
time I'm there.
If you are planning to go to San
Francisco during a weeknight, the
best way to get there is on the Cal
train. The Caltrain station is just 15
minute down Palm Drive, or if you
don't want the exercise, the A and B
Marguerite loops meet almost
every train coming and going from
the station. The fare into San Fran-

Cisco is $4.50 and the trip takes
about 70 minutes to complete.
Keep in mind: the last south
bound train leaves San Francisco at
11:59 p.m., so head toward the 4th
and King station by at least 11:30
p.m. If you have an extreme need
to be in the city after midnight,
there is a last-resort option that in
cludes taking a looooooong bus
ride home.
SamTrans bus 397 departs from
Mission and Ist at 1:15 a.m., 2:15
a.m. and 3:15 a.m. This bus takes a
whopping two hours to reach Palo
Alto, but will leave you at the Palo
Alto Caltrain station in the middle
of the night. Seems extreme, but a
two-hour bus ride surely beats
sleeping on the floor of the Caltrain
station.
The Caltrain station in San


San Francisco's Chinatown is one of the many areas of the city you should visit during your freshman year. Stockton
St., pictured above, is filled with Chinese markets, restaurants and shops.
Francisco is not located directly in
downtown, so you'll have to decide
between walking and jumping on a
bus. Within walking distance from
t he Caltrain station is the SFMOMA
(Museum of Modern Art) and Mar
ket St., with its interesting mix of
sex shops and mall retail shopping.
Be careful vent uring back to the sta
tion at night as it gets a bit creepy in
south of Market after dark.
The station is a big hub for buses
that run to Fisherman's Wharf and
Union Square. From Union Square
you can catch a bus to Haight-Ash

bury, Chinatown or Japantown.
You should be sure to visit each of
these areas, but be aware that you
can easily spend a full day in both
Chinatown and Haight. Other ac
cessible and enjoyable areas of the
city include Golden Gate Park, with
its Japanese tea garden and Natur
al History Museum, and the Palace
of Fine Arts, located near the foot of
the Golden Gate Bridge.
Once you're in San Francisco,
Berkeley is just a short BART (Bay
Area Rapid Transit) trip away.
I lome to the Weenies, Berkeley is
also a great place to catch live music,
buy CDs and eat tasty ethnic foods
at cheap prices. No one will really
care either way, but it might make
sense to leave your big red Stanford

sweatshirt home that day.
If you've had enough of the rush
of city life and are looking fora qui
eter place to relax, I suggest visiting
Muir Woods, our closest redwood
forest, or Half Moon Bay, our clos
est beach. The trip to Muir Woods
is a bit difficult without a car, but
you can usually organize a bus ride
from the north San Francisco area
or Fisherman's Wharf. You may
want to call ahead before you un
dertake this trip; I tried to get to
Muir Woods by bus once and found
myself stranded in the beautifully
secluded town of Sausilito.
The best way to get to Half Moon
Bay is to talk an upperclassman into
driving you and your friends. That
said, you could also take the route

294 bus from the Hillsdale Caltrain
station. This takes more than an
hour, but the windy beaches of Half
Moon Bay are a great place to have
a picnic and watch surfers ride the
waves. The coffee shops in the small
downtown are a good place to get
warmed up with hot chocolate after
a day on the Pacific coast.
This brief article is by no way a
definitive list of things to do off
campus. As you make your way
into San Francisco, Berkeley and
San Jose, these cities will start to
feel more and more like your own.
Don't be afraid to break the Stan
ford bubble during your freshman
year — even without a car, there
are countless exciting locales with
in your reach.

care either way, but it might make
sense to leave your big red Stanford

sweatshirt home that day.
If you've had enough of the rush
of city life and are looking fora qui
eter place to relax, I suggest visiting
Muir Woods, our closest redwood
forest, or Half Moon Bay, our clos
est beach. The trip to Muir Woods
is a bit difficult without a car, but
you can usually organize a bus ride
from the north San Francisco area
or Fisherman's Wharf. You may
want to call ahead before you un
dertake this trip; I tried to get to
Muir Woods by bus once and found
myself stranded in the beautifully
secluded town of Sausilito.
The best way to get to Half Moon
Bay is to talk an upperclassman into
driving you and your friends. That
said, you could also take the route

294 bus from the Hillsdale Caltrain
station. This takes more than an
hour, but the windy beaches of Half
Moon Bay are a great place to have
a picnic and watch surfers ride the
waves. The coffee shops in the small
downtown are a good place to get
warmed up with hot chocolate after
a day on the Pacific coast.
This brief article is by no way a
definitive list of things to do off
campus. As you make your way
into San Francisco, Berkeley and
San Jose, these cities will start to
feel more and more like your own.
Don't be afraid to break the Stan
ford bubble during your freshman
year — even without a car, there
are countless exciting locales with
in your reach.
