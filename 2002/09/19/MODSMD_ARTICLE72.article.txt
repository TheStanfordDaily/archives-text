# Escape from the Stanford Bubble: off-campus trips
## 
### RYAN SANDS EDITORIAL STAFF 
You'll be running around like
crazy during the next few days,
whether you are attending orienta
tion events, meeting everyone in
your dorm or hanging out with
your roommate. The time will
come (most likely it will be sooner
rather than later) that you'll face an
irresistible urge to leave. Yep,
sometimes you just gotta get away
from the Farm.
The big question for car-less
Stanford freshmen is: "How?" The
Class of 2006 will be the first to deal
with the Caltrain's weekend clos
ing. This means that there will be
more obstacles to a Saturday trip to
San Francisco (what Stanford stu
dents call "the City"). Even once
you find a way to get off campus,
the next question is: "Where should

you go?" In this article, I'll give
some pointers on how to get
around the Bay Area and provide
some ideas fora good day trip.
The most obvious (and exciting)
place to go ofF-campus is the beauti
ful city of San Francisco. Our city on
the Bay has the highest density of
coolness per square mile, with
dozens of little neighborhoods,
each with its flavor and attractions.
After spending the past two years
exploring the City, I still find new
restaurants, parks and shops every
time I'm there.
If you are planning to go to San
Francisco during a weeknight, the
best way to get there is on the Cal
train. The Caltrain station is just 15
minute down Palm Drive, or if you
don't want the exercise, the A and B
Marguerite loops meet almost
every train coming and going from
the station. The fare into San Fran-

Cisco is $4.50 and the trip takes
about 70 minutes to complete.
Keep in mind: the last south
bound train leaves San Francisco at
11:59 p.m., so head toward the 4th
and King station by at least 11:30
p.m. If you have an extreme need
to be in the city after midnight,
there is a last-resort option that in
cludes taking a looooooong bus
ride home.
SamTrans bus 397 departs from
Mission and Ist at 1:15 a.m., 2:15
a.m. and 3:15 a.m. This bus takes a
whopping two hours to reach Palo
Alto, but will leave you at the Palo
Alto Caltrain station in the middle
of the night. Seems extreme, but a
two-hour bus ride surely beats
sleeping on the floor of the Caltrain
station.
The Caltrain station in San


San Francisco's Chinatown is one of the many areas of the city you should visit during your freshman year. Stockton
St., pictured above, is filled with Chinese markets, restaurants and shops.
