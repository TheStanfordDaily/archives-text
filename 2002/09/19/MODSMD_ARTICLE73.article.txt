# So long Tres Ex: grocery shopping, Stanford style
## How to get your groceries on a student budget 
### ALICE KIM EDITORIAL STAFF 
So you've come to the startling realization
that Tresidder Express has nothing but expen
sive snacks and nail clippers. So you've eaten at
the dining hall, a road which leads nowhere. If
you are one of the many freshmen who have en
joyed food and wish to keep eating it, where do
you go? Use this short, rude, helpful guide to
ease your entry into the world of Eating Food At
Stanford.
Where Not To Go
Stanford Shopping Center. 1 swear, if you
shop at the Stanford Shopping Center, you are
one sorry sucka. You would probably be so rich
that your food would be flown to you from
France, as are your toiletries and video games,
so why would you go to the Stanford Shopping
Center in the first place?
Mainly, it's expensive. Andronico's Market
sells crazy exotic rich people food, and it tastes
quite good. I am only telling you not to go here

because ii is expensive, and I care about you.
Where To Go
San Antonio Shopping Center. This is it.
Take the right Marguerite, and you will be in
the land of Wal Mart, Rite Aid, Target and
Funcoland.
Before coming to Stanford, I had never been
to Wal Mart. I was missing out. Wal Mart is a
great place for buying questionable groceries.
There are no fresh meats, fruits or natural prod
ucts sold there, but in its place you will find off
brand cookies and Mexican soda. Packaged
foods are plentiful and cheap. Besides food, Wal
Mart also sells everything, from shampoo and
ugly t-shirts to Frisbees. Wal Mart is a great
place.
Funcoland is where video games and other
such things are sold. I have never been there,
but have heard good things about it.
Secret Safeway. I don't know why this is called
the Secret Safeway. Once again, you take the
Marguerite to Sharon Heights, and you will find
a nice Safeway tucked away in an unassuming
shopping center.
It sells what Wal Mart does not: normal gro
ceries, fresh foods and recognizable brands.


The car toll to cross the Golden Gate Bridge was recently raised to $5, but the views of the San Francisco Bay, inclusding Alcatraz
and the Angel Islands, make this a must-visit locale.
