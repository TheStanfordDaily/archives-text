# Be safe: lock your door, bike
## Tips for campus safety 
### EDITORIAL STAFF 
Greetings from cheery resident assistants,
helping hands from smiling Orientation Vol
unteers and introductions to 100 new light
hearted faces. Stanford seems like a pretty se
cure place to many new students.
In making the transition to campus life,
however, freshmen and transfer students often
become overly trusting and rather careless
during their first few days on the Farm.
And why shouldn't they? In a recent study
of 58 schools called "Crime at College: the Stu
dent Guide to Public Safety," Stanford was
ranked one of the 15 safest campuses in the na
tion.
But don't be tooled. Crime does occur here
on the Farm — and the atmosphere of Orien
tation can be the ideal time for crooks to make
their mark.
In most cases, however, simple precaution
ary measures can help deter theft from ruining
a good first year.
Lock that bike
For the past decade and a half, the number
one reported crime on campus has been bicy
cle theft.
Bike theft soared as high as 800 bikes a year
in the early- to mid-19905. I lowever, the num
ber has dropped in recent years due to a recent
$1-million project devoted to improving facili
ties for bicyclists.
In 1998, nearly 400 bicycles were stolen.
Two hundred thirteen were stolen in 1997.
Since 1995, Stanford's bicycle program has
created enclosures for 550 bikes and installed
or upgraded 3,000 bike rack spaces, according
to the Stanford Report.
In addition to creating new spaces, the pro
gram has also freed up existing spaces by crack
ing down on abandoned bikes.
Stanford Police speculate the actual num
ber of thefts is twice the reported number, be
cause many students do not bother to report
their stolen bikes.
To avoid becoming one of the many unfor
tunate victims, the police advise students to
lock up their bicycles. Although U-locks are the
most effective locking devices, Stanford police
also recommend a safety device known as" Bad
Bones," which spans the length of the lock and
can make it five times stronger.
In recent years the Stanford Police have

worked to be more visible and catch more
bike thieves. Police stress the necessity ol reg
istering bikes. As Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer told the Daily in 1998,
"without a victim, we can't prosecute [a
thief]."
Dorm safety
Ideally, dorm residences should be locked up
after midnight. This is usually not the case,
however, since students go in and out of their
dorms well after that time. Many choose to
prop the door open as they make their early
morning rounds.
Fortunately, burglars do not usually try
their luck in the dorms after midnight. Instead,
many know when students won't be in and hit
the dorms while most students are at lunch,
dinner or in the shower.
There is, however, a simple solution to keep
from becoming a statistic: Keep doors locked
whenever rooms are empty, even if it will be
fora short period of time. Many students keep
their keys on nametag cords that they can con
veniently wear around their necks.
Concerns about assault
Compared to property crime, "body crime"
(i.e. aggravated and sexual assault) is relatively
rare on the Stanford campus.
Most sexual assaults are acquaintance (or
date) rape and often involve alcohol, say police.
SURE Escort Service is available and will ac
company students by motorized cart anywhere
on campus. Students can contact the free ser
vice by calling 725-SURE.
Perhaps the most important crime-bust
ing tip is personal awareness and responsi
bility. If a situation feels suspicious or threat
ening, change directions, go to a populated
area, call a friend to meet you or call 9-911
from a campus phone or 911 from an oil
campus phone.
If you are the victim of a crime, call the po
lice immediately. When a crime goes unreport
ed, a criminal may attack again. Also make sure
to report any suspicious persons, vehicles or ac
tivities to the police.
I'he Sexual Assault Resource Center lo
cated in Cowell Student Health Center is
open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Fri
day for information and counseling.
In addition, the Campus Sexual Assault
and Recovery Team is available 8:30 a.m. to
5 p.m. (also in Cowell) and operates 24-hour
crisis services.
