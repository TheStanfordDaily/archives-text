# This one time, at Stanford... Freshman memories
## 
### EDITORIAL STAFF 
Life without parents, rules and the com
forts of your own home can often lead to
embarrassing situations. Our readers and
staff share their worst freshman moments:
"The Arroyo pool table had a broken leg,
so some of us decided to throw it from the
third balcony. Apparently some people in
Cedro thought that it was an earthquake
— we learned it's against the honor code to
throw a 'two ton' object off a balcony."
"My freshman year roommate rushed a
fraternity during winter quarter. He was
not allowed to speak to anyone who was
not either rushing the fraternity or already
in the fi at. For the first few days, I thought
he had a new girlfriend. When the thrice
nightly calls — at 2 a.m., 4 a.m. and 6 a.m.
— checking to see if my roommate was in
t lie room started to happen, 1 suspected
something else. And the bricks and paddle
in his book bag soon confirmed my suspi
cions."
"At a party in an all-freshman dorm, I was
among the number of underage people in
the possession of alcohol. However, I was
the only one swift enough to greet the cop
who busted the party with a, 'Hello, offi
cer.' My parents were most thrilled with
the MI P."
"Freshman year, I had heard a lot of talk
about the 'Century Club,' so I really want

ed to do one. So on a Sunday night, I did.
By myself. Absolutely pathetic."
"My freshman year I lived in Larkin. One
morning the first week of school, the show
ers were all full in Larkin North, so rather
than wait, I decided to shower in Larkin
West. After the shower, I went across the
catwalk back to Larkin North and realized
1 hadn't brought my keys with me. 1 was to
tally wet, wrapped in my towel with my
arms full, knocking on the door. Pen min
utes and many amused bikers later, some
one finally opened the door for me."
"My secret snowflake made me stand up in
the middle of the dining hall and discuss —
in detail — my first crush, my first kiss, the
first time a boy touched my boobies.. .it
went on. Then I cried."
"During my freshman year, my roommate
had an especially sketchy night and
hooked up with two girls consecutively. A
month later, I met someone at a party in
Larkin. When she found out who my
roommate was, she almost immediately
asked me what I thought of him. I said,
'Well, he's nice, but he's a big womanizer.'
After she asked me to clarify, I revealed
that about a month ago, he had slept with
two different girls in one night. When she
became upset, the wheels in my head start
ed turning through my alcohol-induced
haze. I again asked for her name and
dorm, and finally something clicked: This
was the second girl from the night of

sketchiness!"
"One niglii during freshman year, I was
in my boyfriend's loom when someone
knocked on the door. As we weren't in the
most appropriate situation to answer the
door, my boyfriend decided that if it was
his roommate, he would just let himself
in, and if it was someone else, we could
just pretend we weren't in there. A few
minutes later, the door opened, and the
RA walked in, observed the situation and
said C)li, you are in here,' turned around
and left. I could never look the RAin the
eye again."
"The only ever time I've gotten depressed -
drunk was (appropriately) in the winter of
my freshman year. Alter leaving notes for
my 112 riends proclaiming that 1 was going to
'quit life,' I went to bed. When they came
and woke me up, I named two of my beer
cans Hob and Jim and announced they
were my best friends. But they betrayed
me, so I took my printer into bed. But it
printed my desktop out crooked, so then I
had no friends. That night sucked."
"I went to the Jell-O party at the Deke
house and drank a bit too much. I barely
got my bike unlocked and managed to go
20 feet down the sidewalk before swerving
into the hedge. A cop picked me up off the
ground, got my bike, warned me about
California's BUI (biking under the influ
ence) laws and then walked me home. I
found pine needles in my clothes the next

day; everyone in my dorm on ragged me
for weeks.''
"We decided to raid Junipero one evening,
so about 30 freshmen dressed up all in
black with bandanas and water pistols and
ran over to J unipero. Upon entering ju
nipero, we shot whoever happened to be in
the hall at the time — which happened to
be some poor frosh girl and Marc Wais. Of
course, this was week two of school, so we
didn't know he was the Dean of Students -
so that was, innin, a bad move. Wais was
pretty pissed, especially since we ruined
the art mural on the windows."
"Spring my frosh year, I got extremely
drunk at the Band's spring all-campus
rally. When I came back to my room, I
tossed a bleach bottle across our room and
onto my roommate's futon. The cap was
loose, leaked all night and burned a 6-inch
hole his comforter cover."
"It seems that all good ideas are created at
Sunday brunch when you're hungover
after a night of drinking. At one such
brunch, my roommate and I were trying to
figure out where 1 could store the race of 3-
foot tall mini-me's I was going to spawn
and decided that a ball pit would be the
best place. Two weeks after some extensive
Internet searching, 1,500 plastic balls and
an inflatable pod-pool arrived at our door.
For the next six months, it was an excellent
breeding ground for tomfoolery and bally
hoo. Unfortunately, I'm still waiting for my

minions to come.
"Two weeks after the United States began
bombing Afghanistan, I took a break from
my lIIUM reading to wander around the
dorm when I ran into six other residents in
the lobby. They were playing guitar, piano,
violin and singing. It was two in the morn
ing, and despite the horror of the outside
world, these six kids had taken time out ol
their life to spontaneously make music. It
was one of the most beautiful moments I've
had at Stanford."
"My freshman year roommate and I got
along pretty well for most of the school
year, despite the fact that he was a homo
phobic conservative Christian who would
beat up anyone who drank alcohol in our
room. Because I wasn't gay and didn't
drink alcohol, his somewhat intolerant
views didn't affect our roommate relation
ship. But one day during spring quarter
everything changed. He told me that he
joined the Promise Keepers, an all-male
Christian organization, and it was his duty
to spread the word of Jesus. Because I
wasn't Christian and didn't want to be con
verted, our roommate relationship took a
turn for the worst. It didn't help that he
also began walking around the room com
pletely naked. Things got so bad that at the
end of the year, he stole my Ethernet cable.
Therefore, in retaliation I hit him where it
hurt the most —I sold his Bible to the
Stanford Bookstore and received eight
dollars for it."

'Well, he's nice, but he's a big womanizer.'
After she asked me to clarify, I revealed
that about a month ago, he had slept with
two different girls in one night. When she
became upset, the wheels in my head start
ed turning through my alcohol-induced
haze. I again asked for her name and
dorm, and finally something clicked: This
was the second girl from the night of

sketchiness!"
"One niglii during freshman year, I was
in my boyfriend's loom when someone
knocked on the door. As we weren't in the
most appropriate situation to answer the
door, my boyfriend decided that if it was
his roommate, he would just let himself
in, and if it was someone else, we could
just pretend we weren't in there. A few
minutes later, the door opened, and the
RA walked in, observed the situation and
said C)li, you are in here,' turned around
and left. I could never look the RAin the
eye again."
"The only ever time I've gotten depressed -
drunk was (appropriately) in the winter of
my freshman year. Alter leaving notes for
my 112 riends proclaiming that 1 was going to
'quit life,' I went to bed. When they came
and woke me up, I named two of my beer
cans Hob and Jim and announced they
were my best friends. But they betrayed
me, so I took my printer into bed. But it
printed my desktop out crooked, so then I
had no friends. That night sucked."
"I went to the Jell-O party at the Deke
house and drank a bit too much. I barely
got my bike unlocked and managed to go
20 feet down the sidewalk before swerving
into the hedge. A cop picked me up off the
ground, got my bike, warned me about
California's BUI (biking under the influ
ence) laws and then walked me home. I
found pine needles in my clothes the next

day; everyone in my dorm on ragged me
for weeks.''
"We decided to raid Junipero one evening,
so about 30 freshmen dressed up all in
black with bandanas and water pistols and
ran over to J unipero. Upon entering ju
nipero, we shot whoever happened to be in
the hall at the time — which happened to
be some poor frosh girl and Marc Wais. Of
course, this was week two of school, so we
didn't know he was the Dean of Students -
so that was, innin, a bad move. Wais was
pretty pissed, especially since we ruined
the art mural on the windows."
"Spring my frosh year, I got extremely
drunk at the Band's spring all-campus
rally. When I came back to my room, I
tossed a bleach bottle across our room and
onto my roommate's futon. The cap was
loose, leaked all night and burned a 6-inch
hole his comforter cover."
"It seems that all good ideas are created at
Sunday brunch when you're hungover
after a night of drinking. At one such
brunch, my roommate and I were trying to
figure out where 1 could store the race of 3-
foot tall mini-me's I was going to spawn
and decided that a ball pit would be the
best place. Two weeks after some extensive
Internet searching, 1,500 plastic balls and
an inflatable pod-pool arrived at our door.
For the next six months, it was an excellent
breeding ground for tomfoolery and bally
hoo. Unfortunately, I'm still waiting for my

minions to come.
"Two weeks after the United States began
bombing Afghanistan, I took a break from
my lIIUM reading to wander around the
dorm when I ran into six other residents in
the lobby. They were playing guitar, piano,
violin and singing. It was two in the morn
ing, and despite the horror of the outside
world, these six kids had taken time out ol
their life to spontaneously make music. It
was one of the most beautiful moments I've
had at Stanford."
"My freshman year roommate and I got
along pretty well for most of the school
year, despite the fact that he was a homo
phobic conservative Christian who would
beat up anyone who drank alcohol in our
room. Because I wasn't gay and didn't
drink alcohol, his somewhat intolerant
views didn't affect our roommate relation
ship. But one day during spring quarter
everything changed. He told me that he
joined the Promise Keepers, an all-male
Christian organization, and it was his duty
to spread the word of Jesus. Because I
wasn't Christian and didn't want to be con
verted, our roommate relationship took a
turn for the worst. It didn't help that he
also began walking around the room com
pletely naked. Things got so bad that at the
end of the year, he stole my Ethernet cable.
Therefore, in retaliation I hit him where it
hurt the most —I sold his Bible to the
Stanford Bookstore and received eight
dollars for it."
Life without parents, rules and the com
forts of your own home can often lead to
embarrassing situations. Our readers and
staff share their worst freshman moments:
"The Arroyo pool table had a broken leg,
so some of us decided to throw it from the
third balcony. Apparently some people in
Cedro thought that it was an earthquake
— we learned it's against the honor code to
throw a 'two ton' object off a balcony."
"My freshman year roommate rushed a
fraternity during winter quarter. He was
not allowed to speak to anyone who was
not either rushing the fraternity or already
in the fi at. For the first few days, I thought
he had a new girlfriend. When the thrice
nightly calls — at 2 a.m., 4 a.m. and 6 a.m.
— checking to see if my roommate was in
t lie room started to happen, 1 suspected
something else. And the bricks and paddle
in his book bag soon confirmed my suspi
cions."
"At a party in an all-freshman dorm, I was
among the number of underage people in
the possession of alcohol. However, I was
the only one swift enough to greet the cop
who busted the party with a, 'Hello, offi
cer.' My parents were most thrilled with
the MI P."
"Freshman year, I had heard a lot of talk
about the 'Century Club,' so I really want

ed to do one. So on a Sunday night, I did.
By myself. Absolutely pathetic."
"My freshman year I lived in Larkin. One
morning the first week of school, the show
ers were all full in Larkin North, so rather
than wait, I decided to shower in Larkin
West. After the shower, I went across the
catwalk back to Larkin North and realized
1 hadn't brought my keys with me. 1 was to
tally wet, wrapped in my towel with my
arms full, knocking on the door. Pen min
utes and many amused bikers later, some
one finally opened the door for me."
"My secret snowflake made me stand up in
the middle of the dining hall and discuss —
in detail — my first crush, my first kiss, the
first time a boy touched my boobies.. .it
went on. Then I cried."
"During my freshman year, my roommate
had an especially sketchy night and
hooked up with two girls consecutively. A
month later, I met someone at a party in
Larkin. When she found out who my
roommate was, she almost immediately
asked me what I thought of him. I said,
'Well, he's nice, but he's a big womanizer.'
