# The 						top ten things you should know about Stanford

### RYAN SANDS EDITORIAL STAFF 
Welcome to The Daily's top ten
things you should know about
Stanford that you won't learn (lur
ing Freshman Orientation:
10. Green Library has an ex
tensive library of FREE
videos and DVDs. You'll have
to watch the videos in the li
brary's cushy viewing chairs,
but you can check the DVDs
out overnight. Be sure to get
them back on time because
Green charges humongous
late fees.
9. The Bender Room couch
es are the best way to spend
that down time between
your 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
classes. Kick off your shoes,
lay out and take a nap.
8. I-Hum reading. Whatever.
7. Don't forget about the
Foothills. On a clear day you
can see Berkeley and San
Francisco from the top of the
hills. It is a trek worth making
â€” bring your camera!
6. Watch out for bike cops
on the last day of every

month. They'll never admit it,
but the Santa Clara County
Police Department has a tick
et quota and will bust you on
Santa Teresa St.. Be careful
and stop at stop signs on
those days.
5. Spend your Wednesday
nights at EBF The Enchanted
Broccoli Forest's HAPPY
HOUR parties provide free
beer, live music and an eclec
tic crowd of cool kids.
4. Befriend people with cars,
printers and computer
knowledge. This is impera
tive as a freshman.
3. Do some exploring and
see if the abandoned tree
house at the southwest
edge of Lake Lagunita is still
around. Rumor has it that the
University tore it down last
year, but you should go hik
ing and check for yourself.
2. "Screw Your Roommate"
is only a figure of speech.
1. The Facebook: Learn it,
live it, love it.
