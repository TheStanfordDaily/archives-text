# Dating: a hopeful endeavor
## 
### MIKEY LEE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Okay. So during this next week, you'll begin to
understand the value of the famous Freshman
Facebook that was stashed in the orientation good
ie bag you received when you got here. If you're
lucky enough to keep it away from scheming up
pcrclassmen out to rob the cradle, you'll find your
self honing your memorization skills as you circle,
highlight and bookmark your way to lustful bliss
with your choice of any or all of 1,00 half-inch black
and white squares. After you ignite your inner stalk
er, you can join your roommate in celebrating the
jaw-dropping beauty of Amy from Alondra or
Matthew from Zapata. Then things split off, and
you can either take the road of the bed-wetting
recluse and Google-searching weirdo, or that of the
normal college kid: dating.
For those of you with girlfriends or boyfriends
back home, read on. In about two months, Turkey
Drop takes place, and you, too, will face very real
breakup situations while you're home for Thanks
giving break. For those of you who manage to sur
vive the Drop and would prefer to be kissing the
webcam window on your computer goodnight in
stead of warm lips, you have my blessing. May you
live happily ever after. For the rest of you single
frosh, here's some advice on dating.
First things first. The Myth about there being no
dating at Stanford is not true. Well, not entirely.
While you may find the fact that Amy from Alondra
sits in the front row of Chem 32 is incredibly sexy,
it may be the same fact that won't get you any fur
ther than midterm notes . . . and that's if you're re
ally lucky. Therein lies the rub . . . it's not that peo
ple here are asexual. It's that they're sometimes too
busy to date. It's up to you to make it happen.
Now, if you happen to be just like Amy from
Alondra, you might be fine. If lectures aren't your
scene because you're too busy taking notes, sections
tend to be the place where people get to know each
other best in an academic setting. Don't get intimi
dated by the Heidi klum look-alike sitting across
from you. Just express your opinion honestly and
who knows? She might just like you for who you are
and not who you think she thinks you should be.
Work hard, play hard, right? Well, the weekend
can be your chance to let loose and party hard. Frat
parties will be advertised, handfuls and kegfuls at a

time. Go with friends, don't think too much, drink
as much as you want and then hit the dance floor.
If hanging out and chatting it up with new people
is more your thing, go all-out and don't be shy. At
the end of the night, who knows what II happen?
I lookups take place often, but drunken passionate
nights that actually lead to real relationships are
few and far between.
Dormcest is your most convenient option. It's
also by far the messiest. While it's nice to run into
your sweetie when you're on your way to the show
er — and while it's one less worry when the Walk of
Shame is only ten steps down the hall — when the
two of you break up, you'll be stuck being sad or bit
ter every time you eat a meal or go to your house
meeting.
Oh, right. Dating. If you can't already tell, the
blatant recommendation to participate in dating (at
least the "serious" kind) has been avoided like the
plague (and discussion of STDs, as well, but stay
tuned to Roxy Sass articles for that). Why? Go have
fun. Go meet new people. Go with the flow. There's
plenty of time fora serious girlfriend these next
four years.
It's been said, "Sleep, socialize, study. . . Pick
two." For the most part, this is true, but if you're
gonna sit inside and hit the books all day, you're
missing out on meeting some amazing people from
as far away as Damariscotta MF or Miami, FL.
Don't forget that there are even people whose
homes are halfway around the world — as far as
Senegal, Turkey or hell .. . even Canada, eh?
Go on small dates. You'll read and hear about all
kinds of cool ideas — from cheap dates like movies
at the Stanford Theater, picnics in the Foothills or
the tried and true CoHo date — to free dates like
most "smaller-sport" Stanford Athletic events, the
Cantor Aits Center or FLiCKs (snag a friend's sea
son pass . . . you'll find they get more abundant as
finals draw nearer). If you've saved up some of your
paychecks from your job at The Stanford Fund,
maybe you can splurge on a day in the City, dinner
in Palo Alto (it's unlikely that you'll ever conquer
the huge selection of restaurants here ... even in
four years) or a night spent bowling at the Palo Alto
Howl. Follow any of the above with the oft-craved
taste ofColdstone Creamery, and you'll have your
self a night that you probably won't forget. At least
not as quickly as your rough draft for your first I-
Uum paper.
