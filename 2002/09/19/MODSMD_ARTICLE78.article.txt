## 
### EDITORIAL STAFF 
Welcome lo Stanford, and wel
come to your new dormitory —
your home tor the next nine
months. As yon become acquainted
with the campus, you will begin to
discover that there is a lot of history
here. Your dormitory is no excep
tion.
1 lore is a brief history of each res
idence that will be home to freshmen
during this year.
Branner Hall
Sadly, Branner I lall has closed its
doors for the 2002-2003 school year.
Because of this, the rest of campus
has become even more crowded
than usual. Clan somebody say,
"Branner sucks?"
Florence Moore Hall
Otherwise known as Flo Mo, this
dormitory opened in the fall of 1956.
The dorm made headlines for its in
credible cost. I he structure c<>ntains
seven different divisions — Alondra,
Cardenal, Faisan, Gavilan, Loro,
Mirlo and Paloma — and cost over
$2.65 million to build. Of that, over
$1 million was donated by Florence
Moore. Her husband, Robert
Moore, joins her in having a resi
dence named after him, a Row
house called Robert S. Moore South
or, more commonly, Bob.
Over the years, Flo Mo has flip
flopped between being an all-male
and an all-female residence; it is cur
rently coed. It has been renovated
several times. An improvement pro
ject was completed in 1975, costing
$1.3 million. Housing for about 100
students was also added in the 1975
renovation.
Flo Mo may best be known for
three things. First, it houses the only
residential Introduction to the Hu
manities track: Structured Liberal
Education or SLK. Second, most
rooms boast panoramic views thanks
to their wall to wall windows. Third,
ice cream is served daily in the din
ing hall, fhe often-recounted story

is that Florence Moore gave the
money to build the residence on the
condition that dessert be served
every day.
Lagunita Court
This set of dorms, which also
shares its name with Stanford's now
delunct artificial lake, was construct
ed in 1933. Today it is home to five
four-class houses: Adelfa, Fucalipto,
Granada, Naranja and Ujamaa.
Referred to affectionately as "the
fire trap," lagunita has seen at least
one major fire in its history. I he res
ident fellows'apartment in West La
gunita burned down in November
1974. The fire, which caused
$12,000 in damage, was ruled acci
dental.
In March of 1976, theOlivo Mag
nolia house, as it was called then,
changed its name to Ujamaa, a
Swahili word meaning "family
hood." Ujamaa is the African-Amer
ican ethnic theme dorm.
Lag is notorious for its freshman
doubles, which are the size of upper
class singles.
Muwekma-Tah-Ruk
Muwekma is the Native-Ameri
can theme house. Its name means
"House of the People" in the
Muwekma language and was named
in honor of an Ohlone tribe indige
nous to the area.
The house hosts a summer im
mersion program for incoming un
dergraduates to stay for three weeks.
Originally open only to upperclass
men, Muwekma has housed fresh
men since 1993. Six of 28 residents
every year since then have been
freshmen.
Muwekma is one of the main
sponsors for the Stanford Powwow,
one of the largest in the country,
held during spring quarter.
Roble Hall
I he oldest active dormitory on
campus, Roble Hall arguably has
ihe most interesting history of any
dorm on campus. Roble, which

means "oak" in Spanish, opened in
its current location in 1918 as a
women's residence. When it was
constructed, records showed it was
built entirely with reinforced con
crete. I lowever, it was discovered in
a 1987 review of dormitories for
earthquake safety that the records
were incorrect.
After discovering that the exteri
or walls were made of a hollow clay
tile with a reinforced concrete floor
and frame, Roble was determined to
be the least safe building on campus
in the case of an earthquake. In fact
it was so unsafe that the University
closed the dormitory. On Dec. 19,
1987, it closed its doors and its resi
dents were relocated when they
came back from winter break. Many
of the 294 displaced students tried
to convince the University to let
them stay through the year, saying
they would take their chances. I low
ever, their pleas were to no avail.
Afer renovations, Roble reopened
the following year.

Stern Hall
Lucie Stern Hall, the concrete block
of dormitories located on die eastern
portion of campus, opened in 1949.
fhe $ 1.2-million dormitory was par
tially built on money given by "Aunt"
Lucie Stern, a Palo Alto socialite
known for her weekly dinner parties
for Stanford students.
A long-time Stanford benefactor,
made an honorary member of the
student body in 1946 by the ASSU,
Stern passed away the same year.
She left a bequest in her will for
$400,000 to build a men's dormito
ry, and ultimately another $200,000
from her estate was given to Stan
ford to build the dorm that would
bear her name.
Stern Hall's unique, square archi
tectural style has been much-ma
ligned since before its opening. Reno
vated in 1995, Stern now is die color of
a slight ly pale pumpkin. There are six
different houses: Burbank, Dormer,
Larkin, Sena, Twain and Casa Zapa

ta, the Chicano/ Latino theme dorm.
Stern's huge dining hall is home to the
Stern Cyber Cafe , serving late-night
snacks until 2 a.m. on weeknights.
Wilbur Hall
Wilbur Hall, built in 1956, was
named after Ray Lyman Wilbur,
who became Stanford's president in
1916. He retired as president in
1941, but he actually stayed on as
president until 1943 while a replace
ment was sought. I le also served as
the Secretary of the Interior under
U.S. President Herbert Hoover, a
Stanford alumnus, from 1929 to
1933. Wilbur has been known as a
perennially unpopular residence.
However, it gained a new lite after
renovation in 1993. It consists of
eight houses: Arroyo, Cedro, Ju
nipero, Otero, Rinconada, Soto,
'francos and Okada, the Asian-
American theme dorm.
Wilbur's dining hall was renovat
ed over the past year and now runs
on the point system. Ice cream,

slushies, candy, chips and produce
are now sold in the dining hall.
Freshman / Sophomore College
Fhe Freshman / Sophomore Col
lege, known as FroSoCo, started as a
trial residential program a few years
ago, but is now an established hous
ing option for incoming freshmen.
Built in 1982 and named after
Stanford's fifth president, J.E. Wal
lace Sterling, Sterling Quad's four
houses were originally coed and
home to upperclassmen.
Of the four houses in the dorm,
Schiff and Adams house the partici
pants of FroSoCo. These two houses,
though the most removed freshmen
dorms from central campus, provide
one of the only 2-room doubles
available to Stanford freshmen. The
two adjacent houses, Potter and
Robinson, retain their status as coed,
upperclass dorms.
