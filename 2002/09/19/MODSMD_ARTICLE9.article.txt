### MARK DOMINIK ANTHONY HA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Coming to a new country to at
tend college can be both scary and
exciting. On Sept. 17, 130 new in
ternational undergraduates ar
rived a few days early for Interna
tional Student Orientation.
The purpose of ( )rientation is to
let new international students
make friends with each other and
to help acclimate them to the Unit
ed States.
"International Student Orienta
tion is an opportunity for interna
tional students to form strong
friendships with each other," said
senior Filip Krsmanovic, an Orien
tation volunteer 112 rom Serbia.
"Stanford is a really big place,
and the new international students
will be spread out all over campus.
It is really important that they form
friends with other international
students during Orientation," Krs
manovic continued.
Many international students
are overwhelmed when they first
arrive on campus. They have
come to a new country where

they may not know anyone and
have to deal with legal issues
about which American students
do not need to worry.
"Campus is really big," said
112 reshman James Lin, from Taiwan.
"I was overwhelmed by all the
packets and all the courses. Orien
tation is a nice way to relax before
school starts."
After arriving on Tuesday, all of
the entering international under
graduates ate together and met
each other. Robin Mamlet, dean of
admissions and financial aid, ad
dressed the group.
Said Wenzheng Veo, a fresh
man from Singapore, "It was
very nice to meet so many peo
ple. Dinner was nice — we
talked to each other a lot. We got
to talk about how we feel as in
ternational students coming to
the United States."
Added Bert Rickly, a student
from Costa Rica whose parents are
from Germany and Holland, "1
met students from all over the
world. It was really nice."
The final event of International
Student Orientation is on Monday.
"On Monday we are throwing a

party for all of the entering inter
national students and their new
American friends," said sopho
more Su Fen Lee, 112 rom Singapore,
who is an Orientation volunteer
and president of the International
Undergraduate Community.
"After that, the International
Undergraduate Community takes
over, and it organizes events
throughout tht* year."
While International Student
Orientation can be a lot of fun,
there are also many practical issues

to take care of During the Orienta
tion, there will be two trips to the
San Antonio Shopping Center al
lowing students to purchase items
such as bedding and bicycles.
In the end, "the goal of Interna
tional Student Orientation is to
help international students inte
grate themselves into Stanford as
seamlessly as possible," said Cliar
lene Ward, president of the Com
munity Committee for Interna
tional Students, a volunteer arm of
Bec htel International Center.
