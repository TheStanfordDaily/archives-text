The right investor gets behind the right company at the
right time. The company grows. The investment grows.
And a brilliant idea comes to market.
That's emerging growth.
It takes focus. Every banker, analyst and trader, the whole
sales staff. Focused on a small, select group of companies.
And knowledge-a deep, insightful knowledge-that can dis
tinguish brilliant ideas from ideas.
Bringing these ideas to life takes credibility. The banker
must be a proven ally. The analyst the authority. The trad
er, the top market maker. The salesperson trusted.
Putting it all together, that's the art. Impact is the result.
Why not work at an investment bank where you can have
impact? Impact on client interaction, relationships, on
your career.
With offices in Boston and San Francisco, Adams, Harkness
& Hill is a privately held, institutional investment bank
focused on emerging growth companies in the technology,
healthcare and consumer sectors.
In investment banking, impact is an art.
