At Janus, we believe that
picking companies is a lot
like picking employees.
Only the best will do.

companies in the world to invest in, one at a time.

bright, diligent, motivated people who have a creative streak and a
passion to learn. Sound like an opportunity worth exploring?
Janus is seeking Research Analysts to work side by side with some
amazingly talented individuals, finding opportunities to invest
more than $130 billion for our 3 million investors. We're
looking for independent thinkers from all types of backgrounds,
regardless of major, who will jump in on day one to help
