## Hurricane pounds Yucatan

MERIDA, Mexico (AP) — Hur
ricane Isidore shredded trees and
forced tens of thousands to flee
their homes Sunday along the coast
of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and
then turned inland toward Merida,
the Yucatan state capitol.
The U.S. National Hurricane
Center said the Category 3 storm
could grow stronger and veer to
ward Louisiana or Texas.
At 8 p.m. EOT, Isidore was
about 20 miles east of Merida. It was
heading west at about 8 mph — a
path expected to continue for at
least a day.
The U.S. National Hurricane
Center said Isidore's maximum
sustained winds were down slight
ly to 120 mph and could weaken
further until it re-emerges over
water in the Gulf of Mexico early
Monday.
In Merida, a city of 800,000,
roaring winds blew torrents of rain
sideways. Streets, some littered
with downed branches, began to
flood and power was cut. Many
buses had been diverted to help
with evacuations.

Normally thriving with street
vendors and bands on Sundays, the
plaza was nearly abandoned as a
few drenched residents raced for
shelter, some holding flapping
sheets of plastic for protection.
"We feel for people who have
homes of trees and straw," said
j ulio Cesar, a security guard at a su
permarket where people rushed to
stock up with storm supplies such as
candles and bread.
"I'm supposed to lly out at noon
tomorrow, but I'm guessing that's
not going to happen," said Richard
Syrop, a 22-year-old grocery man
ager at a health food store in Tuc
son, Ariz., who found a seat at the
only open restaurant on the plaza,
where the wind howled and
moaned through the century-old
trees.
Yucatan state Gov. Patricio
Padron said "the worst of scenar
ios" was happening as the 125-mph
hurricane raked t he coast through
out the day. It then headed inland
toward the capital.
With many areas cut oil by tele
phone or road, the governor said

he had no reports of deaths and no
estimate of damage. I le said, how
ever, that some coastal residents
had rejected his mandatory evacu
ation order aimed at 70,000 people.
Police and troops went house-to
house to evacuate people from
coastal towns and villages and offi
cials canceled classes for 480,000
students to free classrooms for use
as shelters.
Isidore dumped 12 to 20 inches
of rain on the sparsely populated
northern coastline of the peninsula,
knocking out phone and power
services to small villages.
1 lundreds of fishermen had re
turned to shore and secured small
boats as the storm neared Progreso,
said Capt. Alberto Ordaz Galindo,
in charge of navigation for the port
captain's office there.
"There is nobody in danger
now" at sea, he said by telephone.
Torrential rains associated with
Isidore caused floodingthat killed a
16-year-old boy and an 89-year-old
man on Nicaragua's Pacific Coast
and authorities there bused hun
dreds of families to higher ground.
