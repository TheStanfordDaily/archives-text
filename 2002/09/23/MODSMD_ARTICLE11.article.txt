SAN'A, Yemen (AP) — Yemen is holding 104 peo
ple suspected of belonging to the al-Qaida terror net
work or of involvement in terrorist activities, a
Yemeni lawmaker said yesterday.
Sultan al-Atwani said 15 of the suspects were de
tained in connection with the bombing in 2000 of the
USS Cole while the rest were rounded up after the
Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks..
Al-Atwani is a member of a parliament committee
looking into the situation of Yemeni terror suspects
imprisoned in thecountry or at the U.S. Guantanamo
base in Cuba.
The detainees' families accuse U.S. and Yemeni
authorities of holding the men without charges and
denying them visitors and access to their lawyers.
Al-Atwani said the parliamentary committee met
Sunday with members of Yemen's intelligence agency.
"We insisted that they either release the detainees

or put them on trial in accordance with the law," said
al-Atwani.
He said the intelligence agency is being subjected
to intense American pressure to continue the deten
tions and delay prosecutions.
Sixty-nine Yemenis are among 598 detainees from
43 countries held at the U.S. military base in Guan
tanamo Bay, Cuba. In Yemen, the government has
said it has arrested and interrogated about 100 men
suspected of being linked to al-Qaida.
Yemen, bin Laden's ancestral homeland, long has
been a fertile al-Qaida recruiting ground and has vast
tribal areas beyond government control where al-
Qaida members are believed to be hiding.
It also was.the scene of the October 2000 bombing
of the USS Cole, an American destroyer attacked
while refueling in Aden. Seventeen U.S. sailors died
in the attack.
