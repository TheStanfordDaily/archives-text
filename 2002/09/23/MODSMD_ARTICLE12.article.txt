# Israel maintains siege on Arafat

RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP)
— Israel said it had stopped de
molishing Yasser Arafat's West
Bank headquarters yesterday, but
would maintain a siege around the
building and demand the surren
der of t he people inside, rhe move
followed a day of protests against
the siege that left live Palestinians
dead.
Palestinian leaders declared a
general strike for today, appealed
to the Arab world for help and
called on their people to resist the
Israeli operation, which started
Thursday after a Palestinian sui
cide bomber blew up a Tel Aviv
bus, killing himself and six others.
In Washington, White House
spokeswoman Jeanne Mamo said

yesterday that Israel's assault was
"not helpful in reducing terrorist
violence or promoting Palestinian
reforms."
France led a European wave of
criticism against the Israeli assault,
calling it "unacceptable." A Greek
Foreign Ministry statement said
that Arafat asked Greece to work
with the United States and Europe
to end the siege, while Britain and
Russia urged Israel to end the con
finement. The U.N. Security
Council was to convene today
about (lie siege.
By the time huge Israeli mili
tary bulldozers--pulled out of the
city-block-sized compound after
nightfall Sunday, only one build
ing stood intact — Arafat's office,

where he and his aides were con
fined to four rooms.
Israelis themselves debated
the usefulness of the operation,
the third inside Arafat's com
pound this year, especially given
the persistent reports that its ac
tual goal was to compel Arafat to
leave the Palestinian territories
— a dramatic prospect that could
redefine the terms of the current
conllict.
Palestinian officials had also
warned that Israel's pulverization
of Arafat's compound endangered
the safety of the feeble 72-year-old
Palestinian leader, and after night
fall Israeli Foreign Minister Shi
mon Peres said the demolition
work had ended.
