seats in the new parliament of 601 seats, compared
with 296 for the Christian Democrats and the Free De
mocrats, according to projections by ZDE public televi
sion. Another public television station ARI) also gave
similar projections.
"The election results are favorable, so we want to
start discussions on forming a coalition govern
ment," Schroeder said as he appeared arm-in-arm
with Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer of the Green
party before cheering supporters at the Social De
mocrats' headquarters.
Stoiber stopped short of conceding in a speech to
rowdy supporters in Munich, but said that Schroed
er's government will be short-lived as its majority
would be too slim to form a lasting coalition.

movement to the right recently seen in Europe as
