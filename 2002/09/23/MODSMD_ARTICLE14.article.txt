DAVIE, Fla. (AP) â€” Three
men who were detained as ter
ror suspects on a Florida high
way might be welcomed to train
at the Miami hospital that later
turned them away after media
attention dies down, a hospital
official said yesterday.
But no agreement has been
reached to allow for the three
medical students' to return,
Larkin Hospital CEO and
president Dr. Jack Michel said
yesterday.
The students began their
clinical training on Sept. 17 at
another clinical facility,
Michel said. He declined to
name where the students were
training.
"It is possible that once the
media furor dies down and
once things are a little bit clear
er, we would potentially wel
come them back to the hospi
tal," Michel said. " They will def
initely not be at Larkin for the
time being and it's definitely not
planned in the future."
Ayman Gheith, 27, Kambiz
Butt, 25, and Omar Choud
hary, 23, were scheduled to
begin a six-week clinical train
ing course at Larkin Hospital
Sep. 16. But the hospital decid
ed not to host the students after
officials said it received hun
dreds of threatening e-mails.

" The students are not going
to have an interruption in their
medical education. I'm commit
ted to that, and I'm making sure
they can fulfill those require
ments," Michel said.
Altaf Ali, executive director
for the Florida chapter of the
Council on American-Islamic
Relations, said the students are
satisfied with the arrangement.
"They are very pleased with
the situation," Ali said. "All they
wanted, actually, was to get back
normalcy in their lives."
Gheith, Butt and Choudhary
were headed to Larkin on Sept.
13 when they were stopped in
southwest Florida. They were
detained for 18 hours as their
vehicles were searched by
bomb-sniffing dogs.
Florida authorities were
alerted after a Georgia restau
rant patron said she heard the
three men joking about the
Sept. 1 I attacks and making re
marks suggesting another at
tack was planned for Sept. 13.
The threat was a false
alarm.
Gheith, Butt and Choudhary
denied any wrongdoing and
were released after nothing was
found. But then the threaten
ing e-mails began arriving at
Larkin and the hospital decided
to turn the men away.
