## The
						Stanford Daily Daily Editor welcomes community to its newspaper 
### 
Published Since 1891

Welcome to Volume 222 of The
Stanford Daily. The Daily's mis
sion is to serve the Stanford com
munity â€” and the diverse range
of groups it represents. Our editorial staff is
going to work harder than ever this volume to
make sure that happens.
We are going to leave our offices, attend
house meetings and meet with campus leaders,
so you see us as not only names on a page, but
also laces in the community. We want you to
know diat not only do we represent you, are
you. We are a diverse group of students trying
to put out a newspaper that you want to read.
To that end, we have made a few changes in
the content of the paper, which will hopefully
generate more readership and interest in The
Daily.

Perhaps our most exciting innovation is that
we are currendy in the process of creating a
comprehensive, statistically accurate polling
system. We want to know what you think about
a number of issues from the housing draw to the
possible war in Iraq. Look in future issues of
The Daily and our Web site (www.stanforddai
ly.com) to see how you can participate in our
polls.
We also have brought back the World 8c Na
tion section. Instead of having to search for im
portant international and national news at the
bottom of page 6 or 7, you will now be able to
find all of the major U.S. and world news on
page 3 everyday.
To all of the techies, the Innovation section is
coming back as well. Look in Wednesday's Daily
every week for your science and technology

news.
For the first time in recent years, The Daily
will be publishing articles from U-Wire, a wire
service that allows us access to stories from other
college newspapers. Now, you will be able to
read major news and sports articles from uni
versities all across the world.
Lastly, Page 2 has been completely renovat
ed. We have redesigned the Calendar of Events
and have added a new Campus Watch section.
Campus Watch will run twice a week and will
contain news briefs that we could not fit in our
regular news section.
While we are trying to change our newspa
per to complement your needs, we would like
you to do your part as well.
This is your newspaper. If you have a news or
sports story idea, then let us know. If you or the

group you represent have strong opinions on a
subject, then submit a guest column. If you can
write a story, shoot a photograph, layout a page
or design a graphic, then work for us.
I want to hear from all of you. If you have any
questions or comments about The Daily, I can be
reached by phone at (650) 725-2100 ext. 501 or
by e-mail at eic@daily.stanford.edu.
Welcome to your newspaper.
