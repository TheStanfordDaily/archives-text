# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Coffee Drinkers Beware 
### SARAH CROSBY-BAKER GUEST COLUMNIST 
Anyone who's ever stayed up 24 hours
writing a paper the night before it's due
knows that coffee can be a college studen
t's best friend. Who hasn't been to the Co-
Ho fora first date at least once in their
Stanford career?
But how many times have you stopped
to ask yourself where the coffee you're
consuming comes from? How would you
feel if you knew that the coffee in your
caramel macchiato was grown by a farmer
who can't feed his family? Wouldn't your
morning coffee taste that much better if
you knew the farmer that grew it received
a fair price for his harvest?
My parents own a coffee roastery and
retail business in Santa Cruz, Calif., so
the subject of coffee is very familiar to
me. Last year I had the opportunity to
visit several coffee growing communities
in Nicaragua. Of the many memories I
have from Nicaragua, one vision haunts
me: Hundreds of coffee farmers camped
out on the side of the road, driven from
their farms by the lowest coffee prices in
100 years.
Until that day, 86 cents meant nothing
to me.
To these farmers it was everything.
The difference between receiving 40
cents per pound for their coffee and
$1.26 was the difference between lead
ing a quality life or living on the side of
the road. In some cases, it was the differ
ence between life and death.
The specialty coffee industry in the
United States is booming. Coffee is the sec
ond most heavily traded commodity in the
world after petroleum. The total value of
world coffee exports in 1990 to 1999 aver
aged over $14 billion annually.
But while industry members reap
record profits, farmers in producing
countries face market prices that are less
than their costs of production. In recent
years, green bean coffee prices have
plummeted to some of the lowest in histo
ry (in real terms).
In early 2002, coffee prices were hov
ering between 42 and 45 cents per
pound on the world market, well below
the cost of production.
When prices no longer cover the cost
of production, many coffee farmers are
forced to leave their family farms and
move to urban areas. This causes devas
tating family break-ups, weakening the
social and cultural fabric of coffee grow
ing communities.
In some countries, poor coffee prices
force farmers to replace their coffee with
illegal crops. Andres Pastrana, the presi
dent of Colombia, has frequently re
marked that the coca pickers of today were
once the coffee pickers of yesterday.
During my trip to Nicaragua, I'm glad
to say that I had the opportunity to visit
several Fair Trade Certified coffee coop
eratives. In this time of severe crisis,
these farmers had shelter, food on their
tables and, most importantly, hope fora

brighter future.
Through the added income from Fair
Trade, the farmers I met had access not
only to bare necessities, but also to social
programs, technical support and other
important resources.
Fair Trade represents small farmers'
best hope to invest in their communities
and survive the crisis with dignity. Fair
Trade is a certification that seeks to ad
dress the problems faced by small farmers
by ensuring that they earn a fair price for
their Coffee harvest.
As Phe only third-party certification or
ganization for Fair Trade products in the
U.S., TransFair USA licenses coffee com
panies to use the Fair Trade Certified label
on coffees that meet Fair Trade criteria.
TransFair then monitors each trans
action between Fair Trade producers
and licensed importers and roasters to
ensure that the farmer received the Fair
Trade floor price ($1.26 for convention
al coffees and $1.41 for organics) for
every pound of coffee that is certified.
Fair Trade is not charity; it provides a
market-based approach to increasing
small farmer self-sufficiency.
As of yet, not a single coffee venue on
Stanford's campus offers Fair Trade Cer
tified coffee. As students and conscious
consumers, we have the ability to promote
and create demand for Fair Trade Certi
fied coffee, contributing to farmers' capac
ity to improve their quality of life.
Hundreds of universities across the
U.S. have completed successful campaigns
to require that university dining services
and other coffee venues offer Fair Trade
Certified coffee.
There are several ways you can help.
Support STAN FAIR: Stanford Students
for Fair Trade. STAN FAIR is the student
organization at Stanford pressing for
adoption of Fair Trade practices and prin
ciples on campus and in the surrounding
community. Ask for Fair Trade Certified
coffee at your favorite cafes. Learn more
about Fair Trade Certification.
