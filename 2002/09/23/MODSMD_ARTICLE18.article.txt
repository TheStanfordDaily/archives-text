"Talented or effervescent" better describe
Stanford's Dollies
We here at the Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band would like to
applaud your kind words for us in Thurs
day's sports section article entitled, "Trees,
Trumpeters, and Dollies: Stanford's
Crowd Pleasers."
The piece's nameless author garnered
The Daily great praise in our hallowed
temporary halls. We felt the article to be
well-researched and well-written, for the
most part. It's nice that someone besides
us loves us like we love us.
It was the not-well-written portion that
we found disagreeable.
You see, we object in the strongest pos
sible terms to made-up, clunky adjectives
like "prostitute-ish" used to describe our
beloved Dollies. We'd prefer well-crafted
words such as "talented" or "effervescent"
or even "smoldering with the unquench
able fires of the starlit heavens."
These preferred choices have the fur
ther advantage of being accurate, while ill
conceived comparisons to ladies of the
night are not.
As one looks around the collegiate
world, there is no shortage of women in
short skirts wit h varying degrees of taste;
no lack of glitter makeup; no deficiency of
halter tops, of suggestive choreography, of
— the list goes on, a wet dream cornucopia
for adolescents real and figurative alike.
Dancers and cheerleaders will tell you
with great feeling that they are athletes
and their sport as demanding as any
other. The objectification debate rages
and will likely continue to do so; what
side you come down on is, of course, a
personal matter and not really in the
scope of this discussion.
The fact of the matter is that we believe
Stanford's Dollies — our Dollies — are
classier than any other squad out there, and

as talented as the Bolshoi Ballet to boot.
We'd further like to believe that you
agree with us. You want prostitutes, you
let the Tree know; we hear he's got a good
bulk-rate deal going up in the City.
So keep respectful tongues in your
heads and varlets, or we'll have them out
with hot pincers.

Daily "should have no part in disseminat
ing religious propaganda"
Today I was yet again put-off by the
blatant whoring of the Daily. In every
Daily distributed around campus, on
freshman move-in day nonetheless, was
an eight page advertisement for the
Church of Scientaology.
Brilliantly disguised as journalism, the
first few chapters of L. Ron Hubbard's
"Dianetics" were published and distribut
ed with the Daily's firm backing. On the
front page of the insert, the "Editors"
write" this is how the human mind works
and what [Hubbard] discovered is their
reason for our stress, unhappiness, and
negative emotions."
Whether or not Mr. Hubbard's beliefs
are true, and at the same time wanting to
respect the Church of Scientology's right to
free speech, I believe strongly that The
Stanford Daily should have no part in dis
seminating religious propaganda in the
form of paid advertisements.
It seems to me to be very unethical to
publish works such as these for two main
reasons. First, the special section published
uses the terms" Editors" without separating
the views of the Church of Scientology from
that of the editorial board of the Daily.
The section accessible to every student,
faculty, staff, and visiting parent makes a
seemingly bold statement as to the interests
and beliefs of not only the Daily, but to the

University as a whole.
Maybe I'm wrong to believe that the
Daily and the University do not have reli
gions preferences that they would like to
force upon the University population.
Second, 1 find it hard to believe that the
Daily would print the first seven chapters
of the Bible or the Koran disguised as
Daily staff written work, nor do I believe
that those works could be disguised as the
insert in Thursday's Daily.

Religious insert is "unacceptable"
I was disturbed to find a planted "sec
tion" in today's Daily, advertising for the
cult of Scientology. Nestled inside for in
coming freshmen, it was filled with "arti
cles" extolling this religion; and worse, was
unmarked as any form of advertisement.
All the articles were by " The Editors,"
implying the Daily editors, which 1 cer
tainly hope is not the case.
Certainly an insert trumpeting the the
ology of any religion is clearly unaccept
able. But while I don't want to bash any re
ligion, Scientology is a special case.
Scientology is a religion created by the
science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard, who
claimed it was so easy to fabricate the
mythology behind a religion, he went
ahead and did it. Ife inspii ingly pro
claimed: "Writing fora penny a word is
ridiculous. If a man really wants to make a
million dollars, the best way would be to
start his own religion."
The Church of Scientology is engaged in
numerous deceptive practices to extort
money from its participants. The ('.hurch has
been known to silence its opponents through
