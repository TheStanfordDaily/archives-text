# A 						year after scrutiny, grades at Harvard fall

### MARGARETTA E. HOMSEY HARVARD CRIMSON 
(U-WIRE) CAMBRIDGE,
Mass. — Alter a year in which
revelations of persistent grade in
flation dogged members of Har
vard's Faculty of Aits and Sci
ences, students' transcripts ap
pear to have taken the hardest hit.
Preliminary analysis indicates
that, on average, undergraduate
grades dropped last year to
around the level they were at
three years earlier, said Assoc.
Dean of Undergraduate Educa
tion Jeffrey Wolcowitz Thursday.
Grade inflation became a hot
issue on campus last year after (he
release of a report indicating that
undergraduate grades were high
er than ever before. According to
data released last fall, over half of
grades were As or A-minuses,
prompting vast media attention
and a nationwide debate on grade
inflation at Harvard and else
where.
While the faculty approved a
new policy last year that will place
a cap on the number of students
who may graduate with honors,
uo specific legislation was passed
compelling professors to change
their grading practices.
But Dean of the College Harry
R. Eewis said he thought the
scrutiny of grading practices
might have driven down grades
even without specific policy
changes.
"As a professor, I am not sur
prised that with all the discussion
of grading practices last year,
some faculty were more conscious
of and careful about the number
of high grades they gave," Lewis
wrote in an e-mail Thursday.
Amidst the media firestorm,
many students said they felt that
grading was harsher last year than
in previous years.
"There were people whose life
mission it was to lower my grades,"
said junior Theresa M. House,
who said she thought some gov
ernment and economics profes
sors and teaching fellows went on a
grade-deflation spree last year.
House and many others experi
enced grading quotas instituted in
courses such as Government 97a
— the concentration's sophomore
tutorial supervised by Kenan Pro
fessor of Government Harvey C.
Mansfield, who has long been
known as an opponent of grade in
flation.
Last year, a quota specifically
dictated that no more than 20 per
cent of students in a section could
receive As. In House's section of
seven students, that meant only
one A.
According to House, her in
structor "explicitly said she was
grading down the first half of the
semester to see who the 'A' was
going to be."

Another course that became in
famous last year for allegedly
cracking down on grade inflation
was the Core Curriculum course,
Science B-29, "Evolution of
I luman Nature."
The course, affectionately
known as "Sex," has long enjoyed a
favorable reputation but according
to some students became consider
ably tougher last year — a con
tention that appeared to be reflect
ed in falling CUE Guide ratings.
The year before last, the course
received an unconditional recom
mendation from 85 percent of stu
dents, and an overall rating of 4.2
out of 5.
The rating for last year
dropped to 3.7 overall, with only
65 percent offering an uncondi
tional recommendation, and 18
percent claiming that "unfair
grading policies" were a weakness
of the course, something not men
tioned in the previous CUE evalu
ation.
Students went so far as to create a
Geocities Web site entitled
"IHateß29," in which students
could post complaints about un
fair grading.
