### MARGARETTA E. HOMSEY HARVARD CRIMSON 
(U-WIRE) CAMBRIDGE,
Mass. â€” Alter a year in which
revelations of persistent grade in
flation dogged members of Har
vard's Faculty of Aits and Sci
ences, students' transcripts ap
pear to have taken the hardest hit.
Preliminary analysis indicates
that, on average, undergraduate
grades dropped last year to
around the level they were at
three years earlier, said Assoc.
Dean of Undergraduate Educa
tion Jeffrey Wolcowitz Thursday.
Grade inflation became a hot
issue on campus last year after (he
release of a report indicating that
undergraduate grades were high
er than ever before. According to
data released last fall, over half of
grades were As or A-minuses,
prompting vast media attention
and a nationwide debate on grade
inflation at Harvard and else
where.
While the faculty approved a
new policy last year that will place
a cap on the number of students
who may graduate with honors,
uo specific legislation was passed
compelling professors to change
their grading practices.
But Dean of the College Harry
R. Eewis said he thought the
scrutiny of grading practices
might have driven down grades
even without specific policy
changes.
"As a professor, I am not sur
prised that with all the discussion
of grading practices last year,
some faculty were more conscious
of and careful about the number
of high grades they gave," Lewis
wrote in an e-mail Thursday.
Amidst the media firestorm,
many students said they felt that
grading was harsher last year than
in previous years.
