# Foreign students fear visa snags under new law
## 
### CALEY MEALS BADGER HERALD (U. WISCONSIN 
(U-WIRE) MADISON, Wis. — Last Oct.
3, (Congress voted to tighten security around
the country and to restrict the issuance of
student visas. Because of the new restric
tions, many international students are being
forced to abandon or postpone their stud
ies — a phenomenon affecting colleges and
universities across the country.
University of Wisconsin-Madison has
more than 3,200 international students
from more than 100 countries, which is
nearly 8 percent of the student body. This is
the third largest number of international
students among American universities, ac
cording to the International Student Ser
vices Web site.
The international population is now

under threat by a new ac t passed by Con
gress. The act states that U.S. consulates in
26 countries will do FBI-supported back
ground checks for all male applicants ages
16-45, which could take six to eight weeks
per individual.
Some of the countries included on this list
are Afghanistan, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq and Saudi Arabia.
Students from the 26 countries on the list
will find it even more difficult to enter and
leave the United States, and in many cases,
students are not being allowed to return to
America to study.
U-Wisconsin graduate student ka
malavasan Srinivasan said he has noticed a
change over the past year.
"Last year, there were no problems, but
now it is pretty strict," Srinivasan said. "I
know a couple of friends in India whose

friends got rejected for no good reason.
They were all in good financial shape and
had all of the proper paperwork from their
universities, yet they were denied visas that
normally would not have been a problem."
Fhe current program that issues student
visas has been in place for 50 years. A recent
proposal has it slated to upgrade from paper
to elect ronic tracking by January 2003. Hie
computer database will be used to monitor
foreign students more closely.
Sheila Spear, director of International
Student Services for U-Wisconsin, said she
feels the electronic system is not the problem
— her concern is the difficulty students are
having receiving visas.
"Of all the international visitors, only two
percent of the entire visitor population are
international students," Spear said. "If the
concern is preventing terrorists from enter

ing the United States, targeting student
visas should be a minor concern because a
student visa is one of the most complicated
ways of entering (he country."
Fire a Firca, a U-Wisconsin senior 112 rom
Indonesia, said he is concerned about re
turning home now that the security is so
tight but feels it is understandable for Amer
icans to be worried.
"Because of the terrorist attacks, I think it is
acceptable for the U.S. to do this," Firca said.
Not all students are so understanding,
though. U-Wisconsin alumnus Houssain
Kettani, a Moroccan citizen, disagrees with
the new restrictions.
"We are supposed to be guests in the
country, and this does not follow the expect
ed rules of hospitality," Kettani said. "The at
tacks do not justify targeting innocent stu
dents."
