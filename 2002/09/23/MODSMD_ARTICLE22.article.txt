### EMMA SCHWARTZ MICHAEL ROSEN-MOLINA DAILY CALIFORNIAN (UC-BERKELEY 
(U-WIRE) BERKELEY, Calif. — U.S.
academics and institutions are being mon
itored for anti-Israeli bias by a Philadel
phia-based think tank's Web site launched
Wednesday.
Campus Watch cites Stanford and UC-
Berkeley as two campuses among 14 tar
geted for espousing anti-Israeli sentiment.
The site also implicates San Francisco
State University.
The site's organizers will monitor more
than 250 universities nationwide, but will
focus on UC-Berkeley and other key insti
tutions, which have been in the media
spotlight because of campus activity relat

ed to the Middle East.
UC-Berkeley officials declined to
comment on the university's inclusion
on the list.
Campus Watch also lists Snehal Shin
gavi, a UC-Berkeley graduate student in
the English department - along with
seven other professors from universities
across the country - as individuals who
contribute to American academic bias
against Israel.
Shingavi, who is teaching a class on
"Palestine and the Poetics of Resistance,"
said the Web site was "sinister" and would
discourage the free How of ideas, especial
ly in academics.
"(Campus Watch) creates a climate in
which people are afraid to say what they
think and teach what they are teaching,"

Shingavi said. "It was designed to chill aca
demic speech. It carries with it an implicit
threat that not only are you being moni
tored but that there are some kind of im
plicit consequences."
The Campus Watch Web site,
www.campus-watch.org, said the organi
zation was started by American scholars to
identify and "reverse the damage already
caused by the activist / scholars on Ameri
can campuses" for their "misconceptions"
about the Middle East.
"The idea here is to create a clearing
house for information so if you're a stu
dent on a campus, it's fairly easy to find
that information," said Martin Kramer, an
author whose book inspired the Web site.
Some students at UC-Berkeley said the or
ganization serves an important role in ad

dressing "biases" on campus.
"With the volatile situation in the Mid
dle East, there needs to be a sense of ob
jectivity," said UC-Berkeley senior Oren
Lazar, an Israel Action Committee mem
ber who reported information to Campus
Watch. "I hope to educate the community
that it is being presented (with) bias."
Bui Shingavi said the Web site does not
consider more relevant factors like his
class's progress or student reception to his
teaching.
"(Campus Watch) doesn't pretend to be
a debate or conversation," Shingavi said. "It
just says these professors are a problem."
Some UC-Berkeley professors said moni
toring academics was a source of concern
and could hinder freedom of expression.
"If they produce blacklists of individu

als, then this is a very dangerous devel
opment that will affect people outside the
circles of Middle East [scholars] eventual
ly," said History Prof. Beshara Doumani.
"It is designed to harass and intimidate
free speech, and it should be a concern to
anyone who values academic freedom."
But Kramer said while academic free
dom is important, it should not extend to
professors who enter into the public sphere.
"When scholars publish in newspa
pers or attend rallies or advise govern
ments - all that is out in the public do
main," Kramer said. "We should be sub
jecting academics to the same criticism as
public officials."
The Web site includes biographies of
professors and links to articles about them
and the targeted universities.
