Sunday: Stanford 4, Florida 0

Following a 4-0 win over Okla
homa on Friday night and after
emerging victorious 4-0 over No.
16 Florida on Sunday afternoon,
the Cardinal made a powerful
statement to be considered fora
promotion.
As Oklahoma head coach
Randy Evans said following Fri
day night's game, "I don't think
they're overrated."
Indeed, Stanford lived up to all
expectations over the weekend,
posting consecutive shutouts, its
fourth and fifth of the season, and
running its perfect record to 6-0-0.
The Cardinal showed off its depth
as well, as eight players marked
points during weekend play.
Friday night found the Cardi
nal taking on the Sooners for the
first time in the program's history.
Under a full moon and in front of
a full set of bleachers, the squad
got off to a fast start as senior mid
fielder Becky Myers had a good
scoring chance off of a left cross in
the 6th minute.
Perhaps the best early chance
came just four minutes later as se
nior forward Kelsey Carlson rock
eted a shot from just outside the
box that was barely nudged over
the crossbar by the Oklahoma
keeper.
Fhe Stanford attack kept con
stant pressure on the Sooner de
fense, peppering the keeper for
the duration of the night. Consis
tent challenging of defensive back
passes and excellent crossing pass
es from the wings enabled Stan
ford to keep possession of the ball
on the offensive end for much of
the first half.
In the 23rd minute a smooth
give-and-go between junior for
ward Marcie Ward and Carlson
resulted in another open scoring
chance, but it wasn't until the 36th
minute that the Cardinal found
the back of the net.
After a hard shot from junior
midfielder Allyson Marquand that
the keeper couldn't handle, senior
forward Marcia Wallis took care of
the rebound, putting Stanford on
the board.
"The ball came back out to the
top of the box and Ally hit a great
shot low. It came off the keeper's
hands," Wallis said. "Earlier in the
game 1 had lofted one over so I
was trying to concentrate on keep
ing the shot low and placing it
around her."
A mere six minutes later Stan
ford was up by two goals as Wallis
again found the back of the net,
this time after a spectacular cross
from Ward. Ward chased down
the ball on the end line and after
faking out a defender found Wal
lis with a short crossing pass that
she blasted past the keeper from

close range.
"Marcie swiped around their
defender, kicked it back to the
near post and then my shot came
off a defender and went in by the
near post," Wallis said. "She got an
awesome cross off. It was all effort
— it was pretty much her goal
working that hard to get the cross
off."
Ward notched a goal of her
own just four minutes into the sec
ond half as she took the hall unas
sisted, beat her defender and let
loose a low shot that beat the keep
er from 25 yards out. The scoring
ended with freshman forward Na
talie Sanderson's goal off of fresh
man Lirfdsey Hunt's cross from
the right wing.
Sunday was billed as the more
competitive matchup for the Car
dinal this weekend when it took on
No. 16 Florida.
As Stanford coach Paul Saps
ford said Friday night in anticipa
tion: "It's going to be a good game.
I know the girls are confident, and
I'm confident that it's going to be
an exciting game."
The players showed the confi
dence was warranted with an of
fensive attack t hat notched its first
goal in the 3rd minute. Carlson
took advantage of a miscue in the
Florida defense and threaded a
smooth through pass to Ward who
beat the keeper with a shot to her
left.
The Cardinal was slowed ini
tially by Florida's defensive offside
trap but was able to break it with
balls through the middle of the
field and clears from the backline
and ip id field.
"We knew from the scouting re
port and from watching a few min
utes of the Santa Clara game on
Friday night that their defensive
line would run the offside trap,"
said Ward. "And they only have
about 25 yards between the for
wards and their defensive backs,
so we knew that either dribbling
through or balls over the top were
going to get them."
The strategy paid off as the
team tallied another goal in the
17th minute when Wallis scored
on a header off Ward's corner.
The team scored once again
before halftime on senior mid
fielder Callie Withers unassisted
goal from the top of the box.
Withers took the ball then spun
to her right past two defenders
before cranking a hard shot into
the left side netting.
The final goal was added in the
73rd minute by Marquand when
she took a pass from freshman
midfielder Leah Tapscott and
scored from 20 yards out.
Just as important for the Car
dinal was its excellent play along
I he backline. Good clearing and
overall defensive speed prevent
ed the Gators from even register
ing a shot until the 56th minute
of the match.
Stifling defense, solid keeping
and an offensive attack, coming
from strikers, midfielders and
even defensive backs creeping up
the sides combined to give the

in the Cardinal's 4-0 victory.
Cardinal two solid wins this
weekend.
Sapsford described the week
end as simply, "quality."
"I'm really pleased with the
team's performance. They work so
hard that they deserve success. I'm
just pleased for the players; they've
showed excellent character."
The Cardinal takes the field
again next weekend, when it will
face Tennessee and Montana at
the Santa Clara Tournament.
