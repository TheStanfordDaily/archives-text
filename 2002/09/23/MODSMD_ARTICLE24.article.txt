Saturday: Stanford 3, Pepperdine 0

The No. 4 Cardinal (10-1, 1-0 Pacific-10
Conference) opened its conference schedule
by handing the Golden Bears (9-1, 0-1) their
first loss of the season in front of 2,052 at
Maples Pavilion on Friday night. Stanford fol
lowed up its 3-0 win over Cal with a sweep of
No. 14 Pepperdine (7-5) on Saturday.
Failing in its bid to start 10-0 for the first
time in program history, Cal gave Stanford a
run for its money in the first two games, mak
ing it look like the Cardinal's 20-year winning
streak over the Bears could be in jeopardy.
Despite the return of senior outside hitter
Logan Tom to the lineup after a three-week
stint with the U.S. national team at the World
Championships in Germany, Stanford didn't
look to be in control of the match until midway
through the third game.
"For (his time of the year, I thought this was
a good match," Stanford coach John Dunning
said. "We played better as the night went, but
they played great in game one. 1 hat was a good
intense game. 1 his is the best California team
they've had in years."
Tom picked up a match-high 15 kills while
hitting .406 in her first match with the Cardinal
since the season-opening NACWAA / State
Farm Classic in late August.
"It's getting easier [to make the transition
from international play to college play] every
year," Tom said. "There's still an adjustment

period, but I already feel a lot better with every
thing. It hasn't hit me that this is my last year.
I'm just so used to leaving and coming back
here."
But even with the big performance from
Tom, the Cardinal could not shake the Bears
in the first two games. A large Cal student sec
tion and the absence of the Stanford Band did
not help matters.
The Bears overcame a 20-15 deficit in the
first game to pull to within one, with Stanford
hanging on '29-28, but a service error by Cal
outside hitter Jenna Brown — one of many ill
timed service errors by the Bears during the
match — gave the Cardinal a 30-28 win.
Despite an early six-point run in the second
game, Stanford still couldn't get the Bears to
back off, as Cal was still within a point of the
Cardinal at 21-20.
But back-to-back kills by senior outside hit
ter Ashley Ivy sparked a Cardinal rally that last
ed the rest of the match.
Stanford picked up only two hitting errors
in closing out the second game 30-26 and run
ning away with the third 30-18. The Cardinal
hit at over .400 in each of the last two games.
"We served tough, we passed well and that
gave [junior setter Anna Robinson] a lot of
weapons to choose from," Dunning said. "We
only had five errors in the last two games,
which is something that's really hard to do if
you don't have the defense."
Stanford shut down Cal's go-to player,
sophomore outside hitter Mia Jerkov, holding
the Croatian national to only 13 kills with nine
errors fora season-low. 103 hitting percentage.
The Bears hit a season-low .181 as a team in the
match.
That marked success for Stanford's new
look in the back row, where freshman Court
ney Schultz made her first career start at libero,
allowing the usual libero, sophomore Jenn

Hucke, to move to a serving defensive spec ial
ist position.
Hucke and sophomore outside hitter
Ogonna Nnamani showed off their newly pol
ished jump serves, giving the Cardinal four
jump-servers in its rotation. Stanford only (al
lied four service aces in the match, but its
strong serving stalled the Bears' offense
throughout the night.
"Jenn's jump serve has gotten to the point
where she's just crushing it," Dunning said.
"[Ashley], Logan and Jenn all have different
jump serves. We're bring Ogonna's along
slowly, but we could have solid four jump
serves by the end of the year."
Stanford had a lot less trouble with Pepper
dine the next night, handing the Waves their
fourth loss to a ranked team in what's been a
tough season for the group from Malibu.
The game scores of 30-26, 30-27 and 30-
28 suggest a competitive match, but all of the
other numbers paint a completely different
story.
The Cardinal shut down Pepperdine's Ail-
American outside hitter Katie Wilkins, holding
her to just 11 kills and a .139 hitting percent
age. While five Stanford starters hit over .300
in the match, only the Waves' starting setter
Paola Rodriguez could claim the same.
Pepperdine look overwhelmed by the
Stanford blockers at times as the Waves got
dominated at the net, falling to a 15.5 to 7
deficit in blocking. Junior middle blocker
Jenn Harvey picked up a match-high seven
bloc ks to lead the Cardinal.
"It's important to shut down the one that
the other team leans on the most," said Robin
son, who picked up 43 assists in guiding Stan
ford to outhit the Waves .344-. 197. "It really
lowers their morale. We had a long pregame

talk about who we needed to shut
down, and we did a great job of
going out there and doing it."
Tom had another huge night,
recording 21 kills along with six
blocks. Nnamani, who was getting a
lot more attention from opposing
teams during Tom's absence, rel
ished the extra space being given to
her, rattling off 15 kills while hitting
at a .480 clip.
Outside hitter Brie Harris
picked up several kills during a late
third-game rally to lead the Waves
with 13 kills on the night.
"We wanted to come in and play
hard and play relaxed," said Pepper
dine coach Nina Matthies. "We were
right there with them most of the
way, and if a couple of balls had gone
our way, the outcome could've been
very different. The reason you
schedule Stanford is that you want to
play the best, and I'm pretty happy
with where we are."

The game scores of 30-26, 30-27 and 30-
28 suggest a competitive match, but all of the
other numbers paint a completely different
story.
The Cardinal shut down Pepperdine's Ail-
American outside hitter Katie Wilkins, holding
her to just 11 kills and a .139 hitting percent
age. While five Stanford starters hit over .300
in the match, only the Waves' starting setter
Paola Rodriguez could claim the same.

"It's important to shut down the one that
the other team leans on the most," said Robin

ford to outhit the Waves .344-. 197. "It really

going out there and doing it."
Tom had another huge night,
recording 21 kills along with six
blocks. Nnamani, who was getting a
lot more attention from opposing
teams during Tom's absence, rel
ished the extra space being given to
her, rattling off 15 kills while hitting
at a .480 clip.
Outside hitter Brie Harris
picked up several kills during a late
third-game rally to lead the Waves
with 13 kills on the night.
"We wanted to come in and play
hard and play relaxed," said Pepper
dine coach Nina Matthies. "We were
right there with them most of the
way, and if a couple of balls had gone
our way, the outcome could've been
very different. The reason you
schedule Stanford is that you want to
play the best, and I'm pretty happy
with where we are."
It was about time someone knocked the Cal

horse, and Stanford was damn glad to be the
team to do it.

Saturday: Stanford 3, Pepperdine 0

The No. 4 Cardinal (10-1, 1-0 Pacific-10
Conference) opened its conference schedule
by handing the Golden Bears (9-1, 0-1) their
first loss of the season in front of 2,052 at
Maples Pavilion on Friday night. Stanford fol
lowed up its 3-0 win over Cal with a sweep of
No. 14 Pepperdine (7-5) on Saturday.
Failing in its bid to start 10-0 for the first
time in program history, Cal gave Stanford a
run for its money in the first two games, mak
ing it look like the Cardinal's 20-year winning
streak over the Bears could be in jeopardy.
Despite the return of senior outside hitter
Logan Tom to the lineup after a three-week
stint with the U.S. national team at the World
Championships in Germany, Stanford didn't
look to be in control of the match until midway
through the third game.
"For (his time of the year, I thought this was
a good match," Stanford coach John Dunning
said. "We played better as the night went, but
they played great in game one. 1 hat was a good
intense game. 1 his is the best California team
they've had in years."
Tom picked up a match-high 15 kills while
hitting .406 in her first match with the Cardinal
since the season-opening NACWAA / State
Farm Classic in late August.
"It's getting easier [to make the transition
from international play to college play] every
year," Tom said. "There's still an adjustment

period, but I already feel a lot better with every
thing. It hasn't hit me that this is my last year.
I'm just so used to leaving and coming back
here."
But even with the big performance from
Tom, the Cardinal could not shake the Bears
in the first two games. A large Cal student sec
tion and the absence of the Stanford Band did
not help matters.
The Bears overcame a 20-15 deficit in the
first game to pull to within one, with Stanford
hanging on '29-28, but a service error by Cal
outside hitter Jenna Brown — one of many ill
timed service errors by the Bears during the
match — gave the Cardinal a 30-28 win.
Despite an early six-point run in the second
game, Stanford still couldn't get the Bears to
back off, as Cal was still within a point of the
Cardinal at 21-20.
But back-to-back kills by senior outside hit
ter Ashley Ivy sparked a Cardinal rally that last
ed the rest of the match.
Stanford picked up only two hitting errors
in closing out the second game 30-26 and run
ning away with the third 30-18. The Cardinal
hit at over .400 in each of the last two games.
"We served tough, we passed well and that
gave [junior setter Anna Robinson] a lot of
weapons to choose from," Dunning said. "We
only had five errors in the last two games,
which is something that's really hard to do if
you don't have the defense."
Stanford shut down Cal's go-to player,
sophomore outside hitter Mia Jerkov, holding
the Croatian national to only 13 kills with nine
errors fora season-low. 103 hitting percentage.
The Bears hit a season-low .181 as a team in the
match.
That marked success for Stanford's new
look in the back row, where freshman Court
ney Schultz made her first career start at libero,
allowing the usual libero, sophomore Jenn

Hucke, to move to a serving defensive spec ial
ist position.

Ogonna Nnamani showed off their newly pol
ished jump serves, giving the Cardinal four
jump-servers in its rotation. Stanford only (al
lied four service aces in the match, but its
strong serving stalled the Bears' offense
throughout the night.
"Jenn's jump serve has gotten to the point
where she's just crushing it," Dunning said.
"[Ashley], Logan and Jenn all have different
jump serves. We're bring Ogonna's along
slowly, but we could have solid four jump
serves by the end of the year."
Stanford had a lot less trouble with Pepper
dine the next night, handing the Waves their
fourth loss to a ranked team in what's been a
tough season for the group from Malibu.
