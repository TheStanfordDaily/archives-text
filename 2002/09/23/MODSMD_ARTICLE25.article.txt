Sunday: Stanford 0, lowa 1

The team lost a heartbreaker at home yes
terday, losing 1-0 to No. 8 lowa in the first pe
riod of sudden-death overtime. With 5 min
utes, 40 seconds left, lowa forward Lindsay

Miller broke free on the left side, and after a
spectacular save by Stanford keeper Emily Zan
der, Miller put in the rebound, clinching the
game for lowa.
The game was a tight one; both teams had
numerous scoring opportunities during regu
lation and overtime. Zander made several im
portant saves, including four in overtime. Four
minutes into overtime on a breakway, Zander
went into a full sprawl to stuff lowa forward
Sarah Dawson and send her Hying to the turf.
Even with the loss, the Stanford players were
remarkably upbeat at the finish and proud of
the dibit by both teams.
"We're all really happy with the game," said
senior forward Noor Da wood. "It was one of

Stanford held a great deal of the action (lut

in every period. An inability to capitalize on
scoring opportunities has been a problem for
the Cardinal this year.

"Of course one of the big problems is finish

only two sophomores on the team. "It's been
frustrating for us, especially coming so close to
winning many of these games and not having
the final score reflect the actual course of the
game. Despite this, our confidence in our abili
ty hasn't faltered, and we know we can turn
things around."
In yesterday's game the Cardinal held a 5-2
advantage in shots after the first half, but fin
ished the game at a 15-8 disadvantage. Just like
a classic pitcher's duel in baseball, it's safe to say
that stellar play from both Stanford keepers.
Zander and freshman Ana Kralovec, kept Stan
ford in the game.
Saturday however was a different story for
Stanford. In its first Northern Pacific Athletic
Conference game of the year, Stanford took
down Pacific, 2-1.
With the win, Stanford extended its season
opening game winning streak to six, dating
