Sunday: Stanford 0, lowa 1

The team lost a heartbreaker at home yes
terday, losing 1-0 to No. 8 lowa in the first pe
riod of sudden-death overtime. With 5 min
utes, 40 seconds left, lowa forward Lindsay

Miller broke free on the left side, and after a
spectacular save by Stanford keeper Emily Zan
der, Miller put in the rebound, clinching the
game for lowa.
The game was a tight one; both teams had
numerous scoring opportunities during regu
lation and overtime. Zander made several im
portant saves, including four in overtime. Four
minutes into overtime on a breakway, Zander
went into a full sprawl to stuff lowa forward
Sarah Dawson and send her Hying to the turf.
Even with the loss, the Stanford players were
remarkably upbeat at the finish and proud of
the dibit by both teams.
"We're all really happy with the game," said
senior forward Noor Da wood. "It was one of
our best games all season in terms of our play.
We're all disappointed with the loss, but not
with how we played."
Stanford held a great deal of the action (lut
ing the game, with quite a few chances to score
in every period. An inability to capitalize on
scoring opportunities has been a problem for
the Cardinal this year.

"Of course one of the big problems is finish
ing," said midfielder Eleanor Morgan, one of
only two sophomores on the team. "It's been
frustrating for us, especially coming so close to
winning many of these games and not having
the final score reflect the actual course of the
game. Despite this, our confidence in our abili
ty hasn't faltered, and we know we can turn
things around."
In yesterday's game the Cardinal held a 5-2
advantage in shots after the first half, but fin
ished the game at a 15-8 disadvantage. Just like
a classic pitcher's duel in baseball, it's safe to say
that stellar play from both Stanford keepers.
Zander and freshman Ana Kralovec, kept Stan
ford in the game.
Saturday however was a different story for
Stanford. In its first Northern Pacific Athletic
Conference game of the year, Stanford took
down Pacific, 2-1.
With the win, Stanford extended its season
opening game winning streak to six, dating
buck to 1997, and has won 11 of its
past 13 games against NorPac op
ponents.
Scoring for the Cardinal w;is se
nior defender Amrit Chima, who
converted a penalty stroke early in
the second half. Just four minutes
later, senior midfielder Christina
Williams scored an unassisted goal
to give the Cardinal necessaiy insur
ance as Pacific's Alexandra Fiorina
scored an unassisted goal with seven
seconds left to end the game at 2-1.
Stanford, losers in six of their
previous eight contests, returned
to the Farm after a tough road trip
to New York where they faced still
competition including Syracuse
and Cornell, losing 3-0 and 4-1,
respectively.
The important wins though are
the conference victories, so the
team is very excited to come away
from this weekend with at least a 1-
0 record in the NorPac.
