# Dream of a week turns into sports nightmare
## 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN STAFF COLUMNIST 
Last night I had the worst
dream. You could even
call it a nightmare. In my
dream I went through an entire
week, and it was awful.
In the beginning of the
dream, I was walking on my way
to lunch (a late lunch, of course,

since it was Sat
urday), when I
heard that Cal
ifornia had de
stroyed Michi
gan State. Cal
actually looked
like it has a real
football team!
That in itself
was horrible.

The idea of Cal finishing with a
winning record makes me want
to cry, and the team is already
halfway there.
In my dream, Sunday was ab
solutely horrendous. There
were great football games on all
day. Six games were decided by
less than eight points, and St.
Louis lost to start the season 0-2.
What a great day — that is, if I
could watch!
Nooo! The worst possible in
fliction fora sports fan: missing
a great day of sports. Living out
of suitcases in Toyon Hall for
Sophomore College, I didn't
have anywhere to watch the
games.
The last time this happened
to me was in 2000. My beloved
Los Angeles Lakers were en
route to their first NBA title of
the 19905. As the Lakers
crushed the Pacers, I was on a
family vacation, unable to
watch. I will never forget the
pain of missing that beautiful
celebration (that is, apart from
the riot and burning of cars af
terwards).
In my dream, I sadly fell
asleep Sunday night (sleeping in
a dream, that's weird) without
watching a single highlight from
an NFL game.
But at least there was great

baseball, right? My Dodgers
were going up against the Gi
ants in a four-game series that
would decide the wild card
race. I knew the kids would
shine: Shawn Green would
launch bombs, Dave Roberts
would make spectacular catch
es and Hideo Nomo would
pitch beautifully.
But I was having a night
mare, so none of these things
happened. The Dodgers split
the series with the Giants and
lost to San Diego on Friday.
With six games to play, the
Dodgers are two games behind
the red-hot G-men in the wild
card race.
Arghhhhhh! The only thing
worse than losing is losing to the
Giants. Especially this year,
when the Giants celebrated the
"Shot Heard Round the World"
at a game against the Dodgers
(for those of you that don't
know, the "shot" — when Bobby
Thompson hit a moon-shot in
the bottom of the ninth to win
the 1952 pennant — was one of
the worst moments in Dodger
history
In my dream, the Dodgers
were playing disgustingly and
acting like they didn't care about
their season. Crazy dreams.
In my dream, the Lakers
made a "brilliant" off-season ac
quisition. Since winning their
third NBA Championship, the
Lakers have been searching for
a big body to help ease Shaq's
load. On Wednesday, the Lak
ers signed Guy Rucker, a 6-foot
-9 forward-center from lowa.
Rucker averaged a whopping
15 points and six rebounds play
ing in the Hungarian A-division.
I can only assume that the cen
ters in Hungary put the NBA
players to shame and that he is
going to shock the world. He
must have dominated in the Big
10, right?
At lowa, he averaged eight
points and four rebounds. Now
lie is a Laker. At least practice


Jacob Saperstein
will be fun to watch as Shacj goes
up against "Big Ruck."
While the Lakers picked up
the league's moldy leftovers, their
rivals revamped their lineups.
The Kings added Keon Clark,
who will give them an athletic
presence inside the paint. The
Nets added Dikembe Mutombo
to battle against "The Big Aristo
tle." The Mavericks and Spurs are
a year older, giving their young
players more battle experience.
And even the Clippers are look
ing like competitors with the ad
dition of Andre Miller.
And the Lakers? They added
a so-so European player who
could barely compete at lowa.

Thank God this only happened
in my dream.
To end the dream there was an
other day of football games, this
time collegiate. Yet again, it came
and went, and I was unable to
watch. Moving in has taken up all of
my time, and my television was fi
nally set up to watch infomercials.
And to top il off, a Saturday
without a Stanford game. It was
absolutely terrible.
1 woke up this morning clammy
and upset. What an aggravating
nightmare. My only solace is that
at least this week can't be any
where near as bad as my dream.
