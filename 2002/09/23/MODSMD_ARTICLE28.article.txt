# Card idle in wild week for Pac-10
## California continues surprising start, UCLA falls to Colorado 
### MATT LONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
I'hough Stanford (1-1) and Ari
zona State (3-1), who will meet next
Saturday in Tempe, Ariz., each had
the weekend off, the rest of the Pa
cific-10 Conference saw action,
with four teams suffering their first
losses of the young season, leaving
No. 9 Oregon (4-0) and No. 23
Oregon State (4-0) as the lone con
ference unbeatens.
Perhaps the biggest upset was
Colorado's 33-17 defeat of No. 22
UCLA (2-1) on a stifling Rose Bowl
afternoon. The Buffaloes (1-2), a
preseason top-10 squad, grabbed
their 112 irst win of the season, exact
ing revenge on the Bruins from
their 40-3 loss last weekend to
Southern California. The loss
dropped UCLA out of the top 25
and served as a small bit of re
demption fora Colorado team that
carried huge expectations into the
season.
"At least this week, I'm not going
to go home and kick my dog," Col
orado coach Gary Barnett said. "I
can't compare USC and UClj\ be
cause last week our team didn't

show up. VVe got insulted last week,
both on and off the field. Our guys
challenged each other. That was
the Colorado Buffalo team I'm
used to seeing and being around."
No. 11 USC (2-1) showed but a
shadow of the explosiveness it had
against Colorado in a 27-20 loss at
No. 15 Kansas State (4-0). I'he
Wildcats held a 27-6 lead in the
fourth quarter, but the Trojans ral
lied back when quarterback Carson
Palmer finally led a scoring drive,
capped by a nine-yard touchdown
to Keary Colbert with just over 10
minutes remaining. Sultan McCul
lough cut the lead to 27-20 a few
minutes later with a 25-yard touch
down scamper, but that was as close
as t he Trojans would come.
The Kansas State defense held
Palmer, who was averaging 273
yards in the air coming into the
contest, to 186 yards on 18 for 47
passing. Palmer took the Trojans to
the Wildcat 33 on the games final
drive, but his fourth and 15 pass
flew over Colbert's head.
"We had a chance to win this
game," said Palmer, who passed
Rob Johnson for the Trojans' ca
reer yardage record with 8,608.
"We showed we had some fight,
and the defense never gave up. But
it just took us too long to get going."
The loss dropped USC seven
spots to No. 18 in yesterday's AP
poll.

Cinderella story California (3-1)
dropped its first game in an excit
ing 23-21 loss to Air Force (3-0) at
Berkeley. The Bears, last year's
conference d(X)rmat with a 1-10
record, was picked to finish last
again in the Pac-10. But Cal and
new head coach Jeff Ted ford had
proved the pundits wrong thus far,
winning their first three games and
showing complete offensive domi
nance, especially in last week's 46-
22 victory over touted Michigan
State.
The Bears haven't enjoyed a
winning season since 1993, and the
Cal fans packed Strawberry
Canyon Saturday, filling a large
part of Memorial Stadium with
rowdy optimism at the Bear's
chances behind senior quarterback
Kyle Boiler. But the Bears offense,
averaging 50 points per game en
tering the contest, was unable to
manufacture touchdowns as in past
weeks, largely because of several
key dropped passes.
"(Drops) plagued us significant
ly," Ted ford said. "I have confi
dence in our guys that it won't hap
pen again. There's no need to
panic. I thought our defense
played well, but you're never going
to stop that offense."
"That offense" referred mainly
to one man: Air Force's speedy op
tion quarterback Chance Har
ridge. Harridge rushed for 124

yards and three touchdowns, in
cluding a 13-yard run with 1:59 to
play, pulling away from the Bears,
23-15.
Boiler provided Cal with one
last chance to tie the game with
his 17-yard scoring pass to
Jonathan Makonnen with 31 sec
onds left, the Bear's first touch
down of the battle. But his 2-
point conversion pass attempt to
tailback Joe Igber was tipped
away, as the Falcons celebrated
their seventh 3-0 start under
coach Fisher Deberry
"I'll probably have a night
mare about it over and over,"
Boiler said. "Where I was stand
ing, I could just see the guy's
hand coming in to knock it out. It
was a split-second thing. An in
stant earlier or later, and we're in
overtime."
Arizona (2-1) was the last squad
to suffer its first loss, a 31-10 shel
lacking against No. 17 Wisconsin.
No. 13 Washington (2-1), No. 1(5
Washington State (3-1), Oregon
and Oregon State all rolled to huge
wins over mid-major opponents
Wyoming, Montana State, Portland
Suite and Freno State, respectively.
The conference season opens
this week with three games. Stan
ford has won its last three against
the Sun Devils, USC will face Ore
gon State at home, and Washing
ton State will play at Cal.

Senior receiver Ryan Wells avoids a San Jose State defender during last
week's 63-26 victory. Stanford, who was idle this week, will face Arizona
State next week in Tempe, Ariz.
