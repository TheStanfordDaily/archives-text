### 
EAST lAN SING, Mich. (AP) —
Tyrone Willingham and Joe Kear
ney didn't have a lot of time to catch
up after Notre Dame's thrilling 21-
17 win at Michigan State.
The Notre Dame coach and the
Fiesta Bowl scout just hugged and
chatted briefly Saturday just out
side Spartan Stadium.
But if the Fighting Irish (4-0)
can turn their surprising start into
a shocking finish and wind up
playing for the Bowl Champi
onship Series national champi
onship game in the Fiesta Bowl,
Willingham and Kearney can
reminisce about their days at
Michigan State.
Willingham played football and
baseball and later was an assistant
coach for the Spartans, while Kear
ney was Michigan State's athletic di
rector in the late 19705.
The Fighting Irish moved up

(wo spots to No. 10 in 1 he Associ
ated Press poll Sunday following
ihe win. Just when the golden lus
ter doesn't seem like it could shine
any brighter at Notre Dame, Will
ingham is not satisfied.
"I hope it does get better be
cause this is not the end of the sea
son, is it?" Willingham said.
Willingham was then asked if it
would be great to end the season
giving Kearney another hug in
Tempe, Ariz.
"Well, that would be a great
place to go, but that's a little pre
mature to start thinking along
those lines," Willingham said.
"We've got some awfully good
football teams to play."
Alter a bye week, Notre Dame
will continue it's magical season at
home against Stanford, where
Willingham coached the previous
seven seasons.
1 he Spartans (2-2) will begin
conference play next week hoping
to prove there's more to them than
preseason hype. I hey started the
season ranked 18th and rose to
15th before plummeting out of the
poll with a 24-point loss to Califor
nia last week.
"We just have to regroup and
realize we are stalling the Big Ten
season, which is a new season,"
said quarterback Jell Smoker, who
was 19-of-34 for 281 yards with
two touchdowns and two intercep
tions. "As long as I'm behind the
center, I'm not going to let these
guys pack it in."
Notre Dame certainly didn't
give up after a 14-3 lead early in
the fourth quarter turned into a
17-14 deficit with 1:45 left.
Thirty seconds later, quarter
back Pat Dillingham, playing for
injured starter Carlyle Holiday,
threw a short pass to Arnaz Battle,
who ran 60 yards for the game
winning score.
"If you were watching that and
didn't like it, give up life," Willing
ham joked.
Notre Dame (4-0) is oil to its
best start since 1993, the last time it
seriously challenged for the na
tional championship.
"I'm still not surprised," W'ill
ingham said.
And Notre Dame's first-year
coach is not satisfied, either.
"It's a great start, but it's about
what you do next," he said. "If

you're 4-0, then start stumbling
around, what have you accom
plished?"
Rogers, who caught seven pass
es lor 175 yards, accomplished
something, but the sensational re
ceiver would rather have won.
He tied an NGAA record by
catching a touchdown pass in his
12th straight regular-season game.
The mark is shared by Marshall's
Randy Moss, Michigan's Desmond
1 toward and Pacific's Aaron Turn
er. Including last year's Silicon Val
ley Bowl, Rogers has caught Tl)
passes in 13 consecutive games,
tying the Big Ten mark set by
Howard. NCAA records do not
count postseason games.
Rogers' first Tl) catch from
Smoker, from 38 yards out early in
the fourth quarter, got Michigan
State to 14-10. The Spartans went
ahead on Rogers' second TD
when he leaped in the back of the
end zone — with two defenders on
him — and got his left foot down
fora spectacular 21-yard score
with 1:45 to go.
"We're 2-2, but we're a much
better team than that," Rogers
said. "Now it's time to focus on our
second season. We open Big Ten
play with a clean slate."
Holiday left with a left shoulder
injury late in the third quarter and
watched the rest of the game from
the sideline, with his arm and
shoulder secured by a brace and a
bandage.
"I know fora fact, in two weeks,
I'll be ready to play," I loliday said.
Willingham said at a news con
ference Sunday that Holiday will
be evaluated week-to-week but
he hopes he will be ready for
Stanford.
