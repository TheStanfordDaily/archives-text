# Gators rebound with big win over Tennessee
## 
### 
KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Florida re
asserted its dominance against a key SEC
rival, and coach Ron Zook reassured the
Gators' anxious fans.
A 30-13 win Saturday over the Volunteers
put the Gators (3-1, 1-0) back where they so
often were under Steve Spurrier — in con
tention for the SEC championship and with a
shot at the national title.
"Obviously, il was a big win for us and it
gives us an opportunity to get going, get a lit
tle confidence," Zook said yesterday. "We re
alize there's a long way to go, and there's a lot
of football to be played."
The Gators moved up three spots to No. 7
in the AP rankings, while Tennessee fell
seven spots to No. 1 1.
Zook gave the game ball to athletic direc
tor Jeremy Foley, who hired his close friend
away from the NFL to succeed Spurrier.
"Although there was no pressure on me or
anything like that, (the win) was big to him as
well," Zook said of Foley. "He's feeling the

same thing that a lot of other people are feel
ing."
Zook says the Gators are improving, and
the offense proved him right Saturday. De
spite the rain and getting sacked four times,
Rex Grossman completed 20 of 34 passes for
324 yards and three touchdowns.
"It's beginning to click now," Zook said.
The Gators took control of the game by
scoring 24 unanswered points in the last 4:55
of the first half, amid a downpour. The hard
er it rained, the worse Tennessee played, and
Florida took advantage every time.
During the span, the Vols fumbled four
straight times. Tennessee coach Phillip Ful
mer was so disgusted he apologized to Vols
fans, many of whom left at halftime.
For Tennessee, it was like a flashback to
the futile games in the mid-19905, when
Florida won five straight and the Volunteers'
chances of winning the SEC East were
doomed every time they took the field against
the Gators.

The Vols had made the recent series much
more competitive the last four years by win
ning at home in 1998, and at The Swamp last
year.
Now Tennessee will have to wait again this
year to see if another SEC 1 , team can knock off
Florida, which would allow the Vols to sneak
into contention for the East title. The Vols
also host Miami on Nov. 9.
"It's not a given that the winner of this
game wins the Eastern division," Zook said.
"It gives you a little breathing room."
Only once has Florida not made it to the
SEC title game after beating Tennessee. In
1997, the Gators followed a win over the Vols
with losses to LSU and Georgia.
Zook said a 41-16 home loss to top-ranked
Miami two weekends ago accelerated the
Gators' preparation.
"We played the No. 1 football team in the
nation. We were really able to see exactly
where we were and what we needed to work
on," he said.
