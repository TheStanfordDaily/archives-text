# NSO treats new students to a whirlwind weekend
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Since last Thursday, Stanford's
1,728 new undergraduate students
have been awash in almost non-stop
panels, programs and parties, all a
part of the 2002 New Student Ori
entation.
On the whole, NSO 2002 has not
departed much from the model that

morning to give students more time
to move in.

and parents more time to settle in,"
Costa said.
The first major Orientation

event on Thursday was the 112 th
Opening Convocation Ceremony,
held that afternoon.
In the ceremony held in the
Main Quad, prominent administra

the new Farm crop, welcoming
them to Stanford and discussing the
University's opportunities and ex

University President John Hen

since last fall and how the aftermath
of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks has
reinforced his belief in the impor

Hennessy also discussed im

made to freshman and sophomore
programs, encouraged students to
