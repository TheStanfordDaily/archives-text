# NSO treats new students to a whirlwind weekend
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Since last Thursday, Stanford's
1,728 new undergraduate students
have been awash in almost non-stop
panels, programs and parties, all a
part of the 2002 New Student Ori
entation.
On the whole, NSO 2002 has not
departed much from the model that
Orientation at Stanford has fol
lowed for years — most of the
more-than-100 planned events,
such as "The Real World: Stanford"
and "Faces of Community," are Ori
entation staples that new students
praise year after year.
However, intending to lessen the
pace for freshmen and transfer stu
dents and build greater enthusiasm
for events, organizers have made

small changes to the Orientation cal
endar this year — changes they say
have proven very effective.
Perhaps the biggest change to
Orientation is its length. Students
arrived on campus six days before
the start of classes this year, one day
scx>ner than last year.
According to Head Orientation
Coordinator Deborah Costa, no
new activities were added to this
year's Orientation schedule. In
stead, the first activities on Thurs
day were pushed back to the late
morning to give students more time
to move in.
"Even though [Orientation] may
not look more spread out, we were
really hoping it would give students
and parents more time to settle in,"
Costa said.
The first major Orientation

event on Thursday was the 112 th
Opening Convocation Ceremony,
held that afternoon.
In the ceremony held in the
Main Quad, prominent administra
tors and several students addressed
the new Farm crop, welcoming
them to Stanford and discussing the
University's opportunities and ex
pectations.
University President John Hen
nessy discussed what has changed
since last fall and how the aftermath
of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks has
reinforced his belief in the impor
tance of undergraduate education.
Hennessy also discussed im
provements the University has
made to freshman and sophomore
programs, encouraged students to
capitalize on undergraduate re
search opportunities and urged the
parents present to support their
children in exploring their intellec
tual interests.
"I hope during your time here,
you' will find an intellectual passion
that matches your own talents, so
that you may discover, as 1 did,
something that you can pursue for
the rest of your life with enthusiasm
and joy," I lennessy said, referring
to the undergraduate research he
did in electrical engineering.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education John Bravman spoke
about what the University expec ted
from students intellectually.
"In a world too full of ignorance
and complacency, we have very
high expectations (>f you," Bravman
said. "We want to stretch your mind,
not into conformity, but in a way
that makes your life broader and
deeper and richer."
Dean of Admission and Financial
Aid Robin Mamlet spoke, remind
ing the incoming class that, despite
any apprehensions they may have,
they certainly "belong at Stanford."
In addition, Costa addressed the
crowd, and Hennessy introduced
Stanford's new Dean of Freshmen
and Transfer Students, Julie Lyth
cott-Haims.
Students spent the rest of Thurs
day at programs in their residences.
On Friday, students partook in
several academic events and also at
tended two of the largest events held
during Orientation — "Discover
Stanford" and"The Real World:
Stanford."
At Discover Stanford, students
heard from Provost John
Etchemendy, Bravman, Dean of
Students Marc Wais, Lythcott-
Haims and Dandre DeSandies, the
associate director of freshman advis
ing.
Orientation organizers said that
they have witnessed an unusual de
gree of unity already forming with
the Class of 2006 and credited the
efforts of Lythcott-Haims in creat
ing the bond.
"I've been really impressed with
the enthusiasm and energy —
there's a lot of class spirit building

already," said senior Jordan Con
nors, an Orientation coordinator,
pointing out specifically Lythcott-
Haims's speech at Discover Stan
ford and her role in beginning the
"oh-six" cheer that has often been
bellowed over the last several days.
Later in the evening, new stu
dents again poured into Memorial
Auditorium for The Real World:
Stanford, an annual performance
that addresses issues of health and
safety and the changes that occur
when students leave for college.
On Saturday, students spent the
day at a variety of academic pro
grams covering auricular options,
requirements and courses specific to
the freshman year.
Costa said that dedicating Satur
day to academic events was a change
from last year's Orientation, but said
it proved successful, in part because
all of the events were held near the

Quad so they were easy to attend.
"For the academic events, we've
had a really good turnout," she said.
"I feel like we've had great turnout
lor all of the events."
By nightfall, however, academics
fell by the wayside, and students
Hocked to the courtyard of the
Frances C. Arrillaga Alumni Center
for the Hollywood-themed New
Student Party.
Orientation coordinators said
the party was much better attended
than in years past, due perhaps in
part to its being moved from Tresid
der to the upscale Alumni Center —
and the eye-catching Humvee lim
ousine parked out front of it.
"If I had to estimate, I'd say at
least 95 percent of the freshman
class was there," said New Student
Orientation Director Jartjd Scherer.
"It was — and you can quote me
on this, off the hook," Connors said.

Sunday's main events were
"Faces of Community," a presenta
tion exploring the diversity of the
Stanford student body.
As in past years, most students re
sponded favorably to the presenta
tion.
"I was really impressed by the
Faces of Stanford, because 1 feel that
it took a lot of guts to say a lot of
things that [the presenters] said,"
said Gill Quandt, a freshman living
in Otero.
That night, new students en
joyed a movie at Frost Amphithe
atre — another change to the Ori
entation schedule. Last year, stu
dents enjoyed their first cinematic
experience not at the picturesque
Frost, but at t he Avery Aquatic (Cen
ter.
In the next two days, students
will have the opportunity to explore
extracurricular activities at Stan

ford, attend the President's recep
tion, spend the day at "MuFuUn-
Sun," and finally attend the ()-
Show, the annual a cappella show
that will also include two dance
numbers this year.
Despite efforts to relieve students
from the fast pace of Orientation,
many say that they've felt constantly
on-the-gc> since they got to the Farm
on Thursday.
"I (eel pretty busy," Quandt said.
"I feel kind of guilty when I don't go
to things, but I need a little time to
move in and meet people."
Nonetheless, some students
praised the calendar of events.
"1 think it's been really good,"
said Mahnoosh Nik-ahd, a fresh
man in Naranja, part of East Lagu
nita. "Everything's been really bal
anced, and you really have a huge
variety of things you can do. It hasn't
been boring at all."
