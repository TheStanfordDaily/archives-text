# Legal issues restrict dormitory themes
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
As students begin to arrive on
campus, dorm stafT members
face the daunting task of choos
ing a catchy and humorous
theme for their houses.
Typically, a dorm theme
takes advantage of the dorm's
name and its similarity to a name
brand â€” for example, staff from
Otero in Wilbur Hall chose
"Harry Potero" as its theme.
However, sometimes these
lighthearted creations can cre
ate unforeseen legal headaches.
Due to recent corporate com
plaints, the theme-picking
process is now more controlled
than in previous years. Nina
Cann-Woode, a senior who is a
resident assistant in Mirrielees
this year, explained that some
past brand-name themes have
been problematic.
"Larkin was Larkln-N-Out,"
Cann-Woode said, referring to
In-N-Out Burger, a California
hamburger chain. "The graph
ics [for the theme] were up the
entire year, but if the Judicial Af
fairs Office had seen them and
complained, they would have
taken [the graphics] down and
kept the theme, but redesigned
the pictures."
Stephen Stedman, a residential
fellow for Larkin, explained how
the "Larkln-N-Out" theme chosen
for the 1999-2000 school year

raised unpredicted problems.
"The local In-N-Out was in
credibly helpful and donated a
bunch of material," Stedman
said. "It came as a complete sur
prise [when] the corporate
headquarters had a problem
with it.
"They contacted the Univer
sity, [but] at no time did anyone
from the corporate office con
tact us," Stedman said. "It didn't
affect us at all then. The only
way that it affected us is that in
subsequent years, we have been
advised by residential education
to avoid themes that might in
fringe on some sort of copyright
or trademark."
Director of Residential Edu
cation Jane Camarillo discussed
some of the issues that dorm
staffs now have to be wary of
when planning dorm themes.
"We, like everyone else in this
country, are not allowed to in
fringe on copyright or trade
mark laws," Camarillo said. "We
cannot use any intellectual or
protected materials, trade
marks, logos or color schemes
without the explicit permission
of the owner or attribution to the
author."
While there have been no re
ported instances where compa
nies pressed charges concerning
dorm themes, some residential
staff personnel said that, in re

cent years, there has been extra
caution on the part of the Univer
sity. This has resulted in more red
tape when dorms try to adopt con
troversial themes.
Lynn Yee, a senior who was a
head peer advising coordinator in
Brainier Hall last year, noted the
greater stall awareness of the legal
issues.
"Several HPACs said that their
RFs have told them to be careful
this year," Yee said. "But they
didn't specifically say they couldn't
do anything."
Camarillo seconded the height
ened concern among stall mem
bers.
"In developing themes for resi
dences, the residential staff and
student leaders are very careful
not to violate or infringe upon
protected material," Camarillo
said.
Cardenal, a dorm in Florence
Moore Hall, has been hindered
this year by the new cautious poli
cies toward themes. Desiring to
use the proposed "MasterCarde
nal" theme, the dorm staff had to
adjust signs and graphics to make
the theme acceptable.
"We made sure it was approved
by residential education," said se
nior Rene Patnode, an RA this
year in Cardenal. "We were told to
adjust things on the outside of the
dorm. The colors on the two c ir
cles in the logo are white and red
rather than yellow and red [as
MasterCard's graphic isj, and the
logo colors are reversed so that
they are on opposite sides from
the MasterCard setup."
While there are legal concerns
about dorm themes, senior Urvi
Parekh, an RA last year in Bran
ner, explained that these issues by
no means dominate yearly dorm
preparation.
"In terms of risk-management,
[the administration is] more inter
ested in . . . things where students'
lives are at-stake as opposed to is
sues about what companies' prod
ucts we are making themes from,"
Parekh said. "We don't typically
check up individually with each
company."
