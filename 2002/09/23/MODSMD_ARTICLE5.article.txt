# Legal issues restrict dormitory themes
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
As students begin to arrive on
campus, dorm stafT members
face the daunting task of choos
ing a catchy and humorous
theme for their houses.
Typically, a dorm theme
takes advantage of the dorm's
name and its similarity to a name
brand â€” for example, staff from
Otero in Wilbur Hall chose
"Harry Potero" as its theme.
However, sometimes these
lighthearted creations can cre
ate unforeseen legal headaches.
Due to recent corporate com
plaints, the theme-picking
process is now more controlled
than in previous years. Nina
Cann-Woode, a senior who is a
resident assistant in Mirrielees
this year, explained that some
past brand-name themes have
been problematic.
"Larkin was Larkln-N-Out,"
Cann-Woode said, referring to
In-N-Out Burger, a California
hamburger chain. "The graph
ics [for the theme] were up the
entire year, but if the Judicial Af
fairs Office had seen them and
complained, they would have
taken [the graphics] down and
kept the theme, but redesigned
the pictures."
Stephen Stedman, a residential
fellow for Larkin, explained how
the "Larkln-N-Out" theme chosen
for the 1999-2000 school year

raised unpredicted problems.
"The local In-N-Out was in
credibly helpful and donated a
bunch of material," Stedman
said. "It came as a complete sur
prise [when] the corporate
headquarters had a problem
with it.
"They contacted the Univer
sity, [but] at no time did anyone
from the corporate office con
tact us," Stedman said. "It didn't
affect us at all then. The only
way that it affected us is that in
subsequent years, we have been
advised by residential education
to avoid themes that might in
fringe on some sort of copyright
or trademark."
Director of Residential Edu
cation Jane Camarillo discussed
some of the issues that dorm
staffs now have to be wary of
when planning dorm themes.
"We, like everyone else in this
country, are not allowed to in
fringe on copyright or trade
mark laws," Camarillo said. "We
cannot use any intellectual or
protected materials, trade
marks, logos or color schemes
without the explicit permission
of the owner or attribution to the
author."
While there have been no re
ported instances where compa
nies pressed charges concerning
dorm themes, some residential
staff personnel said that, in re
