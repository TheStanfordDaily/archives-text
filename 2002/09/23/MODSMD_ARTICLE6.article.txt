# SSE launches online auction marketplace
## Stanford Bazaar to provide new forum to buy; sell used goods 
### LAUREL ROBERTS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford community members in search of
online bargains will soon have an intriguing
Web-based alternative to the newsgroup
su. market.
This week, Stanford Student Enterprises
will introduce the Bazaar, an online auction
forum for buying and selling books, furniture
and other items.
Located atbazaar.stanford.edu, the forum is
open to all members of the Stanford communi
ty. An SUID is required for access to the site, but
no special membership is necessary.
Elizabeth Yin, the Bazaar's creator, said she
modeled the forum after eßay, the immensely
popular Web site that revolutionized online
commerce.
A seller may post any item he or she wishes
on the Web site.
"We expect mostly textbooks," Yin said. "At
the beginning and end of the year, we also ex
pect a lot of bikes, refrigerators and other use
ful dorm items," Yin said.
Yin describes two primary methods of trans
action. The first is the auction method, similar
to that used on eßay: A seller posts an item, and
potential buyers bid within a specified time pe
riod. The item goes to the highest bidder.
This method has a varying seller's fee. The
lee is a calculated percentage of the price for
which the item sold. While this percentage will
differ, Yin estimates that an average item would
have a fee of about 8 percent. If the item doesn't
sell, there is no fee.
The second method involves a seller adver
tising an item and potential buyers privately e
mailing the seller a bid. The seller can choose

which offer to accept
or can refuse all offers.
Because this
method isn't a true
auction, Yin estimates
it will not be as popu
lar as the first.
Sellers who use the
e-mail method are
charged incur flat $1
posting fee, regardless
of whether the item is
sold.
All profits from the
Bazaar go to the SSE,

the business arm of the ASSU.
"1 think the Bazaar will be useful to students
both for the services we provide, as well as the
money that goes back to the SSE," Yin said.
Like eßay, the Bazaar won't monitor transac
tions. It relies on the honor system between buy
ers and sellers, though it welcomes complaints.
The Bazaar follows in the footsteps of the
su.market newsgroup, which enables sellers to
post messages advertising their items.
While the newsgroup is free of charge, it
lacks a search engine, categorization of items
for sale or an auction system.
Many users also find su.market difficult to
set up.
"It's a hassle to set up, and most people
haven't used newsgroups before," senior Casey
Brazeal said.
Daniel Holbert, a sophomore and loyal
su.market user, looks forward to the launch of
Bazaar, but expressed some reservations. " I t
sounds like a good idea, but the fee might deter
me," he said. "I think it's appropriate that there
is a lee, because the Bazaar is more convenient
and time-consuming to maintain, but I think
su.market is just as useful. Su.market is not as
structured, so you can negotiate prices more
freely."

Sophomore Emily Wood expressed enthusi
asm about the Bazaar's launch.
"I've been waiting for something like the
Bazaar fora long time," she said. "Now stu
dents finally have a way to buy and sell things
like textbooks, instead of relying on the book
store, chat lists and newsgroups. I need a forum
that is user-friendly, and the Bazaar sounds
perfect," Wood said.
Yin came up with the idea for the Bazaar
while shopping for supplies during her fresh
man year.
"I wasn't looking for brand-new items," she
said. "I wanted used items, but I found that re
sources weren't there. I thought the Bazaar
would be a good community in which to buy
and sell, especially when it comes to textbooks,"
Yin said.
Yin then submitted a proposal for the
Bazaar to SSE. Though it rejected an initial first
draft, SSE accepted her second proposal one
year ago. Since then, Yin has worked with SSE
and Web programmers to prepare for the
Bazaar's upcoming launch.
Though the launch was scheduled for Sept.
22, it has been delayed due to Web-server prob
lems. Yin predicts that the Bazaar will launch in
a few days.
