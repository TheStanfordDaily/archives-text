# A-1 Liquors shuts doors after Aug. blaze
## Cause of fire remains under investigation 
### ANTHONY HA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Palo Alto's A-l Liquors, a venue frequent
ed by Stanford students, closed in late August
after it was devastated by a blaze that caused
several hundred thousand dollars worth of
damage.
Battalion Chief Don Dudak of the Palo Alto
Fire Department said the fire was first report
ed at 2:16 p.m. on August 28.
"We know that there was some kind of fire in

the back wall of the storage room," Dudak said.
"The owner tried to put il out but was eventu
ally overwhelmed. Il was at that point that
someone decided to call the fire department."
Dudak added that although the fire de
partment was on the scene for four and a half
hours, the fire — which also damaged the
neighboring Top Cafe — was under control
by 3:00 p.m. A preliminary estimate puts the
total damage at $400,000 — $200,000 to the
building and an additional $200,000 to its
contents.
Dudak did not know the exact age of the A
1, but said that it was at least 30 years old.
Shibu Hormis, manager of Ernie's Wines
& Liquors, another common stop for students
who want to purchase alcohol, witnessed the

fire from his store across the street.
"My customers saw the fire and told me
about it, so I called 911." he said. "I saw the
owner standing outside, and the front of the
store was completely covered with fire. The
owner went back inside to get his car keys,
and people had to pull him out.
"It was a scary time. 1 had to close my store
because it was too windy, and 1 thought the
lire might spread."
Hormis said that he has seen A-l's owner
cleaning and preparing to reopen his store on
several occasions since the fire, but The Daily
was unable to reach anyone connected with
A-l for comment.
Dudak reported that the cause
of the lire remains under investi
gation.
Stanford students said that t he
store, located at 3866 Fl Catnino
Blvd., was popular on campus
due to its less-than-stringent ID
checks.
When asked about what drew
him to A-l, junior Tom Feliz
cited the manager's friendliness.
" Fhe manager was a good
guy," Feliz said. "lie always
greeted me with a warm welcome
and gave me free stuff. I didn't
go there because of prices or any
thing, but because I liked the
store's ambience, and its atmos
phere."
Sophomore Nicholas Prionas
said that he didn't think too
many students would be upset by
the fire.
"In my experience, Stanford
students go to |Ernie's], a nearby
competitor," he said.
Even Feliz acknowledged that
the store's closure will not have
an adverse effect on his lifestyle.
"No, the fire at A-l won't real
ly change things too much for
me," he said. "I can buy liquor
anywhere else. It's just a shame,
that's all."
