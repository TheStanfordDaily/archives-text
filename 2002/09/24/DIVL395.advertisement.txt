Salomon Smith Barney & Citibank
This year, her research helped launch
a new business model in biotech.

changing the industry, Citigroup recruits ambitious, highly talented people and
allows them to find their own path to their potential. To find out more, come to
one of our on-campus presentations or have a look online. Who knows? Perhaps
