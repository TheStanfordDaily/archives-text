# Plea entered for Toogood
## 
### 
SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) — The woman
caught on video beating her 4-year-old daughter
in a department store parking lot will probably
plead guilty and seek mercy from the court, her
lawyer said yesterday.
Madelyne Gorman Toogood, 25, was ar
raigned on a felony charge of battery to a child,
and a magistrate entered an innocent plea on her
behalf. Her attorney, Steven Rosen, called the
plea a formality and later said there was no point
in trying to challenge the surveillance videotape
in court.
"We will probably enter a guilty plea and
throw ourselves on the mercy of the court,"he
said after the arraignment.
He added: "If a jury has to sit in judgment
of this lady, the jury is going to come back with
a guilty verdict... I'm confronted with a video
tape that shows Attila the Hun, no question
about it."
Earlier yesterday, a Probate Court judge or
dered that Toogood's daughter, Martha, remain
in foster care in the meantime, and he gave child
protection officials two weeks to recommend who
should care for the girl.
A doctor examined the girl and found no
medical problems and no long-term signs of
abuse, authorities said.
Toogood will get a 90-minute supervised visit
with her daughter today at a safe house. She will
only get to see her daughter once or twice a week,
Rosen said.
If convicted, Toogood faces up to three years
in prison, though her attorney said he would try
to strike a deal with prosecutors. She faces a hear
ing on Oct. 7.
Prosecutor Christopher Toth said the evi
dence against Toogood was compelling.
"Obviously jail is something you have to seri
ously consider in a case like this," he said.
Toogood, a mother of three, had no comment
as she left court. She remained free on $5,000
bail.
"People might think I'm a monster, but I've
been a mother for six years, and no harm has
come to my children before this, never," Too
good told CNN earlier yesterday. "I'm sorry.
That's all I can say."
Toogood told reporters Sunday she hit her
daughter in the head and back and pulled her
hair but did not punch her. On the video of the
Sept. 13 incident, which has been televised na
tionally, Toogood appears to make punching
motions toward her daughter inside a sport util
ity vehicle.
