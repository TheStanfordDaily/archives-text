SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) —
Brazil's currency plunged to a record
low yesterday, driven by a shortage of
dollars and expectations that a leftist
candidate will win the presidential

election next month.
The Brazilian real fell 17 centavos
yesterday to 3.57 to the U.S. dollar,
its lowest level since the currency was
created in 1994. The real has shed 47

centavos, or 13.2 percent, since Sept.
11.
Currency traders said the Central
Bank sold dollars in an unsuccessful
attempt to stop the slide. The bank

does not comment on its dollar sales.
The stock market also tumbled,
with the main Ibovespa index closing
down 3.35 percent at 9,264. It was the
lowest closing mark since it hit 9,154
on March 3, 1999, the Sao Paulo stock
exchange said.
Investors apparently were reacting
to a survey released Sunday that
showed Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of
the leftist Workers' Party with 44 per
cent of the vote, close to the 50 per
cent share needed fora first-ballot vic
tory on Oct. (i.
The poll showed the government's
candidate, former Health Minister
Jose Sena, with a mere 19 percent.
Sena is considered more market
friendly than Lula.
The real also was pressured by
weakness in overseas markets and the
Central Bank's decision to give up try
ing to roll over US$l.52 billion in dol
lar-linked debt coming due this week.
"It was a lot ol negative news on the
same day," said Alexandre Vasarhe
lyi, a head forex trader at ING Bar
ings in Sao Paulo.
The concern that a Lula victory
might drive away foreign investors
overshadowed another bumper week
for exports.
The government reported a trade
surplus of US$629 million in the
third week of September alone, push
ing the surplus for the year to
U557.24 billion. Brazil is expected to
register a current account surplus
this month for the' first time in eight
vears.
