SRINAGAR, India (AP) — Sepa
ratists killed 10 people in grenade at
tacks on polling stations and gnn battles
with soldiers yesterday, determined to
frighten voters on the eve of state flec
tions in Kashmir.
The violence came as tens of thou
sands of Indian soldiers built sandbag
bunkers at polling booths for the second
round of voting today in India's portion
of the Himalayan province, which is
also claimed by neighboring Pakistan.
Polling stations opened today with
few people venturing out on the heavi
ly guarded streets of Srinagar.
At least one police ollicer was killed
and two were wounded when guerrillas

attacked the campus of the Govern
ment Polytechnic Go liege in downtown
Srinagar. The campus was to be used as
a distribution and collection point for
elections officials and sec urity forces in
today's polling.
Two or three militants were holed
up in the second floor of a building on
campus, firing from windows at soldiers
below.
Separately, an Indian soldier and
four rebels were killed during a fierce
gunfight in a forest along the- highway
connecting jamnm and Srinagar, the
summer and winter c apitals of |ammu-
Kaslunir state, police said. An army offi
cer was wounded in the fighting.

Voters in the two cities go to the polls
today. At least 27,000 soldiers have been
deployed to protect them in Srinagar
alone.
More than 100 political activists and
candidates — including a state minister
— have been killed in election-related
violence since campaigning began earli
er this year.
Despite the violence, election officials
pressed ahead with last-minute checks
of registration lists and coordinated se
curity with soldiers bused in to protect
voters.
"We have tried our best. Hie rest is
lip to (Jod," said election officer (lulam
Jeelani Khan.

Turnout was unexpectedly high in
the state's first round of elections, held
last Monday. The federal elections com
mission said 47.2 percent of 800,000
registered voters in those areas cast
their ballots.
Srinagar saw the worst violence.
Apart from the assault on the campus,
suspected insurgents hurled grenades
and fired guns on several polling sta
tions in the city, wounding eight sol
diers and police officers.
Rebels also tossed a grenade at a ve
hicle c arrying supporters of the opposi
tion Peoples' Democratic Party during
campaigning in Sangatn, about 25 miles
south of Srinagar, police said.
