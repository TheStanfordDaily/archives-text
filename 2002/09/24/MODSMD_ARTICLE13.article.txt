## The 						Stanford Daily SSE should tread carefully with auction service

Futons, clothes, cars, concert tickets or
shoes: You name it, someone's selling
or buying it somewhere at Stanford. If
you're new here, you will soon learn
that there exists a strong and extensive commu
nity of online buyers and sellers at Stanford,
thanks largely to the su.market newsgroup,
which boasts hundreds of users. Given this vi
brant and attentive fan base, the introduction of
SSE's online auction, Bazaar, seems like a good
idea. After all, the site promises to cater to stu
dents who want something different from the
traditional online newsgroup. But we hesitate to
fully support the new enterprise and encourage
SSE to carefully consider its marketing cam
paign if the Web site is to be successful.
The site's creators say Bazaar will offer a
search engine and an auction system similar to
eßay. Buying used textbooks and other goods
has many positive environmental and econom
ic consequences. The creation of this additional

online community could even drive down
prices at the Stanford Bookstore, provided
enough students purchase their textbooks else
where. Bazaar's format will be more user
friendly and could reach a larger number of stu
dents and community members because many
students do not know how to use a newsgroup.
This is a smart strategy, considering that many
people are already familiar with online auctions
and might appreciate buying and selling within
walking distance. Furthermore, SSE will likely
give students who manage the site valuable busi
ness experience.
But we have reservations. Does the Stanford
community really need another online market
place? The newsgroup su.market is one example
of a permanent site that runs smoothly year after
year. The site works well localise it's free and the
community of subscribers is very self-sufficient.
Why introduce such a similar service when the
need has already l>een met? In recent years, most

students can probably name a handful of new
sites started with die best of intentions, usually as
alternatives to high prices at the B(X)kstore. But
some sites fizzled from a lack of interest or when
the sites' creators graduated. Bazaar can work for
this community, but SSE should create some kind
of permanent, lasting framework to keep the site
up and running in the future.
The main obstacle to Bazaar's success is that
students may be reluctant to pay fora service
that they can obtain for free from other venues.
The main draw of other newsgroups is that a
subscriber can post nearly anything he likes for
free. With Bazaar, students must pay a fee —
ranging from $ 1 to as high as 8 percent of the
selling cost. It seems unlikely that a student
would choose this option over something com
pletely free.
We have difficulty believing the online auc
tion is viable at Stanford. Auctions such as eßay
work well because people nationwide bid on

items. But even if hundreds of students used the
service, there's no way to ensure participation in
each auction. Furthermore, do many students
have the patience to wait for an auction to close
when they could simply buy the item direcdy
somewhere else? Many students might in fact
prefer the quick, simple and immediate sales
from other communities.
We think SSE tapped into a valuable resource
in the online buying and selling community. We
admire the organization's plan to increase its
revenue. Plus, this could be an opportunity to
institutionalize one online buying and selling
option that could increase the number of users
over time. However, SSE will need to make a
diligent effort to differentiate its site from the
other options. It will have to create something so
worthwhile and different that su.market users
will make the switch — or at least so enough
newcomers will get online and start shelling out
the cash.
