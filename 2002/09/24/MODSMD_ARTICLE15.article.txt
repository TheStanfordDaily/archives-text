Grocery-shopping options overlooked
Your article about grocery shopping
("So long Tres Ex: grocery shopping,
Stanford style," Sept. 19) was sadly in
complete. In addition to the Safeway in
Sharon Heights, there is a Safeway on El
Camino a few blocks north of campus.
Closer and reachable by Marguerite are |.
J. & F. on the corner of El Camino and
College Ave. in College Terrace and Mol
lie Stone's near the California Ave. train
station. If you take the bus out to San An
tonio Shopping Center you will find fresh
food at Trader Joe's, Albertsons and Safe
way. Most of the Safeways are open 24
hours in case of hunger pangs in the mid
dle of the night.

Alum calls community to action
As a Stanford undergraduate from the
activist years of the Vietnam War (1968 to
1971), I am so grateful for the people, insti
tutions and events that shaped my adult life
and passions. Particularly, I think officii

gious scholar] B. Davie Napier, [former Re
ligious Studies Prof.] Robert McAfee
Brown, the MemChu choir, Lambda Nu,
Stanford-in-Germany XXIII, the April 3rd
Movement and the ROTC protesters.
I am tempted to write a long recitation
of rational arguments to oppose an ex
panded pre-emptive war on Iraq. But
time is short. The word and the spirit of
"inevitability" is spreading across our
land, much like the clouds of poison gases
released in recent truck and train crashes.
I his letter is a call to those who already
know in their hearts that this war is wrong.
Do not succumb to defeatism. Don't
accept that George Bush will get his way,
or even that he can't change his ways.
This war will only happen if we retreat in
silence. With whatever skill or talent or
energy you have, use it now for peace. If
you pray, do it now. If you write, do it
now. If you lobby, if you are good at con
vincing friends and family, if you sing for
peace, if you preach, if you collect peti
tion signatures, if you paint pictures or
signs, if you fast, if you march with hun
dreds in the streets, if you make a lonely
witness all by yourself, if you can tap the
deep reserves of conscience within your
soul: Do it now. Act in any and all non-vi

olent ways you can to say no to war
against Iraq.
Our government would have us be
lieve that through war, we can "liberate"
the people of Iraq. But you cannot liber
ate anything from evil with evil. The only
forces strong enough to truly liberate
from evil are love, forgiveness and mercy.
This truth has been taught to us, whether
we are Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu,
Buddhist, Humanist or of most other
faiths. Before these things can liberate,
however, we must change them from
nouns to verbs. We must do it as individ
uals and as a nation: Go and love, go and
forgive, go and show mercy. Do it now.
