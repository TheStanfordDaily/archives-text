# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Opportunists use Sept. 11 to sell — from cell phones to war 
### JOANNA PETRONE GUEST COLUMNIST 
It has been going on fora year, more or
less. I cannot say exactly when it started,
for in the first flood of days following the
Sept. 11 attacks I remained largely deaf to
all noises north of Fourteenth Street. Now,
though, it is impossible to ignore such a
troubling trend.
A massive campaign is under way to use
last year's terrorist attacks to sell Ameri
cans on a number of things: from t-shirts
and commemorative lapel pins to an in
creased military budget, a diminished
concern for civil liberties and, most recent
ly, war.
A recent issue of The New York Times
bears an advertisement fora $750 crystal
paperweight shaped and colored as an
American flag; the word "Pride" is printed
above in capital letters. Midway down
page A8 is an ad for rare and antiquarian
books; the first third of the ad space is oc
cupied by an American-flag-design image

of the continental U.S. and the words
"9/11! We must never forget!" A full-page
acl on page All presents a convincing ar
gument on the value of AT&T Wireless
Services, calling on Americans to "hurry
and save on a Nokia cellular phone" and
displaying a cell phone decorated with
stars and stripes.
I his is a campaign to anesthetize Amer
ican souls, and it is intolerant of the kind of
grief and reflection that cannot be ex
pressed with a slogan or a patriotic cry. It
is a campaign to frighten and shame
Americans into a state of catatonic compla
cency cleverly dressed up as unity. It is,
above all, an advertising campaign, and
like all advertising campaigns, its primary
purpose is to convince the public to buy,
buy, buy.
The proliferation of cell phone and de
signer jean ads that obscure price tags with
a patriotic slogan, a call to "never forget"
or a shadowy image of two tall buildings is,
at the absolute minimum, tacky.
But these ads are more than distasteful;

they are a symptom — if not a cause — of
the general malady in this nation of per
ceiving and treating a real-life event, with
real-world causes and real-world conse
quences, as a marketing opportunity.
Even the commonly accepted descriptor
"9/11" has the suspiciously quick, catchy
ring of a made-fbr-television sound byte.
More disturbing still is that as oppor
tunistic as so many businesses have been in
their use of "9/11," our own administra
tion takes the cake.
1 he use of marketing tactics by our own
government to deaden the critical abilities
of the public to question and consider a
whole range of actions and issues — a
good deal of them no more relevant to last
September's attacks than a thousand-dol
lar paperweight decorated with a llag — is
frightening. While "9/11" has been elevat
ed to a national myth of the highest order,
actual issues and actual concerns are swept
under the heavy rug of the American llag.
It takes little more than a quick invocation
of the myth-laden language of the tragedy

of "9/11" or "the war on terror" to dismiss
or silence anyone voicing concern over
real violence, real war, real economic woes
and real violations of civil liberties. Hie
game of myths and marketing has become
a dangerous and deadly one, and it is
being played on a global scale.
Following his speech to the U.N. on the
urgency of action against Iraq, President
Bush held a reception for various world
leaders at the Winter Garden in the World
Financial Center. From the window, the
dusty, empty pit we call Ground Zero was
spread out like a backdrop. By playing on
the heightened fears, confusions and sym
pathies triggered by this stark view, Bush
used the destruction of the twin towers as
a selling point for an agenda which has no
relation to what actually happened on
Sept. 11,2001.
In fact, Iraq has been on the Bush ad
ministration's agenda since before Amer
ican newscasters could convincingly pro
nounce "al-Qaida." Failing to make any
plausible links between Saddam Hussein

and al-Qaida, the administration is now
cashing in on endless reminders of the
deaths of 3,000 people, without the
slightest regard for who actually perpe
trated the attacks and should be brought
to justice.
Clothing companies have always been
interested in selling jeans, the Bush family
has always been interested in selling oil,
weapons companies in selling weapons,
and war hawks in selling war. This is not
new. What is new is the thickening of red,
white and blue paint into a coat so thick it
hides the real issues beneath it. It is high
time to start chipping oil the paint.
(lashing in on the tragedy of killed civil
ians and the grief of their families to sell
jeans and cell phones is disgusting, (lash
ing in on the tragedy to sell war is criminal
and wrong.
As an American, I'm just not buying it
anymore.
