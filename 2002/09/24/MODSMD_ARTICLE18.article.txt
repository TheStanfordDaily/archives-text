### LAJU OBASAJU WASHINGTON SQUARE NEWS 
(U-WIRE) NEW YORK â€” A recent proposal
for voluntary special interest housing for African-
American students at New York University has
sparked a heated debate on campus. Some stu
dents believe such a housing program would
unite African-American students on campus,
while others feel it would further isolate black stu
dents from the entire NYU population.
The idea originated from Gallatin senior
Alphonso Saville. An African-American residen
tial adviser at Goddard Residence 1 fall, he noticed
that he was having poor attendance at many of his
floor-sponsored events and programs, and felt it
was due to a racial barrier.
"My residents didn't want to go to my 'black
cultural events,'" he explained, "and in my two
years as an RA I never had a black resident."
Saville has taken his proposal to the Office of
Housing and Residence Life. As of now, that is
where the proposal stands.
The idea specifically calls for specific floors of a

single dorm to l>e reserved for those interested in
living in such a housing arrangement. It would
not lx j mandatory for all African-American stu
dents, and it would be open to anyone interested,
regardless of race.
Both supporters and opponents of the plan
point to a lack of black representation in the Resi
dence Hall staff. Saville felt it would be difficult for
a black student to confide in a white RA on issues
specific to the black population.
But perhaps the ultimate indicator of the pos
sible success of such a program is dependent on
the reaction of the students, particularly African-
American freshmen and sophomores, whom the
Program Housing would affect in their junior and
senior years. Mecca Scott, one of two African-
American building hall managers at Goddard, has
not completely made up her mind either way on
the idea. To her, Program 112 lousing could provide
a comfort zone for students. But, she added, "In
the real world, it doesn't exist."
Freshman Christina Bonne Annei felt that it
would be a good idea as well, but recommended
that students only be allowed to participate for

one to two years. According to Annei, "It will make
the college transition easier."
But the plan does have detractors. Andrea
Donkor, an African-American RAat the Lafayette
Residence Hall, agreed that there was a dispro
portionate number of black RAsat NYU. Yet she
felt that Program Housing for African-American
students would be a source of animosity.
Freshman Leighton Gordon believes that mi
nority housing would further stigmatize African-
American students. "It implies that the minority
doesn't like the majority and wants to segregate
themselves from the majority," he said.
Nathifa Fearon, a School of Education fresh
man raised the question of where the plan would
stop once started; wouldn't lesbian, gay, Islamic,
Latino or Asian students want the same thing? She
felt this would polarize the campus.
Only time will tell whether or not this plan
will be implemented at New York University.
Although the Office of Housing and Residence
Life now has the proposal on the table, the final
decision will not be made until the Spring se
mester of 2003.
