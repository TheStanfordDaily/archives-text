# British prof. defends 'terrorism'

### SARA PERKINS BROWN DAILY HERALD 
(U-WIRE) PROVIDENCE, R.I.
— Professor Ted Honderich of the
University College in London ad
dressed the controversial idea of a
moral justification for terrorism in
Eriday's concluding lecture of the
two-week long "911 + 1" program at
Brown University.
Honderich said there was no moral
justification lor last September's ter
rorist attacks on the United Suites, but
said it might be possible to morally ra
tionalize Palestinian terrorist attacks
in Israel.
Reading a paper culled from his
new book "After the Terror," Hon
derich spoke to a small audience in the
Watson Institute's Joukowsky Forum.
He said the "great goods" of society
— which include sustenance, security
and power — are unevenly distributed
across different societies. Access to
these goods differentiates good lives
from bad ones, he told the audience.
In the Western world, the average

life expectancy is 78 years. In several
African countries, life expectancy is 40
years, and is only 30 years for (he
poorest 10 percent of these countries,
he said.
These disparities, and the West
ern world's unwillingness to sacrifice
anything to close the widening gap,
highlight what Honderich called a
"deprivation of omission."
"We have done overwhelming
wrong ... in failing to help those
Africans who lead bad lives . . . [that
is] as indubitable as sexually abusing
a child," he said. "We need to escape
the illusion that to be ordinary is to
be innocent."
Deprivation by omission — the
act of not giving what you can to
those who need it — may be just as
bad as deprivation by active commis
sion, he said.
He said there was no moral justifi
cation for the terrorist attacks of Sept.
11, 2001, and the conscious murder
that the hijackers perpetrated.
There was "no reasonable hope
that [the acts of Sept. 1 1,2001 ] could

work to secure a meaningful end,"
he said.
Honderich said he was less sure
that Palestinian terrorists in Israel are
not justified in their actions.
"Palestinians have bad lives" and
little other recourse, he said. Denied
any reasonable path to secure "free
dom and power in their homeland,"
humans will resort to almost anything,
Honderich said.
An action that satisfies a desire for
sustenance, security, power and other
"great goods" can be morally rational
ized, he said.
Honderich is a professor of Philos
ophy of Mind and Logic at University
College in London and has lectured at
NYU and Yale University.
His books include "Violence for
Equality: Inquiries in Political Philos
ophy," "Punishment," "Philosopher:
A Kind of Life," "How Free Are You?"
and "After the Terror."
The event was the last in a series
of lectures, panels and discussions
called "911 + 1: The Perplexities of
Security."
