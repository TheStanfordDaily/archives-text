# University resolves income tax mix-up
## 
### MARK DOMINIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
Some graduate students teach
ing or conducting research on
campus this summer may have
found their back pockets a little
thinner than usual, as a computer
glitch caused the University to in
correctly withhold federal taxes
from their incomes.
Graduate students are normally
exempt from federal income tax
and social security tax for work that
is "incident to and for the purpose
of pursuing their course of study."
In past years this has been ac
counted for automatically by the
payroll system. But this summer,
graduate students who were en
rolled in fewer than six units had
taxes withheld from their checks
because of a computer glitch.
The Internal Revenue Service
recently changed its policy on acad
emic research earnings, which con
tributed to the cause of the error,
said Joel Brown, a doctoral candi
date in computer science.
"The IRS said that if students
weren't doing a 50 percent acade
mic workload, they would have to
pay FICA," he said. "The logic of
the University's policy, which does
allow students to enroll for fewer
units than is considered half-time
but still adhere to the 50 percent
criterion is that 100 percent of one's
time spent researching fora disser
tation, does meet the academic
workload criterion."
According to Brown, Stanford
never used to deduct federal in
come taxes from grad students who

had 100 percent assignments in the
summer.
This year, "they started in the
middle of this summer, and they
didn't tell us it was going to hap
pen," Brown said. "They didn't tell
us after it happened either.
"Students just started to notice
that they were missing 7.5 percent
of their paychecks. A few of my
friends and 1 decided to figure out
what was happening, and we didn't
know what was going on. We didn't
know whom to contact, so it seemed
appropriate to write a letter to
high-up Stanford administrators,"
he said.
The change in withholdings ac
tually occurred because of an error
in the payroll system, but that
wasn't communicated to students
until they had already noticed an
error.
" The reason why FICA was de
ducted was because of our policy of
allowing students to work 100 per
cent of the time while enrolling in
only one unit was misinterpreted
by the computer system," said Ann
George, assistant dean of research
and graduate policy.
"The computer thought that the
students were not working full
time," she added. "We did not want
that to happen."
The computer system that
caused the glitch was new this sum
mer, according to George.
Students discovered the error.
They then contacted their depart
ments and spoke with the payroll
department, George said.
