## Bye week helps football recover from injuries After week to regroup, healthy Stanford football ready to take on Sun Devils 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Cardinal football team (1-1), which
was banged up a bit in its 63-26 victory over
San Jose State (2-2), had the weekend oil to
rest, relax and reload for this weekend's
Pacific-10 Conference opener at Arizona
State (3-1).
Stanford saw three of its biggest offensive
playmakers — junior quarterback Chris
Lewis, senior running back Kerry Carter
and junior wide receiver Luke Powell — get
knocked out of the game during the first
half against the Spartans.
Lewis suffered a deep quad contusion on
a brutal Mike Liriano sack late in the second
quarter that was initially believed to be a

knee injury, darter's knee was injured early
in the first quarter, vviih Powell suffering an
ankle injury just a few minutes later.
On top of that, senior right guard Greg
Schindler missed the San Jose State game
due to a sprain of the MCL in his right
knee, which he suffered in the season
opener at Boston College. First team All-
Pacific-10 Conference junior light end
Brett Pierce was lost for the season w hen he
tore the ACL in his left knee against the Ka
gles. Knee problems have also prohibited
senior wide receiver Caleb Bowman and
senior cornerback Carry Cobb from play
ing this season.
Carter, Lewis and Powell are all expect
ed to be at full speed for the Arizona State
game, while Schindler is day-to-day and
may not make it back. If the second-team
All-American cannot play, junior Dusiin
Stimson will fill in for Schindler again.
In part because of those injuries, head

Senior receiver Ryan Wells and the Stanford football team enjoyed a week off to heal their
wounds before they take on Arizona State this Saturday in Tempe, Ariz.
