## Bye week helps football recover from injuries After week to regroup, healthy Stanford football ready to take on Sun Devils 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Cardinal football team (1-1), which
was banged up a bit in its 63-26 victory over
San Jose State (2-2), had the weekend oil to
rest, relax and reload for this weekend's
Pacific-10 Conference opener at Arizona
State (3-1).
Stanford saw three of its biggest offensive
playmakers — junior quarterback Chris
Lewis, senior running back Kerry Carter
and junior wide receiver Luke Powell — get
knocked out of the game during the first
half against the Spartans.
Lewis suffered a deep quad contusion on
a brutal Mike Liriano sack late in the second
quarter that was initially believed to be a

knee injury, darter's knee was injured early
in the first quarter, vviih Powell suffering an
ankle injury just a few minutes later.
On top of that, senior right guard Greg
Schindler missed the San Jose State game
due to a sprain of the MCL in his right
knee, which he suffered in the season
opener at Boston College. First team All-
Pacific-10 Conference junior light end
Brett Pierce was lost for the season w hen he
tore the ACL in his left knee against the Ka
gles. Knee problems have also prohibited
senior wide receiver Caleb Bowman and
senior cornerback Carry Cobb from play
ing this season.
Carter, Lewis and Powell are all expect
ed to be at full speed for the Arizona State
game, while Schindler is day-to-day and
may not make it back. If the second-team
All-American cannot play, junior Dusiin
Stimson will fill in for Schindler again.
In part because of those injuries, head

Senior receiver Ryan Wells and the Stanford football team enjoyed a week off to heal their
wounds before they take on Arizona State this Saturday in Tempe, Ariz.
coach Buddy Teevens has played
three true freshmen so far this sea
son: defensive end Julian Jenkins,
cornerbackT.J. Rushing and tight
end Matt Traverso.
Former head coach Tyrone
Willingham, in contrast, almost al
ways redshirted his freshmen. For
example, of the 16 seniors on the
current roster, only two played for
Willingham as true freshmen.
Teevens, though, has not
been afraid to put young talent
to the test.
"If a guy has the abilities and
the skill to play and is our best guy
at a position, we'd just as soon get
him on the field," Teevens said.
So far, the strategy has worked
well: Rushing has an interception,
and Jenkins has a sack.
Also, redshirt freshman quar
terback Kyle Matter has played so
well in his first two collegiate
games that some are wondering if
a quarterback controversy might
be on the hori/on.
Teevens has been forthright
about the issue.
"Chris Lewis is our starting
quarterback," Teevens said.
"There isn't a quarterback con
troversy, [but] there is more com
petition than maybe we realized
earlier in the season or in the pre
season."
It's been a meteoric season so
far for Matter, who was competing
for the second-string spot with
sophomore Ryan Eklund. He now
finds himself the team's leading
passer and, in fact, the seventh
ranked passer in all of Division I

college football. Matter is 24-of-35
passing for 367 yards, with two
touchdowns and one intercep
tion. In addition, the speedy sig
nalcaller has rushed fora pair of
scores.
Both Lewis and Matter have
been getting plenty of reps in
practice, and the team seems to
respond equally well to each
quarterback.
Sophomore wide receiver Teyo
Johnson explained after the last
game that the receivers don't
change what they do regardless of
who is playing quarterback.
" They are both good quarter
backs .. . maybe the coaches will
put more responsibility on Chris,
but as far as receivers, we stay the
same," Johnson said.
Teevens added that "good ball
decisions" would be the focus of
the off-week. Stanford's defense
has forced ten turnovers already
this season, but the offense has
coughed up eight of its own.
"We can't allow people to stay in
the ballgame, and we did that with
our turnovers," Teevens said of
the Cardinal's effort against San
Jose State.
Stanford practiced Wednesday
through Friday last week before
taking the weekend off. The Car
dinal will practice today through
Thursday before heading to
Tempe, Ariz., to face the Sun Dev
ils on Saturday at 12:30 p.m.
The game will be televised on
ABC. The Cardinal has won its
last five games televised on the
network, all against marquee
opponents.
Arizona State leads the all-time
series, 11-7, but the Cardinal has
won the last three meetings by 20
or more points.
