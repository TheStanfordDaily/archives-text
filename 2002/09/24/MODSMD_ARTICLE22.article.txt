# Coach's final season inspires team
## 
### SPENCER PORTER 
Consider it the end of an era: Stan
lord's field hockey coach for the last 18
years, Sheryl Johnson, will be retiring at
the end of this season, leaving behind a
legacy oft hampionships and success.
Johnson, who has led the Cardinal
to a 103-120-11 record, nine North
ern Pacific Athletic Conference cham
pionships and seven NCAA tourna
ment appearances, has been instru
mental in Stanford's rise to promi
nence in a sport largely foreign to the
state of California.
But don't remind her players.
While they realize that this is the last
chance for glory for their coach, they
don't feel pressured to make sure their
coach goes out with a bang. Instead,
they view it more as an opportunity to
succeed.
"I don't really look at it as pressure,"
said senior forward Noor Dawood, the
team's leading scorer. "1 feel like it's more
of a challenge for us to step up to make
her last season special. I don't think any
one sees it as anything but a positive op
portunity for the team."
Eleanor Morgan, one of only two
sophomores on the team, added that
Johnson's last season puts extra emphasis
on winning.
"After hearing the news," Morgan
said, "I think the season look on a lot
more meaning lor all of us. We all wanted
to do well before, but now our desire to
win has increased because we want to
make her last season memorable."
That desire seemed to manifest itself
well at the start of the season, with the
team posting three straight wins. Defeat
ing Ohio State 1-0 in overtime, Rutgers 2-
0 and Albany 4-0 made for an auspicious

start for the team, both on the offensive
and defensive sides of the ball.
But then the tide turned for Stanford,
which dropped live of its next six games.
Losses to Syracuse (3-0), New 1 iampshire
(3-1), Cornell (4-1), Lafayette (4-3) and
Kent State (1-0) were all very frustrating
for the squad, mostly because the scores
didn't reflect the run of play on the field.
The Cardinal has a 167-100 shot ad
vantage over its opponents on the season,
but its goal differential is a meager plus-2,
highlighting the teams troubles in con
verting scoring opportunities.
"Of course, one of the big problems is
finishing," Morgan said. "It's been frus

trating for us, especially coming so close
to winning many of these games and not
having the final score reflect the actual
course of the game. Despite this, our con
fidence in our ability hasn't faltered, and
we know we can turn things around."
Over the weekend, the team seemed to
do just that, after going up on Pacific 2-0.
Although the Tigers scored with seven
seconds left to cut the Cardinal lead to 2-
1, the team was happy to get a win in its
first conference game of the season, espe
cially as the away team.
However, Stanford hit another scor-

ing snag in its next game, losing
1-0 in overtime to No. 8 lowa.
The Cardinal had many oppor
tunities to score, with eight shots
and five penalty corners, but
couldn't put the ball away. Even
with the loss, the team was in
good spirits.
"We're all really happy with the
game," I)awood said. "It was one
of our best games all season in
terms of our play. We're all disap
pointed with the loss, but not with
how we played."
Dawood leads the team in
points on the year with seven.
She also had the game-winning
goal in each of Stanford's first
three wins.
Senior Tysie Sawyer became
the first Stanford player in almost
a year to score two goals in one
game when she accomplished the
feat against Albany on Sept. 5. The

defender is looking forward to an
other stellar year after leading the
defense last year to an astonishing
0.95 GAA, the second-best average
in the country.
After losing its top two scor
ers to graduation last year, the
Cardinal is looking to Dawood,
Morgan, senior forward Aman
da Billmyer and sophomore
forward Molly Melcher to step
up in the scoring department.
Billmyer comes into this season
with career totals of 31 points in
55 total starts. Senior Christina
Williams will command the
midfield, and senior defenders
Amrit Chima, Liz Ott and Lau
ren Steward fill out the Stan
ford backfield.
In goal for the Cardinal is ju
nior Emily Zander, who, in her
first year as a starter, is holding
on to a 1.64 GAA with three wins
to her credit. Sharing time with
Zander is freshman Ana
Kralovec, who picked up her
first collegiate win in Stanford's
season opener.
