# Baby blue has nothing on Cardinal red
## 
### 
Over the last two days, your
humble ink-stained wretch
had the pleasure of moving
his younger sister in at our
fair neighbor to the south, the living
space-challenged University of Califor
nia-Los Angeles.
While perusing our equivalent in
Pauleyville, the voluminous and im
pressive Daily Bruin, I happened
across an article written by a sports edi
tor in which the author asked Chris
Berman, The Voice of ESPN, if UCLA
was still the top jock school in the coun
try — as named by Sports Illustrated
several years ago.

Obviously, the Bruin
scribe expected some
sort of affirmation of
Westwood's athletic su
periority, but the es
teemed Mr. Herman
deferred, claiming he
didn't "know enough
about college sports" to
answer.

Didn't know enough? Right. Are
they putting something in the water in
Bristol these days?
But 1 digress. In any case, both our
friend in Los Angeles and Boomer are
completely missing the boat, which

sailed through UCLA long ago on its
way to a place well to the north, home
to Nobels and Pulitzers and dancing
conifers and. . . I think you can sense
where I'm going with this.
lake a look in the Hall of Fame over
in the first lloor of the Arrillaga Family
Sports Center. See those big crystal tro
phies? They're called Sears Cups, and
they don't give them away on the cor
ner to anyone with a couple of ben
jamins to spare.
Since 1980, Stanford athletic teams
have accounted for 66 NCAA national


Tim Kane
championships, more than atiy
other university in the nation in
any of the three divisions. Over
all, the Cardinal has brought in
83 championships, only three be
hind the baby blue and gold —
and we should catch them either
this year or the next.
And that's without even giving
consideration to the considerable
academic restrictions under which
the Department of Athletics and
its coaches operate. It would be
one thing to open the doors to
anyone managing to walk upright
and chew gum at the same time —
and then start hoarding crystal.

Don't gel me wrong; champi
onships are nice. Awesome. Stu
pendous, even. All the pretty
NCAA trophies in tlie world,
though, aren't going to make up
for weak student body support.
Here it's no problem, thanks to
two words: 6th Man. Football
gets huge groups of students too,
and other sports aren't too shab
by either — though support
could be better.
Being a jock school, though,
should be about more than that.
There's gotta be a lot more jocks
around than just the ones who
wear the fancy unis.
Wouldn't you know it, on the
Farm, former high school jocks
are in abundance. You can't
throw a stone and not hit some
one who suited up once upon a

time — and most importantly,
continues to do their thing in in
tramurals or pickup games. Even
those of us who are major lab rats
and library slaves haven't forgot
ten how to run the pick and roll
or slam a forehand winner.
So, Mr. Berman, because 1
know you have nothing better to
do than read college newspa
pers, here's some advice for you:
the next time a student journalist
asks you about the No. 1 jock
school in the country, keep your
answer short and sweet.
Go Cardinal.

of the Sears Clips to be removed from
A rrillaga so that Josh Thiel and
Jenny Claypool will have more space
on their desktops.
