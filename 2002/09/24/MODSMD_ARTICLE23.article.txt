Over the last two days, your
humble ink-stained wretch
had the pleasure of moving
his younger sister in at our
fair neighbor to the south, the living
space-challenged University of Califor
nia-Los Angeles.
While perusing our equivalent in
Pauleyville, the voluminous and im
pressive Daily Bruin, I happened
across an article written by a sports edi
tor in which the author asked Chris
Berman, The Voice of ESPN, if UCLA
was still the top jock school in the coun
try â€” as named by Sports Illustrated
several years ago.

Obviously, the Bruin
scribe expected some
sort of affirmation of
Westwood's athletic su
periority, but the es
teemed Mr. Herman
deferred, claiming he
didn't "know enough
about college sports" to
answer.

Didn't know enough? Right. Are
they putting something in the water in
Bristol these days?
But 1 digress. In any case, both our
friend in Los Angeles and Boomer are
completely missing the boat, which

sailed through UCLA long ago on its
way to a place well to the north, home
to Nobels and Pulitzers and dancing
conifers and. . . I think you can sense
where I'm going with this.
lake a look in the Hall of Fame over
in the first lloor of the Arrillaga Family
Sports Center. See those big crystal tro
phies? They're called Sears Cups, and
they don't give them away on the cor
ner to anyone with a couple of ben
jamins to spare.
Since 1980, Stanford athletic teams
have accounted for 66 NCAA national
