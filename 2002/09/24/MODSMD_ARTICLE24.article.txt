# Steak-ing his way to glory
## 
### SPENCER PORTER STAFF COLUMNIST 
I hate all you SSE freaks, with
internships over the summer
for Microsoft and Intel and
full paying jobs at NASA. 1
vowed that i would not become
like you over the summer — slaves
to the man.
This summer, I lived the
dream — the dream of every I 1-
year-old kid in America. I stayed
up late, drank all the Coke 1 want
ed and watched the two greatest
shows in the history of television.
From June to September, I was
hooked on The Simpsons and
Sports Center.
Those two shows encapsulate
all that a college guy would ever
need coming out of a metal and
plastic box: sports, comedy, sus
pense, drama and even girls! 1
mean, just take a look at Linda
Colin and tell me you can't think a
dirty thought. Ok, maybe it's just
me. (Editor's note: It is.)
But if there is a drawback to the
two shows, it is this: They rarely
comment on the same stuff . While
pure sports and pure comedy
aren't what the two shows are all
about, they rarely have the same
perfect mix of sports and comedy.
It's always a little off.
But what, to my surprise, did I
find in Amarillo, Texas, midway
through my journey on Route (Hi
from Tulsa to Albuquerque? It
was the quintessential juxtaposi
tion of the two shows. It was the
thread of commonality that I had
been searching for between pure
comedy and pure sporting enter

tain men t.
It was the Big Texan Steakhouse.
Those Simpsons nerds among
you will undoubtedly remember
the episode in which Homer tries
to eat a gargantuan steak, only to
become a trucker. And those
Sports Center nerds among you
will undoubtedly remember the
| uly 4 Sportscenter, in which a fea
ture on Takeru " The Tsunami"
Kobayashi and his dominance at
the annual Nathan's Hot Dog Fat
ing Competition was aired (51.5
dogs in 12 minutes).
So when I found myself in
front of a 72 ounce steak, a size-7
plastic bootful of water, a shrimp
cocktail, a dinner salad, a dinner
roll and a baked potato, I knew
that I had reached the pinnacle of
my career as a sports and comedy
fan. It could only go downhill
from there. Downhill doesn't
even come close to describing
how badly I failed.
The deal was, if I could eat it all
(the sides too) in one hour, I would
win the eating competition, and
the entire meal would be free. If 1
failed, it was 60 bucks. Additional
ly, my 16-year-old brother, sitting
next to me, was attempting the
same feat.
Forget pairs downhill
Rollerblade dancing. This is the
kind of sport that should be on the
X-Cames.
We heard tons of stories about
past winners. The youngest was an
1 I-year-old kid, the lightest was
I 11 pounds (1 If) after), the short
est time was set just the week be
fore at 9 minutes, 52 seconds, and
we heard the exploits of the pro

fessional wrestler "Klondike Jack,"
who was the only man to eat two
full dinners in an hour. Frankly,
this was my worst idea since asking
John Ashcroft if his middle name
was Abdullah.
The meal (well, seven meals ac
tually) started off rather well. We
had both been instructed to go for
t lie steak first, described by an "ex
pert" as "the big dog," or "as large
as a boy," under the advisement
that your stomach doesn't realize
that it's full until 20 minutes after
you start to eat, so it's a good idea
to pack the meat in as fast as possi
ble. I rolled my eyes like I was
Ashcroft (post-question), but when
faced with a steak the size of an
Olsen twin, you'll take whatever
advice you can.
In all honesty, I started off
pretty well, hut then again, so
does everybody. My plan was to
attack the steak for 20 minutes,
then eat all the side dishes for 20,
and then take the steak for the last
20. 1 ate a great deal of the steak,
and when 1 could take it no
longer, I moved on to the side
dishes. Those 1 took care of in
about 10 minutes, which left me
in good shape to finish up the
measly 30 ounces of meat I still
had left. To compare, a measly 30
ounces i.s enough to feed a family
of four.
To make a long story short, I
knew 1 was in trouble when two
truckers waddled up to me with
about 20 minutes left. They were
good guys, both well over 300
pounds, hearts made of gold and a
good deal of arterial blockage.
They looked at me deep in the
eyes, then at the steak. Again at
me, and then at the steak. One of
them focused on me again. I was
hoping to get a nice word of en
couragement, a little "Hang in
there!", or maybe a "Do it for our
troops in Afghanistan!" (Hey, we
were in Texas).

Instead, what 1 got out of this
mammoth of a man was, "Whoo
ee, that's a lot of steak." This, com
ing from a man as big as the cow
which I was eating, killed my ap
petite. I was done.
All in all, I lost. 1 didn't even
come close to finishing. With
about 15 minutes left, my throat
simply refused to let anything
pass. Even saliva wasn't welcome.
After I had been chewing on the
same little morsel of top sirloin
for five minutes without even
contemplating swallowing, I

threw in the towel.
Thankfully, my brother
failed as well, although he came
much closer. With a last ditch ef
fort, he shoved all the meat he
could into his mouth with five
seconds left, but he, like me,
could not get it down, and he
failed. Another five minutes and
lie would have had it. I needed
another day and a half.
Hut you know, I'm glad I
didn't eat it all. Eating just 42
ounces wrecked my digestive sys
tem, and watching my brother

puke steak juice just outside the
Blue Swallow Motel in Tucum
cari, N.M., made me realize that
I am not Takeru Kobayashi, nor
Homer Simpson.
1 can only hope to be Sports
center's Scott Van Pelt, a distance
away from all the steak, but oh so
close to that vixen, Linda Cohn.

meal in less than an hour.
