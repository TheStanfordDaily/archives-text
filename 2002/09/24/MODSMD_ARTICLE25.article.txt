# Palmer's passing game not up to par
## 
### JASON W. DAVID USC DAILY TROJAN 
(U-WIRK) MANHATTAN, Kan. — It was
too little, too late; and on the last play, it was
simply too high. The passing game that was
crucial to the Southern California football
team in its first two wins this season was shut
down by the Wildcats for the first three quar
ters Saturday. This created a gap in the score
too large to make up by the time Carson
Palmer and his receivers started connecting
in the fourth quarter.
"It took us too long to get going," Palmer
said.
Palmer completed 18 of his 47 pass at
tempts in the game for 180 yards — a signif
icant drop-off from the 70 percent comple
tion rating he had going into the contest.
Through the first three quarters, he was 10-
for-29 for only 54 yards.
The Wildcats played tight coverage, deny
ing Palmer his primary targets on most of the
passing plays. Although Palmer did an excel
lent job of finding second and third receivers
in the first two games, his offensive line could

not buy him enough time against the tireless
Wildcat defensive line. Palmer was frequent
ly flushed out of the pocket.
"It was hard to get a good jump of! the
ball," said light end Alex Holmes, referring
to the boisterous cheering that pulsated
throughout the intimate stadium.
Even when Palmer found open receivers,
purple jerseys usually surrounded them.
"They did a good job of covering every
down," Palmer said. "They would leave one man
open, but he would be short of the first down."
More frustrating were the plays that
didn't happen. Close to 10 of Palmer's
passes were dropped.
"I'm really disappointed in that," USC
coach Pete Carroll said. "It was a big factor
for us offensively because we had to make
some plays throwing the ball down the field
and it was there for us and we just didn't han
dle the ball well."
Palmer attributed the problems with the
passing game to t he strong wind that persist
ed throughout the game.
"It's tough to throw deep balls when the
wind is in your face or behind your back," he

said. "It was a factor with the dropped balls
because the ball moved so much in the air."
On the Trojans' first possession of the fourth
quarter, they readied Wildcat territory in two
plays. Then they displayed a pathetic inefficien
cy that characterized the type of game they were
having. Palmer dropped back and launched a
pass clown the sideline, leading a sprinting wide
receiver Kareem Kelly, but it was too long. The
next play he sought receiver Keary Colbert on
the other side, but overthrew him.
On third down, Palmer took a three-step
drop and found Kelly on a quick out, but
Kelly's foot landed out of bounds. On a cru
cial fourth and 10, Palmer led receiver
Malaefou MacKenzie on a fade pass with a
perfectly thrown ball in between two defend
ers, but the ball squirmed out of his grasp
when his body met the ground after he dove
for the ball.
Kelly said the game was a learning experi
ence.
"They were a good secondary, but at the
same time it was nothing that we couldn't han
dle," Colbert said. "We didn't come out and ex
ecute our offense."
