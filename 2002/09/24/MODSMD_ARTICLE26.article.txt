# Ducks' Smith works for Heisman alone
## 
### ADAM JUDE OREGON DAILY EMERALD 
(U-WIRE) EUGENE, Ore. â€” One year ago,
a Joey Harrington billboard greeted visitors in
Manhattan, a quarter-million-dollar promo
tion of the Oregon quarterback's Heisman
Trophy campaign.
This year, the Pacific-10 Conference's poster
boy is Washington State quarterback Jason
Gesser, whose 25-foot poster in Dusty, Wash,
(pop. 10), was hoisted in jest of the Ducks' East
Coast campaign. Despite the joke, Gesser has
still received national attention.
All the while, the Ducks tailback Onterrio
Smith has shied away from the camera. Smith is
undoubtedly one of the elite ball-carriers in col
lege football, but he has yet to receive a promo
tional nod from his own program. Hence, Ore
gon's return to New York this year in the form
of a Keenan Howry billboard.
"Onterrio's the type of person that creates
his own hype," Oregon safety Keith Lewis
said. "He doesn't care about the billboards
and all those things. All he cares about is wins
and producing."
Through three games this season, Smith

has done nothing but produce. The Sacra
mento native scored three times against
Idaho en route to a 104-yard performance on
just 18 carries.
In a 28-24 come-from-behind win over Fres
no State on Sept. 7, Smith took every Oregon
handoff and rushed for 124 yards for the sec
ond straight week. He also scored two fourth
quarter touchdowns, including the game win
ner in the final minutes.
"I think I could handle it every week if it
were necessary," Smith said of his 34 carries.
"(Against Fresno State) it was necessary, so I
had to do what I had to do for the team."
While Oregon head coach Mike Bellotti said
he was impressed with Smith's performance
against Fresno State, he doesn't want his star
running back to have to carry all of the load.
"He's a very strong, very durable back who
wants to be in the game. And obviously we want
him in the game when the game's on the line,"
Bellotti said.
"I don't want him running the ball 34 or 35
times a game because he's also blocking on
passing plays. We've talked about getting the
other guys in there. I was frustrated we did
not do that earlier in the game, and that will

not happen again."
Even without 30-plus touches a game, Smith
could become the first Heisman Trophy win
ner from the Pac-10 since 1981, when Southern
California's Marcus Allen won the award.
If Smith is going to win, he'll have to do it with
out much promotion.
"He's going to take care of that himself," Bel
lotti said. "If he continues to play well, the mar
keting will come.
"I think the marketing for Joey last year was
a combination of things designed to acquaint
the world with the Oregon football program. I
think they're acquainted now. Onterrio and
Joey both will earn the right (to qualify for the
Heisman) on the field, and Joey did that."
Harrington became the first Duck to be a fi
nalist for college football's most prestigious
award after leading Oregon to an 11-1 season
in 2001. To get to New York for the I leisman
presentation, Smith may have to produce near
ly the same results this year.
"He's going to have to carry the load," Lewis
said. "He's going to come at you with every
thing he has. He gives you everything he has
every time he touches the ball.
"He never says 'mercy.' "
