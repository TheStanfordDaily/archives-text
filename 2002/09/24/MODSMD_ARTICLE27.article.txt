# Alabama soccer is good, and Jackson State is really, really bad

### DREW CHAMPLIN THE CRIMSON WHITE 
(U-WIRE) TUSCALX)OSA, Ala.
— Alabama soccer coach Don Sta
ley wanted his team to get in a
good day of practice on Sunday.
What he got was an old-fashioned
drubbing of a first-year soccer
team, as the Fide (7-1) broke eight
school records in a 20-0 win over
Jackson State.
However, the result is not what
Staley wanted. He wanted to
schedule an exhibition game
against Tide alumni, but couldn't
get out of the contract that they
had with Jackson State. He even
offered to play them on their home
turf next season.
"I did not want to play this
game," Staley said. "We would
have gotten a lot more out of play
ing an alumni game, but they in
sisted on playing the game, and a
contract's a contract."
Right now Jackson State might
be wishing they had backed out of
the contract, but the blowout is
nothing new to the team. Al

though 20 points is their largest
margin of defeat, the Tigers have
also lost games by 18-0 and 13-0
margins. In five games, the Tigers
have been outscored 66-0.
Dawn Nash's goal in the
fourth minute got things started
for the Tide. It didn't stop until
Kylie Boyd knocked in her first
career goal in the 85th minute.
All in all, 12 different players
scored goals for the Tide. Katie
French scored five goals, break
ing the record originally set by
Barclay Kercher in 1988 against
Millsaps College.
"I'm flattered," said French,
who scored all live of her goals in
only 32 minutes of action. "It feels
great. I'm glad we scored a lot of
goals."
French's live goals gave her a
team-leading eight on the season.
In the game, Cally Morrill, Libby
Probst, Elizabeth Jannik, and
Michele Evans each scored two
goals. Also scoring goals for the
Tide were Nash, Rebecca Baker,
Kim Zarzour, Missy Keller, Katie
Holtzapfel, Jeanette Browning,

and Boyd.
"We usually stop at nine
[goals]," Staley said. "But it's diffi
cult to tell your kids not to score
goals. It would have been more
disrespectful to just pass the ball
around and have [Jackson St.]
chase it."
The Tide played most of the
second half with only eight players
on the field, but were still able to
keep the ball on offense for nearly
the whole half.
The win for the Tide was the
second of the weekend, as they
had a much tougher challenge
Friday night against UAB. Down
1-0 with 16 minutes left in the
match, the Tide scored three
goals in just over four minutes. A
late goal by UAB kept it close, but
the Tide snuck away with a 3-2
win. French had two goals, in
cluding a penalty kick, and Nash
also added a goal.
"It was a game of two halves,"
Staley said. "We showed beautiful
skill, great determination, and dif
ferent people stepped up. It was
an exciting night of soccer."
