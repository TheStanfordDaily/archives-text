# Dillingham makes the best of second stint as Irish QB
## 
### ANDREW SOUKUP THE OBSERVER 
(U-WIRE) EAS T LANSING, Mich. —The first
game Pat Dillingham played as a Notre Dame
quarterback, the public address announcer at Gi
ants Stadium introduced him as Jason Beckstrom,
an injured defensive back who wore the same No.
9 jersey as Notre Dame's backup quarterback. Al
though he was happy to get on the field, Dilling
ham handed the ball off 10 consecutive times in
garbage time against Maryland and became the
butt of teammates'jokes for the P.A.'s gaffe.
The second game Dillingham played as
Irish quarterback, he threw a 60-yard game
winning touchdown with 1:15 left in the game.
This time, teammates laughed with him in
stead of at him.
"You have to be surprised by his play," Irish head
coach Tyrone Willingham said. "You worry about
backups coming into a game like that into a pressur
ized situation... I think he was amazingly poised and
in control of his game."
When a horde of Spartan players buried Carlyle
Holiday on the Michigan Suite sideline late in the
third quarter, knocking him out the game with a
shoulder injury, Dillingham pulled on his helmet,
grabbed a football and started throwing passes to
teammates even as roars reverberated throughout
Spartan Stadium.
Holiday's injury gave Dillingham the chance he
had been waiting over a year for. He came to Notre
Dame only because former offensive coordinator
Kevin Rogers invited the California quarterback to
take an official visit — the only school to do so.
Dillingham figured he was going to stay on the scout
team the rest of his college career.
But after Jared Clark switched to tight end and
Matt LoVecchio transferred to Indiana, Dillingham
became Notre Dame's backup by default and had a
scholarship to show for it.
Saturday, the "one-hit away" mantra Dillingham
kept repeating to himself became reality. As train
ers started slapping ice packs on Holiday's shoul
der, the former walk-on jogged onto the field and
into the spotlight.
At first, Dillingham certainly looked like a for
mer walk-on. Shaken by the speed of college pass
rushes, his first pass attempt sailed far over 6-foot
-5 Maurice Stovall's head. His third pass looked less
like a throw and more like a punt as the Spartans
intercepted the ball at their own 3-yard line.
"I can't repeat [what I said after that throw]," YVill

ingham said.
Yet his teammates continued to encourage
him. Willingham made sure the Irish called plays
Dillingham felt comfortable running. Holiday
pulled Dillingham aside after each drive and an
swered questions. Notre Dame's veteran offen
sive linemen helped keep the sophomore's confi
dence high.
So when Charles Rogers hauled in a touchdown
pass with less than two minutes left to give the Spar
tans a 17-14 lead, Dillingham remained poised its he
stepped under center, 72 yards away from the end
zone. If Notre Dame was to beat Michigan State, its
hopes lay in the hands of a former walk-on who
didn't receive a single Division I scholarship offer out
of high school.
"You try to do some things in practice that put
him under pressure situations," offensive coordina
tor Bill Diedrick said. "But until you get into that sit
uation, and especially the way the emotions and the
momentum of the game were going, it was a very dif
ficult situation."
How many times Dillingham ran the two-minute
drill in practice is debatable. Willingham said "almost
next to nothing." Diedrick said a quarter of the time.
Dillingham said he split reps with Holiday evenly.
But what isn't debatable is Dillingham's com
posure when the Irish needed it most. He calm
ly started the drive with a pass to Gary Godsey
and threw a dart at Stovall that drew a pass in
terference call. Two plays later, in a manner
worthy of Joe Montana and Kris Haines, Dilling
ham noticed Battle adjust his route across the
middle of the field, rifled a 10-yard bullet in his
direction and watched Battle race 50 more yards
for the score.
Just like that, the unknown backup had become
the improbable hero.
"If you asked me last year, if I was going to be
standing at this podium, I'd probably have to say
no," Dillingham said.
Nor could Dillingham have imagined fans would
scream his name as he tried to answer questions after
the game or television cameras would surround him
as he celebrated. In fact, he didn't even know if peo
ple on campus knew his name before he threw the
pass that preserved Notre Dame's perfect record.
At least he knows he isn't going to be mistaken for
a defensive back anytime soon.
"I know his girlfriend is going to like him a whole
lot more right now," Holiday joked after the game,
his arm in a sling, his return uncertain. "He's the
man right now."
