# Council to vote on Sand Hill plan
## Menlo Park to decide on Stanford's bid to widen Sand Hill Road 
### ALEX BLEYLEBEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
The long-running controversy
over the widening of a stretch of
Sand Hill Road over San Francis
quito Creek will enter another
stage tonight as the Menlo Park
City Council votes 011 an agree
ment negotiated with the Univer
sity in August.
Although the Sand Hill modifi
cations were originally approved
in August, many locals have
stepped forward to question the
University's inclusion of a hiking
trail alongside the improved road,
maintaining that this provision
was not adequately explored be
fore the agreement was reached.
The latest proposal by Stanford
calls for Sand Hill Road to be
widened and for two congested in
tersections to be improved. Sand
Hill Road carries traffic 011 four
lanes except fora small stretch
over San Francisquito Creek,
where it narrows to only two lanes.
The proposal would widen this
section to four lanes.
The project would also im
prove traffic through the intersec
tion of Santa Cruz Avenue and
Sand Hill Road and the intersec
tion ofjunipero Sen a Boulevard
and Alpine Road.
Stanford is strongly pushing
for the improvements to amelio
rate these "under-functioning in

tersections" and the "tremendous
bottleneck" where the road nar
rows, according to Larry Horton,
director of government and com
munity relations.
Stanford has agreed to foot the
bill for the construction, currently
estimated at $12.5 million,- and
will oversee its completion. While
Menlo Park is generally in favor of
the road improvements, commu
nity dissent has simmered over a

16-foot trail alongside it.
Concerns have been raised 011
three fronts: environmental is
sues, effects on the famed Stanford
golf course, and issues concerning
the dispute over the General Use
Permit, which Stanford entered
into last year.
Environmentalists are calling
fora study on the trail to deter
mine what impact it may have 011
important environmental habitats

and 011 what has been called "an
archeologically sensitive area," ac
cording to Menlo Park's City At
torney Bill McClure.
Stanford officials maintain that
neither environmental nor arche
ological concerns — the latter of
which reportedly concern Native
American artifacts — are justified.

make the case for Stanford in
tonight's meeting, saying that no
archeological sites will be endan
gered by the trail.
The second area of concern
among opponents of the plan is the
Stanford golf course. The widening
of Sand Hill will require holes 3 and
4 to be re-worked.
"The 16-foot trail will encroach
25 to 50 feet into the golf course,"
McClure said.
But Stanford officials say that the
trail will have no additional effects
on the golf course from what is al
ready planned due to road im
provements.
"There's no problem there,"
said Horton, who added that if the
trail is not put in now, then a future
trail on the site might force addi
tional complications with the golf
course.
"We want to have certainty
about the golf course," he added.
"We don't want there to be an addi
tional trail later."
The final objection that will be
raised in tonight's council meeting
is that Stanford may be using the
trail to skirt a different controver
sy involving the General Use Per
mit. The GUP requires the Uni
versity to dedicate two trails on its
lands. The proposed alignment of
one of the trails runs along the
stretch of Sand Hill that is to be
improved. However, many envi
ronmentalists stiffly oppose this
proposed path.
