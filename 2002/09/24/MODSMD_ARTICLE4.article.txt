# Blood Center launches contest to attract new blood
## 
### MARK DOMINIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
This fall the Stanford Blood Center is blood
thirsty. Recent declines in blood donations at
Stanford have prompted the center to an
nounce two new programs to increase dona
tions on campus.
One program, "Crimson Donors," rewards
students who donate three or more times a year
with a free t-shirt. The odier is a dorm-based
contest the center is launching this fall. The
center hopes that these programs will raise
awareness of the need for regular bkx>d dona
tions on campus.
Although blood donations increased in the
weeks following Sept. 11 last year, the pattern
of decreasing campus participation resumed
after the initial surge.
"There was a spike in donations in the days
and weeks following Sept. 11 â€” we had too
much, and then we had none. Our goal is to get
the message out that it is important to donate
consistently," said Jennifer Reczkowski, center
recruitment consultant for the Stanford Blood
Center.
"You are eligible to donate every 56 days,"
she continued.
Over the past decade, the Stanford commu
nity has seen dramatic declines in donation
rates, according to Doreen Leith, mobile re
cruitment supervisor for the Stanford Bkxxl
Center.
"Ten years ago, we would get 140 units
out of a dorm we only get 100 out of today,"
Leith said.
Blood is critical to maintaining high-quality
care at the Stanford Medical Center and other
area hospitals. And demand for blood at the
campus hospital is increasing.
"Without blood, the Stanford hospital just
can't do anything. Demand for bkxxl at the
Stanford hospital and the [Lucille Packard]
Children's Hospital has gone up 10 percent in
the past year," Leith said.
About 10 percent of Stanford students do
nate blocxl. The bkxxl center's goal is to get 20
percent of students in each dorm to donate, ac
cording to Reczkowski.
"We're initiating this campaign in order to

encourage Stanford students to donate blood,"
Reczkowski said. "We will visit lcx:ations around
campus to get donations."
The proposal was presented to resident as
sistants at the RA activities fair in order to gath
er support. The first blocxl drive will take place
on Oct. 14.
"Students will be able to sign in and write
down where they live at the bloodmobile,"
Reczkowski said.
Leith said " The winning dorm will be deter

mined percentage-wise."
The prize for the winning dorm is yet to be
determined, but Reczkowski said that the cen
ter was thin king of something along the lines of
a {(X)shall table.
"We want to give the dorm something that
students can carve their names into for poster
ity because some students who donated won't
be living in that same dorm the next quarter,"
she said.
But Reczkowski stressed that the important

thing about the contest isn't the prize.
" This is the kind of competition that every
one wins," she said.
Leith said that the contest aims to reach out
to those who have never donated bkxxl before.
"A lot of people who have never donated lx'-
fore say that they never donated because no-
Ixxly ever asked them," Leith said.
"Giving blood saves lives. Without it, people
will die. We can't make bkxxl in a test tube.
I hat is why we need people to donate."

This fall the Stanford Blood Center's bloodmobile will travel to seven different locations to collect blood from students. The center hopes to raise
awareness of the critical need of blood by promoting a dorm-based blood donation contest this year.
