California State Assemblyman
Joe Simitian (D-Palo Alto) is en
couraging members of his 21st As
sembly District to take the law into
their own hands by submitting
ideas for new legislation.
Simitian's "There Oughta Be a
Law" contest gives residents of
Palo Alto, Stanford and the sur
rounding area the opportunity to
see their proposed bills come be
fore the state assembly and
maybe even become state law. Of
last year's three winning entries,
one has already become law, and
the other two are currently await
ing signature on the desk of Gov.
Gray Davis.
"It's a nice example of how peo
ple can participate in the process
directly and have an impact,"
Simitian said.
According to Simitian, the idea
for the contest sprang from a dis
cussion with his staff about ways to
get constituents more involved in
legislative matters.
"1 thought, 'there's got to be a
way to involve my constituents di
rectly in terms of my legislative
agenda,'" Simitian said. "Some
one suggested sending out an an
nouncement, but we concluded
that it would probably end up in
(he wastebasket.
