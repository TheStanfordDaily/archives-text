# Good law? Bad law? You decide
## Contest lets voters change state law 
### WILL OREMUS EDITORIAL STAFF 
California State Assemblyman
Joe Simitian (D-Palo Alto) is en
couraging members of his 21st As
sembly District to take the law into
their own hands by submitting
ideas for new legislation.
Simitian's "There Oughta Be a
Law" contest gives residents of
Palo Alto, Stanford and the sur
rounding area the opportunity to
see their proposed bills come be
fore the state assembly and
maybe even become state law. Of
last year's three winning entries,
one has already become law, and
the other two are currently await
ing signature on the desk of Gov.
Gray Davis.
"It's a nice example of how peo
ple can participate in the process
directly and have an impact,"
Simitian said.
According to Simitian, the idea
for the contest sprang from a dis
cussion with his staff about ways to
get constituents more involved in
legislative matters.
"1 thought, 'there's got to be a
way to involve my constituents di
rectly in terms of my legislative
agenda,'" Simitian said. "Some
one suggested sending out an an
nouncement, but we concluded
that it would probably end up in
(he wastebasket.
When Simitian tossed out the idea of holding a
contest, "everybody sort of looked at me," he re
called with a laugh.
But last year's inaugural contest became an un
qualified success.
"We had 100 proposals that first year, even
though we were just feeling our way. And they
were extraordinarily well thought-out."
Winning proposals included a restriction on
the use of pesticides instate buildings, a require
ment that bankrupt companies honor gift certifi
cates, and a stipulation that pesticides include a
bittering agent to offset the attractive taste and
smell of the toxic fluid.
Andrea Leiderman, one of last year's winners,
praised the contest as "a great example of democ
racy in action."
"Last year I entered Assemblyman Simitian's
contest thinking I never had a chance of seeing my
idea become law," Leiderman said. "Here we are
less than a year later, and my bill is sitting on the
governor's desk. It's nice to know one person can
still make a difference."
This year, the contest will be merged with a sec

ond competition that Simitian conducted last
year, called " This One's Got To Go." Contestants
are asked to suggest the repeal of a state law that is
inappropriate or has outgrown its use.
Simitian said proposals needn't be overly
complex or include a detailed plan for imple
mentation.
"That's my job," he explained.
While "most of [last year's entries] were quite
serious," Simitian said the most amusing was"the
fellow who wanted to outlaw the annoying adver
tisement strips in the comics every Sunday."
Simitian said he hopes more Stanford students
will submit entries this year.
"We particularly encourage people who live
and work in the 21st assembly district, which in
cludes Stanford," he said.
The remarkable success of last year's proposals
in reaching the governor's desk has earned Simit
ian a few jibes from his colleagues.
"My staff teases me that my constituents are bat
ting 1.000, and my own ideas have not always
fared as well," he quipped.
Joking aside, Simitian said he is happy with the
response to the contest thus far.
"What I was struggling to do was to find a way
to let people know that they are an integral part of
the process, and they can participate directly, and
that's what the contest has done."
