## 
### 
Some contend that by building
a trail along with the Sand Hill
project, Stanford is trying to fulfill
the requirements in the GUP with
out having to haggle further with
opponents in the community.
The University is adamant that
it will only pay for the improve
ments if it is allowed to include a

trail on the side of Sand Hill, coun
tering a Menlo Park City Council
that seems to be in favor of drop
ping the trail from plans. In yes
terday's San Jose Mercury News,
Menlo Park Mayor Steven
Schmidt indicated that the plan
would probably pass if proposed
without the trail.

Stanford has ruled out a com
promise on the issue, saying that
the trail has always been a part of
the plan, and that is important for
the future demands of the area.
The University will take its case be
fore the council tonight at 7:30
p.m. at Menlo Park's Council
Chambers on 801 Laurel St.
