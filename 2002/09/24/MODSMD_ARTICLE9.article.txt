## Bush administration criticizes Israeli siege on Arafat 
### 
RAMALLAI I, West Bank (AP) — A de
fiant Yasser Arafat dug in at his besieged
compound yesterday, rejecting Israel's
demand to hand over the names of all
those holed up inside. The Bush adminis
tration called for an end to the siege in
sharp criticism of Israel.
Violence erupted elsewhere early today
as Israeli tanks backed by helicopters
stormed into Gaza City and battled Pales
tinian gunmen in clashes that left nine
Palestinians dead and 24 injured, hospital
officials said.
The tanks penetrated a half mile into
Gaza City in one of the most violent incur
sions in the city. The army confirmed that
a military operation was under way in
Gaza and said no soldiers had been in
jured, but declined to comment further.
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said
earlier Monday that Israel would mount a
military operation in Gaza against Hamas,
which the Jewish state blames for carrying
out attacks against Israelis.
"Gaza serves as a center for Hamas,"
Sharon said, adding Israel would "strike
Hamas and prevent its ability to act."
For the first time since Israeli tanks
crashed into the compound on Thursday
— retaliating fora Palestinian suicide
bombing in Tel Aviv that killed six by
standers — Israeli military officials and
Palestinian leaders met yesterday to begin
feeling their way to a solution of the latest
crisis, but no progress was reported.
As Israeli troops settled in around
Arafat's compound, criticism of the third
blockade in 10 months intensified in Israel
and around tfie world.
The government's detractors in Is
raeli said Sharon was boosting Arafat's
popularity.
At the U.N. Security Council in New
York, the United States proposed a reso
lution calling for an end to the siege along
with punishment of the plotters of Pales
tinian suicide bombings.
In Washington, statements issued by
White House and State Department offi
cials said Israel's siege had "aggravated"

U.S. efforts to improve security and re
form the Palestinian leadership.
On the West Bank, an Israeli man was
killed and three of his children, ages 9, 12
and 18, were wounded in a Palestinian
shooting attack in the West Bank city of
Hebron. The 9-year-old was in serious
condition, hospital officials said.
The assault on Arafat's office has made
an already tense situation even more
volatile. With Arafat and 200 aides and se
curity guards ringed by troops and con
fined to a building Palestinians claim is in
danger of collapse, Israel cannot guaran
tee the Palestinian leader's safety. Harm to
Arafat, even unintentional, could ignite
the region.
Arafat's isolation has already triggered
mass street protests, some orchestrated
and some spontaneous, in a replay of the
scenes that marked the beginning of fight
ing two years ago.
Yesterday, Palestinians rallying around
Arafat observed a commercial strike and
burned tires and pelted soldiers with rocks
— events rarely seen in recent months.
About 10,000 rallied in Gaza, many of
them school children bused in for the
demonstration.
Early today, more than 1,000 Palestini
ans returned to the streets of Ramallah to
support Arafat.
Israel is demanding that all the men in
Arafat's office building surrender for ques
tioning. Israel originally said 19 terror sus
pects were inside the building, including
Tawfik Tirawi, the Palestinian intelligence
chief.
"Israel's stand is clear," Sharon said yes
terday. "Those terrorists must surrender
to us. We will not compromise on this."
Arafat flatly rejected the Israeli demand
fora list of names ofall the men in the com
pound, said Palestinian Cabinet Minister
Saeb Erekat, who met Israeli military offi
cials at the Beit El military base, an Israeli
outpost next to Ramallah.
"We told them (the Israelis) that this is
none of their business, and we called for an
immediate and unconditional withdrawal

from President Arafat's office, and an end
to the siege," Erekat told The Associated
Press. It was the first face-to-face en
counter since the siege began.
Erekat said the building where Arafat is
staying is in clanger of collapse. Arafat and
aides were crammed into four rooms on
the second floor of one wing after a tank

shell destroyed the stairs to the third floor.
It's the only one left intact after Israeli bull
dozers and bombs flattened most of the
others. Yesterday, tanks maintained a
tight siege. Israeli troops briefly planted
an Israeli flagon the compound, but it was
removed over the weekend.
Last week, Israel's Cabinet voted down a

proposal, backed by Sharon, to expel Arafat.
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres is
among those who oppose expulsion, but
said yesterday that Arafat is either incapable
or unwilling to stop attacks on Israel. The
Palestinian leadership should "prove its ca
pability to rule, or it should appoint those
who can rule," Peres told Israel TV.
