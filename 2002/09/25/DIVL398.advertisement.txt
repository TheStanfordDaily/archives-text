Dear Senior Class of 2003,
Get ready for your best year in college! One of the most important aspects of senior year is com
mencement. As seniors, we have the opportunity to influence the speaker selection process.
While President Hennessy ultimately has the responsibility of selecting and inviting the speaker, the
selection will be guided under close consultation by the Senior Class through your Senior Class
Presidents.
As the Senior Class of 2003, our role in the commencement selection process is to generate nomina
tions, while maintaining realistic expectations. In order for the opinions of the Senior Class to be a
part of the speaker selection process, we will compile a list of potential speakers to give to President
Hennessy. These nominations will come directly from you. We will facilitate this process by taking
nominations online at http://classof2oo3.stanford.edu. Seniors will be able view the nominations at
this site.
However, we must be realistic and optimistic about expectations on the commencement speaker nom
ination. While it is an honor to speak at commencement, a number of factors play a role in determin
ing whether our invitation will be accepted including the person s connection to Stanford, their
schedule, and the distance necessary to travel. It is not uncommon for an invitation to be declined.
To preserve the confidentiality of the process, President Hennessy will not reveal the names or the
rank of the individuals who have been sent official invitations to speak. While working with President
Hennessy, we will do our best to secure someone high on the class's list. We will update you through
out the process.
We are seeking a speaker whose accomplishments, experiences, and influence in the world give him or
her a distinctive point of view from which to provide a unique perspective about issues of importance.
We seek someone who can speak to a broad audience including both undergraduate and graduate stu
dents. Further we are looking for someone with a message to inspire the entire Stanford community.
In order to increase our chances of getting our most desired speaker, the nomination process for com
mencement speaker begins today. Please visit http://classof2oo3.stanford.edu to nominate speakers.
The nomination period will end on Friday, October 11th. With your input, we will do our best to
bring a speaker that the senior class will be proud to have delivering the commencement address.
All the best fora great senior year,
James Alva
