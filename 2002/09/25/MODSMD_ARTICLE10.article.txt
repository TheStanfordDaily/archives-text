GANDHINAGAR, India (AP) — Attackers
sprayed gunfire through a temple crowded
with Hindu worshippers yesterday, killing at
least 30 people and fueling fears of new rioting
in western India, where vicious religious
clashes between Muslims and Hindus killed
1,000 people earlier this year.
Hours after the attack, the gunmen re
mained in control of part of the Swami
narayan temple complex — and some wor
shippers were still inside, officials said. Bloody
bodies were carried away on stretchers and
many wounded limped out, their clothes
stained with blood. About 45 people were
wounded.
I lundreds of commandos swarmed into the
sprawling temple complex after the attackers
stormed in, setting up positions around the
main temple, said R.B. Brahmabhatt, the city's
acting police chief.
A senior police official inside the com

plex, speaking on his mobile phone, said be
tween 40 and 50 people had been taken
hostage.
Deputy Prime Minister Lai K. Advani,
speaking to reporters in New Delhi, described
the shooting as a suicide attack. He said the at
tackers, armed with hand grenades and AK
-47 rifles, had taken up positions on the roof of
a building inside the complex.
Hospital officials said 30 people were dead,
including at least six women and four chil
dren. The wounded included five police offi
cers who were hit by bullets.
"The terrorists are still inside," Advani said.
He said 500 people had been evacuated from
the complex.
Advani said the attack appeared tied to
state elections being held yesterday in north
ern Jammu-Kashmir state, the only majority
Muslim state in largely Hindu India.
While no group immediately claimed re

sponsibility for the attack, and government of
ficials were careful not to make accusations,
fears spread across western Gujarat state that
Islamic rebels would be blamed — which
could set off anti-Muslim mob violence and
spiral into widespread sectarian unrest.
Gujarat witnessed vicious religious rioting
in late February, when a Muslim mob set fire
to a train carrying 1 lindu activists. That attack
set off a wave of reprisal killings and rioting in
which Muslims were the main victims. In total,
about 1,000 people were killed, according to
government estimates.
In New Delhi, the imam of the country's
largest mosque called the attack "anti-Islamic."
"Islam does not permit the killing of inno
cent civilians. I appeal to Muslims and our
I lindu brethren to join hands to wipe out ter
rorism," Syed Ahmed Bukhari was quoted as
saying by the Press Trust of India news
agency.
