# Dow Jones hits four-year low
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Wall
Street's malaise deepened yes
terday, with stocks falling on a
continence of factors that in
cluded disappointing earnings
news and a criminal investiga
tion into Xerox's accounting
practices. The Dow Jones in
dustrials dropped nearly 190
points to hit a four-year low.
Growing concerns about a
possible war with Iraq exacer
bated the selling. There was lit
tle reaction to the Federal Re
serve's decision to leave rates
unchanged.
The Dow fell 189.02, or 2.4
percent, to close at 7,683.13.
The blue chips registered their
fourth triple-digit loss in six ses
sions, falling to their lowest
close since Oct. I, 1998, when
they stood at 7,632.50.
The Dow also broke through
its July 23 low of 7,702.34.
The broader market also fin
ished lower. The Nasdaq com
posite index dropped 2.76, or
0.2 percent, to 1.182.17, reach
ing another six-year low. The
Standard & Poor's 500 index
was down 14.41, or 1.7 percent,
at 819.29.
The Fed's Open Market
Committee chose to leave rates
at 40-year lows at its meeting
Tuesday, saying consumer and
business demand is "growing at
a moderate pace." But it also
noted that considerable uncer
tainty remains about the timing
and strength of an economic re

covery, partly because of in
creased tensions about Iraq and
terrorism.
Investors have been focused
on the strength of the recovery
and had little optimism before
the Fed's meeting. In the past
month, investors have punished
stocks on a spate of mixed eco
nomic news, earnings warnings
and concerns about a war with
Iraq.
"A lot of the reason the mar
ket has been stumbling is be
cause the outlook for growth
and earnings was deteriorating.
Then you have the Fed come in
and say, 'Oh, we're not going to
do anything about it,"' said Jef
frey Applegate, chief investment
strategist at Lehman Brothers.
Tech stocks managed to fare
better than blue chips.
Decliners included Xerox,
which fell 71 cents to $5.96 after
the company said federal prose
cutors were opening a criminal
inquiry into the company's ac
counting practices.
The airline sector also took a
hit. UAL's United Airlines fell
22 cents to $2.12, while AMR
Corp.'s American Airlines
dropped 62 cents to $3.60.
Overseas, Japan's Nikkei
stock average finished lower 1.7
percent. In Europe, France's
CAC-40 fell 1.8 percent,
Britain's FTSE 100 declined 1.8
percent, and in late afternoon
trading, Germany's DAX index
was down 1.4 percent.
