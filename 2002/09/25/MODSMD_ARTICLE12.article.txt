## The 						Stanford Daily Subjectivity leads to a weakened ranking system 
### 
Published Since 1891

What does Stanford have in
common with MIT? Not
much, many would argue.
But in the U.S. News and
World Report's most recent college rank
ings, those two universities tied for fourth
place, along with Duke, Cal Tech and the
University of Pennsylvania.
This may well be a valid measure of the
colleges' respective performances last year,
but we worry that the tie between such dif
ferent schools may also point to shortcom
ings in the ranking system.
The magazine's intentions seem some
what legitimate — to provide the public
with a loose guide by which to compare
universities' performance. And the listing
of information about individual universi-

ties, from acceptance rates to financial re
sources, is helpful.
However, to quantitatively rank overall
quality is impossible — an attempt compa
rable to lining up apples, oranges, bananas
and pears, and asking: Which is best?
It seems that the magazine realizes this,
judging from the highly subjective method
by which rankings are issued.
The main factor in determining a uni
versity's total score comes from what offi
cials call "peer assessment" — that is, ad
ministrators at each university score other
institutions' academic quality on a scale of
one to five.
Though peer review is vital to aca
demic discourse, we have reservations
about its appropriateness in this case.

Namely, we question how impartial an
official can be when asked to judge its
own competition.
The intense rivalry between universi
ties vying to impress applicants — not to
mention potential faculty, donors and
the public — is no secret.
Especially in light of the high-profile
incident last year in which a Princeton
admissions official was caught spying on
the university's rival, Yale, it seems fool
hardy to give universities such influence
on their competitors' scores.
Perhaps most troubling is that despite
the rankings' obvious shortcomings, they
continue to exert tremendous influence
on applicants, alumni, donors and univer
sities themselves.

This editorial represents the views of the members of The Daily's editorial board. The board consists of The Daily's editor in chief, managing editor for special sections and two opinions
editors. Signed columns and contributions are the view of the writer and do not necessarily represent the view of the editorial board.

And the consequences can be damag
ing: Programs lose funding; universities
lose prestige.
And students lose, too, by overlooking
schools that could be a perfect match for
them, ranking notwithstanding.
Though we think that the rankings pro
vide a good reference for comparison, we
caution applicants to look beyond a univer
sity's rank in determining where to apply.
Stanford and MIT may share similar
reputations among academics, but until
U.S. News 8c World Report can quantify
the joy of a perfect paper-airplane flight
through MemAud or the dirty exhilara
tion of Full Moon on the Quad, we urge
prospective students to exercise their own,
subjective judgment.
