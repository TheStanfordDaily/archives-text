Stanford Blood Center's refusal to ac
cept donations from healthy gay men is
"unfair and homophobic"
Your article about the Stanford Blood
Center ("Blood Center launches contest to
attract new blood," Sept. 24) failed to ad
dress the Center's policy of refusing blood
donations from gay men. The Center does
not accept donations from men who have
had sexual contact with other men at any
time since 1977.
Not only is this policy unfair and ho
mophobic, it is also highly impractical, as
there are many healthy gay and bisexual
men at Stanford who would be happy to
help by donating blood.
The Daily has printed what is essential
ly a front-page advertisement for blood
donations without even mentioning the
discriminatory practice of turning away
potential donors because they are gay.

Monitoring for anti-Israeli sentiment is
"frightening"
Your article on Monday ("Think tank
cites Stanford, UC-Berkeley for anti-Israel
bias," Sept. 23) about Stanford and other
universities being monitored for anti-Is
raeli sentiment was frightening.

I'm not an American (I have just ar
rived here from the U K) so am not quite
accustomed to this sort of and / non-Is
raeli stance, so the question I have is
were these institutions, and all other
similar ones, monitored for anti-Pales
tinian sentiment?
Any war, or political unrest, will almost
certainly force people to take sides.
In fact, since all media sources have
human involvement, they are therefore
biased to the viewpoint of the authors
(however unintentionally), the readers/
viewers will rarely see the situation from
both sides (and consequently gain a biased
understanding of the situation).
I think the situation in the Middle
East between Palestinians and Israelis is
terrible, and any loss of life on either side
is very regrettable.
Like many people, I wish this problem
could be solved immediately, but unfortu
nately the stance taken by many external
governments (including the British) does
not seem to have been fair or helpful to re
solving the conflict.
This monitoring body mentioned in
the article sounds to me as if it is prolif
erating a bias which may well lead to this
conflict lasting well into the foreseeable
future, and many more innocent civil
ians dying.
