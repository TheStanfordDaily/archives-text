# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## A cooperative Iraq leaves George W. feeling dissatisfied
### STEPHEN ELLIOT GUEST COLUMNIST 
1 woke up this morning witli a pro
found respect lor George Bush.
It hurt, I had an itch in my lower back,
and my right hand was numb. I thought I
must have had too much to drink last
night or perhaps not enough.
But it was true. George Bush, like a
true school yard bully, had gotten what
he wanted, unconditional weapon in
spections in Iraq. He did it through in
transigence.
He achieved that only because he is
the head of a war hawk administration
hell bent on bombing Baghdad to rub
ble, and the rest of the world believes he
is ready to do it.
A more reasonable person would never
have gotten a concession like that from
Saddam I lussein.
And so, I thought, "Wow, it worked.
We won." George Bush will go clown as
a foreign policy genius. Who would
have thought?

Unfortunately, it's not true. Because
the reason Saddam backed down, and
the United Nations backed down is the
same reason it will never be enough.
It's like the biggest kid at school. He de
mands your lunch money. "Give me your
lunch money," he says. "Then I'll leave
you alone."
Your friend whispers in your ear, "Give
him the money. Let's not have any trouble."
But it's never enough.
You've seen this kid hurt people be
fore. You know what he's capable of. And
because of that you give him the money.
You don't want him to hurt you. You
know it's not just talk with this kid. I le'san
arm breaker. Even the teachers are afraid
of him.
But it doesn't work. You give him your
lunch money, and the next day he wants
your pants.
What would Hitler's legacy be if he
had stopped right after Munich? He'd
probably be remembered as one of the
great leaders of the 20th century. But
Hitler only got the concessions at Mil

nich because lie was the kind of person
for whom no amount of concessions
would ever be enough.
So great, I think.
Weapons inspectors in Iraq. That's
fantastic. Call me a hypocrite, but I
don't want Iraq to have nuclear
weapons. I don't like Saddam. He
gassed his own people killing up to one
hundred thousand Kurds. And for all
the bad things America has done, I do
prefer that my country is stronger than
his country.
So cool, weapons inspectors, and the
United Nations takes charge. The
weapons inspectors are extraordinarily
well funded with 1 percent of all Iraqi oil
money funding their mission. In six
months Hans Blix, a man of high regard
in the international community, will give
us his report on whether or not the Iraqis
are cooperating and allowing the unlet
tered access they promised.
As a reasonable person, 1 figure even
if Iraq does not keep to its part of the
bargain, the inspectors being there

should at least slow him down enough so
that we don't have to make any rash de
cisions. Then we can make a much more
informed decision on whether or not to
invade.
And then 1 read the front page of the
New York limes: "All they've got to do is
look at his record, his latest ploy," Mr.
Bush said, urging allies of the United
States not to be lulled by Mr. I lussein's lat
est overture into backing away from pass
ing a tough United Nations resolution
forcing Iraq to disarm.
"I le's not going to fool anybody."
And then Donald Rumsfeld: "Delay
ing a vote in C Congress would send a mes
sage that the United States may be un
prepared to take a stand, just as we are
asking the international community to
take a stand." I mean, God forbid we
should leave room for interpretation.
And then Tom Daschle, the Senate's
Democratic leader, used language simi
lar lo the president's. "This is a ploy
we've seen Saddam Hussein use on
many occasions," Mr. Daschle said. "We

shouldn't be fooled by it."
Look, 1 don't trust Saddam either. But
I trust the weapons inspectors. Do we
have some reason to think they won't re
port back to us i! Iraq is not cooperating?
Is it so terrible to not go to war?
Now just a week ago, Bush was mak
ing the case that we would go in unless
Saddam readmitted the weapons inspec
tors unconditionally.
It was a gamble Bush was taking to
rally support. He was that sure that Sad
dam wouldn't buckle. But Saddam did
buckle. Which is why I woke up so
happy.
It's a shame that's not enough.
It's a shame that you can't reap the re
wards of a strong, unreasonable govern
ment and then hand the lunch money
over to someone that will put it in a con
servative treasury account.
