# Wisconsin regent calls for diversity
## 
### MICHELLE DIAMENT THE DAILY CARDINAL (U. WISCONSIN 
(U-WI RE) MADISON, Wis. â€” A University of Wis
consin System Board of Regents member said he be
lieves the board's leadership should be more diverse.
Gerard Randall Jr., who previously served as vice
president of the board, questioned the selection of
members to the board's executive committee. The
committee, which is made up of the board's various
committee chairs, is composed entirely white males
this year.
"To my mind, there should be a division of view
points, a division of geographic regions from around
the state represented, a division of those who may
have longstanding ties to particular institutions in the
UW System," he said. "1 don't see that represented
certainly on the executive committee on board."
The executive committee makes decisions when
the full board is not in session. They also are respon
sible for audit oversights and reviews.
Randall points to strong affiliations of many board
members to the U W-Madison campus as problematic.
He said he believes more emphasis should be put on
UW-Milwaukeeand other institutions in the system.
However, fellow board member and former board
president, Jay Smith disagreed. He pointed to the

Adopt-a-Campus program, which assigns each regent
two campuses to represent. He said that this ensures
that no biases toward particular campuses exist on the
board.
Smith also said that focus should be on the results
of the current board as opposed to their makeup. 1 le
said t he board, with many of the same members who
are currently serving, crafted the Plan 2008 initiative,
which outlines diversity goals for the UW System.
"[The executive committee] changes every year.
That just happens to be the circumstance at this point
in time," Smith said. "It doesn't reflect a lack of diverse
interest at all."
Tommie L. Jones, a graduate student at UW-
Oshkosh and the student member of the Board of Re
gents, said he agrees that diversity is an issue that
should be addressed in the years to come. I fowever,
he said he believes the current members of the board
"have great respect and care for the UW System."
Smith said lie is proud of the gender and racial di
versity in the UW System schools' administrations.
Women dominate leadership of the UW System, with
Katharine Lyall serving as president.
The Board of Regents includes four female mem
bers and three members of color out of 17.
"1 think as a statewide institution, we certainly
don't have the kind of race or ethnic diversity that 1
would like to see," Randall said.
