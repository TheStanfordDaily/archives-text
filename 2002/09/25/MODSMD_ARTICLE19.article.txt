### VICTORIA BARITZ WASHINGTON SQUARK NEWS (NEW YORK U 
(U-YVIRE) NEW YORK —
One thousand college students
may commit suicide this year if
campus suicide rates continue to
climb, the National Mental Health
Association said in a recent study.
For years, universities across
the country have tried to prevent
suicides among students, but as
statistics show, most have failed.
NMIIA studies show that suicide is
the second most common cause of
death for college students.
Student suicides are most likely

to occur after a disappointment or
rejection, according to statistics
compiled by the Jed Foundation.
The foundation was started by
Phillip and Donna Satow after
their son, Jed, committed suicide as
a sophomore at the University of
Arizona in 1998, to help students at
risk for committing suicide.
Stress and emerging psy
chosis are contributing factors of
college suicides, the foundation
reported.
The foundation also found
that 90 percent of all teenagers
who commit suicide have a psy
chiatric illness.
"College [students who com-

Mit! suicides are largely depressed,
quiet, socially isolated young peo
ple who do not abuse alcohol or
drugs, and who draw little atten
tion to themselves," wrote Dr. Alan
Lipschitz, a mental health expert
and the author of "College Stu
dent Suicide."
The Jed Foundation has es
tablished a Web site intended to
provide anonymous access to
mental health information for
students.
The site also allows college stu
dents to find information about
mental illness, ask questions and
make appointments with mental
health professionals.
