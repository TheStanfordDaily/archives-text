# Sand Hill Road gets green light
## 
### MARK DOMINIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
Last night, the Menlo Park City Coun
cil approved Stanford's plan to widen
Sand Hill Road, pending a report from
the city attorney addressing environ
mental and legal issues.
After nearly five hours of contentious
discussion by city council members, staff,
University officials and Menlo Park resi
dents, the board voted four-to-one in
favor of approving the widening.
"This motion really moves us further
down the road to solving this problem,"
Mayor Steve Schmidt said.
Much of the evening was spent dis
cussing a 16-foot-wide trail that will run
along the south side of Sand Hill Road,
encroaching on the Stanford Golf
Course. The course will be reconfigured
as part of the widening project, but the
trail will not require additional changes
to the course.
"We currently have four concept de
signs for the course," said Don Cheleme
dos, course general manager. "The trail

does not impact those designs."
Some local residents did not believe
the University's argument that the
course would not be harmed by the trail.
Others expressed reservations about the
trail's environmental impact.
"I have no problem with the road
widening, but the trail must be pried
loose from the agreement," said John
Nagel, a Menlo Park resident.
The Stanford Open Space Alliance
and the Committee for Green Foothills
expressed opposition to the proposed
trail. Other individuals were skeptical
that the construction of the trail — in a
location Stanford is known to favor fora
Santa Clara County-required trail —
might be a move to skirt county require
ments.
"We need to examine the trail careful
ly because the trail appears to be part of
a bigger project and may or may not im
pact the golf course," Schmidt said.
"That is significant."
Councilman Paul Collacchi also ex
pressed concern about a 200-foot ease
ment along the trail that would be ceded

to Santa Clara County by Stanford. He
directed Bill McClure, the city attorney,
to investigate this issue.
Residents were generally supportive
of the proposed widening.
"The great majority of Menlo Park
residents really want you to lix this prob
lem," said Joyce Parrel, a Menlo Park
resident. "Stanford has made a very fair
and generous offer."
Mary Gillis, a Menlo Park resident, re
ferred to the standstill gridlock on Sand
Hill Road colorfully, dubbing it "Quick
sand Road."
"I can't imagine any road more stuck
than this one," she said. "Is a pedestrian
trail more damaging than these
fumes?"
And Stanley Peters, a Menlo Park res
ident, brought up a concern which faces
many from West Menlo Park.
"Swifter access to the [Stanford] hospi
tal may save lives, as we heard from other
Menlo Park residents delayed in driving
to the hospital with seriously ill relatives."
Larry Horton, director of gov
ernment and community relations
at Stanford, spoke about his vision
for the plan as it goes ahead.

" The implementation of this
agreement will resolve one of the
most contentious and long-run
ning traffic problems in the area."
The city attorney and his staff
are set to report back to the City
Council in early November on en
vironmental and legal issues that
still must be cleared up.
