## 
### JOSHUA KARLIN-RESNICK THE DAILY FREE PRESS (BOSTON U 
(U-WIRE) BOSTON — Chancellor John Silber
defended organi/ations' rights to discriminate based
on sexual orientation and physical conditions in front
of 40 students and professors during a University
Professors freshman seminar at Boston University
Friday.
Silber also once again explained the reasons lor his
closure of the Boston University Academy (lay-
Straight Alliance and attacked the First Amendment
as it applies to radio, television and the Internet.
The two-hour lecture, entitled "Tolerance and its
Consequences," began with his reading of an ac ade
mic paper he had written about tolerance, in which he

mostly discussed the subject in abstract philosophical
terms.
Fhe last hour of the session was devoted to student
questions, during which students challenged Silber's
stances on homosexuality, the media and discrimina
tion.
During the student question-and-answer period,
Silber made the case that organizations should have
the right to discriminate based on physical traits or
sexual orientation, as long as they do not overtly per
petrate hate against those groups.
"1 think you can't exercise tolerance intelligently
without discrimination," Silber said. "II you don't dis
criminate, how are you going to decide what to toler
ate or what not to tolerate?
"If you don't tolerate the right of organizations to

have their own identity, then what you've got is just
homogeneity, and is that the only thing you can tol
erate?" he said later in the lecture.
Silber invoked his own experiences with discrimi
nation to delend his point. Silber, who was born with
only one lull arm, said the Masonic Lodge prevented
him from joining when he was a child because of a
rule against allowing membership to people with
physical deformities.
"1 never wanted to be a part of the Masonic Lodge,
and I never wanted to be a member of the DeMolay [a
social organization], but it was the going thing lor
some kids and I was told as if this was a crushing de
feat for me that 1 couldn't be a member because 1 had
one arm," he said. "What the hell — 1 don't care. I still
don't see any reason why these people can't organize

the way they want to."
Silber said the Boy Scouts, who don't allow homo
sexual scouts or scout masters, should Ik- allowed to
discriminate based on sexuality as a safety precaution.
"All you have to do is to have grown up in scouts
fora few years and gone to a scouting camp,"he
said. "You find from your own experience a scout
master or scout leader at camp who puts their arm
on some youngster or you watch some scout who
starts making a mark on some other scout. That has
happened so frequently in the history ol the scouts
that they decided there's a better way to handle that,
and that is you simply exclude persons ol that per
suasion on the grounds that if they are not included,
then you have less of a worry — you just don't have
that problem."
