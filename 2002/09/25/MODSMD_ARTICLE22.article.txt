Sunday: Stanford 7, Dartmouth 0

Rest assured that il they had the regular letter grad
ing option open to them, the members of the Stanford
men's soccer team would take it. lt'd be straight A's
across the board for the squad, which is two wins 112 rom
equaling its 9-0 start from last season.
The Cardinal men have cruised through the early
part of the year, letting in only four goals while putting
23 in the back of its opponents' cages. I hat overwhelm
ing ratio certainly has been t he key to 11 le squad's success.
Over the weekend, top-ranked Stanford collected its
sixth and seventh wins of the year by blanking Rich
mond and Dartmouth at the Dartmouth Tournament.
In its dominant 6-0 victory over hapless Rich
mond on Saturday, senior forward Roger Levesque
was the star of the show with six points off two goals

and two assists.
1 he team's leading scorer so far, Levesque has quick
ly answered all those who doubted his being able to re
turn from a nagging back injury from last season. In
seven games, Ile has already collected 18 points, includ
ing team-highs of four goals and 10 assists. He was
named the Pacific-10 Conference's Player of the Week
for the week of Sept. 10 for his early-season efforts.
Levesque made his presence known early with two
quick strikes in the 12th and 19th minutes on Saturday.
He helped the Cardinal build a comfortable 4-0 lead
with two unselfish plays to sophomore midfielder Dar
ren Fernandez and senior defender Todd Dunivant.
With a goal by senior midfielder Johanes Mali/a in
the 28th minute, the Cardinal had a commanding 5-0
lead heading into halftime, and the team went into
cruise control from then on.
Sophomore forward James Twellman scored his
second goal of the season to finish the scoring in the
63rd minute.
Dunivant also made a strong case to be picked as
man of the match with five points with his offensive play
from the backfield.
Also contributing to the shutout effort was the solid
play of senior defender Taylor Graham in the backfield.
