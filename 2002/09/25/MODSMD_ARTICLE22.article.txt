Friday: Stanford 6, Richmond 0
Sunday: Stanford 7, Dartmouth 0

Rest assured that il they had the regular letter grad
ing option open to them, the members of the Stanford
men's soccer team would take it. lt'd be straight A's
across the board for the squad, which is two wins 112 rom
equaling its 9-0 start from last season.
The Cardinal men have cruised through the early
part of the year, letting in only four goals while putting
23 in the back of its opponents' cages. I hat overwhelm
ing ratio certainly has been t he key to 11 le squad's success.
Over the weekend, top-ranked Stanford collected its
sixth and seventh wins of the year by blanking Rich
mond and Dartmouth at the Dartmouth Tournament.
In its dominant 6-0 victory over hapless Rich
mond on Saturday, senior forward Roger Levesque
was the star of the show with six points off two goals

and two assists.
1 he team's leading scorer so far, Levesque has quick
ly answered all those who doubted his being able to re
turn from a nagging back injury from last season. In
seven games, Ile has already collected 18 points, includ
ing team-highs of four goals and 10 assists. He was
named the Pacific-10 Conference's Player of the Week
for the week of Sept. 10 for his early-season efforts.
Levesque made his presence known early with two
quick strikes in the 12th and 19th minutes on Saturday.
He helped the Cardinal build a comfortable 4-0 lead
with two unselfish plays to sophomore midfielder Dar
ren Fernandez and senior defender Todd Dunivant.
With a goal by senior midfielder Johanes Mali/a in
the 28th minute, the Cardinal had a commanding 5-0
lead heading into halftime, and the team went into
cruise control from then on.
Sophomore forward James Twellman scored his
second goal of the season to finish the scoring in the
63rd minute.
Dunivant also made a strong case to be picked as
man of the match with five points with his offensive play
from the backfield.
Also contributing to the shutout effort was the solid
play of senior defender Taylor Graham in the backfield.


MATT SAYLES/The Stanford Daily File
The No. 1 Stanford men's soccer team blanked Richmond and Dartmouth at last weekend's Dartmouth Tournament
to improve its undefeated record to 7-0 0.
Graham and the Cardinal defen
sive corps continued their sparkling
play with a second shutout victory
over tournament host Dartmouth.
But the Stanford offense wasn't
able to match its defensive counter

parts early on, sending the C Cardinal
into the half tied 0-0 with the still
winless Dartmouth.
However, six minutes into the
second hall, the Cardinal was final
ly able to capitalize on an opportu
nity as Mali/a boomed an 18-yard
shot past the Dartmouth keeper for
a 1-0 lead.
The match remained in limbo
until Fernandez added his second

goal of the season in the 87th
minute. Levesque added another
assist to his total with a feed to the
sophomore midfielder.
If there have been any questions
to the Cardinal's start to the season,
it has been its inability to play a com
plete 90-minute match. At times, the
team has settled comfortably with its
lead too soon and has allowed some
teams back in the game with some

second half goals.
However, in the last few games,
Stanford has been able to put to
gether some solid efforts, including
the one against Richmond. Playing
a pivotal role in helping the Cardi
nal put together a more complete
game has been the dependable
play of sophomore goalkeeper
Robby Fulton.
With senior Andrew Terris split

ting time in net for the Cardinal,
Stanford's dynamic duo in the net
has recorded live shutouts with Ful
ton getting credit for three of them.
Terris' play in the Dartmouth
match was vital as he collected six
saves to record his first shutout of
the year.
The tournament also awarded
two Cardinal players for their ex
ceptional individual efforts.

Levesque was named the tourna
ment's offensive MVP with three as
sists and two goals. Graham was
awarded the tournament's defen
sive MVP honors.
Stanford returns home to Mal
oney Field this weekend to host the
Stanford Nike Invitational. The
Cardinal will play Tulsa on Friday at
7:30 p.m. before facing Santa Clara
on Sunday at 2:30 p.m.
