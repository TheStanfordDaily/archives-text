# Stanford and USC take back the Pac-10
## 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
"Parity" had been the big buzz
word in NCAA women's volleyball
the past couple of years. The
order of the teams in the top 15 of
the national polls seemed arbi

trary at times, and the traditional
powerhouses in the sport — the
Stanfords, Long Beach States, the
Penn States — weren't always
among them.
It seemed that a new era of com
petitiveness had ushered itself in to
the women's volleyball scene. In

stead of the same five or six teams
battling for the national title each
year, upwards of 20 programs
started each season with what
seemed like a viable shot at the
NCAA crown.
And it had trickled down to the
Pacific-10 Conference, usually the
country's strongest conference,
where suddenly UCIA and Stan
ford, the only teams to have ever
won Pac-10 titles, weren't in the
race for the conference crown.
But as quickly as the national
playing field had apparently been
leveled, it has become apparent in
the first few weeks of the 2002 sea
son that "parity" is a fad of the past
— especially in the Pac-10.
Stanford and Southern Califor
nia are in a league of their own this
year. The teams started the year in
the top two spots in the national
rankings, with the defending Pac
-10 and NCAA champion Cardinal
holding on to the top spot. A loss to
Florida two weeks ago knocked
Stanford down to No. 4 and gave
the Trojans their first No. 1 rank
ing since 1984.
But rankings don't matter
when it comes to the Pac-10 race.
The teams' two meetings — on
Oct. 4 at Stanford and on Nov. 8 in
Los Angeles — may be all that
does. The teams split their match
es last year, with each winning the
matchup at home.
There are three Ail-Americans
and five All-Conference selections
between the two squads, granting
the other eight Pac-10 teams also
ran status basically from the start of
the year.
UCLA and Arizona had been in
the thick of the Pac-10 race during
the past two years, with the Wild
cats sharing the 2000 conference
title with USC and making their
first ever Final Four appearance
last year.
Arizona State and Washington
State had been making strides the
last few years to become competi

tive and even California, Oregon,
Oregon State and Washington
could be counted on to give one of
the top teams a good scare every
now and then.
But little is expected of any of
those eight teams this year, at least
when it comes to whose name is
going on the next Pac-10 and
N(A\ championship banners. At
least not this year, when USC and
Stanford are fielding two of the best
squads in their illustrious pro
grams' histories.
The Cardinal looks to be even
better than it was last year, which is
certainly impressive given its de
fending national champion status.
Senior outside hitter Logan Tom
has returned from the World
Championships, picking up six kills
per game against California and
No. 14 Pepperdine her first week
end back.
Sophomore outside hitter
Ogonna Nnamani had been carry
ing the team in Tom's absence,
leading the Cardinal in kills and
digs — a sign of the work she put
into her defensive skills during the
off-season after rarely playing in
the back row last year.
Junior middle blocker Sara
McCee looks like a candidate to be
a third All-American on the Cardi
nal squad. Last year's Pac-10 block
ing leader is at it again, topping the
conference with 1.42 blocks per
game this season.
Senior outside hitter Ashley Ivy
is having the best start to a season in
her Stanford career, leading the
conference in aces and providing
stability the Stanford backcourt. Ivy
is one of four Cardinal jump
servers who have helped stall other
teams' passing games, holding
Stanford opponents to a combined
.157 hitting percentage.
The Trojans explosive offense
from last year is back, as live players
in USC's regular rotation are hit-
