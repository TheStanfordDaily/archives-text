# Crew, sailing teams search for new members
## Crew prepares for opening of new Stanford Boathouse; sailing seeks top-20 finish 
### MIA ASHTON Crew 
With a strong finish to last season buoyed
by national recognition of individual ath
letes, Stanford's crew teams look forward to
a successful fall showing and plethora of
new recruits.
Last year was capped by the Collegiate Row
ing Coaches Association's naming of Sabrina
Kolker to the first-team All-America in July.
Kolker also joined 11 other rowers on the first
team All-Region.
In the same month, Kolker represented the
United States at the Under-23 World Champi

onships in Geneva, Italy.
Stanford junior Jamie Schroeder also par
ticipated in the Worlds Regatta, winning his
first international gold medal rowing five
seat in the men's eight. Beating the second
plate Canadian boat by over three seconds,
the U.S. finished with a time of 6 minutes,
12.05 seconds.
With the graduation of such stars as Kolker,
the men's, women's, and women's lightweight
crews are seeking out students interested in
walking on to the team. There will be a meet
ing tomorrow at 7:00 p.m. in Arrillaga's Kissick
Auditorium for more information.
New and returning members of both the
crew and sailing teams have more than great
athletic competition to look forward to. The
new Stanford Boathouse in Redwood Shores
is due for completion this January. The
16,500 square foot facility will boast five boat
bays and be located across the water from the

Bail" Island Wildlife Reserve.
Sailing
With over 250 sailing teams in its league, the
Stanford sailing team has remained competi
tive, maintaining its top-20 status over the p;ist
several years.
A large number of experienced sailors re
turn to the team this year, including junior
David Phillips and sophomore Lauren Gross,
who won the A-l)ivision competition at Sept.
7's Harry Anderson Regatta at Yale. Stanford
sophomores Jef! Allen and Jessie Duncan tri
umphed in the B-Division of the Regatta.
Sailing is looking to add to its already
strong base with walk-on athletes, some of
whom, according to coach Amy Gross, "have
already come out to practice last weekend."
Usually, she explained, Stanford students
who showed talent in other
sports in high school become in
terested in sailing because they
feel they are "too small" to play
competitively otherwise.
Because most sailing clubs
seek to limit the total weight of
skipper and crew to 280 pounds
— a bit more in windy conditions
— athletes relatively smaller in
size (100 to 140 pounds for
women)are welcome. In the past,
sailing walk-ons have gone on to
become Ail-American athletes.
The new walk-ons will join an
estimated 25 returning mem
bers, composed of approximate
ly 15 women and 10 men. After
its roster is finalized, the team
will focus primarily on its dou
blehanded races, marked by the
presence of a skipper and one
crew in the boat, along with its
singlehanded races.
Though most races are of the
former type, Stanford sent two
teammates to the Singlehanded
Nationals last year, and was one of
only five teams to send both a male
and a female to the competition.
Early season practice is crucial
with regattas like the Singlehand
ed Pacific Coast Championships,
which will be held at Berkeley
Oct. 4 through Oct. 6, coming up
soon. That regatta will determine
admittance and standing at the
Singlehanded Nationals.
