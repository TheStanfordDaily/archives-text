# Showing Tufts how the cool kids do it
## Having the East Coast friend see how the West Coast rules 
### MATT BABIN STAFF COLUMNIST 
In all likelihood, by the time
you read this, my Boston
Red Sox will have been
mathematically eliminated
from any shot at the playoffs.
Going into play last night ei
ther one Boston loss or one
Anaheim win killed offany pos
sible chance they had.
It hurts. It always does. Es
pecially this year, when they
went oft to that 40-17 start,
when they had two 20-game
winners and seven All-Stars.
But then the Yankees came
back, the West Coast teams
heated up, and the wheels fell
oil. Right on schedule.
But I'm not going to wax po
etically about "Red Sox Na
tion" here — not the time or
the place. There was a reason I
didn't go to school on the East
Coast. It was summed up quite
well in an e-mail from an old
high school friend at Tufts (a
recovering Red Sox fan him
self), who told me he was busy
preparing for, "God's impres
sionist landscape of death and
suffering: Medford, Mass., in
the winter." It sounded like
something out of my Russian
Studies I-Hum.
I sent him back a palm frond.
So now that I'm back on the
West Coast, there's no way that
I'm dwelling on an East Coast
team that once again will break
my heart. I've still got the ever
loving A's and Miguel Tejada to
watch, and they'll only charge
me a dollar on Wednesdays. No
reason to think of the way the
Olcle l owne Team went 7-10 to
start August when I can take my
beach chair out to the shore of
the crater (I'm sorry, I mean
Lake Lagunita) and try to fig
ure out classes.
Most importantly, I'm not
dwelling on the Red Sox free
fall when I've got a sloshball
challenge from Xanadu that 1
need to get my fellow Narnians
to answer.
My friend, the one who seeks
his higher education in"the
landscape of death and suffer
ing," once visited here oil a
spring weekend that was ab
solutely packed with sloshball
games. We walked down to Mo
Mo field to meet up with some
friends in Theta Delt. He
stopped at the edge of the field

and just stared.
"You kids at Stanford are
all athletes."
His eyes were wide, his
mouth agape. Maybe it was the
palm trees, the sunshine, the
girls in bathing suits — but he
was absolutely in awe. He said
he had never seen anything
like it.
"You even play sports when
you drink."
I'm no Tufts Jumbo (just
couldn't bear to have school
colors of chocolate brown and
baby blue), but 1 think my
friend was onto something.
He just stood there, watch
ing a diving save in the out
field as the fielder caught the
ball, cushioned his fall and
didn't even spill his cup of
frosty refreshment. He looked
(in at the party at second base,
the shuffling around the
basepaths, the flailing of the
non-dominant leg at the plate.
All under the warm California
sun as a barbeque grill smoked
in the shade.
"And you watch your games
on the weekends too."
Again, astonishment from
my friend. I asked him what a
Tufts football game was like.
"It's like the library."
During the past few days
around campus you didn't see
sloshball, not with everyone
obeying those dry Orientation
rules. But there was still plenty
of athletic activity for the fresh
man to get a feel for what things
are like here. Volleyball, soccer,
water polo, field hockey —
where do you start?
So as far as the Red Sox go,
I'll wait for them to suffer
through another off-season as
they try to re-sign Cliff Floyd
and get Pedro an extension. I'll
watch them jack up ticket
prices by 44 percent again,
supposedly justified by the
new, skilled players they bring
in. They'll get my hopes up
again and make me a believer.
It'll take a lot of work, and
months of long, cold days of
waiting, hut they'll do it.
In a nutshell, I will once
again "wait till next year."
As for sloshball, I just have to
wait until next weekend. So
start warming up your non
dominant leg. and help me put
second base on ice.
You gotta love the West Side.

Matt liabin is a senior majoring in
Economics who thinks sloshball
should bean IM sport by now. He'll
settle any arguments about this col
umn ii'ith a Thunderdome — or an
e-mail at babin@stanford.edu.
