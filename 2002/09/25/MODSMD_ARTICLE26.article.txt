# Ochs out for season with concussion
## 
### MITCH SCHNEIDER COLORADO DAILY 
(U-WIRE) BOULDER, Colo. â€”Craig
Ochs, Colorado's starting quarterback, is
done for the season.
After suffering his fourth career concus
sion in the San Diego State game on Sept.
7, Ochs announced Monday through a
press statement that he will "apply fora
medical waiver red-shirt for the 2002 foot
ball season ... withdraw as ;i student from
the University of Colorado. .. and relin
quish my athletic scholarship."
While extensive medical tests on the 6-
fbot-2,210-pound quarterback have come
back normal, ()(I is and his family have de
cided that his season is now over.
"We totally respect Craig and his fami
ly's decision," said Colorado head coach
Craig Harnett. "We want the best for (-raig,
no matter what. If this is what Craig and his
family have decided to be best for them,
then we certainly are going to do every
thing we can to make sure it's done the
right way."
Ochs, a junior and three-year starter,
has endured three concussions over the
last 12 months. His first two came in a
three-week span in games against Kansas
and Texas A&M in 2001. Ochs's third con
cussion occurred late in the first half of Col
orado's recent win against SDSU.
Ochs's decision to forego the rest of the
2002 season stunned many associated with
CU football, especially the head coach.

"1 was very surprised this morning
[after learning of Ochs's announce
ment]," said Barnett. "I know how much
of a competitor he is. 1 know how badly he
wants to play."
After a successful spring season, Ochs
entered the 2002 season as the clear-cut
captain and leader of the Colorado offense.
In his only two starts, the Boulder native
combined to complete 21-of-42 passes for
327 yards and two scores.
"Obviously, you hurt for Craig," said
Colorado quarterbacks coach Shawn Wat
son. "1 le's a tremendous young man. Bot
tom line, you want what's best for him and
for his future, for his health."
There was speculation that Ochs would
return lot Colorado's upcoming Big 12
opener against Kansas State on Oct. 5.
However, that possibility was quickly
quelled by Ochs's announcement.
"We never really knew exactly what was
going to happen," said CU offensive guard
Wayne Lucier. "We obviously hoped we
were going to get him back. We have a lot
of respect for him. We're going to have to
move on from here."
It is unclear ifC )chs will ever play football
again at Colorado. In his statement, Ochs
said he plans to "re-evaluate my options for
returning to play football next season."
After enrolling at CU as a freshman in
2000, ()chs's athletic eligibility entitled him
to play four years of football in a five-year
period. By dropping out of school, Ochs's
"eligibility clock" is still ticking away, de

spite his absence.
I fOchs chooses to return to Colorado in
2003, he can return as a junior and com
pete for two more seasons. If C)chs dec ides
to transfer and play lootball at another Di
vision I school, he must petition the NCAA
fora medical redshirt in hopes of acquiring
two years of eligibility (since Division 1
transfers must sit out their first year at a
new school).
"I think he just needs to get away and
figure everything out," Burnett said. "This
whole thing's been really hard on him. I le
really wants to play, wants to compete, and
it's been really frustrating for him."
In Ochs's absence, backup Robert
1 lodge will officially inherit the role of
starting quarterback. Hodge replaced
()chs iu the San Diego State game, and has
yet to relinquish the starting position.
While Hodge's season numbers aren't all
that impressive (14-for-'5B, 145 yards, one
interception), Hodge played a key role in
leading the Buffs to a SI-17 win over
UCLA last Saturday.
In the meantime, the Colorado football
program is saddened and shocked to hear
of Ochs's departure. A native of Boulder,
Ochs was the proverbial local boy made
good. Ochs attended many Buffalo games
as a child, and played quarterback at local
Fairview High School.
"I le's a great guy," Lucier said. "I've
always been a big Craig Ochs fan. He's
a great football player and we hate to
lose him."
