WASHINGTON (AP) — President
Bush told a couple of hundred champi
on college athletes packed into the
White House's East Room Tuesday to
"be champions oil the Held" too.
Bush welcomed the members and
coaches of 1 1 NCAA teams that won na
tional titles this spring.
"1 happen to believe you have a re
sponsibility to set an example for others,
that as you succeed on the field of play,
you got to remember there are young
sters looking at you, trying to determine
how they should live their life," Bush
said. "You've got an opportunity as
champions to be champions off the field
in the community in which you live."
As Bush congratulated the winning
teams, he accepted gifts —jerseys, golf
balls, even a tennis racket — and
mugged for the cameras with a repre
sentative from each.
The Princeton women's lacrosse
team drew a chuckle from Bush with
their present: a T-shirt emblazoned
with the score of the team's April C> 11-
5 victory over Yale, the president's
alma mater.
The day found Bush in his element:

cracking jokes, exhorting people to do
good in their communities and talking
sports with ease and obvious delight.
hi a tribute to Bush's roots, a special
place was reserved for the University of
Texas men's baseball team. They were
given a spot on risers directly behind
the president, which would make them
prominent in news photographs of the
event. Bush saved their introduction for
last — and longest.
"Finally, the mighty Longhorns of
the University of Texas... I'm proud to
be able to hook the horns," Bush said,
flashing the school's traditional hand
salute to team members, many of whom
joyfully signaled back.
The other teams invited to the White
House were: University of Minnesota
men's golf, Duke University women's
golf, University of South Carolina
women's outdoor track and field,
Louisiana State University men's out
door track and field and women's in
door track, University of California-
Berkeley women's softball, University
of Southern California men's tennis,
Stanford University women's tennis
and Syracuse University men's lacrosse.
