# Before, after Enron, GSB addresses ethics
## 
### KRISTIN SCHLEICHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In the wake of the corporate finance
scandals that have recently engulfed
Enron, World Com and a host of other
notable companies, American business
has struggled to reclaim a reputation for
ethics and integrity. As a consequence,
business schools across the nation — in
cluding Stanford's Graduate School of
Business — have faced public pressure to
promote responsible, ethical leadership
and prevent would-be white-collar crimi
nals from slipping through the cracks.
While business scholars debate
whether integrity can be taught in a class
room. ethics has long been at the fore
front of the Stanford GSB curriculum.
First-year MBA students are required
to take a pre-term course in ethical analy
sis and can opt to take electives titled
"Ethics and Global Business" or "Ethical
Issues in the Biotech Industry."
However, Senior Assoc. Dean for Aca
demic Affairs David Kreps said that spe
cialized courses on ethics, although valu
able, are not the most powerful way to
teach the subject — instead, ethics
should be considered in every course.
"The approach that we take is to weave
discussions of ethics and ethical issues
into our entire curriculum," Kreps said.
"This approach means that ethical con

cerns become part of the big picture
rather than being marginalized. That
makes for much more effective teaching
of the subject."
For example, Kreps said, in the re
quired microeconomics course he has
taught for the past decade, students have
direct discussions on ethical issues of
price discrimination, implicit collusion,
labor relations and the instrumental role
of ethical norms.
Kreps said he does not think the de

gree of focus on ethics and integrity has
changed significantly since corporate
scandals began to make the news, but he
does believe that such events can have a
positive impact on the ethics portion of
the business curriculum.
"First, recent events make ethical is
sues more salient in students' minds,"
Kreps said. "And second, recent events
give us a lot of fodder for discussion.

frameworks using specific recent
events as examples and cases al

attention."
First-year MBA student
Katharine Warsono said that the
pre-term ethic s course addressed
some now-infamous businesses
during the five two-hour class
sessions.
"There were a lot of discussions
and case analyses," she said. "One
of them was Enron. The business
school really takes into account
ethical issues and the need to re
store confidence in business."
Warsono said that the ethics
class also gave a global perspective
to ethical issues, incorporating top
ics such as pollution and bribery in
developing countries. She said that

lather than teach ethics, the c lass
led students to reconsider their ex
isting ethical norms.
"People's integrity has been
shaped before they go to business
school, but the classes challenge
you because some people will have
a different opinion of what is ethi
cal," Warsono said.
Fred Swaniker, also a first-year
MBA student, said that the early
term ethics course was valuable be
cause it introduced various ethical
frameworks to evaluate decisions.
"Stanford is doing a very good
job [of teaching ethics] given that
this is our first introduction to the
business school," Swaniker said.
"The professor said that this is not
the end of ethics at Stanford, it's
the beginning."
Many business schools have also
responded to the heightened con
cern about ethics by making extra
efforts to scrutinize the integrity
and character of their applicants.
In June, the Wharton School at

the University of Pennsylvania
hired t lit* firm A1 )I* Avert to screen
applications for falsified or embell
ished employment histories. Har
vard's business school asks writers
of recommendation letters to eval
uate applicants' integrity and hon
esty, and the school began inter
viewing all admitted students for
the first time last year.
Stanford's (iSH began spot
checks of transcripts' accuracy last
year, but overall has kept its ad
missions policies consistent with
previous years.
"I certainly don't have the sense
that we have a major problem with
falsified credentials," Kreps said.
rhe GSB is not (he only place at
Stanford for higher-level consid
eration of ethical questions.
Stanford Law Prof. Joseph
Grundfest noted that current con
cerns with business ethics have a
strong legal component.
" 1 hese days the real issue is get
ting businesspeople to comply

with laws already 011 the books," lie
said, citing Enron, WorldC lom and
Tyco as corporations whose execu
tives explicitly violated the law.
"In terms of what business
schools need to do, there really is
a twofold approach," Grundfest
said. "First, students need to
have a clear perspective of their
legal obligations, and second,
they need a moral compass sepa
rate from and higher than the
written law."
As for improving the general
perception of corporate leaders,
Kreps said that the public is not
easily deceived.
"What will restore public confi
dence is behavior by business lead
ers that merits public confidence,"
he said. "So Stanford — the GSB,
the Law School, and other units on
campus — help[s] to restore confi
dence to the extent that we help
business leaders to understand eth
ical questions, their broader respon
sibilities, and so forth," Kreps said.

a twofold approach," Grundfest
said. "First, students need to
have a clear perspective of their
legal obligations, and second,

As for improving the general
perception of corporate leaders,
Kreps said that the public is not
easily deceived.
"What will restore public confi
dence is behavior by business lead
ers that merits public confidence,"
he said. "So Stanford — the GSB,
the Law School, and other units on
campus — help[s] to restore confi
dence to the extent that we help
business leaders to understand eth
ical questions, their broader respon
sibilities, and so forth," Kreps said.
