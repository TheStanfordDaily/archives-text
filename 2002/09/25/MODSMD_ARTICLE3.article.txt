# Before, after Enron, GSB addresses ethics
## 
### KRISTIN SCHLEICHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In the wake of the corporate finance
scandals that have recently engulfed
Enron, World Com and a host of other
notable companies, American business
has struggled to reclaim a reputation for
ethics and integrity. As a consequence,
business schools across the nation — in
cluding Stanford's Graduate School of
Business — have faced public pressure to
promote responsible, ethical leadership
and prevent would-be white-collar crimi
nals from slipping through the cracks.
While business scholars debate
whether integrity can be taught in a class
room. ethics has long been at the fore
front of the Stanford GSB curriculum.
First-year MBA students are required
to take a pre-term course in ethical analy
sis and can opt to take electives titled
"Ethics and Global Business" or "Ethical
Issues in the Biotech Industry."
However, Senior Assoc. Dean for Aca
demic Affairs David Kreps said that spe
cialized courses on ethics, although valu
able, are not the most powerful way to
teach the subject — instead, ethics
should be considered in every course.
"The approach that we take is to weave
discussions of ethics and ethical issues
into our entire curriculum," Kreps said.
"This approach means that ethical con

cerns become part of the big picture
rather than being marginalized. That
makes for much more effective teaching
of the subject."
For example, Kreps said, in the re
quired microeconomics course he has
taught for the past decade, students have
direct discussions on ethical issues of
price discrimination, implicit collusion,
labor relations and the instrumental role
of ethical norms.
Kreps said he does not think the de

gree of focus on ethics and integrity has
changed significantly since corporate
scandals began to make the news, but he
does believe that such events can have a
positive impact on the ethics portion of
the business curriculum.
"First, recent events make ethical is
sues more salient in students' minds,"
Kreps said. "And second, recent events
give us a lot of fodder for discussion.
