### HELEN KIM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Welcoming events for the senior, ju
nior and sophomore classes, held yester
day afternoon, set the tone for the new
school year by giving students a taste of
what's to come as they begin a new stage
in their undergraduate education.
At the Senior Welcome, faculty and
student speakers advised the senior class
to make the most of their last year and be
leaders of society.
The Senior Class Presidents Ruby Ng,
Judi Jackson, James Alva and Rajaie Bat
niji emceed the event at a nearly packed
Memorial Church.
"Familiar faces and good food — what
more could a senior want on a Tuesday
morning?" Batniji said. "Hopefully this
will be a solid beginning to our Senior
Week — and year!"
Provost John Etchemendy, who spoke
after the presidents, urged seniors to
make the most of their final year and do
what they hadn't had time for in the past.
"If you don't explore here and now,
it's quite possible that you never will,"
Etchemendy said. "And that would be a
terrible mistake."
After Etchemendy, senior Wells
Bullard spoke nostalgically about her first
three years on The Farm.
"I feel each year has been successively
better than the last," she said. "Let's make
this year our best yet."
Political Science Assoc. Prof. Luis

Fraga encouraged the seniors to pursue
areas where they can practice and pro
mote leadership.
The a cappella group Everyday People
and Korean traditional music group
Hwimori also gave performances.
Senior Andres Turner found that the
Welcome reaffirmed his views about
making his last year the best one.
"Senior year is going to have flavor just
like every year has its own distinctive fla
vor," Turner said. "We're going to spice
[this year] up."
Senior Anita Idiculla agreed with what
Fraga said about leadership.
"We should step up as leaders in what
ever it is that we're pursuing," Idiculla
said. "1 think we should strive to connect
with underclassmen."
|unior Convocation, held at 4 p.m. at a
half-full Memorial Church, carried a tone
less of nostalgia and more of anticipation,
as members of the junior class embarked
upon the second halfof their undergrad
uate education.
After an invocation by Dean for Reli
gious Life Scotty McLennan and a wel
come from Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences Sharon Long, juniors Kelly Park
er, Jefferson Nguyen and Max Doty
gave individual performances in music
and poetry.
Declaring majors, setting academic
plans, and solidarity were among the
most pressing issues relayed by the speak-
