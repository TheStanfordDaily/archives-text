# CoHo debuts new neon decor
## 
### BENJAMIN L FRIEDLAND SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
One of Stanford's favorite on
campus hangouts has a new look
for the new school year.
In an attempt to increase the
Coffee House's business, Bon Ap
petit Management Company, the
corporate food service that runs the
CoHo and other campus eateries,
redesigned its interior with a funky
new look.
Furry pastel couches and
brighter lighting now characterize
the Tresidder establishment, which
formerly contained simple wooden
furniture and a wall mural.
"The CoHo needed some
work," said sophomore Kate Skol
nick. "It needed to be more like an
actual coffee house."
Despite Skolnick's thinking, stu
dent reaction has been mixed, and
many students have expressed
skepticism about the new design.
"The new furniture is far too
bright and far too new-age," said
electrical engineering co-terminal
student Dave Pai. "I think I will ac
tually go there less."

Sophomore Alec Clowes echoed
Pai's reaction.
"Bright pastel colors don't seem
so conducive to coffee," he said.
"The drink demands more earthy
tones."
Similarly, senior Megan Swan
son thought the couch colors
looked out of place in a coffee
house.
"I felt like I was at a Britney
Spears concert," she said. "They al
ready destroyed this place once,"
referring to previous changes in the
CoHo.
Religious Studies co-terminal
student John Mandsager, who
drinks two cups of coffee a day,
thought lie saw the new couches in
the latest Austin Powers movie.
"It looks like 'Goldmember,'" he
said. "In fact, it is 'Goldmember.' I
don't know what they're thinking."
Like Mandsager, second-year
law student Maya Sen claimed to
know where the seating originated.
"When I first saw the couches, 1
thought Ikea," she said. "Then 1
thought someone is definitely
going to spill something on them."
Marvin Rodriguez, general

manager of Bon Appetit at Stan
ford, did not return phone calls
from The Daily asking about the
changes.
Some students saw a positive
side in the new decor.
Sophomores Abbey Hall and
Orion 1 -akota firmly believed that
the new design will likely increase
business, but both agreed that they
wouldn't go out of their way to show
off the new look of the Col fo to vis
iting friends.
However, the new couches did
please some.
"That's just what I want when
I'm drinking coffee. Nothing says
Starbucks coffee like pastels," said
philosophy co-terminal student,
Dana 1 loward, who hopes to be em
ployed by the Col lo sometime dur
ing this academic quarter.
"I think that the staff should
wear matching uniforms," she said.
Senior Mike Pappas, a CoHo
regular, thinks the brightness may
solve a completely different Stan
ford problem: dating.
"I would definitely bring a girl
there," lit- said. "Those couches are
big."
