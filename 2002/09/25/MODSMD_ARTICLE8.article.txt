## Blair warns of Iraqi threat 
### 
LONDON (AP) — Iraq has a
growing arsenal of chemical and
biological weapons, and plans to
use them, Prime Minister Tony
Blair said yesterday, unveiling an
intelligence dossier to a special ses
sion of Parliament.
Blair, who also said Iraq is try
ing to develop nuclear weapons,
told lawmakers his priority is to get
inspectors back into Iraq. But lie
repeatedly expressed enthusiasm
for the U.S. goal of "regime
change" in Baghdad.
"Iraq, the region and the whole
world would be better off' without
Saddam Hussein, Blair said in re
leasing the dossier, which asserts
the Iraqi leader has weapons of
mass destruction ready to be used
within 45 minutes of an order to
fight.
"There is no way that this man,
in this region above all regions,
could begin a conflict using such
weapons and the consequences
not engulf the whole world," Blair
told a packed House of Commons.
Baghdad rejected the British
analysis, which also said Iraq was
trying to extend the range of its
ballistic missiles.
"The British prime minister is
serving the campaign of lies led by
Zionists against Iraq. Blair is part
of this misleading campaign,"
Iraqi Culture Minister Hammed
Youssef I lammadi said in Bagh
dad.
In Cairo, Iraqi Foreign Minis
ter Naji Sabri denied Iraq has or is
developing weapons of mass de
struction, and said Blair was trying
to justify a military attack against
Baghdad.
French President Jacques
Chirac and Chinese Prime Minis
ter Zhu Rongji both said the U.N.
Security Council must play a vital
role in the crisis.
"I do not think at all that war is
unavoidable," Chirac said, adding
that U.N. weapons inspectors
must be allowed to find out what
Saddam has.
Any military attack on Iraq that
does not have the blessing of the
Security Council "will lead to se
vere consequences," Zhu said.
The White House called the
dossier "frightening" and praised
Blair for his strong defense of the

U.S.-led efforts against Saddam.
"We don't trust this man, and
that's what the Blair report
showed today," President Bush
said.
The 50-page dossier — which
appeared to contain little new evi
dence— said "Iraq has military
plans for the use of chemical and
biological weapons," and has tried
to acquire "significant quantities"
of uranium from Africa.
"Unless we face up to the threat,
not only do we risk undermining
the authority of the U.N., whose
resolutions he defies, but more im
portantly ... we place at risk the
lives and prosperity of our own
people," Blair said in an introduc
tion to the report.
Blair is Bush's closest European
ally, but faces dissent within his
governing Labor Party and a re
ported rift in his Cabinet over an
Iraqi war. As he spoke yesterday,
several hundred anti-war protest
ers gathered outside Parliament,
including some riding a double
decker bus and singing John
Lennon's song "Give Peace a
Chance."
Amid tough questioning from
lawmakers, Blair repeatedly said it
was important to get U.N. backing,
but he did not shy from the possi
bility of military action to back up
demands for resumed weapons in
spections.
Michael Ancram, the opposi
tion Conservative Party's
spokesman for foreign affairs, said
his party supported Blair's asser
tion that military action "may well
in the end be necessary."
"Our message to Saddam Hus
sein today is blunt and it is simple:
you have reached the end of the
road. Destroy your weapons, or we
will do it for you," said Ancram.
Left-wing lawmakers said the
report provided little new infor
mation to justify the need for war.
"Tony Blair will have to do bet
ter than this if he wants to convince
the British public to go to war,"
said Labor lawmaker Diane Ab
bott.
A poll in yesterday's Guardian
newspaper said 86 percent of
Britons believe the government
should seek the support of Parlia
ment and the United Nations be

fore taking military action against
Iraq.
"For those of us who have never
subscribed to British unilateral
ism, we are not about to sign up to
American unilateralism now ei
ther," said Charles Kennedy,
leader of the opposition Liberal
Democrats.
The government report said
Saddam attaches great importance
to weapons of mass destruction.
"He is ready to use them, in
cluding against his own popula
tion, and is determined to retain
them, in breach of United Nations
Security Council resolutions," the
dossier said.
It provided a detailed history of
Iraq's weapons program and an
assessment of its current capabili
ties, based on British and allied in
telligence.
However, Maj. Charles Hey
man, editor of Jane's World
Armies, said the dossier "does not
produce any convincing evidence
. . . that Saddam Hussein has to be
taken out straight away."
"What it does do," he said, "is
produce very convincing evidence
that the weapons inspectors have
to be pushed back into Iraq very
quickly."
The London-based Iraqi Na
tional Congress said the dossier
backed up reports from defectors
from Saddam's regime that the
Iraqi leader poses a serious threat.
"Saddam has used (weapons of
mass destruction) against inno
cent Iraqi civilians," said Sharif Ali
Bin Al-Hussein. "If Saddam is al
lowed to develop and harbor
weapons of mass destruction, this
threat can only extend to the glob
al community."
The dossier rejected Iraqi
claims it has destroyed its biologi
cal weapons, saying Baghdad may
retain huge stocks of anthrax and
could deliver chemical and biolog
ical agents using free-fall bombs,
rockets, helicopter- and aircraft
borne sprayers and ballistic mis
siles. Iraq has mobile laboratories
for developing biological warfare
agents, the report said.
If U.N. sanctions against Iraq
were lifted, Saddam could develop
a nuclear weapon within 12
months to two years, it said.

fight.
"There is no way that this man,
in this region above all regions,
could begin a conflict using such
weapons and the consequences
not engulf the whole world," Blair
told a packed House of Commons.
Baghdad rejected the British
analysis, which also said Iraq was
trying to extend the range of its
ballistic missiles.
"The British prime minister is
serving the campaign of lies led by
Zionists against Iraq. Blair is part
of this misleading campaign,"
Iraqi Culture Minister Hammed
Youssef I lammadi said in Bagh
dad.
In Cairo, Iraqi Foreign Minis
ter Naji Sabri denied Iraq has or is
developing weapons of mass de
struction, and said Blair was trying
to justify a military attack against
Baghdad.
French President Jacques
Chirac and Chinese Prime Minis
ter Zhu Rongji both said the U.N.
Security Council must play a vital
role in the crisis.
"I do not think at all that war is
unavoidable," Chirac said, adding
that U.N. weapons inspectors
must be allowed to find out what
Saddam has.
Any military attack on Iraq that
does not have the blessing of the
Security Council "will lead to se
vere consequences," Zhu said.
The White House called the
dossier "frightening" and praised
Blair for his strong defense of the

U.S.-led efforts against Saddam.
"We don't trust this man, and
that's what the Blair report
showed today," President Bush
said.
The 50-page dossier — which
appeared to contain little new evi
dence— said "Iraq has military
plans for the use of chemical and
biological weapons," and has tried
to acquire "significant quantities"
of uranium from Africa.
"Unless we face up to the threat,
not only do we risk undermining
the authority of the U.N., whose
resolutions he defies, but more im
portantly ... we place at risk the
lives and prosperity of our own
people," Blair said in an introduc
tion to the report.
Blair is Bush's closest European
ally, but faces dissent within his
governing Labor Party and a re
ported rift in his Cabinet over an
Iraqi war. As he spoke yesterday,
several hundred anti-war protest
ers gathered outside Parliament,
including some riding a double
decker bus and singing John
Lennon's song "Give Peace a
Chance."
Amid tough questioning from
lawmakers, Blair repeatedly said it
was important to get U.N. backing,
but he did not shy from the possi
bility of military action to back up
demands for resumed weapons in
spections.
Michael Ancram, the opposi
tion Conservative Party's
spokesman for foreign affairs, said
his party supported Blair's asser
tion that military action "may well
in the end be necessary."
"Our message to Saddam Hus
sein today is blunt and it is simple:
you have reached the end of the
road. Destroy your weapons, or we
will do it for you," said Ancram.
Left-wing lawmakers said the
report provided little new infor
mation to justify the need for war.
"Tony Blair will have to do bet
ter than this if he wants to convince
the British public to go to war,"
said Labor lawmaker Diane Ab
bott.
A poll in yesterday's Guardian
newspaper said 86 percent of
Britons believe the government
should seek the support of Parlia
ment and the United Nations be

fore taking military action against
Iraq.
"For those of us who have never
subscribed to British unilateral
ism, we are not about to sign up to
American unilateralism now ei
ther," said Charles Kennedy,
leader of the opposition Liberal
Democrats.
The government report said
Saddam attaches great importance
to weapons of mass destruction.
"He is ready to use them, in
cluding against his own popula
tion, and is determined to retain
them, in breach of United Nations
Security Council resolutions," the
dossier said.
It provided a detailed history of
Iraq's weapons program and an
assessment of its current capabili
ties, based on British and allied in
telligence.
However, Maj. Charles Hey
man, editor of Jane's World
Armies, said the dossier "does not
produce any convincing evidence
. . . that Saddam Hussein has to be
taken out straight away."
"What it does do," he said, "is
produce very convincing evidence
that the weapons inspectors have
to be pushed back into Iraq very
quickly."
The London-based Iraqi Na
tional Congress said the dossier
backed up reports from defectors
from Saddam's regime that the
Iraqi leader poses a serious threat.
"Saddam has used (weapons of
mass destruction) against inno
cent Iraqi civilians," said Sharif Ali
Bin Al-Hussein. "If Saddam is al
lowed to develop and harbor
weapons of mass destruction, this
threat can only extend to the glob
al community."
The dossier rejected Iraqi
claims it has destroyed its biologi
cal weapons, saying Baghdad may
retain huge stocks of anthrax and
could deliver chemical and biolog
ical agents using free-fall bombs,
rockets, helicopter- and aircraft
borne sprayers and ballistic mis
siles. Iraq has mobile laboratories
for developing biological warfare
agents, the report said.
If U.N. sanctions against Iraq
were lifted, Saddam could develop
a nuclear weapon within 12
months to two years, it said.
