ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) — U.S. troops
headed to West Africa yesterday to safeguard
100 American school children holed up in a
rebel-held city after the bloodiest-ever uprising
in the Ivory Coast. Frightened residents re
ported heavy artillery and gunfire.
French troops moved closer to the central
city of Bouake as well, ready to rescue their na
tionals and other Westerners if Ivory Coast's
government makes good on a pledge to root out
forces behind a bloody coup attempt Thursday.
"A very welcome development," said a re
lieved James Forlines, director of Free Will
Baptist Foreign Missions, a Nashville, Tenn.-
based church group that had sent calls for help
overnight for the mission school in the cut-off
city after rebels breached the school's walls, fir
ing from its grounds.
"It has been a very trying day. It has been a
very trying five days," mission official Neil
Gilliland said, speaking by telephone from the
United States.

The scrambling to safeguard Westerners in
the Ivory Coast came amid clashes and growing
tensions after the failied coup. At least 270 peo
ple have died so far.
An American expeditionary force and
British troops already were on the ground in
Ivory Coast, Ghanaian and French military and
government officials said.
"The U.S. European Command is moving
forces to be in a closer position to provide for
the safety of American citizens," a statement
from the command said.
U.S. military aircraft including three C-130
cargo planes carrying troops and equipment
were expected late yesterday or early today at a
base at Ghana's capital, Accra, a senior official in
Ghana's Foreign Ministry said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
The base was expected to be the staging area
for any U.S. evacuation.
"There's fighting going on now in the area
near where this school is located. That's what

our concern is," State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher explained in Washington
about the children and staff of Bouake's Inter
national Christian Academy.
Tensions were "understandably high" at the
school, Boucher added, hut all students and
staff are believed safe.
U.S. defense officials spoke of deployment of
just under 200 American troops. No general
evacuation was planned of' Americans, Boucher
said.
One hundred French troops moved up
from their own staging area at Ivory Coast's
capital, Yamoussoukro, where helicopters and
trucks were standing by to ferry out foreigners.
"We want to get closer so that if the belliger
ents — whoever they are — attack our nation
als, we can intervene very quickly," said French
army Col. Charles de Kersabiec said. France is
Ivory Coast's former colonial ruler.
A new convoy of French reinforcements
rumbled into the capital after dark.
