Announcing a New Biological & Earth Sciences
Experience: Stanford@SEA
Join us in our new Stanford Classroom at HopkinsMarine Station & at Seal
182 H. Stanford at Sea—A quarter class featuring five weeks of marine science includ
ing oceanography, marine physiology, maritime studies, marine policy, conservation, and
nautical science at Hopkins Marine Station followed by five weeks at sea aboard a sailing
research vessel in the Pacific Ocean. The shore component will be comprised of three
multidisciplinary courses each of which will meet daily and continue during the ship
board experience. Students develop a detailed plan for an independent research project
while ashore and carry out the research at sea. The at sea portion of the trip will be on a
new 135' sailing research vessel with a cruise track in the Pacific ocean that will take us
from Hawaii to Palmyra Atoll and back. Offered in collaboration with the Sea Education
Association of Woods Hole, MA (www.sea.edu) at the cost of a quarter at Stanford
University.
16 units, Spr (Block, Dunbar, Qilly) alternate years, first class will be in the
