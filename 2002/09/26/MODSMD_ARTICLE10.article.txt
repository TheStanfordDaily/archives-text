Prof nominated for FDA post
Mark McClellan, an associate professor ofeconomics and of medicine,
who is currently on leave to serve as a member of President George W.
Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, was officially nominated for the
FDA directorship by the White House yesterday and could be confirmed
as early as today.
One of McClellan's prominent accomplishments as part of Bush's
Economic Advising Council is his contribution to the administration's
policy on prescription drug coverage for the elderly.
If the Senate OK's McClellan's nomination, McClellan will take on the
responsibility of directing the regulation of food, cosmetics, drugs and
medical devices.
"Dr. McClellan has impressive credentials both as a physician and an
economist," said Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass) in a recent CNN arti
cle. "I look forward to learning more about his views on issues critical to
the FDA."
Aside from McClellan's accomplishments, his connections with sever
al lawmakers and apparent prior lack of close ties to industries regulated
by the FDA are some of the factors that contributed to his nomination.
Branner leaks gas; Toy on forced to evacuate
At approximately 2 p.m. yesterday, an unsecured gas line at the Bran
ner construction site leaked gas into the vicinity of Toyon Hall, causing
Toyon residents to evacuate the building for several minutes.
"I felt helpless to the situation," said sophomore Dan Anthony, a
Toyon resident. "It was the first day of class, and we had to evacuate
whether we needed things or not."
Anthony stated that he thought the gas leakage could have led to a
risky situation.
Researchers turn alfalfa into gold mine
At the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, researchers from
the University of Texas-El Paso and Mexico discovered a new use for al
falfa plants — providing gold nanoparticles.
These researchers are taking advantage of the plant's inclination and
need to extract metals from the environment in which it grows. The
nanoparticles are valuable as semiconductors because of their oxidation
resistance and thermal and electrical conductivity.
This method would represent an environmentally safer alternative to
the old chemical techniques. For this reason, the Environmental Protec
tion Agency, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of
Health have chosen to fund the research.
The research team is still working on how to extract the nanoparticles
from the alfalfa.
In Brief
• Karen Offen and Marilyn Boxer, both from the Institute for Research
on Women and Gender, recently finished directing "Motherhood and
the Nation-State in Western Societies: Modern rimes," the first summer
seminar of its kind for college professors.
Through their continuing academic efforts, Offen and Boxer strive to
underscore the importance of mothers in the development of societies
and nation-states.
• The Stanford Institute for the Quantitative Study of Society
(SIQSS) and the University of Maryland Survey Research Center have
recently started IT & Society, a free quarterly online journal dedicat
ed to discussing Internet research. The Web site's address is
www.lTandSociety.org.
• Stanford physics Prof. Andrei Li tide was recently awarded the 2002
Dirac Medal by the Abdus Salam International center for Theoretical
Physics (ICTP) in Trieste, Italy. Linde's theories on the universe's origin
are thought to have molded much of the field of cosmology.
