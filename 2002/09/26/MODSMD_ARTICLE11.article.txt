## Daschle: Bush politicizing possible war 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen
ate Majority Leader Tom Daschle
accused President Bush yesterday
of playing politics with the debate
over war in Iraq, and demanded
the commander in chief "apolo
gize to the American people."
"We ought not politicize this
war," Daschle, S.D., said in blunt
remarks on the Senate floor less
than six weeks before the midterm
elections. "We ought not politicize
the rhetoric about war and life and
death."
No apology was forthcoming at
the White House, where
spokesman Ari Fleischer said
Daschle's attacks misstated com
ments Bush made earlier this week.
At the same time, the
spokesman declined numerous
times to say whether Bush stood
by his remark that the Senate —
controlled by Democrats — was
"not interested in the security of

the American people." And Fleis
cher said Bush believes that if the
Senate does not pass legislation to
create a new Department of
Homeland Security, "the security
of our country will not have been
protected."
White House officials also
worked behind the scenes with
GOP allies in Congress to rebut
Daschle, the nation's highest elect
ed Democratic official.
"Who is the enemy here, the
president of the United States or
Saddam Hussein?" asked Trent
Lott, R-Miss., the Senate GOP
leader.
Ironically, Daschle leveled his
charge at the same time Democra
tic congressional aides were closet
ed with administration officials,
seeking a compromise on legisla
tion that would authorize Bush to
use force to eliminate Iraqi
weapons of mass destruction.

Several sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said that
in the negotiations, the White
House had signaled a willingness
to delete language from its initial
draft that permitted the use force
to "restore international peace and
security in the region." Some De
mocrats have objected to the pro
vision, saying it grants Bush au
thority that goes far beyond Iraq.
Additionally, these sources said
the negotiations focused on
whether and when Bush would be
required to report to Congress on
the situation in Iraq, or about his
efforts to gain United Nations
backing for military action.
On a third point, these officials
said there was discussion about a
commitment, suggested by De
mocrats, that would make clear
that any military action in Iraq
would not come at the expense of
the overall war against terrorism.

The House and Senate both are
expected to vote on Iraq legisla
tion before adjourning for the
elections. Approval is expected in
both houses, although House De
mocrats say the size of Bush's vic
tory will depend, in part, on the
administration's willingness to ad
dress Democratic concerns in the
private negotiations.
While Congress is expected to
bless military action against Iraq,
several Democrats have suggested
in recent weeks that the persistent
talk of war was in part an attempt
by Republicans to divert election
year attention from the faltering
economy, health care and other
domestic concerns.
Daschle's words were triggered
by a comment Bush made Monday
during a political trip to Trenton,
N.J., and was a variation on a
theme that's become a staple of his
campaign-style speeches.
