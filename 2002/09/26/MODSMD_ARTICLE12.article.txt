# Sailor lost for three months returns home

### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — A man
who survived three months adrift
in the Pacific Ocean by collecting
rainwater in a bucket and roasting
the sea birds that landed on his
sailboat thanked the crew of the
U.S. warship that rescued him.
Richard Van Pham, (52, of Long
Beach returned to California on
Tuesday. Fie was held temporarily

by U.S. immigration officials, then
released after officials verified he
was a legal, permanent resident.
He had lost about 40 pounds
but was in good condition when he
was found aboard his damaged
sailboat a week ago by the San
Diego-based frigate McClusky,
Navy officials said.
"If you travel at sea, you take

what you find," Pham said in yes
terday's editions of the Los Angeles
Times. "If you are scared, you will
die."
Van Pham set sail from Long
Beach in his 26-foot sailboat, Sea
Breeze, bound for Santa Catalina
Island, some 25 miles offshore. En
route, a storm broke his mast and
fiis outboard motor and two-way

radio also failed.
On Sept. 17, his boat was spotted
from a plane 275 miles southwest of
Costa Rica, about 2,500 miles away
from his original destination. When
the McClusky neared, its crew saw it
jury-rigged sail flapped from a
splintered mast and a man cooking
a seabird on a makeshift grill.
The ship's corpsman, Petty Of
ficer Ist Class AJ. Davis, said Van
Pham described bashing a sea tur
tle with a bat as it swam near his
boat and then cooking part of the
meat while using the remainder as
bait for seabirds.
Capt. Terry Bragg, comman
der of Destroyer Squadron One in
San Diego, which oversees the Mc-
Clusky, said he had never heard a
story of survival like Van Pham's.
"It's a three-hour cruise gone
bad," Bragg said. "It's like a cross
between Gilligan's Island and
Robinson Crusoe."
Van Pham had used a small
grill on board his boat to cook
seabirds and turtle meat after he
ran out of food a week into the or
deal. To keep the grill going, he
began disassembling parts of the
boat for fuel, Bragg said.
Each day he drifted at sea, Van
Pham said, he looked for any sign
of life, any sign of land.
"I see nothing," he said. "Then
one day, I see a plane. I know I'm
close to people. They tip their
wings to say hello. Two hours later,
a ship comes to my boat. I am very,
very happy."
