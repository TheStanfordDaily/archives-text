NEW ORLEANS (AP) —Trop-
ical Storm Isidore drenched the
Gulf Coast yesterday, swamping
parts of New Orleans with thigh
deep water and chasing tourists
and residents inland as it swirled
toward land with a potential 20
inches of rain.
By evening, the center of the
sprawling storm was 215 miles
south of New Orleans and moving
north at 12 mph. Forecasters said
Isidore was expected to come
ashore along Louisiana's swampy
shoreline early today.
Coastal communities in
Louisiana and Mississippi were
swamped by the rain and many
posted evacuation notices. In Al
abama, pounding surf eroded
beaches and storm preparations
were under way as far north as
Birmingham, 200 miles from the
Gulf of Mexico.
Isidore battered Mexico's Yu
catan Peninsula as a hurricane over

the weekend, killing at least two
people before losing its punch. But
the storm has strengthened since it
moved back over the Gulf, and was
packing 65-mph winds as it headed
toward the U.S. mainland.
More than 8 inches of rain fell
on parts of Louisiana, Mississippi,
Alabama and Florida, knocking
out power to at least 1,000 people
in Louisiana.
Another foot of rain was fore
cast in some places, including New
Orleans, where drainage pumps
were already struggling to keep
up. Streets in several neighbor
hoods were swamped by more
than 2 feet of water. The mayor
closed City Hall at noon and
dozens of flights were canceled at
the airport.
Schools across the Gulf Coast
were also closed, and officials
urged residents to leave such low
lying areas as Alabama's Dauphin
Island and Louisiana's Grand Isle.
