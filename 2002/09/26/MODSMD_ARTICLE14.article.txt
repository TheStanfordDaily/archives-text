## The
						Stanford Daily Additional day of Orientation a welcome change 
### 
Published Since 1891

The theme of this year's New Stu
dent Orientation centered on
finding a focus in a "kaleidoscope"
of Stanford activities. With so
many clubs, classes, new friends and dorm
activities, trying to figure out what's going
on can indeed be overwhelming. We ap
plaud the New Student Orientation plan
ning staff for adding an additional day to the
program and urge them to make this new
change permanent.
It may seem like adding another 24 hours
to Orientation is insignificant. After all, thou
sands of Stanford students have adjusted to
life on The Farm with the five-day schedule

and lived to tell the tale.
But there is a better way, and the NSO of
fice found it. To start, the new schedule al
lows students more time to get settled in. In
stead of spending a hectic Friday night say
ing goodbye to family, meeting the whole
dorm, watching skits, hearing welcoming re
marks and running with the band, students
can savor these activities through a slower,
more mellow program.
The cost of the extra day on campus is in
curred by the incoming students, but for an
additional fee of less than $40 per student,
many probably agree that it is well worth it.
The NSO staff has offered a gift few students

at Stanford will ever have or choose to have
again: time to slow down.
Many upperclassmen probably remem
ber their Orientation days well. Often, it
seemed like the only time to really get to
know other students was late at night â€” and
going to bed meant possibly missing out on
good bonding time. Granted, this frenzied
pace is what keeps us so energetic, gives us
the drive to write theses and go on to jobs or
graduate school. Most of us love doing prac
tically everything. But packing such a busy
schedule leaves little time just for hanging
out and conversing with the people in your
dormitory who will likely be your friends for

the next four years.
Many upperclassmen who returned early
to campus enjoyed experiencing leisure time
with their friends before classes began. In
this slow, relaxed environment, new and re
turning students alike can ease into the
school year and try to determine their goals,
the classes they want to take and the activities
they want to pursue.
If Orientation is a kaleidoscope, then the
new schedule serves as a way for students to
savor each color and image and to find ac
tivities and friends which are truly mean
ingful and will make their time at Stanford
complete.
