Assoc. medical director explains blood
donor screening methods
As Associate Medical Director of the
Stanford Medical School Blood Center, I
would like to respond to the concerns
raised by Mr. Shelby (Letters to the Editor,
Sept. 25) that blood donor screening prac
tices are "unfair and homophobic." Blood
donor eligibility criteria in the United
States are established by the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA), and all blood
donor centers in the U.S. are required to
comply with these criteria. The FDA re
quires blood centers to ask specific ques
tions of potential donors, and requires us
to refuse donations from individuals who
meet the FDA definitions of being at in
creased risk for acquiring HIV or hepati
tis. All blood donations that we do accept
are subjected to multiple infectious disease
tests, including three tests for HIV.
Despite all of this donor questioning
and testing, there remains a low risk of
transfusion-transmitted HIV, currently
estimated at approximately one per 1.6
million units. While that may seem to be
an extremely low risk, of course everyone
would like that risk to be zero. The current
risk of transfusion transmitted HIV is at
tributed to donors who have recently ac
quired the infection and whose tests have
not yet become positive.
Recent studies indicate that current
donor screening policies result in a donor
population that has an incidence of new
HIV infections that is 10 times lower than
incidence among the general population
and 1,000 times lower than the incidence
among populations of men who have sex
with men who have been studied.
It is our understanding that the FDA is
somewhat reluctant to change donor eligi

bility criteria in any way that might result
in an increased risk of transfusion-trans
mitted disease.
All that said, I do agree that there are
changes that the FDA could make that
would be medically reasonable. The FDA
does periodically re-evaluate its policies,
and interested individuals may conta<!t the
FDA for more information. As a place to
start, I would suggest that readers first re
view the information that the FDA has
posted about this subject on its Web site at
http://www.fda.gov/cber/faq/bldfaq.htm.
A summary of the studies on the incidence
of new HIV infections among populations
of men who have sex with men can be
found at the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) Web site at

Parent thanks Stanford community
As the parent of a new first year student,
I want to congratulate the Stanford com
munity on a fabulous welcome during First
Year Orientation. From the first moments
of driving onto campus and being greeted
by groups enthusiastic students, to the per
sonal greeting of my daughter as she arrived
to Roble Hall, to the tearful goodbyes that
evening, I came to know without a doubt
that the Stanford community is, indeed, a
special place to be. Thank you to all who
worked so hard to welcome us to the Stan
ford family. We look forward to sharing in
the life of this community for years to come.
