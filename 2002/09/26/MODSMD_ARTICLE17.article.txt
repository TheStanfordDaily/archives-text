# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Students should follow theologian Bonhoeffer's example

sound familiar? At the same time, he was fre

tions about whether he really was able to be
"there for others."
In 1939, he became a double agent in
Germany: He played the gende pastor role,
representing the Nazi regime international
ly, but on those trips he smuggled docu
ments on the German resistance to the
Western allies as well as information about
atrocities against the Jews. During the holi
day season in 1942, three months before his
imprisonment (and two years before his ex

Isn't this a beautiful place? I am starting
my eighth year at Stanford, and there isn't a
day that I don't marvel at how spectacular
this place is. It's spectacular because of its
beauty; it's really spectacular because of the
people who are here. Each professor whom
you will encounter is the top expert in the
world in whatever he or she teaches and re
searches. And each peer whom you en
counter has incredible talents.
So how intimidating is that? Incredibly.
This is a hard place to maintain your self-es
teem. There's another way to think about
this, of course. "I got myself here. There
fore, I am one of the top people in the
world." So how much of an ego trip is that?
A really big one. This is a hard place to be
humble.
One of the great challenges for all of us is
to maintain a sense of balance between who
we are and what we are as individuals (that's
the self-esteem part) and the demands, du
ties and powers given to each one of us by
the blessings of this place (that's the humili
ty part).
How do we try to do this? I make no
claim to have an answer to this question or
to have solved the balance question. But
one of my chosen paths for dealing with
the balance question is to remind myself
of how a particular person managed to
cope with this question, maintain integri
ty and do the right thing. The person I'm
referring to is Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a
Lutheran theologian, born in 1906 and
murdered at Flossenburg Concentration
Camp in April 1945, two weeks before the
camp's liberation.
Bonhoeffer was a Stanford kind of guy.
He was so brilliant he finished his studies in
theology at the age of 20, too early to be or
dained a Lutheran pastor. Let me put that
into contemporary speak — he had too
many AP credits, he did too much co
terming, and he took too many quarters of
20 units. He was a concert-quality musician
and was overly competitive at handball. Re
ports on him as a young man reveal that he
was a bit on the arrogant side and fairly in
tolerant of sloppy thinking. Does any of that

Relationships rooted in a market economy are
not ones that lead to a quality life or that spare
people from hatred and violence.

nation attempt against Hider), he wrote an
essay called "After 10 Years," in which he re
flects on the nature of his life caught be
tween two worlds. His words speak to us
anew in this troubled time.
I chose for you a section called "the sense
of quality" and particularly the portions on
social quality and cultural quality. "We need
to recover a social order based on quality,"
he writes. "Social [quality] means the renun
ciation of all place-hunting, a break with the
cult of the 'star,' an open eye both upwards
and downwards, especially in the choice of
one's more intimate friends — as well as
courage to enter public life. [Cultural quali
ty] means a return from the newspaper and
die radio to the book, from feverish activity
to unhurried reflection, [and] from virtuos
ity to art."
He continues, "Quantities are competi
tive, qualities are complementary."
Now, we all know we've all found our
selves here because of the cult of the "star."
We even call faculty searches "star search
es." I'm still really proud of being the star
who got to head the Language Center. But
in my more honest moments, I know that

there are any number of people who could
do my job and who could service you as stu
dents in very wonderful ways. We have all
been called here; we are not entitled to l>e
here.
Bonhoeffer also advises us to lcx)k up
ward and downward in the choice of one's
more intimate friends. He means we need
broad friendships — friendships with indi
viduals not like ourselves. While we know
this in the abstract, let me read you some ad
vice about this very topic from [The Daily's
Orientation issue]. There was an article en
tided, "The Top Fen Things You Should

Know About Stanford." Fourth from the
top is, "Befriend people with cars, printers
and computer knowledge. This is impera
tive." I'm not certain that Bonhoeffer would
agree. While we all realize the tongue-in
cheek nature of the Daily article, t here's an
underlying ugly truth that in our competi
tive, quantitative world we may choose to in
teract with those who can help us get some
where. And I will hasten to add there will be
those who choose to interact wit h us because
we (with our Stanford label) might help
them get somewhere. Relationships rooted
in a market economy are not ones that lead
to a quality life or that spare people from ha
tred and violence.
About cultural quality, Bonhoeffer tells
us that we need to turn from the newspaper
and the radio to the book. Gee, did Bonho
effer presage MTV and the sound byte?
Well, yes; but he certainly isn't telling us not
to read newspapers, is he? No, not at all.
What he is focusing on is books and on read
ing them from beginning to end. We need
to do this to understand the fiill argument
that someone is making and not to bend to
sloganism. Even the most extensive newspa-

per article or TV report cannot give us the
full set of facts set forth according to some set
of logic, perspectives and principles that a
book can. He urges us not to pick and
choose between and among catchy phrases
that play to our own prejudices, but to de
vote time to something in depth. And I
don't think he meant your chemistry text
book. He meant understanding cultural
and spiritual traditions — something that
had been eliminated in his own society and
culture. Now you will be socialized into
complaining about I-Hum. That socializa
tion process has probably already started.
Before your peers convince you of that,
please realize that one of the fundamental
objectives behind such a course is to help
you think in depth about selected texts.
And, yes, that means hours and hours of
careful reading.
He advises us to turn from feverish activ
ity to unhurried reflection. That is almost
impossible around here. There are 6,000
Type-A personalities in the students planted
here, as well as 1,500 Type-A personality
faculty members, around 4,000 Type-A
personality graduate students ... Well,
you get the point. We probably are at the top
of the most-Type-A-personalities-per
square-foot-in-t he-world list. This is the cap
ital of feverish activity, and automatic pilot is
our default mode. By the way, The Daily of
fered some advice on this point, too. No. 9
on what you should know is the following:
The Bender Room couches are t he best way
to spend down time. Kick off your shoes, lay
out and take a nap. Think about down time
(the very very little that you have) not as
sleep time but as the time in which you stop
even fora minute or two to re-focus on what
you're doing, how you're doing it, and
whether it truly reflects your values and
your talents. Automatic pilot, hitting the
send key too fast, and whipping out assign
ments just to get them done is what gets us
all into trouble now and again.
Finally, he advises us to move from virtu
osity to art; that is, from Hollywood to con
tent, from technique to substance. I en
counter many students who think first
about how they will package something
rather than thinking about what's in the
package. In other words, they'll think about

which feature of Powerpoint to use (appear
and dim, ellipse motion, faded zoom, sound
effects, video tiles, live links to the Internet)
and spend relatively little time on the sub
stance of the matter. It will be extremelv dif
ficult in this place to resist these temptations,
but indeed they are temptations. Who
doesn't want to be acknowledged as a virtu
oso? Just remember Bonhoeffer's warning
to be an artist rather than a virtuoso.
So what are we to do with ourselves? I left
out one part above. Bonhoeffer urges ev
eryone to have the courage to enter public
life. Given what we have all lived through in
the past year, there is no greater need in our
world (as was true during the very dark pe
riod of Nazi Germany) than for persons of
good will to enter public life — persons who
do develop relationships upward and
downward, who read both widely and
deeply, who reflect on what they do and why
they do it, who are more concerned with the
truth and the value of what they do than
about how it appears and who put these
qualities together in public action.
When Bonhoeffer wrote his comments
on quality, lie was about to embark upon the
greatest challenge of his life — staying true
to his values in the face of great personal
risk. Indeed, he held on to those values up
to the moment he was martyred.
As 1 welcome you, as we all welcome you,
we do so in the knowledge that you are em
barking on a great and wonderful challenge.
Developing and understanding your values
in all of their dimensions —positive and neg
ative — is a key part to meeting that chal
lenge. We are all here to support you along
this road, as you are here to support us.
Let me give the final word to Bonhoeffer:
"[What the world needs] is not geniuses, or
cynics, or misanthropes, or clever tacticians,
but plain, honest, straightforward people.
Will our inward power of resistance be strong
enough, and our honesty with ourselves re
morseless enough, for us to find our way back
to simplicity and straightforwardness?"

Isn't this a beautiful place? I am starting
my eighth year at Stanford, and there isn't a
day that I don't marvel at how spectacular
this place is. It's spectacular because of its
beauty; it's really spectacular because of the
people who are here. Each professor whom
you will encounter is the top expert in the
world in whatever he or she teaches and re
searches. And each peer whom you en
counter has incredible talents.
So how intimidating is that? Incredibly.
This is a hard place to maintain your self-es
teem. There's another way to think about
this, of course. "I got myself here. There
fore, I am one of the top people in the
world." So how much of an ego trip is that?
A really big one. This is a hard place to be
humble.
One of the great challenges for all of us is
to maintain a sense of balance between who
we are and what we are as individuals (that's
the self-esteem part) and the demands, du
ties and powers given to each one of us by
the blessings of this place (that's the humili
ty part).
How do we try to do this? I make no
claim to have an answer to this question or
to have solved the balance question. But
one of my chosen paths for dealing with
the balance question is to remind myself
of how a particular person managed to
cope with this question, maintain integri
ty and do the right thing. The person I'm
referring to is Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a
Lutheran theologian, born in 1906 and
murdered at Flossenburg Concentration
Camp in April 1945, two weeks before the
camp's liberation.
Bonhoeffer was a Stanford kind of guy.
He was so brilliant he finished his studies in
theology at the age of 20, too early to be or
dained a Lutheran pastor. Let me put that
into contemporary speak — he had too
many AP credits, he did too much co
terming, and he took too many quarters of
20 units. He was a concert-quality musician
and was overly competitive at handball. Re
ports on him as a young man reveal that he
was a bit on the arrogant side and fairly in
tolerant of sloppy thinking. Does any of that

Relationships rooted in a market economy are
not ones that lead to a quality life or that spare
people from hatred and violence.

nation attempt against Hider), he wrote an
essay called "After 10 Years," in which he re
flects on the nature of his life caught be
tween two worlds. His words speak to us
anew in this troubled time.
I chose for you a section called "the sense
of quality" and particularly the portions on
social quality and cultural quality. "We need
to recover a social order based on quality,"
he writes. "Social [quality] means the renun
ciation of all place-hunting, a break with the
cult of the 'star,' an open eye both upwards
and downwards, especially in the choice of
one's more intimate friends — as well as
courage to enter public life. [Cultural quali
ty] means a return from the newspaper and
die radio to the book, from feverish activity
to unhurried reflection, [and] from virtuos
ity to art."
He continues, "Quantities are competi
tive, qualities are complementary."
Now, we all know we've all found our
selves here because of the cult of the "star."
We even call faculty searches "star search
es." I'm still really proud of being the star
who got to head the Language Center. But
in my more honest moments, I know that

there are any number of people who could
do my job and who could service you as stu
dents in very wonderful ways. We have all
been called here; we are not entitled to l>e
here.
Bonhoeffer also advises us to lcx)k up
ward and downward in the choice of one's
more intimate friends. He means we need
broad friendships — friendships with indi
viduals not like ourselves. While we know
this in the abstract, let me read you some ad
vice about this very topic from [The Daily's
Orientation issue]. There was an article en
tided, "The Top Fen Things You Should

Know About Stanford." Fourth from the
top is, "Befriend people with cars, printers
and computer knowledge. This is impera
tive." I'm not certain that Bonhoeffer would
agree. While we all realize the tongue-in
cheek nature of the Daily article, t here's an
underlying ugly truth that in our competi
tive, quantitative world we may choose to in
teract with those who can help us get some
where. And I will hasten to add there will be
those who choose to interact wit h us because
we (with our Stanford label) might help
them get somewhere. Relationships rooted
in a market economy are not ones that lead
to a quality life or that spare people from ha
tred and violence.
About cultural quality, Bonhoeffer tells
us that we need to turn from the newspaper
and the radio to the book. Gee, did Bonho
effer presage MTV and the sound byte?
Well, yes; but he certainly isn't telling us not
to read newspapers, is he? No, not at all.
What he is focusing on is books and on read
ing them from beginning to end. We need
to do this to understand the fiill argument
that someone is making and not to bend to
sloganism. Even the most extensive newspa-

per article or TV report cannot give us the
full set of facts set forth according to some set
of logic, perspectives and principles that a
book can. He urges us not to pick and
choose between and among catchy phrases
that play to our own prejudices, but to de
vote time to something in depth. And I
don't think he meant your chemistry text
book. He meant understanding cultural
and spiritual traditions — something that
had been eliminated in his own society and
culture. Now you will be socialized into
complaining about I-Hum. That socializa
tion process has probably already started.
Before your peers convince you of that,
please realize that one of the fundamental
objectives behind such a course is to help
you think in depth about selected texts.
And, yes, that means hours and hours of
careful reading.
He advises us to turn from feverish activ
ity to unhurried reflection. That is almost
impossible around here. There are 6,000
Type-A personalities in the students planted
here, as well as 1,500 Type-A personality
faculty members, around 4,000 Type-A
personality graduate students ... Well,
you get the point. We probably are at the top
of the most-Type-A-personalities-per
square-foot-in-t he-world list. This is the cap
ital of feverish activity, and automatic pilot is
our default mode. By the way, The Daily of
fered some advice on this point, too. No. 9
on what you should know is the following:
The Bender Room couches are t he best way
to spend down time. Kick off your shoes, lay
out and take a nap. Think about down time
(the very very little that you have) not as
sleep time but as the time in which you stop
even fora minute or two to re-focus on what
you're doing, how you're doing it, and
whether it truly reflects your values and
your talents. Automatic pilot, hitting the
send key too fast, and whipping out assign
ments just to get them done is what gets us
all into trouble now and again.
Finally, he advises us to move from virtu
osity to art; that is, from Hollywood to con
tent, from technique to substance. I en
counter many students who think first
about how they will package something
rather than thinking about what's in the
package. In other words, they'll think about

which feature of Powerpoint to use (appear
and dim, ellipse motion, faded zoom, sound
effects, video tiles, live links to the Internet)
and spend relatively little time on the sub
stance of the matter. It will be extremelv dif
ficult in this place to resist these temptations,
but indeed they are temptations. Who
doesn't want to be acknowledged as a virtu
oso? Just remember Bonhoeffer's warning
to be an artist rather than a virtuoso.
So what are we to do with ourselves? I left
out one part above. Bonhoeffer urges ev
eryone to have the courage to enter public
life. Given what we have all lived through in
the past year, there is no greater need in our
world (as was true during the very dark pe
riod of Nazi Germany) than for persons of
good will to enter public life — persons who
do develop relationships upward and
downward, who read both widely and
deeply, who reflect on what they do and why
they do it, who are more concerned with the
truth and the value of what they do than
about how it appears and who put these
qualities together in public action.
When Bonhoeffer wrote his comments
on quality, lie was about to embark upon the
greatest challenge of his life — staying true
to his values in the face of great personal
risk. Indeed, he held on to those values up
to the moment he was martyred.
As 1 welcome you, as we all welcome you,
we do so in the knowledge that you are em
barking on a great and wonderful challenge.
Developing and understanding your values
in all of their dimensions —positive and neg
ative — is a key part to meeting that chal
lenge. We are all here to support you along
this road, as you are here to support us.
Let me give the final word to Bonhoeffer:
"[What the world needs] is not geniuses, or
cynics, or misanthropes, or clever tacticians,
but plain, honest, straightforward people.
Will our inward power of resistance be strong
enough, and our honesty with ourselves re
morseless enough, for us to find our way back
to simplicity and straightforwardness?"
