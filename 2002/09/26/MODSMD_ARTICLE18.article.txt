## Runners flock to Farm for Stanford Invitational The 						Stanford women return for another team title 
### ERIK SPERLING STAFF WRITER 
In mid-October, the Stanford
women's cross country team will
fly to Indiana fora chance to test
the NCAA Championships
course before the real event in
mid-November.

Women's Cross Country
Golf Course, Saturday, all day

To preview the West Regional
Championships course, however,
the team needs merely to walk
across campus to the Stanford
Golf Course.
That's also where this Satur
day's Stanford Invitational will be
run. This year, the course for the
Invitational has been slightly
modified to match that of the
West Regionals, the qualifying
meet for the NCAA Champi
onships.
The Stanford Invitational is
one of the largest cross country
meets in the nation, with over
4,100 high school and collegiate
racers competing throughout the
day.
The capstone events are the
collegiate races in the afternoon,
which include the women's
4,000-meter and 6,000-meter
races.
This weekend the Cardinal
women will toe the line ranked
3rd in the Finish Lynx national
rankings. The team returns six of
seven runners from last year's
squad that finished fifth at
NCAAs.
Returning members include
seniors Lauren Fleshman and

Erin Sullivan and sophomore Ali
cia Craig, all of whom earned All-
America status at last year's cham
pionships.
After several years of going
into nationals with a No. 1 rank
ing and failing to produce the
title, this year's team has redou
bled its training efforts, and so far
the results have been impressive.
The team dominated the Cal
State-Fullerton Invitational, with
Craig and fellow sophomore Sara
Bei sharing the individual victory
in a time of 17 minutes, 1 second
for 5,000 meters.
"Our training has stepped up
a notch over last year," said
sophomore Jeane GofF. "All of
our workouts are more intense
and higher quality. We're having
a lot of fun, but we're also ready
for business."
The Stanford Invitational will
be the team's first real chance to
show its fitness. After three weeks
at a high-altitude training camp
in Mammoth, the team should be
well-prepared for challenges
from top schools like Arkansas
and Pacific-10 Conference rival
UCLA
Although 2001 national cham
pion Brigham Young competed
at last year's Invitational, the
Cougars have declined to send a
team to this year's event. At last
year's race, the Cardinal easily de
feated BYU by 64 points in the
6,000-meter event and by 13
points in the 4,000-meter event.
In cross country, the first run
ner to cross the finish line receives
one point, and each subsequent
runner receives an additional
point. The team's top five plac
ings are tallied and the team with
the lowest score wins.
Victories on the magnitude of
64 points thereby represent a
very comfortable margin. How

ever, by the pre-NCAA meet in
mid-October, BYU had cut Stan
ford's winning margin to one
point, the difference of one runner
finishing just one spot higher.
By nationals, the tables had
turned. BYU won the NCAA title,
finishing 150 points ahead of Stan
ford.
While the chance to test its fit
ness against this year's BYU squad

would have been informative, the
Cardinal is also happy to enter its
first big meet of the year without
the pressure of racing against its
top rival. This gives the team the
opportunity to work on its team
mechanics and racing strategy
without looking too far ahead.
"We don't want to race them
and win and get cocky, or else lose
and get discouraged," said sopho
more Elizabeth Rose.
The team's philosophy is to
enter each race not concerned with
their competitors but rather fo
cused on its own performances on

the individual level and as a team.
"We've prepared to race really
well, done everything we need to
do," Goff said. "We're not focusing
on the end result at NCAAs, but
trying to prepare ourselves as well
as we can for every race."
This weekend will be the first
Stanford Invitational for the new
class of freshman runners, includ
ing Kristin Cohoon, Christine Con
cho, Yfa Kretzschmar and Rachel
Urbina.
Although this class lacks the ac
colades of last year's freshman
group that included Bei, the high

school national champion, the
newcomers showed a strong work
ethic and high potential while at
training camp.
"They're all really hard work
ers," Goff said. "I think they'll show
a lot of improvement. Coming to
college will be a big step up from
their high school programs, but I
think they are a very solid group."
The starting line for the Stan
ford Invitational is near the second
tee of the Stanford Golf Course.
The women's 4,000-meter race will
begin at 4:10 p.m., and the 6,000-
meter race will start at 4:50 p.m.
