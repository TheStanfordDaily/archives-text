## Runners flock to Farm for Stanford Invitational The
						Stanford women return for another team title 
### ERIK SPERLING STAFF WRITER 
In mid-October, the Stanford
women's cross country team will
fly to Indiana fora chance to test
the NCAA Championships
course before the real event in
mid-November.

Women's Cross Country
Golf Course, Saturday, all day

To preview the West Regional
Championships course, however,
the team needs merely to walk
across campus to the Stanford
Golf Course.
That's also where this Satur
day's Stanford Invitational will be
run. This year, the course for the
Invitational has been slightly
modified to match that of the
West Regionals, the qualifying
meet for the NCAA Champi
onships.
The Stanford Invitational is
one of the largest cross country
meets in the nation, with over
4,100 high school and collegiate
racers competing throughout the
day.
The capstone events are the
collegiate races in the afternoon,
which include the women's
4,000-meter and 6,000-meter
races.
This weekend the Cardinal
women will toe the line ranked
3rd in the Finish Lynx national
rankings. The team returns six of
seven runners from last year's
squad that finished fifth at
NCAAs.
Returning members include
seniors Lauren Fleshman and

Erin Sullivan and sophomore Ali
cia Craig, all of whom earned All-
America status at last year's cham
pionships.
After several years of going
into nationals with a No. 1 rank
ing and failing to produce the
title, this year's team has redou
bled its training efforts, and so far
the results have been impressive.
The team dominated the Cal
State-Fullerton Invitational, with
Craig and fellow sophomore Sara
Bei sharing the individual victory
in a time of 17 minutes, 1 second
for 5,000 meters.
"Our training has stepped up
a notch over last year," said
sophomore Jeane GofF. "All of
our workouts are more intense
and higher quality. We're having
a lot of fun, but we're also ready
for business."
The Stanford Invitational will
be the team's first real chance to
show its fitness. After three weeks
at a high-altitude training camp
in Mammoth, the team should be
well-prepared for challenges
from top schools like Arkansas
and Pacific-10 Conference rival
UCLA
Although 2001 national cham
pion Brigham Young competed
at last year's Invitational, the
Cougars have declined to send a
team to this year's event. At last
year's race, the Cardinal easily de
feated BYU by 64 points in the
6,000-meter event and by 13
points in the 4,000-meter event.
In cross country, the first run
ner to cross the finish line receives
one point, and each subsequent
runner receives an additional
point. The team's top five plac
ings are tallied and the team with
the lowest score wins.
Victories on the magnitude of
64 points thereby represent a
very comfortable margin. How
