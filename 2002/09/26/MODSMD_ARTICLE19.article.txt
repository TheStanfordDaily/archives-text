After dominating the Cal State-
Fullerton Invitational to open its
season, the Stanford men's cross
country squad returns to action at
the 29th annual Stanford Invita
tional as the top-ranked team in
the nation.
With the return of some of its
top runners from last year's na
tional runner-up squad, the Car
dinal hopes to continue its win
ning ways this Saturday. The team
will divide its members between
the 4,000-meter and the 8,000-
meter courses set on the Stanford
Golf Course.
At the 2001 Invitational, the
team swept the short- and long
course races. Junior Grant Robi
son won the 4,000-meter race,
and junior lan Dobson placed
second in the 8,000 race to lead
the Cardinal.
"This is a good opportunity to
get guys on the course. We should
be running most of the team," said

director of cross country Vin
Lananna.
Stanford will face other nation
ally-ranked teams at the Invita
tional, with the strongest chal
lengers being New Mexico and
Cal Poly, who are both tied for
30th in the latest national poll.
New Mexico's All-American Matt
Gonzales is expected to make a
run at an individual title.
UC-Santa Barbara and UC-
Davis are also expected to field
strong teams.
Sophomore Ryan Hall will lead
the Stanford roster in the short
course race. Hall, the lone fresh
man on last year's team, recorded
the third fastest 1,500-meter time
ever fora prep runner before ar
riving at Stanford.
Senior Setli Hejny and junior
Adam Tenforde will lead the Car
dinal in the long race. Hejny is an
All-American in track and one of
only two seniors on the squad. He
placed 43rd at last year's NCAA
Championships. Tenforde won
the Fullerton Invitational on Aug.
31 and claimed All-American sta
tus in the 10,000 meters in out
door track last season.
Robison, last year's short
course champion, will not be rac
ing on Saturday.
