After dominating the Cal State-
Fullerton Invitational to open its
season, the Stanford men's cross
country squad returns to action at
the 29th annual Stanford Invita
tional as the top-ranked team in
the nation.
With the return of some of its
top runners from last year's na
tional runner-up squad, the Car
dinal hopes to continue its win
ning ways this Saturday. The team
will divide its members between
the 4,000-meter and the 8,000-
meter courses set on the Stanford
Golf Course.
At the 2001 Invitational, the
team swept the short- and long
course races. Junior Grant Robi
son won the 4,000-meter race,
and junior lan Dobson placed
second in the 8,000 race to lead
the Cardinal.
"This is a good opportunity to
get guys on the course. We should
be running most of the team," said

director of cross country Vin
Lananna.
Stanford will face other nation
ally-ranked teams at the Invita
tional, with the strongest chal
lengers being New Mexico and
Cal Poly, who are both tied for
30th in the latest national poll.
New Mexico's All-American Matt
Gonzales is expected to make a
run at an individual title.
UC-Santa Barbara and UC-
Davis are also expected to field
strong teams.
Sophomore Ryan Hall will lead
the Stanford roster in the short
course race. Hall, the lone fresh
man on last year's team, recorded
the third fastest 1,500-meter time
ever fora prep runner before ar
riving at Stanford.
Senior Setli Hejny and junior
Adam Tenforde will lead the Car
dinal in the long race. Hejny is an
All-American in track and one of
only two seniors on the squad. He
placed 43rd at last year's NCAA
Championships. Tenforde won
the Fullerton Invitational on Aug.
31 and claimed All-American sta
tus in the 10,000 meters in out
door track last season.
Robison, last year's short
course champion, will not be rac
ing on Saturday.
" My training is not where we want
it at this point," Robison said. "So I
will Ik" making a later debut. Overall,
though, this team is in better shape
than any other team I've seen."
The Stanford Invitational will
also mark the debut of the 2002 re
cruiting class, which consists of eight
runners, including five Footlocker
National High Sch(x>l Cross Coun
try Championship finalists and five
state champions.
Besides handling the normal
stresses of being a freshman on the
Farm, these recruits must also ad
just to being in an entirely new train
ing and racing environment. Na
tionally acclaimed in high school,
they arrive at Stanford where they
might not be the top in the nation,
or even on their team.
"It's a bit intimidating. There are
some really good runners here,"
said freshman Brett Gotcher. "But
the guys are so outgoing. [Training
with the team at Mammoth] was a
nice way to get an icebreaker."
Gotcher and fellow freshman
Peter Meindl will be running unat
tached, along with the other fresh
men and some of the upperclass
runners who have not used a red
shirt year.
"We want to preserve redshirt
status on these guys and just get
them going," Lananna said. "We
can still run them in the same race,
just in different uniforms, and they
don't score."
Many teams redshirt their
freshmen because of the in
creased racing distance and high
er level of competition.
In high school, most races are
5,000 meters, while at the col
lege-level races are 8,000 or
10,000 meters.
"It's a whole new experience,"
said Gotcher. "You just have to feel
everything out and see how it goes."
The men open up competi
tion with the 4,000 meter race at
4:30 p.m..
