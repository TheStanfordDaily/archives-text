# Yamasaki ready for a happier homecoming

### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Lindsey Yamasaki's last memo
ry of McArthur Court isn't a very
good one. Her most recent en
counter with the Oregon arena was
last March during the Pacific-10
Conference Women's Basketball
Tournament, which was hosted by
the Ducks.

Women's Volleyball
at Oregon St., Friday, 7:00 p.m.
at Oregon, Saturday, 7:00 p.m.

Having had an emergency ap
pendectomy just a few days earlier,
the senior guard was stuck on the
sidelines, leaving the Cardinal
without its top scorer from the reg
ular season. Yamasaki could only
watch as her Stanford team fell in
the finals to Arizona State for its

only Pac-10 loss of the year, coming
in its last game before the NCAA
tournament, no less.
Yamasaki did return for the
Cardinal's run in the NCAA tour
nament, but it seemed that the last
college sports memory for the Ore
gon City native in her home state
would be a bitter one.
But seven months later, Yamasa
ki finds herself with a most unex
pected chance to rewrite that final
()regon memory, and in a way that
few would have predicted: wearing
a Stanford volleyball jersey.
After facing Oregon State (5-5,
0-2 Pac-10) tomorrow, the No. 4
Cardinal volleyball team (10-1, 1-0
Pac-10) will head to McArthur
Court to face the Ducks (9-5, 0-2)
on Saturday, as Yamasaki makes
her first visit to Eugene as a volley
ball player in nearly three years.
"It's nice to get a chance to get

one last victory on that lloor," Ya
masaki said. "Oregon has been
pretty harsh to play at. They're
very loyal Ducks fans, and since my
freshman year, they've heckled me
and hated me since I'm from Ore
gon, and I didn't go there."
The people in Oregon will sure
be surprised to see her. Even at
Stanford, people were caught oil
guard by Yamasaki's return to the
Cardinal volleyball squad.
Coming to Stanford as a two
sport athlete in 1998, Yamasaki
hung up the spandex and the knee
pads after her second year with the
volleyball team in 1999 (she red
shirted in 1998) to focus on basket
ball. It seemed like a bold move
since she had started at outside hit
ter on the 1999 squad that had ad
vanced to the NCAA champi
onship game.
But the decision paid off, as Ya
masaki became one of the most
dominant players in Pac-10 basket
ball, earning first-team All-Confer
ence and honorable mention All-
America honors in her final year of
basketball eligibility.
At the end of the year, she was
selected in the second round of the
WNBA Draft by the Miami Sol. Ya
masaki went on to average 3.5
points per game in 15 games with
the Sol in her rookie season this
past summer.
As the WNBA season winded
down, Yamasaki made plans to re
turn to Stanford, primarily to finish
up her undergraduate degree. But
she had an odd desire as well, one
that she had expressed to Stanford
coach John Dunning last spring.
She had a year of volleyball eligi
bility left (though she wasn't eligi
ble to receive a scholarship); why
not use it?
"I wanted to play both sports for
four years, so I had the desire and I
had the chance to do it," Yamasaki
said. "This seemed like the perfect
thing."
The calls were made, the clear
ances were arranged, and Yamasa
ki was back on the volleyball court
for the first time in nearly three

years just days before Stanford's
season began.
And it's been a welcome transi
tion back to the world of college
sports, to say the least.
"It's less intimate [in the pros].
It's definitely a job," she said. "It's
not fun meal times and 'Let's get to
gether on Friday night.' People are
married; they have their lives. It's
still the real world even though it's
professional sports. College is so
fun. Everything is right there for
you."
Yamasaki is mostly playing in a
reserve role this year behind All-
American outside hitters Logan
Tom and Ogonna Nnamani. Ya
masaki did start several matches
earlier this month while Tom was
playing with the U.S. national team
at the World Championships, pick
ing up a career-high 16 kills against
San Jose State on Sept. 6.
Despite her limited playing
time, Yamasaki has relished the
chance to be back among college
athletes, and her teammates have
been more than glad to have her
along for the ride as Stanford de
fends its national championship
from last year.
"I've really respected [Yamasa
ki] as an athlete here. To get the
chance to be her teammate is really
neat," Nnamani said. "She's so
much fun off the court , and she's
so much about business on the
court. It's great to have her here."
The Cardinal shouldn't have
too much trouble getting redemp
tion for Yamasaki in Oregon on
Saturday.
The Ducks are last in the Pac-10
in kills and are almost entirely re
liant on middle blocker Lindsay
Closs, who leads the team with 4.23
kills per game, to carry the offense.
That could spell trouble for Ore
gon when Closs is facing a double
block from Stanford, the Pac-10
blocking leader, on every set she
gets.

whole lot of offense to brag about
either. The Beavers are only hit
ting .230 on the season.
Oregon State is also last in the
Pac-10 in blocking, which along
with die Beavers' offensive trou
bles points to one thing: a com
plete lack of size in the Corvallis
squad. Only three players on its
roster top out at over six feet tall
(compared to nine on the Cardi

rial's), meaning that the Stanford
attackers are going to be hard to
slow at the net.
The Beavers make up for their
like of size with their incredible de
fense, averaging a whopping 18
digs per game.
"The Oregon schools are defi
nitely great defensive schools,"
said Stanford senior outside hit
ter Ashley Ivy. "Most schools
we've played against are great de
fensive programs. We'll have to
find the holes in the court and
that could be tougher, but it's cer
tainly do-able."
