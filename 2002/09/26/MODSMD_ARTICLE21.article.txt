# You can teach an old Sears Cup new tricks
## 
### 
As long as freshman inad
vertently lock themselves
out of their rooms, there
will be one thing in college
sports you can set your watch to:
Stanford winning the Sears Direc
tors' Cup come June.
Last year's runaway victory
made it eight straight for the Car
dinal, which has maintained a
stranglehold on the hefty hard
ware among Division I schools
since North Carolina won the inau-

gural Cup in 1994.
The Sears Cup,
which is awarded
based on a school's
performance in 20
different men's
and women's
sports, is present
ed each year by
Sears and the Na
tional Association

of Collegiate Directors of Athletics
to the best overall collegiate athlet
ics programs in Divisions I, II and
111.
There is no doubt that if Sears
sponsored the award back when its
catalog provided the first opportu
nity for many in this country to re
ceive "store bought" clothes, sever
al would've turned up in Jane Stan
ford's time capsule this past spring
with the notes "Leland's paper
weights" attached.
Sure enough, a quick glance at
the national rankings for the inter
collegiate sports in season reveals
the inevitable Stanford romp is on
yet again. Six Stanford squads are
currently ranked in the top four
nationally.
Before winning becomes rou
tine and goes completely unno
ticed around the Farm, we should
celebrate with a little more hoopla
than the understated procession
onto the field at halftime of the
homecoming football game.
This is Stanford; let's get cre
ative. A few suggestions:

A Sears Cup Committee should
be created, much like the Axe
Committee that hands out foam
axes at Big Game. Said committee
could parade the Cups to house
meetings across campus.
Fear not you readers who en joy
guest a cappella performances and
random people begging for house
funds at these weekly gatherings.
Stanford's plethora of a cappella
groups could use a shot of original
ity, and a creative song about Sears
Cups is just the ticket. This sounds
like a project for the baseball uni
form-wearing Mendicants.
Throwing money into a Cup
would also make helping fund the
latest Greek-sponsored "charity"
event all the more attractive. Call
me the 1 louse Meeting Liaison a la
Van Wilder.
Is there any way the award
could be changed to the Sears
Saucer fora few years? At the very
least someone should check with
Sears about getting one in a differ
ent color every so often. Fora spon
sor with annual revenue of nearly
$40 billion, I don't think this is ask
ing too much.
Eight Sears Cups could hold
Gatorade on the Stanford sideline.
Heck, use them to hold Gatorade
on the visitors' sideline, too, so op
posing teams can get a good look at
the forever unattainable. Buddy
Teevens being doused with
Gatorade from one of those babies
in the Rose Bowl would be priceless.
Of course, Gatorade in the Sears
Cups is more likely than Stanford
in the Rose Bowl, but remember,
towards the beginning ol every sea
son, the Cup is half full, not half
empty. Dare to dream, Cardinal
fans, dare to dream.
Why not spice up the halfiime
promotions at Maples Pavilion?
Who isn't tired of seeing little kids
race to half-court to put on over


Stott Allen
sized Jason and Jarron Collins jer
seys. Keep the kids, but have the lit
tle tots compete to down the most
Sears Cups full of milkshake in two
minutes instead. Follow that up
with seeing who in the 6th Man
Club can hit the half-court shot for
tuition after chugging a Sears Cup
full ofbeer.
Maybe it's time to permanently
rename the prized Waterford crys
tal the Leland Cup, honoring the
first name of the University's
founder and the last of the athletic

director who has orchestrated this
unparalleled feat.
The Sears Cup streak has coin
cided with an unprecedented seven
straight Big Game victories, which
has prompted talk the last few years
about how the football rivalry with
that school across the Bay is dead.
T lie Bears' early success on the
gridiron this year has likely put that
belief into hibernation.
It's not that the Sears Cup rival
ry is dead, it was just never alive —
and never will be.

Scott Allen has never won any Sears
Cups, but that IM soccer championship
last year was pretty sweet. E-mail him at
ssallen @sta nford.edu.
