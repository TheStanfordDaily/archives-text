Have you ever gone into a test
feeling really confident about it?
Even though you figured it would
be tough, you prepared hard and
just knew you were going to ace it,
and yet, in the end, the success you
had hoped for just wasn't there?

Women's Golf
Mason Rudolph Championships
1. Vanderbilt — 878
2. Arizona — 887
13. Stanford — 948

The Stanford women's golf team
got a taste of that same disappoint
ment in its season opener earlier this
week. While participating for the
first time in the Mason Rudolph
Championships in Franklin, Tenn.,
the Cardinal shot a final-round 312
on Tuesday en route to a 948 for the
three-round event.
That score was only good
enough to keep the Cardinal out of
the cellar, as it finished 13th out of
14 in the team competition. The
Cardinal had lofty hopes for the
event, with coach Caroline O'Con
nor saying the team was "definitely
looking fora top-five [finish]."
As expected, the Vanderbilt
team played well on its home turf
and took home top team honors.
Ranked ninth nationally in the
Golfworld preseason poll, the
Commodores appeared to strug
gle early, carding a 14-over-par
302 for the opening 18 holes.
Vanderbilt's Courtney Wood,
the individual champion, admit
ted, "We just weren't ready for the
first round. This course played
tough with the wind coming in the
opposite direction. We didn't ad
just quickly to the cool tempera
ture."
However, Vanderbilt blazed
through the second round in an

impressive 3-under-par 285, gain
ing ground on then-first-place Ari
zona. Saving the best for last, the
Commodores took charge in the
final round by shooting a tidy 291
fora three-day total of 878, while
other contenders were blown away
in the windy conditions.
Stanford's Pacific-10 Confer
ence rival Arizona shot 887 for the
tournament, just nine strokes off
the winning pace fora second
place finish. Oregon Suite topped

the Cardinal by a mere two strokes,
shooting 946 during the two days.
In the individual competition,
junior Kim Kouwabunpat led the
way for the Cardinal, shooting
rounds of 80-71-80 to finish with a
15-over-par 231, placing 32nd
overall.
Fellow junior Angela Rho card
ed a 240 for the event, landing her
in a five-way tie for 57th.

The women's golf team did not live up to their own expectations at the Mason
Rudolph Championships. Having rebounded from a similarly disappointing
start last /ear, optimism on the team remains high.
Senior Kim Rowton was ex
pected to lead the Cardinal in its
season opener after coming off a
strong performance in last year's
NCAA Championships and a ded
icated off-season. But she shot a
237 (80-79-78) and slid into a tie
for 46th.
Sophomore Wendra Liang and
freshman Kelly Husted also com
peted. Liang shot 81-83-78 to fin
ish 63rd, while Husted, playing in
her first collegiate tournament, fin

ished 64th overall.
Despite a disappointing start to
the season, the team refused to
make excuses.
"We had gotten a lot of good
practice and competition in on
campus before we headed out to
Tennessee," Rho said. "We all
worked extremely hard on our
games before the tournament. We
prepared and gave it our best, and
it just didn't work out."
Although many teams in the
field at this week's tournament
opened their seasons a week earli
er at the NCAA Fall Preview, Rho
insisted that the Cardinal's late
start was not a factor in its perfor

mance.
Although their effort did not
create the desired result this week,
the Cardinal may be able to draw
some encouragement from recent
history.
Last season started out slowly as
well, with the Cardinal taking a
16th-place finish at the Fall Pre
view. However, the squad was able
to bounce back with a third-place
performance at the OSU Invita
tional a week later.
The team will look for some of
that same magic as it heads to
Tacoma, Wash., to play in the
Edean Ihlanfeldt Invitational,
starting Oct. 7.
