# Wall Street Journal gives GSB low marks
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford's Graduate School of
Business customarily places near
the top of national business-school
rankings, and it took the top spot
in the most recent study by U.S.
News & World Report. But a new
Wall Street Journal survey shows
that not everyone is enamored of
the GSB â€” the newspaper placed
the school near the bottom of its
latest national rankings, at No. 39.
The Journal's survey of busi
ness-school recruiters from
around the country ranked the
GSB below less-esteemed rivals

like UC-Berkeley, UC-Davis and
SUNY-Buffalo.
Andy Chan, direetor of the
GSB's Career Management Cen
ter, explained the discrepancies
as a product of the different
methodologies employed by
each publication.
"Each of the different surveys
uses different criteria," Chan said.
" The sources use different data to
measure and define the ratings
that they are creating."
I he Journal explained that it
based its rankings solely on the
subjective views of recruiters. U.S.
