# Wall Street Journal gives GSB low marks
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford's Graduate School of
Business customarily places near
the top of national business-school
rankings, and it took the top spot
in the most recent study by U.S.
News & World Report. But a new
Wall Street Journal survey shows
that not everyone is enamored of
the GSB — the newspaper placed
the school near the bottom of its
latest national rankings, at No. 39.
The Journal's survey of busi
ness-school recruiters from
around the country ranked the
GSB below less-esteemed rivals

like UC-Berkeley, UC-Davis and
SUNY-Buffalo.
Andy Chan, direetor of the
GSB's Career Management Cen
ter, explained the discrepancies
as a product of the different
methodologies employed by
each publication.
"Each of the different surveys
uses different criteria," Chan said.
" The sources use different data to
measure and define the ratings
that they are creating."
I he Journal explained that it
based its rankings solely on the
subjective views of recruiters. U.S.


ANDREA COX/The Stanford Daily
The sun shines brightly on the Graduate School of Business. Recent Wall
Street Journal rankings place the GSB at No. 39, as opposed to the top rank
ing given by U.S. News and World Report.
News, on the other hand, used sev
eral different measures, including
reputation as rated by peer acade
mics, reputation among recruiters,
mean starting salaries and job
placement rates.
"The way that [the Journal]
does the survey seems to be
weighted more toward recruiters'
experiences two to three years
ago and not the current period,"
Chan said.
"Looking at the 1999-2000 dot
com boom period, that was when
the students who were interview
ing could more easily get jobs with
start-up companies. The more tra
ditional companies did not have
very good success at recruiting
many people."
Sophomore Timnit Gebru
wondered how the position of a
school could vary so much be
tween studies.
"It seems just like the under
graduate college rankings,"
Gebru said. "You look on one list
and a school is here, and then it is

much lower or higher on another.
I don't see how they can get such
different results."
Chan pointed out that it is not
necessarily appropriate for people
to use any single ranking system in
evaluating schools.
"The reader has to decide
which of the surveys is measuring
what they are looking for,"he said.
" Try not to look too close at the rat
ings, but look at what your person
al needs are."
First-year GSB student Dan An
derson said he does not pay atten
tion to any ranking systems.
"All I am concerned with is what
1 am learning and how my educa
tion is progressing," Anderson
said. "I don't need a ranking to tell
me whether I'm having a valuable
experience or not, I can determine
that for myself."
Chan explained that such rank
ings are st ill of value, despite their
inevitable subjectivity. He said that
the GSB administration uses such
rankings as a starting point to ex
plore potential areas of improve
ment.
"I think we use the rankings as
indicators of perceptions," Chan
said. "We try to determine what

the reality is, and from that we
then work to try and improve.
"We definitely do not run our
operations or our business to opti
mize our ratings. The ratings don't
drive what we do. We want to do
the light thing, but the ratings give
us an idea of what to investigate
further to change."
According to Chan, some
changes to the GSB's Career Man
agement Office stemmed from the
Wall Street Journal's rankings.
"The career center stall at that
time was a different set of people,"
Chan said. "Some of the policies
and practices among the staff were
a little less flexible than what the
recruiters wanted.
"We have changed all that since
I arrived [as director]. Last year 90
percent of those who recruited
here rated their overall experience
as good to excellent."
Chan also described some of
the other changes that the GSB
has made in response to re
cruiter criticism.
"The overall facilities where the
interviewers conducted the inter
views were upgraded significant
ly," Chan said. "The interviewers
wanted internet access and noted

that even the quality of the food
supplied needed to be improved.
"With a customer-service fo
cused attitude, we have been
very responsive to recruiters' re
quests and are working in part
nership with them to make their
recruiting experience effective
and smooth."
Despite all the attention the
negative rankings have drawn,
students such as senior Srinivas
Panguluri say their view of the
GSB has been unaffected.
"I'm not worried at all," Pangu
luri said. "If I got [accepted] in
[the GSB], I'd go in a second.
Based on the amount of money
people make coming out of the
school and its job placement
record, it looks good. And the tech
sector is going to need tons of
MBAs once it rebounds."
As for the concerns with re
cruiters, Chan said he believes
all the problems have been
ironed out.
"I am very confident that any
recruiters who come to recruit at
Stanford will have a great experi
ence," Chan said. "We would love
to invite anyone who is recruiting
to give us a call."

ly," Chan said. "The interviewers
wanted internet access and noted

that even the quality of the food
supplied needed to be improved.
"With a customer-service fo
cused attitude, we have been
very responsive to recruiters' re
quests and are working in part
nership with them to make their
recruiting experience effective
and smooth."
Despite all the attention the
negative rankings have drawn,
students such as senior Srinivas
Panguluri say their view of the
GSB has been unaffected.
"I'm not worried at all," Pangu
luri said. "If I got [accepted] in
[the GSB], I'd go in a second.
Based on the amount of money
people make coming out of the
school and its job placement
record, it looks good. And the tech
sector is going to need tons of
MBAs once it rebounds."
As for the concerns with re
cruiters, Chan said he believes
all the problems have been
ironed out.
"I am very confident that any
recruiters who come to recruit at
Stanford will have a great experi
ence," Chan said. "We would love
to invite anyone who is recruiting
to give us a call."
