# Faculty plans Islamic studies program
## H&S to create two appointments for Islamic specialists; planners envision confederation of scholars 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Faculty from several departments in the
School of Humanities and Sciences are moving
toward the creation of an Islamic studies pro
gram, a program that will represent years of ef
fort to strengthen the study of Islam at Stanford
and may quell concerns that the University does
not give adequate attention to the Muslim world.
Planning for the program is in its nascent
stages — a committee to steer the program has
not yet been formed — but the architects envi
sion an entity that crosses the boundaries of
many disciplines to create a confederation of
scholars who study the various facets of Islam.
"The people who are behind this push to
strengthen Islamic studies at Stanford are real
ly talking about Islamic studies broadly under
stood," said Humanities and Sciences Assoc.
Dean for Undergraduate Studies Robert
Gregg, a professor of religious studies. "The
program in Islamic studies is not understood by
anybody who's talking about it to be focusing
[solely] in the religion of Islam," he said, em
phasizing that it will also study the different
facets of Islamic cultures through history, liter

at lire and other disciplines.
Most professors whose area of study involves
Islam, including faculty from the History, Cul
tural and Social Anthropology and Religious
Studies Departments, have collaborated to
form the program.
"Everyone around who is interested has
been in conversation about this," Gregg said.
While many of the universities Stanford
competes with for students, such as UC-Berke
ley, 1 larvard, Princeton and Duke, all have de
partments or programs in Near Eastern or
Middle Eastern Studies, Stanford has no such
entity. The only explicit degree students can
get in Islamic or Middle Eastern studies is a
minor in Middle Eastern Languages and Liter
atures, offered through the Language Center.
"Courses on the Middle East at Stanford
now consist of disparate offerings through dif
ferent departments — i.e., I listory, .Anthropol
ogy, [the] Language Center — with no overar
ching structure or degree-granting program,"
said Khalil Barhoum, coordinator of the
African and Middle Eastern Languages Pro
gram. "Although these courses till an important
gap, their high quality cannot make up for the
paucity of offerings or the lack of an overall
Middle Eastern theme in general."
Undergraduates wanting to specialize in a
study of Islam or the Middle East can do so only
by concentrating on those topics within an es
tablished department.
"The only viable way to really study the

Middle East at Stanford is to study the Arabic
language, study Hebrew [and] some anthro
pology with [CASA Prof.] Carol Delaney," said
History Prof. Joel Beinin. "Basically. . . [histo
ry] is the only department that is committed in
a full way to this part of the world."
With the exception of the History Depart
ment, which currently has two professors who
specialize in the Middle East and three others
whose scholarship deals with issues in the re
gion or in Islam, many departments on campus
do not have scholars of Islam. Neither the De
partment of Religious Studies nor the Depart
ment of Political Science has a faculty member
specializing in the Middle East or Islam.
I listory Assoc. Prof. Ahmad Dallal identified
the gap in the Department of Religious Studies
as one of the most important shortcomings of
Stanford's faculty.
"There are certainly gaps, but given our re
sources — our limited resources — we are quite
strong," Dallal said. But, he added, "[lslam is]
almost a fist of society, it's one of the largest re
ligions of the world. That's a glaring omission."
Dallal also identified literature as an area
where Islamic scholarship could be
strengthened.
Faculty have been aware of these weakness
es, and according to Gregg, have been advocat
ing for an expansion of Islamic scholarship for
years.
"Several of us on the faculty
over the last decade have been
pushing the University to
strengthen the study of Islam at
the University," Gregg said.
In the past, Gregg said, when
the Department of Religious Stud
ies was deciding how to best allo
cate its resources, it highlighted
Buddhism, Judaism and Christian
ity — in part because of UC-Berke
ley's strength in Islamic and Mid
dle Eastern studies. Because of this
decision, the Department of Reli
gious Studies now has no faculty
specializing in Hinduism, Confu
cianism or Islam. To compensate,
the Department brought iti visiting
faculty to address various topics on
Islam, but now, Gregg said, "We're
making the commitment that we
want Islam [to have a place in the
department]."
The School of Humanities and
Sciences has created two new fac
ulty appointments as part of the
developing Islamic: studies pro
gram, and an international search
for at least one of those positions
will begin next year.
"The search for an Islamic
scholar to join the Department of
Religious Studies will definitely

begin next year," Gregg said.
The second appointment is not
slotted fora specific department
but rather will go to the most qual
ified Islamic scholar that the
search generates, regardless of his
or her discipline.
A fundraising effort to create
the program has been underway
for several years, and Gregg em
phasized that the University's
commitment to the program (lid
not rise from a post-Sept. 11 ea
gerness to expand curricula.
"Before 9/11, we had already re
ceived a donation toward buildinga
program in Islamic studies, so there
was a deeper interest for moving
ahead with this initiative" he said.
However, Gregg also said that
the increased awareness of Islam
after the terrorist attacks have
added momentum to the pro
gram's development. .
"This initiative has been under
way and has been helped, in a per
verse and tragic way, by Sept. 11,"
he said.
The task now facing the devel
opers is to design a program that
will allow Stanford to provide a
unique contribution to the whole
study of Islamic scholarship.
"One of the interesting ques
tions here is, you're starting out
building a program — how do you
study all that might come under
the rubric of Islamic studies?"

Gregg said. He emphasized that it
is important for the program to be
well-rounded as opposed to focus
ing only on a current issue being
discussed in relation to Islam, such
as extremism.
During this academic year,
seven prominent Islamic scholars
from institutions with similar pro
grams will be lecturing on Islam, in
part, Gregg said, to provide differ
ent perspectives on the way acade
mia can approach I slain.
Gregg emphasized that, un
like the programs at other insti
tutions that focus on a region,
such as the Middle East, this pro
gram will focus on the culture of
Islam, which transcends geo
graphic boundaries.
"I think a lot of people assume
that a program in Islamic studies
and a program in Middle Eastern
studies are the same thing," he
said. " There is some overlap, but
the simple geographic scope
makes them dissimilar."
He added, "Islam by its very
nature is trans-regional and
transnational."
The program will focus not only
on the Middle East, but also on the
languages and cultures of South
Asia and other areas where Islam is
a fixture.
Gregg said it is unclear whether
Stanford's Islamic studies pro
gram will grant degrees.

as one of the most important shortcomings of
Stanford's faculty.
"There are certainly gaps, but given our re
sources — our limited resources — we are quite
strong," Dallal said. But, he added, "[lslam is]
almost a fist of society, it's one of the largest re
ligions of the world. That's a glaring omission."
Dallal also identified literature as an area
where Islamic scholarship could be
strengthened.
Faculty have been aware of these weakness
es, and according to Gregg, have been advocat
ing for an expansion of Islamic scholarship for
years.
"Several of us on the faculty
over the last decade have been
pushing the University to
strengthen the study of Islam at
the University," Gregg said.
In the past, Gregg said, when
the Department of Religious Stud
ies was deciding how to best allo
cate its resources, it highlighted
Buddhism, Judaism and Christian
ity — in part because of UC-Berke
ley's strength in Islamic and Mid
dle Eastern studies. Because of this
decision, the Department of Reli
gious Studies now has no faculty
specializing in Hinduism, Confu
cianism or Islam. To compensate,
the Department brought iti visiting
faculty to address various topics on
Islam, but now, Gregg said, "We're
making the commitment that we
want Islam [to have a place in the
department]."
The School of Humanities and
Sciences has created two new fac
ulty appointments as part of the
developing Islamic: studies pro
gram, and an international search
for at least one of those positions
will begin next year.
"The search for an Islamic
scholar to join the Department of
Religious Studies will definitely

begin next year," Gregg said.
The second appointment is not
slotted fora specific department
but rather will go to the most qual
ified Islamic scholar that the
search generates, regardless of his
or her discipline.
A fundraising effort to create
the program has been underway
for several years, and Gregg em
phasized that the University's
commitment to the program (lid
not rise from a post-Sept. 11 ea
gerness to expand curricula.
"Before 9/11, we had already re
ceived a donation toward buildinga
program in Islamic studies, so there
was a deeper interest for moving
ahead with this initiative" he said.
However, Gregg also said that
the increased awareness of Islam
after the terrorist attacks have
added momentum to the pro
gram's development. .
"This initiative has been under
way and has been helped, in a per
verse and tragic way, by Sept. 11,"
he said.
The task now facing the devel
opers is to design a program that
will allow Stanford to provide a
unique contribution to the whole
study of Islamic scholarship.
"One of the interesting ques
tions here is, you're starting out
building a program — how do you
study all that might come under
the rubric of Islamic studies?"

Gregg said. He emphasized that it
is important for the program to be
well-rounded as opposed to focus
ing only on a current issue being
discussed in relation to Islam, such
as extremism.
During this academic year,
seven prominent Islamic scholars
from institutions with similar pro
grams will be lecturing on Islam, in
part, Gregg said, to provide differ
ent perspectives on the way acade
mia can approach I slain.
Gregg emphasized that, un
like the programs at other insti
tutions that focus on a region,
such as the Middle East, this pro
gram will focus on the culture of
Islam, which transcends geo
graphic boundaries.
"I think a lot of people assume
that a program in Islamic studies
and a program in Middle Eastern
studies are the same thing," he
said. " There is some overlap, but
the simple geographic scope
makes them dissimilar."
He added, "Islam by its very
nature is trans-regional and
transnational."
The program will focus not only
on the Middle East, but also on the
languages and cultures of South
Asia and other areas where Islam is
a fixture.
Gregg said it is unclear whether
Stanford's Islamic studies pro
gram will grant degrees.
Faculty from several departments in the
School of Humanities and Sciences are moving
toward the creation of an Islamic studies pro
gram, a program that will represent years of ef
fort to strengthen the study of Islam at Stanford
and may quell concerns that the University does
not give adequate attention to the Muslim world.
Planning for the program is in its nascent
stages — a committee to steer the program has
not yet been formed — but the architects envi
sion an entity that crosses the boundaries of
many disciplines to create a confederation of
scholars who study the various facets of Islam.
"The people who are behind this push to
strengthen Islamic studies at Stanford are real
ly talking about Islamic studies broadly under
stood," said Humanities and Sciences Assoc.
Dean for Undergraduate Studies Robert
Gregg, a professor of religious studies. "The
program in Islamic studies is not understood by
anybody who's talking about it to be focusing
[solely] in the religion of Islam," he said, em
phasizing that it will also study the different
facets of Islamic cultures through history, liter

at lire and other disciplines.
Most professors whose area of study involves
Islam, including faculty from the History, Cul
tural and Social Anthropology and Religious
Studies Departments, have collaborated to
form the program.
"Everyone around who is interested has
been in conversation about this," Gregg said.
While many of the universities Stanford
competes with for students, such as UC-Berke
ley, 1 larvard, Princeton and Duke, all have de
partments or programs in Near Eastern or
Middle Eastern Studies, Stanford has no such
entity. The only explicit degree students can
get in Islamic or Middle Eastern studies is a
minor in Middle Eastern Languages and Liter
atures, offered through the Language Center.
"Courses on the Middle East at Stanford
now consist of disparate offerings through dif
ferent departments — i.e., I listory, .Anthropol
ogy, [the] Language Center — with no overar
ching structure or degree-granting program,"
said Khalil Barhoum, coordinator of the
African and Middle Eastern Languages Pro
gram. "Although these courses till an important
gap, their high quality cannot make up for the
paucity of offerings or the lack of an overall
Middle Eastern theme in general."
Undergraduates wanting to specialize in a
study of Islam or the Middle East can do so only
by concentrating on those topics within an es
tablished department.
"The only viable way to really study the

Middle East at Stanford is to study the Arabic
language, study Hebrew [and] some anthro
pology with [CASA Prof.] Carol Delaney," said
History Prof. Joel Beinin. "Basically. . . [histo
ry] is the only department that is committed in
a full way to this part of the world."
With the exception of the History Depart
ment, which currently has two professors who
specialize in the Middle East and three others
whose scholarship deals with issues in the re
gion or in Islam, many departments on campus
do not have scholars of Islam. Neither the De
partment of Religious Studies nor the Depart
ment of Political Science has a faculty member
specializing in the Middle East or Islam.
