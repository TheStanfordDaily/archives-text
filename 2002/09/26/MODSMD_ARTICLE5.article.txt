# Protesters rally against Bush's policies
## 
### MIKEY LEE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Dozens of members and sup
porters of the Peninsula Peace and
Justice Center turned out at Palo
Alto's Town and Country shop
ping complex yesterday to protest
the United States' plans for mili
tary action in Iraq.
"We call it a human billboard
demonstration," said Paul
George, the center's director, of
the relatively quiet protest. "You
can see why."
Yesterday's protest, which
lasted from 5-6:30 p.m., was just
the tip of the iceberg, according
to George.
"This is just the first of a very
intense series of activities aimed
at getting Congress to vote down
the current resolution [that al
lows President] Bush to engage in
this insane war idea of his,"
George said.
Hundreds of cars honked in re
sponse to signs urging them to do

so in the name of peace.
"We are forging already-mud
died waters by presuming that we
can achieve a goal by ousting one
man and using a military solution
before we have exhausted media
tion," said a woman who asked lo
be identified as Rainbow. "Our re

fusal to listen deeply is causing
people to suffer."
Rainbow carried a sign that
read "Out of control."
"[The United States is] out of
control, and we need to gel out of
control," she said.
"1 think that the people of the

world need to unite and [fight]
against a common foe," said a
man who asked to be referred to
as Galen. " That common foe is
global fascism.
"We don't have a democracy.
We are led by what I call a fascist
regime."
The center is working with
Stanford professors to coordinate
a teach-in on Oct. 13 at 12:30 p.m.,
George said.
"I'm sure there will be all kinds
of anti-war activity [in the future],"
he said. "The point of the teach-in
is to allow people to really explore
these issues past television."
"We intend to have ten differ
ent workshops, as well as [former
Chief UN Weapons Inspector in
Iraq] Scott Ritter, who is a very
vocal opponent and critic of Bush's
new war plan," he continued.
George said that prepara
tions for the teach-in began a
month ago.

"We realized [this] issue was
going to be growing in intensity, so
we began planning early," he said.
"It's now time for students to get
involved and to make sure that this
is theii* teach-in as well."
The first organizing meeting
for the teach-in will be held at 7
p.m. in Columbae today. George
said that the planning committee
would include students, faculty
and community members.
"[Today] there will be a demon
stration in San Mateo at Congress
man Tom Lantos' office," George
said. "He's the only congressman

in the Bay Area who has an
nounced support [fora warj. On
[Sept. 30] we'll be at Congress
woman Anna Eshoo's office."
The center is sponsoring two
additional events, the first of which
is a talk entitled "Before and After:
U.S. Foreign Policy and the Sep
tember 11 Crisis," given by the
Washington, D.C.-based Institute
for Policy Studies' Phyllis Bennis.
The talk will be held at Palo Alto's
First Presbyterian Church.
The second event is the pre
miere of "Power and Terror:
Noam Chomsky in Our Times,"
a film directed by Academy
Award nominee John Junker
man. The premiere will be held
on Nov. 6 at 7:30 p.m. at Span
genberg Theater.
