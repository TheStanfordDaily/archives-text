### MIKEY LEE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Dozens of members and sup
porters of the Peninsula Peace and
Justice Center turned out at Palo
Alto's Town and Country shop
ping complex yesterday to protest
the United States' plans for mili
tary action in Iraq.
"We call it a human billboard
demonstration," said Paul
George, the center's director, of
the relatively quiet protest. "You
can see why."
Yesterday's protest, which
lasted from 5-6:30 p.m., was just
the tip of the iceberg, according
to George.
"This is just the first of a very
intense series of activities aimed
at getting Congress to vote down
the current resolution [that al
lows President] Bush to engage in
this insane war idea of his,"
George said.
Hundreds of cars honked in re
sponse to signs urging them to do

so in the name of peace.
"We are forging already-mud
died waters by presuming that we
can achieve a goal by ousting one
man and using a military solution
before we have exhausted media
tion," said a woman who asked lo
be identified as Rainbow. "Our re

fusal to listen deeply is causing
people to suffer."
Rainbow carried a sign that
read "Out of control."
"[The United States is] out of
control, and we need to gel out of
control," she said.
"1 think that the people of the

world need to unite and [fight]
against a common foe," said a
man who asked to be referred to
as Galen. " That common foe is
global fascism.
"We don't have a democracy.
We are led by what I call a fascist
regime."
The center is working with
Stanford professors to coordinate
a teach-in on Oct. 13 at 12:30 p.m.,
George said.
"I'm sure there will be all kinds
of anti-war activity [in the future],"
he said. "The point of the teach-in
is to allow people to really explore
these issues past television."
"We intend to have ten differ
ent workshops, as well as [former
Chief UN Weapons Inspector in
Iraq] Scott Ritter, who is a very
vocal opponent and critic of Bush's
new war plan," he continued.
George said that prepara
tions for the teach-in began a
month ago.
