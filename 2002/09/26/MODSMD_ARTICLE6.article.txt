## Camping out to camp out 
### MICHELLE KELLER EDITORIAL STAFF 
Sophomore Kasia Bryce spreads
her sleeping bag on the rough, hard
tiles of the Main Quad. Around her
are other students chatting and
trading backpacking stories like old
war heroes. There is a nervous buzz
in the air as passersby give them
strange looks.
"Have more people arrived?" a
voice mumbles out from within a
blue sleeping bag.
Is this a strange sorority initia
tion rite? A crazy group of band
members? No, Bryce and her fel
low students are very eager to take
Wilderness Skills — part of the
Outdoor Education Program of
fered by the Geological Sciences
Department — that they are will
ing to camp out in the Quad to be
one of the lucky 11 students en
rolled in this popular course.
Students had to have signed
up by 8 a.m. Sept. 26 to be part of
the class.
"To my knowledge, I don't know

of anyone who has ever gotten into
the class who didn't camp out the
night before signups," said mechan
ical engineering graduate student
Brian Palminter, who has been
teaching in the program since the
spring of 1997.
Graduate student Matt Reiden
bach, also an instructor in the pro
gram, agreed with Palminter.
"What a better way to show your
willingness to get into a camping
class than to camp out for it?" he
said. "It's an initial investment fora
class that requires a good deal of
commitment."
Although offered by the Geolog
ical Sciences Department, Wilder
ness Skills (GKS 7 a,b,c) is a series of
student-run, one-unit courses that
focuseson backpacking, rock-climb
ing, telemarking and a variety of
other outdoor activities that may
even include skiing. The class is run
by l(i dedicated volunteer instruc
tors — both graduates and under
graduates— who plan, coordinate
and lead the course.
The fall class, for which Bryce is

applying, is a beginner backpacking
class that will introduce students
with little experience to living and
hiking in the great outdoors. Stu
dents meet once a week for two
hours on Wednesday nights to learn
about basic backcountry living skills,
including how to set up camp, what
to pack and how to administer first
aid, among other things.
They embark on four backpack
ing trips throughout the quarter,
giving the students a chance to put
all of these skills to use. The winter
quarter class is a beginner snow
camping class, and the course in the
spring is only offered to experi
enced backpackers, who must sub
mit an application.
One of the most important parts
of the Outdoor Education Pro
gram is fostering a community of
people who en joy spending time in
the backcountry.
"It's great that you can bring 11
completely different people togeth
er," Reidenbach said. "After the
