## Camping out to camp out 
### MICHELLE KELLER EDITORIAL STAFF 
Sophomore Kasia Bryce spreads
her sleeping bag on the rough, hard
tiles of the Main Quad. Around her
are other students chatting and
trading backpacking stories like old
war heroes. There is a nervous buzz
in the air as passersby give them
strange looks.
"Have more people arrived?" a
voice mumbles out from within a
blue sleeping bag.
Is this a strange sorority initia
tion rite? A crazy group of band
members? No, Bryce and her fel
low students are very eager to take
Wilderness Skills — part of the
Outdoor Education Program of
fered by the Geological Sciences
Department — that they are will
ing to camp out in the Quad to be
one of the lucky 11 students en
rolled in this popular course.
Students had to have signed
up by 8 a.m. Sept. 26 to be part of
the class.
"To my knowledge, I don't know

of anyone who has ever gotten into
the class who didn't camp out the
night before signups," said mechan
ical engineering graduate student
Brian Palminter, who has been
teaching in the program since the
spring of 1997.
Graduate student Matt Reiden
bach, also an instructor in the pro
gram, agreed with Palminter.
"What a better way to show your
willingness to get into a camping
class than to camp out for it?" he
said. "It's an initial investment fora
class that requires a good deal of
commitment."
Although offered by the Geolog
ical Sciences Department, Wilder
ness Skills (GKS 7 a,b,c) is a series of
student-run, one-unit courses that
focuseson backpacking, rock-climb
ing, telemarking and a variety of
other outdoor activities that may
even include skiing. The class is run
by l(i dedicated volunteer instruc
tors — both graduates and under
graduates— who plan, coordinate
and lead the course.
The fall class, for which Bryce is

applying, is a beginner backpacking
class that will introduce students
with little experience to living and
hiking in the great outdoors. Stu
dents meet once a week for two
hours on Wednesday nights to learn
about basic backcountry living skills,
including how to set up camp, what
to pack and how to administer first
aid, among other things.
They embark on four backpack
ing trips throughout the quarter,
giving the students a chance to put
all of these skills to use. The winter
quarter class is a beginner snow
camping class, and the course in the
spring is only offered to experi
enced backpackers, who must sub
mit an application.
One of the most important parts
of the Outdoor Education Pro
gram is fostering a community of
people who en joy spending time in
the backcountry.
"It's great that you can bring 11
completely different people togeth
er," Reidenbach said. "After the
first weekend, everyone knows
everything about each other; you
learn to trust other people very
quickly. Walls get broken down so
much faster when the only things
you have out there are the people
around you."
The class also teaches students
to become leaders of their own ex
peditions, so that they can share
with others the experiences they
themselves treasure.
"When I was [an OEP] student,
it was so easy to get outdoors once
[I was] part of this community,"
said senior Jill Redhage, a current
instructor of the program. People
were so giving; you would just meet
one person, and your opportuni
ties to go on trips would just expo
nentially expand.
"I didn't do any of this stuff be
fore the class," she added. "Now it's
my life."
Many of the students who take
the courses end up becoming in
structors of the program, or lead
ers in other outdoor programs of
fered nationwide. Palminter
teaches the course during the aca
demic school year and is a full-
Hedged instructor at the National
Outdoor Leadership School dur
ing the summer.
"We emphasize the leadership
part of the course," said senior
Sarah Schulman.
The last weekend trip that stu
dents take is an entirely student-co
ordinated trip — students choose
the location, organize the supplies
and decide on the trails the group
will take.
Dennis Bird, a Professor of Ge
ological and Environmental Sci
ences and the official adviser for
the course, believes that although
the students who take part in the
program love the course and
sometimes describe it as the "best
experience they had at Stanford,"
it is the instructors who reap some
of the most important lessons.

"Teaching skills, leadership
skills — these guys learn so much
by going on the trips and leading
students around. After each trip,
they are quite critical about the ex
perience and about each other,
and are able to gain so much from
their experiences," Bird said.
The instructors also play an im
portant role in the lives of the stu
dents taking the course, often help
ing them to develop their own
leadership skills and to improve
their confidence. Redhage remem
bers one trip where the group split
up into several search parties to
find an instructor.
She was paired with a girl who
had been quite timid throughout
the trip.
"After one hour of hiking with
her, 1 learned what she was excited
about, what her past was all about
[and] what her fears were," Red
hage said. "She felt so much more
confident after that time, knowing
that [the instructors] understood
her better."
Along with all of the serious
lessons, the instructors and stu
dents are still able to have plenty
of fun. Jacqueline Pratt, who took
the Advanced Skills class offered
in the spring, had many memories
to share.
"On the first snow trip, all of the
instructors wore leis and tropical
clothing and Andrew, one of the in
structors, towed a hibachi grill on
the sled behind him, just so we
could have a barbeque in the back
country," Pratt said, "112 thought
snow camping was a serious busi
ness, but I discovered that as long
as you are prepared, you can be
goofy, too."
Started about ten years ago,
the class has been running suc
cessfully under the advisorship of
Professor Bird.
"For people who are unde
clared, it's a great way to introduce
them to the natural sciences."
Efforts have been made to ex
pand the program — which cur
rently only allows 11 students to
take the course each quarter —
but it has turned out to be too

much work for even 16 instructors
to plan and coordinate multiple
trips in the backcountry. Only 11
students can go because many
parks have restrictions on the
number of people who can stay in
a campsite.
Back in the Quad, the students
are jittery with anticipation. Some
retreat into their sleeping bags,
having arrived at 4:30 p.m. By 9
p.m. there were already 12 stu
dents camping out and the atmos
phere was filled with anxiety each
time someone walked by.
Sophomore Linda Browning
plays her guitar, strumming tunes
to pass the time.
"I'm ready to meet other people
who like to do stuff outside and get
more experience backpacking,"
she said ."I'm also really excited to
do some of the rock-climbing I've
heard about."
Others, likejunior Kellea Miller,

have been waiting to take the class
for several years, but had simply
not found the time.
"I'm really eager to take the
class," Miller said. "I've done a lot
of backpacking before, but a lot of it
is about the community. Many of
the leaders are good friends of
mine, and I'm looking forward to
meeting more people."
Although it is too late to sign up
for this quarter's class, students
can camp out for next quarter's
class. Palminter stressed that
there are many opportunities for
other students to get outdoors
through Stanford.
"We also offer a series of back
country workshops throughout the
year, and students can always camp
out for the class in the winter — or
if they have experience, they can
apply for the class in the spring," he
said. "You can find so many oppor
tunities to go out there."
