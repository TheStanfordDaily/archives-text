# Israel wounds 35 in missile attack in Gaza

### 
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel tried to kill
the mastermind of the Hamas bombing campaign
yesterday, firing two missiles from a helicopter into a
car in crowded Gaza City and killing two bodyguards.
Thirty-five bystanders were wounded but the fate of
the Palestinian militant remained uncertain.
A senior Palestinian security official said Israel's tar
get, 37-year-old Mohammed Deif, escaped with mod
erate injuries. Israeli police sources said the Israeli mil
itary told them Deif — atop Israel's wanted list for
years — was killed. The military had no comment.
1 lamas official Abdel Aziz Rantisi said Deif was not
even in the car. But he said the group would avenge
the attack nevertheless. "We will hit Tel Aviv. We will
hit everywhere."
Hamas and the Palestinian Authority are rivals,
possibly explaining the different versions of Deif s fate.
In other violence, four Palestinians — including
two gunmen, a civilian and a baby — and one Israeli
were reported killed. Israel maintained its strangle
hold on Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's headquar
ters in the West Bank town of Ramallah in defiance of
Tuesday's U.N. Security Council resolution to end
the siege.
Two helicopters appeared in the sky over Gaza just
after 1:30 p.m., firing missiles that blew apart a green
Mercedes sedan and sent a plume of white smoke
over the Sheik Radwan neighborhood.
"Suddenly we heard the sound of a big explosion,"
said Mohammed Hajar, a hairdresser working in the
area. "When I ran out, a second explosion took place."
Blood, body parts and shrapnel were strewn across
a wide area and nearby windows were shattered. A
large crowd, confused and angry, gathered as rescue
workers led the wounded to ambulances.
One man leapt on a car and shouted, "God is
great."
Hamas sources identified the two dead men as
members of Hamas, Abdel Rahim Hamdan, 27, and
Issa Abu Ajra, 29. Rantisi said they were Deifs body
guards.
More than a dozen children were wounded in the
attack, the latest in a series of assaults the Israeli mili
tary calls "targeted killings" of Palestinians.
The most controversial, a strike in Gaza that killed
1 lamas militant Salah Shehadeh, also killed nine chil
dren and five adult civilians.
In the past two years, at least 78 wanted Palestini
ans and 52 bystanders have been killed in such at
tacks, which the Palestinians deride as a policy of as
sassination. Human rights groups have condemned
the policy.
"Today's attack is another example that shows
clearly that the Israeli army doesn't care about the life
of the innocent Palestinian victims," said Samieh
Mouhsen of the Palestinian Society for the Protection
of Human Rights. "It constitutes a policy of lawless
disregard for the most fundamental human rights,
the right to life."
Israel says the targeted killings are its best means of
preventing terror attacks, and accuses Arafat's Pales
tinian Authority of doing nothing against the radical
groups and even encouraging them. Palestinians
argue Israel's travel restrictions and military strikes
have left their security services powerless.
Israelis accuse Deif of having a role in dozens of
suicide attacks over the past six years. He survived an
Israeli airstrike earlier this year.
Earlier strikes on top Hamas figures have led to in
creased violence. When Israel killed Deifs mentor
Yehiyeh Ayyash in 1996, Hamas responded with four
suicide bombings that killed dozens of Israelis.
