DELACROIX, La. (AP) â€” Tropical
Storm Isidore blew ashore yesterday with
near hurricane-force wind, spinning off tor
nadoes, swamping the Gulf Coast with 15
inches of rain and knocking out power to
more than 200,000 homes and businesses.
Thousands fled their homes in Louisiana,
Mississippi and Alabama before the storm
reached land at 3 a.m. Floodwaters swept
through houses in communities across the
region and rose to the windshields of cars in
low-lying New Orleans.
"I don't know whose they are, but I've got
three rec liner chairs in my yard," Susan Ser
pas said in Delacroix, a fishing town east of
New Orleans, where screen doors, mailbox
es and furniture bobbed in 3 112 eet of water.
Gov. Mike Foster said the storm did at
least $18 million in damage in Louisiana,
including $3.7 million in lost sugar cane.
Foster said the damage estimate will
grow, and he was seeking a federal disas
ter declaration.
Isidore was packing wind up to 65 mph
when it arrived, below the 74 mph thresh
old of a hurricane. The storm lost its
punch and was downgraded to a tropical
depression as it moved pastjackson, Miss.,
in late afternoon.
Forecasters said the storm would slide
into the Ohio Valley by the weekend, bring
ing heavy rain to the Midwest and the

Northeast. Up to 8 inches of rain were lore
cast in Tennessee.
Several tornadoes spun out of the storm
and touched clown in the Florida Panhan
dle. One hit a barn near Graceville, Fla., in
juring a farmer, while another damaged
more than 20 homes in Santa Rosa Beach.
Mississippi officials also said floodwa
ters also kept them from reaching a 67-
year-old man who died of cardiac arrest
early yesterday.
I'he wind toppled trees in Alabama and
gusts of4o mph hit Birmingham, more than
200 miles from the coast. Most schools in the
region were closed.
Mississippi kept its float ing casinos shut
tered. One, the Treasure Bay in Biloxi,
sustained a 12-foot gash when the surging
sea drove its entrance ramp deep into one
of its walls. Backup security cables were the
only thing keeping the casino barge from
floating away.
"This was totally unexpected, this much
water," Bernard Carlson, 71, said as he
watched the swollen Tchoutacaboufla River
from the upstairs porch of his flooded home
near Biloxi. City officials estimated 50 to 75
homes were damaged by floodwaters.
Foster said Port Fourchon appeared to be
hit hard by surging tides. The huge oil ter
minal on the Gulf Coast is a clearinghouse
for about 13 percent of the nation's crude.
