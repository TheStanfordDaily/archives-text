## CAMPUS VIEWPOINT Enough with the bonding games: the ice has been broken 
### TREVOR SUTTON GUEST COLUMNIST 
Break out the balloons, bring on the
band. The freshmen have arrived, and
with them the same rituals and rites of pas
sage all of us know and some of us love.
Who among us wasn't moved, for
better or worse, by a platoon of gyrating
red-shirted OV's? Who among us watched
the educational antics of residential staff
and kept a dry eye? Who among us doesn't
know the words to "Hail, Stanford, Hail?"
Never mind all that. No matter how you
felt about the ocean of cheer known as Ori
entation, one aspect of the fun-filled wel
come-to-college experience always strikes
a sour note. No, it's not the first icebreak
er, always a hand-wringing ordeal for both

those who've won Westinghouse prizes
and those who haven't. Nor is it the second
icebreaker, at which point you're sup
posed to remember Gladys from Irvine's
most embarrassing moment was choking
on a cookie-dough nugget at Coldstone
Creamery. It might not even be the third
icebreaker, when you realize people are
getting tired of seeing yon juggle dining
hall apples, and you must discover a new
"unique talent" before someone tosses the
pillow your way.
No. Even after Orientation has official
ly ended, the icebreakers continue. And
it's the fourth, the fifth, the ninth ice
breakers that strain the collective patience
of the dorm and shamelessly exploit what
ever dark corner of your soul you haven't
exposed to the scrutinizing eyes of that

cute senior next door. How tired every
one becomes of the same sagging rou
tines, hastily improvised and nervously
executed: Pass the flashlight; toss the
jacks; form a circle; bounce the ball; hike
up that hill; gather round that stone; pick
one of eight flavors of Skittles. It's like
kindergarten all over again, only with
more personal anguish and fewer juice
and-cracker breaks.
For Pete's sake, the ice is broken. In
fact, it's been broken fora while and is now
being ground into a fine powder perfect
for snow cones, smoothies and other re
freshing summer concoctions.
Not that icebreakers are inherently
worthless. The first round is especially
helpful in dragging future CS majors out
into the open so the rest of the freshman

community can watch their minty-green
complexions first yield to the warm Cali
fornia sunshine. Perhaps the second has
some value in reminding everyone of ev
eryone else's name â€” who wants to share
a bathroom cubby with a total stranger?
All the same, these mandatory exercises
in camaraderie quickly transform into a se
ries of hollow gestures if not nipped in the
bud early on. Especially for shy people, it
can prove an endless torment. For dull
people it's even worse. Shy and dull: God
help you.
Riding a unicycle through a hoop of fire
because you love to entertain is generally a
good move. Attempting the same maneu
ver because the eyes of the tribe are upon
you is another thing entirely.
Simply put, friendships and communi

ties form gradually, organically and with
out micro-management or forced interac
tion. Icebreakers, in my experience and in
the experiences of many others, put a me
chanical, glib and unnecessarily awkward
spin on what should be one of the most ex
hilarating aspects of freshman year: meet
ing, talking and ultimately befriending a
talented and generally amicable group of
people.
The first few weeks of college can be a
good time for almost everybody. Don't
ruin it by turning an opportunity to social
ize into a talk show or three-ring circus.
After all, some talents are worth keeping
private.
