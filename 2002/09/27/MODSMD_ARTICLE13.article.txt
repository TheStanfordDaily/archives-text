# New student health center improves space and privacy
## 
### SARAH PAPÉ EDITORIAL STAFF 
Cowell Health Center is now a thing of the past.
It was demolished this summer to make way for the
parking lot of the new $9.6 million Allen G. Vaden
Health Center, located next door to the old Cowell
building.
The new 30,000 sq. ft. health center is the same
si/.e as Cowell, but, according to Ira Friedman, di
rector of Vaden, the distribution of space is far
more efficient.
"The old Cowell center was basically obsolete,"
Friedman said. "It had seismic problems and was
pretty inaccessible to the disabled. The exam rooms
were unique in how small they were, and some did
not have the basics, like a sink to wash your hands.
. . . Comfort and privacy should be improved for
students now."
The new building offers the same services as the
old building, Friedman said, with added offices,
exam rooms and space for psychotherapy and sup
port groups.
A large donation from the family of Val Vaden,
an alumnus (BA '82, MBA '91), made the new cen
ter possible. The building is named after his moth
er, Allene G. Vaden, who passed away several years
ago from breast cancer.
Allene Vaden earned her doctorate at Texas
Tech and went on to be a professor and re
searcher who published 60 professional papers
and once served as the president of the American

Dietetic Association.
"The more I learn about her life and her accom
plishments," Friedman said, "the more 1 under
stand the parallels with the work that we do at the
health center — care, support and education for
Stanford students — as well as the values that in
spire those of us who work here."
The Vaden family was present last year at a cer
emony marking the beginning of construction. At
the ceremony, Val Vaden spoke about his mother.
"My mother was a modern, professional, awe
somely driven woman who spent a lifetime caring
for the health and well-being of others," Vaden
said. "In the end, as it will for all of us, her body
failed her.
"Her decisions at that time would've surely ben
efited from more modern medication, treatment
and counseling.... I hope that her entire life, per
sonal and professional, and also including her
death, can provide inspiration for the mission of
this student health center."
Though work is still being done on the exterior,
Vaden opened this summer after over a year of
construction.
The Sexual Ilealth Peer Resource Center is now
located on the second floor, to the right of the
lobby.
"Everything is pretty easy to find, unlike in the
old building," Friedman said.
Their new Web site, vaden.stanford.edu, is still
under construction, but their new phone number
V-A-D-E-N, or 8-233, is up and running.
