# Mirrielees parking woes increase
## 
### ANTHONY HA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Mirrielees, recendy renovated to
house triples instead of doubles,
found its population jump by over
50 residents this fall. This increase,
combined widi the elimination of
about 20 parking spaces to make
room for new bicycle racks, has re
sulted in a parking crunch at the up
perclass apartment complex.
Several Mirrielees residents com
plained that the lot is often filled, and
that illegally parked cars often line
the curb in front of the new racks.
"When I moved in a week before
school started, it was great," said
sophomore Katie Justus. "But once
other people moved in, I had to
park in Escondido Village. Now
even EV is filled, so I have to park in
Wilbur."
Senior Monique Barakat has also
been completely unable to find
parking since die majority of stu
dents moved in.
"It's frustrating to always have to
park half-a-mile from the apart
ments," Barakat said.
According to Director of Parking
and Transportation Services Brodie
Hamilton, the decision to replace
parking spaces with bicycle racks
was made with the population in
crease specifically in mind.
"When this change was planned,
we identified how many new people
would be living in Mirrielees, and it
was decided that it was necessary to
add racks in order to meet people's
bike parking needs," Hamilton said.
"As with most buildings on campus,
students might not be able to park
right around Miirielees, but they

should Ik* able to find spaces within
a couple of minutes walk."
Hamilton added that parking in
die area should improve as soon as
parking lots on Bowdoin Street are
expanded and the modules are re
moved from the Wilbur lot.
Crystal Maglio, a resident assis
tant and two-year resident of Mir
rielees, agreed that bicycle parking
was a problem last year, but said that
the University did not properly con
sider the concerns of students.
"They told us that we would be
losing a few parking spots, but we
had no idea that so many would be
gone," she said. "And parking was
also a huge problem last year; it was
impossible to find a parking spot
after dinner, when everyone was
home. Now people can't even find
parking in the afternoon, and they
have to park even farther away."
She added, "It's really bad when
you're coming home alone at night.
Parking is worse, and if you're a girl,
it may not be safe to walk by yourself.
It's not just that something might
happen, but also that you feel un
comfortable having to do that."
In addition, Maglio objected to
the way in which the University re
sponded to complaints.
"We've complained to housing
services, but they think that students
can just park in other lots," she said.
"The administration does not real
ize that this is an issue."
As an example of why the park
ing situation at Mirrielees is particu
larly difficult, several residents
pointed to t heir lack of a meal plan,
which they said makes driving a ne

cessity.
"We have to find a way to eat, and
it's hard to t ide a bike with grocery
bags hanging off the handles," Jus
tus said.
When asked about the grocery
needs of Mirrielees residents,
Hamilton argued that students do

not need cars in order to do their
shopping.
"There's the Shopping Express
on weekends, as well as Marguerite
routes to downtown Palo Alto,"
Hamilton said. "There are ways of
getting [to supermarkets]."
He concluded, "We understand
students' concern and appreciate
their patience. I hope that they un
derstand that we are trying to meet
their parking needs on a regional
basis."
