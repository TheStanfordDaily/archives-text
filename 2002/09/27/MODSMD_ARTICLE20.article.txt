# The 						dawning of a new era?... or not.

### BRENDA WALSH 
Get ready. Ryan Sands and Alice
Kim are the new editors of the Stanford In
termission. They have a powerful dream,
along with innovative ideas and the will to
make it happen. Their combined weight is
250 pounds.
And if they have to, they will slap you up
side your fool head.

Upon their appointment last
Wednesday, I was already sexually attract
ed to them. But after interviewing them, 1
became convinced that we had two dy
namos on our hands.
Before becoming co-editor of Intermis
sion, Ryan Sands had a stint as the lead
singer of Creed, until becoming disillu
sioned with his rock star life. Sands can
didly spoke of his experience in Creed.
"Although I still love God, I think it's
wrong to profess my love for Him in this
fashion.
I had a vision last February while eating
a miraculous fruit pie. I was floating above

Safeco Field during a Mariners game. Safe
co Field was actually God's hat, and with
that realization, I screamed. With the voice
of one thousand chiming bells, he told me
that my songs sucked. He was harsh."
I nodded sympathetically.
"God said I was not cool. But because He
is merciful, He told me what was cool. So I
decided that my mission on this Earth was
to share these cool things with the world.
What is cool? What God says is cool! Things
like samosas, Hayao Miyazaki and soft baby
kangaroos. Loud rock bands whose mem
bers use pseudonyms."

Co-editor Alice Kim broke in.
"All of these tilings and more we shall
present to the Stanford community in In
termission," she said, pounding her fist into
the table until it broke under the force. 1
gasped, for her blatant show of strength
was convincing and charismatic.
This is their mission. Ryan and Alice will
continuously bring you cool things. Per
haps some of these things will not be cool to
them, but always, they hope you or some
one else will find them good.

Besides all of the other things God men
tioned, they also will bring you all the best
and latest in movies, music, food, art, ex
plicit sex advice and all other entertain
ments. It's the beginning of a new age, and
with their stylish hair, his skinny pants and
her self-conscious gait, they will be the lead
ers of it.
Could anything stop these two? I ob
served a crack in their armor. While un

deniably sexy, Ryan and Alice are also in
credible nerds. Their laughter is uncom
fortably loud and nasal, their pants too
short for their socks. Both of them like
Mr. T and are acquainted with songs from
his solo career. Equipped with their
flawed genius, they will either rise to high
heights, or crash in the burning flames of
their nerdiness.
We shall soon see.
