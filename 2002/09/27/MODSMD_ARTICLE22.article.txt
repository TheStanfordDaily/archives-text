Gary, IN (March 5, 2002) — Frustra
tion over losing at a video game led a
Northwest Indiana man to punch a 2-
year-old boy to death, police said Mon
day.
Prosecutors in Gary, Ind., filed a mur
der charge Monday against Michael A.
Willis, 33, and a child neglect charge
against the toddler's mother, Phebe Wes
ley, 21.
Willis is accused of punching Kenneth
Coleman Jr. in the stomach and chest,-
lacerating his liver and causing massive
internal bleeding.
Kenneth — previously unable to walk
because of a medical condition-was pro
nounced dead last Wednesday, police
said.
"It's horrible," Gary police Sgt. Karen
Erickson said. "He had to hit the child
very, very hard to do this. Me used him as
a punching bag."
Willis originally told investigators that

Kenneth fell off a bed and struck a video
game controller with his stomach, police
said.
But Wesley then told police that she
saw Willis punch her son with his fist, ac
cording to an affidavit filed by Gary po
lice Detective Cpl. Lanita Titus in Lake
County Superior Court. He told her not
to worry and get Kenneth a bottle, which
she did, the affidavit said.
Police re-interviewed Willis and he
confessed to striking the toddler, Titus'
affidavit said.
Willis said he had been in bed playing
a Play Station game and grew upset be
cause he lost several times, according to
the affidavit. Willis said the boy was cry
ing. He "just wanted him to hush up," the
affidavit said.
Police said Willis faces up to 65 years in
prison if he is convicted of murder. Wes
ley could receive a 20-year sentence if
convicted of neglect.
