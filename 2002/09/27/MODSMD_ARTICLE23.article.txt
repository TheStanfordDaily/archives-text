# Kapur directs epic "Four Feathers"
## 
### RAMIN SETOODEH 
Shekhar Kapur, director of
"The Four Feathers," was search
ing for some strawberry jam to put
in his tea when I walked into his
suite at the Ritz Carlton in San
Francisco last month. He is gra
cious and charming, and the type
of storyteller who can really capti
vate his audience — through his
movies and his intellect.
We sat down, and as I reached
for my notebook, he asked me a
question.
"What is it that you liked about
this film?" Then he corrected him
self and said, "No, you're supposed
to ask me the questions."
I answered him anyway. The
premise was refreshing, I said, in
the sense that the film's hero, a
British soldier named Harry
Faversham (Heath Ledger),
doesn't want to fight in a war. And
that's not something you see every
day in the movies — where most
heroes are overtly patriotic and
never think twice about dying in
the battlefield.
"Exactly what you're saying is
what attracted me to the movie,"
Kapur said. "I don't like making
films about people who get over
everything in a simple aggressive
muscular way — and that's be
come a genre of film now. I like the
yin and the yang of characters. And
if I can find a story with the yin and
the yang of a man, then I'll make
that because 1 really truly believe
it's all about the spirit."
His previous two films also dealt
with characters that embarked on
spiritual journeys. He directed

"Bandit Queen" (1994), an Indian
film about a real-life woman who
refuses to be usurped by the men in
her society and as a result leads a
group of thieves throughout her
country.
And then there was "Elizabeth"
(1999) with Cate Blanchett playing
the Virgin Queen in her younger
years of struggle. The movie
earned six Academy Award nomi
nations, including Best Picture, al
though Kapur was snubbed fora
Best Director nomination that
year.
I asked how it was different di
recting films in America as opposed
to in Bollywood, the Indian film in
dustry where Kapur got his start.
"Filmmaking in India is like
going to a big bazaar and negotiat
ing and coming home and not
knowing what you've got," he said.
"But the adventure of doing that is
great. In the West, it's like going to
the supermarket. You know exact
ly what you're getting but the
process is not as adventurous."
"And which do you prefer?" I
asked.
"I would love to have a larger
combination of the two. In the East,
the filmmaking is too disorganized
and chaotic. Here it might be too
organized or too controlling."
But with "The Four Feathers," a
lot of problems came from time
constraints and the weather condi
tions in the African desert in which
the film was shot.
"The last time we saw a movie of
this nature was 40 years ago. It was
'Lawrence of Arabia,' and it took
one year to shoot. We had to shoot
in three months. That in itself is

conflicting. Therefore what you re
alize is the only way you can make
the film is by living on the edge in
constant conflict.
"We were fighting a battle in the
sense that this film was all shifting
sands. We did not know what to ex
pect with the weather. We were
shooting in the middle of Ra
madan. We had dust storms. We
had flash floods where you shoot in
a certain night you come back, and

not only has your set disappeared
with the rainstorm, but the whole
landscape has changed. And you're
shooting dunes where one footstep
takes away the virginity of the
dune."
And wasn't all that frustrating?
"Yes," he said. "But being angry
or frustrated or in love is just part
of the journey. 1 have never known
myself to make a good film if I'm
peaceful all the way through. Be

cause of" the nature of the film,
maybe there was too much angst.
But sometimes there's no angst
,and that's worse."
Then we talked about Ledger's
performance and the fact that the
actor often did his own stunts.
"There was one shot in the war
scene where he has to fall off a
horse where he has a hundred
horses galloping around him, and
he has to run and jump onto a gal
loping horse with these guys run
ning around him. One wrong step,
and he would have been trampled
to death.
"There was a stunt double, and
I said, 'Heath you know you can
die,' and then he quoted from a
scene we had shot just a day before
when he says to [another charac -
ter], 'I will die if it's God's will.' He
looked at me and said, 'Shekhar,
that's your favorite line in the film.'
So I let him do it."
And what about Wes Benley,
who has a very different role as
Harry's best friend who is blinded
in war?
"He is very different. He comes
through the part internally. People
go on screen and get Oscars not for
playing a disability, but for con
stantly drawing attention to them
selves for being disabled.
"One day on the shoot, he sud
denly got up, and we had to walk
30 yards to where he had to film. I
didn't even question the fact thai
he wasn't blind. I started to lead
him to the position with the im
pression that he couldn't see. And
the crew believed. And that was the
great think about him. He doesn't
play at anything. He just is."
