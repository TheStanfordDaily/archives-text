# Ten things I love about Heath!
## 
### RAMIN SETOODEH 
Heath Ledger curses like a
sailor and cracks jokes at the pace
of an expert comedian.
That's a strange combination of
traits fora native Australian actor
who got his start on a soap opera
down under. American viewers
might remember first seeing him
as the lead in the medieval Fox se
ries "Roar." Or maybe not. The
show was cancelled after only half
a season.
Ledger next took a lead role in
the teen movie "10 Things 1 Hate
About You" (1999), an adaptation
of the Shakespearean comedy
"The Taming of the Shrew." But it
wasn't until "The Patriot"
(2000) — which cast him opposite
another Australian actor, Mel Gib
son — that Heath Ledger became
a big Hollywood star.
I interviewed Ledger in a con
ference call two weeks ago, when
he was in Los Angeles promoting
his next film, "The Four Feath
ers." It's a period piece (his third,
after"A Knight's Tale") set in 19th
century Britain.
In the movie, Ledger plays the
lead role as Harry Faversham, a
British soldier who resigns from
his commission after news arrives
that he will need to go to war.
"I was curious about the char
acter because on paper, he was la
beled as a coward," Ledger said.
"But in that cowardly act, I found
him to be courageous because he
was standing up for what he be
lieved in. There was a hell of a lot
of subtext to be added. The char
acter and his journey are so epic."
He is right. The movie is an

epic, in the most swashbuckling
sense of the word, and many of the
scenes needed to be shot in the
African desert.
"There was a pretty cool mo
ment I remember when there's a
helicopter shot when I'm on a
camel, my camel — Big Mountain
was his name — and I was kind of
wandering aimlessly through the
desert, through dunes, and it was
just me and me alone because ob
viously they couldn't have the
crew hiding out in the desert. I

jumped on my camel and rode off
into the sunset for hours and
hours, and I had a turban on my
head and a Pink Floyd song play
ing."
And what was done in the
downtime?
"Every Tuesday night, we
would play drums with a Su
danese drum band. We all bought
bongos, and we'd get blind drunk
on red wine, and there would be
glasses smashing everywhere, and
we'd keep a constant beat for

three hours straight. That was
fun, just in the middle of the
desert pounding away."
For much of the film, Ledger
disguises himself in Arabic clothes
and a beard that likens him, ap
pearance-wise, to John Walker
Lindh. The movie was shot before
Sept. 11, but I asked him if he
thinks a post-9/11 audience will
look at it differently.
"Yeah, I think people will. I
think people have been. I think
you are right now. But it's just
ironic, the timing. Because at the
end of the day, the politics of the
movie are purely a backdrop fora
very simple story of emotions. So
fuck it. I like the fact that people
are talking and thinking that it's
some big conspiracy. I certainly
don't feel that way."
The conversation shifted to his
supporting role in "Monster's
Ball," the independent film that
won Halle Berry last year's Acad
emy Award for Best Actress.
" 11 keeps you alive doing small
er movies and smaller roles," he
said. "There's less pressure. For
'Monster's Ball,' the whole movie
was shot in four weeks. My work
was over in like two days. You can
just go in there and do pretty
much what the fuck you want,
and it's not going to affect the
movie."
But aren't the paychecks small
er?
"I couldn't care fucking less
about money. I never had it be
fore in my life."
He doesn't have a very high
opinion of auditions either.
"I hate them," Ledger said.
"It's the most awkward position

you can be in. You walk in a room,
and you're asked to pull yourself
in this material knowing you're
not performing to anyone. You're
being tested and watched. It just
fucking sucks."
Are you nervous about the au
dience's reception to "The Four
Feathers?"
"1 generally don't give a shit
what people think, particularly
about the movie. I've seen it. I like
it. I'm proud of it. My job is kind of
over from here. People will either
hate it or love it. It's kind of out of
my hands."
He was asked, by another re
porter, about his relationship with
the other Australian actors in Hol
lywood — like Nicole Kidman
and Russell Crowe.
"We all get together on Sun
days and build cannons together,"
Ledger joked.
He did sound more sincere
when discussing the hardest part
about being an actor.
"At the end of the day, if you re
ally want to investigate a charac
ter, you have to put yourself in the
position and live the experience.
Many times, that's what you get.
You get to live that character's life
time for six months. And then talk
about it for six months. And that's
the hardest thing. There's noth
ing harder than to intellectualize
why you're doing something.
"I'm sure Jackson Pollock had
problems explaining why he
would splash paint on the canvas.
And they would say, 'What were
you thinking of when you used
black?' And he'd be like, 'Fuck, I
don't know. It just happened. It's
instinctual.'"


With eyes like that, could you resist the plunge of Heath Ledger's spear?

He is right. The movie is an

epic, in the most swashbuckling
sense of the word, and many of the
scenes needed to be shot in the
African desert.
"There was a pretty cool mo
ment I remember when there's a
helicopter shot when I'm on a
camel, my camel — Big Mountain
was his name — and I was kind of
wandering aimlessly through the
desert, through dunes, and it was
just me and me alone because ob
viously they couldn't have the
crew hiding out in the desert. I

jumped on my camel and rode off
into the sunset for hours and
hours, and I had a turban on my
head and a Pink Floyd song play
ing."
And what was done in the
downtime?
"Every Tuesday night, we
would play drums with a Su
danese drum band. We all bought
bongos, and we'd get blind drunk
on red wine, and there would be
glasses smashing everywhere, and
we'd keep a constant beat for

three hours straight. That was
fun, just in the middle of the
desert pounding away."
For much of the film, Ledger
disguises himself in Arabic clothes
and a beard that likens him, ap
pearance-wise, to John Walker
Lindh. The movie was shot before
Sept. 11, but I asked him if he
thinks a post-9/11 audience will
look at it differently.
"Yeah, I think people will. I
think people have been. I think
you are right now. But it's just
ironic, the timing. Because at the
end of the day, the politics of the
movie are purely a backdrop fora
very simple story of emotions. So
fuck it. I like the fact that people
are talking and thinking that it's
some big conspiracy. I certainly
don't feel that way."
The conversation shifted to his
supporting role in "Monster's
Ball," the independent film that
won Halle Berry last year's Acad
emy Award for Best Actress.
" 11 keeps you alive doing small
er movies and smaller roles," he
said. "There's less pressure. For
'Monster's Ball,' the whole movie
was shot in four weeks. My work
was over in like two days. You can
just go in there and do pretty
much what the fuck you want,
and it's not going to affect the
movie."
But aren't the paychecks small
er?
"I couldn't care fucking less
about money. I never had it be
fore in my life."
He doesn't have a very high
opinion of auditions either.
"I hate them," Ledger said.
"It's the most awkward position

you can be in. You walk in a room,
and you're asked to pull yourself
in this material knowing you're
not performing to anyone. You're
being tested and watched. It just
fucking sucks."
Are you nervous about the au
dience's reception to "The Four
Feathers?"
"1 generally don't give a shit
what people think, particularly
about the movie. I've seen it. I like
it. I'm proud of it. My job is kind of
over from here. People will either
hate it or love it. It's kind of out of
my hands."
He was asked, by another re
porter, about his relationship with
the other Australian actors in Hol
lywood — like Nicole Kidman
and Russell Crowe.
"We all get together on Sun
days and build cannons together,"
Ledger joked.
He did sound more sincere
when discussing the hardest part
about being an actor.
"At the end of the day, if you re
ally want to investigate a charac
ter, you have to put yourself in the
position and live the experience.
Many times, that's what you get.
You get to live that character's life
time for six months. And then talk
about it for six months. And that's
the hardest thing. There's noth
ing harder than to intellectualize
why you're doing something.
"I'm sure Jackson Pollock had
problems explaining why he
would splash paint on the canvas.
And they would say, 'What were
you thinking of when you used
black?' And he'd be like, 'Fuck, I
don't know. It just happened. It's
instinctual.'"


With eyes like that, could you resist the plunge of Heath Ledger's spear?
