# Miyazaki's latest enchants me
## 
### RYAN SANDS 
Watching the brilliant and
compelling "Spirited Away"
made me feel like a child again,
in the most lovely way. The ani
mated feature is the latest prod
uct of internationally-acclaimed
writer/director Hayao Miyaza
ki's imagination. The tale he
weaves in "Spirited Away" is
both fantastical and allegorical,
tapping into the same vein as
such timeless children's stories
as "Little Nemo in Dreamland,"
"Alice in Wonderland," and
"The Phantom Tollbooth." Like
those stories, "Spirited Away"
manages to pull off the perfect
blend of magic, humor and ad
venture to entertain children,
while still speaking about topics
such as the power of words and
ideas, the importance of self re
liance and overcoming egoism,
in a manner that Stanford stu
dents can surely relate to.
To get bogged down with the
details of the plot of "Spirited
Away" is to miss the point of the
film; the real pleasure of the
movie is letting yourself forget
the theater around you and to
plunge yourself into Miyazaki's
world. Still, many of you may
not be sold on going to see it

without having a rough idea of
what "Spirited Away" is about,
so I'll try to paint a little picture
for you in the next few lines.
The film begins with Chihiro, a
sulking and bored 10-year-old
girl, traveling with her parents
to move into their new house.
Along the way, Chihiro's fa
ther gets lost and leads them to
an abandoned tunnel. Despite
Chihiro's very vocal protests,
curiosity overcomes her father,
and he leads the whole family
through to the other side, where
they find a whole new world
filled with countless spirits and
creatures. Chihiro becomes sep
arated from her parents and
trapped in this 'Spirit World'
and must hide from Yubaba, a
giant bird-bodied / human
headed sorceress who rules this
mysterious land. Aided by a
mysterious boy named Haku,
Chihiro manages to trick Yuba
ba into allowing her to work in
Yuya, a giant Japanese bath
house for the gods and spirits.
There, Chihiro befriends nu

merous spirits and humans in
the bathhouse and must fight to
find her parents and return to
the normal world.
If you've ever seen a film by
Miyazaki, yon know that his
style of storytelling is un
matched in its ability to convey
real feelings of wonderment
and simple beauty. Even if
you're one of those people who
believe that animation is unable
to deliver the same emotional
impact as live-action films, you
will surely be swayed and swept
away by this film. To be honest,
the story is one that demands to
be told through animation -
any other medium would be un
able to visually realize the pecu
liar cast of characters that inhab
it the Spirit World Miyazaki de
scribes.
As with the great Disney clas
sic "Beauty and the Beast" and
the book "The Phantom Toll
booth," I fell in love with every
one of the characters of "Spirit
ed Away." Each creature, god
and human being in the film has
a strikingly original voice and
temperament, from the grizzled
yet grandfatherly Kamaji to the
greedy Yubaba to the tenacious
dust specks that work the coal
oven of Yuya.
The character who really

steals the second half of the
movie is Yubaba's huge (we're
talking elephant-size) baby,
Boh, who is later turned into a
ridiculously cute rat that Chihi
ro brings along with her as she
travels throughout the Spirit
World. Really, the crazy situa
tions that come about in "Spirit
ed Away" serve as a backdrop
for us to watch Chihiro, proba
bly the best young female char
acter of any recent movie, as she
is thrown into a completely
unimaginable situation and is
forced to develop both patience
and the ability to make difficult
decisions.
The real strength of Chihiro
as a character is not that she is
incredible in any way or that she
even understands the things
that are happening around her,
but rather that she is tenacious
and accepting the responsibili
ties that are thrust upon her. As
Miyazaki stated in an interview,
the film does not divide its char
acters along an easy dichotomy
of good vs. evil. The main con
flict of the film is not Chihiro
fighting a "bad guy" villian, but
rather Chihiro learning to be
self-reliant and fighting to sur
vive in an unfamiliar place. In
this way, the lessons subtly of
fered by the film are much more

important and instructive than
the older, moralistic fairy tales
that previous generations have
grown up with.
As students living in the San
Francisco bay area, one of the
hippest and most cultural alive
regions of the United States, we
are fortunate enough to be able
to see this amazing film at Cin
e Arts just down El Camino Real.
The only sad thing about the re
lease of "Spirited Away" is that it
is mostly limited to art theaters
or huge multi-plexes near
major cities, so a large section of
American families will not be
able to enjoy this film until Dis
ney (hopefully) gives it a wide
release on VHS and DVD.
Though I thoroughly recom
mend this film for all adoles
cents and adults, the film is real
ly the perfect thing for children,
especially young girls.
Hopefully, if audiences like
us (the privileged ones living
near a bunch of art theaters)
continue to support such
breath-taking films like "Spirit
ed Away," the big American
movie studios will take notice
and continue to pursue and re
lease films like this one, which
are enchanting enough to de
light both children and adults
alike.
