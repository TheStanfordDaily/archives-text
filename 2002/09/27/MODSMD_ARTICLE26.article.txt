# Stanford boys' sincere dorkiness gets Roxy's rocks off
## 
### ROXY SASS 
What would you do if a troupe
of porn stars showed up at your
dorm and asked you to perform
with them as part of their newest
film? At Arizona State, a dozen or
so frat boys jumped at the chance,
earning the ire of campus admin
istrators for their appearance in
"Shane's World #29: Frat Row
Scavenger Hunt 3."
Dean Marc Wais certainly
won't have to worry about a
"Shane's World" crew proving
campus. However, for students,
especially you freshmen, the inci
dent is a sore reminder of a
painful fact: At Stanford, getting
laid can be tough. Breathe easy
and thank the gods, though, be
cause Roxy is here with your first
lesson on navigating the sexual
Sahara that is the Stanford cam
pus.
The most important thing to
realize right now is that neither
male nor female porn stars are
showing up in your dorm's
lounge anytime soon. Sex comes
a bit more difficult than that for
Stanford students. During the
first weeks of school, some of your
new dorm mates will try to regale
you with stories about how cool
they were in high school. When
this happens, remember what
Public Enemv's Flava Flav said:

"Don't believe the hype!"
Let's face it. None of us here
are cool. Those "hip" kids down
the hall? They spent their week
ends taking classical piano
lessons, and you spent yours ei
ther at debate tournaments or tu
toring underprivileged children.
Learn to embrace your true self.
Confidence in who you are and
what you have is very sexy; inse
curity is the quickest path to four
long years of swollen wrists and a
semen-soaked, short-circuited
keyboard. Understanding that
you are not cool will help you get
laid that much quicker.
How can this he, you ask? Well,
if you hope to find yourself swim
ming in a beautiful ocean of tits,
ass, penis and vagina, you need to
be realistic about the world
you've gotten yourself into. De
spite what you've been told, in
some ways Stanford mirrors the
world you came from. That
means that if you're a lady who
wants to fuck or be fucked, you
need do relatively little; merely
finding a partner is a simple task
for any enterprising woman. An
adequate partner? Well, that's
the subject of a future Roxy col
umn. Men, on the other hand,
have got some work ahead of
themselves.
Men, the vast majority of you
are dorks. Am I repeating myself?

Yes, and that's because I'm trying
to get something across to you.
Like in high school, football,
water polo and basketball players
will get far more attention than
you here. Stanford athletes spend
many hours each week honing
their bodies for competition.
You, on the other hand, go to
Tresidder Fitness on Wednes
days. Worse yet, the athletes here
are not the blockheads you knew
from high school. Women fawn at
the sight of them in their nylon
Stanford-embroidered get-ups.

Deep down, many Stanford
women want to relive that dream
of dating the popular school star.
They search for Stanford's own
version of A.C. Slater, if you will.
Naturally, they imagine them
selves as Bayside High's Kelly,
hanging faithfully on his arm. Or
was that Jessie? Never mind. Hell,
even Roxy's got her own fantasy
about A.C. in a chant illy lace sin
glet teaching yours truly a few
wrestling moves. Anyone game
for the corkscrew moonsault or
the gorilla press?

The point is that you have an
obstacle ahead of yourself. But do
not despair. Remember that for
every well-toned dreamboat,
there is a small platoon of men
like you - dick-in-hand, waiting
in line fora few minutes of atten
tion.
So what's a young, bright cam
pus virgin to do? Leverage your
assets. If played correctly, sincere
dorkiness is a turn-on for some
women. Look around, and you'll
see some of the most beautiful
women with complete dorks.
Think of yourself as Eddie Mur
phy in"The Nutty Professor" or
Adam Sandler in "Billy Madi
son."
Alternatively, you could start
drinking and hanging out with
girls who do the same. Most of
them never did this in high
school and will think you're cool if
you drink with them - even
though you're not.
And whether you're a guy or
girl, if you've got a nearby high
school sweetheart, tap that ass for
all it's worth. But don't tell your
friends it's a high school sweet
heart. Tell them he or she just
lives on the other side of campus.
After all. it looks cool to be nailing
someone after just a week at
school - something that will un
doubtedly aid you in your future
sexual quests.


We'll all Screeches underneath if all. Too bad she's dreaming about AC!
