# Death to the Beatles! Long live John!

### ANTHONY HA 
This is the first in a series of articles
called "The Record Bin" exploring
classic albums from the past.
"The dream is over," John
Lennon tells listeners near the
end of his 1970 masterpiece,
" Plastic Ono Band." This wasn't
what Beatles fans wanted to hear
so soon after the breakup of their
favorite band, nor were they in
terested in songs that rejected
nearly everything that the Fab
Four had become. "Plastic Ono
Band" is an uncompromisingly
anti-Beatles album, which is
probably why it's overshadowed
in popular memory by "Sgt. Pep
per" and its ilk.
Nonetheless, "Plastic Ono
Band" remains one of rock's
great confessional albums, on
which Lennon confronts his per
sonal demons - his mother's
death, his alcoholism, the pres
sures of fame - with astonishing
honesty and depth.
Gone are the intricate
melodies and obliquely psyche
delic rants of his late Beatles
work, replaced with straightfor
ward rock and direct, openly au

tobiographical lyrics. "Plastic
Ono Band" feels like Lennon's
attempt to become free from the
myth and worship that had come
to surround the Beatles, present
ing himself as a normal, screwed
up human being.
The bloodletting begins on
the opening track, "Mother." A

church bell tolls, setting a fore
boding tone for the rest of the
CD, and Lennon begins to sing
to his parents, berating them for
abandoning him. His cries of
"Momma don't go! Daddy come
home!" soon degenerate from a
melodic chorus to despairing
wails, and the song's final drawn

out, fading shrieks are truly
chilling.
The mood lifts slightly for the
gentle inspiration of "Hold On,"
but it's followed by "I Found
Out," a angry, fast-paced rocker
showcasing Lennon's disillusion
ment witli his past idealism:
"Don't let them fool you / With
dope and cocaine; / No one can
harm you, / Feel your own pain!"
"Working Class Hero" and
"Well, Well, Well" are also point
ed social critiques. The former
sneers, "You think you're so
clever and classless and free, /
But you're still fucking peasants
as far as I can see," and the latter
confronts the dilemma of living a
happy, well-to-do life in an un
just world. The politics and mu
sical style don't vary much, con
tinually urging listeners to ig
nore gurus and think for them
selves, but - to paraphrase the
Sex Pistols - he means it, man.
While "Isolation," which con
fronts the loneliness at the heart
of the superstar lifestyle, and
"Love," a simple, beautiful love
song, are both moving, the
penultimate track of "Plastic
Ono Band." "God" is its true
high point. Lennon declares,

"God is a concept by which we
measure our pain," before again
denouncing the idols of his past,
but this time his melancholy
piano and slow singing are
tinged with more regret and loss
than anger.
He finishes his claims of disbe
lief by striking closest to home: "1
don't believe in Elvis, /1 don't be
lieve in Zimmerman, /1 don't be
lieve in Beatles." There is a mo
ment of silence, then a whisper:
"I just believe in me, / Yoko and
me." It is the album's most pro
found, most cathartic abandon
ment of heroes and ideals in
order to embrace the joys and
pains of everyday life.
The recent re-master of "Plas
tic Ono Band" also includes
"Power to the People" and "Do
the Oz," two decent but undistin
guished tracks from the same pe
riod, but don't be deceived: the
album really ends with "God"
and the darkly liberating nurs
ery song "My Mummy's Dead."
As "God" ends, Lennon tells
us, "I was the Walrus / But now 1
am John." It is that transforma
tion that lies at the heart of "Plas
tic Ono Band" 's undeniable
power.
