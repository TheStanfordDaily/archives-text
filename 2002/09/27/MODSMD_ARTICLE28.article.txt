## Women hip-hop TO PERFECT RECORD 
### MATT BABIN STAFF WRITER 
"To till the ladies in the place
with style and grace," penned the
Notorious 8.1.G. in the opening
lyrics to his song "Big Poppa."
As far as at least four players on
Women's Soccer
M
vs. Tennessee (at Santa Clara),
tonight, 5:00 p.m.
vs. Montana (at Santa Clara),
Sunday, 11:00 a.m.
the Stanford women's soccer
team are concerned, he may as
well have been talking about tlieir
team.
Style and grace are certainly
two attributes of this year's
team — a team that carries its
perfect record of 6-0-0 (includ
ing five shutouts, two of which
were recorded last weekend)
into this weekend's Santa Clara
Tournament.
And the rap touch — well
that's more an attribute of senior
Kelsey "Snoop" Carlson, junior
Brittany "Dre" Oliveira, sopho
more Natalie "Shady" Sanderson
and freshman Jennifer "Biggie"
Farenbaugh.
Any student who's been to a
soccer game at Maloney Field in
the past three years has heard
someone shout out "Yeah,
Snoop!" to Carlson as shejuked a
defender or unleashed a shot on
an opposing keeper.
llie nickname dates back to
her freshman season, when ac
cording to Carlson, "1 was hang
ing out in my room before a
game, trying to get ready, jam
min' to some rap when one of the
seniors walked by and was just
dying laughing. 'You're a white
female Snoop Dogg,' she said to
me. So then the seniors started
calling me it, and then the guys
team and then pretty much
everyone at school."
Opposing teams are too busy
trying to figure out how to defend
her to laugh about her musical
preference. Now in her fourth
season on the Farm, the co-cap

tain represents a constant threat
to her opponents and senior lead
ership to her teammates.
And to a few lucky ones, she
gives new nicknames. That's
what happened to Oliveira. The
similarities between the two were
so obvious on Oliveira's recruit
ing trip that the nickname was
easy to find.
"Dre (Oliveira) came on a re
cruiting trip and everyone was
like, 'You're the same; you're
the same person.' So I said, 'She
can be Dre.' So then we had
Snoop and Dre. We weren't re
ally expecting one every year,"
Carlson said.
"But then we just decided to
make it a tradition. So now we'll
try to do one in each freshman
class," Oliveira added.
The latest in the series is
Farenbaugh.
"We already had her picked
out ahead of time," Carlson con
fessed.
"They wanted to give me
Bubba something — Bubba
Sparxx," Farenbaugh said.
"But she didn't like Bubba, so
we did Biggie," Oliveira said.
The freshman has lived up to
the name so far, scoring her first
collegiate goal in the second
game of the season, a 1-0 over
time victory over Texas A&M.
As humorous as some may
find the names, there's nothing
funny about this Cardinal team,
as it proved in two convincing
wins over Oklahoma and Florida
last weekend.
National media took note as
well, naming junior defender Al
isan Pabon and senior midfielder
Callie Withers to Soccer Ameri
ca's Team of the Week, ft was the
second time this year for Pabon
and the first time for Withers.
"I think it's great that some of
the backs on our team are get
ting recognized, because they're
doing something that no other
team in the country is doing in
terms of shots and goals against,"
said coach Stephanie Erickson.

Senior Kelly "Snoop" Carlson squares fora crossing pass against Flori
da earlier this season. Carlson has done an/thing but lay low this sea
son, contributing goals on the field and nicknames off of it.
"And Callie has just been dominat
ing. Her goal Sunday was a world
class goal."
As it proved this weekend, the
team has not only strong offensive
and defensive starters, but also
deep ranks of reserves.
"1 think our defending (last
weekend) was superb," Erickson
said. "Two shutouts like that in a
row were great, and I think in at
tack we're looking very scary and
dynamic. I think we played very

well as a team. All 25 players
played last weekend, and we had
two great victories."
The Cardinal will need a team ef
fort agiiin this weekend as it goes up
against Tennessee and Montana.
Tennessee brings in another high
octane attack, one whose favorable
shot ratio of 79-16 has carried it to a
6-1-0 record.
While fans of the Cardinal are
looking forward to this weekend's
play in Santa Clara, it's obvious
that some thoughts around the
program are drifting towards
next weekend, when the Cardinal
will take on top-ranked North
Carolina at Saint Mary's in Mora

ga, Calif. But Erickson is sure that
the team is still focused on the task
at hand.
"I'm not concerned, but 1 know
there's excitement building
around that game" Erickson said.
"So we're aware, but I think our
team is doing a great job focusing
on the next game, not two games
down the road."
That could be bad news for the
Lady Vols and the Grizzlies. The
Cardinal heads to Santa Clara this
weekend with a dangerous lineup, a
streak of two consecutive shutouts, a
potent offensive attack — and plen
ty of music for Snoop, Di e, Shady,
and Biggie to dance to.

make it a tradition. So now we'll
try to do one in each freshman
class," Oliveira added.
The latest in the series is
Farenbaugh.
"We already had her picked
out ahead of time," Carlson con
fessed.
"They wanted to give me
Bubba something — Bubba
Sparxx," Farenbaugh said.
"But she didn't like Bubba, so
we did Biggie," Oliveira said.
The freshman has lived up to
the name so far, scoring her first
collegiate goal in the second
game of the season, a 1-0 over
time victory over Texas A&M.
As humorous as some may
find the names, there's nothing
funny about this Cardinal team,
as it proved in two convincing
wins over Oklahoma and Florida
last weekend.
National media took note as
well, naming junior defender Al
isan Pabon and senior midfielder
Callie Withers to Soccer Ameri
ca's Team of the Week, ft was the
second time this year for Pabon
and the first time for Withers.
"I think it's great that some of
the backs on our team are get
ting recognized, because they're
doing something that no other
team in the country is doing in
terms of shots and goals against,"
said coach Stephanie Erickson.

Senior Kelly "Snoop" Carlson squares fora crossing pass against Flori
da earlier this season. Carlson has done an/thing but lay low this sea
son, contributing goals on the field and nicknames off of it.
"And Callie has just been dominat
ing. Her goal Sunday was a world
class goal."
As it proved this weekend, the
team has not only strong offensive
and defensive starters, but also
deep ranks of reserves.
"1 think our defending (last
weekend) was superb," Erickson
said. "Two shutouts like that in a
row were great, and I think in at
tack we're looking very scary and
dynamic. I think we played very

well as a team. All 25 players
played last weekend, and we had
two great victories."
The Cardinal will need a team ef
fort agiiin this weekend as it goes up
against Tennessee and Montana.
Tennessee brings in another high
octane attack, one whose favorable
shot ratio of 79-16 has carried it to a
6-1-0 record.
While fans of the Cardinal are
looking forward to this weekend's
play in Santa Clara, it's obvious
that some thoughts around the
program are drifting towards
next weekend, when the Cardinal
will take on top-ranked North
Carolina at Saint Mary's in Mora

ga, Calif. But Erickson is sure that
the team is still focused on the task
at hand.
"I'm not concerned, but 1 know
there's excitement building
around that game" Erickson said.
"So we're aware, but I think our
team is doing a great job focusing
on the next game, not two games
down the road."
That could be bad news for the
Lady Vols and the Grizzlies. The
Cardinal heads to Santa Clara this
weekend with a dangerous lineup, a
streak of two consecutive shutouts, a
potent offensive attack — and plen
ty of music for Snoop, Di e, Shady,
and Biggie to dance to.
