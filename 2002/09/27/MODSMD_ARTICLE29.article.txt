On paper, the Stanford field hockey team (5-
6, 1-0 Northern Pacific Athletic Conference) is
a much better team than Pacific (1-5,0-1).
Field Hockey

at No. 7 Pepperdine, Saturday, noon

On paper, the Cardinal should win this
game, given that it has 11 wins in its last 13 Nor-
Pac games and is the reigning conference co
champions.
On paper, the Cardinal should win because

it beat Pacific last weekend in Stockton and
should certainly be able to repeat the feat at
home.
However, the Cardinal's game this Saturday
at 1:()() p.m. against Pacific is not being played
on paper, but on Stanford's Artificial Turf
Field.
Stanford is coming off a split weekend in
which it defeated Pacific 2-1 on Saturday, then
dropped a nail-biter to No. 8 lowa 1-0 on Sun
day. The Cardinal went the distance in regular
time with Hawkeyes, coming up with a score
less tie, but lowa scored off a redirected shot in
the first overtime to win in dramatic fashion.
Against Pacific, Stanford got ahead in the
second half with senior defender Amrit
Chima's conversion of a penalty stroke at 43:50.
Four minutes later, senior midfielder Christina
Williams scored an unassisted goal to put the
Cardinal up 2-0.
But in an unusual turn of events, Pacific's

Alexandra Fiorina scored with only seven sec
onds remaining to ruin the Cardinal shutout.
Since field hockey's official time is visible on the
scoreboard, usually in the last 15 seconds, both
teams will start congratulating the other team if
the game has already been decided by more
than a goal. Accordingly, the Cardinal dropped
its guard and became complacent, leading to
the goal.
"I think we just need to hold the intensity
until the clock is out and take care of the ball,"
said sophomore Eleanor Morgan. "They
scored in the last seven seconds and it taught us
a lesson. I don't think it will happen again."
This weekend's game starts off a crucial
stretch of five games, four of which will feature
NorPac opponents, culminating with a face-off
at No. 14 California on Oct. 12.
The Cardinal is happy to be home after a dis-

mal road trip in which it dropped
five of six games to strong opposi
tion. Most welcome is the return to
the artificial turf at Stanford in
place of the natural grass the team
was playing on at other schools.
"I think we have a huge advan
tage playing them at home be
cause we're on our artificial turf,
which we're used to, as opposed to
Pacific's grass field," said Morgan.
"It's hard to execute a lot of skills
on a grass field, and the ball
bounces unexpectedly. Playing on

turf makes the game a lot faster
and more precise."
l he Cardinal's young roster
has large advantages in shots (167-
100) and penalty corners (98-80),
but has not finished well. Even
with its plus-67 shot advantage,
Stanford has only mustered a plus
-2 goal differential.
However, the Cardinal is com
ing off one of its best games of the
season in its loss to lowa, according
to junior forward Noor Dawood.
"We're all really happy with the
game," said Dawood. "It was one
of our best games all season in
terms of our play. We're all disap
pointed with the loss, but not with
how we played."
