On paper, the Stanford field hockey team (5-
6, 1-0 Northern Pacific Athletic Conference) is
a much better team than Pacific (1-5,0-1).

at No. 7 Pepperdine, Saturday, noon

On paper, the Cardinal should win this
game, given that it has 11 wins in its last 13 Nor-
Pac games and is the reigning conference co
champions.
On paper, the Cardinal should win because

it beat Pacific last weekend in Stockton and
should certainly be able to repeat the feat at
home.
However, the Cardinal's game this Saturday
at 1:()() p.m. against Pacific is not being played

Field.
Stanford is coming off a split weekend in

Cardinal up 2-0.
But in an unusual turn of events, Pacific's

Alexandra Fiorina scored with only seven sec

teams will start congratulating the other team if

the goal.
"I think we just need to hold the intensity
until the clock is out and take care of the ball,"
said sophomore Eleanor Morgan. "They
scored in the last seven seconds and it taught us
a lesson. I don't think it will happen again."
This weekend's game starts off a crucial
stretch of five games, four of which will feature
NorPac opponents, culminating with a face-off
at No. 14 California on Oct. 12.
