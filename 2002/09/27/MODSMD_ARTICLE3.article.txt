# Cal prof. discusses nonviolence

### STEPHANIE COWLES 
Michael Nagler, professor
emeritus at UC-Berkeley and
noted author on the subjects of
ethics and peace, smiled warmly
and frequently at the largely sym
pathetic crowd gathered to hear
his talk at the Stanford Faculty
Club last night. Nevertheless, his
speech was a call to action. His
charge was that we, as a nation,
have not made a single step toward
resolving the conflict that lead to
Sept. 11, and that Bush's resolve to
use force against Iraq will only
compound anti-U.S. sentiments.

Nagler responded to one audi
ence member, who felt that under
certain scenarios, aggressive mili
tary action was the only recourse,
with an emphatic statement of the
first principle of nonviolent resis
tance.
"You think of nonviolence as a
kind of plea to a stronger person,"
he said. "No. What I am saying,
and what Gandhi was saying is that
nonviolence is the strongest
thing."
Nagler argued that the time has
passed for small acts of political
protest, such as writing to the
White House or calling national

congressional representatives. He
suggested instead that the Bush
administration needs to hear a
firm pledge from people who op
pose the aggressive movement to
ward Iraq that an invasion will be
met with acts of resistance and civil
disobedience at home.
According to Nagler, it would
be relatively easy to bring the Iraqi
people up to a level where they
could resist Hussein nonviolently.
However, Nagler said that every
policy enacted by the United States
in the Middle East has been a poli-

cy of violence: from economic
sanctions, which he c haracterized
as "soft" violence, to outright
bombing campaigns.
Nagler described the presump
tion that we can achieve security by
such means as naive.
"You want anti-terrorism that
works?" he asked, "Try nonviolent
resistance."
Nagler's most recent book "Is
There No Other Way?: The
Search fora Nonviolent Future"
recently won the 2002 American
Book Award from the Before
Columbus Foundation. In it, Na
gler contextualized the life and
teachings of Mohandas Gandhi
with personal anecdotes, analyses
of current events and contempo
rary stories of where and how non
violent action is being used effec
tively in the world today.
Recently, Nagler has been an
outspoken critic of the policies of
the Bush administration. In last
night's talk, he cited a Bush ad
ministration plan to train 10,000
Iraqis to overthrow Saddam Hus
sein, and pointed out that it is not

a new strategy, and that some of
the world's worst terrorist groups
and tyrannical regimes grew out of
U.S. government funding.
Nagler has also criticized the
mainstream media. He decried
the endless reenactments of the
destruction and violence of Sept.
11 as needless, disruptive and
part of a trend over the past 50
years toward sensationalized
news coverage interspersed with
frequent commercial advertising.
Nagler found fault with this in
spiritual terms: The mainstream
media conditions us to value the
material world and desensitizes
us to the true meaning of human
existence.
Nagler currently teaches cours
es on conflict resolution and med
itation. He also co-directs the
ME I*l A Center for Nonviolent
Education.
His talk was sponsored by the
Dalai Lama Foundation, de
scribed by its director Tony Hober
as a "local organization with inter
national scope." The foundation
seeks to promote the Dalai Lama
as a symbol for nonviolence and
peace through concrete humani
tarian programs and interfaith ed
ucation on the principles of nonvi
olent action.
