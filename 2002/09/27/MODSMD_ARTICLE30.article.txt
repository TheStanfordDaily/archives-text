# Unbeaten men face two tough teams
## Cardinal men are both talented and experienced and very hard to beat

Last season, the Cardinal won
its first nine games and went on to

vs. Tulsa, tonight, 7:30 p.m.
vs. Santa Clara, Saturday, 2:30 p.m

finish one goal away from making
it to the finals of the NCAA Col
lege Cup.
So far this year, the top-ranked
Stanford men's soccer team has
recorded seven victories without a
loss, mostly due to its plus-19 goal
differential.
Entering its own Nike Invita
tional this weekend, the team can
match last year's start by winning
against Tulsa (5-2) and Santa
Clara (4-1).
And if history repeats itself, this
is a good sign for the Cardinal.
With a nation-leading 1.43 as
sists per game, senior forward
Roger Levesque will lead his team
into action this weekend in a 7:30
p.m. match against Tulsa on Fri
day and a 2:30 p.m. game against
Santa Clara on Sunday.
California (4-2-1) is also part of
the tournament and will play in
the first match of the tournament
against Santa Clara on Thursday
night. Stanford and Cal will not
play each other this weekend.
It has been two weeks since the
Cardinal has played at Maloney
Field, but as evidenced by its un
blemished record, Stanford has
also found considerable success on
the road.
Thus far, the defense has done
its best keeping the ball out of the
back of the net with an impressive
five shutouts.
The Cardinal's goalkeepers, se
nior Andrew Terris and sopho
more Robert Fulton, have defi
nitely played a large role in this
feat by giving their team a pair of
dependable netminders. Earlier
this season, Coach Bret Simon
commented that Terris and Ful
ton might be two of the top 10
goalies in the nation.
"I'm excited to have two of the
best [goalies] in the country be

cause they're both playing at the
top of their games," he said.
"Down the road, it will be very dif
ficult deciding to use which one in
the goal, but right now it's a very
good problem to have."
Trying to make things easier
for Terris and Fulton have been
defenders Taylor Graham, Todd
Dunivant, Aaron Maines and
Chad Marshall. Defensive-mind
ed midfielder Abe Geiger has
also contributed to Stanford al
lowing only four goals in seven
games.
Graham, a senior, has been
phenomenal at the right-center
defender position. He has used his
height (6-foot-4) and athletic leap
ing abilities in heading out the
many crosses that come his way.
Helping Graham in the middle
has been the highly recruited
Marshall, who has stepped into his
role as a starter fairly smoothly.
Manning the outside positions
have been senior Dunivant on the
left and sophomore Maines on the
right. Dunivant has picked up his
performance since last year's
breakthrough season, and he has
quickly established himself as a
shutdown defensive player who is
also very adept at scoring.
Maines was a leading reserve
last season and has done well
guarding the opposing strikers.
With the backfield averaging a
height of 6-foot-2, Simon is excit
ed about the potential but believes
that they still have a long way to
gÂ°-
"I think we're working our
selves toward the level we need to
be at," Simon said. "This week will
test us because both [Santa Clara
and Tulsa] have talented players.
We will get much better as they get
more experience. It's a nice defen
sive group, but we still have a ways
to go."
In a coaching move to take ad
vantage of the team's positional
depth this year, Simon switched
from a 4-4-2 to a 4-3-3. It has
worked well so far, allowing for
Simon to rotate several offensive
minded midfielders, such as
sophomore Darren Fernandez
and senior Johanes Mali/a, into
the third forward position.
Especially important to the
structure of the Cardinal's play
has been the composure and guid
ance shown in the midfield. Led
by Maliza, this year's midfield
group has shown the ability to
tackle well, sustain physically for

all 90 minutes and hold possession
the ball.
Maliza, who Simon believes can
be one of the best collegiate field
generals in the nation, has proven
his worth with 13 points, the sec
ond most on the team. Besides his
top-notch fitness, he has displayed
his powerful shot in collecting a
team-high five goals.
Geiger, a returning All-Pacific
-10 Conference player, has been
instrumental in helping the de
fense and also serving as a reliable
transition player from defense to
offense. Junior Mike Wilson, a sec
ond-year starter, has shown great
ball-winning skills in the middle
and has also done quite a bit of of
fensive work this year.
Although defense wins games,
the Cardinal has also unleashed

an impressive offensive showing
this season with 23 goals.
Most of these scores have been
courtesy of returning Pac-10 Play
er of the Year and second team
Ail-American Levesque. So far, he
has collected a team-best 18
points, with four goals and 10 as
sists, also a team high.
Joined by last year's second
leading scorer, sophomore Matt
Janusz, and either Fernandez or
Maliza, Levesque leads a strong
and experienced group of for
wards.
"I think the team is heading in
a direction that the staff was hop

that the team will continue to grow
and get better," he said. "At this

point, I'm happy that we're head
ing in the right direction."
On Friday, the Cardinal plays
Tulsa for the first time ever.
Simon believes that the Golden
Hurricane will be a stilltest for the
defense.

"Tulsa is a very well coached
team," he said. "They are a good
attacking organization. Very
quick and dynamic."
On Sunday, Stanford will face a
familiar team in Santa Clara. They
have played 32 matches all-time
and the Cardinal won all three
played last season.
Both opponents are currently
unranked but both were ranked
in the top 25 earlier this season.
