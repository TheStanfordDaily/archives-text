# Golf loses Rowe but returns its core

For most college golf teams, the
graduation of a player like of
Philip Rowe would come as a blow
to knees. The Stanford men's golf
team, on the other hand, returns
enough of its strong supporting
talent from last year that the loss of
the actual Philip Rowe shouldn't
sting more than a slap to the wrist.
Despite losing Rowe's veteran

age, the Cardinal will maintain
much of its strength from the
2001-2002 squad that finished
17th at the NCAA West Regionals.
Senior Jim Seki is the most ex
perienced returning player on the
team, with 32 NCAA events to his
credit. That experience really
showed through last spring, as he
fired a career-low 6(3 in the open
ing round of the Pacific-10 Con
ference Championships. In the
heat of postseason battle, he
charged to take top individual
honors in the tournament.
Fellow senior Ron Won also
had a strong junior campaign.
Though he played in just eight

events during the year, he
notched a pair of top-25 finishes,
including a third-place showing at
the Fresno Lexus Classic.
In addition to the Cardinal's
two seniors, junior Blake Mastalir
will attempt to build on a very im
pressive sophomore season. Not
only did he participate in every
tournament of the year, but more
than half of his starts (seven out of
12) resulted in top-25 finishes, a
mark second only to Rowe's nine.
Given all this returning talent,
coach Jeff Mitchell is understand
ably optimistic about the upcom
ing season.
"We certainly have high goals
for the year," Mitchell said. "I
would like for us to win a couple of
tournaments between now and
[the Pac-10 Championships]. [I
also] want to have a chance to win
Pac-lOs with nine holes to play."
Once postseason play begins,
Mitchell believes Stanford should
look to finish in the top 10 national

"I have a group of guys with
great attitudes, high expectations,
and big goals," Mitchell said.

the loss of All-American Philip Rowe.
