# Golf loses Rowe but returns its core

### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For most college golf teams, the
graduation of a player like of
Philip Rowe would come as a blow
to knees. The Stanford men's golf
team, on the other hand, returns
enough of its strong supporting
talent from last year that the loss of
the actual Philip Rowe shouldn't
sting more than a slap to the wrist.
Despite losing Rowe's veteran

age, the Cardinal will maintain
much of its strength from the
2001-2002 squad that finished
17th at the NCAA West Regionals.
Senior Jim Seki is the most ex
perienced returning player on the
team, with 32 NCAA events to his
credit. That experience really
showed through last spring, as he
fired a career-low 6(3 in the open
ing round of the Pacific-10 Con
ference Championships. In the
heat of postseason battle, he
charged to take top individual
honors in the tournament.
Fellow senior Ron Won also
had a strong junior campaign.
Though he played in just eight

events during the year, he
notched a pair of top-25 finishes,
including a third-place showing at
the Fresno Lexus Classic.
In addition to the Cardinal's
two seniors, junior Blake Mastalir
will attempt to build on a very im
pressive sophomore season. Not
only did he participate in every
tournament of the year, but more
than half of his starts (seven out of
12) resulted in top-25 finishes, a
mark second only to Rowe's nine.
Given all this returning talent,
coach Jeff Mitchell is understand
ably optimistic about the upcom
ing season.
"We certainly have high goals
for the year," Mitchell said. "I
would like for us to win a couple of
tournaments between now and
[the Pac-10 Championships]. [I
also] want to have a chance to win
Pac-lOs with nine holes to play."
Once postseason play begins,
Mitchell believes Stanford should
look to finish in the top 10 national

"I have a group of guys with
great attitudes, high expectations,
and big goals," Mitchell said.

performance starts with solid

Senior Jim Seki is the elder statesman on this year's Cardinal, having played
in 32 NCAA events. He and fellow senior Ron Won will try to make up for
the loss of All-American Philip Rowe.
preparation.
"In order to make the jump to
the next level, we have to pre
pare ourselves in such a way that
when we arrive to the tourna
ment, we are ready to play,"
Won said. "There were a few
times last year that I felt like 1
didn't do the right things."
Mastalir also feels that a full team
effort is the key to post-Rowe suc -
cess.
"We lost an Ail-American last
year in Phil Rowe, but 1 think as a
team we are much stronger,"
Mastalir said. "Almost everyone is
playing better golf than last year
and we are a much deeper team.
With the improvement in play,
there is no doubt in my mind that
the [No.] 4 and [No.] 5 guys will
contribute a lot to the team this
year."
With these points in mind, the
Cardinal is prepared to open its
season in Evanston, 111., at the
Windon Memorial Classic. The

54-hole event will take place at the
prestigious Glen View Club, a par
-72, 6,750-yard track that is no
stranger to big events. Willie An
derson won his second consecu
tive U.S. Open title there in 1904.
The talented field is led by Ok
lahoma State, ranked eighth in
the nation in Golf Digest's pre
season poll. The Cowboys have
an excellent group of young
players and are coming off a sec
ond-place finish at last week's In
verness Intercollegiate.
Georgia Southern, an excellent
Division II program that has
earned a spot at the NCAA Cham
pionships the last two years, will
also be at the Windon Memorial.
Kent State, although oil to a bit
of a slow start (it placed 12th at last
week's Inverness), always seems to
feel at home in the Chicago area.
The Golden Flashes are the only
team in this week's field with a
Windon title to their credit, hav
ing won the event in 1993 and
1999.
In the individual competition,
the biggest name to watch is Okla
homa State junior Hunter Malum.
Mahan's 70.51 stroke average as a

sophomore was the ninth-best
mark in NCAA history and more
than a stroke better than his near
est competitor in the Big 12 Con
ference. His 10-under-par perfor
mance at the Ping Arizona Inter
collegiate stands as the third-low
est score in relation to par in
NCAA history. In case that
weren't enough, he won this event
as a freshman in 2000.
Mahan certainly doesn't have
the individual title sewn up by any
means. Junior Tom Johnson of
Northwestern and Oklahoma
State sophomore Alex Noren tied
for third place at the Inverness
and will look to build on that suc
cess this week.
For the Cardinal, this is a special
week for Kyle Gentry. The fresh
man from Carmel, Calif., will start
in his first collegiate event and
hopes to make his presence felt.
"I definitely want to help the
team," Gentry said. "I want to
make a big impact as a freshman."
The Cardinal will conclude
play at the Windon Memorial on
Monday, returning home to pre
pare for the Pepperdine Intercol
legiate on Oct. 7.
