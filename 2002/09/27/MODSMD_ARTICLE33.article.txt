# Law may prevent coaches from talking about injuries

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) â€” Some col
lege football coaches refrain from talking
about their players' injuries in a strategic
move. Next season, speaking about them
could be against the law.
The Health Insurance Portability and Ac

line of questioning.
Alabama and coach Dennis Franchione
have taken as similar approach. It's why few

Watts sprained his left foot in the Tide's

victory over Southern Mississippi last week
and didn't play the rest of the game.
"I don't see the advantage in exposing
our players' every little bump and bruise to
everybody," Franchione said Wednesday.
"There's nothing to be gained by it. I think it
offers a little bit of protection to them as we
go through the season."
