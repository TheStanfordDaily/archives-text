# Law may prevent coaches from talking about injuries
## 
### 
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — Some col
lege football coaches refrain from talking
about their players' injuries in a strategic
move. Next season, speaking about them
could be against the law.
The Health Insurance Portability and Ac
countability Act, passed in 1996, goes into ef
fect in April and could affect how much
coaches know about players' injuries and
whether universities can report those injuries
to the media.
The University of Texas has already

i lamped down on what information it releas
es. 1 lie Longhorns will only say that No. 1 re
ceiver Roy Williams, who strained a ham
string last week against Houston, is "ques
tionable" for Saturday's game at Tulane.
Coach Mack Brown says university ad
ministrators won't let him talk about the in
jury. The team won't make Williams available
to talk to reporters and has discouraged his
teammates from discussing it as well.
"They said, 'Keep your mouth shut,'"
Brown said.

During interviews Monday, reporters
asked wide receiver Sloan Thomas if he had
ever injured a hamstring and how much it
hurt. A member of the sports information de
partment told reporters to stick to another
line of questioning.
Alabama and coach Dennis Franchione
have taken as similar approach. It's why few
outside the trainer's office know for sure
whether quarterback Tyler Watts will play
Saturday against Arkansas.
Watts sprained his left foot in the Tide's

victory over Southern Mississippi last week
and didn't play the rest of the game.
"I don't see the advantage in exposing
our players' every little bump and bruise to
everybody," Franchione said Wednesday.
"There's nothing to be gained by it. I think it
offers a little bit of protection to them as we
go through the season."
In Florida's win over Tennessee last week,
the Gators wouldn't provide injury informa-
tion about running back Earnest
Graham or quarterback Rex Gross
man to CBS's television crew.
Under the act, which was
signed by President Clinton, insti
tutions could lose federal funding
for disclosing an athlete's medical
information.
Arkansas sports information di

rector Kevin I rainor said he and his
SEC 1 counterparts started discussing
the law and its ramifications during
their spring meetings. No formal
guidelines were adopted (lien, so
the discussion of injuries was left up
to each university this season.
"It's my understanding from
talk going around that the health
insurance act may change the land
scape on that a little bit," Trainor
said. "We'rejust going to wait to see
what comes out of it."
The act was designed to protect

individual's insurance coverage by
keeping their health history pri
vate when they changed jobs. Its
effect on college athletics is an un
intended consequence.
Charles Bloom, the NEC's associ
ate commissioner for media rela
tions, said the conference still is try
ing to figure out if the law will apply
to college athletics.
"Right now there's so much hazi
ness as to how it would pertain to
us," Bloom said. "It wasn't meant to
affect college sports. We'll wait and

see and il it doesn't ailed us, then all
the colleges will go back to what
they've been doing in the past."
Bloom said he doesn't have a
timetable for when the confer
ence will know if the law applies to
college athletics, but the law goes
into effect on April 14, 2003, so
time is running out.
"It's really out of our hands," he
said. "If the federal law says we can't
report injuries, then that's what
we'll do. Nince it's a federal law, we'll
just take our orders."
