# Athlete graduation rates are highest ever
## 
### 
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) â€”
The graduation rate for Divi
sion I student athletes has
reached 60 percent for the first
time since the NCAA began
tracking the figures 18 years
ago, according to a survey re
leased Thursday.
Male athletes are graduat
ing at a rate of 54 percent, up
three percentage points from a
year ago, while the rate for fe
male athletes remained at 69
percent.
The NCAA's survey covered
on-scholarship athletes who en
tered college in 1995 and grad
uated within six years. The
graduation rate among athletes
remained two percentage points
higher than the rate for the gen
eral student population.
Among black male athletes in
Division I, the graduation rate
was 43 percent, and 60 percent
for black females.
Only 36 percent of male bas
ketball players graduated, how
ever, and the rate for black bas
ketball players was 28 percent.
The rate for white male basket
ball players was 51 percent.
"The rates are still disap
pointingly low," said Francis
Lawrence, chairman of the
NCAA Division I Board of Di
rectors Task Force on Academic
Reform.
Although the rates for fe
males are higher than the men,
there was no increase for
women basketball athletes, who
stayed at 65 percent.
"This is something we need
to watch closely and see if there's
anything we can do to help
move it up," Lawrence said.
Among Division I football
players, the graduation rate
went from 49 percent to 52 per
cent this year.

The results were for scholar
ship athletes who entered col
lege in 1995 and graduated
within six years.
There are some flaws with
how graduation rates are fig
ured, Big Fen commissioner
Jim Delany said.
Delany said the numbers are
dated and too incomplete. He'd
like to see a standard where an
athlete must complete 20 per
cent of his work each year to
ward a degree over a five-year
period.
"If you allow too much danc
ing around, you're not going to
get there," Delany said.
Schools are penalized if an
athlete transfers to another
school to earn his degree, even if
they transfer in good academic
standing. Athletes who transfer
and graduate do not count for
either school.
"Those that retain and move
people forward would get the
most credit, halfway would get
half credit and those who do
nothing, get nothing," Delany
said.
Delany believes schools
should be held more account
able for their failure to gradu
ate athletes. He suggested
making programs ineligible
for bowl games and postsea
son championships if they fail
to meet minimum academic
requirements.
"That will get the attention of
the public, of the boards and of
the staff and then they will
change their behavior," he said.
The NCAA began tracking
graduation rates in 1984. Since
the guidelines allow six years for
students to complete a degree
program, results for the 1996
freshman class will be released
next year.
