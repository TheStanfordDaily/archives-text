# Stanford geared up for a Sun Devil shootout
## Scoring pace between Stanford and Arizona State likely to be as torrid as the weather 
### MATT LONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Those who are worried that
the Cardinal football team hasn't
seen enough competition in its
young season leading up to Sat
urday's Pacific-10 Conference
opener at Arizona State (3-1) can
allay their fears with one bit of in
formation: Every day in practice
the competition is as intense as
any conference rivalry.
First-year coach Buddy
Teevens has made it clear that no
one is secure in his starting role,
especially on defense where
Stanford (1 -1) is extremely inex
perienced. So each practice the
players must constantly prove
themselves and, no matter how
deep on the depth chart,
l eevens has made it known that
those who excel will play come
gametime. This has been appar
ent in the Cardinal's first two
contests, where players who are
second — or even third or fourth
— on the depth chart receive sig
nificant playing time.
"This is a catalyst for develop
ment on the team. We are always
getting better because there's
somebody behind you pushing
you," said sophomore Anion
Gordon, who will start at defen
sive end.
This situation applies not just
to the defense but to the estab
lished offensive playmakers as
well. Though Teevens has pro
claimed junior quarterback Chris
Lewis his starter, Lewis can feel
the footsteps of redshirt freshman
Kyle Matter, who started Stan
ford's season opening loss at

Boston College and led the Cardi
nal on five straight scoring drives
in the second half of a 63-26 win
over San Jose State.
Then there's senior tailback
Kerr)' Carter, 11th in the Cardi
nal's all time rushing charts.
Carter went down in the first
quarter against the Spartans with
a minor knee injury and saw three
replacement tailbacks rush for
131 yards and five touchdowns,
led by redshirt freshman J.R.
Lemon's 69 yards and three
scores.
Teevens' football-by-commit
tee approach could also serve a
very practical purpose come Sat
urday, when temperatures are
expected to reach 97 degrees at
Sun Devil Stadium. The 12:30
p.m. kickoff will provide little re
lief from the heat, but with Stan
ford's confidence in its depth
,players will be able to relieve one
another to stay fresh.
"Having a lot of people to play
should be been beneficial, and I
believe in playing a lot of guys,"
Teevens said. "It was hot in
Boston as well, and it's not going
to be a whole lot different at Ari
zona State. Our attitude is don't
accept distractions and don't
make excuses."
Neither team plans to let the
heat alter its game plan, as Sun
Devil coach Dirk Koetter refused
earlier in the week to switch from
maroon to golden jerseys.
Arizona State has fared well at
home this season, blowing out
both Eastern Washington and
Central Florida. They have won
their last three after dropping
the season opener to Nebraska,
48-10. Yet the Sun Devils last
win was a come-from-behind
victory over lowly San Diego
State, and they have yet to beat a
quality opponent.
Stanford has won its last three
against Arizona State, but it
needs to be careful and not look

ahead to next week's matchup
with No. 10 Notre Dame and for
mer coach Tyrone Willingham.
Arizona State brings one of
the conference's toughest pass
rushes, led by junior defensive
end Terell Suggs. Suggs current
ly leads the Pac-10 with eight
sacks, averaging two per game.
"[ He] is as good of a defensive
player as we have seen and prob
ably will see this season,"
Teevens said.
Protecting Lewis will be one of
Stanford's biggest challenges, as
the offensive line allowed several
sacks at key moments in the
Boston College game and will
likely use senior guard Greg
Schindler sparingly. Schindler, a
preseason Ail-American selec
tion, suffered a knee injury
against Boston College. Fresh
man tight end Matt Traverso is
questionable for the game with
an ankle sprain, leaving sopho
more Alex Smith as the only true
tight end sure to be available.
Stanford's defense will also be
faced with a tough test in stop
ping junior wide receiver Shaun
McDonald. McDonald has
caught seven touchdown passes
in his last two games, and leads
the conference in that category.
With the recent emergence of
sophomore signalcaller Andrew
Walter and koetter's high-pow
ered passing game, the Sun Dev
ils have had no trouble scoring
points.
Stanford's hopes are pinned
on the rapid maturity of its young
defense, and Teevens believes the
unit is up to the task of giving him
his first Pac-10 victory.
"I'm anxious to see how our
players will respond to playing in
a conference game with a big
crowd and a lot riding on the
game," Teevens said. "I'm confi
dent our guys will play well, and
I have that expectation every
time we show up."
