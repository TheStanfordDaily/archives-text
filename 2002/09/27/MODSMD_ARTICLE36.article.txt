# A
						tale of two quarterbacks: Walter and Matter both surprise
## Andrew Walter sparked a 22-point comeback 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN STAFF WRITER 
On Saturday, the stat-keeper
better be on top of his game. Oth
erwise, he will never be able to
keep up with the all the passing
yards.
Tomorrow in lempe, Ariz.,
both teams are going to start excel
lent quarterbacks.
For the Cardinal, junior Chris
Lewis w ill again start at the helm of
Buddy Teevens' exciting offense.
For the Sun Devils, sophomore
Andrew Walter will be the man
under center.
Walter is the primary reason that
Arizona State is currently 3-1. In last
week's game against San Diego
State, the Sun Devils trailed by 22
points when Walter entered off the
bench.
The redshirt sophomore had
been scheduled to start t he gai ne be
fore he injured his knee, causing
him to miss practice and fall into the
back-up role.
Nevertheless, with the team
down 22-0, Walter came in and ral
lied the Sun Devils to a 39-28 victo
ry with 241 yards and four touch
downs.
"You never know when you are
going to be called," Walter said.
"You can be put in there at any
point, so mentally you have to be
ready for that."
Walter's primary target in the
game was Shaun McDonald, who
finished the game with 178 yards re
ceiving and four touchdowns.
"He is my primary target be
cause he really gets down the field,"
Walter said. "I feel comfortable
throwing to him. But the way the
game plan ends up, he ends up
being the first read. And if he is
open, I'm going to throw it to him."

Walter is the key to the Arizona
Slate offense, which emphasizes the
pass.
"Our strongest aspect is the
throwing game. But we combine
the run and pass; it really helps out
and opens the field," Walter said.
The Sun Devils have been more
focused on offense since coach Dirk
Koetter took over. Before Koetter,
coach Dan Snyder emphasized pos
session and running down the
clock.
"(loach Koetter likes to score
points. I think we may have more of
a passing attack now and are a little

more offensive-minded," Walter
said.
Saturday's game against the Car
dinal will he Walter's first start of the
season.
"The only thing that changes is
you know that you are not going to
be coming out of the bullpen," Wal
ter said. "You are going to be there
for the first snap, so you obviously
have to be prepared."
Last season, Walter started two
games, against Arizona and
UCLA. In the two starts, he threw

Arizona State sophomore Andrew Walter has always had a great arm, but
this year he has cut down on his mistakes and focused on making better
reads, giving him a spectacular seven touchdowns against no interceptions.
