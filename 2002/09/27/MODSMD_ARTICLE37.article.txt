# Kyle Matter led a 63-point offensive explosion
## 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Three weeks ago, Kyle Matter
didn't know if he would get on the
field for Stanford's game against
Boston College. Today, the red
shirt freshman holds the fifth
highest quarterback rating in all of
Division I college football.
"I found out about a week be
fore the game," explained Matter,
who had been competing with
sophomore Ryan Eklund for the
chance to start against the Eagles
in place of suspended junior
Chris Lewis, the team's No. 1
quarterback.
Lewis returned from his sus
pension for the Cardinal's game
against San Jose State, but when he
was injured on a sack in the second
quarter, Matter came in and led
the Cardinal to five second-half
touchdowns in a 63-26 win.
Despite the whirlwind of events,
Matter hasn't gotten flustered,
drawing praise for his poise and
confidence on the field.
"Football is football, no matter
what level you're playing at," Mat
ter said. " I got in there, took a cou
ple plays to get used to it and went
on from there."
Matter's calm on the field has
translated into calmer coaches
as well.
"With a redshirt freshman you
just don't know," head coach
Buddy Teevens said. "A guy ei
ther crumples or rises up, and I
didn't know what Kyle would do."
Teevens knows now.
"Now we feel like we have two
guys we can win with," Teevens said.
Unassuming but confident,
Matter is happy with his play so far
but is not complacent.
"The Boston College game was

a little bittersweet," Matter said of
the Cardinal's narrow 34-27 sea
son-opening loss. "But in the San
Jose State game, I feel like 1 came
out and played well, and the team
was playing well, so that made it a
great experience for me."
For the year, Matter is 24-of-35
passing for 367 yards, with two
touchdowns and just one intercep
tion fora 169.79 efficiency rating.
He's also looked impressive on the

ground, scrambling for two touch
clowns this year.
"It's instinctual," Matter said.
"I'm kind of surprised that I've
run fora couple touchdowns be
cause I haven't always been much
of a runner, but that's just the way
it worked out."
Matter's willingness to run the
ball offers a change of pace from

Redshirt freshman Kyle Matter scrambles in Stanford's 63-26 win over San

but even he didn't expect to play this big a role so soon. He has thrown for
two touchdowns and ran for another pair of scores in six quarters of play.
Lewis.
"Chris is a pocket passer, he
likes to hang in there," Matter said.
"If I see a seam, I'll take it. And
being different quarterbacks,
sometimes we see different things,
so when I come in there I can kind
of change it up a bit."
Matter's strong play and
Lewis's low number of snaps early
this season have led to the in
evitable stream of questions about
a quarterback controversy.
Though he hasn't ruled out fu
ture playing time for Matter,
Teevens has maintained all along
that Lewis is the starter, and there
are no signs of conflict.
"Chris has been really support
ive of me when I've had to go in
there," Matter said, "and just told
me some basic things, like 'If
you're in trouble, look for Teyo,
because he's a big target.' "
Regardless of the substitutions
Teevens mav or may not make this

season, it seems unlikely that there
will be any unhappiness in the
ranks. Teevens likes to play a lot of
players at every position, and the
team has responded well to it.
Matter didn't expect to play so
soon when he came to Stanford,
and he's happy to have had a
chance to contribute.
"I always hoped [I would get
to play]; that was my dream com
ing here," Matter said. "But I fig
ured, we have Chris, and he's
playing well, so I might have to
wait a little longer."
As one of many young contrib
utors on the Cardinal, Matter has
benefited from the team's close
knit and supportive environment.
"We all really enjoy each other's
company, so that kind of chem
istry really helps," Matter said.
"You know, you're playing be
cause you love the guy next to you
and you want to do well for him."
Matter, who seems virtually un
flappable, does express some sur
prise at the attention his flashy sta
tistics have brought.
"It's kind of a shock," Matter
admits.
