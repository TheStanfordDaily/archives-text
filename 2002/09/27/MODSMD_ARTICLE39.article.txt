# Looking ahead to Notre Dame? Never...
## 
### 
Who's Stanford playing
this weekend? Over
looking an opponent
like Arizona State is
about the biggest sports faux pas a
coach or player can commit, out
side of running over a traffic cop
with your Lexus. So don't expect
Buddy Teevens to admit that he
watched Notre Dame game film in
the wee hours of the morning this
week. Don't expect Teyo Johnson
to let it be known that he visited
Golrish.com to see how starting
quarterback Carlyle Holiday's in
jury is coming along.
Nope, the Cardinal coaches
were 100 percent focused on con
taining an ASU offense that had to
stage a comeback against a horrific
San Diego State team. Teyo has
spent the last two weeks brain
storming ways to beat a Sun Devil
defense that gave up 48 points to a
declining Nebraska.
Believe that, and you're being
more unrealistic than a Detroit
Lions' fan reserving his seat at the
Super Bowl.
Truth is, coaches, players, press
and fans have had the Oct. 5
matchup between Stanford and
Notre Dame highlighted on their
game schedules since January,
when Cardinal head coach Tyrone

Willingham and
his stall signed on
to coach Stan
ford's annual rival.
Back then, the
Fighting Irish's
outlook for 2002
looked about as
positive as Anna
Nicole Smith's

budding Emmy Award hopes.
The Irish had major issues.
First, they were 5-6 in 2001.
Then, they had hired Georgia
Tech coach George O'Leary,
only to force him to resign a few
days later over false information
on his resume. Last, Willingham
lost five former starters. Quarter
back Matt LoVecchio wanted a
transfer. Leading rusher Julius
Jones couldn't make grades.
Three other players were dis
missed from school after being
accused of sexual assault.
It seemed Willingham's first
hires should be a tutor and a pa
role officer, not offensive and de
fensive coordinators.
Suddenly though, Tyrone's the
most popular man in college
sports. Everyone expected the
notoriously disciplined coach to
unveil an improved Notre Dame
team. Nobody expected that the

Irish would be 4-0 and ranked
No. 10 in the nation.
And all affiliated with Stan
ford, from Teevens and Teyo to
the girl selling lemon ices outside
gate 12, have been watching
every step of the way.
And all of them would like
nothing better than to serve Will
ingham up his first loss on a silver
platter. Now none of Willing
ham's former players, stalf or even
fans harbor any ill will. Tyrone's
seven years on the Farm did a lot
for Cardinal football. A long await
ed Rose Bowl appearance in 1999.
Seven straight Big Game victories.
In fact, many of the players
expressed happiness that their
coach had the chance to lead col
lege football's most storied pro
gram. They should, because it
was their execution of his regime
that earned him the job.
But that doesn't mean sopho
more defensive end Amon Gor
don lacks a twinkle in his eye when
faced with the prospect of patting
his former coach on the back next
Saturday afternoon after giving
Willingham his first tally mark in
the loss column. Don't think fora
minute that junior tackle Kirk
Chambers's voice doesn't rise a
decibel when he talks about the

excitement surrounding next
week's trip to South Bend.
It's just that two games into
the season, this is already
Teevens' team. The new coach's
enthusiasm, hard work and exu
berance were just the antidote to
cure the Cardinal's pain at los
ing one of their most successful
coaches ever. The players are
excited about the new, more ag
gressive game plan on both sides
of the ball, and excited about the
future of the program.
The best way for Stanford to
introduce "Buddy Ball" to the
nation is to show Teevens doused
with Gatorade and unable to
suppress his huge smile after
beating the man who's shoes he
was hired to fill.
So Saturday, as the Cardinal
caravan leaves Tempe, Teevens
and Co. can finally begin to think
about the most anticipated game
of the year.
Because the thought won't
have rushed across their minds
until then.

litical science. He'll be rubbing Knute
Rockne's statue in South Bend for
good luck next week. E-mail him
until then at ma.long@stanford.edu.
