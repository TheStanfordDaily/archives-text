# U.S. visa difficulties plague int'l students
## 
### WILL OREMUS EDITORIAL STAFF 
Upon arriving at Stanford,
many new students are jokingly
told that, just by being admitted,
they've already completed the
most difficult task of their college
careers. But for international
students from certain countries,
the maxim that "getting in is the
hardest part" has taken on new
meaning.
According to John Pearson,
director of the Bechtel Inter
national Center, four under
graduates and about 15 gradu
ate students are still awaiting
entry or re-entry to the United
States so that they can attend
Stanford this year. A handful
more have had their visa appli

cations denied, due at least in
part to stepped-up security
measures implemented after
Sept. 11.
Dean of Freshmen and
Transfer Students Julie Lyth
cott-Haims said that students
who are not on campus by Sept.
30 will have their enrollment de
ferred to winter quarter.
Most of the students nation
wide who have encountered dif
ficulty getting their visas ap
proved hail from one of about 26
countries whose consulates are
being required by the U.S. gov
ernment to route applications
through Washington, D.C.,
rather than issuing the docu
ments themselves. This policy

has affected Stanford students
from China, Pakistan, Iran and
Malaysia, among other countries.
In the past, Pearson said, offi
cials in Washington usually just
checked students' names against a
list of known terrorists or criminals.
In recent months, applications
have been reviewed more careful
ly, with FBI and CIA agents con
sidering factors such as proposed
field of study and likelihood of re
maining in the U.S. after visa expi
ration.
Saad Ansari, who was accepted
to Stanford's master's program in
computer science, applied in Is
lamabad, Pakistan fora student
visa in mid-July, but due to unex
pected "indefinite delays," he is
still awaiting his visa and now ex
pects to miss the Sept. 30 deadline
for fall-quarter enrollment.
Ansari said he has already
missed out on research assistant
ships because of the delay, and, if
his enrollment is deferred, he may
not be able to find employment at
all, since "no one wants to hire me
for three months only."
Jazib Zahir, a sophomore from
Pakistan, described two incoming
Pakistani freshmen who have also
encountered visa difficulties.
"One got his passport back

two (lays before he needed to
leave," Zahir said. "Another is
still back home in Pakistan wait
ing and not expecting to make it
this quarter.
"This despite the fact that lit* has
been living in Saratoga, Calif, for
quite awhile and only went back to
Pakistan lor the purpose of the
visa."
While Zahir himself is currently
on campus, he was prevented from
participating in a Stanford-spon
sored archeology trip to Italy be
cause of the country's tardiness in
scheduling a visa appointment
with him.
Besides imposing delays on stu
dents who are trying to enter the
country, the added red tape has
caused headaches for some stu
dents who are already here.
"Practically, it's not possible" to
leave and return to the U.S. with
out stopping out of school, said an
Iranian graduate student who
asked not to be identified.
"I really wanted to go home, be
cause my dad was sick. But 1 didn't
want to just risk not being able to
come back," the student said. Iran
is one of several countries on the
U.S. government's list of nations
that support terrorism, so its citi
zens face especially tight security
restrictions.
Shaolie Hossain, a mechanical
engineering master's student from
Bangladesh, described a similar
plight.

"Since 1 haven't gone home for
a year, I was planning to go home
this Christmas," Hossain said. "But
my dad has advised me against it,
since I will have at the most three
weeks ... to renew my visa."
Cliven that most background
checks are currently taking up to a
month, "I might run the risk of get
ting stuck back home, and ol
course there is always a chance of
not getting the visa at all," Hossain
said.
"1 guess I should consider my
self lucky: at least I got the visa
when almost all of my friends were
denied."
Pearson expressed optimism
that the current backlogs would
not become a permanent feature
of the U.S. visa application
process, but he said he does
worry that the added restrictions
could deter some students from
choosing to attend school in the
United States.
"I think there is some question
ing, whether it's students this sum
mer or students who may wish to
come in the future: 'Is the U.S. the
place where I want to continue my
studies? Am I going to be wel
comed?'"
And, while Pearson acknowl
edged that the previous system was
insufficient, he said that the new
system's cumulative effect thus far
has been "delays and denials and
increased bureaucracy," but prob
ably not increased security.
