# U.S. visa difficulties plague int'l students

### WILL OREMUS EDITORIAL STAFF 
Upon arriving at Stanford,
many new students are jokingly
told that, just by being admitted,
they've already completed the
most difficult task of their college
careers. But for international
students from certain countries,
the maxim that "getting in is the
hardest part" has taken on new
meaning.
According to John Pearson,
director of the Bechtel Inter
national Center, four under
graduates and about 15 gradu
ate students are still awaiting
entry or re-entry to the United
States so that they can attend
Stanford this year. A handful
more have had their visa appli

cations denied, due at least in
part to stepped-up security
measures implemented after
Sept. 11.
Dean of Freshmen and
Transfer Students Julie Lyth
cott-Haims said that students
who are not on campus by Sept.
30 will have their enrollment de
ferred to winter quarter.
Most of the students nation
wide who have encountered dif
ficulty getting their visas ap
proved hail from one of about 26
countries whose consulates are
being required by the U.S. gov
ernment to route applications
through Washington, D.C.,
rather than issuing the docu
ments themselves. This policy
