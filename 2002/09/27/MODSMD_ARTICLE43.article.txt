# Nebraska's 21 -year streak in danger
## 
### 
(AP) — Nebraska has won 27
straight conference openers, and
the Cornhuskers don't intend to
break that streak Saturday.
No. 20 Nebraska (3-1) travels to
No. 19 lowa State (4-1) on Saturday
in a crucial game for both teams.
The 'Huskers haven't lost their con
ference opener since 1974, and the
last time they lost consecutive regu
lar-season games was 1976.
Despite all the negativity
swirling around Nebraska, which
lost to Penn State 40-7 two weeks
ago, center John Carrison was con
fident the Cornhuskers would win.
"We're not going to lose this
game," he said. "I understand that
lowa State is very excited, and they
should be. It would be a huge step
for them to come out with a win,
but I just can't see it that way."
For the first time in 97 meetings
between the schools, Nebraska is
the lower-ranked team. A loss
probably would knock the
'Huskers from the AP Top 25 for
the first time since 1981.
There are plenty more sour
notes for Nebraska, which just

nine months ago lost 37-14 to
Miami in the Rose Bowl. National
respect is dwindling, and so is local
support. The Cornhuskers can't
turn on the radio or television
without hearing how poorly
they've played.
Fans are calling for defensive
coordinator Craig Bohl to be fired.
His defensive unit gave up 63
points in a loss to Colorado last sea
son and struggled against Miami
before turning in another poor
performance against Penn State.
As for lowa State, a win would be
huge for the program and its star
quarterback, Seneca Wallace.
Wallace gives lowa State a good
chance to beat Nebraska. He leads
the Big 12 in passing and lowa State
leads the conference in total offense,
averaging 447.8 yards a game.
But lowa State has lost nine
straight to Nebraska and 23 of its
last 24. Last year Nebraska beat
lowa State 48-14 after leading 41-0
at halftime.
"Frankly, that's all we've known
with the lowa State-Nebraska
matchup since we've been here,"

head coach Dan McCarney said.
"It's up to us to do something
about it. Why would anybody at
Nebraska respect us? We haven't
earned it."
There are two intriguing
matchups this week in the Pac-10,
which has five ranked teams:
No. 16 Washington St at California
The Cougars (3-1) could have a
difficult time in the Pac-10 opener for
both teams if they are forced to go
without quarterback Jason Cesser,
who dislocated a rib on his right side
last week. Cesser is questionable for
the game, but coach Mike Price has
not niled him out.
If Gesser can't go, freshman Chris
Hurd would get the nod because
backup Matt Regal also is injured
with a bruised left knee.
Not only that, California (3-1) is
much-improved and looking fora
bounce-back win after losing 23-21 to
Air Force last week when t hey failed
on a 2-point conversion with 31 sec
onds remaining.
"This loss is no big de;d," receiver
LaShaun Ward said. "It's time to go

for the Pao 10 championship."
The Golden Bears are off to their
best start since 1998 and are eighth in
die country in scoring, averaging
points per game. Washington State
has won three straight in this series.
No. 23 Oregon State at No. 18 USC
The Beavers (4-0) have not won
at the Los Angeles Coliseum since
1960. Alter beating USC in Corvallis
two years ago, Oregon State came
close at home last year, but South
ern California quarterback Carson
Palmer ran 4 yards on a naked boot
leg to give the Trojans a 16-13 over
time victory.
"We are going to be ready to go.
I think this year is bigger because of
what happened last year." quarter
back Derek Anderson said.
USC (2-1) is coming off a tough
27-20 loss at Kansas State last week,
while Oregon State tailback Steven
Jackson has made people forget
about predecessor Ken Simonton.
Jackson, who was Simonton's
backup last season, ran for 227
yards in Oregon State's 59-19 win
over Fresno State last week.
