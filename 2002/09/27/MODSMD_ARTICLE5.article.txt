Hundreds of student organiza
tions will host booths today from
11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. in White
Plaza for the Student Activities Fair.
Sponsored by the Office of Student
Activities, the fair is an annual event
that clubs use as their major recruit
ment tool. This year, a number of
new clubs will join more than 250
participants at the fair.
One of the clubs that just started
up is the Greens at Stanford, a po
litical club dedicated to providing a
third-party alternative for Stanford
students.
"The Greens have an important
role to play here in both assisting
other activist groups on campus,
which are directed toward peace
and justice issues, and in providing
a connection to our government
and the electoral process as a means

for seeking change," said the club's
adviser Mitchell Smith, an adminis
trative associate at the Center for the
Study of Language and Informa
tion.
"In terms of our membership,
we just had our first meeting and
11 interested people showed up,"
he said. "We hope that our pres
ence at the activities fair will bring
in more members."
Another club new to the activi
ties fair is Colleges Against Cancer,
an organization whose aims in
clude fundraising for cancer re
search and increasing student
awareness.
"Our biggest task as a voluntary
student organization was to orga
nize the first-ever Relay For Life in
Palo Alto on May 10 and 11 to raise
money for cancer research and ser
vices for cancer patients through
the American Cancer S<x:iety," said
Mykel Kochenderfer, president of

the organization.
Other clubs that will appear in
the fair are more academic in na
ture, like Stanford Student Biode
sign.
"Stanford Biodesign is the first
student organization to comple
ment Stanford's [bioengineeringj
initiative," said Ken Lin, co
founder and president of the club.
The group already has over 450
students subscribed to its mailing
list, but it aims to increase its expo
sure to the student population.
"Aside from introducing our
selves to the campus, we aim to re
cruit freshman interns and to dis
tribute flyers describing all campus
courses related to bioengineering
during the activities fair," Lin said.
Other new clubs at the fair will
include Bursting the Bubble and
Stanford Contract Bridge Club.
