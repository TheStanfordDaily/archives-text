## Bush: Iraq assisting al-Qaida terrorists 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€”Turning
up the political heat on Iraq, the Bush
administration said yesterday that
Baghdad is so completely in cahoots
with al-Qaida that it has harbored top
aides to Osama bin Laden and may
have trained the terrorists in germ
and gas warfare.
Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld said the United States has
evidence that senior members of al-
Qaida have been in Baghdad "in re
cent periods," but they did not include
bin Laden. It's unclear whether they
remain in the Iraqi capital, he said, be
cause they are "moving targets."
Rumsfeld said he had high confi
dence in this information, but he ac
knowledged that the intelligence re
porting is based on different types of
sources of varying degrees of relia
bility." He said some of the informa
tion came from suspected al-Qaida
members in U.S. detention.
Iraq denies it supports al-Qaida.
"We have what we believe to be
credible information that Iraq and
al-Qaida have discussed safe haven
opportunities in Iraq (and) recipro
cal nonaggression discussions,"
Rumsfeld told a Pentagon news
conference.
He cited "solid evidence" of al-
Qaida members in Baghdad, but at
one point he refrained from explicit
ly stating they had received a gov
ernment-sanctioned grant of safe
haven. That, he said, "happens to be
a piece of intelligence that either we
don't have or we don't want to talk
about."
Just a day earlier, when asked dur
ing a news conference in Poland about
alleged links between al-Qaida and
Iraq, Rumsfeld would say nothing ex

cept to assert that such links exist. He
said yesterday that he was at liberty to
elaborate because some intelligence
had been declassified.
Other senior administration offi
cials joined in throwing accusations at
Iraq that appeared designed to bolster
President Bush's argument that Iraq
poses such a grave danger that Sad
dam Hussein must be deposed, by
force if necessary.
"Al-Qaida and Iraq are too close for
comfort," White House press secre
tary Ari Fleischer said.
Secretary of State Colin Powell told
the Senate Foreign Relations Commit
tee that "there is evidence of a linkage"
between Iraq and al-Qaida. He said he
was unaware of any Iraqi link to the
Sept. 11 terror attacks but would not
dismiss the possibility.
Rumsfeld and the Pentagon's top
military officers met at the White
House with Bush to discuss a range of
issues including Iraq. The officers in

cluded the chiefs of the Army, Navy,
Air Force and Marines as well as the
chairman and vice chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Stall'.
Yesterday's statements, which
echoed those made previously by na
tional security adviser Condoleezza
Rice, are the strongest yet alleging
Iraqi complicity with al-Qaida. Previ
ously, evidence of the two working to
gether was tenuous, or came from
what U.S. officials called unreliable
sources.
Rumsfeld said "senior level con
tacts" between al-Qaida and Iraq go
back a decade and have been increas
ing since 1998. In that year the Iraqi
ambassador to Turkey traveled to
Afghanistan to meet with senior al-
Qaida leaders, another U.S. official
said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
The administration has been less
specific about information pointing to
Iraqi assistance to al-Qaida on chemi

cal and biological weapons. Rice said
in an interview with I'BS' "The New
s Hour with Jim Lehrer" on Wednes
day that several al-Qaida detainees
have said that Iraq provided "some
training to al-Qaida in chemical
weapons development."
Rumsfeld made the same assertion
in a more qualified way.
"We do have, I believe it's one re
port indicating that Iraq provided un
specified training relating to chemical
and /or biological matters for al-
Qaida members." He added that there
is other information "of varying de
grees of reliability" that supports that
single report.
In a carefully worded statement,
Rumsfeld also asserted that the U.S.
government has credible evidence
that al-Qaida leaders have "sought
contacts in Iraq" who could help them
acquire weapons of mass destruction
capabilities. He did not say whether
Iraqis provided such help.
