NORFOLK, Neb. (AP) â€” Three
holdup men shot five people to death in
a bank robbery and lied in a stolen car
yesterday morning in a crime that
spread terror through this small farm
ing town. Three suspects were arrested
hours later.
It was the nation's deadliest bank
robbery in more than a decade.
Four bank employees and a cus
tomer were killed in the holdup at a
U.S. Bank branch, a small, one-story
stucco building with twin glass doors in
the middle of a parking lot outside a
strip mall. Another customer was
wounded in the shoulder. Two other

employees were unharmed.
Authorities would not say whether
the gunmen got away with any money.
The FBI was called in.
About three hours later, three men
matching the description of the killers
were stopped in a stolen pickup in
O'Neill, a ranch town 76 miles away,
and arrested in connection with the
killings, Norfolk Police Chief Bill Mizn
er said.
The Subaru Outback car that police
said the gunmen used to flee Norfolk
was found abandoned in the same
county; authorities used its satellite nav
igation system to find it.

The holdup took place around 9 a.m.
Dale Tomka, a florist, said that he
saw the gunmen shortly before the
shootings and that they were wearing
stocking caps, possibly ski masks, and
one of them had black stripes painted
under his eyes. The gunmen were also
described as wearing dark, baggy
clothes.
The police chief said it was unclear
exactly what wen ton inside in the bank,
and "we're hoping security tapes will
help explain that." But investigators
did not immediately have the special
equipment needed to view the tapes.
After the shootings, the gunmen ran

from (he bank and broke into a house
nearby, where they confronted the
home's residents and stole the white
Subaru Outback, Miznersaid.
One of the bank's front doors was
shot out during the attack, and a stray
bullet shattered a drive-through win
dow at a Burger King next door. No
one was at the window, and none of the
20 people in the restaurant was hurt.
"1 screamed and said, 'My God, I
think somebody shot the building!'"
said Donna Schwager, a Burger King
employee who was working a cash reg
ister near the window. "The good Lord
was looking out for me today."
