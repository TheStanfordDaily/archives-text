Jonathan Schorr's new book, tells the tale
of the E.C. Reems Academy, in nearby
Oakland, Ca. For three years from the
school's inception, Schorr trailed parents,
teachers and students as they struggled
to establish this charter school in one of
Oakland's poorest neighborhoods. "A
very thoughtful and intimate examination
of the competing dreams and challenges
faced by one community seeking a better
way to educate its children. It will illuminate
the current national debate about how
to create schools where every child is
expected and enabled to achieve and succeed."
