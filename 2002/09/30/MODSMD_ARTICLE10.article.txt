will soon restore military aid to
Pakistan to bolster the country's
military capabilities — a deal Is
lamabad hopes will include new F

days of talks between U.S. and
Pakistani defense officials in Pak
istan's capital, the first high-level
meetings held since the United
States imposed sanctions following
Pakistan's nuclear tests in 1998.
I he talks focused on the release
of weapons and equipment al
ready earmarked for Pakistan but
withheld after the nuclear tests.
Fhe meeting — known as the De
fense Consultative Group — also
discussed the purchase of new
weapons and the possibility of
restarting joint military exercises.
Feith said Pakistan's participa
tion in the U.S.-led war on terror
ism had led U.S. authorities to re
consider the four-year ban on mil

itary assistance.
"We are interested in creating a
security environment in which
Pakistan and the United States can
work together to the maximum
against the threat of terrorism and
dealing with this very serious
problem of al-Qaida and Tal
iban," he said.
Pakistani Defense Secretary
Gen. Hamid Nawaz expressed in
terest in buying new arms and sub

that included new F-16 fighter jets
to patrol the borders with
Afghanistan and India.
In recent months, U.S. and
Pakistani security forces have been
carrying out raids on suspected al-
Qaida hide-outs in remote areas
along Pakistan's border with
Afghanistan.
Feith also said officials from
both countries were working to
ward a resumption in joint mili
tary exercises.
"We are looking at what train
ing we can do together," he said.
A second round of talks are ex
pected to be held in Washington as
early as March, officials said.
U.S. military aid to Pakistan was
cut off in 1990 to punish the coun
try for its growing nuclear pro
gram.
