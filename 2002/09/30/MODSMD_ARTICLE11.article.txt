# U.S. committed to assist Afghanistan
## United States will continue to help train Afghan army

KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) —
Washington is committed to im
proving Afghanistan's tiny, fledg
ling national army, and said it
should bear the responsibility for
protecting the country from future
violence.
U.S. Undersecretary of Defense
Douglas J. Feith said yesterday that
Afghan security forces and not in
ternational peacekeepers or coali
tion forces, must be responsible for
protecting the country from future
violence. He also doubted the
peacekeeping force, known as
ISAF, would be expanded.
"If there are resources that other
countries want to contribute to build
up ISAF a bit here and there we're
happy with that, but we retain the
view that were not looking to base
Afghan security on the fantasy of
enormous numbers of international
peacekeepers coming here and try
ing to create order," Feith said.
But establishing security in
Afghanistan, a country torn by 23
years of war, won't be easy, he said.
"It's a very difficult task and I'm
not sure that anybody can guaran
tee that you won't have incidents
and attacks and assassination at
tempts and violence in the future,"
Feith told reporters during a brief
visit to the capital, Kabul.
He said that help in training the
Afghan national army would con
tribute to the country's stability and
shore up the authority of President

Hamid Karzai.
Afghanistan's new multiethnic
army — short of money and equip
ment — is just several-hundred
strong. About 600 soldiers were
trained by British troops earlier this
year, but only 400 soldiers stayed
when the defense ministry failed to
pay and arm them.
Western diplomats said Defense
Minister Mohammed Fahim initial
ly was reluctant to support the
army, but has warmed to the idea.

Thus far the defense minister,
who is believed to have large caches
of weapons in the Panjshir Valley,
has yet to give them to the central
government and the new Afghan
army. His Tajik soldiers still wield
most of the authority.
The transitional government has
little authority outside the capital.
The rest of the country is largely in
the hands of local warlords who
maintain their own militias.
Earlier vesterdav, Feith flew to

Bagram Air Base, the U.S. military
headquarters in Afghanistan. He
met American troops and Lt. Gen.
Dan K. McNeill, the commander of
U.S. forces in the country, U.S. Em
bassy spokesman Alberto Fernan
dez said.
In Kabul, Feith met the acting
commander of the 4,800-strong in
ternational peacekeeping force that
patrols the capital. Feith was also
due to meet Fahim, the defense
minister.
