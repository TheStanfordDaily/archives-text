## The 						Stanford Daily Palo Alto incident raises questions about on campus safety 
### 
Published Since J891

Stanford's campus may be one of the
safest in the country, but a recent sexu
al assault in Palo Alto delivered a sober
ing reminder to members of the Stan
ford community: We are not immune to crime.
In mid-September, an employee of Long's
Drugs in downtown Palo Alto was charged for
sexually assaulting a fellow worker in late Au
gust â€”just a few weeks before freshmen began
arriving on campus for Orientation.
Though the victim was not a Stanford stu
dent, the incident hit close to home. Long's is
located just a few blocks down University Ave.

and is often frequented by Stanford students.
Stanford is undoubtedly safer than many
other, more urban universities, except for
the occasional dorm-room or bike theft.
While the incident at the drugstore is shock
ing, it is in no way indicative of the level of vi
olence on this campus.
The recent assault reminds us that safety
should not be taken for granted. Students,
especially women, should take simple pre
cautions to keep themselves safe. So, lock
your dorm room. Walk home with a friend
after going out for the night. Beware of

stray raccoons.
Arid use the services provided by the Uni
versity to keep students safe. The blue emer
gency phone towers installed around campus
are part of a $1.3 million University project to
enhance campus security. After a brief hiber
nation, the 80 towers are back in service.
We feel that, when working, the emergency
phone towers provide an invaluable service to
the Stanford community by alerting police and
serving as an added reminder to would-be
criminals about the safety infrastructure cur
rently in place.

SURE Escort, the free golf-cart pick-up
service for the tired, cold and / or safety-con
cerned, will reopen on Thursday. By dialing
5-SURE from any campus phone, students
can avoid the risks involved with walking
alone at night.
The crime that took place only a few miles
away could very well happen on campus. Stu
dents should protect themselves by taking ad
vantage of the available services.
While students may still think we live in the
"Stanford bubble," unfortunately it would only
take one serious crime to puncture it.
