Parking Department's response to Mir
rielees situation is 'horsepoop'
Horsepoop! Can I say "horsepoop" in
The Daily? Because if I can't, I don't know
how else to describe the words coming out
of the mouth of Brodie Hamilton in the
Mirrielees parking article ("Mirrielees
parking woes increase," Sept. 27).
If she thinks that they have been in any
way intelligent with their parking spot de
cisions, she is sadly mistaken. Maybe she
should start parking her car at Mirrielees
and walking to her office every morning.
Then she'd get what we're talking about.
First, she'd be an annoyingly long walk
from her destination when she got out of
the car. Second, she'd have to look forev
er fora place to park in our lot. And third
(most ironically) the permit she had to
shell out $150 for would be useless, be
cause it's too far from her office to be in a
lot she can use. I think it'd be great.
And I disagree with her proposed solu
tions to the problem.
"They can take the Marguerite .... we
wanted to meet everyone's bike-parking
needs." Please. What, are we supposed to
plan our schedules around the Shopping
Shuttle's schedule?
As it is, I budget 45 minutes a day to
park. And bike parking? Come on. The
pathway between Mirrielees and the grad
housing inexplicably has two separate
sidewalks. And there's a huge courtyard in
back that is used a couple times a quarter
for grilling food.
Put the bike racks there. And, people
don't steal bikes that are locked to them
selves. You don't need bike racks for that.

Bike riding at Stanford is 'out of control'
The photo and the caption "intersec
tion of death" (front page, Sept. 26) is no
joke. There have been a number of near
death experiences involving bicycles.
The University's emphasis has been
on protecting students (and others)
who ride bicycles, rather than on the
pedestrians who are terrorized by
them. Last winter I was struck and
knocked down by a bicyclist as I was re
turning from a faculty meeting to my
home on campus.
The collision broke my elbow badly and
required hideous surgery. For months I
could not write or drive or wash my hair
myself, or open cat food cans. Getting
dressed was painful and difficult. I have
permanent pins and wires holding the
elbow together.
That accident not only greatly inter
fered with my work but has also left me ex
tremely fearful of walking on campus. I
chose to live on campus so 1 could walk to
work; now I cannot do that.
I have asked the University to make
bike paths on campus, especially at the
"intersection of death," and to forbid bike
riding in the Quad and under the colon
nades, but so far nothing has been done.
At no other university that I know, or
have visited, is bike riding so out of con
trol. There have been numerous acci
dents, some worse than others, but will it
take a death before something is done?
I hope it will not be yours. As your are
careening across campus think about the
liability and emotional devastation you
will face if you hurt (or kill) someone. I
am concerned for the safety of bike riders
(I, too, own and ride a bike) but I am also
concerned about the safety of pedestrians

trying merely to walk across campus.

University's stance on using corporate
logos for dorm themes is 'infuriating'
That parodying the MasterCard logo,
In-N-Out or other corporate trademarks
in dorm themes ("Legal issues restrict dor
mitory themes," Sept. 23) should present
any sort of a "legal issue" is infuriating.
That the attitude of the University pow
ers-that-be is to restrict student conduct
that is lighthearted, well-intentioned and
in no way threatening to legitimate corpo
rate interests so as to avoid even the re
mote possibility of provoking corporate
ire is even more so.
It is utterly legitimate, and essential to a
free and sane society, that well-known cor
porations and their trademarks be subject
to parody. The lighthearted imitation of
trademarks is an important form of social
and political comment, and as such should
be protected as free speech.
Well-known corporate trademarks are,
and should be, objects of cultural refer
ence. In cases like that of dorm themes,
where there is no intention (and very little
likelihood) of misleading anyone to be
lieve that the corporation whose trade
marks are imitated is in some way affiliat
ed with the dorm or its theme, and where
the imitation poses no threat to the corpo
ration's ability to profit from its trade
marks, the case is especially clear.
Even though "Harry Potero" and
"MasterCardenal" may not qualify as im
