# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Nudity a possible solution to autumn unpacking woes 
### MARY DAILEY GUEST COLUMNIST 
Every year as school begins, I think to
myself, "Good God, wouldn't life be easier
if we could just get over this whole indecent
exposure thing and live in one big nudist
colony?" Sounds crazy, I know, but for
those of us who cannot afford to hire pro
fessional movers, nudity (hence, luggage
reduction) is really not such a bad idea.
Think about it: There would be no
competing fashion trends, less concentra
tion on material goods and most impor
tantly, less unpacking to be done when

moving in and less packing to be complet
ed when moving out.
So, moving in has sprung up once again
and so has my blood pressure. Does it ever
get any easier? After lugging all of the mas
sive amounts of junk that I have accumulat
ed up two flights of stairs into my room, I
began to ponder some solutions to the
nightmare that is moving.
Solution number one: the suitcase sling
shot, a rather large device that would
launch suitcases from the ground floor
straight through the window of the desired
room. Granted, there might be some room
for directional deviation, which makes the

design somewhat of a liability, but it's worth
a shot (no pun intended).
Invention number two: the stuff air
drop, by a plane that would drop luggage
down by parachute into the desired room,
somehow going through the roof without
damaging it. Of course this might be a tad
difficult if the pilot pulls a move similar to
an Army pilot's recent maneuver in
Afghanistan and accidentally torpedoes a
group of innocent civilians .... Oops.
Finally, the baggage beamer, a device
through which one could command our
old Star Trek friend Scotty to beam up
the luggage.

However impractical the aforemen
tioned ideas may be, 1 think them not un
worthy of serious contemplation by the ad
ministration, I mean forget all that academ
ic stuff, I'm talking about simple lifestyle
aids, and if worse comes to worst, perhaps
nudity really is the answer.
Do we really need clothes?
What if all Stanford students walked
around naked, not just the ones that do so
on Full Moon on the Quad. Yes we would
be a litde chilly, but I think it might prove to
be a rather interesting experiment during
the day, provided that every person on
campus participate, including professors.

Hmmmm .... The freshmen seminar.
What would the young frosh say to a pro
lessor upon meeting him or her for the lirst
time, in the buff.
Yikes, it would prove to be rather em
barrassing I suppose. 1 he point is, anyway
you look at it, packing yields pandemoni
um, and those who hate it as much as 1 do
are in desperate need of a serious solution.
So get to work Mechanical Engineering
majors and product designers, make this
move-in menace disappear.
