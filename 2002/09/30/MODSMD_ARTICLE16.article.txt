— A University of Montana student
was arrested late Wednesday night
after Public Safety officers found
explosives inside his dorm room.
Dereck Stairs, a sophomore in
computer technology, has been
charged with felony possession of
explosives.
According to court documents,
Public Safety officers found a
large prescription bottle filled
with gunpowder, primer blasting
caps and matchstick heads in the
microwave of Stairs' fifth-floor
room. The bottle cap had a small
hole drilled into it and a three
inch fuse sitting next to it.
Ron Brunell, director of Resi
dence Life, said this is the most dis
turbing incident to happen in the
dorms this year and one of the
worst in the 15 years he has been in
his position.
Two Resident Assistants called
Public Safety after they saw Stairs,
20, walk into Jesse Hall carrying an
electric cord with exposed wires
and what appeared to be shotgun
shells or dynamite, according to the
court affidavit.
When officers Scott Oak and
Paul Kelly went to his room to
speak to the suspect, according to
court records, he admitted that the
explosive device was his and he

made it by tearing apart shotgun
shells, putting the gunpowder and
primers into the bottle and then
adding match sticks.
Ken Willett, the director of Pub
lic Safety, said after Stairs was ar
rested he was turned over to the
Missoula Police Department.
Stairs, who is being held in
Missoula County Jail, appeared
Thursday on closed circuit televi
sion injustice Court for his initial
arraignment.
No plea or sentence will be
sought until Oct. 10, at 4 p.m.,
when Stairs appears in District
Court for his preliminary hearing.
The penalty for possession of ex
plosives is up to 20 years in prison
and a $50,000 fine.
Stairs, unshaven and in an or
ange jump suit, showed little ex
pression as fudge William Ful
bright read him his rights.
His bail was set for $5,000.
Fulbright ordered Stairs to re
main in Missoula County until his
hearing ends. Stairs is also prohibit
ed from carrying a weapon, includ
ing ammunition, and is restricted
from all property owned by UM.
Brunell said he met Monday
with Jesse Hall staff to speak with
them about the situation.
"We talked with all of them,"
Brunell said, "because we wanted
to be very aggressive in terms of
making sure the safety and welfare
of our students was protected."
