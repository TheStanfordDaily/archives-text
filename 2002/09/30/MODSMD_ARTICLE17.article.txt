Kicking a dangerous habit may now be easi
er than ever.
The Georgetown University Medical
Center's Drug Discovery Program has re
cently developed a new drug, Nocaine, in
tended to help cocaine addicts withdraw
from usage.
Alan Kozikowski, professor of neurology
and director of the Drug Development Pro
gram, designed and created the drug.
Under the direction of psychiatry profes
sor William L. Woolverton, scientists at the
University of Mississippi Medical Center
found that research animals responded pos
itively to the drug. Animals worked harder
to get doses of Nocaine than to receive a

placebo. In addition, the animals exerted
even more effort when trying to obtain
doses of actual cocaine.
"Our study results imply that Nocaine is a
weak reinforcer — meaning that it provides
some of cocaine's effects, but at a much
lower level," Woolverton said. The advan
tage of a weak reinforcer is its lack of abuse
by users.
"Our studies have shown that Nocaine
would likely blunt the aversive effects associ
ated with cocaine abstinence, enabling ad
dicts to gradually and safely withdraw from
the drug," Kozikowski said.
The Medical Center's Associate Director
of Media Relations Beth Porter agreed that
the drug is encouraging. She explained that
Nocaine does not appear to be as addictive
as cocaine but has enough similar qualities
to make people want to take it. "Compare it

to using a nicotine patch to stop smoking —
the patch does not provide all of the effects
that tobacco users find enjoyable, but it pro
vides them with enough nicotine to help
them gradually withdraw," Porter said.
Porter admitted that at this point, there is
no way to tell whether this drug will work on
humans, but she is confident that clinical
studies will show an effect.
"Animal testing shows us how a drug is
likely to work in people, because many ani
mals are biologically similar to humans. We
are optimistic that humans will respond to
the drug," Porter said.
The Food and Drug Administration ap
proval process will likely begin in early 2003
Trials take several years to complete and
according to Porter, "Only a small percent
age of drugs in development ever make it to
the mass market."
