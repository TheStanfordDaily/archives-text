## Sun Devils rout Cardinal 65-24 in Pac-10 opener 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
TEMPE, Ariz. â€” The Stanford
football team made history on Sat
urday. Unfortunately for the Car
dinal, it wasn't ihe good kind.
Stanford (1-2, 0-1 Pacific-10
Conference) lost 65-24 to Arizona
Football
Arizona State 65, Stanford 24
State (4-1,1-0), the most points the
Cardinal has ever allowed to the
Sun Devils and the most the Devils
had ever scored in any Pac-10
game.
The Devils' Andrew Walter's
cannon arm was good for 414
yards and five touchdowns, and his
favorite target, the speedy Shaun
McDonald, caught 10 balls for 221
yards and a touchdown, the third
most receiving yards in Arizona
State history.
After the surprisingly lopsided
loss, the Cardinal was more quiet
and stunned than angry.
"I'm at a loss for words," junior
quarterback Chris Lewis said. "We
were making a lot of mental errors,
and they proved to be costly."
The game didn't start off like a

41-point blowout, though, as Stan
ford authoritatively marched
down the field on the opening
drive. Lewis hit sophomore Nick
Sebes with a 47-yard pass on the
first play of the game, and senior
fullback Casey Moore plunged in
fora two-yard touchdown only
1:12 into the game.
Arizona State came right back as
Walter hooked up with McDonald
for three receptions, including a
touchdown, in a six-play, 80-yard,
two-minute drive that exploited a
Stanford secondary that was a step
behind all day long.
"I thought I was going to see a
lot more coverage coming my way,
but 1 guess they felt they had better
athletes than us," McDonald said.
After a punt, Stanford pinned
Arizona State on its own 9-yard line,
and the defensive line mounted the
best pass rush it would all day, but
Walter proved unexpectedly mo
bile, rolling out and hitting McDon
ald fora 53-yard gain down the
right sideline. He later found Cor
nell Canidate out of the backfield
for the nine-yard touchdown.
The Cardinal offense came right
back, as Moore broke through on a
second-down trap and rumbled 68
yards fora touchdown. Freshman

kicker Michael Sgroi missed the
extra point, letting Arizona State
keep a 14-13 lead.
On the next drive, the Cardinal
had its big chance to take control.
Senior safety Colin Branch became
the first man to intercept Walter all
year, and Stanford had the ball on
the Devils' 40-yard line.
On a 50-yard field goal attempt,
Stanford ran a fake, and junior
holder Eric Johnson rolled out to
the right and pushed a pass to
wards Moore, who had no one be
tween him and the end zone. The
pass was a little wide and glanced
off Moore's fingertips. The game
was like that for the Cardinal,
which saw turnovers and miscom
munication turn a bad loss into a
horrible one.
Stanford soon found itself in a
hole, as freshman running back
J.R. Lemon's fumble on the Cardi
nal's next possession led to
Canidate's second touchdown
plunge.
After a short punt, Walter need
ed only one play to find tight end
Mike Pinkard fora touchdown
over Branch and a 28-13 advan
tage late in the first quarter.
