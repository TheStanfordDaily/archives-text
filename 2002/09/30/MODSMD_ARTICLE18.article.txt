## Sun Devils rout Cardinal 65-24 in Pac-10 opener 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
TEMPE, Ariz. â€” The Stanford
football team made history on Sat
urday. Unfortunately for the Car
dinal, it wasn't ihe good kind.
Stanford (1-2, 0-1 Pacific-10
Conference) lost 65-24 to Arizona
Football
Arizona State 65, Stanford 24
State (4-1,1-0), the most points the
Cardinal has ever allowed to the
Sun Devils and the most the Devils
had ever scored in any Pac-10
game.
The Devils' Andrew Walter's
cannon arm was good for 414
yards and five touchdowns, and his
favorite target, the speedy Shaun
McDonald, caught 10 balls for 221
yards and a touchdown, the third
most receiving yards in Arizona
State history.
After the surprisingly lopsided
loss, the Cardinal was more quiet
and stunned than angry.
"I'm at a loss for words," junior
quarterback Chris Lewis said. "We
were making a lot of mental errors,
and they proved to be costly."
The game didn't start off like a

41-point blowout, though, as Stan
ford authoritatively marched
down the field on the opening
drive. Lewis hit sophomore Nick
Sebes with a 47-yard pass on the
first play of the game, and senior
fullback Casey Moore plunged in
fora two-yard touchdown only
1:12 into the game.
Arizona State came right back as
Walter hooked up with McDonald
for three receptions, including a
touchdown, in a six-play, 80-yard,
two-minute drive that exploited a
Stanford secondary that was a step
behind all day long.
"I thought I was going to see a
lot more coverage coming my way,
but 1 guess they felt they had better
athletes than us," McDonald said.
After a punt, Stanford pinned
Arizona State on its own 9-yard line,
and the defensive line mounted the
best pass rush it would all day, but
Walter proved unexpectedly mo
bile, rolling out and hitting McDon
ald fora 53-yard gain down the
right sideline. He later found Cor
nell Canidate out of the backfield
for the nine-yard touchdown.
The Cardinal offense came right
back, as Moore broke through on a
second-down trap and rumbled 68
yards fora touchdown. Freshman

kicker Michael Sgroi missed the
extra point, letting Arizona State
keep a 14-13 lead.
On the next drive, the Cardinal
had its big chance to take control.
Senior safety Colin Branch became
the first man to intercept Walter all
year, and Stanford had the ball on
the Devils' 40-yard line.
On a 50-yard field goal attempt,
Stanford ran a fake, and junior
holder Eric Johnson rolled out to
the right and pushed a pass to
wards Moore, who had no one be
tween him and the end zone. The
pass was a little wide and glanced
off Moore's fingertips. The game
was like that for the Cardinal,
which saw turnovers and miscom
munication turn a bad loss into a
horrible one.
Stanford soon found itself in a
hole, as freshman running back
J.R. Lemon's fumble on the Cardi
nal's next possession led to
Canidate's second touchdown
plunge.
After a short punt, Walter need
ed only one play to find tight end
Mike Pinkard fora touchdown
over Branch and a 28-13 advan
tage late in the first quarter.

Freshman running back J.R. Lemon rushes past two San Jose State defenders. Lemon was limited to only six carries
against Arizona State on Saturday.
Lewis was picked off on the next
drive, leading Teevens to bring in
redshirt freshman Kyle Matter in
hopes of finding some kind of
spark.
"We were concerned about
turnovers, [and] we stalled offen
sively," Teevens said. "Kyle Matter
has been productive for us off the
bench, so we gave him a chance."
Matter led the Cardinal on a
well-orchestrated seven-minute
drive, leading to a 45-yard Sgroi
field goal.
The Sun Devils weren't
slowed, however, as they an
swered right back, and the Stan
ford defense failed to pick up
Skyler Fulton coming out of the
backfield. His 19-yard touch
down reception and a Mike Barth
36-yard field goal after Moore
fumbled 011 the next play from
scrimmage made for the halftime
edge of 38-16.
The second half was much like
the first, as Walter found McDon
ald for 67 yards on the first play,
and Canidate circled through the
entire Stanford defense on a 9-
yard touchdown run. Canidate
would score again seven minutes
later fora .52-16 advantage.
Matter found sophomore tight
end Alex Smith fora 43-yarcl gain
up the right hash, and later con

netted with sophomore wide re
ceiver Teyo Johnson for both a 4-
yard score and the two-point con
version to pull the Cardinal to
within four touchdowns.
The ensuing onside kick was re
covered by Stanford, but an illegal
touch penalty gave Arizona State
the ball.
Devils head coach Dick Koet
ter, who said after the game that
he "would have loved to finish off
a couple more of those drives
with touchdowns," made an ag
gressive call on the first play.
Walter found Daryl Lightfoot,
who beat single coverage fora
perfect 44-yard touchdown to the
left pylon with two minutes left in
the third quarter.
"We had a lot of pressures
called, and the guys weren't get
ting there, and that can leave the
[defensive backs] 011 an island
sometimes," Branch said.
After Matter was picked off,
leading to another Arizona Suite
field goal, Teevens put Lewis back
in t he game for the fourth quarter.
It didn't help, as Lewis was
picked off two more times, TOIOII
fumbled, and Barth kicked anoth
er field goal for the final margin.
"You can't expect a game like
this, but we're pleased, and we'll
enjoy it," Walter said.
Branch added: "The defense
wasn't playing well, the offense
wasn't playing well. You continue
that for four quarters, and there's
no way you can win."
