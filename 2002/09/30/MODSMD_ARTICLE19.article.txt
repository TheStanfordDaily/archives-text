### JIMMY WU EDITORIAL STAFF 
Nobody likes to lose. But for the
previously undefeated and top
ranked Cardinal men's soccer
team, its first loss of the season may
have been a blessing.
Entering its own Nike Invita
tional with an unblemished 7-0
record, Stanford was stunned by
unranked Tulsa 3-1 on Friday
night.

Saturday: Stanford 3, Santa Clara 0

The Golden Hurricanes ex
posed the Cardinal's tendency to
let up near the end of matches and
forced the Stanford players to ex
amine their resolve before their
second game against Bay Area
rival Santa Clara.
However, fora team that just
came off a loss, Stanford still

looked somewhat lackadaisical in
the first halfof the game on against
the Broncos Sunday afternoon.
And then halftime came.
Something at the break ignited
the Cardinal squad as it came out
of the gates with a three-goal blitz
in the first 25 minutes of the sec
ond half.
"The loss against Tulsa was
bad," junior midfielder Abe
Geiger said. "Nobody enjoyed
that, but it helped us because it
showed us that we can't get away
with playing sloppy. Today we
came out and played with much
more discipline."
So far at times, the Cardinal (8-
1) has shown an inability to sustain
solid play for all 90 minutes. For
tunately, its opponents have been
weak enough for the Cardinal to
escape with sloppiness. But as the
competition gets stiffer with Pacif
ic-10 Conference play looming,
Stanford cannot afford any more
late-game letdowns.
The game against Tulsa may
have been the turning point for
the Cardinal, as it sent a rude
wake-up call to coach Bret Simon's
troops.
Things looked very promising
for Stanford when sophomore for
ward Darren Fernandez took a pass
out of the air and headed the ball
past the Golden Hurricane goalie
fora quick 1-0 lead that the team
took into halftime.

After a quick goal in the first
half, the Cardinal defense never
made it back out of the locker
room.
Only nine minutes into the sec
ond half, Tulsa finally broke
through and put one on the score
board, as Golden Hurricane's
leading scorer Ryan Pore knocked
one past Cardinal goalkeeper se
nior Andrew Terris.
With time running down, the
Cardinal defense suddenly dis
appeared.
Pore was able to break through
the center in the 83rd minute and
scored his second goal of the game
— his seventh goal of the season —
to give Tulsa a 2-1 lead.
Stanford made a valiant effort
as the squad continued to push the
ball upfield with some final in
spired play, but several shots went
just far right.
Even with the game almost se
cured and with only three minutes
left, Tulsa made certain of its victo
ry with a third goal.
"We started breaking down at
the end of the first half," Simon
said. "We played overconfident
ly by spreading our offense so
much that we were vulnerable to
counterattacks."
After the loss, the team had a
short rest before playing Santa
Clara yesterday. This may have

been an advantage for the Cardi
nal as the team wasn't allowed to
dwell on the negative emotions
from Friday's game.
Throughout the first half, nei
ther team could figure each
other's defenses, resulting in very
few scoring opportunities. The
first half was filled with sloppy play
and lack of control from both
sides.
Stanford struggled in the ab
sence of senior midfielder Johanes
Mali/a, who, according to Simon,
suffered a hamstring pull on Fri
day night. I le will most likely be
available for the next game.
Even without its leading scorer,
the Cardinal came out of the half
with plenty of desire. The team fi
nally started beating the Santa
Clara offside trap, leading Fernan
dez to put Stanford on the board
with a goal in the 57th minute.
In a spectacular show of offen
sive firepower, Stanford quickly

added a second goal two minutes
later as senior Roger Levesque
blasted a shot off the goalkeeper
and crossbar into the net.
The scoring was completed as
sophomore forward James Twell
man took a creative pass from
Levesque and placed it past the
Bronco keeper.
"Friday was an emotional
game, and the guys were dis
traught about losing, so they really
had to gut out," Simon said. "Santa
Clara's offside trap disrupted the
flow of the game, and it took a
while to solve that. It was the forti
tude of the players that brought
the victory."
After a match at home this
Thursday against San Jose State,
the Cardinal will begin its Pac-10
schedule against Washington
and Oregon State the following
weekend.
"1 think we've looked good at
times and weak at times," Simon
said. "It's natural for the first half
of the season. We're still trying to
figure out the best combinations.
We're not 100 percent in sync yet,
but we'll get there."
