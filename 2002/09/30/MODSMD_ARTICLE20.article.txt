### ERIK SPERLING STAFF WRITER 
The clouds overhanging the
Stanford golf course Saturday
morning were a welcome change
from the oppressive heat that nor
mally characterizes the Stanford
Invitational. But by mid-afternoon
the sun had come out, and as usual
there was little respite for the visit
ing teams.

Women's Cross Country
Saturday: No. 3 Stanford finishes first
in the 4,000-and 6,000-meter events at
the Stanford Invitational.

For the fourth year in a row, the
Stanford women's cross country
team earned a victory at its home
meet. Stanford sophomore Sara
Bei won the 6,000-meter event iti a
time of 20 minutes, 2 seconds.
Sophomore Alicia Craig and se

second-place finishes in the 6,000
and 4,000, respectively.

In the 4,000, the Cardinal,
with 75 points, defeated Wiscon

fast start, Emilie Mondor of
Simon Fraser jumped to an early
lead, gaining 50 meters over an
elite pack of four that included
Stanford runners Fleshman and
senior Malindi Elmore.
Fleshman, a two-time NCAA
5,000-meter champion on the
track and winner of the 5,000 at
the Invitational last year, ap
peared to have Mondor right
where she wanted her. Consensus
among the fans near the finishing
chute was that the sophomore
from Canada had gone out too
fast, and when the inevitable melt
down came, the Stanford racer
would run her down.
But when the racers emerged
from the lower end of the course,
Mondor had not only held off
Fleshman's charge, but had in
creased the gap to 150 meters, win
ning the race with a time of 13:32.
"I let Emilie get too far ahead

in the first mile," Fleshman said.
"I was in cruise control the next
three kilometers. I found myself
wishing it was a six [kilometer]. I

felt like I could go farther but
not much faster. But it's a good
