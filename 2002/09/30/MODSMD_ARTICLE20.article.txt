# Women runners win Invitational
## 
### ERIK SPERLING STAFF WRITER 
The clouds overhanging the
Stanford golf course Saturday
morning were a welcome change
from the oppressive heat that nor
mally characterizes the Stanford
Invitational. But by mid-afternoon
the sun had come out, and as usual
there was little respite for the visit
ing teams.

Women's Cross Country
Saturday: No. 3 Stanford finishes first
in the 4,000-and 6,000-meter events at
the Stanford Invitational.

For the fourth year in a row, the
Stanford women's cross country
team earned a victory at its home
meet. Stanford sophomore Sara
Bei won the 6,000-meter event iti a
time of 20 minutes, 2 seconds.
Sophomore Alicia Craig and se
nior Lauren Fleshman recorded
second-place finishes in the 6,000
and 4,000, respectively.

In the 4,000, the Cardinal,
with 75 points, defeated Wiscon
sin (83) and Purdue (89). After a
fast start, Emilie Mondor of
Simon Fraser jumped to an early
lead, gaining 50 meters over an
elite pack of four that included
Stanford runners Fleshman and
senior Malindi Elmore.
Fleshman, a two-time NCAA
5,000-meter champion on the
track and winner of the 5,000 at
the Invitational last year, ap
peared to have Mondor right
where she wanted her. Consensus
among the fans near the finishing
chute was that the sophomore
from Canada had gone out too
fast, and when the inevitable melt
down came, the Stanford racer
would run her down.
But when the racers emerged
from the lower end of the course,
Mondor had not only held off
Fleshman's charge, but had in
creased the gap to 150 meters, win
ning the race with a time of 13:32.
"I let Emilie get too far ahead

in the first mile," Fleshman said.
"I was in cruise control the next
three kilometers. I found myself
wishing it was a six [kilometer]. I

felt like I could go farther but
not much faster. But it's a good

we run at nationals."
Fleshrnan's time of 13:48 easily
netted her second, while other Stan
ford runners scoring points includ
ed fourth-place Elmore (13:56), se
nior Katie Hotchkiss (15th, 14:54),
freshman Yfa Kretzschmar (22nd,
15:10) and freshman Rachel
Urbina (38th, 15:48).
In the 6,000, Bei and Craig al
most duplicated their finish from
the season-opening Cal State
Fullerton Invitational, during
which the two teammates finished
so close together that the judges
could not distinguish between first
and second.
After the hectic start, the Stan
ford pair immediately went to the
front, with the remainder of the
Stanford team packed closely be
hind them. The No. 18 Wisconsin,
No. 8 Duke and No. 12 UCLA
teams also formed packs near the
head of affairs.
"The first part of the course is re
ally flat and fast, so we were able to
just go to the front and cruise to
gether," Bei said.
Although the relatively slow pace

for the first several kilometers al
lowed the field to bunch up and led
to the strategic packing, the Cardi
nal duo was obviously in control.
"It makes me so relaxed to run
with [Alicia]," Bei said. "We're not
being competitive, we're just work
ing together. We talk during the
race and encourage each other."
As the race wore on, the Stan
ford runners simply upped the
pace and dropped the rest of the
field. With third place more than
45 seconds behind, Bei took a
slight victory over Craig for the
first collegiate victory of her cross
country career.
"Its exciting. My summer train
ing went very well, and I've stayed
completely healthy," Bei said. "I
think it's going to be a great season."
Senior Erin Sullivan (9th,
21:19), sophomore Anita Siraki
(12th, 21:30) and freshman Kristin
Cohoon (30th, 22:10) also scored
points for the Cardinal. Stanford,
with 50 points, won the team com
petition ahead of Duke (74), UCLA
(85) and Wisconsin (121), which was
in contention fora higher placing
until the Badgers' fifth runner
faded to 87th place.
The Cardinal will next see action
at the Notre Dame Invitational on
Friday in South Bend, Ind.
