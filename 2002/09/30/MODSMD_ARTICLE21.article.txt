# Football learns hard lessons in Ariz. desert
## 
### MATT LONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Fans saw everything new Stan
ford coach Buddy Teevens had
been promising in Saturday's
game at Arizona State. A high
powered passing offense, blazing
speed on both sides of the ball
and enough points on the score
board to win three separate foot
ball games. The contest had all
that and more.
The surprising thing for the
Cardinal was that most of the
"gun,"and all of the "fun" be
longed to the Sun Devils in their
05-24 annihilation of Stanford.
So where exactly does the stag
gering loss place the Cardinal,
just three games into the season?
It was Stanford's most embar
rassing loss since a 69-17 defeat at
Texas two years ago. Somehow
Stanford rebounded from that to
win the Pacific-10 Conference and
reach its first Rose Bowl in 27 years.
Don't expect that this time around.
Arizona State is far from Texas. It
has been a conference doormat the
past few years, and didn't look that
much better this season with a 48-
10 opening loss to a Nebraska
squad that just tell out of the top-25
for the first time since 1981 fol
lowed by a comeback squeaker
against lowly San Diego State.
But Stanford made the Sun
Devils look like national title con
tenders.

And it's surely not getting any
easier in the next two weeks, when
the Cardinal will meet true BCS
hopefuls in No. 9 Notre Dame
and No. 17 Washington State.
Of course, Stanford wasn't
helped by the absence of two im
portant offensive playmakers, se
nior tailback Kerry Carter and
junior flanker Luke Powell. But
while Powell and Carter failed to
board the team plane to Tempe
because of injury, what was the
entire Cardinal defense's excuse?
It seemed at times that every
one knew Sun Devil quarterback
Andrew Walter was going deep.
The announcers, the fans, the re
ferrees, all watched as Shaun Mc
donald or Daryl Lightfoot or any
of countless other Devil receivers
lined up, expecting a streak to
wards the end zone. Everyone
knew, that is, except for the Stan
ford secondary.
Fime and again Teevens has
praised his young defense on one
account: its extraordinary speed.
That seemed to be the main in
gredient missing Saturday, as
sophomore cornerbacks Leigh
Torrence and Stanley Wilson
and senior safety Colin Branch
were consistently playing
catchup.
As if the score doesn't say
enough about the Cardinal's lack
of defensive presence, after the

game Arizona State tailback Cor
nell Canidate, who scored four
touchdowns in his first collegiate
start, compared it to his days of
domination in high school.
If not fora strong start, the
Cardinal offense may have
matched the defense in futility.
Neither starting quarterback ju
nior Chris Lewis or redshirt
freshman backup Kyle Matter

showed any poise or consistency
in the pocket, often missing their
receivers and throwing into tight
coverage. They combined for
four interceptions. The running
backs didn't help things much,
coughing up the ball three times
to the hard-nosed Sun Devils.
This isn't a veteran laden team
like in 1999. While the Texas loss
was a huge motivation to that
squad and incited a march for re
demption that led to Pasadena,
this humiliation can't do any
thing but severely harm the con
fidence of the young Cardinal.

Teevens will give the customary
"the only way to go from here is
up" speech. The senior captains
will rant and rave to try to inspire
the underclassmen.
Stanford does have the talent
and gameplan to compete in the
Pac-10. Its offensive firepower
might even have the potential to
carry the team to a few surprise
wins this season. For now, the
Cardinal knows how bad things
can be and will toil to ensure that
they never are this bad again.
But in the meantime, the Stan
ford community will grit its col

lective teeth and watch across the
Bay, awaiting the most important
game of the year, whose outcome
is even more up in the air than
who will start at quarterback for
the Cardinal next Saturday.
Senior defensive tackle Matt
Leonard compared Saturday's ef
fort to the "Bad News Bears."
But there is one bit of good
news for the Cardinal at this
point in the season; whoever
scheduled Stanford for just 11
games instead of the 12 that most
other schools are playing can take
all the credit for that.
