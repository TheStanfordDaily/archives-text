### EMIL MARTINSEK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Under nearly perfect conditions
on the Stanford Golf Course, the
Stanford men's cross country team
proved that it is one of the best
teams in the nation.

Men's Cross Country
No. 3 Stanford finishes first
in the 4,000-meter event and finishes
third in the 8,000-meter event at the
Stanford Invitational.

The top-ranked Cardinal split
in two to race both the 4,000-
meter and 8,000-meter courses at
the Stanford Invitational. The
Cardinal came out with a victory
in the 4,000 and placed third in
the 8,000.
During the 4,000, sophomore
Ryan Hall ran away from senior
teammate Seth 1 lejny and Mon
tana's Scott McGowan early and
never looked back. Hall covered
the distance in 11 minutes, 49 sec
onds, putting him 24 seconds
ahead of Hejny in second place.
Behind Hall and Hejny, fresh
man Justin Romaniuk led a trio of
Cardinal runners into the finish
chute to complete the scoring. Ro
maniuk placed sixth with a time of
12:23, followed by juniors Steve
Loughlin and Andy Powell in sev
enth and eighth, respectively.
The team scored a low 21
points to easily outdistance the
runner-up Grizzlies, who
scored 46.
" 11 felt great to be back in a Stan
ford uniform," 1 lall said. "I want to
contribute to the team. The team
looks awesome this year."
The race marked Hall's first
Stanford competition since last
cross country season. Last winter,
an injury forced him to miss the in
door and outdoor track seasons,

but his goals for this new season do
not seem diminished.
"Lord willing, 1 will be an Ail-
American this year," Hall said. "I
want to help us win nationals."
In the B,ooo,junior lan Dobson
ran with the front pack for about
6,000 meters before pulling away
for his own 24-second victory over
Cameron Clarke of New Mexico.
Dobson crossed the finish line in
23:27.
Dobson, however, ran unat
tached to protect his redshirt
status and did not count in the
team scoring.
"I have really increased my
mileage," Dobson said. "It was just
a precaution. I don't think I will
redshirt the season, but we want to
be sure I won't get injured.
"I did five or six weeks over 100
miles this summer. It feels like I am
in the best shape ever."
Freshmen Peter Meindl and
Brett Gotcher ran unattached as
well in their first collegiate races,
placing third and sixth, respective
ly. They both made a fantastic
debut, respectively touring the
course in 23:52 and 24:01.
But without these top runners
to count in the scoring, the Cardi
nal only managed a third-place
showing as a team. New Mexico
claimed the team title with 61
points under Cal Poly's 66. Stiin
ford scored 84 points.
Junior Adam Tenforde led the
Stanford team effort with an
eighth-place finish in 24:02. He wits
followed closely by freshman Neil
Davis, who placed ninth.
Rounding out the scoring for
the Cardinal were juniors Isaac
Hawkins, Andrew Hill and Sean
Knapp in 23rd, 43rd and 45th,
respectively.
Missing from the lineup this
week were three key returning
cross country All-Americans. Ju

niors Don Sage, Louis Luchini and
Grant Robison are all scheduled to
make their season debuts in tiie
next few weeks.
With recent strong perfor
mances from No. 2 Arkansas, No. 5
Northern Arizona and No. 9 Ore

gon, Cardinal fans are anxious to
see if Stanford can make a run for
its third national tide in seven years.
The Cardinal continues its pur
suit of a national championship on
Friday at the Notre Dame Invita
tional in South Bend, Ind.
