Field Hockey
Saturday: Stanford 1, Pacific 0 OT

This is the way it seems to be for
the team, which, after Saturday's
1-0 overtime win over conference
foe Pacific (1 -6,0-2), has had its last
four games decided by one goal,
and its last two games decided in
extra time.
During Saturday's contest, se
nior defender Tysie Sawyer came
up with the big play to ice the
game, assisted by senior defender
Amrit Chima, who leads the team
in points with 11.
"It was a frustrating game
today. We were a little sluggish,"
Sawyer said. "We have been real
ly working on scoring in practice,
working on rebounds and lots of
crossballs. But the win is the real

ly important thing, it's a confer
ence game, and it's good to have
that momentum going into a
road trip."
The Cardinal goes on a long
road trip starting next weekend,
where it will face Saint Louis twice
in three days, followed by SW Mis
souri State. After its Missouri jaunt,
Stanford will be back in the Ray
Area to face No. 14 California in
Berkeley on Oct. 12. The Cardinal
returns home on Oct. 20 to face
Yale.
"All of our conference games
are extremely important, and we
have two more coming up this
weekend," said head coach Sheryl
Johnson, who is in her last year
coaching the team. "We look at the
next conference game as the most
important game of the season."
Senior tri-captain Christina
Williams echoed the comments of
her coach.
"It was nice to get a win in over
time, especially after the overtime
loss to [No. 12] lowa [on Sept. 22].
Finishing is still frustrating for us,
but we're very happy to get the win."
Williams also commented on the
fan support for the team, a group of
10 to 15 students, mostly from the
Kappa Sigma fraternity, that has

harassed the opposing goalkeeper
and has supported the Cardinal.
"We love the Kappa Sig heck
lers," Williams said. "They really do
inspire us. Especially entering a
three-game Saint Louis road trip, it's
nice to have fan support at home."

1 tie Cardinal enters the road
trip leading the NorPac with a 2-
0 record, having won their last
12 of 14 games against NorPac
opponents.
"We're looking to go 3-0 on the
road," Willams said.
