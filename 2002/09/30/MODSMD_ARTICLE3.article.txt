# University, county face off over trails
## 
### ALEX BLEYLEBEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
A trail plan that many had
hoped would be in its final stages
by now is still lingering as Stan
ford, community members,
lawyers, politicians and environ
mentalists haggle in an intense de
bate over the compliance of a per
mit signed in December 2000.
The battle has intensified since
Aug. 30, when Stanford refused to
pay for an environmental study
demanded by Santa Clara County.
The General Use Permit allows
Stanford to develop 5 million
square feet of new buildings, in
cluding 3,000 housing units, be
tween now and 2010. As mitiga
tions for the new developments,
Stanford agreed to abide by 128
conditions - one of which is t he re
quirement to dedicate two trails
along the eastern and western pe
ripheries of its lands..
When the permit was signed,
rough alignments for these trails
— the SI and CI trails — were
provided. But problems quickly
arose as the exact alignment of
these trails was heavily disputed,
especially the easement of the CI
trail that is to run along San Fran
cisquito Creek in the northwestern
part of campus.
Stanford has proposed two
possible alignments that it thinks
satisfy all of the given require
ments. However, environmental
ists have opposed both alternatives
because of biologically sensitive
areas, and others are upset be
cause much of one of the proposed

trails would not lie on Stanford
land.
This has prompted other par
ties to propose new trail align
ments.
On June 21, Santa Clara Coun
ty requested that Stanford pay
$172,555 to fund an environmen
tal study on nine possible trail
alignments, several of which make
deep cuts into Stanford land.
Stanford steadfastly opposes
any trail making deep cuts into its
lands and flatly refused to fund a
study that would consider those
trails.
"The proposed study will serve
only to mislead the public by mak
ing it appear that other trails are
viable options," wrote Stanford at
torney Barbara Schussman in re
sponse to Santa Clara County's re
quest for money.
She concluded, "... the Coun
ty should not proceed with a sup
plemental EIR (Environmental
Impact Report) that is not re
quired, is based on erroneous legal
standards, will study trails that are
not feasible and will cause unnec
essary expense and delay in the
implementation of the trails re
quirement that Stanford has ill
ready met."
Larry Horton, director of gov
ernment and community relations
at Stanford, agreed, saying that
the University has no intention of
paying to study trails that it be
lieves fall outside of the GUP.
"It is true that we do pay for
any required environmental
