# University, county face off over trails
## 
### ALEX BLEYLEBEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
A trail plan that many had
hoped would be in its final stages
by now is still lingering as Stan
ford, community members,
lawyers, politicians and environ
mentalists haggle in an intense de
bate over the compliance of a per
mit signed in December 2000.
The battle has intensified since
Aug. 30, when Stanford refused to
pay for an environmental study
demanded by Santa Clara County.
The General Use Permit allows
Stanford to develop 5 million
square feet of new buildings, in
cluding 3,000 housing units, be
tween now and 2010. As mitiga
tions for the new developments,
Stanford agreed to abide by 128
conditions - one of which is t he re
quirement to dedicate two trails
along the eastern and western pe
ripheries of its lands..
When the permit was signed,
rough alignments for these trails
— the SI and CI trails — were
provided. But problems quickly
arose as the exact alignment of
these trails was heavily disputed,
especially the easement of the CI
trail that is to run along San Fran
cisquito Creek in the northwestern
part of campus.
Stanford has proposed two
possible alignments that it thinks
satisfy all of the given require
ments. However, environmental
ists have opposed both alternatives
because of biologically sensitive
areas, and others are upset be
cause much of one of the proposed

trails would not lie on Stanford
land.
This has prompted other par
ties to propose new trail align
ments.
On June 21, Santa Clara Coun
ty requested that Stanford pay
$172,555 to fund an environmen
tal study on nine possible trail
alignments, several of which make
deep cuts into Stanford land.
Stanford steadfastly opposes
any trail making deep cuts into its
lands and flatly refused to fund a
study that would consider those
trails.
"The proposed study will serve
only to mislead the public by mak
ing it appear that other trails are
viable options," wrote Stanford at
torney Barbara Schussman in re
sponse to Santa Clara County's re
quest for money.
She concluded, "... the Coun
ty should not proceed with a sup
plemental EIR (Environmental
Impact Report) that is not re
quired, is based on erroneous legal
standards, will study trails that are
not feasible and will cause unnec
essary expense and delay in the
implementation of the trails re
quirement that Stanford has ill
ready met."
Larry Horton, director of gov
ernment and community relations
at Stanford, agreed, saying that
the University has no intention of
paying to study trails that it be
lieves fall outside of the GUP.
"It is true that we do pay for
any required environmental

work that the county staff legiti
mately has to do in implementa
tion of the General Use Permit.
Buit in this case, we have said and
our lawyers have said . . . that
these cannot be required of us. If
these trails cannot be legally im
posed on us, then we will not pay
for those studies."
In the wake of Stanford's rejec
tion of an environmental study, the
county has been left to decide what
to do next. Mike Carlson, a policy
aid to the supervisor in Santa Clara
County, defended the need to look
at a variety of trail options.
"We need to study a reasonable
range of trail alternatives," he said.
"We can't just study one. That's not
a reasonable range."
At various council meetings
over the past two years, many
have stepped up to question Stan
ford's commitment to fulfilling the
trail's requirement of the GUP,
with some reports that the school
may now be regretting some of the
other conditions it entered into.

Stanford officials, however, con
tinually state that the school is fully
committed to all conditions in the
GUP, including to the process of
aligning the two trails.
According to a letter by Gordon
Earle, vice president for public af
fairs at the University, Stanford has
"already spent nearly $500,000 in
planning trail routes and expects to
spend a total of $8 million on their
design and construction."
Attorneys for the University also
say that by signing the GUP the
school has committed itself to spend
over $ 100 million to comply with all
128 conditions.
Stanford has said that it will fund
a study once an alignment has been
decided upon.
But Jeff Segall of the Stanford
Open Space Alliance questioned
whether one of the school's pro
posals is even feasible. With much
of the trail running through pri
vate property not belonging to
Stanford, he pointed out that
there may be issues in getting the
route secured.
He said that the peripheral trails
offered by Stanford pose the "ques
tion if they can ever be implement
ed .... What assurance does Santa

Clara County have that Stanford
can run a trail through- there? My
answer is none whatsoever."
The issue was complicated last
week when Menlo Park approved
the widening of Sand Hill Road, a
move that sets the stage for Stanford
to run a trail alongside of what will
become a four-lane road.
This trail runs where Stanford
has proposed to place the CI
alignment, and some accuse the
school of trying to skirt the trail
controversy by building the Sand
Hill trail and then claiming com
pliance with the GUP.
Santa Clara County has not yet
decided how it will deal with Stan
ford's refusal to pay for the Envi
ronmental Impact Report. The
county planning commission will
be officially briefed on the refusal
and then decide what to do next.
If the planning commission finds
the school out of compliance with
the GUP, legal action is possible.
Whether the problem heads to
the courts or whether the 12- to
18-month-long process of compil
ing an Environmental Impact Re
port takes place, the trails contro
versy is expected to continue for
quite some time.
