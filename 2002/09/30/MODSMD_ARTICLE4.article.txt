# Stanford prof may head FDA
## Bush nominates Economics and Medicine Prof. Mark McClellan to lead key federal agency 
### ALI ALEMOZAFAR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford prof, and physician Mark McClellan
has been nominated by U.S. President George
W. Bush to lead the Food and Drug Administra
tion, ending a long-running stalemate between
the White House and Democrats on Capitol Hill
over who should run the agency, which has had
no commissioner since Bush took office 20
months ago.
Currently a member of the White House
Council of Economics Advisors, McClellan has
been on leave from Stanford for over a year. He
also served as deputy treasury secretary in the
Clinton Administration.
As commissioner of the FDA, McClellan
would be heading an agency that regulates the
safety of drugs, medical devices, food and cos
metics â€” products that make lip a quarter of the

national economy.
Prof. John Pencavel, chair of the Economics
Department, commented on McClellan's nom
ination.
"McClellan is unusual as an FDA head in that
he is both an economist and a physician," Pen
cavel said. "When he was last at Stanford, he
spent one day a week seeing patients at Stan
ford's Hospital."
McClellan is a former practicing internist. Re
cent FDA chiefs also have all been physicians.
After obtaining his B.A. from the University
of Texas, McClellan received a Ph.D. in eco
nomics from Mff and an M.D. from Harvard.
"I believe this interesting background will
give him a much wider perspective on issues,
and he will make fora terrific appointment,"
Pencavel said.
McClellan's nomination fates a senatorial con
firmation. According to congressional aides, the
Senate most likely will confirm McClellan.
"Dr. McClellan has impressive credentials
both as a physician and economist. I look for
ward to learning more about his views on issues
critical to the FDA," Sen. Edward Kennedy, who
heads the committee that will consider the nom-

i nation, told the Associated Press.
McClellan is well known for studies of the eco
nomic and policy factors that influence medical
treatment conditions. He helped draft the Bush
administration policy on prescription drug cov
erage for older people.
McClellan has developed innovative ways to
study patient care that could bring a fresh per
spective to the FDA. The Bush administration
also considers him an attractive candidate be
cause he has a good relationship with many law
makers, according to the AP.
"He's a very, very smart guy," Alan Garber, a
health-economics professor at Stanford Universi
ty, told Newsday. "[He] lias [a] very sophisticated
understanding of policy and the many needs that
need to be balanced in setting policies, including
those governing drug approval."
The road to McClellan has been long and ar
duous for the Bush administration. In July 2001,
Bush nominated Michael Astrue, a biotechnolo
gy industry lawyer, but Senate Democrats com
plained that Astrue was too close to industry.
This February, the administration made an-
other attempt with Dr. AlastairJ. J.
Wood,, a drug safety expert at
Vanderbilt University, but phar
maceutical executives complained
that he would be too aggressive a
regulator.
At that point the administration
named the deputy commissioner,
Dr. Lester Crawford, a veterinari
an who is a food-safety expert, to
run the agency until a permanent
chief could be found. Tommy G.
Thompson, the secretary of health
and human services, favored
Crawford for the top job, but the
White House was said to want a
physician.
"Mark is a genuine, thoughtful,
decent, smart public official," Ron
Pollack, the executive director of
Families USA told the NY Times.
"Despite our disagreements, he has
my utmost respect."
"[McClellan] is an excellent
economist... it is difficult to envis
age a better person for this impor
tant position that involves assessing
risks and benefits," Pencavel said.
