# Construction underway on controversial East Palo Alto IKEA
## 
### MARK DOMINIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
Having overcome fierce opposi
tion from members of the local
community, IKEA is set to open its
second Bay Area store next August
in East Palo Alto.
Work began in July on the site,
which lies at the southeast corner of
University Avenue and Highway
101. IKEA estimates that construc
tion will be completed on Aug. 27,
2003.
The East Palo Alto site was fa
vored by IKEA because of its visibil
ity and proximity to the highway.
IKEA fought a hard battle to get
the store approved. Many East Palo
Altans objected to the scale of the
store — which was originally de
signed to be 75 feet tall — and said
that they would prefer a supermar

ket that served the local community
over a yuppie furniture store that
would bring in outside business.
But after the Scandinavian fur
niture giant spent more than
$ 147,000 to promote the idea of an
IKEA in East Palo Alto, the com
munity voted in favor of the pro
posed store.
Since that time, IKEA has taken
measures to meet concerns ex
pressed by residents during the
fight to get the store approved.
"We worked hard to improve
on-site circulation to address some
of the traffic concerns," said Doug
Greenholz, IKEA real estate man
ager. "We also extended a deceler
ation lane and added a lane to East
Bayshore Drive to improve circula
tion. Our design also included low
ering the building. The top of the
peripet was originally 75 feet, and

now it's 60 feet."
Since the construction began in
mid-July, prep work has been clone
on the site, and construction of the
foundation is now underway.
"We have done the grading of
the site, vegetation clearing and
there has been pile driving going
on on-site as part of the founda
tion," Greenholz said. "That's
where we're at now."
"We're now in the middle of
doing the pile driving. What will
come next is the completion of the
foundation, and then we'll start to
see elements come out of the
ground," he added. "It's a very
tight construction schedule but
we're still on-schedule fora store
opening in August 0f2003."
Fora community with a history
of budget difficulties and low tax
revenues, IKEA could be a fiscal

godsend. According to the Palo Alto
Weekly, the store exceeds both the
size and number of jobs of every
thing built before it at the Gateway /
101 center in East Palo Alto.
"It's estimated that through
property and sales taxes, we will
bring $1.8 million a year to the city
of East Palo Alto," Greenholz said.
"Of the sales-tax portion, 1 million
is guaranteed to the city by IKEA
for the next eight years."
Ricardo Noguera, redevelop
ment and economic development
manager for the city of East Palo
Alto, spoke about the economic
benefits IKEA will bring to the c ity.
"That project alone [IKEA] is
probably one of the best projects —
one of the most successful projects
— I've worked on in 13 years.

The foundation for the East Palo Alto IKEA is being laid at the corner of Uni
versity Ave. and Highway 101. When completed, the store is expected to
bring nearly $2 million of tax revenue a year to the city.
