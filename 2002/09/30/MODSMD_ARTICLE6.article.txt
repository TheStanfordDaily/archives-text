# Construction underway on controversial East Palo Alto IKEA
## 
### MARK DOMINIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
Having overcome fierce opposi
tion from members of the local
community, IKEA is set to open its
second Bay Area store next August
in East Palo Alto.
Work began in July on the site,
which lies at the southeast corner of
University Avenue and Highway
101. IKEA estimates that construc
tion will be completed on Aug. 27,
2003.
The East Palo Alto site was fa
vored by IKEA because of its visibil
ity and proximity to the highway.
IKEA fought a hard battle to get
the store approved. Many East Palo
Altans objected to the scale of the
store — which was originally de
signed to be 75 feet tall — and said
that they would prefer a supermar

ket that served the local community
over a yuppie furniture store that
would bring in outside business.
But after the Scandinavian fur
niture giant spent more than
$ 147,000 to promote the idea of an
IKEA in East Palo Alto, the com
munity voted in favor of the pro
posed store.
Since that time, IKEA has taken
measures to meet concerns ex
pressed by residents during the
fight to get the store approved.
"We worked hard to improve
on-site circulation to address some
of the traffic concerns," said Doug
Greenholz, IKEA real estate man
ager. "We also extended a deceler
ation lane and added a lane to East
Bayshore Drive to improve circula
tion. Our design also included low
ering the building. The top of the
peripet was originally 75 feet, and

now it's 60 feet."
Since the construction began in
mid-July, prep work has been clone
on the site, and construction of the
foundation is now underway.
"We have done the grading of
the site, vegetation clearing and
there has been pile driving going
on on-site as part of the founda
tion," Greenholz said. "That's
where we're at now."
"We're now in the middle of
doing the pile driving. What will
come next is the completion of the
foundation, and then we'll start to
see elements come out of the
ground," he added. "It's a very
tight construction schedule but
we're still on-schedule fora store
opening in August 0f2003."
Fora community with a history
of budget difficulties and low tax
revenues, IKEA could be a fiscal

godsend. According to the Palo Alto
Weekly, the store exceeds both the
size and number of jobs of every
thing built before it at the Gateway /
101 center in East Palo Alto.
"It's estimated that through
property and sales taxes, we will
bring $1.8 million a year to the city
of East Palo Alto," Greenholz said.
"Of the sales-tax portion, 1 million
is guaranteed to the city by IKEA
for the next eight years."
Ricardo Noguera, redevelop
ment and economic development
manager for the city of East Palo
Alto, spoke about the economic
benefits IKEA will bring to the c ity.
"That project alone [IKEA] is
probably one of the best projects —
one of the most successful projects
— I've worked on in 13 years.

The foundation for the East Palo Alto IKEA is being laid at the corner of Uni
versity Ave. and Highway 101. When completed, the store is expected to
bring nearly $2 million of tax revenue a year to the city.
"With the tax revenue generat
ed by IKEA, we're going to up
grade our storm drainage system,
and we're going to upgrade our
streets," Noguera said.
The store will also generate 550
new jobs, of which at least 30 per
cent will be filled by East Palo Alto
residents. Many locals have already
been hired as members of the
upper management at the store.
"A woman from East Palo Alto is
the construction manager, and
there is also a high-level finance
person from the city," Noguera
said.
Officials say the anticipated ar
rival of the store in East Palo Alto
has done a great deal to revive the
business climate in the community.
"What this has already done is
that 1 have other retailers knocking
on my door," Noguera said. "If 1
had more land, Pier One Imports
could locate in East Palo Alto. Five
years ago they wouldn't have even
looked at us."
Noguera said that other retailers
at the corner of Highway 101 and

University Avenue are already see
ing increases in sales because of the
anticipated arrival of IKEA.
"People are coming to that shop
ping center now not only because of
niche in home improvement and
decor, but to patronize other busi
nesses," Noguera said. "IKEA will
bring in a lot of traffic, but will posi
tively enhance current retailers."
Noguera said that he hopes to
attract a supermarket to the shop
ping center in the future. However,
a shortage of land within t he devel
opment boundaries makes finding
an appropriate site difficult.
"I've been dying to bring in a su
permarket, but I haven't been able
to get together the land," Noguera
said. "We're going to have to get in
dividual land owners together."
"IKEA will serve as a magnet for
a supermarket. Maybe other super
markets will shrink their footprint
to accommodate our market," he
added.
Noguera said that redevelop
ment in East Palo Alto aims to build
the community's financial future.
"The end result is to benefit the
local residents by bringing in dol
lars from outside the community,"
Noguera said. "That's what rede
velopment is all about."

The foundation for the East Palo Alto IKEA is being laid at the corner of Uni
versity Ave. and Highway 101. When completed, the store is expected to
bring nearly $2 million of tax revenue a year to the city.
"With the tax revenue generat
ed by IKEA, we're going to up
grade our storm drainage system,
and we're going to upgrade our
streets," Noguera said.
The store will also generate 550
new jobs, of which at least 30 per
cent will be filled by East Palo Alto
residents. Many locals have already
been hired as members of the
upper management at the store.
"A woman from East Palo Alto is
the construction manager, and
there is also a high-level finance
person from the city," Noguera
said.
Officials say the anticipated ar
rival of the store in East Palo Alto
has done a great deal to revive the
business climate in the community.
"What this has already done is
that 1 have other retailers knocking
on my door," Noguera said. "If 1
had more land, Pier One Imports
could locate in East Palo Alto. Five
years ago they wouldn't have even
looked at us."
Noguera said that other retailers
at the corner of Highway 101 and

University Avenue are already see
ing increases in sales because of the
anticipated arrival of IKEA.
"People are coming to that shop
ping center now not only because of
niche in home improvement and
decor, but to patronize other busi
nesses," Noguera said. "IKEA will
bring in a lot of traffic, but will posi
tively enhance current retailers."
Noguera said that he hopes to
attract a supermarket to the shop
ping center in the future. However,
a shortage of land within t he devel
opment boundaries makes finding
an appropriate site difficult.
"I've been dying to bring in a su
permarket, but I haven't been able
to get together the land," Noguera
said. "We're going to have to get in
dividual land owners together."
"IKEA will serve as a magnet for
a supermarket. Maybe other super
markets will shrink their footprint
to accommodate our market," he
added.
Noguera said that redevelop
ment in East Palo Alto aims to build
the community's financial future.
"The end result is to benefit the
local residents by bringing in dol
lars from outside the community,"
Noguera said. "That's what rede
velopment is all about."
