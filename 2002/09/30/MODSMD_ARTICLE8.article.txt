# Undergrad Senate holds first meeting
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
The ASSU Undergraduate
Senate held its first meeting of the
academic year last night. There
was little controversy at this open
ing meeting, as representatives
discussed a number of different is
sues pertinent to undergraduates
in the upcoming months.
One of the initial topics of dis
cussion was a dorm representation
scheme that the Senate hopes to
implement this year. ASSU Vice
President Nick Rodriguez, a ju
nior, discussed the goals behind
the program.
"Each dorm will have a person
who responds to an overall com
mittee," Rodriguez said. "They
will meet in small group sessions
and also be active on our discus
sion board which we have set up .
. . they are both there to give us
information as well as be de facto
disseminators of information."
Myisha Patterson, a senior and
deputy chair of the Senate, under
scored this desire to keep the Sen
ate in contact with the undergrad
uate body.
"We are going to have each sen
ator make contact with RAs from
the dorms," Patterson said. "[The
senators] will go to the house meet
ings to let people know about sen
ate issues."
The Senate also discussed po
tential changes to the ASSU Con
stitution's by-laws, as well as reme
dying vacancies that need to be
filled on the ASSU's Constitutional
Council.
"We talked about our priorities
for the year, [such as] working out
kinks in the by-laws," said junior
Connie Chen, a senator. "Each
committee has to have a majority

to vote, but also, everyone has to be
there; there is no proxy voting as
of now .... We were thin king
drawing up a couple amendments
to the by-laws."

Another issue on the Senate
agenda was the shutdown of Cal-
Train service on the weekends.
"For transportation, a lot of the
initiatives we are working on are to

complement or supplement the
Call rain issue," said sophomore
Joey Natoli, a senator. "The week
end service is going to be closed
down fora long time."
Natoli explained what the Sen
ate is trying to do to alleviate the
problem of finding weekend trans
portation for undergraduates.
" The CalTrain has a bus that
stops in Palo Alto, but it cuts oil
early [time-wise]," Natoli said. "We
are looking at piloting a program
where we would run a shuttle late
on Friday and Saturday nights so
that students could stay in the city
longer. But there are some risk
management issues right now."
The Senate is also seeking to
make rental cars more accessible to
the student population.
"The transportation people
right now are taking in competi
tive bids fora private rental pro
gram," Natoli said. "You could
rent a car for smaller periods than
an entire day, such as a four hour
period or per mile. The drawback
though is that people who really
have the problems are those who
are under 21 and are still not al
lowed to rent cars. We are advocat
ing and urging a lower age limit,
and it seems this would make sense
business-wise as well."
Senior James Alva, one of the
senior class presidents, attended
the meeting in order to bring up
issues regarding Full Moon on
the Quad.
"We have secured funding for
the event, but that is just for this
year," Alva said. "The way we got
funding is from all four classes
and from the band, but the prob
lem is that it is just a solution for
this vear. We need to think more

long-term."
Alva explained that he hoped
to establish an appropriation
from the ASSU budget to fund
Full Moon on the Quad in the
future. He also discussed the
specific reason for the recent
shortage of financial support for
the event.
"In the past, an alumni group
funded the Full Moon on the
Quad event, but the group has

been dissolved," /Viva said.
There was only one bill that the
Senate formally proposed and
voted on during the meeting. The
bill, which passed unanimously,
granted ex-officio status to
Michael Bruce, a junior, who in
tends represent the athletes with
in the Stanford student commu
nity at the Senate.
"I met with [Rodriguez] this
summer, and he mentioned that
[ex-officio status] was a possibility,"
Bruce said. "Also I talked to Bo
Cowgill, [the senate chair], and he
was excited about the possibility of
working with student athletes, so

he invited me to come to the meet
ing and state my case."
Bruce explained that a lot of
other universities have representa
tives from the athletic portion of
the student body on their under
graduate senate bodies.
"I would love to be able to help
[the Senate] and speak out for the
student athletes," Bruce said. "We
are getting our feet wet and want
to see where we can communicate
and get involved to get the student
athlete's voice out there."
The vote on the bill to make
Bruce an ex-officio member of the
Senate passed with little argu

ment. Senators expressed interest
in having other segments of the
student population also be repre
sented in such a manner at Senate
meetings.
"I think if ten people came in
and wanted to be ex-officio mem
bers, I would be fine with it," Na
toli said. "We may want to go pur
sue other groups on campus, if we
feel we are lac king a certain opin
ion or representation."
Before the meeting's dismissal,
the group also established that,
tentatively, future Senate meetings
will be held at 7:00 p.m. on up
coming Tuesday evenings.

that students could stay in the city
longer. But there are some risk
management issues right now."
The Senate is also seeking to
make rental cars more accessible to
the student population.
"The transportation people
right now are taking in competi
tive bids fora private rental pro
gram," Natoli said. "You could
rent a car for smaller periods than
an entire day, such as a four hour
period or per mile. The drawback
though is that people who really
have the problems are those who
are under 21 and are still not al
lowed to rent cars. We are advocat
ing and urging a lower age limit,
and it seems this would make sense
business-wise as well."
Senior James Alva, one of the
senior class presidents, attended
the meeting in order to bring up
issues regarding Full Moon on
the Quad.
"We have secured funding for
the event, but that is just for this
year," Alva said. "The way we got
funding is from all four classes
and from the band, but the prob
lem is that it is just a solution for
this vear. We need to think more

long-term."
Alva explained that he hoped
to establish an appropriation
from the ASSU budget to fund
Full Moon on the Quad in the
future. He also discussed the
specific reason for the recent
shortage of financial support for
the event.
"In the past, an alumni group
funded the Full Moon on the
Quad event, but the group has

been dissolved," /Viva said.
There was only one bill that the
Senate formally proposed and
voted on during the meeting. The
bill, which passed unanimously,
granted ex-officio status to
Michael Bruce, a junior, who in
tends represent the athletes with
in the Stanford student commu
nity at the Senate.
"I met with [Rodriguez] this
summer, and he mentioned that
[ex-officio status] was a possibility,"
Bruce said. "Also I talked to Bo
Cowgill, [the senate chair], and he
was excited about the possibility of
working with student athletes, so

he invited me to come to the meet
ing and state my case."
Bruce explained that a lot of
other universities have representa
tives from the athletic portion of
the student body on their under
graduate senate bodies.
"I would love to be able to help
[the Senate] and speak out for the
student athletes," Bruce said. "We
are getting our feet wet and want
to see where we can communicate
and get involved to get the student
athlete's voice out there."
The vote on the bill to make
Bruce an ex-officio member of the
Senate passed with little argu

ment. Senators expressed interest
in having other segments of the
student population also be repre
sented in such a manner at Senate
meetings.
"I think if ten people came in
and wanted to be ex-officio mem
bers, I would be fine with it," Na
toli said. "We may want to go pur
sue other groups on campus, if we
feel we are lac king a certain opin
ion or representation."
Before the meeting's dismissal,
the group also established that,
tentatively, future Senate meetings
will be held at 7:00 p.m. on up
coming Tuesday evenings.
