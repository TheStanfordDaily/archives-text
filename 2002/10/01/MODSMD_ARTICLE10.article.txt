Hodgson wins award from U.S. Dept. of Energy
Professor of Chemistry and director of the Stanford Synchrotron Ra
diation Laboratory Keith Hodgson was named a recipient of the 2002
E.O. Lawrence Award from the U.S. Department of Energy.
He and the six other recipients will each receive the award of a gold
medal, citation and $25,000 in a ceremony held in late October in Wash
ington, D.C.
l he award recognizes contributions to the development, use and con
trol of nuclear energy. I lodgson's research focuses on using the proper
ties of chemistry and structural biology for x-ray absorption, diffraction
and scattering. He has done pioneering work in synchrotron-based sci
ence and is currently working on the development of a true x-ray laser
at SLAC.
Provost John Etchemendy said, "Keith Hodgson is an enormously
gifted scientist. He has distinguished himself through his own discover
ies, as well as through the work of scientists whose research he has made
possible.
"Under his leadership, SSRL has become one of the leading facilities
for analyzing the structure of biologically important proteins. His work
is likely to have consequences we can only now imagine."
Researchers predict fall of 'Runaway universe'
The long-term future of the Milky Way may be bleak due to the rapid
ly expanding nature of our universe, according to two new studies by a
pair of Stanford cosmologists. Andrei Lindeand his wife Renata Kallosh,
both physics professors at Stanford, conducted two new studies that chal
lenge the widely accepted scenario that the galaxy will become an isolat
ed island among black space in 150 billion years.
Their studies propose that the universe could collapse in 10 to 20 bil
lion years.
"We tried our best to come up with a good theory that explains the ac
celeration of the universe, but ours is just a model," Linde said. "It's just
part of the answer."
The two companion papers raise the possibility of what they call the
cosmic "big crunch" and are available on the physics research Web site,
www.arXiv.org.
Childcare grant subsidy program expanded
Last year's pilot program to subsidize the childcare costs of Stanford
employees has been expanded to $ 1.7 million, giving eligible employees
with children under six up to $5,000 a year in tax-free reimbursements,
and up to $1,000 for children six to nine years old.
The program, which began in 2001, was believed to be the largest
childcare assistance program offered by any employer in the United
States.
With the expansion of the program, approximately 500 more em
ployees will be eligible to receive the grants.
Teresa Rasco, director of the Work Life Office, which administers the
program, said that the income ranges were adjusted to make the grants
more accessible to lower-compensated employees.
"We understand the economics of Silicon Valley and that people with
children over the age of five have financial needs, too," Rasco said.
Researchers shed light on gluten intolerance
A team led by Stanford researchers reported in the Sept. 27 issue of
Science that they have discovered thecauseand a potential treatment for
the autoimmune disease Celiac Sprue. Affecting one in 200 Americans,
the disease leads to the inability to digest gluten, which is a major protein
in wheat, rye and barley products.
Researchers included graduate student and lead author Lu Shan and
co-author and professor of medicine, emeritus Gary M. Gray. The Stan
ford researchers worked with a group from the University of Oslo in
Norway.
I hese findings are the first step to giving people with celiac disease
real hope for normal life," said Chaitan Khosla, professor of chemistry,
chemical engineering and biochemistry.
