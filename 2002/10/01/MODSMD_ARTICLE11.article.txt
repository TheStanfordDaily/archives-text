## More than 1,000 feared dead in ferry disaster 
### 
DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — With
the presumed death toll from a
ferry sinking nearing 1,000, Sene
gal's president has conceded that
overcrowding helped cause of one
of Africa's deadliest ferry disasters,
and a German newspaper report
ed the vessel held twice as many
people as it was designed for.
Television footage showed the
state-run MS Joola listing sicken
ingly to one side as it cleared port
Thursday for its final, fatal voyage.
The number of presumed
dead approached 1,000 yesterday
but could go much higher — with
ticketing authorities saying all
children under 5 would have
gone unticketed, and thus appar
ently uncounted.
"Children were found clutch
ing their mothers," said Haidar el
Ali, who led a team of divers yes
terday in a recovery effort.
The boat capsized in stormy
seas quickly and only 64 people are
known to have survived among an
official count of 1,034 passengers

and crew. Those who escaped the
overturned ferry hung onto its ex
posed Inill for hours.
Many victims were trapped be
neath the overturned ferry.
Screaming for help, gasping for
air and beating on windows, they
survived for hours, rescue divers
said yetserday — descr ibi n g scenes
of horror in air pockets that had
kept the vessel afloat.
"When I dove in, I saw bodies
everywhere," many huddled near
air pockets, said el Ali, whose 16-
diver team took about 17 hours to
arrive by boat from Dakar.
"We saw bodies floating by the
hundreds, the hundreds, the
hundreds."
About 150 military personnel,
fishermen and rescue divers from
Senegal, neighboring Gambia
and former colonial power
France were taking part in the* re
covery. Gambian and Senegalese
authorities said they had re
trieved more than 360 bodies
from inside the ferry.
