# Senator ends re-election bid
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AI») — He tangled
with the CIA, helped oust Republicans, an
gered good-government groups, sparred
with fellow Democrats. He clashed with re
formers who oppose the embargo of Cuba,
flustered consumer groups by supporting
bankruptcy reform.
But after 20 tumultuous years in Con
gress, Sen. Robert Torricelli finally met an
opponent he could not overcome: himself.
Swamped by questions about his personal
ethics and integrity, Torricelli aborted his
re-election campaign yesterday just 36 days
before Election Day.
Ever since he was "severely admonished"
by the Senate ethics committee for his rela
tionship with a former campaign contribu
tor, Torricelli has simultaneously apologized
and denied doing anything wrong. But sev
eral polls indicated that New Jersey voters
had seen and heard enough of "The Torch."
"Any politician who is a great political
spectacle is always in danger of having that
turn into scandal, rather than fame," said
Ross Baker, a political scientist at Rutgers
University.
Torricelli's most striking political skill —
raising money — contributed to his rise and,
ultimately, his fall.
As far back as 1995, when he was still a
member of the House, the FBI investigated
a financial dealTorricelli made with a major

campaign contributor, CJrover Connell.
Connell arranged and guaranteed a
$1 ()(),()()() loan that helped Torricelli hit it big
in the stock market. No charges were filed.
Alter Torricelli raised $9 million to win
his Senate seat in 19%, fellow Democrats
immediately tapped him to help lead their
campaign fund-raising effort. Meanwhile,
federal investigators opened a new inquiry
that resulted in seven people pleading
guilty to making illegal donations toTorri
celli's 199() campaign.
One of them, David Chang, alleged that
he had plied Torricelli with gifts and cash in
exchange for help in his business dealings
overseas. After a thorough probe, the inves
tigators closed the case in January with no
charges against Torricelli.
But they forwarded material to the Sen
ate ethics committee, which found that
Torricelli had improperly accepted gifts
from Chang.
Baker said the official rebuke was particu
larly damaging to Torricelli because the pub
lic already had "a sense that this was some
body who really wasn't on the up-and-up."
Fighting tejirs, Torricelli announced his
decision in a late-afternoon speech that was
at turns apologetic and defiant.
"1 am a human being, and while I have
not done the things I am accused of doing, I
certainly have made mistakes," he said.
