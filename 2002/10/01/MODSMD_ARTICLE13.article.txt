## The
						Stanford Daily Mirrielees renovations only worsen situation 
### 
Published Since 1891

When the Mirrielees staff chose
"Mirrlander," a take-off From Ben
Stiller's movie "Zoolander" as its
dorm theme, no one could have
imagined the appropriateness of their choice,
considering the space issues that Stanford's
largest upperclass dorm is facing this year.
In the movie, Stiller plays a not-so-bright
male supermodel who emphatically rejects the
design of a miniature replica of his proposed
"Derek Zoolander Center For Kids Who Can't
Read Good And Who Wanna Learn To Do
Other Stuff Good Too."
"How can we be expected to teach children
how to read if they can't even fit inside the
building?" he asks.
It seems ridiculous, but maybe the Parking
and Transportation Department staff should
have asked this basic question in their plans for
renovating Mirrielees. In its elimination of park
ing spaces and failure to offer convenient parking
options for Mirrielees residents, the department

has left many students wondering where to park.
There's no doubt that the superficial reno
vations Mirrielees underwent this past sum
mer are spectacular — the apartment com
plex looks better than ever. However, its design
lacks practicality, which should have been the
highest priority for the department.
Parking was a problem last year in Mir
rielees after two out of the dorm's three wings
were turned into triples. This year, approxi
mately 50 more upperclassmen moved into
the residence. And to make matters worse, ap
proximately 20 parking spaces were eliminat
ed. Any way you calculate it, the numbers just
don't add up. In the place of the parking spots,
bicycle racks and extra landscaping were
added. But these aesthetic touches should
have been the last addition in any renovation.
Parking space issues are even more serious
at an upperclass residence like Mirrielees,
where a larger proportion of students are
likely to have cars and where prohibiting

freshmen from having cars doesn't affect
parking volume.
What Mirrielees residents need are more
legal parking options. By dinnertime, when
most students return to their apartments for
the evening, parking is very difficult to come
by, albeit in Wilbur or Escondido Village (the
only other places where parking is legal for
these residents under our current parking
permit system). The absence of flexibility with
in Stanford's parking system basically reveals
itself as a parking-ticket trap waiting to happen
for students who return to their dorm during
peak parking hours.
Further, with the recent increase in permit
prices, it seems counterintuitive that parking
options should worsen. What is the money
being used for? Hopefully it isn't going to
wards building more bike racks. Students de
serve to have information about what their
money is being used for and when the situation
will be ameliorated. Otherwise, the increase in

price is unfair and unwarranted.
In addition, the suggestion by department
administrators that walking from distant park
ing lots is nothing more than a minor inconve
nience does not seem to coincide with the ide
als of a university which prides itself on its pris
tine safety record. Forcing students, especially
women, to walk any distance at late hours does
pose a valid safety concern.
Most importantly, however, the parking situ
ation at Mirrielees seems indicative of an un
derlying larger issue facing students and ad
ministration — the lack of student input allowed
within the decision-making infrastructure. The
very idea that the Parking and Transportation
Department thinks that bicycle parking is a larg
er problem facing students than car parking
hints at how out of touch it is with everyday stu
dent needs. Administrators shouldn't be guess
ing about what would aid students. There
should be a permanent student voice when de
cisions of this nature are being made.
