Alumni begs students not to base success
solely on monetary gain
Reading The Daily and walking the
campus whenever 1 happen to be within
1,000 miles of California, I am struck at
how extraordinarily affluent the Universi
ty community is.
1 work with destitute children around
the world and spent much of last year (be
fore Sept. 11) helping kids living rough in
the streets of Kabul.
I regularly search for Stanford grads
in the ranks of non-government orga
nizations such as Doctors Without Bor
ders and Oxfam, but there aren't many

to be found.
The reason, I believe, is obvious: Stan
ford alumni judge their success by (he
money and possessions they accumulate.
There is no money working with people
living on the margins of society.
I challenge current Stanford students
to make their world big — to seek careers
other than banking, law or finance. The
kids I work with need your energy and
your idealism — the very things you wrote
about in your essays for admission to Stan
ford. Remember?
