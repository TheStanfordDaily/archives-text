Get Out the Vote (GOTV)
The ASSU is excited to kick off its GOTV campaign for the 2002 elec
tions. Many students on California campuses believe that candidates
running for office often ignore student issues such as adequate and af
fordable student housing and grants for higher education. In order to
raise voter participation rates on campus, the ASSU's campaign relies
on a threefold strategy: registering 4,000 Stanford students, educating
students on issues important to students, and getting students out to the
polls on Nov. 5.
To this end, the ASSU will be working with campus political organiza
tions, community centers and the University to bring elected officials
like California Assembly member Joe Simitian and Congresswoman
Anna Eshoo to speak at campus. Voting is the easiest way to let elected
officials on all levels of government — local, statewide, and federal —
YOUR opinions.
Graduate Student Council Highlights
(,S(; meetings are open to all grad students who wish to participate and
contribute to fostering a vibrant graduate community — we meet at 0
p.m. every Wednesday at the Bechtel International Center. We work to
improve the quality of life of graduate students through advocacy of im

like to have fun and plan campus wide events every quarter. On the
