# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## United States finds itself alone in the fight against Saddam 
### 
Old habits die hard. The West Euro
pean democracies have a history of tossing
the weak off the speeding sled in hopes of
appeasing the wolves. Czechoslovakia was
tossed off the Anglo-French sled in 1938 to
satisfy a ravening Hitler. When the Soviet
satellites rose in rebellion in 1953, 1956
and 1968 against the Kremlin tyrants, the
bordering West European democracies
did nothing.
Their behavior then, as now, is reminis
cent of [former British Prime Minister]
Benjamin Disraeli's judgment of English
statesman Sir Robert Peel: "His judgment
was faultless provided he had not to deal
with the future."
That the Soviet Union finally fell has lit
tle to do with Western Europe and every
thingtodowith President Ronald Reagan.

Had it been up to conti
nental Europe in the
1980s, there would still be
a Bolshevik Russia.
lhe United States is
now the victim that the
European Union would
like to toss off the sled.
Fortunately, we are not
in the E.U. sled, nor, de
spite the pressing invita-

tions, do we intend to get on.
l he E.U. is building up the United
States as the rogue elephant superpower
whom it is trying to cage. What an amne
siac E.U. forgets is that it is not the Unit
ed States alone that is the Islamist target
but Western civilization itself.
Czechoslovakia was to be Hitler's last

target; he even signed a piece of paper to
that effect. Neville Chamberlain (from
England) and Edouard Daladier (from
France) scoffed at the notion that Hitler's
real target was the West European democ
racies. And today? I'm not sure whom the
E.U. regards as the greater threat to world
peace: America or Saddam 1 lussein?
Perhaps French president Jacques
(Chirac really believes that the terrorist wing
among the Islamist migrants who live in
high-rise slums outside of Paris are dream
ing of the day when they am become part
of the French haute bourgeoisie.
A recent episode demonstrates the
E.U. finger-in-the-eye attitude to' ard
America. Last year The New York Times
reported on May 4 what, in effect, was a
victory for Europe over the United

States: "In a move that reflected a grow
ing frustration with America's attitude
toward international organizations and
treaties, the United States was voted oil
the United Nations Commission on
Human Rights today for the first time
since the panel's founding under Ameri
can leadership in 1947 [. . .] The unex
pected move, which came in a secret
vote, was apparently supported even by
some friends of the United States [. . .\
Friends of the United States in Europe
and elsewhere have grown increasingly
impatient, disappointed and annoyed
with actions by Washington."
So to get even with the United States,
they elected these undeviating violators of
human rights: China, Cuba, Syria, Libya,
and, unbelievably, slaveholding Sudan.

And even more unbelievable, the Com
mission has just elected Libya as its chair!
Western Europe has made its choice:
keep Saddam Hussein in power. Presi
dent Bush says no.
We are virtually alone in our deter
mination to go to war against the Iraqi
dictatorship. So was Britain in 1940
when Winston Churchill took over the
reins of a tottering nation. The differ
ence today is that the United States is
not tottering.
