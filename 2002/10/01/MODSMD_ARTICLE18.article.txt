# Prof wants research online

Brown wants scientific research to
be available to everyone, regardless
of their careers, subscriptions to
journals or aptitude for science.
Brown and some colleagues are
behind an initiative to publish re
search reports and scholarly articles
online, making them accessible to
the entire population â€” including
the students and average citizens
whose tax money funds over $50
million worth of scientific research
annually.
"The fact that this information is
currently the private property of
publishers makes this impossible,"
Brown said.
He added, "An important point
is that, our initiative is not about on
line versus print publication; it's
about putting the published record
of scientific research in the public
domain."
Scientists contribute their re
ports to journals run by both for
profit and nonprofit organizations,
which charge subscription fees that
can cost up to thousands of dollars a
year. This practice makes it unlikely
112 hat anyone not working directly in
a certain field would get access to
these materials, let alone at a rea
sonable cost.
A few years ago, Brown asked the
scientific community to publish only
in venues that made data available
to the public within six months of
publication. Although tens of thou
sands of scientists agreed, reluc
tance prevailed, because there were
so few such journals, and scientists
feared possible risk to their careers.
Brown and company envisioned
launching an alternative non-profit
organization to publish scientific pa

pers without assuming ownership of
published material. Although there
is little opposition from scientific and
medical colleagues to Brown's pro
posal, the established publishing sys
tems remain dominant.
Brown is now working on a new
project, but he is waiting to elabo
rate on its details.
"We are in the final stages of rais
ing money for this start-up and ex
pect to be in business very shortly,"
Brown said.
Under the traditional journal
system, subscribers would pay pub
lishers a hefty sum for access to the
latest research results, which were
provided to the magazines by re
searchers for free.
The online approach would
allow for easier access to the whole
of published scientific and medical
information, consolidating it into an
accessible online archive. In addi
tion, peer review of research, an im
portant component of published
journals, would be available in
greater detail in the online format.
Paul Berg, School of Medicine
Prof. Emeritus, agreed that getting
"scientific information as widely
disseminated as possible" is a laud
able effort.
"There are many places where
[people] can't afford the journals,"
Berg explained, such as third world
countries, where the internet would
make research results accessible.
An effort on the part of publish
ers to accommodate this would be
to publish privately and then allow
the information to be distributed
online after six months. This would
establish the "economic base" of
the publishers who pay for print
ing, Berg said, thus maintaining
their industry but also making the
internet an "archival source."
