## Volleyball nets wins in Oregon 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Whatever strange losing disorder that struck Stan
ford athletic teams this weekend must have been
some kind of Y-chromosome thing.
The Cardinal women athletes didn't seem fazed by
the men's squads' woes. Hie women's volleyball team
seemed especially unhampered, as it crushed Oregon
and Oregon State on its first Pacific-10 Conference
road trip of the season over the weekend.

Women's Volleyball
Friday: No. 4 Stanford def. Oregon St. 30-23, 30-20, 30-19
Saturday: Stanford def. Oregon 30-17, 30-9, 30-21

No. 4 Stanford (12-1, 3-0 Pac-10) needed only 80
minutes on Friday and Saturday nights to sweep each
of the Oregon schools, gearing the Cardinal up for
this Friday's showdown at Maples Pavilion with top
ranked Southern California.
"It was a good confidence booster," said freshman
setter Katie Coldhahn, who saw her first Pac-10 ac
tion. "We really went into the weekend looking ahead
for tlie USC game, so we wanted to work on our side
of the court. We were having fun playing [the Oregon
schools]. We wanted to stay intense, but winning like
that was a good feeling."
Sophomore outside hitter Ogonna Nnamani

slammed down a match-high 14 kills as Stanford
bowled over the Beavers (0-4, 5-7) on Friday, 30-23,
30-20 and 30-19. Junior middle blocker Sara McGee,
who boasts the Pac-10's highest'hitting percentage,
snapped a recent cold streak with 12 kills while hitting
at a match-high .556 clip, as Stanford outhit Oregon
State .404 to .125.
I he match wasn't a blowout end to end, as the Car
dinal stumbled out of the gate, with a flurry of service
errors giving the Beavers a 15-10 advantage in the
first game.
But tlie Stanford servers hit their spots the rest of
the way, and McGee, who also leads the conference in
blocking with 1.52 blocks per game, ignited the Car
dinal's defense at the net, leading Stanford on a 20-8
run to take the first game.
Coldhahn got the call at setter in the second game
in place of starting junior Anna Robinson, and she
made the most of the opportunity. Coldhahn drove
the Cardinal to a .433 hitting percentage in the sec
ond frame, and four more blocks out of McCee
helped hold the Beavers to a .059 hitting clip in a
quick 30-23 win.
"()ne of our goals on this trip was to get Katie some
playing time," said coach John Dunning. "She's good,
and she's been working hard, and we wanted to see
what she could do with more playing time. We have

No. 13 UCLA this weekend at Maples Pavilion.
good hitters, but it takes a setter
too. She did a good job."
Goldhahn showed oil her serve
in the third game as Stanford
scored six straight with her at the
line to blow open a 15-10 lead. The
Beavers could only score on their
serve once more the rest ol t lie way
in the 30-19 (lardinal win to seal
the match.
Senior outside hitter Logan
lom chipped in another 12
kills for the Cardinal, two more
than Oregon State's leading at
tacker, senior outside hitter
Katrina Nelson.
The loss was the Beavers' sixth
straight, though the streak was
extended to seven one night
later with Oregon State's narrow
3-2 loss to California.
Fifty miles north in Eugene,
the Cardinal showed that it
hadn't lost an ounce of energy as
it embarrassed Oregon (0-4, 9-8)
at McArthur Court, 30-17, 30-9,
30-21. on Saturday.
File Ducks only scored 10 points
on their serve the whole night —
with none, coming in the second
game — as Stanford crushed Ore
gon in every statistical category,
most notably in hitting percentage,
with the Cardinal's .434 c lip sham
ing the Ducks' -.020 mark.
Just one night after almost beat
ing Cal in a tight five-game match,
Oregon led only once against the
Cardinal, taking an early 3-1 lead
in the first game.
But the Sara McGee show
kicked into high gear, as she
pic ked up four kills, two aces and a
block in driving Stanford to a 30-
17 opening-game win.
McGee finished the night with a
match-high 10 kills on just 1 1 sets
with no errors for an incredible

.909 hitting percentage.
"I have a great group around
me, and they draw the block
away," McGee said. "Playing with
Ogonna, Logan and [senior oppo
site] Ashley |lvy| around me is
pretty awesome. For the first time,
we kept going and didn't let down
against Oregon. I lopefully we can
not he a rollercoaster and be the
same way this weekend."
1 lie 30-9 second-game result
was the most lopsided win Stan
ford has posted since rally scoring
was instituted last year. (Under the
old sideout-scoring system, Stan
ford would've won 15-0.)
I lie Ducks did most of the
work, running up I 1 hitting errors
and missing the court on three of
its their 10 serves in the game.
"Going on the road in the Pac
-10, I'm more nervous than any
other time because it's so danger
ous," Dunning said. "[The DucksJ
were under pressure because they
had lost several in a row, and we
were getting better. They saw how
we played early on in the match,
and I think it scared them into
playing worse."
The third game— and the
match — was over barely after it
started, with the (lardinal taking a
quick 9-1 lead. Ogonna Nna
mani's eighth kill of the game
ended the madness at 30-21 in the
final game.
Stanford outblocked the Ducks
13-4, outdug them 40-26 and ran
oil 10 aces to ()rcgon's three.
The celebration was c ut short,
however, as the team returned to
the gym on Sunday to prepare for
its toughest match of the season so
far against the top-ranked Trojans
on Friday.
"As soon as those games were
over, we were looking straight
ahead to USC," Goldhalm said.
"We knew this week of practice
was really key, and we all wanted
to go all out."
