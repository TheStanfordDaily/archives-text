## Volleyball nets wins in Oregon 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Whatever strange losing disorder that struck Stan
ford athletic teams this weekend must have been
some kind of Y-chromosome thing.
The Cardinal women athletes didn't seem fazed by
the men's squads' woes. Hie women's volleyball team
seemed especially unhampered, as it crushed Oregon
and Oregon State on its first Pacific-10 Conference
road trip of the season over the weekend.

Friday: No. 4 Stanford def. Oregon St. 30-23, 30-20, 30-19
Saturday: Stanford def. Oregon 30-17, 30-9, 30-21

No. 4 Stanford (12-1, 3-0 Pac-10) needed only 80
minutes on Friday and Saturday nights to sweep each
of the Oregon schools, gearing the Cardinal up for
this Friday's showdown at Maples Pavilion with top
ranked Southern California.
"It was a good confidence booster," said freshman
setter Katie Coldhahn, who saw her first Pac-10 ac
tion. "We really went into the weekend looking ahead
for tlie USC game, so we wanted to work on our side
of the court. We were having fun playing [the Oregon
schools]. We wanted to stay intense, but winning like
that was a good feeling."
Sophomore outside hitter Ogonna Nnamani

slammed down a match-high 14 kills as Stanford
bowled over the Beavers (0-4, 5-7) on Friday, 30-23,
30-20 and 30-19. Junior middle blocker Sara McGee,
who boasts the Pac-10's highest'hitting percentage,
snapped a recent cold streak with 12 kills while hitting
at a match-high .556 clip, as Stanford outhit Oregon
State .404 to .125.
I he match wasn't a blowout end to end, as the Car
dinal stumbled out of the gate, with a flurry of service
errors giving the Beavers a 15-10 advantage in the
first game.
But tlie Stanford servers hit their spots the rest of
the way, and McGee, who also leads the conference in
blocking with 1.52 blocks per game, ignited the Car
dinal's defense at the net, leading Stanford on a 20-8
run to take the first game.
Coldhahn got the call at setter in the second game
in place of starting junior Anna Robinson, and she
made the most of the opportunity. Coldhahn drove
the Cardinal to a .433 hitting percentage in the sec
ond frame, and four more blocks out of McCee
helped hold the Beavers to a .059 hitting clip in a
quick 30-23 win.
"()ne of our goals on this trip was to get Katie some
playing time," said coach John Dunning. "She's good,
and she's been working hard, and we wanted to see
what she could do with more playing time. We have
