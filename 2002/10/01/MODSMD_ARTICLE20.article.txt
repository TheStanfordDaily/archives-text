### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
After Saturday's surprising 65-24
loss to Arizona State, the Stanford foot
ball team (1-2, 0-1 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) has a lot of questions to answer
between now and this Saturday, when
it takes on No. 9 Notre Dame (4-0).
The most important issue head
coach Buddy Teevens and his staff
must address is a defensive secondary
that was torched for 421 passing yards.
They must also address the inadequa
cy of the pass rush and the defensive
playcalling, both of which let the de
fensive backs get burned continuously
on one-on-one situations throughout

the course of the game. Like a broken
record, Sun Devils' quarterback An
drew Walter placed deep ball after
deep ball into his streaking receivers'
outstretched arms.
Teevens must also address the
quarterback position. After the loss,
when asked who would start this week
end, he said: "Right now, we'll just go
back and take a look. We'll find out
over the course of the week who the
guy is that's executing to give us the
greatest opportunity.
"Chris [Lewis] didn't do anything to
lose a job, and Kyle | Matter] didn't do
anything to win a job."
Fortunately, Stanford will probably
have a couple more healthy players by

this weekend. Senior running back
Kerry Carter and junior wide receiver
Luke Powell, both key components of
the offense, had hoped to play this
weekend but couldn't make it back.
Powell is recovering from an ankle in
jury; Carter from a banged-up knee.
After any unexpected loss, morale is
going to be a concern as well. Immedi
ately after the game, the Cardinal
seemed dazed, but resolved.
"We're going to come out next week
and fix the things we didn't do well,"
senior safety Colin Branch said.

Leonard added: "We're taking this as a

After Stanford threw four in
terceptions and lost a fumble in
the San Jose State game on Sept.
21, Teevens had mentioned that
the team's focus for the Arizona
State game would be "good ball
decisions." Troublingly, the Car
dinal lost three fumbles and
threw four interceptions against

the Sun Devils.

football," Teevens said. "It was a
day where we were trying to force

It does not help matters that
what is likely to be the Cardinal's
worst loss of the year directly pre
cedes its biggest game of the year:
a trip to South Bend, Ind., to face
former Stanford coach Tyrone
Willingham and his very surpris
ing Irish team.
" That's a big game, not even
dealing with the coach Willingham
thing," senior guard Paul Weinacht
said. "Anytime you play a top-ten
team at their place, it's going to be a
tough game."

The Cardinal will also have to
alter its preparation, since Noire
Dame is a team unlike most Pac-10
opponents. Fortunately for the
Cardinal, Notre Dame is not
"Rl?osn for its speed", wfiicft sfiould
help a Cardinal secondary that
couldn't keep pace with lightning
last Sun Devil Shaun McDonald.
Furthermore, Irish quarter
backs Carlyle Holiday and Pat
Dillingham don't have the kind of
gun that Walter has, which also fig
ures to help the Cardinal keep the
Notre Dame offense in hand.
What Stanford will have to
prepare for, though, is a big,
strong football team known for its
commitment to the running
game and its shutdown defense.

No team has scored more than 23
points on the Irish in its four
games, and the Cardinal has al
lowed at least 20 points in all
three of its contests.
Interestingly, the weather in'
Tempe, Ariz., expected to be a big
factor for both teams last weekend,
was quite nice.
ABC television paid each team
$250,000 to move the 3:30 p.m.
kickoff to 12:30 p.m., something
almost never done in Sun Devil
Stadium because of the heat. Yet,
after the first quarter, the sun
spent most of the day obscured by
the clouds, and by the end of the
game, the weather on the field
was cool and breezy.
"It was not a factor," Teevens said.

After Stanford threw four in

21, Teevens had mentioned that
the team's focus for the Arizona
State game would be "good ball

dinal lost three fumbles and
threw four interceptions against

the Sun Devils.

It does not help matters that
what is likely to be the Cardinal's
worst loss of the year directly pre
cedes its biggest game of the year:
a trip to South Bend, Ind., to face
former Stanford coach Tyrone
Willingham and his very surpris
ing Irish team.
" That's a big game, not even
dealing with the coach Willingham
thing," senior guard Paul Weinacht
said. "Anytime you play a top-ten
team at their place, it's going to be a
tough game."

The Cardinal will also have to
alter its preparation, since Noire
Dame is a team unlike most Pac-10
opponents. Fortunately for the
Cardinal, Notre Dame is not
"Rl?osn for its speed", wfiicft sfiould
help a Cardinal secondary that
couldn't keep pace with lightning
last Sun Devil Shaun McDonald.
Furthermore, Irish quarter
backs Carlyle Holiday and Pat
Dillingham don't have the kind of
gun that Walter has, which also fig
ures to help the Cardinal keep the
Notre Dame offense in hand.
What Stanford will have to
prepare for, though, is a big,
strong football team known for its
commitment to the running
game and its shutdown defense.

No team has scored more than 23
points on the Irish in its four
games, and the Cardinal has al
lowed at least 20 points in all
three of its contests.
Interestingly, the weather in'
Tempe, Ariz., expected to be a big
factor for both teams last weekend,
was quite nice.
ABC television paid each team
$250,000 to move the 3:30 p.m.
kickoff to 12:30 p.m., something
almost never done in Sun Devil
Stadium because of the heat. Yet,
after the first quarter, the sun
spent most of the day obscured by
the clouds, and by the end of the
game, the weather on the field
was cool and breezy.
"It was not a factor," Teevens said.
After Saturday's surprising 65-24
loss to Arizona State, the Stanford foot
ball team (1-2, 0-1 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) has a lot of questions to answer
between now and this Saturday, when
it takes on No. 9 Notre Dame (4-0).
The most important issue head
coach Buddy Teevens and his staff
must address is a defensive secondary
that was torched for 421 passing yards.
They must also address the inadequa
cy of the pass rush and the defensive
playcalling, both of which let the de
fensive backs get burned continuously
on one-on-one situations throughout

the course of the game. Like a broken
record, Sun Devils' quarterback An
drew Walter placed deep ball after
deep ball into his streaking receivers'
outstretched arms.
Teevens must also address the
quarterback position. After the loss,
when asked who would start this week
end, he said: "Right now, we'll just go
back and take a look. We'll find out
over the course of the week who the
guy is that's executing to give us the
greatest opportunity.
"Chris [Lewis] didn't do anything to
lose a job, and Kyle | Matter] didn't do
anything to win a job."
Fortunately, Stanford will probably
have a couple more healthy players by

this weekend. Senior running back
Kerry Carter and junior wide receiver
Luke Powell, both key components of
the offense, had hoped to play this
weekend but couldn't make it back.
Powell is recovering from an ankle in
jury; Carter from a banged-up knee.
