After Saturday's surprising 65-24
loss to Arizona State, the Stanford foot
ball team (1-2, 0-1 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) has a lot of questions to answer
between now and this Saturday, when
it takes on No. 9 Notre Dame (4-0).
The most important issue head
coach Buddy Teevens and his staff
must address is a defensive secondary
that was torched for 421 passing yards.
They must also address the inadequa
cy of the pass rush and the defensive
playcalling, both of which let the de
fensive backs get burned continuously
on one-on-one situations throughout

the course of the game. Like a broken
record, Sun Devils' quarterback An
drew Walter placed deep ball after
deep ball into his streaking receivers'
outstretched arms.
Teevens must also address the
quarterback position. After the loss,
when asked who would start this week
end, he said: "Right now, we'll just go
back and take a look. We'll find out
over the course of the week who the
guy is that's executing to give us the
greatest opportunity.
"Chris [Lewis] didn't do anything to
lose a job, and Kyle | Matter] didn't do
anything to win a job."
Fortunately, Stanford will probably
have a couple more healthy players by

this weekend. Senior running back
Kerry Carter and junior wide receiver
Luke Powell, both key components of
the offense, had hoped to play this
weekend but couldn't make it back.
Powell is recovering from an ankle in
jury; Carter from a banged-up knee.
After any unexpected loss, morale is
going to be a concern as well. Immedi
ately after the game, the Cardinal
seemed dazed, but resolved.
"We're going to come out next week
and fix the things we didn't do well,"
senior safety Colin Branch said.
Senior defensive tackle Matt
Leonard added: "We're taking this as a

Senior receiver Ryan Wells and the Stanford football team will look to rebound from its embarrassing 65-24 loss to Arizona State
this weekend in South Bend, Ind. The Cardinal will face former coach Tyrone Willingham when it takes on No. 9 Notre Dame.
