# It's a love-hate relationship for this guy
## 
### 
It's all about love and hate. Play
oil baseball, catering to us boys
that never grew up. It forces us
to pick and choose our favorites,
our heroes, not on the quality of their
character, but on how they pick up the
seams on a Barry Zito curve looking
them right in the eye. That, and
whether we have their Topps 1990
No. 1 prospect rookie card.
As I said, it's all about love and hate.
I hate the Yankees. I hate Derek Jeter.
1 love Noinali, crooked nose and all. I
love Raja Clemens in Boston, not
Roger Clemens in New York. I hate Gi
ambi for leaving Oakland. I love Knob
by for leaving New York. I love last
draft-pick-as-a-favor-pick-up Mike Pi
azza. I love David Wells, but only with
his shirt untucked â€” and with a good
dentist. I love Tony Gwynn. I love Jon
Olerud. 1 love Ichiro. I love players
who hit for average.

That said, I MATT
BARRY BONDS. 1 hate
Sammy. I hate Junior. I
hate Big Mac. I hate
home-run trots and bat
Hips, steroids and free
trips. I hate showing off,
but I still love 1 larlem in
the Little League World
Series.

I love Sports Center, sportSCenter
and Sports Center. I love (lie catch phras
es "800-ya," "He hit the ball real hard,"
and "not-in-this-game-that-would-be-a
record." I love Stuart Scott, Dan Patrick,
Keith-O, Craig Kilborn, Scott Van Pelt,
Rich Kisen, John Anderson and Chris
Berman. I love that I can name more
Sports Center anchors than Stanford
football players.
And I'm sorry, but I hate Linda
Colin. She tries so hard, and she just
isn't funny.

I love the movies. 1 love "Major
League." I love " The Bad News Bears,"
"Little Big League" and "Eight Men
Out." I love "People will come, Ray,"
Shoeless Joe Jackson, and "Is this heav
en?. .. No, It's lowa." I hate "Rookie of
the Year."
I love the starting infield oft he 1990
San Francisco Giants (Will Clark,
Robby Thompson, Jose Uuuuribe,
Matt Williams and Terry Kennedy). I
only love Kent and Aurilia now. I love
Kevin Mitchell's bare-handed catch
and Candy Maldonado, but just be
cause of his name. 1 love Candlestick
Park. 1 hate Pac-Bell.
I love Torii Hunter (what's with the
two "i"'s?), sno-cones, and Twin Gems. I
hate Andruw Jones (what's with the
"u"?), lazy-ass catches and Bobby Cox. I
hate Eric Gagne, the Indians logo and


Spencer Porter
