# It's a love-hate relationship for this guy
## 
### 
It's all about love and hate. Play
oil baseball, catering to us boys
that never grew up. It forces us
to pick and choose our favorites,
our heroes, not on the quality of their
character, but on how they pick up the
seams on a Barry Zito curve looking
them right in the eye. That, and
whether we have their Topps 1990
No. 1 prospect rookie card.
As I said, it's all about love and hate.
I hate the Yankees. I hate Derek Jeter.
1 love Noinali, crooked nose and all. I
love Raja Clemens in Boston, not
Roger Clemens in New York. I hate Gi
ambi for leaving Oakland. I love Knob
by for leaving New York. I love last
draft-pick-as-a-favor-pick-up Mike Pi
azza. I love David Wells, but only with
his shirt untucked — and with a good
dentist. I love Tony Gwynn. I love Jon
Olerud. 1 love Ichiro. I love players
who hit for average.

That said, I MATT
BARRY BONDS. 1 hate
Sammy. I hate Junior. I
hate Big Mac. I hate
home-run trots and bat
Hips, steroids and free
trips. I hate showing off,
but I still love 1 larlem in
the Little League World
Series.

I love Sports Center, sportSCenter
and Sports Center. I love (lie catch phras
es "800-ya," "He hit the ball real hard,"
and "not-in-this-game-that-would-be-a
record." I love Stuart Scott, Dan Patrick,
Keith-O, Craig Kilborn, Scott Van Pelt,
Rich Kisen, John Anderson and Chris
Berman. I love that I can name more
Sports Center anchors than Stanford
football players.
And I'm sorry, but I hate Linda
Colin. She tries so hard, and she just
isn't funny.

I love the movies. 1 love "Major
League." I love " The Bad News Bears,"
"Little Big League" and "Eight Men
Out." I love "People will come, Ray,"
Shoeless Joe Jackson, and "Is this heav
en?. .. No, It's lowa." I hate "Rookie of
the Year."
I love the starting infield oft he 1990
San Francisco Giants (Will Clark,
Robby Thompson, Jose Uuuuribe,
Matt Williams and Terry Kennedy). I
only love Kent and Aurilia now. I love
Kevin Mitchell's bare-handed catch
and Candy Maldonado, but just be
cause of his name. 1 love Candlestick
Park. 1 hate Pac-Bell.
I love Torii Hunter (what's with the
two "i"'s?), sno-cones, and Twin Gems. I
hate Andruw Jones (what's with the
"u"?), lazy-ass catches and Bobby Cox. I
hate Eric Gagne, the Indians logo and


Spencer Porter
pretty much everybody in a Chica
go uniform. I just feel sorry for any
one in a Devil Rays uniform.
I love the 6-4-3 double play, the
backhanded toss to short and the
strike 'em out, throw 'em out. I love
defensive specialists, knuckle
bailers and outfield assists.
I love the payolf pitch, strike
threes in the dirt, climbing the lad
der to the rising fastball and the
good of fashioned country hard
ball. 1 hate throwing at a hitter —
especially when it's Pedro doing
the throwing.
And finally, 1 love my magic

glove. Just as Allie's glove was
vital to Holden Caulfield, my
glove is vital to me. You don't
know me unless you know it, the
same glove I had when I was
seven, merely a tot in farm
league. It's a light brown Mizuno
with a windowsill webbing and a
lake fur lining.
I loved playing in Little League,
scooping the ball out of the dirt
and rifling it to first for the out. I
loved the Ross Valley Twins, Ath
letics and Expos, and I love that I
can remember shaking up a can of
Mug Root Beer after the Expos
first playoff win, popping the top,
throwing it into right field and
watching it spray and sputter in
the ontlield grass.
Some moments just stay with

you. Although 1 can't remember a
single thing my coaches told me
when 1 was 11,1 can still remember
the smell of dust on my glove at
Bacich Middle School, standingjust
a shade left of second base after
fielding a grounder, stepping on
second and throwing out the batter
at first.
I mean, I hate that I can't have
that anymore, but when you re
member a detail that sublime, you
stop hating the players.
And you love the game.

Spencer Porter, a sophomore, hopes
that all baseball fans and players —
even Stanford's bat-flipping senior
catcher Ryan Garko — will enjoy the
playoffs and root for the Giants the
whole ivay.
