# Soccer takes top ranking after wins over weekend
## 
### MATT BABIN STAFF WRITER 
Going into this weekend's Santa Clara
adidas Classic, there was some concern that
the Cardinal women's soccer team might be
looking past its immediate games to next
weekend's matchup against previously top
ranked North Carolina.

Women's Soccer
Santa Clara adidas Classic
Friday: No. 1 Stanford 2, Tennessee 0
Sunday: Stanford 8, Montana 1

Unfortunately for Tennessee and Mon
tana, that wasn't the case.
The Cardinal's focus was right where it
needed to be as Stanford took care of busi
ness, defeating Tennessee 2-0 Friday night
and exploding for an 8-1 victory over Mon
tana Sunday morning.
And unfortunately for North Carolina,
the combination of the Cardinal's undefeat
ed weekend and North Carolina's tie with
Portland took the top ranking from the Tar
Heels and brought it out west to the newly
top-ranked Stanford squad.
It is the program's highest-ever national
ranking in its history.
Friday's match was a good test for the
team, as the stingy Tady Vols' defense held
the Cardinal scoreless through the first 45
minutes of play. Sophomore midfielder Lisa
Engel found the back of the net in the 66th
minute to break the scoreless tie.
Engel's first goal of the year ended up
being the game winner, as the Cardinal de
fense held strong in the face of"Tennessee's
counterattacks.
Junior defender Alisan Pabon showed
once again why she deserved her spot on
last week's Soccer America Team of the
Week when she stopped a Tennessee at
tacker on a dangerous one-on-one attack in
the 70th minute.
Pabon also played a role in Stanford's in

surance goal 10 minutes later, as her long
feed to senior forward Marcia Wallis was
then dished to sophomore forward Natalie
Sanderson, who beat the Vol's goalkeeper to
put the Cardinal up by two.
1 lowever, there was one downside in the
victory. Late in the game, senior midfielder
Kelsey Carlson was injured after a tackle by a
Tennessee player.
The injury was serious enough to keep
Carlson from Sunday's starting lineup â€”
something that hadn't happened since the
first game of her freshman year, breaking a
streak of 70 collegiate games.
"Kelsey has a badly sprained ankle. It'll
probably take a couple of weeks," co-coach
Paul Sapsford said after Sunday's game.
After the hard fought win Friday night,
Stanford wasted no time attaining an
early lead Sunday morning. A mere three
minutes into the contest, freshman for
ward Jennifer Farenbaugh took the ball
from a defender and fed it to junior for
ward Brittany Oliveira, who placed it past
the keeper.
Just five minutes later, the Cardinal
scored again. Oliveira sent Farenbaugh
past the defensive line with a pass into
open space. Farenbaugh then launched a
cross for Wallis in front of the net. While
Wallis;s first attempt was stopped by Mon
tana's goalkeeper, the rebound came right
to senior midfielder Becky Myers, who
found the back of an open net for her first
goal of the season.
Montana didn't go away quickly. It con
stantly fought for loose balls at midfield. Its
resilency paid off when it was able to convert
a Stanford foul in the 11th minute into a goal
on a set play.
Montana's Wendy Stuker took the
free kick from the left side of the box,
lofting a high ball that teammate Zajonc
McKenzie headed in for the goal. It was
the first goal scored against the Cardinal
