### ANDREA COX EDITORIAL STAFF

beach after getting caught in a
nasty riptide against the Pepper
dine Waves.

Stanford 7

not seem to cross any of the Stan
ford faithful's minds.
The Cardinal men (8-1, 1-1
Ml'SF) fought hard in the last
quarter by putting up three
goals, but it was too little too late.
Pepperdine was already out of
reach, holding on for the three

for the Cardinal.

quarter to cement the victory.
