# Spartans hope to stay in Division I

### MELINDA LATHAM THE SPARTAN DAILY 
(U-WIRE) SAN JOSE — The
fight against Texas-El Paso last
Saturday wasn't the only battle at
Spartan Stadium. The other op
ponent: low attendance.
With an official turnout of
10,416 at Spartan Stadium on
Saturday, the school did slightly
better than its 8,506 home game
attendance average of last year.
Hut with a new NCAA require
ment that demands an average
attendance of 15,000 for Division
I-A teams by the 2004 season, it's
a long way to victory.
San Jose State University
president Robert Caret outlined
the challenge.
"We're facing a unit (lie set of'hur
dles that someone placed in front of
us," Caret said. "We just have to
muster the energy to face them."
Last week, the SJSU depart
ment revealed the 2002-2005
Master Plan, devised by Athletics
Director Chuck Bell.
There are two main goals to
the plan: To maintain NCAA Di
vision I-A status by raising atten
dance and to increase athletic
funding by $2.2 million by the
2005-2006 school year.
If the school does not meet
the requirements, the football
team will go to Division I-AA.,
which has no minimum atten
dance requirement.
This poses bigger problems
than ego bruising.
Bell said this could affect all
sports.
"If we are not 1-A status in
football, then we cannot be in the
Western Athletic Conference,"
Bell said.
The WAC, a conference that in
cludes Rice University and the
University of Hawaii, requires a
Division I-A football team. If the
football team does not make Divi
sion I-A, then all Spartan sports
teams in the WAC will be kicked
out of the conference.
Currently, five men's and
eight women's sports are in the
WAC, Bell said.
"Without being in a confer
ence, you can't fill your sched
ule," Bell said. "You have no one
to play. If could totally destroy all
of our sports."
Other regional conferences
exist, but there is no guarantee
that they will accept SJSU if it is

ejected from WAC, Bell said.
"We have to be ready for the
fact that if we don't make Divi
sion 1 (I-A) status in 2004, we
could be out of athletics com
pletely," he said.
Caret said a school without
football is not something he
wants to see.
"I don't want to look 20 years
down the road and see Fresno
(State University) being com
pared to Stanford and Cal," Caret
said. "They're playing them, and
who am I playing? Nobody."
The main hurdle to overcome
in keeping Division I-A status is
attendance.
SJSU football has one of the
smallest fan bases of any Division
I team in the nation, according to
the plan.
Wit h last year's average at 8,506
per game, attendance would need
to nearly double in two years to
meet the requirements.
John Ralston, football coach at
SJSU from 1993-1996 and cur
rent assistant to the athletic di
rector, said he was disappointed
in the dwindling attendance rate,
considering that SJSU currently
has approximately 28,000 stu
dents and 100,000 alumni.
"We just don't feel we're get
ting the support," Ralston said.
"Over the years, you recognize
students have outside interests."
Bell said that lack of student
interest in campus events can be
attributed to the commuter na
ture of the school.
"Students don't participate on
this campus," Bell said. "They
come to class and go home."
He said the athletic program is
building events around the game
to bring otherwise uninterested
students to the stadium. With
events such as Saturday's "Futbol
Americano" fiesta, the organizers
wanted to make football just one
part of an all-day event.
"There has to be an event that
will draw people to the stadium,"
Bell said. "They want to come to
the event, and by the way, there's
football."
The Mercury News reported
that the fiesta had about 50 peo
ple in attendance. About 2,000
people were expected.
Other methods to draw atten
dance include giveaways. At each
home game, students can enter a
drawing to win a semester's tu
ition. At the Fresno State game

on Nov. 23, attendees can win a
motorcycle, Bell said.
Bell said that there will be a
fireworks show, concerts and
bands at some of the games.
In addition to promotional
events on game day, the athletics
department is also working to in
crease on-campus awareness of
games in all sports.
Kiosks and lighted marquees
are some ideas, Bell said.
Students also had some ideas
on how to let people know about
football games.
Laleighta Hin d, a senior busi
ness finance major, said the
school needed to get more on
campus residents involved.
"They should advertise more
in the residence halls," Hurd
said. "A lot of residents don't
come to the games."
Not only does the plan call for
increased student attendance, it
also aims for more involvement
from alumni and the community
at large.
Lawrence Fan, sports informa
tion officer for SJSU, described
how the athletic department is at
tempting to create more of a
media presence to let people
know about Spartan athletics.
"It's important to identify
what the good stories are," Fan
said. "It's about interacting be
tween students, athletes and
coaches."
Fan also emphasized the im
portance of football. Saturday's
game was televised, and a Saturn
blimp Hew over the stadium.
"College football generates
more publicity than any of the
other sports," Fan said.
The department has also hired
a professional firm, Hometown
Sports, to market the games.
According to the plan, the fis
cal year 2001-2002 intercolle
giate athletics budget was $1 1.6
million, in the bottom third of
WAC schools. The football bud
get is approximately $2.8 million
per year. Division I-A programs
typically spend up to $9 million
on football.
Funding will be sought from a
variety of sources. The bulk of
the money is expected from an
$825,000 increase in annual do
nations. The Spartan Founda
tion, which raises funds and pro
vides scholarships for athletes,
will contribute to the effort, ac
cording to the plan.

Other methods to draw atten
dance include giveaways. At each
home game, students can enter a
drawing to win a semester's tu
ition. At the Fresno State game

on Nov. 23, attendees can win a
motorcycle, Bell said.
Bell said that there will be a
fireworks show, concerts and
bands at some of the games.
In addition to promotional
events on game day, the athletics
department is also working to in
crease on-campus awareness of
games in all sports.
Kiosks and lighted marquees
are some ideas, Bell said.
Students also had some ideas
on how to let people know about
football games.
Laleighta Hin d, a senior busi
ness finance major, said the
school needed to get more on
campus residents involved.
"They should advertise more
in the residence halls," Hurd
said. "A lot of residents don't
come to the games."
Not only does the plan call for
increased student attendance, it
also aims for more involvement
from alumni and the community
at large.
Lawrence Fan, sports informa
tion officer for SJSU, described
how the athletic department is at
tempting to create more of a
media presence to let people
know about Spartan athletics.
"It's important to identify
what the good stories are," Fan
said. "It's about interacting be
tween students, athletes and
coaches."
Fan also emphasized the im
portance of football. Saturday's
game was televised, and a Saturn
blimp Hew over the stadium.
"College football generates
more publicity than any of the
other sports," Fan said.
The department has also hired
a professional firm, Hometown
Sports, to market the games.
According to the plan, the fis
cal year 2001-2002 intercolle
giate athletics budget was $1 1.6
million, in the bottom third of
WAC schools. The football bud
get is approximately $2.8 million
per year. Division I-A programs
typically spend up to $9 million
on football.
Funding will be sought from a
variety of sources. The bulk of
the money is expected from an
$825,000 increase in annual do
nations. The Spartan Founda
tion, which raises funds and pro
vides scholarships for athletes,
will contribute to the effort, ac
cording to the plan.
(U-WIRE) SAN JOSE — The
fight against Texas-El Paso last
Saturday wasn't the only battle at
Spartan Stadium. The other op
ponent: low attendance.
With an official turnout of
10,416 at Spartan Stadium on
Saturday, the school did slightly
better than its 8,506 home game
attendance average of last year.
Hut with a new NCAA require
ment that demands an average
attendance of 15,000 for Division
I-A teams by the 2004 season, it's
a long way to victory.
San Jose State University
president Robert Caret outlined
the challenge.
"We're facing a unit (lie set of'hur
dles that someone placed in front of
us," Caret said. "We just have to
muster the energy to face them."
Last week, the SJSU depart
ment revealed the 2002-2005
Master Plan, devised by Athletics
Director Chuck Bell.
There are two main goals to
the plan: To maintain NCAA Di
vision I-A status by raising atten
dance and to increase athletic
funding by $2.2 million by the
2005-2006 school year.
If the school does not meet
the requirements, the football
team will go to Division I-AA.,
which has no minimum atten
dance requirement.
This poses bigger problems
than ego bruising.
Bell said this could affect all
sports.
"If we are not 1-A status in
football, then we cannot be in the
Western Athletic Conference,"
Bell said.
The WAC, a conference that in
cludes Rice University and the
University of Hawaii, requires a
Division I-A football team. If the
football team does not make Divi
sion I-A, then all Spartan sports
teams in the WAC will be kicked
out of the conference.
Currently, five men's and
eight women's sports are in the
WAC, Bell said.
"Without being in a confer
ence, you can't fill your sched
ule," Bell said. "You have no one
to play. If could totally destroy all
of our sports."
Other regional conferences
exist, but there is no guarantee
that they will accept SJSU if it is

ejected from WAC, Bell said.
"We have to be ready for the
fact that if we don't make Divi
sion 1 (I-A) status in 2004, we
could be out of athletics com
pletely," he said.
Caret said a school without
football is not something he
wants to see.
"I don't want to look 20 years
down the road and see Fresno
(State University) being com
pared to Stanford and Cal," Caret
said. "They're playing them, and
who am I playing? Nobody."
The main hurdle to overcome
in keeping Division I-A status is
attendance.
SJSU football has one of the
smallest fan bases of any Division
I team in the nation, according to
the plan.
Wit h last year's average at 8,506
per game, attendance would need
to nearly double in two years to
meet the requirements.
John Ralston, football coach at
SJSU from 1993-1996 and cur
rent assistant to the athletic di
rector, said he was disappointed
in the dwindling attendance rate,
considering that SJSU currently
has approximately 28,000 stu
dents and 100,000 alumni.
"We just don't feel we're get
ting the support," Ralston said.
"Over the years, you recognize
students have outside interests."
Bell said that lack of student
interest in campus events can be
attributed to the commuter na
ture of the school.
"Students don't participate on
this campus," Bell said. "They
come to class and go home."
He said the athletic program is
building events around the game
to bring otherwise uninterested
students to the stadium. With
events such as Saturday's "Futbol
Americano" fiesta, the organizers
wanted to make football just one
part of an all-day event.
"There has to be an event that
will draw people to the stadium,"
Bell said. "They want to come to
the event, and by the way, there's
football."
The Mercury News reported
that the fiesta had about 50 peo
ple in attendance. About 2,000
people were expected.
