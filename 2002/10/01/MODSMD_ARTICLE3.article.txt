# Sigma Chi receives alcohol suspension
## University implements stronger NSO policy with clear consequences 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM MARK DOMINIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Office of the Dean of Stu
dents has placed the Sigma Chi fra
ternity on alcohol suspension after it
was alleged that the fraternity vio
lated University policy by serving al
cohol during ()rientation weekend.
The group will be on suspension
until the Greek Judicial Board and
the Dean of Students can review the
alleged violation. This may take as
many as three or four weeks, said
Joey Green well, assistant director of
student activities and Greek adviser,
because the board that will rule on
the violation is still being formed
and trained.
"We don't want to rush the
process," he said. "We want to be
fair to the process and fair to the
chapter."
The University Policy Regarding
New Student Orientation stipulates
that Orientation is officially a dry
weekend.
It states that "all student groups
and residences will host only alco
hol-free parties during Orientation.
I bis specifically means that no alco
hol is to be present, served or con
sumed at any parties in undergrad

nate residences during this time.
This includes upper-class resi
dences and houses on the Row."
Jared Scherer, assistant director
of student activities and director of
New Student Orientation, said that
while Orientation has always been
dry, the University altered the
wording of its policy this year, using
stronger language to remove ambi
guity surrounding what was or was
not acceptable.
"It's a rewording of our older
policy," Scherer said of this year's
policy. "The [previous] policy was a
bit more relaxed. It was hard to en
force something when we didn't re
ally lay out what the policy was and
what the consequences were."
He added, "The violations of
that policy are also pretty clearly
outlined. I think wejust really warn
ed to have a common language on
how to handle alcohol policy during
NSO."
The new policy states, "At no
time should any Stanford student
provide, serve or in any way have al
cohol available to any new under
graduate student."
It adds, "If the University is
made aware of individual students
and / or student groups who act in
violation of the NSO and Stanford's
alcohol policy, they will be referred
to a Residence Dean, Judicial Affairs
and / or the Dean of Students Office
for appropriate action."
The incident at Sigma Chi is al
leged to have occurred on Thurs

day, Sept. 19.
"The accusation is that Sigma
(>hi had an event where alcohol was
being served during New Student
Orientation," Green well said.
Because the alcohol policy pro
hibits such parties during Orienta
tion, the Dean of Students Office is
investigating the charges to deter
mine whether disciplinary action
must be taken.
"Any chapter event with alcohol
would have been in violation of the
policy," Greenwell said.
The policy does permit students
of legal drinking age to consume al
cohol privately during Orientation
weekend.
Sigma Chi leadership acknowl
edged that both freshmen and alco
hol were present at their house on
Sept. 19.
Sigma Chi leaders stressed that
the incident under investigation
was not an event sponsored by the
chapter.
"This was not a Sigma Chi


AC DOUGIAS/The Stanford Da
event," said senior Bobby Jaros,
president of Sigma Chi. "A small
number of individuals went out and
bought alcohol for themselves. Most
of those present at the house were
newer members and really didn't
understand the amended NSO al
cohol policy. When house man
agers noticed what was going on,
they shut it down right away."
He added, "Few Sigma Chi's
were even on campus at this time."
Scherer explained that the
stricter policy was intended to make

Orientation more similar to Admit
Weekend, as the goal of both events
is to acclimatize students to Stan
ford.
"112 fere are our expectations with
NSO: it's a dry weekend just like
Admit Weekend," he said. "We
think it's really important that stu
dents are focused â€” focused on
getting settled, getting to know their
roommates, their dorm mates."
Scherer said that a message was
sent to the student group e-mail list
to inform organizations about the
changed language of the policy.
Greenwell said he also sent an e
mail to the Greek organizations on
the first day of Orientation remind
ing t hem of the shift.

Jaros said that lie had received
the e-mail, but that it had not been
sent toother members of the frater
nity, so many were not aware of the
changes. I le, like many of the fra
ternity's officers, was not back on
campus from summer vacation
when tfie alleged incident occurred.
Jaros said that he didn't "recall
getting the point that [the policy]
was stricter this year" after reading
the e-mail.
Senior Alex Men le, a resident as
sistant at Sigma ('.hi, said that he was
also unaware of the University's
toughened stance.
"1 don't think that they made it
clear that they would be enforcing it
any harder than they had in the

past," he said. "And if you look into
the past, even the recent past, they
weren't making it very clear," he
said, referencing instances of Greek
organizations openly having kegs
during ()rientation weekend.
"We weren't the only ones break
ing the rules, but as a highly visible
C ireek organization, we understand
that we're going to be punished,"
Jaros said.
Scherer said that, on the whole,
he thought the changes in Universi
ty policy had been well-publicized.
"I really do think that the word
has gotten out there," Scherer said.
Overall, he said, "I'm actually really
pleased with the way things went
this year."
