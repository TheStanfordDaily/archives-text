# Sigma Chi receives alcohol suspension
## University implements stronger NSO policy with clear consequences 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM MARK DOMINIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Office of the Dean of Stu
dents has placed the Sigma Chi fra
ternity on alcohol suspension after it
was alleged that the fraternity vio
lated University policy by serving al
cohol during ()rientation weekend.
The group will be on suspension
until the Greek Judicial Board and
the Dean of Students can review the
alleged violation. This may take as
many as three or four weeks, said
Joey Green well, assistant director of
student activities and Greek adviser,
because the board that will rule on
the violation is still being formed
and trained.
"We don't want to rush the
process," he said. "We want to be
fair to the process and fair to the
chapter."
The University Policy Regarding
New Student Orientation stipulates
that Orientation is officially a dry
weekend.
It states that "all student groups
and residences will host only alco
hol-free parties during Orientation.
I bis specifically means that no alco
hol is to be present, served or con
sumed at any parties in undergrad

nate residences during this time.
This includes upper-class resi
dences and houses on the Row."
Jared Scherer, assistant director
of student activities and director of
New Student Orientation, said that
while Orientation has always been
dry, the University altered the
wording of its policy this year, using
stronger language to remove ambi
guity surrounding what was or was
not acceptable.
"It's a rewording of our older
policy," Scherer said of this year's
policy. "The [previous] policy was a
bit more relaxed. It was hard to en
force something when we didn't re
ally lay out what the policy was and
what the consequences were."
He added, "The violations of
that policy are also pretty clearly
outlined. I think wejust really warn
ed to have a common language on
how to handle alcohol policy during
NSO."
The new policy states, "At no
time should any Stanford student
provide, serve or in any way have al
cohol available to any new under
graduate student."
It adds, "If the University is
made aware of individual students
and / or student groups who act in
violation of the NSO and Stanford's
alcohol policy, they will be referred
to a Residence Dean, Judicial Affairs
and / or the Dean of Students Office
for appropriate action."
The incident at Sigma Chi is al
leged to have occurred on Thurs

day, Sept. 19.
"The accusation is that Sigma
(>hi had an event where alcohol was
being served during New Student
Orientation," Green well said.
Because the alcohol policy pro
hibits such parties during Orienta
tion, the Dean of Students Office is
investigating the charges to deter
mine whether disciplinary action
must be taken.
"Any chapter event with alcohol
would have been in violation of the
policy," Greenwell said.
The policy does permit students
of legal drinking age to consume al
cohol privately during Orientation
weekend.
Sigma Chi leadership acknowl
edged that both freshmen and alco
hol were present at their house on
Sept. 19.
Sigma Chi leaders stressed that
the incident under investigation
was not an event sponsored by the
chapter.
"This was not a Sigma Chi
