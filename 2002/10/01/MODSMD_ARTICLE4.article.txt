Stanford administrators and
faculty are in the process of look
ing fora new director of under
graduate advising, a position they
are redefining to encompass a
new vision of advising at the Uni
versity.
Undergraduate Advising Cen
ter Assoc. Director for Adminis
trative Services Chip Goldstein
has served as the interim director
since Lori White left over the
summer to assume a vice presi
dent position at Cal State-San
Diego. White had held the posi
tion of director since 1996.
Senior Assoc. Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education Ellen
Woods is a member of the search
committee that will recommend
candidates for the new director to
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education John Bravman. Woods
said that Bravman hopes to ap
point a current Stanford faculty
member for the position with the
approval of the provost and the
faculty member's department
chair and school dean.
Bravman is chairing the search
committee, which includes repre
sentatives from the University ad
ministration, faculty and the UAC.

Committee member Verity Pow
ell, an academic advisor with the
UAC, said slr- believes the ASSU
will designate a student represen
tative as well.
Powell said that there is no
strict timetable for finding a direc
tor.

"It's until we find the right per
son," she said. "We're not going to
rush just so we have a human
being in there."
The ideal candidate, Powell
said, will be "somebody who can


ANNA-CHRISTINA DOUGLAS/The Stanford Daily
advocate for students and cares
about the kind of services they re
ceive and can gel faculty involved
in the advising process."
"The search committee hasn't
really fleshed out what [the ideal
director's] background would be
beyond advocacy," Woods said.
However, she said that there are
three meetings scheduled for fall
quarter for committee members
to discuss characteristics that
would be effective fora director.
Whoever eventually takes the
title of director will have a signifi
cant opportunity to affect the cli
mate of undergraduate advising
at Stanford.
According to Woods, part of
the new director's responsibilities
would be "to determine the opti

mal role for faculty in advising
and mentoring at all levels —
how to define it, and how to ad
vocate for it."
"The person would shape the
position," Woods said. "It's a vi
sion. and how you accomplish that
vision is personal."
Woods said that Stanford has
been continuously redefining and
conceptualizing its advising pro
gram since the creation of fresh
man seminars six years ago. In the
current advising structure, she
said, "Seminars lead to mentoring
relationships which then can lead
to research."
"The biggest success in fresh
man services is that we offer choice
in how much students devote
[themselves] to advising," Woods
said. "That is a change in the last
few years for students who would
like to do a lot more self-reflection
or do a portfolio."
Powell said that those success

es are part of the reason that the
search committee wants to re
configure the director's job de
scription.
"It's time to ask that person to
do other things because what Lori
has clone was effective," she said.
Although she described the di
rectorship as a big-picture posi
tion in terms of collaborating with
departments, Powell said she''an
ticipated that the director would
work closely with students as well.
"A lot of key administrators
are actually freshman advisors,"
Powell said, citing University
President John Hennessy as an
example.
While the search committee
goes about its work, students do
not need to worry that the quality
of advising will suffer, Powell said.
She said that the staff at the UAC is
all experienced and in place, and
that day-to-day advising continues
to proceed as usual.
