# Students conflicted on Iraq

### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Editors Note: This article is the Jirst
in a weekly series investigating the re
lationship between the Stanford com
munity and the potential war in Iraq.

As the nation engages in de
bate over whether the United
States should take military action
against Iraq, many Stanford stu
dents are struggling to decide il
they will support a U.S.-led war
against Iraq.
While members of some polit
ical and religious campus organi
zations have clear-cut views on
how the United States should act,
student sentiment is character
ized largely by skepticism and
contusion — at times even
putting members of groups
which normally share similar
opinions on opposite sides of the
fence.
Even amongst the traditional
ly liberal undergraduate popula
tion at Stanford, it is not impossi
ble to find people decidedly in
support of war in Iraq.
Sophomore Joseph Fair
banks, president of the Stanford
College Republicans, is a strong
supporter of the Bush adminis
tration's case for action.
"I think we should do it very
soon," Fairbanks said. "We
should invade as soon as possible
since the conditions are right in
Iraq, and [we should] take him
out since he's obviously a danger
to us, to the region, to our allies
and our own people."
In contrast, junior lan Slat
tery, a member of the Stanford
Coalition for Peace and Justice,
said he felt taking action against
Iraq would be a mistake.
"I think most people in the
group are opposed to using mili
tary force — especially right
now," he said.
Nonetheless, overall the de
bate over Iraq has proved unique
in that it has left many otherwise
politically decisive students with
out clear opinions — largely, t hey
say, do to a lack of information.
"I normally have an answer to
about everything and I can't fig
ure this one out — I'm constant
ly torn," said senior Josh Benson,
editor of The Stanford Progres
sive. "I don't think any of us,
even across the country, have
heard enough."
Benson said that the edit
board of the Progressive — a
publication intending to bring
the voice oi the Democratic Party
to campus — is not of one mind
set on war in Iraq.
"It's kind of interesting from
The Progressive because all of the
people on the editorial board are
wrestling over what stance to
take."
Tali Golan, co-chair of the
Stanford Israel Alliance, stressed
that the security of Israel isof pri
mary concern among the

group's members, but she also
noted that opinion amongst (lie
Alliance varies widely.
"There are some members
within our group which support a
military attack on Iraq by the
United Slates to wipe out Saddam
Hussein's regime and rebuild the
country," Golan said. "However,
there are also members who do
not support any kind of attack on
Iraq due to various reasons but
would rather see a diplomatic
course of action take place."
Even those with more firm
views said that what they have
witnessed among other students
belies typical political alignment
of students.
"I think a lot of people, a lot of
students, are hesitant about this,"
Slattery said. "Exponentially
more so than with Afghanistan. I
think it's a really interesting
thing that the administration is
trying to make a strong case for it
and are meeting with dissent."
He added, "People who
would normal say it is good idea
are reconsidering that."
Fairbanks, who said he
thought general campus senti
ment was iti favor of war, agreed
that this issue is strongly charac
terized by indecision.
"From conversations I've
had, it seems like most students

don't really know,"he said.
"They're straddling the fence
right now because they haven't
heard both sides."
Students felt that if there was
one thing that characterized
both themselves and their peers,
it was a desire for clarity on what
is at stake and what U.S. objec
tives in Iraq truly are.
"I think that people on cam
pus at e conf used because of the
timing—l've heard so many
people say it seems so out of the
blue," said senior Brandon
Weiss. "I don't know what our of
ficial policy is — getting Saddam
out or getting rid of weapons?"
Senior Mohammed Ab
doolkarim, a member of the
Muslim Students Awareness
Network, felt that the lack of an
swers available to students
about the outcome of war was a
cause of what he sees as a gener
al reluctance to endorse Bush's
arguments.
"From talking with people, a
lot don't show expressions of
going with the war," he said. "A
lot of them don't even know why
the war is being fought and what
the point of it is.
"But other than that, from the
people that I've talked with, I feel
people have serious doubts about
the war and it's implications."

tery, a member of the Stanford
Coalition for Peace and Justice,
said he felt taking action against
Iraq would be a mistake.
"I think most people in the
group are opposed to using mili
tary force — especially right
now," he said.
Nonetheless, overall the de
bate over Iraq has proved unique
in that it has left many otherwise
politically decisive students with
out clear opinions — largely, t hey
say, do to a lack of information.
"I normally have an answer to
about everything and I can't fig
ure this one out — I'm constant
ly torn," said senior Josh Benson,
editor of The Stanford Progres
sive. "I don't think any of us,
even across the country, have
heard enough."
Benson said that the edit
board of the Progressive — a
publication intending to bring
the voice oi the Democratic Party
to campus — is not of one mind
set on war in Iraq.
"It's kind of interesting from
The Progressive because all of the
people on the editorial board are
wrestling over what stance to
take."
Tali Golan, co-chair of the
Stanford Israel Alliance, stressed
that the security of Israel isof pri
mary concern among the

group's members, but she also
noted that opinion amongst (lie
Alliance varies widely.
"There are some members
within our group which support a
military attack on Iraq by the
United Slates to wipe out Saddam
Hussein's regime and rebuild the
country," Golan said. "However,
there are also members who do
not support any kind of attack on
Iraq due to various reasons but
would rather see a diplomatic
course of action take place."
Even those with more firm
views said that what they have
witnessed among other students
belies typical political alignment
of students.
"I think a lot of people, a lot of
students, are hesitant about this,"
Slattery said. "Exponentially
more so than with Afghanistan. I
think it's a really interesting
thing that the administration is
trying to make a strong case for it
and are meeting with dissent."
He added, "People who
would normal say it is good idea
are reconsidering that."
Fairbanks, who said he
thought general campus senti
ment was iti favor of war, agreed
that this issue is strongly charac
terized by indecision.
"From conversations I've
had, it seems like most students

don't really know,"he said.
"They're straddling the fence
right now because they haven't
heard both sides."
Students felt that if there was
one thing that characterized
both themselves and their peers,
it was a desire for clarity on what
is at stake and what U.S. objec
tives in Iraq truly are.
"I think that people on cam
pus at e conf used because of the
timing—l've heard so many
people say it seems so out of the
blue," said senior Brandon
Weiss. "I don't know what our of
ficial policy is — getting Saddam
out or getting rid of weapons?"
Senior Mohammed Ab
doolkarim, a member of the
Muslim Students Awareness
Network, felt that the lack of an
swers available to students
about the outcome of war was a
cause of what he sees as a gener
al reluctance to endorse Bush's
arguments.
"From talking with people, a
lot don't show expressions of
going with the war," he said. "A
lot of them don't even know why
the war is being fought and what
the point of it is.
"But other than that, from the
people that I've talked with, I feel
people have serious doubts about
the war and it's implications."

Editors Note: This article is the Jirst
in a weekly series investigating the re
lationship between the Stanford com
munity and the potential war in Iraq.

As the nation engages in de
bate over whether the United
States should take military action
against Iraq, many Stanford stu
dents are struggling to decide il
they will support a U.S.-led war
against Iraq.
While members of some polit
ical and religious campus organi
zations have clear-cut views on
how the United States should act,
student sentiment is character
ized largely by skepticism and
contusion — at times even
putting members of groups
which normally share similar
opinions on opposite sides of the
fence.
Even amongst the traditional
ly liberal undergraduate popula
tion at Stanford, it is not impossi
ble to find people decidedly in
support of war in Iraq.
Sophomore Joseph Fair
banks, president of the Stanford
College Republicans, is a strong
supporter of the Bush adminis
tration's case for action.
"I think we should do it very
soon," Fairbanks said. "We
should invade as soon as possible
since the conditions are right in
Iraq, and [we should] take him
out since he's obviously a danger
to us, to the region, to our allies
and our own people."
In contrast, junior lan Slat
tery, a member of the Stanford
Coalition for Peace and Justice,
said he felt taking action against
Iraq would be a mistake.
"I think most people in the
