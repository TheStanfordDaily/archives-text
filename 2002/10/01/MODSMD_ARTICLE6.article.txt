### HELEN KIM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Last month, approximately 75 pioneer
ing Stanford students took advantage of a
unique way to escape from the infamous
"Stanford bubble" by learning hands-on in
one of four countries around the globe.
Students who participated in Stanford's
first Overseas Seminars this September,
taught by Stanford faculty in China, Bel
gium, Russia and South Korea, came back
raving about the unique educational op

portunity to personally witness what they
were learning about in foreign lands.
These five three-week-long seminars of
about 15 students each, organized by the
Overseas Studies Program, ranged from
"The Political Economy of the European
Union" in Leuvcn, Belgium to "Korea in a
Globalizing World" in Seoul, South Korea.
The seminars, each worth two units of
credit, allowed students to apply what they
learned in the classroom to the actual lot a
lion where the events had occurred.
"I thought the seminar was a fantastic

opportunity for students to learn about
Korea," said Assoc. Prof, of Sociology Gi-
Wook Shin, who taught the Korean semi
nar. "1 was particularly impressed with stu
dent presentations of their projects, given
the short period of time in which they
had."
Students from the Korean seminar
mingled with Seoul National University
students, who participated in activities with
them. Logether, the two groups visited
Samsung Electronic's CEO, had dinner
with two congressmen and went to the de

militarized zone separating the two Kore
as, among other activities.
"I remember myself ;tt the [demilita
rized zone] staring into North Korea with
the knowledge that millions of land mines
laid just a few feet from me," said senior
David Juan. " The history of the (lold War
which I learned in < lass never impacted me
until that day."
In Belgium, Stanford students in the
European Union seminar also went on sev
eral field trips and met many prominent
people.

" The seminar consisted of a number of
lectures and class discussions in Leuven,
meetings with European politicians, diplo
mats and government officials, visits to the
E.U. institutions and NATO in Brussels,
and a number of cultural activities and city
trips in Flanders and Holland," said Uni
versity of Leuven Visiting Prof, of Eco
nomics Christophe Crombez, who taught
the seminar with Prof. Tim Josling from
the Institute lor International Studies.
