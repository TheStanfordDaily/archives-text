# Overseas Seminars give Stanford students international perspective
## 
### HELEN KIM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Last month, approximately 75 pioneer
ing Stanford students took advantage of a
unique way to escape from the infamous
"Stanford bubble" by learning hands-on in
one of four countries around the globe.
Students who participated in Stanford's
first Overseas Seminars this September,
taught by Stanford faculty in China, Bel
gium, Russia and South Korea, came back
raving about the unique educational op

portunity to personally witness what they
were learning about in foreign lands.
These five three-week-long seminars of
about 15 students each, organized by the
Overseas Studies Program, ranged from
"The Political Economy of the European
Union" in Leuvcn, Belgium to "Korea in a
Globalizing World" in Seoul, South Korea.
The seminars, each worth two units of
credit, allowed students to apply what they
learned in the classroom to the actual lot a
lion where the events had occurred.
"I thought the seminar was a fantastic

opportunity for students to learn about
Korea," said Assoc. Prof, of Sociology Gi-
Wook Shin, who taught the Korean semi
nar. "1 was particularly impressed with stu
dent presentations of their projects, given
the short period of time in which they
had."
Students from the Korean seminar
mingled with Seoul National University
students, who participated in activities with
them. Logether, the two groups visited
Samsung Electronic's CEO, had dinner
with two congressmen and went to the de

militarized zone separating the two Kore
as, among other activities.
"I remember myself ;tt the [demilita
rized zone] staring into North Korea with
the knowledge that millions of land mines
laid just a few feet from me," said senior
David Juan. " The history of the (lold War
which I learned in < lass never impacted me
until that day."
In Belgium, Stanford students in the
European Union seminar also went on sev
eral field trips and met many prominent
people.

" The seminar consisted of a number of
lectures and class discussions in Leuven,
meetings with European politicians, diplo
mats and government officials, visits to the
E.U. institutions and NATO in Brussels,
and a number of cultural activities and city
trips in Flanders and Holland," said Uni
versity of Leuven Visiting Prof, of Eco
nomics Christophe Crombez, who taught
the seminar with Prof. Tim Josling from
the Institute lor International Studies.
"The trip was, to put it simply,
amazing," said senior Katie Hark
ness. "Overseas seminars take the
concept of Sophomore College, an
intensive two-week period to focus
all of one's energy on a certain
topic, and place the learning in a
dynamic and unforgettable envi
ronment. It was the ultimate
hands-on experience."
"Chinese Language, Culture
and Society," one of the two Beijing
seminars, had a more cultural focus
in its activities. Students visited
places such as the Great Wall of
China, the Temple of Confucius,
the Forbidden City and the
Shaanxi Museum of History.
"The best part about China was
making friends there," said junior
Colin Connolly. "Being a tourist

and hitting all the major attractions
can only teach you so much; a cul
ture is in its people."
Asian Languages Assoc. Prof.
Chao Fen Sun, who taught the
seminar, said, "The Overseas Sem
inar organized by the ()SP this year
lias overcome a common difficulty
that may easily diminish the quality
of undergraduate studies in East
Asian humanities for the sheer fi
nancial and logistical problem of
arranging travel to East Asia."
"Reform and Local Elections in
China," the other Beijing seminar,
had more of a political edge to its
content. Students visited places
such as villages in Heilongjjang
Province and the border between
Russia and China to learn more
about village elections.
"We experienced the tremen
dous variation in standards of liv
ing that has been created by re
forms— from the still primitive
outhouses in the countryside to the

gleaming sky scrapers and ultra
modern factories in Shanghai,"
said Chinese Politics Prof. Jean Oi.
"No other group of foreign stu
dents has even gotten to observe
elections, and we observed two,"
said student Zachary Levine.
"Maybe we found some things that
contradicted what we read and dis
cussed, maybe we found some
things that were the same, but
when you encounter them in per
son they take on a whole new
meaning."
"Repression, Reform and Revo
lution: Music, Culture and Politics
in Russia, 1855-1917," the seminar
in Moscow, was taught by Political
Science Prof. Coit Blacker and Se
nior Lecturer in Music Frederick
Weldy.
"Pretty much every afternoon
and every evening were taken up
with some kind of cultural or artis
tic event — from seeing Swan Lake
at the Bolshoi Theater to hearing

Tchaikovsky performed by the St.
Petersburg Symphony Orchestra
to viewing great art at the
Tretyakov Gallery and the Her
mitage," Blacker said.
"As for highlights, it's difficult to
choose. Andy Chen almost being
arrested in St. Petersburg for trying
to scale the monument to Peter I
called 'The Bronze I lorseman' was
certainly memorable."
Blacker added: "So too, more
seriously, was hearing Professor
Weldy play the music of Rimsky-
Korsakov in the composer's
home —no more than 20 leet
from where the score was actually
written — which was where we
held class in St. Petersburg."
When asked what he would
plan differently for future semi
nars, Blacker said, "Outline in
advance why a boat ride on the
Neva River and three quick shots
of Russian vodka may not be the
best of combinations."

seminar, said, "The Overseas Sem
inar organized by the ()SP this year
lias overcome a common difficulty
that may easily diminish the quality
of undergraduate studies in East
Asian humanities for the sheer fi
nancial and logistical problem of
arranging travel to East Asia."
"Reform and Local Elections in
China," the other Beijing seminar,
had more of a political edge to its
content. Students visited places
such as villages in Heilongjjang
Province and the border between
Russia and China to learn more
about village elections.
"We experienced the tremen
dous variation in standards of liv
ing that has been created by re
forms— from the still primitive
outhouses in the countryside to the

gleaming sky scrapers and ultra
modern factories in Shanghai,"
said Chinese Politics Prof. Jean Oi.
"No other group of foreign stu
dents has even gotten to observe
elections, and we observed two,"
said student Zachary Levine.
"Maybe we found some things that
contradicted what we read and dis
cussed, maybe we found some
things that were the same, but
when you encounter them in per
son they take on a whole new
meaning."
"Repression, Reform and Revo
lution: Music, Culture and Politics
in Russia, 1855-1917," the seminar
in Moscow, was taught by Political
Science Prof. Coit Blacker and Se
nior Lecturer in Music Frederick
Weldy.
"Pretty much every afternoon
and every evening were taken up
with some kind of cultural or artis
tic event — from seeing Swan Lake
at the Bolshoi Theater to hearing

Tchaikovsky performed by the St.
Petersburg Symphony Orchestra
to viewing great art at the
Tretyakov Gallery and the Her
mitage," Blacker said.
"As for highlights, it's difficult to
choose. Andy Chen almost being
arrested in St. Petersburg for trying
to scale the monument to Peter I
called 'The Bronze I lorseman' was
certainly memorable."
Blacker added: "So too, more
seriously, was hearing Professor
Weldy play the music of Rimsky-
Korsakov in the composer's
home —no more than 20 leet
from where the score was actually
written — which was where we
held class in St. Petersburg."
When asked what he would
plan differently for future semi
nars, Blacker said, "Outline in
advance why a boat ride on the
Neva River and three quick shots
of Russian vodka may not be the
best of combinations."

Students participating in an Overseas Seminar in Seoul, South Korea pose
during a class outing.
Last month, approximately 75 pioneer
ing Stanford students took advantage of a
unique way to escape from the infamous
"Stanford bubble" by learning hands-on in
one of four countries around the globe.
Students who participated in Stanford's
first Overseas Seminars this September,
taught by Stanford faculty in China, Bel
gium, Russia and South Korea, came back
raving about the unique educational op

portunity to personally witness what they
were learning about in foreign lands.
These five three-week-long seminars of
about 15 students each, organized by the
Overseas Studies Program, ranged from
"The Political Economy of the European
Union" in Leuvcn, Belgium to "Korea in a
Globalizing World" in Seoul, South Korea.
The seminars, each worth two units of
credit, allowed students to apply what they
learned in the classroom to the actual lot a
lion where the events had occurred.
"I thought the seminar was a fantastic

opportunity for students to learn about
Korea," said Assoc. Prof, of Sociology Gi-
Wook Shin, who taught the Korean semi
nar. "1 was particularly impressed with stu
dent presentations of their projects, given
the short period of time in which they
had."
Students from the Korean seminar
mingled with Seoul National University
students, who participated in activities with
them. Logether, the two groups visited
Samsung Electronic's CEO, had dinner
with two congressmen and went to the de

militarized zone separating the two Kore
as, among other activities.
"I remember myself ;tt the [demilita
rized zone] staring into North Korea with
the knowledge that millions of land mines
laid just a few feet from me," said senior
David Juan. " The history of the (lold War
which I learned in < lass never impacted me
until that day."
In Belgium, Stanford students in the
European Union seminar also went on sev
eral field trips and met many prominent
people.

" The seminar consisted of a number of
lectures and class discussions in Leuven,
meetings with European politicians, diplo
mats and government officials, visits to the
E.U. institutions and NATO in Brussels,
and a number of cultural activities and city
trips in Flanders and Holland," said Uni
versity of Leuven Visiting Prof, of Eco
nomics Christophe Crombez, who taught
the seminar with Prof. Tim Josling from
the Institute lor International Studies.
"The trip was, to put it simply,
amazing," said senior Katie Hark
ness. "Overseas seminars take the
concept of Sophomore College, an
intensive two-week period to focus
all of one's energy on a certain
topic, and place the learning in a
dynamic and unforgettable envi
ronment. It was the ultimate
hands-on experience."
"Chinese Language, Culture
and Society," one of the two Beijing
seminars, had a more cultural focus
in its activities. Students visited
places such as the Great Wall of
China, the Temple of Confucius,
the Forbidden City and the
Shaanxi Museum of History.
"The best part about China was
making friends there," said junior
Colin Connolly. "Being a tourist

and hitting all the major attractions
can only teach you so much; a cul
ture is in its people."
Asian Languages Assoc. Prof.
Chao Fen Sun, who taught the
