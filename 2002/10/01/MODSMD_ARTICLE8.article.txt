### LAUREL ROBERTS CONTRIBUTING WRITTER 
Father Roy Bourgeois, founder and co
director of iht' School of Americas Watch,
spoke yesterday to a crowd of nearly 100
students, faculty members and nuns about
the atrocities committed by the U.S. Army
School of Americas and the watch's move
ment to dissolve the SOA.
Bourgeois' speaking engagement was or
ganized by the Sophomore College ( lass "In
Our Own Backyard: The Central American
Wars," taught by Religious Studies Prof.
Thomas Sheehan.
The SOA — renamed the Western
I leniisphere Institute for Security Coopera
tion in 2001—was founded in 1946 in
Panama to train soldiers and provide stabil
ity to Latin America. In 1984 the base was
relocated in Ft. Bennings, Ga., where it re
mains today.
The base currently trains Latin American
soldiers in warfare techniques.
Fhe Western Hemisphere Organization
continues to be supported by U.S. taxpayer
dollars and has an annual budget of $4 mil
lion. It has trained over 60,000 soldiers,
many of whom have gone on to commit acts
such as murder, group massacre, torture
and rape, according to Bourgeois.
Bourgeois highlighted particular actions
of SOA graduates, including the 1989

killing of six Jesuit priests and a mother and
daughter in El Salvador, the 1980 assassina
tion of Salvadorian archbishop Oscar
Romero, and the 1980 rape and murder of
three American nuns and a Catholic lay
worker.
Bourgeois, a Roman Catholic priest,
Vietnam veteran and former missionary,
started the watch in 1990 in response to
these incidents. The goal of the watch is to
close the Ft. Bennings base and to change
U.S. foreign policy in Latin America
through education of the public.
Ol the Ft. Bennings base, Bourgeois
asked, "How can democracy be taught
through the barrel of a gun?"
The watch has lobbied Congress for pas
sage of a bill to close Ft. Bennings. Three
years ago, this bill passed the 1 louse but lost
in the Senate by one vote. Bourgeois said he
expects Congress to readdress this bill in two
years.
In his lecture, Bourgeois also critiqued
American foreign policy in Latin America.
He feels the SOA is still in operation because
it "provides muscle for American foreign
policy and urges our economic interests."
He emphasized that this issue is also re
lated to the current crisis in Iraq, as well as
the nation's post 9/11 recovery.
"These are challenging times," Bour-

geois said.
Sheehan's Sophomore College
class also addressed such issues.
Sheehan's class, including Student
Assistants senior Christopher Curt is
and graduate student Kathleen
Tierney, invited Bourgeois to speak
in order to educate the community.
"More than anything, aware
ness is the number-one thing peo
ple need to leave with," Curtis
said.
"Our goal was informing peo
ple," Sophomore College partici
pant Percy Link said. "Facts speak
for themselves."
Link additionally noted that
Bourgeois did a fine job at relating
information, and applauded the
Father's down-to-earth nature,
personality and charm.
