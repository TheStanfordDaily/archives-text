This marks a new beginning for the
Episcopal and Lutheran Chaplaincies at
Stanford University. The Episcopal
Lutheran Campus Ministry (elcm) unites
the two previously separate ministries to
better serve students, faculty and staff
with worship, learning, and fellowship in
the Anglican and Lutheran traditions. The
yoking of the two ministries follows the
recent decision of the Episcopal Church
USA (ECUSA) and the Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) to
share in full communion; elcm seeks to
celebrate this unity as we are "Called to
Common Mission" by Christ.
The Anglican and Lutheran traditions
have flourished in academic communities
in England, Europe and throughout the
world. We are protestant, but not funda
mentals. We appreciate doubt as much as
we celebrate faith. We use scripture,
tradition, and reason to inspire living faith.
And we invite you to share with us the
company of Christ in an open and
inclusive environment.
