## Lautenberg to run for Senate N.J. governor chooses 78-year-old Lautenberg to replace Torricelli 
### 
PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) —
Desperate to keep their single-seat
majority in the Senate, Democrats
chose former Sen. Frank Lauten
berg yesterday to replace scandal
tainted Sen. Robert Torricelli on
the November ballot.
Cov. James E. McGreevey
chose the 78-year-old, three-term
senator after a full day of meetings
among top state Democrats, say
ing his legislative record and
stand on social issues followed the
party line.
Lautenberg, who retired two
years ago, said he was ready to run.
"None of the enthusiasm has
died," Lautenberg said. "1 will
fight just as hard. 1 am just as en
ergized."
"When it comes to Mr. Lauten
berg, the voters are going to say,
'Been there, done that,' " said Bill
Pascoe, campaign manager for Re
publican candidate Douglas For
rester. "It's time for new leader
ship."
Democrats settled on Lauten
berg after a number of other
prominent politicians took them
selves out of the running. U.S.
Rep. Robert Menendez said he
wanted to pursue a leadership po
sition in the I louse, where he is the
fourth-ranking Democrat.
State leaders offered the job to
Assembly Majority Leader Joseph
J. Roberts, but national party lead
ers didn't think he had the name
recognition to win a statewide
race, sources familiar with the ne
gotiations told The Associated
Press.
By late afternoon, discussions
focused on U.S. Rep. Frank Pal
lone, but he also withdrew, accord
ing to the sources, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
The New Jersey Supreme
Court will hear arguments today

on whether Lautenberg's name
can appear on the ballot. Republi
cans say it is too late to replace Tor
ricelli, who dropped out Monday
as his poll numbers continued to
fall amid questions about his
ethics.
Sen. William Frist, chairman of
the Senate GOP campaign commit
tee, said Republicans would consid
er appealing to.the U.S. Supreme
Court if the New Jersey court rules
in favor of the Democrats.
"This is a desperate grasp at
getting around the law and the
people of New Jersey are tired of
having their leaders go around the
law," he said.
Frist said some absentee ballots
have already been cast and that
other ballots have been distributed
to military personnel overseas; the
New Jersey Association of County
Clerks said about 1,600 absentee
ballots were mailed out.
Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., said that by ob
jecting to Torricelli's request, Re
publicans were "denying the peo
ple of New Jersey a choice" in the
election.
Five months ago, Torricelli's
Senate seat was considered rela
tively safe. But support plummet
ed after he was admonished by the
Senate ethics committee for his re
lationship with a 1996 campaign
supporter, and he soon became
the most vulnerable incumbent in
the country.
Few, however, expected a court
light five weeks before Election
Day.
"This is one for the books," said
Larry Sabato, a political scientist at
the University of Virginia. "It will
long be remembered."
Under New Jersey law, a party
can replace a statewide nominee
on the ballot if the person drops
out at least 51 days before the elec
tion. Torricelli missed the dead
line by 15 days.
However, Democrats say
decades of state court decisions
put voters' rights above filing

deadlines and other technical
guidelines.
Attorney General David Sam
son argued in papers filed with
the court yesterday that the jus
tices have the power to relax the
deadline to withdraw and allow
Democrats to post another candi
date. Samson, who was appointed
to his job by McGreevey, said elec
tion laws have long been inter
preted liberally to allow voters
every opportunity.
Legal experts agreed.
"In a substantial number of
those cases, the courts have ruled
on the side of being inclusive," said
Richard Perr, an election law pro
fessor at Rutgers University Law
School.
Six of the seven justices on the
state's highest court were appointed
by a former Republican governor.
Lautenberg's selection as the po
tential Democratic savior is replete
with irony. He and Torricelli feud
ed openly while serving together.
"I'm not in a gloating mode,"
Lautenberg said. "I don't want to
be smugabout this. It was unfortu
nate for him and an unfortunate
thing for all of us."
Lautenberg is a supporter of
abortion rights and staunch oppo
nent of the death penalty. He
brings two major strengths to the
difficult bid: statewide name
recognition and a huge reserve of
personal wealth he can use in the
campaign. Also, unlike the House
members who were also consid
ered as substitute candidates, he
does not have anything to lose by
running and losing.
Lautenberg was a business ex
ecutive before serving three
terms in the Senate, deciding
against a re-election bid in 2000.
He counted among his accom
plishments a law requiring com
panies to disclose chemicals they
release into the environment, a
law banning smoking on domes
tic: flights and a law banning gun
ownership by those convicted of
domestic violence.

thing for all of us."
Lautenberg is a supporter of
abortion rights and staunch oppo
nent of the death penalty. He
brings two major strengths to the
difficult bid: statewide name
recognition and a huge reserve of
personal wealth he can use in the
campaign. Also, unlike the House
members who were also consid
ered as substitute candidates, he
does not have anything to lose by
running and losing.
Lautenberg was a business ex
ecutive before serving three
terms in the Senate, deciding
against a re-election bid in 2000.
He counted among his accom
plishments a law requiring com
panies to disclose chemicals they
release into the environment, a
law banning smoking on domes

ownership by those convicted of
domestic violence.
PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) —
Desperate to keep their single-seat
majority in the Senate, Democrats
chose former Sen. Frank Lauten
berg yesterday to replace scandal
tainted Sen. Robert Torricelli on
the November ballot.
Cov. James E. McGreevey
chose the 78-year-old, three-term
senator after a full day of meetings
among top state Democrats, say
ing his legislative record and
stand on social issues followed the
party line.
Lautenberg, who retired two
years ago, said he was ready to run.
"None of the enthusiasm has
died," Lautenberg said. "1 will
fight just as hard. 1 am just as en
ergized."
"When it comes to Mr. Lauten
berg, the voters are going to say,
'Been there, done that,' " said Bill
Pascoe, campaign manager for Re
publican candidate Douglas For
rester. "It's time for new leader
ship."
Democrats settled on Lauten
berg after a number of other
prominent politicians took them
selves out of the running. U.S.
Rep. Robert Menendez said he
wanted to pursue a leadership po
sition in the I louse, where he is the
fourth-ranking Democrat.
State leaders offered the job to
Assembly Majority Leader Joseph
J. Roberts, but national party lead
ers didn't think he had the name
recognition to win a statewide
race, sources familiar with the ne
gotiations told The Associated
Press.
By late afternoon, discussions
focused on U.S. Rep. Frank Pal
lone, but he also withdrew, accord
ing to the sources, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
The New Jersey Supreme
Court will hear arguments today

on whether Lautenberg's name
can appear on the ballot. Republi
cans say it is too late to replace Tor
ricelli, who dropped out Monday
as his poll numbers continued to
fall amid questions about his
ethics.
Sen. William Frist, chairman of
the Senate GOP campaign commit
tee, said Republicans would consid
er appealing to.the U.S. Supreme
Court if the New Jersey court rules
in favor of the Democrats.
"This is a desperate grasp at
getting around the law and the
people of New Jersey are tired of
having their leaders go around the
law," he said.
Frist said some absentee ballots
have already been cast and that
other ballots have been distributed
to military personnel overseas; the
New Jersey Association of County
Clerks said about 1,600 absentee
ballots were mailed out.
Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., said that by ob
jecting to Torricelli's request, Re
publicans were "denying the peo
ple of New Jersey a choice" in the
election.
Five months ago, Torricelli's
Senate seat was considered rela
tively safe. But support plummet
ed after he was admonished by the
Senate ethics committee for his re
lationship with a 1996 campaign
supporter, and he soon became
the most vulnerable incumbent in
the country.
Few, however, expected a court
light five weeks before Election
Day.
"This is one for the books," said
Larry Sabato, a political scientist at
the University of Virginia. "It will
long be remembered."
Under New Jersey law, a party
can replace a statewide nominee
on the ballot if the person drops
out at least 51 days before the elec
tion. Torricelli missed the dead
line by 15 days.
However, Democrats say
decades of state court decisions
put voters' rights above filing

deadlines and other technical
guidelines.
Attorney General David Sam
son argued in papers filed with
the court yesterday that the jus
tices have the power to relax the
deadline to withdraw and allow
Democrats to post another candi
date. Samson, who was appointed
to his job by McGreevey, said elec
tion laws have long been inter
preted liberally to allow voters
every opportunity.
Legal experts agreed.
"In a substantial number of
those cases, the courts have ruled
on the side of being inclusive," said
Richard Perr, an election law pro
fessor at Rutgers University Law
School.
Six of the seven justices on the
state's highest court were appointed
by a former Republican governor.
Lautenberg's selection as the po
tential Democratic savior is replete
with irony. He and Torricelli feud
ed openly while serving together.
"I'm not in a gloating mode,"
Lautenberg said. "I don't want to
be smugabout this. It was unfortu
nate for him and an unfortunate
thing for all of us."
