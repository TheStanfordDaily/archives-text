# U.S. thwarts U.N. inspections
## Powell says that inspecting Iraqi weapons should be delayed until new Security Council resolution 
### 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) â€” Iraq accused the Unit
ed States of trying to thwart U.N. inspectors' work,
criticizing U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell for
urging a delay in resuming inspections until the
U.N. Security Council adopts tougher measures.
"The steps taken by the U.S. administration are
to make it more difficult for the inspectors to do
their job. I think the United States is in a . . . weak
position," Iraqi Culture Minister Hammed Youssef
Hamadi told reporters late yesterday at the close of
the Babylon International Festival 100 kilometers
(60 miles) south of Baghdad.
U.N. inspectors agreed with Iraqi officials yes
terday in Vienna, Austria, on logistics for U.N. in
spections to resume in Iraq after a four-year break.
The inspectors are to search for and dismantle any
weapons of mass destruction; Iraq maintains its ar
senal has been destroyed.
Hamadi did not directly comment on the agree
ment in his brief remarks. However, Humam Ab
dulkhaleq Abdul Ghafoor, an envoy for Iraqi

leader Saddam I lussein, said today during a visit to
Indonesia that he hoped inspectors would return
"as soon as possible" and maintained they would
not find hidden weapons.
"We are saying that we don't have such
weapons," he said in Jakarta, where he planned to
convey a message from Saddam to Indonesian
President Megawati Sukarnoputri.
Iraq has said it expected an advance party in
Baghdad in two weeks. Chief U.N. inspector Hans
Blix, who led the Vienna talks for the U.N. team,
said an advance team could deploy then with the
go-ahead from the U.N. Security Council.
The deal reached in Vienna ignores U.S. de
mands for access to Saddam's palaces and some of
the other tough provisions of a proposed new reso
lution governing inspections being put forward by
the United States and Britain. The security council
remains sharply divided on whether to adopt the
proposal.
Powell said in Washington that the search tor
hidden arsenals in Iraq should be delayed until the
Security Council adopts tough new rules. "Our po
sition," Powell said, "is that he (Blix) should get new
instructions in the form of a resolution." The Secu
rity Council will adopt its resolution without nego
tiating with Iraq, Powell added.
