## The 						Stanford Daily Islamic studies program to fill void at Stanford 
### 
Published Since 1891

Islam is the second largest religion in
the world. But if you have ever
opened a copy of the Stanford Bul
letin, you would have no idea that
there are over 1.2 billion Muslims in the
world, and Islam is one of the world's
fastest growing faiths.
That's because Stanford, compared to
other elite American universities, has very
few course offerings about Islam and has not
made the study of the Muslim world a prior
ity. But with the news last week that faculty
members have begun plans to create an Is
lamic studies program at Stanford, it seems
that the University is finally ready to make a
commitment to teaching about this extreme
ly important and timely field.
We applaud the effort to establish an Is
lamic studies program, including the deci

sion by the School of Humanities and Sci
ences to create two new faculty appoint
ments in the field.
The proposal to make an Islamic studies
program that represents different facets of
Islam — religion, history, literature, lan
guage and anthropology — is an added
bonus. Stanford students will be able to think
critically about the various aspects of Islam,
instead of viewing the often misunderstood
faith as some monolithic entity, as it is usual
ly portrayed in the American media. Hope
fully, as more Stanford students — and
Americans — begin understanding Islam in
more depth, acts of hate against Muslims in
the United States — like the dozens of hate
e-mails received by Stanford's Islamic society
last year — will decrease.
Because the Islamic studies program will

not be put into place fora few years, the Uni
versity must continue to try to meet its stu
dents' demands by increasing its current ef
forts of offering classes related to the Islamic
world. In part due to the aftermath of the
Sept. 11 attacks, classes on international re
lations, terrorism and the Muslim world
have been overflowing with students. For ex
ample, for the first time, the Beginning Ara
bic class last year needed two separate sec
tions to accommodate all interested stu
dents. This year, there are over 40 students
in Beginning Arabic classes.
Despite this interest, there clearly are not
enough classes or faculty members at Stan
ford to teach courses on Islamic studies. UC-
Berkeley, Harvard, Princeton and Duke all
have strong Islamic or Middle Eastern stud
ies programs. As a comparison, Stanford

does not even have one political science pro
fessor who specializes in the Middle East or
South Asia, or one tenure-track religious
studies professor who focuses on Islam. The
only professor who came close to filling this
void in the Religious Studies Department
was Ebrahim Moosa, a renowned professor
of Islam who left Stanford two years ago to
accept a tenure-track position at Duke. Cur
rently, the only University department that
seems to care about the Islamic world is the
History Department, which has two profes
sors, Joel Beinin and Ahmed Dallal, who
focus on that region.
The proposed Islamic studies program
will hopefully fill these gaps in the Stanford
curricula and will provide future Stanford
students with new resources to help change
the world for the better.
