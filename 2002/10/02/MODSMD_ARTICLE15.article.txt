Alum: 'Old analogies die hard'
In the Oct. 1 column ("United States
finds itself alone in the fight against Sad
dam"), Arnold Beichman's selective read
ing of history evokes that most cherished
principle among war hawks these days:
neo-Churchillism. Its tenets are simple and
twofold: 1) recognize that Winston
Churchill has been beatified in the eyes of
the world for his courageous stand against
Adolf Hitler, even in the midst of initial op
position from his own party, and 2) invoke
Churchill whenever you undertake unilat
eral and unpopular actions, especially mili
tary operations. Call the opposition short
sighted. Call them cowards. Worst of all,
call them French. Then, obediently direct
them to read Churchill's autobiography.
Thus have several op-eds and talking
points gone since the nation began debat
ing possible war with Iraq.
Many people more knowledgeable than
me could present a laundry list of differ
ences between Europe in 1939 and the
Middle East in 2002. Suffice to say, Britain
and France engaged in a desperate, multi
lateral defensive against a military super
power on the verge of invading their re
spective homelands. Today, we discuss a
proposed unilateral offensive against a ten
uous and disgruntled military with barely
the means to harm our allies, let alone our
own soil. And let's be frank: Saddam I lus
sein, for all his egregious acts of in justice, is
no Adolf! litler. George Bush, for all his de
cisiveness, is no Winston Churchill.
Old habits do, indeed, die hard. Guess
what? So, too, do old analogies. And none
are more tired than this one.

Guest column 'twists reality 7
I read Arnold Beichman's guest column
yesterday in disbelief: Since when did The
Daily begin to reprint outdated journalism?
Remember the 1980s? Reagan, Rambo,
Grenada, Contras, Iran-gate and other
goodies (among which, helping buddy Sad
dam to fight Ayatollah Khomeini).
The anti-European sentiment in Beich
man's hawkish piece says much about the
perverse mentality of the current adminis
tration: Resisting war is evil; diplomacy
equals weakness; trying to save innocent
Iraqis from "made in USA" death is senti
mentalism; and, of course, whoever does
not agree with us is with the enemy. Some
policy. Some leaders.
Twisting reality, Beichman blames
Western Europe for its pacifism and com
mitment to human rights. Add to that its
unwillingness to be Bush's ally in covering
up the downfall of corporate America.
And yet, Beichman admits that Europe
did some good things — like Churchill,
who resisted I litler (but courted Stalin, too)
when Americans behaved as if Nazism
didn't exist. Fortunately, present-day Eu
rope knows that Saddam exists but has
been successfully contained fora decade.
Europe also dares to ask the question Be
ichman would not touch: Why did the U.S.
wage a multi-billion dollar war against Iraq
only to leave Saddam where lie had been
before? Who else refused to overthrow his
dictatorship but [the elder) George Bush?
As for Beichman's jewels of right-wing
emotionalism like "Islam vs. Western civi
lization," or "Ronald Reagan demolishing
the evil empire," or "terror-breeding
Paris," we need not answer them, only ap
preciate their aesthetic value. But we
won't spare him the implicit comparison

he makes between George Bush and Win
ston Churchill. That has to stay in memo
ry until the Hoover Institution raises its in
tellectual standards.
"We are virtually alone" may apply to
the White House today, but certainly not to
America. Never before, since the Marshall
Plan, have the people of America been so
close to Europe. Shocked and disgusted
with rampant corruption in politics and
economy, [Europe] wakes up and try to
face reality. The reality which was kept hid
den from their view by the smog of opinion
makers, who still dare continue their dis
tinctive mission. "Old habits die hard." In
deed, sir. But die they will.

War on Iraq: 'only appropriate action'
I wanted to add my comments to those
made by Joseph Fairbanks in your article
on student perspective to the American war
against Iraq and — by implication — the
war on terrorism. ("Students conflicted on
Iraq," Oct. 1.) Activists often dismiss Iraq's
links to al-Qaida, arguing they have never
been sufficiently proven. Interestingly, this
seems to be their only consideration, self
ishly and recklessly endangering the rest of
the world inasemantic argument with little
consideration to Iraq's continued history of
terrorism. Iraq's dictator has actively perse
cuted and ruthlessly murdered his own
people and citizens of other countries, fol
lowing a pattern of totalitarian disrespect
for humanity that has been no secret for
some lime. Now, as evidence corroborates
