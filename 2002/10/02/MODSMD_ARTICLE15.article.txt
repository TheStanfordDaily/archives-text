Alum: 'Old analogies die hard'
In the Oct. 1 column ("United States
finds itself alone in the fight against Sad
dam"), Arnold Beichman's selective read
ing of history evokes that most cherished
principle among war hawks these days:
neo-Churchillism. Its tenets are simple and
twofold: 1) recognize that Winston
Churchill has been beatified in the eyes of
the world for his courageous stand against
Adolf Hitler, even in the midst of initial op
position from his own party, and 2) invoke
Churchill whenever you undertake unilat
eral and unpopular actions, especially mili
tary operations. Call the opposition short
sighted. Call them cowards. Worst of all,
call them French. Then, obediently direct
them to read Churchill's autobiography.
Thus have several op-eds and talking
points gone since the nation began debat
ing possible war with Iraq.
Many people more knowledgeable than
me could present a laundry list of differ
ences between Europe in 1939 and the
Middle East in 2002. Suffice to say, Britain
and France engaged in a desperate, multi
lateral defensive against a military super
power on the verge of invading their re
spective homelands. Today, we discuss a
proposed unilateral offensive against a ten
uous and disgruntled military with barely
the means to harm our allies, let alone our
own soil. And let's be frank: Saddam I lus
sein, for all his egregious acts of in justice, is
no Adolf! litler. George Bush, for all his de
cisiveness, is no Winston Churchill.
Old habits do, indeed, die hard. Guess
what? So, too, do old analogies. And none
are more tired than this one.

Guest column 'twists reality 7
I read Arnold Beichman's guest column
yesterday in disbelief: Since when did The
Daily begin to reprint outdated journalism?
Remember the 1980s? Reagan, Rambo,
Grenada, Contras, Iran-gate and other
goodies (among which, helping buddy Sad
dam to fight Ayatollah Khomeini).
The anti-European sentiment in Beich
man's hawkish piece says much about the
perverse mentality of the current adminis
tration: Resisting war is evil; diplomacy
equals weakness; trying to save innocent
Iraqis from "made in USA" death is senti
mentalism; and, of course, whoever does
not agree with us is with the enemy. Some
policy. Some leaders.
Twisting reality, Beichman blames
Western Europe for its pacifism and com
mitment to human rights. Add to that its
unwillingness to be Bush's ally in covering
up the downfall of corporate America.
And yet, Beichman admits that Europe
did some good things — like Churchill,
who resisted I litler (but courted Stalin, too)
when Americans behaved as if Nazism
didn't exist. Fortunately, present-day Eu
rope knows that Saddam exists but has
been successfully contained fora decade.
Europe also dares to ask the question Be
ichman would not touch: Why did the U.S.
wage a multi-billion dollar war against Iraq
only to leave Saddam where lie had been
before? Who else refused to overthrow his
dictatorship but [the elder) George Bush?
As for Beichman's jewels of right-wing
emotionalism like "Islam vs. Western civi
lization," or "Ronald Reagan demolishing
the evil empire," or "terror-breeding
Paris," we need not answer them, only ap
preciate their aesthetic value. But we
won't spare him the implicit comparison

he makes between George Bush and Win
ston Churchill. That has to stay in memo
ry until the Hoover Institution raises its in
tellectual standards.
"We are virtually alone" may apply to
the White House today, but certainly not to
America. Never before, since the Marshall
Plan, have the people of America been so
close to Europe. Shocked and disgusted
with rampant corruption in politics and
economy, [Europe] wakes up and try to
face reality. The reality which was kept hid
den from their view by the smog of opinion
makers, who still dare continue their dis
tinctive mission. "Old habits die hard." In
deed, sir. But die they will.

War on Iraq: 'only appropriate action'
I wanted to add my comments to those
made by Joseph Fairbanks in your article
on student perspective to the American war
against Iraq and — by implication — the
war on terrorism. ("Students conflicted on
Iraq," Oct. 1.) Activists often dismiss Iraq's
links to al-Qaida, arguing they have never
been sufficiently proven. Interestingly, this
seems to be their only consideration, self
ishly and recklessly endangering the rest of
the world inasemantic argument with little
consideration to Iraq's continued history of
terrorism. Iraq's dictator has actively perse
cuted and ruthlessly murdered his own
people and citizens of other countries, fol
lowing a pattern of totalitarian disrespect
for humanity that has been no secret for
some lime. Now, as evidence corroborates
his efforts to build weapons of mass de
struction, some activists are content to ac
knowledge the danger and ruthlessness of
the man while still refusing to take the nec
essary moral and secure option.
It is often said that invading Iraq will
destabilize the region. To be perfectly
frank, that is exactly what the region needs.
Iraq is the first on our radar screen but by
no means the most dangerous country in
the region or the world, and in acting to
support basic human freedoms and safety
the United States is not acting unilaterally
so much as it is the only one willing to take
the proper and moral route. Saudi Arabia
persecutes Christians and refuses to let us
use our own military bases. We call them
our friends. Activists claim we don't under
stand the region's culture or society. Others
foam it is all America's fault. I would rather
not play a baseless political blame game and
instead focus on the realization that perse
cution and state-sponsored terrorism is a

terrible thing and should be stopped by
those with the conviction and resources to
do so.
Many claim we need the United Nations
for its logistic and political support, but I fail
to see the relevance of a tyrannical and in
effective organization's approval for an oth
erwise moral and justified action designed
to promote not the political aspirations of
the UN but rather basic human freedom
and security. The United Nations has
proven completely worthless in acting
proactively on human rights abuses —
they'd rather analyze statistics after the fact
or hold conferences where the worst
human rights offenders are welcomed to
the table. The United Nations is a politi
cized, overzealous and empirically ineffec
tive organization that cares very little about
actually doing what it preaches — stopping
human rights abuses and making the world
a more secure place.
Some contend America is being unilat
eral and advocating positions unfit for the
rest of the world. 1 argue that the Middle
Eastern dictators and oppressive regimes
are unfit for the rest of the world and es
pecially their own oppressed people, and
that America's future action to remove

Saddam 1 lussein from power and liberate
his people strikes me as the only action ap
propriate for those of us who truly support
and would light basic human freedom
and dignity.
WILLIAM E. HUDSON
Soplumore, International Relations is 1 History

War would be 'unnecessary'
Dr. Beichman's Oct. 1 column is indica
tive of the very disease that afflicts so many
Americans, particularly those in control of
the executive [branch of the U.S. govern
ment!. It is also the cause of Europe's in
creasing distrust of American intentions
abroad: overzealous jingoism. Ile reveals
this immediately by remarking that Ronald
Reagan was responsible for bringing down
the Soviet Union, a claim similar to saying
that the reason Rome collapsed was the in
vasion of Germanic tribes. Rather, the Ger
manic tribes benefited from trends long at
work in the Roman Empire, much in the
way that Ronald Reagan put a little more
pressure on a system already wracked by in
ternal contradictions.

Beichman sums up bis remarks by not
ing the heroic stance of Winston Churchill
in 1940 in the face of German aggression,
and comparing that to America's stance
with regard to Iraq. Besides the fact that the
Last Lion is rolling over in his grave at the
thought of being compared to Dubya, does
Beichman really expect the Stanford com
munity to believe that the threat Nazi Ger
many posed to Britain and world peace is
more than slightly similar to the threat Iraq
poses to the United States and to world
peace? Consider, in 1940 the Germans had
built the greatest war machine ever seen,
prior to the Soviets and the Americans arm
ing themselves for WWI I, and had actually
invaded most of Europe. Before that they
had been showing continuous expansionist
tendencies for almost a decade.
Iraq, on the other hand, has not at
tempted to expand beyond its borders
since 1991. They are a regional power that
does not have the technology to reach the
United States or Western Europe with con
ventional weaponry or weapons of mass
destruction.
Do they have weapons of mass destruc
tion? Are they trying to develop more? The
answer to both of these questions is an un

qualified yes. In that, they are very similar
to the United States' ally, Pakistan, and a
nation with which the United States main
tains amiable relations, India — two coun
tries that have defied international protocol
by not signing the Non-Proliferation
Treaty. The difference is, unlike the afore
mentioned countries, Iraq has not threat
ened to escalate a regional conflict to nucle
ar war. Only recently has the administra
tion even started to claim that ties exist be
tween al-Qaida and Iraq, and not a single
shred of evidence has been produced to
support that claim.
So, to answer Beichman's question as to
whether Iraq or the United Suites is a
greater threat to world peace, the answer is
undoubtedly the United States. With a
careful blend of brinkmanship and diplo
macy on the part of the rest of the world,
Iraq will remain nothing more than a re
gional power, while the United States' insis
tence on singling out Iraq from all of the
other countries with weapons of mass de
struction threatens the world with an un
necessary war.

I read Arnold Beichman's guest column
yesterday in disbelief: Since when did The
Daily begin to reprint outdated journalism?
Remember the 1980s? Reagan, Rambo,
Grenada, Contras, Iran-gate and other
goodies (among which, helping buddy Sad
dam to fight Ayatollah Khomeini).
The anti-European sentiment in Beich
man's hawkish piece says much about the
perverse mentality of the current adminis
tration: Resisting war is evil; diplomacy
equals weakness; trying to save innocent
Iraqis from "made in USA" death is senti
mentalism; and, of course, whoever does
not agree with us is with the enemy. Some
policy. Some leaders.
Twisting reality, Beichman blames
Western Europe for its pacifism and com
mitment to human rights. Add to that its
unwillingness to be Bush's ally in covering
up the downfall of corporate America.
And yet, Beichman admits that Europe
did some good things — like Churchill,
who resisted I litler (but courted Stalin, too)
when Americans behaved as if Nazism
didn't exist. Fortunately, present-day Eu
rope knows that Saddam exists but has
been successfully contained fora decade.
Europe also dares to ask the question Be
ichman would not touch: Why did the U.S.
wage a multi-billion dollar war against Iraq
only to leave Saddam where lie had been
before? Who else refused to overthrow his
dictatorship but [the elder) George Bush?
As for Beichman's jewels of right-wing
emotionalism like "Islam vs. Western civi
lization," or "Ronald Reagan demolishing
the evil empire," or "terror-breeding
Paris," we need not answer them, only ap
preciate their aesthetic value. But we
won't spare him the implicit comparison

he makes between George Bush and Win
ston Churchill. That has to stay in memo
ry until the Hoover Institution raises its in
tellectual standards.
"We are virtually alone" may apply to
the White House today, but certainly not to
America. Never before, since the Marshall
Plan, have the people of America been so
close to Europe. Shocked and disgusted
with rampant corruption in politics and
economy, [Europe] wakes up and try to
face reality. The reality which was kept hid
den from their view by the smog of opinion
makers, who still dare continue their dis
tinctive mission. "Old habits die hard." In

War on Iraq: 'only appropriate action'
I wanted to add my comments to those
made by Joseph Fairbanks in your article
on student perspective to the American war
against Iraq and — by implication — the
war on terrorism. ("Students conflicted on
Iraq," Oct. 1.) Activists often dismiss Iraq's
links to al-Qaida, arguing they have never
been sufficiently proven. Interestingly, this
seems to be their only consideration, self
ishly and recklessly endangering the rest of
the world inasemantic argument with little
consideration to Iraq's continued history of
terrorism. Iraq's dictator has actively perse
cuted and ruthlessly murdered his own
people and citizens of other countries, fol
lowing a pattern of totalitarian disrespect
for humanity that has been no secret for
some lime. Now, as evidence corroborates
his efforts to build weapons of mass de
struction, some activists are content to ac
knowledge the danger and ruthlessness of
the man while still refusing to take the nec
essary moral and secure option.
It is often said that invading Iraq will
destabilize the region. To be perfectly
frank, that is exactly what the region needs.
Iraq is the first on our radar screen but by
no means the most dangerous country in
the region or the world, and in acting to
support basic human freedoms and safety
the United States is not acting unilaterally
so much as it is the only one willing to take
the proper and moral route. Saudi Arabia
persecutes Christians and refuses to let us
use our own military bases. We call them
our friends. Activists claim we don't under
stand the region's culture or society. Others
foam it is all America's fault. I would rather
not play a baseless political blame game and
instead focus on the realization that perse
cution and state-sponsored terrorism is a

terrible thing and should be stopped by
those with the conviction and resources to
do so.
Many claim we need the United Nations
for its logistic and political support, but I fail
to see the relevance of a tyrannical and in
effective organization's approval for an oth
erwise moral and justified action designed
to promote not the political aspirations of
the UN but rather basic human freedom
and security. The United Nations has
proven completely worthless in acting
proactively on human rights abuses —
they'd rather analyze statistics after the fact
or hold conferences where the worst
human rights offenders are welcomed to
the table. The United Nations is a politi
cized, overzealous and empirically ineffec
tive organization that cares very little about
actually doing what it preaches — stopping
human rights abuses and making the world
a more secure place.
Some contend America is being unilat
eral and advocating positions unfit for the
rest of the world. 1 argue that the Middle
Eastern dictators and oppressive regimes
are unfit for the rest of the world and es
pecially their own oppressed people, and
that America's future action to remove

Saddam 1 lussein from power and liberate
his people strikes me as the only action ap
propriate for those of us who truly support
and would light basic human freedom
and dignity.
WILLIAM E. HUDSON
Soplumore, International Relations is 1 History

War would be 'unnecessary'
Dr. Beichman's Oct. 1 column is indica
tive of the very disease that afflicts so many
Americans, particularly those in control of
the executive [branch of the U.S. govern
ment!. It is also the cause of Europe's in
creasing distrust of American intentions
abroad: overzealous jingoism. Ile reveals
this immediately by remarking that Ronald
Reagan was responsible for bringing down
the Soviet Union, a claim similar to saying
that the reason Rome collapsed was the in
vasion of Germanic tribes. Rather, the Ger
manic tribes benefited from trends long at
work in the Roman Empire, much in the
way that Ronald Reagan put a little more
pressure on a system already wracked by in
ternal contradictions.

Beichman sums up bis remarks by not
ing the heroic stance of Winston Churchill
in 1940 in the face of German aggression,
and comparing that to America's stance
with regard to Iraq. Besides the fact that the
Last Lion is rolling over in his grave at the
thought of being compared to Dubya, does
Beichman really expect the Stanford com
munity to believe that the threat Nazi Ger
many posed to Britain and world peace is
more than slightly similar to the threat Iraq
poses to the United States and to world
peace? Consider, in 1940 the Germans had
built the greatest war machine ever seen,
prior to the Soviets and the Americans arm
ing themselves for WWI I, and had actually
invaded most of Europe. Before that they
had been showing continuous expansionist
tendencies for almost a decade.
Iraq, on the other hand, has not at
tempted to expand beyond its borders
since 1991. They are a regional power that
does not have the technology to reach the
United States or Western Europe with con
ventional weaponry or weapons of mass
destruction.
Do they have weapons of mass destruc
tion? Are they trying to develop more? The
answer to both of these questions is an un

qualified yes. In that, they are very similar
to the United States' ally, Pakistan, and a
nation with which the United States main
tains amiable relations, India — two coun
tries that have defied international protocol
by not signing the Non-Proliferation
Treaty. The difference is, unlike the afore
mentioned countries, Iraq has not threat
ened to escalate a regional conflict to nucle
ar war. Only recently has the administra
tion even started to claim that ties exist be
tween al-Qaida and Iraq, and not a single
shred of evidence has been produced to
support that claim.
So, to answer Beichman's question as to
whether Iraq or the United Suites is a
greater threat to world peace, the answer is
undoubtedly the United States. With a
careful blend of brinkmanship and diplo
macy on the part of the rest of the world,
Iraq will remain nothing more than a re
gional power, while the United States' insis
tence on singling out Iraq from all of the
other countries with weapons of mass de
struction threatens the world with an un
necessary war.

('Mtermiruil Slwleiil, History

In the Oct. 1 column ("United States
finds itself alone in the fight against Sad
dam"), Arnold Beichman's selective read
ing of history evokes that most cherished
principle among war hawks these days:
neo-Churchillism. Its tenets are simple and
twofold: 1) recognize that Winston

the world for his courageous stand against
Adolf Hitler, even in the midst of initial op
position from his own party, and 2) invoke
Churchill whenever you undertake unilat

sighted. Call them cowards. Worst of all,
call them French. Then, obediently direct

Guest column 'twists reality 7
I read Arnold Beichman's guest column
yesterday in disbelief: Since when did The
Daily begin to reprint outdated journalism?
Remember the 1980s? Reagan, Rambo,
Grenada, Contras, Iran-gate and other
goodies (among which, helping buddy Sad
dam to fight Ayatollah Khomeini).
The anti-European sentiment in Beich
man's hawkish piece says much about the
perverse mentality of the current adminis
tration: Resisting war is evil; diplomacy
equals weakness; trying to save innocent
Iraqis from "made in USA" death is senti
mentalism; and, of course, whoever does
not agree with us is with the enemy. Some
policy. Some leaders.
Twisting reality, Beichman blames
Western Europe for its pacifism and com
mitment to human rights. Add to that its
unwillingness to be Bush's ally in covering
up the downfall of corporate America.
And yet, Beichman admits that Europe
did some good things — like Churchill,
who resisted I litler (but courted Stalin, too)
when Americans behaved as if Nazism
didn't exist. Fortunately, present-day Eu
rope knows that Saddam exists but has
been successfully contained fora decade.
Europe also dares to ask the question Be
ichman would not touch: Why did the U.S.
wage a multi-billion dollar war against Iraq
only to leave Saddam where lie had been
before? Who else refused to overthrow his
dictatorship but [the elder) George Bush?
As for Beichman's jewels of right-wing
emotionalism like "Islam vs. Western civi
lization," or "Ronald Reagan demolishing
the evil empire," or "terror-breeding
Paris," we need not answer them, only ap
preciate their aesthetic value. But we
won't spare him the implicit comparison

he makes between George Bush and Win
ston Churchill. That has to stay in memo
ry until the Hoover Institution raises its in
tellectual standards.
"We are virtually alone" may apply to
the White House today, but certainly not to
America. Never before, since the Marshall
Plan, have the people of America been so
close to Europe. Shocked and disgusted
with rampant corruption in politics and
economy, [Europe] wakes up and try to
face reality. The reality which was kept hid
den from their view by the smog of opinion
makers, who still dare continue their dis
tinctive mission. "Old habits die hard." In
deed, sir. But die they will.

War on Iraq: 'only appropriate action'
I wanted to add my comments to those
made by Joseph Fairbanks in your article
on student perspective to the American war
against Iraq and — by implication — the
war on terrorism. ("Students conflicted on
Iraq," Oct. 1.) Activists often dismiss Iraq's
links to al-Qaida, arguing they have never
been sufficiently proven. Interestingly, this
seems to be their only consideration, self
ishly and recklessly endangering the rest of
the world inasemantic argument with little
consideration to Iraq's continued history of
terrorism. Iraq's dictator has actively perse
cuted and ruthlessly murdered his own
people and citizens of other countries, fol
lowing a pattern of totalitarian disrespect
for humanity that has been no secret for
some lime. Now, as evidence corroborates
his efforts to build weapons of mass de
struction, some activists are content to ac
knowledge the danger and ruthlessness of
the man while still refusing to take the nec
essary moral and secure option.
It is often said that invading Iraq will
destabilize the region. To be perfectly
frank, that is exactly what the region needs.
Iraq is the first on our radar screen but by
no means the most dangerous country in
the region or the world, and in acting to
support basic human freedoms and safety
the United States is not acting unilaterally
so much as it is the only one willing to take
the proper and moral route. Saudi Arabia
persecutes Christians and refuses to let us
use our own military bases. We call them
our friends. Activists claim we don't under
stand the region's culture or society. Others
foam it is all America's fault. I would rather
not play a baseless political blame game and
instead focus on the realization that perse
cution and state-sponsored terrorism is a

terrible thing and should be stopped by
those with the conviction and resources to
do so.
Many claim we need the United Nations
for its logistic and political support, but I fail
to see the relevance of a tyrannical and in
effective organization's approval for an oth
erwise moral and justified action designed
to promote not the political aspirations of
the UN but rather basic human freedom
and security. The United Nations has
proven completely worthless in acting
proactively on human rights abuses —
they'd rather analyze statistics after the fact
or hold conferences where the worst
human rights offenders are welcomed to
the table. The United Nations is a politi
cized, overzealous and empirically ineffec
tive organization that cares very little about
actually doing what it preaches — stopping
human rights abuses and making the world
a more secure place.
Some contend America is being unilat
eral and advocating positions unfit for the
rest of the world. 1 argue that the Middle
Eastern dictators and oppressive regimes
are unfit for the rest of the world and es
pecially their own oppressed people, and
that America's future action to remove

Saddam 1 lussein from power and liberate
his people strikes me as the only action ap
propriate for those of us who truly support
and would light basic human freedom
and dignity.
WILLIAM E. HUDSON
Soplumore, International Relations is 1 History

War would be 'unnecessary'
Dr. Beichman's Oct. 1 column is indica
tive of the very disease that afflicts so many
Americans, particularly those in control of
the executive [branch of the U.S. govern
ment!. It is also the cause of Europe's in
creasing distrust of American intentions
abroad: overzealous jingoism. Ile reveals
this immediately by remarking that Ronald
Reagan was responsible for bringing down
the Soviet Union, a claim similar to saying
that the reason Rome collapsed was the in
vasion of Germanic tribes. Rather, the Ger
manic tribes benefited from trends long at
work in the Roman Empire, much in the
way that Ronald Reagan put a little more
pressure on a system already wracked by in
ternal contradictions.

Beichman sums up bis remarks by not
ing the heroic stance of Winston Churchill
in 1940 in the face of German aggression,
and comparing that to America's stance
with regard to Iraq. Besides the fact that the
Last Lion is rolling over in his grave at the
thought of being compared to Dubya, does
Beichman really expect the Stanford com
munity to believe that the threat Nazi Ger
many posed to Britain and world peace is
more than slightly similar to the threat Iraq
poses to the United States and to world
peace? Consider, in 1940 the Germans had
built the greatest war machine ever seen,
prior to the Soviets and the Americans arm
ing themselves for WWI I, and had actually
invaded most of Europe. Before that they
had been showing continuous expansionist
tendencies for almost a decade.
Iraq, on the other hand, has not at
tempted to expand beyond its borders
since 1991. They are a regional power that
does not have the technology to reach the
United States or Western Europe with con
ventional weaponry or weapons of mass
destruction.
Do they have weapons of mass destruc
tion? Are they trying to develop more? The
answer to both of these questions is an un

qualified yes. In that, they are very similar
to the United States' ally, Pakistan, and a
nation with which the United States main
tains amiable relations, India — two coun
tries that have defied international protocol
by not signing the Non-Proliferation
Treaty. The difference is, unlike the afore
mentioned countries, Iraq has not threat
ened to escalate a regional conflict to nucle
ar war. Only recently has the administra
tion even started to claim that ties exist be
tween al-Qaida and Iraq, and not a single
shred of evidence has been produced to
support that claim.
So, to answer Beichman's question as to
whether Iraq or the United Suites is a
greater threat to world peace, the answer is
undoubtedly the United States. With a
careful blend of brinkmanship and diplo
macy on the part of the rest of the world,
Iraq will remain nothing more than a re
gional power, while the United States' insis
tence on singling out Iraq from all of the
other countries with weapons of mass de
struction threatens the world with an un
necessary war.
TIM MEYER
('Mtermiruil Slwleiil, History
Alum: 'Old analogies die hard'
In the Oct. 1 column ("United States
finds itself alone in the fight against Sad
dam"), Arnold Beichman's selective read
ing of history evokes that most cherished
principle among war hawks these days:
neo-Churchillism. Its tenets are simple and
twofold: 1) recognize that Winston
Churchill has been beatified in the eyes of
the world for his courageous stand against
Adolf Hitler, even in the midst of initial op
position from his own party, and 2) invoke
Churchill whenever you undertake unilat
eral and unpopular actions, especially mili
tary operations. Call the opposition short
sighted. Call them cowards. Worst of all,
call them French. Then, obediently direct
them to read Churchill's autobiography.
Thus have several op-eds and talking
points gone since the nation began debat
ing possible war with Iraq.
Many people more knowledgeable than
me could present a laundry list of differ
ences between Europe in 1939 and the
Middle East in 2002. Suffice to say, Britain
and France engaged in a desperate, multi
lateral defensive against a military super
power on the verge of invading their re
spective homelands. Today, we discuss a
proposed unilateral offensive against a ten
uous and disgruntled military with barely
the means to harm our allies, let alone our
own soil. And let's be frank: Saddam I lus
sein, for all his egregious acts of in justice, is
no Adolf! litler. George Bush, for all his de
cisiveness, is no Winston Churchill.
Old habits do, indeed, die hard. Guess
what? So, too, do old analogies. And none
are more tired than this one.
