## Bush administration's war rhetoric too black and white 
### JULIA SALZMAN GUEST COLUMNIST 
A dangerous trend in American politics
that began to emerge on Sept. 11, 2001, is
now fully exposed as we consider the poli
tics of an imminent war in Iraq. Since last
fall, the Bush administration has led the
way to posing political issues, especially re
lating to the Middle Fast, in binary terms:
one that is patriotic and pro-American,
and one that is unpatriotic and allied with
the "axis of evil."
In September, to oppose attacks in
Afghanistan was unpatriotic, un-American
and therefore unacceptable. To express
doubt that bombing Afghan villages would
achieve a more peaceful world was equiva
lent to sacrilege and disrespectful of the in
nocent victims of the Sept. 11 attacks. Now,
we are seeing the invasion of this anti-intel

lectual, monolithic* social pressure in a
meaningful discourse on the possibility of
war in Iraq.
As Bush prepares to go to war, his of
fice issues statements that are disturbing
for two reasons. First, they advocate a
unilateral use of military force that is ille
gal under international law. Second,
they claim to speak for the interests of
the American people as if those people
espoused a simple and unified body of
interests.
The proposal for military action in Iraq
is dangerous enough as it stands. But even
more dangerous is the rhetoric that the
Bush administration uses in support of its
plan: It claims to "understand" American
(and global) interests that are both pre
meditated and unaffected by discussions
with the public and with world leaders.
Bush and his administration have used

rhetorical terms such as lightness and
"wrongness" since Sept. 11, claiming to
know the "right" response to world events
and political situations, such as that in
Iraq. There is no room for ambiguity or
ecjuivocation. Ironically, this attitude of
certainty on the part of the administration
— creating a fictitious popular mandate
for unilateral and violent action — is what
has historically caused international con
flict, not resolved it.
Perhaps we should heed commentators
on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as it de
veloped in the 19405. Hannah Arendt, who
predicted inevitable turmoil resulting
from the portrayal (and accompanying ac
tion) of a completely unified Zionist posi
tion on the method and means of establish
ing a Jewish homeland, warned that "una
nimity" of political position is extremely
dangerous.

Arendt wrote, "Unanimity of opinion is
a very ominous phenomenon ... to hold
different opinions and to be aware that
other people think dilferently on the same
issue shields us from that god-like certain
ty which stops all discussion and reduces
social relationships." She continued,
for mass unanimity is not the result of
agreement, but an expression of fanaticism
and hysteria."
In her time, Arendt saw the manipula
tion of Zionist feelings by an oligarchic
elite. She observed that a diversity of opin
ions were ignored by Zionist leaders, who
manipulated Zionist solidarity into a posi
tion that divides the public into two camps:
anti-Semites vs. those who supported the
establishment of the state of Israel at any
cost.
Once such a binary has been posed,
once the public must choose between and-

Semitism and Israel, violence takes the
place of diplomacy.
Arendt observed that "in contrast to
agreement, unanimity does not stop at cer
tain well-defined objects, but spreads like
an infection into every related issue." Since
Sept. 1 l,the Bush administration has char
acterized patriotic sentiment as unanimous.
1 las this infection now spread to "our" sup
port of a war in Iraq?
There is a disturbing analogy between
the situation in 1940s Palestine and the one
developing in Iraq, where patriotism is sup
planting unilateral support of Israel, and
support of terrorism is taking the place of
anti-Semitism.
Will war now take the place of peace?
