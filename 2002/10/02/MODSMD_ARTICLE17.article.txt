## Walk-ons get crews rowin' by 
### MIA ASHTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Arrillaga's Kissick Auditorium is
packed with students â€” upwards of
00 in jeans and I-shirts, carrying heavy
hookbags and looking vaguely con
fused. To one side stand 25 more stu
dents, sweatsuit clad, standing tall,
confident and hull.
Craig Amerkhanian, director of
Stanford crew, stands belbre the for
mer group and points to the latter, stat
ing that once even these athletes were
silting iu the same Kissick seats, "won
dering, 'Who's this village idiot?' "
This is crew's annual walk-on re
< i uit meeting, which attracts large
numbers of students each year inter
ested in joining ihe team. Amerkhan
ian puts on an inspiring display of
oars, jerseys ("This is the dreaded Cal
shirt!" he exclaims) and video of
down-to-the-wire races, encouraging
those in the seats before him to join in
the lun.
11 is sc hpeil is not all smoke and mir
rors, however, as Amerkhanian ad
dresses some aspects of the student
athlete's life that may be keeping the
audience from being so optimistic.
"Everything we do is predicated to
your academic issues," Amerkhanian
reassures, intuitively sensing the ques
tion weighing on many minds. "[Par
ticipation! tends to bump your acade
mic standing up," lie says, going on to
give examples of two crew scholars
who graduated last year to go on to
1 larvard Medical School. He cites oth
ers still who claim that thei' grades

improve during the season, when they
are forced to focus and become highly
organized.
Amerkhanian, a director of a high
ly competitive Division I team, is wise
to devote so much time and energy to
recruiting walk-ons because they con
sistently compose the majority of the
teams he oversees.
In fact, the women's lightweight
crew team is entirely comprised of walk
ons. Coached by Al Acosta, the team de
pends on meetings like this one to gen
erate student interest, with the program
only in its second year of existence.
Returners from last year's squad,
such as sophomore Kristina Peterson,
are as enthusiastic and convincing as
the staff. Peterson, whose two years of
high school rowing make her one of the
few team members with previous low
ing experience, said that "it was really
exciting to be part of the first season."
Acosta finds that most of his team

has experiences like Peterson's in dif
ferent high school sports.
"Of the eight kids that made the
top eight last year, all of them but
one were varsity athletes in high
school," he explains. "Three or four
of them were state champions in
their own sport."
Not only is crew a varsity sport,
which means there is great travel at no
financial cost to the athletes, but Acos
ta also sees the team as "a good way to
balance what goes on here academi
cally," making the program attractive
even to older students.
"A fair amount of upperclassmen
come out," Acosta says, finding they
often realize, " 'Oh, I've got a grip on
things, and 1 have all this free time on
my hands.' " I he attractive features of
walking on to a team fuel the women's
lightweight crew and, for many, the
activity becomes a central part of their
Stanford identity. "Being an athlete at

Stanford is part of the whole experi
ence," Acosta says.
The coaching staff understands this
best, most of them having walked on
in college themselves.
Carrie Davis, who helped coach the
women's openweight team to sixth
place at its first appearance at nation
als last year, is one such coach.
Those who learn to row in college,
she explains, open up themselves for
coaching positions and more after
ward. "It is possible fora walk-on ath
lete to earn a scholarship, or a portion
of a scholarship," Davis notes. And as
if financial backing wasn't persuasive
enough, there are always gold medals
to be won. "There are plenty of people
who learned to row in college and row
at World Championships," Davis
adds, citing (lie example of the Cardi
nal's Sabrina Kolker, who participated

The Stanford crew teams have always relied on walk-ons to fill out their rosters. The women's lightweight crew team, shown above,
is comprised entirely of walk-on student athletes.
