## Walk-ons get crews rowin' by 
### MIA ASHTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Arrillaga's Kissick Auditorium is
packed with students — upwards of
00 in jeans and I-shirts, carrying heavy
hookbags and looking vaguely con
fused. To one side stand 25 more stu
dents, sweatsuit clad, standing tall,
confident and hull.
Craig Amerkhanian, director of
Stanford crew, stands belbre the for
mer group and points to the latter, stat
ing that once even these athletes were
silting iu the same Kissick seats, "won
dering, 'Who's this village idiot?' "
This is crew's annual walk-on re
< i uit meeting, which attracts large
numbers of students each year inter
ested in joining ihe team. Amerkhan
ian puts on an inspiring display of
oars, jerseys ("This is the dreaded Cal
shirt!" he exclaims) and video of
down-to-the-wire races, encouraging
those in the seats before him to join in
the lun.
11 is sc hpeil is not all smoke and mir
rors, however, as Amerkhanian ad
dresses some aspects of the student
athlete's life that may be keeping the
audience from being so optimistic.
"Everything we do is predicated to
your academic issues," Amerkhanian
reassures, intuitively sensing the ques
tion weighing on many minds. "[Par
ticipation! tends to bump your acade
mic standing up," lie says, going on to
give examples of two crew scholars
who graduated last year to go on to
1 larvard Medical School. He cites oth
ers still who claim that thei' grades

improve during the season, when they
are forced to focus and become highly
organized.
Amerkhanian, a director of a high
ly competitive Division I team, is wise
to devote so much time and energy to
recruiting walk-ons because they con
sistently compose the majority of the
teams he oversees.
In fact, the women's lightweight
crew team is entirely comprised of walk
ons. Coached by Al Acosta, the team de
pends on meetings like this one to gen
erate student interest, with the program
only in its second year of existence.
Returners from last year's squad,
such as sophomore Kristina Peterson,
are as enthusiastic and convincing as
the staff. Peterson, whose two years of
high school rowing make her one of the
few team members with previous low
ing experience, said that "it was really
exciting to be part of the first season."
Acosta finds that most of his team

has experiences like Peterson's in dif
ferent high school sports.
"Of the eight kids that made the
top eight last year, all of them but
one were varsity athletes in high
school," he explains. "Three or four
of them were state champions in
their own sport."
Not only is crew a varsity sport,
which means there is great travel at no
financial cost to the athletes, but Acos
ta also sees the team as "a good way to
balance what goes on here academi
cally," making the program attractive
even to older students.
"A fair amount of upperclassmen
come out," Acosta says, finding they
often realize, " 'Oh, I've got a grip on
things, and 1 have all this free time on
my hands.' " I he attractive features of
walking on to a team fuel the women's
lightweight crew and, for many, the
activity becomes a central part of their
Stanford identity. "Being an athlete at

Stanford is part of the whole experi
ence," Acosta says.
The coaching staff understands this
best, most of them having walked on
in college themselves.
Carrie Davis, who helped coach the
women's openweight team to sixth
place at its first appearance at nation
als last year, is one such coach.
Those who learn to row in college,
she explains, open up themselves for
coaching positions and more after
ward. "It is possible fora walk-on ath
lete to earn a scholarship, or a portion
of a scholarship," Davis notes. And as
if financial backing wasn't persuasive
enough, there are always gold medals
to be won. "There are plenty of people
who learned to row in college and row
at World Championships," Davis
adds, citing (lie example of the Cardi
nal's Sabrina Kolker, who participated

in the championships this past
summer.
Seniors Shaun Haase and Chris
Jones, now accomplished Stanford

rowers, also had no crew experi
ence until becoming college walk
ons. Haase reports being told by
friends during his sophomore
year, "'You're tall and strong look
ing; you should go row.'"
Jones tells a similar story. Ac
tive in track and baseball in high
school, Jones says he was drawn to

"the team aspect of the sport,"
and joined the squad his fresh
man year. In particular, Jones
recognizes crew as a sport where
effort results in noticeable im
provement.
"As hard as you're willing to
work, you'll be rewarded to that
extent," he says. In his final year

on the team, Jones explains that
when he realized he misses for
mer teammates who have gradu
ated, he also "realized 1 had made
the right choice to stay with it."
But the new recruits aren't
quite so sure. One freshman
woman there was understandably
uncertain about her rowing fu
ture and had come simply for
more information.
"I just saw the sign in White
Plaza," she said, adding that with
a background in paddling, she is
interested in a similar sport.
The meeting in Kissick Audito
rium plays to students like these,
who see the athletic, academic
and even social benefits of joining
the crew squad but have reserva
tions about participating
nonetheless. All the coaches lay
out a convincing argument, one
that emphasizes the benefits of an
athletic outlet, meeting new peo
ple. and travel.
But most encouraging is
Ainerkhanian's words on friend
ship. Because of its interdepen
dent nature, he promises "the re
lationships you foster in rowing
become tight." He invites the stu
dents before him to enter into
this atmosphere by becoming a
Stanford rower, being honest
with them about their impor
tance to the program. "Thecore,
the soul, to this team is the Stan
ford student," he tells them, "The
walk-on."

dent nature, he promises "the re

become tight." He invites the stu
dents before him to enter into
this atmosphere by becoming a
Stanford rower, being honest
with them about their impor
tance to the program. "Thecore,
the soul, to this team is the Stan
ford student," he tells them, "The
walk-on."

Arrillaga's Kissick Auditorium is
packed with students — upwards of
00 in jeans and I-shirts, carrying heavy
hookbags and looking vaguely con
fused. To one side stand 25 more stu
dents, sweatsuit clad, standing tall,
confident and hull.
Craig Amerkhanian, director of
Stanford crew, stands belbre the for

ing that once even these athletes were
silting iu the same Kissick seats, "won
dering, 'Who's this village idiot?' "
This is crew's annual walk-on re
< i uit meeting, which attracts large
numbers of students each year inter
ested in joining ihe team. Amerkhan

oars, jerseys ("This is the dreaded Cal
shirt!" he exclaims) and video of
down-to-the-wire races, encouraging
those in the seats before him to join in
the lun.
11 is sc hpeil is not all smoke and mir
rors, however, as Amerkhanian ad
dresses some aspects of the student
athlete's life that may be keeping the
audience from being so optimistic.
"Everything we do is predicated to
your academic issues," Amerkhanian
reassures, intuitively sensing the ques
tion weighing on many minds. "[Par
ticipation! tends to bump your acade
mic standing up," lie says, going on to
give examples of two crew scholars
who graduated last year to go on to
1 larvard Medical School. He cites oth
ers still who claim that thei' grades

improve during the season, when they
are forced to focus and become highly
organized.
Amerkhanian, a director of a high
ly competitive Division I team, is wise
to devote so much time and energy to
recruiting walk-ons because they con
sistently compose the majority of the
teams he oversees.
In fact, the women's lightweight
crew team is entirely comprised of walk
ons. Coached by Al Acosta, the team de
pends on meetings like this one to gen
erate student interest, with the program
only in its second year of existence.
Returners from last year's squad,
such as sophomore Kristina Peterson,
are as enthusiastic and convincing as
the staff. Peterson, whose two years of
high school rowing make her one of the
few team members with previous low
ing experience, said that "it was really
exciting to be part of the first season."
Acosta finds that most of his team

has experiences like Peterson's in dif
ferent high school sports.
"Of the eight kids that made the
top eight last year, all of them but
one were varsity athletes in high
school," he explains. "Three or four
of them were state champions in
their own sport."
Not only is crew a varsity sport,
which means there is great travel at no
financial cost to the athletes, but Acos
ta also sees the team as "a good way to
balance what goes on here academi
cally," making the program attractive
even to older students.
"A fair amount of upperclassmen
come out," Acosta says, finding they
often realize, " 'Oh, I've got a grip on
things, and 1 have all this free time on
my hands.' " I he attractive features of
walking on to a team fuel the women's
lightweight crew and, for many, the
activity becomes a central part of their
Stanford identity. "Being an athlete at

Stanford is part of the whole experi
ence," Acosta says.
The coaching staff understands this
best, most of them having walked on
in college themselves.
Carrie Davis, who helped coach the
women's openweight team to sixth
place at its first appearance at nation
als last year, is one such coach.
Those who learn to row in college,
she explains, open up themselves for
coaching positions and more after
ward. "It is possible fora walk-on ath
lete to earn a scholarship, or a portion
of a scholarship," Davis notes. And as
if financial backing wasn't persuasive
enough, there are always gold medals
to be won. "There are plenty of people
who learned to row in college and row
at World Championships," Davis
adds, citing (lie example of the Cardi
nal's Sabrina Kolker, who participated

in the championships this past
summer.
Seniors Shaun Haase and Chris
Jones, now accomplished Stanford

rowers, also had no crew experi
ence until becoming college walk
ons. Haase reports being told by
friends during his sophomore
year, "'You're tall and strong look
ing; you should go row.'"
Jones tells a similar story. Ac
tive in track and baseball in high
school, Jones says he was drawn to

"the team aspect of the sport,"
and joined the squad his fresh
man year. In particular, Jones
recognizes crew as a sport where
effort results in noticeable im
provement.
"As hard as you're willing to
work, you'll be rewarded to that
extent," he says. In his final year

on the team, Jones explains that
when he realized he misses for
mer teammates who have gradu
ated, he also "realized 1 had made
the right choice to stay with it."
But the new recruits aren't
quite so sure. One freshman
woman there was understandably
uncertain about her rowing fu
ture and had come simply for
more information.
"I just saw the sign in White
Plaza," she said, adding that with
a background in paddling, she is
interested in a similar sport.
The meeting in Kissick Audito
rium plays to students like these,
who see the athletic, academic
and even social benefits of joining
the crew squad but have reserva
tions about participating
nonetheless. All the coaches lay
out a convincing argument, one
that emphasizes the benefits of an
athletic outlet, meeting new peo
ple. and travel.
