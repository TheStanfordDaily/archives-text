# Stars alligned against men over weekend
## 
### MATT BABIN STAFF COLUMNIST 
I'm convinced it was something cosmic. I know our
men's soccer team is still the best in the country. And
I know our l()otball team is better than it looked.
And I don't know what happened to men's water polo

on Saturday. So how to explain three
surprising defeats for the men's teams
when the women's teams went unde
feated this weekend? 1 took an infor
mal sui*vey and came up with the fol
lowing responses:
"llie stars."
"The Yankees. They're going to
buy the World Series again, and they
exemplify everything that's wrong

with sports, even sports that they have no |><>ssible inter
action with. 1 jke Stanford."
"Anna Kournikova doesn't win, either, but no one
t ares about that."
"Too much sloshball on campus."
"Seven turnovers sealed the fcxuball game, I'd say."
"Not enough sloshball on campus."
"I say you blame it on dry Orientation."
"Where is pub night this week? Last week was damn
far away."
"Has anyone already said that there's not enough
sloshball on campus?"
"The answer is elementary. The other teams scored
more points." (I'm not sure this guy actually goes to
school here).
"I think they were all up past curfew watching rivet
ing NHL preseason games on ESPN2. Hie Montreal
Canadians are undefeated, eh?"
"I think they just wanted to make things interesting
for the rest of the season, let the other teams catch up."
"Does this mean that they'll be put on offensive pro
bation for serving up t(x> many touchdowns against San


Matt Babin
Jose State without checking IDs?
Probation sucks. Who's going to
throw the parties now?"
"Whatever, we still have better
weather and cuter girls than Ari
zona State. Wait a minute!"
"It's because 1 got a crappy draw
number and ended up in francos.
Everything bad in the world can be
blamed on my draw number."
"We lost? Sorry, 1 wasn't paying
attention. I've been too busy mov
ing into the two-room double 1 just
walked onto alter being unassigned.
I love the draw."
"We had a football game this
weekend? After I had been on c am
pus since Orientation and still
hadn't heard about a home game, I
thought we lost our team or some
thing. I guess 112 was wrong."
"Fembots." (Yes, one member of
my drawgroup is convinced that
Arizona State and Tulsa imported
Fembots to seduce and then betray
our soccer, water polo and football
players, stealing their hearts and
athletic ability. 1 just think he's just
seen Austin Powers a few too many
times. That didn't stop him from of
fering to examine every girl on cam

pus, to make sure she wasn't smug
gling machine guns in her funbags
lor "safety's sake," he said.)
()ther ideas include that the !<>ot
ball game was merely an experi
ment in role-playing writ large,
where Arizona State wanted to lx j
Stanford, and somehow convinced
the Cardinal to play the role of San
Jose State. Bad trade.
Now, even with the football
team getting undressed by the Sun
Devils last weekend (no word yet
on whether Fenibots were involved
oi" not), it has the chance lor sweet
redemption against Notre Dame
this weekend.
As if there wasn't enough
buildup already lor the rematch
with Tyrone. Now we have the
matchup of one team on the return
to dominance, rising in the polls —
even ranked No. 1 in the nation by
the New York limes computer poll
(just one ol the many reasons why I
don't really like that newspaper).
And in the other corner, we have a
team trying to get back into the sea
son after a heartbreaking opening
loss, followed by a 63-26 win, fol
lowed by a 65-24 loss. Where exact
ly that leaves us is anybody's guess.
Needless to say the Card needs to
take this game in South Bend, be
cause a I -3 mark going into a tough
conference schedule isn't exactly the

best place to be.
As for soccer, the Cardinal men
shook off the cosmic shift of Friday
night in time for Sunday's game
against rival Santa (Ham, returning
to the form expected of the nation's
top-ranked team to take away the
game in the second half. Maybe ii
was the wake-up call the team need
ed, a blessing in disguise before con
ference play begins.
And water polo took out the
frustration of its Pepperdine loss
on Loyola Marymount the next
day, running up the score on the
Lions to show that the team is still
"all man."
Thankfully, all three teams get
a chance for redemption again
this weekend. Men's soccer be
gins its climb back to the top
Thursday night against San Jose
State while the football team rolls
into South Bend to pay Tyrone
and his new boys a visit. And
water polo gets things started
against Pacific tonight.
1 can already feel the stars re
aligning themselves.

top-ranked team to take away the
game in the second half. Maybe ii
was the wake-up call the team need
ed, a blessing in disguise before con
ference play begins.
And water polo took out the
frustration of its Pepperdine loss
on Loyola Marymount the next
day, running up the score on the
Lions to show that the team is still
"all man."
Thankfully, all three teams get
a chance for redemption again
this weekend. Men's soccer be
gins its climb back to the top
Thursday night against San Jose
State while the football team rolls
into South Bend to pay Tyrone
and his new boys a visit. And
water polo gets things started
against Pacific tonight.
1 can already feel the stars re
aligning themselves.

I'm convinced it was something cosmic. I know our
men's soccer team is still the best in the country. And
I know our l()otball team is better than it looked.
And I don't know what happened to men's water polo

on Saturday. So how to explain three
surprising defeats for the men's teams
when the women's teams went unde
feated this weekend? 1 took an infor
mal sui*vey and came up with the fol
lowing responses:
"llie stars."
"The Yankees. They're going to
buy the World Series again, and they
exemplify everything that's wrong

with sports, even sports that they have no |><>ssible inter
action with. 1 jke Stanford."
"Anna Kournikova doesn't win, either, but no one
t ares about that."
"Too much sloshball on campus."
"Seven turnovers sealed the fcxuball game, I'd say."
"Not enough sloshball on campus."
"I say you blame it on dry Orientation."
"Where is pub night this week? Last week was damn
far away."
"Has anyone already said that there's not enough
sloshball on campus?"
"The answer is elementary. The other teams scored
more points." (I'm not sure this guy actually goes to
school here).
"I think they were all up past curfew watching rivet
ing NHL preseason games on ESPN2. Hie Montreal
Canadians are undefeated, eh?"
"I think they just wanted to make things interesting
for the rest of the season, let the other teams catch up."
"Does this mean that they'll be put on offensive pro
bation for serving up t(x> many touchdowns against San


Matt Babin
Jose State without checking IDs?
Probation sucks. Who's going to
throw the parties now?"
"Whatever, we still have better
weather and cuter girls than Ari
zona State. Wait a minute!"
"It's because 1 got a crappy draw
number and ended up in francos.
Everything bad in the world can be
blamed on my draw number."
"We lost? Sorry, 1 wasn't paying
attention. I've been too busy mov
ing into the two-room double 1 just
walked onto alter being unassigned.
I love the draw."
"We had a football game this
weekend? After I had been on c am
pus since Orientation and still
hadn't heard about a home game, I
thought we lost our team or some
thing. I guess 112 was wrong."
"Fembots." (Yes, one member of
my drawgroup is convinced that
Arizona State and Tulsa imported
Fembots to seduce and then betray
our soccer, water polo and football
players, stealing their hearts and
athletic ability. 1 just think he's just
seen Austin Powers a few too many
times. That didn't stop him from of
fering to examine every girl on cam

pus, to make sure she wasn't smug
gling machine guns in her funbags
lor "safety's sake," he said.)
()ther ideas include that the !<>ot
ball game was merely an experi
ment in role-playing writ large,
where Arizona State wanted to lx j
Stanford, and somehow convinced
the Cardinal to play the role of San
Jose State. Bad trade.
Now, even with the football
team getting undressed by the Sun
Devils last weekend (no word yet
on whether Fenibots were involved
oi" not), it has the chance lor sweet
redemption against Notre Dame
this weekend.
As if there wasn't enough
buildup already lor the rematch
with Tyrone. Now we have the
matchup of one team on the return
to dominance, rising in the polls —
even ranked No. 1 in the nation by
the New York limes computer poll
(just one ol the many reasons why I
don't really like that newspaper).
And in the other corner, we have a
team trying to get back into the sea
son after a heartbreaking opening
loss, followed by a 63-26 win, fol
lowed by a 65-24 loss. Where exact
ly that leaves us is anybody's guess.
Needless to say the Card needs to
take this game in South Bend, be
cause a I -3 mark going into a tough
conference schedule isn't exactly the

best place to be.
As for soccer, the Cardinal men
shook off the cosmic shift of Friday
night in time for Sunday's game
against rival Santa (Ham, returning
to the form expected of the nation's
top-ranked team to take away the
game in the second half. Maybe ii
was the wake-up call the team need
ed, a blessing in disguise before con
ference play begins.
