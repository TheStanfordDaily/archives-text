### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Heading into its first tournament of the 2002-2003
season, two tilings were certain for the Stanford men's
goU team.
First, the team would be starting the year on a big-time
stage. I he Windon took place in Golf, 111., which has also
been the site of the U.S. Amateur Championships and
the inaugural Western Open.

Second, the Cardinal would be facing a big-time field.
No. <S ()klahoma State was talented and coming off a sec
ond-place finish the week before. Northwestern's Tom
Johnson had finished ninth overall the week before and
led the Wildcats on their home turf.
I lie only question going into Monday was how the
Cardinal would perform under such demanding cir
cumstances so early in the year.
Alter !W> holes, there could be little doubt in anyone's
mind that the team was ready to play. While windy con
ditions hampered the rest of the field, the Cardinal hung
tough and lose up toward the top of the leaderboard.
As expected, Jim Seki and Ron Won led the Stanford
squad with excellent individual performances. Seki, re-

turning for his senior season, is
the reigning Pacific-10 Confer
ence champion and seemed to
pic k up right where he left off at
the end of last year. He followed
his opening-round 70 with a sec
ond-round 71, settling into sec
ond place, a single stroke behind
Northwestern's Johnson.
Won, also a senior, quickly
joined Seki at the top with an even
par 144 (74-70), plac ing him in a
tie for ninth overall.
As a team, the Cardinal shot a
pair of 2915, moving into third
place for the team competition.
Northwestern, with an impressive
573, led the event over Duke after
two rounds.
"It was a pretty exciting way to
start the season," said Cardinal
coach Jeff Mitchell. "It was a very
windy day today, and the team
held it together. That should give
us a lot of confidence."
After working hard to position
itself on the first day, the Stanford
team played anot her solid I<S holes
yesterday to complete an excellent
season opener.
Seki followed up a good Mon

day performance with more of the
same yesterday, carding a bl
under-par 69. It was good
enough to tie him for second
place overall with Northwestern's
Scott 1 larrington.
For Cardinal junior Blake
Mastalir, yesterday was an event
ful day. Beginning his round in
16th place overall, he too shot 69,
vaulting over several names into a
tie for sixth.
The Cardinal's assault on the
top of the leaderboard continued
with Won, who finished in a tie lor
15th at 219 lor the event. Senior
(leorge Downing finished in a tie
lor 51st with a 233, while freshman
teammate Kyle Gentry, playing in
his first collegiate tournament, tied
for 65th.
In the team competition, the
Cardinal's final round 294 secured
a third-place finish, just three
strokes behind Duke (873).
Despite the excellent play of the
Stanford men, the tournament be
longed to Northwestern in more
than one way. Not only did the
Wildcats host the event, they dom
inated it from start to finish.
Northwestern's Johnson played
well in the first two rounds to lead
Seki by a stroke, but he turned up
his play on the final lcS, firing a 6-
under-par 66, en-route to a 206

lor the tournament and a four
shot victory.
Johnson's final round fireworks
proved to be a microcosm of the
entire Wildcat team's perfor
mance. An incredible 13-under
par final round propelled North
western to a landslide victory in its
own event. Three of the top five in
dividual scores came from the tour
nament hosts.
Nonetheless, the Stanford
team succeeded in starting the
season strong.
Given the outstanding field, the
Cardinal's third place showing is
remarkable in and of itself. Howev
er, it is particularly impressive
given the team's sluggish sun t last
season. A last-place finish at the
I lusky Invitational a year ago sent
the Cardinal stumbling into its
schedule.
Although the real meat of tilt
season won't arrive until spring,
the Cardinal should certainly take
encouragement from this weeks
result as it prepares for its upcom
ing tournaments.
The team will now return to the
hospitable California climate fora
lengthy stretch of time. Its next
lour tournaments, including the
Nelson Invitational at the Stanford
Goll Course starting Oct. 25, will
take place in the Golden State.
