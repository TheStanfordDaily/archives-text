The Stanford sailing team may still have
been shaking some of the dust off its sails,
but an early third-place showing amid
some tough competition this weekend got
the team's season off to a solid start.

No. 10 Stanford, along with seven other
Pacific Coast schools, sailed at the Sloop
Championships in Newport Beach, Calif.,
this past weekend. Senior skipper Matt
Hooks, along with his crew of sophomore
Jeff Allen and freshman Brian Haines,
qualified for the finals, leading Stanford to
a third-place finish with 28 points.
No. 8 Southern California won the re
gatta handily, taking first in six of the
seven races, thereby guaranteeing the
team a berth at the Intercollegiate Sailing
Association Sloop Nationals. UC-lrvine
placed second but was still far behind,
earning a total of 21 points to USC's 14.
I he Stanford team struggled in its indi
vidual races, taking a sixth and third place
finish on Saturday. A disappointing acci

dental foul in the fourth race resulted in a
fourth-place finish in what would have
otherwise been a second-place showing.
On Sunday, the team placed lourth twice
and fifth once in the final three races.
In spite of a frustrating showing at the
PCC Sloops, the sailing program remains
strong and will soon send sailors to the Sin
glehanded Pacific Coast Championships.
Three Stanford women will compete at
the Women's Singlehanded PCCs, hosted
by California at San Francisco's Treasure
Island on Oct. 4. The top two women at
the regatta will compete at the ICSA Na
tionals, where last year junior Ashley
Frush finished 13th. Classmate Li/Shear
er, who placed 21 st at the Women's World
Championships, is also looking to earn a
berth at this year's nationals.
Allen, Haines, sophomore Andy Mesh
er and senior Dave Kenny will also partic
ipate in the Men's Singlehanded PCCs on
Oct. 5 at the same location. Like the
women, the top two men's finishers will
compete at nationals.
In the past, Stanford has made im
pressive showings at this event, with
Kenny winning the PCC Singlehandeds
back to back in 2000 and 2001. Brian
Lake, a Collegiate Ail-American out of
Hawaii, is expected to provide
difficult competition in the races.
Stanford's next home regatta
is fast approaching, as the Annu
al Bryson's Women's Intersec

tional will take place Oct. 5 and
Oct. ft. Reigning A-division
champions Jen Porter, Jessie
Duncan, Ashley Frush and Shadi
Mehraien — in addition to B-di
vision competitors Liz Shearer,
Margia Corner and Liz Rountree
— will participate in the event,
hosted at the Cardinal's sailing
center in Redwood City.
