(AP) — Notre Dame quarterback Carlyle
Holiday can pass despite an injury to his non
throwing shoulder. Now the question is: Clan
he play?
Coach Tyrone Willingham wasn't ready to
provide an answer and Holiday wasn't available
to give an answer Tuesday because he had a
doctor's appointment alter practice.
"It is still week to week, we may even look at
it as day to day," Willingham said.
Willingham was encouraged to see Holi
day no longer needed a sling and was doing
some drills.
"That means he's a step closer," Willingham
said. " That's a good feeling."
Holiday was injured when he landed awk
wardly on the shoulder Sept. 21 against Michi

gan State. Backup Pat Dillingham, a former
walk-on, replaced I loliday and guided the
ninth-ranked Irish to the victory, throwing a
short pass to Arnaz Battle who turned it into a
60-yard touchdown with 1:45 left.
During the 20 minutes of practice reporters
were allowed to watch Tuesday, Holiday took
only three snaps from center while the other
quarterbacks took repeated snaps. He threw
more than a do/en passes, but held his left arm
close to his side and moved it little while run
ning and stretching. 1 le sat out while the other
quarterbacks played catch.
"I le did some of the drills — more than we
anticipated that lie would do," offensive coordi
nator Bill Diedrick said.
Dillingham «aid he is preparing for Satur

(lay's game against Stanford as though he
will start.
" That's the only way I 'm going to be ready in
my mind is to say that I'm starting," Dillingham
said. "Whether Carlyle is ready or not, I have to
be mentally ready."
The week off allowed Irish coaches to run
over the basics with Dillingham and get him
more work. Died rick said.
"We went back like we were in training
camp,"he said.
Died rick said the team likely will make a pre
liminary decision Thursday evening on who
the starter will be, but "if it's close, it could be a
kickoff decision."
Willingham said he won't be rushed into
making a decision until he has to.
"So if it's two minutes before the ballgame, if
that's how much time we need to make the right
decision, then we'll take it to that time," he said.
Tackle Jordan Black said he expects Holiday
to play against Stanford, the team that Willing
ham coached before taking over at Notre Dame
this year.
"He says he's going to be able to play, so I be

lieve he's going to be able to play," Black said.
"If something happens where he can't, I've got
confidence in Dillingham as well."
Farmer out for Arizona
A knee injury will sideline Clarence Farmer,
the leading rusher in the Pac-10 last season, for
Arizona's conference opener, throwing open
the tailback spot to Mike Bell, a freshman who
scored his first college touchdown on a 14-yard
run against North Texas on Saturday.
Coach John Mackovic said Monday that
Farmer will miss at least three weeks after hav
ing surgery to repair cartilage damage in his
left knee. He hurt the joint during the final

drive of Arizona's 14-9 victory over North
Texas on Saturday.
That means Bell will make a big-time debut:
The eighth-ranked Oregon Ducks visit Arizona
Stadium this weekend, and the timing couldn't
be worse.
Farmer is among nearly a dozen players
Arizona has listed as questionable or out for
the game.
Besides Farmer, the Wildcats are also
minus redshirt freshman tailback Gainus
Scott, who is out with an ankle injury for up to
six weeks. Lance Briggs, the Wildcats' leading
tackier, is questionable against Oregon with
an ankle injury.
