# Theme house lacks planned immersion

### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Residents at Yost House in
Governor's Corner this year will
not have the complete language
immersion experience that they
had expected.
Linda Koski, a residential fel
low for Yost House, explained
how Spanish was intended to be
fully incorporated into every as
pect of house life.
"We were going to be a Spanish
immersion house, with all the resi
dents speaking Spanish," Koski
said. "We wanted Spanish spoken
in all of the public areas."
To facilitate such a high con
centration of fluent or near-flu
ent Spanish speakers, Koski said
that she granted priority status
to numerous students who
passed the dorm's language pro
ficiency requirement.
"We approved more students
who met the language require
ments to live in an immersion
house than this residence could
even hold," Koski said.

However, Koski's efforts did
not have the intended result of es
tablishing a pool of completely flu
ent residents.
"Other non-Spanish speakers
were admitted, while many of the
students I granted priority to were
not," Koski said.
The disappointment of the Yost
House staff and residents could be
in part due to the current draw
rules and regulations, according
to Todd Benson, the director of
Housing Assignment Services.
"A priority essentially acts as a
trump â€” students with a worse
draw number can be assigned to a
house ahead of students with a bet
ter draw number if they have a pri
ority to that house," Benson said.
"There is one exception to this
rule however, which is stu
dents cannot use their priority to
obtain housing if their draw num
ber by itself was not good enough
to get them assigned somewhere
[at all]."
While this policy protects non

Signs in Spanish decorate a hallway in Yost. The house, which was original
ly meant to be Spanish-immersion, will still be Spanish-themed, although the
language will not be spoken as much as staff members had planned.
