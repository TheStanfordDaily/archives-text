# Theme house lacks planned immersion
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Residents at Yost House in
Governor's Corner this year will
not have the complete language
immersion experience that they
had expected.
Linda Koski, a residential fel
low for Yost House, explained
how Spanish was intended to be
fully incorporated into every as
pect of house life.
"We were going to be a Spanish
immersion house, with all the resi
dents speaking Spanish," Koski
said. "We wanted Spanish spoken
in all of the public areas."
To facilitate such a high con
centration of fluent or near-flu
ent Spanish speakers, Koski said
that she granted priority status
to numerous students who
passed the dorm's language pro
ficiency requirement.
"We approved more students
who met the language require
ments to live in an immersion
house than this residence could
even hold," Koski said.

However, Koski's efforts did
not have the intended result of es
tablishing a pool of completely flu
ent residents.
"Other non-Spanish speakers
were admitted, while many of the
students I granted priority to were
not," Koski said.
The disappointment of the Yost
House staff and residents could be
in part due to the current draw
rules and regulations, according
to Todd Benson, the director of
Housing Assignment Services.
"A priority essentially acts as a
trump — students with a worse
draw number can be assigned to a
house ahead of students with a bet
ter draw number if they have a pri
ority to that house," Benson said.
"There is one exception to this
rule however, which is stu
dents cannot use their priority to
obtain housing if their draw num
ber by itself was not good enough
to get them assigned somewhere
[at all]."
While this policy protects non

language will not be spoken as much as staff members had planned.
priority students with low num
bers who would be otherwise
bumped from University housing
altogether, those trying to estab
lish language-based theme houses
feel that the policy compromises
the immersion atmosphere with
in a dorm.
"The issue for me is that stu
dents who want to use a foreign
language actively while on cam
pus should be accommodated in
the language and culture houses
that we have," said Elizabeth
Bernhardt, director of the Lan
guage Center. "I believe that the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies'[l99B-1999] was quite
clear on this point in its renewed
support of the language and cul
ture theme houses."
Bernhardt believes that Yost
had the potential to fulfill the
needs of the students who wished
to be immersed in a Spanish
speaking residence.
"The Spanish Language House
was specifically structured to pro
vide a language immersion envi
ronment," Bernhardt said. "It is
an incredible disappointment that
immersion in Spanish simply can
not happen under the current
rules and conditions."
Benson discussed some ways
that the immersion issues could be
remedied to accommodate such
immersion houses.
"The alternative . . . would be
to allow students who obtain prior
ities to the Language and Culture
theme houses to receive an assign
ment to those houses regardless of

their draw numbers," Benson said.
"We could certainly do this, but it
would mean that there would be
other students — with better draw
numbers — who would now not
receive housing in the first round
of the draw."
Allowing students — whose
draw numbers would have been
low enough to oust them fi om the
first round of the draw — to have
on-campus housing simply be
cause of dorm priority is incongru
ous with I lousing Assignment Ser
vices' values, Benson stated.
"This contradicts our most im
portant principle in running the
draw, which is equity," Benson
said. "We do not believe it's fair for
students who may have very bad
draw numbers, but who speak a
language and have a priority to a
language and culture theme
house, to deny someone else hous
ing in the draw just because the
first group of students happens to
speak a particular language."
Benson also added that, accord
ing to his office, not enough stu
dents with priority had applied for
Yost to fill the house with fluent
Spanish speakers in the first place.
"There were some students as
signed who didn't speak the lan
guage," Benson said. "But that was
because there weren't enough stu
dents who'd applied for and re
ceived the priority."
Despite the fact that Yost will
not be able to offer a complete im
mersion experience, the staff and
residents still have expressed en
thusiasm for the possibilities that
the upcoming year has to offer.
"It is not really an immersion
dorm like it should have been,"
said Anne Diaz, a senior and Yost
resident assistant, "but people

seem to be really open to the
theme, are excited about trying to
learn Spanish and are coming to
the activities even if they don't
speak the language."
Koski explained that immer
sion houses, such as what Yost at
tempted to be this year, are by no
means a new phenomenon.
"Language immersion hous
es are found in many universi
ties across the country," Koski
said. "Immersion houses are a
way of teaching language and
supplementing the classroom
experience."
Dan Jacobs, a senior and
Yost house manager, added
that (lie immersion experience
is not only intended to be a
scholastic adventure.
"It is a house where people
want to live," Jacobs said. "We
don't want to make it too academ
ic. We have the theme, and we
want it to be Spanish, but we also
make it fun."
To this end, the dorm has
planned a number of cultural
outings.
"We are going to salsa dancing
in Mountain View and to see a
Spanish movie," Diaz said. "We
plan to hold themed activities
and parties."
While the dorm staff plans to try
and seek full immersion in the fu
ture, Diaz felt this year still has a lot
to offer in terms of exploring the
Spanish language.
"We had a Spanish table where
people could speak in Spanish for
a meal," Diaz said. "It has been fun
so far."
Previously, the dorm had been
designated as a theme dorm for
students majoring or interested in
human biology.

and seek full immersion in the fu
ture, Diaz felt this year still has a lot
to offer in terms of exploring the
Spanish language.
"We had a Spanish table where
people could speak in Spanish for
a meal," Diaz said. "It has been fun
so far."
Previously, the dorm had been
designated as a theme dorm for
students majoring or interested in
human biology.
Residents at Yost House in
Governor's Corner this year will
not have the complete language
immersion experience that they
had expected.
Linda Koski, a residential fel
low for Yost House, explained
how Spanish was intended to be
fully incorporated into every as
pect of house life.
"We were going to be a Spanish
immersion house, with all the resi
dents speaking Spanish," Koski
said. "We wanted Spanish spoken
in all of the public areas."
To facilitate such a high con
centration of fluent or near-flu
ent Spanish speakers, Koski said
that she granted priority status
to numerous students who
passed the dorm's language pro
ficiency requirement.
"We approved more students
who met the language require
ments to live in an immersion
house than this residence could
even hold," Koski said.

However, Koski's efforts did
not have the intended result of es
tablishing a pool of completely flu
ent residents.
"Other non-Spanish speakers
were admitted, while many of the
students I granted priority to were
not," Koski said.
The disappointment of the Yost
House staff and residents could be
in part due to the current draw
rules and regulations, according
to Todd Benson, the director of
Housing Assignment Services.
"A priority essentially acts as a
trump — students with a worse
draw number can be assigned to a
house ahead of students with a bet
ter draw number if they have a pri
ority to that house," Benson said.
"There is one exception to this
rule however, which is stu
dents cannot use their priority to
obtain housing if their draw num
ber by itself was not good enough
to get them assigned somewhere
[at all]."
While this policy protects non

language will not be spoken as much as staff members had planned.
priority students with low num
bers who would be otherwise
bumped from University housing
altogether, those trying to estab
lish language-based theme houses
feel that the policy compromises
the immersion atmosphere with
in a dorm.
"The issue for me is that stu
dents who want to use a foreign
language actively while on cam
pus should be accommodated in
the language and culture houses
that we have," said Elizabeth
Bernhardt, director of the Lan
guage Center. "I believe that the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies'[l99B-1999] was quite
clear on this point in its renewed
support of the language and cul
ture theme houses."
Bernhardt believes that Yost
had the potential to fulfill the
needs of the students who wished
to be immersed in a Spanish
speaking residence.
"The Spanish Language House
was specifically structured to pro
vide a language immersion envi
ronment," Bernhardt said. "It is
an incredible disappointment that
immersion in Spanish simply can
not happen under the current
rules and conditions."
Benson discussed some ways
that the immersion issues could be
remedied to accommodate such
immersion houses.
"The alternative . . . would be
to allow students who obtain prior
ities to the Language and Culture
theme houses to receive an assign
ment to those houses regardless of

their draw numbers," Benson said.
"We could certainly do this, but it
would mean that there would be
other students — with better draw
numbers — who would now not
receive housing in the first round
of the draw."
Allowing students — whose
draw numbers would have been
low enough to oust them fi om the
first round of the draw — to have
on-campus housing simply be
cause of dorm priority is incongru
ous with I lousing Assignment Ser
vices' values, Benson stated.
"This contradicts our most im
portant principle in running the
draw, which is equity," Benson
said. "We do not believe it's fair for
students who may have very bad
draw numbers, but who speak a
language and have a priority to a
language and culture theme
house, to deny someone else hous
ing in the draw just because the
first group of students happens to
speak a particular language."
Benson also added that, accord
ing to his office, not enough stu
dents with priority had applied for
Yost to fill the house with fluent
Spanish speakers in the first place.
"There were some students as
signed who didn't speak the lan
guage," Benson said. "But that was
because there weren't enough stu
dents who'd applied for and re
ceived the priority."
Despite the fact that Yost will
not be able to offer a complete im
mersion experience, the staff and
residents still have expressed en
thusiasm for the possibilities that
the upcoming year has to offer.
"It is not really an immersion
dorm like it should have been,"
said Anne Diaz, a senior and Yost
resident assistant, "but people

seem to be really open to the
theme, are excited about trying to
learn Spanish and are coming to
the activities even if they don't
speak the language."
Koski explained that immer
sion houses, such as what Yost at
tempted to be this year, are by no
means a new phenomenon.
"Language immersion hous
es are found in many universi
ties across the country," Koski
said. "Immersion houses are a
way of teaching language and
supplementing the classroom
experience."
Dan Jacobs, a senior and
Yost house manager, added
that (lie immersion experience
is not only intended to be a
scholastic adventure.
"It is a house where people
want to live," Jacobs said. "We
don't want to make it too academ
ic. We have the theme, and we
want it to be Spanish, but we also
make it fun."
To this end, the dorm has
planned a number of cultural
outings.
"We are going to salsa dancing
in Mountain View and to see a
Spanish movie," Diaz said. "We
plan to hold themed activities
and parties."
While the dorm staff plans to try
