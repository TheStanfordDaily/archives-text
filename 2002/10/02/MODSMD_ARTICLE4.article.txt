# President's Scholars program to stop
## 
### ELIZABETH MADJLESSI STAFF WRITER 
The University will not offer the distinc
tion of President's Scholar to next year's
freshmen and may discontinue the pro
gram permanently.
Dean of Admission and Financial Aid Robin
Mamlet explained that the Office of Under
graduate Admission has "become increasingly
concerned that what has been a terrific pro
gram may have served its purpose, and that it
may be time to try something else.
"We'll watch how this goes with the Class of
2007, and then make a determination as to
what to do," Mamlet said.
The primary objective of Stanford's Presi
dent's Scholars program has been to recog
nize those students whose high school experi
ence and interests suggest they are ready to
undertake an undergraduate research pro
gram beginning in the freshman year.
"It gives those students who are prepared
to jump into a serious research project from
their first days on campus the opportunity to
do so," Mamlet said.
Students are drawn from both tfie pool of

Early Decision and Regular Review admits.
On average, approximately 200 students are
selected. Ninety-two members of the current
freshman class are President's Scholars.
This program was particularly an incentive
for Regular Review applicants to enroll.
"Naturally, we hoped that students admit
ted [in] Regular Review would consider Stan
ford seriously among their college options
when comparing research opportunities that
might be available to them here and at our
peer institutions," Mamlet said.
Laura Sel/.nick, associate director for Un
dergraduate Research Programs, works with
President's Scholars to develop their projects
once they are accepted.
"All students walk into Stanford equal,"
Selznick said. "It is a misconception that stu
dents are given a check as they drive up to
Palm Drive, but the reality is that President's
Scholars have to find faculty members to
help them, document receipts for their ex
penditures and make reports of what they
liave done."
Junior Stephanie Dee, a President's
Scholar of the Class of 2004 said she enjoyed
the program.

"It made all ils scholars feel special, accom
plished and capable of anything," she said.
The typical format for program partici
pants is to engage in some sort of research, fol
lowed by some sort of trip and finally to create
a research paper.
Dee described her project as a comprehen
sive look at one of her favorite books, the Scar
let Pimpernel.
" The plan was to go to France and England
to visit places in the book, as well as find ob
scure books and references on and about the
book that are not commonly available in book
stores,"she said.
The Admissions Office has seen a variety of
responses among students selected for this
program.
"Several students each year have been de
lighted to be named President's Scholars and
have thrived in this program at Stanford,"
Mamlet said. "Other [students] have read this
designation as a sign that they were one of our
top academic admits and have opted to go
where the message was that all admits were
equally spectacular."
