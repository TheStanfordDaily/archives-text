# 'Bubble' group schedules talks

### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Walk through the halls of a Stanford residence and
try to find a conversation about current events. Ac
cording to some students, such an effort would be fu
tile, thanks to the proverbial "Stanford bubble" — the
insular mindset that allegedly characterizes the envi
ronment on the Farm.
Frustrated by a lack of knowledge about what's
going on outside Campus Drive and inspired by dis
cussions following a Sophomore College panel, seven
girls have teamed up to create a new campus group to
help students inform themselves about domestic and
foreign affairs.
The group, called Bursting the Bubble, is cen
tered around monthly panels where faculty from
different disciplines and with diverse political
views will deliver talks on a specific topic. After-

Bubble meeting in Tresidder Union.
wards, the speakers and students
will discuss the issue, using the
information and opinions from
the faculty as a springboard.
"Not only did we want more dis
cussion with professors, we wanted
it in a comfortable atmosphere,"
said sophomore Nina Hsu. "We
wanted a place where we'd feel
comfortable admitting that we
don't know as much as we want to -
we need to — to understand the
world around us."
Inspiration for Bursting the
Bubble came from conversations
the group's founders had after a
Sept. 11, 2002 panel discussion
that was organized as a forum to
discuss last year's terrorist attacks
but ended up focusing on U.S. pol
icy toward Iraq.
Four of the group's founders —
sophomores Maris Jones, Chloe
Rothstein, Elaine Theios and
Jenny Tolan — spent several

hours discussing the panel over
coflee while Hsu and sophomores
Angela Chen and Carol Yu found
themselves in impassioned conver
sation back at Sophomore College.
Alter having such a positive ex
perience with the panel, Hsu said,
the seven concluded that "this
needs to happen more often."
"The thing we all had in com
mon was we're all at Stanford,
studying all the time, and it's really
easy to lose track of what's going
on in the world," Rothstein said.
Faking the interdisciplinary
panel as a model, the group's
founders created Bursting the
Hubble to counter this tendency
plaguing many Stanford students
— despite a desire to be informed
about the outside world, the bus
tle of undergraduate life keeps
many students at a premier insti
tute of higher learning from
knowing what is behind the news
paper headlines.
"You come in [to Stanford]
thinking you're going to have a lot
of deep discussions, but it often
ends up being about the party last

night," I Isu saicl. "We all admitted
that we just don't know as much as
we want about current events."
The group's founders are em
phasizing that they want the pan
els and subsequent discussions to
be places where it is okay for stu
dents to not know everything
about a given issue.
"There are some people here
who are intimidated going to some
panels because they [fear they]
won't be able to contribute or even
understand," Jones said.
The panels will be held on the
first Tuesday of every month, and
the group's first official meeting
will be on Nov. 5, when the poten
tial war in Iraq will be discussed.
Tolan, whose current task is to
line up the speakers, has already
met with or will soon meet with Re
ligious Studies Prof. Thomas Shee
han, History Prof. Joel Beinin, for
mer University President Gerhard
Casper, Political Science Prof. Coit
Blacker and members of the
Hoover Institution about partici
pating in upcoming panels.
According to the group's

founders, student reaction has
been overwhelming. The group
had over 250 students sign up for
information at last week's activities
fair, and more than 30 students
were present at the first organiza
tional meeting last night.

"At Stanford, we're expected to
be the next generation of leaders,
and we don't even know about cur
rent events," said sophomore
Rocio Parra.
Students felt that without a
structured way of discussing is
sues, it was too easy to simply never
do it.
"If you don't make a conscious
effort to keep track of what's going
on in the world, it's easy to lose

Hornbeak.
Sophomore Lauren Rodriguez
said, "In a club like this, you're get

Walk through the halls of a Stanford residence and
try to find a conversation about current events. Ac
cording to some students, such an effort would be fu
tile, thanks to the proverbial "Stanford bubble" — the
insular mindset that allegedly characterizes the envi
ronment on the Farm.
Frustrated by a lack of knowledge about what's
going on outside Campus Drive and inspired by dis
cussions following a Sophomore College panel, seven
girls have teamed up to create a new campus group to
help students inform themselves about domestic and
foreign affairs.
The group, called Bursting the Bubble, is cen
tered around monthly panels where faculty from
different disciplines and with diverse political
views will deliver talks on a specific topic. After-

Bubble meeting in Tresidder Union.
wards, the speakers and students
will discuss the issue, using the
information and opinions from
the faculty as a springboard.
"Not only did we want more dis
cussion with professors, we wanted
it in a comfortable atmosphere,"
said sophomore Nina Hsu. "We
wanted a place where we'd feel
comfortable admitting that we
don't know as much as we want to -
we need to — to understand the
world around us."
Inspiration for Bursting the
Bubble came from conversations
the group's founders had after a
Sept. 11, 2002 panel discussion
that was organized as a forum to
discuss last year's terrorist attacks
but ended up focusing on U.S. pol
icy toward Iraq.
Four of the group's founders —
sophomores Maris Jones, Chloe
Rothstein, Elaine Theios and
Jenny Tolan — spent several

hours discussing the panel over
coflee while Hsu and sophomores
Angela Chen and Carol Yu found
themselves in impassioned conver
sation back at Sophomore College.
Alter having such a positive ex
perience with the panel, Hsu said,
the seven concluded that "this
needs to happen more often."
"The thing we all had in com
mon was we're all at Stanford,
studying all the time, and it's really
easy to lose track of what's going
on in the world," Rothstein said.
Faking the interdisciplinary
panel as a model, the group's
founders created Bursting the
Hubble to counter this tendency
plaguing many Stanford students
— despite a desire to be informed
about the outside world, the bus
tle of undergraduate life keeps
many students at a premier insti
tute of higher learning from
knowing what is behind the news
paper headlines.
"You come in [to Stanford]
thinking you're going to have a lot
of deep discussions, but it often
ends up being about the party last

night," I Isu saicl. "We all admitted
that we just don't know as much as
we want about current events."
