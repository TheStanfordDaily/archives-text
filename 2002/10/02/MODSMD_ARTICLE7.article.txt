### SEAN VOIGT 
Two dorms, Alondra and
Naranja, will have an extra resi

to learn this year: CAA.
Standing for Cultural Aware

implementation of the position

changing the stereotypical and
uninformed views that students
may have about certain cultures,
we have to start talking about it in
our homes."
The job of the CAA is to create
dialogue and empathy about cul

lo Thorn Massey, resident fellow
of Naranja.
"[The CAA] should do more
than program in the residence,
they should communicate and
disseminate insightful cultural
information through email,
phone and bulletin boards,"
Massey said. " I bis person will
have an open door and open
mind so that conversation about
culture and can be both informa

One of the main purposes of
the pilot is to define the best way to
