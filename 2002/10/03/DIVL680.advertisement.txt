CHUCK E. CHEESE
WERE NOT
WAL-MART-
The shame of it.
Los Angeles is our
community, and we
share it with millions of
disenfranchised people
who have been, and
continue to be,
humiliated. They live in
fear because the US
government has refused
to recognize them as
fully franchised
members of our society.
This has resulted in a
society in denial-a
society looking more
and more like a well
designed apartheid
system...a society in
contradiction, collecting
taxes from people they
conveniently ignore.
Most companies
operating within this
degrading system don't
seem to care. Some are
afraid of immigration
reprisals and others
remain silent while
salting away
unconscionable profits.
Others, move their
operations off shore
where they are free to
pay poverty level wages
with impunity.
American Apparel...
the anti-brand.
American Apparel is
addressing this civil
liberties crisis as it
applies to California, the
country as a whole, and
the apparel industry.
We discontinued the
use of sub-contractors
and created a unique
"manufacturing
community," supported
by loyal, highly
motivated, fairly paid
employees, enjoying the
benefits and rewards of
a job well done.
Specifically, we are
engineering our
production process so
that every American
Apparel employee will
earn a living wage and
beyond. Our culture
recognizes outstanding
performance and
promotes from within,
provides health care
benefits, training and
education programs,
ESL, and a soon to be
operating day care
facility.
American Apparel is
striving to become a
new model for the
apparel industry, and
asks for your support.
