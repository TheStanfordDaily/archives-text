## U.S. proposal pressures Iraq 3 1/2-page resolution would give Iraq 30 days to declare weapons program 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — A
toughly worded U.S. draft proposal on
Iraq would give U.N. inspectors broad
new powers to hunt for weapons of mass
destruction and provide them with mili
tary backing to carry out the search.
According to the M 1/2-page draft res
olution obtained yesterday by The Asso
ciated Press, the Security C Council would
give Iraq 30 days to compile a "com
plete declaration of all aspects of its pro
gram to develop chemical, biological
and nuclear weapons."
"If any "false statements or omis
sions," are made in the declaration,
member states would be authorized to
"use all necessary means to restore in
ternational peace and security in the
area," diplomatic language permitting
military force.
The U.S. proposal has not been sub
mitted formally to the Security Council,

or even shown to the majority of its 15
members. Key elements of the U.S. draft
face deep opposition from Russia, China
and France — three veto-holding coun
cil members who say the aren't ready to
authorize force before inspectors have
time to test Iraq's willingness to comply.
But U.S. diplomats welcomed signs
that all three were ready for some com
promise that would empower the in
spectors and speed up a timetable for
Iraqi compliance.
Working a two-track approach on
Iraq at the United Nations and at home
yesterday, President Bush said the use
of force against Iraq "may become un
avoidable" if President Saddam Hus
sein refuses to disarm. He issued his
threat after House leaders agreed to
give Bush authority to oust Saddam. A
top Senate Democrat suggested the
plan might win Senate support as well.
If the American draft resolution at
the United Nations is passed in its cur
rent form, it would give U.N. inspectors
sweeping powers and could authorize a
foreign military presence in Iraq to en
force the resolution.

France has been floating a counter
proposal which welcomes changes in
the inspections regime but does not au
thorize force against Iraq.
Instead, a draft of the French propos
al, obtained by AP, offers Iraq a chance to
cooperate but says that "any serious fail
ure by Iraq to comply with its obliga
tions," would lead to an immediate Sec u
rity Council meeting to "consider any
measure to ensure full compliance."
A further glaring difference between
the two drafts is that the U.S. proposal,
written with the British, doesn't recog
nize Iraq's sovereignty and territorial
integrity. That language, important for
China, appears iu previous resolutions
and in the French draft and had been
used by Iraq in the past to block inspec
tors from entering so-called sensitive
sites such as government ministries.
The competing drafts lay out the
basis for the difficult Security Council
negotiations on Iraq expected to begin
tomorrow, when chief U.N. weapons
inspector Hans Blix briefs the council
on his meetings in Vienna earlier t'his
week with Iraqi officials.
