MANILA, Philippines (AP)—A
nail-packed bomb killed an Amer
ican Green Beret and two Filipinos
yesterday outside a restaurant
near a base in the troubled south
ern Philippines, where the U.S.
military helped in the fight against
al-Qaida-linked rebels this year.
U.S. and Filipino investigators
swarmed over the devastated site
today, looking into the possibility
of a suicide attack.
The blast, from a bomb hidden
011 a motorcycle, wounded 25 peo
ple outside the restaurant, which is
frequented by U.S. and Filipino
soldiers, in the city of Zamboanga,
officials said. Television footage
showed a pool of blood and un
conscious victims — some with
their shirts bloodied — being
loaded into ambulances.

No one claimed responsibility
for the blast. Suspicion fell on ex
tremists like the al-Qaida-linkecl
Abu Sayyal group and communist
rebels who had threatened earlier
in the day to attack police and mil
itary installations.
rhe Filipino driver of the mo
torcycle, who was killed, was sus
pected of bringing the bomb.
Officials said they were trying to
determine if the explosive detonat
ed prematurely or whether it was a
suicide attack, unheard of iil the
Philippines. ABS-GBN television
reported investigators were exam
ining the nails closely, saying such
types of bombs have been used by
suicide bombers in the Middle East.
"We do not know where the
bomb was supposed to be
brought," Brig. Gen. Eduardo Pu

rificacion. " I he driver of the 1110-
torcyle loaded wilh the bomb
stopped and was checking some
thing in his motorcycle when the
bomb exploded."
Defense Secretary Angelo
Reyes said the bombing also could
have been the result of a grudge
against a local the owner of a local
restaurant. Asked about the possi
bility of a suicide attack, he said: "It
might be too early to say. \V'e are
still investigating."
Security had already been tight
ened in advance of an Oct. 12
Christian festival in the middle of
the southern islands that make up
the archipelago's Muslim heart
land. Amid worries, more troops
were being sent in, and check
points were set up on major roads
and outside the city's power plant.
