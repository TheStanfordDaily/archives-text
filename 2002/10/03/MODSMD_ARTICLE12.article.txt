shouting their rage at rebels advancing

Rebels were reported by U.S. military
officials and diplomats to be newly in con
trol of the northwest city of Seguela, I «S()
miles away. Residents there said rebel
forces had entered the clay before, attack
ing the paramilitary police's headquarters
and the city courts.
Amid a West African-led peace effort,
Ivory Coast's leaders "obviously are doing a

group of 750-800 soldiers dismissed from

Seguela. Their goal is Abidjan, the key to

holding a country that remains one of the
region's economic powerhouses.
Rebels say onl\ a formidable Irene h mil
itary presence at Yamoussoukro is blocking
their drive south. I he roughly 1,000-strong
French force has made Yamoussoukro,
capital of the former French colony, its base
lor rescue missions and other deployments
in the nation's deadliest uprising.
I lie French sa\ tliev are there to protect
foreign nationals and provide logistical sup
port to the embattled government.
In Abidjan, demonstrators streamed
along boulevards toward the heart of the
city, once known as the Paris of West
Africa for its chic boutiques and expensive
restaurants. Many waved sticks, and oth
ers carried Ivory Coast's orange, white
and green flag.
"We are ready to go and liberate
Boauke!" the angry crowd shouted.
Youth leaders insisted they would
march on Bouake themselves in a week if
rebels remained iu control of the city, Ivory
('.oast's second-largest, where a half-million
people are struggling without water, elec
