TEHRAN, Iran (AP) â€” A cul
tural official was taken into cus
tody lor failing to arrest an Iranian
actress and the young actor she
publicly kissed on the cheek, Iran
ian media reported yesterday.
Socializing between unrelated
men and women is banned by
Iran's Islamic laws, and public
kissing between men and women
is considered taboo.
Mohammad Ali Pakdel, a cul
tural official in Yazd in central
Iran, was jailed Tuesday, the daily
Etemad reported. He was later re
leased on $6,250 bail.
Pakdel was accused of failing to
act on an arrest order issued after
actress Oowhar Kheirandish and
actor Ali Zamani shook hands and
kissed on the cheek during a pub
lic festival in Yazd.

Pakdel denied the accusation,
saying the judicial order was is
sued after the pair had already left
Yazd, Etemad reported.
Iranian filmmakers and other
artists warned the arrest would
harm Iran's improving interna
tional image.
Filmmaker Abolfazl Jalili said
yesterday that Kheirandish, who is
in her 50s, became emotional and
kissed Zamani after meeting him.
Zamani, in his 20s, was a stu
dent of Kheirandish's late hus
band, |amshid Esmaeilkhani, a
well-known actor who died earlier
this year.
"For kheirandish, Zamani was
like her son and there was defi
nitely no other intention. Judicial
action only harms Iran's improv
ing international image," jalili

said.
Actor Iraj Rati said lie was
"shocked" to hear arrest warrants
had been issued lor Kheirandish
and Zamani.
"Kheirandish is one of the best
actresses and a respectable lady.
I'm really shocked to hear the
news," he said.
It was not clear if the arrest war
ranis against the two actors still
stand. Kheirandish and Zamani
could not be reached l< >r comment
yesterday.
On Monday, Mohsen
falebpour, who represents Iran's
hard-line supreme leader Ayatol
lah Ali Khamenei, organized a
public protest in Ya/.d to con
demn the public kiss, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
