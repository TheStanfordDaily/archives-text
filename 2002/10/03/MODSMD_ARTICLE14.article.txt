## The 						Stanford Daily New visa screening policy affects all students 
### 
Published Since 1H 1 ) I

Autumn quarter is under way, but a
handful of Stanford students have
been barred from returning to cam
pus. The reason? In short, it is be
cause they hold foreign passports. The U.S.
State Department enacted strict student-visa
screening processes after Sept. 11, 2001 in a
legitimately conceived — but badly planned
— attempt to protect the nation's security.
Although we understand the government's
motivations, we strongly doubt that the new
program has generated the intended effect of
effectively screening visa applicants. Instead,
the new legislation has mired the State De
partment in an administrative mess, causing
delays that could end up harming our na
tional interest rather than protecting it.
The new screening process singles out visa
applicants from certain countries. These ap
plicants now undergo a much lengthier, more
extensive screening process than in the past.

In addition, the State Department scrutinizes
the study plans of those who seek student
visas; under certain circumstances, an inter
national student majoring in biology could be
considered a threat.
These questionable screening methods
alone are reason enough for discontent. Add
to that the outdated technology and bureau
cratic bog through which many visa applica
tions have been dragged, and it's no wonder
that these students are experiencing "incon
venience and hardship," as the State Depart
ment's Web site puts it. Now, a process that
once took mere weeks to complete could end
up taking months, if not longer.
As a result of the new screening process,
thousands of international students still await
entry to the U.S. Of these, 15 to 20 have been
admitted to Stanford, but have yet to be ad
mitted into the U.S. The University will defer
enrollment for students who did not arrive on

campus by Sept. 30 — a decision we applaud.
We urge University officials to continue to fa
cilitate a smooth transition for those students,
if and when they eventually return.
Despite the University's support, though,
the delay has been costly. Those who remain
stuck abroad anticipate losing research assis
tantships to students who are already on cam
pus — an unpleasant prospect for many who
struggle to pay their way through college.
Some students who have remained on campus
report that they may not visit their native coun
try this year, worrying that if they were to leave,
they, too, may find themselves stranded.
But the students themselves aren't the only
ones who suffer. Universities such as Stanford
recruit some of their most talented and driven
students from abroad. For example, 41 per
cent of graduate degrees in engineering are
given to international students. If visa troubles
were to deter frustrated students from consid-

ering Stanford, the University could lose some
of its most valuable applicants.
Perhaps most worrisome is that the gov
ernment may in fact he putting the national
interest at risk through its legislation. If the
immigration situation drives away potential
international students, what will happen to
the U.S.? Will the nation really be better off
without them? To believe so is to espouse the
worst kind of nationalistic narcissism. What
will happen is that the country will suffer
from a heterogeneous work force, from
strained relationships with countries whose
citizens are turned away, and from a lack of
diversity in background, in culture and, most
importantly, in ideas.
The State Department plans to implement
new technology within the next few months to
improve its infrastructure and clear the backlog.
For the sake of students and the American high
er education system, we hope it works.
