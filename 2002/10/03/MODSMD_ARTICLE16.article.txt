U.S. needs to 'resolve the problem of Israel'
I'd like to say thank you to the staff of
The Daily lor print ing the letters by I lias
Chrissochoidis and Tim Meyer as a
counter-response to the shocking article
by Dr. Beichman ("United States finds it
self alone in the fight against Saddam,"
Oct. 2).
It's nice to know that there are some
members of Stan ford with a realistic view
point on the Iraq situation. There is one
point that no one ever seems to raise
though: Israel.
It seems to me that the principle desta
bilizing factor in the Middle East is Israel,
the fourth largest military power in the
world. Iraq may be trying to develop
weapons of mass destruction, but Israel
already has them (supplied by the Ameri
can and British governments).
Iraq, almost certainly, commits
human rights offenses on its own citi
zens, yet the Israeli army does the same
to the Palestinians along with settling oc
cupied lands, which is in contravention
of the Geneva Convention.
Sanctions have been imposed on Iraq
fora decade, and now there is talk of in
vading. Why has no one even approached
the concept of being even handed and im
posing sanctions on the Israelis?
I believe that there are definitely secu
rity issues with respect to Iraq. But if the
U.S. storms in and tries to remove Sad
dam without first resolving the problem
of Israel, then problems of distrust and
fear between other Middle Eastern coun
tries and the U.S. will only worsen, which
may possibly lead to more terrorism.
I know an ex-RAF pilot who told me
stories about patrolling the no-fly zones in
Iraqi airspace. I le used to fly in formation
with the U.S. and a particular ally. I he
U.S. and U.K. pilots generally returned to
base with all their weapons intact, while

the other planes often returned empty,
having dropped their load on the Kur
dish people. Makes you wonder, "who is
the good guy?"

Bursting the Bubble group offers 'wide
array of events'
I applaud the efforts of the "Bursting
the Bubble" group to arrange events to
better inform Stanford students about do
mestic and international events (" 'Bub
ble' group schedules talks," Oct. 2).
I'd also suggest that interested stu
dents can learn about the wide array of
events offered on international issues by
getting on the e-mail lists and consulting
the Web sites of the four National Re
source Centers for Area Studies at Stan
ford: The Center for Af rican Studies, The
('enter for East Asian Studies and The
Center for Russian, East European and
Eurasian Studies.
These four departments offer a wealth
of lectures and conferences in interna
tional issues — as also do the Taube Cen
ter for Jewish Studies, the Institute of In
ternational Studies and others too nu
merous lo name.We encourage all Stan
ford undergraduates to participate in our
events.

Michigan resident questions if nudity
is 'allowed'
I lie guest coin 1 11 n ("Nudity a possible
solution to autumn unpacking woes,"
Sept. SO) asked il ii wouldn't be easier to

have a nudist campus.
I have to ask, would that be allowed?
Here at ihe University of Michigan nu
dity is so abhorred as contrary to the pub
lit image desired by certain authorities,
that even the annual "Naked Mile"run by
graduating students (and others) has
been squashed by threats and actual ar
rests of nude runners.
As there is no actual harm caused by
the nudity, the reason for the arrests are,
according to the authorities, "for the pro
tection of the runners" against potential
abuse by spectators — much like the treat
ment of unveiled women in Saudi Arabia,
which is said to be "for their own good."*
I know that the Berkeley City Council
banned public nudity after one student
insisted on walking around nude, but
what would be the response of Stanford's
authorities if a student chose to exercise
his individual dignity by persistently at
tending classes in the nude? Would it be
Jeffersonian or Talibanistic?

Refugee project seeking student help
Right now in Ethiopia there are about
eight million people on the verge death
by famine. In the next few weeks, hun
dreds of thousands will probably die —
thousands already have.
Where are these people? How many
are vulnerable (under the age of five, or
over (if))? Which international relief agen
cies are working with these people? These
are questions that most of us at Stanford,
myself included, have little or no idea how
to answer. II we could answer them, it
