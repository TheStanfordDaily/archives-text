# 'The Thinker' returns from world travels
## Famous Rodin sculpture gets new home inside Cantor Center; Two-day symposium planned 
### SARAH PAPÃ‰ EDITORIAL STAFF 
Auguste Rodin's "The Thinker" has returned
to campus after a yearlong absence, but students
will no longer be able to admire it as they pass by
Meyer Library on the way to class.
The statue, an authorized cast of Rodin's sculp
ture, used to sit atop a pedestal in front of Meyer.
But on Monday it was installed within the south
rotunda of the Cantor Center for the Visual Arts.
"It was determined that moving The Thinker'
to the Center would be the most flexible alterna
tive," Chief Curator Bernard Barryte said. "The
Cantor Foundation, which still owns 95 percent of
the statue, indicated that it may travel periodical
ly, and we could not guarantee a replacement stat
ue at the Meyer site, which is unsightly without its
statue."
To mark the statue's return, the museum is
holding a two-day symposium entitled "New
Studies on Rodin" on Oct. 4 and 5, which will be
open to the public. The symposium also marks
the publication (rf late Prof. Albert Elsen's 662-
page catalogue of the the museum's Rodin collec
tion.
The symposium will feature 13 scholars speak
ing on a variety of topics concerning Rodin, in
cluding a keynote address by Ruth Butler, a pro
fessor of art history at the University of Massa
chusetts.
" The Thinker" is one of 200 works in the Can
tor Center's Rodin collection, which is one of the
three largest Rodin collections in the world.
In 1988, the Cantor Foundation gave the Uni
versity a bronze cast of " The Thinker" made in
1972. Rodin originally created his famous statue
in 1880 and the first cast was made in 1904.
The foundation and the University jointly own
the piece.
Last year "The Thinker" traveled to Australia
and Singapore as part of an exhibition titled
"Rodin: A Magnificent Obsession: Sculpture
from the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Founda
tion."
Though there are no current plans for the stat
ue's renewed travel, museum Public Relations
