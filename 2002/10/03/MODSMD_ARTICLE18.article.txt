## 
### KAREN RUTZICK DAILY PENNSYLVANIAN (U. PENNSYLVANIA 
(U-WIRK) PI 11LADKI .PI 11A — Thir
ty years after uncovering the Watergate
scandal thai brought down the Nixon ad
ministration, renowned journalist Bob
Woodward told a crowd of University of
Pennsylvania students Tuesday night thai
he thinks there are still lessons to l>e
learned liom the scandal. Referring to the
more than 4,000 hours of taped conversa
tions revealed from the Nixon era, Wood
ward said the former president's ideas
about integrity and the role of the presi
dency were highly skewed.
"What Nixon never says is, 'What
would be right, what would be good for
the country?"' Woodward said. "I le said,
'I low do we screw so-and-so?' The presi
dency was an instrument."
Woodward was introduced by
Provost Robert Barchi to a near-capaci
ty crowd at 7:li() p.m. Tuesday night at
Irvine Auditorium.
Barchi termed Woodward as "one of
the most respected reporters in the busi
ness" and urged audience members to
"keep this important issue [of integrity) at
the forefront of our thoughts."
Woodward began his remarks by re
laying a story about his personal hero.
"When I think about integrity, the first
person who comes to my mind is kather
ine Graham — what she meant to jour
nalism, and what she meant to me,"
W( )odward said.
Woodward shared a memory of a con
versation with Graham, the former pub
lisher of" The Washington Post, when she

once asked him when the Watergate
sc anclal would be lull) uncovered. I le an
swered, "Never."
"She said, 'Don't tell me
never, "Woodward said. "I remember
leaving thai lunch with adrenaline run
ning. What she told me is . . . work on
it, dig, go back . . . whatever you have
to do, get to the bottom of this story,
any story, lb me, that's the most im
portant part of integrity. Not just cov
ering the surface. I low do we really get
to the bottom?"
In an interview after the speech,
Woodward said, "That's ii, that's the
motto —don't tell me never."
Moving into a more casual mode,
Woodward took an informal poll of the
crowd's opinions on several topics in the
midst of his speech—including the legiti
macy of former President Kill Clinton's
impeachment and the support for wag
ing war in Iraq, as well as the number of
students who voted for President Bush,
Al (lore or Ralph Nader in the 2000 pres
idential election.
l he reporter continued his poll by
asking Barchi to define the role of the
presidency.
Barchi's reply, "to be the intellectu
al and moral representative of the peo
ple," was somewhat different from
Woodward's.
Woodward said lie thought the presi
dent should "define the next stage of
good for the majority of people in the
country."
And while Woodward still grapples
with the issues involving the presidency
today, Nixon's past presidency continues

to have an effect on his outlook.
Woodward told the audience that the
single misrepresentation in the cinematic
adaptation of the Watergate lx>ok "All
I lie President's Men," which he co-au
thored with fellow reporter Carl Bern
stein, is a line where Post Editor Ben
Bradlee tells him to get the story right for
the future of the nation.
"I le actually said 'What the hell do we
do now?"'W(X)dward said. "And it should
be etched above ... every institution. It is
exactly the light question to ask. 100
often leaders try to apply old ideas and
old morals. What they have to do is say
'this is totally new,' and to a certain extent
start from scratch."
When an audience member ques
tioned Woodward about the identity of
his Famous source, Deep Throat, Wood
ward responded vaguely.
"It's a man, he's alive," Woodward
said. "The story will be told at one time.
It's a fascinating story. It's obvious if you
know the answer, but not obvious if you
don't."
University Honor Council Co-Chair
man Dennis I upper said he was very
pleased with the outcome of the event.
"The best part of tonight is that it was
a casual conversation, not a lecture,"
I upper said. "He is someone who has
learned the value of integrity in a practi
cal way."
The talk was sponsored by the
Provost's Spotlight Series, the Social Plan
ning and Events Committee's Connais
sance branch and the UHC as a part of
Penn's third-annual Academic Integrity
Week.
