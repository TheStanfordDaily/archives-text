# Michigan petitions court on race-based admissions
## 
### MEGAN HAYES MICHIGAN DAILY (U. MICHIGAN 
(U-WIRE) ANN ARBOR, Mich. — In a
rare legal move, the Center for Individual
Rights petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court
Tuesday to hear Gratz v. Bollinger, which
has not been ruled on by the appeals court,
in the hopes that the case may appear in
front of the (lourt alongside the other Uni
versity of Michigan admissions case, Cl ut
ter v. Bollinger.
The University is currently awaiting a
decision from the Oth U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in the case of Gratz v. Bollinger,
which calls into question the University's
use of race as a factor in admissions in the
College of Literature, Science and the Arts.
A decision in the case Grutter v.
Bollinger, which addresses the Law
School's admissions policy, was made by
the 6th Circuit last May in favor of the Uni
versity.
If the Supreme Court grants ClR's peti
tion, the decision would bypass a still-pend
ing court of appeals ruling and move the
case directly to argument at the Supreme
Court level.
"This is exactly the set of circumstances
where the Supreme Court has granted
such (review) in the past," Curt Levey, di
rector of legal and public affairs for the
Washington-based CIR said. He said the
need for expediency stems from the fact
that students nationwide should not have
to wait to hear whether race will be a factor
in admissions.
He also said it was very important that
the cases be argued together.
"Our concern is that we couldn't wait
any longer and have the case heard this
term," he said.
Levey said in most cases it is unusual lor
litigants who have won at the appellate
court level to desire for the Supreme Court
to hear their case, but added that this is not
a normal case.
"The University itself has said (the useof
race in admissions) is an issue of national
importance," Levey said.
He added that the University's desire
for the Supreme Court to deny cert in the
Law School admissions case reflects a lack

of confidence on their part.
"Observers don't think they're likely to
win and I think they know that," Levey
said.
Krislov said in spite of Tuesday's peti
tion, the University still opposes a Supreme
Court granting of certiorari in either or
both cases.
"We won 100 percent at the last level,"
he said. "We want to keep that victory —
we don't want to see that victory eroded."
If the Supreme Court decides to hear
the undergraduate case, Krislov said he be
lieves there is some benefit to looking at the
two admissions cases simultaneously, as
CI R desires.
"It may help provide a fuller picture,"
he said, adding that the evidence in both
cases is complementary. "Obviously we
care deeply about this and believe diversity
is necessary to our core mission."
" There are educational benefits to di
versity in both stages of education," he said.
"Whether it is in the Supreme Court or in
the 6th (lircuit, we think we'll win."
Robert Sedler, a constitutional law pro
fessor at Wayne State University, said
under Rule 10, one of the rules governing
Supreme Court standards of judicial re
view, the Court may grant a petition to hear
a case still under review and awaiting judg
ment in the court of appeals. He said peti
tions of this nature are extremely rare. The
last time it has clone so was in lirown v.
Board of Education in 1954.
Sedler said there are many possible ways
for the Supreme Court to act, the most like
ly of which would be to grant ClR's request
or to wait to rule on it until it made its deci
sion in the Law School case.
"When time is of the essence in a case,
the parties may ask the Supreme Court to
take the case and bypass the 6th Circuit,"
Georgetown University Prof. Susan Bloch
said.
She said a petition of this nature is not
asked for or granted often by the Supreme
Court..
Levy said the fact that the case holds na
tional importance c reates a need for it to
keep moving forward toward the Supreme
Court, a point that he feels the University
should take into consideration.
