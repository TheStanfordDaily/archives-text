# Anti-abortion posters cause uproar
## 
### WILLOW WELTER ROCKS MOUNTAIN COLLEGIAN (COLORADO STATE U 
(U-WIRL) FORI COLLINS, Colo. â€”A
giant display of posters showing bloody,
aborted fetuses caused controversy in the
Plaza at Colorado State University Monday.
"Warning: Cenocide Pictures Ahead" read
the signs erected at the free speech Plaza,
where the anti-abortion group Justice For All
had set up for day one of its controversial ex
hibit. Billboard-sized posters showed fetuses
at different stages of pregnancies, after the
women had undergone abortions.
Surrounding the anti-abortion demonst ra
tion area were blank white boards where spec
tators could freely write their thoughts. Writ
ten in marker on the "Free Speech Boards"
were remarks like, "This is Bullshit," "It's too
bad you have to use gory pictures to persuade
people to believe you" and"I hope this makes
you sick because it's murder and if you sup
port it, you need help."
Justice For All was not the only organiza
tion present, although their display towered
in size over the others. The pro-choice group,

National Abortion and Reproductive Rights
Action League, had a booth lodised on the
upcoming election.
Nearby, shouting ensued between another
pro-choice platform, Life and Liberty for
Women, and several anti-abortionists.
throughout the Plaza, students engaged
in heated discussions, some wearing neon-col
ored "I Am Pro-Choice" slickers that NARAL
had distributed. Some of these conversations
were sparked by a group of about 90 people
11 i;it had traveled from Colorado Springs to
engage students in non-confrontational dia
logue about the topic.
I lie Colorado Springs group was com
posed of students at the I'ocus Institute, a
Christian organization and school against
abortion. 1 he students individually strolled
through the Plaza, meeting spectators and
posing the question, "What do you think
about all this?"
Bonnie Bolz, a student at l'ocus Institute,
said Justice Loi All came to their school and
asked them to come engage in dialogue
without necessarily expressing conflicting
views.
The resident supervisor at Focus Institute,

Lindy Beam, said their group tame to edu
cate people about abortion.
"I don't think people really think about
what abortion really is," Beam said. "If it's
legal and it's the most common surgery in the
United States, why don't we ever see pictures
ol it? Why don't we ever look at it?"
Beam said the group of students came with
the approach of engaging in conversation
without trying to force their beliefs on people.
"We're all pro-life and we want to get our
view across, but basically the truth is going to
stand for itself," Beam insisted. "1 don't have
to force you to believe it."
The bloody abortion posters upset some
students, inciting obscenity, shouting and dis
appointed sighs.
"1 completely disagree with this," said
11 hi mail Girtin, a sophomore English major,
as she examined the Justice For All exhibit.
"It's so atrocious. If 1 don't even have a right
to choose, then how can someone expect me
to be a mother?"
"Yeah," agreed Emily Latta, a freshman
open liberal arts major. "It kind of makes me
numb to the whole thing. Why scare me with
something like this?"
