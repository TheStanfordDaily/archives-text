## Willingham silent, still respected 
### 
This was to be my big break. I was
going to interview Tyrone Will
ingham, the biggest name in
college sports.
1 was going to sit down with him and
discuss a wide range of issues, from play
ing his former team to being the first black
coach at Notre Dame.
The whole school was going to read it,
and people far and wide would come and
praise me (not that you couldn't do that
before).
And then he declined my interview.
He what?
He declined my interview.
I was furious. I was depressed. I went
through the gamut of emotions and was

intent on roasting Ty. I
would rip him in The
Daily. I had a whole
plan. 1 would get quotes
from the campus about
how students hated
him. 1 would mock him
endlessly for being too
"important" to talk to
an esteemed Daily
writer. Ohhh, it was

going to be good.
So I collected the quotes, and of course
there were some angry ones.
"He's a cop-out. You can't leave a
team just because you are offered more
money."
"I hope he loses all of his games."
But I found that most people did not
hold these sentiments. More common an
swers I never expected.
"Who's Tyrone Willingham?"
"Oh yeah, he's the Associated Vice
Provost of Housing and Dining, right?"
"Tyrone Willingham, the Raider's run
ning back? He's pretty good at shaking off
tackles."
Alright, so not exactJy what I anticipat
ed. But if you are reading this column, you
probably know who Willingham is. And
lie declined my interview, dammit! I le
was going to be mocked!
So 1 sat down and started writing. I
wrote about all the ways I hated him. I
wrote about why 1 thought he was a bad
coach, and why I thought that he was ar
rogant. And I looked at my paper, and
there was only one sentence: "He declined
my interview."
The truth is that I don't hate Tyrone
Willingham. In fact, 1 respect him. Yes, I
wish he had let me interview him, if for no
other reason than it would have been a
good story.
But Ty is not a bad guy. Yes, he left the
program. Yes, the redshirt freshmen
came here to play for him, and it's a ripoff
that they never got to compete for the
coach that recruited them.
But overall, Willingham is alright. And

I guess I don't blame him for declining the
interview (even though it would have
been the best interview he would have
ever had). I don't blame him because the
issues people are so interested in really
shouldn't be that important.
Yes, Willingham is the first black coach
in Notre Dame history. And of course he is
one of the few black coaches in the NCAAs.
But il is clear that this shouldn't be the
case.
A few days ago, Johnny Cochrane
threatened to sue the NFL for not having
enough minority coaches. I agree com
pletely that the number ofblack coaches in
both college and the pros is pathetic.
There are currently two black head coach
es in the NFL. I lowever, Coc hrane's solu
tion doesn't make sense. He wants the
NFL to award draft pic ks to teams that

have diverse front offices.
This is not the way to cause c hange.
Race should not be a factor in the hir
ing of coaches. The best way to cause
change is through public outcry. If people
show their anger, the teams' hiring poli
cies will change. Rewarding draft picks will
only make race more of a factor rather
than allowing it to become unimportant.
In the midst of this media storm stands
Tyrone. The only black coach at Notre
Dame, he has become the No. 1 "success
ful minority coach."
I don't blame him for not wanting to
talk about it anymore.
There is another reason he rejected the
interview: He isn't our coach anymore. I le
doesn't have to be interviewed bv The

MATT SAYLES/The Stanford Daily File
Despite losing Tyrone Willingham to Notre Dame, most Stanford students bear him no ill
will, and his performance and character are widely respected.
Stan lord Daily because now lie has
to deal with the Observer, Notre
Dame's student paper.
And that is something that a lot
of the Cardinal fans on campus
haven't yet grasped. We have open
ly accepted Buddy Teevens into
our community and hearts. But we
haven't yet let goofTy.
Buthe has let goof us. So I guess
its time to say "goodbye."
1 like Ty because I think he is a
good coach. 1 like I y because he is
showing the world that a school
can have good athletics and acad
emics. 1 like Ty. because he re
sponds to the students as well as
the administration.
But on Saturday, I hope we
win not so that we can beat our
old coach, but so that we can get a
win. Now he is just a coach for an
other team, no different than any
other coach.
Except for the lact that he re
jected my interview; for that, 1
hate him.

Jacob Saperstein is a sophomore major
ing in public policy. In case oj a Stanford
loss on Saturday, stand clear of the flying
debris coming out of his dorm room. E
