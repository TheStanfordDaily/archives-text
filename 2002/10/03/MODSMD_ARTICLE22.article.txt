Men's Ultimate
Bloodthirsty, Stanford's men's
ultimate team, garnered what is
often considered the grail of col
lege club sports when it won the
men's ultimate national champi
onship last year, its first national
title since 1984.
The team lost one of the na
tion's best players, Mike Whitak
er, to graduation, but much of the
core of last year's squad returns.
Captains Bart Watson and
Shreyas Vijaykumar lead the 10
Bloodthirsty men back for more
under the careful watch of third
year coach Mike Payne.
Bloodthirsty will compete at
the Chico Tournament in two
weeks and at the UC-Santa Cruz
Invite in November as part of its
fall schedule leading up to its title
defense this spring.
Women's Ultimate
After two years of finishing one
win short of a national title, Stan
ford's women's ultimate team, Su
perfly, is hungry to finally capture
the program's elusive fourth na
tional championship.
Superfly took three straight na
tional titles from 1997 to 1999 be
fore entering what some thought
might be a long rebuilding period
in 2000. However, the 2001 squad
blew those expectations away, ad

vancing to the national champi
onship game, and the 2002 edi
tion of Superfly was one of
strongest teams in the country.
But a tough loss to UC-San
Diego in last year's national cham
pionship game has set a c lear goal
for Superfly this year: to break the
streak of national runner-up fin
ishes with a title at the college na
tionals this spring.
Senior Gwen Ambler leads a
group of 1(> returnees this year as
one of the team's three captains,
joining graduate student Jenny
Burney and senior Whitney Met
zger. Defensive giant junior
Karen Milch leads the group of
seven returning juniors on the
squad.
Men's Lacrosse
The Stanford men's lacrosse
team is coming off its second
straight IJSLIA National Champi
onships appearance. After falling
in the championship in 2001, the
Cardinal came up short once
again to defending champion
Colorado State in the quarterfi
nals, (losing out what was a spec
tacular run through the playoffs.
Stanford advanced to the nation
al tournament after reaching the
West Coast Lacrosse League
Tournament final.
Willi the regular season begin
ning in |anuary, I he* team will re
group this fall, practicing three
times a week from October

through November before taking
the rest of the quarter of] to rest
up for what hopes to be a long on
coming season.
The team graduated much of
its defensive core from last year's
squad, but most of its prolific scor
ing offense will he hack this win
ter, giving the squad an excellent
chance to continue its reputation
as being the team to beat on the
West Coast.
Ice Hockey
I ,ast year was not a banner year
for the Stanford ice hoc key team,
though a 3-2 win over California
in the team's last game did land
the Cardinal a surprising third
place finish in the Pacific-8 Con

ference Tournament. That win
over the Bears brought some re
demption from the (lardinal's 0-4
regular-season record against its
rivals across the Bay.
The Stanford squad struggled
with numbers more than any
thing else, being forced to play
one game last year with only six
skaters. Though the team is split
nearly evenly between graduate
and undergraduate students, al
most all of the Cardinal's under
grad players, including its lop two
scorers and its starting goalkeep
er, will be back this season.
Logitech Ice in San Jose will be
the team's new home this year,

after the Cardinal was forced to
split practice and game locations
between several facilities over the
last few years.
Stanford will open its season
the weekend of Oct. 11 when it
will host Boise State fora pair of
games at Logitech. Northern Ari
zona and Fresno State come to
town the next weekend before the
Cardinal heads south to face
I (A A for two games at the end of
the month.
Archery
The Stanford Archery team
dominated the collegiate division
at the Pacific Coast Archery
Championship Sept. 20 through
Sept. 22, taking home gold
medals in both the men's and
women's divisions.
Senior Michelle Marco shot the
top score in the women's colle
giate division, while coterm Keith
Coleman placed first on the men's
sick*. One of the team's newest
shooters, sophomore David Lu,
hit a personal best with an im
pressive score of 1,105 out of a
possible 1,440 points.
The Archery team was formed
in 2000 and, through a surge of

interest and ASSIJ funding sup
port, is now becoming a major
competitive forte in the West re
gion. 1 he team plans to take to
the road later this year to compete
in the U.S. National Indoor
Championships and the outdoor
U.S. 1 nter'Collegiate Archery
Championships, as well as other
major regional competitions.
Despite its impressive win last
weekend, the team is still lacing
significant hurdles.
"The biggest thing holding us
back is practice space," Coleman
said. "Every collegiate team we
compete against has the benefit of
on-campus practice space where
I hey can shoot both their indoor
and outdoor distances. We, on the
other hand, have nowhere to
practice outdoor distances and
have to travel over 40 minutes to
practice indoor. It's really going
to hurt us at nationals."
Badminton
The Stanford badminton team
is looking to follow up its success
ful 2001-2002 season, which saw
its men's squad take the title at the
Collegiate Nationals.
Most of last year's players are
back again, and there are several
promising new players. The
team, which consists of both un
dergraduate and graduate stu
dents of varying levels of experi

ence, practices four days a week at
(he Ford Center, and most of the
team members are involved in
some further training on their
own time.
The players compete in dual
meets against local schools such as

California, San Jose State and UC-
Davis as well as in regional and na
tional tournaments throughout
the year.
