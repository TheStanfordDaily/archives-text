Men's Ultimate
Bloodthirsty, Stanford's men's
ultimate team, garnered what is
often considered the grail of col
lege club sports when it won the
men's ultimate national champi
onship last year, its first national
title since 1984.
The team lost one of the na
tion's best players, Mike Whitak
er, to graduation, but much of the
core of last year's squad returns.
Captains Bart Watson and
Shreyas Vijaykumar lead the 10
Bloodthirsty men back for more
under the careful watch of third
year coach Mike Payne.
Bloodthirsty will compete at
the Chico Tournament in two
weeks and at the UC-Santa Cruz
Invite in November as part of its
fall schedule leading up to its title
defense this spring.
Women's Ultimate
After two years of finishing one
win short of a national title, Stan
ford's women's ultimate team, Su
perfly, is hungry to finally capture
the program's elusive fourth na
tional championship.
Superfly took three straight na
tional titles from 1997 to 1999 be
fore entering what some thought
might be a long rebuilding period
in 2000. However, the 2001 squad
blew those expectations away, ad

vancing to the national champi
onship game, and the 2002 edi
tion of Superfly was one of
strongest teams in the country.
But a tough loss to UC-San
Diego in last year's national cham
pionship game has set a c lear goal
for Superfly this year: to break the
streak of national runner-up fin
ishes with a title at the college na
tionals this spring.
Senior Gwen Ambler leads a
group of 1(> returnees this year as
one of the team's three captains,
joining graduate student Jenny
Burney and senior Whitney Met
zger. Defensive giant junior
Karen Milch leads the group of
seven returning juniors on the
squad.
Men's Lacrosse
The Stanford men's lacrosse
team is coming off its second
straight IJSLIA National Champi
onships appearance. After falling
in the championship in 2001, the
Cardinal came up short once
again to defending champion
Colorado State in the quarterfi
nals, (losing out what was a spec
tacular run through the playoffs.
Stanford advanced to the nation
al tournament after reaching the
West Coast Lacrosse League
Tournament final.
Willi the regular season begin
ning in |anuary, I he* team will re
group this fall, practicing three
times a week from October

through November before taking
the rest of the quarter of] to rest
up for what hopes to be a long on
coming season.
The team graduated much of
its defensive core from last year's
squad, but most of its prolific scor
ing offense will he hack this win
ter, giving the squad an excellent
chance to continue its reputation
as being the team to beat on the
West Coast.
Ice Hockey
I ,ast year was not a banner year
for the Stanford ice hoc key team,
though a 3-2 win over California
in the team's last game did land
the Cardinal a surprising third
place finish in the Pacific-8 Con

ference Tournament. That win
over the Bears brought some re
demption from the (lardinal's 0-4
regular-season record against its
rivals across the Bay.
The Stanford squad struggled
with numbers more than any
thing else, being forced to play
one game last year with only six
skaters. Though the team is split
nearly evenly between graduate
and undergraduate students, al
most all of the Cardinal's under
grad players, including its lop two
scorers and its starting goalkeep
er, will be back this season.
Logitech Ice in San Jose will be
the team's new home this year,
