The image of U.S. women's national
team goalkeeper BrianaScurryjumpingofl
her goal line to make a World Cup-winning
save lias been ingrained in the minds of
American soccer fans as one of the most
clutch plays in soccer history.

Men's Soccer
vs. San Jose Sfate, Tonight, 7:30 p.m.

To fans everywhere, this was a Her
culean effort. But if you ask goalkeepers
like Cardinal senior Andrew Terris, hav
ing nerves of steel is just part of a net
minder's job.
" The mental game is the majority of
what goalkeeping is all about," he said. "I
don't have any explicit way of forgetting
about mistakes. 1 just focus on the present
and let the game go on. Mistake or not, the
game goes on."
Last season and so far this year, Terris
has developed and matured into one of the
nation's best in the net. It is his play that has
helped the Cardinal (8-1) allow only seven

goals in the nine games so far.
Stanford's average of 0.64 goals al
lowed per game ranked as one of the best
in the nation last year, and Ferris attribut
es this accomplishment to the play of the
team defense.
"In terms of the stats, I think that's a tes
tament to who was playing in front of me
and the kind of team defense that we
played," he said. "Because we played great
defense, I didn't have much work to do. It
made my job easy."
Unfortunately, two important elements
from that defensive squad have moved onto
bigger things, playing Major League Soccer
this year. Standouts Lee Morrison and
Aaron Biddle were staples iu the Cardinal's
strong "D" for many years and will be
missed greatly.
Fortunately for Ferris, seniors Todd
Dunivant, an outside defender, and central
defender Taylor Graham are returning
starters who will be counted upon to lead
the Cardinal's revamped defense to its
fullest potential.
Along with starting freshman central de
lender Chad Marshall and sophomore out
side defender Aaron Maines, Ferris and
company will bring a defense that has
recorded six shutouts in its eight wins to
I larry Maloney Field on Thursday night at
7:30 p.m. against South Bay rival San Jose
