American soccer fans as one of the most
clutch plays in soccer history.

Men's Soccer
vs. San Jose Sfate, Tonight, 7:30 p.m.

To fans everywhere, this was a Her
culean effort. But if you ask goalkeepers
like Cardinal senior Andrew Terris, hav
ing nerves of steel is just part of a net
minder's job.
" The mental game is the majority of
what goalkeeping is all about," he said. "I
don't have any explicit way of forgetting
about mistakes. 1 just focus on the present
and let the game go on. Mistake or not, the
game goes on."
Last season and so far this year, Terris
has developed and matured into one of the
nation's best in the net. It is his play that has
helped the Cardinal (8-1) allow only seven

goals in the nine games so far.
Stanford's average of 0.64 goals al
lowed per game ranked as one of the best
in the nation last year, and Ferris attribut
es this accomplishment to the play of the
team defense.
"In terms of the stats, I think that's a tes
tament to who was playing in front of me
and the kind of team defense that we
played," he said. "Because we played great
defense, I didn't have much work to do. It
made my job easy."
Unfortunately, two important elements
from that defensive squad have moved onto
bigger things, playing Major League Soccer
this year. Standouts Lee Morrison and
Aaron Biddle were staples iu the Cardinal's
strong "D" for many years and will be
missed greatly.
Fortunately for Ferris, seniors Todd
Dunivant, an outside defender, and central
defender Taylor Graham are returning
starters who will be counted upon to lead
the Cardinal's revamped defense to its
fullest potential.
Along with starting freshman central de
lender Chad Marshall and sophomore out
side defender Aaron Maines, Ferris and
company will bring a defense that has
recorded six shutouts in its eight wins to
I larry Maloney Field on Thursday night at
7:30 p.m. against South Bay rival San Jose

Senior Andrew Terris was invaluable to the Cardinal men's soccer team last season, and he
brings his experience to the squad's hunt for this year's national championship.
State (4-5).
Coming oil a weekend that in
cluded Stanlbrd's only loss of the
season, a shocking % 1 defeat at the
hands of Fulsa, "Terrismo" and the
defense learned many lessons and
will be more inspired to improve as
a unit against the Spartans.
1 his desire to reevaluate and
elevate the level of their play was
evident in the second game of
last weekend's Nike Invitational.
In danger of suffering a com
plete defensive letdown after the
Fulsa loss, the "D" responded
well with a 3-0 shutout victory
over Santa Clara.
Very important in this turn
around are the mind games that
goalies must play in order to
stave oil the demons of defeat
and goals allowed.
"In the 'Fulsa game, lor exam
ple, 1 think the most difficult thing
was to forget what happened in
the game — good or bad," Terris
commented. "I always try to con
centrate on the present moment,
and block off what had occurred in
the past. I hat's the important part
of the goal keeping: grasping the
challenge and not running away
from it."
It is Terris's cool and calm na
ture on the field that has been his
recipe lor success over the past two
seasons. I lowever, ironically, his
serene play is a product of his al
ways having knots in his stomach
before the match.
"I am worried if Fm not nervous
about a game, no matter how big or
small," he said. "II Fin nervous on
the day of the match, I knowlhat I'll
be OK, and I trust myself that I'll be
ready to play well. Once the game
starts, [the nerves] leave. I'm a pret
ty calm goalkeeper, because I thrive
under the calmness."
Also of the same nature is fellow
goalie sophomore Robby Fulton.

('.oath Bret Simon, who calls Fer
ris and Fulton "two of the top-10
goalkeepers in the country," has
used a platoon strategy thus lar
this season. One would think this
plan would spur competition and
negative controversy, but accord
ing to Terris, it couldn't be a bet
ter situation.
"[Robby and myj relationship
has been great," he said. "We've
been really good friends since he's
been a freshman, and there's no
body else that 1 would want to co
goalkeep with. I respect his play a
great deal. As the coach, when you
have two players playing close to
their peak, it's tough not to let ei
ther one play. The team doesn't
miss a beat with either one of us, so
it's been working out well. It can be
an advantage because we can
come off a game emotionally ex
hausted, and it's nice to have a
fresh goalkeeper."
On pace to record more
shutouts than it did last year, Fer
ris, Fulton and the Cardinal look to
be a strong contender for the
NCAA Championship.
"My desire is to win the na
tional championship," Terris
said. "We're getting closer every
year. That would be the crown
ing goal for me to be part of the
first senior class to win a national
championship."
"1 think all four defenders are
coming together well," he con
tinued. "It's early in the season,
so mistakes are made. We're not
100 percent where we need to
be, but we're definitely heading
in that direction. I think that the
team in general is very strong on
paper. We have potential to do
great things."
In order to achieve this goal, the
play of Ail-American striker Roger
Levesque, with a team-leading 22
points, and the rest of the Cardi
nal's vaunted offense is not enough.
Offense wins games but defense
wins championships, so Stanford
also needs a certain calm but profi
cient presence in the net.

in that direction. I think that the

great things."
In order to achieve this goal, the
play of Ail-American striker Roger
Levesque, with a team-leading 22
points, and the rest of the Cardi
nal's vaunted offense is not enough.

vs. San Jose Sfate, Tonight, 7:30 p.m.

To fans everywhere, this was a Her
culean effort. But if you ask goalkeepers
like Cardinal senior Andrew Terris, hav
ing nerves of steel is just part of a net
minder's job.
" The mental game is the majority of
what goalkeeping is all about," he said. "I
don't have any explicit way of forgetting
about mistakes. 1 just focus on the present
and let the game go on. Mistake or not, the
game goes on."
Last season and so far this year, Terris
has developed and matured into one of the
nation's best in the net. It is his play that has
helped the Cardinal (8-1) allow only seven

goals in the nine games so far.
Stanford's average of 0.64 goals al
lowed per game ranked as one of the best
in the nation last year, and Ferris attribut
es this accomplishment to the play of the
team defense.
"In terms of the stats, I think that's a tes
tament to who was playing in front of me
and the kind of team defense that we
played," he said. "Because we played great
defense, I didn't have much work to do. It
made my job easy."
Unfortunately, two important elements
from that defensive squad have moved onto
bigger things, playing Major League Soccer
this year. Standouts Lee Morrison and
Aaron Biddle were staples iu the Cardinal's
strong "D" for many years and will be
missed greatly.
Fortunately for Ferris, seniors Todd
Dunivant, an outside defender, and central
defender Taylor Graham are returning
starters who will be counted upon to lead
the Cardinal's revamped defense to its
fullest potential.
Along with starting freshman central de
lender Chad Marshall and sophomore out
side defender Aaron Maines, Ferris and
company will bring a defense that has
recorded six shutouts in its eight wins to
I larry Maloney Field on Thursday night at
7:30 p.m. against South Bay rival San Jose

Senior Andrew Terris was invaluable to the Cardinal men's soccer team last season, and he

State (4-5).
Coming oil a weekend that in
cluded Stanlbrd's only loss of the
season, a shocking % 1 defeat at the
hands of Fulsa, "Terrismo" and the
defense learned many lessons and
will be more inspired to improve as
a unit against the Spartans.
1 his desire to reevaluate and
elevate the level of their play was
evident in the second game of
last weekend's Nike Invitational.
In danger of suffering a com
plete defensive letdown after the
Fulsa loss, the "D" responded
well with a 3-0 shutout victory
over Santa Clara.
Very important in this turn
around are the mind games that
goalies must play in order to
stave oil the demons of defeat
and goals allowed.
"In the 'Fulsa game, lor exam
ple, 1 think the most difficult thing
was to forget what happened in
the game — good or bad," Terris
commented. "I always try to con
centrate on the present moment,
and block off what had occurred in
the past. I hat's the important part
of the goal keeping: grasping the
challenge and not running away
from it."
It is Terris's cool and calm na
ture on the field that has been his
recipe lor success over the past two
seasons. I lowever, ironically, his
serene play is a product of his al
ways having knots in his stomach
before the match.
"I am worried if Fm not nervous
about a game, no matter how big or
small," he said. "II Fin nervous on
the day of the match, I knowlhat I'll
be OK, and I trust myself that I'll be
ready to play well. Once the game
starts, [the nerves] leave. I'm a pret
ty calm goalkeeper, because I thrive
under the calmness."
Also of the same nature is fellow
goalie sophomore Robby Fulton.

('.oath Bret Simon, who calls Fer
ris and Fulton "two of the top-10
goalkeepers in the country," has
used a platoon strategy thus lar
this season. One would think this
plan would spur competition and
negative controversy, but accord
ing to Terris, it couldn't be a bet
ter situation.
"[Robby and myj relationship
has been great," he said. "We've
been really good friends since he's
been a freshman, and there's no
body else that 1 would want to co
goalkeep with. I respect his play a
great deal. As the coach, when you
have two players playing close to
their peak, it's tough not to let ei
ther one play. The team doesn't
miss a beat with either one of us, so
it's been working out well. It can be
an advantage because we can
come off a game emotionally ex
hausted, and it's nice to have a
fresh goalkeeper."
On pace to record more
shutouts than it did last year, Fer
ris, Fulton and the Cardinal look to
be a strong contender for the
NCAA Championship.
"My desire is to win the na
tional championship," Terris
said. "We're getting closer every
year. That would be the crown
ing goal for me to be part of the
first senior class to win a national
championship."
"1 think all four defenders are
coming together well," he con
tinued. "It's early in the season,
so mistakes are made. We're not
100 percent where we need to
be, but we're definitely heading
in that direction. I think that the
