For sophomore Eleanor Mor

chance to express her mentality
going into the field hockey team's
road trip this weekend: "Take me
to St. Louis!"

Pac) will travel to Missouri this
weekend, playing two games
against Saint Louis (1-7, 0-1
Northern Pacific Athletic Confer

With the win this past weeketid
against NorPac (be Pacific (1-6, 0-
2), the Cardinal moved to the lop
of the NorPac's West Division

with a perfect 2-0 conference
record. Senior defender Tysie
Sawyer scored the only goal of the
game in overtime, assisted by se
nior Amrit Chima.
(ust a half-game behind Stan
lord, with a 1-0 record, is Cal,
which didn't see any NorPac ac
tion last weekend. Stanford and
Cal split the NorPac champi
onship last year.
This weekend's games are cru
cial, according to coach Sheryl
Johnson.
"All of our conference games
are extremely important, and we
have two more coming up this
weekend," said Johnson, who is in
her last year coaching (lie team.
"We look at the next conference
game as the most important game
of the season."
I hc next conference game for
ilie Cardinal is tomorrow against
Saint Louis, a team that has strug
gled against nonconference and
NorPac competition alike with a
I -7 combined record.
Stanford, on the other hand,
while having trouble earlier in the
year on a New York road trip, has
won 12 out of its last 14 games
against NorPac competition. It
has dominated opposition by an
astounding advantage in shots
(18;}-105), penalty corners (113-
82) and penalty strokes (4-8 to I-
I). However, Stanford only has a
pi us-3 margin in goals scored and
has dropped six games out of its
past nine overall.
Stanford faces off with SW Mis
souri State, another team that has

struggled against weaker compe
tition, in Saint Louis on Saturday.
Rounding out the Missouri ad
venture, Stanford will face Saint
Louis for the second time in three
days when the teams play on
Monday.
After the Cardinal's Missouri
trip, all eyes turn to the Oct. 12
Saturday showdown against Cal

at Berkeley. The outcome of the
game will have direct conse
quences on the final outcome of
the NoiTac standings.
Stanford has three games to
go before meeting Cal, and as se
