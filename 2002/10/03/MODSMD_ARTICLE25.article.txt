# Cardinal, not Cardinals you idiot
## 
### 
We've all got certain
things that make us
cringe. For me, the
sound of forks sc rap
ing against teeth in the dining hall,
the sight of Redskins no-longer
back-up quarterback Danny
Wuerflel under center and the
taste of split-pea soup are but a lew.
lint does it bother you as much
as it does me when everyone and
their mothers refer to our sports
teams as the Stanford Cardinals?
You may find it lame or weird
tli.it the Stanford nickname is a
color, and you may be confused
that our "unofficial" mascot is a
drinking, er, dancing tree rather
than, say, a giant walking crayon.
I lie fact remains, however,
that as the Cardinal we are the
one and only Cardinal of the
sports world.
Add the Y and Stanford joins
" fhey-beat-Florida-State?"
Louisville and "What-state-is-
Ball-anyway" Ball State in the col
lege ranks as having "Cardinals"
as a nickname.
Now 1 don't have anything
against birds or even the letter's',
but it's the principle of the blun
der that bothers me. Is there a
misprint in half of the Stanford
media guides that we don't know
about? Honestly, how difficult is
it to say Cardinal?
The Cardinal has the most oft
butchered team name in college
sports. Do you ever hear Dart
mouth referred to as the Big
Creens, (Cornell as the Big Reds or
Harvard as the Crimsons? Hold
up, does Harvard even play
sports?
Did you ever wonder exactly
what the difference in hue be-

tween Cardinal!
and Crimson is
anyway?
Crimson is de
fined as a deep
red, somewhat in
clining towards
purple, the color
of an alkaline infu
sion of cochineal.

Cardinal is defined as the color
of an alkaline infusion of kicking
Cal's ass.
Correctly pronounced color
ful nicknames are not unique to
Ivy League schools — or faux Ivy
Leaguers like us — either. Alaba
ma's teams are the Crimson l idc,
and Tulane is the Creen Wave.
Nobody messes up the freakin'
Scarlet Knights of Rutgers! You
get the point.
So what's the deal when it
comes to Stanford?
Cranted, our official nick
name used (Cardinals — although
it still wasn't in reference to the
bird — from 10712 to 1981. But
for the past 21 years, it's been
Cardinal, 's'-less and bird-less,
the way it should be.
After all, we were the Cardinal
first and foremost when local
newspapers deemed us so after the
1891 Big Came. It remained that
way until Indians was officially
adopted in 1930. Hut I digress .. .
The alarming prevalence of
the mistake (we'll call it the Car
dinals sin) extends to the written
word as well. Look no further
than one of the most easily acces
sible, naturally occurring repre
sentative samples of the popula
tion — Fbay.
Ebay sellers are notorious
"Cardinals" sinners. A recent

search for "Stanford Cardinals"
turned up 40 results, only seven
fewer results than a search of the
proper name turned up.
Fven more ridiculous is the
surprise one encounters upon
viewing an item, only to find the
word "Cardinals" emblazoned
across unlicensed Stanford mer
chandise such as hats, pennants
and polo shirts.
1 bid on, and won, a pennant
from the 1986 Gator Bowl, which
Stanford lost to Clemson, 27-21.
"Stanford" is written horizontally
in block letters across the front
and "Cardinals" is written verti
cally down the side.
What makes the pennant the
official logo of the "Say My Name"
campaign (more on that in a
minute) is the image of what looks
like a deformed lighting Cardinal
(a bird, just to be clear here) hov
ering above a sketch of the Gator
Bowl. No wonder our featherless
friends lost the game; they
weren't even playing in it — the
Cardinals were.
The aforementioned "Say My
Name" campaign is quite simple.
Anytime you hear someone utter
tlie word Cardinals when refer
ring to any of Stanford's teams,
flip them the bird, so to speak,
and repeat the words "Say my
name, (insert name or noun of
your choice here)."
For broadcasters and other in
accessible media members, color
fully worded e-mails will suffice.
And please, while you're at it,
don't scrape your forks.

Scott Allen once killed a man for say
ing "Cardinals." We swear. He can
