# Lies in Sports Illustrated are big and bright

Don't mess with Texas?
Please. II there ever
were a place whose in
habitants were deluded
about their superiority, it is the
Lone Star State.
Texas pride is out of hand,
lexans love that everything in
their state is big. Big land mass, big
oil rigs, big sky.
Let's not forget the other "bigs"
in Texas, namely, beer bellies,
trucks, gun racks, hats and belt
buckles.
Despite the fact that they live in
a dust bowl, l exans have main
tained a fantasy that their state is
somehow blessed

with beauty from
on high. "God's
country," they
call it.
Yeah. Right.
Perhaps it is
this arrogance
that sparked my
irritation with
Texas. Maybe it

was being forced to watch the ob
noxious Longhorn fans exulting
after their team beat Stanford in
the College World Series â€” twice.
Whatever first kindled my ire,
seeing Sports Illustrated ranking
Texas as the nation's best sports
program over the Cardinal threw
gas on the flame (not that a true
Texan would ever use lighter
fluid; I must admit, their barbe
cueing is excellent).
So why would the nation's most
popular sporting magazine choose
a school whose fans shout "Hook
'em horns!" over Stanford, where
one hears, "Run! Run! Increase
the aggregate yardage!"?
Alright, bad example.
Throwing common sense and
Sears Cups out the window, SI
proclaimed Texas to be No. 1 be
cause "the Longhorns performed
slightly better than the Cardinal
in the big-ticket sports like foot
ball and because their fans ap
proach sports with just a touch

more fervor."
The pundits just may have a
point here.
Imagine, if you will, a split
screen television.
One half shows the devoted
Sixth Man crowd forming a sinu
ous line in front of Maples Pavil
ion, eagerly awaiting the game.
The other half shows the faithful
Longhorns in front of their own
basketball venue (1 don't know
what it's called, and I don't care).
The more observant among
you will note that one side of your
screen contains a vastly greater

quantity of printed material.
1 lardback, paperback and spiral
bound books abound.
What are these mysterious doc
uments, you wonder?
Playbooks, so that the fans can
more intelligently follow the game
action? Media guides, so that they
can analyze every move the oppo
nent makes and offer helpful hints
to Mike Montgomery?
Of course not. These are course
readers and textbooks.
After all, what better opportuni
ty is there to brush up on your
multivariable calculus for that

midterm in two weeks than while
waiting in line for the game? Time
is precious.
Let's be honest. It's hard to
spare that first half of a basketball
or football game when there are
problem sets to be done.
Less spirited we may be, but at
least we spare a salamander a fiery
death in a pre-BigGame inferno.
