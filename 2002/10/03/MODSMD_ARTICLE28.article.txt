# Notre Dame finally gets 4-0 record from the BCS
## 
### 
(AP) — Notre Dame is 4-0 in the eyes ol
the Bowl Championship Series after all.
Reversing a decision made less than
two weeks ago, the BCS said yesterday
that the win by the Fighting Irish over
Maryland in the Kickoff Classic will count
toward qualifying fora BCS bowl game.
The change means the ninth-ranked
Irish are now live wins away from qualify
ing for one of two at-large berths for BCS
bowl games — Fiesta, Rose, Orange and
Sugar. Under BCS rules, teams must have
nine "nonexempt" wins to earn a chance
to play in a BCS game.
Until this season, the first 19 Kickoff

Classics, along with all the other "presea
son classic" games were considered "ex
empt." However, since the date of the
Notre Dame-Maryland game was
changed to Aug. 31 from Aug. 24, it took
place after the NCAA's window of exempt
games.
On Monday, Notre Dame athletic direc
tor Kevin White informed BCS coordina
tor and Big East commissioner Mike
Tranghese that the NCAA ruled the game
should not be exempt. A conference call
followed with Tranghese, White and the
live other BCS commissioners _ from the
ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-lOand SEC.

"With that, the commissioners felt the
Notre Dame game should not be exempt,"
BCS spokesman John Paquette said
Wednesday. "Notre Dame will be able to
count the win toward qualifying for the at
large pool of nine wins."
Irish coach Tyrone Willingham said he
was not surprised by the decision.
"It's really the same position that we've
held all the time," he said.
I he six conference champions receive
automatic bids to the BCS bowls, with two
at-large teams selected. Notre Dame fin
ished 9-2 in 2000 and played Oregon
State in the Fiesta Bowl.

Willingham said the ruling doesn't re
ally change anything for the Irish.
"For any of this to have any impact on
our football team, we have to get there,
and it's a long way before we get to that
point. If you don't win, it's a moot
point," he said.
Besides gaining a victory this week, the
Irish also were ranked No. 1 in the New
York rimes and the Atlanta Journal-Con
stitution Colley Matrix computer polls.
"Just look at the next poll, Ok," was
Willingham's reaction. "You don't get car
ried away with any of that. Our guys can
see those examples all around them."
