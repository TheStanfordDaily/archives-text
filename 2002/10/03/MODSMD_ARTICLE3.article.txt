# Stanford targeted for 'anti-Israel bias'

### JOANNA PETRONE 
Stanford is among IK universities targeted
for "anti-Israel bias" by a watchdog organiza
tion that many in academia perceive as a
threat to freedom of expression.
The stated goal of the new organization,
(lampus Watch, is "to improve Middle Eastern
studies in North America" by targeting "anti-
Israel and anti-American bias" in academia.
"Stanford students are getting a very poor in
terpretation of the Middle East, an extremist
viewpoint that doesn't tolerate other viewpoints
. .. Stanford students should be concerned,"
said Campus Watch founder Daniel Pipes.
Since its inception this year. Campus
Watch has been awash with controversy, as a
large number of students and professors op
pose the organization's policy of naming and
"monitoring" suspect universities, professors
and student activists.
Stanford Prof . |oel Beinin, who was one of
the professors (lampus Watch originally post
ed a dossier on, said, "1 his sort of McCarthy
style list- making and 'monitoring' has no
place in university life, as its purpose is to in
timidate people from expressing their views
and to set boundaries on permissible speech."
The Campus Watch Web site states,
"American scholars, to varying degrees, reject
the views of most Americans and the endur
ing policies of the U.S. government about the
Middle East."
Pipes said that this problem was brought

to the surface last year with "the publication
of Martin Kramer's book, 'Ivory lowers on
Sand' . . . [which] lays out the case that Mid
dle East studies are seriously flawed." Pipes
also pointed to the anti-Israel campus
demonstrations of last spring as impetus for
starting Campus Watch.
Campus Watch's Web site says, " This bias
[in Middle Kastern Studies] seems to stem from
two main causes. First, academics seem gener
ally to dislike their own country and think even

less of American allies abroad .... Second,
Middle East studies in the United States has be
come the preserve of Middle Eastern Arabs,
who have brought their views with them."
"It is not so much bias we are interested in
[examining] so much as shoddy work, apolo
getic claims, extremism and intolerance in the
curriculum," Pipes said.
But almost as soon as Campus Watch was
launched, so was concerned and vocal oppo
sition. Judith Butler, a UC-Berkeley profes
sor, decided to "turn in" her own dossier to
Campus Watch and asked to be named on the
Web site.
In the letter Butler wrote to Campus
Watch, she said, "I have recently learned that
your organization is compiling dossiers on
professors . . . who oppose the Israeli occupa
tion and its brutality, actively support Pales
tinian rights of self-determination as well as a
more informed and intelligent view of Islam
than is currently represented by the U.S.
media .... I would be enormously honored
to be counted among those [professors]."
Similar letters from professors and students
asking to be listed have been pouring in over
the last few months, said Pipes and others.
"|\Ve| no longer have dossiers monitoring
professors on our Web site. There was a large
amount of criticism about the dossiers, so in a
gesture ofcordiality, we withdrew them," said
Pipes.
