# Stanford targeted for 'anti-Israel bias'
## 
### JOANNA PETRONE 
Stanford is among IK universities targeted
for "anti-Israel bias" by a watchdog organiza
tion that many in academia perceive as a
threat to freedom of expression.
The stated goal of the new organization,
(lampus Watch, is "to improve Middle Eastern
studies in North America" by targeting "anti-
Israel and anti-American bias" in academia.
"Stanford students are getting a very poor in
terpretation of the Middle East, an extremist
viewpoint that doesn't tolerate other viewpoints
. .. Stanford students should be concerned,"
said Campus Watch founder Daniel Pipes.
Since its inception this year. Campus
Watch has been awash with controversy, as a
large number of students and professors op
pose the organization's policy of naming and
"monitoring" suspect universities, professors
and student activists.
Stanford Prof . |oel Beinin, who was one of
the professors (lampus Watch originally post
ed a dossier on, said, "1 his sort of McCarthy
style list- making and 'monitoring' has no
place in university life, as its purpose is to in
timidate people from expressing their views
and to set boundaries on permissible speech."
The Campus Watch Web site states,
"American scholars, to varying degrees, reject
the views of most Americans and the endur
ing policies of the U.S. government about the
Middle East."
Pipes said that this problem was brought

to the surface last year with "the publication
of Martin Kramer's book, 'Ivory lowers on
Sand' . . . [which] lays out the case that Mid
dle East studies are seriously flawed." Pipes
also pointed to the anti-Israel campus
demonstrations of last spring as impetus for
starting Campus Watch.
Campus Watch's Web site says, " This bias
[in Middle Kastern Studies] seems to stem from
two main causes. First, academics seem gener
ally to dislike their own country and think even

less of American allies abroad .... Second,
Middle East studies in the United States has be
come the preserve of Middle Eastern Arabs,
who have brought their views with them."
"It is not so much bias we are interested in
[examining] so much as shoddy work, apolo
getic claims, extremism and intolerance in the
curriculum," Pipes said.
But almost as soon as Campus Watch was
launched, so was concerned and vocal oppo
sition. Judith Butler, a UC-Berkeley profes
sor, decided to "turn in" her own dossier to
Campus Watch and asked to be named on the
Web site.
In the letter Butler wrote to Campus
Watch, she said, "I have recently learned that
your organization is compiling dossiers on
professors . . . who oppose the Israeli occupa
tion and its brutality, actively support Pales
tinian rights of self-determination as well as a
more informed and intelligent view of Islam
than is currently represented by the U.S.
media .... I would be enormously honored
to be counted among those [professors]."
Similar letters from professors and students
asking to be listed have been pouring in over
the last few months, said Pipes and others.
"|\Ve| no longer have dossiers monitoring
professors on our Web site. There was a large
amount of criticism about the dossiers, so in a
gesture ofcordiality, we withdrew them," said
Pipes.

Even some who do not agree
with Butler's views on the* Israel-
Palestine conflict say that Campus
Watch's methods seem to be
aimed at discouraging freedom of
expression.
"1 support freedom of speech,
and so I'm glad to be in the com
pany of those other professors,
but it's bewildering thai they
have put me on this list," Juan R.
I. Cole, a professor of history at
the University of Michigan, Ann
Arbor, told the Chronicle of
1 ligher Education.
Cole, who says he is "an out
spoken hawk in the war on ter
ror," also noted that he lias writ
ten very little on the subject of the
Israel- Palest i ne conflict.
"It is ludicrous that Campus
Watch could inhibit anyone's
freedom of speech," Pipes said in
response to such criticism. "We
are a tiny little think tank. We're
not the F. 8.1. It is typical of acad
emics to try to shut [Campus
Watch] down with this argument
instead of responding to the is
sues we raise."
But Beinin and others claim
that their opinions are already
available to the public.
"The best way to determine
what bias 1 might have is to read
my published work or listen to
my lectures," Beinin said.
David Weddle, a Religious

Studies professor at Colorado
College who was also named on
the site, expressed a similar senti
ment in an interview with the
Colorado Springs Independent.
"Viewpoints 1 have on the
Middle East are publicly available
. . . . I am more than happy to
make them public ," Weddle said.
Regarding Campus Watch's
influence on Middle Kast dis
course, Beinin said, "It is already
difficult to have a serious discus
sion of Middle East issues, and
the range of opinion expressed in
the mass media is very narrow.
But that was already the case be
fore Campus Watch appeared."
"Daniel Pipes has been making
crude and defamatory statements
about people he disagrees with for
years," he added. "Campus Watch
is only the latest of his efforts."
As to how Campus Watch will
effect freedom of expression at
universities, Beinin said it "de
pends on the actions of each uni
versity administration."
Beinin expressed confidence
that Stanford, however, will not
be affected by Campus Watch's
accusations.
"Campus Watch will almost
certainly have no impact at Stan
ford," he said. "The University in
general and the History Depart
ment in particular have an excel
lent record of upholding acade
mic freedom on Middle East is
sues.
"Stanford people are too so
phisticated and principled to take
something like this seriously."
