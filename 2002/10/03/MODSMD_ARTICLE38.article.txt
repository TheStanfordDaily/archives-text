# Overpolished OK Go blows
## 
### NICK STONE 
OK Go — what went wrong?
These plucky chaps tried like all
the rest to mash the Talking
Heads, the Beatles and the Pix
ies into a

crunchy guitar
rock format.
The audible
influences are
solid but the
end result is
too many

clowns in one
little car, a slick, polished and
mostly forgettable album.
Hooks aplenty, mild Ozma /
Rentals new wave keyboards,
tastefully overdubbed backup
vocals and guitar solos: Con
gratulations, OK Go, you have
mastered the magic formula.
Meanwhile, the singer tries for
David Bowie and settles for a
sort of nasal, more sarcastic
Momus — from charming to
tedious in under five minutes.
In all fairness, the lyric sheet
occasionally yields some clever
material ("Sweetheart, you'll
find / Mediocre people do ex
ceptional things all the time!")
amid the usual sensitive-white
dude clunkers like "When we
moved to the city, / It seemed
the competition / Got so much
less pretty / But the mirror's
never failed you like this be
fore." This band is catchy and
good-looking enough; they've
got the handclaps and the pop
sensibilities and all the rest;
maybe it's that there's too damn

much of it.
It doesn't take much for hooks
to become Pepsi ads, or tor over
production to wreck perfectly
good songs. At times this music
sounds laminated Look out all
you rock n' rollers!

Look to Chuck
Berry or the Ra
mones for inspira
tion! Keep it sim
ple! Where are the
bands that will
loosen up and con-

centrate on the ba
sics — like rhythm and sounding
like you're having fun? Where
are the heirs to the fine legacy of
Chicago's Teen Wolf, who write
hilarious songs about hypercolor
and child molesters on acoustic
guitar and toy xylophones, and
who actually smile a lot while
playing? Where are the chal
lengers to the Please, San Fran
cisco's chic one-up on the
Strokes, who play guitar lines
you can actually dance to, and
who know when less is more?
OK GO — go to Motown for
a few weeks. Consarnit, rock
and roll songs should be short,
sweet, and sexy, and if they
can't be that, then at the bare
minimum let them be strange
and unpredictable. Btit that's
just one opinion. In all honesty,
this is quite a good cd. I'm just
so sick of this kind of music.
Nevertheless, friends have ad
vised me that OK GO is a fine
band in the upbeat
Weezer/Tahiti 80 power-pop
vein and to lighten up.
