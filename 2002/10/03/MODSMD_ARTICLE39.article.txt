# 'Deadsy is bigger than Jesus'
## 
### NASTASSIA LOPEZ 
Years ahead of the pop, rock and alternative that
has hit today's mainstream airwaves, comes a band that
transcends the boundaries of not only music, but also
the demarcations of both art and culture. Deadsy, a
revolutionary work in progress, emerged from the
psyche of lead singer I'. Lxeter Blue (aka: Elijah Blue
Allman), who considers himself a scholar and inquisi
tor of all things occult and otherworldly. The band's
sound — a culmination of synth-pop, metal, and goth
— classifies Deadsy into a whole different sub genre on
it's own; something Blue labels as "Undercore." The
band's intricate iconography and complete personifi
cation of humanity's five basic elements, demonstrate

that Deadsy is a highly
educated band with in
telligent lyrics and a fas
cination with exposing
and exploring the un
known facets of hu
manity.
Their first album,
"Commencement,"
was released in May,
and subsequently in
duced a nationwide
cult-like following.
With lyrics like, "Let's
take the longest way to
the hallways of your
mind / Upon your
knees, the phantom
breeze of a shipwreck
lost in time," Deadsy
surpasses the norm
and taps into the virgin
territory of abject and
profound subject mat
ter. Songs like "Man
sion World," "Win-

ners" and"The Key To Grammercy Park" are exam
ples of some of Deadsy's most pronouncedcoinposi
tions. (There is also a kick ass rendition of Rush's
"Tom Sawyer" on the album.)
Deadsy has been playing sold out shows across the
United States, sharing the stage with bands such as
Koßn, Stone Temple Pilots and Taproot. Recently I
had a chance to sit down with Blue and discuss the
band and its fruition.
INTERMISSION: How long ago was Deadsy con
ceived?
BLUE: We made our first demo in 1995 — it's a far
cry from what it has become. Four years later, we
were signed to Dreamworks / Elementree Records.
INTERMISSION: And how did you come up with
the concept for the band?
BLUE: I feel like there's this huge gap for some
thing particular like Deadsy. 1 wanted to have each
one of the band members personify five different
aspects of pillars of art. Those five themes being
Academia, Science and Medicine, Leisure, War and
Horror. Through those five entities we are able ex
plore every avenue of humanity.
INTERMISSION: Musically, who are some of
Deadsy's biggest influences?
BLUE: Musically, we're influenced by Black Sabbath,
U2, Bowie, Brian Eno, Metallica — an array of death
metal, like Morbid Angel — also some late 70's Euro
pean synth pop music, like Gary Newman, Joy Divi
sion. We hope to carry on the spirit and innovation of
music like that, and also level their innovation.
INTERMISSION: Culturally, what has the band
been influenced by?
BLUE: Definitely many aspects of culture — the un
known, the unexplored. Literature. We're influ

enced by metaphysical systems, arcane, ancient cul
tures and the human story over the last one million
years. Deadsy doesn't lit into the chronology of
music, but the chronology of humanity and that will
become more apparent too.
INTERMISSION: How do you conjure your ideas
and concepts for your songs?
BLUE: Instinct. It comes to me. I am open enough
to tap into a lot of forces. I believe that you're preor
dained to be open to anything. It's not necessarily
from ego, but from the ability to be in touch with the
supernatural almost. 1 know what is going to impact
people, and 1 let what's above and beyond me into my
heart and let it out through my sound and vision.

INTERMISSION: What is the purpose for Deadsy's
symbols and iconography?
BLUE: There is a symbol for each band member.
Academia is represented by P. Exeter Blue (lead
singer and guitarist), Science and Medicine by Dr.
Nner (keyboards), Horror by creature (bass), War
by Carlton Megalodon (synth guitar) and Leisure by
Alec Pure (drums). Iconography is essential if you
are going to represent culture and humanity.
INTERMISSION: What song or songs are you most
proud of on Commencement?
BLUE: "Gramercy," "Winners," and the actual song
"Commencement" — it's fucking really weird and re
ally cool.
INTERMISSION: What is Deadsy's ultimate goal in
the grander scheme of society, art and music in gen
eral?
BLUE: To keep ascending as a range of influence
and, most importantly, grow. We want to move onto
a new saga. We'll see how far it goes, and ultimately it
will go pretty far.
INTERMISSION: In what direction is Deadsy head
ed for the second cd?
BLUE: [The cd will be] way more of a complete
thought, way more aware of itself. It's going to incor
porate the entity structure of the band and have a lot
more concept and theme. Songs themselves are
going to be better songs. The second cd will be built
fora pop culture impact and really infiltrate [pop cul
ture], without being "poppy" in that sense.
INTERMISSION: When will you be touring again?
BLUE: To support our next single [Brand New
Love] in November.

thought, way more aware of itself. It's going to incor
porate the entity structure of the band and have a lot
more concept and theme. Songs themselves are
going to be better songs. The second cd will be built
fora pop culture impact and really infiltrate [pop cul
ture], without being "poppy" in that sense.
INTERMISSION: When will you be touring again?
BLUE: To support our next single [Brand New
Love] in November.


Nu-metal saviors or posh boarding school chums — from OUTER SPACE?!?
Years ahead of the pop, rock and alternative that
has hit today's mainstream airwaves, comes a band that
transcends the boundaries of not only music, but also
the demarcations of both art and culture. Deadsy, a
revolutionary work in progress, emerged from the
psyche of lead singer I'. Lxeter Blue (aka: Elijah Blue
Allman), who considers himself a scholar and inquisi
tor of all things occult and otherworldly. The band's
sound — a culmination of synth-pop, metal, and goth
— classifies Deadsy into a whole different sub genre on
it's own; something Blue labels as "Undercore." The
band's intricate iconography and complete personifi
cation of humanity's five basic elements, demonstrate

that Deadsy is a highly
educated band with in
telligent lyrics and a fas
cination with exposing
and exploring the un
known facets of hu
manity.
Their first album,
"Commencement,"
was released in May,
and subsequently in
duced a nationwide
cult-like following.
With lyrics like, "Let's
take the longest way to
the hallways of your
mind / Upon your
knees, the phantom
breeze of a shipwreck
lost in time," Deadsy
surpasses the norm
and taps into the virgin
territory of abject and
profound subject mat
ter. Songs like "Man
sion World," "Win-

ners" and"The Key To Grammercy Park" are exam
ples of some of Deadsy's most pronouncedcoinposi
tions. (There is also a kick ass rendition of Rush's
"Tom Sawyer" on the album.)
Deadsy has been playing sold out shows across the
United States, sharing the stage with bands such as
Koßn, Stone Temple Pilots and Taproot. Recently I
had a chance to sit down with Blue and discuss the
band and its fruition.
INTERMISSION: How long ago was Deadsy con
ceived?
BLUE: We made our first demo in 1995 — it's a far
cry from what it has become. Four years later, we
were signed to Dreamworks / Elementree Records.
INTERMISSION: And how did you come up with
the concept for the band?
BLUE: I feel like there's this huge gap for some
thing particular like Deadsy. 1 wanted to have each
one of the band members personify five different
aspects of pillars of art. Those five themes being
Academia, Science and Medicine, Leisure, War and
Horror. Through those five entities we are able ex
plore every avenue of humanity.
INTERMISSION: Musically, who are some of
Deadsy's biggest influences?
BLUE: Musically, we're influenced by Black Sabbath,
U2, Bowie, Brian Eno, Metallica — an array of death
metal, like Morbid Angel — also some late 70's Euro
pean synth pop music, like Gary Newman, Joy Divi
sion. We hope to carry on the spirit and innovation of
music like that, and also level their innovation.
INTERMISSION: Culturally, what has the band
been influenced by?
BLUE: Definitely many aspects of culture — the un
known, the unexplored. Literature. We're influ

enced by metaphysical systems, arcane, ancient cul
tures and the human story over the last one million
years. Deadsy doesn't lit into the chronology of
music, but the chronology of humanity and that will
become more apparent too.
INTERMISSION: How do you conjure your ideas
and concepts for your songs?
BLUE: Instinct. It comes to me. I am open enough
to tap into a lot of forces. I believe that you're preor
dained to be open to anything. It's not necessarily
from ego, but from the ability to be in touch with the
supernatural almost. 1 know what is going to impact
people, and 1 let what's above and beyond me into my
heart and let it out through my sound and vision.

INTERMISSION: What is the purpose for Deadsy's
symbols and iconography?
BLUE: There is a symbol for each band member.
Academia is represented by P. Exeter Blue (lead
singer and guitarist), Science and Medicine by Dr.
Nner (keyboards), Horror by creature (bass), War
by Carlton Megalodon (synth guitar) and Leisure by
Alec Pure (drums). Iconography is essential if you
are going to represent culture and humanity.
INTERMISSION: What song or songs are you most
proud of on Commencement?
BLUE: "Gramercy," "Winners," and the actual song
"Commencement" — it's fucking really weird and re
ally cool.
INTERMISSION: What is Deadsy's ultimate goal in
the grander scheme of society, art and music in gen
eral?
BLUE: To keep ascending as a range of influence
and, most importantly, grow. We want to move onto
a new saga. We'll see how far it goes, and ultimately it
will go pretty far.
INTERMISSION: In what direction is Deadsy head
ed for the second cd?
BLUE: [The cd will be] way more of a complete
thought, way more aware of itself. It's going to incor
porate the entity structure of the band and have a lot
