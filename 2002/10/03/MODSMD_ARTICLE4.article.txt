fhe newly redesigned Stan
lord.cdu Wei) site was launched
into cyberspace yesterday at 12:45

p.m. Web Managing Editor Andy
Krackov called the site — which
offers a contemporary appear
ance, an improved navigation sys
tem and several new features —
the "front door to Stanford."
"It was incumbent upon us to
come up with a new look," Krack
ov said. The old site, which had be
come dated due to increases in in
ternet traffic and advances in Web
technology, had been in use for

three and a half years.
Krackov and his team began
working on ihe new Web site, in
cluding 20-to-30 prototype de
signs, about eight months ago.
Upon first glance at the current
design, one no longer sees the
image of the view down Palm
Drive, but rather "a more dynam
ic, diverse collection of pictures,"
said Alan Acosta, director of Uni
versity communications.
The Web site team wanted to
use the old photo, Krackov said,
but they found that it was limiting:
"It was like an elephant in the liv
ing room," he said.
At least one student was less
than eager to see the elephant ush
ered out the door.
" I will miss seeing that majestic
photo of Palm Drive," said sopho
more Rebecca Neil.
Graphic Designer Anna Cobb
said that in designing the home
page, "we wanted to make it clean,
easy to use, fun, exciting, but yet
show the history and breadth of
Stanford. The goal is to show Stan
ford's ideal of excellence across the
board."
Work on the Web site also in
volved the creation of a new navi
gation system.
"We wanted to think of a com
prehensive navigation that gives as
much information as possible in

the first views . .. without being
overwhelming," said Web Assis
tant Editor Courtney Young.
To design the new navigation,
the Web site team, including sever
al student interns, first examined
Web sites of other universities and
businesses, and did extensive re
search oil the old Web site's hits.
For example, the black box at
the top left of the old site was found
to be repeatedly missed by users.
As a result, the links previously in
the box were relocated into large
rollover menus, which display ex
panded lists of categories.
I he rollover menus are an "ex
citing addition to the site . . . they
provide shortcuts to the pertinent
and most used sites," according to
Young.
Another new feature is "On the
Stanford Web," a thumbnail image
at the bottom oft he Web site, which
highlights "various Stanford Web
sites that we think are compelling
and engaging," said Young.
About 20 different sites concern
ing student activities, research and
teaching are on rotation. Krackov
said that the Web sites would be re
freshed on a quarterly basis and that
people are welcome to nominate
other Web sites to be displayed.
