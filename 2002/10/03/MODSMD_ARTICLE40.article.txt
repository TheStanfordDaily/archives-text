# Geeky Fanboy meets
## SLEATER-KINNEY 
### ANTHONY HA 
"Hello?"
"Hi, this is Anthony Ha from The Stan
ford Daily ... Is this Corin?"
"Yes, it is."
"Oh ... wow."
Not the most professional way to start an
interview, but hey, I was talking to a mem
ber of Sleater-motherfucking-Kinney! I've
always been a geeky fanboy at heart, so it
was inevitable that hearing the voice of
Corin Tucker-whose powerful singing
dominates many of Sleater-Kinney's finest
recordings — would reduce me to virtual
incoherence.
Quite possibly the best band playing
today, the group has been riding high on a
crest of critical adulation since "Call the
Doctor" (199(5) and "Dig Me Out" (1997).
The reception of the moody, experimental
"The Hot Rock" (1999) and its poppier fol
low-up "All Hands on the Bad One" (2000)
was more mixed, but One Beat, the band's
recently released sixth album, finds Sleater-
Kinney back at the top of its form, fueling its
still-growing musical sophistication with
fiery defiance.
1 showed np a little late to this party. I still
know basically nothing about the riot grrl
movement from which Sleater-kinney
sprang in the early-'9os; when I first picked
up a copy of "All Hands on the Band One"
last year, few things could have been farther
from my personal experience than, say,
Bikini kill's kathleen Hanna on stage,
shrieking, "I might make you rape me!"
Still, "You're No Rock'n'Roll Fun" and
other standout tracks from "All Hands"
piqued my curiosity.
My next purchase — the angry, distortion
heavy "("all the Doctor" — was even better,
but it was "Dig Me Out" that felt like a reve
lation. Bob Dylan once compared listening
to Elvis with breaking out of jail, and that
description is the closest I can get to recap
turing the intensity of the first time I heard
"The Drama You've Been Craving": Tuck
er yelling, "kick it in!" while fellow vocal
ist/guitarist Carrie Brownstein interjects,

"Out!", botli of them pulled
forward by the slashing gui
tars and Janet Weiss's
propulsive drumming.
While the band's record
ings feature intelligent,
often pointedly political
lyrics, the music is the key to
both its politics and its emo
tional power — I love the di
alogue created by Tucker
and Brownstein's intertwin
ing voices, but far more im
portant is the way words,
guitars and drums join to
create a feeling of liberation,
of feminism and the need
for social change as felt
knowledge rather than ab
stract ideas.
Sleater-Kinney delivered
that feeling in spades on
Sept. 23 at the Fillmore in
San Francisco. Most of the
tunes played were tracks

from the Sept. 11-influenced "One Beat,"
including the bubbly "Oh!", the mocking
protest song "Combat Rock" and the "shake
a tail for peace and love" anthem "Step
Aside." There were also old favorites from
every Sleater-kinney album since "Call the
Doctor," the juxtaposition of the raw "Call
the Doctor" with the polished, complex
"Step Aside" served as a good demonstra
tion of how much the band has grown in the
past six years.
For me, the concert was a chance to jump
up and down to the music of my favorite
band, chanting "Dig me out, dig me in, /
Outta my body, outta my skin," along with
Tucker, free from but not unaware of all the
troubles of the world. However, for the girl
behind me, who sang "Call the Doctor" 's
opening lines ("They want to socialize you, /
They want to purify you, / They want to dig
nify and analyze and terrorize you!") with
the passion and feeling of a true believer,
the concert was clearly something deeper
and more personal; for many, Sleater-kin
ney is not just a damn good band, but a truly
necessary one.
A month earlier, I spoke briefly to Tuck
er about the new album, protest songs and
her feelings about Sleater-Kinney's growing
exposure in the mainstream media.
INTERMISSION: When you were writing
"One Beat," was there a conscious decision
to do a lot of songs that addressed Sept. 11.
in some way?
CORIN TUCKER: Um, there wasn't really
a conscious decision to do that. I think that
it was just such as an overwhelming pres
ence in our minds as we were trying to write
songs, that we felt that we really needed to
deal with it, and that we really needed to
write about it. Especially "Combat Rock."
That was the most conscious song in terms
of the intense wave of nationalism and pa
triotism that was.happening. It was really
frightening. We were just surprised that
people weren't speaking out about it more
than they were, and we decided to write
about it ourselves.

INTERMISSION: Given that there's such a
nationalistic, flag-waving attitude, were you
worried at all about the response to that
song?
TUCKER: Yeah, we were. I remember at
the time saying, "This might be a really con
troversial song." But we just fell like we
need to do it, and that free speech is really
important, you know, that we need to rec
ognize that. For us the whole country is, "Go
war!"
INTERMISSION: Both on "One Beat" and
on your albums in the past, a lot of your
songs have been about how music is one of
the really big forces in dissent and protest.
Could you talk a little bit about how you see
the role of music in dissent?
TUCKER: I think that we might describe
ourselves as cultural activists, in terms of the
fact that the culture around us is really im
portant, although we might not necessarily
be involved in political activism, in terms of
putting people on the ballot or whatever.
Just making music and making art that
speaks out about the world around yon is re
ally important and it's been historically im
portant. So I think that we ourselves are in
spired by that music and art. We in turn try
to carry that sensibility with us when we're
writing songs, without carrying it too heavi
ly and putting the message before the music
— I think that we want to write about some
thing that moves us.
INTERMISSION: When you write songs
like "Step Aside" or "Words -I- Guitar,"
which focus on the liberating power of
music, are there any bands or types of music
in particular that you have in mind?
TUCKER: For me, personally, on "Step
Aside" I was thinking about Lulu. Janet
said, "We need to write a dance song for this

record," and it was kind of her idea: "Go
and write something really danceable for
this record." So Carrie and I came up with a
really bare bones idea, and then we all came
together, and we had to work on it a lot to
come up with it. And we started getting a re
ally '60s sound to it. That was when 1 was,
like, "I wanna sound like Lulu!" We're real
ly influenced by so many bands, 1 think, in
general.
INTERMISSION: Although you're defi
nitely not "mainstream," the band has been
covered in the New York rimes and Time
Magazine, and I was just wondering how
you felt about that kind of mainstream ex
posure. Are you worried about being de
fanged and co-opted the way riot grrrl was?
TUCKER: I think that we sort of see both
sides of it. We're sometimes worried that a
writer or the magazine or whatever is not
going to get what we're about, but at the
same time it's important for us to have ex
posure, to get out there and sell records and
also introduce people that might not be in a
subculture scene to our ideas and music. I
think that we sort of take it with a grain of
salt. We're most concerned about our
music, and that's what we're worried about;
the press stuff is much more secondary.
INTERMISSION: On each successive
album your music has become more adven
turous and has started to incorporate a lot
more styles. What kind of factors feed into
that?
TUCKER: I think that we all have really dif
ferent tastes in music and an eclectic sense of
the things that we like, and we try and bring
that back to the band. We do realize that this
is our sixth record and that we want to try
something different, so we try to take risks
with different styles and different types of
music that we like and try and appropriate
that into our writing.

TUCKER: Yeah, we were. I remember at
the time saying, "This might be a really con
troversial song." But we just fell like we
need to do it, and that free speech is really
important, you know, that we need to rec
ognize that. For us the whole country is, "Go
war!"
INTERMISSION: Both on "One Beat" and
on your albums in the past, a lot of your
songs have been about how music is one of
the really big forces in dissent and protest.
Could you talk a little bit about how you see
the role of music in dissent?
TUCKER: I think that we might describe
ourselves as cultural activists, in terms of the
fact that the culture around us is really im
portant, although we might not necessarily
be involved in political activism, in terms of
putting people on the ballot or whatever.
Just making music and making art that
speaks out about the world around yon is re
ally important and it's been historically im
portant. So I think that we ourselves are in
spired by that music and art. We in turn try
to carry that sensibility with us when we're
writing songs, without carrying it too heavi
ly and putting the message before the music
— I think that we want to write about some
thing that moves us.
INTERMISSION: When you write songs
like "Step Aside" or "Words -I- Guitar,"
which focus on the liberating power of
music, are there any bands or types of music
in particular that you have in mind?
TUCKER: For me, personally, on "Step
Aside" I was thinking about Lulu. Janet
said, "We need to write a dance song for this

record," and it was kind of her idea: "Go
and write something really danceable for
this record." So Carrie and I came up with a
really bare bones idea, and then we all came
together, and we had to work on it a lot to
come up with it. And we started getting a re
ally '60s sound to it. That was when 1 was,
like, "I wanna sound like Lulu!" We're real
ly influenced by so many bands, 1 think, in
general.
INTERMISSION: Although you're defi
nitely not "mainstream," the band has been
covered in the New York rimes and Time
Magazine, and I was just wondering how
you felt about that kind of mainstream ex
posure. Are you worried about being de
fanged and co-opted the way riot grrrl was?
TUCKER: I think that we sort of see both
sides of it. We're sometimes worried that a
writer or the magazine or whatever is not
going to get what we're about, but at the
same time it's important for us to have ex
posure, to get out there and sell records and
also introduce people that might not be in a
subculture scene to our ideas and music. I
think that we sort of take it with a grain of
salt. We're most concerned about our
music, and that's what we're worried about;
the press stuff is much more secondary.
INTERMISSION: On each successive
album your music has become more adven
turous and has started to incorporate a lot
more styles. What kind of factors feed into
that?
TUCKER: I think that we all have really dif
ferent tastes in music and an eclectic sense of
the things that we like, and we try and bring
that back to the band. We do realize that this
is our sixth record and that we want to try
something different, so we try to take risks
with different styles and different types of
music that we like and try and appropriate
that into our writing.

Sleater-Kinney: Drummer Janet Weiss, Singer/GuitaristCorin Tucker, Guitarist Carrie Brownstein
"Hello?"
"Hi, this is Anthony Ha from The Stan
ford Daily ... Is this Corin?"
"Yes, it is."
"Oh ... wow."
Not the most professional way to start an
interview, but hey, I was talking to a mem
ber of Sleater-motherfucking-Kinney! I've
always been a geeky fanboy at heart, so it
was inevitable that hearing the voice of
Corin Tucker-whose powerful singing
dominates many of Sleater-Kinney's finest
recordings — would reduce me to virtual
incoherence.
Quite possibly the best band playing
today, the group has been riding high on a
crest of critical adulation since "Call the
Doctor" (199(5) and "Dig Me Out" (1997).
The reception of the moody, experimental
"The Hot Rock" (1999) and its poppier fol
low-up "All Hands on the Bad One" (2000)
was more mixed, but One Beat, the band's
recently released sixth album, finds Sleater-
Kinney back at the top of its form, fueling its
still-growing musical sophistication with
fiery defiance.
1 showed np a little late to this party. I still
know basically nothing about the riot grrl
movement from which Sleater-kinney
sprang in the early-'9os; when I first picked
up a copy of "All Hands on the Band One"
last year, few things could have been farther
from my personal experience than, say,
Bikini kill's kathleen Hanna on stage,
shrieking, "I might make you rape me!"
Still, "You're No Rock'n'Roll Fun" and
other standout tracks from "All Hands"
piqued my curiosity.
My next purchase — the angry, distortion
heavy "("all the Doctor" — was even better,
but it was "Dig Me Out" that felt like a reve
lation. Bob Dylan once compared listening
to Elvis with breaking out of jail, and that
description is the closest I can get to recap
turing the intensity of the first time I heard
"The Drama You've Been Craving": Tuck
er yelling, "kick it in!" while fellow vocal
ist/guitarist Carrie Brownstein interjects,

"Out!", botli of them pulled
forward by the slashing gui
tars and Janet Weiss's
propulsive drumming.
While the band's record
ings feature intelligent,
often pointedly political
lyrics, the music is the key to
both its politics and its emo
tional power — I love the di
alogue created by Tucker
and Brownstein's intertwin
ing voices, but far more im
portant is the way words,
guitars and drums join to
create a feeling of liberation,
of feminism and the need
for social change as felt
knowledge rather than ab
stract ideas.
Sleater-Kinney delivered
that feeling in spades on
Sept. 23 at the Fillmore in
San Francisco. Most of the
tunes played were tracks

from the Sept. 11-influenced "One Beat,"
including the bubbly "Oh!", the mocking
protest song "Combat Rock" and the "shake
a tail for peace and love" anthem "Step
Aside." There were also old favorites from
every Sleater-kinney album since "Call the
Doctor," the juxtaposition of the raw "Call
the Doctor" with the polished, complex
"Step Aside" served as a good demonstra
tion of how much the band has grown in the
past six years.
For me, the concert was a chance to jump
up and down to the music of my favorite
band, chanting "Dig me out, dig me in, /
Outta my body, outta my skin," along with
Tucker, free from but not unaware of all the
troubles of the world. However, for the girl
behind me, who sang "Call the Doctor" 's
opening lines ("They want to socialize you, /
They want to purify you, / They want to dig
nify and analyze and terrorize you!") with
the passion and feeling of a true believer,
the concert was clearly something deeper
and more personal; for many, Sleater-kin
ney is not just a damn good band, but a truly
necessary one.
A month earlier, I spoke briefly to Tuck
er about the new album, protest songs and
her feelings about Sleater-Kinney's growing
exposure in the mainstream media.
INTERMISSION: When you were writing
"One Beat," was there a conscious decision
to do a lot of songs that addressed Sept. 11.
in some way?
CORIN TUCKER: Um, there wasn't really
a conscious decision to do that. I think that
it was just such as an overwhelming pres
ence in our minds as we were trying to write
songs, that we felt that we really needed to
deal with it, and that we really needed to
write about it. Especially "Combat Rock."
That was the most conscious song in terms
of the intense wave of nationalism and pa
triotism that was.happening. It was really
frightening. We were just surprised that
people weren't speaking out about it more
than they were, and we decided to write
about it ourselves.

INTERMISSION: Given that there's such a
nationalistic, flag-waving attitude, were you
worried at all about the response to that
song?
TUCKER: Yeah, we were. I remember at
the time saying, "This might be a really con
troversial song." But we just fell like we
need to do it, and that free speech is really

Bikini kill's kathleen Hanna on stage,
shrieking, "I might make you rape me!"
Still, "You're No Rock'n'Roll Fun" and
other standout tracks from "All Hands"
piqued my curiosity.
My next purchase — the angry, distortion
heavy "("all the Doctor" — was even better,
but it was "Dig Me Out" that felt like a reve
lation. Bob Dylan once compared listening
to Elvis with breaking out of jail, and that
description is the closest I can get to recap
turing the intensity of the first time I heard
"The Drama You've Been Craving": Tuck
er yelling, "kick it in!" while fellow vocal
ist/guitarist Carrie Brownstein interjects,

"Out!", botli of them pulled
forward by the slashing gui
tars and Janet Weiss's
propulsive drumming.
While the band's record
ings feature intelligent,
often pointedly political
lyrics, the music is the key to
both its politics and its emo
tional power — I love the di
alogue created by Tucker
and Brownstein's intertwin
ing voices, but far more im
portant is the way words,
guitars and drums join to
create a feeling of liberation,
of feminism and the need
for social change as felt
knowledge rather than ab
stract ideas.
Sleater-Kinney delivered
that feeling in spades on
Sept. 23 at the Fillmore in
San Francisco. Most of the
tunes played were tracks

from the Sept. 11-influenced "One Beat,"
including the bubbly "Oh!", the mocking
protest song "Combat Rock" and the "shake
a tail for peace and love" anthem "Step
Aside." There were also old favorites from
every Sleater-kinney album since "Call the
Doctor," the juxtaposition of the raw "Call
the Doctor" with the polished, complex
"Step Aside" served as a good demonstra
tion of how much the band has grown in the
past six years.
For me, the concert was a chance to jump
up and down to the music of my favorite
band, chanting "Dig me out, dig me in, /
Outta my body, outta my skin," along with
Tucker, free from but not unaware of all the
troubles of the world. However, for the girl
behind me, who sang "Call the Doctor" 's
opening lines ("They want to socialize you, /
They want to purify you, / They want to dig
nify and analyze and terrorize you!") with
the passion and feeling of a true believer,
the concert was clearly something deeper
and more personal; for many, Sleater-kin
ney is not just a damn good band, but a truly
necessary one.
A month earlier, I spoke briefly to Tuck
er about the new album, protest songs and
her feelings about Sleater-Kinney's growing
exposure in the mainstream media.
INTERMISSION: When you were writing
"One Beat," was there a conscious decision
to do a lot of songs that addressed Sept. 11.
in some way?
CORIN TUCKER: Um, there wasn't really
a conscious decision to do that. I think that
it was just such as an overwhelming pres
ence in our minds as we were trying to write
songs, that we felt that we really needed to
deal with it, and that we really needed to
write about it. Especially "Combat Rock."
That was the most conscious song in terms
of the intense wave of nationalism and pa
triotism that was.happening. It was really
frightening. We were just surprised that
people weren't speaking out about it more
than they were, and we decided to write
about it ourselves.

INTERMISSION: Given that there's such a
nationalistic, flag-waving attitude, were you
worried at all about the response to that
song?
TUCKER: Yeah, we were. I remember at
the time saying, "This might be a really con
troversial song." But we just fell like we
need to do it, and that free speech is really
important, you know, that we need to rec
ognize that. For us the whole country is, "Go
war!"
INTERMISSION: Both on "One Beat" and
on your albums in the past, a lot of your
songs have been about how music is one of
the really big forces in dissent and protest.
Could you talk a little bit about how you see
the role of music in dissent?
TUCKER: I think that we might describe
ourselves as cultural activists, in terms of the
fact that the culture around us is really im
portant, although we might not necessarily
be involved in political activism, in terms of
putting people on the ballot or whatever.
Just making music and making art that
speaks out about the world around yon is re
ally important and it's been historically im
portant. So I think that we ourselves are in
spired by that music and art. We in turn try
to carry that sensibility with us when we're
writing songs, without carrying it too heavi
ly and putting the message before the music
— I think that we want to write about some
thing that moves us.
INTERMISSION: When you write songs
like "Step Aside" or "Words -I- Guitar,"
which focus on the liberating power of
music, are there any bands or types of music
in particular that you have in mind?
TUCKER: For me, personally, on "Step
Aside" I was thinking about Lulu. Janet
said, "We need to write a dance song for this

record," and it was kind of her idea: "Go
and write something really danceable for
this record." So Carrie and I came up with a
really bare bones idea, and then we all came
together, and we had to work on it a lot to
come up with it. And we started getting a re
ally '60s sound to it. That was when 1 was,
like, "I wanna sound like Lulu!" We're real
ly influenced by so many bands, 1 think, in
general.
INTERMISSION: Although you're defi
nitely not "mainstream," the band has been
covered in the New York rimes and Time
Magazine, and I was just wondering how
you felt about that kind of mainstream ex
posure. Are you worried about being de
fanged and co-opted the way riot grrrl was?
TUCKER: I think that we sort of see both
sides of it. We're sometimes worried that a
writer or the magazine or whatever is not
going to get what we're about, but at the
same time it's important for us to have ex
posure, to get out there and sell records and
also introduce people that might not be in a
subculture scene to our ideas and music. I
think that we sort of take it with a grain of
salt. We're most concerned about our
music, and that's what we're worried about;
the press stuff is much more secondary.
INTERMISSION: On each successive
album your music has become more adven
turous and has started to incorporate a lot
more styles. What kind of factors feed into
that?
TUCKER: I think that we all have really dif
ferent tastes in music and an eclectic sense of
the things that we like, and we try and bring
that back to the band. We do realize that this
is our sixth record and that we want to try
something different, so we try to take risks
with different styles and different types of
music that we like and try and appropriate
that into our writing.
