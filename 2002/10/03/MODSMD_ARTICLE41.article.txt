# Attack of the Culkins

### KIM SAMEK 
Kieran Culkin must be the "it-boy" of the
indie scene right now, because he stars in
terrible movies (think "Dangerous Lives of
Altar Boys") yet receives rave reviews. With
his shaggy brown hair, you may confuse him
more with Cousin It than the hot property of
independent film. The melodrama that
characterizes his films make Dawson's Creek
look like a well-crafted masterpiece. From
the very start of "Igby Goes Down," I found

myself pondering the deep
er questions of life — how
many Culkins are there, re
ally?
In all seriousness, "Igby
Goes Down" is disappoint
ing at best. Given its all-star

cast (Claire Danes, Susan Sarandon, Ryan
Phillipe, and let's not forget Rory Culkin)
and the overwhelming lac k of movies worth
watching lately, "Igbv" does not deliver. The

third Catcher in the Rye spin-off this sum
mer (the others are "Tadpole," and"The
Good Girl"), "Igby" follows the life of an al
most 18-year-old boy who leads a life of hard
knocks.
He manages to get himself thrown out of
several schools and runs away from home,
which for him means a schizophrenic father,
unrelenting mother and arrogant brother.
He then wanders around New York City,
crashing at the rendezvous loft for his godfa
ther and his mistress. "Life on the street" for
Igby means a millionaire godfather who
hands him money for no apparent reason.
Like every other character in the movie,
Igby is cold and unforgiving, and during his
stay at the loft, he has cold and unforgiving
sex with Rachel, his godfather's mistress. A

string of bad events follow:
his brother steals his older
girlfriend (Claire Danes), his
mom develops terminal can
cer and finally Igby is left
with no one except fora
cross-dressing performance

artist — a painter who does not paint —
who hangs around at the loft.
The movie was written as though director
Burr Steers sat down and thought up the
worst possible things that could happen and
strung them together into a dramedy, ig
noring all concept of realistic character yet
entirely missing the mark of satire as well.
Not a single dramatic moment is sincere.
The acting is so obviously forced that A-list
actors such as Danes and Sarandon come off
as amateurs. The movie lacks any real heart
in the same way the characters do, allowing
no visible entry way to draw the audience
into the story.
Granted, there are a few great laughs.
There are certain moments at which Igby
makes idiosyncratic comments that remind
you he is human. This may be Steers'
strength, and the movie could have benefit
ed from a lighter tone. Perhaps Steers felt
that his directorial debut should make an
important statement on hard life in America
and he will be able to focus more on what is
right for the film on his next movie.


Kieran: still not as cool as Macaulay.
