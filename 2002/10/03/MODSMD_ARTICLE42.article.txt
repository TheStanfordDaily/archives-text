## IDAHO 
### KARAN MAHAJAN 
Let me just start by saying this: They don't
pay lis at Intermission. We, the enslaved ge
niuses, lend our shaking wrists to the annals of
rock history fora few fucking obscure CDs.
And then bands like Idaho happen. And we
have to keep writing. Bands as great as the
indie-outfit Idaho make you believers, because
for an instant — one tiny instant after the CD
has finished playing — you feel that your mis
sion in life is that band.
The cheekily titled "We Were Young and
Needed the Money," could well be a disclaimer
for some discarded juveniL. Instead, this col
lection of rarities and B-sides from Idaho's ten
year career is a matchbox of fire-starters with
enough dazzling dazedness to impress even
fans of Pavement or Radiohead. The sound is
mid-90's alternative "slow-core" — the

vana-education whole — and what a sound it
is!
That Idaho actually pioneered the slow
tore movement along with bands such as Pave
ment is relatively unknown; meanwhile, the
chunky, weepy guitar and the unexpected
twists in the verse-chorus formula would put
the desperate happiness of The Strokes and
The White Stripes to shame. In fact, if the cur
rent resurgence caused by those bands is
something to go by, then we might soon asso
ciate Idaho with more than a Midwestern state.
The album kicks of with the sleepy yodel of
lead singer Jeff Martin and an unsettling start
stop guitar a la REM's "Drive." And then you're
asking yourself why Pavement's "Wowee Zone"
suddenly got better and the 2.25 is up. You ache
with out-of-tune guitar blast of "Teeth Marks"
("baby, I was right / to go with my gut feelings")
