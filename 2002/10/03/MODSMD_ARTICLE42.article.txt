# slow-core pioneers
## IDAHO 
### KARAN MAHAJAN 
Let me just start by saying this: They don't
pay lis at Intermission. We, the enslaved ge
niuses, lend our shaking wrists to the annals of
rock history fora few fucking obscure CDs.
And then bands like Idaho happen. And we
have to keep writing. Bands as great as the
indie-outfit Idaho make you believers, because
for an instant — one tiny instant after the CD
has finished playing — you feel that your mis
sion in life is that band.
The cheekily titled "We Were Young and
Needed the Money," could well be a disclaimer
for some discarded juveniL. Instead, this col
lection of rarities and B-sides from Idaho's ten
year career is a matchbox of fire-starters with
enough dazzling dazedness to impress even
fans of Pavement or Radiohead. The sound is
mid-90's alternative "slow-core" — the
coleslaw that made our mashed-potatoes Nir-

vana-education whole — and what a sound it
is!
That Idaho actually pioneered the slow
tore movement along with bands such as Pave
ment is relatively unknown; meanwhile, the
chunky, weepy guitar and the unexpected
twists in the verse-chorus formula would put
the desperate happiness of The Strokes and
The White Stripes to shame. In fact, if the cur
rent resurgence caused by those bands is
something to go by, then we might soon asso
ciate Idaho with more than a Midwestern state.
The album kicks of with the sleepy yodel of
lead singer Jeff Martin and an unsettling start
stop guitar a la REM's "Drive." And then you're
asking yourself why Pavement's "Wowee Zone"
suddenly got better and the 2.25 is up. You ache
with out-of-tune guitar blast of "Teeth Marks"
("baby, I was right / to go with my gut feelings")
and sway to the detached aura of
Martin's voice.
Everything is insouciant and ir
relevant. There are no obvious
statements made, and Martin's
"Four stringed instrument with
odd tuning" sounds vaguely
drunk. With "Come Over," you
see Idaho, the self-destructive, su
percilious artist: the hazy, sonic
sound makes a Weezer-worthy
hook sound bad-tempered.
With "Shoulder Back," Idaho
looks over to a dewy British sound
with a powerful spontaneity and
unselfconsciousness. It's only
when one gets to the 1 Oth track of
this 17-track collection that things
begin to get a bit boring — Idaho
clearly has too many good tracks
left-over from various albums to
stuff onto a single collection. The
pace is remarkably consistent,
which depending on your mood,
could be a good or bad thing. But,
considering this is a collection of
"rarities, outtakes and studio
songs," this is hardly a flaw. With
most other artists, such collections
are often supposed to suck, so that
the staid hits that you already own
seem even more luminous than
they actually are.
Furthermore, this album, ex
cept for that sag in the middle, is a

great evolutionary chart for
Idaho, going from "mournful,
tentative" to the more experimen
tal, tangy sounds of "Spiral" — a
weird semi-colon of a song that
transforms into a mystical conch
blowing (no its not that weird).
What is a tad baffling is the quirky
"Stayin" Out in Front": It begins
with a loud, overdubbed pre-cog
gish "pa pa pa," not to mention
bongos and tin-cans plying in the
background. Then, the drum
ming gives way to a wonderful
acoustic strum and hinges deli
cately on the line "watch the
movie backwards." All in all, awe
some.
The final song ("Drown"),
though, is rather predictable in its
post modern "mess" ending
(though Martin's voice is now a
terrifying, deep baritone), and
"Traces" seems like a Nirvana
song still wet 011 canvas.
All in all, Idaho is melancholic
slow-core band with every right to
be melancholic. Not as cool as
Pavement and not as uptight as
Kadiohead, it has every right to be
successful. Sometimes you wish
that instead of simply needing the
money, the band had actually
WANTED it .ind had, by the
mercy of Rolling Stone, made it.
At least that way you'd know they
exist. Sadly, for every Beatles that
makes it big, there are ten that are
crushed like . . er . . beetles.

Let me just start by saying this: They don't
pay lis at Intermission. We, the enslaved ge
niuses, lend our shaking wrists to the annals of
rock history fora few fucking obscure CDs.
And then bands like Idaho happen. And we
have to keep writing. Bands as great as the
indie-outfit Idaho make you believers, because
for an instant — one tiny instant after the CD
has finished playing — you feel that your mis
sion in life is that band.
The cheekily titled "We Were Young and
Needed the Money," could well be a disclaimer
for some discarded juveniL. Instead, this col
lection of rarities and B-sides from Idaho's ten
year career is a matchbox of fire-starters with
enough dazzling dazedness to impress even
fans of Pavement or Radiohead. The sound is
mid-90's alternative "slow-core" — the
coleslaw that made our mashed-potatoes Nir-

vana-education whole — and what a sound it
is!
That Idaho actually pioneered the slow
tore movement along with bands such as Pave
ment is relatively unknown; meanwhile, the
chunky, weepy guitar and the unexpected
twists in the verse-chorus formula would put
the desperate happiness of The Strokes and
The White Stripes to shame. In fact, if the cur
rent resurgence caused by those bands is
something to go by, then we might soon asso
ciate Idaho with more than a Midwestern state.
The album kicks of with the sleepy yodel of
lead singer Jeff Martin and an unsettling start
stop guitar a la REM's "Drive." And then you're
asking yourself why Pavement's "Wowee Zone"
suddenly got better and the 2.25 is up. You ache
with out-of-tune guitar blast of "Teeth Marks"
("baby, I was right / to go with my gut feelings")
and sway to the detached aura of
Martin's voice.
Everything is insouciant and ir
relevant. There are no obvious
statements made, and Martin's
"Four stringed instrument with
odd tuning" sounds vaguely
drunk. With "Come Over," you
see Idaho, the self-destructive, su
percilious artist: the hazy, sonic
sound makes a Weezer-worthy
hook sound bad-tempered.
With "Shoulder Back," Idaho
looks over to a dewy British sound
with a powerful spontaneity and
unselfconsciousness. It's only
when one gets to the 1 Oth track of
this 17-track collection that things
begin to get a bit boring — Idaho
clearly has too many good tracks
left-over from various albums to
stuff onto a single collection. The
pace is remarkably consistent,
which depending on your mood,
could be a good or bad thing. But,
considering this is a collection of
"rarities, outtakes and studio
songs," this is hardly a flaw. With
most other artists, such collections
are often supposed to suck, so that
the staid hits that you already own
seem even more luminous than
they actually are.
Furthermore, this album, ex
cept for that sag in the middle, is a

great evolutionary chart for
Idaho, going from "mournful,
tentative" to the more experimen
tal, tangy sounds of "Spiral" — a
weird semi-colon of a song that
transforms into a mystical conch
blowing (no its not that weird).
What is a tad baffling is the quirky
"Stayin" Out in Front": It begins
with a loud, overdubbed pre-cog
gish "pa pa pa," not to mention
bongos and tin-cans plying in the
background. Then, the drum
ming gives way to a wonderful
acoustic strum and hinges deli
cately on the line "watch the
movie backwards." All in all, awe
some.
The final song ("Drown"),
though, is rather predictable in its
post modern "mess" ending
(though Martin's voice is now a
terrifying, deep baritone), and
"Traces" seems like a Nirvana
song still wet 011 canvas.
All in all, Idaho is melancholic
slow-core band with every right to
be melancholic. Not as cool as
Pavement and not as uptight as
Kadiohead, it has every right to be
successful. Sometimes you wish
that instead of simply needing the
money, the band had actually
WANTED it .ind had, by the
mercy of Rolling Stone, made it.
At least that way you'd know they
exist. Sadly, for every Beatles that
makes it big, there are ten that are
crushed like . . er . . beetles.
