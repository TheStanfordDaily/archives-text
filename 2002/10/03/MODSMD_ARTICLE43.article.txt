### CHRIS LEE 
The standard indie movie can go
one of two ways - it can be a ground
breaking achievement that reaffirms
your conviction in film as an art
form, or it can be an unflinchingly
bad piece that makes you want to run
back to the dull but comforting con
fines of Hollywood formula, unwill
ing to ever venture into a smaller
theater again. Sadly, Steven Shain
berg's "Secretary" falls on the latter
end of that spectrum. Even those
who aren't put off by its kinky mate
rial will most likely emerge scratch
ing their heads rather than feeling
rejuvenated.
Maggie Gyllenhaal stars as Lee
Holloway, a recently released mental
patient who is still overcome with the
urge to cut herself lip when life be
comes too hard or meaningless. To
ease her way back into society, Lee
gets a job as secretary to an ambigu-

Secretary
Lions Gate Films
Directed by Steven Hg f\Sr
Shainberg
k^

ous lawyer, E. Edward Grey (played
by James Spader). Unbeknownst to
either of them, they are a perfect
match: Mr. Grey's exacting de
mands at the office are exactly the
type of discipline and forcefulness
Lee craves in an unstructured world.
After committing several egregious
typing errors, Lee unexpectedly re
ceives the most satisfying experience
she could ask for from Mr. Grey: a se
vere spanking session. Their ensu
ing relationship - an infusion of S &
M barely restrained by their respec
tive roles at the office - is what drives
the movie towards its dubious resolu
tion.
The disappointment doesn't lie
with the performances. Like the
movie or not, Gyllenhaal turns in a
star-making performance, proving
she's every bit as worthy of attention
as her brother Jake. And Spader,
though playing a character not far
removed from his creepy pervert in
"Sex, Lies, and Videotape," is area-


Just another da/ in the Stanford Daily office
sonable choice for the conflicted
Mr. Grey.
The cardinal sin the movie
commits is simply not having
enough material to work with.
The script is based on a Mary
Gaitskill story of the same name,
but rather than flesh it out, it
would appear that screenwriter
Erin Cressida Wilson chose in
stead to minimize it as much as
possible, relying on extended im
agery and visual scenes to bloat
the story to feature length. Every
outside character, from Lee's
parents and married sister to her
bumbling fiance (an infuriatingly
inconsequential Jeremy Davies),
is summarily introduced and
then tossed aside. Perhaps this is
to focus more on the action inside
the office, but every time an out
side character tries to interfere,
their flatness is unflatteringly re
vealed.
Even the two main characters'
dispositions as dominant / sub

missive counterparts seem less
like character traits and more
like plot devices. Lee is so sub
missive that she even phones Mr.
Grey to tell him what she's hav
ing for dinner so that he can tell
her exactly how much of each
food to eat. This is fascinating,
but the movie goes no further in
providing information for why
the characters act the way they
do; instead of expository dia
logue, we get uncomfortable mo
ments of silence which, while re
alistic, leave the maddened audi
ence guessing about what's going
on in these characters' heads. A
fragmented narration allows Lee
to provide the bare minimum of
facts, but seems contrived and
pasted on.
Call it unconventional, call it
daring, but the real tragedy of
"Secretary" is that it doesn't have
enough story to sustain itself.
What could have been an in
triguing character study or at
least an interesting statement
about its unique subject matter is
destroyed by lazy construction
and an unsatisfactory ending.
