The standard indie movie can go
one of two ways - it can be a ground
breaking achievement that reaffirms
your conviction in film as an art
form, or it can be an unflinchingly
bad piece that makes you want to run

The disappointment doesn't lie
with the performances. Like the
movie or not, Gyllenhaal turns in a
star-making performance, proving
she's every bit as worthy of attention

though playing a character not far
removed from his creepy pervert in
"Sex, Lies, and Videotape," is area-
