FREDERICK, Md. (AP) —
A landlord who shot and killed
two cats after a tenant refused
to get rid of them was acquitted
of felony charges, the first court
test of a new Maryland new de
signed to stiffen penalties for
animal cruelty.
A judge ruled that Eric
Grossnickle destroyed the cats
in a legally acceptable manner
when he blasted them with a
12-gauge shotgun.
"I don't like what he did, but
it's not a crime under Maryland
law," Circuit Judge Mary
Stepler said on Wednesday.
The ruling left the cats'
owner, April Ritch, frustrated
and tearful.
"There is no justice whatsoev
er," Ritch said, clutching a tin
box containing Babe's and
Angel's remains. "It's not a
crime to take somebody's
house pets from their home
and shoot them and kill them?"
Grossnickle was also acquit
ted of theft, but convicted on
two counts of malicious de
struction of property, a misde
meanor punishable by up to 90
days in jail and a $1,000 fine.
Grossnickle did not deny
shooting the cats, which were
killed Oct. 1, the same day the
animal cruelty law took effect.
According to court testimony,
he told Ritch five times to get rid

of the cats or he would do it for
her because they were reducing
the home's value by damaging
the walls and carpets.
Although the state prohibits
inflicting unnecessary pain and
suffering on animals, it allows
killing them humanely for food
processing, hunting, scientific
research, pest control and agri
cultural practices.
Since Grossnickle killed the
cats quickly, using a method ac
cepted by farmers and with no
intention of causing them un
necessary suffering, he did not
break the law, Stepler said.
Assistant State's Attorney
Laura Corbett said the cats
were "unnecessarily, unjustifi
ably and, therefore, cruelly
killed."
Court rules prohibit the
state from appealing Stepler's
verdict.
The judge said sentencing
would be in six weeks but did
not specify a date.
Grossnickle and his attor
ney, Richard P. Bricken, re
fused to comment afterward.
The animal cruelty law
made deliberate acts of torture
and mutilation of animals a
felony instead of a misde
meanor, carrying a maximum
jail term of three years.
