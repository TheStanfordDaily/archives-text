# Ani: too funky, too impersonal
## 
### MICHAEL BAER 
The myth of Ani DiFranco, as with many artists
who lead their respective musical niches, often over
shadows the obvious fact that she makes music, often
great music. She is described as an indie entrepre
neur, a feminist, a leftist, a now-married bisexual and
a folkie with a punk attitude. However, due to her
fierce independence, many more people know her
name than her music. Sympathetic critics have been
waiting for the album that would change this. Unfor
tunately, her new live double CD, "So Much Shout-

ing, So Much Laughter," is not this album.
In fact, it's not even likely to give her the

career boost that "Living in Clip," her

only previous live album, did. While

that collection of songs did not em-

phasize her musical talent, it did
emphasize her energy, creativity

and songwriting. Since then, how
ever, all these have declined, tak-

ing a backseat to her recent fasci
nations — musically with funk and

slow jams, and lyrically with imper
sonal politics. She selected the songs

on the live album to jive with her new
groove and then bent the few that didn't

jive. The melodic and personal songs are
out, and the harsh and political songs are
in, to the point that much of this is hardly
recognizable as music.
Along these lines, the most notable track

is "Self Evident," in which she puts the anti-
Bush dogmas of the progressive left to rhyme
with negligible musical accompaniment and

occasional applause from the choir she's
preaching to. This track is notable not only be
cause it gets the listener's attention more than

most, but also because it emphasizes her cur
rent strengths and weaknesses. While she can
make even a tired collection of "controversial"

thoughts into a surprisingly incisive rant, she
is held back by her unwillingness to do some
rrr . . n .1 . . 1 1 •

thing different from what the audience
would expect or want from her.
She also makes her songs — old and new

— longer by slow
ing them down
and adding gener
ic funk filler. The
worst victim of her
funk kick is "Letter
to a John," a song
from relatively

So Much Shouting,

early in her career which tells the plight of a child se
duced into prostitution. A song that started its life as
serious commentary just doesn't sound right when
the horns kick in, turning a raw cry-out into a light,
lifeless genre exercise. Other songs are merely recre
ations of the studio versions, sapped of their soul

after years of performance. Occasionally she de
. livers a satisfying track, such as the new low-

key groove of "Shrug," which has the wel
come personal touch missing from most of

these tracks. Another such track is
album ;ioser "You Had Time," a

reinterpreted version of a beautiful
ballad about the exhausted turning

o
point of a relationship. But by then
the listener is exhausted, and it's
too little too late.

The Hashes of creativity
and nostalgia save "So Much
Shouting, So Much Laughter"
from being a total failure. But it's
difficult to make any live album
truly succeed. Her last live

album succeeded because it
compiled the great songs
she'd been writing for years,
while this one has a far more
paltry selection. DiFranco

has long prided herself on
being independent and
uncompromising, but her

back-to-back double al
bums — her last album
was a studio double CD

— are more a sign of stub
bornness than of any great
work of music.
