### SERENA LAUREN BLODGER 
On November 12, 2002, Seattle-based Minus tht
Bear will release its first ever full-length

album, "Highly Refined Pirates" 011 Sui
cide Squeeze Records. According to
those versed in the Seattle music scene,
Minus the Bear is destined for the big
time. The half math-rock, quarter pro
gressive and quarter technical rock
band is comprised of members of estab
lished local bands that formed Minus

the Bear as a side project. So it's not surprising that this
band has accumulated a dedicated fan base within just a
few years of recording and performing.
If great song tides could predict the success of a band,
then the illustrious members of Minus the Bear should
go to the gym, work out a lot and prepare to move
hoards of Grammies to their brand new display shelf.
With titles like "Get Me Naked 2: Electric Bugaloo,"
"Thanks For The Killer Game of Crisco Twister,"
"Monkey!!!Knife!!!Fight!!!"and "Absinthe Party At The
Fly Honey Warehouse," even Simon from American
Idol might become a groupie and follow them around
in a van.
Unfortunately, song titles don't have this kind of
power. Music is about emotion: instrumental, vocal and
"in-between-the lines." Minus the Bear's self-attributed
lyrical themes are women, drinking and smoking. As

band member Jake said in an interview, "I really like all
those things. I'm just writing about what's on my mind
these days, mostly women since I do a porn website — I
don't sit around and obsess about

drinking and smoking. When used in
lyrics, drinking and smoking have a
nostalgic effect that I enjoy and think
people connect with."
Although Minus the Bear's lyrical
content is not stellar, it will appeal to
those who appreciate a more laid-

back sound, with songs having a simi
lar overall vibe to the latest 311 single "Amber." For ex
ample, consider these lyrics from "Thanks For The
Killer Game of Crisco Twister": "Hey, please pass that
dish, and refill my glass, take off the sunglasses, the sun
set — take in the twilight." Unless this is a secret code for
persuading youngsters to change the world, the lyrics
seem pretty subdued.
Aside from lyrical content, Minus the Bear is instru
mentally skilled and innovative in the technical ways of
music. Unfortunately, their heavy use of digital instru
mentation causes the emotion in their tunes to go a little
flat. A live show and a venue filled with pumped up fans
and excessive energy would probably much better cap
ture the true vibe of Minus the Bear. So, ifyou are into
lyrics and mood, wait fora live show. Otherwise, if all
you care about is cool instrumentation, Minus the Bear
is vour new second best friend.
