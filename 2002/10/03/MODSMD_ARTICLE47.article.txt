The Velvet Underground's
1968 album "White Light / White
Heat" starts before you have a
chance to get ready. And you
wonder if it should sound like this
. . . You wonder if your copy is
broken. Far from it really. It just
take a little time to get used to, a
few listens to realize that this
sound is beautiful in its own way.
Beautiful in such a different
and amazing way that you have to
wonder what it must have been
like to hear "White Light / White
Heat" in 1968 when it was first re
leased. In retrospect, VU's John
Cale has called this record "anti
beauty," which sums up the dri
ving force behind this sound pret
ty well. No Velvet Underground
album reaches the raw and often
painful musical quality that
"White Light" does. The opening
title track starts so suddenly that
you feel you've made a mistake
and started it mid-song. Equally
jarring is the sound on this song:
a level of static and guitar distor
tion that you'll become quite fa
miliar with by the end of the
album. Lou Reed has explained
that, at the time, they were the
only American band signed to a

contract with the
company Vox, who
supplied them with
the tools of their dis
tortion. "White
Light / White Heat"
hits you pretty hard
and to state it quite
simply, it's a song
about speed, and it's
not hard to figure
this out. It rocks. I
will refrain from say
ing that after I talk
about every song,
but really, they all
rock.
The next song is
"The Gift," in which
John Cale reads a
short story written
by Lou Reed on one
channel while the
band jams on the

other, giving the listener the op
tion to hear both, or one or the
other. I love the story (in all its
morbid comedy), but I really have
to recommend listening to just the
music. Following "The Gift," is
"Lady Godiva's Operation,"
which I will try to describe, but re
ally doesn't make sense until
you've heard it for yourself. Lou
Reed and John Gale decided to

share the vocals on this one, tak
ing turns finishing eachother's
lines. But this technique doesn't
show up until halfway through an
otherwise eerily soothing song.
When it happens, it takes you by
surprise: Lou Reed's volume is
much higher, and the desired ef
fect is lost, giving the song a very
scary and disturbing feeling as the
music grows more tense and the

two narrators begin de
scribing a very ambiguous,
gorey scene on the operat
ing table.
At this point the album
has taken a somewhat
strange turn, but the
fourth song, "Here She
Comes Now," is very sweet
and almost foreshadows
the very gentle, hopeful
sound of the Velvet Un
derground's self-titled
album that followed this
one (minus Cale). This
song evolves into "I Heard
Her Call My Name," which
has similar lyrics, but picks
up a lot more, getting into
some very beautiful guitar
feedback and noise solos by
Reed. Just when you think
this song couldn't get any
better, Reed tells you,

"And then my mind split open..."
and something really does split
open as the album kicks into its
last barrage of noisy guitar
squealing, the 20-minute epic
"Sister Ray."
You could really write a whole
article on just this song, but 1 will
try and do it justice in the next few
sentences. "Sister Ray" was
recorded in one take, with each

musician (two guitars, drums and
organ) fighting for the loudest,
most awful sound. Over the fight
is Reed's classic delivery of typical
VU lyrics: the story of New York
City low-lifes' daily habits of drugs
and murder. I love listening to
this song, looking at the time, and
realizing it's only half over when it
seems like it's been going for half
an hour. On that note, I have to
recommend the three different
versions of Sister Ray available on
the recently released Quine Tapes
Bootleg set, each one clocking in
at over 30 min.
"Sister Ray" marks the end of
the relationship between The
Velvet Underground and gui
tarist/vocalist John Cale, who
does not appear on the next
album, "Velvet Underground."
The change in the band's sound
is striking, particularly if you lis
ten to these albums back to back;
in which case the soft, heart
wrenching sound of "Candy
Says," following the chaotic as
sault that is "Sister Ray," proves
to be quite a nice contrast. If you
enjoy this album then it is natur
al that you would enjoy their next
effort, which takes a few steps
backs towards conventional
beauty.

tion to hear both, or one or the
other. I love the story (in all its
morbid comedy), but I really have
to recommend listening to just the
music. Following "The Gift," is
"Lady Godiva's Operation,"
which I will try to describe, but re
ally doesn't make sense until
you've heard it for yourself. Lou
Reed and John Gale decided to

share the vocals on this one, tak
ing turns finishing eachother's
lines. But this technique doesn't
show up until halfway through an
otherwise eerily soothing song.
When it happens, it takes you by
surprise: Lou Reed's volume is
much higher, and the desired ef
fect is lost, giving the song a very
scary and disturbing feeling as the
music grows more tense and the

two narrators begin de
scribing a very ambiguous,
gorey scene on the operat
ing table.
At this point the album
has taken a somewhat
strange turn, but the
fourth song, "Here She
Comes Now," is very sweet
and almost foreshadows
the very gentle, hopeful
sound of the Velvet Un
derground's self-titled
album that followed this
one (minus Cale). This
song evolves into "I Heard
Her Call My Name," which
has similar lyrics, but picks
up a lot more, getting into
some very beautiful guitar
feedback and noise solos by
Reed. Just when you think
this song couldn't get any
better, Reed tells you,

"And then my mind split open..."
and something really does split
open as the album kicks into its
last barrage of noisy guitar
squealing, the 20-minute epic
"Sister Ray."
You could really write a whole
article on just this song, but 1 will
try and do it justice in the next few
sentences. "Sister Ray" was
recorded in one take, with each

musician (two guitars, drums and
organ) fighting for the loudest,
most awful sound. Over the fight
is Reed's classic delivery of typical
VU lyrics: the story of New York
City low-lifes' daily habits of drugs
and murder. I love listening to
this song, looking at the time, and
realizing it's only half over when it
seems like it's been going for half
an hour. On that note, I have to
recommend the three different
versions of Sister Ray available on
the recently released Quine Tapes
Bootleg set, each one clocking in
at over 30 min.
"Sister Ray" marks the end of
the relationship between The
Velvet Underground and gui
tarist/vocalist John Cale, who
does not appear on the next
album, "Velvet Underground."
The change in the band's sound
is striking, particularly if you lis
ten to these albums back to back;
in which case the soft, heart
wrenching sound of "Candy
Says," following the chaotic as
sault that is "Sister Ray," proves
to be quite a nice contrast. If you
enjoy this album then it is natur
al that you would enjoy their next
effort, which takes a few steps
backs towards conventional
beauty.


A classic Velvet Underground shot
The Velvet Underground's
1968 album "White Light / White
Heat" starts before you have a
chance to get ready. And you
wonder if it should sound like this
. . . You wonder if your copy is
broken. Far from it really. It just
take a little time to get used to, a
few listens to realize that this
sound is beautiful in its own way.
Beautiful in such a different
and amazing way that you have to
wonder what it must have been
like to hear "White Light / White
Heat" in 1968 when it was first re
leased. In retrospect, VU's John
Cale has called this record "anti
beauty," which sums up the dri
ving force behind this sound pret
ty well. No Velvet Underground
album reaches the raw and often
painful musical quality that
"White Light" does. The opening
title track starts so suddenly that
you feel you've made a mistake
and started it mid-song. Equally
jarring is the sound on this song:
a level of static and guitar distor
tion that you'll become quite fa
miliar with by the end of the
album. Lou Reed has explained
that, at the time, they were the
only American band signed to a

contract with the
company Vox, who
supplied them with
the tools of their dis
tortion. "White
Light / White Heat"
hits you pretty hard
and to state it quite
simply, it's a song
about speed, and it's
not hard to figure
this out. It rocks. I
will refrain from say
ing that after I talk
about every song,
but really, they all
rock.
The next song is
"The Gift," in which
John Cale reads a
short story written
by Lou Reed on one
channel while the
band jams on the

other, giving the listener the op
tion to hear both, or one or the
other. I love the story (in all its
morbid comedy), but I really have
to recommend listening to just the
music. Following "The Gift," is
