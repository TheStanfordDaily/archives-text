# Stanford Dating: hard or limp?
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
For your average woman at
Stanford, the dating scene goes
something like this:
1) Upon the arrival for new school
year, attend dorm barbeques,
scope out new classes, feign interest
in the ASSU to observe budding
politicians, ride through White
Plaza eight times a day and attempt
a bike accident, meet friends for
lunch at the law school to look at fu
ture lawyers, shadow a doctor pos
ing as "pre med" to observe the
muscles under the white coat, scan
Stanfordstalker.net (www.gostan
ford.com) for hot athletes and
when it looks really bleak, cave and
dress like a hoochie-mama to ap
pear at the Saturday night frat
party.
2) Now that you have identified
your list of crushes (a smart woman
should always be juggling three),
begin the incessant nightly gossip
with your roommate of how you
saw him on the Quad, and he MAY
have looked at you.
3) Go on the pill "just in case."
4) Ask everyone you know, tactful
ly, about his reputation. Does he

have a girlfriend? Who has lie
hooked up with? Someone you
know will inevitably know a girl
who lived in his freshman dorm
and has a friend who asked him to
Screw Your Roommate. Then you
can find out that he: a) said no or b)
screwed her brains out and never
talked to her again.
5) Begin pursuit in earnest, once
you eliminate the candidates who
have hygienic problems or slept
with that girl you despised in I-
Hum.
6) Use your connections to get in
vited to a party he will be at — be
sure to be drunk on arrival.
7) Wearing your tube top,
miniskirt, thong and best friend's
glitter eyeshadow, follow him
around the party pathetically and
watch him grind up on another
(uglier) girl.
8) Go home and find yourself sit
ting up at two in the morning read
ing your chemistry book and re
peating over and over to anyone
that will listen: "They are all scum!
Who needs them anyway?"
The real question here is: Why is
it so hard? (Or is it HARD at all? Or
just permanently limp?) In the real

world, men ask women on dates. At
Stanford, men make eye contact
with women as they leave Stern
Dining. Then they go home to qui
etly play with themselves under the
covers and hope their roommate
playing video games does not no
tice. WHY??? WHY????
The answer is not just that Stan
ford men are busy, socially stunted
by academic achievement or
scared. What it really comes down
to is that Stanford is too small of a
school for casual dating to occur.
Unless it is a blatantly drunk one
night stand, the assumption is that
after one date you will automatical
ly be in a serious, committed long
term relationship where you will be
expected to cut your course load to
take the necessary 5 unit "girl
friend" class.
How can we dispel this idea?
The truth is, our lives would be so
much more well rounded, fulfilling
and sexually satisfying if we could
get over the weird constraints of
the Stanford dating system. I urge
you to take the risk and live your
datingand sex life to the fullest. Be
cause while that girl next to you in
CSIOS may look seriously con
cerned about this week's problem
set, what she honestly needs is
some good old-fashioned romance
and weekends filled with wild hot
monkey sex.
