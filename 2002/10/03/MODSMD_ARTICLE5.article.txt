Jonathan Dorian, director of
SLAC, kicked off the celebration
by declaring that SLAC contin
ues to be a revolutionary facility
today.
"The founding of SLAC was a
pioneering effort of awesome
proportions, a technology feat
akin to the first moon shot,"
Dorfan said. "It is no wonder
(liat the linear accelerator was
first dubbed 'the monster.' "
Dorfan explained that
SIAC's success over the past
four decades can largely be at

tributed to its hardworking staff.
"A group of very spec ial peo
ple was the secret of that suc
cess," Dorfan said. "The com

the world's greatest science in
stitutions. Put simply, it takes
everyone pulling together,
every member of the SLA(fam
i!y."
Physics Nobel laureate
Jerome Friedman seconded
Dorian's praise of the SLAC

In his introductory remarks, SLAC Director Jonathan Dorfan called the
world-famous research center a "revolutionary facility," yesterday at
SLAC's 40th anniversary celebration.
remarks, University President
John Hennessy addressed the
crowd.
"This anniversary gives us all a
chance to celebrate four decades of
discovery and exploration," Hen
nessy said. "One of [SLAC's] more
enduring characteristics has been
ks willingness to be bold â€” a char
acteristic I believe it shares with ihe
University."
Hennessy further commented
on what he believes is an integral
relationship between SLAC and
Stanford.
"In preparing my remarks for
today, 1 thought how difficult it is
to think of Stanford without SLAC
and how SLAC could not have
been conceived without Stanford,"
Hennessy said.
According to Hennessy, this
partnership led to "collaboration
in ways previously unimagined."
Hennessy also went on to explain
the results of the two's joint ven
ture.
"SLAC ... [has] bridged theory
and experiment," Hennessy said.
"The University and SLAC share a
simple compelling message: to dis
cover and disseminate new knowl
edge."
Dorfan also underscored the
importance of SLAC working in
conjunction with Stanford.
"One of the key reasons SIAC
has been so successful is its inti
mate connection with one of the
greatest research universities in
the world, Stanford," Dorfan said.
Dorfan explained that the gov
ernment has played a large role in
the center's accomplishments as

well.
"SLAC's primary sponsor is the
Department of Energy," Dorfan
said. "We are fortunate that the
United States government has
long provided the vision, the lead
ership and the resources for the
laboratory. A thanks goes to all
those in the House and Senate
who have backed SLAC since its in
ception."
Peter Rosen, who attended as a
representative of the Department
of Energy, read a statement from
DOE Secretary Spencer Abraham.
"SLAC has created an unparal
leled record of achievement in
both science and technology de
velopment," Abraham said. "It has
resulted in live Nobel laureates
and has had a profound effect on
the conduct of science and our
economy."
Hennessy added that local city
governments have been im
pressed with SLAC's operations
due to the institution's environ
mental conscience.
"SLAC sits on some of the most
beautiful acres on Stanford," Hen
nessy said. "It has long recognized
the importance of preserving
these lands ... Menlo Park recog
nized SlAC's commitment to the
community and the environment
with the Golden Acorn award."
From the state level, SL\C was
offered congratulations by a rep
resentative on the behalf of Gov.
Gray Davis.
SIAC. began its operations in
19C2. The center is run by Stanford
University and receives the majori
ty of its funding from the Depart
ment of Energy. More than 3,000
researchers from over 20 countries
annually use the facility, in addition
to some 1,400 permanent staff
members in the Bay Area.
