## 
### JENNIFER KONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Three days Ix-fore classes started last
week, student stafl from the four ethnic
community centers came together fora joint
retreat — the first of its kind at Stanford.
From Sept. 22-23, about 35 student
stall from the Asian American Activities
Center, the Black Community Services
Center, El Centro Chicano and the Native
American Cultural Center convened at
the Mount Alverno Conference Center in
Redwood (lity.
The directors of the four centers devel
oped the idea fora joint retreat during a
dean of students' meeting this past summer.
In previous years, the four centers,
whi< h provide programming and other re

sources for students, have hosted their own
stall" retreats. But because the four centers
sponsor similar programs, the directors de
cided to centralize these commonalities.
"We realized that there was a lack of
across-the-board, consistent training," said
(Ihris Clarke, assistant director of LI ( lent ro
Chicano.
While students met within their own
centers to discuss concerns particular to
each stall, most ol the time at the retreat was
dedicated to large-group activities with
members from all four centers.
According to Jan Barker Alexander, as
sistant dean of students and director of the
Black Community Services Center, one of
the main goals of the retreat was to height
en the level of collaboration among the
communities.

Students engaged in icebreakers, lead
ership training and teamwork ac tivities de
signed to help them build lasting ties and to
encourage future collaboration.
Junior Patrick ('.hen, editor of Commu
nk Asians, a publication of the Asian Ameri
can Activities Center, said he learned a lot
about the different communities through
the various activities.
"It was especially surprising to learn that
almost none of us had visited the other eth
nic centers before," Chen said.
(lindy Ng, assistant director of the Asian
American Activities Center, explained that
the retreat established a basis for contact.
"People got to know each other across
centers and established at least some con
nections," Ng said.
Despite several directors' concerns that

bringing together such a large, intercultur
al group would prove challenging, most at
tendants felt that the interaction was suc
cessful.
"It was obvious that students felt they
were in a safe space to express ideas and to
share differences," Barker Alexander said.
During the two days, students partici
pated in brainstorming sessions and dis
cussed opportunities tor joint program
ming in the future — ranging from one
day events to quarterly programs.
Students agreed toexc hange rosters and
meet during the school year to continue the
planning. Since the retreat, many stall have
already been in contact with one another.
"The retreat was instrumental in
forming our attitudes for planning this
new year," said sophomore Emanuel

I'leitez, program coordinator at Kl Cen
tro (Ihicano.
Student staff have displayed a new level
of enthusiasm since the retreat, according
to Denni Woodward, assistant director of
the Native American (ailtural ('.enter.
"It helped hring life to students' jobs and
made their jobs more personal," Wood
ward said.
Student feedback, to the retreat has been
overwhelmingly positive. (.hen said lie feels
that tht' staff members benefited greatly
from coming together and sharing their
similar experiences.
"There should definitely Ik- more events
like the retreat since a lot of us, though dif
ferent in ethnicity, struggle for the same
things," Chen said. "Our histories
and present situations are very
much the same. All of us have faced
disc rimination of some form, and
all of us are fighting against it."
According to Clarke, the direc

tors plan to hold a similar retreat
next year and to expand upon the
foundation that has been laid.
Clarke said that he's encouraged by
the fact that many students have al
ready met since the retreat.
Woodward shares this excite
ment.
"It was a tremendous first ef
fort," she said. "We've started an
other tradition."
