# Organic fruits and vegetables are grown in the
## Life on the Farm 
### MICHELLE KELLER EDITOR STAFF 
Bright golden pear tomatoes; juicy, green
zebra tomatoes; plump, orange squashes —
you would expect this type of produce only at
a tanner's market or specialty grocery store, hut
it is actually grown right on campus, at the Stan
ford Community Farm.
Out past Governor's Corner and the engi
neering buildings lies a little organic farm orga
nized and run by Stanford community mem
bers — faculty, staff and students alike all work
on this piece of land and grow fruits, flowers
and vegetables.
Many faculty members, such as Biology Prof.
Paul Khrlich, have their own private plots. Stu
dents who request a plot at the beginning of the
year may also acquire a small patch of land on
which they can grow their own crops.
The Farm is partly managed by an advisory
board of student managers, facilities employees
and other community members with profes
sional, agricultural or environmental expertise.
The board meets once a quarter to address is
sues regarding the Farm.
For many students, the Farm is an escape
from the stresses of University and academic life.
Sophomore Fnessa Janes discovered the
Farm in her freshman year and decided to
work on a small private plot, as well as taking a
class at the Farm in the spring.
"To me, the Farm is a place where I go when
I need to unwind," |anes said. "It's a place
where good, happy people connect to the earth
by getting dirty and giving their time to the
land.
"1 decided to get my own plot after I visited
the Farm. It is an amazing place — so serene
and full of life. I couldn't stay away after 1 start
ed working. I would go almost every afternoon
and stay until it was too dark to weed anymore.
I always felt very satisfied and relaxed when I
was done."

Fhe Stanford Community Farm is com
pletely organic, which means that community
members who choose to work on the Farm can
not use pesticides, herbicides, fungicides or
chemical fertilizers.
Beginning Oct. 21, the United Stales De
partment of Agriculture will place stricter na
tional guidelines on what can be labeled as "or
ganic." Prior to this declaration, there were
many ways that organic growers could obtain
certification, but consumers often had no guar
antee that the produce they were purchasing
was indeed organic.
I he Stanford Community Farm, which has
long prided itself on its organic growing tech
niques, has decided not to seek certification, an
often expensive and time-consuming process.
Fhe Farm will no longer he able to maintain an
official "organic" designation.
Drew Harwell, the general manager of the
Farm, expressed the feelings of the community
members regarding this matter.
"Getting 'organic' certification costs a lot of
money for us to do and would be too great of a
challenge to do at this time. Fhe nature of the
Farm is that our guidelines are to grow stud or
ganically, and our community members re
spect that."
I'lie Farm has been involved in a number of
sustainable agriculture programs, including a
recent summer produce contract with Chi
Theta Chi known as a Community Supported
Agriculture program. Under this program, the
co-op paid a set amount per week and in return
got a heavy basket of fresh-picked produce.
"The one quote I heard this year that made
me so glad we were doing this was someone who
said 'the tomatoes were legendary,'" Harwell
said. "It's great that we were able to set up a pro
gram with the co-op so that the food we grow
stays on campus and feeds the community."
Harwell is also working with Jesse Cool, the
owner of the (100 I (lafe at the Cantor Arts Cen
ter, who is also on the advisory board. Last year

a group of'students picked and sold garlic to the
cafe, and Harwell hopes to set up more pro
duce sales and pick up the cafe's food scraps to
make compost this year.
"It's wonderful to see the loop closing up —
we're growing lootl used by the co-ops and
restaurants on campus and then picking up the
food waste to enrich our soils," Harwell said.
I his is what community agriculture is all
about."
In addition to its role as a haven for students
seeking peace and getting in touch with the
earth, the Farm has ;ilso functioned as a labora
tory for several classes.
Faith Systems ( .) ( .)\, a Student Initiated
Course that ran last spring, taught students the
basics of sustainable agriculture and intro
duced students to growing crops. The class was
led by a dedicated group of students, including
sophomore Abby I hill.
" The Farm provides the enrichment and en
joyment of viewing the food process from start
to finish, from planting the seeds to composting
food waste," Hall said. One not only learns the
theoretical aspects of sustainable agriculture,
but also learns the practical application of such
theories by getting down into the dirt.
"| Fhe Farm] represents an entire realm of
possibilities which exist outside of the conven
tional ideology, including the wonderful suc
cess of a fully organic, self-sustained style of gar
dening and agriculture amidst a world of shiny,

green, chemically laden lawns."
Junior Pepper Yelton, current
ly studying in Chile, was also one of
the student leaders of the class and
plans to teach again in the spring.
"The Farm class, the people I've
met there, and my own experi
mentation there have taught me
more about sustainable agricul
ture and lifestyles than any of my
classes," said Yelton.
"It has provided me with that
gift of experiential learning. I led
the class because I love the Farm
and what it has taught me, and 1
wanted to share both that love and
the knowledge that I had gained."

Currently, the advisory board is
seeking to set up more campus
composting programs, including a
program with one of the fraterni
ties, and possibly other dining ser
vices.
File board and student man
agers are also planning a Fall Har
vest Festival. The festival is slated
to run Nov. 2 and will feature live
music and food and will be open to
all members of the Stanford com
munity.
"The Farm is about to take a big
jump this year — there is a huge
buzz in the air about organic agri
culture, and students are really in
terested," said Harwell. "We had
over 90 people sign up with inter
est to work on the Farm at the ac
tivities fair, and 1 am excited to see
what the future will bring."
