Barak to speak at Stanford
On Oct. 16 at 7:30 p.m., former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
will be speaking at Memorial Auditorium on the prospects for peace in
the Middle East. After giving a prepared address, Barak will answer
questions from the audience.
Barak's appearance at Stanford is the first ASSU Speaker's Bureau
event of the academic year. Hillel at Stanford is the other co-host for
this event.
Tickets will be distributed by ASSU, most likely in White Plaza a week
before the event. As always, tickets are free to anyone with an SUID, but
will be distributed on a first come, first served basis.
Oldest meteorite to hit the Earth discovered
A research team recently published a study in the journal Science con
firming the age of the Earth's oldest meteorite collision, which took place
3.47 billion years ago, even before the meteorite collision that caused di
nosaurs to become extinct.
Although the location of the collision has not yet been discovered, ev
idence estimates the meteorite's diameter to have been about 12 miles.
"We are reporting on a single meteorite impact that has left deposits
in both South Africa and Australia," said Geological and Environmental
Sciences Prof. Donald R. Lowe, who co-authored the Science study. "We
have no idea where the actual impact might have been."
Lowe and fellow research teammates speculate that around 3.5 billion
years ago, the Earth was mostly covered with water and that the impact
of the meteorite would have caused massive tsunamis to occur, causing
massive erosion and a reformation of the ocean's floor.
Researchers study causes of civil conflict
Political scientists David Laitin and James Fearon have recently chal
lenged popular theories that civil wars result primarily from ethnic and
religious tension, instead proposing that most civil conflicts stem from
poverty, political instability and terrain conducive to guerrilla warfare.
"We shouldn't assume, as some policy makers in the Pentagon have
sometimes assumed, that this is a post-Cold War phase involving civil
wars that will go away and we'll be back to great-power politics," said
Fearon. "Rather, if our analysis is right, what we're really seeing is a
longer-term trend based on decolonization that created a system domi
nated numerically bv weak states."
