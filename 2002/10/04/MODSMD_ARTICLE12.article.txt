## Police hunt for killer in D.C. suburb 
### 
SILVER SPRING, Md. (AP) — A taxi
driver asked for an ambulance and
slumped, bleeding, onto a minivan; a
landscape! mowing the lawn at a car deal
ership stumbled and fell; a woman at a
post office slumped on a bench.
I hey were among five people felled
randomly by single shots, one by one in
public places in suburban Washington.
Police were searching fora "skilled
shooter" suspected of killing the five
within miles of each other, in busy com
mercial areas, in a 16-hour span
Wednesday and yesterday
The victims' names— Ramos, Martin,
Walekar, Buchanan, Lewis-Rivera — re
flect the ethnic diversity of the area just
outside the Capital Beltway. Among the
victims: a cab driver, a landscaper and a
government administrator.
While cautioning that the slayings had
not definitely been linked, police said it was
a strong possibility. None of the victims ap
peared to have been robbed and police said
race did not appear to be a motive.
A single shot apparently was fired at
each location, but it is unclear whether
they were fired from a vehicle or at what
range, police said.
Police said they did not have any eye
witnesses to the shootings, but one per
son reported seeing a white van with
two occupants speed from the scene of
one shooting.
"We do have someone that so far has
been very accurate in what they are at
tempting to do, and so we probably have
a skilled shooter," said Montgomery
County Police Chief Charles Moose.

Late yesterday, police continued to
stop white trucks and vans in the area. No
stolen vehicles were reported, police said.
Gov. Parris Glendening committed
140 state troopers, a helicopter and what
ever additional aid is needed, a
spokesman said.
The FBI, Secret Service, and ATF also
were involved, and officers were stopping
all white cargo vans in their search for the
killers, police said.
Officers collected security camera
videos from businesses near the shooting
scenes, including two grocery stores.
They also set up a tip hotline and offered
a reward of up to $50,000 for information
leading to the arrest and indictment of
the suspects.
"The phone lines are full," Capt.
Nancy Demme, a Montgomery County
police spokeswoman, said yesterday
night. "People are calling."
She said detectives were still waiting
for results from autopsies .
Montgomery County schools canceled
yesterday outdoor activities and locked
down school buildings. But classes con
tinued all day and the schools were ex
pected to open at regular times on today.
The killings began early Wednesday
evening. Around 6 p.m., James D. Mar
tin, 55, of Silver Spring, a program ana
lyst for the National Oceanic and Atmos
pheric Administration, was shot in the
parking lot of a Wheaton grocery store.
Around 7:45 a.m. yesterday, James L.
"Sonny" Buchanan, 39, Arlington, Va.,
was killed while cutting gl ass at a car deal
ership in the White Flint area. He stum-

bled toward the building before collapsing
as dozens of employees ran toward him.
"I just put my hand on his should and
said, 'Help is on the way,"' service direc
tor A1 Briggs told The Washington Post.
"But he was already gone."
Prenkumar Walekar, 54, of Olney,
was shot about 8:15 a.m., while pumping
gas into his cab at a Mobil station in the
Aspen Hill area.
About a half-hour later, Sarah Ramos,
34, of Silver Spring, died at a post office
next to the Leisure World retirement
community in Silver Spring.
Dolores Wallgren said she saw Ramos
slumped over on a bench, bleeding from
the head, when she arrived to go to a
beauty shop nearby.
"She was sitting on the bench, just sit
ting there," Wallgren said.
In the fifth shooting, Lori Ann Lewis-
Rivera, 25, of Silver Spring, was shot and
killed about 10 a.m. at a Shell gas station
in Kensington. Mechanics said they heard
the shot but didn't see who shot Lewis-
Rivera, who was vacuuming her van.
Late yesterday, someone placed two
small lit candles and a bouquet of carna
tions on the concrete base below the vac
uuming machine.
The killings brought the number of
homicides in Montgomery County to 25
this year.
The last time as many people were
killed in one day in the county was in July
1995, when a handyman's assistant killed
podiatrist David Marc Goff, his three
daughters and a contractor at GofFs
home in Potomac.
