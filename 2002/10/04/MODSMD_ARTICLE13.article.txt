# Republicans take N.J. case to high court
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans went to the
Supreme Court yesterday to try to stop New Jersey
Democrats from replacing Sen. Robert Torricelli on
the Nov. 5 ballot fora re-election race he seemed like
ly to lose. Control of the Senate could hang on the
court's reply.
The Republicans want the justices to block a unani
mous ruling from New Jersey's highest court that
would let former Sen. Frank Lautenberg jump in for
Torricelli, whose ethics problems had become the focus
of the race after he was admonished by the Senate.
Less than two years after the Bush v. Gore case set
tled the 2000 presidential fight, the Supreme Court
was once again in the middle of a high-stakes fight
over state election rules.
There was no immediate word whether the justices
would block the lower court ruling or agree to hear
the Republicans' broader constitutional complaints.
The court asked the New Jersey Democratic Party to
respond in writing to the GOP's legal filing.
Republicans argue it's too close to Election Day to
replace Torricelli and that the Democrats should not be
allowed to dump a candidate just because he's trailing.
"If the lower court ruling is allowed to stand, polit
ical parties will be encouraged to wit hdraw losing can
didates on the eve of election, replacing them with
candidates who have not gone through the rigors of
the nomination process in hopes of snatching victory
from the jaws of defeat," the GOP filing said.
New Jersey law bars replacement of candidates less
than 51 days before an election, the GOP said. The
lower court ruling would switch the candidates 33
days before Election Day, the party said.

Democrats control the Senate by one seat, so the
New Jersey race could be key in the Nov. 5 elections.
Democrats chose Lautenberg, 78, as Torricelli's re
placement on Tuesday and he was campaigning hard
yesterday, saying, "I realized how much I missed it."
Lautenberg, who retired from the Senate in 2001
after three terms, greeted commuters at a rail station
in Hoboken, N.J., then traveled to Washington to
meet with Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle.
