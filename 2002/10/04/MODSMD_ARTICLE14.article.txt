# Sentencing for Walker today
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — John
Walker Lindh and other al-Qaida
and Taliban prisoners told U.S. in
terrogators the Sept. 11 hijackings
were supposed to be the first of
three increasingly severe attacks
against Americans. Their claims
have not been corroborated, gov
ernment officials said.
Lindh will be sentenced today,
likely to 20 years in prison, for sup
plying services to the Taliban and
carrying an explosive during com
mission of a felony. He heard some
of the claims while serving in a 20-
man Taliban infantry unit of Arabic
speakers in Afghanistan, according
to people familiar with his account.
Authorities have gathered simi
lar information from prisoners of
various levels of the terrorist net
work. But the officials said the
United States hasn't found specific
plans for two additional large-scale
attacks and they suspect the claims
could involve disinformation or
folklore that circulated among
low-level terrorists and Taliban
soldiers after Sept. 11.
"We have not been able to cor
roborate the claims among the
thousands of pages of documents
and other evidence we have gath
ered the last year," one senior law
enforcement official said. "We be
lieve some of these prisoners may
have been trained to give misin
formation or simply were passing
on rumors."
One law enforcement official

said some al-Qaida and Taliban
prisoners said the second and
third wave attacks could involve
biological, chemical or radiologi
cal weapons to increase casualties
and were designed to paralyze
Americans with fear and cripple
the economy.
Details of Lindh's extensive in
terrogation, part of his plea agree
ment, remain secret. However,
Rohan Gunaratna, a terrorism ex
pert who worked with defense
lawyers and interviewed Lindh,
said the Californian told him he
picked up battlefield rumors about
two waves of post-Sept. 11 attacks.
Reading from his interview
notes, Gunaratna said Lindh told
him: "The original attack plan
was in three phases, totaling 20
separate attacks, the first phase
was two attacks on the World
Trade Center, an attack on the
Pentagon and a third attack on
the White House."
The notes also reflected that
Lindh said: "The second phase
of attacks was going to be using
biological agents and also at
tacks on natural gas and nuclear
infrastructure.
"The second phase was going to
make the U.S. forget about the first
phase. The third phase was to fin
ish the U.S. and was to take place
within the next six months (after
Sept. 11)."
Gunaratna said that while
Lindh used the word "biological,"

he believes from other sources that
the weapon could be a radiological
device, a so-called dirty bomb.
Gunaratna spoke with Lindh in
his jail cell for eight hours on July
25-26 as a defense consultant, and
submitted a report to a federal
judge that concluded Lindh never
swore loyalty to Osama bin Laden
and al-Qaida.
Still, Gunaratna said, Lindh
would be a valuable U.S. intelli
gence asset because he understood
what makes Islamic fundamental
ists join conflicts around the world.
Lindh also said he heard that 50
people were going on 20 suicide
missions, but added he received
the information on the front lines
in October — not prior to Sept. 11
when at a training camp, as his
original indictment indicated.
Officials have had indications
that additional attacks may have
been planned immediately after
Sept. 11.
For instance, shortly after the
jetliner crashed into the Pentagon,
German intelligence intercepted a
phone call from the United States
suggesting other terror teams
were on the ground and ready to
strike, U.S. and foreign intelli
gence officials say.
Officials said prisoners from the
war on terrorism, including some
kept at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,
have given similar accounts about
two more attacks that were sup
posed to follow Sept. 11.

Sept. 11.
For instance, shortly after the
jetliner crashed into the Pentagon,
German intelligence intercepted a
phone call from the United States
suggesting other terror teams
were on the ground and ready to
strike, U.S. and foreign intelli
gence officials say.
Officials said prisoners from the
war on terrorism, including some
kept at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,
have given similar accounts about
two more attacks that were sup
posed to follow Sept. 11.
