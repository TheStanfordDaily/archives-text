## The 						Stanford Daily Widening of Sand Hill will benefit commuters 
### 
Published Since 1891

The tentative decision at last
week's Menlo Park City Council
meeting to widen Sand Hill Road
is long overdue. Making a 1,100-
foot stretch of road into four lanes to match
the rest of the road is both a sensible and
practical decision. Furthermore, the Uni
versity has agreed to foot the bill, which is
estimated to be more than $15 million. The
city council has wisely agreed to accept the
University's generous offer, but is making a
prudent choice in doing more research
about Stanford's proposal to build a trail
next to the road to fulfill a condition in the
General Use Permit.
The widening of Sand Hill Road is a
complex issue involving Santa Clara
County, Menlo Park and Stanford, debat
ing over land use, money, legal and envi-

ronmental concerns. As part of a 1997
agreement, Stanford agreed to widen the
road and offered a deal to Menlo Park to
cover the costs of the expansion (then
$12.5 million). The current proposal actu
ally covers possible overrun costs and in
flation; it also requires a trail to run
through the area.
Once widened, the new road will allevi
ate a host of congestion problems. Most
centrally, the traffic bottleneck, which lo
cals there have complained about for
years, will be significantly lessened. Staff
and faculty headed to campus will no
longer have to allot as much time to arrive
for work. And students going from one
side of campus to another, or to the Stan
ford Shopping Center, can count on a
smoother trip as well. Parking and traffic

at Stanford are already so hectic that any
thing the University can do to improve the
congestion is much appreciated.
Furthermore, widening the road will en
sure that those ambulance drivers rushing
to the Stanford Hospital (which is just off
Sand Hill) can do so more efficiently, with
out trying to navigate through a sea of frus
trated drivers in the blocked area.
The fact that Stanford has agreed to pay
for the project is another reason the Menlo
Park City Council made a step in the right
direction. As one University official put it,
the roadwork would not get done if Stan
ford did not pay for it. As this part of the
road lies in Menlo Park, the University is
doing everything possible to help its own
community members drive in a safer area.
But it is not time to celebrate just yet.

Later this fall, the council will convene
again, this time with the benefit of addi
tional research about possible locations
where Stanford can place a trail. One ques
tion that must be answered is: Why does
the University insist on putting the trail
along Sand Hill Road? Environmentalists
and local residents have expressed concern
about locating the trail here. Before a deci
sion can be made, a serious and thorough
investigation needs to examine possible
trail locations.
It's unfortunate that the entire proposal
could be held up because of the trail issue,
but it might be necessary because the city
council members need more time to under
stand and research the many possible op
tions. They're the ones, after all, who will be
responsible for this decision.
