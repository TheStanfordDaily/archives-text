Iraq and Israel have little in common
I would like to address several points
raised by Thomas Taylor's letter ("U.S.
needs to 'resolve the problem of Israel',"
Oct. 3).
Mr. Taylor argues that there are simi
larities between Iraq and Israel that put Is
rael at a moral level at or below that of
Iraq. He mentions that whereas Iraq is
likely developing nuclear weapons, Israel
already has them. What he ignores is the
fact that in Israel's 54 years of existence, it
has been constantly pushed into defensive
wars. Yes, Israel has nuclear weapons, but
they have never been used, nor has Israel
threatened to use them, and I firmly be
lieve that they never will be unless there is
first a similar attack against Israel by an
enemy. On the other hand, Iran's ex-pres
ident stated in a speech at Tehran Univer
sity earlier this year that if the Islamic
world ever possessed nuclear weapons, a
single missile would level Israel, whereas
Israel's entire arsenal couldn't destroy the
Islamic world. 1 don't think anything
more convincing could be said about the
Islamic world's intentions for using their
weapons.
Taylor also suggests that Israel commits
human rights violations against the Pales
tinian people. 1 believe this allegation has
been widely spread and never corroborat
ed. What has been witnessed, however, is
Palestinian "corpses" waking up and run
ning out of the coffin when helicopters fly
overhead, and Palestinian terrorism
against Israel civilians on buses, in restau
rants and in schools. Palestinian violence
against Israel has always existed, and any
Israeli violence in return is out of self-de
fense. 1 firmly believe in the statement that
if the Palestinians put down their weapons
tomorrow, there would be no more vio
lence, but if the Israelis put theirs down,
there would be no more Israel.
Finally, in response to his insinuation
that the lAF is trigger-happy and likes to
drop bombs on (presumably unautho
rized) Arab targets, I would like to ask
Mr. Taylor a question: Do you like Wash
ington, D.C.? Do you like San Francisco?
Do you like New York City? You may
very well have Israel to thank for their ex
istence today. Were it not for Israel's
strategic bombing of an Iraqi nuclear fa
cility in 1981, Iraq would very likely have
nuclear weapons by now. Only the very
naive can possibly believe that it would
not have used them against the U.S., as
well as Israel.

Campus Watch seeks 'to scare people
away from independent thought 7
1 am writing to share my great pride in
Stanford for being one of the universities
listed by Campus Watch for our supposed
"anti-Israel and anti-American bias."
When a university is targeted by thought
control outfits like Campus Watch, we

must be doing something right.
I can understand why neo-conserva
tives like Daniel Pipes — who is so "unbi
ased" as to refer to our European allies'
objections to Bush's war drive as an in
fantile disorder — would get so nervous.
Alter all, Stanford has had demonstra
tions on both sides of the Israeli-Pales
tinian conflict, as well as counter-demon
strations, which have been peaceful and
informative. We have even had one
demonstration at the end of which both
sides joined together in a call for mutual
understanding and peace. That must be
a very upsetting example of "extremism"
to Campus Watch.
Faculty hold many different views on
the Middle East crisis. Prof Joel Beinin's
opinions are well-known, and he is al
ways upsetting conventional pro-Israel
attitudes. However, his many peer-re
viewed books on Egyptian Jews, Arab
workers, peasant movements, Israeli
politics and other topics which have been
published by major university presses
must strike Campus Watch as terribly
"shoddy." The fact that he is president of
the Middle East Studies Association must
be evidence that the entire field is
fraught with "extremism and intoler
ance" in their eyes. I can't imagine what
Daniel Pipes and his friends will say
when Stanford launches its Islamic stud
ies curriculum.
The fact is that slander and thought
control operations are all attempts to scare
people away from independent thought
and dissent. Academic freedom preserves
that independence, and I trust that the
Stanford community will uphold those
standards. So, we should be proud to be
targeted by such people — it means that
those who actually wish to undermine our
values are so desperate that they have to
resort to scare tactics. Soon, perhaps, there
will be watchdog groups keeping track of
the views of professors in our economics
department on international trade, in our
medical school on stem-cell research, and
in our English department on the proper
use of the subjunctive. If that were the
case, I would be delighted.

Excellence should be
rewarded with scholarships
It is not a fact that "all students walk into
Stanford equal," [as Laura Selznick, asso
ciate director for Undergraduate Re
search Programs, was quoted as saying in
"President's Scholars program to stop,"
Oct. 2J. Nor should it be an ideal. Some
students arrive better prepared than oth
ers; some are smarter than others; some
have more family money than others;
some already have better connections
than others; some have athletic abilities
that have given them access — for better or
for worse — to athletic scholarships.
Otherwise put: Some walk into Stan-

ford with scholarships from various
sources; some drive into Stanford with an
expensive sports car; some walk into Stan
ford with a scintillating address book;
some walk into Stanford with stunning
good looks. Students competed to get into
Stanford; graduates will compete outside
Stanford in the so-called "real world."
Not all students will get the same grade
point average (right now grades oscillate
between B'sand A's — a limited oscillation,
but they still oscillate). Some of these in
equalities are unfortunate; some are good
— especially those tied to academic merit.
Rampant egalitarianism has ham
strung the French university system, to
mention a once prestigious entity now in
total crisis. I hope that the termination of
the President's Scholars Program does
not mean that Stanford University has
given up on the idea that excellence can
and should be rewarded with merit
based scholarships, on top of admission.
We can certainly improve such pro
grams, but the ideology of "equality"
should not be the reason to terminate
them. It would be either hypocritical or
unreflective for a hyper-competitive
place like Stanford.

Beichman: U.S. 'champion of
human rights'
I note that the critics of my column
("United States finds itself alone in the
fight against Saddam," Oct. 1) utterly ig
nored my comments about the betrayal of

everything the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights stands for. [In the column]
I referred to the election of Libya as chair
of the UN Commission on Human Rights.
I referred to a CHR membership which
includes Sudan, Cuba and China. But my
critics found no difficulty in beating up on
the United States, a champion of human
rights — or do my critics think there is
some other country whose respect for
human rights exceeds ours?

U.S. 'greater threat 7 than Iraq
This letter is in response to Arnold Be
ichman's guest column ("United States
finds itself alone in the fight against Sad
dam," Oct. 1). Mr. Beichman raised an in
teresting question: "Who does the E.U. re
gard as the greater threat to world peace:
America or Saddam Hussein?"
My personal opinion is that the United
States is most definitely the greater threat
to world peace.
President Bush does not have any evi
dence of Saddam Hussein possessing
weapons of mass destruction or of his ca
pabilities to produce them. The British in
telligence community also found no evi
dence of such weapons capability a few
months ago. 1 doubt that if President Bush
had any real evidence, he would not get
widespread support from European
countries. However, even if Saddam Hus
sein had the alleged capabilities, he might
be a threat to peace in the Middle East, but
certainly not to world peace.

On the other hand, let's think about the
United States. Saddam Hussein would
probably not be anywhere close to having
weapons of mass destruction if it weren't
for the U.S. Without the U.S., the Taliban
would probably never have ruled
Afghanistan and been able to support al-
Qaida (and it is questionable whether 9/11
would have happened). In addition, dicta
tors such as General Pinochet or Manuel
Noriega would never have gained power
or remained in powerful positions without
the help of the U.S. Both dictators were
well known for their constant violations of
human rights.
Just a few days ago, I read that the U.S.
is resuming military aid to Pakistan, disre
garding the fact that Pakistan has a mili
tary dictator, disregards human rights,
has nuclear capabilities and is on the verge
of war with its neighbor, India. It is good
to know that the U.S. leadership learns
from past mistakes.
I stopped believing that the U.S. cares
about world peace a long time ago. Let's
not kid ourselves: This whole thing is
about oil and about distracting from
Bush's domestic problems. And after Bush
isolated the U.S. with his foreign policy
(regarding the International Criminal
Court, the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty and
the Middle East conflict), he now gets the
bill — which is just fair play in internation
al politics.
Even if Saddam Hussein had some
weapons of mass destruction, he could
never do as much harm as the U.S. has
been doing in the world.

Campus Watch seeks 'to scare people
away from independent thought 7
1 am writing to share my great pride in
Stanford for being one of the universities
listed by Campus Watch for our supposed
"anti-Israel and anti-American bias."
When a university is targeted by thought
control outfits like Campus Watch, we

must be doing something right.
I can understand why neo-conserva
tives like Daniel Pipes — who is so "unbi
ased" as to refer to our European allies'
objections to Bush's war drive as an in
fantile disorder — would get so nervous.
Alter all, Stanford has had demonstra
tions on both sides of the Israeli-Pales
tinian conflict, as well as counter-demon
strations, which have been peaceful and
informative. We have even had one
demonstration at the end of which both
sides joined together in a call for mutual
understanding and peace. That must be
a very upsetting example of "extremism"
to Campus Watch.
Faculty hold many different views on
the Middle East crisis. Prof Joel Beinin's
opinions are well-known, and he is al
ways upsetting conventional pro-Israel
attitudes. However, his many peer-re
viewed books on Egyptian Jews, Arab
workers, peasant movements, Israeli
politics and other topics which have been
published by major university presses
must strike Campus Watch as terribly
"shoddy." The fact that he is president of
the Middle East Studies Association must
be evidence that the entire field is
fraught with "extremism and intoler
ance" in their eyes. I can't imagine what
Daniel Pipes and his friends will say
when Stanford launches its Islamic stud
ies curriculum.
The fact is that slander and thought
control operations are all attempts to scare
people away from independent thought
and dissent. Academic freedom preserves
that independence, and I trust that the
Stanford community will uphold those
standards. So, we should be proud to be
targeted by such people — it means that
those who actually wish to undermine our
values are so desperate that they have to
resort to scare tactics. Soon, perhaps, there
will be watchdog groups keeping track of
the views of professors in our economics
department on international trade, in our
medical school on stem-cell research, and
in our English department on the proper
use of the subjunctive. If that were the
case, I would be delighted.

Excellence should be
rewarded with scholarships
It is not a fact that "all students walk into
Stanford equal," [as Laura Selznick, asso
ciate director for Undergraduate Re
search Programs, was quoted as saying in
"President's Scholars program to stop,"
Oct. 2J. Nor should it be an ideal. Some
students arrive better prepared than oth
ers; some are smarter than others; some
have more family money than others;
some already have better connections
than others; some have athletic abilities
that have given them access — for better or
for worse — to athletic scholarships.
Otherwise put: Some walk into Stan-

ford with scholarships from various
sources; some drive into Stanford with an
expensive sports car; some walk into Stan
ford with a scintillating address book;
some walk into Stanford with stunning
good looks. Students competed to get into
Stanford; graduates will compete outside
Stanford in the so-called "real world."
Not all students will get the same grade
point average (right now grades oscillate
between B'sand A's — a limited oscillation,
but they still oscillate). Some of these in
equalities are unfortunate; some are good
— especially those tied to academic merit.
Rampant egalitarianism has ham
strung the French university system, to
mention a once prestigious entity now in
total crisis. I hope that the termination of
the President's Scholars Program does
not mean that Stanford University has
given up on the idea that excellence can
and should be rewarded with merit
based scholarships, on top of admission.
We can certainly improve such pro
grams, but the ideology of "equality"
should not be the reason to terminate
them. It would be either hypocritical or
unreflective for a hyper-competitive
place like Stanford.

Beichman: U.S. 'champion of
human rights'
I note that the critics of my column
("United States finds itself alone in the
fight against Saddam," Oct. 1) utterly ig
nored my comments about the betrayal of

everything the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights stands for. [In the column]
I referred to the election of Libya as chair
of the UN Commission on Human Rights.
I referred to a CHR membership which
includes Sudan, Cuba and China. But my
critics found no difficulty in beating up on
the United States, a champion of human
rights — or do my critics think there is
some other country whose respect for
human rights exceeds ours?

U.S. 'greater threat 7 than Iraq
This letter is in response to Arnold Be
ichman's guest column ("United States
finds itself alone in the fight against Sad
dam," Oct. 1). Mr. Beichman raised an in
teresting question: "Who does the E.U. re
gard as the greater threat to world peace:
America or Saddam Hussein?"
My personal opinion is that the United
States is most definitely the greater threat
to world peace.
President Bush does not have any evi
dence of Saddam Hussein possessing
weapons of mass destruction or of his ca
pabilities to produce them. The British in
telligence community also found no evi
dence of such weapons capability a few
months ago. 1 doubt that if President Bush
had any real evidence, he would not get
widespread support from European
countries. However, even if Saddam Hus
sein had the alleged capabilities, he might
be a threat to peace in the Middle East, but
certainly not to world peace.

On the other hand, let's think about the
United States. Saddam Hussein would
probably not be anywhere close to having
weapons of mass destruction if it weren't
for the U.S. Without the U.S., the Taliban
would probably never have ruled
Afghanistan and been able to support al-
Qaida (and it is questionable whether 9/11
would have happened). In addition, dicta
tors such as General Pinochet or Manuel
Noriega would never have gained power
or remained in powerful positions without
the help of the U.S. Both dictators were
well known for their constant violations of
human rights.
Just a few days ago, I read that the U.S.
is resuming military aid to Pakistan, disre
garding the fact that Pakistan has a mili
tary dictator, disregards human rights,
has nuclear capabilities and is on the verge
of war with its neighbor, India. It is good
to know that the U.S. leadership learns
from past mistakes.
I stopped believing that the U.S. cares
about world peace a long time ago. Let's
not kid ourselves: This whole thing is
about oil and about distracting from
Bush's domestic problems. And after Bush
isolated the U.S. with his foreign policy
(regarding the International Criminal
Court, the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty and
the Middle East conflict), he now gets the
bill — which is just fair play in internation
al politics.
Even if Saddam Hussein had some
weapons of mass destruction, he could
never do as much harm as the U.S. has
been doing in the world.

Iraq and Israel have little in common
I would like to address several points
raised by Thomas Taylor's letter ("U.S.
needs to 'resolve the problem of Israel',"
Oct. 3).
Mr. Taylor argues that there are simi
larities between Iraq and Israel that put Is
rael at a moral level at or below that of
Iraq. He mentions that whereas Iraq is
likely developing nuclear weapons, Israel
already has them. What he ignores is the
fact that in Israel's 54 years of existence, it
has been constantly pushed into defensive
wars. Yes, Israel has nuclear weapons, but
they have never been used, nor has Israel
threatened to use them, and I firmly be
lieve that they never will be unless there is
first a similar attack against Israel by an
enemy. On the other hand, Iran's ex-pres
ident stated in a speech at Tehran Univer
sity earlier this year that if the Islamic
world ever possessed nuclear weapons, a
single missile would level Israel, whereas
Israel's entire arsenal couldn't destroy the
Islamic world. 1 don't think anything
more convincing could be said about the
Islamic world's intentions for using their
weapons.
Taylor also suggests that Israel commits
human rights violations against the Pales
tinian people. 1 believe this allegation has
been widely spread and never corroborat
ed. What has been witnessed, however, is
Palestinian "corpses" waking up and run
ning out of the coffin when helicopters fly
overhead, and Palestinian terrorism
against Israel civilians on buses, in restau
rants and in schools. Palestinian violence
against Israel has always existed, and any
Israeli violence in return is out of self-de
fense. 1 firmly believe in the statement that
if the Palestinians put down their weapons
tomorrow, there would be no more vio
lence, but if the Israelis put theirs down,
there would be no more Israel.
Finally, in response to his insinuation
that the lAF is trigger-happy and likes to
drop bombs on (presumably unautho
rized) Arab targets, I would like to ask
Mr. Taylor a question: Do you like Wash
ington, D.C.? Do you like San Francisco?
Do you like New York City? You may
very well have Israel to thank for their ex
istence today. Were it not for Israel's
strategic bombing of an Iraqi nuclear fa
cility in 1981, Iraq would very likely have
nuclear weapons by now. Only the very
naive can possibly believe that it would
not have used them against the U.S., as

values are so desperate that they have to
resort to scare tactics. Soon, perhaps, there
will be watchdog groups keeping track of
the views of professors in our economics
department on international trade, in our
medical school on stem-cell research, and
in our English department on the proper
use of the subjunctive. If that were the
case, I would be delighted.

Excellence should be
rewarded with scholarships
It is not a fact that "all students walk into
Stanford equal," [as Laura Selznick, asso
ciate director for Undergraduate Re
search Programs, was quoted as saying in
"President's Scholars program to stop,"
Oct. 2J. Nor should it be an ideal. Some
students arrive better prepared than oth
ers; some are smarter than others; some
have more family money than others;
some already have better connections
than others; some have athletic abilities
that have given them access — for better or
for worse — to athletic scholarships.
Otherwise put: Some walk into Stan-

ford with scholarships from various
sources; some drive into Stanford with an
expensive sports car; some walk into Stan
ford with a scintillating address book;
some walk into Stanford with stunning
good looks. Students competed to get into
Stanford; graduates will compete outside
Stanford in the so-called "real world."
Not all students will get the same grade
point average (right now grades oscillate
between B'sand A's — a limited oscillation,
but they still oscillate). Some of these in
equalities are unfortunate; some are good
— especially those tied to academic merit.
Rampant egalitarianism has ham
strung the French university system, to
mention a once prestigious entity now in
total crisis. I hope that the termination of
the President's Scholars Program does
not mean that Stanford University has
given up on the idea that excellence can
and should be rewarded with merit
based scholarships, on top of admission.
We can certainly improve such pro
grams, but the ideology of "equality"
should not be the reason to terminate
them. It would be either hypocritical or
unreflective for a hyper-competitive
place like Stanford.

Beichman: U.S. 'champion of
human rights'
I note that the critics of my column
("United States finds itself alone in the
fight against Saddam," Oct. 1) utterly ig
nored my comments about the betrayal of

everything the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights stands for. [In the column]
I referred to the election of Libya as chair
of the UN Commission on Human Rights.
I referred to a CHR membership which
includes Sudan, Cuba and China. But my
critics found no difficulty in beating up on
the United States, a champion of human
rights — or do my critics think there is
some other country whose respect for
human rights exceeds ours?

U.S. 'greater threat 7 than Iraq
This letter is in response to Arnold Be
ichman's guest column ("United States
finds itself alone in the fight against Sad
dam," Oct. 1). Mr. Beichman raised an in
teresting question: "Who does the E.U. re
gard as the greater threat to world peace:
America or Saddam Hussein?"
My personal opinion is that the United
States is most definitely the greater threat
to world peace.
President Bush does not have any evi
dence of Saddam Hussein possessing
weapons of mass destruction or of his ca
pabilities to produce them. The British in
telligence community also found no evi
dence of such weapons capability a few
months ago. 1 doubt that if President Bush
had any real evidence, he would not get
widespread support from European
countries. However, even if Saddam Hus
sein had the alleged capabilities, he might
be a threat to peace in the Middle East, but
certainly not to world peace.

On the other hand, let's think about the
United States. Saddam Hussein would
probably not be anywhere close to having
weapons of mass destruction if it weren't
for the U.S. Without the U.S., the Taliban
would probably never have ruled
Afghanistan and been able to support al-
Qaida (and it is questionable whether 9/11
would have happened). In addition, dicta
tors such as General Pinochet or Manuel
Noriega would never have gained power
or remained in powerful positions without
the help of the U.S. Both dictators were
well known for their constant violations of
human rights.
Just a few days ago, I read that the U.S.
is resuming military aid to Pakistan, disre
garding the fact that Pakistan has a mili
tary dictator, disregards human rights,
has nuclear capabilities and is on the verge
of war with its neighbor, India. It is good
to know that the U.S. leadership learns
from past mistakes.
I stopped believing that the U.S. cares
about world peace a long time ago. Let's
not kid ourselves: This whole thing is
about oil and about distracting from
Bush's domestic problems. And after Bush
isolated the U.S. with his foreign policy
(regarding the International Criminal
Court, the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty and
the Middle East conflict), he now gets the
bill — which is just fair play in internation
al politics.
Even if Saddam Hussein had some
weapons of mass destruction, he could
never do as much harm as the U.S. has
been doing in the world.

Iraq and Israel have little in common
I would like to address several points
raised by Thomas Taylor's letter ("U.S.
needs to 'resolve the problem of Israel',"
Oct. 3).
Mr. Taylor argues that there are simi
larities between Iraq and Israel that put Is
rael at a moral level at or below that of
Iraq. He mentions that whereas Iraq is
likely developing nuclear weapons, Israel
already has them. What he ignores is the
fact that in Israel's 54 years of existence, it
has been constantly pushed into defensive
wars. Yes, Israel has nuclear weapons, but
they have never been used, nor has Israel
threatened to use them, and I firmly be
lieve that they never will be unless there is
first a similar attack against Israel by an
enemy. On the other hand, Iran's ex-pres
ident stated in a speech at Tehran Univer
sity earlier this year that if the Islamic
world ever possessed nuclear weapons, a
single missile would level Israel, whereas
Israel's entire arsenal couldn't destroy the
Islamic world. 1 don't think anything
more convincing could be said about the
Islamic world's intentions for using their
weapons.
Taylor also suggests that Israel commits
human rights violations against the Pales
tinian people. 1 believe this allegation has
been widely spread and never corroborat
ed. What has been witnessed, however, is
Palestinian "corpses" waking up and run
ning out of the coffin when helicopters fly
overhead, and Palestinian terrorism
against Israel civilians on buses, in restau
rants and in schools. Palestinian violence
against Israel has always existed, and any
Israeli violence in return is out of self-de
fense. 1 firmly believe in the statement that
if the Palestinians put down their weapons
tomorrow, there would be no more vio
lence, but if the Israelis put theirs down,
there would be no more Israel.
Finally, in response to his insinuation
that the lAF is trigger-happy and likes to
drop bombs on (presumably unautho
rized) Arab targets, I would like to ask
Mr. Taylor a question: Do you like Wash
ington, D.C.? Do you like San Francisco?
Do you like New York City? You may
very well have Israel to thank for their ex
istence today. Were it not for Israel's
strategic bombing of an Iraqi nuclear fa
cility in 1981, Iraq would very likely have
nuclear weapons by now. Only the very
naive can possibly believe that it would
not have used them against the U.S., as
well as Israel.

Campus Watch seeks 'to scare people
away from independent thought 7
1 am writing to share my great pride in
Stanford for being one of the universities
listed by Campus Watch for our supposed
"anti-Israel and anti-American bias."
When a university is targeted by thought
control outfits like Campus Watch, we

must be doing something right.
I can understand why neo-conserva
tives like Daniel Pipes — who is so "unbi
ased" as to refer to our European allies'
objections to Bush's war drive as an in
fantile disorder — would get so nervous.
Alter all, Stanford has had demonstra
tions on both sides of the Israeli-Pales
tinian conflict, as well as counter-demon
strations, which have been peaceful and
informative. We have even had one
demonstration at the end of which both
sides joined together in a call for mutual
understanding and peace. That must be
a very upsetting example of "extremism"
to Campus Watch.
Faculty hold many different views on
the Middle East crisis. Prof Joel Beinin's
opinions are well-known, and he is al
ways upsetting conventional pro-Israel
attitudes. However, his many peer-re
viewed books on Egyptian Jews, Arab
workers, peasant movements, Israeli
politics and other topics which have been
published by major university presses
must strike Campus Watch as terribly
"shoddy." The fact that he is president of
the Middle East Studies Association must
be evidence that the entire field is
fraught with "extremism and intoler
ance" in their eyes. I can't imagine what
Daniel Pipes and his friends will say
when Stanford launches its Islamic stud
ies curriculum.
The fact is that slander and thought
control operations are all attempts to scare
people away from independent thought
and dissent. Academic freedom preserves
that independence, and I trust that the
Stanford community will uphold those
standards. So, we should be proud to be
targeted by such people — it means that
those who actually wish to undermine our
values are so desperate that they have to
resort to scare tactics. Soon, perhaps, there
will be watchdog groups keeping track of
the views of professors in our economics
department on international trade, in our
medical school on stem-cell research, and
in our English department on the proper
use of the subjunctive. If that were the
case, I would be delighted.
