# Web allows students to evaluate profs
## Sites do not require registration, leading to both easier use and greater skepticism

In an online rating of a Stanford profes
sor, one anonymous critic wrote, "He looks
like the devil, but he's really engaging."
"He" is Philip Zimbardo, and he is one of
the most well-known and respected psy
chology professors at Stanford, but to those
who know him through Ratemyprofes
sors.com, he is an egomaniac with a Satanic
appearance, 2 points for sexiness and an
overall quality rating of 3.8 out of 5.
Ratemyprofessors.com is one of the many
online professor rating systems that have
sprung up in recent years, providing stu
dents and people posing as students with
outlets for commenting on college and uni
versity professors. At ratemyprofessors.com,
professors are critiqued based on helpful
ness, easiness, clarity, sexiness — marked by
a chili-pepper icon — and an overall nu
meric scale from one to live, with five being
the best.
With over 244,000 ratings posted, in
cluding 24 Stanford professors from a wide
range of departments, Ratemyprofes
sors.com has more ratings than all other
public ratings systems online. Myprofes
sorsucks.com, a similar Web site with close
to 9,000 ratings, is in a distant second place.
John Swapceinski, founder and presi

dent of Ratemyprofessors.com, came up
with the idea for the Web site while pursu
ing a master's in computer science at San
Jose State University.
"I had one particularly dastardly pro
fessor for one of my classes and, after
wards, wished one of my friends had
warned me about her. Then I thought, 'If
only there were a Web site,' " he recalls.
Swapceinski began work on the Web
site in February of 1999 and it debuted in
May of that year.
According to Swapceinski, one of the
major reasons for his site's success is the fact
that it does not require user log-ins. Kasey
Kerber, founder and president of mypro
fessorsucks.com, also attributes part of his
site's success to lack of user log-ins.
This means that although students will
not be bombarded by junk e-mail as a re
sult of user registration, none of the peo
ple visiting the site have to identify them
selves. Moreover, none of the people post
ing ratings have to authenticate them
selves as students.
Unlike the ASSU Course Guide, which
requires that its users be affiliated with the
University, sites like ratemyprofessors.com
and myprofessorsucks.com allow for any
one harboring resentment towards a certain
professor — whether it be academic-related
or not — to publicize negative and some
times false statements about professors.
According to both Swapceinski and
Kerber, there is virtually no way to ensure
the authenticity of visitors on public pro
fessor-rating Web sites.
As Swapceinski put it, "It's pretty much

impossible for us to ensure the authenticity
of comments on the site. It is really up to the
users to take care in what they write."
However, both ratemyprofessors.com
and myprofessorsucks.com have teams of
people reading every comment to filter out
libel and profanity. In fact, Kerber said that
the first page of his site was the legal dis
claimer page, which is intended to ward oil
complaints from professors.
Another safeguard is what Kerber called
"the defense times three effect," meaning
that for every false evaluation of a professor,
Kerber has found that three positive evalu
ations will be posted overnight.
Additionally, both Kerber and Swap
ceinski noted that the majority of their pro
fessor reviews are positive (close to 60 per
cent on both sites), arguing that this shows
that their sites are not just places for angry
students to rant about their professors.
Nevertheless, several Stanford stu
dents said they feel that a site without nec
essary authentication procedures is not
trustworthy.
Senior Zadok Sacks for example said, "I
wouldn't look at a professor ratings Web site
if just anybody could post ratings on it."
Olivia Horton is also senior who, like
Zadock, frequently uses the ASSU Course
Guide. She said that she might look at a
public site as a secondary source, but would
never make decisions on classes based sole
ly on a public site.
As for the professors, many of those rated
on ratemyprofessors.com (no Stanford pro
fessors are rated on myprofessorsucks.com)
are unaware of it.

History professor Jack Rakove, who is
one of the few professors aware of being
rated on ratemyprofessors.com, feels that
public ratings of professors could not possi
bly be trustworthy and said that he would
never pay attention to his rating on a public
Web site.
As for his colleagues' feelings about the
ratings, he said, "I'd be amazed if anyone
paid attention to them."
Despite the fact that the ASSU Course
Guide managers have received criticism —
which, according to course guide employee
Curtis Spencer, relates mostly to evaluation
data being in error — students who use the
site frequently seem to see it as an effective
aid in deciding which classes to take.
"I basically decide what classes to take
based on what the ASSU guide says," said se
nior Meena Mallipeddi.

The ASSU Course Guide does not have
a "quote of the day," or a "college chat"
like myprofessorsucks.com, nor does it
have a list of the funniest ratings from
other schools, like ratemyprofessors.com.
However, it does provide a comprehen
sive evaluation of Stanford professors
based on opinions of students who must
have been enrolled in the class in order to
rate its teachers.
According to Prof. Rakove, the best way
to choose a class is "Tea leaves and chicken
entrails, supplemented by astrological
charts and the sayings of Nostradamus."
Perhaps, but if there is an effective tool
aside from word of mouth, first-hand expe
rience during shopping period, or chicken
entrails, Stanford students have at their dis
posal not only the ASSU guide, but also sex
iness ratings and smiley faces.

range of departments, Ratemyprofes
sors.com has more ratings than all other
public ratings systems online. Myprofes
sorsucks.com, a similar Web site with close
to 9,000 ratings, is in a distant second place.
John Swapceinski, founder and presi

dent of Ratemyprofessors.com, came up
with the idea for the Web site while pursu
ing a master's in computer science at San
Jose State University.
"I had one particularly dastardly pro
fessor for one of my classes and, after
wards, wished one of my friends had
warned me about her. Then I thought, 'If
only there were a Web site,' " he recalls.
Swapceinski began work on the Web
site in February of 1999 and it debuted in
May of that year.
According to Swapceinski, one of the
major reasons for his site's success is the fact
that it does not require user log-ins. Kasey
Kerber, founder and president of mypro
fessorsucks.com, also attributes part of his
site's success to lack of user log-ins.
This means that although students will
not be bombarded by junk e-mail as a re
sult of user registration, none of the peo
ple visiting the site have to identify them
selves. Moreover, none of the people post
ing ratings have to authenticate them
selves as students.
Unlike the ASSU Course Guide, which
requires that its users be affiliated with the
University, sites like ratemyprofessors.com
and myprofessorsucks.com allow for any
one harboring resentment towards a certain
professor — whether it be academic-related
or not — to publicize negative and some
times false statements about professors.
According to both Swapceinski and
Kerber, there is virtually no way to ensure
the authenticity of visitors on public pro
fessor-rating Web sites.
As Swapceinski put it, "It's pretty much

impossible for us to ensure the authenticity
of comments on the site. It is really up to the
users to take care in what they write."
However, both ratemyprofessors.com
and myprofessorsucks.com have teams of
people reading every comment to filter out
libel and profanity. In fact, Kerber said that
the first page of his site was the legal dis
claimer page, which is intended to ward oil
complaints from professors.
Another safeguard is what Kerber called
"the defense times three effect," meaning
that for every false evaluation of a professor,
Kerber has found that three positive evalu
ations will be posted overnight.
Additionally, both Kerber and Swap
ceinski noted that the majority of their pro
fessor reviews are positive (close to 60 per
cent on both sites), arguing that this shows
that their sites are not just places for angry
students to rant about their professors.
Nevertheless, several Stanford stu
dents said they feel that a site without nec
essary authentication procedures is not
trustworthy.
Senior Zadok Sacks for example said, "I
wouldn't look at a professor ratings Web site
if just anybody could post ratings on it."
Olivia Horton is also senior who, like
Zadock, frequently uses the ASSU Course
Guide. She said that she might look at a
public site as a secondary source, but would
never make decisions on classes based sole
ly on a public site.
As for the professors, many of those rated
on ratemyprofessors.com (no Stanford pro
fessors are rated on myprofessorsucks.com)
are unaware of it.

History professor Jack Rakove, who is
one of the few professors aware of being
rated on ratemyprofessors.com, feels that
public ratings of professors could not possi
bly be trustworthy and said that he would
never pay attention to his rating on a public
Web site.
As for his colleagues' feelings about the
ratings, he said, "I'd be amazed if anyone
paid attention to them."
Despite the fact that the ASSU Course
Guide managers have received criticism —
which, according to course guide employee
Curtis Spencer, relates mostly to evaluation
data being in error — students who use the
site frequently seem to see it as an effective
aid in deciding which classes to take.
"I basically decide what classes to take
based on what the ASSU guide says," said se
nior Meena Mallipeddi.

The ASSU Course Guide does not have
a "quote of the day," or a "college chat"
like myprofessorsucks.com, nor does it
have a list of the funniest ratings from
other schools, like ratemyprofessors.com.
However, it does provide a comprehen
sive evaluation of Stanford professors
based on opinions of students who must
have been enrolled in the class in order to
rate its teachers.
According to Prof. Rakove, the best way
to choose a class is "Tea leaves and chicken
entrails, supplemented by astrological
charts and the sayings of Nostradamus."
Perhaps, but if there is an effective tool
aside from word of mouth, first-hand expe
rience during shopping period, or chicken
entrails, Stanford students have at their dis
posal not only the ASSU guide, but also sex
iness ratings and smiley faces.

In an online rating of a Stanford profes

like the devil, but he's really engaging."
"He" is Philip Zimbardo, and he is one of
the most well-known and respected psy

who know him through Ratemyprofes

appearance, 2 points for sexiness and an
overall quality rating of 3.8 out of 5.
