## Card seeks redemption at Notre Dame 
### MATT LONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Tomorrow's trip to South Bend, Ind., to
face Notre Dame was supposed to be about a
reunion. But now its about redemption.
The Cardinal (1-2, 0-1 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) will try to rebound from a humiliating
65-24 loss at Arizona State, a defeat which has
turned the once optimistic Cardinal to doubts
about its confrontation with Fighting Irish
coach Tyrone Willingham, who left Stanford
in January to take over college football's most
storied program. Still, new Cardinal head
coach Buddy Teevens feels that while the
team's confidence took a hit in last weekend's
blowout, it will climb back up.
"[Monday] night we watched tape and the
players are very upbeat and very excited about
Notre Dame," Teevens said. "One thing about
youth is that they forget quickly. Hopefully
the lesson has been learned."
The Cardinal would love to give a lesson to
Willingham's new team, but Stanford is a se
vere underdog in the contest, as Notre Dame
has defied all expectations this season. The
Irish have stormed to a 4-0 record and a No. 9
national ranking, and football fever has re
turned to South Bend. The citizens' blood has
turned back into gold after a series of disap
pointing teams left the school wondering if the
glory days would ever return.
Even with its early success, Notre Dame still
has a few questions that need answering if the
Irish hope to compete fora national title.
While composure, perseverance and luck

have all been on the team's side this season,
the Irish have not established an offensive
presence. The offense did not score a touch
down until the third game against No. 7
Michigan, and starting quarterback Carlyle
Holiday is listed as day-to-day with a shoulder
injury, leaving former walk-on Pat Dillingham
to lead Notre Dame.
After Holiday's injury against Michigan
State, Dillingham rallied the Irish to a 21-17
victory, as Arnaz Battle took his short pass 60
yards fora touchdown with 1:15 remaining.
Quarterback woes plague the Cardinal as
well. With the expected return of senior tail
back Kerry Carter and junior flanker Luke
Powell from injuries, Stanford will put its best
team on the field against its former coach, but
the quarterback question has been hanging
over the Cardinal's head all week. Both junior
Chris Lewis and redshirt freshman Kyle Mat
ter failed to impress against the Sun Devils last
week, and Teevens will not announce the
starter prior to the game.
Willingham says the Irish will not prepare
differently for either passer, and he has the
unique ability to evaluate Stanford's signal
callers, because he has spent more time coach
ing each player than has Teevens.
"Both of them will work very comfortably,"
he said. "Chris is a little bigger, a little stronger
and a little more athletic. Kyle is a very tough
smaller guy, not a bad athlete, but very precise
in his ability to read coverage."
But even though Willingham and his staff
intimately know most of the players Stanford
will put on the field, he feels it ultimately offers

little advantage.
"I probably will say that there will be more
attention paid to that than is due," Willing
ham said. "I think coach leevens has made
that very clear, that their system is very differ
ent that the one we employed a year ago."
Still, Willingham has not discounted the
opportunity that Stanford's coaches will use
his former players as a resource to gain in
sider knowledge into his game plan, and ad
mits that some subtle changes will be made
to signals.
With the national attention (including
Notre Dame's weekly coverage by NBC) and
emotion surrounding the game, both coaches
were quick to simplify the contest into just an
other game.
"We're not playing the coaching staff, we're
playing the players," Teevens said. "It's a
great opportunity to play a great team regard
less of who's coaching them."
For the Cardinal, a win would give its coach
the biggest victory of his career and be a huge
confidence booster before getting into the full
swing of conference play and competing fora
bowl berth. For the Irish, a win would put
them in prime position fora BCS bowl and
allow Willingham to beat the team to which he
devoted ten years of his life.
"I'll probably have the full range of emo
tions about those guys, because those are guys
[that] I've gone in their houses, sat down and
had dinner with them," Willingham said. "But
again, once we get to the ballgame they will be
fierce competitors, and they will do everything
they can to win the ballgame."
