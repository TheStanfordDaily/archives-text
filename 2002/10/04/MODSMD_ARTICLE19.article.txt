# The 						best offense? Good defense
## Mike Goolsby helps lead opportunistic Irish unit 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
If you score 17 points and limit
the opposing team's offense to a
lone field goal, it means you've
won the game, right?
Well, yes — against most teams.
But, as Purdue (3-2) found out
on Sept. 7 in South Bend, Ind., if
you want to stop No. 9 Notre Dame
(4-0), you've got to keep its defense
out of the end zone, too. The Boil
ermakers fell, 24-17, as Notre Dame
returned two fumbles for touch
downs and ran back an interception
for the winning touchdown.
Stanford's (1-2, 0-1 Pacific-10
Conference) strength is its offense;
Notre Dame's is defense. On Sat
urday, junior Notre Dame line
backer Mike Goolsby foresees an
other opportunistic performance
by the Irish defense.
"Part of doing what we do is cre
ating turnovers, and not just creat
ing them but scoring on them as
well," Goolsby said.
Goolsby, along with senior
standout Courtney Watson, an
chors the middle of a Notre Dame
defense that is holding opponents
to a meager 2.6 yards per rush,
and an equally stingy 5.8 yards per
pass attempt.
Goolsby leads the team with
30 tackles and six tackles-for-a
loss, statistically overshadowing
even Watson.
Despite its stellar performance
thus far, Goolsby feels the defense
is just getting started.
" There's so much stuff we can
fix," he said. "Just little things,
like turning a tackle fora loss into
a fumble."
It's been an eventful year for
Goolsby and the rest of the Irish,
who saw their hopes of going to a
bowl game eliminated when Stan
ford defeated them, 17-14, guar
anteeing Notre Dame a losing sea
son. The Irish finished at 5-6 and
Stanford at 9-3.
Now, head coach Tyrone Will
ingham is on the other side of the
field, but he once again enters the
game with the favored team.
Goolsby, not surprisingly, is
very happy to have Willingham in
Irish colors.
"From the get-go, we accepted
him with open arms, due to the
fact that we had been through so
much," Goolsby said, referring
to the firing of Bob Davie and the
hiring and subsequent dismissal
of George O'Leary due to re
sume inaccuracies.

Willingham, so far, seems to have
unlocked Notre Dame's potential.
"We always knew the talent was
there, and the desire was there,"
Goolsby said. "We finally got
somebody that pointed us in the
right direction, and so far we've
been pretty successful."
Goolsby himself is in his first
year as a starter, having won the
battle to replace the departed
Tyreo Harrison. Like many Irish
players, he has performed ex
tremely well, dispelling doubts
that a team gutted by offseason
roster cuts by the strict Willing
ham would leave the Irish thin of
talent. Rather, Notre Dame,
which has always been one of the
country's most attractive re
cruiters, has proven to be deep —
and successful.
"It's great because this is my
first year actually starting," Gools
by said.
Playing alongside Watson cer
tainly hasn't hurt his play, either.
"The guy has such a good grasp
of the game plan," Goolsby ex

plained. "If I don't know some
thing, he knows it."
Goolsby expects a challenge
from Stanford.
"We're going to get everybody's
best game," he said. "They're
going to sling the ball around the
field, but Stanford can run the ball
too . . . you've got to be prepared
fora balanced attack."
Willingham talked prior to the
year about winning a national
championship, yet he focuses on
taking it one game at a time;
Goolsby doesn't see a paradox
therein, however.
"In order to win the national
championship, you have to take it
one game at a time," he explained.
"That's why you come to a place
like this, to get back on top, to be a
part of the Notre Dame lore."
As for all the talk about Willing
ham facing his old team?
"All I can say is, coach Will
ingham is here now, and we're
very grateful he is," Goolsby
said. "We're not really focusing
on that."

Tyreo Harrison. Like many Irish
players, he has performed ex
tremely well, dispelling doubts
that a team gutted by offseason
roster cuts by the strict Willing
ham would leave the Irish thin of
talent. Rather, Notre Dame,
which has always been one of the
country's most attractive re
cruiters, has proven to be deep —
and successful.
"It's great because this is my
first year actually starting," Gools
by said.
Playing alongside Watson cer
tainly hasn't hurt his play, either.
"The guy has such a good grasp
of the game plan," Goolsby ex

plained. "If I don't know some
thing, he knows it."
Goolsby expects a challenge
from Stanford.
"We're going to get everybody's
best game," he said. "They're
going to sling the ball around the
field, but Stanford can run the ball
too . . . you've got to be prepared
fora balanced attack."
Willingham talked prior to the
year about winning a national
championship, yet he focuses on
taking it one game at a time;
Goolsby doesn't see a paradox
therein, however.
"In order to win the national
championship, you have to take it
one game at a time," he explained.
"That's why you come to a place
like this, to get back on top, to be a
part of the Notre Dame lore."
As for all the talk about Willing
ham facing his old team?
"All I can say is, coach Will
ingham is here now, and we're
very grateful he is," Goolsby
said. "We're not really focusing
on that."

Notre Dame junior inside linebacker Mike Goolsby will look to take a bite
out of the Stanford rushing game this Saturday. He leads the Irish with 30
tackles, including six fora loss.
If you score 17 points and limit
the opposing team's offense to a
lone field goal, it means you've
won the game, right?
Well, yes — against most teams.
But, as Purdue (3-2) found out
on Sept. 7 in South Bend, Ind., if
you want to stop No. 9 Notre Dame
(4-0), you've got to keep its defense
out of the end zone, too. The Boil
ermakers fell, 24-17, as Notre Dame
returned two fumbles for touch
downs and ran back an interception
for the winning touchdown.
Stanford's (1-2, 0-1 Pacific-10
Conference) strength is its offense;
Notre Dame's is defense. On Sat
urday, junior Notre Dame line
backer Mike Goolsby foresees an
other opportunistic performance
by the Irish defense.
"Part of doing what we do is cre
ating turnovers, and not just creat
ing them but scoring on them as
well," Goolsby said.
Goolsby, along with senior
standout Courtney Watson, an
chors the middle of a Notre Dame
defense that is holding opponents
to a meager 2.6 yards per rush,
and an equally stingy 5.8 yards per
pass attempt.
Goolsby leads the team with
30 tackles and six tackles-for-a
loss, statistically overshadowing
even Watson.
Despite its stellar performance
thus far, Goolsby feels the defense
is just getting started.
" There's so much stuff we can
fix," he said. "Just little things,
like turning a tackle fora loss into
a fumble."
It's been an eventful year for
Goolsby and the rest of the Irish,
who saw their hopes of going to a
bowl game eliminated when Stan
ford defeated them, 17-14, guar
anteeing Notre Dame a losing sea
son. The Irish finished at 5-6 and
Stanford at 9-3.
Now, head coach Tyrone Will
ingham is on the other side of the
field, but he once again enters the
game with the favored team.
Goolsby, not surprisingly, is
very happy to have Willingham in
Irish colors.
"From the get-go, we accepted
him with open arms, due to the
fact that we had been through so
much," Goolsby said, referring
to the firing of Bob Davie and the
hiring and subsequent dismissal
of George O'Leary due to re
sume inaccuracies.

Willingham, so far, seems to have
unlocked Notre Dame's potential.
"We always knew the talent was
there, and the desire was there,"
Goolsby said. "We finally got
somebody that pointed us in the
right direction, and so far we've
been pretty successful."
Goolsby himself is in his first
year as a starter, having won the
battle to replace the departed
Tyreo Harrison. Like many Irish
players, he has performed ex
tremely well, dispelling doubts
that a team gutted by offseason
roster cuts by the strict Willing
ham would leave the Irish thin of
talent. Rather, Notre Dame,
