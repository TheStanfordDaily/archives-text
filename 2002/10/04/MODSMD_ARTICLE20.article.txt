# PICK A CARD, ANY CARD
## It's a must-win game for Stanford this weekend 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN STAFF WRITER 
It's the season for the Stanford
Cardinal.
Yes, I know that every game
counts equally, but there is a huge
difference between 2-2 and 1-3.
As it stands, the Cardinal has to
win five more games in order to
qualify fora bowl. With national
title contenders Oregon and
Washington State on the sched
ule, every game left is the season
for Stanford.
Not to mention the fact that
the game is against Notre Dame,
one of our primary rivals. The
same Notre Dame that is 4-0. And
there would be nothing better
than to give the Fighting Irish
their first loss.
But it won't be easy. Notre
Dame isn't undefeated by accident.
So here are five pieces of advice on
watching the game on Saturday for
the intelligent football lan:
1. Get comfortable. Notre
Dame plays grind-it-out football.
The Irish hold on to possession
and then crush you on defense as
soon as you get the ball. In partic
ular, they play meticulous special
teams. If Stanford is going to pull
off an upset, it is going to have to
make few, if any, mistakes. Conse
quently, this game could move at a
very slow pace. And then just when
you go to the bathroom, someone
will recover a fumble that will de
termine the game.
2. Watch for Stanford redshirt
freshman Michael Craven.

Craven was one of the top re
cruits in last year's class, and this
year, he has begun to show his
skill at outside linebacker. With
the loss of Coy Wire to the NFL
Draft, the linebacker unit was the
biggest question over the sum
mer. Now Craven, along with ju
nior Jake Covault and sopho
more David Bergeron, has re
vived the squad.
Against Notre Dame, the line
backers will have to play well to
stop Willingham's West Coast of
fense. If the Cardinal hopes to hin
der the Irish attack, Craven will
have to play his best game of the
season.
3. Be skeptical of the sports
casters. Undoubtedly the people
covering the game will bring up
countless times how Willingham
knows the ins and outs of the Car
dinal players. But don't overesti
mate the importance of the fact
that Willingham coached Stanford
last season.
Notre Dame and Stanford
played each other last year, so the
players know each other. But the
teams' systems are drastically dif
ferent than they were last season,
as both Stanford head coach
Buddy Teevens and Willingham
have installed new plans at their
respective schools. In addition, the
Cardinal is full of new talent with a
revamped defense. This is not the
same team Willingham coached
last year.
4. Watch the freshmen. Will
the young guys be able to respond
from last week's crushing from
Arizona State? The only way to
tell is to watch how they play. Red
shirt freshmen J.R. Lemon and
Kyle Matter both had rough days
in Tempe, Ariz., last week.

The degree of Cardinal resolve
will be evident on Saturday in
South Bend. Rather than fold,
will the team be able to bounce
back with an upset win?
Last season, the squad showed
its resolution by defeating Oregon
in Autzen Stadium following a loss
at home to Washington State. This
Stanford team will have to re
spond to keep its dwindling bowl
hopes alive.
Also keep an eye on true fresh
man T.J. Rushing. Rushing, a
quick cornerback, received limit
ed minutes in the first three
games; however, his speed could
be a necessity against the Irish. If
he can play his game, he will be
an important asset of the Cardi
nal defense.
5. Pay attention to Kerry Carter
and Luke Powell. If Powell and
Carter are able to play, they will
have a big impact on the Cardinal
game plan. Both players were
sidelined for the Arizona State
game and are uncertain for the
game on Saturday.
Carter brings a hard-hitting
presence to the backfield, helping
spread the load carried by Lemon
and senior fullback Casey Moore.
A strong running game will great
ly help the Cardinal passing attack
as it forces the defense to play clos
er to the line.
In that same vein, Powell also
opens up the Cardinal attack by
being another deep threat in ad
dition to sophomore Teyo John
son. He spreads out the defense,
which could force Notre Dame to
guard Johnson with single cover
age. That would allow Johnson to
have the big game he needs to
have if the Cardinal wants to beat
Notre Dame.

Head coach Buddy Teevens will not name his starter before Saturday's game, leaving Notre Dame in the dark about
whether junior Chris Lewis or freshman Kyle Matter will lead the Card into battle.
