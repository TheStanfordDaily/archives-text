## Volleyball readies for USC showdown 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Neither Stanford coach John Dunning nor
Southern California coach Mick Haley will let the
words "must win" cross their lips in referring to
tonight's match between Dunning's No. 4 Cardi
nal and Haley's No. 1 Trojans.

Women's Volleyball
vs. No. 1 USC, Tonight, 7:00 p.m.
vs. No. 13 UCLA, Saturday, 7:00 p.m.

But undoubtedly there will be a sense of ur
gency amongst the players from both teams when
they take the floor at Maples Pavilion tonight at
7:00 p.m. for what is the most highly anticipated
match in college volleyball so far this year.
There are few who doubt that either Stanford
(12-1,3-0 Pacific-10 Conference) or USC (10-0,4-
0) will take the Pac-10 title this season. The Car
dinal edged the Trojans for the conference
crown by a game last year — thanks to a USC loss
at Arizona—after the two split their season series,
widi each team winning at home.
And the conference race figures to be as close
this season, especially with Stanford and USC
joining three other teams — No. 2 Hawaii, No. 3
Florida and No. 5 Nebraska — in the clear-cut
group of elite teams in the NCAA.
Only four of diose teams can host NCAA re
gional, which giants home court advantage to
those teams in the NCAA tournament up to the
Final Four in New Orleans. Florida already beat
the Cardinal on Sept. 14 in Gainsville, Fla. —
though Stanford was playing without three-time
Ail-American outside hitter Logan Tom — a
week after the Trojans had swept the Gators at
the BYU Invitational.
A loss at home to USC would be a second,
much bigger mark against the Cardinal when the
NCAA selection committee sits down to draw up

brackets at the end of next month. A Pat-10 title
will likely be needed to guarantee one of those re
gional host spots.
Still, Dunning stresses that there is no extra
pressure being put on the team from die coach
ing staff heading into tonight.
"You can trust us, we're going to work hard in
practice because of who's coming to town, but we
want to show that effort every week," Dunning
said. "We're trying to see how we match up widi
one of the best teams in the country right now.
We get another shot at them later [on Nov. 2], but
it may be harder on their court. It's nice to have
them at home right now."
Haley doesn't see tonight's match as being too
out of the ordinary for his Trojan squad either.
In addition to its sweep over Florida, USC also
beat the Cornhuskers in three on Sept. 2, and the
Trojans easily handled No. 17 Arizona in Tucson
two weeks ago.
"This week hasn't been too different for us
than any other week," said Haley, who coached
Tom on the U.S. national team two years ago.
"We've had a pretty good schedule so far. We've
already seen two other top-five teams, so we're
used to this kind of match.
"It's important to win on the road to take die
Pac-10, this year especially, with the way some
teams have been playing at home. Arizona State
[which upset No. 17 Arizona at home last week]
will tell you that."
Stanford and USC match up well against each
odier in every category. The Trojans lead the
Pac-10 in kills, while the Cardinal tops the con
ference in hitting percentage. The teams are also
one-two in the Pac-10 in blocking and opponents'
hitting percentage.
The Trojans are continuing to use the 6-2 of
fense they implemented last year, and the system
is working just as well as it did last season. All six
of the hitters in their standard rotation are aver
aging over two kills per game, with outside hitters

April Ross and Keao Burdine leading the way
with each averaging over 3.5 kills per game.
"We knew this week of practice was really key,
and we all wanted to go all out," said Stanford
freshman setter Katie Goldhahn, who saw her
first Pac-10 action in Stanford's crushings of Ore
gon and Oregon State last weekend. "We've been
trying to replicate USC's offense in practice so we
can be ready for them."
Stanford counters with a pair of Ail-Ameri
can outside hitters who are each averaging
over four kills per game in Tom and sopho
more Ogonna Nnamani. Junior middle block
er Sara McGee, who leads the Pac-10 in block
ing for the second straight year, is also chip
ping in 3.21 kills per game.
But serving could be the key to the match, as it
was in both contests between the teams last year.
Stanford's four jump servers, led by senior out
side hitter Ashley Ivy, who has a Pac-10 best 36
aces on the year, will go toe-to-toe with three
jump-serving Trojans. The match should hinge
on which team has more of its jump servers hit
ting their marks.
Regardless of what happens on Friday, the
Cardinal will have to keep its energy up one more
night for No. 13 UCLA (9-5,2-2), which comes to
Maples on Saturday.
The Bruins are a shell of the team they were
last year following the graduation of outside hit
ters Ashley Bowles and Kristee Porter and the
program's best-ever setter, Erika Selsor. The
Bruins' offense is still looking for suitable replace
ments for those three, ranking next, to last in the
Pac-10 with a .221 team hitting percentage.
UCLA is already two games out of the lead in
the conference standings, having been swept at
the Arizona schools two weeks ago.
"We're definitely going to have tobatde Friday
and Saturday night," McGee said. "I'm sure
[USC and UCLA] are both pumped to play us, so
it should be a pretty intense set of matches."
