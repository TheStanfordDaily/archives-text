team was controlling the match.
The soccer gods certainly
looked favorably upon the sec
ond-ranked Cardinal (9-1) last
night, as Stanford was able to use a
questionable offside non-call to
squeak by San Jose State 2-1 in
double overtime.
In a tiring match that lasted 103
minutes, the Cardinal sent its fans
home happy when junior mid
fielder Mike Wilson was able to
poke the ball over the Spartans'
defense to a wide-open Darren
Fernandez on the left side.
He may have been too wide
open.
Fortunately for the Cardinal,
the linesman kept his flag down,
and Fernandez calmly trapped
the ball and sent a shot past San
Jose State keeper Eddie
Dominguez for the golden goal.

"I'm pretty sure I wasn't [off
side]," Fernandez said. "I saw a
[San Jose State] guy standing
there. I just waited for the ball,
and when I realized that the de
fense thought 1 was offside, I
slowed it down and just banged it
in there."
Very few expected that the Car
dinal would find itself in a double
overtime situation with the Spar
tans (4-6). However, San Jose
State was able to use its quickness
to throw a wrench into the Cardi
nal's controlling style of play.
Fora majority of the first half,
neither team was able to establish
significant possession of the ball,
but both teams had a few chances
on goal.
The Cardinal was able to take
the lead with nine minutes left in
the half when midfielder Johanes
Maliza took a brilliantly played
header from forward Roger
Levesque and shot it into the net.
In pure Cardinal style, defend
er Todd Dunivant started the
goal-scoring opportunity with a
cross from the left side.
As the half ended, Stanford
began to establish possession
through several crowd-pleasing
one-touch sequences that created
a few scoring chances.
The second half began with
sloppy play from both sides of the
ball. Neither team was able to es
tablish anything, and the ball went
back and forth fora while.
This was until the Spartans

were able to capitalize on one of
their few offensive chances.
The Spartans worked the ball
up to their right forward who had
possession of the ball until Cardi
nal defender Chad Marshall com
mitted a foul in the penalty box.
San Jose State capitalized on its
game-tying chance, as midfielder
Tony Chang shot the penalty kick
into the back of the net.
With the Spartans smelling
upset with 15 minutes left in the
game, the momentum starting
going their way, but the Cardinal
defense played well enough to

send the match into overtime.
In the first 10-minute overtime
period, Levesque had a wonderful
chance to end the match early, but
Dominguez made a great save
coming off his goalline.
Entering the second overtime,
the Cardinal was in danger of end
ing in a tie with an unranked
squad, but Fernandez had other
ideas.
"[San Jose State] had shorter,
very quick and tricky guys," Fer
nandez said. "I give them a lot of

credit, because they worked really
hard. They made it tough because
they had some good touches. But
we were able to come together at
the end."
"It's terribly disappointing to
have it end like that," San Jose
State head coach Gary St. Clair
said. "We work awfull hard. We
work too hard for that."
The team will now have a week
to prepare for its first Pacific-10
Conference match next Friday
against Washington (3-3-2) at
Harry Maloney Field.
