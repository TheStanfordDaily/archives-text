# Women set to battle for top spot in poll
## 
### MATT BABIN STAFF WRITER 
You might think that after
moving into the top spot in the na
tional rankings last week, the
Stanford women's soccer team (8-
0-0) would have cracked a few
smiles, let loose a little and shown
some excitement.

Women's Soccer
vs. No. 2 UNC (at Saint Mary's),
Today, 2:00 p.m.
vs. Tulane (at Saint Mary's), Sunday,
noon

But at practice, as they pre
pared for No. 2 North Carolina
(8-0-2), you could tell that they
were still all business.
And as for the ranking?
"Doesn't matter," said co-coach
Paul Sapsford. "Rankings don't
mean anything. The only ranking
that means anything is the last one
of the season."
So the Cardinal travels this
weekend to Moraga, Calif., to face
the Ear Heels and Tulane (3-6-1)
in the Saint Mary's Tournament
with a simple goal in mind: win
ning two more games to augment
its perfect 8-0 record.
The squad, up to this point, has
done tremendous work in keeping
its focus on the game at hand, and
that discipline has paid off. The

Cardinal has posted eight wins, in
cluding six shutouts, by outscoring
opponents 26-2 thus far.
While there was some danger
that the team might look past
Montana and Tennessee last
week in anticipation of today's
game, it kept its focus and posted
two convincing wins. In fact, the
team's 8-1 victory over Montana
enabled it to take home the tour
nament championship trophy on
goal differential.
So thoughts of taking on UNC?
"That focus has just started for
this week," said co-coach
Stephanie Erickson.
And no change in this week's
preparation, even with the magni
tude of the game?
"Really, [the team is] the same
week in and week out," Erickson
said. "They're very focused for
whomever we're playing on the
weekend. It's more of their
process for the season than just
this one game. But UNC is excit
ing. It will be an exciting game."
There is a certain aura and ex
citement about the Tar Heels.
That's what a tradition of 17 na
tional championships since 1981
will get you. But the Cardinal goes
into the game today, the program's
seventh match against the Tar
Heels, confident.
