## Negotiating the Notre Dame dichotomy: to love or to hate 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
1 here's a thin line between love and hate, right?
Well, usually. But not when it comes to Notre Dame.
With Notre Dame, there is no line. You either
bear an angry grudge toward Notre Dame, or re
vere its tradition and uniqueness with reverence.
The only other choice is to not follow college foot
ball at all.
I grew up a couple of hours from South Bend,
Ind., in the Chicago area, so I have already read or

heard the words "Notre Dame"
thousands and thousands of times.
But in coming to California for col
lege, I discovered that all college
football fans have their own firm
stance on Notre Dame.
I myself must temporarily aban
don the mindset of the objective
journalist and admit that I have
long disliked Notre Dame and

tremendously enjoyed its failure to make a bowl
game last year.
So why do so many people such as myself go out
of their way to root against Notre Dame? Well, to
be honest, it is because Notre Dame is the best. It
has the best all-time winning percentage of any
college program. Early college football history,
more often than not, is just another chapter in the
Notre Dame legacy.
And, growing up in the Chicago area, myself and
most of my friends got tired of it. There are far too
many Golden Domers in the Windy City, and they
enjoy their football success far too much. Fortu
nately, they also suffer the occasional train wreck,
such as the 2001 season, with similar intensity.
It is important at this point to realize that this rea
soning does not make sense. It is not logical to hate
the Fighting Irish just because they are forever win
ning, and doing it in a generally classy, if rather
smug manner. But when you are force-fed the Irish
year after year, it wears on you.
Then there are the bandwagon fans, the special
treatment and the media circus; the ridiculous NBC
television contract guaranteeing that a national au
dience will see Carlyle Holiday fail to put the football
in the same area code as his receivers every single

week of the season; the Notre Dame administration's
decision not to join the Big Ten so as to avoid shar
ing its BCS money, its TV revenue and all the other
things that give it a leg up on other teams.
Then there is the fact that Notre Dame has the
best recruiting draw in the nation, yet still hasn't had
an Ail-American quarterback since the early-'9os
days of (Bears fans shudder with me now) Rick
Mirer, forcing those aforementioned TV audiences
to watch Jarious Jackson run the ever-exciting op
tion and somehow manage to fail at it.
Notre Dame is a fine school, and it runs a good
football program that for many, many years was the
nation's best. But it has reached the point where the
actual Notre Dame football team can never really
live up to its own legendary history, a legacy of
perennial champions and quasi-mythical figures like
the Four Horsemen.
That, of course, won't mean anything this Satur
day in South Bend. Because, for now, the Irish are
undefeated, Willingham is still a hero and not yet a
villain, and the Irish fans are actually satisfied.
But, as always, Notre Dame has set itself up fora fall.
It's hard to believe that a team coming off a 5-6 season,
with an offseason full of turmoil, could be in a position
to disappoint four games into the year, but we must re
member that Notre Dame is always a special case.
Sometimes I imagine that the national media's
undue focus on Notre Dame is somehow a sinister
plot to overemphasize every twist and turn so that
they can write epic "What's wrong with Notre
Dame?" stories days after heralding the return of
college football's royalty to its rightful throne.
As for myself, I have found myself torn this week.
I don't like Notre Dame; I've never liked it. But the
Irish have a very effective coach, hard-working, well
mannered players and an admirable resolve that has
enabled them to overachieve beyond even an Irish
fan's wildest dreams.
In the end, the things that everyone hates about
Notre Dame are not the fault of the players wearing
that litmus test of a uniform down on the field.
The team itself is guilty, more than anything else,
of just winning too much.

Irish owe the city of Chicago an apology for Rick Mirer's
NFL career, email him at mdthoriui@stanford.edu.

more often than not, is just another chapter in the
Notre Dame legacy.
And, growing up in the Chicago area, myself and
most of my friends got tired of it. There are far too
many Golden Domers in the Windy City, and they
enjoy their football success far too much. Fortu
nately, they also suffer the occasional train wreck,
such as the 2001 season, with similar intensity.
It is important at this point to realize that this rea
soning does not make sense. It is not logical to hate
the Fighting Irish just because they are forever win
ning, and doing it in a generally classy, if rather
smug manner. But when you are force-fed the Irish
year after year, it wears on you.
Then there are the bandwagon fans, the special
treatment and the media circus; the ridiculous NBC
television contract guaranteeing that a national au
dience will see Carlyle Holiday fail to put the football
in the same area code as his receivers every single

week of the season; the Notre Dame administration's
decision not to join the Big Ten so as to avoid shar
ing its BCS money, its TV revenue and all the other
things that give it a leg up on other teams.
Then there is the fact that Notre Dame has the
best recruiting draw in the nation, yet still hasn't had
an Ail-American quarterback since the early-'9os
days of (Bears fans shudder with me now) Rick
Mirer, forcing those aforementioned TV audiences
to watch Jarious Jackson run the ever-exciting op
tion and somehow manage to fail at it.
Notre Dame is a fine school, and it runs a good
football program that for many, many years was the
nation's best. But it has reached the point where the
actual Notre Dame football team can never really
live up to its own legendary history, a legacy of
perennial champions and quasi-mythical figures like
the Four Horsemen.
That, of course, won't mean anything this Satur
day in South Bend. Because, for now, the Irish are
undefeated, Willingham is still a hero and not yet a
villain, and the Irish fans are actually satisfied.
But, as always, Notre Dame has set itself up fora fall.
It's hard to believe that a team coming off a 5-6 season,
with an offseason full of turmoil, could be in a position
to disappoint four games into the year, but we must re
member that Notre Dame is always a special case.
Sometimes I imagine that the national media's
undue focus on Notre Dame is somehow a sinister
plot to overemphasize every twist and turn so that
they can write epic "What's wrong with Notre
Dame?" stories days after heralding the return of
college football's royalty to its rightful throne.
As for myself, I have found myself torn this week.
I don't like Notre Dame; I've never liked it. But the
Irish have a very effective coach, hard-working, well
mannered players and an admirable resolve that has
enabled them to overachieve beyond even an Irish
fan's wildest dreams.
In the end, the things that everyone hates about
Notre Dame are not the fault of the players wearing
that litmus test of a uniform down on the field.
The team itself is guilty, more than anything else,
of just winning too much.
