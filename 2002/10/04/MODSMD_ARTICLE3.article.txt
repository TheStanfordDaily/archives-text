# Labor controversy still brewing
## 
### ERIC ELDON 
After Bon Appetit management agreed on
a fresh contract with its workers' union last
May, it appeared that the past year's labor con
troversies — which had boiled over into
marches, call-ins and a weeklong student cam
pout on the Main Quad — would finally sim
mer down.
But as the Palo Alto-based food-service
company continues to lose money at Stanford,
workers and student activist groups claim that
cost-cutting measures such as layoffs, hour re
ductions and timed bathroom breaks are re
versing the progress made last spring.
"Like many restaurants across the country,

Bon Appetit has experienced a decline in busi
ness during the current economic slowdown,"
wrote Marvin Rodriguez, the general manag
er of Bon Appetit on campus, in a letter to em
ployees earlier this summer. "In order to
maintain high levels of service at all meal peri
ods, Bon Appetit will restructure hours of op
erations at several campus cafes."
"We understand that there need to be some
layoffs," Roxana Rivera, work-site manager for
union SEIU Local 715, told The Daily this
summer. "Bon Appetit says they have a sales
drop of 40 percent. We think [the proposed
cuts] are too expensive."
Union representative Danielle Mahones
noted that Bon Appetit made the same com

plaint during the May contract negotiations,
when it agreed to raise its workers' wages to
equal those of Stanford employees and to in
clude partial subsidization of health and dental
benefits.
Prior to last May's new contract agreement,
Bon Appetit workers' minimum starting wages
were $8.50 per hour, compared with a mini
mum hourly starting wage ofs 10.35, plus ben
efits, paid to Stanford workers employed by
Residential and Dining Enterprises.
I his summer, Bon Appetit began imple
menting the wage increases. But according to
Mahones, the benefits agreed upon in the con-

tract have yet to materialize, and
"printing problems" have kept
employees from receiving back
pay and benefit price-reductions
guaranteed in the contract.
"I've been part of hundreds of
negotiations, and I've never seen
anything like this," Mahones said.
Key grievances that the union
has brought up with Bon Appetit
include: some workers being fired
and replaced weeks later by non
union employees ineligible for the
new union contract; work hours
being reduced to slightly below the
hourly requirements necessary to
qualify for the increased pay and
benefits package in the new con
tract; and invasive new workplace
practices, such as the rigorous tim
ing of bathroom breaks.
"Bon Appetit has had difficulty
in following through on some
parts of the new contract, and at
the same time has adopted policies
that undermine some of the gains
we made in May," Mahones said.
During the summer, workers
and student activists on campus
responded by staging rallies at
Tresidder Union outside of Bon

Appetit's campus headquarters
and in front of University Presi
dent John Hennessy's office.
Some protestors have speculated
that Bon Appetit made its most
aggressive changes during the
summer in an attempt to avoid
controversy.
Bon Appetit management and
union officials are currently re
viewing the grievances filed.
Vice Provost of Student Affairs
Gene Awakuni maintained that
the University has no control over
the decisions made by the Bon Ap
petit management.
"Bon Appetit is a tenant in
Tresidder," Awakuni told The
Daily in August. "They pay us rent
and are thereby allowed to operate
their food-service business.
"We don't get involved in any
management decisions they may
make, just as we would not get in
volved in the management deci
sions made by other tenants of
Stanford-owned property."
The University administration
has, however, developed a tenta
tive labor policy entitled "Pro
posed Living Wage and Benefit
Guidelines For Stanford Contrac
tors," which is expected to be pre
sented to the Faculty Senate next
Thursday.
According to Deborah

Zumwalt, the University's gener
al counsel, "The administration
has spent a good deal of time con
sidering the issues that workers
and students have been con
cerned about, and we believe that
this policy reflects the most ap
propriate balance of the various
interests involved."
The new guidelines include an
initial living wage of "$lO.lO per
hour if health benefits are provid
ed, and a minimum offl 1.35 if no
health benefits are provided."
These rules will only apply to
non-unionized, subcontracted
workers.
"We are not going to interfere
with workers who prefer to use col

lective bargaining methods in ne
gotiating their wages and bene
fits," Zumwalt said.
Student groups involved with
labor issues on campus, such as the
Stanford Labor Action Coalition,
argue that this policy will exclude
many of the lowest paid workers
on campus, and also undercut em
ployees who are currently paid
higher than the living wage.
"We want more than an arbi
trary living wage, we want a con
duct of conduct developed in a dia
logue including workers, students,
and the administration," said coali
tion member Angad Bhalla.
Bon Appetit management was
not available for comment.
