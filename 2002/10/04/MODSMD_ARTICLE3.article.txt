# Labor controversy still brewing

### ERIC ELDON 
After Bon Appetit management agreed on
a fresh contract with its workers' union last
May, it appeared that the past year's labor con
troversies — which had boiled over into
marches, call-ins and a weeklong student cam
pout on the Main Quad — would finally sim
mer down.
But as the Palo Alto-based food-service
company continues to lose money at Stanford,
workers and student activist groups claim that
cost-cutting measures such as layoffs, hour re
ductions and timed bathroom breaks are re
versing the progress made last spring.
"Like many restaurants across the country,

Bon Appetit has experienced a decline in busi
ness during the current economic slowdown,"
wrote Marvin Rodriguez, the general manag
er of Bon Appetit on campus, in a letter to em
ployees earlier this summer. "In order to
maintain high levels of service at all meal peri
ods, Bon Appetit will restructure hours of op
erations at several campus cafes."
"We understand that there need to be some
layoffs," Roxana Rivera, work-site manager for
union SEIU Local 715, told The Daily this
summer. "Bon Appetit says they have a sales
drop of 40 percent. We think [the proposed
cuts] are too expensive."
Union representative Danielle Mahones
noted that Bon Appetit made the same com

plaint during the May contract negotiations,
when it agreed to raise its workers' wages to
equal those of Stanford employees and to in
clude partial subsidization of health and dental
benefits.
Prior to last May's new contract agreement,
Bon Appetit workers' minimum starting wages
were $8.50 per hour, compared with a mini
mum hourly starting wage ofs 10.35, plus ben
efits, paid to Stanford workers employed by
Residential and Dining Enterprises.
I his summer, Bon Appetit began imple
menting the wage increases. But according to
Mahones, the benefits agreed upon in the con-
