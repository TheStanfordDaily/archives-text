# Men's cross country follows the example of a Sage leader
## Junior's determination helps lead men's team 
### EMIL MARTINSEK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Running in the heat and hu
midity of Baton Rouge, La., last
spring, he came from middle of
the pack and sprinted into the lead
with 200 meters to go in the 1,500-
meter race.

Men's Cross Country
at Notre Dame Invitational, Today,
2:15 p.m.

You had to see the surge to ap
preciate his sheer determination
and ability. It looked effortless,
strong and confident. Stanford
runner Don Sage had just won his
first NCAA individual title in the
1,500 meters at the NCAA Outdoor
Track and Field Championships.
"I really love the competitive as
pect of running," the junior said.
"I can really focus when it comes
down to big meets. When you get
into the race, you stop thinking
about how much it hurts and focus
on the competition."
When Sage arrived on the Farm,
he was already one of the most ac
complished prep runners ever. At
the time, his best mile was the fourth
fastest ever by a prep runner. He also
claimed a runner-up finish at the
Foodocker National High School
Cross Country Championships.
During his freshman campaign
at Stanford, Sage claimed two All-
America honors. The first was as
part of die NCAA-champion indoor
distance medley team, the second as
the fifth-place finisher in the 1500
during the outdoor track season.
Last year, he led the cross coun
try team to a runner-up finish at
the NCAA Championships with

his individual seventh-place finish.
He then claimed two more All-
America honors in indoor track
before winning his first individual
NCAA title in the 1500.
"Don is a tremendous athlete
and a pleasure to coach," said as
sistant coach Mike Reilly. "He is
very talented and a tremendously
hard worker. He is an effective
leader whose impact on our pro
gram is far reaching."
Together with his coaches, Sage
is working towards his long term
running goals, which include
World Championships and the
Olympics.
"Stanford's program is set up
like a foreign program where the
athletes are continually being de
veloped, not just focusing season
to season," Sage said.
Consequently, Sage uses the
season to build a solid training base
and gain racing experience. But
his focus remains on the end of the
year and championships during
the summer.
"I hope to run in the USA
Track and Field Championships
this year," Sage said. "After I grad
uate, I would like to keep run
ning, travel around and compete
in Europe."
Every year, Europe hosts some
of the most prestigious invitation
als and racing circuits in the world.
Participation and victories in these
competitions are both illustrious
and often lucrative.
"Don has very few limits in front
of him," Reilly said. "He can defi
nitely be a fantastic runner."
In the meantime, Sage enjoys
the process of training and striving
for his goals, both in running and
in life in general. Despite his suc
cess on the track, he remains hum
ble and levelheaded.
Sage is an Economics major tak
ing full advantage of the resources

Stanford offers. He was named a
third-team Verizon Academic Ail-
American for cross country / track
and field.
"You know you can't run your
entire life," Sage said. "Stanford is
unique because it is a good pro
gram athletically and academical
ly. You have options after you stop
running."
In the short term, however,
Stanford enters the 8,000-meter
competition at the Notre Dame In
vitational today as the No. 1
ranked team in the nation. The
race will mark the debut of Sage
and returning All-American, ju
nior Louis Luchini.
"I don't really know where I
am right now because I haven't
raced," Sage said, "but I don't
think I can completely count my
self out as a contender for the
NCAA title. I'd like to improve
on my seventh-place finish, but
that means beating some really
good guys in front of me. It's
challenging."
Boaz Cheboiywo of Eastern
Michigan returns as the defending
NCAA champ. Also expected to
challenge for the national title are
Colorado's Jorge Torres and
Arkansas's Alistair Cragg, last
year's second- and third-place fin
ishers, respectively.
"I feel I am in a lot better
shape going in," Sage said. "I've
been doing more mileage more
intensely. The whole team is in
better shape."
The Cardinal will be challenged
this weekend by No. 25 Michigan
and No. 30 Washington. Also pre
sent will be the top two teams in Di
vision 111, Wisconsin-Oshkosh and
North Central College.
"We always expect to put to
gether a lineup that will contend to
win the race," Reilly said. "We are
confident that all of the athletes
are excited to contribute."
Sage, Luchini and Stanford
sophomore Ryan Hall are among
the favorites for the individual

title. Challenging them today are
Notre Dame junior Todd Mobley
and Southern Methodist sopho
more Dalibor Balgac. Balgac was
sixth in last year's NCAA outdoor
5,000-meter championship.
Sage and his teammates toe the
starting line of the Blue Division
race at 2:15 p.m. to defend their
No. 1 ranking and continue the
Cardinal's successful season.

unique because it is a good pro
gram athletically and academical
ly. You have options after you stop
running."
In the short term, however,
Stanford enters the 8,000-meter
competition at the Notre Dame In
vitational today as the No. 1
ranked team in the nation. The
race will mark the debut of Sage
and returning All-American, ju
nior Louis Luchini.
"I don't really know where I
am right now because I haven't
raced," Sage said, "but I don't
think I can completely count my
self out as a contender for the
NCAA title. I'd like to improve
on my seventh-place finish, but
that means beating some really
good guys in front of me. It's
challenging."
Boaz Cheboiywo of Eastern
Michigan returns as the defending
NCAA champ. Also expected to
challenge for the national title are
Colorado's Jorge Torres and
Arkansas's Alistair Cragg, last
year's second- and third-place fin
ishers, respectively.
"I feel I am in a lot better
shape going in," Sage said. "I've
been doing more mileage more
intensely. The whole team is in
better shape."
The Cardinal will be challenged
this weekend by No. 25 Michigan
and No. 30 Washington. Also pre
sent will be the top two teams in Di
vision 111, Wisconsin-Oshkosh and
North Central College.
"We always expect to put to
gether a lineup that will contend to
win the race," Reilly said. "We are
confident that all of the athletes
are excited to contribute."
Sage, Luchini and Stanford
sophomore Ryan Hall are among
the favorites for the individual

title. Challenging them today are
Notre Dame junior Todd Mobley
and Southern Methodist sopho
more Dalibor Balgac. Balgac was
sixth in last year's NCAA outdoor
5,000-meter championship.
Sage and his teammates toe the
starting line of the Blue Division
race at 2:15 p.m. to defend their
No. 1 ranking and continue the
Cardinal's successful season.

Don Sage, pictured here at last year's Big Meet, is one of the favorites for the
cross country individual national title.
Running in the heat and hu
midity of Baton Rouge, La., last
spring, he came from middle of
the pack and sprinted into the lead
with 200 meters to go in the 1,500-
meter race.

Men's Cross Country
at Notre Dame Invitational, Today,
2:15 p.m.

You had to see the surge to ap
preciate his sheer determination
and ability. It looked effortless,
strong and confident. Stanford
runner Don Sage had just won his
first NCAA individual title in the
1,500 meters at the NCAA Outdoor
Track and Field Championships.
"I really love the competitive as
pect of running," the junior said.
"I can really focus when it comes
down to big meets. When you get
into the race, you stop thinking
about how much it hurts and focus
on the competition."
When Sage arrived on the Farm,
he was already one of the most ac
complished prep runners ever. At
the time, his best mile was the fourth
fastest ever by a prep runner. He also
claimed a runner-up finish at the
Foodocker National High School
Cross Country Championships.
During his freshman campaign
at Stanford, Sage claimed two All-
America honors. The first was as
part of die NCAA-champion indoor
distance medley team, the second as
the fifth-place finisher in the 1500
during the outdoor track season.
Last year, he led the cross coun
try team to a runner-up finish at
the NCAA Championships with

his individual seventh-place finish.
He then claimed two more All-
America honors in indoor track
before winning his first individual
NCAA title in the 1500.
"Don is a tremendous athlete
and a pleasure to coach," said as
sistant coach Mike Reilly. "He is
very talented and a tremendously
hard worker. He is an effective
leader whose impact on our pro
gram is far reaching."
Together with his coaches, Sage
is working towards his long term
running goals, which include
World Championships and the
Olympics.
"Stanford's program is set up
like a foreign program where the
athletes are continually being de
veloped, not just focusing season
to season," Sage said.
Consequently, Sage uses the
season to build a solid training base
and gain racing experience. But
his focus remains on the end of the
year and championships during
the summer.
"I hope to run in the USA
Track and Field Championships
this year," Sage said. "After I grad
uate, I would like to keep run
ning, travel around and compete
in Europe."
Every year, Europe hosts some
of the most prestigious invitation
als and racing circuits in the world.
Participation and victories in these
competitions are both illustrious
and often lucrative.
"Don has very few limits in front
of him," Reilly said. "He can defi
nitely be a fantastic runner."
In the meantime, Sage enjoys
the process of training and striving
for his goals, both in running and
in life in general. Despite his suc
cess on the track, he remains hum
ble and levelheaded.
Sage is an Economics major tak
ing full advantage of the resources

Stanford offers. He was named a
third-team Verizon Academic Ail-
American for cross country / track
and field.
"You know you can't run your
entire life," Sage said. "Stanford is
unique because it is a good pro
gram athletically and academical
ly. You have options after you stop
running."
