There's no rest for the weary
Stanford men's golf team this
week. The Cardinal returned to
the Farm for just a few days before
traveling south to Malibu for the
Pepperdine Intercollegiate.

The team is coming off a third
place finish at the Windon Memo
rial in Glenview, 111., its first event
of the 2002-2003 season. Three
Cardinal players finished in the
top 15, with top-10 performances
by senior Jim Seki and junior
Blake Mastalir.
Just as in Glenview, Stanford
will face another strong field this
week. Oklahoma and Pepperdine,
both ranked in the nation's top 25
in Golftvorld's preseason poll, will
be competing in the event.
In addition, Stanford will be
getting its first major taste of Pacif
ic- 10 Conference play, with Pac-10
rivals California and Oregon also
participating in Malibu.
If golf tournaments are won
with momentum, UCLA is defi
nitely a team to watch this week.
The Bruins are coming off a rout
at the Pacific Invitational, which
they won by 16 strokes on Tues
day. Their final round 273 and 54-
hole total of 830 (34 strokes under
par) were both team records.

In the individual competition,
New Mexico's Michael Letzig,
ranked fourth in the country by
Golfweek, will make a run at the
title. Oklahoma senior John Kid
well, who was named golfer of the
week by Golfworld after carding a
course-record 65 at the Sooner In
vitational earlier this year, will also
be there. Kidwell won the Sooner
Invitational, his first collegiate
title, with an 11-under-par 205.
From the Pac-10, UCLA junior
Steve Conway fired a final-round 66
to finish tied for seventh place at the
Pacific Invitational. Caljunior Peter
Tomasulo was six-under-par at the
Pacific, placing him 11th overall.
"We are anxious to serve as
the host school for the Club
Glove Intercollegiate," Pepper
dine coach John Geiberger said.
"The tournament field is excel
lent, ancl the players will be chal
lenged by the layout at the Sati

coy Country Club."
Action will begin at the par-72
track on Monday with 36 holes of
play. The final 18 holes will be
played on Tuesday.
The Cardinal, coming off a
solid performance at the Windon
Memorial, hopes to use the short
rest period to its advantage in Mal
ibu. Mastalir believes that the busy
schedule may allow the team to
capitalize on some of the momen
tum from its season opener.
"The [Windon Memorial) was
the first tournament fora while for
a lot of us, so it'll be nice to just get
right back out there," Mastalir
said. "For the guys who played
well, it's easy to get the confidence
going for the next tournament."
Given the strength of this
week's field, Mastalir says it will be
important for every member of the
team to contribute if they hope to
finish well.
