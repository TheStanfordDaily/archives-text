# Fleshman sets pace â€“ and example, too

### ERIK SPERLING STAFF WRITER 
When the Stanford football
team plays Notre Dame this week
end, it may have an unanticipated
cheering section in the crowd.
If senior Stanford women's
cross country runner Lauren
Fleshman has her way, the No. 2
Cardinal squad will be able to
watch the gridiron action in per
son, but only after spending the
previous day dominating the
Notre Dame Invitational.

Women's Cross Country
at Notre Dame Invitational, Today,
2:15 p.m.

Last weekend, Fleshman placed
second in the 4,000 meter race at
the Stanford Invitational. When
asked about the team's upcoming
trip to South Bend, Ind., the fol
lowing weekend, Fleshman's first
response was,"I can't wait to cheer
on our football team in the Notre
Dame stadium!"
The distance between that state
ment and the response expected
from a two-time NCAA 5,000
meter champion belies the intense
drive of this athlete.
"I want to not just race, but per
form," Fleshman said. "I want to
exude confidence and composure.
Regardless of the outcome of any
race, at the finish I want to be able
to say that I have progressed for
ward and learned something so I
can continue to improve from
week to week."
After a high school career that
included winning the California
state cross country championship
and placing second at the Foot
locker National Championships,
Fleshman quickly settled into col
legiate running. After finishing no
lower than fifth throughout her
first regular season on the Farm,
she ran to a fifth-place finish at the
NCAA Championships and led the
Cardinal to a third-place finish.
Considering that distance run

ners do triple duty over three dif
ferent seasons, and the Cardinal
runners have historically finished
very well at nationals, one could
state with a reasonable degree of
confidence that Stanford's domi
nance in the annual Sears Direc
tor's Cup is due largely to runners
like Fleshman.

In addition to garnering Ail-
American honors in every cross
country, indoor track and outdoor
track season since her arrival at
Stanford, she has been instrumen
tal in motivating her teammates to
higher performances.
"She's intense and competitive,
but totally in balance and smart

about everything she does," said
teammate sophomore Jeane GofF.
"Its inspiring to be around her.
How can you slack off when some
one so perky and energetic is
working so hard next to you?
"While running on the team
with her fora little over a year, I've
discovered a love of running and
our sport that wasn't necessarily as
strong before."
As with most Stanford stu
dents, Fleshman's strengths are
not one dimensional. In between
running and studying towards
her Human Biology degree, she
finds time for playing the guitar
and songwriting.
"She's an amazing singer and
musician," GofFsaid. "She's definite
ly going to be famous somebody, if
not for running, as a musician.
"At [training] camp in Mam
moth, Lauren is traditionally our
social coordinator. She knows the
best coffee shops and tourist attrac
tions, but also comes up with the
best adventures, like sunrise hikes.
A ton of the odd and interesting
things I've done in my life have
been Lauren's ideas."
The Notre Dame Invitational
will be the first time this season
Fleshman races with her sopho
more teammates Sara Bei and
Alicia Craig.
After an outstanding early sea
son, Bei and Craig have found
themselves becoming very com
fortable at the podium. The pair
has taken the first two spots at
both the Cal State Fullerton Invi
tational on Aug. 31 and at the
6,000-meter race at the Stanford
Invitational.
Although the teammates have
yet to race together, their training
should help them to form the
tight pack at the head of the field
that is so crucial in elite cross
country meets.
"We work out ever single day,
so we are developing a pretty awe
some three-way rhythm," Flesh
man said. "We take turns pushing
each other's limits."

lowing weekend, Fleshman's first
response was,"I can't wait to cheer
on our football team in the Notre
Dame stadium!"
The distance between that state
ment and the response expected
from a two-time NCAA 5,000
meter champion belies the intense
drive of this athlete.
"I want to not just race, but per
form," Fleshman said. "I want to
exude confidence and composure.
Regardless of the outcome of any
race, at the finish I want to be able
to say that I have progressed for
ward and learned something so I
can continue to improve from
week to week."
After a high school career that
included winning the California
state cross country championship
and placing second at the Foot
locker National Championships,
Fleshman quickly settled into col
legiate running. After finishing no
lower than fifth throughout her
first regular season on the Farm,
she ran to a fifth-place finish at the
NCAA Championships and led the
Cardinal to a third-place finish.
Considering that distance run

ners do triple duty over three dif
ferent seasons, and the Cardinal
runners have historically finished
very well at nationals, one could
state with a reasonable degree of
confidence that Stanford's domi
nance in the annual Sears Direc
tor's Cup is due largely to runners
like Fleshman.

In addition to garnering Ail-
American honors in every cross
country, indoor track and outdoor
track season since her arrival at
Stanford, she has been instrumen
tal in motivating her teammates to
higher performances.
"She's intense and competitive,
but totally in balance and smart

about everything she does," said
teammate sophomore Jeane GofF.
"Its inspiring to be around her.
How can you slack off when some
one so perky and energetic is
working so hard next to you?
"While running on the team
with her fora little over a year, I've
discovered a love of running and
our sport that wasn't necessarily as
strong before."
As with most Stanford stu
dents, Fleshman's strengths are
not one dimensional. In between
running and studying towards
her Human Biology degree, she
finds time for playing the guitar
and songwriting.
"She's an amazing singer and
musician," GofFsaid. "She's definite
ly going to be famous somebody, if
not for running, as a musician.
"At [training] camp in Mam
moth, Lauren is traditionally our
social coordinator. She knows the
best coffee shops and tourist attrac
tions, but also comes up with the
best adventures, like sunrise hikes.
A ton of the odd and interesting
things I've done in my life have
been Lauren's ideas."
The Notre Dame Invitational
will be the first time this season
Fleshman races with her sopho
more teammates Sara Bei and
Alicia Craig.
After an outstanding early sea
son, Bei and Craig have found
themselves becoming very com
fortable at the podium. The pair
has taken the first two spots at
both the Cal State Fullerton Invi
tational on Aug. 31 and at the
6,000-meter race at the Stanford
Invitational.
Although the teammates have
yet to race together, their training
should help them to form the
tight pack at the head of the field
that is so crucial in elite cross
country meets.
"We work out ever single day,
so we are developing a pretty awe
some three-way rhythm," Flesh
man said. "We take turns pushing
each other's limits."
