# New paper to serve black community

### NATALIE FARRELL 
After a seven-year hiatus, mem
bers of the black community are
reviving The Real News as a means
to bridge the still-existing divisions
between ethnic groups and to
bring greater exposure to cultural
issues on campus. The first issue of
the paper will publish Oct. 14 and
will be distributed all over campus.
Editor-in-Chief Khalilah Karim
said that the growing size of Stan
ford's black community was one of
the primary motivations for the
publication's revival.
"We're growing every year;
we're getting so big we need our
own publication to address our
own issues," she said.
Karim also said that she and
some of the other editors felt as
though other campus publications
were giving insufficient coverage
to cultural issues.
"In any large newspaper,
there's obviously going to be some
inarginalization; a community will
probably feel like they're not rep
resented," Karim said.
Senior and Ujamaa resident
Taara Hassan, who is not officially
affiliated with the paper but may
contribute as a writer, agreed that
current coverage of racial issues on
campus is "average."
Managing Editor Amy Keith
and ASSU Senator Keenan De-
Vaughn, one of the section edi
tors, both commented that The
Real News might help bridge
some of the divisions between

East and West campus. West cam
pus is generally regarded as the
"hub" for the black community
due to the placement of Ujamaa
and the Black Community Ser
vices Center.
"From the inside of the ASSU, I
have noticed a lot of misunder
standings about the black commu
nity as being exclusive, and a lot of
the time we misunderstand the
world around us," DeVaughn
said. "One of the goals of The Real
News is to strike a balance between
the inside and the outside."
Because it will come out only
twice a quarter, the publication
will not be a source of immediate
news but rather long-lasting issues
with current themes like the po
tential war in Iraq and black repa
rations, as well as opinion pieces,
features and information from
outside wire services. The editors
are looking for contributions from
all areas and ethnicities of the
Stanford community and will
cover political, national and local
news â€” including Stanford and
East Palo Alto.
"We're a minority-oriented
newspaper, but anyone who has
experience with writing is wel
come; we don't turn anyone
away," Karim said.
The history of The Real News
dates back to 1969, when black
students took over an administra
tion meeting with a list of de
mands, one of which was the cre
