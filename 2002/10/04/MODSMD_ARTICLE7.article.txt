# Revamped CDC settles into new digs
## 
### ADRIENNE CLARK 
After two moves in the past year and a
half, the Career Development Center is
revitalizing its image as it settles into a
new home at 563 Salvatierra Walk.
Center Director Lance Choy ex
plained that the new location, across from
the Haas Center of Public Service and
close to the center of campus, will better
serve students. Armed with a new tag
line, "Do great things," the CDC is using
the change as impetus for increased pub
licity.
"A survey we conduc ted told us that
there are two groups of students at Stan
ford," Choy said. "The first group finds
us and takes advantage of the help we
offer. The second group never finds us;
they have to figure everything out on
their own. We want to encourage more
students to find out who we are, to move
into that first group."
To that end, the CDC is using money
from a recent grant to plaster its re
designed logo around campus. Five $ 100
cash prizes will be raffled oil today to stu
dents who have registered online or at

the new building.
The evolution of the new CDC began
last May, when a two-alarm fire forced it
to relocate from its old site on White Plaza
to Galvez Street's Bakewell Building.
"Our traffic dropped incredibly,"
Choy said. "It was awful. We were way off
the beaten path. Students couldn't find
us, or they didn't have the time to come
out to where we were at."
The new construction was done with
University funds. The CDC was slated for
a new building before the fire due to
structural concerns about the White
Plaza site's earthquake safety.
Despite the series of moves, last year
roughly 80 percent of the graduating
class was registered in the CDC system
and had access to its online work-study,
internship and job database. But one of
Choy's initiatives this year is to increase
underclass registration.
"If freshmen become familiar with us
early on, they can take advantage of our
services and resources," ('hoy said.
The CDC holds panels on different ca
reer fields, provides career counseling
and sends out e-mails about events relat-

Ed to registrants' interests.
Sophomore Mia Ashton agreed that
freshman can benefit from using the
CDC. She came to the facility's library on
Oct. 2 to look into a summer job.
"As a freshman I was really over
whelmed by everything that was going on
and I started too late. This year I want to
get ahead, and it's great to have all of this
to work with," Ashton said.
Choy emphasizes that the resources
and counseling provided are not always
directly job-related. Although the Under
graduate Advising Center is responsible
for helping students choose a major,
often that decision is tied to the question,
"What can I do with a certain major after
graduation?"
Choy explained that counselors are
available to help students explore the
practicality of a given major. Fittingly, the
architect for the new CDC building is a
Stanford alumnus who majored in Eng
lish.
"We talk with them about the fluidity
of careers and how things evolve," Choy
said.
The CDC's other major initia
tive for the year is connecting stu
dents with alumni. According to
the CDC's materials, networking is
crucial, because 50 percent of stu
dents find jobs through a contact.
"[Networking] is one of the
most valuable skills you can leave
here with outside of your academ
ic training, but it's scary to take that
first step," Choy said. "One of the
marvelous things about Stanford is
that so many alumni love connect
ing with students."
He foresees that the CDC will
have an easier time connecting
with students in its new location in
part because proximity to the
Haas Center will enable "cross
fertilization."
"Like them, we help students do
great things," Choy said. "Part of
that is helping individuals figure
out what that means for them. We
want to be with students and alum
ni as they set goals and make plans
to achieve those goals."

services and resources," ('hoy said.
The CDC holds panels on different ca
reer fields, provides career counseling
and sends out e-mails about events relat-

Ed to registrants' interests.
Sophomore Mia Ashton agreed that
freshman can benefit from using the
CDC. She came to the facility's library on
Oct. 2 to look into a summer job.
"As a freshman I was really over
whelmed by everything that was going on
and I started too late. This year I want to
get ahead, and it's great to have all of this
to work with," Ashton said.
Choy emphasizes that the resources
and counseling provided are not always
directly job-related. Although the Under
graduate Advising Center is responsible
for helping students choose a major,
often that decision is tied to the question,
"What can I do with a certain major after
graduation?"
Choy explained that counselors are
available to help students explore the
practicality of a given major. Fittingly, the
architect for the new CDC building is a
Stanford alumnus who majored in Eng
lish.
"We talk with them about the fluidity
of careers and how things evolve," Choy
said.
The CDC's other major initia
tive for the year is connecting stu
dents with alumni. According to
the CDC's materials, networking is
crucial, because 50 percent of stu
dents find jobs through a contact.
"[Networking] is one of the
most valuable skills you can leave
here with outside of your academ
ic training, but it's scary to take that
first step," Choy said. "One of the
marvelous things about Stanford is
that so many alumni love connect
ing with students."
He foresees that the CDC will
have an easier time connecting
with students in its new location in
part because proximity to the
Haas Center will enable "cross
fertilization."
"Like them, we help students do
great things," Choy said. "Part of
that is helping individuals figure
out what that means for them. We
want to be with students and alum
ni as they set goals and make plans
to achieve those goals."

The Career Development Center has relocated to a new building on Salvatierra Walk. This marks the CDC's second
move in one-and-a-half years.
