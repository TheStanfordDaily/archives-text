# Journalist fired from post at epa.net
## 
### ANTHONY HA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Henrietta Burroughs, an Emmy Award
winning journalist, was fired last week from
her position as content manager of the East
Palo Alto Web site epa.net. The termination of
her contract came soon after Burroughs pub
lished an article on the site raising questions
about the administration of the Ravenswood
School District.
Burroughs has accused her former superi
ors at Plugged In, the community technology
center supervising epa.net, of censorship and
of firing her because they saw her as a threat.
Burroughs, whose previous employers in
clude the New York Post and television station
WNBC, first joined epa.net in July. She said
that as content manager she summarized and
created links to East Palo Alto-related news ar
ticles, wrote for the site and encouraged local
residents to contribute to it.
"It was a job that allowed me to use skills and
abilities and combine them with my passion to
enrich the lives of people around me," Bur
roughs said. "East Palo Alto had real needs."
On a weekly basis, she also posted a brief
article designed to promote discussion. On
Sept. 12 — the official launch date of the
epa.net site — Burroughs published an arti
cle asking, "What can the Ravenswood City
School District do to provide a better educa
tion?", referring to the district that runs East
Palo Alto schools and is one of the poorest in
San Mateo County.
According to Burroughs, the article used
only information from local newspapers and
did not really contain anything original, but a
Ravenswood official complained nonetheless.
The article was removed from the site's home
page to the discussion section without consult-

ing Burroughs.
" There was no reason to
move the article," she said.
"Anyone who objected to the
story could always post a reply
on the site. If stories can be
pulled because people are un
happy, then we don't really
have freedom of the press."
Magda Escobar, executive

director of Plugged In, then proposed that
Burroughs only write human interest stories
until an advisory council with editorial input on
the site was created.
"It's not censorship, just assuring that the
right processes are in place to make sure that
when we cover controversial issues, we don't
have to bow to political processes," Escobar
said. In responding to Burroughs' complaint
that she was not told before the story was
moved, Escobar added, "[Burroughs] was
pretty unreachable. I didn't have a phone
number to reach her at, so the logistics were
difficult."
Burroughs, on the other hand, argued that
the advisory board could do a great deal of
harm to the site.
"If people with a vested interest in the com
munity are on the board, they might object to
certain stories, and that does not lead to a 112 ree
flow of information," she said. "I'm not against
the idea of a board, but I think that it should be
composed of people who have journalistic ex
perience, not a vested interest."
Following the removal of the Ravenswood
story from the main Web site, Burroughs told
the administration of Plugged In that she
might bring her story to the local press.
"I said that the removal of the story was a
disservice of to the community," Burroughs
said. "I asked, 'What would the press think if

they found out about this?'"
Escobar said, "I think that Henrietta was
upset because we questioned her judgment.
She threatened to call the newspapers, which I
thought was a pretty dysfunctional thing to do.
At that point, it didn't seem like she was the
right person to continue running the site."
Both Escobar and Burroughs agreed that
the final catalyst leading to the termination of
Burroughs' contract was the fact that she had
not created an advisory board for the site. But
where Escobar said that Burroughs had three
months to work on the project, Burroughs
claimed that she had only been given a lew
days' notice.
Last Tuesday, Burroughs and East Palo
Alto resident Marilu Serrano — who said that
she knew Burroughs through Plugged in and
the community improvement project One
East Palo Alto — spoke before the East Palo
Alto City Council.
Serrano is circulating a four-point petition:
that the epa.net advisory board not include
those with vested interests but include experi
enced writers and journalists; that Plugged In
and epa.net function as two separate organiza
tions; that Burroughs be reinstated as content
manager; and that no one else be fired from ei
ther Plugged In orepa.net until his or her em
ployment history has been reviewed by
Plugged In's Board of Directors.
"I'm bilingual, and I read a lot of news from
Latin America, so I'm very, very aware of how
precious First Amendment rights are," Serra
no said. "It's just an outrage for anybody to
have the power to go knocking on the Plugged
In director's door and tell them what they can
put on the Web site."
Burroughs is looking fora new position with
similar duties, while epa.net continues its
search fora new content manager.
