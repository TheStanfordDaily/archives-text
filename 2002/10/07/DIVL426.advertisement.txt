What Is What Was
Richard Stern will read from

"in this volume, Richard Stern goes out of his sinewy ways as a
novelist, primarily to play the role of essayist, of commentator on
an astounding range of subjects and objects, both public and private.
The reader's mind is stimulated in the most pleasurable way
imaginable by these occasional pieces. Stern refers to the volume as
'orderly miscellany/ 'Orderly' is hardly the attribute the reader will
think of in summarizing this delightfully 'disorderly' collection.
—Gerhard Casper
* A writer's life lived open —pored among spirited books, places,
friends —in sum, a fully lived life, which Richard Stern generously,
gently draws us into. Fed by an attentive memory, Stern's quick
and rich awareness brings us Babel, Bellow, the human side of
Pound and Ellison and many others, including candidly himself.
—John Felstiner
'There is no one around more adept than Richard Stern in conveying
what living the 'literary life' comes to in present-day America.
A first-rate novelist, not too famous, Stern is perfectly positioned
to show how writing fora living and living for writing can make
fora rich existence in a disjointed world. These portraits, stories,
reviews, reports, outbursts, and memoirs are more than occasions
and fragments; they are dead-on accounts of what is going on out
there these days. J5 —Clifford Geertz
'In the past when I read Richard Stern's short stories and novels
I thought, 'What an insight! You've got it right! That's just the way it
is.' Now, while reading his essays, I kept thinking, 'What an insight!
You've got it right! That's just the way it is.' —Richard Lewontin
