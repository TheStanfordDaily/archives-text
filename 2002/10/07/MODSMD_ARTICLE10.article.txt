# Hurricane Lili blows through Louisiana

### 
NEW ORLEANS (AP) —
Home generators used by people
who lost power after Hurricane
Lili have led to more than 60 cases
of carbon monoxide poisoning in
Louisiana, including one death,
state health officials said yesterday.
Lili blew through the state on
Thursday, flooding thousands of
homes and badly damaging others
with 100 mph wind that toppled
trees and power lines.
By midday yesterday, some
107,572 homes and businesses
were still without power in coastal
Louisiana.
Many people were using home
generators until power lines
could be repaired. The genera

tors run on a variety offuels, most
commonly gasoline or natural
gas, and odorless, colorless car
bon monoxide is a byproduct of
the fuel burning.
"Some of them don't realize the
risk involved," state health officer
Dr. Jimmy Guidry said. He added
that generators should be placed
outside, away from windows or
other openings that might allow
carbon monoxide to seep in.
Flooding from Lili's powerful
storm surge had largely receded
by yesterday but the cleanup - and
damage assessment - continued.
Statewide, the number of shel
ters, which peaked at 98 immediate
ly after the storm, was down to six.
