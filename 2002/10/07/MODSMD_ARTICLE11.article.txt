## The 						Stanford Daily Recent CoHo redecoration a faux-fur fiasco 
### 
PubUihed Since J 891

When it comes to cool, on-cam
pus spots to study and social
ize, the Stanford community
faces an abysmal lack of choic
es. Now that the Coffee House has been re
modeled into an Ikea-inspired landscape of
faux fur, the number of such choices has
dwindled by one.
Does the CoHo's management honestly
expect students to read Fitzgerald while nes
tled in a furry yellow throw? To meet with a
professor who clutches a hot-pink pillow? To
settle with a prospective freshman on a lime
green couch and claim, half-believably, "No,
I swear, it's great here!"
Putting the logistical oversight aside fora
moment (Could anyone have possibly cho
sen a more stain-prone shade than the snow
white armchairs?), the new CoHo isn't just

ugly — it's unforgivable.
Admittedly, the old CoHo wasn't perfect.
The heavy brown furniture was dull and
aging. A cheesy mural covered the walls, in
terspersed with the occasional this-is-college
life photo exhibit. On busy Thursday nights,
it was often difficult to find a comfortable
seat. Many customers, if asked last year,
would have agreed that the room could use
a redecoration.
But when CoHo veterans returned to
campus this year and opened the doors to
their favorite dark-and-dreary study spot,
many were repulsed. The tables are still
there, of course — still dirty, still chipped,
still sticky and coffee-stained. But they have
been rearranged to make room for the new
furniture, relegated to the side of the dining
room that nobody wants to sit on. The walls,

which were once at least colorful (if artless),
are now completely bare.
For many members of the Stanford com
munity, the new CoHo presents troubling
dilemmas. We wonder where to take our
friends, dates and visitors. The fluorescent
decor distracts us from studying. We worry
that prospective freshmen will take one look
at "Stanford's coolest hangout" and run
straight to Telegraph Avenue.
We wonder how such a tasteless redeco
rating mistake was made. In determining a
style scheme, the CoHo's management has
made gross miscalculations — both literally
and figuratively.
If the management had collected more
student input in planning the redesign, the
CoHo's unsightly appearance would likely
have been averted. Instead, a moderately

pleasant hangout has become an interior de
signer's nightmare.
Bon Appetit, which owns the CoHo, has
consistently been losing money in its Stan
ford operations. Was the redecoration an at
tempt to bring in more customers? If so, we
find it utterly misguided — unless its target
audience spends its spare time in the chil
dren's section of Barnes & Noble.
The CoHo is one of few options for con
certs, meetings and other social gatherings,
and we ask that the inside at least look pre
sentable. After all, those students who care to
mingle with pre-schoolers can spend their
Thursday nights in their RFs' apartments.
On behalf of the others, we plead for the re
turn of the old CoHo — thrift-store couches
and all.
Until then? At least it still serves coffee.
