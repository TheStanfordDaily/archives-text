Campus Watch 'prevents
spread of canards'
Congratulations to Hilton Oben
zinger's efforts to promote freedom of aca
demic expression ("Campus Watch seeks
'to scare people away from independent
thought,' " Oct. 4). However, shouldn't all
people be entitled to those same rights?
Obenzinger forgot to mention in his
letter that 15,000-plus European aca
demics from many universities signed an
academic boycott of Israeli scholars. Some
of us had family members who were dis
missed from universities by Nazis without
protest by non-Jewish professors, only
two generations ago. That academic boy
cott was a warm-up act to the Holocaust.
What about the wide dissemination of
"Mein Kampf," the Protocols of the Elders
of Zion and other anti-Semitic canards
throughout the Arab world? Will that be
explored in the effort to achieve academic
openness? Why did the President of Har
vard University need to issue a warning
about emerging anti-Semitism on our na
tion's campuses?
Stanford definitely needs more scholar
ship in the area of Islam, as it does in the
area of Judaism and Middle East studies.
It was only 35 years ago that Jewish stu
dents were barred from saying "kaddish"
on the Stanford campus unless they did so
in Memorial Church.
Stanford is behind in scholarship of Ju
daism and Israel, as well as of Islam, and I
applaud Campus Watch for trying to pre
vent the spread of canards from Europe to
America.

Implication tfiat Israel drops bombs on
Kurds: 'slanderous and offensive'
I find the final paragraph in Thomas
Taylor's anti-Israel letter ("U.S. needs to
'resolve the problem of Israel,'" Oct. 3)
slanderous and offensive. One finds un
corroborated innuendo that a "particular
ally" of the U.S. and the U.K. (Israel, by
implication) patrolling the Iraqi no-fly
zone "routinely" drops its bombs on inno
cent Kurds.
Israel was excluded from participation
in the Gulf War in order to keep Arab states
in the coalition. Saddam launched several
Scud missiles against civilian populations,
apparently hoping to draw Israel into the
conflict and thereby shatter the coalition.
No Israeli aircraft have participated in
the patrols of the no-fly zones, and none
have bombed Iraqi Kurds.

Israel leads Middle East in human rights
I must take issue with Thomas Taylor's
allegation that Israel is the principal
destabilizing factor in the Middle East
("U.S. needs to 'resolve the problem of Is

rael,' " Oct. 3). On the contrary, the Mus
lim world is involved globally in strife, war
and terrorism. Israel is not perfect, but it
is the only country in the Middle East with
equal rights for all its citizens, rights to
vote and free speech, freedom of press,
rights for women and freedom to worship
as one sees fit. Eighteen percent of Israel
is Muslim. They even have representation
in the Knesset.

An invitation to National
Coming Out Day
I would rate the day I first asked my
self if I was gay as one of the most impor
tant in my life. After much soul searching,
I began the difficult process of coming
out to my friends and family. Events such
as National Coming Out Day, which is on
Oct. 11 each year, helped me explore and
reaffirm my sense of self.
My freshman year, there was a single
table in White Plaza with student volun
teers handing out ribbons and stickers and
talking to passersby. While I appreciated
their effort, I felt that I would have liked a
bigger, more visible queer presence.
This year, however, I am proud to be
on staff at the LGBT-CRC, and to be work
ing on an event in White Plaza that will in
clude a band, installation art and plenty of
color. I am really excited about the up
coming events and extend my sincerest in
vitation to all — straight allies and queer
alike —to attend. Visit http://lgbt.stan
ford.edu for details.

Israel-lraq comparison
'completely baseless'
The tired Israel-Iraq analogy drawn by
Thomas Taylor ("U.S. needs to 'resolve
the problem of Israel,'" Oct. 3) is com
pletely baseless, and remains so — though
it is often repeated by apologists for Arab
tyrannies. Iraq is led by a dictator who has
a track record of gassing his own citizenry,
bullying his neighbors and aggressively
developing and using weapons of mass de
struction. Any U.S.-led war on that coun
try would be aimed at its regime — not the
people, who would only stand to gain
from Saddam's removal.
Israel, on the other hand, is a small,
multicultural democracy whose civilians,
cities and villages are perennial targets of
genocidal attacks by an enemy who vastly
outnumbers it. Israel's entire defense pos
ture and history — including its presence
in the West Bank and Gaza (which, inci
dentally, are not "occupied" but "disput
ed') — were caused by the Arab states'un
remitting racist hatred against it, rather
than the other way around.
No compromise offer, however gener
ous — from the partition plan of 1947 to
the Barak offer of 2000 — has ever satis

fied those enemies. That is for the simple
reason that their idea of peace is a Middle
East devoid of Jews.
While Taylor's Middle East fallacies are
hardly original (especially among people
steeped in modern academic orthodoxy),
what I do find chillingly fascinating is the
revealing terminology he employs: He
refers to Israel as a "problem" to be solved,
in the tradition or eliminationist anti-
Semitism of European and Arab vintage.

Call to 'stop forming judgments'
Recently, Reverend Jerry Falwell was
quoted in the news to have called Prophet
Muhammad a terrorist. And why was
that? Just because a few misguided Mus
lims did a regrettable act? Why is such a
narrow-minded approach taken? No
Muslim ever calls Prophet Moses a terror
ist when Israel attacks Palestine. No one
called Jesus a terrorist when the British be
haved atrociously towards their colonies.
No one calls Shiva or Kali a terrorist when
thousands of Kashmiris are killed.
And it would be very wrong to do so.
Isn't it time to rise above this pettiness and
see reality as it should be seen? Isn't it time
to stop generalizing and stop forming
judgments on people we know nothing or
very little about? I think it is.

'No moral equivalence' between
Iraq and Israel
I am writing in response to Thomas
Taylor's letter to The Daily ("U.S. needs to
'resolve the problem of Israel,' " Oct. 3).
Perhaps Taylor would like to enlighten
us on exacdy how Israel is destabilizing the
Middle East. Is it through four defensive
wars where Israel's neighbors were the ag
gressors? Is it perhaps by offering to give
back land (Sinai, West Bank and Gaza) ac
quired during those defensive wars? Is it by
providing its Arab citizens with the greatest
political and religious freedoms of any
state in the Middle East? Or is it by having
its citizens, both Jews and Arabs, blown up
by homicidal maniacs who are trained and
sponsored by Saddam Hussein?
Taylor attempts to paint a picture of
moral equivalence between Israel, a parlia
mentary democracy, and Iraq, a brutal dic
tatorship. There can be no moral equiva
lence between a country that has over the
last 50 years repeatedly demonstrated that
it only wants to maintain its territorial in
tegrity and live in peace with its neighbors,
and a country that has over the last 20 years
invaded two of its neighbors for no reason
other than the desire for conquest.
