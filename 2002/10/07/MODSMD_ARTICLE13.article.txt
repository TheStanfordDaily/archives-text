# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## U.S. leadership not as blameless, selfless as Beichman purports 
### MAHAN ESFAHANI GUEST COLUMNIST 
In his Oct. 1 column in The Daily
("United States finds itself alone in the
fight against Saddam"), Arnold Beichman
contends that "the United States is now
the victim that the European Union would
like to toss off the sled" is faulty, and the
use of a comparison with the status of
Czechoslovakia in the Munich Pact further
exposes the outrageous nature of such a
statement.
First of all, it was Hitler, not Czechoslo
vakia, who had the upper hand (militarily
speaking, of course) at Munich, whereas
the United States is capable of overpower
ing Iraq at any time. Secondly, the image
of the U.S. as a victim just does not make
sense. The European Union is not helping
Iraq in a war against the United States, nor
is it offering the U.S. on a platter to Sad
dam Hussein. This is the post-1945 world,
t he era of the United Nations and interna
tional cooperation. Or so we were told.
Do France and Germany not have the
right to question a war against Iraq, an
action that has so many regional and in
ternational implications? Or must every
one be like British Prime Minister Tony
Blair of the United Kingdom and use
press time to periodically provide anno
tations to whatever the Bush administra
tion has to say?
Furthermore, it is interesting that Be
ichman refers to the E.U. as "amnesiac" in
its attitudes toward the United States. Be
fore playing the blame game, the author
should himself recall that the United

States in fact has a long history of "tossing
the weak oil" to "appease the wolves," to
use his own expression. The American
"super-patriot," celebrated for his mono
lithic frame of mind, is also often referred
to as being conveniently forgetful, and this
article shows that it's not hard to see why.
Let us examine the record. In 1953, the
CIA-sponsored Operation Ajax overthrew
a popularly elected democratic govern
ment in Iran led by Prime Minister Mo
hammad Mossadegh and brought back a
U.S.-friendly and oppressive monarchy.
This regime was given carte blanche to do
what it pleased in order to protect Anglo-
American oil interests, and was main
tained in an unreserved disregard for the
voice of an entire nation clamoring for re
form. Sound familiar? The U.S. remains
deaf to the cries for freedom from the
Palestinian people. Our establishment,
awash in a cult of ignorance of its own cre
ation, finds it far easier to label suicide
bombers as mere terrorists rather than
taking the time to examine the utterly
hopeless nature of their actions.
The U.S. media does not feature much
news about internal revolts in Saudi Ara
bia. This is not because they do not hap
pen; it is rather due to the unspeakable
ruthlessness with which the Saudi Arabian
state quashes voices of opposition. If the
United States were to place the principles
that it feigns to assume above its economic
interests, it would withdraw from the Ara
bian peninsula and give the people of that
region a chance at self-determination.
Beichman goes on to argue, "that the
Soviet LJnion finally fell has little to do with

Western Europe and everything to do
with President Ronald Reagan." Aside
from yet another display of the typical con
servative cookie-cutter paeans to former
President Reagan, it is important to note
that the author's choice to blatantly ignore
the efforts of the Russian people in over
throwing the Bolshevik state is typical of
the kind of attitude that makes the inter
national policy of the United States un
popular in the first place. Americans seem
to have a notion that oppressed people are
clueless, apparently rendering Wilson's
"self-determination for all peoples" a myth
and justifying U.S. action to supposedly
"free" people from tyranny.
The list of U.S.-supported dictatorships
is long, and a few notable ones come to
mind: the brutal dictatorship of Zia ul-
Haq in Pakistan, the oppressive regime of
the last Shah of Iran, Generalissimo Fran
co's fascist state in Spain, and the numer
ous client-dictators in Latin America are
included in the roster.
And there is one more member of the
club, someone who, until relatively re
cently, was one of the LJ.S. government's
favorite dictators: Saddam Hussein of
Iraq. Let's be honest — those weapon
technologies didn't just walk over there
by themselves.
The list of hypocrisy goes on and pro
vides a rather pronounced contrast when
juxtaposed with the U.S. penchant lor
claiming to act based on the principles of
democracy. So much for the thin veneer of
moral superiority.
The claim that there is a threat to
"Western civilization" is a dusty one that

should be left on the shelf of amusing po
litical notions. Maybe the people who be
lieve such things should remember that
Western civilization is not the only civiliza
tion in the world. The notion of "us vs.
them" is past its time and accomplishes
nothing more than to plant the seeds for
future discord.
And the reference to the "terrorist wing
among the Islamist migrants who live in
high-rise slums?" This is just another ex
ample of the xenophobic theory of the
"sleeper" immigrant, the image of the sus
picious foreigner (note the emphasis on
the low socioeconomic status of these peo
ple) lurking in the shadows among us.' 1 he
foreigner who, when the time comes, will
become our enemy.
Within days after the Sept. 11 attacks,
the Bush administration's stance of
"you're either with us or against us" be
came quite apparent. What are we to do
with such an attitude? What is the Unit
ed States to expect when it flagrantly dis
respects the efforts of the United Na
tions and approaches the organization's
decisions with a hypocrisy that serves to
protect the most egregious violations
committed by its friends? Our govern
ment is unabashed in its establishment
and subsequent support of governments
that violate the most basic human rights,
and is then disappointed in being voted
off the U.N. Committee on Human
Rights.
Are we are expected to commend
men like Secretary of Defense Donald
Rumsfeld and Attorney General John
Ashcroft for ignoring dissent and voices

of intellect and reason?

("United States finds itself alone in the
fight against Saddam"), Arnold Beichman
contends that "the United States is now
the victim that the European Union would
like to toss off the sled" is faulty, and the
use of a comparison with the status of
Czechoslovakia in the Munich Pact further
exposes the outrageous nature of such a
statement.
First of all, it was Hitler, not Czechoslo
vakia, who had the upper hand (militarily
speaking, of course) at Munich, whereas
the United States is capable of overpower
ing Iraq at any time. Secondly, the image
of the U.S. as a victim just does not make
sense. The European Union is not helping
Iraq in a war against the United States, nor
is it offering the U.S. on a platter to Sad
dam Hussein. This is the post-1945 world,
t he era of the United Nations and interna
tional cooperation. Or so we were told.
Do France and Germany not have the
right to question a war against Iraq, an
action that has so many regional and in
ternational implications? Or must every
one be like British Prime Minister Tony
Blair of the United Kingdom and use
press time to periodically provide anno
tations to whatever the Bush administra
tion has to say?
Furthermore, it is interesting that Be
ichman refers to the E.U. as "amnesiac" in
its attitudes toward the United States. Be
fore playing the blame game, the author
should himself recall that the United

States in fact has a long history of "tossing
the weak oil" to "appease the wolves," to
use his own expression. The American
"super-patriot," celebrated for his mono
lithic frame of mind, is also often referred
to as being conveniently forgetful, and this
article shows that it's not hard to see why.
Let us examine the record. In 1953, the
CIA-sponsored Operation Ajax overthrew
a popularly elected democratic govern
ment in Iran led by Prime Minister Mo
hammad Mossadegh and brought back a
U.S.-friendly and oppressive monarchy.
This regime was given carte blanche to do
what it pleased in order to protect Anglo-
American oil interests, and was main
tained in an unreserved disregard for the
voice of an entire nation clamoring for re
form. Sound familiar? The U.S. remains
deaf to the cries for freedom from the
Palestinian people. Our establishment,
awash in a cult of ignorance of its own cre
ation, finds it far easier to label suicide
bombers as mere terrorists rather than
taking the time to examine the utterly
hopeless nature of their actions.
The U.S. media does not feature much
news about internal revolts in Saudi Ara
bia. This is not because they do not hap
pen; it is rather due to the unspeakable
ruthlessness with which the Saudi Arabian
state quashes voices of opposition. If the
United States were to place the principles
that it feigns to assume above its economic
interests, it would withdraw from the Ara
bian peninsula and give the people of that
region a chance at self-determination.
Beichman goes on to argue, "that the
Soviet LJnion finally fell has little to do with

Western Europe and everything to do
with President Ronald Reagan." Aside
from yet another display of the typical con
servative cookie-cutter paeans to former
President Reagan, it is important to note
that the author's choice to blatantly ignore
the efforts of the Russian people in over
throwing the Bolshevik state is typical of
the kind of attitude that makes the inter
national policy of the United States un
popular in the first place. Americans seem
to have a notion that oppressed people are
clueless, apparently rendering Wilson's
"self-determination for all peoples" a myth
and justifying U.S. action to supposedly
"free" people from tyranny.
The list of U.S.-supported dictatorships
is long, and a few notable ones come to
mind: the brutal dictatorship of Zia ul-
Haq in Pakistan, the oppressive regime of
the last Shah of Iran, Generalissimo Fran
co's fascist state in Spain, and the numer
ous client-dictators in Latin America are
included in the roster.
And there is one more member of the
club, someone who, until relatively re
cently, was one of the LJ.S. government's
favorite dictators: Saddam Hussein of
Iraq. Let's be honest — those weapon
technologies didn't just walk over there
by themselves.
The list of hypocrisy goes on and pro
vides a rather pronounced contrast when
juxtaposed with the U.S. penchant lor
claiming to act based on the principles of
democracy. So much for the thin veneer of
moral superiority.
The claim that there is a threat to
"Western civilization" is a dusty one that

should be left on the shelf of amusing po
litical notions. Maybe the people who be
lieve such things should remember that
Western civilization is not the only civiliza
tion in the world. The notion of "us vs.
them" is past its time and accomplishes
nothing more than to plant the seeds for
future discord.
And the reference to the "terrorist wing
among the Islamist migrants who live in
high-rise slums?" This is just another ex
ample of the xenophobic theory of the
"sleeper" immigrant, the image of the sus
picious foreigner (note the emphasis on
the low socioeconomic status of these peo
ple) lurking in the shadows among us.' 1 he
foreigner who, when the time comes, will
become our enemy.
Within days after the Sept. 11 attacks,
the Bush administration's stance of
"you're either with us or against us" be
came quite apparent. What are we to do
with such an attitude? What is the Unit
ed States to expect when it flagrantly dis
respects the efforts of the United Na
tions and approaches the organization's
decisions with a hypocrisy that serves to
protect the most egregious violations
committed by its friends? Our govern
ment is unabashed in its establishment
and subsequent support of governments
that violate the most basic human rights,
and is then disappointed in being voted
off the U.N. Committee on Human
Rights.
Are we are expected to commend
men like Secretary of Defense Donald
Rumsfeld and Attorney General John
Ashcroft for ignoring dissent and voices

of intellect and reason?
