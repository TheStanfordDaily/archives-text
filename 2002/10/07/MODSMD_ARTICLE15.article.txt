# From Uzbekistan to Barbados
## Students find meaningful summer work in out-of-the-way locales 
### LIAN BLOCH 
This summer Stanford students once again
demonstrated their affinity for taking the road
less traveled. Many undergraduates spent the
last three months participating in research and
internships domestically, yet some dared to
venture further afield.
Senior Dan Gandarilla and sophomores
Alex Bleyleben and Robb Gibson sought out
unique and exotic opportunities across the
globe to immerse themselves in different cul
tures, meet amazing people and, of course,
make a buck this summer.
"I wanted to get away and try something
new this summer," Bleyleben explained. He
scoured Stanford's Career Development
Center's database for opportunities in "'far
away' places."
He did not anticipate that his search would
lead him to the tiny country of Uzbekistan,
where his official task involved teaching English
to a group of 1(5 Uzbek teens.
"My job was not so much to teach them
grammar as it was to hangout with them and to
get them talking fluently with a native speaker,"
Bleyleben said. "1 taught the kids English dur
ing the week from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., and then we
went and played soccer or swam or went to a
cafe in the afternoons."
Bleyleben's most memorable experiences
also resulted from his adventures exploring the
country. During his fifth and final week, he
traveled with an Uzbek friend, whose English
abilities were limited, through Southeastern
Uzbekistan and up to Northern Kyrgyzstan.
"The trip was amazing. We took a 13-hour
taxi ride from Osh to the capital, Bishkek, in a
Mercedes that had logged just under 1 million
miles," Bleyleben said. "/Ml in all, we taxi
hopped for two lull days and nights until we
reached Issyk-kul, the second biggest alpine
lake in the world."
And what about the concern of traveling to a
country that borders Afghanistan in the post-
Sept. 11 era?
"All of those doubts were unfounded,"
Bleyleben explained, emphasizing the over
whelming hospitality he received.
"The poorest of the poor would offer up
everything to make me feel welcome, 112 was
treated like family everywhere I went, and that
contributed to my experience as much as any of
the amazing sites I saw."
Gibson also engaged in a remarkable inter
national experience. Gibson co-led a communi
ty service trip among isolated villages in north
ern Thailand for Rustic Pathways, an adven
ture tour company.
"I spent my time picking lip garbage,
putting down tile, and painting a preschool,"
Gibson said. With his group of teens, Gibson
spent his time in the remote rice-farming com
munity of Bon Chang Yun.
The program's participants and leaders

were hosted by local families. For Gibson,
the generosity of his hosts left quite an in
delible impression.
l he family with which Gibson stayed lost
its father several years ago. Ultimately,
Kaduin, the family's youngest son, was
forced to give up his pursuit of the
monastery to return home and support his
family. In light of its dire finances, the fami
ly's generosity impressed Gibson.
"They share everything they have, open
ing up their houses for places to sleep and
inviting you in to eat," Gibson said. "They
share more than people with a thousand
times what they have."
(iibson now looks forward to a time when he
can return the favor and invite Kaduin to his
home in Chicago.
"It is the least my family and I can do," Gib
son said. "Kaduin... has come to be like a
brother to me, his family like my family. That is
the thing that is most wonderful [about | travel
ing and working with Rustic Pathways; it is set
up like a family and focuses on attracting peo
ple with good hearts."
While both Bleyleben and Gibson's adven
tures were molded around specific job oppor
tunities, Senior Dan Gandarilla traveled to the
University of the West Indies in Barbados to
study abroad this summer and stumbled upon
a unique job offer.

"I was merely sitting down at dinner
when a group of three people arrived and
asked if anyone wanted to do a radio com
mercial," said Gandarilla. "Little did 1 know
that one of the people 1 had just met was a
hot performing artist known best lor his
song 'I am not Bin Laden,' "
(Jandarilla was handsomely compensated
lor pitching Cockspur Rum and Banks Beer on
the radio waves with an unusual form of pay
ment. lie was remunerated with free admis
sion, unlimited bar access and"a chance to
jump with any band 1 wanted" at all the island
parties sponsored by the companies for which
lie had done the commercials.
Bui it wasn't all fun and games.
"I never really [realized] all the effort that
goes into making commercials, particularly
those on the radio," Gandarilla said. "I
probably had to redo that first commercial
about 20 times before they actually said it
was usable, 10 more times before they said
they liked if, and five times after that just for
good measure.
"1 left the studio on the first night with a
hairline fracture in my jaw, three black eyes
and a ruptured spleen. 1 still have night
mares of that first day."
But, joking aside, he's quick to add that
his job this summer was "an opportunity of
a lifetime."

his job this summer was "an opportunity of

This summer Stanford students once again
demonstrated their affinity for taking the road
less traveled. Many undergraduates spent the
last three months participating in research and
internships domestically, yet some dared to
venture further afield.
Senior Dan Gandarilla and sophomores
Alex Bleyleben and Robb Gibson sought out
unique and exotic opportunities across the
globe to immerse themselves in different cul
tures, meet amazing people and, of course,
make a buck this summer.
"I wanted to get away and try something
new this summer," Bleyleben explained. He
scoured Stanford's Career Development
Center's database for opportunities in "'far
away' places."
He did not anticipate that his search would
lead him to the tiny country of Uzbekistan,
where his official task involved teaching English
to a group of 1(5 Uzbek teens.
"My job was not so much to teach them
grammar as it was to hangout with them and to
get them talking fluently with a native speaker,"
Bleyleben said. "1 taught the kids English dur
ing the week from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., and then we
went and played soccer or swam or went to a
cafe in the afternoons."
Bleyleben's most memorable experiences
also resulted from his adventures exploring the
country. During his fifth and final week, he
traveled with an Uzbek friend, whose English
abilities were limited, through Southeastern
Uzbekistan and up to Northern Kyrgyzstan.
"The trip was amazing. We took a 13-hour
taxi ride from Osh to the capital, Bishkek, in a
Mercedes that had logged just under 1 million
miles," Bleyleben said. "/Ml in all, we taxi
hopped for two lull days and nights until we
reached Issyk-kul, the second biggest alpine
lake in the world."
And what about the concern of traveling to a
country that borders Afghanistan in the post-
Sept. 11 era?
"All of those doubts were unfounded,"
Bleyleben explained, emphasizing the over
whelming hospitality he received.
"The poorest of the poor would offer up
everything to make me feel welcome, 112 was
treated like family everywhere I went, and that
contributed to my experience as much as any of
the amazing sites I saw."
Gibson also engaged in a remarkable inter
national experience. Gibson co-led a communi
ty service trip among isolated villages in north
ern Thailand for Rustic Pathways, an adven
ture tour company.
"I spent my time picking lip garbage,
putting down tile, and painting a preschool,"
Gibson said. With his group of teens, Gibson
spent his time in the remote rice-farming com
munity of Bon Chang Yun.
The program's participants and leaders

were hosted by local families. For Gibson,
the generosity of his hosts left quite an in
delible impression.
l he family with which Gibson stayed lost
its father several years ago. Ultimately,
Kaduin, the family's youngest son, was
forced to give up his pursuit of the
monastery to return home and support his
family. In light of its dire finances, the fami
ly's generosity impressed Gibson.
"They share everything they have, open
ing up their houses for places to sleep and
inviting you in to eat," Gibson said. "They
share more than people with a thousand
times what they have."
(iibson now looks forward to a time when he
can return the favor and invite Kaduin to his
home in Chicago.
"It is the least my family and I can do," Gib
son said. "Kaduin... has come to be like a
brother to me, his family like my family. That is
the thing that is most wonderful [about | travel
ing and working with Rustic Pathways; it is set
up like a family and focuses on attracting peo
ple with good hearts."
While both Bleyleben and Gibson's adven
tures were molded around specific job oppor
tunities, Senior Dan Gandarilla traveled to the
University of the West Indies in Barbados to
study abroad this summer and stumbled upon
a unique job offer.

"I was merely sitting down at dinner
when a group of three people arrived and
asked if anyone wanted to do a radio com
mercial," said Gandarilla. "Little did 1 know
that one of the people 1 had just met was a
hot performing artist known best lor his
song 'I am not Bin Laden,' "
(Jandarilla was handsomely compensated
lor pitching Cockspur Rum and Banks Beer on
the radio waves with an unusual form of pay
ment. lie was remunerated with free admis
sion, unlimited bar access and"a chance to
jump with any band 1 wanted" at all the island
parties sponsored by the companies for which
lie had done the commercials.
Bui it wasn't all fun and games.
"I never really [realized] all the effort that
goes into making commercials, particularly
those on the radio," Gandarilla said. "I
probably had to redo that first commercial
about 20 times before they actually said it
was usable, 10 more times before they said
they liked if, and five times after that just for
good measure.
"1 left the studio on the first night with a
hairline fracture in my jaw, three black eyes
and a ruptured spleen. 1 still have night
