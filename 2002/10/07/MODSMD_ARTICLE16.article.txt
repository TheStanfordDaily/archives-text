### WAYNN LUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Canadians on campus cele
brated the Canadian Thanksgiv
ing yesterday at Bechtel Interna
tional Center. Planned by the
Canadian Club, the event fea
tured a performance by the St.
Lawrence String Quartet, Stan
lord's artists-in-residence.
Also included was a traditional
Thanksgiving dinner, sponsored
by the Graduate Student Council,
Canada Immigration and Alberta
Innovation and Science.
"The goal of this event is to get
Canadians at Stanford together,
to connect to others and cele
brate together," said graduate

student Eric Shaver, finance
minister of the Canadian Club.
"Our Prime "Minister [of the
Canadian Club] Mohammed
Badi invited the St. Lawrence
String Quartet to perform for
this event. We were thrilled when
they agreed to play."
After starting out with the
Canadian national anthem, the
Quartet played two pieces, one by
Mozart and one by Schumann.
"Part of what we like to do here
is to bring the music to the stu
dents," said Geoff Muttall, the first
violinist. "We play at least 10 to 15
shows a year, and since three of
our members are Canadian, this
show seemed to be a good choice."
Other notable Canadians at the
celebration included Howard
Spiint, the Canadian Consul Gen
eral in Los Angeles, and Michael
Ede, Bay Area representative for
the province of Alberta.
"From time to time, the Con
sulate General reaches out to show
support for our true ambassadors
— students," Spunt said. "It's they
who demonstrate our culture,
dedication and friendship, and it's
l hey who are the Canadians of the
future."
Canadian Thanksgiving is olli
cially celebrated on the second
Monday in October, but it shares
many similarities with the Ameri
can holiday.
" They're very similar — all the
food's the same," Straver said.
" I he harvest is earlier in Canada,
though, so that's why it's celebrat
ed in October."
Students at the event said that

i hey were very pleased with the
celebration.
"The Canadians on campus are
a rather visible minority, but this is
a chance for everyone to celebrate
events that remind you of home,"
said Anne Robinson, a graduate
student.
Other students agreed.
"It's a great opportunity for
Canadians at Stanford to have a
taste of home," said Myles Steiner,
a graduate student.
"It's nice to get a bunch of
Canadians together on campus,
though I wish there were more un
dergrads here," said Kyle Doerk
sen, a junior.
The evening concluded with a
traditional turkey dinner.
"This is always the biggest event
lor the club," Straver said. "Every
one's always excited when tliey
come to Stanford and realize that
there's a touch of home here."
