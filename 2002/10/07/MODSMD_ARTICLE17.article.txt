# Stanford ranked #1 for service learning
## 
### CYNTHIA CHO EDITORIAL STAFF 
Each fall, high school seniors
and parents await the release of
U.S. News and World Report's list
of America's Best Colleges. While
many members of the Stanford
community may be aware that
Stanford landed in the number
four overall spot for National Uni
versities— Doctoral in the 2003
rankings, few may have noticed
that the University was ranked
number one in the country in ser
vice learning.
U.S. News defined service
learning as programs in which
"volunteering in the community is
an instructional strategy - a re
quirement of a student's course
work. The service informs what
happens in class, and vice versa."
At the core of service learning at
the University is the Haas Center
for Public Service at Stanford,
which "promotes, organizes and
supports public and community
service by members of the Stan

ford community," according to its
mission statement.
"'The Haas Center gives visible,
collective expression to the
breadth and depth of community
and public service carried out by
Stanford students, faculty and
staff," said Nadinne Cruz, director
of the Haas Center.
According to Kent Koth, ser
vice-learning program coordina
tor at the Haas Center, "The staff
and students at the Haas Center
for Public Service and other public
service advocates on campus have
chosen to define service learning
very broadly. We understand ser
vice learning . . . to encapsulate a
variety of programs."
The Haas Center is home to a
number of types of programs, in
cluding: staff-led programs, such
as the Ravenswood Reads Tutor
ing Program and Stanford in
Washington; staff-facilitated pro
grams, including Alternative
Spring Break and Stanford in
Government; partner programs,
including the Institute for Diversi
ty in the Arts and the Dr. and Mrs.
C.J. Huang Teaching Fellowship
in China; and nearly 40 student or
ganizations, including East Palo
Alto Tennis and Tutoring and
Women and Youth Supporting
Each Other.
"Service learning offers an im
portant means for Stanford stu
dents to help address the needs of
the local community and grapple
with the intractable social issues of
the contemporary era," Koth said.
"Perhaps most importantly, ser
vice learning helps students devel
op skills fora lifetime of civic en
gagement."
In addition, Haas Center staff
provided curricular assistance to

faculty who are teaching service
learning courses. 1 his year, .'V4 fac
ulty members from If) departments
are offering 47 service-learning
courses. Winter-quarter courses in
clude Political Science 221: Urban
Policy and Urban Studies 120:
Building Community.
"We apply the pedagogical
principles of rigorous service
learning — learning from struc
tured reflection on the experi
ence of doing service) in credit
earning courses as well as in ex
tracurricular service activities,"
Cruz said.
Cruz attributed Stanford's suc
cess in service learning to "a com
pelling team effort among many
parts of the University — faculty
leadership and practice of service
learning, student passion for so
cial responsibility, administrative
commitment of necessary finan
cial resources, and staff dedica
tion to providing an infrastruc

ture that 'brokers' partnerships
among the campus, community
groups and the broader govern
ment and public sector."
Stanford shares its number-one
ranking in service learning with
the University of Pennsylvania
and Berea College, an institution
which, according to Cruz, puts
service at the core of its mission.
"With our much larger size
and complexity [compared to
Berea College], I feel it is remark
able that service learning has
been institutionalized at Stanford
to a degree that would earn the
number-one ranking," Cruz said.
Service learning was one of the
eight types of programs identi
fied by the magazine. Stanford
was also ranked in the top five in
first-year experiences, senior
capstone and undergraduate re
search / creative projects.
Introduced for the first time
this year by U.S. News, this rank

ing includes schools that exem
plify "outstanding examples of
academic programs that lead to
student success."
While Stanford's number-one
ranking in service learning is an ac -
complishment that should be rec
ognized, Cruz expressed concern
in directing too much attention at
the numbers.
"1 am very gratified to have
today's service learning at Stan
ford express a continuity with its
founding vision to serve the pub
lic welfare," Cruz said. "But 1
must admit to some unease about
focusing on this ranking, without
giving equal, 01 more attention,
to why public service is critical.
"The intractable social issues of
our times require dedication and
skills commensurate with their
complexity and urgency — the
needs of the world, not a ranking,
should keep pushing us to raise
the bar higher."

earning courses as well as in ex
tracurricular service activities,"
Cruz said.
Cruz attributed Stanford's suc
cess in service learning to "a com
pelling team effort among many
parts of the University — faculty
leadership and practice of service
learning, student passion for so
cial responsibility, administrative
commitment of necessary finan
cial resources, and staff dedica
tion to providing an infrastruc

ture that 'brokers' partnerships
among the campus, community
groups and the broader govern
ment and public sector."
Stanford shares its number-one
ranking in service learning with
the University of Pennsylvania
and Berea College, an institution
which, according to Cruz, puts
service at the core of its mission.
"With our much larger size
and complexity [compared to
Berea College], I feel it is remark
able that service learning has
been institutionalized at Stanford
to a degree that would earn the
number-one ranking," Cruz said.
Service learning was one of the
eight types of programs identi
fied by the magazine. Stanford
was also ranked in the top five in
first-year experiences, senior
capstone and undergraduate re
search / creative projects.
Introduced for the first time
this year by U.S. News, this rank

ing includes schools that exem
plify "outstanding examples of
academic programs that lead to
student success."
While Stanford's number-one
ranking in service learning is an ac -
complishment that should be rec
ognized, Cruz expressed concern
in directing too much attention at
the numbers.
"1 am very gratified to have
today's service learning at Stan
ford express a continuity with its
founding vision to serve the pub
lic welfare," Cruz said. "But 1
must admit to some unease about
focusing on this ranking, without
giving equal, 01 more attention,
to why public service is critical.
"The intractable social issues of
our times require dedication and
skills commensurate with their
complexity and urgency — the
needs of the world, not a ranking,
should keep pushing us to raise
the bar higher."
Each fall, high school seniors
and parents await the release of
U.S. News and World Report's list
of America's Best Colleges. While
many members of the Stanford
community may be aware that
Stanford landed in the number
four overall spot for National Uni
versities— Doctoral in the 2003
rankings, few may have noticed
that the University was ranked
number one in the country in ser
vice learning.
U.S. News defined service
learning as programs in which
"volunteering in the community is
an instructional strategy - a re
quirement of a student's course
work. The service informs what
happens in class, and vice versa."
At the core of service learning at
the University is the Haas Center
for Public Service at Stanford,
which "promotes, organizes and
supports public and community
service by members of the Stan

ford community," according to its
mission statement.
"'The Haas Center gives visible,
collective expression to the
breadth and depth of community
and public service carried out by
Stanford students, faculty and
staff," said Nadinne Cruz, director
of the Haas Center.
According to Kent Koth, ser
vice-learning program coordina
tor at the Haas Center, "The staff
and students at the Haas Center
for Public Service and other public
service advocates on campus have
chosen to define service learning
very broadly. We understand ser
vice learning . . . to encapsulate a
variety of programs."
The Haas Center is home to a
number of types of programs, in
cluding: staff-led programs, such
as the Ravenswood Reads Tutor
ing Program and Stanford in
Washington; staff-facilitated pro
grams, including Alternative
Spring Break and Stanford in
Government; partner programs,
including the Institute for Diversi
ty in the Arts and the Dr. and Mrs.
C.J. Huang Teaching Fellowship
in China; and nearly 40 student or
ganizations, including East Palo
Alto Tennis and Tutoring and
Women and Youth Supporting
Each Other.
"Service learning offers an im
portant means for Stanford stu
dents to help address the needs of
the local community and grapple
with the intractable social issues of
the contemporary era," Koth said.
"Perhaps most importantly, ser
vice learning helps students devel
op skills fora lifetime of civic en
gagement."
In addition, Haas Center staff
provided curricular assistance to

faculty who are teaching service
learning courses. 1 his year, .'V4 fac
ulty members from If) departments
are offering 47 service-learning
courses. Winter-quarter courses in
clude Political Science 221: Urban
Policy and Urban Studies 120:
Building Community.
"We apply the pedagogical
principles of rigorous service
learning — learning from struc

tracurricular service activities,"
Cruz said.
