American Activism Coalition, ex
plained that such visible exam
ples of activism at Stanford con
tinued throughout the early 70s.
Some students protested the war
effort in Vietnam; others pressed
the University administration for
the establishment of an African
and African American Studies
Program. This program was es
tablished in 1969, several months
after the BSU intervention.
In the mid-90s, an estimated
1,500 students rallied to protest
the verdict in the Rodney King
case. Some businesses in Palo Alto
even feared rioting, according to
the Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford account of the
demonstration. The organiza
tion's Web site explains that
"Stanford students had decided
to show their anger in front of
Copeland's Sports, which was the
only store on University Avenue
to board up its windows, an act
which most students found
tremendously offensive."
And in 1998, students founded
the Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion in order to protest what it
perceived as unfair working con
ditions on campus. The coalition
has achieved notoriety in the past
few years for its vocal protests
against subcontracting and
against low wages and poor work
ing conditions for food-service
workers on campus.
The work of current activist
groups notwithstanding, some
students maintain that Stanford's
rich history of activism is a dying
tradition.

Is activism
dead at
Stanford?
"I've only
been here three
and a half
years," Pangu
luri said. "But I
have seen ac
tivism become
rarer and more
concentrated in
specific groups
of people, espe
cially political
activism."
Robin Coop
er, a graduate
student in soci
ology, said she

has witnessed consistently low
turnout at most graduate-student
protests.
"I know that the graduate stu
dents organized a protest on the
Oval the summer before I arrived
in 1998 to address the grad-student
housing situation," Cooper said.
"Via recounts of the experi
ences of other grad students in
my department, the showing was
weak at best. I also know that last
year, a grad student in our de
partment organized a protest of
sorts that was addressed to the
government on the issue of their
presence in Afghanistan, but the
showing at that event was, once
again, weak."
However, not all members of
the University community agree
with assessments that pronounce
current campus activist efforts
dead on arrival.
There have been a number of
protests staged in recent years on

the University campus.
Late last May, there was a two
day campout protest in the Quad
as students expressed their oppo
sition to the wages that Bon Ap
petit workers receive.
Students told The Daily that
they would not leave the Quad
until the administration took no
tice of their grievances.
Also, last April, a number of
Stanford students very well might
have influenced a decision by
Abercrombie 8c Fitch to remove t
shirt designs that were deemed
offensive to Asians.
"A number of us, 60 or 70 or
so, sent in letters and phoned the
main office," explained Lily
Peng, a sophomore. "Within 48
hours or so, Abercrombie 8c Fitch
announced that they were going
to remove the offensive apparel
from their Web site and would
not sell it. I think our protest on
the student level largely influ
enced that move."
Anna Mumford, a sophomore
and Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion coordinator, discussed how
she thinks activism is evolving.
"I do feel that the knowledge
base of activist organizations is in
creasing as organizations gain
more experience with grassroots
organizing," Mumford said.
"This experience is helpful in
gathering momentum for cam
paigns and in guiding them so
they are highly effective."
Mumford pointed out as well
that activism at Stanford is only
one part of the activist movement
as a whole.
"The student labor movement
is clearly growing as a national
and even international issue,"
Mumford said. " The labor ac
tivism at Stanford is only a small

part of the large global picture."
Administration, students do not
see decline in activism
Dean of Students Marc Wais
explained that he has not person
ally witnessed a decline in on
campus activism.
"Over the years, Stanford stu
dents have always been active re
garding issues they feel passion
ate about," Wais said.
Li seconded Wais' sentiment,
agreeing that students are rela
tively involved in activist move
ments today.
"1 would say that infrastruc
ture is pretty well-established
now, though always being threat
ened," Li said. "As far as labor,
the campaigns recently surpass
anything I've heard about."
University President John
Hennessy, while acknowledging
active involvement by students,
underscored the point that par

ticipation levels vary over time.
"Students have always been in
volved in a variety of issues facing
this community and the country,"
Hennessy said. "Over the years
this has varied from the Vietnam
War, to civil rights, to South
African apartheid, to support for
farm workers. Some issues have
raised a greater level of concern
and participation than today, and
some less."
While the jury is still out about
whether activism on campus is at
a peak or a trough, it seems that
most students and faculty agree
that the level of campus political
action has waxed and waned
throughout Stanford's history.
Perhaps a more telling and im
portant question is: What causes
such variation?
Why do activism
levels fluctuate?
Li described activism on cam
pus as a cycle defined by periodic
fluctuations of activity.
"It was a very different time
back [in the late 60s and early
70s]," Li said. "It also seems like
there was a burst of activity in the
late 1980s and early 19905."
Tom Hanada, a sophomore
and founding member of Allied
Students for Unity, pointed out
that activism on any given cam
pus does not occur in a vacuum.
"I think a given level of ac
tivism at any specific time is large
ly a function of its contemporary
societal context," Hanada said.
"But why was the Korean War
so widely ignored, while the Viet
nam War was a point of con
tention at campuses across the
country? The revelation in the
Vietnam War effort was of the
body bags piling up, with news

video capturing each death. War
looked a lot different in the 60s
than in the 50s.
"The American public's —
and students' — sensibilities are
relatively constant. What mostly
changes over time is our percep
tion and understanding of the re
ality of a situation. This is what I
feel causes the variances in ac
tivism from decade to decade or
generation to generation," Hen
nessy continued.
Some students contended that
ideas of right and wrong can
change with time. A student who
wished to remain anonymous ex
pressed how he feels American
values have changed.
"Look at the race issue," said
the student. "It is pretty obvious
that some moral or something
has to have changed. Fora race to
go from being enslaved, to overt
ly discriminated against, and
then to being economically and

socially discriminated against —
while the latter is still bad, it is bet
ter and reflects a change in the
point of view of the public. It is a
slow and tedious progression."
Other students argued that ac
tivism is dependent on the mag
nitude of the issues facing the
Stanford community.
"I feel that when controversial
issues come up, the outcry is
greater," said Jason Horn, a
sophomore. "It makes sense:
With more at stake, more activist
action will occur."
Gains can stunt activist activity
Hanada also explained how
great gains in a movement can
usher in a period of apathy.
"From what I have seen in the
past, such as in the civil rights
movement, support for activist
movements tends to die down —
not increase — after large gains
or concessions are obtained from
opposing parties," Hanada said.
"Such a process is exhausting,
and tends to deplete the energy
of those who enacted such
change, leading to a push then by
the status quo to reduce the
gains, and opposite pressure is
then applied, starting the pattern
of gravitating once again toward
the middle."
Aside from generational dif
ferences or disparities in the
"controversial" natures of differ
ent subjects, another critical fac
tor at play in determining ac
tivism levels may be the guidance
and input of organizations exter
nal to the University.
What role do external activist
groups play?
According to Mumford, Stan
ford activist groups often utilize

off-campus groups as resources
in furthering their goals.
"As far as SLAC is concerned,
we are definitely working to in
crease solidarity between our
selves and other outside organi
zations, particularly student
labor organizing groups from
other campuses," Mumford said.
"We collaborate with the United
States Student Association, Stu
dent Labor Action Project and we
have received guidance from the
organizers of Harvard's success
ful living-wage campaign."
Li disagreed that outside
groups have a significant effect
on campus movements.
"I don't see many connections
between on-campus and 'outside'
labor groups," Li said. "Students
on campus may work with unions
representing workers on campus,
but that's hardly an 'outside'
labor group."
Calvin Miaw, a senior and

leader for the Stanford Commu
nity for Peace and Justice, ex
plained that his group frequently
consults extra-campus organiza
tions for assistance.
"I know that SCPJ is working
with the Peninsula Peace and Jus
tice Center, as well as other orga
nizations, on a teach-in on the
possible war with Iraq," Miaw
said. "We've also worked with a
San Jose group working on legis
lation threatening the jobs of im
migrant airport screeners . . . .

Much of this was done in coalition
with other organizations."
What about the administration?
Another important actor in ac
tivist movements is the University
administration itself, which has
the power to control demonstra
tions and protests. But what is its
role in all of this?
Wais said he often works with
campus groups to make sure that
their activism is constructive —
not destructive.
"As Dean of Students, my pri
mary role is to serve as an educa
tor — informing students of Uni
versity policies and expectations
regarding organized protests ar
ticulated through Stanford's
Campus Disruption policy," Wais
said. "Within this context, I also
inform students of what possible
consequences might be should
they violate University policies or
regulations."

Wais stressed that the Univer
sity supports activism and does
not intentionally seek to suppress
its practice on campus.
"As an educational institution,
Stanford firmly supports the
rights of its students to express
their viewpoints through protest
on issues," Wais said.
"These protests should be con
ducted in a responsible and
thoughtful way that does not pre
vent or disrupt any other Univer
sity function or activity and re-

spects the
rights of other
individuals."
Hennessy
agreed with
Wais 1 statement
concerning the
University's
policy toward
activism, and
noted that he
somet i me s
serves as a me
diator in situa
tions of campus
activism.
"[My role]
depends a great
deal on what the
issue is," Hen
nessy said. "In

the case of the hospital workers, I
have no direct influence, since the
hospital is a separately managed
entity. I did try to ensure that the
students received a fair hearing of
their concerns by the parties em
powered to make the decision."
Activist doesn't 'allow grave in
justices to pass by unnoticed'
While it is impossible to quan
tify the exact level of activism cur
rently present on-campus, it ap
pears that the general agreement
among students and faculty is
that Stanford students are pre
pared to make their voice heard
when necessary. Junior Adam
Haas explained what he feels is
the general on-campus approach
toward activism.
"We say what we feel, when we
think that we need to say it" Haas
said. "We don't split hairs, but we
don't allow grave injustices to
pass by unnoticed, either."

In the spring of 2001, student groups opposed to the proposed merger of the
six non-English language literature departments and students concerned
about a perceived downgrading of the importance of ethnic centers formed
an alliance to protest the University's actions.

and founding member of Allied
Students for Unity, pointed out
that activism on any given cam
pus does not occur in a vacuum.
"I think a given level of ac
tivism at any specific time is large
ly a function of its contemporary
societal context," Hanada said.
"But why was the Korean War
so widely ignored, while the Viet
nam War was a point of con
tention at campuses across the
country? The revelation in the
Vietnam War effort was of the
body bags piling up, with news

video capturing each death. War
looked a lot different in the 60s
than in the 50s.
"The American public's —
and students' — sensibilities are
relatively constant. What mostly
changes over time is our percep
tion and understanding of the re
ality of a situation. This is what I
feel causes the variances in ac
tivism from decade to decade or
generation to generation," Hen
nessy continued.
Some students contended that
ideas of right and wrong can
change with time. A student who
wished to remain anonymous ex
pressed how he feels American
values have changed.
"Look at the race issue," said
the student. "It is pretty obvious
that some moral or something
has to have changed. Fora race to
go from being enslaved, to overt
ly discriminated against, and
then to being economically and

socially discriminated against —
while the latter is still bad, it is bet
ter and reflects a change in the
point of view of the public. It is a
slow and tedious progression."
Other students argued that ac
tivism is dependent on the mag
nitude of the issues facing the
Stanford community.
"I feel that when controversial
issues come up, the outcry is
greater," said Jason Horn, a
sophomore. "It makes sense:
With more at stake, more activist
action will occur."
Gains can stunt activist activity
Hanada also explained how
great gains in a movement can
usher in a period of apathy.
"From what I have seen in the
past, such as in the civil rights
movement, support for activist
movements tends to die down —
not increase — after large gains
or concessions are obtained from
opposing parties," Hanada said.
"Such a process is exhausting,
and tends to deplete the energy
of those who enacted such
change, leading to a push then by
the status quo to reduce the
gains, and opposite pressure is
then applied, starting the pattern
of gravitating once again toward
the middle."
Aside from generational dif
ferences or disparities in the
"controversial" natures of differ
ent subjects, another critical fac
tor at play in determining ac
tivism levels may be the guidance
and input of organizations exter
nal to the University.
What role do external activist
groups play?
According to Mumford, Stan
ford activist groups often utilize

off-campus groups as resources
in furthering their goals.
"As far as SLAC is concerned,
we are definitely working to in
crease solidarity between our
selves and other outside organi
zations, particularly student
labor organizing groups from
other campuses," Mumford said.
"We collaborate with the United
States Student Association, Stu
dent Labor Action Project and we
have received guidance from the
organizers of Harvard's success
ful living-wage campaign."
Li disagreed that outside
groups have a significant effect
on campus movements.
"I don't see many connections
between on-campus and 'outside'
labor groups," Li said. "Students
on campus may work with unions
representing workers on campus,
but that's hardly an 'outside'
labor group."
Calvin Miaw, a senior and

leader for the Stanford Commu
nity for Peace and Justice, ex
plained that his group frequently
consults extra-campus organiza
tions for assistance.
"I know that SCPJ is working
with the Peninsula Peace and Jus
tice Center, as well as other orga
nizations, on a teach-in on the
possible war with Iraq," Miaw
said. "We've also worked with a
San Jose group working on legis
lation threatening the jobs of im
migrant airport screeners . . . .

Much of this was done in coalition
with other organizations."
What about the administration?
Another important actor in ac
tivist movements is the University
administration itself, which has
the power to control demonstra
tions and protests. But what is its
role in all of this?
Wais said he often works with
campus groups to make sure that
their activism is constructive —
not destructive.
"As Dean of Students, my pri
mary role is to serve as an educa
tor — informing students of Uni
versity policies and expectations
regarding organized protests ar
ticulated through Stanford's
Campus Disruption policy," Wais
said. "Within this context, I also
inform students of what possible
consequences might be should
they violate University policies or
regulations."

Wais stressed that the Univer
sity supports activism and does
not intentionally seek to suppress
its practice on campus.
"As an educational institution,
Stanford firmly supports the
rights of its students to express
their viewpoints through protest
on issues," Wais said.
"These protests should be con
ducted in a responsible and
thoughtful way that does not pre
vent or disrupt any other Univer
sity function or activity and re-

spects the
rights of other
individuals."
Hennessy
agreed with
Wais 1 statement
concerning the
University's
policy toward
activism, and
noted that he
somet i me s
serves as a me
diator in situa
tions of campus
activism.
"[My role]
depends a great
deal on what the
issue is," Hen
nessy said. "In

the case of the hospital workers, I
have no direct influence, since the
hospital is a separately managed
entity. I did try to ensure that the
students received a fair hearing of
their concerns by the parties em
powered to make the decision."
Activist doesn't 'allow grave in
justices to pass by unnoticed'
While it is impossible to quan
tify the exact level of activism cur
rently present on-campus, it ap
pears that the general agreement
among students and faculty is
that Stanford students are pre
pared to make their voice heard
when necessary. Junior Adam
Haas explained what he feels is
the general on-campus approach
toward activism.
"We say what we feel, when we
think that we need to say it" Haas
said. "We don't split hairs, but we
don't allow grave injustices to
pass by unnoticed, either."

MICHAEL RIEMENSCHNEIDER/The Stanford Daily File
In the spring of 2001, student groups opposed to the proposed merger of the
six non-English language literature departments and students concerned
about a perceived downgrading of the importance of ethnic centers formed
an alliance to protest the University's actions.
American Activism Coalition, ex
plained that such visible exam
ples of activism at Stanford con
tinued throughout the early 70s.
Some students protested the war
effort in Vietnam; others pressed
the University administration for
the establishment of an African
and African American Studies
Program. This program was es
tablished in 1969, several months
after the BSU intervention.
In the mid-90s, an estimated
1,500 students rallied to protest
the verdict in the Rodney King
case. Some businesses in Palo Alto
even feared rioting, according to
the Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford account of the
demonstration. The organiza
tion's Web site explains that
"Stanford students had decided
to show their anger in front of
Copeland's Sports, which was the
only store on University Avenue
to board up its windows, an act
which most students found
tremendously offensive."
And in 1998, students founded
the Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion in order to protest what it
perceived as unfair working con
ditions on campus. The coalition
has achieved notoriety in the past
few years for its vocal protests
against subcontracting and
against low wages and poor work
ing conditions for food-service
workers on campus.
The work of current activist
groups notwithstanding, some
students maintain that Stanford's
rich history of activism is a dying
tradition.

Is activism
dead at
Stanford?
"I've only
been here three
and a half
years," Pangu
luri said. "But I
have seen ac
tivism become
rarer and more
concentrated in
specific groups
of people, espe
cially political
activism."
Robin Coop
er, a graduate
student in soci
ology, said she

has witnessed consistently low
turnout at most graduate-student
protests.
"I know that the graduate stu
dents organized a protest on the
Oval the summer before I arrived
in 1998 to address the grad-student
housing situation," Cooper said.
"Via recounts of the experi
ences of other grad students in
my department, the showing was
weak at best. I also know that last
year, a grad student in our de
partment organized a protest of
sorts that was addressed to the
government on the issue of their
presence in Afghanistan, but the
showing at that event was, once
again, weak."
However, not all members of
the University community agree
with assessments that pronounce
current campus activist efforts
dead on arrival.
There have been a number of
protests staged in recent years on

the University campus.
Late last May, there was a two
day campout protest in the Quad
as students expressed their oppo
sition to the wages that Bon Ap
petit workers receive.
Students told The Daily that
they would not leave the Quad
until the administration took no
tice of their grievances.
Also, last April, a number of
Stanford students very well might
have influenced a decision by
Abercrombie 8c Fitch to remove t
shirt designs that were deemed
offensive to Asians.
"A number of us, 60 or 70 or
so, sent in letters and phoned the
main office," explained Lily
Peng, a sophomore. "Within 48
hours or so, Abercrombie 8c Fitch
announced that they were going
to remove the offensive apparel
from their Web site and would
not sell it. I think our protest on
the student level largely influ
enced that move."
Anna Mumford, a sophomore
and Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion coordinator, discussed how
she thinks activism is evolving.
"I do feel that the knowledge
base of activist organizations is in
creasing as organizations gain
more experience with grassroots
organizing," Mumford said.
"This experience is helpful in
gathering momentum for cam
paigns and in guiding them so
they are highly effective."
Mumford pointed out as well
that activism at Stanford is only
one part of the activist movement
as a whole.
"The student labor movement
is clearly growing as a national
and even international issue,"
Mumford said. " The labor ac
tivism at Stanford is only a small

part of the large global picture."
Administration, students do not
see decline in activism
Dean of Students Marc Wais
explained that he has not person
ally witnessed a decline in on
campus activism.
"Over the years, Stanford stu
dents have always been active re
garding issues they feel passion
ate about," Wais said.
Li seconded Wais' sentiment,
agreeing that students are rela
tively involved in activist move
ments today.
"1 would say that infrastruc
ture is pretty well-established
now, though always being threat
ened," Li said. "As far as labor,
the campaigns recently surpass
anything I've heard about."
University President John
Hennessy, while acknowledging
active involvement by students,
underscored the point that par

ticipation levels vary over time.
"Students have always been in
volved in a variety of issues facing
this community and the country,"
Hennessy said. "Over the years
this has varied from the Vietnam
War, to civil rights, to South
African apartheid, to support for
farm workers. Some issues have
raised a greater level of concern
and participation than today, and
some less."
While the jury is still out about
whether activism on campus is at
a peak or a trough, it seems that
most students and faculty agree
that the level of campus political
action has waxed and waned
throughout Stanford's history.
Perhaps a more telling and im
portant question is: What causes
such variation?
Why do activism
levels fluctuate?
Li described activism on cam
pus as a cycle defined by periodic
fluctuations of activity.
"It was a very different time
back [in the late 60s and early
70s]," Li said. "It also seems like
there was a burst of activity in the
late 1980s and early 19905."
Tom Hanada, a sophomore
and founding member of Allied
Students for Unity, pointed out
that activism on any given cam
pus does not occur in a vacuum.
"I think a given level of ac
tivism at any specific time is large
ly a function of its contemporary
societal context," Hanada said.
"But why was the Korean War
so widely ignored, while the Viet
nam War was a point of con
tention at campuses across the
country? The revelation in the
Vietnam War effort was of the
body bags piling up, with news

video capturing each death. War
looked a lot different in the 60s
than in the 50s.
"The American public's —
and students' — sensibilities are

tivism from decade to decade or

ly discriminated against, and
then to being economically and

socially discriminated against —
while the latter is still bad, it is bet

point of view of the public. It is a
slow and tedious progression."
Other students argued that ac
tivism is dependent on the mag
nitude of the issues facing the
Stanford community.
"I feel that when controversial
issues come up, the outcry is
greater," said Jason Horn, a
sophomore. "It makes sense:
With more at stake, more activist
action will occur."

Hanada also explained how
great gains in a movement can
usher in a period of apathy.

In the spring of 2001, student groups opposed to the proposed merger of the
six non-English language literature departments and students concerned
about a perceived downgrading of the importance of ethnic centers formed
an alliance to protest the University's actions.
American Activism Coalition, ex
plained that such visible exam
ples of activism at Stanford con
tinued throughout the early 70s.
Some students protested the war
effort in Vietnam; others pressed
the University administration for
the establishment of an African
and African American Studies
Program. This program was es
tablished in 1969, several months
after the BSU intervention.
In the mid-90s, an estimated
1,500 students rallied to protest
the verdict in the Rodney King
case. Some businesses in Palo Alto
even feared rioting, according to
the Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford account of the
demonstration. The organiza
tion's Web site explains that
"Stanford students had decided
to show their anger in front of
Copeland's Sports, which was the
only store on University Avenue
to board up its windows, an act
which most students found
tremendously offensive."
And in 1998, students founded
the Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion in order to protest what it
perceived as unfair working con
ditions on campus. The coalition
has achieved notoriety in the past
few years for its vocal protests
against subcontracting and
against low wages and poor work
ing conditions for food-service
workers on campus.
The work of current activist
groups notwithstanding, some
students maintain that Stanford's
rich history of activism is a dying
tradition.

Is activism
dead at
Stanford?
"I've only
been here three
and a half
years," Pangu
luri said. "But I
have seen ac
tivism become
rarer and more
concentrated in
specific groups
of people, espe
cially political
activism."
Robin Coop
er, a graduate
student in soci
ology, said she

has witnessed consistently low
turnout at most graduate-student
protests.
"I know that the graduate stu
dents organized a protest on the
Oval the summer before I arrived
in 1998 to address the grad-student
housing situation," Cooper said.
"Via recounts of the experi
ences of other grad students in
my department, the showing was
weak at best. I also know that last
year, a grad student in our de
partment organized a protest of
sorts that was addressed to the
government on the issue of their
presence in Afghanistan, but the
showing at that event was, once
again, weak."
However, not all members of
the University community agree
with assessments that pronounce
current campus activist efforts
dead on arrival.
There have been a number of
protests staged in recent years on

the University campus.
Late last May, there was a two
day campout protest in the Quad
as students expressed their oppo
sition to the wages that Bon Ap
petit workers receive.
Students told The Daily that
they would not leave the Quad
until the administration took no
tice of their grievances.
Also, last April, a number of
Stanford students very well might
have influenced a decision by
Abercrombie 8c Fitch to remove t
shirt designs that were deemed
offensive to Asians.
"A number of us, 60 or 70 or
so, sent in letters and phoned the
main office," explained Lily
Peng, a sophomore. "Within 48
hours or so, Abercrombie 8c Fitch
announced that they were going
to remove the offensive apparel
from their Web site and would
not sell it. I think our protest on
the student level largely influ
enced that move."
Anna Mumford, a sophomore
and Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion coordinator, discussed how
she thinks activism is evolving.
"I do feel that the knowledge
base of activist organizations is in
creasing as organizations gain
more experience with grassroots
organizing," Mumford said.
"This experience is helpful in
gathering momentum for cam
paigns and in guiding them so
they are highly effective."
Mumford pointed out as well
that activism at Stanford is only
one part of the activist movement
as a whole.
"The student labor movement
is clearly growing as a national
and even international issue,"
Mumford said. " The labor ac
tivism at Stanford is only a small

part of the large global picture."
Administration, students do not
see decline in activism
Dean of Students Marc Wais
explained that he has not person
ally witnessed a decline in on
campus activism.
"Over the years, Stanford stu
dents have always been active re
garding issues they feel passion
ate about," Wais said.
Li seconded Wais' sentiment,
agreeing that students are rela
tively involved in activist move
ments today.
"1 would say that infrastruc
ture is pretty well-established
now, though always being threat
ened," Li said. "As far as labor,
the campaigns recently surpass
anything I've heard about."
University President John
Hennessy, while acknowledging
active involvement by students,
underscored the point that par

ticipation levels vary over time.
"Students have always been in
volved in a variety of issues facing
this community and the country,"
Hennessy said. "Over the years
this has varied from the Vietnam
War, to civil rights, to South
African apartheid, to support for
farm workers. Some issues have
raised a greater level of concern
and participation than today, and
some less."
While the jury is still out about
whether activism on campus is at
a peak or a trough, it seems that
most students and faculty agree
that the level of campus political
action has waxed and waned
throughout Stanford's history.
Perhaps a more telling and im
portant question is: What causes
such variation?
Why do activism
levels fluctuate?
Li described activism on cam
pus as a cycle defined by periodic
fluctuations of activity.
"It was a very different time
back [in the late 60s and early
70s]," Li said. "It also seems like
there was a burst of activity in the
late 1980s and early 19905."
Tom Hanada, a sophomore
and founding member of Allied
Students for Unity, pointed out
that activism on any given cam
pus does not occur in a vacuum.
"I think a given level of ac
tivism at any specific time is large
ly a function of its contemporary
societal context," Hanada said.
"But why was the Korean War
so widely ignored, while the Viet
nam War was a point of con
tention at campuses across the
country? The revelation in the
Vietnam War effort was of the
body bags piling up, with news

video capturing each death. War
looked a lot different in the 60s
than in the 50s.
"The American public's —
and students' — sensibilities are
relatively constant. What mostly
changes over time is our percep
tion and understanding of the re
ality of a situation. This is what I
feel causes the variances in ac
tivism from decade to decade or
generation to generation," Hen
nessy continued.
Some students contended that
ideas of right and wrong can
change with time. A student who
wished to remain anonymous ex
pressed how he feels American
values have changed.
"Look at the race issue," said
the student. "It is pretty obvious
that some moral or something
has to have changed. Fora race to
go from being enslaved, to overt
ly discriminated against, and
then to being economically and

socially discriminated against —
while the latter is still bad, it is bet
ter and reflects a change in the
point of view of the public. It is a
slow and tedious progression."
Other students argued that ac
tivism is dependent on the mag
nitude of the issues facing the
Stanford community.
"I feel that when controversial
issues come up, the outcry is
greater," said Jason Horn, a
sophomore. "It makes sense:
With more at stake, more activist
action will occur."
Gains can stunt activist activity
Hanada also explained how
great gains in a movement can
usher in a period of apathy.
"From what I have seen in the
past, such as in the civil rights
movement, support for activist
movements tends to die down —
not increase — after large gains
or concessions are obtained from
opposing parties," Hanada said.
"Such a process is exhausting,
and tends to deplete the energy
of those who enacted such
change, leading to a push then by
the status quo to reduce the
gains, and opposite pressure is
then applied, starting the pattern
of gravitating once again toward
the middle."
Aside from generational dif
ferences or disparities in the
"controversial" natures of differ
ent subjects, another critical fac
tor at play in determining ac
tivism levels may be the guidance
and input of organizations exter
nal to the University.
What role do external activist
groups play?
According to Mumford, Stan
ford activist groups often utilize

off-campus groups as resources
in furthering their goals.
"As far as SLAC is concerned,
we are definitely working to in
crease solidarity between our
selves and other outside organi
zations, particularly student
labor organizing groups from
other campuses," Mumford said.
"We collaborate with the United
States Student Association, Stu
dent Labor Action Project and we
have received guidance from the
organizers of Harvard's success
ful living-wage campaign."
Li disagreed that outside
groups have a significant effect
on campus movements.
"I don't see many connections
between on-campus and 'outside'
labor groups," Li said. "Students
on campus may work with unions
representing workers on campus,
but that's hardly an 'outside'
labor group."
Calvin Miaw, a senior and

leader for the Stanford Commu
nity for Peace and Justice, ex
plained that his group frequently
consults extra-campus organiza
tions for assistance.
"I know that SCPJ is working
with the Peninsula Peace and Jus
tice Center, as well as other orga
nizations, on a teach-in on the
possible war with Iraq," Miaw
said. "We've also worked with a
San Jose group working on legis
lation threatening the jobs of im
migrant airport screeners . . . .

Much of this was done in coalition
with other organizations."
What about the administration?
Another important actor in ac
tivist movements is the University
administration itself, which has
the power to control demonstra
tions and protests. But what is its
role in all of this?
Wais said he often works with
campus groups to make sure that
their activism is constructive —
not destructive.
"As Dean of Students, my pri
mary role is to serve as an educa
tor — informing students of Uni
versity policies and expectations
regarding organized protests ar
ticulated through Stanford's
Campus Disruption policy," Wais
said. "Within this context, I also
inform students of what possible
consequences might be should
they violate University policies or
regulations."

Wais stressed that the Univer
sity supports activism and does
not intentionally seek to suppress
its practice on campus.
"As an educational institution,
Stanford firmly supports the
rights of its students to express
their viewpoints through protest
on issues," Wais said.
"These protests should be con
ducted in a responsible and
thoughtful way that does not pre
vent or disrupt any other Univer
sity function or activity and re-

spects the
rights of other
individuals."
Hennessy
agreed with
Wais 1 statement
concerning the
University's
policy toward
activism, and
noted that he
somet i me s
serves as a me
diator in situa
tions of campus
activism.
"[My role]
depends a great
deal on what the
issue is," Hen
nessy said. "In

the case of the hospital workers, I
have no direct influence, since the
hospital is a separately managed
entity. I did try to ensure that the
students received a fair hearing of
their concerns by the parties em
powered to make the decision."
Activist doesn't 'allow grave in
justices to pass by unnoticed'
While it is impossible to quan
tify the exact level of activism cur
rently present on-campus, it ap
pears that the general agreement
among students and faculty is
that Stanford students are pre
pared to make their voice heard

Haas explained what he feels is

said. "We don't split hairs, but we
don't allow grave injustices to

Hennessy said. "Over the years
this has varied from the Vietnam
War, to civil rights, to South
African apartheid, to support for
farm workers. Some issues have
raised a greater level of concern
and participation than today, and
some less."
While the jury is still out about
whether activism on campus is at
a peak or a trough, it seems that
most students and faculty agree
that the level of campus political
action has waxed and waned
throughout Stanford's history.
Perhaps a more telling and im
portant question is: What causes
such variation?
Why do activism
levels fluctuate?
Li described activism on cam
pus as a cycle defined by periodic
fluctuations of activity.
"It was a very different time
back [in the late 60s and early
70s]," Li said. "It also seems like
there was a burst of activity in the
late 1980s and early 19905."
Tom Hanada, a sophomore
and founding member of Allied
Students for Unity, pointed out
that activism on any given cam
pus does not occur in a vacuum.
"I think a given level of ac
tivism at any specific time is large
ly a function of its contemporary
societal context," Hanada said.
"But why was the Korean War
so widely ignored, while the Viet
nam War was a point of con
tention at campuses across the
country? The revelation in the
Vietnam War effort was of the
body bags piling up, with news

video capturing each death. War
looked a lot different in the 60s
than in the 50s.
"The American public's —
and students' — sensibilities are
relatively constant. What mostly
changes over time is our percep
tion and understanding of the re
ality of a situation. This is what I
feel causes the variances in ac
tivism from decade to decade or
generation to generation," Hen
nessy continued.
Some students contended that
ideas of right and wrong can
change with time. A student who
wished to remain anonymous ex
pressed how he feels American
values have changed.
"Look at the race issue," said
the student. "It is pretty obvious
that some moral or something
has to have changed. Fora race to
go from being enslaved, to overt
ly discriminated against, and
then to being economically and

socially discriminated against —
while the latter is still bad, it is bet
ter and reflects a change in the
point of view of the public. It is a
slow and tedious progression."
Other students argued that ac
tivism is dependent on the mag
nitude of the issues facing the
Stanford community.
"I feel that when controversial
issues come up, the outcry is
greater," said Jason Horn, a
sophomore. "It makes sense:
With more at stake, more activist
action will occur."
Gains can stunt activist activity
Hanada also explained how
great gains in a movement can
usher in a period of apathy.
"From what I have seen in the
past, such as in the civil rights
movement, support for activist
movements tends to die down —
not increase — after large gains
or concessions are obtained from
opposing parties," Hanada said.
"Such a process is exhausting,
and tends to deplete the energy
of those who enacted such
change, leading to a push then by
the status quo to reduce the
gains, and opposite pressure is
then applied, starting the pattern
of gravitating once again toward
the middle."
Aside from generational dif
ferences or disparities in the
"controversial" natures of differ
ent subjects, another critical fac
tor at play in determining ac
tivism levels may be the guidance
and input of organizations exter
nal to the University.
What role do external activist
groups play?
According to Mumford, Stan
ford activist groups often utilize

off-campus groups as resources
in furthering their goals.
"As far as SLAC is concerned,
we are definitely working to in
crease solidarity between our
selves and other outside organi
zations, particularly student
labor organizing groups from
other campuses," Mumford said.
"We collaborate with the United
States Student Association, Stu
dent Labor Action Project and we
have received guidance from the
organizers of Harvard's success
ful living-wage campaign."
Li disagreed that outside
groups have a significant effect
on campus movements.
"I don't see many connections
between on-campus and 'outside'
labor groups," Li said. "Students
on campus may work with unions
representing workers on campus,
but that's hardly an 'outside'
labor group."
Calvin Miaw, a senior and

leader for the Stanford Commu
nity for Peace and Justice, ex
plained that his group frequently
consults extra-campus organiza
tions for assistance.
"I know that SCPJ is working
with the Peninsula Peace and Jus
tice Center, as well as other orga
nizations, on a teach-in on the
possible war with Iraq," Miaw
said. "We've also worked with a
San Jose group working on legis
lation threatening the jobs of im
migrant airport screeners . . . .

Much of this was done in coalition
with other organizations."
What about the administration?
Another important actor in ac
tivist movements is the University
administration itself, which has
the power to control demonstra
tions and protests. But what is its
role in all of this?
Wais said he often works with
campus groups to make sure that
their activism is constructive —
not destructive.
"As Dean of Students, my pri
mary role is to serve as an educa
tor — informing students of Uni
versity policies and expectations
regarding organized protests ar
ticulated through Stanford's
Campus Disruption policy," Wais
said. "Within this context, I also
inform students of what possible
consequences might be should
they violate University policies or
regulations."

Wais stressed that the Univer
sity supports activism and does
not intentionally seek to suppress
its practice on campus.
"As an educational institution,
Stanford firmly supports the
rights of its students to express
their viewpoints through protest
on issues," Wais said.
"These protests should be con
ducted in a responsible and
thoughtful way that does not pre
vent or disrupt any other Univer
sity function or activity and re-

spects the
rights of other
individuals."
Hennessy
agreed with
Wais 1 statement
concerning the
University's
policy toward
activism, and
noted that he
somet i me s
serves as a me
diator in situa
tions of campus
activism.
"[My role]
depends a great
deal on what the
issue is," Hen
nessy said. "In

the case of the hospital workers, I
have no direct influence, since the
hospital is a separately managed
entity. I did try to ensure that the
students received a fair hearing of
their concerns by the parties em
powered to make the decision."
Activist doesn't 'allow grave in
justices to pass by unnoticed'
While it is impossible to quan
tify the exact level of activism cur
rently present on-campus, it ap
pears that the general agreement
among students and faculty is
that Stanford students are pre
pared to make their voice heard
when necessary. Junior Adam
Haas explained what he feels is
the general on-campus approach
toward activism.
"We say what we feel, when we
think that we need to say it" Haas
said. "We don't split hairs, but we
don't allow grave injustices to
pass by unnoticed, either."

In the spring of 2001, student groups opposed to the proposed merger of the
six non-English language literature departments and students concerned
about a perceived downgrading of the importance of ethnic centers formed
an alliance to protest the University's actions.
