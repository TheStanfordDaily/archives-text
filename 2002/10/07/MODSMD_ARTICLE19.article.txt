# Alliance works to build community

### DAVID BLACKMAN 
Stanford's Queer Straight So
cial and Political Alliance was
founded hist year to foster a posi
tive community for both queer and
queer-allied students.
The group held its first meet
ing at 9 p.m. yesterday in El
Centro Chicano. The alliance
plans to have meetings weekly at
the same time and place for the
rest of the year.
The alliance was founded by se
nior Jesse Evans and junior Caro
line Hopper as a way to increase
visibility for the Lesbian Gay Bisex
ual Transgender community at
Stanford.
According to the Hopper,
there wasn't a problem with dis
crimination or homophobia on
campus; instead, founding the
group was a way to create a more
unified community, as well as to

"foster political activism" with re
gard to the LGBT community.
The QSSPA is a non-exclusive
organization, open to those of all
sexual orientations. Hopper
said that, although the group
does not ask whether students
are queer 01 straight, she be
lieves that the straight member
ship of the group is about equal
to those identifying as queer.
The group asked that Daily re
porters not attend meetings in
their official capacity because, as
stated on its Web site, "at any
QSSPA social event we feel it is im
perative that: People who attend
not disclose who they have seen at
QSSPA events, [and | everyone's af
filiation should be as confidential as
they'd like it to be."
The alliance also holds to a tenet
of'never asking about sexual orien
tation at any QSSPA event.
At the first meeting, the group

worked to organize some of the so
cial events and parties that the
QSSPA plans. The alliance is plan
ning to have a party once a month
and a social event every two weeks.
Its next event will be a social gath
ering on Oct. 10, at 10 p.m. at the
LGBT-CRC, on the eve of Nation
al Coming Out Day.
Evans said that the group's
next party — still in the planning
stages — is slated for Nov. 2.
These group events serve as a
meeting place for the communi
ty, as well as a place to be among
queer-friendly people.
The group is finishing a sur
vey started last year, dealing
with the needs of the queer and
queer-friendly community at
Stanford. The results will be up
dated on the group's Web site
throughout the year.
Stanford and the Bay Area in
general are reputedly very friend

ly towards the queer community.
But while Hopper said that it is a
"constant battle to light homopho
bia and assumptions about the
queer community," most of the
Stanford community is very open
and accepting.
This year the group plans to
work to unify the community and
increase its visibility. Members
have already passed out signs
saying "I support queer rights,"
and plan to fly gay-pride flags
during National Coming Out
Day. lbe alliance occasionally
flies banners in White Plaza, and
overall tries to "create a friendly,
open atmosphere" for students
of all sexual orientations.
QSSPA meetings, parties and
scx ial events are free, with funding
comingfrom both the LGBT-CRC
and the ASSU. The group is allied
with the LGBT-CRC but remains
independent.
