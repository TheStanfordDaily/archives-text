Football
Saturday: No. 8 Notre Dame 31, Stanford 7

For 40 minutes on Saturday, the Stan
ford football team (1-3) stared right back
at its former head coach.
I he Cardinal did not blink in the first
half, becoming the first team this season
to hold a halftime lead over the No. 8
Fighting Irish (5-0). The Cardinal de
fense played by far its best half of the year,
guiding Stanford to a 7-3 lead at the mid
way mark.
In the end, however, Stanford ran out
of tricks and averted its gaze, and Notre
Dame exploded for four touchdowns in
just six minutes spanning the third and
fourth quarters en route to a 31-7 victory.
Notre Dame's Ryan Grant and Rashon
Powers-Neal both ran for 100 yards, and
defensive backs Shane Watson and
Courtney Watson had interception re
turns for touchdowns that were separated

by only 24 seconds in the third quarter.
It was a shocking meltdown by the Car
dinal, which seemed to be on the verge of
turning its season around.
"They threw everything they had at us
in the first half," Notre Dame's Courtney
Watson said. "We knew they couldn't beat
us doing what they wanted to do."
The Cardinal had a hand in its own de
struction, as its running game stalled and
quarterback Chris Lewis fell victim to an
increasingly effective Irish pass rush.
Lewis threw interceptions on three con
secutive second-half drives as the vaunted
Irish secondary regained its customary
aggressiveness after a quiet first half.
"[The Irish defense] scored more
points than our offense, so congrats," said
sophomore wide receiver Teyo Johnson.
"You can't give away two touchdowns
when we have the ball on offense. We
helped them win."
The Cardinal got off to a solid start, as
its defense kept Notre Dame out of the
red zone in the first half despite defend
ing a short field most of the time.
Notre Dame's Nick Setta and Stanford
freshman Michael Sgroi traded missed
field goals in the first period, as Stanford
exploited Notre Dame's failure to cover
senior fullback Casey Moore coming out
of the backfield.

Late in the first quarter, junior Eric
Johnson punted the ball, and Vontez
I)uff scampered 92 yards to the end zone
on the return for the Irish, only to have
(he play called back fora roughing-the
center penalty.
The Cardinal, which had seen more
than its share of bad breaks in its 65-24 loss
to Arizona State the week before, made
sure it capitalized on its good fortune.
Sophomore Nick Sebes gained 21 yards
on a trick play, and Lewis found Johnson
fora 14-yard touchdown with 46 seconds
remaining in the opening quarter.
Johnson's score was the first offen
sive touchdown allowed by Notre Dame
all season.
The Irish continued to play mistake
ridden football. Gary Godsey dropped an
easy 30-yard pass on the next drive that
would've brought the Irish near the end
zone. Later, Notre Dame quarterback Fat
Dillingham fumbled the ball fora loss of
15 yards after being hit by senior defen
sive tackle Matt Leonard, pushing the
Irish out of scoring position.
Stanford struggled too, though, as
it never got its running game going,
and Lewis had a hard time finding his
receivers.
