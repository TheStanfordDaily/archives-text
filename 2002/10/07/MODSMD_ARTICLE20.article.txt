Football
Saturday: No. 8 Notre Dame 31, Stanford 7

For 40 minutes on Saturday, the Stan
ford football team (1-3) stared right back
at its former head coach.
I he Cardinal did not blink in the first
half, becoming the first team this season
to hold a halftime lead over the No. 8
Fighting Irish (5-0). The Cardinal de
fense played by far its best half of the year,
guiding Stanford to a 7-3 lead at the mid
way mark.
In the end, however, Stanford ran out
of tricks and averted its gaze, and Notre
Dame exploded for four touchdowns in
just six minutes spanning the third and
fourth quarters en route to a 31-7 victory.
Notre Dame's Ryan Grant and Rashon
Powers-Neal both ran for 100 yards, and
defensive backs Shane Watson and
Courtney Watson had interception re
turns for touchdowns that were separated

by only 24 seconds in the third quarter.
It was a shocking meltdown by the Car
dinal, which seemed to be on the verge of
turning its season around.
"They threw everything they had at us
in the first half," Notre Dame's Courtney
Watson said. "We knew they couldn't beat
us doing what they wanted to do."
The Cardinal had a hand in its own de
struction, as its running game stalled and
quarterback Chris Lewis fell victim to an
increasingly effective Irish pass rush.
Lewis threw interceptions on three con
secutive second-half drives as the vaunted
Irish secondary regained its customary
aggressiveness after a quiet first half.
"[The Irish defense] scored more
points than our offense, so congrats," said
sophomore wide receiver Teyo Johnson.
"You can't give away two touchdowns
when we have the ball on offense. We
helped them win."
The Cardinal got off to a solid start, as
its defense kept Notre Dame out of the
red zone in the first half despite defend
ing a short field most of the time.
Notre Dame's Nick Setta and Stanford
freshman Michael Sgroi traded missed
field goals in the first period, as Stanford
exploited Notre Dame's failure to cover
senior fullback Casey Moore coming out
of the backfield.

Late in the first quarter, junior Eric
Johnson punted the ball, and Vontez
I)uff scampered 92 yards to the end zone
on the return for the Irish, only to have
(he play called back fora roughing-the
center penalty.
The Cardinal, which had seen more
than its share of bad breaks in its 65-24 loss
to Arizona State the week before, made
sure it capitalized on its good fortune.
Sophomore Nick Sebes gained 21 yards
on a trick play, and Lewis found Johnson
fora 14-yard touchdown with 46 seconds
remaining in the opening quarter.
Johnson's score was the first offen
sive touchdown allowed by Notre Dame
all season.
The Irish continued to play mistake
ridden football. Gary Godsey dropped an
easy 30-yard pass on the next drive that
would've brought the Irish near the end
zone. Later, Notre Dame quarterback Fat
Dillingham fumbled the ball fora loss of
15 yards after being hit by senior defen
sive tackle Matt Leonard, pushing the
Irish out of scoring position.
Stanford struggled too, though, as
it never got its running game going,
and Lewis had a hard time finding his
receivers.

Senior fullback Casey Moore and the Stanford football team didn't have much room to run in a
31-7 loss to Notre Dame on Saturday afternoon in South Bend, Ind.
Notre Dame got on the board
and closed out the first half scoring
with a 30-yard field goal by Setta.
The Irish started the second half
inauspiciously as Godsey let a pass
gooffhis hands and into the waiting
arms of sophomore Oshiomgho
Atogwe, who ran the interception
back. 26 yards.
Stanford, which managed just
61 rushing yards on 30 carries,
stalled before it could get within
striking distance. The Irish came
back once again but the Ail-Ameri
can Setta, who finished l-for-4 on
the clay, missed a 38-yarder.
"We were not playing smart foot
ball," Willingham said. "We
could've had a few scores [already]."
It was then that the Irish turned
it around, as Chris Lewis, unable to

get rid of the ball, was sacked by
Darrell Campbell on the 5-yard
line. Stanford's ensuing punt led to
a short two-minute drive ending
with Powers-Neal's 3-yard touch
down run, which finally got the
home team on top.
"I think that was what really sep
arated the game," Willingham said.
"You could just tell that there was a
surge in energy."
Having surrendered the lead, it
would not be long before the Cardi
nal surrendered the game.
On the second pass of the fol
lowing possession, Lewis tried to
find Johnson. As Lewis got hit
from behind, Shane Watson
stepped in front of Johnson for
an interception that lie returned
fora touchdown. It was Notre
Dame's fifth defensive touch
down and Watson's fifth pick of
the year. The pass was Lewis's
10th consecutive incompletion, a
fact which did not bode well for

the Cardinal's comeback c hances.
On the next drive, Courtney
Watson literally ripped the ball out
of sophomore tight end Alex
Smith's hands and rumbled 34
yards for another defensive score,
giving Notre Dame a 24-7 lead with
1:09 left in the third quarter.
The third time was not the
charm for Stanford, either, as
Gerome Sapp intercepted Lewis at
midfield. Subsequently, Grant
struck paydirt from one yard out
with 12:28 left in the game for the
final 31-7 advantage.
The Cardinal did not win, but it
certainly picked it up from the Ari
zona State game, and came away
with a less-stunning defeat this time.
"We stayed pretty positive
throughout the game," senior run
ning back Kerry Carter said. "No
body hung their heads. They just
had a couple key turnovers that
changed the momentum and got
them rolling."
