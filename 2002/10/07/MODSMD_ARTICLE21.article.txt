ing words.

FOOTBALL NOTEBOOK

"I have a lot of reject for the
young men at Stanford," Willing
ham said. "We expect a certain
type of play from those young
men. I want them to pick it up as
they go through the year."
Stanford fans have to be en
couraged by the Cardinal's
showing in the first two and a
half quarters. The offense didn't
turn the ball over once and man
aged to find the end zone against
one of the toughest defenses in
America. The secondary only
gave up one deep ball all game,
and the pass rush looked down
right fearsome at times in the
first half.
What separated Notre Dame
from Stanford in the end was not
talent or desire.
Stanford made a lot of big
plays but only netted one offen
sive touchdown out of it all;
Notre Dame made a slew of er
rors and managed to grind out

only two offensive touchdowns
against a defense that had been
yielding 41.3 points per game en
tering the contest.
It doesn't really even seem fair
that week after week Notre Dame
runs a conservative, ball-control
offense and rides its defense and
special teams' big plays to victory,
because Stanford seems to work so
hard for everything. But attitude
reflects preparation and experi
ence as well.
"They don't seem to get
spooked or panic when things
aren't going their way," head
coach Buddy Teevens said of
Notre Dame.
Notre Dame knows it can stop
the other team's plays, so of course
it can focus on how to turn those
plays around and make them
worth points going the other way.
Stanford's defense doesn't have
the luxury of such thinking; it still
has much work to do before it can
become the aggressor on the field.
"Execution, we had 30 minutes
of it, and I wish we had 60,"
Teevens said.
But there were flashes of
what lies within the Cardinal's
immensely talented, though ex
ceedingly young, defense. The
defensive line and linebackers
did well, forcing Notre Dame to
keep the ball on the ground
and holding Irish quarterback
Pat Dillingham to a mere 129

yards on 14-of-27 passing.
The secondary proved adept at
stopping the run, as sophomore
cornerback Leigh Torrence and
senior safety Colin Branch
stepped up in the first half against
running back Ryan Grant's re
peated attempts to beat the Cardi
nal to the perimeter.
Stanford's ballcarriers man
aged not to fumble the football
a single time, which is some
consolation to the turnover-ad
dled Teevens.
However, special teams con
tinue to be a problem, as junior
Eric Johnson got respectable dis
tance on most of his punts yet
saw Notre Dame total 56 yards
on six returns and Vontez Duff
break off a 42-yard kickoff re
turn on a tough day for Cardinal
kick coverage. Johnson had to
field a low snap on one would-be
punt, which forced him to roll
out looking to pass. His timely
completion to sophomore Alex
Smith went for minus-8 yards on
the stat sheet but saved about 15
on the field.
Meanwhile, Stanford's own re
turn game was anemic at best. Ju
nior Luke Powell was healthy
enough to return punts, but
couldn't find any holes, netting 11
yards. Senior Ryan Wells man

turns. Of his 12 returns this year,
the longest is only 22 yards.
"We allowed a lot of field posi
tion swings, which is something
we'll have to address at great
length," Teevens said.
Senior running back Kerry

Carter came back from injury and
gained a team-leading 35 yards on
just seven carries.
Junior Chris Lewis got the start
at quarterback and played every
down, looking pretty sharp most
of the time.
However, in the second half,
"pass protection broke down,"
Teevens admitted, as Lewis took
four sacks and was hurried into a
lot of bad decisions. His three-in

terception slide wasn't all his
fault, but one wonders if all the
time he's spent out of the lineup
this year, combined with a new of
fensive system, isn't a big part of
the problem.
With the win, Willingham be
came the first Irish coach to start
his career 5-0 since the leg
endary Ara Parseghian. For his
fifth win, Parseghian, too, de
feated Stanford.
