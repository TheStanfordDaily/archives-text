be hitting the top of the New
York Times suspense novels
best-sellers list by the end of the
week — although you'll have to
go to the horror section to find it
at the Stanford Bookstore.
A crowd of nearly 4,000 at
Maples Pavilion watched over two
and half hours of the most intense
volleyball the NCAA has had to
offer this year, a five-game
marathon that featured 14 match

points split evenly between the two
teams, and one unbelievable call
by the referee on one match point
that had, momentarily, won the
match for the Cardinal.
When the dust settled, the Tro
jans (12-0, 6-0 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) had taken the fifth game 24-
22 and about 3,800 Stanford fans
among the season-high crowd
were left wondering how what
they had just seen could have pos
sibly happened.
The final stats only confirm
their incredulity — Stanford (13-2,
4-1) decidedly outhit (.305-.218)
and outblocked (19-12) USC,
edged the Trojans in digs (79-78)
and held itself to only 20 hitting er
rors, nearly halving the 39 run up
by USC.
"In a word, that was a really
tough moment for us," said Stan
ford junior setter Anna Robinson,
who picked up a career-high 62 as
sists. "We know how well we
played, and we proved a lot to our
selves and to USC. We're going to
improve a lot from that game, and
we know we'll be better when we
face them again."
Stanford controlled play for
most of the night — for better or

lor worse. The Cardinal dominat
ed the Trojans when it was play
ing up to par bin self-destructed
several times during the match,
with untimely service errors and
occasional bouts of erratic passing
allowing USC to climb back into
the fray.
The Cardinal let sizable leads
slip away in three of the five games,
most notably in the fifth when
Stanford had five match points
with a 14-9 lead.
But then back-to-back ball-hit
ting errors by the Cardinal, two

kills by Trojan Ail-American Katie
Olsovsky and a pair of hitting er
rors by Stanford Ail-American se
nior outside hitter Logan Tom,
and the Cardinal's five match
points had given way to the Tro
jans' first shot at the match, with
USC suddenly leading 15-14.

Sophomore outside hitter Ogonna Nnamani takes a swing against USC Fri
day night. The No. 4 Stanford women's volleyball team came within a point
of downing the top-ranked Women of Troy, but eventually fell in five games.
The Cardinal rebounded from the loss by defeating UCLA on Saturday.
points, and back-to-back kills from
sophomore outside hitter Ogonna
Nnamani gave Stanford its sixth
match point at 19-18.
On the next point, USC got a
clean pass off Ivy's serve to setter
Tracy Lindquist, who set Lauren
Killian about a foot too far out on
the right side. Killian's kill at
tempt was well wide, and the Car
dinal thought the match was over,
storming the court to celebrate as
the Stanford Band broke into "All
Right Now." But the head referee

cut the party short, whistling
Nnamani for having touched the
net on the play — a marginal call
at best, especially given the cir
cumstances.
After two more missed USC
match points and a seventh failed
match point by the Cardinal, back
to-back kills by USC's Alicia Robin
son and a block by Robinson and
Olsovsky brought the affair to an
unthinkable closing for the Stan
ford faithful.
"Stanford did everything I
thought they could to stay on top
of us," USC coach Mick Haley said.
"It looked like they were going to
put us away in the fifth game, but
I'm so proud of my team fighting

through that.
"It was a war out there. That's
big-time athleticism. I can't imag
ine anyone who wouldn't have
wanted to see that tonight."
Stanford had dominated the
first game, crushing USC 30-23 be
hind a .424 hitting percentage
while holding the Trojans to a. 143
clip. The Cardinal blew late leads
in the next two games, dropping
the second 30-27 and holding on
in the third 30-28. The fourth
game was the only one that really
belonged to the Trojans, which
took advantage of sloppy back-row
play by Stanford to take an easy 30-
25 win.
"Matches like this don't com

pare to when it's the last match,
when you're done," said Stan
ford coach John Dunning.
"There's a lot of volleyball left to
play. There were moments
when we could've taken hold of
the match in the second game
and the fifth game and we
didn't, so there are some things
we need to learn. But what a
great volleyball match."
Tom led all attackers with 29
kills on top of a team-high 20 digs.
Six Trojans had double-digit kill
totals, in spite of ferocious Stan
lord blocking that forced USC to
take 42 more swings than the Car
dinal in the match.
How much the match took out

of both teams was evident on Sat
urday, when the Trojans barely
got by mediocre California (11-3,
2-3) 3-2 in Berkeley, and the Car
dinal had a tough time handling
an unimpressive UCLA squad in
four games at Maples.
Stanford was clearly a step slow
er against the No. 13 Bruins (10-6,
3-3), but UCLA was rarely able to
take advantage, allowing the Car
dinal to walk away with a 30-24,25-
30, 30-25, 30-22 win.
One of the few bright spots of
the night was Harvey's career-high
12 blocks, but by the end of the
match, the Cardinal just seemed
glad that the weekend's competi
tion was over.

"We had some mental lapses.
We weren't excited the whole
time," said Tom, one of four
Cardinal hitters with double
digits kills against the Bruins.
"It's hard to build momentum
when you don't have the tenaci
ty. Coming off the hard loss, it
would've been easy for the team
to fall down and have no energy,
and we showed a little of that.
But we played well at the times
we needed to, and we came out
with the win."
The Cardinal will travel to the
desert on Thursday to face off With
a surprisingly strong Arizona State
team before taking on No. 17 Ari
zona on Friday.
