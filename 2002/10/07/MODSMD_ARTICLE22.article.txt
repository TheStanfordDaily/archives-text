be hitting the top of the New
York Times suspense novels
best-sellers list by the end of the
week — although you'll have to
go to the horror section to find it
at the Stanford Bookstore.
A crowd of nearly 4,000 at
Maples Pavilion watched over two
and half hours of the most intense
volleyball the NCAA has had to
offer this year, a five-game
marathon that featured 14 match

points split evenly between the two
teams, and one unbelievable call
by the referee on one match point
that had, momentarily, won the
match for the Cardinal.
When the dust settled, the Tro
jans (12-0, 6-0 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) had taken the fifth game 24-
22 and about 3,800 Stanford fans
among the season-high crowd
were left wondering how what
they had just seen could have pos
sibly happened.
The final stats only confirm
their incredulity — Stanford (13-2,
4-1) decidedly outhit (.305-.218)
and outblocked (19-12) USC,
edged the Trojans in digs (79-78)
and held itself to only 20 hitting er
rors, nearly halving the 39 run up
by USC.
"In a word, that was a really
tough moment for us," said Stan
ford junior setter Anna Robinson,
who picked up a career-high 62 as
sists. "We know how well we
played, and we proved a lot to our
selves and to USC. We're going to
improve a lot from that game, and
we know we'll be better when we
face them again."
Stanford controlled play for
most of the night — for better or

lor worse. The Cardinal dominat
ed the Trojans when it was play
ing up to par bin self-destructed
several times during the match,
with untimely service errors and
occasional bouts of erratic passing
allowing USC to climb back into
the fray.
The Cardinal let sizable leads
slip away in three of the five games,
most notably in the fifth when
Stanford had five match points
with a 14-9 lead.
But then back-to-back ball-hit
ting errors by the Cardinal, two

kills by Trojan Ail-American Katie
Olsovsky and a pair of hitting er
rors by Stanford Ail-American se
nior outside hitter Logan Tom,
and the Cardinal's five match
points had given way to the Tro
jans' first shot at the match, with
USC suddenly leading 15-14.
A kill by Tom and blocks by se
nior outside hitter Ashley Ivy and
junior middle blocker Jenn Har
vey kept Stanford alive through
the first three Trojan match

Sophomore outside hitter Ogonna Nnamani takes a swing against USC Fri
day night. The No. 4 Stanford women's volleyball team came within a point
of downing the top-ranked Women of Troy, but eventually fell in five games.
The Cardinal rebounded from the loss by defeating UCLA on Saturday.
