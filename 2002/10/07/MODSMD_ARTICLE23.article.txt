Going into the first game of Fri

high on both sides for the seventh
all-time meeting between the two

Women's Soccer
Friday: No. 2 UNC 1, No. 1 Stanford 0
Yesterday: Stanford 3, Tulsa 0

schools, with UNC holding a 5-0-1
edge in the series. Number seven
wasn't especially lucky lor the Car
dinal, which fell to the l ar I leels,
1-0.
The Cardinal kept control of
the game for the initial 30 min
utes. The first good scoring op
portunity came in the 27th
minute, when senior midfielder
Callie Withers sent a header on
goal from a corner kick by junior
forward Marc ie Ward.
Following physical play around
inidfield and two good UNC
chances, Stanford again attacked
as freshman striker Jennifer
Farenbaugh sent a cross to Ward,

whose shot was tipped out by the
UNC keeper. Junior Allyson Mar
cjuand also had an open shot off
t lie ensuing corner kick but missed
the goal wide.
The final minutes of the half
displayed tough play on both
sides, as the far Heels pressured
Stanford's backline with speed
and physical play.
Just before halftime there was
some controversy about a non-call.
Farenbaugh was running onto a
through ball toward the UNC. goal
when the Far Heel keeper Aly
Winget ran out for the challenge.
After the challenge, which Winget
won, ii appeared that she had
been outside the penalty area
when she had grabbed the ball
from the- space above Farenbaugh
.though no call was made.
"You can't do anything about
that," Ward said. "That's the
game."
Stanford came out of halftime
going light at the UNC goal.
Ward fed senior striker Marcia
Wallis with at hrough ball to open
space in the penalty area but Wal
lis' shot ripped just left of the goal.
It was the story of the half for
the Cardinal — good chances just
missing the mark.
UNC presented a strong attack
and would have possibly scored
more goals had it not been 112 or ju
nior defender Alisan Pabon's
spectacular tackling in the penal
ty area.
The Cardinal kept pressure on
the Tar Heel defense but was un
able to get a steady attack going.
UNC shut down passing lanes and
kept its back line fairly deep, mak
ing it hard for the Cardinal to lead
its strikers into space.
The first and only goal of the
game came in the 60th minute as
the Tar Heels' Alyssa Ramsey
scored a superb goal. Assisted by
Lindsay Tarpley, Ramsey settled
the pass just in front of Pabon and
junior defender Natalie Spilger.
Though the defenders seemed to
be in perfect position, Ramsey
took time to set a screen, then
curled a shot around Spilger and
Pabon that slipped between the
diving Stanford keeper Nicole
Barnhart and the right post.
The Cardinal came right back
after the goal, as Wallis again had
an excellent chance a minute later
after a pass from junior Brittany
Oliveira. Again, Wallis' shot was
just wide.
Stanford appeared to increase
its offensive pressure as the second
half went on in search of an equal
izer. The 66th minute presented
another chance as Marquand took
a spot kick and lofted a ball to Wal
lis, who headed it on goal only to
have it tipped just wide.
Ward gave credit to Wallis for
her determination.
"It's hard. I know it looks easy
from the sidelines but with the
pressure of the defense and a
great goalie, it's hard," Ward

said. "[Wallis] had great runs and
great shots."
In the 70th minute, the Cardi
nal again sent a series of shots on
goal, the most notable of which was
sophomore Natalie Sanderson's
header, which bounced off the
crossbar and over the goal.
Increased offensive presence
may have left the Cardinal defense
stranded, but strong defensive
play and timely saves by Barnhart
kept the Tar Heels from marking
again. The Tar Heel defense
proved just as hard to crack, how
ever, and even with frantic pres
sure in the final minutes, the Car
dinal was unable to find the equal
izer before time expired.
"I thought we competed very

well," said co-coach Stephanie
Erickson. "But they got one, and
we didn't."
Overall, the Cardinal left the
game looking to learn from its mis
takes, already preparing to face
the Tar Heels again, possibly in the
NCAA Tournament.
"I think a result — an undesired
result — is a good perspective to
learn," Erickson said. "I think we
really learned where we can break
down, and we'll fix that. And they
got a taste of a feeling they really
don't want to feel again, and I don't
think that's a bad thing."
Adversity, they say, makes a
team stronger. This certainly ap
peared to be the case yesterday as
the Cardinal took the field again

against Tulane and defeated the
Green Wave 3-0.
The Cardinal wasted no time
getting started, scoring its first goal
in the second minute off the foot of
Ward, with assists from Oliveira
and Farenbaugh.
Farenbaugh would score a goal
of her own just eight minutes later
off of an assist from senior Becky
Myers. That was more than the
Cardinal would need as the de
fense held the Green Wave from
scoring to give Barnhart her sev
enth shutout of the season.
The Cardinal added its final
goal just 20 seconds before lime
expired, as Sanderson took a cor
ner kick and sent it past the Tu
lane keeper.
