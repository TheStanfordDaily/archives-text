# 'Destined' runners prevail in Indiana

### ERIK SPERLING STAFF WRITER 
There is a joke that instead of the
"Cardinal," Stanford's mascot should
be "Manifest Destiny," in reference to
the great westward expansion din
ing which Leland Stanford made his
fortune.

Women's Cross Country
Friday: Notre Dame Invitational
1. Stanford 21; 2. Wisconsin 67; 3.
Notre Dame 77

If this was indeed the scenario, it
would have been appropriate for
the Stanford women runners at the
Notre Dame Invitational in South
Bend, Ind., last Friday since No. 2
Stanford was as unstoppable as the
wagon trains rolling west. The Car
dinal finished first to clinch its
third straight victory of the year.
And when heavy rains, which
had pounded the course in the
morning, decided to let up right be
fore the race, it was as if the clouds
above Notre Dame were aware of
Stanford's "Manifest Destiny." Just
before the race was about to start,
t he clouds parted and allowed a sliv
er of sunlight to bathe the Stanford
team in a golden glow.
"It was raining all day before our
race," said sophomore Sara Bei.
"But as we stepped on the line, the
sun popped out. It was nice to run
in good weather, but I was kind of
looking forward to the rain. It's fun
to have those obstacles. But the rain
left plenty of mud on the course,
which was fun to run through."
Bei, who has not lost a race this
year, took her third individual title
of the season in a time of 16 min
utes, 48 seconds for 5,000 meters.
More ominous for the Cardinal's
competition, however, was that the
two runners finishing less than a
second behind Bei were her team

mates, senior Lauren Fleshman
and sophomore Alicia Craig.
After the Stanford trio, there was
a 15-second gap, a yawning chasm
in cross country, before Notre
Dame runner Molly Huddle
crossed the finish line in fourth.
Huddle was followed closely by an
other Stanford runner, senior Ma
lindi Elinore, who checked in at
17:10.
"We took the lead and con
trolled the race pretty much from
the beginning," Bei said. "Lau
ren, Alicia and I were able to run
evenly but aggressively together
in a pack and gradually broke
away from Molly Huddle. We fin
ished together, and it was exciting
to enter the finishing stretch as a
team."
fhe No. 2 Cardinal amassed 21
points for the win, only slightly
above a perfect score of 15. Sopho
more Anita Siraki (10th, 17:54),
freshman Kristin Cohoon (25th,
18:16) and senior Katie Hotchkiss
(56th, 18:38) rounded out the Stan
lord team.
"Malindi and Anita ran really
competitive races and were crucial
in our team victory," Bei said.
"Our team as a whole is shaping
up well. It's going to be a really ex
citing season."
I he closest rivals to Stanford
were Wisconsin (67 points) and
Notre Dame (77). While both teams
had good packs near the front of the
race, they lacked the depth of the
Stanford squad.
'fhe win continued the string of
victories by the Cardinal, which
has included first-place finishes at
the Cal State-Fullerton Invitation
al on Aug. 31, and the 6,000-meter
and 4,000-meter races at the Stan
ford Invitational on Sept. 28. Stan
ford squad will next see action at
the pre-NCAA meet at Indiana
State on Oct. 19.
