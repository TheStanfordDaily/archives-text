# Runners continue hot streak

### EMIL MARTINSEK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After morning rain and three large races, the cross
country course on the Burke Memorial Golf Course at
Notre Dame was a disaster for the men's Blue Division
race. 1 he grass was matted or ripped out, and the mud
caused treacherous looting.
But Stanford sophomore Ryan Hall never missed a
step en route to his second commanding victory in as
many races.

Men's Cross Country
Friday: Notre Dame Invitational
1. Stanford 33; 2. Michigan 80; 3. Notre Dame 118

Hall's victory helped lead the No. 1 Cardinal to the
team title. Despite running without four returning track
and cross country Ail-Americans, the squad finished
with only 33 points, comfortably ahead of No. 25 Michi
gan's 80 and No. 23 Notre Dame's 118.
With a surge in the middle of the race, Hall separat
ed from the lead pack that included teammate Don
Sage, a junior, and Notre Dame's Todd Mobley. He ran
die remainder of the 8,000-meter course alone, finish
ing in 24 minutes, 10 seconds.
After a track season hampered by injuries, Hall
looked to be back in control, as his smooth stride and
confident running again carried him past his opponents
in a seemingly effortless fashion.
Following Hall to the finish line, Sage kicked late to
pass Mobley and Belmont's William Kemey to claim sec
ond at 24:20 in his first race of the year.
Sage is the top returning runner from last year's na

tional runner-up team. He placed seventh at die NCAA
Championships to claim All-America honors.
Also debuting this weekend was returning All-Amer
ican junior Louis Luchini, who helped the Cardinal to
victory with a fifth-place finish in 24:30.
Sophomore Chris Emme (9th, 24:42) and senior
Seth Hejny (16th, 24:54) finished out the scoring for the
Stanford squad.
Also competing for the Cardinal this weekend
were redshirt freshmen Neil Davis (17th, 24:58) and
Justin Romaniuk (20th, 25:06) and sophomore
Robert Smitson (25th, 25:17). Smitson is a recent
transfer from Duke, where he was a member of the
Blue Devils' 14th-place squad at the NCAA Champi
onships last year.
Junior Steve Loughlin was the only Cardinal runner
in the open race, finishing sixth in 25:47.
While the Cardinal was dominating the field at
Notre Dame, No. 2 Arkansas displayed its own
strength. On a mission to claim its fourth title in five
years, the Razorbacks bested the No. 2 team in Divi
sion If, Abilene Christian, at the Cowboy Jamboree In
vitational. Stanford and Arkansas are not slated to
meet until this year's NCAA Championships.
In preparation to defend its top ranking and
claim its third national title, part of the Stanford
men's team will head to the Arizona State Invita
tional on Friday.
The remainder of the team will be preparing for
the Cardinal's most challenging race yet at the Pre-
NCAA meet, which will be held on the national cham
pionship course in Terre Haute, Ind., on Oct. 19. The
majority of the nationally-ranked programs are ex
pected to compete.
