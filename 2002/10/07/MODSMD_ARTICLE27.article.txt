### BRIAN DOYLE 
The Stanford women's golf team
lx*gins its second tournament of the
season today at The Edean Ih
lanfeldt Invitational, hosted by the
University of Washington in Taco
ma, Wash. The Cardinal is coming
off a disappointing debut at the
Mason Rudolph Championships in
Tennessee, and will look to build on
the solid individual performances of
junior Kim Kouwabunpat and se

nior Kim Rowton.
This year's tournament field is
largely comprised of Pacific-10 C Con
ference schools, including UCLA,
California and Southern California,
which won the tournament when it
was last held in 2000. Absent from
the field are last year's Pac-10 cham
pion Arizona, which finished sec
ond at the Mason Rudolph.

Tacoma, Wash., Today thai Wednesday

Rowton, will be joined by freshman
Kelly Husted, sophomore Wendra
Liang and junior Angela Rho.
In I lusted, Liang and Rho, there
is good reason to be optimistic.
Husted's debut saw a solid result
from the former high-school star
from Florida, Liang is due to break
through in her first year of regular
action, and Rho played extremely
well as a freshman the last time the
tournament was held, placing sixth
after carding a 224. The team's only
regular lost to graduation was Sal
imah Mussani.
To place well this week, the Stan
ford women will have to outplay a
very competitive field. Host Wash
ington enters the tournament with an
excellent chance of winning the tour
nament, having recently tied for sec
ond in the Comcast-Dick McGuire
Invitational, and climbing to ninth in
the Ck>lfweek collegiate rankings. Just
behind the Huskies is the team they
tied in that tournament — Pepper
dine—which is led by the top-ranked
individual golfer in the country, se
nior Katherine I lull.
No. 16 USC', led by first team .All-
American Mikaela Parmlid,can also
be expected to make a good show
ing. A deep UCLA team also might
make a run for the title.
Stanford head coach Caroline
O'Connor will be relying heavily on
Rowton and Kouwabunpat to pace
the Cardinal. Rowton now has three
full years of experience after a re
markable junior year in which she
notched seven top-25 finishes and
led the Cardinal with a 74.7 stroke
average. Kouwabunpat enjoyed a
very promising freshman cam
paign, during which she established
herself as one of the team's best.
Rowton and Kouwabunpat have
proven themselves capable of shoot
ing in the 60s. With consistent
rounds from both, Stanford might
be well on its way to a good result
and some valuable momentum.
