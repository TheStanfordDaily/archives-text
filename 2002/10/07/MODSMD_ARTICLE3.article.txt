# Anti-war demonstrators converge on Union Square
## Group of Stanford students joins crowd calling for peace in the Middle East 
### ANTHONY HA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Thousands of people gathered in San Fran
cisco's Union Square yesterday at 2 p.m. to
protest the United States' proposed bombing of
Iraq. About 25 Stanford students — many of
them representing campus activism groups
such as the Stanford Community for Peace and
Justice and Students for Environmental Action
and Justice —joined over 5,000 attendees from
around the Bay Area.
Many of the students met in White Plaza yes
terday morning and took the Caltrain bus to the
rally, while others drove or arranged rides.
Among the sea of protesters and antiwar signs
were a banner declaring, "Stanford For [Peace
Symbol]" and the cardboard backing from a spi
ral notebook, on which was written "Stanford
Students Say No to War."
"This is clearly a war about oil, not terror
ism," said senior Sabrina Fernandez, a member
and former officer of SEAS. "If this was about
terrorism, if the administration wanted to get to
the root of terrorism, they'd be bombing Saudi
Arabia. Hut all the) want is to create a puppet
regime in Iraq, which will allow the U.S. to con

trol the country's oil."
She added, "I was really happy about the
turnout of Stanford students. I think that the
event was well-publicized on campus, particu
larly by the SCPJ at the Words Against War
event. It was nice to ride up with a bus of fellow
protesters, to get that sense of community."
The San Francisco protest was only one of
many across the United States, including
events in Los Angeles, Portland, Ore., and
Houston, Texas. The rally in New York City
reportedly attracted over 20,000 people. All of
the events were organized by the Not In Our
Name Project and were timed to occur on the
eve of the first anniversary of the initiation of
bombing of Afghanistan.
During the rally, Union Square was filled
with chanting, energetic crowds who spilled
over into neighboring streets. People crammed
the windows overlooking the rally from the
neighboring Macy's, some of them just curious,
others dangling an anti-war banner from the
roof until they were told by police to remove it.
At the rally's start, organizer Tanya Mayo ex
horted listeners to view this rally only as the be
ginning of a broader effort.
"We need to start the biggest, baddest anti-war
movement this world has ever seen," she said.

tance, which has been published in
the New York limes and other
newspapers.
The pledge begins: "We believe
that, as people living in the United
States, it is our responsibility to re
sist the injustices done by our gov
ernment, in our names. Not in our
name will you wage endless war;
there can be no more deaths, no
more transfusions of blood for oil."
Included in the program of
speeches and performances was a
talk by Riva Enteen, a representa
tive of the National Lawyers Guild.
She criticized the administration
of U.S. President George W. Bush
for what she described as its attack
on civil rights and disregard for
the constitutional separation of
powers.
The organizers also broadcast a
recorded statement from Mumia

Abu-Jamal, whose conviction for
the murder of police officer Daniel
Faulkner in 1981 has been widely
protested.
Abu-Jamal said that it was hyp
ocritical for the Bush administra
tion to wage a war using the justifi
cation of human rights, since it
supported many other govern
ments responsible for major
human-rights violations.
As the afternoon wore on, pro
testers slowly filtered out of the
square, and the rally reached its
end shortly after 5 p.m.
"This shows the growing ener
gy of the anti-war movement," said
senior Calvin Miaw, a co-coordina
tor of the SCPJ. "Even people who
come here and are already anti
war will get a different perspective
from all the speakers today.
"It's important for those of us
against war to understand the per
spectives of those with other opin
ions and to address their concerns,
especially because this will help us
understand our own opinions."

turnout of Stanford students. I think that the
event was well-publicized on campus, particu
larly by the SCPJ at the Words Against War
event. It was nice to ride up with a bus of fellow
protesters, to get that sense of community."
The San Francisco protest was only one of
many across the United States, including
events in Los Angeles, Portland, Ore., and
Houston, Texas. The rally in New York City
reportedly attracted over 20,000 people. All of
the events were organized by the Not In Our
Name Project and were timed to occur on the
eve of the first anniversary of the initiation of
bombing of Afghanistan.
During the rally, Union Square was filled
with chanting, energetic crowds who spilled
over into neighboring streets. People crammed
the windows overlooking the rally from the
neighboring Macy's, some of them just curious,
others dangling an anti-war banner from the
roof until they were told by police to remove it.
At the rally's start, organizer Tanya Mayo ex
horted listeners to view this rally only as the be
ginning of a broader effort.
"We need to start the biggest, baddest anti-war
movement this world has ever seen," she said.

tance, which has been published in
the New York limes and other
newspapers.
The pledge begins: "We believe
that, as people living in the United
States, it is our responsibility to re
sist the injustices done by our gov
ernment, in our names. Not in our
name will you wage endless war;
there can be no more deaths, no
more transfusions of blood for oil."
Included in the program of
speeches and performances was a
talk by Riva Enteen, a representa
tive of the National Lawyers Guild.
She criticized the administration
of U.S. President George W. Bush
for what she described as its attack
on civil rights and disregard for
the constitutional separation of
powers.
The organizers also broadcast a
recorded statement from Mumia

Abu-Jamal, whose conviction for
the murder of police officer Daniel
Faulkner in 1981 has been widely
protested.
Abu-Jamal said that it was hyp
ocritical for the Bush administra
tion to wage a war using the justifi
cation of human rights, since it
supported many other govern
ments responsible for major
human-rights violations.
As the afternoon wore on, pro
testers slowly filtered out of the
square, and the rally reached its
end shortly after 5 p.m.
"This shows the growing ener
gy of the anti-war movement," said
senior Calvin Miaw, a co-coordina
tor of the SCPJ. "Even people who
come here and are already anti
war will get a different perspective
from all the speakers today.
"It's important for those of us
against war to understand the per
spectives of those with other opin
ions and to address their concerns,
especially because this will help us
understand our own opinions."
