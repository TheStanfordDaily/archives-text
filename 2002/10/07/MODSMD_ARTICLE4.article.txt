# Fighting the system: A look at over 30 years of
## Activism on campus 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford has a reputation for
political apathy. When Stanford
students think of protests, they
think of our rival an hour to the
north. When reporters approach
students about protests, the nor
mal response of many — includ
ing one student who asked not to
be identified — is "Oh, so you're
writing an article about Berkeley."

Yet Stanford does have its own
distinctive history of student ac
tivism, from the famous "taking of
the mike" in 1968 to the living
wage protests of today.
What is activism anyway?
Srinivas Panguluri, a senior and
coordinator of Habitat for Hu
manity, seemed puzzled when
asked what he thought of activism
on campus.
"If vou could define 'activism'

for me, I could probably give you
better answers," Panguluri said.
"What is an 'activist group'?" he
continued.
The Merriam-Webster Dictio
nary defines "activism" as "a doc
trine or practice that emphasizes
direct vigorous action, especially
in support of or opposition to one
side of a controversial issue."
However, such an explanation
does not encompass the connota
tions that the term "activism" has
acquired in contemporary Ameri
can society.
Panguluri explained that he
tends to "prefer community ser
vice as a means of change."
Yet, according to the dictionary
definition, Habitat for Humanity
— which Panguluri explained is
leading an aggressive campaign
fighting for the rights of impover
ished individuals and families to
have housing — should fit right in
as an example of activism.
Confusion about the term itself
may partially underlie the pressing
question of whether — and if so,
why — campus activism levels have
appeared to fluctuate over time.
Activism in the past
One of the most memorable
events in the history of activism at
Stanford is the "taking of the mike"
protest, which occurred on April 8,
1968, a few days after Martin
Luther King, Jr. was assassinated.
Approximately 70 members of the
Black Student Union approached
the podium at a University function
while then-Provost Richard Lyman
was giving a speech on what Stan
ford planned to do to address the
problem of racism.
The students, upon "taking the
mike," issued ten demands con
cerning the resolution of race is
sues at the University. One of the
BSU's demands was for the Uni
versity to "become actively en
gaged in the hiring of minority
group faculty members," accord
ing to the April 8, 1968 issue of
The Stanford Daily. Protesting
that not enough real change was
taking place, BSU Chair Keni
Washington challenged Stanford
to "put your money and your ac
tion where your mouth is."
