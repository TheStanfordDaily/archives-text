# Overseas Studies expands offerings

### ALBERT LEUNG STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Overseas Studies Pro
gram has begun to expand its offerings.
Over the next few years, the University
plans to open new campuses and to ex
pand offerings at existing locations.
Increasing student interest has
prompted the program to evolve,
adding new programs - some of which
will be in the form of non-traditional cen
ters emphasizing particular disciplines.
"This year, we hope to provide op
portunities for more students by
opening up regular spring-quarter
programs in Florence, Moscow and
Paris," said Susan Christopher, acad
emic program officer for the Over
seas Studies Program.
"Our regular capacity in Florence is
35, in Moscow 25 and in Paris 50. Some
of those spots in Florence and Paris will
l>e filled by winter-quarter students who
choose to extend their stay into a second
or third quarter."
In Florence and Paris, students will

find that the spring-quarter course selec
tions will parallel those from the fall and
winter quarters, which consist of a di
verse collection of courses that span a
wide range of disciplines, including
many that fulfill departmental and gen
eral education requirements.
While the Florence and Paris pro
grams are more traditional in that
they offer a variety of courses span

ning several disciplines, the spring
quarter curriculum in Moscow is
emerging with a special theme that
focuses on central Asia and Islam.
"Russia has been heavily involved
in central Asia for more than 200
years and has developed the world
class academic school of Islamic Stud
ies," said Maxim Bratersky, the direc
tor of the Moscow program.
"Students will benefit not only from
classes taught by leading experts, but
from rich collections of texts and artifacts
gathered in Russian Museums. Russia
has a significant Islamic population, and
students will have an opportunity to visit
one of the traditionally Islamic areas of
Tatarstan â€”an autonomous republic
within Russian Federation."
The classes offered in Moscow will
complement each other and introduce
the different aspects of life in post-Soviet
Central Asia and the practice of Islam.
Students will have a chance to take acad
emic field trips to Tatarstan and Uzbek-
