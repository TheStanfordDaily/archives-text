## Runoff likely in Brazil elections 
### 
SAC) PAULO, Brazil (AP) —
Former union leader Luiz Inacio
Lula da Silva finished first in yes
terday's presidential election, par
tial official results showed, but was
headed fora runoff vote in his bid
to become Brazil's first leftist
leader in four decades.
With just over 45 percent of the
votes counted, Silva had 46.9 per
cent support followed by govern
ment-backed candidate Jose Serra
with 24.2 percent, according to the
Supreme Electoral Tribunal.
If he fails to win more than 50
percent support he will face the
second-place candidate in a runoff
vote on Oct. 27. Pre-election polls
indicated Silva would win a runoff
against Serra.
In third place was former Rio
state Gov. Anthony Garotinho
with 16.1 percent, followed by for
mer finance minister Giro Gomes
with 12.3 percent, according to the
tribunal.
Thousands of Silva's supporters
thronged Sao Paulo's main avenue
late yestyerday honking horns,
waving Hags and singing in antici
pation he would win. Authorities
said long lines and delays at com
puterized voting stations nation
wide was delaying the final tally.
But the enthusiasm of the street
party waned when people realized
Silva — popularly known as "Lula"

— would likely not win in the first
round.
"We prepared ourselves to
compete in the elections in the first
and the second round," Silva said
after hearing the results.
A big speaker on a truck sta
tioned on Sao Paulo's main avenue
called supporters "to keep mobi
lized and alert," warning the light
would not be over for three more
weeks. Reginaldo Luiz Locatelli,
wrapped up in red tlag of Silva's
Workers Party, said he was "some
what sorry."
"1 expected and outright victo
ry," said Locatelli, a 39-year-old
salesman at an electronic shop. "A
great deal of the population ex
pected an outright victory. But we
are now beginning the battle for
the runoff."
Nonetheless, he said, "I'm not
worried, because we will win."
The burly former lathe opera
tor's campaign fed on popular
frustration with an economic
downturn and years of free-mar
ket reforms that had failed to re
duce the social inequalities in Latin
America's largest nation.
He first rose to fame as a fire
brand labor leader who dared to
defy Brazil's 1964-85 military dic
tatorship. He lost his little finger in
a machine press. Unable to afford
private health care, he lost his first

wife in childbirth, further
strengthening his political views.
But in this, his fourth try at the
presidency, Silva has softened his
radical tone. He has promised to
honor Brazil's foreign debt and
implement no drastic economic
policy shifts. Analysts say he seems
more akin to Chile's pragmatic so
cialist President Ricardo Lagos
than to Venezuela's populist
leader Hugo Chavez.
"If he leads the country as he
led the unions, he will be a great
president," said Joao de Oliveira, a
54-year-old retired metalworker,
who voted in Silva's home district
of Sao Bernardo do Campo. "It is
time fora worker to lead a country
of workers."
Serra, of the governing Brazil
ian Social Democracy Party, was
hand-picked by outgoing Presi
dent Fernando Henrique Car
doso. Trained as economist, the
60-year-old served in Congress
and Senate before joining Car
doso's Cabinet.
As he voted yesterday, Serra
urged voters to cast a ballot for
"experience." He cautioned
Brazilians not to make "a leap into
the dark."
Voting was peaceful. Soldiers
were stationed in 10 states to guar
antee order and some 3,000 sol
diers reinforced the police force.
