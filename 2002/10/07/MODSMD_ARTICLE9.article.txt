# Cong, resolution on Iraq expected to pass
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Congressional
leaders said yesterday a resolution authoriz
ing war against Iraq, expected to pass with lit
tle dissent, will strengthen the U.S. hand at
the United Nations and increase pressure on
Saddam Hussein to disarm.
President Bush, after a weekend in Maine,
returned to the White House and prepared to
address the natjpn tonight from Cincinnati.
He was making the case against the Iraqi pres
ident on the one-year anniversary of the start
of bombing in Afghanistan.
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, who
has counseled caution in unilateral moves
against Saddam, said he will vote for the reso
lution but only after trying to make it more to
his liking.
A leading moderate Democrat suggested
Bush was winning broad Democratic sup
port for reasons of domestic politics as well

as concerns about Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction. Many Democrats opposed sim
ilar legislation that authorized the Persian
Gulf War waged by Bush's father in 1991,
and the party is still smarting from a per
ception as anti-war.
"I think we need to work to improve our
image on that score by taking a more aggres
sive posture with regard to Iraq, empowering
the president," Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana, a
leader of the centrist Democratic Leadership
Council, told "Fox News Sunday."
Bush requested a strong resolution that
would have given him a virtual free hand to
deal with Iraq's chemical and biological
weapons arsenals and its nuclear arms re
search program by removing Saddam.
Last week, a bipartisan group of lawmakers
went to the White House and endorsed a
somewhat narrower version. It would give

Bush broad authority to use force to enforce
relevant U.N. resolutions, with or without (he
cooperation of the United Nations.
Daschle suggested Bush would be more
likely to win the approval he has requested
from the U.N. Security Council if the case for
moving against Saddam were to rest on a con
gressional resolution.
A House vote is expected Wednesday or
Thursday, according to Speaker Dennis
Hasten, R-111. Daschle said Senate passage
should come by next week. Congress is get
ting ready to break for midterm elections.
Bush warned in his radio address Saturday
that "delay, indecision and inaction could lead
to massive and sudden horror" for the United
States. Aides said yesterday his Cincinnati
speech will answer lingering cjuestions about
why disarming Iraq is necessary, even by force
if required.
