### 
BOWIE, Md. (AP) — The Washington-area sniper
struck again yesterday, shooting and critically
wounding a 13-year-old boy as his aunt dropped him
off at school, authorities said.
The shooting of the gunman's youngest victim yet
heightened fear across the densely populated neigh
borhoods surrounding the nation's capital. Schools
kept youngsters indoors at recess and lunchtime, and
parents raced to pick up their children early under
the watchful eyes of police.
The child was shot once in the chest before the start
of classes at Benjamin Tasker Middle School and was in
critical but stable condition at Children's Hospital in
Washington. Doctors were optimistic he would survive.
"All of our victims have been innocent and de
fenseless, but now we're stepping over the line,"
Montgomery County Police Chief Charles Moose
said, tears streaming down his face. "Shooting a kid —
it's getting to be really, really personal now."
President Bush denounced the attacks as "coward
ly and senseless acts of violence" and pledged gov
ernment support to local authorities and schools.
Police say there have been no eyewitnesses and
precious little to go on. They have spoken of a single
sniper, but have not ruled out the possibility that
more than one person is involved.
The sniper has shot eight people since Wednes
day, killing six. Five died in Montgomery County
within five miles of each other, and the sixth died on
a Washington street.
The latest attack was 20 miles farther east, in neigh
boring Prince George's County north of Washington.
Ballistics tests found the bullet that struck the boy
was identical to those that killed some of the others
and wounded a woman in Virginia, said Joe Riehl, an
agent with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms.
