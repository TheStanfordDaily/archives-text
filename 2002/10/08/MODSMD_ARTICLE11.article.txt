## The
						Stanford Daily Ending Presidential Scholars program not a bad idea 
### 
Published Since 1891

Stanford's President's Scholars program
will be placed on hold next year, a change
that may become permanent . An effort to
tighten the University's budget, coupled
with the notion that Stanford may have out
grown the program, has led the University to
decide that the money might be better spent
elsewhere. We support the University's decision
to discontinue the program, at least temporari
ly, as long as the displaced funds are used for un
dergraduate research.
The President's Scholars program promises
$3,000 grants to 200 admitted freshmen every
year. It was initiated eight years ago by ex-Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper and James Mon
toya, then-Dean of Admissions. At the time, un
dergraduate research opportunities were quite
limited, especially for underclassmen, and Stan
ford was still establishing a foothold among its Ivy
League peers. The President's Scholars program
accomplished two goals: It gave incoming stu
dents the opportunity to pursue their intellectual
interests and offered an incentive for some of the

strongest admitted students to attend Stanford.
Since then, the situation has changed consider
ably. The University has enjoyed a steady climb
into the ranks of its more established peers. More
students are applying to Stanford, and the Admis
sions Office is becoming more selective. Dangling
the President's Scholar carrot is no longer neces
sary to attract the most qualified students.
But more importantly, the University's com
mitment to undergraduate research has led to far
more opportunities than existed at the program's
inception. The Freshman and Sophomore Semi
nars and Sophomore College programs have
opened up new learning opportunities for
younger students, while exposing them to leading
scholars in several fields.
The Vice Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion program, developed last year, has set aside
even more money for students to work closely with
faculty members.
Meanwhile, the effect of the President's Schol
ars program has been questionable. Of the 200
students promised gi ants last year, 46 percent

joined this year's freshman class — representing a
lower number of students than the overall enroll
ment rate of 71 percent.
We wonder, has the carrot-dangling ap
proach played out as planned? Of the 120
President's Scholars in the sophomore class,
only 19 used their funds after their freshman
year, as recommended by the program
(though they actually have access to the grant
until the beginning of their junior year). And
because students use the grants for "intellectu
al exploration," rather than cut-and-dry re
search, it is difficult to hold them accountable
for spending the money appropriately.
As Laura Selznick, associate director of Under
graduate Research Programs, put it, students
need only turn in"a paragraph and a picture" to
show how they have used the gi ant. Of course,
some submit more — one sophomore has written
ajournal article on the influence of Catholicism on
Poland's entry into the European Union. But in
general, the program's flexibility runs the risk of
approaching laxness.

Until now, the Undergraduate Research Pro
grams office has run the program, with a budget
for informational lunches, workshops and get-to
gethers for scholars. Now that the program is on
hiatus, the money will return to the President's of
fice. We urge the President's office to re-channel
the funds toward those students who can actually
use them.
For example, students who apply for major
grants are expected to use those funds to research
an honors thesis. And students involved in the
VPUE program often find themselves doing re
search fora faculty member, rather than complet
ing independent work.
Why not institute a program that provides
major grants to students pursuing goal-oriented
research that doesn't necessarily lead to a thesis?
The Stanford community is teeming with the
intellectual excitement and curiosity that research
programs hope to promote. While we agree with
the University's decision to pause the President's
Scholar program, we hope the newly freed money
can be put to even better use.
