Activism article overlooks two
'significant 7 movements
While I appreciated seeing a front-page
article on the history of activism at Stan
ford ("Fighting the system: A look at over
30 years of Activism on Campus," Oct. 7)
and understand that you could not possi
bly cover every incidence of activism that
has occurred on this campus, I felt that
one very significant event and another en
tire, ongoing activist movement should
not have been excluded.
The first is a large student-run cam
paign executed from 1998-2000 that suc
ceeded in dramatically increasing the bud
get of each of the six community centers
on campus.
This campaign was unprecedented in
the number of student groups from dif
ferent communities and cultures that
were able to pull together to form one
unified coalition.
Without the efforts of the students in
volved in that campaign, our community
centers would not have been able to hire
full-time directors and assistant directors,
pay their student staff, or implement near
ly the same range of quality programs that
they do today.
The second significant omission is the
Gay and Lesbian or Queer Rights Move
ment. Not only is this movement an inte
gral part of the history of activism at Stan
ford, but some of the most significant
events in the history of the national Queer
Rights Movement have happened here at
Stanford.
In 1968, when the Student Homophile
League of Stanford University was found
ed, it was only the second student organi
zation in the country to be dedicated to
gay rights. The founding of the Gay Peo
ple's Union in 1971 was also in itself an ac
tivist act, and the organization has repre
sented Stanford in the San Francisco Pride
Parade and implemented a Pride Week at
Stanford every year since, enduring today
as the LGBT Community Center.
I n 1986, 11 years after activists first
began lobbying the University for change,
sexual orientation was finally added to the
non-discrimination clause of the admis
sions policy.
In 1990, student activism also resulted
in equal housing opportunities for domes
tic partners, including same-sex couples.
Several significant figures in the Queer
Rights Movement have also attended
Stanford, including Harry Hay, some
times referred to as the Father of the Gay
Rights Movement for his 1950 founding of
The Mattachine Society and later The
Radical Faeries.
Those interested in learning more about
the history of queer activism at Stanford are
invited to visit Stanford Pride's timeline at
http://www.stanfordalumni.org/stanford
club/pride/pridestones.html, look up Ger
ard Koskovich's 1994 Stanford Magazine
article "Coming to Terms: From Passionate
Friendship to Gay Liberation at Stanford
(1891-1974)", or read Joel Frank Roberts'
article "Magically Queer at Stanford in the

'70s" in the most recent issue of FIRE!, a
publication of the LGBT Community Re
sources Center.

Coming out 'makes Stanford
a better place'
As Stanford's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual
and Transgender community prepares
for National Coming Out Day on Friday,
Oct. 11, it's important to realize what
consequences coming out can have for
an entire campus.
Coming out isn't just the process of la
beling one's self or reexamining one's life.
Instead, coming out is a statement. It re
flects the desire to be open about your
identity and your feelings, likes, dislikes,
and opinions about that identity.
But by not putting your foot out to
make that declaration, you lose out on
sharing your opinions and the larger Stan
ford community loses out on having your
true self.
Consider what would have happened if
both women and men in the late 1960's
hadn't come out as feminists. Or if a group
of leaders from many economic classes
didn't come out in support of the right for
farm workers to organize in California. Or
if the recent group of students in White
Plaza last week never came out in opposi
tion to the upcoming war in Iraq.
In coming out to express a belief in
something not necessarily endorsed by the
status quo these people generated a dia
logue that made room for new changes to
be made in our society.
Coming out should never be just a
proclamation, it should be the first step
into establishing a new space for people to
discuss, rally, build, and vent. Which is
why on Friday, I'm coming out as a queer,
an intellectual, a musician, a friend to all
races, ethnicities, genders, and orienta
tions, and as someone who thinks that
coming out makes Stanford a better place.

Pro-Israel letters are fallacious
The pro-Israel letters on Oct. 7 con
tained numerous falsehoods. Sheree
Roth's letter stated that Israel provides
"equal rights for all its citizens, rights to
vote and free speech, and freedom of
the press."
This is simply not true. Israel has
pointedly separate and unequal treat
ment of its Jewish and non-Jewish citi
zens. When the law does not explicitly
call for unequal treatment, enforcement
is unequal (see B'Tselem's July 2002 re
port on how Jewish settlers can kill Pales
tinians with impunity).
Most importantly, a large number of Is
rael's subjects are excluded from citizen
ship: the non-Jewish population of the

occupied West bank and Gaza Strip has no
rights whatsoever.
Although Jewish settlers in these
areas are afforded protection and
rights, the Muslim and Christian Pales
tinian population has no right to prop
erty (it can be seized or destroyed at any
time), no right to freedom of move
ment and no right to trial.
Palestinians are subject to execution
without trial and to detention and tor
ture without charge (nearly 8,000
Palestinians currently are in Israeli de
tention camps).
Israeli destruction of schools and ed
ucational records along with the con
tinual lock down of the civilian popula
tion results in a denial of education to
Palestinian children (See UNICFF's
Oct. 2 press release).
All this is done in order to maintain
and expand Israel's continued confis
cation of land and water for use exclu
sively by the settler population.
As for freedom of speech and the press,
the Israel army has routinely fired upon
reporters and has expelled reporters to
control information. Roth surely knows
that Knesset Member Azmi Bishara was
stripped of his parliamentary immunity in
order to try him for his speech criticizing
Arial Sharon. Arab citizens of Israel can
now be stripped of their citizenship when
it suits the state (see the case of Nihad Abu

Kishik last month).
In the Occupied Territories denial of
freedom of speech is much more severe,
of course. Witness Israel's current
killing of demonstrators protesting the
strangling curfew.
S.B. Menaheim refers to Israel as a
"small, multicultural, democracy." Small
in area, yes, but Menaheim attempts to
paint Israel as the weak party when it is
one of the largest military powers in the
world and armed with weapons of mass
destruction. Israel is multicultural. It is
inhabited by people of many cultures but
the resources of the state and rights
apply disproportionately to one legally
defined group.
While A/mi Bishari is on trial for words
in support of Palestinian freedom, mem
bers of Sharon's cabinet and other promi
nent Israelis call for ethnic cleansing. Last
month General Eitan Ben Elyahu, the for
mer head of the Israeli Air Force, coined a
new euphemism for ethnic cleansing
when he declared on Israeli television that
"we will have to thin out the number of
Palestinians living in the territories."
Gamla, a group founded by former Is
raeli military officers and settlers, and sup
ported by donations from the U.S. pub
lished detailed plans this summer for the
"complete elimination of the Arab demo
graphic threat to Israel" by forcibly ex
pelling all Palestinians, including Pales

tinians in the occupied territories and
Palestinian citizens of Israel from the area
between the Jordan River and the
Mediterranean Sea within a 3-5 year peri
od. According to Menaheim, to point out
this problem is anti-Semitic. For Mena
heim to accuse Israel's critics of "elimina
tionist anti-Semitism" at the very moment
that the "eliminationists" are in ascension
in Israel is the height of hypocrisy.
