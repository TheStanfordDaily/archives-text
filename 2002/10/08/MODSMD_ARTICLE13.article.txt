# NomCom to select student reps
## 
### BENJAMIN L. FRIEDLAND SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On Wednesday, the ASSU
Nominations Commission will
begin reviewing applications for
the open student seats on a wide
range of critical University Com
mittees — bodies that govern a
variety of University activities,
ranging from campus develop
ment to the allocation of endow
ment donations.
Comprised of seven under
graduate and graduate students,
the Nominations Commission is
responsible for overseeing the se
lection of students to the 45 per
manent University Committees as
well as the handful of ad hoc com
mittees that customarily are creat
ed during the year.
"We want student voice heard,"
said junior Nadiya Figueroa,
NomCom chairperson. "Student
input on decisions that affect them
is essential."
After an extensive application
and interview process, NomCom
submits its recommendations to
the Undergraduate Senate and
Graduate Council for approval.
Once finalized, the selected few —
which can include between one
and three students per committee,

depending on required time com
mitment and scope of the decisions
— represent the greater student
body during mostly closed-door,
confidential meetings.
NomCom expects over 200 ap
plications for the 30 available seats
this fall. However, the bulk of the
commission's work comes during
spring quarter, when the majority
of committee seats open up.
"We try to select students who
are outspoken and comfortable
dealing with faculty and adminis
tration," Figueroa said.
"In my experience, the Nomi
nations Commission has selected
the right students," said senior
Sunaina Sinha, who has been
nominated for the past three years
and currently sits on both the
Committee for Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid and
the Board of Trustees Committee.
"There's always a student who
over-commits and misses meet
ings, but it's really quite effective."
Figueroa explained that these
committees truly recognize the
student representatives as equal
members.
For example, last year, when
the Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid was
reviewing whether to continue

recognizing Advanced Placement
credit from high school — a deci
sion that has not yet been made —
the committee's students spear
headed a campus-wide survey to
ensure a popular verdict.
"The representatives received
an overwhelming response to their
survey," Figueroa said. "AP credit
proved extremely important, and
the students then presented their
case to the administration, who
then postponed their decision."
However, some representatives
find fault with NomCom's selec
tion process.
"If you have a committee fo
cusing on graduate issues, does it
make sense to have a co-term who
is only around for five years?" said
Sociology Doctoral Candidate
Simon Weffer-Klizondo, who
serves on the Committee on
Graduate Studies. "Doctoral stu
dents are around fora minimum
of five."
Despite the possible flaws,
NomCom serves a crucial role for
the student body, Sinha said.
" They do their best to select a
diverse group of students," she
said. "This way a cross-section of
the student body is represented,
which is important for successful
decision making."
