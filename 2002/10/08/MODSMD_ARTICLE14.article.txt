WHITNEY SADO
This year, the Undergraduate
Advising Center has joined forces
with the Lesbian Gay Bisexual
Transgender Community Re
source Center to present a new
weekly lunch series for "queer,
questioning and allied" freshmen,
aimed at supporting new students
both socially and academically.
Over 20 freshmen were in atten
dance at the first meeting last
Wednesday — a much higher
turnout than organizers anticipated.
"There was a definite need that
we felt," said communication grad
uate student Dominique Johnson,
coordinator of the series. "But we
were still surprised and encour
aged by last week's turnout."
Organizers named the series
"LGBT*CASA," or "Lesbian / Gay
/ Bisexual / Transgender Commu
nity Academic Support and Advis
ing," to evoke an image of a sup
portive environment similar to
one's home or "casa."
"LGBT*CASA was created in
order to provide a safe environ
ment for queer, questioning, and
allied freshmen to build their com
munity together upon their arrival
at Stanford," Johnson said.
Free lunch is provided every

Wednesday at noon, when fresh
men are given a chance to meet eacl 1
other and learn about academic and
community resources available to
them at Stanford. Each week has a
different focus, and can feature pro
fessors, athletes or even films.
This new series grew out of a
program offered through the
UAC for the past two years,

called" PAE vi."
" The program ... is offered
under the aegis of the UAC's Ex
panded Advising Program," said
Ben Davidson, director of the
LGB T-CRC. Randy Williams, di
rector of Expanded Advising Pro
grams at the UAC, has also helped

organize the lunch series.
It is co-sponsored by the UAC
to build a bridge between social
advising and academic advising in
a joint resource community.
I'he premise of the program is
that students become academical
ly empowered when their social
needs are met.
The program's vision state
ment describes its intent as "to as
sist incoming students in building
a comprehensive community sup
port system to ensure an environ
ment which promotes academic
excellence."
Student mentors —Johnson
and sophomores Jon Snowden
and Grace Leslie — also serve as
an important resource for these
students.
Evening programs, such as at
tending performances in San Fran
cisco and dinners at alumni homes,
will also be incorporated about
twice a quarter, and guests from
within the University will be invited
to talk with the freshmen and to
build academic connections.
Future sessions of the weekly
program include a 1 lalloween film
fest, a meeting with LGBT and al
lied athletes, and a panel of par
ents who have supported their
children in coming out.
All interested are invited to par
ticipate in this new program by
coming by the LGBT-CRC any
Wednesday at noon.
