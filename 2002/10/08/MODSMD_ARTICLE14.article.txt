This year, the Undergraduate
Advising Center has joined forces
with the Lesbian Gay Bisexual
Transgender Community Re
source Center to present a new
weekly lunch series for "queer,
questioning and allied" freshmen,
aimed at supporting new students
both socially and academically.
Over 20 freshmen were in atten
dance at the first meeting last
Wednesday â€” a much higher
turnout than organizers anticipated.
"There was a definite need that
we felt," said communication grad
uate student Dominique Johnson,
coordinator of the series. "But we
were still surprised and encour
aged by last week's turnout."
Organizers named the series
"LGBT*CASA," or "Lesbian / Gay
/ Bisexual / Transgender Commu
nity Academic Support and Advis
ing," to evoke an image of a sup
portive environment similar to
one's home or "casa."
"LGBT*CASA was created in
order to provide a safe environ
ment for queer, questioning, and
allied freshmen to build their com
munity together upon their arrival
at Stanford," Johnson said.
Free lunch is provided every

Wednesday at noon, when fresh
men are given a chance to meet eacl 1
other and learn about academic and
community resources available to
them at Stanford. Each week has a
different focus, and can feature pro
fessors, athletes or even films.
This new series grew out of a
program offered through the
UAC for the past two years,

called" PAE vi."
" The program ... is offered
under the aegis of the UAC's Ex
panded Advising Program," said
Ben Davidson, director of the
LGB T-CRC. Randy Williams, di
rector of Expanded Advising Pro
grams at the UAC, has also helped
