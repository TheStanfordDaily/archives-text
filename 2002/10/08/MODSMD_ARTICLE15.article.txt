# New international affairs organization to run MUN, act in community
## 
### ALLISON DENCKER 
Hoping to increase membership and
expand the scope of its involvement, Stan
ford Model United Nations has reincar
nated itself in the form of the Society for
International Affairs at Stanford — a new
group that hopes to provide students with
a more in-depth awareness of internation
al relations.
Organizers created SIAS to be Model U N
combined with action — debating and creat
ing resolutions inside a mock convention will
only be the beginning of this organization,
which will reach out into the community and
work with other international affairs organi
zations to affect changes in the real world.

Last year's Model UN leadership, wary
of the club's low membership and disorga
nization, decided to pass the secretariat
onto five especially dedicated members, in
the hopes they could revitalize the organi
zation. This year's leaders, senior Anya
Vodopyanov, juniors Christina Jung,
Nathalie Pearl-Pulmones de Leon and
Tracy Williams, and sophomore Mike
Brooks, have formed SI AS as a broader or
ganization under which Model UN fits.
This year, membership has increased,
and the group has created a more exten
sive leadership infrastructure — in addi
tion to the SIAS core of about six or seven
members, there are about 20 chairs and
co-chairs who aid the core group. These

changes allow SIAS to undertake larger
projects and to increase membership in an
organized fashion.
SIAS, in addition to sponsoring Model
UN, will also sponsor speakers, panels,
community outreach and collaborations
with other IR-related organizations.
Vodopyanov, chair for conferences the
team travels to, said she hopes to increase
fundraising so that every member who
wants to travel in competitions is able to
do so.
While leaders want a successful Model
UN program, they are also focusing this
year 011 expanding their role outside of the
conferences.
"I would also like to see more develop

ment of our non-Model UN activities,"
Pearl-Pulmones de Leon said. "This in
cludes a continuation and expansion of
our speaker activities, like our panel on the
Post-post Cold War World last February,
more community service initiatives and
more collaborations with other interna
tional affairs groups on campus."
Since SIAS is associated with the Haas
Center for Public Service, community out
reach projects are an integral part of the
organization.
According to Williams, bringing Model
UN under an SIAS influence forces it "out
ofacademia, into the real world."
A new project led by Williams and Jung
will augment this goal—beginning this

summer, they will send a group of SIAS
members to Haiti for two weeks to do com
munity service.
SIAS leaders also emphasized that in
creasing international awareness begins at
home through utilizing Stanford's re
sources to "get back to the business of ar
ranging speaker events on hot-button is
sues," Pearl-Pulmones de Leon said.
According to Williams, this is one of the
primary aims of SIAS.
"Everyone is used to international rela
tions being speakers and debates, buried
in academia — Model UN is the epitome
of not feeling real," Williams said. "If we
could make it feel real, we'd show people
what IR is really about."
