Whenever the words "Stanford ten

excellence.
I bis week, the Stanford men's tennis
team will try to live up to those standards
when it competes in the ICY HO I'/In-

Intercollegiate Tennis Association Tournament

tercollegiate Tennis Association Tourna
ment in Chattanooga, Tenn. The tour
nament is the largest collegiate tennis
tournament in the nation and the first
major competition of the season.
Stanford's association with excel

lence is not unwarranted fora team
known for producing like tennis super
stars John McEnroe and countless I lall
of Famers, including associate head
coach and former champion player
John Whitlinger. In coach Dick Gould's
36 years of coaching at Stanford, he has
led the team to 17 NCAA titles. With the
coming year there is the clear possibili
ty of winning yet another.

Boasting a team of returning veterans
under the tutelage of Gould and
Whitlinger, the Cardinal has a strong
outlook lor the tournament, as well as for
the season, with seniors Scott Lipsky and
David Martin getting the top seed in dou
bles at the tournament.
"Lipsky and Martin are a very
strong doubles team," Gould said.
"They were top seeds in doubles at the
tournament last year but unfortunate
ly fell to the team from UCLA. In the
past several years, they have made the
semifinals in the NCAAs and last year
made the finals."
Freshman phenom k.C. Corkery was
able to progress to the qualifying singles
round, which will be played today.
Whitlinger, Martin and Lipsky are flying
to the tournament today to compete in
the main draw lor doubles.
This season's full roster includes
freshmen Corkery, James Pade and
John Wong. Returning players are se
niors Ryan Haviland, Scott Lipsky and
David Martin, juniors Joe Kao and
Carter Morris, and sophomores Phil
Shengand Sam Warburg.
I he tournament begins with 256
singles players and 128 doubles teams
in the pre-qualifying round and whee
dles down to 64 singles players and 32
doubles teams in the main draw,
which is scheduled for play on Thurs
day. Last year, Stanford player K.J.
I lippensteel won the championship in
singles competition.
Fall holds a relatively light schedule
for the men's tennis team, but it is a
warm-up period for demanding play to
come in the spring.
"It's (he first tournament of the year,
and we don't expect to play our best ten
nis," Lipsky said. "I lowever, it is an early

what you need to shoot for."
The Cardinal enters the year rid
ing off of a No. 10 final ranking in
2001-2002. Even though it has lost
two phenomenal players in the past
year, hopes are still high with great
starters and freshmen.
"Really we have three great se
niors this year," Gould said. "David
Martin, Ryan Haviland and Scott
Lipsky would all be very strong play
ers if they can all be consistent. They
have all made great progress; amaz
ingly, two of them didn't even start
in their freshman year."
With such highly honed tech
niques, sometimes it's hard to choose
who gets their share of glory.
"This year's team is very tough,"

Gould said. "We'll have at least eight
players competing for starting posi
tions with Wong and Joe Kao giving
them a run for their money."
The newcomers boast impressive
creclentiiils: Corkery deferred enroll
ment forayearto play in tournaments
and worked his way to become one of
the top 500 players in the country.
Gould remarked that he is an incred
ibly strong freshman starter.
Ail-American Haviland is taking
the fall season offbut will be back to
compete in January.
Next week Warburg and Morris
will head to the Midland, Texas, to
compete in a tournament with eight
other universities.
Gould has tremendous faith in
t he players.
"We're all very excited, John, my
self, and all of the players," Gould
said. "I lopefully everyone can stay
healthy. We have real potential to
win something this year."

Whenever the words "Stanford ten
nis" are uttered, there are high expecta
tions and a compulsory association with
excellence.
I bis week, the Stanford men's tennis
team will try to live up to those standards
when it competes in the ICY HO I'/In-

tercollegiate Tennis Association Tourna
ment in Chattanooga, Tenn. The tour
nament is the largest collegiate tennis
tournament in the nation and the first
major competition of the season.
Stanford's association with excel

lence is not unwarranted fora team
known for producing like tennis super
stars John McEnroe and countless I lall
of Famers, including associate head
coach and former champion player
John Whitlinger. In coach Dick Gould's
36 years of coaching at Stanford, he has
led the team to 17 NCAA titles. With the
coming year there is the clear possibili
ty of winning yet another.

Boasting a team of returning veterans
under the tutelage of Gould and
Whitlinger, the Cardinal has a strong
outlook lor the tournament, as well as for
the season, with seniors Scott Lipsky and
David Martin getting the top seed in dou
bles at the tournament.
"Lipsky and Martin are a very
strong doubles team," Gould said.
"They were top seeds in doubles at the
tournament last year but unfortunate
ly fell to the team from UCLA. In the
past several years, they have made the
semifinals in the NCAAs and last year
made the finals."
Freshman phenom k.C. Corkery was
able to progress to the qualifying singles
round, which will be played today.
Whitlinger, Martin and Lipsky are flying
to the tournament today to compete in
the main draw lor doubles.
This season's full roster includes
freshmen Corkery, James Pade and
John Wong. Returning players are se
niors Ryan Haviland, Scott Lipsky and
David Martin, juniors Joe Kao and
Carter Morris, and sophomores Phil
Shengand Sam Warburg.
I he tournament begins with 256
singles players and 128 doubles teams
in the pre-qualifying round and whee
dles down to 64 singles players and 32
doubles teams in the main draw,
which is scheduled for play on Thurs
day. Last year, Stanford player K.J.
I lippensteel won the championship in
singles competition.
Fall holds a relatively light schedule
for the men's tennis team, but it is a
warm-up period for demanding play to
come in the spring.
"It's (he first tournament of the year,
and we don't expect to play our best ten
nis," Lipsky said. "I lowever, it is an early

barometer of where you are and
what you need to shoot for."
The Cardinal enters the year rid
ing off of a No. 10 final ranking in
2001-2002. Even though it has lost
two phenomenal players in the past
year, hopes are still high with great
starters and freshmen.
"Really we have three great se
niors this year," Gould said. "David
Martin, Ryan Haviland and Scott
Lipsky would all be very strong play
ers if they can all be consistent. They
have all made great progress; amaz
ingly, two of them didn't even start
in their freshman year."
With such highly honed tech
niques, sometimes it's hard to choose
who gets their share of glory.
