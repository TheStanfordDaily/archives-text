ment in Chattanooga, Tenn. The tour
nament is the largest collegiate tennis
tournament in the nation and the first
major competition of the season.
Stanford's association with excel

lence is not unwarranted fora team
known for producing like tennis super
stars John McEnroe and countless I lall
of Famers, including associate head
coach and former champion player
John Whitlinger. In coach Dick Gould's
36 years of coaching at Stanford, he has
led the team to 17 NCAA titles. With the
coming year there is the clear possibili
ty of winning yet another.

Boasting a team of returning veterans
under the tutelage of Gould and
Whitlinger, the Cardinal has a strong
outlook lor the tournament, as well as for
the season, with seniors Scott Lipsky and
David Martin getting the top seed in dou

strong doubles team," Gould said.
"They were top seeds in doubles at the
tournament last year but unfortunate

past several years, they have made the
semifinals in the NCAAs and last year
made the finals."
Freshman phenom k.C. Corkery was
able to progress to the qualifying singles
round, which will be played today.
Whitlinger, Martin and Lipsky are flying

John Wong. Returning players are se

I lippensteel won the championship in
singles competition.
Fall holds a relatively light schedule
for the men's tennis team, but it is a
warm-up period for demanding play to
come in the spring.
