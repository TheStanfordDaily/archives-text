# That Guy forced to go team-less

Don't be That Guy. Trust me, you don't want to
be him. You definitely don't want to be That
Guy who always hung out at your high school
well alter he graduated. 1 le didn't have many friends
when he left, but he thought he did. He doesn't have
that many friends now, but he thinks he does.
Vou probably see him on campus at about 2:00 p.m.,
