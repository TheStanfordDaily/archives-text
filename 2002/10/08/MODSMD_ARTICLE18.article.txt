# That Guy forced to go team-less
## 
### 
Don't be That Guy. Trust me, you don't want to
be him. You definitely don't want to be That
Guy who always hung out at your high school
well alter he graduated. 1 le didn't have many friends
when he left, but he thought he did. He doesn't have
that many friends now, but he thinks he does.
Vou probably see him on campus at about 2:00 p.m.,
late enough for him to pretend that he's there for the

4:(H) soccer game, but early enough to
make a fool out of himself. He might
even say something like, "I'm here to
see the coach," or "Just here for the
game," or even "My sch(X)l starts in
October, what do you want me to do?"
Trust me, you don't want to be
That Guy.
You don't want to be walking
around your old campus, bored out
of your mind. All your friends flown

the coop for the semester system a month ago. The
only friends still at home are underclassmen soccer
players, now seniors, at your old high school.
This is your last warning, you don't want to be
That Guy.
You might even resort to sitting with the students
at the game, watching the new freshmen adjust,
yelling at the referee as if you were a high school stu
dent. As if. You might even try to start a conversation
with students, having forgotten their names years ago,
convinced that they know yours. You think you aren't
That Guy.
But you are The Guy.
Believe me, you don't want to be that loser high
school alum, forced to hangout at your old school for
enjoyment. You don't want to be That Guy.
I know. I am That Guy.
lhe excuse as to why I'm on my old campus so
much is because of the soccer team. I used to be on the
Marin Academy High School varsity soccer team; my
brother still is, in his last year. I lowever, seeing as how
1 still have some soccer ability left in me, the coach al-


Spencer Porter
lows me to practice with the team
whenever I want, and 1 take him
up on that. The team is cool with it.
Some of these guys are great
friends of mine. So before that cru
cial move-in date, Sept. 18, I fre
quent my former castle, in blatant
disregard of my social exile.
Yet when I'm at Stanford, there
is no group like this for me, no com
munity, no team. But why must I
stay in high school to find t hat kind
of enjoyment? Why can't I bring
that to Stanford? Why can't I feel
the same way about Stanford as I do
my old soccer team?
The first response is obvious: I'm
not good enough to make the Stan
ford varsity soccer team. I have no
team at Stanford, no locker room,
no coach, no teammates. But still,
there were people that had no team
at my high school that felt the same
sort of camaraderie I felt on the soc
cer team, vet still adored the school

in general for its sports teams and
the community atmosphere the
school supported.
Sports Illustrated, in its most
recent issue, commented on the
general apathy of Stanford stu
dents towards athletics. I say it
goes much farther than sports, but
it all stems from the Department
of Athletics.
To all naysayers, just look at
Texas's intramural and club pro
grams. They have 42 different in
tramural sports and 40 club teams,
compared to eight and 17 at Stan
ford, respectively. Meanwhile, does
the Stanford Athletics Department
allow baseball, soccer, football, bas
ketball, water polo, tennis or any
other mainstream club teams?
No. The official word, which 1
learned after trying in vain to create
a soccer club team last year, was that
the Department does not allow ath
letic club teams to play a sp< >rt that is
currently a varsity sport.
Uh . . . Hello? Athletics De
partment?
Are they expecting students to
come in yelling, "Gee whiz, I hope

there is an ice-climbing club team.
I played that sport throughout
high school, and I want to play it
at Stanford!"
That minority is recognized and
given a sport, while the throngs of
high school varsity captains, short
stops and power forwards are
forced into oblivion.
The Athletics Department needs
to realize that the apathy of the reg
ular students towards athletics is
due to ihe fact that they don't offer
regular students outlets to express
their own athletic skills.
It's hard for the 9-year old to im
itate and idolize Barry Bonds if he
isn't allowed to play Little League.
So Sports Illustrated asks, where
is that kind of community spirit?
Where is that mutual camaraderie
between Stanford students?
I ask, where is that family atmos
phere that was so prevalent in my
high school experience?
The Athletics Department needs
to step to the plate by letting stu
dents do the same. The Veil Lead
ers can only do so much.
Everybody needs their com

munity. Everybody needs their
team, their group of guys, their
clique of girls, their locker room,
their art group, their understand
ing that other people are looking
out for them.
For me, it was my high school
varsity soccer team, and 1 have yet to
find my high school varsity soccer
team at Stanford. I am forced to go
back home, back to where I was part
of a team, part of a community, part
of a family.
I miss that soccer team, so I be
come That Guy, in a last ditch effort
to reclaim the community that was
once mine. I go to where people are
there for me and will always care.
Trust, confidence and love. It's the
benefit to being That Guy that out
weighs all else.
So yeah, I guess I am That Guy,
and maybe you should be him, too.

Spencer Porter is an undeclared sopho
more. He was the Branner Intramural
Athlete of the Year, as well as the Branner
Intramural Sports representative, which
was merely coincidental. I\-)nail him at
porters@stanford.edu.

see the coach," or "Just here for the
game," or even "My sch(X)l starts in
October, what do you want me to do?"
Trust me, you don't want to be
That Guy.
You don't want to be walking
around your old campus, bored out
of your mind. All your friends flown

the coop for the semester system a month ago. The
only friends still at home are underclassmen soccer
players, now seniors, at your old high school.
This is your last warning, you don't want to be
That Guy.
You might even resort to sitting with the students
at the game, watching the new freshmen adjust,
yelling at the referee as if you were a high school stu
dent. As if. You might even try to start a conversation
with students, having forgotten their names years ago,
convinced that they know yours. You think you aren't
That Guy.
But you are The Guy.
Believe me, you don't want to be that loser high
school alum, forced to hangout at your old school for
enjoyment. You don't want to be That Guy.
I know. I am That Guy.
lhe excuse as to why I'm on my old campus so
much is because of the soccer team. I used to be on the
Marin Academy High School varsity soccer team; my
brother still is, in his last year. I lowever, seeing as how
1 still have some soccer ability left in me, the coach al-


Spencer Porter
lows me to practice with the team
whenever I want, and 1 take him
up on that. The team is cool with it.
Some of these guys are great
friends of mine. So before that cru
cial move-in date, Sept. 18, I fre
quent my former castle, in blatant
disregard of my social exile.
Yet when I'm at Stanford, there
is no group like this for me, no com
munity, no team. But why must I
stay in high school to find t hat kind
of enjoyment? Why can't I bring
that to Stanford? Why can't I feel
the same way about Stanford as I do
my old soccer team?
The first response is obvious: I'm
not good enough to make the Stan
ford varsity soccer team. I have no
team at Stanford, no locker room,
no coach, no teammates. But still,
there were people that had no team
at my high school that felt the same
sort of camaraderie I felt on the soc
cer team, vet still adored the school

in general for its sports teams and
the community atmosphere the
school supported.
Sports Illustrated, in its most
recent issue, commented on the
general apathy of Stanford stu
dents towards athletics. I say it
goes much farther than sports, but
it all stems from the Department
of Athletics.
To all naysayers, just look at
Texas's intramural and club pro
grams. They have 42 different in
tramural sports and 40 club teams,
compared to eight and 17 at Stan
ford, respectively. Meanwhile, does
the Stanford Athletics Department
allow baseball, soccer, football, bas
ketball, water polo, tennis or any
other mainstream club teams?
No. The official word, which 1
learned after trying in vain to create
a soccer club team last year, was that
the Department does not allow ath
letic club teams to play a sp< >rt that is
currently a varsity sport.
Uh . . . Hello? Athletics De
partment?
Are they expecting students to
come in yelling, "Gee whiz, I hope

there is an ice-climbing club team.
I played that sport throughout
high school, and I want to play it
at Stanford!"
That minority is recognized and
given a sport, while the throngs of
high school varsity captains, short
stops and power forwards are
forced into oblivion.
The Athletics Department needs
to realize that the apathy of the reg
ular students towards athletics is
due to ihe fact that they don't offer
regular students outlets to express
their own athletic skills.
It's hard for the 9-year old to im
itate and idolize Barry Bonds if he
isn't allowed to play Little League.
So Sports Illustrated asks, where
is that kind of community spirit?
Where is that mutual camaraderie
between Stanford students?
I ask, where is that family atmos
phere that was so prevalent in my
high school experience?
The Athletics Department needs
to step to the plate by letting stu
dents do the same. The Veil Lead
ers can only do so much.
Everybody needs their com

munity. Everybody needs their
team, their group of guys, their
clique of girls, their locker room,
their art group, their understand
ing that other people are looking
out for them.
For me, it was my high school
varsity soccer team, and 1 have yet to
find my high school varsity soccer
team at Stanford. I am forced to go
back home, back to where I was part
of a team, part of a community, part
of a family.
I miss that soccer team, so I be
come That Guy, in a last ditch effort
to reclaim the community that was
once mine. I go to where people are
there for me and will always care.
Trust, confidence and love. It's the
benefit to being That Guy that out
weighs all else.
So yeah, I guess I am That Guy,
and maybe you should be him, too.

Spencer Porter is an undeclared sopho
more. He was the Branner Intramural
Athlete of the Year, as well as the Branner
Intramural Sports representative, which
was merely coincidental. I\-)nail him at
porters@stanford.edu.
Don't be That Guy. Trust me, you don't want to
be him. You definitely don't want to be That
Guy who always hung out at your high school
well alter he graduated. 1 le didn't have many friends
when he left, but he thought he did. He doesn't have
that many friends now, but he thinks he does.
Vou probably see him on campus at about 2:00 p.m.,
late enough for him to pretend that he's there for the

4:(H) soccer game, but early enough to
make a fool out of himself. He might
even say something like, "I'm here to
see the coach," or "Just here for the
game," or even "My sch(X)l starts in
October, what do you want me to do?"
