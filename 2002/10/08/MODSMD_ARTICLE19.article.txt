# Cal's success is another dagger in heart
## 
### MATT LONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
'flic bad news from Berkeley became
a little worse for Stanford fans this week
end. California, coming off of a one-win
season, has officially rebounded. The
Bears did what Stanford never seems to
be able to do, and defeated No. 12 Wash
ington 34-27 at Husky Stadium, ending
a 19-game losing streak to the I luskies.
Cal was expected to be t he Pacific-10
Conference's extra bye week once
again, but after a 3-2 start (1-1 Pac-10),
the Bears are poised to compete for the
conference crown, though a bowl game
is out of the question clue to NCAA pro
bation. All of the credit must go to lirst
year head coach Jeff fed ford. Ted ford
was the offensive coordinator for Ore
gon last season, and he brought his ex
plosive gameplan and winning tradi
tion to Strawberry Canyon. Suddenly,

Cal's senior quarterback Kyle Boiler
looks more like Joey Harrington than
the riches to rags prized recruit who
lias ripped holes in the Bears' pocket
the past three seasons.
Boiler picked a good year to live up to
expectations and had a career day Satur
day. He passed for 266 yards and live
touchdowns en route to being named
Pac-10 Player of the Week.
"1 can honestly say this is the best
game I've ever played, high school or
college," Boiler said. "It was the best leel
ing to look up in the stands afterward. 1
saw my mom jumping up and down. It
was awesome."
The win came just at the right time for
t lie Bears, as they had begun to doubt
their early success after consecutive loss
es to Air Force and Washington State. If
Cal can continue its winning ways and
finish in the conference's top three, Ted
lord will be a shoo-in for national coach

of the year honors.
Meanwhile, the Huskies (3-2, 0-1
Pac-10) are left scratching their heads
after a 17-game home winning streak
ended, giving them their second loss of
the season and dropping them 10 spots
in the rankings.
"I would have never dreamed in my
wildest dreams that I would lose to Cal,"
Washington guard Elliott Zajac said. "It
was horrendous."
Stanford just might be saying the
same thing on the afternoon of Nov. 23,
as its rival managed to finally field a tal
ented and resilient team the same year
the Cardinal is struggling. Cal fans are
salivating already for Big Game, where
Stanford's seven-game streak looks ripe
for the picking.
Cal will face No. 20 Southern Cali
fornia (3-2, 1-1) this week. The Bears

have the tools to match USC's
team speed, but the Trojans will
be angry rebounding from a 30-
27 overtime loss to No. 18
Washington State (5-1, 2-0),
which jumped to No. 12 in this
week's rankings.
No. 7 Oregon (5-0, 1-0) re
mains the only unbeaten confer
ence team with its 31-14 win over
Arizona. The Ducks' 10-game
winning streak will be put to the
test Saturday at the Rose Bowl
where they face UCLA (4-1, 1-0),

43-35 winners over Oregon State.
In the only nonconference
game this weekend besides Stan
lord's loss at Notre Dame, Arizona
State (4-2, 1-0) suffered a 38-35
home loss to North Carolina, de
spite gaining an astonishing 657
yards in total offense. 1 his week
the Sun Devils will face a slipping
Oregon State that has dropped
two straight to the L.A. schools
after a 4-0 start.
With the exception of USC's
annual November showdown
with Notre Dame, no nonconfer
ence games are left on the sched
ule for Pac-10 schools, and this
week will be the first with a full
slate of conference battles.
