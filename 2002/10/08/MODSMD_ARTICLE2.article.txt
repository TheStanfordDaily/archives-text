# Initiatives to boost international studies
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Intending to bolster Stanford's excellence in
international studies, the University is undertak
ing two initiatives aimed at bringing together in
dividual departments and even entire schools to
encourage interdisciplinary collaboration and
expand its offerings in international fields.
The two initiatives — one within the School of
Humanities and Sciences and the second across
the whole of the University — are still only pro
posals, and significant changes may be made to
the ideas being presented by those spearheading
the initiatives. But this week, the University is tak
ing substantial steps forward on both fronts by
holding committee meetings to help steer the
projects and open forums for faculty to comment
on the proposals.
"There is a broad feeling that Stanford ought
to do better in international studies," said David

Holloway, director of the Institute for Interna
tional Studies, and a member of the committee
steering the University-wide initiative. "There is a
sense that yes, we could do better, and we con
stantly need to be thinking about how we orga
nize international studies."
According to Cognizant Dean of the Social Sci
ences Karen Cook, the idea to create a Universi
ty-wide structure tor international studies arose
from a faculty committee directed by Provost
John Etchemendy.
The international initiative — which has been
endorsed by University President John Hen
nessy — would be geared at "strengthening] the
international reach of the faculty and programs
at both the undergraduate and graduate levels at
Stanford," Cook said.
Ultimately, a "university-wide consortium for
international studies" could he formed that would
focus on supporting "the research and teaching
efforts of the faculty in international, comparative

and area studies across the various schools, in
cluding Humanities and Sciences, Law, Business
and Earth Systems to name only some of the
schools that might be involved," Cook said.
She said other entities may also be involved,
such as the Institute for International Studies and
the I loover Institution.
I bis framework would allow for faculty from
different schools in the University to develop re
search networks through which pressing global
issues such as "intergroup conflict, civil liberties
and human rights, democratization, economic
development, symbolic representations of cul
tures and new global realities" could be better in
vestigated, Cook said.
Funding raised for the initiative, in addition to
supporting new research and courses, could be
put toward hiring faculty who specialize in areas
Sum lord has historically been weak in — one of
the primary benefits of creating a
formal consortium on international
studies.
I'he Provost's Committee on the
International Initiative, which has
been created to explore the form
such a consortium could take, held
one of its initial meetings last night.
The committee is chaired by
Cook and also includes former di
rector of Overseas Studies Russell
Berman, former Cognizant Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Robert
Gregg, Holloway, Director of the In
ternational Relations Program and
International Policy Studies Nor
man Naimark, John MacMillan of
the Graduate School of Business, In
ternational Law Prof. John Barton
and Andrew Walder, director of the
Asia-Pacific Research Center in lIS.
Within the School of Humanities

and Sciences, a separate push to re
organize international studies has
been underway for about a year,
and this week Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Sharon Long will
begin holding town-hall forums
with faculty to get feedback on the
nascent vision of the new structure.
Currently, Long and Cook are
working on a Division of Interna
tional, Comparative and Area Stud
ies, which was largely inspired by the
success of the success of the Interdis
ciplinary Program in Comparative
Studies in Race and Ethnicity.
Long explained that, at most
Universities, the emphasis on de
partments can limit innovation and
expansion because it is difficult to
start something new without creat
ing an entirely new department.
At Stanford, Long said she
hopes to create a "platform" that
could be used to support existing
programs dealing with interna
tional studies, but that would also
bridge some of Stanford's isolated

interdisciplinary programs and
could also be used to foster innova
tion and experimentation.
Long emphasized that while po
litical science, for example, is an in
tegral component in understanding
international relations, so are litera
ture, history, religion, philosophy
and the arts.
"This is all something we should
be sure to have a home for at Stan
ford," she said.
Similar to the University-wide
initiative, Long sees creating a divi
sion within the School of Humani
ties and Sciences as a way to expand
offerings in area studies and other
disciplines relevant to international
studies where Stanford many not
have a department, but is looking to
strengthen its scholarship.
To support the division, Long
said she plans to use funds from the
$400 million gift that the Hewlett
Foundation pledged to Stanford in
May 2001.
Strengthening South Asian stud

ies at Stanford, a part of Long's vi
sion, is already underway. Long said
she hoped that the division would
also allow Stanford to compete for
grant money to pursue research
that would occur across depart
ments — an activity in which the
University heretofore has been un
able to participate.
"The primary effect would be to
provide support," Long said.
"This would not replace a depart
ment — it would be a coordinating
mechanism."
Long's current proposal includes
potential new centers and programs
that could be developed under the
division, including, for example, a
center dedicated to studying the Eu
ropean Union.
Long also stressed that what she
is presenting to the faculty is only a
starting point, and whatever final
structure the initiative may lake
will be the product of what the fac
ulty is enthusiastic about creating
and supporting.
