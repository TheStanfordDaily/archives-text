# Initiatives to boost international studies

### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Intending to bolster Stanford's excellence in
international studies, the University is undertak
ing two initiatives aimed at bringing together in
dividual departments and even entire schools to
encourage interdisciplinary collaboration and
expand its offerings in international fields.
The two initiatives — one within the School of
Humanities and Sciences and the second across
the whole of the University — are still only pro
posals, and significant changes may be made to
the ideas being presented by those spearheading
the initiatives. But this week, the University is tak
ing substantial steps forward on both fronts by
holding committee meetings to help steer the
projects and open forums for faculty to comment
on the proposals.
"There is a broad feeling that Stanford ought
to do better in international studies," said David

Holloway, director of the Institute for Interna
tional Studies, and a member of the committee
steering the University-wide initiative. "There is a
sense that yes, we could do better, and we con
stantly need to be thinking about how we orga
nize international studies."
According to Cognizant Dean of the Social Sci
ences Karen Cook, the idea to create a Universi
ty-wide structure tor international studies arose
from a faculty committee directed by Provost
John Etchemendy.
The international initiative — which has been
endorsed by University President John Hen
nessy — would be geared at "strengthening] the
international reach of the faculty and programs
at both the undergraduate and graduate levels at
Stanford," Cook said.
Ultimately, a "university-wide consortium for
international studies" could he formed that would
focus on supporting "the research and teaching
efforts of the faculty in international, comparative

and area studies across the various schools, in
cluding Humanities and Sciences, Law, Business
and Earth Systems to name only some of the
schools that might be involved," Cook said.
She said other entities may also be involved,
such as the Institute for International Studies and
the I loover Institution.
I bis framework would allow for faculty from
different schools in the University to develop re
search networks through which pressing global
issues such as "intergroup conflict, civil liberties
and human rights, democratization, economic
development, symbolic representations of cul
tures and new global realities" could be better in
vestigated, Cook said.
Funding raised for the initiative, in addition to
supporting new research and courses, could be
put toward hiring faculty who specialize in areas
