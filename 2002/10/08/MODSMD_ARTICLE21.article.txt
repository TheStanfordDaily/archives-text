## 
### JACK SCHNEIDER DAILY FORTY-NINER 
(U-WIRE) LONG BEACH,
Calif. â€” State Legislatures an
nounced in September a law that
will study athletic programs
throughout California's public: cam
puses, making sure they are com
plying with the rules of Title IX.
The new law, titled AB 2295,
addresses gender equity in Cali
fornia's athletic programs. State
legislators will conduct investiga
tions around the California State
University system campuses in
January 2003, according to ki istal
DeKleer, spokeswoman for As
sembly member Jenny Oropeza,
D-Long Beach.
Title IX bans sex discrimination
in athletic programs that receive
federal funding.
If a campus is in violation of the
law, federal funding to the entire
campus would be eliminated, said
Armando Contreras, executive as
sistant to Cal State-Long Beach
President Robert Maxon.

The CSU system has dealt with
Title IX before in 1993, when the
California National Organization
lor Women filed a suit to the Su
perior Court in San Francisco.
The organization filed the suit
when it found that the CSU
schools had not been implement
ing provisions of the law.
The Cal-Now and the CSU filed
a 1998 Consent Decree, stating
that the CSU systems provide ad
ditional resources for women to
participate in campus intercolle
giate athletic programs.
The decree looked at the equity
between men and women's team,
including participation, expendi
tures and grants in-aid. Athletic
Director Bill Shumard said that
Long Beach has been meeting the
standards of the Consent Decree
ever since its enactment.
"The decree is rigid and has
very specific parameters," Shu
mard said. "However, Long Beach
have made it under their guide
lines for seven to eight years."
The current bill would also be

used to gather evidence that the
CSU campuses have been follow
ing the rules of Title IX and inves
tigate public schools that do not
follow the law.
"We know that the CSU system
has been following the rules of
Title IX and the consent decree,
but the investigation will get re
search on how each campus is
doing," DeKleer said.
Contreras said he believes that
the newly passed law might not
have a great affect on Long Beach.
"I don't think it will affect our
campus too much," Contreras
said. "We've been in compliance
fora number of years with the con
sent decree."
Some of the benefits Long
Beach received from Title IX were
lull funding of athletic scholar
ships as well as additional sports
for women.
Added sports include women's
soccer, women's tennis and an
expansion of the women's water
polo with the addition of more
players.
