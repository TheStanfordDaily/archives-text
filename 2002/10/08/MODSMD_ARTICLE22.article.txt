# Cougars regroup after win
## 
### JAHMAL CORNER DAILY EVERGREEN 
(U-WIRE) PULLMAN, Wash.
— During the second quarter of
Washington State's 30-27 win
against Southern California, the
Cougars found themselves in a
second-and-goal situation on the
Trojans' 1-yard line.
Washington State handed the
ball off to junior running back
Jermaine Green, who had no
gain. On the next play, Cesser
threw an incomplete pass to
freshman tight end Troy Biene
mann. On fourth-and-goal, the
Cougars ran a quarterback-keep
er with Jason Cesser and were
stopped at the goal line.
The series was one of the few
dark clouds in the Cougars' silver
lining. But Washington State
coach Mike Price said that short
yardage situations are a major
topic of discussion for Washing
ton State.
"Mavbe next time it's fourth

and-one, we'll just punt it," said
Price, sarcastically. "I'm really
disappointed. We're going to
have to do something about that.
We work on [short-yardage]
every single week, but we're not
getting any production out of it."
Saturday's victory provoked
the Cougar players to something
for Price that had only been done
two times before — give the
coach a game ball.
"It's sitting on my desk with all
the details from the game," Price
said. "It was really a great thing
for the players to do for me."
Price said he has a couple of
game balls from former Wash
ington State quarterbacks Drew
Bledsoe and Ryan Leaf.
"Those two gave me one, and
now Cesser does," Price said.
"That's pretty good company."
Junior kicker Drew Dunning
made three field goals for the
Cougars, including the game
winning-kick and the fortuitous
game-tying one.

With 1:50 remaining in regula
tion, Dunning kicked a 35-yarder
that looked as though it was blocked.
It started well left of the post and
worked its way back through the up
rights to tie the game at 27-27.
"On the game film we couldn't
see if the ball was tipped or not,"
Price said. "But when he made it
I mumbled to myself, 'We're
going to win this one,' because it
was a lucky play."
Tuesday's practice will be a
telling day for the health of
Cougar football.
Price said offensive lineman
Sam Lightbody pinched a nerve
in his neck and will be evaluated
Tuesday. Running back Allen
Thompson reinjured his shoul
der and most likely will be out for
an extended period. Price said
they'll also take a look at the sta
tus of linebacker Will Derting.
Wide receiver Sammy Moore
also pulled a hamstring Satur
day. but Price said he probably
will be fine.
