# Hoover fellows help make policy on Iraq
## Editor's Note: This article is the second in a weekly series investigating the relationship between the Stanford community and the potential war in Iraq. 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
As the nation inches closer to
what many see as an imminent U.S.
attack 011 Iraq, Stanford students
and faculty, whether in favor of or
against a preemptive war, are writ
ing columns, staging rallies and call
ing their congresspeople — all in
the hope that they will be able to in
fluence their government's foreign
policy.
But while community members
back on the Farm are searching for
the most effective means of swaying
both the public and the Bush ad
ministration, several of Stanford's
most established scholars are in the
trenches of decision-making, play
ing a pivotal role in determining the
nation's course of action as primary
advisers to the Department of De
fense and the White House.
At least seven current I ioover In
stitution fellows are members of the
influential 31-member Defense Pol
icy Board, which advises top mem
bers of the Defense Department on
all issues relating to the national de

tense, while other Hoover members
with personal ties to those in Wash
ington have also been providing in
formal guidance.
1 loover Senior Fellow Martin
Anderson, a member of the Defense
Policy Hoard, said the group was
created to provide more diverse
perspectives on national security is
sues to top government officials.
"The purpose of these boards is
to bring in another look," Anderson
said, stressing that all of the Board's
members were not government em
ployees but civilians and, therefore,
are able to speak freely in meetings.
"They often give a different view
point than the staff, which is impor
tant for the President and the Secre
tary of Defense to get."
Other Hoover fellows on the
Board include Gary Becker,
Richard Allen, Kiron Skinner,
1 lenry Rowen and Visiting Fellows
Newt Gingrich and Pete Wilson. In
addition to being accomplished aca
demics, most of the Board members
have previously held high-level gov
ernment positions.
Anderson said that the proceed
ings of the Board were classified, so
he could not discuss what advice or
opinions he or other Hoover fellows
shared with the administration, or
turn influential that advice has been.

However, John Raisian, director
of the Hoover Institution, said that
the very fact that the administration
has continued to consult these schol
ars suggests that their input has
been highly valued.
"Believe me —if Washington
isn't interested, they'll turn you off,"
Raisian said. "The fact that there
seems to be some open channels
suggests that there is some cogita
tion over what is being discussed."
Raisian also emphasized that,
while the Hoover Institution can
generally be characterized as a con
servative think tank, it is a fallacy to
believe that all of the advice coming
from Hoover fellows is necessarily
the same.
"People do have an impression
that we all think alike over here —
that there's no diversity of views,
that we almost believe everything in

a religious way," he said. "The di
versity at Hoover — people would
be shocked about how much diver
sity of opinion there is here."
According to Raisian, the senti
ment toward war with Iraq within
I loover as a whole is to some degree
similar to student sentiment — it is
characterized more by questions
than answers.
"Some people have a clear idea of
what we should do; there is some un
certainty on how we should do it,"
Raisian said. "[But] there is uncer
tainty abc>ut whether we should do it
within the broad fellowship here."
Despite differences of opinion
that exist within I loover as a whole,
many have described the Defense
Policy Board, one-fourth of which is
comprised of Hoover fellows, as
