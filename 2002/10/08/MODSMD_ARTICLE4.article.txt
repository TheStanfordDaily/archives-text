# Poli Sci debuts more 'coherent' structure
## 
### KRISTEN BELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After undergoing a compre
hensive internal and external re
view last year, the Department of
Political Science has redesigned its
undergraduate curriculum to give
it a more coherent structure.
The most important change in
ihe department was the renum
bering of courses, which was done
"to try to make transparent t lie
logic of the undergraduate cur
riculum â€” students should have a
clear idea of where to start, where
to go from there, and where they
want to wind up," said Paul Sni
derman, Chair of the Department
of Political Science.
In reorganizing the curricu
lum, courses were divided into in
troductory, intermediate or ad
vanced levels. Now, courses num
bered one through 99 are intro
ductory, 100 through 199 are in
termediate, 200 through 299 are
advanced and 300 through 400
are advanced undergraduate and
graduate courses.
The only change faculty made
was to the graduate curriculum
was to renumber graduate courses
400 through 500.
"We tried to more substantively
lill in the curriculum fora more
natural progression ... to build a
ladder from introduction to ad
vanced," said Political Science
Prof . Morris Fiorina.
The other major change was an

increase in undergraduate course
offerings, especially those at the in
termediate level. A total of 31 new
courses were added, of which
three were introductory, 14 inter
mediate, four advanced, and 10
were advanced courses available to
both undergraduates and gradu
ate students.
For example, the department
added the 120 series, three inter
mediate courses in American poli
tics. The series is team-taught by
six professors, including Fiorina
and Terry Moe.
"We need[ed] more non-intro
courses for students in politics, and
something that [was] coherent"
Moe said about Stanford's previous
American politics offerings.
The addition of new courses
has been popular with students,
according to Director of Under
graduate Studies in Political Sci
ence Michael McFaul.
"A lot of students come to me
with feedback... saying that there
are way more courses on more in
teresting topics than there were
before," he said. "It's both over
whelming and exciting for them."
Negative feedback about the
changes has been focused on the re
quirement that students must now
take not one but three out of the de
partment's four introductory
courses, offered in international re
lations, American politics, political
theory and comparative politics.
