# Poli Sci debuts more 'coherent' structure
## 
### KRISTEN BELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After undergoing a compre
hensive internal and external re
view last year, the Department of
Political Science has redesigned its
undergraduate curriculum to give
it a more coherent structure.
The most important change in
ihe department was the renum
bering of courses, which was done
"to try to make transparent t lie
logic of the undergraduate cur
riculum — students should have a
clear idea of where to start, where
to go from there, and where they
want to wind up," said Paul Sni
derman, Chair of the Department
of Political Science.
In reorganizing the curricu
lum, courses were divided into in
troductory, intermediate or ad
vanced levels. Now, courses num
bered one through 99 are intro
ductory, 100 through 199 are in
termediate, 200 through 299 are
advanced and 300 through 400
are advanced undergraduate and
graduate courses.
The only change faculty made
was to the graduate curriculum
was to renumber graduate courses
400 through 500.
"We tried to more substantively
lill in the curriculum fora more
natural progression ... to build a
ladder from introduction to ad
vanced," said Political Science
Prof . Morris Fiorina.
The other major change was an

increase in undergraduate course
offerings, especially those at the in
termediate level. A total of 31 new
courses were added, of which
three were introductory, 14 inter
mediate, four advanced, and 10
were advanced courses available to
both undergraduates and gradu
ate students.
For example, the department
added the 120 series, three inter
mediate courses in American poli
tics. The series is team-taught by
six professors, including Fiorina
and Terry Moe.
"We need[ed] more non-intro
courses for students in politics, and
something that [was] coherent"
Moe said about Stanford's previous
American politics offerings.
The addition of new courses
has been popular with students,
according to Director of Under
graduate Studies in Political Sci
ence Michael McFaul.
"A lot of students come to me
with feedback... saying that there
are way more courses on more in
teresting topics than there were
before," he said. "It's both over
whelming and exciting for them."
Negative feedback about the
changes has been focused on the re
quirement that students must now
take not one but three out of the de
partment's four introductory
courses, offered in international re
lations, American politics, political
theory and comparative politics.

"It is frustrating for some stu
dents," McFaul said. "But no one
ever likes more requirements."
Sophomore TG Falcon, who is
planning on declaring a political
science major, said the changes
are frustrating.
"The intro to intermediate to
advanced groupings are helpful,
but I find myself skipping around
a lot because I'm more advanced in
some areas than others," he said.
Falcon also found the new num
bering system of political science
courses to be confusing. He com
pared it to the numbering of build
ings in the Quad — "no one really
knows if there is a logical method to
it, but once you're comfortable with
it you know where everything is."
For example, the basic intro
duction to political science, Intro
to International Relations, used to
be numbered Political Science 35,
but now it is Political Science 1.
Changes in the undergraduate
advising system were also made.
Sniderman said that the political
science advising system was altered
to be "more proactive in helping
students make connections with an
advisor and making sure those con
nections are maintained."
Changes in the political science
department will have "neutral"
implications for interdisciplinary
majors like IR, Sniderman said.
The changes were prompted
by the reviews the department
conducted over the past year — a
process that takes place every
seven or eight years.
According to faculty, the
process that led to the reorganiza
tion of the political science depart
ment has been both enjoyable and
rewarding.
"It was a terrific opportunity for
the Dean [of Humanities and Sci
ences] to get an idea of how the de
partment is doing and to stop and
take a look to see if there are things
that need to be taken care of and
that can be worked on," Snider
man said. "It was an opportunity
lor deliberation and reflection."
In addition to the internal re
view, an external review was con
ducted. An external review com

mittee, consisting of top-notch po
litical scientists from Harvard,
Yale, Northwestern, Princeton,
the University of Pennsylvania
and Boston University, came fora
two-day visit to Stanford.
" The committee recommend
ed continued aggressive hiring of
strong faculty, especially at the
mid-career stage," said Karen
Cook, cognizant dean of the social
sciences. "It also recommended a
number of changes in the under
graduate curriculum to improve
the quality of the organization of
courses. This effort was already
underway," she said.
The committee was also im
pressed by the high caliber of the
department's faculty.
Several faculty members agree
that their colleagues are the de
partment's strongest point.
"We have what I believe to be
the best political science faculty in
the world," said Political Science
Prof. David Laitin.
Asst. Political Science Prof.
Mike Tomz agreed about the cal
iber of faculty, but added that
prior to the reorganization, it was
difficult to know who would offer
what courses when.
"Great faculty, but they were
not coordinated," he said. "Now
we've done a much better job of
coordinating."
The issue that needs the most
work not only at Stanford but in
political science departments
across the country, Laitin said, is
that "there is no generally accept
ed set of skills that is taught at the
introductory level and reinforced
in upper division courses."
He added, "Asa result, political
science majors take a potpourri of
interesting courses, but the whole
is not clearly greater than the sum
of its parts."
General consensus is that the
new course organization will help
address that problem.
"We should always be question
ing whether we are providing the
curricula that our students de
serve," Laitin said.
McFaul concurred that the new
organization is open to change.
"We're the political science de
partment, so presumably we be
lieve in democracy," he said. "I'm
hoping that students will help us
make the program better."
