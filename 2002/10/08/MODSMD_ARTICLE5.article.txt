# Israeli, Palestinian give joint talk
## By TAMAR LANDO 
### 
"We come in the name of peace
but in a time of great danger," said
Oren Yiftachel, in the opening min
utes of a lecture on the Middle East
conflict, hosted by the Stanford I lis
tory Department and sponsored by
the Faculty for Israeli-Palestinian
Peace. Yesterday's talk was part of a
lecture series given by Yiftachel, a
professor at BenGurion University
in Israel, and Rema Hammaini, an
assistant professor at Birzeit Uni
versity in the West Bank, who are
touring universities around the
United States.
Billed as an "Update on Israel
and Palestine: Two Scholars' Per
spectives," the lecture presented a
brief history of the Israeli-Palestin
ian conflict, starting with the incep
tion of the state of Israel in 1948,
with a loc us on the period leading
up to the current Intifada, or upris
ing. The two perspectives were
more nearly one: Yiftachel and
Hammaini were at pains to c reate
what Yiftachel called a joint Israeli-
Palestinian narrative, stating that
they were both pro-Palestinian and
pro-Israeli.
"The welfare of one [people],"

Yiftachel said, "depends on the wel
fare of the other."

Peace (ITIIT), while a relatively

Several Stanford faculty members
from the History and Philosophy
Departments have endorsed the or
ganization's appeals, calling on the
Israeli government to respect the
academic freedom of Palestinian
universities and, more specifically,
to stop "obstruction of academic ac -
tivities" at Birzeit University.
Birzeit was adversely affected by
the Surda roadblock, erected by Is
raeli authorities on May 29, 2002,
which blocked traffic from Ramal
lah, where many university teachers
and students reside.
The political agenda of the
FFIPP is, not let heless, nc >t very elab
orate. FFI Pl' chaws together faculty
with widely differing beliefs about
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and
ways to resolve it. The organiza
tion's mission statement endorses a
two-state solution, calling for an end
to Israeli rule in the occupied terri
tories and for the creation of a sepa
rate Palestinian state.
But frustration over what en

dorsers perceive as lethargy and
lack of commitment on the part of
the U.S. government is often an
equally powerful motivation to join.
"The Bush administration gets
involved in the conflict only to the
extent that it affects the image of the
United States," said Ahmad Dallal,
associate professor of history.
"For the current administra
tion, this is a public-relations
issue," he added. "As long as it
doesn't get completely out of
hand, they let things be. When it
gets too ugly, they diffuse the ten
sion slightly, but they don't have a
vision fora solution."

lecture.
"We need reform in the Palestin
ian Authority," Hammami said,
"but we need an end to occupation
much more powerfully."
"Sharon wants to destroy [the
Oslo accords] and the possibility for
a Palestinian state," Hammami con
tinued, echoing concerns that have
become especially prominent over
the past couple weeks, with the Is

raeli demolition of parts of Arafat's
compound in Ramallah. The demo
lition came just days after the Pales
tinian Legislative Assembly had
forced Arafat's cabinet to resign, in a
move that was widely seen as an ef
fort at reform.
Members of the international
community blamed Sharon for ob
structing reform efforts with the
timing of the demolition.
Arafat's biggest mistake, Ham
mami said, was not taking respon
sibility for the current uprising â€”
deciding not to lead it. If he had
led it, she explained, the Oslo

process would have been dead
and there would have been a re
turn to the Palestinian national
liberation struggle. Instead,
Arafat allowed leadership to de
volve to the Palestinian Liberation
Organization factions. While
maintaining that Arafat should
have led the Intifada, Hammami
claimed she was not in favor of vi
olence on either side.
The speakers were at a consen
sus, although somewhat vague, on
how best to move forward. They
called for an international inter
vention force and an American
presence not linked to U.S. inter
ests in Iraq and the war on terror
ism. An end to suicide bombings,
I lammami claimed, would allow
the Israelis to rethink the Israeli
government's handling of the
Palestinian uprising.
"For Palestinians, what's needed
is a real change on the ground,"
Hammami said. She called explicit
ly for an end to settlement building
and the lifting of curfews imposed
on the occupied territories by Is
raeli authorities.
The end-game solution, howev
er, was left open.
Yiftachel presented several pos
sibilities for the resolution of the
conflict, but stopped short of en
dorsing a single alternative. In an
interview after the lecture, howev
er, Yiftachel said that while he sup

ports the creation of a separate
Palestinian state in the immediate
future, he thinks that eventually the
two peoples will come together
under a single political entity.
This long-term solution is one
that hasn't yet made it into the polit
ical mainstream. Widely known as
the single-state solution, it calls for
the creation of a bi-national, democ
ratic suite encompassing the pre
sent-day state of Israel as well as the
occupied territories.
The solution was first proposed
in the 1920s and '30s and has re
cently made a comeback of sorts,
particularly among Palestinians
who feel that the political separa
tion of the two peoples is unwork
able. Many Israelis are, in turn,
fearful that such a move would an
nihilate the Jewish character of the
state of Israel.
The lecture drew a crowd of
roughly 65 people, including facul
ty members, students and non-Stan
ford affiliates. The tameness in the
audience may well have been a testi
mony to the spirit in which the two
speakers came together to discuss
the issues.
"The very fact that they're not
speaking as two opposed factions, but
are thinking together on this issue is
what's important," Dallal said. "They
represent a minority view, but there
are still some people out there willing
to do this soil of thing."

lecture.
"We need reform in the Palestin
ian Authority," Hammami said,
"but we need an end to occupation
much more powerfully."
"Sharon wants to destroy [the
Oslo accords] and the possibility for
a Palestinian state," Hammami con
tinued, echoing concerns that have
become especially prominent over
the past couple weeks, with the Is

raeli demolition of parts of Arafat's
compound in Ramallah. The demo
lition came just days after the Pales
tinian Legislative Assembly had
forced Arafat's cabinet to resign, in a
move that was widely seen as an ef
fort at reform.
Members of the international
community blamed Sharon for ob
structing reform efforts with the
timing of the demolition.
Arafat's biggest mistake, Ham
mami said, was not taking respon
sibility for the current uprising â€”
deciding not to lead it. If he had
led it, she explained, the Oslo

process would have been dead
and there would have been a re
turn to the Palestinian national
liberation struggle. Instead,
Arafat allowed leadership to de
volve to the Palestinian Liberation
Organization factions. While
maintaining that Arafat should
have led the Intifada, Hammami
claimed she was not in favor of vi
olence on either side.
The speakers were at a consen
sus, although somewhat vague, on
how best to move forward. They
called for an international inter
vention force and an American
presence not linked to U.S. inter
ests in Iraq and the war on terror
ism. An end to suicide bombings,
I lammami claimed, would allow
the Israelis to rethink the Israeli
government's handling of the
Palestinian uprising.
"For Palestinians, what's needed
is a real change on the ground,"
Hammami said. She called explicit
ly for an end to settlement building
and the lifting of curfews imposed
on the occupied territories by Is
raeli authorities.
The end-game solution, howev
er, was left open.
Yiftachel presented several pos
sibilities for the resolution of the
conflict, but stopped short of en
dorsing a single alternative. In an
interview after the lecture, howev
er, Yiftachel said that while he sup

ports the creation of a separate
Palestinian state in the immediate
future, he thinks that eventually the
two peoples will come together
under a single political entity.
This long-term solution is one
that hasn't yet made it into the polit
ical mainstream. Widely known as
the single-state solution, it calls for
the creation of a bi-national, democ
ratic suite encompassing the pre
sent-day state of Israel as well as the
occupied territories.
The solution was first proposed
in the 1920s and '30s and has re
cently made a comeback of sorts,
particularly among Palestinians
who feel that the political separa
tion of the two peoples is unwork
able. Many Israelis are, in turn,
fearful that such a move would an
nihilate the Jewish character of the
state of Israel.
The lecture drew a crowd of
roughly 65 people, including facul
ty members, students and non-Stan
ford affiliates. The tameness in the
audience may well have been a testi
mony to the spirit in which the two
speakers came together to discuss
the issues.
"The very fact that they're not
speaking as two opposed factions, but
are thinking together on this issue is
what's important," Dallal said. "They
represent a minority view, but there
are still some people out there willing
to do this soil of thing."

Palestinian professor Rema Hammami and Israeli professor Oren Yifrachel

Oren Yiftachel, in the opening min

Peace. Yesterday's talk was part of a
lecture series given by Yiftachel, a
professor at BenGurion University
in Israel, and Rema Hammaini, an
assistant professor at Birzeit Uni
versity in the West Bank, who are
touring universities around the
United States.
Billed as an "Update on Israel
and Palestine: Two Scholars' Per
spectives," the lecture presented a
brief history of the Israeli-Palestin
ian conflict, starting with the incep
tion of the state of Israel in 1948,
with a loc us on the period leading
up to the current Intifada, or upris
ing. The two perspectives were
more nearly one: Yiftachel and
Hammaini were at pains to c reate
what Yiftachel called a joint Israeli-
Palestinian narrative, stating that
they were both pro-Palestinian and
pro-Israeli.
"The welfare of one [people],"

Yiftachel said, "depends on the wel
fare of the other."
