# Israeli, Palestinian give joint talk
## By TAMAR LANDO

"We come in the name of peace
but in a time of great danger," said
Oren Yiftachel, in the opening min
utes of a lecture on the Middle East
conflict, hosted by the Stanford I lis
tory Department and sponsored by
the Faculty for Israeli-Palestinian
Peace. Yesterday's talk was part of a
lecture series given by Yiftachel, a
professor at BenGurion University
in Israel, and Rema Hammaini, an
assistant professor at Birzeit Uni
versity in the West Bank, who are
touring universities around the
United States.
Billed as an "Update on Israel
and Palestine: Two Scholars' Per
spectives," the lecture presented a
brief history of the Israeli-Palestin
ian conflict, starting with the incep
tion of the state of Israel in 1948,
with a loc us on the period leading
up to the current Intifada, or upris
ing. The two perspectives were
more nearly one: Yiftachel and
Hammaini were at pains to c reate
what Yiftachel called a joint Israeli-
Palestinian narrative, stating that
they were both pro-Palestinian and
pro-Israeli.
"The welfare of one [people],"

Yiftachel said, "depends on the wel
fare of the other."
Faculty for Israeli-Palestinian
Peace (ITIIT), while a relatively
young organization, boasts an im
pressive list of faculty endorsers.
Several Stanford faculty members
from the History and Philosophy
Departments have endorsed the or
ganization's appeals, calling on the
Israeli government to respect the
academic freedom of Palestinian
universities and, more specifically,
to stop "obstruction of academic ac -
tivities" at Birzeit University.
Birzeit was adversely affected by
the Surda roadblock, erected by Is
raeli authorities on May 29, 2002,
which blocked traffic from Ramal
lah, where many university teachers
and students reside.
The political agenda of the
FFIPP is, not let heless, nc >t very elab
orate. FFI Pl' chaws together faculty
with widely differing beliefs about
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and
ways to resolve it. The organiza
tion's mission statement endorses a
two-state solution, calling for an end
to Israeli rule in the occupied terri
tories and for the creation of a sepa
rate Palestinian state.
But frustration over what en

dorsers perceive as lethargy and
lack of commitment on the part of
the U.S. government is often an
equally powerful motivation to join.
"The Bush administration gets
involved in the conflict only to the
extent that it affects the image of the
United States," said Ahmad Dallal,
associate professor of history.
"For the current administra
tion, this is a public-relations
issue," he added. "As long as it
doesn't get completely out of
hand, they let things be. When it
gets too ugly, they diffuse the ten
sion slightly, but they don't have a
vision fora solution."
Rega Wood is a research pro
fessor in the Philosophy Depart
ment who recently became an en
dorser of the FFll'P. She said she
thought the regional powers
would not be able to arrive at
peace on their own, given the cur
rent leadership situation.
"I would think that our govern
ment could play a constructive role,
and anything that prompted them
to do so would he good," she said.
Neither party of the Middle East
conflict escaped criticism at today's

Waiting in vain
Stanford Labor Action Coalition members organized a surprise protest outside President Hennessy's office
yesterday to deliver a letter calling for greater University action on labor issues, only to discover he wasn't in.
