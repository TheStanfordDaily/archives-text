## Bush calls Hussein 'murderous tyrant' 
### 
CINCINNATI (AP) — President
Bush, seeking support for war against
Iraq, called Saddam Hussein a "mur
derous tyrant" yesterday night and
said he may be plotting to attack the
United States with biological and
chemical weapons.
Saddam and his "nuclear holy war
riors" are also building a nuclear
weapons program and could have a
nuclear weapon in less than a year,
Bush said in prime-time address.
"If we allow that to happen, a terrible
line would be crossed," the president
told civic group leaders at the Cincin
nati Museum Center. "Saddam Hus
sein would he in a position to blackmail
anyone who opposes his aggression."
"1 am not willing to stake one Amer
ican life on trusting Saddam Hussein,"
Bush said.
I lis address opened a week of debate
in Congress over resolutions giving the
president authority to wage war against
Iraq. The House and Senate planned
votes for Thursday, and the Bush
backed resolution was expected to pass
by wide margins.
Still, doubts lingered at home and
abroad about Bush's plans.
Even as he spoke, new polls revealed
lingering unease among voters about
going to war, particularly if casualties
were high or lighting distracted atten
tion from America's sagging economy.
Democrats criticized Bush's insistence
upon confronting Iraq alone if the
United Nations failed to act.
Bush hopes an overwhelming vote
in Congress will persuade reluctant al
lies in the United Nations to adopt a

tough new resolution forcing Saddam
to disarm — by force, if necessary.
The president said U.S. intelligence
shows Iraq to be building manned and
unmanned aerial vehicles that could be
used to target the United States with
chemical or biological weapons.
He said Iraq had trained members
of Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida terror
ist group, and that a "very senior al-
Qaida leader" has received medical
treatment in Baghdad.
"Iraq could decide on any given day
to provide a biological or chemical
weapon to a terrorist group or individ
ual terrorists," Bush said. "Alliances
with terrorists could allow the Iraqi
regime to attack America without leav
ing any fingerprints."
On the anniversary of the first U.S.
airstrikes in Afghanistan, Bush tried to
explain why Iraq should be the next
front in the war on terror. He hoped
to dispel doubts of domestic critics and
to persuade other nations to support a
U.N. resolution ordering Iraq to sub
mit to tough new weapons inspections.
Advisers said the biggest questions
Bush hoped to answer were: Why now?
Why Iraq?
"While there are many dangers in
the world, the threat from Iraq stands
alone because it gathers the most seri
ous dangers of our age in one place,"
Bush said. "Iraq's weapons of mass de
struction are controlled by a murderous
tyrant, who has already used chemical
weapons to kill thousand of people."
"By its past and present actions, by
its technological capabilities, by the
merciless nature of its regime, Iraq is

unique," Bush said.
The address was loaded with politi
cal implications, coming four weeks be
fore the Nov. 5 congressional elections
that will determine control of the
House and Senate.
While Bush's job approval rating re
mains high, a new CBS-New York
Times poll showed that a solid majority
of Americans believe he should give
U.N. weapons inspectors time to act.
More than one-third of Americans
fear the economy will get worse if the
United States attacks Iraq, and half
think military action against Iraq would
increase the risk of terrorist attacks.
On the nuclear threat, Bush said

Saddam has called numerous meetings
with his "nuclear mujahedeen — his
nuclear holy warriors," and satellite
photographs show that Iraq is rebuild
ing sites that have been part of his nu
clear program in the past.
Bush asserted that Iraq could have a
nuclear weapon in less than a year, al
though U.S. intelligence agencies is
sued a report on Friday placing the
timeframe at 2010.
"Knowing these realities, America
must not ignore the threat gathering
against us. Facing clear evidence of peril,
we cannot wait for the final proof— the
smoking gun — that could come in the
form of a mushroom cloud," Bush said.

Bush hopes an overwhelming vote
in Congress will persuade reluctant al
lies in the United Nations to adopt a

tough new resolution forcing Saddam
to disarm — by force, if necessary.
The president said U.S. intelligence
shows Iraq to be building manned and
unmanned aerial vehicles that could be
used to target the United States with
chemical or biological weapons.
He said Iraq had trained members
of Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida terror
ist group, and that a "very senior al-
Qaida leader" has received medical
treatment in Baghdad.
"Iraq could decide on any given day
to provide a biological or chemical
weapon to a terrorist group or individ
ual terrorists," Bush said. "Alliances
with terrorists could allow the Iraqi
regime to attack America without leav
ing any fingerprints."
On the anniversary of the first U.S.
airstrikes in Afghanistan, Bush tried to
explain why Iraq should be the next
front in the war on terror. He hoped
to dispel doubts of domestic critics and
to persuade other nations to support a
U.N. resolution ordering Iraq to sub
mit to tough new weapons inspections.
Advisers said the biggest questions
Bush hoped to answer were: Why now?
Why Iraq?
"While there are many dangers in
the world, the threat from Iraq stands
alone because it gathers the most seri
ous dangers of our age in one place,"
Bush said. "Iraq's weapons of mass de
struction are controlled by a murderous
tyrant, who has already used chemical
weapons to kill thousand of people."
"By its past and present actions, by
its technological capabilities, by the
merciless nature of its regime, Iraq is

unique," Bush said.
The address was loaded with politi
cal implications, coming four weeks be
fore the Nov. 5 congressional elections
that will determine control of the
House and Senate.
While Bush's job approval rating re
mains high, a new CBS-New York
Times poll showed that a solid majority
of Americans believe he should give
U.N. weapons inspectors time to act.
More than one-third of Americans
fear the economy will get worse if the
United States attacks Iraq, and half
think military action against Iraq would
increase the risk of terrorist attacks.
On the nuclear threat, Bush said

Saddam has called numerous meetings
with his "nuclear mujahedeen — his
nuclear holy warriors," and satellite
photographs show that Iraq is rebuild
ing sites that have been part of his nu
clear program in the past.
Bush asserted that Iraq could have a
nuclear weapon in less than a year, al
though U.S. intelligence agencies is
sued a report on Friday placing the
timeframe at 2010.
"Knowing these realities, America
must not ignore the threat gathering
against us. Facing clear evidence of peril,
we cannot wait for the final proof— the
smoking gun — that could come in the
form of a mushroom cloud," Bush said.
