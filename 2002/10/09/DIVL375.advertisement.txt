Daniel Pearl, the Wall Street Journal reporter who lost his life to terrorists in Pakistan, was not only a journalist but
also an avid musician who carried his mission of dialogue through words and music in all his travels. In every city
he lived, he joined a band, orchestra or chamber group and made new friends through his passion for music, friend
ship and humanity. The Daniel Pearl Foundation (www.danielpearl.org) is encouraging a celebration of Danny's
birthday, Oct. 10, by music-making worldwide. Stanford will join musicians around the globe in honoring Daniel
Pearl Music Day.
Daniel Pearl graduated from Stanford in 1985 with a bachelor's degree in communication. At a memorial at Stanford
last winter, Danny's classmates remembered him as a magnificent violinist, whose music and writing both reflected,
"precision, intensity, soulfulness, gentleness, compassion from within."
