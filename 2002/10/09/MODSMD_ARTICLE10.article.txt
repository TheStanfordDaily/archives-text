# Police, rebels fight in Medillin

BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) â€” Heavily armed po
lice in tanks and on foot raided one of Medellin's
most dangerous neighborhoods yesterday in an el
fort to regain control from leftist rebels and their ri
vals, the right-wing paramilitaries.
Terrified residents told reporters that at least
three members of the two illegal groups were killed
yesterday in gunfights in Comuna 13. Police said
they could not confirm the report.
Police searched residents and authorities are
considering imposing a curfew in the neighbor
hood, officials said.
The fighting in Medellin broke out Saturday
when three rebels were killed and five police offi
cers injured in another neighborhood. On Mon
day, suspected rebels used a bus to block the only
road leading into Comuna 13. Police moved the
bus yesterday.

Rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia, or FARC, and members of various
paramilitary organizations are fighting for con
trol of Medellin, Colombia's second-largest city
with 2 million residents. The pitched battles
erupted last year, marking what some say was a
new phase in Colombia's long-running civil war:
urban warfare. The 38-year conflict has largely
been fought in the countryside.
Medellin has a bloody history, however, as the
center of drug cartel wars waged in the 1980s and
early 1990s when hundreds of hired gunmen
roamed the city.
The right-wing militias originally sprang up to
protect landowners from kidnapping by leftist
rebels. But their fight spread to other parts of
Colombia and they have been accused of some of
the worst atrocities in the civil war.
