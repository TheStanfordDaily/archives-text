# Weapons tests to be released today

WASH INCHON (AP) — The
United States held open-air bio
logical and chemical weapons
tests in at least four states — Alas
ka, Hawaii, Maryland and Mori
da — during the 1960s in an ef
fort to develop defenses against
such weapons, according to Pen
tagon documents.
A series of tests in Alaska from
1965-67 used artillery shells and
bombs filled with the nerve agents
sarin and VX, the records show.
The Defense Department
planned to release summaries of
28 chemical and biological
weapons tests at a House Veterans
Affairs Committee hearing today.
The Associated Press obtained the
summaries yesterday.
The documents did not say
whether any civilians had been ex
posed to the poisons. Military per
sonnel exposed to weapons agents

would have worn protective gear,
the Pentagon says.
The Pentagon previously ac
knowledged that it had conducted
biological and chemical tests, but
this was the first time it disclosed
that some tests were conducted
over land and not out at sea.
The tests were part of Project
112, a military program in the
1960s and 1970s to test chemical
and biological weapons and de
fenses against them. Parts of the
testing program done on Navy
ships were called Project SHAD, or
Shipboard Hazard and Defense.
The tests were directed from
the Deseret Test Center, part of a
biological and chemical weapons
complex in the Utah desert.
Some of those involved in the
tests say they now suffer health
problems linked to their exposure
to dangerous chemicals and

germs. They are pressing the Vet
erans Affairs Department to com
pensate them and the Defense De
partment to release more informa
tion about the tests.
In response to pressure from
veterans and Congress, the Penta
gon began releasing details of the
tests last year. Earlier this year, the
Defense Department acknowl
edged for the first time that some
of the 1960s tests used real chemi
cal and biological weapons, not
just benign stand-ins.
"The Cold War era experi
ments of Project SHAD, which we
are now learning used live toxins
and chemical poisons on American
servicemen on American soil, must
be aggressively investigated in as
open and transparent a manner as
possible," said the House Veterans
Affairs Committee chairman, Rep.
Chris Smith, R-N.J.
