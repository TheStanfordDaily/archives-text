## The 						Stanford Daily Campus Watch stifles freedom of expression 
### 
Published Since 1891

Stanford, like all American academic
institutions, should be a place where
differences of opinion are accepted
and examined. Unfortunately, a new
organization created to target "anti-Israel" bias
in universities is threatening freedom of ex
pression at Stanford and other colleges across
the United States.
Campus Watch, an organization founded by
Daniel Pipes, head of the Philadelphia-based
Middle East Forum, recently placed Stanford
among 18 American universities labeled for
holding "anti-Israel" views. Furthermore, on
the Campus Watch Web site, Pipes has posted
dossiers on professors who he believes hold
"extremist viewpoints" on the Middle East. We
not only resent Pipes' McCarthy-style tactics,
but we also believe he is dead wrong for target-

ing Stanford for having an "anti-Israel and
anti-American" bias.
To label Stanford in this way is completely
inaccurate. Stanford has a number of profes
sors who offer different perspectives on Israel
and the Middle East. In addition, Stanford's
Taube Center for Jewish Studies is very well
regarded and covers all facets of the Jewish ex
perience, including Jewish history, literature,
language, religion and politics. And, in regards
to the violence in the Middle East, last year,
members of the Stanford community held
peaceful demonstrations and counter-demon
strations, which presented both narratives of
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Campus Watch is just an attempt by Pipes to
quiet voices in American academia that clearly
differ from his own. For example, Pipes re

cently stated, "I want Noam Chomsky to be
taught at universities about as much as I want
Hitler's writing or Stalin's writing .... These
are wild and extremist ideas that I believe have
no place in a university." While Pipes has the
right to disagree with Chomsky or any other
professor, universities like Stanford should be
open to a variety of perspectives.
Campus Watch monitors professors who
"reject the views of most Americans and the en
during policies of the U.S. government about
the Middle East," according to Pipes. But what
is more un-American: expressing beliefs that
scrutinize the U.S. or Israeli government's
policies, or trying to regulate professors who
hold these beliefs? Dissenting from the views of
the U.S. government is as American as apple
pie and allows American students to think crit-

ically, instead of blindly following policies of
their government. American universities
should be more frightened by the likes of
Pipes, who try to limit freedom of expression,
than by any professor who criticizes the U.S. or
Israeli government.
What is even more dangerous about Cam
pus Watch is the intolerant effect it has had on
the professors it is watching. Professors listed
on the site have been spammed with tens of
thousands of racist, obscene and threatening e
mails. One has even reportedly received death
threats over the phone.
No professor should be treated this way sim
ply for his / her beliefs. Luckily, at Stanford, we
respect diversity of opinion.
So, Campus Watch, this is one campus that
you definitely don't have to watch.
