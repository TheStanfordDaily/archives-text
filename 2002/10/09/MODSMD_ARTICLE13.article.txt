## An old-fashioned duel: Dubya against Saddam 
### JOSH SOHN GUEST COLUMNIST 
I can't believe it. Last week, the Iraqi
government handed the Bush administra
tion a perfect solution to this whole mess it
has gotten itself into. In fact, the Iraqis
handed it to Bush on a silver platter, with
a little bow tied around it, labeled "Express
Rush Delivery." And the Bushies com
pletely dropped the ball.
I'm referring to Iraqi Vice-President
Taha Yassin Ramadan's offer to have Bush
and Saddam settle their differences in a
good old-fashioned duel to the death. Ra
madan suggested that such a duel could be
conducted in a neutral site under the aus
pices of the United Nations and claimed
that a Bush-Saddam standoff would be
much more efficient and humane than a
full-scale U.S. invasion of Iraq.
Incredibly, White House spokesman
Ari Fleischer immediately rejected this
offer, stating that it was "not worthy of a se
rious response." I've never been im
pressed with Fleischer's eloquence or in
tellect, but this was a boneheaded state
ment even for him. From Bush's perspec
tive, a duel with Saddam would be ideal.
First of all, let's do a quick scouting re
port on the two opponents, to assess
Bush's chances of winning this hypotheti
cal contest. In one corner, we have the De
fender of the Free World. He's a very fit
56-year-old, who runs and lifts weights al
most ever)' day. He doesn't smoke or
drink, and his resting pulse is that of a man
half his age. just as importantly, Bush is a
good ol' Texas boy. Maybe he's not John
Wayne, but there's no doubt the man
knows how to shoot.
In the other corner, we have the Evil
Tyrant. Saddam Hussein is 65 years old,
and he's not a healthy 65 at that. He
smokes and drinks, he's a bit overweight,
and there have been very reliable reports
that he suffered a stroke several years
ago and has at least some permanent loss
of function.
Needless to say, Bush's chances look
pretty good. If I were a betting man, I'd
take the Prez in a heartbeat.
Moreover, a duel would have over
whelming domestic support, which the
proposed invasion lacks. Judging from

public opinion on Stanford's campus, I
would guess that even the most intense,
crunchy-granola peacenik from Colum
bae would approve of Saddam catching a
.45 bullet in the chest. And even the most
rabid, war-mongering Hoover fellow
would gladly keep our bombers on the
ground, if we could achieve our main ob
jective with a single, well-placed shot.
That brings up the larger issue: Would
killing Saddam change anything? You
could make the argument that with Sad
dam's death, one of his sons or lieutenants
would seize power, and there would be no
substantial change in the Iraqi regime.
I lowever, it's important to appreciate
Saddam Hussein's personal role in main
taining the Iraqi dictatorship. The man
has a rare blend of cunning, political savvy
and a brutal streak that would make Attila
the Hun cringe. He has had to exploit
these gifts in order to remain dictator over
a polyglot, disenfranchised and unhappy
population. It's very unlikely that Sad
dam's successor would possess his unique
skills. In other words, if Bush blows Sad
dam a new you-know-what, the Iraqi
regime might simply crumble.
On the other hand, if Bush somehow
loses, (he United States would still be all
right. The great thing about liberal
democracies is that their survival isn't tied
to a single individual. A Bush loss would
mean that we'd have to deal with the un
pleasant prospect of President Cheney,
but we could withstand even that.
So I urge you, Mr. President, to saddle
up the horse, ride into Dodge and take on
the evil villain at high noon on Main
Street. You'll have the advantages of age,
health and the full support of the greatest
nation on earth. If you win, you'll be a leg
end, not to mention a shoo-in for reelec
tion in 2004. If you lose, you'll at least have
the satisfaction of dying in a blaze ofglory,
for the noblest of causes.
lake up the challenge, Mr. President.
You've been against gun control your
whole life. Don't holster your six-shooter
now that you have a worthy opportunity
to use it.
