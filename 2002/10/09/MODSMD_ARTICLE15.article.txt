Cine Arts is a popular venue
In the Sept. 19 article "An Artsy Alter
native," it's great to see the treasured art
house cinemas of the area spotlighted.
However, it's apparent the writer has
never been to the Cine Arts Palo Alto
Square. The assertion that this theater has
uncomfortable seats and second rate pro
jection and sound is absurd. And perhaps
the writer should stop by this theater on a
Friday or Saturday night before claiming
that the citizens of Palo Alto and the
Peninsula are not flocking to this venue.

The importance of being a straight ally
As National Coming Out Day ap
proaches (this Friday), it's important for
the Stanford community to understand
how homophobia affects straight people
and some of the ways in which straight al
lies can help combat homophobia. The
following lists are adapted from GSA Net
work (gsanetwork.org), an organization
that will be present to answer any ques
tions at the LGBT-CRC's National dom
ing Out Day kick-off party at 9 p.m.
Thursday in the Old Fire Truck House.
Five ways homophobia affects straight
people:
1. 1 lomophobia forces us to act "macho" if
we are a man or "feminine" if we are a
woman. This limits our individuality
and self-expression, makes it harder to
appreciate the uniqueness of traits that

are not "normal" or mainstream and
can hurt a straight person if they are
perceived to be gay.
2. Homophobia causes youth to become
sexually active before they are ready in
order to prove they are "normal." This
can lead to an increase in unwanted
pregnancies and STDs.
3. Homophobia makes it hard to be close
friends with someone of the same sex.
4. 1 lomophobia puts pressure on straight
people to act aggressively and angrily
towards [lesbian, gay, bisexual or trans
gender] people, makes it hard for
straight people and [lesbian, gay, bisex
ual or transgender] people to be
friends and often strains family and
community relationships.
5. Homophobia prevents vital informa
tion on sex and sexuality from being
taught in schools. Without this infor
mation, youth put themselves at a
greater risk for HIV and other STDs.
Along with racism, sexism, classism and
so on, homophobia makes it harder to
put an end to AIDS.
Five ways straight allies can fight homo
phobia:
1. Interrupt or correct anti-[lesbian, gay,
bisexual or transgender] jokes, com
ments and slurs, or any other behavior
that makes homophobia appear okay.
2. I'm an "I Support Queer Rights" sign
on your door, or display or wear other
signs, shirts or buttons that promote
tolerance.
3. Bring up [lesbian, gay, bisexual and
transgender] issues iti conversations
with friends or discussions in class, so

that your [lesbian, gay, bisexual and
transgender] friend or classmate
doesn't always have to be the one to il
lustrate why gender or sexuality is rele
vant to the topic at hand. Organize dis
cussion groups after class to talk about
the ways in which homophobia affects
straight people.
4. Don't assume that "feminine-acting"
men and "masculine-acting" women
are not heterosexual, or that "macho"
men or "feminine" women are hetero
sexual.
5. Always use gender-neutral labels like
"partner" or "significant other," in
stead of "boyfriend," "girlfriend" and
so on, when writing papers or talking
to others.
