# New German film rings similar to Stanford experiment
## Das
						Experiment 
### BILL BOWEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In the recently released German lilm "Das Exper
iment," audiences sit back and watch a psychology ex
periment gone horribly wrong. The drama is alleged
ly based on the events of the Stanford Prison Experi
ment, conducted in the psychology department back
in 1971 —an event that some Stanford researchers
would rather downplay than glamorize.
The film, directed by Oliver I lirschbiegel, is based
on the novel "Black Box" by Mario Giordano. It fol
lows the experience of several volunteers fora psy
chological experiment on prison life where men are
randomly assigned to be prisoners or guards in a
mock prison created on a university campus. During
the film, interactions among prisoners, guards and
researchers becomes progressively more violent, cul
minating iu incidents of rape and murder.
In order to make the film seem closer to reality,
the original version opened with an introduction say
ing the story was inspired by incidents that occurred
in a psychological study at Stanford University. Stan
ford lawyers succeeded in making the producers re
move the introduction, arguing that the film pre
sented a distorted and sensationalized picture of the
actual experiment by including incidents which did
not occur and which unfairly demonize researchers
in psychology.
The Stanford Prison Experiment and the experi
ment portrayed in the film do share certain similari
ties. flie setup of the two experiments is closely par
allel: a group of average, mentally healthy male col
lege students are given instructions to act as prisoners
or guards. Upon entering the prison, inmates are
subjected to a series of humiliations. They are
stripped naked and deloused, forced to wear plain
white robes with no underwear, and instructed to
refer to other prisoners only by number, not by name.
Most importantly, in both cases the experiment
spins out of control as the environment becomes
more brutal and authoritarian than researchers an
ticipated.
Although the real Stanford Prison Experiment was
to be run fora longer period of time, researchers
stopped the experiment after only a few days because
the situation became dangerous.
According to the Stanford Prison Experiment Web
site, "Our planned two-week investigation into the
psychology of prison life had to be ended premature
ly after only six days because of what the situation was
doing to the college students who participated.
"In only a few days, our guards became sadistic

and our prisoners became depressed and showed
signs of extreme stress."
The experiment in the film, however, greatly ex
aggerates the degree of violence between prisoners
and guards.
Though the Stanford Prison Experiment was
stopped because of ethical concerns, none of the stu
dents involved were killed or physically injured. In
"Das Experiment," the female scientist is raped by a
guard, and guards systematically torture and murder
prisoners before the film ends.
"There is no connection between any events in
'Das Experiment' and ( the Stanford Prison Experi
ment | after the first HO minutes of the film," said Psy
chology Prof. Philip Zimbardo, a lead researcher in
the SPE. "But they want the audience to believe there
is [a connection] — that the sex and violence really
happened in the SPE."
According to Zimbardo, the inclusion of these ele
ments in the film stems from a sensationalist desire to
sell violence rather than discourage it.
Zimbardo argues that the film also misrepresents
bowse ientists would react toasituation like the Prison
Experiment by ignoring the ethical constraints they
self-impose on experimentation. For example, in the
film the male psychologist leaves the experiment
when it is getting out of control. According to Zim
bardo, this would never happen in any experiment.
Yet the controversy in tlie real Stanford Prison
arises from the fad that the ethical bounds of'social sci
entific investigation had not been clearly defined. In
many ways, the experiment brought into question the
ability of scientific experiments to get beyond the abil
ity of highly involved researchers to control them.
To illustrate the degree to which he became
wrapped up in the experiment, Zimbardo describes
his initial reaction to a colleague who questioned it at
tlie time: "Here I had a prison break on my hands.
The security of my men and the stability of iny prison
was at stake, and now, I had to deal with this bleeding
heart, liberal, academic, effete dingdong who was
concerned about the independent variable!
"It wasn't until much later that I realized how far
into my prison role 1 was at that point, that I was
thinking like a prison superintendent rather than a
research psychologist."
The real experiment was also only stopped after
Christina Maslach, a graduate student who was
brought in to conduct interviews with the guards, be
came outraged at what was happening to the prison
ers. Zimbardo explains, "Out of 50 or more outsiders
