# Forum focuses on hapa issues

### NATALIE AHN CONTRIBUTING WRTTER 
Students of Asian, Pacific Is
lander, African, Latin American,
European and other mixed-race
descent met over icecream yester
day evening in the Okada lounge
to get acquainted, discuss multira
cial issues and find out about the
Hapa Issues Forum's plans for the
coining year.
About 30 students attended this
third annual kickoffof the HIF, a
student group to promote aware
ness of hapa issues and provide a
community for students of mixed
race, or for any students interested
in those issues. As used by the
forum, the term "hapa" refers to
anyone of partial Asian or Pacific
Islander ancestry, but it derives
from a Hawaiian term which
meant "half-foreigner." The group
focuses on issues of mixed API
background but also includes stu
dents and issues from other ethnic
mixes.
"11l F provides a space in which
people of multiethnic API her
itage can feel comfortable dis
cussing their backgrounds and
experiences," said senior Jaci
Lew, the president of 11 IF. "Even
more significantly, perhaps, HIF
makes being hapa, or being mul
tiracial, visible to both hapas and
the Stanford community at large.
By doing so, we can educate the
community about the fluidity of
racial categories."
Lew started the meeting with in
troductions of the core staff and
their plans for this year. They will
repeat past events such as dinners
and talks, a freshman welcome re
treat, a high school workshop and
a spring quarter student-initiated
course on hapa identity. They also
have new projects including a jour
nal of student essays, poetry and
art, and an internship program.
Then Lew had the attendees in
troduce themselves. Students
mentioned different Asian, white,
black, Latino and other back

grounds. They also mentioned
some of the ethnic identities they
have been mistaken tor, including
being spoken to in another lan
guage such as Spanish even if they
had noconnection to the language.
"Even if we haven't had the
same experience, there are going
to be a lot of stories that are the
same,'' said junior Adriane Gam
ble. "Anything from the 'what are
you?' questions, to the daily cultur
al mixing in our homes, to the
racism we've experienced."

and Issues Chair.
Students were then broken up
into small groups to discuss anec
dotes, personal experiences with
their backgrounds and their
thoughts on mixed-race issues.
They talked about other peoples'
expectations, being singled out by
more homogenous groups, and
stereotypes of hapas as exotic
women. The actual issues students
felt they faced differed greatly de
pending on their experiences.
"I wanted to see if they could
come up with meaningful activities
and if there are enough issues to
drive a discussion," said freshman

Aaron Ligon. He had friends who
started a mixed-race organization
in high school but said they found
a lac k of things to clo, and that
"[hapa] issues didn't affect me very
much."
Others were excited because
they hadn't experienced orga
nized hapa interaction before.
"I thought it was amazing that
there was a group of half-Asians,"
said freshman Stephanie Sud.
" I here are lot <)f experiences that
are common tobiracial people. I'm
excited about it."
Senior Amanda Rang, the 11 IF
community chair, expressed the
challenge of these different views
of hapa issues. "What is a hapa
community, and what does it look
like, this is always a big question,"
Rang said. She noted that mixed
race students have diverse experi
ences and origins.
"We really want to branch out
and be multiracial and not just
focus on Asian backgrounds,"
Rang said, "but that adds com
plexity."
She said the group plans to
reach out to other communities
this year to make that possible.
