but fortunately for the Cardinal,

won't show up in the conference
standings.

Friday: Stanford 5, St. Louis 0
Saturday: SW Missouri St. 2, Stanford 1
Monday: Stanford 4, St. Louis 3

Stanford went on the road to take
on Northern Pacific Athletic Con
ference foe Saint Louis twice this
past weekend, beating the Billikens
5-0 on Friday and 4-3 on Monday.
The Cardinal also played SW
Missouri State in St. Louis in non
conference action on Saturday,
losing 2-1.
Stanford moved to 8-7 overall
and stayed an undefeated 4-0 in

the NorPac. With its two confer
ence wins over Billikens (1-9,
NorPac), the Cardinal maintained
its No. 1 spot in the NorPac, witli a
full-game lead over No. 10 Califor
nia (7-3, 2-0). The Cardinal faces
off against its perennial loeCal this
Saturday in a NorPac showdown at
Berkeley.
The team feels last weekend's
road trip was a good warmup for
I his Saturday's game.
" The team learned a lot on this
road trip, and we will work on the
areas we need to improve on (his
week before the Big (lame," said se
nior Christina Williams. "Most im
portantly, we are still undefeated in
conference play and that is great
going into the game against (>al this
weekend. It is a big game for the
team, and it will be a good test play
ingat their new turf field. Cal always
has a lot of rowdy fans, and it will be
good to have to play through that
and just focus on the game."
The Cardinal, which has had
trouble putting the ball in the back
of the net this year, seemed to have
passed that hurdle in the first
game against Saint Louis, scoring
twice in the first five minutes. Se
nior Amrit Chima, who leads the

team in points with 17, scored
twice in the game.
junior forward Keely Mach
mer-Wessels had three assists, as
Stanford outshot Saint Louis IIS-4.
As it turned out, Stanford
hadn't completely shaken its pre
vious scoring woes, which came
back to haunt the team in its game
against SW Missouri State. Fol
lowing its trend all season, the
Cardinal outshot its opponent 15-
7 but could not convert its scoring
opportunities.
" The SW Missouri State game
was disappointing," Williams said,
"fl hey are] a good team, and they
played a very physical game. They
scored two goals in the first half , and
we did not capitalize on our oppor
tunities. We did not play Stanford
field hockey. But you always learn
more from a loss, and we learned
that there are areas in our game
that we still need to work on."
Right out of the gate in Mon
day's contest against Saint Louis,
senior forward Amanda Billmyer
looked to end Stanford's goal
scoring troubles.
In the first 10 minutes of the
game, Billmyer scored twice, with
the goals coming within two min-

utes of each other. Billmyer scored
again in the first half to pick up the
first hat trick of her career.
However, Saint Louis looked
menacing in the game, scoring
twice in tFie first half and tying up
the game 3-3 with 13:00 to play.

Less than a minute later, Mach
mer-Wessels, put in the game
winner.
Freshman goalkeeper Ana
Kralovec, who was named the
NorPac Rookie of the Week for
the second time this season,

shined over the weekend. She has
posted four scoreless halves and
has combined with junior net
minder Emily Zander for six
shutouts this season. Kralovec
has played in 12 games overall,
recording 27 saves.
