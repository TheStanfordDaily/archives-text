# Football prepares for Washington St.
## Stanford looks to regroup after 31-7 loss to Notre Dame 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN STAFF WRITER 
On Saturday, the Cardinal (1-
3, 0-1 Pacific-10 Conference)
played excellent football for the
first 30 minutes.
Now the squad just has to work
on those last 18 minutes.
Stanford lost 31-7 to No. 8
Notre Dame at South Bend after
leading 7-3 going into the second
half, marking the first halftime
deficit that the Irish has faced all
season. But in a stretch of three
Cardinal drives, the Irish had
three interceptions all leading to
scores. Suddenly, the game was
out of reach and the Irish had their
fifth win on the season.
"The weekend was frustrating,"
Stanford coach Buddy Teevens
said. "We came out and played well
the first 30 minutes. 1 thought on
both sides of the football we had
opportunities."
The Cardinal was plagued by its
worst enemy: turnovers.
"The turnover situation contin
ues to haunt us," Teevens said.
"We need to find a way to elimi

nate them by making good deci
sions and retaining possession of
the football and not giving people
the opportunity to put quick
points on the boards as we did."
Quarterback Chris Lewis' three
picks on Saturday now give Stan
ford quarterbacks 12 interceptions
in the season's first four games.
Regardless, Teevens stands by
Lewis as his starting man.
"Chris Lewis will be our starter
(Saturday) and Kyle [Matter] is
waiting in the wings," Teevens
said. "Chris showed some very
positive things that we had not
seen prior to Saturday. The op
portunity to play an entire game
was a plus for him."
Teevens added that "[Lewis']
mindset was very positive yesterday.
We worked out briefly last night and
1 thought he was very effective with
what we asked him to do."
However, the redshirt fresh
man Matter is still pushing Lewis
for playing time.
"Kyle is very attentive and
sharp mentally," Teevens said.
Stanford needs to work 011
other aspects of its game before
Saturday's game against No. 12
Washington State (5-1, 2-0).
Against Notre Dame, the Cardi
nal rushed fora mere 01 yards,
t he leading rusher was senior
Kerry Carter, who rushed seven

times for 35 yards. For (he Cardi
nal to defeat the Cougars, it is
going to need better production
not only from Carter, but also
from freshman J. R. Lemon and se
nior fullback Casey Moore.
Despite the loss, the Stanford
players appear confident going
into Saturday's matchup at Stan
ford Stadium.
"We just got to keep at it," Lewis
said, " filings will work out for lis.
We are a young team, but still have
a lot of positives to look at. We're
going to work on coming out next
week and putting it behind us."
The team's spirit is also buoyed
because last week was the first time

it has been able to play with both
Carter and All-American junior re
ceiver Luke Powell since the sea
son opener at Boston College.
On defense, the Cardinal will
have to prepare this week fora
heavy pass attack, as the Cougars
are led by Heisman Trophy candi
date quarterback Jason Gesser.
"They throw the ball an awful
lot, any time, any place, any situa
tion," Teevens said. "The thing that
really impresses me about Jason
Gesser is that he's a three-year se
lection as captain. That is pretty
telling in terms of leadership."
The game is the first of a two
game homestand for the Cardinal.
