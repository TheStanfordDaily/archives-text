# Working out in 'Ya Ya' land doesn't fly

### 
One of my most disap
pointing moments of an
otherwise fantastic
Admit Weekend trip to
Stanford four years ago occurred
when I visited the Arrillaga athletic
facilities and saw the sinkhole of a
gym located in the catacombs of an

otherwise beauti
ful building.
I was told, bow
ever, that there
were several gyms
loeated on campus
in addition to the
less-than-stellar fa
cilities located in
Arrillaga, and I
mistakenly as-

sumed that an liber-rich university
that prides itself almost to a fault on
its athletic prowess would naturally
accommodate the athletic needs of
its undergraduate population.
Those additional gyms, to my
personal abhorrence, were Roble
Gym and Tresidder Fitness. When
1 attempted to workout in Roble, I
realized that I probably shouldn't
attempt to lift anything before get
ting a Tetanus shot to prevent the
rust from the decades-old weights
from giving me lockjaw. I he equip
ment, what there was of it, was so
old it was actually starting to appre
ciate in value amid a flurry of in
quiries by the Cairo Museum of

Natural History and the Smithson
ian Institute.
So after enduring my lone work
out with machines that made
Sylvester Stallone's setup in "Rcxky
V" look like Gold's Gym at Venice
Beach, I wandered over to Tresid
der Fitness. Once inside, I was so
overcome by the complete domina
tion ofStainnastersand orbital ma
chines and lack of free weights that
1 felt as if I should have brought a
box of Tampax, a copy of "Secrets
of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood," and come
prepared to talk about my feelings.
Not to mention that the entire floor
was covered in filth since Tresidder
services more sweat-dripping bod
ies then the campus soft-serve ma
chines serve freshman girls.
So I was st tic k with Arrillaga for
(lie past three years and was slowly
but surely coming to accept this
cruel fact of life until I was unpleas
antly surprised by the changes
made over the summer. The big
stretching mat was removed, the
wall-mounted pull-up bars done
away with and a capacity restriction
rivaling a large elevator was put
into place.
I low in the world am I, or any
other health conscious student,
supposed to blast my lats and go
agio on my abs without pull-up
