for the InterCollegiate Sailing Association's Nation
al Singlehanded Championships. Kven with strong
competition from 21 sailors hailing from schools all
along tlie Pacific Coast, Haines, a top recruit for the
team, secured one of two berths for the upcoming
competition.
Haines was pleased with his success but was not
expecting such a winning performance.
"There's not much pressure being a freshman,"
Haines explained. "I was confident that 1 could do
well, but 1 knew qualifying in the top two would be
tough."
I laines' assessment of the competition was based
on history, as he had sailed against many of the com
petitors in previous regattas, such as Southern Cali
fornia's Mikee Anderson, who sailed with Haines in
high school. Anderson placed fourth in the event.
California hosted the qualifier, which for the past
two years has been won by Stanford senior Dave

Kenny. This year, coach Jay Kehoe said Kenny, who
placed sixth, was "instrumental to Brian's success,"
and noted that the individually-oriented event
didn't seem to ailed team camaraderie.
"It was great to see the team work together, even
for singlehanded competition," Kehoe said.
Haines is also enjoying the close-knit nature of
the sailing team.
" The whole team is really nice," he said. "We've
been having a really good time together."
Three sailors represented Stanford in the top 10,
with sophomore Jell Allen joining Haines and
Kenny by placing 10th in the event. Sophomore
Andy Mesher took 21st.
Haines will participate at the Singlehanded Na
tionals, to be hosted by Texas in Houston, Nov. 8 to
Nov. 10. He will compete against 15 other sailors
who also placed well in their respective qualifiers.
"I'm really excited about going back to Houston,"
Haines said. To prepare for the event, Haines ex
plained that he would have to "be in the laser as
much as I can," rather than the KJs in which most of
his teammates will work. The young sailor hopes to
perform well at nationals and is looking forward to
the event."I think it's a really good opportunity to
do this as a freshman," he said.
The women's sailing team suffered some 112 rustrat
ing incidents early on in the Women's Singlehanded
Pacific: Coast Championships, but finished solidly.
