for the InterCollegiate Sailing Association's Nation
al Singlehanded Championships. Kven with strong
competition from 21 sailors hailing from schools all
along tlie Pacific Coast, Haines, a top recruit for the
team, secured one of two berths for the upcoming
competition.
Haines was pleased with his success but was not
expecting such a winning performance.
"There's not much pressure being a freshman,"
Haines explained. "I was confident that 1 could do
well, but 1 knew qualifying in the top two would be
tough."
I laines' assessment of the competition was based
on history, as he had sailed against many of the com
petitors in previous regattas, such as Southern Cali
fornia's Mikee Anderson, who sailed with Haines in
high school. Anderson placed fourth in the event.
California hosted the qualifier, which for the past
two years has been won by Stanford senior Dave

Kenny. This year, coach Jay Kehoe said Kenny, who
placed sixth, was "instrumental to Brian's success,"
and noted that the individually-oriented event
didn't seem to ailed team camaraderie.
"It was great to see the team work together, even
for singlehanded competition," Kehoe said.
Haines is also enjoying the close-knit nature of
the sailing team.
" The whole team is really nice," he said. "We've
been having a really good time together."
Three sailors represented Stanford in the top 10,
with sophomore Jell Allen joining Haines and
Kenny by placing 10th in the event. Sophomore
Andy Mesher took 21st.
Haines will participate at the Singlehanded Na
tionals, to be hosted by Texas in Houston, Nov. 8 to
Nov. 10. He will compete against 15 other sailors
who also placed well in their respective qualifiers.
"I'm really excited about going back to Houston,"
Haines said. To prepare for the event, Haines ex
plained that he would have to "be in the laser as
much as I can," rather than the KJs in which most of
his teammates will work. The young sailor hopes to
perform well at nationals and is looking forward to
the event."I think it's a really good opportunity to
do this as a freshman," he said.
The women's sailing team suffered some 112 rustrat
ing incidents early on in the Women's Singlehanded
Pacific: Coast Championships, but finished solidly.

Junior Jennifer Porter and sophomore Jessie Duncan sail in last weekend's Bryson Women's Regatta at Stanford. The
Cardinal finished in sixth place overall and will travel East this weekend for the Navy Women's Regatta.
In fact, the Cardinal was the only
team to boast two sailors in the
top five.
Junior Ashley Frush, who
placed first at this event last year,
sought a repeat performance that
would be good enough to earn
her a berth at nationals again.
However, in her first two races
she placed a disappointing ninth
and 14th.
Even so, Kehoe explained that
"Ashley improved throughout
the day," finishing the remainder
of her races in the top 10 to place
fourth overall.
junior Liz Shearer, who spent
her summer at regional and
world competitions, also hoped to
gain a place at nationals. Howev
er, she too missed out, placing
fifth overall after winning her last
race.
Kehoe admitted that while his
team was "unable to dominate
this event," its remarkable finish
with two sailors in the top five
"shows the incredible depth to
our women's team."
The women also competed at
their home regatta, the Bryson's
Women's Regatta, this past week
end. The competition takes its
name in memory of Stanford
alumna Rebecca Bryson's ('9l) la
ther, Bruce.
Junior Jen Porter and sopho

more Jessie Duncan composed
Stanford's A-team, while the B
team consisted of Shearer and ju
nior Margia Corner. Stanford was
in third after the first day.
Stanford decided to split its
squad this weekend so the women
could have one day oil between
competitions. Because Stanford
sailors didn't hit the water until
Sunday, they were unprepared
for the light air conditions on the
weekend. Their performances re
flected the handicap, as the A
team of Frush and junior Shadi
Mehraein earned a 7,8,7 and 5 in
each of its four races respectively,
and the B-team of freshmen Liz
Rountree and Megan Heinen
scored a 5, 5, 3 and 1. The first
place finish provided an uplifting
end to the event and earned Stan
lord second place in the B-divi
sion.
Stanford sailing is gearing up
for important regattas over the
next several weekends.
"The next four weeks are re
ally the meat-and-potatoes of
our season," explained Kehoe,
citing the PCC and the Single
handed Championships in par
ticular. The women are current
ly preparing for the Navy
Women's regatta this Friday
through Sunday.
Kehoe reminds those who may
be interested in sailing for Stan
lord that the team is "always look
ing for walk-ons," reminding
prospective athletes, "we are a fall
and spring sport like crew."

Stanford decided to split its
squad this weekend so the women
could have one day oil between
competitions. Because Stanford
sailors didn't hit the water until
Sunday, they were unprepared
for the light air conditions on the
weekend. Their performances re
flected the handicap, as the A
team of Frush and junior Shadi
Mehraein earned a 7,8,7 and 5 in
each of its four races respectively,
and the B-team of freshmen Liz
Rountree and Megan Heinen
scored a 5, 5, 3 and 1. The first
place finish provided an uplifting
end to the event and earned Stan
lord second place in the B-divi
sion.
Stanford sailing is gearing up
for important regattas over the
next several weekends.
"The next four weeks are re
ally the meat-and-potatoes of
our season," explained Kehoe,
citing the PCC and the Single
handed Championships in par
ticular. The women are current
ly preparing for the Navy
Women's regatta this Friday
through Sunday.
Kehoe reminds those who may
be interested in sailing for Stan
lord that the team is "always look
ing for walk-ons," reminding
prospective athletes, "we are a fall
and spring sport like crew."

for the InterCollegiate Sailing Association's Nation
al Singlehanded Championships. Kven with strong
competition from 21 sailors hailing from schools all
along tlie Pacific Coast, Haines, a top recruit for the
team, secured one of two berths for the upcoming
competition.
Haines was pleased with his success but was not
expecting such a winning performance.
"There's not much pressure being a freshman,"
Haines explained. "I was confident that 1 could do
well, but 1 knew qualifying in the top two would be
tough."
I laines' assessment of the competition was based
on history, as he had sailed against many of the com
petitors in previous regattas, such as Southern Cali
fornia's Mikee Anderson, who sailed with Haines in
high school. Anderson placed fourth in the event.
California hosted the qualifier, which for the past
two years has been won by Stanford senior Dave

Kenny. This year, coach Jay Kehoe said Kenny, who
placed sixth, was "instrumental to Brian's success,"
and noted that the individually-oriented event
didn't seem to ailed team camaraderie.
"It was great to see the team work together, even
for singlehanded competition," Kehoe said.
Haines is also enjoying the close-knit nature of
the sailing team.
" The whole team is really nice," he said. "We've
been having a really good time together."
Three sailors represented Stanford in the top 10,
with sophomore Jell Allen joining Haines and
Kenny by placing 10th in the event. Sophomore
Andy Mesher took 21st.
Haines will participate at the Singlehanded Na
tionals, to be hosted by Texas in Houston, Nov. 8 to
Nov. 10. He will compete against 15 other sailors
who also placed well in their respective qualifiers.
"I'm really excited about going back to Houston,"
Haines said. To prepare for the event, Haines ex
plained that he would have to "be in the laser as
much as I can," rather than the KJs in which most of
his teammates will work. The young sailor hopes to
perform well at nationals and is looking forward to
the event."I think it's a really good opportunity to
do this as a freshman," he said.
The women's sailing team suffered some 112 rustrat
ing incidents early on in the Women's Singlehanded
Pacific: Coast Championships, but finished solidly.

Junior Jennifer Porter and sophomore Jessie Duncan sail in last weekend's Bryson Women's Regatta at Stanford. The
Cardinal finished in sixth place overall and will travel East this weekend for the Navy Women's Regatta.
In fact, the Cardinal was the only
team to boast two sailors in the
top five.
Junior Ashley Frush, who
placed first at this event last year,
sought a repeat performance that
would be good enough to earn
her a berth at nationals again.
However, in her first two races
she placed a disappointing ninth
and 14th.
Even so, Kehoe explained that
"Ashley improved throughout
the day," finishing the remainder
of her races in the top 10 to place
fourth overall.
junior Liz Shearer, who spent
her summer at regional and
world competitions, also hoped to
gain a place at nationals. Howev
er, she too missed out, placing
fifth overall after winning her last
race.
Kehoe admitted that while his
team was "unable to dominate
this event," its remarkable finish
with two sailors in the top five
"shows the incredible depth to
our women's team."
The women also competed at
their home regatta, the Bryson's
Women's Regatta, this past week
end. The competition takes its
name in memory of Stanford
alumna Rebecca Bryson's ('9l) la
