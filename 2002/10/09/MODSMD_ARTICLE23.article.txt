## DJs spin to latest technology beats Record, CD and computer-based platforms dominate music mixing technology 
### ANDREW ARDINGER 
Standing behind a table bedecked
with spinning vinyl, switchboards and
speakers, the disc jockey is a familiar
sight for partygoers, club hoppers and
John Cusack fans.
Behind the dancing and techno
beats, a skilled professional uses the
latest in music technology to keep the
party going.
Aided by several recent technologi
cal advances, DJs can now choose
among record, CD or computer-based
sound platforms to mix their music.
At its most basic level, this evolving
art form, known as turntablism, still re
volves around turntables and vinyl.
Though there are many brands on the
market, the most popular turntables
are made by Technics.
"I have the standard Technics
1200," said freshman DJ Kevin Sys
trom. "It's the most popular one only
because it's the most widely used."
He noted that unlike most turnta
bles on the market, "these retain their
value over the years," and despite the
cost ($4OO-$500), the Technics table
can be a safe investment if one decides
to quit jockeying.
In recent years, other DJs have
turned to using CD-based platforms
for their music mixing. Though initial
ly slow to win converts, CD-based mix

ing systems have increased exponen
tially the amount of music available at a
given time to the disc jockey.
Howard Loo, Class of 1998 and an
aspiring DJ, found the Pioneer CD)
1000 model to be one of the most pop
ular of this newer medium.
"There's been similar [players] to
this in the past, but nothing has done
[what it can do]," Loo said. "It's good;
so good [that] DJs are switching over."
The Pioneer system and other
models work in much the same way a
traditional table functions. There are
two CD input drives and a wheel on
the top of the set that lets the user
control the position and tempo of
each song. Popular in many Bay Area
clubs, these systems generally range
in price from a few hundred dollars
to $1000.
"It used to be all vinyl in the I) J com
munity," Systrom said. "But the bigger
names [now] use both; a lot of inde
pendent artists can't afford to make
vinyl out of their music. . .so they
burn a CD to give to DJs."
Despite the new popularity of CD
based systems, many DJs value the aes
thetic nature of traditional mixing.
For Systrom, the showmanship and
feel of mixing records holds a certain
mystique.
"I was presented with [the] option
[to use CDs]," he said. "But.. . there's
just something about using vinyl that
makes it so much more hands-on and
so much more of an art form than CDs
where it's all digital."
While Systrom prefers his Technics
1200s to newer CD mixers, he con

cedes that a lot of the future of elec -
tronic music mixing will take place on
computers.
"The revolutions are coming in how
you produce music on computers
where you can make it sound really
good," he said.
Freshman Albert Lin has never
used the more established systems,
opting instead to hone his skills on
computers. Using software review
databases such as C-Net, Lin found
out about DJ Traktor Mixer and BPM
Studio, two programs that simulate a
regular D J setup with two music chan
nels and a mixing board.
Unlike turntables, which require the
to manually cue the needles and
match the tempos of the distinct songs,
the computer programs perform these
functions automatically. Lin also noted
that Traktor and BPM enable the user
to easily add effects that would be next
to impossible with regular turntables,
such as adding extra sound clips or re
stricting the audio playback to a certain
range.
The newest generation of turntable
technology combines records, CDs and
computers. A record-size disc called
"Vinyl Scratch" sits on the turntable
and allows the DJ to perform manual
scratching of computer-based music
files. Loo notes that this is "still very,
very obscure."
While computer programs and CD
based mixers have jumped in popular
ity owing to their limited cost and easi
er learning curve, the consensus is that
turntables will remain the heart of
music mixing.

1200," said freshman DJ Kevin Sys
trom. "It's the most popular one only
because it's the most widely used."
He noted that unlike most turnta
bles on the market, "these retain their
value over the years," and despite the
cost ($4OO-$500), the Technics table
can be a safe investment if one decides
to quit jockeying.
In recent years, other DJs have
turned to using CD-based platforms
for their music mixing. Though initial
ly slow to win converts, CD-based mix

ing systems have increased exponen
tially the amount of music available at a
given time to the disc jockey.
Howard Loo, Class of 1998 and an
aspiring DJ, found the Pioneer CD)
1000 model to be one of the most pop
ular of this newer medium.
"There's been similar [players] to
this in the past, but nothing has done
[what it can do]," Loo said. "It's good;
so good [that] DJs are switching over."
The Pioneer system and other
models work in much the same way a
traditional table functions. There are
two CD input drives and a wheel on
the top of the set that lets the user
control the position and tempo of
each song. Popular in many Bay Area
clubs, these systems generally range
in price from a few hundred dollars
to $1000.
"It used to be all vinyl in the I) J com
munity," Systrom said. "But the bigger
names [now] use both; a lot of inde
pendent artists can't afford to make
vinyl out of their music. . .so they
burn a CD to give to DJs."
Despite the new popularity of CD
based systems, many DJs value the aes
thetic nature of traditional mixing.
For Systrom, the showmanship and
feel of mixing records holds a certain
mystique.
"I was presented with [the] option
[to use CDs]," he said. "But.. . there's
just something about using vinyl that
makes it so much more hands-on and
so much more of an art form than CDs
where it's all digital."
While Systrom prefers his Technics
1200s to newer CD mixers, he con

cedes that a lot of the future of elec -
tronic music mixing will take place on
computers.
"The revolutions are coming in how
you produce music on computers
where you can make it sound really
good," he said.
Freshman Albert Lin has never
used the more established systems,
opting instead to hone his skills on
computers. Using software review
databases such as C-Net, Lin found
out about DJ Traktor Mixer and BPM
Studio, two programs that simulate a
regular D J setup with two music chan
nels and a mixing board.
Unlike turntables, which require the
to manually cue the needles and
match the tempos of the distinct songs,
the computer programs perform these
functions automatically. Lin also noted
that Traktor and BPM enable the user
to easily add effects that would be next
to impossible with regular turntables,
such as adding extra sound clips or re
stricting the audio playback to a certain
range.
The newest generation of turntable
technology combines records, CDs and
computers. A record-size disc called
"Vinyl Scratch" sits on the turntable
and allows the DJ to perform manual
scratching of computer-based music
files. Loo notes that this is "still very,
very obscure."
While computer programs and CD
based mixers have jumped in popular
ity owing to their limited cost and easi
er learning curve, the consensus is that
turntables will remain the heart of
music mixing.
