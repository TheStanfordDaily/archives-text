# Stanford heightens computer security

"Imagine if someone was try
ing to break into your house six
minutes after you moved in, rat
tling the attic, the crawlspace,"
said C led Bennett, director of
Stanford's Information Security
Services. "That's what happens to
your computer whenever you
hook it up to a network."
Bennett was commenting on
the Sept. 18 proposal by the
White House to create national
strategies to secure cyberspace.
The report outlined a variety of
initiatives, mostly voluntary, to
encourage everyone who uses
the Internet to make security a
priority.
Among the recommended ini
tiatives in the White 1 louse cyber
security draft report are stronger
security infrastructure for federal
government networks, use of fire
walls and anti-virus software for
home users and increased shar
ing of security information
among corporal ions.
The most important new fed
eral focus is raising individual
awareness, an effort that Bennett
compared to the campaign to in
still I seatbelts in cars.
"Now, no one drives any
where without a seatbelt, but that
used to be just a recommenda
tion," he said.
Even before the conceited na
tional initiative, Stanford has
been increasing computer sec uri
ty in exactly the ways the govern
ment report recommended.

Securing Stanford is a massive
project, much more than the six
employees of the Information Se
curity Services Department can
handle. Every computer is a po
tential security threat and every
user endangers the network. In
total, the University dedicates
more than 50 employees to ad
dress computer security issues.
But Bennett does not believe
this is nearly enough.
"Our goal is eventually to get
everyone to understand that they
should lock the door fto their
computer], and computer securi
ty should be as instinctive as lock
ing your car," he said.
On the Internet, every com
puter plays a role in security, and
any unsecure computer can be
come a vehicle fora malicious at
tack. Some computer problems,
such as Nimda worm and the"I
Love You" virus are just a few ex
amples of what hackers can do
with automated code and unse
cure computers. I n its cybersecu
rity draft report, the White 1 lonse
estimates "the cost of cyber attacks
resulting from malicious code
could have been $13 billion in the
year 2001."
With thousands of users con
stantly connected, Stanford's
computer network represents a
miniature version of the prob
lems facing the nation.
Last year, Information Securi
ty Services handled approximate
ly 2,200 security related incidents,
