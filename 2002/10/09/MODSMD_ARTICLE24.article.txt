# Stanford heightens computer security

"Imagine if someone was try
ing to break into your house six
minutes after you moved in, rat
tling the attic, the crawlspace,"
said C led Bennett, director of
Stanford's Information Security
Services. "That's what happens to
your computer whenever you
hook it up to a network."
Bennett was commenting on
the Sept. 18 proposal by the
White House to create national
strategies to secure cyberspace.
The report outlined a variety of
initiatives, mostly voluntary, to
encourage everyone who uses
the Internet to make security a
priority.
Among the recommended ini
tiatives in the White 1 louse cyber
security draft report are stronger
security infrastructure for federal
government networks, use of fire
walls and anti-virus software for
home users and increased shar
ing of security information
among corporal ions.
The most important new fed
eral focus is raising individual
awareness, an effort that Bennett
compared to the campaign to in
still I seatbelts in cars.
"Now, no one drives any
where without a seatbelt, but that
used to be just a recommenda
tion," he said.
Even before the conceited na
tional initiative, Stanford has
been increasing computer sec uri
ty in exactly the ways the govern
ment report recommended.

Securing Stanford is a massive
project, much more than the six
employees of the Information Se
curity Services Department can
handle. Every computer is a po
tential security threat and every
user endangers the network. In
total, the University dedicates
more than 50 employees to ad
dress computer security issues.
But Bennett does not believe
this is nearly enough.
"Our goal is eventually to get
everyone to understand that they
should lock the door fto their
computer], and computer securi
ty should be as instinctive as lock
ing your car," he said.
On the Internet, every com
puter plays a role in security, and
any unsecure computer can be
come a vehicle fora malicious at
tack. Some computer problems,
such as Nimda worm and the"I
Love You" virus are just a few ex
amples of what hackers can do
with automated code and unse
cure computers. I n its cybersecu
rity draft report, the White 1 lonse
estimates "the cost of cyber attacks
resulting from malicious code
could have been $13 billion in the
year 2001."
With thousands of users con
stantly connected, Stanford's
computer network represents a
miniature version of the prob
lems facing the nation.
Last year, Information Securi
ty Services handled approximate
ly 2,200 security related incidents,

many of those dealing with copy
right infringement and harassment,
but a significant minority involving
computer intrusions.
In a scan of 3,000 computers on
campus, more than 400 were found
to be vulnerable to intrusion
through either weak passwords or
incorrect setup. "We try to proac
tively scan computers to prevent se
curity problems before they hap
pen," said Bennett.
Information Security works with
Residential Computing to inform
users, especially new students,
about basic security precautions.
"The simplest thing to do is set a
good password. Otherwise you are
going to be attacked. It's not a mat
ter of if, but when," Bennett said.
" That's not all there is to security.
There are bugs in software,, weak
nesses in software, but at least it
makes it that much less likelv that a

hacker will attack a computer if the
computer is up-to-date and has
strong passwords."
The White House report also
calls for extensive information shar
ing among all sectors, especially uni
versities. Stanford is already there
on that front, according to Bennett.
He cited frequent collaboration
with Ivy League universities and
UG-Berkeley on security issues.
"We could improve our rapid re
sponse, and some of the measures
are not easy to implement, like a 24-
hour security contact," said Ben
nett, "but real-time data sharing al
ready happens, and not just in the
university sector."
While the cybersecurity draft re
port was prompted by the threat of
terrorist attacks, Bennett does not
see Stanford as a target for terror
ism. He does see an increasing num
ber of both malicious and non-mali
cious hacking occurring in the fu
ture. 1 fe compared computer hack
ing to prank calls that children
make, but he acknowledged that
there is some computer crime that

poses a threat and that threat will
only increase.
" Fhe Internet is a great resource,
one we have come to rely on, but it's
still the Wild West," he said.
Though some have criticized the
Bush administration for not enforc
ing the recommendations, Bennett
sees the draft report as a necessary
first step.
"Give corporations and universi
ties a chance to regulate themselves
first," he said. "The legislation will
be passed eventually and it's better
to give the country a chance to think
over the proper level of regulation."
fhe caveat, Bennett noted, is
that if cyberterrorism is the threat
that the Bush administration makes
it out to be, then more should be
done to secure all aspects of the In
ternet. However, with the federal
government taking the lead in
making security a priority, corpora
tions, and eventually regular com
puter users will begin to under
stand how important it is to lock
everything up and secure their be
longings in cyberspace.
