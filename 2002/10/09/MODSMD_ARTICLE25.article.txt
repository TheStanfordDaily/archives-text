# New cell phones let you do more than ever
##

NEW YORK (AP) — Everything is tight in
the cell phone industry.
The market is nearly saturated. Talk is
cheap, literally: Someone is always stealing cus
tomers by offering more minutes for less
money. Wireless carriers would like to consoli
date, but the industry is entangled in debt and
shackled to incompatible network systems.
So how are cell phone companies trying to
fight the squeeze? By squeezing more stuff onto
cell phones.
Digital pictures, instant messaging, Web ac
cess, e-mail, downloads of cutesy icons, elabo
rate ring tones and tons of video games — any
thing that lets people save time or kill time, as
some in the industry put it, is being crammed
onto phones in hopes that consumers will pay
for it.
Whether it will work — or turn out to be the
next big money-draining bust for the industry
— remains to be seen.
"The idea is, 'Let's see what we can throw on
the wall and see what sticks," said Ken Hyers, se
nior wireless analyst for Cahners In-Stat. "Car
riers are trying desperately to figure out a way to
prop up sagging revenue."
Verizon Wireless is hoping fora bounce from
its new "Get It Now" service, which lets people
download dozens of ring tones and video games

directly over the air.
The downloads start at 99 cents — and
suck up airtime. Playing the games doesn't
use any minutes. But Verizon hopes that
users someday will want to play games head
to-head over the network against friends,
which would sap airtime.
Other new cell phones have camera attach
ments that let users take digital pictures and
send them to other phones or e-mail addresses.
Sprint PCS, which recently surprised analysts by
announcing its customer base actually shrunk,
now plans to sell models with the camera al
ready included.
Mindful that messaging and photo services
on cell phones have proven highly popular
among youths in Asia and Europe, Sprint is try
ing to show Americans through ads and
brochures all the cool things their phones can
do, spokesman Dan Wilinsky said.
"We're not seeing people beat the doors
down for this," he acknowledged. "But it's more
of a long-term play."
It also is a gamble.
ÜBS Warburg analyst LJberto Ferrari be
lieves telecom companies should worry about a
future in which too many customers just want to
make cheap phone calls and disdain full pack
ages of data services.

Ferrari compares that scenario to the one
gripping another expensive field to operate in,
the airline industry, where just about the only
players turning a profit are discount carriers.
Full-service airlines that offer meals and other
costly perks can't charge much of a premium for
them because of intense competition, creating a
money-losing model.
"Too many bread rolls and your returns
head south," Ferrari wrote in a recent research
note.
Similarly, if new mobile phone services fail to
truly excite the populace, wireless carriers that
are spending billions upgrading their networks
to make such options possible will remain pres
sured to keep prices low to compete with dis
count voice-only plans.
For now, many numbers don't look good.
Only 8 percent of cellular customers are def
initely interested in using their phone or anoth
er device to get wireless Internet access, accord
ing to a July survey by Solomon Wolff Associ
ates, a New Jersey-based market research firm.
The figure was 18 percent in January 2001.
That increases the pressure on people work
ing behind the scenes to develop new mobile
phone applications.
