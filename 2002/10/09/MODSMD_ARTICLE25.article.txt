# New cell phones let you do more than ever
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Everything is tight in
the cell phone industry.
The market is nearly saturated. Talk is
cheap, literally: Someone is always stealing cus
tomers by offering more minutes for less
money. Wireless carriers would like to consoli
date, but the industry is entangled in debt and
shackled to incompatible network systems.
So how are cell phone companies trying to
fight the squeeze? By squeezing more stuff onto
cell phones.
Digital pictures, instant messaging, Web ac
cess, e-mail, downloads of cutesy icons, elabo
rate ring tones and tons of video games — any
thing that lets people save time or kill time, as
some in the industry put it, is being crammed
onto phones in hopes that consumers will pay
for it.
Whether it will work — or turn out to be the
next big money-draining bust for the industry
— remains to be seen.
"The idea is, 'Let's see what we can throw on
the wall and see what sticks," said Ken Hyers, se
nior wireless analyst for Cahners In-Stat. "Car
riers are trying desperately to figure out a way to
prop up sagging revenue."
Verizon Wireless is hoping fora bounce from
its new "Get It Now" service, which lets people
download dozens of ring tones and video games

directly over the air.
The downloads start at 99 cents — and
suck up airtime. Playing the games doesn't
use any minutes. But Verizon hopes that
users someday will want to play games head
to-head over the network against friends,
which would sap airtime.
Other new cell phones have camera attach
ments that let users take digital pictures and
send them to other phones or e-mail addresses.
Sprint PCS, which recently surprised analysts by
announcing its customer base actually shrunk,
now plans to sell models with the camera al
ready included.
Mindful that messaging and photo services
on cell phones have proven highly popular
among youths in Asia and Europe, Sprint is try
ing to show Americans through ads and
brochures all the cool things their phones can
do, spokesman Dan Wilinsky said.
"We're not seeing people beat the doors
down for this," he acknowledged. "But it's more
of a long-term play."
It also is a gamble.
ÜBS Warburg analyst LJberto Ferrari be
lieves telecom companies should worry about a
future in which too many customers just want to
make cheap phone calls and disdain full pack
ages of data services.

Ferrari compares that scenario to the one
gripping another expensive field to operate in,
the airline industry, where just about the only
players turning a profit are discount carriers.
Full-service airlines that offer meals and other
costly perks can't charge much of a premium for
them because of intense competition, creating a
money-losing model.
"Too many bread rolls and your returns
head south," Ferrari wrote in a recent research
note.
Similarly, if new mobile phone services fail to
truly excite the populace, wireless carriers that
are spending billions upgrading their networks
to make such options possible will remain pres
sured to keep prices low to compete with dis
count voice-only plans.
For now, many numbers don't look good.
Only 8 percent of cellular customers are def
initely interested in using their phone or anoth
er device to get wireless Internet access, accord
ing to a July survey by Solomon Wolff Associ
ates, a New Jersey-based market research firm.
The figure was 18 percent in January 2001.
That increases the pressure on people work
ing behind the scenes to develop new mobile
phone applications.
Engineers at Qualcomm Inc.,
which invented one of the main cel
lular transmission standards, have
bet heavily on a technology they
developed called BREW, which
enables new wireless services like
Verizon's "Cet It Now" package to
be programmed and delivered.
Jason Kenagy, senior director of
product management, says cell
phone users in Japan are already
using location-based programs
that can map their position and ad
dresses they're seeking. Another
BREW application popular in
South Korea fuels an online dat
ing/chat service called Skylove.

Kenagy predicts improvements
soon iu the use of pictures to enliv
en SMS —short message service
— the quick text messages that can
be written and sent on wireless
phones. He called that a "low
hanging fruit" for American wire
less carriers because digital photog
raphy is already popular.
SMS is showing some signs of
catching on here — 19 percent of
cell phone owners use it, up from
13 percent last November, accord
ing to a survey Frank N. Magid X:
Associates did for Upoc Inc., a de
veloper of wireless applications.
But wireless companies still are
far from winning over people like
Jen ( >arson of Woodbridge, Vir
ginia.
Carson, 29, used to have a
Sprint PCS wireless phone and en

joyed being able to check e-mail on
it while waiting to pick up her
daughter at school. Since she
makes nearly all of her mobile calls
during business hours, she decided
she needed more daytime minutes.
When Sprint couldn't oiler a
plan she wanted at a price she was
willing to pay, Carson jumped to
Verizon. 1 ler new phone is a low
end model without e-mail but she's
line with that.
"It's all about minutes lor me,"
Carson said. "Who gives me the
best deal for my minutes?"
She was brielly jealous when
some friends excitedly showed her
new phones that could take and
send photos.
But "they got over it after the
first day," Carson said. "The pic
tures aren't so good."

Carson, 29, used to have a
Sprint PCS wireless phone and en

joyed being able to check e-mail on
it while waiting to pick up her
daughter at school. Since she
makes nearly all of her mobile calls
during business hours, she decided
she needed more daytime minutes.
When Sprint couldn't oiler a
plan she wanted at a price she was
willing to pay, Carson jumped to
Verizon. 1 ler new phone is a low
end model without e-mail but she's
line with that.
"It's all about minutes lor me,"
Carson said. "Who gives me the
best deal for my minutes?"
She was brielly jealous when
some friends excitedly showed her
new phones that could take and
send photos.

NEW YORK (AP) — Everything is tight in
the cell phone industry.
The market is nearly saturated. Talk is
cheap, literally: Someone is always stealing cus
tomers by offering more minutes for less
money. Wireless carriers would like to consoli
date, but the industry is entangled in debt and
shackled to incompatible network systems.
So how are cell phone companies trying to
fight the squeeze? By squeezing more stuff onto
cell phones.
Digital pictures, instant messaging, Web ac
cess, e-mail, downloads of cutesy icons, elabo
rate ring tones and tons of video games — any
thing that lets people save time or kill time, as
some in the industry put it, is being crammed
onto phones in hopes that consumers will pay
for it.
Whether it will work — or turn out to be the
next big money-draining bust for the industry
— remains to be seen.
"The idea is, 'Let's see what we can throw on
the wall and see what sticks," said Ken Hyers, se
nior wireless analyst for Cahners In-Stat. "Car
riers are trying desperately to figure out a way to
prop up sagging revenue."
Verizon Wireless is hoping fora bounce from
its new "Get It Now" service, which lets people
download dozens of ring tones and video games

directly over the air.
The downloads start at 99 cents — and
suck up airtime. Playing the games doesn't
use any minutes. But Verizon hopes that
users someday will want to play games head
to-head over the network against friends,
which would sap airtime.
Other new cell phones have camera attach
ments that let users take digital pictures and
send them to other phones or e-mail addresses.
Sprint PCS, which recently surprised analysts by
announcing its customer base actually shrunk,
now plans to sell models with the camera al
ready included.
Mindful that messaging and photo services
on cell phones have proven highly popular
among youths in Asia and Europe, Sprint is try
ing to show Americans through ads and
brochures all the cool things their phones can
do, spokesman Dan Wilinsky said.
"We're not seeing people beat the doors
down for this," he acknowledged. "But it's more
of a long-term play."
It also is a gamble.
ÜBS Warburg analyst LJberto Ferrari be
lieves telecom companies should worry about a
future in which too many customers just want to
make cheap phone calls and disdain full pack
ages of data services.

Ferrari compares that scenario to the one
gripping another expensive field to operate in,
the airline industry, where just about the only
players turning a profit are discount carriers.
Full-service airlines that offer meals and other
costly perks can't charge much of a premium for
them because of intense competition, creating a
money-losing model.
"Too many bread rolls and your returns
head south," Ferrari wrote in a recent research
note.
Similarly, if new mobile phone services fail to
truly excite the populace, wireless carriers that
are spending billions upgrading their networks
to make such options possible will remain pres
sured to keep prices low to compete with dis
count voice-only plans.
For now, many numbers don't look good.
Only 8 percent of cellular customers are def
initely interested in using their phone or anoth
er device to get wireless Internet access, accord
ing to a July survey by Solomon Wolff Associ
ates, a New Jersey-based market research firm.
The figure was 18 percent in January 2001.
That increases the pressure on people work
ing behind the scenes to develop new mobile
phone applications.
Engineers at Qualcomm Inc.,
which invented one of the main cel
lular transmission standards, have
bet heavily on a technology they
developed called BREW, which
enables new wireless services like
Verizon's "Cet It Now" package to
be programmed and delivered.
Jason Kenagy, senior director of
product management, says cell
phone users in Japan are already
using location-based programs
that can map their position and ad
dresses they're seeking. Another
BREW application popular in
South Korea fuels an online dat
ing/chat service called Skylove.
