Do hormone pills increase the chance of
cancer? About two months ago, the National In
stitutes of I lealth cancelled a nationwide study
on hormone therapy because it was might have
been correlated with breast cancer. Since then,
many researchers have come forward to agree
that the evidence is becoming increasingly
stronger. Yet there are some contradictions. A
study 0f9,000 women found that taking the l'ill
did not increase chances of breast cancer, re
gardless of the woman's age when she first took
the Pill, the length of time that she took it, the
dosage or her family medical history. The ver
dict is still out and most experts agree that, since
widespread use of the I'ill only began in the
19705, its effects on breast cancer will only be
come visible now and in the coming years.
In Bio4l, we learned that cell membranes
act as filters, letting in small particles and
blocking out big ones. This is not necessarily
true — there exists a certain type of reverse-se

lective membranes. These membranes operate
by dissolving the molecules into the matrix of
the cell. Since larger molecules condense more
quickly into liquid than smaller ones, they will
actually diffuse quicker to inside of the cell. A
team at the Menlo Park-based Membrane Tech
nology Research lias been able to speed up t lie
process by adding non-porous filter materials.
Instead of stopping filter holes, the material ac
tually increases the membrane's permeability to
large molecules. Reverse-selective membranes
could be used in the future to separate unwant
ed hydrocarbons from methane, which would
make exploitation of natural gas much more
cost-effective.
You've heard in the news that scientists have
synthesized the polio virus from DNA, but how
exactly did they do it? Polio is a RNA virus and
knowing that it is easier to assemble nucleic acids
into DNA than RNA, a team from State Univer
sity of New York at Stony Brook and University
of Columbia used enzymes to convert DNA
strands into RNA. After placing it into a mixture
similar to what polio would find in cell, they ob
served a full-fledged virus capable of infection.
But why did they create polio? The polio vims
has been long studied and its genetic code is
well-known. Moreover, most people have been
vaccinated against polio and it has been virtual
ly eradicated. The study's success is a major step
for science in developing the ability to create or
ganisms.
The Earth is bombarded daily by interstel
lar dust called micrometeorites. The most fa

mous and exotic type of star dust is nanodia
monds —very small carbon molecules in the
form of diamonds. A widely accepted theory
has proposed that these nanoparticles could
have only formed during very destructive
events, such as the cataclysmic death of large
stars called supernovae. According lo a study
published in Nature, some of the nanodia
monds may have actually been formed within
the solar system. The evidence is that many of
the meteorites formed before the solar system
do not contain nanodiamonds, whereas many
of the later ones do. The discovery raises
questions about our current model of galactic
dust transport and even the origin of our
solar system.
Talk about ecological disturbance. Two
years ago, a Maryland pet owner released two
northern snakeheads, a fish indigenous to
China, into a local pond. I lie snakehead is a
predator with a voracious appetite and can
grow up to three feet long. Now authorities
have found 99 snakeheads that have displaced
many native fish species. With the capability to
travel short distances on land using their fins,
snakeheads have prospered by traversing to a
river 75 yards away. State officials have set up a
scientific panel to investigate the problem. Yet
the situation reminds us of a lesson from the
past when English settlers introduced a rabbits
in Australia during the 1800s. Without natural
predators, the rabbits multiplied rapidly and
devastated crops until the government or
dered their extermination.
