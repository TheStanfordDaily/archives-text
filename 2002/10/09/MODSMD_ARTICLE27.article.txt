# Government targets high schoolers for drug, tobacco testing

VESTAVIAIIILLS, Ala. (AP) — Breath
mints won't cut it anymore for students
who have been smoking in the bathroom;
some schools around the country are ad
ministering urine tests to teenagers to find
out whether they have been using tobacco.
Opponents say such testing violates stu
dents' rights and can keep them out of the
extracurricular activities they need to stay
on track. But some advocates say smoking
in the boys' room is a tic ket to more serious
drug use.
"Some addicted drug users look back
to cigarettes as the start of it all," said
Jell McAlpin, director of marketing for
EDPM, a Birmingham drug-testing
company.
Short of catching them in the act, school
officials previously had no way of proving
students had been smoking.
resting students for drugs has spread
in recent years and was given a boost in

June when the U.S. Supreme Court af
firmed random testing of those in ex
tracurricular activities. Tobacco can easily
be added to the usual battery of tests.
"I agree with it," said 16-year-old Ves
tavia Hills Higli School junior Rosemary
Stafford, a member of the marching band.
"It's illegal, it's addictive. Maybe the pun
ishment shouldn't be as severe, but they
should test for it."
In Alabama, where the legal age for
purchasing and smoking tobacco prod
ucts is 19, about a dozen districts, mostly in
the Birmingham area, test for nicotine
along with alcohol and several illegal
drugs, including marijuana.
In most cases, the penalties for testing
positive (or cotinine — a metabolic by
product that remains in the body after
smoking or chewing tobacco — are the
same as those for illegal drugs: The stu
dent's parents are notified and he or she

is usually placed on school probation
and briefly suspended from sports or
other activities.
Alabama's Hoover school system ran
domly tested 679 of its 1,500 athletes for
drug use this past school year. Fourteen
high school students tested positive, 12 of
them for tobacco.
Elsewhere around the country, schools
in Blackford County, Ind., test for tobacco
use in athletes, participants in other ex
tracurricular activities, and students who
take driver's education or apply for park
ing permits.
In Lockney, Texas, a federal judge re
cently struck down the district's testing of
all students for the use of drugs, alcohol
and tobacco.
In Columbia County, Fla., the school
board will vote Tuesday on a testing poli
cy that would include tobacco. Teenagers
who take part in extracurricular activities

or apply for permits to drive to school
would be screened.
" Tobacco does and will affect a larger
majority of the students than alcohol or
drugs," said Gloria Spizey, the county's co
ordinator for Safe and Drug-Free Schools.
"Tobacco use can be devastating. We felt it
needed to stand with the other drugs."
Screenings can detect c otinine for up to
10 days in regular smokers of about a half
a pack, or 10 cigarettes, a clay, McAlpin
said. Experts say it is unlikely that cotinine
would collect in people exposed to sec
ondhand smoke.
" Tobacco is illegal for diem to have —
it's also a health and safety issue," said I'liil
I lastings, supervisor of safety and alterna
tive education for schools in Decatur,
which recently adopted a testing program
that includes tobacco. "We've got a re
sponsibility to let the kids know the clan
gers of tobacco use."

While random drug testing overall is
being fought by the American Civil Liber
ties Union and students' rights groups, 11 it*
addition of nicotine testing has drawn lit
tle opposition. Guidelines published last
month by the White I louse drug oil ice do
not specifically address tobacco testing.
"On tobacco, we have the same policy as
on testing for drugs— it may not be right
for every school and community," said
Jennifer de Vallance, press secretary for
the oflice. "We encourage parents and of
ficials to assess the extent and nature of the
tobacco problem."
Shawn Heller, executive director of
Students for Sensible Drug Policy in
Washington, said tobacco use by teenagers
is a major problem, but testing for it is just
another step in the invasion of students'
privacy.
"We're making schools like prisons," he
said.
