# Transfers adjust to Stanford life
## Transferring to the Farm 
### ALVIN CHIN 
Five percent of this year's new undergraduate
students are guaranteed only two or three years of
on-campus housing. But these few students are also
permitted to have cars on campus. And they are ex
empt from the I-Hum requirement.
They are Stanford's transfer students. This fall,
87 new sophomores and juniors— 10 percent of
them international students — were welcomed to
the Farm, ready to continue their education.
Julie Lythcott-Haims, Dean of Freshman and
Transfer Students, remarks that transfers "come
with a clear sense of what they want to study."
In fact, Lythcott-Haims's office is contacted by
transfers in numbers disproportionate to their per
centage as new students. She estimates that 20 per
cent of the students she sees are transfer students.
Transfer students who come to the Office of Fresh
man and Transfer Students in Meyer Library have
yet to complain about the food or pronounce that the
advising didn't meet their expectations. If freshmen
begin to complain, Lythcott-Haims continues, "I'd
tell them, 'Go talk to some transfer students!' "
Having already spent one or two years at a dif
ferent institution, transfers seem to have a more
positive opinion than freshmen about Stanford and
say they are delighted by the opportunities avail
able here.
Sarah Sullivan, a sophomore who transferred
from Bowdoin, explains, "Academics were a large
part of my decision to transfer, but there were social
reasons as well. Bowdoin is a very small liberal arts
school located in turaiMaine — the social dynamic
there is necessarily very different from the one
here.
"Stanford can offer many more options, both so
cial and academic, to its students. I think . . . that
students here are more motivated to think and
study —at least some of the time — because
they're excited about what they're studying rather
than just because they know it's what they're sup
posed to do."
Toyon, Arroyo and Kimball house about 20
transfer students each, while Twain and Serra have
12 and 1 1, respectively. A handful of transfers live
either off-campus or in Escondido Village.
Grouping transfers within five residence halls on
the east side of campus instead of spreading them
out among all housing was intended to accelerate
the integration of transfers into the classes of 2005
and 2004 without making them feel isolated from
