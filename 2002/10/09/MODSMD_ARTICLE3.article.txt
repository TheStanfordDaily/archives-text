# Transfers adjust to Stanford life
## Transferring to the Farm 
### ALVIN CHIN 
Five percent of this year's new undergraduate
students are guaranteed only two or three years of
on-campus housing. But these few students are also
permitted to have cars on campus. And they are ex
empt from the I-Hum requirement.
They are Stanford's transfer students. This fall,
87 new sophomores and juniors— 10 percent of
them international students — were welcomed to
the Farm, ready to continue their education.
Julie Lythcott-Haims, Dean of Freshman and
Transfer Students, remarks that transfers "come
with a clear sense of what they want to study."
In fact, Lythcott-Haims's office is contacted by
transfers in numbers disproportionate to their per
centage as new students. She estimates that 20 per
cent of the students she sees are transfer students.
Transfer students who come to the Office of Fresh
man and Transfer Students in Meyer Library have
yet to complain about the food or pronounce that the
advising didn't meet their expectations. If freshmen
begin to complain, Lythcott-Haims continues, "I'd
tell them, 'Go talk to some transfer students!' "
Having already spent one or two years at a dif
ferent institution, transfers seem to have a more
positive opinion than freshmen about Stanford and
say they are delighted by the opportunities avail
able here.
Sarah Sullivan, a sophomore who transferred
from Bowdoin, explains, "Academics were a large
part of my decision to transfer, but there were social
reasons as well. Bowdoin is a very small liberal arts
school located in turaiMaine — the social dynamic
there is necessarily very different from the one
here.
"Stanford can offer many more options, both so
cial and academic, to its students. I think . . . that
students here are more motivated to think and
study —at least some of the time — because
they're excited about what they're studying rather
than just because they know it's what they're sup
posed to do."
Toyon, Arroyo and Kimball house about 20
transfer students each, while Twain and Serra have
12 and 1 1, respectively. A handful of transfers live
either off-campus or in Escondido Village.
Grouping transfers within five residence halls on
the east side of campus instead of spreading them
out among all housing was intended to accelerate
the integration of transfers into the classes of 2005
and 2004 without making them feel isolated from
other transfer students.
Lythcott-Haims also com
ments on a dichotomy existing in
the transfer student body. A few
transfer students choose to re
main heavily involved in transfer
groups, maintaining the identity
of "Transfers Forever!" while
others, like a female transfer stu
dent who asked not to be identi
fied, said they were eager to get to
know other non-transfers as well.
"I wanted to meet non-trans
fers because they are already in

the swing of things," she said. "In
fact, 1 wanted to forget 1 was a
transfer and just dive into the
school year as if I had been here
the whole time."
Over New Student Orienta
tion, transfer students participat
ed in general Orientation activi
ties as well as in events designed
specifically for transfers, such as
a program on transfer-student
advising.
A transfer from Columbia said
about Orientation, "It didn't
make a big deal about being a
transfer, which was
nice . . . [Learning] how to sign
up for class and organize the lo
gistics of starting another school

year was much more beneficial
than any ice-breakers.
"19- and 20-year-olds don't
want to play name games; we've
done that."
Some transfer students said
they have encountered notable
surprises in transitioning to
Stanford. Sullivan says that she
sometimes loses her bicycle.
"Coming from Bowdoin
where it took at most five min
utes to walk between classes, I'm
still acclimating to the size of the
campus and the whole biking
thing," Sullivan said. "I locked
my bike in daylight yesterday
and then came out of class after
dark, and it took me a full five

minutes to find it."
But transfer students' appre
ciation of Stanford encompasses
more than the individual quirks
that make the Farm unique. A
transfer commented that her
previous experience at Columbia
"makes me appreciate the pace
of life here at Stanford. Stanford
has a stronger community, and
the kids are so happy. I love the
laid-back atmosphere.
"Although happiness is some
what inherent in California life,
it's just so refreshing to be in a
place where you know everyone
around you is taking it all in a clay
at a time and enjoying them
selves in the process."

campus and the whole biking
thing," Sullivan said. "I locked
my bike in daylight yesterday
and then came out of class after
dark, and it took me a full five

minutes to find it."
But transfer students' appre
ciation of Stanford encompasses
more than the individual quirks
that make the Farm unique. A
transfer commented that her
previous experience at Columbia
"makes me appreciate the pace
of life here at Stanford. Stanford
has a stronger community, and
the kids are so happy. I love the
laid-back atmosphere.
"Although happiness is some
what inherent in California life,
it's just so refreshing to be in a
place where you know everyone
around you is taking it all in a clay
at a time and enjoying them
selves in the process."
Five percent of this year's new undergraduate
students are guaranteed only two or three years of
on-campus housing. But these few students are also
permitted to have cars on campus. And they are ex
empt from the I-Hum requirement.
They are Stanford's transfer students. This fall,
87 new sophomores and juniors— 10 percent of
them international students — were welcomed to
the Farm, ready to continue their education.
Julie Lythcott-Haims, Dean of Freshman and
Transfer Students, remarks that transfers "come
with a clear sense of what they want to study."
In fact, Lythcott-Haims's office is contacted by
transfers in numbers disproportionate to their per
centage as new students. She estimates that 20 per
cent of the students she sees are transfer students.
Transfer students who come to the Office of Fresh
man and Transfer Students in Meyer Library have
yet to complain about the food or pronounce that the
advising didn't meet their expectations. If freshmen
begin to complain, Lythcott-Haims continues, "I'd
tell them, 'Go talk to some transfer students!' "
Having already spent one or two years at a dif
ferent institution, transfers seem to have a more
positive opinion than freshmen about Stanford and
say they are delighted by the opportunities avail
able here.
Sarah Sullivan, a sophomore who transferred
from Bowdoin, explains, "Academics were a large
part of my decision to transfer, but there were social
reasons as well. Bowdoin is a very small liberal arts
school located in turaiMaine — the social dynamic
there is necessarily very different from the one
here.
"Stanford can offer many more options, both so
cial and academic, to its students. I think . . . that
students here are more motivated to think and
study —at least some of the time — because
they're excited about what they're studying rather
than just because they know it's what they're sup
posed to do."
Toyon, Arroyo and Kimball house about 20
transfer students each, while Twain and Serra have
12 and 1 1, respectively. A handful of transfers live
either off-campus or in Escondido Village.
Grouping transfers within five residence halls on
the east side of campus instead of spreading them
out among all housing was intended to accelerate
the integration of transfers into the classes of 2005
and 2004 without making them feel isolated from
other transfer students.
Lythcott-Haims also com
ments on a dichotomy existing in
the transfer student body. A few
transfer students choose to re
main heavily involved in transfer
groups, maintaining the identity
of "Transfers Forever!" while
others, like a female transfer stu
dent who asked not to be identi
fied, said they were eager to get to
know other non-transfers as well.
"I wanted to meet non-trans
fers because they are already in

the swing of things," she said. "In
fact, 1 wanted to forget 1 was a
transfer and just dive into the
school year as if I had been here
the whole time."
Over New Student Orienta
tion, transfer students participat
ed in general Orientation activi
ties as well as in events designed
specifically for transfers, such as
a program on transfer-student
advising.
A transfer from Columbia said
about Orientation, "It didn't
make a big deal about being a
transfer, which was
nice . . . [Learning] how to sign
up for class and organize the lo
gistics of starting another school

year was much more beneficial
than any ice-breakers.
"19- and 20-year-olds don't
want to play name games; we've
done that."
Some transfer students said
they have encountered notable
surprises in transitioning to
Stanford. Sullivan says that she
sometimes loses her bicycle.
"Coming from Bowdoin
where it took at most five min
utes to walk between classes, I'm
still acclimating to the size of the
campus and the whole biking
thing," Sullivan said. "I locked
my bike in daylight yesterday
and then came out of class after
dark, and it took me a full five

minutes to find it."
