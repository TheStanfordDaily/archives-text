# ASSU leaders outline new year's agenda
## Pres. Henestroza and VP Rodriguez discuss cost of living and voter turnout 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
ASSU President Monica Henestroza
and Vice President Nic k Rodriguez ad
dressed the Undergraduate Senate and
guests last night, outlining their priori
ties and plans for the upcoming school
year. Lowering the cost of living on
campus and increasing student voter
turnout were among the concerns that
topped their agenda.
Rodriguez, a junior, spoke first. He
discussed two programs on which he is
focusing his efforts while in office.
"The first is the cost-of-living cam
paign," Rodriguez said. "The cam
paign's purpose is to research and de
termine the cost of living, in a holistic
fashion, and to apply that research to
make the cost of living on campus bet
ter for everyone. This is an issue that af
fects all students at this University and is
salient with all."
The target date for completion of the
project is currently set as mid-to-late
winter quarter. Cost of Living Director
Sarah Schulman, a sophomore, is head
ing up the project.
Rodriguez explained that, with the
aid of partner organizations, the ASSU
plans to examine specific expenses af
fecting students on a daily basis, such as
dining-service charges and textbooks.
" 'The Bazaar,' a proposed Web site,
could allow lower textbook prices," Ro
driguez said. "Also, we could try to
make dining more competitive. There
are revenue expectations of the dining
service, but there may be excess rev
enue expectation above normal profit
margins."
Though Housing and Dining Ser
vices is registered as a non-profit, Ro
driguez explained that the organization
still needs to make money in order to
fund future dining hall remodeling.
"It cost $10 million to renovate
Wilbur dinning," he noted.
Rodriguez emphasized how this re
search could have the potential to bring
about real and noticeable on-campus
change.

" This is an advocacy project," Ro
driguez said. "It becomes a matter of
mounting pressure, both political and
economic pressure, and then we can see
what kind of projects the ASSU can
sponsor to help on this issue."
He suggested that after such re
search was completed, perhaps a plan
could be drafted so that the University
could subsidize certain monetary needs
so as to be able to provide services, such
as dining, on an at-cost basis.
Rodriguez also discussed the New
Student Union project that lie has been

developing.
"For the last several months, I have
personally sat on a space committee,"
he said. "It was convened to address
short-term space issues. Students do
not have enough meeting space for
their organizations."
Rodriguez expressed hope that the
NSU effort will change the* way space
is distributed to student groups and
other organizations that need meeting
space.
"It is in the interest of students on
how space can be reshuffled to be more

efficient," Rodriguez said. "We are
going to be playing the game of organi
zational politics lor a long time to get
more space for students. . . We want to
make it a comprehensive and a good
effort, to find University stakeholders
that want to be on the committee."
Henestroza, a senior, discussed the
programs that she was concentrating
on as well. The first one she mentioned
wastheASSU "Get Out the Vote"efFort
that is currently underway.
"If you look at the local data, student
issues have traditionally been under
represented in local and state govern
ment," Henestroza said. "Students
under 24 are generally considered apa
thetic voters, since they rarely vote."
In order to light such low levels of
participation, she said that the cam
paign will seek to increase voter in
volvement and awareness of the issues.
"Our goal is to register 4,000 stu
dents by the November election," I len
estroza said. "We got voter registration
cards as an insert for freshman packets.
We have also started setting up a Web
site.. . This is in partnership with the
U(1 schools."
Henestroza explained that this pro
gram could have incredibly powerful
results, if carried out well.
"Ifopefully, we will have millions of
new votes," Henestroza said. " This
could change a lot of things: it is a real
ly small step, but it is important for larg
er issues."
TheASSU president also went 011 to
discuss the second plan that she has
been working on recently.
" The second big project is ISIS,"
Henestroza said. "Basically, the issue at
hand is a real lack of a calendar system -
we need some way to disseminate and
release event information. Students
miss out on great opportunities."
Standing for "Innovative Student
Information Systems," ISIS would not
be a business, but a service free of
charge to Stanford community mem
bers, according to I fenestroza.
"It would allow students groups to
get their name out there if they can't
flyer as much," she said. "We have al
ready approached the Appropriations
Committee about this. So far, we have
developed a team and a proposal, and
we are trying to set up an advisory
board and secure funding."

ASSU President Monica Henestroza
and Vice President Nic k Rodriguez ad
dressed the Undergraduate Senate and
guests last night, outlining their priori
ties and plans for the upcoming school
year. Lowering the cost of living on
campus and increasing student voter
turnout were among the concerns that
topped their agenda.
Rodriguez, a junior, spoke first. He
discussed two programs on which he is
focusing his efforts while in office.
"The first is the cost-of-living cam
paign," Rodriguez said. "The cam
paign's purpose is to research and de
termine the cost of living, in a holistic
fashion, and to apply that research to
make the cost of living on campus bet
ter for everyone. This is an issue that af
fects all students at this University and is
salient with all."
The target date for completion of the
project is currently set as mid-to-late
winter quarter. Cost of Living Director
Sarah Schulman, a sophomore, is head
ing up the project.
Rodriguez explained that, with the
aid of partner organizations, the ASSU
plans to examine specific expenses af
fecting students on a daily basis, such as
dining-service charges and textbooks.
" 'The Bazaar,' a proposed Web site,
could allow lower textbook prices," Ro
driguez said. "Also, we could try to
make dining more competitive. There
are revenue expectations of the dining
service, but there may be excess rev
enue expectation above normal profit
margins."
Though Housing and Dining Ser
vices is registered as a non-profit, Ro
driguez explained that the organization
still needs to make money in order to
fund future dining hall remodeling.
"It cost $10 million to renovate
Wilbur dinning," he noted.
Rodriguez emphasized how this re
search could have the potential to bring
about real and noticeable on-campus
change.

" This is an advocacy project," Ro
driguez said. "It becomes a matter of
mounting pressure, both political and
economic pressure, and then we can see
what kind of projects the ASSU can
sponsor to help on this issue."
He suggested that after such re
search was completed, perhaps a plan
could be drafted so that the University
could subsidize certain monetary needs
so as to be able to provide services, such
as dining, on an at-cost basis.
Rodriguez also discussed the New
Student Union project that lie has been

developing.
"For the last several months, I have
personally sat on a space committee,"
he said. "It was convened to address
short-term space issues. Students do
not have enough meeting space for
their organizations."
Rodriguez expressed hope that the
NSU effort will change the* way space
is distributed to student groups and
other organizations that need meeting
space.
"It is in the interest of students on
how space can be reshuffled to be more

efficient," Rodriguez said. "We are
going to be playing the game of organi
zational politics lor a long time to get
more space for students. . . We want to
make it a comprehensive and a good
effort, to find University stakeholders
that want to be on the committee."
Henestroza, a senior, discussed the
programs that she was concentrating
on as well. The first one she mentioned
wastheASSU "Get Out the Vote"efFort
that is currently underway.
"If you look at the local data, student
issues have traditionally been under
represented in local and state govern
ment," Henestroza said. "Students
under 24 are generally considered apa
thetic voters, since they rarely vote."
In order to light such low levels of
participation, she said that the cam
paign will seek to increase voter in
volvement and awareness of the issues.
"Our goal is to register 4,000 stu
dents by the November election," I len
estroza said. "We got voter registration
cards as an insert for freshman packets.
We have also started setting up a Web
site.. . This is in partnership with the
U(1 schools."
Henestroza explained that this pro
gram could have incredibly powerful
results, if carried out well.
"Ifopefully, we will have millions of
new votes," Henestroza said. " This
could change a lot of things: it is a real
ly small step, but it is important for larg
er issues."
TheASSU president also went 011 to
discuss the second plan that she has
been working on recently.
" The second big project is ISIS,"
Henestroza said. "Basically, the issue at
hand is a real lack of a calendar system -
we need some way to disseminate and
release event information. Students
miss out on great opportunities."
Standing for "Innovative Student
Information Systems," ISIS would not
be a business, but a service free of
charge to Stanford community mem
bers, according to I fenestroza.
"It would allow students groups to
get their name out there if they can't
flyer as much," she said. "We have al
ready approached the Appropriations
Committee about this. So far, we have
developed a team and a proposal, and
we are trying to set up an advisory
board and secure funding."
