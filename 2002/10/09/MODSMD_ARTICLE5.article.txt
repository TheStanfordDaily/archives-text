# SSE, students debate merits of redesigned Stanford Store
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
While most University students
have visited the Stanford Store in
Tresidder Union, not all of the stu
dent body is clear on how or why
the store was established.
Neela Mookerjee, a junior and

store manager, explained that the
store is oriented toward giving stu
dents business experience.
'The Stanford Store employs
only students, both in manage
ment positions and as sales associ
ates in the actual storefront,"
Mookerjee said. " The manage
ment team consists of two to three

full-time employees during the
summer and seven to 10 part-time
employees during the academic
year."
CEO of Stanford Student En
terprises David Endelman, Class
of 2002, discussed how the store
came to be named and located as it
is currently.
"SSE already had a retail opera
tion called Cardinal (Collection that
it ran out of its offices on the sec
ond floor of Tresidder," Endel
man said. "In 1996-97, this was all
moved around ... At that point
we moved Cardinal Collection
downstairs, renamed it and cou
pled it with our Lecture Notes dis
tribution business."
When asked about the financial
history of the Stanford Store, En
delman explained that SSE has a
policy of not releasing such infor
mation.
"SSE does not reveal the finan
cial performance of its businesses,
as we consider this information to
be proprietary and important to
the continued success and compet
itive advantage of our operations,'
Endelman said.

The Stanford Store offers a Stanford underwear line in addition to the stan
dard T-shirts and sweaters, as well as the Flicks To Go movie rental program.
The store is run by Stanford Student Enterprises.
lie also could not specifically
comment on what level oi'financial
resources SSE is investing in the
Stanford Store venture, but em
phasized that the store is an SSE
priority.
"SSE is very committed to the
success of the Stanford Store," En
delman said. "It is one of our
largest businesses, both in revenue
and size of management team, as
well as our most visible among
alumni and parents. In addition,
the store often serves as a valuable
distribution center for other SSE
ventures, such as Flicks passes,
Flicks To Go rentals and the SSE
Card."
Athena von Oech, a senior and
director of the store over the past
summer, outlined what she feels
are the advantages of shopping at
the Stanford Store.
"In the past year we have
worked hard to make it more stu
dent-y, adding a Stanford under
wear line (Stanlord thongs come
in over 10 colors), Nalgene bottles,
classic Stanford tees for only $9.99
and other fun items," von Oech
said. "The Stanford Store is also
cheaper than the Stanford Book
store. I think a lot of students like
shopping at the Stanford Store be
cause it has more student-locused
products, is cheaper, they get a 10
percent discount and the money
benefits the ASSU."
Ross Perlin, a sophomore, ex
plained that he does not object to
the intentions of SSE, but he feels
the store has little to offer that stu
dents are interested in.
"While the store may provide

good opportunities lor Stanlord
students to gain practical business
experience, it has tailed to become
an integral member of the fresid
cler complex or even a store that
appears on most students' radar
screens," Perlin said. "Its merchan
dise is redundant and personally,
when I am looking to buy Stanlord
gear for relatives, 1 tend to use the
upstairs section of the Stanford
Bookstore with its wider selection
and convenient location."
Several other students con
curred with Perlin's sentiments.
"A lot of the selection they have
is already in the Bookstore," said
Jack Chung, a sophomore. "As for
their video rental program, 1 have
never used it, since a lot of the
movies are at Green — even the
newer releases."
Mookerjee, addressing such
student concerns, explained how
SSE has sought to make the Stan
lord Store a better alternative to
other oil-campus retailers such as
the Bookstore.
"The Bookstore has a size and
location that present very difficult
competitive challenges to the Stan
lord Store," Mookerjee said.
"However, we differentiate our
selves by offering all of the follow
ing: better prices, better customer
service, student and alumni dis
counts, trendier and more stu
dent-friendly apparel, different
styles of classic apparel, and finally,
all the profits go right back to the
students through the ASSU."
Katie Buchanan, a junior and
past merchandising manager at
the store, explained how it made
an effort to revamp its offerings
last year to better serve the student
body.
"Last year the Stanford Store
underwent some major changes

pertaining to merchandise and
management struct tire,"
Buchanan said. "The Stanford
Collection of clothing was
launched; decidedly availt garde
and bold, this line was an instant
hit."
Despite these efforts on the part
of SSE, not all feel that the store
lias reached its potential.
Michael Osofsky, a senior who
ran as an ASSU presidential candi
date last year on a platform includ
ing a proposed revitalization of
Tresidder Union, explained that
he feels the Stanford Store has a
promising design.
"The Stanford Store is unique
from other places on campus that
sell apparel in that it is entirely stu
dent-run," Osofsky said. "In
today's corporate world, that con
cept is philosophically awesome.
In addition, the Stanford Store
does offer a lot of great services, in
cluding Flicks To Go and more
nouvelle clothing. The Stanford
Store underwent a major overhaul
last year with a new clothing line
— t his was certainly a plus."
Osofsky added that, while he
feels the Stanford Store has its ben
efits, SSE could also effectively use
the store's space in other sorts of
retail applications.
"However, there are some real
ly cool things that could be put in
the Stanford Store's place that
could also be student-run," Osof
sky said. "In a space of that size, we
could easily fit a student-run ar
cade, music store or pizza
joint... I think they've done an
awesome job, but I also think tfiat
the Stanford Store's space is un
derutilized given the space short
ages at Tresidder and the ability
fora blossoming student-run op
eration."

does offer a lot of great services, in
cluding Flicks To Go and more
nouvelle clothing. The Stanford
Store underwent a major overhaul
last year with a new clothing line
— t his was certainly a plus."
Osofsky added that, while he
feels the Stanford Store has its ben
efits, SSE could also effectively use
the store's space in other sorts of
retail applications.
"However, there are some real
ly cool things that could be put in
the Stanford Store's place that
could also be student-run," Osof
sky said. "In a space of that size, we
could easily fit a student-run ar
cade, music store or pizza
joint... I think they've done an
awesome job, but I also think tfiat
the Stanford Store's space is un
derutilized given the space short
ages at Tresidder and the ability
fora blossoming student-run op
eration."
While most University students
have visited the Stanford Store in
Tresidder Union, not all of the stu
dent body is clear on how or why
the store was established.
Neela Mookerjee, a junior and

store manager, explained that the
store is oriented toward giving stu
dents business experience.
'The Stanford Store employs
only students, both in manage
ment positions and as sales associ
ates in the actual storefront,"
Mookerjee said. " The manage
ment team consists of two to three

full-time employees during the
summer and seven to 10 part-time
employees during the academic
year."
CEO of Stanford Student En
terprises David Endelman, Class
of 2002, discussed how the store
came to be named and located as it
is currently.
"SSE already had a retail opera
tion called Cardinal (Collection that
it ran out of its offices on the sec
ond floor of Tresidder," Endel
man said. "In 1996-97, this was all
moved around ... At that point
we moved Cardinal Collection
downstairs, renamed it and cou
pled it with our Lecture Notes dis
tribution business."
When asked about the financial
history of the Stanford Store, En
delman explained that SSE has a
policy of not releasing such infor
mation.
"SSE does not reveal the finan
cial performance of its businesses,
as we consider this information to
be proprietary and important to
the continued success and compet
itive advantage of our operations,'
Endelman said.

The Stanford Store offers a Stanford underwear line in addition to the stan
dard T-shirts and sweaters, as well as the Flicks To Go movie rental program.
The store is run by Stanford Student Enterprises.
lie also could not specifically
comment on what level oi'financial
resources SSE is investing in the
Stanford Store venture, but em
phasized that the store is an SSE
priority.
"SSE is very committed to the
success of the Stanford Store," En
delman said. "It is one of our
largest businesses, both in revenue
and size of management team, as
well as our most visible among
alumni and parents. In addition,
the store often serves as a valuable
distribution center for other SSE
ventures, such as Flicks passes,
Flicks To Go rentals and the SSE
Card."
Athena von Oech, a senior and
director of the store over the past
summer, outlined what she feels
are the advantages of shopping at
the Stanford Store.
"In the past year we have
worked hard to make it more stu
dent-y, adding a Stanford under
wear line (Stanlord thongs come
in over 10 colors), Nalgene bottles,
classic Stanford tees for only $9.99
and other fun items," von Oech
said. "The Stanford Store is also
cheaper than the Stanford Book
store. I think a lot of students like
shopping at the Stanford Store be
cause it has more student-locused
products, is cheaper, they get a 10
percent discount and the money
benefits the ASSU."
Ross Perlin, a sophomore, ex
plained that he does not object to
the intentions of SSE, but he feels
the store has little to offer that stu
dents are interested in.
"While the store may provide

good opportunities lor Stanlord
students to gain practical business
experience, it has tailed to become
an integral member of the fresid
cler complex or even a store that
appears on most students' radar
screens," Perlin said. "Its merchan
dise is redundant and personally,
when I am looking to buy Stanlord
gear for relatives, 1 tend to use the
upstairs section of the Stanford
Bookstore with its wider selection
and convenient location."
Several other students con
curred with Perlin's sentiments.
"A lot of the selection they have
is already in the Bookstore," said
Jack Chung, a sophomore. "As for
their video rental program, 1 have
never used it, since a lot of the
movies are at Green — even the
newer releases."
Mookerjee, addressing such
student concerns, explained how
SSE has sought to make the Stan
lord Store a better alternative to
other oil-campus retailers such as
the Bookstore.
"The Bookstore has a size and
location that present very difficult
competitive challenges to the Stan
lord Store," Mookerjee said.
"However, we differentiate our
selves by offering all of the follow
ing: better prices, better customer
service, student and alumni dis
counts, trendier and more stu
dent-friendly apparel, different
styles of classic apparel, and finally,
all the profits go right back to the
students through the ASSU."
Katie Buchanan, a junior and
past merchandising manager at
the store, explained how it made
an effort to revamp its offerings
last year to better serve the student
body.
"Last year the Stanford Store
underwent some major changes

pertaining to merchandise and
management struct tire,"
Buchanan said. "The Stanford
Collection of clothing was
launched; decidedly availt garde
and bold, this line was an instant
hit."
Despite these efforts on the part
of SSE, not all feel that the store
lias reached its potential.
Michael Osofsky, a senior who
ran as an ASSU presidential candi
date last year on a platform includ
ing a proposed revitalization of
Tresidder Union, explained that
he feels the Stanford Store has a
promising design.
"The Stanford Store is unique
from other places on campus that
sell apparel in that it is entirely stu
dent-run," Osofsky said. "In
today's corporate world, that con
cept is philosophically awesome.
In addition, the Stanford Store
does offer a lot of great services, in
cluding Flicks To Go and more
nouvelle clothing. The Stanford
