# SSE, students debate merits of redesigned Stanford Store
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
While most University students
have visited the Stanford Store in
Tresidder Union, not all of the stu
dent body is clear on how or why
the store was established.
Neela Mookerjee, a junior and

store manager, explained that the
store is oriented toward giving stu
dents business experience.
'The Stanford Store employs
only students, both in manage
ment positions and as sales associ
ates in the actual storefront,"
Mookerjee said. " The manage
ment team consists of two to three

full-time employees during the
summer and seven to 10 part-time
employees during the academic
year."
CEO of Stanford Student En
terprises David Endelman, Class
of 2002, discussed how the store
came to be named and located as it
is currently.
"SSE already had a retail opera
tion called Cardinal (Collection that
it ran out of its offices on the sec
ond floor of Tresidder," Endel
man said. "In 1996-97, this was all
moved around ... At that point
we moved Cardinal Collection
downstairs, renamed it and cou
pled it with our Lecture Notes dis
tribution business."
When asked about the financial
history of the Stanford Store, En
delman explained that SSE has a
policy of not releasing such infor
mation.
"SSE does not reveal the finan
cial performance of its businesses,
as we consider this information to
be proprietary and important to
the continued success and compet
itive advantage of our operations,'
Endelman said.
