## Kuwaiti gunmen kill Marine 
### 
KUWAIT (AP) — Two Kuwaiti
gunmen in a pickup truck at
tacked U.S. forces during war
games yesterday on an island in
the Persian Gulf, killing one Ma
rine and wounding another before
they were shot to death by U.S.
troops. Kuwait called the assault a
"terrorist act."
The Pentagon said the as
sailants pulled up to a group of
Marines conducting urban assault
training on Failaka, an uninhabit
ed island oil Kuwait's coast, and
opened lire with small arms. They
then drove to another site,
stopped and attacked again before
being killed by Marines, the Penta
gon said.
Marines later found three AK
-47s and ammunition inside the ve
hicle, according to a statement re
leased in Washington by the
Bahrain-based U.S. Fifth Fleet. It
said the injured Marine was hit in
the arm.
In a brief statement, the
Kuwaiti Interior Ministry con
demned the attack and identified
the assailants as Anas al-Kandari,
born in 1981, and Jassem al-Hajiri,
born in 1976. It said both were
Kuwaiti civilians.
U.S. intelligence has not deter
mined if the attackers had any ter
rorist links, said an intelligence of
ficial, speaking on the condition of
anonymity.
An Interior Ministry official,
speaking on condition of
anonymity, described the two men
as fundamentalists. More than 30
of their friends and relatives were
detained for questioning, he said.
"The ministry announces that
this is a terrorist act," the Interior
Ministry said in a statement. "It
will not allow anyone to under
mine the country's security."

Pentagon spokesman Lt. Daniel
I letlage said the Marines returned
to their ships shortly after the at
tack, but would resume exercises
on the island today.
Failaka Island, about 10 miles
east of Kuwait City, was aban
doned by its inhabitants when Iraq
invaded Kuwait in 1990, and Iraqi
forces heavily mined it during
their occupation.
After a U.S.-led coalition liber
ated Kuwait in the 1991 Persian
Gulf War, the government com
pensated islanders for their
property and resettled them on
the mainland. The island has
since been cleared of mines and
many Kuwaitis fish there on
weekends. Some former resi
dents visit occasionally.
Fhe shooting attack was un
precedented in Kuwait, a Wash
ington ally since the Gull War.
More than a decade later, most
Kuwaitis remain supportive of the
close relationship.
Pentagon spokeswoman Victo
ria Clarke said the two Marines
were taken to the Armed Forces
I lospital in Kuwait City, where
one of them died of his wounds.
Their names were withheld until
relatives were contacted.
Fhe military exercise, dubbed
Eager Mace 2002, involves
Kuwaitis at some stages. However,
the Pentagon said the attack hap
pened during an exercise that only
involved U.S. forces.
The U.S. military has carried
out exercises in Kuwait since the
(iulf War as part of a defense
agreement the small oil-rich
state signed with Washington.
Fhe Pentagon has said the cur
rent war games were routine
and not related to any possible
war to oust Iraqi President Sad

darn Hussein.
Kuwait opposes any unilateral
action against Iraq and fears retal
iation with non-conventional
weapons if the United States at
tacks Baghdad. However, it has
said the United States could use its
land for an attack if the war is sanc
tioned by the United Nations.
Fundamentalists are politically
strong in Kuwait. They want Sad
dam removed from power, but
many believe President Bush's real
motives for waging war would be
to revive the foundering U.S.
economy and to weaken Arabs out
of support for Israel.
Two years ago, Kuwaiti author
ities arrested three Kuwaitis they
said plotted attacks on Camp
Doha, an army base used by U.S.
forces in Kuwait, and on the
homes and cars of Western mili
tary personnel.
Scores of Kuwaitis have fought
alongside Muslims in
Afghanistan, Chechnya and
Bosnia, but they have not at
tacked Americans in Kuwait —
even at the height of the U.S. war
that toppled Afghanistan's Tal
iban regime. The Taliban har
bored Osama bin Laden's al-
Qaida organization, which is
blamed for last year's Sept. 1 1 at
tacks in the United States.
When a Canadian man was shot
and killed while walking in the
street just after the war in
Afghanistan started, it was thought
to be in retaliation against foreign
ers. A Kuwaiti religious extremist
was apprehended and later freed.
Eventually, a group of Filipinos,
including the victim's wife, was ar
rested and tried for murdering the
man for his life insurance. One Fil
ipino was convicted and sentenced
to life in prison.
