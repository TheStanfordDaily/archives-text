lan Stewart has reported from some
of the most dangerous places on
earth, but none more dangerous than
Sierra Leone. When he was named
West Africa bureau chief by the
Associated Press, Stewart accepted

of excitement and trepidation. He
was one of the AP's youngest bureau
chiefs, and over the next year he
reported from the front lines of the
war-ravaged countries of the Congo,
Guinea-Bissau, and Sierra Leone
and coordinated news coverage
of some twenty-three others.
AMBUSHED is a fascinating
in-depth look at the extraordinary
day-to-day life of a war
correspondent. A graduate of
Columbia University's Graduate
School of Journalism, lAN
STEWART has been based in and
reported from more than forty
countries. A John S. Knight fellow
at Stanford University, he lives in
Palo Alto, California.
