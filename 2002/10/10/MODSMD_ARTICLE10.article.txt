WASHING lON (AP) — Presi
dent Bush gained important new
Democratic support for his war
resolution yesterday, bolstering
his expected margin of victory in
Congress for broad authority to
use force against Iraq. But the ad
ministration was having less suc
cess on the international front.
A 25-minute phone call be
tween Bush and French President
Jacques Chirac failed to produce a
breakthrough over wording of a
new U.N. Security Council resolu
tion to disarm Saddam Hussein.
" I his is intricate diplomacy and
we are continuing our consulta
tions," said White House
spokesman Sean McCormack. He
cited a "mutual desire" to find
common ground.
Both the Republican-led I louse
and the Democratic-ruled Senate

forged ahead with debate on a res
olution giving Bush authority to
use U.S. force against Iraq — with
or without U.N. participation.
The White House cited a new
(.1A assessment — suggesting Sad
dam might launch terrorist attacks
if lie concluded a U.S. military at
tack was inevitable — as further
justification lor strengthening the
president's hand. Opponents used
the same document to argue
against a U.S. first strike.
But more Democrats closed
ranks with the president and lead
ers of both parties predicting con
gressional passage by wide mar
gins by week's end. Both houses of
Congress debated the measure
late into the night. A final vote in
the House is expected today.
Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, the
Senate's No. 2 Democrat, an

nounced he would vote with the
president, while cautioning Bush
to use the power with discretion.
"As president of the United States,
you are the leader of the free
world, not its ruler," Reid said.
Also voicing their support were
Sens. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., and
John Kerry, D-Mass. Dodd said he
hoped the show of unity "will re
duce the likelihood that force will
be necessary." Kerry, a decorated
Vietnam War veteran who had
been in the go-slow camp, said
Saddam's arsenal posed "a real
and grave threat" to the United
States and its allies.
In addition, the Senate turned
back, 88-10, an amendment by
Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., to ex
pand Bush's authority for pre
emptive military action to include
five terror organizations.
