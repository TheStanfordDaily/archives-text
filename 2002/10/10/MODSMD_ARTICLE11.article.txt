C.I I ICAGO (AP) â€” The leader of an Islamic char
ity was indicted yesterday on charges of funneling do
nations to Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, with
Attorney General John Ashcroft vowing, "We will find
I he sources of terrorist blood money."
Knaam M. Arnaout, 40, head of the Benevolence
International Foundation, has been in federal cus
tody since April.
The indictment said a criminal enterprise that ex
isted for at least a decade used charitable contribu
tions from innocent Muslims, non-Muslims and cor
porations to support bin Laden's al-Qaida network,
C Ihechen rebels lighting the Russian army and armed
violence in Bosnia.
"It is sinister to prey on good hearts to fund the
works of evil," Ashcroft said in announcing the
charges in Chicago.
Arnaout attorney Joseph Duffy told reporters the

indictment "makes a mockery of both the war on ter
ror and the United States Constitution."
He said Arnaout knew bin Laden in the 1980s when
the terrorist mastermind was nominally on the same
side with the United States in helping Afghan freedom
fighters in their war to expel the Soviet Union.
But Dully said there is no evidence linking Ar
naout to terrorism.
He said that the government is fighting "a paranoid
war against any Muslim who ever had any contact no
matter how innocent with a terrorist, a suspected ter
rorist or an acquaintance of a suspected terrorist."
Neither Ashcroft nor U.S. Attorney Patrick
Fitzgerald would specify how much money went to
terrorists.
Ashcroft said documents found in the organization's
office in Bosnia have provided "chilling" evidence tying
Arnaout directly to bin Laden and al-Qaida.
