## The 						Stanford Daily ResEd takes a step in the right direction with CAAs 
### 
Published. Since 1891

As the Class of 2006 represents the
most ethnically diverse group to
date, now, more than ever, we are
faced with the reality that diversity
does not inherently promote cultural under
standing and values.
In an effort to create an environment where
students are comfortable discussing diversity is
sues, Cultural Awareness Associates inspire
cross-cultural dialogue and appreciation for di
versity within the residential setting. Associates
in the program must undergo extensive train
ing in multicultural education to better build
awareness of diversity and sense of community.
The program recently launched as a pilot test
within Alondra and Naranja and, if successful,
could expand into more residences.
The student-initiated CAA program is the re
sult of two years of research, strategy, rejections
and eventual acceptance. The sponsoring par-

ties — the Asian American Activity Center, the
Black Community Service Center, El Centro
Chicano, the Native American Cultural Center,
and Leadership through Education, Activism
and Diversity — deserve praise for striving to
create a community where diverse individuals
contribute to and benefit from the cultural sen
sitivities and ethnic appreciation of others. Fur
ther, we applaud the Residential Education ad
ministration for their willingness to give the pro
gram a chance.
Initially, many students reported facing resis
tant administrators who questioned the need
fora position that dealt solely with issues of di
versity. Their answer was that such a position
was unnecessary because resident assistants are
intensively trained to handle issues that may
arise concerning sexuality, gender and race in a
comfortable environment. There were also con
cerns that delegating all "culture-related" re

sponsibilities to a newly formed position would
diminish the role of the RA. However, if we do
not look past the surface, we might be inclined
to agree with this perspective.
During this year's RA training — which
spanned approximately 80 hours over 10 days
— less than one hour was directly devoted to
multicultural awareness. Students of varying
ethnicities from 50 states and over 40 countries
will rub shoulders with each other, exchanging
perspectives from urban, suburban and rural
upbringings. An RA with little exposure to di
versity issues who walks into Orientation can't
be expected to facilitate dialogues and foster re
spect amongst the most diverse class of fresh
men that Stanford has ever seen.
Even if the RA training included more ade
quate exposure to multicultural themes, all RAs
are not necessarily comfortable or experienced
dealing with these types of issues. Further, the

diversity of the RA applicant pool is not close to
mirroring the diversity of the student body,
which is a serious problem. Residential Educa
tion should make more proactive efforts to re
cruit and retain a broader range of students.
Stanford, in many of its initiatives and re
cruitment procedures, has emphasized the im
portance of diversity. And as students, we need
to continue to hold the University accountable
for that declaration. We will all encounter is
sues of sexuality and race from time to time,
and it is important to have a person who is, not
only equipped, but comfortable, discussing is
sues of diversity.
Res Ed at Stanford has differentiated itself
from such programs at other universities with in
novative approaches to age-old problems. The
CAA program, if instituted on a broad scale,
could be an effective way for Res Ed to address
the evolving needs of its student population.
