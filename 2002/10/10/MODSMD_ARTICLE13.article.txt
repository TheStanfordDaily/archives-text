# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## War provides short term solution 
### STANFORD COMMUNITY FOR PEACE JUSTICE GUEST COLUMNIST 
With the international commu
nity deadlocked over how to pro
ceed with weapons inspections and
Congress poised to rubber stamp
an authorization of force, it ap
pears that U.S. President George
W. Bush will launch a military cam
paign in Iraq this winter.
Whether or not the United Na
tions finally approves the use of
such force, we must remember that
a war in Iraq will have been the
outcome of a crisis manufactured
by the United States.
Clearly, Saddam Hussein is not
an ally of the United States, nor is
he likely to use his probable supply
of weapons to advance peace.
However, it requires a leap of faith
to believe that Saddam Hussein
would, without provocation,
launch nuclear or biological
weapons against any nation, a
move that would invite immediate
retaliation, international condem
nation and war.
Instead, Bush asks us to believe
that a U.S.-led ground war in Iraq
is needed to stabilize a world
plagued by pockets of evil. But why
a ground war, and why now?
We must consider the proposed
war in Iraq alongside the war al
ready declared by the U.S. — the
war on terrorism. The Bush ad
ministration has advanced only the
sketchiest of claims that Hussein
supports A1 Qaeda or any blacklist
ed terrorist groups.
To justify its latest military cam
paign, the U.S. has found it neces
sary to inaugurate a new foreign
policy doctrine: that of the light to
"pre-emptive strikes," that is to un
reservedly "act alone 112. . .1 acting
preemptively against (. . .] terror
ists," (Bush administration publi
cation, Sept. 20, 2002).
Fighting the war on terror, de
stroying the Axis of Evil and threat
ening pre-emptive strikes are all
ways in which Bush has claimed
the right to protect the perceived
security interests of the U.S.
But it doesn't seem inconse
quential that unilateralist foreign
policy doctrines are popping up in
Washington as quickly as U.S. mil
itary troops have appeared across
the globe in the last year.

With U.S. military forces in 15(5
countries, it might be that by goals
of international peace and securi
ty, Bush implies something like
"general resignation to unfettered
U.S. military proliferation across
the globe."
If this isn't the case, how else
are we to understand the de
mands by the U.S. (and Britain)
that Iraqi planes not lly within
the country's own airspace —
enforcement of which has meant
a 12-year bombing campaign of
Iraqi territory?
How are we to understand the
insistence that U.S. weapons, sol
diers, special advisers and mili
tary aid are the solution to eco
nomic, political and social prob
lems in Colombia, the Philip
pines and Indonesia?
What are we to think when the
perpetual war at hand is always a
higher moral concern than "collat
eral damage" in the form of Red
Cross hospitals in Afghanistan?
This is to suggest that concep
tions ol international security fail to
be meaningful when foreign policy
means simply crosschecking a
country's stock of weapons with its
cooperation in the global war.
Somehow, the human liberties
that the U.S. claims to protect for its
own citizens are the very terms that
are thrown out as irrelevant for dis
cussions ol world stability. It is con
sidered a part of war that civilians
are killed; perhaps t his, above all, is
why we seek to prevent war.
But when threats of war— call
it thwarting terrorism, changing
regimes, overturning evil, pre
empting attacks— become the nor
mal mode of interaction between
the U.S. and the rest of the world,
we risk rendering the lives of non-
U.S. residents' permanent collater
al in a game of global politics.
Isn't this why terrorism — tak
ing the lives of civilians solely to ex
press political or moral outrage —
is so objectionable?
To prophesy a never-ending
war would be hyperbole, but to rec
ognize a long-standing level of mil
itarization is to establish a mode by
which the U.S. conducts its global
affairs. When military rhetoric and
threats are reformulated monthly
out ol frustration over their ineffec
tiveness, we should not hesitate to
demand a reformulation of global

security.
Political empowerment, free
dom from economic exploitation
of local resources, and access to
health services might count as ef
fective measures of human securi
ty. If these goals sound too lofty or
seem to ignore the supposed cold,
hard necessity of permanent mili
tarization, let us consider the situa
tion the U.S. has created in
Afghanistan.
We cannot consider as signs of a
repaired, secure nation weekly car
bombings and assassination at
tempts, coupled with famine and
dispersed families. Nor can Bush's
claims to support democracies
stand up to his tacit support of
General Musharrafs sustained
coup in Pakistan.
International negotiation may
be neither as easy nor as immedi
ately gratifying as Bush likes, but
U.S. unilateralism will fail to protect
the long-term security of Iraq, the
Middle East, or this nation. We
must press for weapons inspections
without the U.S. continuing to sab
otage the only process that has per
mitted sustained dialogue, and had
initiated a process of disarmament.
The precedent about to be set
by the doctrine of preemptive
strikes is horrifying, opening tlie
way for any other nation to strike
against its own perceived threats.
Far from contributing to interna
tional security, this policy will invite
chaos in a world destabilized by
intra and international military
conflicts. It is a doctrine of c onve
nience for the U.S., set up to bull
doze through near-international
consensus against a war in Iraq.
In recent months, political dis
sent within tfie U.S. government
has all but disappeared, and sup
posed patriotism has wiped away
general scrutiny of national poli
cies. We can restore a culture of
active engagement in the priori
ties of the U.S. by beginning to
challenge the ideology that the
rampant deployment of the U.S.
military will make either this na
tion or the people of the world ul
timately safer.

and Justice is one of the cosponsors of a
teacli-in on the potential war in Iraq. It
will he held on Oct. 11 in lildg. 200 of
the Main Quad.

The precedent about to be set
by the doctrine of preemptive
strikes is horrifying, opening tlie
way for any other nation to strike
against its own perceived threats.
Far from contributing to interna
tional security, this policy will invite
chaos in a world destabilized by
intra and international military
conflicts. It is a doctrine of c onve
nience for the U.S., set up to bull
doze through near-international
consensus against a war in Iraq.
In recent months, political dis
sent within tfie U.S. government
has all but disappeared, and sup
posed patriotism has wiped away
general scrutiny of national poli
cies. We can restore a culture of
active engagement in the priori
ties of the U.S. by beginning to
challenge the ideology that the
rampant deployment of the U.S.
military will make either this na
tion or the people of the world ul
timately safer.

The Stanford C.ommunily for Peace
and Justice is one of the cosponsors of a
teacli-in on the potential war in Iraq. It
will he held on Oct. 11 in lildg. 200 of
the Main Quad.

With the international commu
nity deadlocked over how to pro
ceed with weapons inspections and
Congress poised to rubber stamp
an authorization of force, it ap
pears that U.S. President George
W. Bush will launch a military cam
paign in Iraq this winter.
Whether or not the United Na
tions finally approves the use of
such force, we must remember that
a war in Iraq will have been the
outcome of a crisis manufactured
by the United States.
Clearly, Saddam Hussein is not
an ally of the United States, nor is
he likely to use his probable supply
of weapons to advance peace.
However, it requires a leap of faith
to believe that Saddam Hussein
would, without provocation,
launch nuclear or biological
weapons against any nation, a
move that would invite immediate
retaliation, international condem
nation and war.
Instead, Bush asks us to believe
that a U.S.-led ground war in Iraq
is needed to stabilize a world
plagued by pockets of evil. But why
a ground war, and why now?
We must consider the proposed
war in Iraq alongside the war al
ready declared by the U.S. — the
war on terrorism. The Bush ad
ministration has advanced only the
sketchiest of claims that Hussein
supports A1 Qaeda or any blacklist
ed terrorist groups.
To justify its latest military cam
paign, the U.S. has found it neces
sary to inaugurate a new foreign
policy doctrine: that of the light to
"pre-emptive strikes," that is to un
reservedly "act alone 112. . .1 acting
preemptively against (. . .] terror
ists," (Bush administration publi
cation, Sept. 20, 2002).
Fighting the war on terror, de
stroying the Axis of Evil and threat
ening pre-emptive strikes are all
ways in which Bush has claimed
the right to protect the perceived
security interests of the U.S.
But it doesn't seem inconse
quential that unilateralist foreign
policy doctrines are popping up in
Washington as quickly as U.S. mil
itary troops have appeared across
the globe in the last year.

With U.S. military forces in 15(5
countries, it might be that by goals
of international peace and securi
ty, Bush implies something like
"general resignation to unfettered
U.S. military proliferation across
the globe."
If this isn't the case, how else
are we to understand the de
mands by the U.S. (and Britain)
that Iraqi planes not lly within
the country's own airspace —
enforcement of which has meant
a 12-year bombing campaign of
Iraqi territory?
How are we to understand the
insistence that U.S. weapons, sol
diers, special advisers and mili
tary aid are the solution to eco
nomic, political and social prob
lems in Colombia, the Philip
pines and Indonesia?
What are we to think when the
perpetual war at hand is always a
higher moral concern than "collat
eral damage" in the form of Red
Cross hospitals in Afghanistan?
This is to suggest that concep
tions ol international security fail to
be meaningful when foreign policy
means simply crosschecking a
country's stock of weapons with its
cooperation in the global war.
Somehow, the human liberties
that the U.S. claims to protect for its
own citizens are the very terms that
are thrown out as irrelevant for dis
cussions ol world stability. It is con
sidered a part of war that civilians
are killed; perhaps t his, above all, is
why we seek to prevent war.
But when threats of war— call
it thwarting terrorism, changing
regimes, overturning evil, pre
empting attacks— become the nor
mal mode of interaction between
the U.S. and the rest of the world,
we risk rendering the lives of non-
U.S. residents' permanent collater
al in a game of global politics.
Isn't this why terrorism — tak
ing the lives of civilians solely to ex
press political or moral outrage —
is so objectionable?
To prophesy a never-ending
war would be hyperbole, but to rec
ognize a long-standing level of mil
itarization is to establish a mode by
which the U.S. conducts its global
affairs. When military rhetoric and
threats are reformulated monthly
out ol frustration over their ineffec
tiveness, we should not hesitate to
demand a reformulation of global

security.
Political empowerment, free
dom from economic exploitation
of local resources, and access to
health services might count as ef
fective measures of human securi
ty. If these goals sound too lofty or
seem to ignore the supposed cold,
hard necessity of permanent mili
tarization, let us consider the situa
tion the U.S. has created in
Afghanistan.
We cannot consider as signs of a
repaired, secure nation weekly car
bombings and assassination at
tempts, coupled with famine and
dispersed families. Nor can Bush's
claims to support democracies
stand up to his tacit support of
General Musharrafs sustained
coup in Pakistan.
International negotiation may
be neither as easy nor as immedi
ately gratifying as Bush likes, but
U.S. unilateralism will fail to protect
the long-term security of Iraq, the
Middle East, or this nation. We
must press for weapons inspections
without the U.S. continuing to sab
otage the only process that has per
mitted sustained dialogue, and had
initiated a process of disarmament.
