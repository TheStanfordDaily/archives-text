Editorial 'misrepresents'
Campus Watch
In you Oct. 9 article "Campus
Watch stifles freedom of expres
sion," you have misrepresented
both the Campus Watch organi
zation and Stanford's own role in
the problem. Campus Watch is
an organization which tries to
identify bias in the academic
world when it comes to Israel and
the Middle East. The purpose of
Campus Watch is defined on
their website as:
"The project mainly address
es live problems: analytical fail
ures, the mixing of politics with
scholarship, intolerance of al
ternative views, apologetics and
the abuse of power over stu
dents. Campus Watch fully re
spects the freedom of speech of
those it debates while insisting
on its own freedom to comment
on their words and deeds."
Your editorial ignores this com
pletely and creates a deceptive pic -
ture of Campus Watch as an orga
nization which tries to quiet op
posing viewpoints rather than
comment on them.
I believe I need not point out
the paradoxical position of the
article which attempts to quiet
the Campus Watch organization
and deny it its rights of freedom

ofspeech.
The Stanford campus was cor
rectly identified by Campus Watch
as having a problem, not because
of student demonstration or even
student sentiment on campus, but
because of the academics, namely
Prof. Joel Beinin.
Students who wish to take a
class on the Israel / Palestine con
flict or on Middle East history will
most likely end up in one of Prof.
Beinin's classes.
He would most likely agree
that his classes are biased and
present only one side of the issue.
Although it is academically
permitted and almost necessary
to teach the subject from a spe
cific viewpoint, Campus Watch
is doing the University a service
by commenting on professor
Beinin's viewpoints and putting
them in perspective.
Campus Watch also tries to
make sure academia is not mis
used. This clearly happened last
year when the History Depart
ment's money was used to stage
an A1 Nakba "memorial." The
memorial was a political demon
stration in disguise with no aca
demic value whatsoever.
Prof. Beinin played a role in
organizing it and attended the
demonstration. Later in the
year he spoke at another anti-Is

rael demonstration.
These activities mark the misuse
of academia, and I am grateful to
Campus Watch for pointing them
out to unsuspecting students.
Freedom of speech is the pri
mary concern of the editorial,
and 1 couldn't agree more. How
ever, with freedom of speech,
comes the freedom to comment.
I hope that the editors at The
Stanford Daily reconsider their
stance against this freedom.
