# Program tests potential of high-tech kiosks
## 
### MORGAN SPRINGER 
Imagine a world where stu
dents could have instant access to
the Stanford academic calendar,
daily events, current weather and a
campus map, all in the palm of
their hands.
A new pilot program has made
this possible through a technology
called Bluefish — software that
gives users access to a digital net
work through physical portals that
have been recently installed in sev
eral Stanford locations, including
Tresidder Union. But despite the
software's futuristic capabilities,
few in the community have made
use of the portals, raising doubts
about the program's prospects for
success.

"Bluefish is two things," said
Mitch Davis, executive director of
academic technology and consult
ing for Information Technology
Systems and Services. "It's an ac
cess point that uses IK (infrared)
and it is a software package that al
lows people to quickly transmit in
formation."
I he physical technology con
sists of a wall-mounted rectangular
box featuring the technology's
namesake — a blue painting of a
fish.
Students with Palm-compatible
mobile devices can hold them up
to a blue infrared light in the eye of
the "fish" to download Stanford
related content from the portal.
This content includes Marguerite
schedules, a tour of the campus,

Stanford facts, historical informa
tion, the weather forecasts, movie
times and daily events.
Davis explained that, if suc
cessful, the program — currently
feauturing three Bluefish panels
near Bon Appetit dining, outside
of Tresidder Fitness and in the
Coffee House — could be ex
panded to include further con
tent, such as an online facebook,
access to grades and whole kiosks
of flyers.
Currently, the Stanford Blue
fish software is not compatible with
Pocket PCs, though Davis said he
hopes it will be in the near future.
I le also wants to give students
the capability to insert their own
announcements for clubs, parties
or other resources.

"1 hope to make the Palm a
huge data repository about Stan
ford," Davis said.
However, even though the pan
els have been in place for about a
month and a half, very few stu
dents have actually heard of the
Bluefish technology, and even
fewer are putting it to use.
Sophomore Itamar Rosenn
works in the CoHo and was un
aware of the portal there.
"Honestly, I haven't noticed it
at all, and I haven't seen anyone
using it,"he said.
Other students expressed con
cerns about the fact that updating
the content requires daily trips to
the few portals in Tresidder.
"It would be a lot easier if they
had the access points in the dorms

so you wouldn't have to go out ol
your way," said freshman David
Beall.
Davis acknowledged the prob
lem of students having to manu
ally update their devices, but said

that the technology may be up
graded from older infrared tech
nology to use more up-to-date
wireless networks, eliminating
the need for trips to physical
panels.
