# Scavenger hunters swarm streets of S.F.
## Wild and crazy freshmen take over the city, from Fisherman's Wharf to Market Street 
### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU 
Stanford unleashed hundreds of freshmen
into the heart of San Francisco during the first
two weekends of school with lists of crazy tasks
to complete and, as has become customary in
the annual fall scavenger hunts, the results
were downright wild.
Unsuspecting freshmen were asked to sere
nade hand-holding couples, give the "two
cheek salute" to the Blue and Gold fleet, sample
phallic lollipops at Big Al's sex shop, and create
a human sundae sometimes wearing little more
than a whipped cream bra. And this was only a
small fraction of the fun.
Whoa. Hold on. Stanford, the prestigious,
palm-tree-lined "West (-oast Ivy" sanctions this
dorm-run event? Resident Assistants are en
couraged to remind their frosh that dorm
funds do not include bail money. Students are
warned to bring along some extra cash if they
plan to moon a police officer.
The truth behind the hunt is a secret kept
from parents of prospective students. Barron's
"AGuide to the Most (Competitive Golleges" in
cludes a only mild description of Stanford's
freshman San Francisco scavenger hunt:
"We were dropped oil in Union Square with
lists of items to pick up," one frosh narrates.
"We were told to return that evening with a
box of rice-a-Roni, a picture of us in front of
Jerry Garria's former apartment and an op
tional body piercing (no ears), to name only a
lew of the items."
The rice-a-Roni rendition doesn't bear
much resemblance to the countless stories
freshmen from all dorms had to share this year.
San Francisco adventures ranged from the
relatively innocuous — leading a round of the
"Macarena" on a public bus — to the more racy
and scandalous.
Some groups took fountain hopping outside
the bounds of the Stanford campus. Bristin
Jones from Soto jumped in the fountain out
side a fancy hotel to reenact "Jaws."
"I put my hands in a triangle above my head
and pretended I was a shark," she describes,
adding how surprised she was that no security
officers chased her out.

lenged a salesclerk who didn't "re
spect his decision." A few minutes
and much arguing later, the con
fused and sympathetic manager
let him try on the item — a diffi
cult task, no doubt, but certainly a
point-filled photo op.
Victoria's Secret salesclerks
weren't the only ones in San Fran
cisco that didn't welcome the fresh
men with open arms. Abercrombie
and Fitch confiscated one group's
disposable camera. "Big Al" put up
a special sign in the entrance to his
sex shop warning "Stanford" stu
dents that they must display identi
fication and could only come in two
at a time. By 3:00 p.m., Sat., Oct. 5,
the man had lost his cool.
"Back off, back off," fie repeat

t-shirts.
Street guitarists, bellhops and
carousel owners were also far from

thrilled to see yet another batch of
hunters.
"Nope, under no circumstances
can you take my picture," said one
man in a Cal hat.
However, most San Francisco
streetgoers were eager to help com
plete the tasks. They listened to
marriage proposals, joined in the
"5, 6, 7, 8, Whooo!" cheers, volun
teered to be dates for College Assis
tants (phone numbers included!),
and allowed the freshman to slap
their derrieres for the unofficial
"slap-an-ass" day. Thanks, folks.
All agreed the day in San Fran
cisco had long-lasting rewards.
"You got to see the city on foot
and you sure saw a lot of it!" said
Michael Miller from Freshman
and Sophomore College.
Ange Steele from Larkin de
scribes why she had "a blast."
"1 met tons of new people in my
dorm that I'd never seen before."
As Blair Beverly from Rincona
da put it, for many freshmen, get
ting to know their dormmates
meant seeing more of them than
they ever thought they would.

Stanford unleashed hundreds of freshmen
into the heart of San Francisco during the first
two weekends of school with lists of crazy tasks
to complete and, as has become customary in
the annual fall scavenger hunts, the results
were downright wild.
Unsuspecting freshmen were asked to sere
nade hand-holding couples, give the "two
cheek salute" to the Blue and Gold fleet, sample
phallic lollipops at Big Al's sex shop, and create
a human sundae sometimes wearing little more
than a whipped cream bra. And this was only a
small fraction of the fun.
Whoa. Hold on. Stanford, the prestigious,
palm-tree-lined "West (-oast Ivy" sanctions this
dorm-run event? Resident Assistants are en
couraged to remind their frosh that dorm
funds do not include bail money. Students are
warned to bring along some extra cash if they
plan to moon a police officer.
The truth behind the hunt is a secret kept
from parents of prospective students. Barron's
"AGuide to the Most (Competitive Golleges" in
cludes a only mild description of Stanford's
freshman San Francisco scavenger hunt:
"We were dropped oil in Union Square with
lists of items to pick up," one frosh narrates.
"We were told to return that evening with a
box of rice-a-Roni, a picture of us in front of
Jerry Garria's former apartment and an op
tional body piercing (no ears), to name only a
lew of the items."
The rice-a-Roni rendition doesn't bear
much resemblance to the countless stories
freshmen from all dorms had to share this year.
San Francisco adventures ranged from the
relatively innocuous — leading a round of the
"Macarena" on a public bus — to the more racy
and scandalous.
Some groups took fountain hopping outside
the bounds of the Stanford campus. Bristin
Jones from Soto jumped in the fountain out
side a fancy hotel to reenact "Jaws."
"I put my hands in a triangle above my head
and pretended I was a shark," she describes,
adding how surprised she was that no security
officers chased her out.

"They were in the middle of the street in
