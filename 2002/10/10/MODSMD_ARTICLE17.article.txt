# Researcher maps crisis areas
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER 
When Rupert Douglas-Bate arrived in l'usla,
Bosnia in 1994 — in the middle of a massive human
itarian crisis — he had a million and a half dollars, 20
projects to complete and no maps.
"1 didn't know where the refugees were, how old
they were, or what their conditions were," Douglas-
Bate said, "and I didn't know where to find the pro
jects that I was assigned."
For the next nine months, Douglas-Bate will be
at Stanford's Center for the Study of Language and
Information on a Reuters Foundation Digital Vi
sion Fellowship, trying to prevent his situation
from happening to future aid workers. He will try
to bring together different departments and cor
porations at Stanford and around the world to de
sign an integrated mapping system for humanitar
ian c rises.
"We don't even have a symbology for humanitari
an situations where we can design maps with hospital
locations and distributions of refugees in a way that
everyone can understand," he said.
Douglas-Bate helped found Aid for Aid, a British
humanitarian organization, to address this problem
in 1999. According to Aid for Aid's Web site, the or
ganization has "arranged access to a huge collection
of maps which are stored on computers in the United
Kingdom by a digital mapping company. This data,
which covers most of the globe, is kept current and, in
particular, maps of disaster-prone areas are regularly
updated by satellite imagery and information from
local sources."
Douglas-Bate came to Stanford to search for new
enthusiasm and intelligence and for better access to
necessary technology.
He is just beginning his research and assembling
his team of assistants, but he has high hopes for the
project.
"There are two phases to the project," Douglas-
Bate said. "The first phase involves developing a pro
totype and simulated exercise here at Stanford,
where mapping technologies can be tested. This can
be shown to non-governmental organizations,
donors and the media. The second phase would in
volve a field test in Ethiopia or West Africa, where co
ordination of NGOs is necessary and difficult."
Aid for Aid has already achieved some progress in
initial mapping efforts.
In Kosovo, NGOs had been working with
refugees to establish small businesses. In April
2000, Aid for Aid mapped NGO concentration
throughout the region and found them over
whelmingly concentrated in the west. They showed
the maps to NGOs and pointed out the problem but

did nothing further.
By November of that same year, when Aid for Aid
reassessed its map, the organizations were distributed
much more equitably across the region, demonstrat
ing that good mapping alone can bring about a
c hange in public policy.
Douglas-Bate is committed to seeing the project
through to completion. "I don't want to end up with
a program that goes in file 13 and is forgotten about,"
he said. "I want to design something that can really
help people. We could save 100,000 lives."
With 15 years of experience on the ground in
Kosovo, Bosnia and Northern Iraq, among other
places, he is acquainted with the problems facing aid
workers. I le anticipates that those problems will only
get larger. " The weather is getting more violent and
the population is booming," he said.
And humanitarian workers have an intense job
and need all the support possible. "Aid workers arrive
in a foreign country, don't speak the language and
must coordinate among groups from around the
world in a matter of hours," he said. Maps are there
fore a basic necessity.
"In an earthquake, there are only four days to pull
victims out of the rubble, and the damage may be
widespread. With limited numbers of dogs and tun
neling equipment, accurate information can save
lives," he said.
Me imagines a scenario where unmanned aerial
vehicles could fly over the sites, making maps of the
areas. Aid workers could then coordinate the distrib
ution of dog search teams and know what areas had
been covered. This information is currently not avail
able, and frequently clogs end up searching the same
areas repeatedly.
"Money only arrives with a crisis, and workers with
very little training are thrown into a social hurricane,"
Douglas-Bate said. "We need to put the poorest of the
poor on the map."
Using geographic information systems, wireless
communications and a Web-enabled mapping sys
tem, Douglas-Bate hopes he can create a lasting pro
gram that will help groups with diverse interests. By
coordinating with the United Nations and focusing
specifically on the task of mapping, he figures his
group can accomplish its goal of a widely distributed
and easily understood mapping system.
This year is the second year the Reuters Digital Vi
sion Fellowship is offered. The program provides a
year of support at CSLI for visiting fellows to work on
using technology to help t he developing world.
Eventually, Douglas-Bate would like to found an
Aid for Aid organization in the United States so lie can
increase the resources to combat a problem that af
fects all aid situations throughout the world.

through to completion. "I don't want to end up with
a program that goes in file 13 and is forgotten about,"
he said. "I want to design something that can really
help people. We could save 100,000 lives."
With 15 years of experience on the ground in
Kosovo, Bosnia and Northern Iraq, among other
places, he is acquainted with the problems facing aid
workers. I le anticipates that those problems will only
get larger. " The weather is getting more violent and
the population is booming," he said.
And humanitarian workers have an intense job
and need all the support possible. "Aid workers arrive
in a foreign country, don't speak the language and
must coordinate among groups from around the
world in a matter of hours," he said. Maps are there
fore a basic necessity.
"In an earthquake, there are only four days to pull
victims out of the rubble, and the damage may be
widespread. With limited numbers of dogs and tun
neling equipment, accurate information can save
lives," he said.
Me imagines a scenario where unmanned aerial
vehicles could fly over the sites, making maps of the
areas. Aid workers could then coordinate the distrib
ution of dog search teams and know what areas had
been covered. This information is currently not avail
able, and frequently clogs end up searching the same
areas repeatedly.
"Money only arrives with a crisis, and workers with
very little training are thrown into a social hurricane,"
Douglas-Bate said. "We need to put the poorest of the
poor on the map."
Using geographic information systems, wireless
communications and a Web-enabled mapping sys
tem, Douglas-Bate hopes he can create a lasting pro
gram that will help groups with diverse interests. By
coordinating with the United Nations and focusing
specifically on the task of mapping, he figures his
group can accomplish its goal of a widely distributed
and easily understood mapping system.
This year is the second year the Reuters Digital Vi
sion Fellowship is offered. The program provides a
year of support at CSLI for visiting fellows to work on
using technology to help t he developing world.
Eventually, Douglas-Bate would like to found an
Aid for Aid organization in the United States so lie can
increase the resources to combat a problem that af
fects all aid situations throughout the world.
When Rupert Douglas-Bate arrived in l'usla,
Bosnia in 1994 — in the middle of a massive human
itarian crisis — he had a million and a half dollars, 20
projects to complete and no maps.
"1 didn't know where the refugees were, how old
they were, or what their conditions were," Douglas-
Bate said, "and I didn't know where to find the pro
jects that I was assigned."
For the next nine months, Douglas-Bate will be
at Stanford's Center for the Study of Language and
Information on a Reuters Foundation Digital Vi
sion Fellowship, trying to prevent his situation
from happening to future aid workers. He will try
to bring together different departments and cor
porations at Stanford and around the world to de
sign an integrated mapping system for humanitar
ian c rises.
"We don't even have a symbology for humanitari
an situations where we can design maps with hospital
locations and distributions of refugees in a way that
everyone can understand," he said.
Douglas-Bate helped found Aid for Aid, a British
humanitarian organization, to address this problem
in 1999. According to Aid for Aid's Web site, the or
ganization has "arranged access to a huge collection
of maps which are stored on computers in the United
Kingdom by a digital mapping company. This data,
which covers most of the globe, is kept current and, in
particular, maps of disaster-prone areas are regularly
updated by satellite imagery and information from
local sources."
Douglas-Bate came to Stanford to search for new
enthusiasm and intelligence and for better access to
necessary technology.
He is just beginning his research and assembling
his team of assistants, but he has high hopes for the
project.
"There are two phases to the project," Douglas-
Bate said. "The first phase involves developing a pro
totype and simulated exercise here at Stanford,
where mapping technologies can be tested. This can
be shown to non-governmental organizations,
donors and the media. The second phase would in
volve a field test in Ethiopia or West Africa, where co
ordination of NGOs is necessary and difficult."
Aid for Aid has already achieved some progress in
initial mapping efforts.
In Kosovo, NGOs had been working with
refugees to establish small businesses. In April
2000, Aid for Aid mapped NGO concentration
throughout the region and found them over
whelmingly concentrated in the west. They showed
the maps to NGOs and pointed out the problem but

did nothing further.
By November of that same year, when Aid for Aid
reassessed its map, the organizations were distributed
much more equitably across the region, demonstrat
ing that good mapping alone can bring about a
c hange in public policy.
