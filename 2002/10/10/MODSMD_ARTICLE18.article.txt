## Cardinal is losing, but Cal still losers 
### 
I. Love. Football on TV. Shots
of Geena Lee. Hanging with
my friends. And — wins!
That's right.
While some guys around cam
pus might prefer two chicks from
the same ovum, my favorite type of
scoring on the weekend is of the six
point variety.
More specifically, I enjoy touch
downs that secure Stanford victo
ries, triumphs, blowouts and old-

fashioned beat
ings. A win by any
other name would
still be as sweet.
Unfortunately,
wins have been
hard to come by in
the early going
and quintuplets
wouldn't be

enough to drown
the sorrows of most Cardinal loot
ball enthusiasts.
I feel you, but cheer up. Ever the
optimist, I give you Cardinal Bins at
least one reason to believe that, in
fact, tilings really could be worse.
The way I see it — through Car
dinal-colored glasses — the only
imaginable thing more dishearten
ing than a 1-3 start (besides an 0-4
start, wise-guy), would be to already
have quadrupled last season's win
total and be well on your way to
qualifying fora bowl game, only to
be banned from postseason play by
the fine organization that is the
NCAA.
Ladies and gentleman, I give you
the 2002 California Golden Bears.
Cue the laughter and mockery, for
when the going gets tough, the
tough find ways to make fun ol Cal.
Granted, it would be much easi

ei to poke fun at (lie Golden Hears it
they were 0-6, but we have to make
do with what we've got, which,
needless to say, isn't much.
The Germans have a word for
finding malicious satisfaction in the
misfortunes of others that I am
hereby adopting into the Stanford
vernacular: schadenfreude. Con
sider it our own twisted version of
Oktoberfest. It's in full effect.
As a result of several NCAA in
fractions, including academic fraud
from the spring semester of 1999
and extra-benefit violations in the
form of hotel phone calls, Cal lost 13
football scholarships in addition to
its one-year bowl ban.
Leave it to Cal to run up illegal
hotel phone charges ranging from
75 cents to $323.03. Three hun
dred twenty-three dollars! And
three cents! Are you kidding me? 1
don't think Student Communica
tion Services, despite their best ef
forts with ridiculous Internet
charges, reaped that much money
from my pocket during my entire
freshman year.
How do you explain charges in
excess of 300 dollars? Was the Psy
chic Friends Network offering some
sort of talk-five-hours-win-one
game-free deal? Did some stoned
lineman pass out with the phone off
t he hook?
Seemingly unfozed by the sus
pension and echoes of "Pursue
them! Pursue them! Make them pay
for their calls!" the Bears opened
the season with wins over their ur
sine friends at Baylor (who also went
a freakishly awful 0-8 in its confer
ence last season) and lowly New

a stellar match against the Bruins, tallying a career-high 12 blocks. The Car
dinal downed UCLA in four games.
