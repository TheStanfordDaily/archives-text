# Not your average club
## Stanford triathlon 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
On any given day, a quick jaunt
around the Stanford campus is al
most guaranteed to lead to more
than a few encounters with swim
mers at the Avery Aquatic Center or
Roble Pool, runners on Campus
Drive and some intense-looking cy
clists onjunipero Sena.
With the emergence of the Stan
ford triathlon club team over the
last three years, it's been increas
ingly likely that you'll even en
counter more than a few people
doing all three.
Given the health-consciousness
of the Stanford community, it prob
ably doesn't surprise too many that
the Farm should Ik- home to a club
dedicated to what has fast become
one of the most popular endurance
sports in the world. Hut what might
catch people's attention is how com
petitive the Stanford triathlon club
has become in such a short time.
Founded in 2000 by Fiona Greg

'01 and current coach Eric Bean, a
graduate student in engineering,
the club has already risen to the top
of the college ranks. Even more im
pressive, il has turned a number of
recreational athletes into nationally
— and internationally — competi
tive triathletes.
"My original goals were to train
for some triathlons, have a good
time and go to [the USA Triathlon]
Collegiate Nationals," said fifth
year medical student Megan Fix,
who was the top finishing American
amateur at the International
Triathlon Union Longdistance
World Championships in Nice,
France, this summer.
"Eric encouraged me that 1
could be top 10 at nationals, and I
was. From that point, it was icing on
the cake. I kept training, did longer
races and ended up qualifying for
worlds and placing third among
amateur women overall."
Fix's story is more the norm than
the exception. In just its third ap
pearance at college nationals last

year in Memphis, Stanford finished
fourth overall and third among the
women, who boasted a pair of top
-10 finishers, Fix and Katyij Meyers
'02. Twenty athletes represented
the club at the race, the first the team
had entered all year.
The team also finished fourth at
the 2001 nationals with 39 team
members present, just a year after
not placing at all in its inaugural ap
pearance in 2000.
Though the Stanford club has
national championships in its im
mediate sights, the group does not
restrict its membership to elite ath
letes by any means.
"We have absolute rookies to
people like Megan and Katya who
have a lot of talent," said Bean,
who also competed in Nice along
with Fix and Meyers. Bean, who
has raced professionally, finished
40th in the men's pro division in
the championships, which consist
ed of a four-kilometer swim, 120

kilometers on the bike and a 30-
kilometer run.
"We have some former varsity
athletes joining us this year, so we
have all the talent we can ask for. At
the other end, we have people who
have never done an endurance
sport and don't even know how to
swim. One thing we want to do is to
promote the sport, so if someone
wants to give it a try and pursue
some personal milestones, we want
to help them reach those goals."
Most of the Stanford club's com
petitions are Olympic-length
triathlons, featuring a kilometer
and-a-half swim, a 40-kilometer
cycle and a 10-kilometer run, dis
tances not nearly as intimidating as
the three-quarters Ironman lengths
that Bean, Fix and Meyers compet
ed at in Nice.
Still, even the Olympic distances
may sound like impossible tasks, es
pecially back to back to back with
only frenzied transition periods in
between.
That's where Bean comes in.
In addition to being the team's
coach, Bean is a master motivator,

inspiring the club's members to
achieve things (hey didn't know
they were capable of.
" The way the club is run is good
for giving people a chance to expe
rience all of the sports," said the
club's current president, junior
Julia Nelson. "We're good at getting
people to chase something amazing.
People don't think they can do a
triathlon, but we show them that
they can do the training and see the
results they want. People are
amazed at the possibilities they have
in them."
The prospect of swimming a
kilometer or more is often the most
intimidating part of a triathlon to a
novice, and Bean admits that it is
often the thing that needs the most
work among the club.
"Swimming requires the most
coaching, the most training and
the most motor skills," he said.
"Everyone knows how to run, but
most have to pay their dues with
swimming."
Not only is swimming the sport
that requires the most training for
the team, it is also the sport that the
team has the hardest time training
for, mostly as a result of a lack of as
sistance from the Department of
Athletics.
The Athletics Department has

routinely refused to give the team
pool time at Avery —though a non-
Stanford swim club is given hours of
time per week — forcing the team to
train in the 25-meter p<x>l at Roble.
"We would need three 90-
minute sessions a week in a 50-
meter pool, and that would do won
ders for the team," Bean said. "But
[the Athletics Department] has
gone out of its way to ignore us. We
have athletes now who could suc
ceed internationally, could go to
Olympic Trials and make the
Olympic team. We really need to
offer them the resources they need
to fulfill their potential."
The team doesn't begin its for
mal training regimen until Novem
ber, but its season gets an early sun t
on Oct. 20 when it hosts the Intra
mural Triathlon.
The 1M Triathlon, which is free
to students, who can just show up
30 minutes before the event, is com
prised of a 400-yard swim at Roble,
a 10-kilometer bike around campus
and a 3-kilometer run around
Laguinita. The club plans to host an
IM Triathlon each quarter this
year, leading up the college nation
als this spring.

club can subscribe to the "triathlon"
Stanford e-mail list.

ber, but its season gets an early sun t
on Oct. 20 when it hosts the Intra
mural Triathlon.
The 1M Triathlon, which is free
to students, who can just show up
30 minutes before the event, is com
prised of a 400-yard swim at Roble,
a 10-kilometer bike around campus
and a 3-kilometer run around
Laguinita. The club plans to host an
IM Triathlon each quarter this
year, leading up the college nation
als this spring.
Those interested in the triathlon
club can subscribe to the "triathlon"
Stanford e-mail list.
On any given day, a quick jaunt
around the Stanford campus is al
most guaranteed to lead to more
than a few encounters with swim
mers at the Avery Aquatic Center or
Roble Pool, runners on Campus
Drive and some intense-looking cy
clists onjunipero Sena.
With the emergence of the Stan
ford triathlon club team over the
last three years, it's been increas
ingly likely that you'll even en
counter more than a few people
doing all three.
Given the health-consciousness
of the Stanford community, it prob
ably doesn't surprise too many that
the Farm should Ik- home to a club
dedicated to what has fast become
one of the most popular endurance
sports in the world. Hut what might
catch people's attention is how com
petitive the Stanford triathlon club
has become in such a short time.
Founded in 2000 by Fiona Greg

'01 and current coach Eric Bean, a
graduate student in engineering,
the club has already risen to the top
of the college ranks. Even more im
pressive, il has turned a number of
recreational athletes into nationally
— and internationally — competi
tive triathletes.
"My original goals were to train
for some triathlons, have a good
time and go to [the USA Triathlon]
Collegiate Nationals," said fifth
year medical student Megan Fix,
who was the top finishing American
amateur at the International
Triathlon Union Longdistance
World Championships in Nice,
France, this summer.
"Eric encouraged me that 1
could be top 10 at nationals, and I
was. From that point, it was icing on
the cake. I kept training, did longer
races and ended up qualifying for
worlds and placing third among
amateur women overall."
Fix's story is more the norm than
the exception. In just its third ap
pearance at college nationals last

year in Memphis, Stanford finished
fourth overall and third among the
women, who boasted a pair of top
-10 finishers, Fix and Katyij Meyers
'02. Twenty athletes represented
the club at the race, the first the team
had entered all year.
The team also finished fourth at
the 2001 nationals with 39 team
members present, just a year after
not placing at all in its inaugural ap
pearance in 2000.
Though the Stanford club has
national championships in its im
mediate sights, the group does not
restrict its membership to elite ath
letes by any means.
"We have absolute rookies to
people like Megan and Katya who
have a lot of talent," said Bean,
who also competed in Nice along
with Fix and Meyers. Bean, who
has raced professionally, finished
40th in the men's pro division in
the championships, which consist
ed of a four-kilometer swim, 120

kilometers on the bike and a 30-
kilometer run.
"We have some former varsity
athletes joining us this year, so we
have all the talent we can ask for. At
the other end, we have people who
have never done an endurance
sport and don't even know how to
swim. One thing we want to do is to
promote the sport, so if someone
wants to give it a try and pursue
some personal milestones, we want
to help them reach those goals."
Most of the Stanford club's com
petitions are Olympic-length
triathlons, featuring a kilometer
and-a-half swim, a 40-kilometer
cycle and a 10-kilometer run, dis
tances not nearly as intimidating as
the three-quarters Ironman lengths
that Bean, Fix and Meyers compet
ed at in Nice.
Still, even the Olympic distances
may sound like impossible tasks, es
pecially back to back to back with
only frenzied transition periods in
between.
That's where Bean comes in.
In addition to being the team's
coach, Bean is a master motivator,

inspiring the club's members to
achieve things (hey didn't know
they were capable of.
" The way the club is run is good
for giving people a chance to expe
rience all of the sports," said the
club's current president, junior
Julia Nelson. "We're good at getting
people to chase something amazing.
People don't think they can do a
triathlon, but we show them that
they can do the training and see the
results they want. People are
amazed at the possibilities they have
in them."
The prospect of swimming a
kilometer or more is often the most
intimidating part of a triathlon to a
novice, and Bean admits that it is
often the thing that needs the most
work among the club.
"Swimming requires the most
coaching, the most training and
the most motor skills," he said.
"Everyone knows how to run, but
most have to pay their dues with
swimming."
Not only is swimming the sport
that requires the most training for
the team, it is also the sport that the
team has the hardest time training
for, mostly as a result of a lack of as
sistance from the Department of
Athletics.
The Athletics Department has

routinely refused to give the team
pool time at Avery —though a non-
Stanford swim club is given hours of
time per week — forcing the team to
train in the 25-meter p<x>l at Roble.
"We would need three 90-
minute sessions a week in a 50-
meter pool, and that would do won
ders for the team," Bean said. "But
[the Athletics Department] has
gone out of its way to ignore us. We
have athletes now who could suc
ceed internationally, could go to
Olympic Trials and make the
Olympic team. We really need to
offer them the resources they need
to fulfill their potential."

mal training regimen until Novem
