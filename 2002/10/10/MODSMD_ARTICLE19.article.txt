# Not your average club
## Stanford triathlon 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
On any given day, a quick jaunt
around the Stanford campus is al
most guaranteed to lead to more
than a few encounters with swim
mers at the Avery Aquatic Center or
Roble Pool, runners on Campus
Drive and some intense-looking cy
clists onjunipero Sena.
With the emergence of the Stan
ford triathlon club team over the
last three years, it's been increas
ingly likely that you'll even en
counter more than a few people
doing all three.
Given the health-consciousness
of the Stanford community, it prob
ably doesn't surprise too many that
the Farm should Ik- home to a club
dedicated to what has fast become
one of the most popular endurance
sports in the world. Hut what might
catch people's attention is how com
petitive the Stanford triathlon club
has become in such a short time.
Founded in 2000 by Fiona Greg

'01 and current coach Eric Bean, a
graduate student in engineering,
the club has already risen to the top
of the college ranks. Even more im
pressive, il has turned a number of
recreational athletes into nationally
— and internationally — competi
tive triathletes.
"My original goals were to train
for some triathlons, have a good
time and go to [the USA Triathlon]
Collegiate Nationals," said fifth
year medical student Megan Fix,
who was the top finishing American
amateur at the International
Triathlon Union Longdistance
World Championships in Nice,
France, this summer.
"Eric encouraged me that 1
could be top 10 at nationals, and I
was. From that point, it was icing on
the cake. I kept training, did longer
races and ended up qualifying for
worlds and placing third among
amateur women overall."
Fix's story is more the norm than
the exception. In just its third ap
pearance at college nationals last

year in Memphis, Stanford finished
fourth overall and third among the
women, who boasted a pair of top
-10 finishers, Fix and Katyij Meyers
'02. Twenty athletes represented
the club at the race, the first the team
had entered all year.
The team also finished fourth at
the 2001 nationals with 39 team
members present, just a year after
not placing at all in its inaugural ap
pearance in 2000.
Though the Stanford club has
national championships in its im
mediate sights, the group does not
restrict its membership to elite ath
letes by any means.
"We have absolute rookies to
people like Megan and Katya who
have a lot of talent," said Bean,
who also competed in Nice along
with Fix and Meyers. Bean, who
has raced professionally, finished
40th in the men's pro division in
the championships, which consist
ed of a four-kilometer swim, 120
