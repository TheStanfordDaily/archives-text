# Law prof takes copyright case to Supreme Court
## 
### MICHELLE KELLER EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford Law Prof. Lawrence Lessig and a
team of lawyers stood before the United States
Supreme Court yesterday morning to address
a pivotal case, Eldred v. Ashcroft, that will de
termine when the public will be allowed to ac
cess copyrighted works such as films, pho
tographs, songs and literature.
Prof. Lessig and his team of 10 lawyers are
arguing the constitutionality of the 1998
Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act,
which stretched the c opyright protection of
songs, films and images from 50 to 70 years
after the author's death, or 95 years after pub
lication if released by a company.
The plaintiffs argue that the writers of the
Constitution intended copyright owners to
hold rights for only a limited time, allowing the
works to be available to the public after the
copyright holders had appropriately received
their compensations.
The Constitution mentions the principle of
copyright in Article 1, but carefully notes that it
should only last "for limited times." The first
copyright law of 1970 assured 14 years of pro
tection with a 14-year renewal. Since then,
whenever copyrights are about to expire, com
panies have taken the issue to court and have
successfully extended the copyright period.
Prof. Lessig and the legal team also contend
that by continuing to extend copyright laws - the
record shows 11 extensions over 40 years —
Congress is succumbing to corporate pressure
to allow companies to hold rights indefinitely.

Stanford Law Prof. Paul Goldstein, who
has worked on the opposing side of the case,
believes that the 1998 Copyright Term Exten
sion Act is only "to achieve parity between
American and European copyright laws."
Undercurrent European copyright laws, a
work created by a European author is protect
ed for 70 years after the death of the author. An
American work in Europe, however, is only
protected as determined by American law.
"An American work released in France, for
example, will only be protected for as long as
thecopyrights protect it in America," " explains
Prof. Goldstein. "This allows for the possibility
of the exploitation of American works all
around the world. Artists, writers, songwriters
will all be denied the royalties that their Euro
pean counterparts are currently entitled to."
'ITie case was officially filed by computer ad
ministrator Eric Eldred, who had published
many books available in the public domain on
the Internet as a hobby until the Copyright
Term Extension Act prevented him from post
ing a selection of Robert Frost poems in 1998.
Eldred first brought up the case Eldred v.
Reno against the Copyright Term Extension
Act in 1998, but lost the case and then ap
pealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
To the surprise of many, the Court agreed
to hear what he had to say.
This time, however, the stakes are high —
if Lessig and his team succeed, thousands of
images, films, songs and books that would
have lost their copyrighted protection in 1998
