# Law prof takes copyright case to Supreme Court
## 
### MICHELLE KELLER EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford Law Prof. Lawrence Lessig and a
team of lawyers stood before the United States
Supreme Court yesterday morning to address
a pivotal case, Eldred v. Ashcroft, that will de
termine when the public will be allowed to ac
cess copyrighted works such as films, pho
tographs, songs and literature.
Prof. Lessig and his team of 10 lawyers are
arguing the constitutionality of the 1998
Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act,
which stretched the c opyright protection of
songs, films and images from 50 to 70 years
after the author's death, or 95 years after pub
lication if released by a company.
The plaintiffs argue that the writers of the
Constitution intended copyright owners to
hold rights for only a limited time, allowing the
works to be available to the public after the
copyright holders had appropriately received
their compensations.
The Constitution mentions the principle of
copyright in Article 1, but carefully notes that it
should only last "for limited times." The first
copyright law of 1970 assured 14 years of pro
tection with a 14-year renewal. Since then,
whenever copyrights are about to expire, com
panies have taken the issue to court and have
successfully extended the copyright period.
Prof. Lessig and the legal team also contend
that by continuing to extend copyright laws - the
record shows 11 extensions over 40 years —
Congress is succumbing to corporate pressure
to allow companies to hold rights indefinitely.

Stanford Law Prof. Paul Goldstein, who
has worked on the opposing side of the case,
believes that the 1998 Copyright Term Exten
sion Act is only "to achieve parity between
American and European copyright laws."
Undercurrent European copyright laws, a
work created by a European author is protect
ed for 70 years after the death of the author. An
American work in Europe, however, is only
protected as determined by American law.
"An American work released in France, for
example, will only be protected for as long as
thecopyrights protect it in America," " explains
Prof. Goldstein. "This allows for the possibility
of the exploitation of American works all
around the world. Artists, writers, songwriters
will all be denied the royalties that their Euro
pean counterparts are currently entitled to."
'ITie case was officially filed by computer ad
ministrator Eric Eldred, who had published
many books available in the public domain on
the Internet as a hobby until the Copyright
Term Extension Act prevented him from post
ing a selection of Robert Frost poems in 1998.
Eldred first brought up the case Eldred v.
Reno against the Copyright Term Extension
Act in 1998, but lost the case and then ap
pealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
To the surprise of many, the Court agreed
to hear what he had to say.
This time, however, the stakes are high —
if Lessig and his team succeed, thousands of
images, films, songs and books that would
have lost their copyrighted protection in 1998

could be released to the public do
main free-of-charge, resulting in
hefty losses to companies such as
The Walt Disney Co. and AOL
lime Warner, Inc. that currently
charge royalties for using their
works.
" The biggest effect of these laws is
to make unavailable an extraordi
nary range of creative material for
next generation's creators," states
the Web site created by Prof.
Lessig's legal team.
"Just as Walt Disney used the
works of the Brothers Grimm to
produce some of the best of the Di s
ney stories, so too should the next
Walt Disney be able to build upon
the stories told by Disney."

Prof. Goldstein presents a differ
ent point of view.
"There is nothing in the cur
rent copyright laws that prevents
scholars from making photo
copies for academic use or from
publishing excerpts and offering
their own characterizations of the
work," Goldstein said. "The main
point of copyright laws is to deter
the illegal replication of these
works for profit."
Many Stanford students were
riled up about the copyright law
extension and supported Lessig's
case.
"So many old songs are held
hostage by copyright laws, and the
companies that own them don't
want to release them, so if you want
access to a song that hasn't been re
leased on tape or CD, you can't get
that song unless you search through
the original records," said junior

Graham Rasmussen.
The author of several books,
Prof. Ix'ssig is an expert on intellec
tual property and Internet law and
serves on the Board of Directors for
Creative Commons, an organiza
tion that promotes the intellectual
and inventive use of copyrighted
material.
"Our aim is not only to increase
the sum of raw source material on
line, but also to make access to that
material cheaper and easier," ac
cording to the Creative Commons
Web site.
"We hope this will enable people
to use the our search application
and other online applications to
find, for example, photographs that
are free to use provided that the
original photographer is credited,
or songs that may be copied, distrib
uted or sampled with no restrictions
whatsoever."
