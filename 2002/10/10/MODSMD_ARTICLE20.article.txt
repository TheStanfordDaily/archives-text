The Stanford women's volleyball team's gut
wrenching 3-2 loss to No. 1 Southern California
Friday night at Maples Pavilion was the kind of
defeat that could permanently derail a team's
season.

at No. 20 Arizona, Friday, 8:00 p.m.

The No. 4 Cardinal's 14-9 lead in the fifth
game, its seven match points in all and its domi
nating performance on the stats sheet were all for
naught. Stanford (13-2, 4-1 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) dropped the decisive game 24-22 to the
Trojans (12-0, 0-0), leaving it a game and a half
behind in the Pac-10 race.
More importantly, the devastating loss —
made worse by a controversial call reversing a
point that had clinched the match for Stanford —
presented an early serious test to the Cardinal's
character, one that would surely change the
course of its national title defense.

"You leave people alone to think about things
on this so they can get to the spot they need to,"
Stanford coach John Dunning said. "If they're
competitive, and I believe our team is, they're
going to come to some good conclusions. I think
they're mad at themselves for putting themselves
in the position we were in and not finishing."
Concerns as to how Stanford would react to
Friday's loss weren't alleviated much on Satur
day, when the Cardinal trudged by No. 13
UCLA (10-0, 3-3) in four games. A remarkably
weak performance by the liruins may have been
the only thing preventing Stanford's third loss
on the season.
But less than a week later, the chin-up Sum
ford team goes on the road to take on No. 22 Ari
zona State (7-3, 3-2) tonight and No. 20 Arizona
(7-0, 2-3) tomorrow. The Cardinal now bears lit
tle resemblance to the head-hanging group that
left Maples over the weekend.
It's a gcx)d thing too, since both Arizona
schools are coming off losses to No. 10 Washing
ton State last weekend that have put their top-25
status on the edge.
"We're more focused and determined than
ever," said junior setter Anna Robinson, who had

a career-high 62 assists in the loss to USC. "We're
fired up to give everything we have in the next
two games, and we're ready for the next game
against [USC lon Nov. 2]. We're trying to fix us on
our ball control this week and maintaining a < 011-
sistent level of energy on the court."
A strong early season that included wins over
three top-15 teams landed the Sun Devils in the
top 25 for the first time since 1996.
Arizona State's 3-0 loss to the (lougars hist Fri
day put a damper on the celebration, however,
and has threatened to end the team's rising
celebrity on the national scene. A win over Stan
ford would undoubtedly revive talk around
Tempe and could virtually seal an at-large Ix rtli
for the Sun Devils in the NCIAA tournament.
"Every team we play wants us badly," Dun
ning said. "They have their own motivations. I'm
sure they'll be playing with lots of confidence."
But the Sun Devils' defense is in fora tough
match, especially if Stanford can keep its passing
up. All five of Stanford's regular attackers are hit
