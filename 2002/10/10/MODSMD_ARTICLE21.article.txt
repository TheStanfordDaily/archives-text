### ANDREA COX EDITORIAL STAFF 
Every game counts, though some more than
others.
On Oct. 2, the No. 1 Cardinal defeated sixth
ranked Pacific in the Tigers' home pool, where
they were previously unbeaten. While the vic
tory was a strong sign of Stanford's condition
and a boost for its morale, it was recorded as a
nonconference game, despite both teams'
membership in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation.
These two rivals meet again tonight at 5:00
p.m. in Stanford's Avery Aquatic Center, this
time in a game that counts toward the all-im
portant MPSF.
Although Pacific is ranked sixth in the na
tion, it is tied for the top spot in the MPSF, while
Stanford has been hovering in fourth place for
t he last two weeks.
" I'he game tomorrow is important for us be
cause it is a conference game," said men's water
polo coach John Vargas. "Pacific has been play
ing well this year. They have always been a
good solid team, but this year might be one of
their better years."
Pacific agrees. The Tigers are confident that
they will get far in the MPSF, relying on Ail-
American juniors Eddie VVisniewski and Nic
Hepner.
"I think we're going to be as competitive as
the top schools in the country," Pacific coach
Courtney Porter said at the beginning of the
season. "Hepner and VVisniewski are two of the
best players in the country and that will allow
our offense to be more direct."
Not only is Pacific strong offensively, but
thanks to a new addition to the team, the Tigers
are impressive in the net as well.
Laurie Trettel, originally from Australia and
a candidiate for the 2004 Australian Olympic
team, came to Pacific to attain his MBA. He has
averaged 7.5 GAA and 4.08 saves per game so
far for the Tigers.
The Cardinal men are prepared to produce
the same outcome of their last matchup with
Pacific.
"We have scouted Pacific, and there are cer
tain tendencies they have defensively and of

fensively," Vargas said. Regarding Trettel, he
said that the team had a pretty good idea "what
his strong points are and how we are going to
try to beat him."
Vargas is the fourth head coach in the histo
ry of the Stanford water polo program and
came to the Farm to fill in for Dante Dettaman
ti, who held the post for 2.5 years up to his re
tirement last season.
Despite Dettamanti's highly successful lega
cy, Vargas has not struggled with t he transition.
"It was easy because of the guys, and it was
easy because of the staff here and the faculty,
and they just welcomed me and they were just
really nice," Vargas said. "The players are just

great, good, solid men, and they are great stu
dent athletes. It was an easy transition mostly
because of the type of people here at Stanford."
Vargas came to lead the Cardinal men from
Orange County, where he was the head coach
for the boy's water polo and swim program at
Corona Del Mar 1 ligh School. I le was also the
head coach of the U.S. men's national team
from 1997 to 2000.
During his tenure, the national team look
first or second place six times at national and in
ternational tournaments (Ist, 1999 Pan-Ameri
can Games, 1998 United States Cup, 1997

Heading into tonight's game,
the Cardinal stands at 12-2 overall
and 1-1 in the MPSF.
"I have high expectations for
the team," Vargas said."f think we
are pretty darn close to being on
track. The games that we have lost
I don't think we played up to our
potential, and that is a good thing.
I would hate to play our best and
just lose."
Vargas confessed of the losses,
"1 believe we didn't give our best,
and the next time we play both
those teams it will be a different
outcome."

will remain at home to face UC-
