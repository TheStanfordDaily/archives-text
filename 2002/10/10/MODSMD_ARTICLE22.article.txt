## 
### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Once again, senior Jim Seki did
his best to lead the Stanford men's
golf team to victory. However, this
week no one else was able to follow
his example.

(869) 11. Stanford (910)

Competing in the Pepperdine
Club Glove Intercollegiate earlier
this week, the Cardinal looked to
maintain the momentum from its
third-place finish in its season open
er last week.
The event took place at the Sati
coy Country Club in Somis, Calif., a
par-72, 6883-yard track that
promised to lie a challenging venue
for the second tournament of the
season. However, that challenge
proved too great, as the team start
ed out slowly, playing its first two
rounds at 22 over par.
Seniors Jim Seki and Ron Won
led the Stanford charge on the
first day. Won carded a 1-over-par
145, putting him in 11th place.
Seki, coming off a third-place
showing at the Windon Memorial,
fired a 2-under-par 142 to occupy
the third spot after the first clay of
competition.
However, the rest of the team
was not able to match the strong
play of Won and Seki.
Junior Blake Mastalir, coming
off a brilliant final round (and sixth
place finish) last week, opened up
with 78-77, leaving him in 49th
place, one shot ahead of sophomore
Kevin Blue.
Sophomore Pat Phillips also
competed for the Cardinal,
recording a 162 for the first two
rounds of play.
After emphasizing a full-team ef

fort all week long, coach Jeff
Mitchell was understandably trou
bled by the first day's results.
"I am very disappointed in our
play," Mitchell said. "After a gotxl
sun t in Chicago, to come out and
not stay focused and composed is
upsetting. Jim Seki and Ron Won
continue to play great golf, but it
takes five to compete at this level."
While the Cardinal struggled
through its first two rounds, host
team Pepperdine shot out to an
early lead in both the team and in
dividual competitions. The defend
ing champion Waves opened with a
5-under-par 283, ending the day
five strokes ahead of UC-Irvine.
Freshman Chris Elliott made a
big early-season impression for Pep
perdine, finishing the first day tied
for first with Irvine's Jeff Coburn at
3 under par.
Having fallen behind early, the
Cardinal knew it would have to per
form well in the final round if it
wanted to move up the leader
board. "With one round to play, we
will have to come out with fire in our
eyes to finish well," Mitchell said.
Instead, Stanford threw it in
reverse.
After totals 0f297 and 301 in its
first two rounds, the Cardinal bal
looned to a final-round 312, 24
over par. This score dropped the
team from its ninth-place perch to
an 11th place finish, just six
strokes ahead of last-place UC-
Santa Barbara.
Won slipped slightly in the final
18 holes, carding a 77 to finish tied
for 15th overall. This strong perfor
mance marked his second top-15
performance in the hist two weeks.
In contrast, Mastalir could never
quite get his game on track in this
event. After a disappointing first
day, a final-round 81 dragged him
down another six spots to finish tied
for 55th place, a far cry from his
sixth-place showing last week.
The struggles of Blue and
Phillips continued in the final
round, as well. Blue's 81 left him
just a shot back of Mastalir.
Phillips rounded out the Cardinal
squad in 02nd.
Despite Stanford's difficulties on
the second day, the play of Jim Seki
continued to provide a silver lin
ing. He followed up last week's
third-place showing with a tit- for
fourth in Soinis. His 1-under-pat

215 locked up a second top-5 finish
of the season.
Seki is currentfy ranked 10th in
the nation by Collweek, and contin
ues to demonstrate that he is among
the elite in today's college game.
In the team competition, UC-
Irvine mounted a comeback on the
second day, going 1 under par as
Pepperdine laded. The Anteaters
edged the defending champs by a
single stroke.
UC-Irvine also took top individ
ual honors, as Jell Coburn won a
one-hole playoff with New Mexico's
Jae Choi.
The Cardinal will look to bounce
back at next week's Mackenzie Invi
tational in Fairfax, Calif.

bled by the first day's results.
"I am very disappointed in our
play," Mitchell said. "After a gotxl
sun t in Chicago, to come out and
not stay focused and composed is
upsetting. Jim Seki and Ron Won
continue to play great golf, but it
takes five to compete at this level."
While the Cardinal struggled
through its first two rounds, host
team Pepperdine shot out to an
early lead in both the team and in
dividual competitions. The defend
ing champion Waves opened with a
5-under-par 283, ending the day
five strokes ahead of UC-Irvine.
Freshman Chris Elliott made a
big early-season impression for Pep
perdine, finishing the first day tied
for first with Irvine's Jeff Coburn at
3 under par.
Having fallen behind early, the
Cardinal knew it would have to per
form well in the final round if it
wanted to move up the leader
board. "With one round to play, we
will have to come out with fire in our
eyes to finish well," Mitchell said.
Instead, Stanford threw it in
reverse.
After totals 0f297 and 301 in its
first two rounds, the Cardinal bal
looned to a final-round 312, 24
over par. This score dropped the
team from its ninth-place perch to
an 11th place finish, just six
strokes ahead of last-place UC-
Santa Barbara.
Won slipped slightly in the final
18 holes, carding a 77 to finish tied
for 15th overall. This strong perfor
mance marked his second top-15
performance in the hist two weeks.
In contrast, Mastalir could never
quite get his game on track in this
event. After a disappointing first
day, a final-round 81 dragged him
down another six spots to finish tied
for 55th place, a far cry from his
sixth-place showing last week.
The struggles of Blue and
Phillips continued in the final
round, as well. Blue's 81 left him
just a shot back of Mastalir.
Phillips rounded out the Cardinal
squad in 02nd.
Despite Stanford's difficulties on
the second day, the play of Jim Seki
continued to provide a silver lin
ing. He followed up last week's
third-place showing with a tit- for
fourth in Soinis. His 1-under-pat

215 locked up a second top-5 finish
of the season.
Seki is currentfy ranked 10th in
the nation by Collweek, and contin
ues to demonstrate that he is among
the elite in today's college game.
In the team competition, UC-
Irvine mounted a comeback on the
second day, going 1 under par as
Pepperdine laded. The Anteaters
edged the defending champs by a
single stroke.
UC-Irvine also took top individ
ual honors, as Jell Coburn won a
one-hole playoff with New Mexico's
Jae Choi.
The Cardinal will look to bounce
back at next week's Mackenzie Invi
tational in Fairfax, Calif.
Once again, senior Jim Seki did
his best to lead the Stanford men's
golf team to victory. However, this
week no one else was able to follow
his example.

Men's Golf
Pepperdine Club Golf Intercollegiate
1. UC-Irvine (868) 2. Pepperdine
(869) 11. Stanford (910)

Competing in the Pepperdine
Club Glove Intercollegiate earlier
this week, the Cardinal looked to
maintain the momentum from its
third-place finish in its season open
er last week.
The event took place at the Sati
coy Country Club in Somis, Calif., a
par-72, 6883-yard track that
promised to lie a challenging venue
for the second tournament of the
season. However, that challenge
proved too great, as the team start
ed out slowly, playing its first two
rounds at 22 over par.
Seniors Jim Seki and Ron Won
led the Stanford charge on the
first day. Won carded a 1-over-par
145, putting him in 11th place.
Seki, coming off a third-place
showing at the Windon Memorial,
fired a 2-under-par 142 to occupy
the third spot after the first clay of
competition.
However, the rest of the team
was not able to match the strong
play of Won and Seki.
Junior Blake Mastalir, coming
off a brilliant final round (and sixth
place finish) last week, opened up
with 78-77, leaving him in 49th
place, one shot ahead of sophomore
Kevin Blue.
Sophomore Pat Phillips also
competed for the Cardinal,
recording a 162 for the first two
rounds of play.
After emphasizing a full-team ef

fort all week long, coach Jeff
Mitchell was understandably trou
bled by the first day's results.

play," Mitchell said. "After a gotxl
