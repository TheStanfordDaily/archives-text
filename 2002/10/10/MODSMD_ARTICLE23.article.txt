# Field hockey readies for its duel with Cal

### SPENCER PORTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The rivalry. The animosity. The Play. The
Big Game. Perhaps these themes conjure up
images of interceptions, bulky pads and run
backs. but when a Stanford team plays Cali
fornia, it doesn't really matter what sport is
being played.
Whatever the venue, sport or gender, the
game is bound to be fierce, heated and close. To
the casual observer, this weekend's field hockey
game may just look like any other for the Car
dinal, but for the Stanford players and coaching
staff, it is much more.
The Cardinal women square off against No.
16 Cal this Saturday in a pivotal match.
Stanford is coming off of a three-game road
trip to Saint Louis, where it improved its record
by posting two wins and one loss, taking it to 8-
7 overall and a perfect 4-0 in the Northern Pa
cific Athletic Conference.
Cal is coming off a road trip of its own. The
Bears went 2-2 on the road, posting two over
time wins, one against NorPac rival Pacific (2-
1) and one against Georgetown. But the Bears
lost to No. 18 Virginia (3-2) and No. 1 Mary
land (3-1). The Bears enter this Saturday's
game with a 7-3 overall record, 2-0 NorPac,
leaving them just one game behind the Cardi
nal in the conference.
"Our goal is to win NorPac," said Stanford
sophomore midfielder Eleanor Morgan. "It felt
good to win [on this past road trip], but at the
same time we still have a huge game ahead of us
against Cal. I think we really need to step up
and focus on things we've been talking about,
like rebounding, circle offense, switching the
field and spreading out."
"We are still undefeated in conference play
and that is great going into the game against
Cal this weekend," said senior tri-captain
Christina Williams. "It is a big game for the
team, and it will be a good test playing at their
new turf field. Cal always has a lot of rowdy fans,
and it will be good to have to play through that
and just focus on the game. It is going to be a
great game and Stanford is going to win."
The Cardinal may feel good about its up
coming game, but recent history is decidedly in

favor of the Bears.
Cal has won seven of the last nine contests
between the teams and the last three in Berke
ley. Stanford's last win at Cal was in 1998 to seal
a perfect 5-0 NorPac record.
Saturday's game could prove cathartic for
the Cardinal, which needed a win at Berkeley
last year to claim sole possession of the Nor-
Pac crown and another win against Berkeley
in the NorPac postseason tournament. Stan
ford lost both games, finishing as co-champi
ons of the NorPac.
Stanford has won 14 of its last 16 NorPac
games, its only two losses being at the hands

of Cal.
Two of the NorPac's best players will face off
I his weekend as they attempt to lead their teams
to victory.
Stanford's freshman goalkeeper Ana
Kralovec was named the NorPac Rookie of the
Week for the second time this season after
posting four consecutive'scoreless halves. Cal's
junior co-captain Nora Feddersen was named
NorPac Offensive Player of the Week for her
work in Cal's past four games. She scored a
goal in each match, including both overtime
sudden-death goals against Pacific and
Georgetown.
