### MARK DOMINIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
Residential Education lias asked three Columbae staff
members, who are accused of stealing from the Stanford
Bookstore, to move out of the house by 8 a.m. on Mon
day. (Columbae residents have questioned the fairness of
removing them from their posts and from the house, not
ingthat the three have not been found guilty and that the
house as a whole could suffer from their departure.
On Sept. 27, Columbae's house and social manager,
financial manager and resident assistant were caught al
legedly stealing books from the Bookstore. Charged
with petty theft and facing a civil lawsuit from the Book
store, the three will appear in court on Nov. 13. The fi
nancial manager said that the Bookstore has offered to
settle the civil action for $275 a person.
According to the house and social manager, the
value of the items they are accused of stealing varies be
tween $ 150 and $250 a person.
At this point the three plan to enter a plea of not
guilty. They contest that it is unfair for the University to

take punitive action before their
hearing.
"We were originally called in by
[Residence Dean] Anne Dowd and
[Student Affairs Officer] Augie Gal
van," the house and social manager
said. "The decision to remove us
from Colu mbae had already been
laid down by then. We told our side
of the story, and immediately after
ward, Augie told us he'd reconsider.
Two days later, he said that we
would have to leave.
"I was veiy emotional — I was
bawling and pleading," the staff
member continued. "Our main
frustration is the punishment
doesn't fit the crime."
Jane Camarillo, director of Resi
dential Education, said that expec
tations for house staff are higher
than those for other students: Staff
who break the law are asked to step
down from their positions.
" I Tie residential staff and any stu
dent who assumes a formal leader
ship position with Residential Educa

tion also signs an agreement stating
that they will not violate University
policy," Camarillosaid. "Student staff
are also told that die consequences
for breaking the law and / or violat
ing University policy would be termi
nation in the position.
"The trust that is placed [on stu
dents] in these leadership posi
tions is so important not only to the
members of the housed communi
ties but to the University and when
that trust is broken, it is important
to hold students accountable
While the privilege of being a staff
member is revoked, it does not
necessarily mean that the student
will not be allowed to continue as
an enrolled student nor do we
withhold resources and support,"
she continued.
Yesterday, a delegation of stu
dents from Columbae met with
Gene Awakuni, vice provost for
student affairs. They voiced their
concern that the staff members
were being treated unfairly and
that the decision to fire them from
their positions had been made too
quickly.
Although Awakuni delayed die
termination of the staff members'

employment and the date of their
expected move-out from yesterday
until Monday, he did not overturn
the decision originally reached by
Residential Education.
"Awakuni basically supported
the decision reached by Jane and
Augie, although he seemed to
admit that it was a bit harsh to kick
us out so soon and before our
court date," the house and social
manager said.
House members are uncertain
about the future of the house staff.
"The University's decision for
our replacement is that the RA is to
come from what Augie calls his 'cen
tralized pool' of RAs — that is, three
candidates we rejected," the house
and social manager added. "The
other two skiff members would be
drawn from the house."
Camarillo explained that Resi
dential Education would work
hard to replace the staff members
with people compatible with the
house.
"Our goal is to insure that, given
the circumstances, the best candi
date can be found who can continue
to support the program in the house
as well as the students wfio live

there," Camarillo said. "In the case
of a co-op, these new staff member s
must be committed to the consensus
style of decision-making on the busi
ness, program and even room as
signments of the house."
But because Collimbae offers no
compensation to staff members
other than the RA, the house and so
cial manager speculated that find
ing two new staff members would be
difficult.
And Luke Biewald, a senior and
Colu mbae resident, said that he
feels like the whole house is being
punished for the actions of a few.
"I think it would be really bad for
the house to lose these staff members,"
Biewald said. "You can'tjust replace
your RAor financial manager.
"file University doesn't realize
what a big deal it would be to replace
a manager in Columbae — it's a huge
amount of work. You can'tjust bring
in any old person," he continued.
Biewald also was puzzled by the
correlation of the punishment to the
crime.
"The punishment doesn't seem
to fit the crime: You steal something
and you get kicked out of your
house?" he said.
