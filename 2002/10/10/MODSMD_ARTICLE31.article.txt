### EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Co Ho will be alive this weekend with
two live music events presented by the Stan
ford Concert Network. Tonight at Tresid
der, the horribly decorated Coffee House will
feature a free rock concert by Pseudopod at
10 p.m. Tomorrow night, Philly MC esteban
will perform with DJ Supa at the Hip-Hop /
Open Mic night, starting at 8 p.m. Presented
below is a little extra info about each artist in
the hopes of getting you kids to attend the
first in a series of Fall Co Ho concerts brought
to us by our friendly neighborhood SCN.
Pseudopod
Most bands that come together in college
never make it past their finals, senior year.
Fhe four UCLA alumni known as Pseudo
pod have not only survived graduation,
they've parlayed their tight but loose mix of
jazzy rhythms, classic rock riffage and pop
sensibilities into a fervent following of tape
trading, set list-discussing and road-tripping
fans. Now those fans can enjoy Pseudopod in
the comfort of their own homes with band's
self-titled debut on Interscope Records.
The collection of tunes on the album is

one that will appeal to fans of catchy shit as
much as it will to fans of intricate jam rock.
It'll also connect old Pseudopod fans and re
cent converts, as it's dominated by new tunes
(including "all Over You," "Dante" and "In
tentions," which is the album's first single) but
is peppered with such familiar favorites as
"Shrinks." Check out the band tonight at 10
p.m. at the Co Ho fora jazz rocking good
time.
esteban
Most hip hop today is either so radio
friendly that it lacks content, or so full of con
tent that radio stations shy away from it.
Newcomer, esteban, a Philly native, bridges
the gap between underground and main
stream hip hop music. His combination of
potent lyrics and catchy beats offer a sound
that will appeal to a broad audience of listen
ers. "I make music for everybody," explains
esteban. His lyrics, or spit game, is the most
important aspect of his music, esteban de
scribes his songs as "potent" because "you can
listen to my songs over and over again, and
each time you'll find new meanings in my
words."
Despite his lyrical focus, esteba- under

stands that he has to bring more than hot
lyrics and punch-lines to the table. "I make
music that will make you dance and bob
your head, but at the same time if you
dropped the beat, you would still be caught
up in what I'm saying. Most music, if you
drop the beat, you would turn off the song
because the lyrics are trash, but I reward
my listeners for paying close attention to
what I'm saying. I'll entertain you with or
without a beat!"
esteban's track record includes opening
for major label artists, Fat Joe and Big Pun
isher, getting radio spin on Philly's top hip
hop stations, and being featured on Illest
Unsigned Artists in Philly Volume 1. This
past August, esteban released a compilation
album, entitled Will Rhyme for Food on his
Philly-based indie record label. The title
for the album represents his desire fora
major label record deal. "I'm hungry fora
deal," exclaims esteban.The album con
tains a number of different artists, with es
teban contributing six of the 15 tracks.
When asked about his future plans, esteban
says that he is working on his solo album,
due out this winter, and that he is constant
ly recording new material and working to

get more exposure for himself. Check out
esteban, along with DJ Supa, at 8 p.m. on
Friday at the Co Ho and then stick around
for open-mic performances into the late
evening.


If you come to my show, I'll unzip this hoodie.
