# Festival honors Japanese cinema legend
## 
### OLIVER RIZK 
Without a doubt, Stanford
students are very lucky to be so
close to San Francisco and all of
the exciting events the city has to
offer each month. Of particular
interest this month is a three
week film festival showcasing the
collaborations of Japanese direc
tor Akira Kurosawa and actor
Toshiro Mifune. This amazing
body of work, spanning almost
two decades from the late 1940s
to the mid 19605, will be shown
exclusively at the recently re
stored Castro Theater.
The Castro will be premier
ing new prints of all featured
films, including a newly restored
and re-subtitled 35 mm print of
"The Seven Samurai," possibly
Kurosawa and Mifune's most fa
mous film. However, none of the
other classic 11 films made by
the duo deserve any less atten
tion, nor does the film "Ikiru,"

which features Takashi Shimu
ra, another of Kurosawa's fa
vorites, rather than Mifune. In
each of his films, Kurosawa suc
ceeds in capturing an amazing
degree of human emotion and
beauty that has since inspired
great directors around the
world. Whether through the
striking portrayal of a troubled
police officer, a starving thief or
a proud samurai, Mifune works
beautifully as the conduit for
Kurosawa's analysis of human
nature. Whether it is action,
mystery, comedy or touching
drama that you are in the mood
for, together, Kurosawa and Mi
fune deliver.
The schedule of screenings
