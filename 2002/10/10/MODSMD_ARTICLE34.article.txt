# TV movie fails to deliver porn, laughs
## 
### DAVID WELD 
"Porn 'n Chicken," the first
original feature film produced by
Comedy Central, is a mediocre TV
movie about something that was
actually kind of cool in real life.

A few years ago, a
bunch of students at 1
Yale founded a sort of
proto-secret society,
the noble purpose of
which was to bring its
members together
weekly to eat Popeye's
fried chicken and
watch porn movies.

When asked why, one of the
founders told a reporter they did it
"because fried chicken tastes great,
and porn is video of people having
sex with each other." Presently,
they were inspired to make their
own porn movie, starring various
members of the Yale student body.
The film was to be called " The
Staxxx," after the location of the
climactic scene and the holy grail of
Ivy league campus sex. (I'm only a
grad student, and didn't go here
for undergrad, so I don't even
know what the equivalent is out
here. Surely not Meyer. FroY
oBlow?)
Anyway, it's not such a bad
story, right? However, made-for-
TV movies have a way of sucking
the vitality out of any plot, and this
one is no exception. Rather than
use this true-life story as a spring
board from which to launch an en
tertaining but provocative exami
nation of the multifoliate
hypocrisies inherent in our soci
ety's attitudes towards pornogra
phy and transgression, Comedy

Central chose to make a plain
vanilla college movie, which as
usual means a pretty straight-up
clone of "Animal House." The
leading man, played with a sort of

autistic Wiley Wiggins
vibe by Ebon Moss-
Bachrach, is at first a
i l

reluctant pornographer be-

cause he does not
want to risk his
chances of getting
into Yale law school.
Eventually, though,
he overcomes his
doubts, risking dou
ble-secret-probation

to defy Dean [Wormer] and the
hidebound conservative Universi
ty administration. A montage se
quence or two later, the rebellious
students are triumphant, and the
movie ends in a flurry of collegiate
nostalgia. He gets the girl, too.
Sorry if I ruined it for you.
The producers do, however,
deserve some credit for persuad
ing veteran porn stars Ron Jeremy
and Jenna Jameson to appear in
(fully-clothed) cameos. In fact, just
watching Ron Jeremy, who is an
absolute ruin of a man, try to talk is
probably much more entertaining
than that hypocrisy-examining
thing I mentioned above. Another
relatively bright spot is the jovial
performance turned in by Geof
frey Arend, as gay puppeteer
Andy. In any case, "Porn 'n Chick
en" suffers from two ultimately
fatal defects: It is almost entirely
unoriginal, and there is no actual
porn in it.
