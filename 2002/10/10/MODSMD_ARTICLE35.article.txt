# The 						Rules of Dysfunction
## Or, how to alienate your teenage fanbase in one easy step 
### JESSICA SCOTT ALLISON GANZ 
Have you ever wanted to see
Stanford's own Fred Savage
shooting up? Or Dawson on
shrooms fucking a coked-up
Mary from "Seventh Heaven?"
Want to see what the rest of the

college adolescents have

been up to while
you've been in I-
Hum? Well, "The
Rules of Attraction"
might be the movie for
you. Unfortunately,
while Roger Avary's
adaptation of Bret
Easton Ellis' novel gets

high marks iti the
shock department, it fails to live
up to its lofty artistic ambitions.
The satirical viewpoint and the
many subplots that brought the
novel so much praise are lost in
the translation to screen. Ellis'
intriguing story of the wealthy
and disturbed students at "Cam
den College" is often overshad
owed by Avery's fancy camera
tricks and overt attempts to shat
ter the stereotypical college film.
The characters are introduced
to us at the "End of the World"
party, in which Lauren (Shannyn
Sossoman), the sensitive and in
sightful undergrad, loses her vir
ginity in a highly disturbing fash
ion. Meanwhile Lauren's ex
boyfriend, Paul (played well by
newcomer lan Somerhalder), who
has recently come out of the closet,
is involved in one of his many one
sided obsessions with an unattain
able fiat-boy. The charismatic and
tortured main character, Sean
Bateman (James Van der Beek) is
partaking in one of his many fe
male conquests throughout the
film. In case you recognize his
name, Sean Bateman is the little
bro of Ellis' serial killer Patrick
Bateman from "American Psy
cho." The character's voiceovers
then take us back in time to ex
plain how the story evolved to
this point.
Avery uses many different visu
al storytelling techniques to devel
op a love triangle between Sean,
Lauren and Victor (Kip Pardue).
Sean develops an obsession with
Lauren, despite the fact that she is
saving herself for Victor, who has
been abroad all semester. The sit
uation becomes more twisted as
Lauren's oversexed roommate
Lara (Jessica Biel), known for her
exploits with the football team, en
ters the picture.
Writer / director Avary devel

ops the episodic story line with
various filmic techniques, some of
which will be familiar from his
Oscar-winning, co-written screen
play for "Pulp Fiction." The arti
fices that worked in "Pulp Fiction"
are unable to compensate for the
underdeveloped connections be
tween the characters in "Rules."
Avery's venture into commentary
on bourgeois society is poignant at
times, but is often befuddled by
the disjointed story. Amidst the
problems with Avery's incessant
camera tricks, his stylized clirec

tion at times does hit the mark. For
example, the sped-up voice over
and rapid shots of Victor's digi
tal diary from his back-packing
trip through Europe are origi
nal and effective.
In conclusion, the film deserves
some praise for not shying away
from the extreme and, for at times,
capturing a sense of college life.
The shock element and the youth
oriented subject matter may be
enough to warrant a viewing, but
if your expectations exceed that,
you will be disappointed.


Up Dawson's Creek.
