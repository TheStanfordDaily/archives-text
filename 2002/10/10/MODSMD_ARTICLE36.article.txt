# 'A rush of blood to the... head?'
## 
### CHRIS LEE 
To borrow a phrase from Sum 41, Cold
play's first album — 2000's "Parachutes" —
was a litde bit killer, mostly filler. .Aside from
the majestic stargazing of the hit single "Yel
low" and lead singer Chris Martin's gorgeous
caterwauling on "Trouble," "Parachutes"
was more mood piece than album, a pleasant
but lukewarm experience.
From the very first listen of "A Rush of
Blood to the Head," it's readily apparent that

Coldplay has advanced in
style and technique. If any
thing, they've become
more lachrymose, more at
ease with what they want to
say — while the easygoing
pace of "Parachutes" al
ready seemed indulgent,
"Rush of Blood" is down-

right self-absorbed. Chalk this up to the
band's modus operandi, described by Martin
as making music fueled solely by passion and
melody. Apparently for these boys, passion is
only deliverable in melancholy chords and
sluggish tempos.
Herein lies the paradox of Coldplay —
seeking to embody passion, the emotional
heft of their music often ends up slowing it to
a disinterested crawl. "I'm gonna buy a gun

and start a war / if you can tell me something
worth fighting for" is a line we hear on the
album's eponymous track, and it's easy to
mistake Coldplay's "passion" for sheer apa
thy. There are times during the music when
you feel ready to scream, desperate to pull
the group out of their introspective cocoon so
that we might have just one track that ex
plodes in an unsuppressed orgy of joyous
ebullition.
Which is not to say that the album doesn't
succeed in several respects. "Politik," the first

Coldplay
"A Rush of
Blood to the
Head"

track, is a well-layered piece
that builds towards the rest of
the album and immediately
demonstrates Coldplay's new
musical sophistication.
"Clocks" feels like a lovechild of
U2 and Moby's piano, while
"Warning Sign" is more oddly
light and upbeat than one

would expect. And for every track that gets
mired in mawkishness, there's at least anoth
er that manages to transcend the torpor, be
coming timeless instead of endless. The first
single, "In My Place," seems to literally make
time stand still with its bright guitar hooks,
while "The Scientist" starts out with gentle
piano chords that hold up the soothing tones
of Martin's all-enveloping voice. Gorgeous
stuff', and well worth slogging through the

rest of the album
for.
Coldplay has
often been re
ferred to as Ra
diohead lite, and
though Martin
does sound eeri
ly like Thorn
Yorke at times,
the title seems
unfitting. "Whis
per" almost ap
proaches some
thing off of "Kid
A" with its incan
tatory lyrics and
nebulous guitar
fuzz, but com
paring the two is
like comparing a
musical to an

opera. One might be tempted to call the dole
ful atmosphere of this album dense and cere
bral, but in truth it's nowhere near the tex
ture and complexity of Radiohead. Nor does
it aspire to be.
"A Rush of Blood to the Head" isn't per
fect, often too enamored with itself, but it's
worth it to watch Coldplay's distinctive style
evolve. There's a willingness to explore, to

defy convention, as witnessed by the fact
that half the tracks are over five minutes
long — hardly radio-friendly - but the sub
stance has yet to appear. Transparent lyrics
and pacing problems aside, Coldplay
shows plenty of promise. "How long must
you wait for me?" Martin asks repeatedly in
"In My Place." If this is what Coldplay is ca
pable of, then the answer is: indefinitely.
