# Beck grows up, gets melancholy
## 
### MIKE ORME 
When describing Beck, one in
variably uses the word "Loser."
Not surprising since Beck first
achieved alterna-stardom with his
single of the same name nine years
ago. Since then, Beck's alleycat
folk-hop has landed him a spot
among the '90s most influential
musicians, and he has carried the
flag for smart slackers, funky
swingers and crooning bluesmen,
all with two turntables, a micro
phone and a dream.
With the new decade comes
"Sea Change," Beck's first release
since 1999s "Midnite Vultures,"
and like the Bush administration,
it brings a host of changes. Where
as "Vultures" served up come
hither 70s funk, a fitting sound
track to a bourgeois sex party, "Sea
Change" has more in common
with Beck's 1998 release "Muta
tions." Recorded in two weeks,
"Mutations" is a dreamy, turned
down ode to spacey '60s kitsch,
channeling folk icon Nick Drake at
its best ("Nobody's Fault") and bad
Bob Dylan at its worst ("O Maria").
No noise, just playful folk.
Critics will inevitably compare
"Sea Change" to "Mutations," be
cause Beck's latest album sounds
more like "Mutations" than any-

thing else in his catalogue. How
ever, this misses the point. Beck
has roughly the same musical aim
on both, but the emotions on each
run much differently. Whereas
"Mutations" has a sense of humor
and a kitschy glamour, "Sea
Change" is genuinely sad. In
"Change's" best moments, Beck is
still ripping off Nick Drake, but
the gloss is gone.
About the music: "Change" is
excellent. The tracks range from
good ("The Golden Age," "Guess
I'm Doing Fine") to inspired
("Paper Tiger," "Lonesome
Tears"). What's more, this album
actually showcases Beck's voice.
On tracks like "Round the Bend,"
Beck trades in his "Pay No Mind"
growl for an aching Nick Drake
crow. And on the drunken "Little
One," Beck returns to old form
with unsettling ease and even
more unsettling chord changes.
The closer, "Side of the Road,"
succinctly sums up "Change's"
sound: musical simplicity domi
nated by acoustic guitars and sin

cere lyrical angst.
To be honest, I didn't like "Sea
Change" at first. It was not until
about the tenth listen, sitting at
my desk in the dark at 3 a.m.,
wearing my huge nerdy head
phones, that I finally got caught
up in the sweeping strings and
Beck's textured tenor. The album
is hard to get into, especially if
(like me) you're expecting a se
quel to "Midnite Vultures" or
Beck's brilliant 1996 opus "Ode
lay." Here, Beck radiates serious,
grown-up sadness, not Loser pos
turing or Junkyard Kids noise.
This ain't your daddy's Beck, but
it's very good.
Beck is 32. With "Sea Change,"
his guitar-and-turntables act has
entered its second recording
decade. In 2002, Gen-Xers are
having kids and losing hair, and
Beck's "Loser" moniker seems un
fitting. After spending some quali
ty time with "Sea Change," I'm al
most tempted to now simply call
Beck "old." But that wouldn't do
justice to the talented Mr. Hansen
and his excellent, if uncharacteris
tic, album. So for now, I'll label this
"grown-up" Beck and wait for next
year's "Midnite Vultures 2." In the
meantime, I can be found in my
room, spinning "Sea Change" in
the dark.
