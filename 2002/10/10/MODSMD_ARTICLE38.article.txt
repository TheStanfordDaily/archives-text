# How goddamn cool is Paul Thomas Anderson?
## 
### JULIAN WASS 
Paul Thomas Anderson is a
fucking star. You can tell by the
way his entrance silences the film
snob chatter of 10 too-cool-for
school college reporters. Further
doubts are quelled when each one
of those kids, having not broken
their grown up reporter facade for
the entire hour-long interview
sheepishly request pictures, hand
shakes and autographs, as the star
director leaves. The word "star" is
rarely used to describe a writer/di
rector, but Anderson is different
from other filmmakers. He never
cameos in his films, but he should;
with his tousled hair and piercing
blue eyes, he has both the looks
and appeal of a movie star.
That is perhaps part of what has
given the young director the rock
star-like following he has enjoyed
since the 1997 release of "Boogie
Nights." In Anderson, many aspir
ing filmmakers have found a per
fect idol; he expresses a youthful
excitement about films and film
making that is often lost among
Hollywood directors. Meanwhile,
with every film, he continues to
prove that a brilliant storyteller
and visualist can come from a place
like Studio City, a middle class sub
urb of Los Angeles.
For his latest film, "Punch-
Drunk Love," Anderson once
again sets the bulk of his story in
the San Fernando Valley. While
regulars Luis Guzman and Philip
Seymour Hoffman return, and An
derson's fourth film retains the
same offbeat tone as his previous
works, many consider "Punch-
Drunk Love" to be a departure for

the director. Unlike the sprawling,
two-and-a-half hour plus epics of
"Boogie Nights" and "Magnolia,"
which dealt with pornographers,
drug addiction and twisted family
relations, "Punch-Drunk Love" is a
90 minute romantic comedy star
ring Adam Sandler. Sandler plays
Barry Egan, a troubled man driven
to bouts of intense rage by his seven
overbearing sisters and whose life
takes a turn when a harmonium
suddenly appears outside of his
warehouse.
Anderson shakes off most in
quiries into his films' more bizarre
moments, stating simply, "1 don't
think it's that fucking hard to un
derstand, its not complicated —
fucking harmonium dropped in
the guys lap ... gotta learn how to
fix it, gotta learn how to play it...
dude trying to find his music, dude
trying to get in tune. That explains
it all pretty much right there."
In a candid roundtable inter
view, Paul Thomas Anderson
spoke casually about his life-long
love of movies, on shooting in
Hawaii for the first time and most
importantly, what makes "Punch-
Drunk Love" the strangest, most
psychedelic romantic comedy that
you'll ever see.
Anderson describes himself as
someone who "wanted to make
films from the beginning." His ear
liest film experiences were as much
about traditional Hollywood fare
like "Jaws" and "Rocky" as they
were about the films of indepen
dent and foreign directors, such as
Robert Downey Sr. and Jacques
Tati. While "Boogie Nights" and
"Magnolia" have drawn compar
isons to films by Martin Scorsese

and Robert Altman, Anderson cites
Tati as his main influence on
"Punch-Drunk Love." "Tati is cool
as fuck... complete choreography
and great control, but it still feels
fresh and funny and accidental. I
was just trying to steal some of that.
It's like silent movies but with
sound; You don't know what fuck
ing language they're in — 'cause
they're in French, but they're in
English, but they're in gibberish.
They are really universal, and I
love that. If I could make a movie
like that, that was universal, that
didn't need subtitles, that's proba
bly the perfect movie."
Anderson went on to explain
that although much of his film
making is inspired by the films he
has absorbed, he encourages direc
tors to move beyond their influ
ences. "If you love movies you're
always gonna love movies, it's
there, it's getting the other things
that really should inspire. The sec
ond I stopped really being inspired
by movies was the second I felt like
I had my own voice in saying what
I was trying to say. Picasso spent his
whole youth trying to paint like the
masters and then he spent all of his
adult life trying to learn to paint
like a child ... to get rid of all that
fucking shit that he put in his
mind."
When conceiving a film, .Ander
son always keeps the audience in
mind. "Its nice to always think
about audience. Some directors say
'I made this movie for myself.' I
fucking wouldn't want to see that
— like watching their home videos,
that would be boring. I think, 'Is
this gonna get them, is this gonna
make them laugh?' You always

have to be aware of it, how is this
gonna go down, in the momentum
of an emotional response."
For "Punch-Drunk Love," writ
ing for an audience was at the heart
of its synthesis. Anderson wrote the
film in Hawaii, while making mul
tiple trips to the local multiplex. "It
was just fun to go to a packed the
ater in the mall in Hawaii on a Fri
day night and just try to think
about how to try and communicate
to this audience that you're sitting
in front of. I wanna write a movie
that will play well here."
Anderson also attributes some
of the feel of "Punch-Drunk Love"
to writing it in a different setting.
"[ Fhe] most important thing was

that I went somewhere else.
Doesn't everyone feel like more of
an artist when you're not at home?
Like getting out of your fucking
house somehow makes you feel
like 'I'm an artist, anything's possi
ble, I can behave in a more honest
mindset.'"
"Also it's nice if you can go
swimming. If you can go swim
ming as much as you can while
your writing it seems to work for
me. Writing in the morning and
then making sure the rest of the
day was occupied by physical stuff,
getting out of the fucking house,
getting into the ocean. Anything
but writing, anything but staring at
your fucking computer."
Two aspects of "Punch-Drunk
Love" that will shock Anderson's
fans are its length, which clocks in
at a svelte 90 minutes, and that the
star of the film is Adam Sandler.
Any suspicions regarding San
dler's ability should be soothed
purely by the fact that an auteur
like Paul Thomas Anderson wrote
the part specifically for him, but
even the most hardcore doubters
should realize by five minutes into
the film that Sandler's perfor
mance isn't good for Adam San
dler, it's just good.
Anderson, a self-proclaimed
Adam Sandler fan, cited Sandler's
Saturday Night Live sketch "The
Denise Show" as the point when he
knew he had to work with the
actor. Even though .Anderson saw
a deeper man under the zaniness
of Sandler's high-energy persona,
he knew that he wanted to harness
the comedian's wild side. "1 think I
always loved it when he gets mad in
movies and I wanted him to do that
in my movie. I love it when he
screams. He always has a moment
of craziness. [Not using it] would be
like buying a jeep and not driving
it in the mountains."
