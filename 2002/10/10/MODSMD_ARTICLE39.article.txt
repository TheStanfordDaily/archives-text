# The
						Agenda will give you hot pants

### RYAN SANDS 
When I was in high school, my
friends and 1 used to cruise
around our quiet Midwestern
town blasting old Rolling Stones'
albums at two in the morning. It
made us feel like badasses, like we
wore leather jackets and cut fools
who crossed our paths. Sadly, I
could only listen to "Hot Rocks" a
few thousand times before I start
ed to need something new to vent
my teenage restlessness to. Luck
ily for the swaggering punk kid

The Agenda
| Start the Panic

still inside of me, I've found a new
album to rock out to during my
aimless drives in the middle of
the night. The Agenda's "Start
the Panic" is a volatile firecrack
er of an album, with fast, sweaty
jams fueled by angst, dirty gui
tars and sexual frustration.
This isn't your friendly
neighborhood Strokes. These
kids are mods, and they got the
haircuts to prove it. As The
Agenda stress in their interviews
and lyrics, they aren't garage
rock revivalists, and they aren't
trying to start a revolution.
They just want kids to dance, to
get sexy with each other and to
live the fast rock-n-roll life. This
sort of thing has been done be
fore, sure, but "Start the

Panic's" mixture of mod sensi
bilities and hardcore's raw ener
gy add up to one of the most ur
gent and explosive albums I've
heard all year.
The new rock rebels hail
from Athens, Georgia, of all
places. Their debut LP is being
released on Kindercore records,
which is best known for such pop
bands as Of Montreal and Dressy
Bessy. The Agenda stick out

among their keyboard

and surf pop peers,
but bring a rough

'n' tumble, 'just don't
give-a-fuck' flair to the

O
label. They're like the punk
kids that smoked out be
hind your high school and

tagged up the bathroom — you
worry that they'll smash the
place up, but you feel cool as hell
just to hang out around them.
Like all great rock '11' rollers,
the members of The Agenda use
stage monikers. The Agenda
are: lan the Face on bass, Digital
Dan on organ, Switchblade Ste
vie on drums, Ryan Riot on gui
tar and J. R. Suicide on lead vo
cals. Lan and Ryan both sing, but
nine of "Start the Panic's" 11

songs are sung by Justin (JR.) in
his raw, punk rock Jon Spencer
yarl. His howl reflects the band's
hardcore roots and really makes
shivers go down my spine.
After listening to dozens and
dozens of garage-rock records
that have come out in the past
few years, its refreshing to here
a band that really gets it, that
can really capture the energy
and fury of rock-n-roll on an
album. Along with Justin's awe
some voice, the band's special
something comes from Dan's
electric organ which adds a
chunky blues sound to tracks
like "I Want The Panic!" and
"Last Chance For Action!"
The album's lyrics stick to
central mod-core themes: danc
ing and thrashing around, get
ting sexy with ladies and rock '11'
roll rebellion. They say 011 the
back of the album, "We are the
arrogant hooligans of chaos and
disorder with the sonic boom of
electric guitars!" And they fuck
ing mean it. Every song is super
rad, with the best tracks being
"Shake! Shake! Scream!" about
the sexual prowess of a teenage
hoodlum girl, and "Hot Pants"
which almost boils over with
sexual innuendo and sassiness.
Fhe biggest and best news I've
heard lately is that The Agenda
may be PLAYING AT STAN
FORD in November. On the
band's site, they have "Palo Alto,
CA - Stanford" penciled in for
■ Nov. 18,

and I've

heard through the
grapevine that this concert may
be taking place at Chi Theta
Chi. As this goes to print, the de
tails of this show are a bit fuzzy,
but please email Intermission if
you have any info. If the Agenda
do come and play a house show,
you can believe that it'll be the
best on-campus party of the
year. And I'll be there in tight
pants and a tie, writhing and
dancing, feeling like a badass all
over again.
