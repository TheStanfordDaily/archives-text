# Concert marks Pearl's birthday

### SARAH PAPÉ EDITORIAL STAFF 
Daniel Pearl, Class of '85, died earlier
this year because lie was a journalist
seeking answers. But tonight, on the clay
Pearl would have turned 39, he will be
remembered simply as someone who
loved music.
The free concert, which will take
place at 8 p.m. in Memorial Church, is
one of many events that are a part of
the first annual Daniel Pearl Music
Day, created by the Daniel Pearl
Foundation.
"With Danny's birthday coming up,
we didn't want this to be a sad occasion,"
said Michelle Pearl, his younger sister.
"The goal of the concert is to promote
tolerance... to give people a sense of
global connectedness and to experience
the hope we all feel when we hear
music."
Rabbi Patricia Karlin-Neumann, who
participated in Daniel Pearl's memorial
service in February, organized the con
cert, which will feature the St. Lawrence
String Quartet and jazz pianist Mark Ap
plebaum, an assistant professor of com
position and theory at Stanford.
"1 responded to an inquiry from
Danny's father to organize a concert in
each of the places he lived," Karlin-Neu
mann said.
Noting that a sense of community is
valued at Stanford, she said, "Danny is
one of our own. This is a way to celebrate
his life."
Daniel Pearl, a Wall Street Journal re
porter who was kidnapped and slain by
terrorists early this year, was an accom
plished musician who performed wher
ever he went.
He began playing the piano at age
four, but switched to the violin at age
seven. He later picked up the electric vi
olin, along with the mandolin and fiddle.
"I think he wanted an instrument he
could travel with," Michelle Pearl said.
"1 Ie went everywhere with it. His man
dolin and violin cases were covered in
stickers from various places he went."
Daniel's mother, Ruth Pearl, echoed
the same sentiment.
"When we took him to the airport to
go to Stanford, he took his violin, but he
didn't have any sheets and towels," Ruih
Pearl said.
At Stanford, Daniel Pearl played in
the Stanford Symphony Orchestra and
had his own jazz show on KSZU,
Michelle Pearl said.
Daniel Pearl liked all kinds of music,
especially jazz, bluegrass and folk.

"He went through phases," Michelle
Pearl said. "He was a huge David Bowie
fan in college . . . but it changed all the
time ... I think he even liked country
western."
Working full-time as a journalist
didn't stop Daniel Pearl from playing in
bands wherever he lived or worked.
"He was very adaptable that way,"
Michelle Pearl said. "He would jump in
with people he didn't know and jam with
them."
He was also known to have composed
a few songs from time to time. Michelle
Pearl recalled one time when one of his
friends was pregnant and overdue, so he
wrote a song to coax the baby out. He ti
lled the song, "Come out, Come out, the
World is not Such a Bad Place."
Daniel Pearl and his friends talked
about taking a year off to become really
good musicians.
"Music was a high priority in life,"
Michelle Pearl said. "Mariane [his wife]
once asked him what his life dream was,

expecting him to say writing a book or
something like that, but he said he want
ed to have a hit song."
The idea for the Music Day sprung
not only from Daniel Pearl's love of
music, but also on the day his death was
announced, a French conductor in Is
rael decided to dedicate his show to
Daniel Pearl.
"Part of Music Day is to try and help
people realize how much in common we
really have with each other. Music is a
powerful experience, but music is also
peaceful," Michelle Pearl said.
The St. Lawrence String Quartet will
perform "Eli Eli," a Jewish lolk song
arranged by Jonathan Berger, a music
professor at Stanford, as well as Mozart's
"Quartet in E flat Major K. 428."
Mark Applebaum, who was asked by
the Quartet to perform, will play a ren
dition of "Over the Rainbow" and a jazz
ballad entitled "Andy," which he com-

posed fora friend who committed
suicide. He will also join the Quar
tet in a piece he wrote called
"Hymn."
"We remember fPearl] specifi
cally," Applebaum said. "But I
think we gather as a community in
a more universal way, to think
about all injustice and to lament
the passing of all lost friends."
Stanford will join with other
communities worldwide — from
Los Angeles to Hong Kong to Tel
Aviv — to celebrate music in
Daniel Pearl's honor.
"Artists throughout the world
are taking a united stand against
intolerance," Daniel Pearl's par
ents said in a written statement.
"We are inviting orchestras and
bands to use this opportunity to
play for humanity and friendship,
and to recognize the hope that is
still plentiful even in the aftermath
of terror."
