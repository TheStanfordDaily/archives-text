# Indie 'Heat' from Canada
## 
### VAUHINI VARA 
If you're an independent
band with the word "hot" in your
name, fame is kind of inevitable.
With so many opportunities for
cheap, cliched headlines, how
could the media resist? Bands
that come to mind: Sahara Hot
nights, the badasser-than-Avril
girl band from Sweden that rocks
even cooler than the Hives; and
the Hot Snakes, the San Diego
hipsters who rock even cooler
than the rock revival itself.
Now enter Hot Hot Heat: a
band that may soon find itself, if
my theory holds, in triple-deep
shit. Actually, it's already started.
Rumor has it that they're being
courted by several major labels;
in July, Spin magazine praised
their music as "the sound of punk
teaching itself to dance."
Of course, not everyone
agrees. When the band released
its first Sub Pop EP in April, a re
viewer for the website Pitchfork
media.com offered this semi-ac
curate description of lead singer
Steve Bays' vocals: "God help
him, this guy sang like he was
swallowing his tongue."
To put that in context: Pitch
fork gave a rating of 0.6 out of 10
to joke-rock genius Andrew W.K.
In this case, the reviewer is equal
ly off base. When Steve sings, he
sounds less like a helpless, gag
ging idiot, and more like that odd
answering-machine voice that
makes you think you've dialed
the wrong number ("Hell-oh,

Hot Hot Heat
Make Up the
Breakdown

you have reached six-five-oh
four-nine-sev-en ... ") Kind of
disconcerting, a little less-than
human — but in a way, so weird
that it's cool.
Therein lies the charm of this
sweet dance-punk band from
Victoria, British Golumbia. Six
months after releasing the afore
mentioned EP, Hot Hot Heat has
put together "Make Up the
Breakdown," a full-length album
recorded by Jack Endino of
"Bleach" fame. The breakdown is
as follows: The band members
look like typical Northwest rock
'n' roll kids, with bouffant-gel
hairdos, faux scowls and jeans
tighter than the whole Brazilian
Students Association's asses. But
if it were possible to construct a
Gorillaz-style persona for their
sound, it might come out more
like this: four T-1000 clones, who
are armed with staccato-spraying
machine-guns and programmed
to destroy all that is melodious in
music — but end up exposing
their inner Arnold-in-Termina
tor-2 before they can help it.
That is, Hot Hot Heat ap
proaches the sonic side of music
like it's a math problem: The gui
tar and bass usually just dance
along, terrifyingly hypnotized, to

the beat of metronome-even (but
somehow catchy) keyboards,
drums and vocals — though
many of the best songs, like "This
Town," are led by a rockingly
poppy, melodic guitar.
But at the same time, the lyrics
betray a sensitive heart, almost to
the point of being maudlin. In
"Save Us 5.0.5.," Steve waxes sen
timental about long, thankless
tours without his beloved: "No,
no, no, no, 110, I won't be coming
home / make sure she knows,
make sure she knows that 1 would
change it if I could." And an earli
er version of I "Get In or Get Out,"
then called "Victorian Style," was a
spare, fuzzily recorded lullaby
about the band's hometown and
Steve's cat. The song opened with
these lyrics: "Jean jacket's folded
011 my closet shelf/The weather
begs for leather coats, but health
represents the least of my con
cerns and I hope that it's cool."
It turns out that coolness is still
a prime concern for the relatively
young band. 111 "Breakdown,"
they have swapped the folky gui
tar and decidedly un-cool lyrics
with an org)' of loud, punchy
sound. As far as I can tell, in "Get
In or Get Out" Steve's cat now
plays a minor role in this version,
self-consciously replaced with
something about white lipstick
and a bathroom mirror. Wait —
is that really what he's singing
about? I think it is — but maybe
not. It's actually kind of hard to
tell: The guy who sings may have
a vital organ caught in his throat.
