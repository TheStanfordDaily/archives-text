# Rockers deliver their best Rollins impressions
## 
### KAREEM GHANEM 
In 1994, three teenagers were convicted
of the horrific rape and murder of three
young boys in VVest Memphis, Arkansas.
Two were subsequently sentenced to life in
prison and the third is set to receive a lethal
injection. What is remarkable is that in the
years since, many have thrown their support
behind the West Memphis Three, as the
young men have come to be known. After
all, you didn't see people rush to the defense
of Richard Allen Davis, Polly Klass' murder
er.
Serious charges of police coercion, judi
cial malfeasance and investigative sloppiness
have convinced many that the West Mem
phis Three were wrongly convicted. Former
Black Flag frontman and current solo musi
cian Henry Rollins is one of those people,
and "Rise Above" is his attempt to offer some
help in publicizing the case and assisting
with the legal defense fund. Overseen by
grand maestro Rollins, the album contains
covers of classic Black Flag tracks by musi
cians as diverse as Chuck D, Ryan Adams
and Motorhead's Lemmy.
The case against the West Memphis
Three has become as divisive as the Mumia
Abu-Jamal and Leonard Peltier trials. As a

result, it has become difficult, if not outright
impossible, for outside observers to develop
a sense for the complexities inherent in each
of these extremely controversial cases. In a
recent turn of events, MTV asked hip-hop
pioneers Public Enemy to change lyrics sup
porting Mumia Abu-Jamal in a new song
whose video was slated to appear on the net
work, presumably in a move to avoid con
troversy. (After all, they wouldn't want to
leave anyone with the impression that their
precious cable network actually challenges
conventions or promotes debate.)
That said, I'm going to do something ar
guably as sleazy as MTV here and avoid
commenting on the case. Why? Mainly be
cause I am one of the many who falls in the
confusing No Man's Land of public opinion.
I certainly care, but find myself unable to
make true sense of the deeply polarized de
bate on the West Memphis Three, or Mumia
or Leonard Peltier for that matter.
Instead, I will do what music writers do
best — offer my own deeply biased views on

the music itself I assure you that this will be
better for everyone involved.
Several of Black Flag's best seminal hard
core songs are represented on this album:
"Rise Above," "Nervous Breakdown," "De
pression," "T.V. Party," "Police Story" and
"Six Pack," to name a few. Each track fea
tures vocals by different musicians, backed
by members of big Hank's own Rollins
Band. Because the same band is featured on
each track (with a few exceptions), the songs
are all pretty coherent. This is what the orig
inal Black Flag would sound like if their re
leases in the '80s didn't feel as if they were
recorded in a gigantic tin can — universally
bruising, intelligent and sometimes funny.
On the other hand, the constant presence
of the same handful of musicians detracts
from a sense of diversity that might have
helped an album like this. With the excep
tion of Exene Cervenka (formerly of X),
Ryan Adams and Lemmy, the singers all
sound as if they're practicing their best
Henry Rollins impressions. Adams lends a
slackerish charm to the normally frantic
"Nervous Breakdown," and Lemmy is an ut
terly convincing alcoholic in "Thirsty & Mis
erable." Many of the other performances are
disappointing though..
Chuck D's presence is completely wasted

on the title track, "Rise Above," as he utters
just a few words at the beginning. Similarly,
Ice T, appearing on "Police Story" (relish the
irony, kids), is totally underutilized; it would
have been nice if his song were longer than
90 seconds. Sure, this is Black Flag we're
talking about. However, these tracks stick
painfully close to a script of what the band's
songs "should" sound like, thus undermin
ing their potential power.
Iggy Pop's contribution on "Fix Me" is
so boring, for example, that I could scarce
ly believe it was actually Iggy. The same
goes for Rancid's Tim Armstrong and Lars
Frederiksen on "No More." "Rise Above"
ultimately suffers because it doesn't ade
quately incorporate the unique talents of
its contributors.
Of course, one should not forget that at its
foundation, this is a benefit record. "Rise
Above" is certain to earn some measure of
publicity for the plight of the West Memphis
Three, and in that respect it may be faithful
to Black Flag's legacy. Depending on how
you interpret the merits of the case though,
this may be a cruel irony — Black Flag car
ried the torch of punk rock righteousness
through an often-dark period of rock his
tory, and after all these years has still hard
ly garnered the attention it deserves.
