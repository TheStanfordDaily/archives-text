# Annoying, pretentious, pretty good
## 
### KARAN MAHAJAN 
There's only one axiom in alter
native rock as a genre: If you're
tired of it, then listen to more of it.
There are salves for your Wilco-in
duced depression and your Radio
head-sponsored boredom.
There is J ucifer.
Okay, so you pick up this CD,
and it says"I Name You Destroyer"
with the sparkling subtitle "is a mes
sage of love," and you're thinking
"well, shit," this is going to be an
other annoying, pretentious band
with druggy lyrics. Yeah, so it is. But
you'll be hard pressed to find a band
that sounds anything remotely like
Jucifer, and that in itself is com
pelling reason fora good review.
To back up that rather pompous
assertion, I'd like you to consider
the absurdity of the following spec
tacle: Ozzy Osbourne is professing
his love for Trent Reznor on his
knees in a church, and Shirley Man
son's the best man, and all hell is
breaking loose ,and Michael Stipe is
throwing an agnostic fit, and the
guy who invented the synth is crack
ing grin after grin like weak wal
nuts, and flie White Stripes' Meg
White is asking "are they brother
and sister?" and there's a bunch of
Goths whistling.
And put THAT to music.
If it's hard to imagine, then it'll
be hard to digest and it'll be re
warding (so goes the conventional
logic). Basically, Jucifer is a noise
metal-rock duo with stark, driving
beats and a female lead-singer with

Jucifer
I Name You
Destroyer

a thin, inexpressive voice that
makes everything paranoid, but
paradoxically, personal. The ab
sence of a bass (yes, yes, very White
Stripe-ish) is atoned for by synthe
sizers.
The album (the duo's second)
kicks off with "Little Fever" —
Amber Valentine's voice is soni
cally flattered by slowly pumped
surges of static, and the whole
song seems like its heading fora
sarcastic chorus. But it isn't. In
stead, a desperate siren-synth
tune is coiled up in the back
ground, and when its urgency is
pitted against the unhurried
metal hooks of the guitar, you're
in a speeding car, and everything
is spinning out of control because
a cold maniac is behind the wheel.
And yet you're not moving. Fans
of Nine Inch Nail's last offering —
"The Fragile" — will approve.
Things then get progressively
heavier and rougher until "When
She Goes Out," which is a relief,
since I didn't care much for the
"noise songs" on this album —
which would be cool in a live show or
to drive your roommate crazy —
but then again, I'm not a metal man
myself.
So, yeah — "When She Goes
Out" has a funky synth line that'll
have you dancing (ironically, of

course) and a whinnying guitar that
just bounces on — boy, you've got to
love a band that can deliver such a
fun song with such pessimism.
One of the best tracks in the
album is "Lazing," which sheds the
distortion fora creepy guitar tone
and wonderful lyrics — "sidewalk
white feel my feet soak." This is a
distinctly slow-core moment.
"Surface Tension" and "Sea
Blind" ("she takes her lovers with
flawless passion"), meanwhile, are
equally surprising, but they can't
hide the godawful wedged-in-be
tween "instrumental" song "un
dertow" (quite possibly the worst
piece of shit on any album in a long
time.) They can't hide it. But that's
not the point anyway.
The point, under all the abra
siveness, is to rawk and to rejuve
nate your faith in alternative
music. The point is to be greater
than the sum of one's parts. And if
you expect a masterpiece or sin
cere polish, then quit after song
two. If you're squeamish, the sub
versive industrial meets techno
sound can get annoying, but this is
what 1 suggest- HANG ON. Hang
on, because the last four songs,
"Firefly," the aforementioned
"Lazing," et all — following the
metal-paranoia of the first six
tracks — seem to be J uciter's way
of saying "underneath it all, we're
just a good ol' alternative outfit, so
don't be afraid." Don't believe
them. Listen to them.
And oh, be afraid, be very
afraid.




'The sunlight burrrrrrns."

The point, under all the abra
siveness, is to rawk and to rejuve
nate your faith in alternative
music. The point is to be greater
than the sum of one's parts. And if
you expect a masterpiece or sin
cere polish, then quit after song
two. If you're squeamish, the sub
versive industrial meets techno
sound can get annoying, but this is
what 1 suggest- HANG ON. Hang
on, because the last four songs,
"Firefly," the aforementioned
"Lazing," et all — following the
metal-paranoia of the first six
tracks — seem to be J uciter's way
of saying "underneath it all, we're
just a good ol' alternative outfit, so
don't be afraid." Don't believe
them. Listen to them.
And oh, be afraid, be very
afraid.




'The sunlight burrrrrrns."
There's only one axiom in alter
native rock as a genre: If you're
tired of it, then listen to more of it.
There are salves for your Wilco-in
duced depression and your Radio
head-sponsored boredom.
There is J ucifer.
Okay, so you pick up this CD,
and it says"I Name You Destroyer"
with the sparkling subtitle "is a mes
sage of love," and you're thinking
"well, shit," this is going to be an
other annoying, pretentious band
with druggy lyrics. Yeah, so it is. But
you'll be hard pressed to find a band
that sounds anything remotely like
Jucifer, and that in itself is com
pelling reason fora good review.
To back up that rather pompous
assertion, I'd like you to consider
the absurdity of the following spec
tacle: Ozzy Osbourne is professing
his love for Trent Reznor on his
knees in a church, and Shirley Man
son's the best man, and all hell is
breaking loose ,and Michael Stipe is
throwing an agnostic fit, and the
guy who invented the synth is crack
ing grin after grin like weak wal
nuts, and flie White Stripes' Meg
White is asking "are they brother
and sister?" and there's a bunch of
Goths whistling.
And put THAT to music.
If it's hard to imagine, then it'll
be hard to digest and it'll be re
warding (so goes the conventional
logic). Basically, Jucifer is a noise
metal-rock duo with stark, driving
beats and a female lead-singer with

Jucifer
I Name You
Destroyer

a thin, inexpressive voice that
makes everything paranoid, but
paradoxically, personal. The ab
sence of a bass (yes, yes, very White
Stripe-ish) is atoned for by synthe
sizers.
The album (the duo's second)
kicks off with "Little Fever" —
Amber Valentine's voice is soni
cally flattered by slowly pumped
surges of static, and the whole
song seems like its heading fora
sarcastic chorus. But it isn't. In
stead, a desperate siren-synth
tune is coiled up in the back
ground, and when its urgency is
pitted against the unhurried
metal hooks of the guitar, you're
in a speeding car, and everything
is spinning out of control because
a cold maniac is behind the wheel.
And yet you're not moving. Fans
of Nine Inch Nail's last offering —
"The Fragile" — will approve.
Things then get progressively
heavier and rougher until "When
She Goes Out," which is a relief,
since I didn't care much for the
"noise songs" on this album —
which would be cool in a live show or
to drive your roommate crazy —
but then again, I'm not a metal man
myself.
So, yeah — "When She Goes
Out" has a funky synth line that'll
have you dancing (ironically, of

course) and a whinnying guitar that
just bounces on — boy, you've got to
love a band that can deliver such a
fun song with such pessimism.
One of the best tracks in the
album is "Lazing," which sheds the
distortion fora creepy guitar tone
and wonderful lyrics — "sidewalk
white feel my feet soak." This is a
distinctly slow-core moment.
"Surface Tension" and "Sea
Blind" ("she takes her lovers with
flawless passion"), meanwhile, are
equally surprising, but they can't
hide the godawful wedged-in-be
tween "instrumental" song "un
dertow" (quite possibly the worst
piece of shit on any album in a long
time.) They can't hide it. But that's
not the point anyway.
The point, under all the abra
siveness, is to rawk and to rejuve
nate your faith in alternative
music. The point is to be greater
than the sum of one's parts. And if
you expect a masterpiece or sin
cere polish, then quit after song
two. If you're squeamish, the sub
versive industrial meets techno
