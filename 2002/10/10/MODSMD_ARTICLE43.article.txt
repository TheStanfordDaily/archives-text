# Adams' latest inconsistent but savory
## 
### BENJAMIN L. FRIEDLAND 
It's no secret that alt-country's Ryan Adams is
prolific. In fact, all that rivals his continual outpouring of
music is the steady stream of press about his outpouring.
Adams' pleasing new album "Demolition" stands
as the perfect example of his non-stop creativity. Acollec-

tion of demos — "De
molition" being one —
and in-between songs,
the album features a
host of catchy folk-rock,
equally beautiful and

angry, that far surpasses the fans-only release it could eas
ily have been.
Since 1996, Adams has released seven albums,
four with his former band, the alt-country rebels
Whiskeytown, and three more on his own after their
demise. On top of that, he has recorded songs for sound
tracks and compilations, sat in with his friends — includ
ing Beth Orton and the Counting Crows — toured ex
tensively, and even cut a Gap ad. "Demolition" draws
from those sessions with Orton and the Crows — though
neither appears on the record — and from studio-time
with his punk-rock side-project, the Pinkhearts.
Despite the haphazard recording, Demolition is
vintage Adams: warm, abandon-less country songs,
mostly about love, varying between acoustic beauty and
electric heartbreak. These thirteen songs
lean more towards his solo debut "Heatbreaker" than last
year's popular "Gold." But like Adams' entire catalogue,
the strength here is his songwriting and song crafting, his
ability to turn a seemingly forgettable folk song into a ten
der, harmony-driven ballad.
Even so, "Demolition" falls short of album-of
the-year. The scattered recording process makes fora
discontinuous, uneven compilation, most evident in

Adams' singing. Despite constantly performing and per
sistent critical acclaim, Adams still struggles

to sing consistently. Instead his voice
ranges from delicate to throaty to J

confident to nasal, a gamut that ren
ders the final product artificial and

contrived.
