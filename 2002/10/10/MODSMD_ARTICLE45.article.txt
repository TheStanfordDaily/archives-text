# TMBG light Birdhouses in your soul
## 
### TRACEY NYBERG 
This is the third in a series of articles
called 'The Record Bin" exploring clas
sic albums from the past.
From the opening song, a short
hymn, you realize that this isn't
your average rock album. John
Flanssburgh and John Linnell, the
two constants in the ensemble
group They Might Be Giants
(TMBG), let their unusual brand of
humor fuel their 1990 album
"Flood." The third album in a ca
reer that now spans 20 years, the
album and subsequent tour put
TMBG on the map, particularly
since only TM BG could siug a song
about Constantinople changing its
name to Istanbul and not have it
sound like a School House Rock re
ject. This group has a serious cult
following, although recently they
have entered mainstream culture
by recording "Boss of Me," the
Grammy-winning ther.ie song to
"Malcolm in the Middle." Their
music styles sample from all over,
and nowhere is this more apparent
than on "Flood," their best-selling
album. The singles "Birdhouse in
Your Soul" and "Istanbul (Not
Constantinople)" received airplay
on MTV and national radio, but
the rest of the album is equally wor
thy of note.
The infectious melodies and
satirical lyrics stick like crazy glue in
your mind, and while some of them
are irreverent and / or nonsensical,
they occasionally focus on serious
issues. "Your Racist Friend" is a
look at how the people you associ
ate with reflect on your values, and
TMBG takes a strong stand against
racism. Yet somehow TMBG can
follow up this heavy-handed theme
with "Particle Man," a song with a
very simple, repeating melody

about different 'men' — Particle
man, Triangle man, Person man,
and Universe man, and which one
would win in a fight (Triangle man
conies out the champion). They
also have a short instrumental in
terlude, "Minimum Wage," which
opens with someone yelling 'Mini
mum wage, yeehaw!' followed by
the crack of a whip, all over the
opening chords of a 42-second,
synthesizer-created song. While it
sounds like it should have stayed in
the '80s, it is still a great song that
you catch yourself humming dur
ing a quiet moment.
The strange themes of each
song and juxtaposition of different
images is what makes this album re
ally stick out. The thought of being
reincarnated as a bag of groceries
(do they have feelings?) or the bird
house in your soul (what birds
would live there?) are laughable,
but the classic "Whistling in the
Dark" is by far the most bizarre.
Who whistles in the dark, and what
is the meaning? These are not deep
philosophical questions, but they
do create a great set of songs that
pass the ultimate test of great al
bums: the more you play "Flood,"
the better it gets.
"Flood" is the last album Linnell
and Flanssburgh toured with as a
duo; after the release of "Apollo
18," they added a guitarist and
drummer to their regular touring
ensemble. Over the years the back
up personnel have changed, but
Linnell and Flanssburgh still fuel
the manic energy and improvisa
tional mayhem that characterize
TMBG's live shows. If you are a
long-time TMBG fan or just dis
covering their sound, be sure to
catch their live performance with
author David Fggers on April 27 at
our very own Memorial Auditori
um as part of Stanford Lively Arts!
