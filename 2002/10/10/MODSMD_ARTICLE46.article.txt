# Roxy Sass wants you to take a dip in the melting pot
## 
### 
It's time to do a short little word
association exercise to start this
week's column off right. Get out
your pens and papers, darlings.
Asian girls? Latino men? Indian
women? Black men?
All done? Good. And now,
just for your information, the
correct associations for each of
these are: pure, spicy, exotic and
hung, respectively. Don't be sur
prised! You should've seen each
of these coming.
Have I offended you yet? Re
gardless of the answer, we all need
to understand the reality of racial
ly-based sexual stereotypes. Every
night on this campus, lonely indi
viduals shiver with delight as they
fantasize about pounding the in
nocence out of some sweetly
naive, hairless, Asian pussy. And
each day, many of you daydream
about what you would do if con
fronted with the task of handling
a black man's thick, dark cock —
wet with your saliva, it would be
too big to hold in both hands and
certainly too big to take in your
mouth all at once!
In other words, you'd be silly to
believe that racial, ethnic and cul
tural dynamics don't have a pow
erful effect on the way we interact
sexually. This week, Roxy has put
herself to the ultimate task. Yes,
precious students, Roxy is here to
teach you about a very real phe

nomenon both here at Stanford
and beyond: the ethnic fetish.
Simply put, interracial cou
plings are something of a taboo in
most parts of the world. Even here
in wonderfully progressive North
ern California, interracial couples
catch looks from passerby in public
ranging from inquisitive ("Huh?")
to hostile ("What does that bitch
think she's doing with that man?")
Here at Stanford, where so
many people of different back
grounds come together to form a
somewhat artificially diverse com
munity, this peculiar dynamic is a
piece of baggage that we inevitably
bring to sexual interactions, from
innocent public flirting to less-in
nocent intimate exchanges. Either
out of politeness, political correct
ness or just plain shame, we shud
der at the thought of openly dis
cussing the various racial preju
dices and the way they inform sex
ual interaction between races. The
resulting repression fosters a
breeding ground for illicit sexual
fetishes based in the concept of
racial taboos.
Several such fetishes are com
mon on campus; the obsession
among some with Asian women
and black men are but two exam
ples. Others are articulated less
often — For example, the refined
taste for white meat among the
third world international set. Or,

the oft-stated predilection among
many ladies for Jewish men. Boys,
this is what your grandmother
warned you about when you left
the shtetl for Stanford.
These sorts of fetishes aren't al
ways explicitly malevolent. In only
a minority of cases is a racial fetish
the result of explicit racism. Re
gardless, however, all are dehu
manizing. Racial fetishes reduce
entire groups of people to a sort of
animalistic status. Left unchecked,
they allow us to reinforce subtle
racist undertones - of the sexless
Asian man or the fiery Latina, for
example. While fantasies about in
terracial sex will always make many
of us hot under the collar, we
should also be more self-critical
role and assess what these sorts of
unspoken desires say about us.
In the meantime, heed the
words of old teacher Roxy, my
pretty things. Asian girls beware!
Those apple-cheeked Midwestern
boys don't hang on your every
word just because they like the way
you deconstruct the communal
riot narrative. And you Middle
Eastern honeys, have no fear. That
whole war on terrorism thing will
never change the way I feel.
