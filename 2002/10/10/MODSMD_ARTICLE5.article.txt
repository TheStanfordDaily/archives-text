economy, budget cuts for the 2003-
2004 year may more severe than
expected, with the University fac
ing the possibility of reductions as
steep as 8 percent.
Provost John Etchemendy, the
chief budgetary officer for Stan
ford, discussed why his office antic
ipates these reductions.
"The reason behind it is largely
the investment situation and what
is happening on the markets,"
Etchemendy said. That has lots of
different affects on the budget.
"It affects everything from the
effect on the size of the endowment,
to the payout from the endowment,
to the payout from the expendable
funds pools, to money sitting in the
bank that is not in the endowment,
to the income ... we can use in the
general funds budget."
Etchemendy noted that Stan
ford alumni are also affected by the

economic downturn.
"It also has an effect on gifts,"
Etchemendy said. "When donors
leel an economic pinch, they feel
less able to donate to their alma
mater. All of these factors put to

going to grow substantially less
than our expenses."
