# Budget cuts may be worse than expected
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
In large part due to the bleak
economy, budget cuts for the 2003-
2004 year may more severe than
expected, with the University fac
ing the possibility of reductions as
steep as 8 percent.
Provost John Etchemendy, the
chief budgetary officer for Stan
ford, discussed why his office antic
ipates these reductions.
"The reason behind it is largely
the investment situation and what
is happening on the markets,"
Etchemendy said. That has lots of
different affects on the budget.
"It affects everything from the
effect on the size of the endowment,
to the payout from the endowment,
to the payout from the expendable
funds pools, to money sitting in the
bank that is not in the endowment,
to the income ... we can use in the
general funds budget."
Etchemendy noted that Stan
ford alumni are also affected by the

economic downturn.
"It also has an effect on gifts,"
Etchemendy said. "When donors
leel an economic pinch, they feel
less able to donate to their alma
mater. All of these factors put to
gether mean that our income is
going to grow substantially less
than our expenses."
Last year the University t(x>k ac
tion and cut the overall budget for

2002-2003 by 5 pert cut, according
to Etchemendy. At thai lime, a<l
ministration oflicials had expected
a smaller budget cut for 2003-2004
that would complement the larger
reduction the previous year.
"We knew we would have to take
more cuts the following year. What
we didn't know was how serious the
cuts would have to be,"
Etchemendy said.
"We are currently in fiscal year
'03,"he continued. "We are now
budgeting tor the following year,
fiscal year '04, which will start next
September. When wedid the 5 per
cent cuts on fiscal year '03, we
thought we would have to make an
additional 3 percent budget cut for
fiscal year '04."
I lowever, the ec< >n< >mic sit i lat i< >i i
changed drastically after the unfore
seen fall in the financial markets that
followed the Sept. 11 attacks.
" That was of course, before the
disastrous market situation,"
Etchemendy said. "So now it turns
out that the budget cut is going to
be significantly larger than the 3
percent we anticipated. We will
have to cut the budget somewhere
in the vicinity of <S percent, or it
could be more."
Many department heads and
deans declined to comment when
contacted about the proposed bud
get reductions, citing the tentative
nature of the cuts as of now.
Marc Wais, Dean of Students,
explained that the overall budget
cuts that the Provost's office is plan
ning to carry out next year have not
been formally announced yet.
"We have not received any offi
cial notification from the Provost
regarding possible budget cuts,"
Wais said.
Wais did say that he understood
why such cuts might have to take
place. He also noted that, despite a
lack of formal notification, most Uni
versity community members should
be expecting such cuts with the cur

rent national economic situation.
"It is important to recognize that
Stanford is not immune to die cur
rent dismal economic climate,"
Wais said. "Within this context, no
one should be surprised about the
prospect of having to address bud
get cuts."
Etchemendy stressed that his of
fice will do its best to ensure that the
budget cuts do not undermine the
goals of the University. Depart
ments and offices will offer new bud
get proposals from which the final
allocation decisions will be made.
"What we will do is ask them to
present different scenarios of cuts,
and then in the end, we will come
up with an apportionment of the
cuts so that we can balance the bud
get," Etchemendy said. " I lie c uts
will not necessarily be across the
board. We do our best to protect
the academic mission of the Uni
versity, but this does not mean all
the cuts are given to the non-acade
mic part of the University, because
these help the academic aspect too.
"Our mission is the academic
mission — teaching and research.
We will do the cuts in such a way
that we protect as much as possible.
But that means that we have to pro
tect lots of different parts of the
University."
While it is a large budget cut, he
added that such a reduction is by no
means unprecedented.
"The University has had to
make cuts at various points many
times before," Etchemendy said.
"There was one period at the be
ginning of the nineties where we
had some very severe cuts. One of
the things that happened was a big
cut in the indirect cost rate.
"Another thing that happened
was the earthquake in 1989. A third
thing that happened was that the
University froze tuition .... It all
added up to a very devastating situ
ation. They were facing 20 percent
cuts, and we are not in that situa
tion, thank goodness."
Even though the University has
seen worse, Etchemendy admitted
that accommodating the upcoming
cuts would not be easy.

added up to a very devastating situ
ation. They were facing 20 percent
cuts, and we are not in that situa
tion, thank goodness."
Even though the University has
seen worse, Etchemendy admitted
that accommodating the upcoming
cuts would not be easy.
In large part due to the bleak
economy, budget cuts for the 2003-
2004 year may more severe than
expected, with the University fac
ing the possibility of reductions as
steep as 8 percent.
Provost John Etchemendy, the
chief budgetary officer for Stan
ford, discussed why his office antic
ipates these reductions.
"The reason behind it is largely
the investment situation and what
is happening on the markets,"
Etchemendy said. That has lots of
different affects on the budget.
"It affects everything from the
effect on the size of the endowment,
to the payout from the endowment,
to the payout from the expendable
funds pools, to money sitting in the
bank that is not in the endowment,
to the income ... we can use in the
general funds budget."
Etchemendy noted that Stan
ford alumni are also affected by the

economic downturn.
"It also has an effect on gifts,"
Etchemendy said. "When donors
leel an economic pinch, they feel
less able to donate to their alma
mater. All of these factors put to
gether mean that our income is
going to grow substantially less
than our expenses."
Last year the University t(x>k ac

2002-2003 by 5 pert cut, according
to Etchemendy. At thai lime, a<l
ministration oflicials had expected
a smaller budget cut for 2003-2004
that would complement the larger
reduction the previous year.
"We knew we would have to take
more cuts the following year. What
we didn't know was how serious the
cuts would have to be,"
Etchemendy said.
"We are currently in fiscal year
'03,"he continued. "We are now
budgeting tor the following year,
fiscal year '04, which will start next
September. When wedid the 5 per
cent cuts on fiscal year '03, we
thought we would have to make an
additional 3 percent budget cut for
fiscal year '04."

changed drastically after the unfore
seen fall in the financial markets that
followed the Sept. 11 attacks.
" That was of course, before the
disastrous market situation,"
Etchemendy said. "So now it turns
out that the budget cut is going to
be significantly larger than the 3
percent we anticipated. We will
have to cut the budget somewhere
in the vicinity of <S percent, or it
could be more."
Many department heads and
deans declined to comment when
contacted about the proposed bud
get reductions, citing the tentative
nature of the cuts as of now.
Marc Wais, Dean of Students,
explained that the overall budget
cuts that the Provost's office is plan
ning to carry out next year have not
been formally announced yet.
"We have not received any offi
cial notification from the Provost
regarding possible budget cuts,"
Wais said.
Wais did say that he understood
why such cuts might have to take
place. He also noted that, despite a
lack of formal notification, most Uni
versity community members should
be expecting such cuts with the cur

rent national economic situation.
"It is important to recognize that
Stanford is not immune to die cur
rent dismal economic climate,"
Wais said. "Within this context, no
one should be surprised about the
prospect of having to address bud
get cuts."
Etchemendy stressed that his of
fice will do its best to ensure that the
budget cuts do not undermine the
goals of the University. Depart
ments and offices will offer new bud
get proposals from which the final
allocation decisions will be made.
"What we will do is ask them to
present different scenarios of cuts,
and then in the end, we will come
up with an apportionment of the
cuts so that we can balance the bud
get," Etchemendy said. " I lie c uts
will not necessarily be across the
board. We do our best to protect
the academic mission of the Uni
versity, but this does not mean all
the cuts are given to the non-acade
mic part of the University, because
these help the academic aspect too.
"Our mission is the academic
mission — teaching and research.
We will do the cuts in such a way
that we protect as much as possible.
But that means that we have to pro
tect lots of different parts of the
University."
While it is a large budget cut, he
added that such a reduction is by no
means unprecedented.
"The University has had to
make cuts at various points many
times before," Etchemendy said.
"There was one period at the be
ginning of the nineties where we
had some very severe cuts. One of
the things that happened was a big
cut in the indirect cost rate.
"Another thing that happened
was the earthquake in 1989. A third
thing that happened was that the
University froze tuition .... It all
added up to a very devastating situ
ation. They were facing 20 percent
cuts, and we are not in that situa
tion, thank goodness."
