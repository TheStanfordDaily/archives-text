# Rocky economy lowers endowment returns
## Hennessy emphasizes importance of building endowment 
### WINSTON LIN 
While some students on cam
pus may know that Stanford lias
the fourth largest endowment
among national universities, few
understand the relationship be
tween the endowment and Uni
versity finances. The endowment
plays an important role in the
yearly budget and has a notice
able impact on the way that the
University operates.
In an issue of the Stanford
Magazine, University President
John Hennessy wrote, 'Endow
ment earnings help us Fulfill our
mission of teaching and research
[but] ... it does not come close to

meeting our financial needs."
1 le explained the funds' insuf
ficiency in two ways. First, the en
dowment is protected by law so
that the principal cannot be
touched. Second, the trustees
must balance the needs of the cur
rent year with the consideration
of the needs of the future. Addi
tionally, the endowment is not a
static amount.
Stanford created the Stanford
Management Company in 1991
to handle the University's finan
cial affairs. Most of the approxi
mately $8.2 billion (as of Aug. 31,
2001) in the endowment is invest
ed in a portfolio, called the
Merged Endowment Pool, which
is purposely diversified.
Since the U.S. economy has
been in rocky straits recently, per
formance of the endowment has
ebbed as well. According to the
Stanford Management Company,

the return was-7.2 percent for the
fiscal year that ended Aug. 31,
2001.
As stated in the Stanford Uni
versity 2002-2003 budget plan,
the projected amount of the bud
get coming from investment re
turn is $489.7 million or about
21.4 percent of total revenue. The
payout rate approved by the
Board of Trustees is about 5.13
percent of the total value of the
endowment.
Hennessy explained, "The en
dowment payout policy is set out
by the trustees. The income from
the endowment flows either into
restricted funds when the gift was
restricted, or into the university's
main operating budget."
Money from the endowment
is used for many University en
deavors, including financial aid
for undergraduate and gradu
ate students. Also, the budgets

of the academic and athletic de
partments are based in part on
the performance of the endow
ment.
Yet according to the Stanford
endowment Web site, "The en
dowment income covered just
18.1 percent of Stanford's operat
ing expenses" in fiscal year 2001.
Therefore, "one of Stanford's pri
mary goals is to increase the pro
portion of operating budget
funded by endowment income,
thus providing a permanent
source of funding for programs
such as Stanford Introductory
Studies and financial aid."
Hennessy also stressed the im
portance of the University endow
ment in the Stanford Magazine.
"Building the endowment ac
knowledges our continued belief
in Stanford and our ongoing com
mitment to those who will one day
be Stanford alumni," he said.
