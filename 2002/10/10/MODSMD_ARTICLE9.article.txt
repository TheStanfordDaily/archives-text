## Man shot dead in D.C. area 
### 
BALTIMORE (AP) â€” A man was slioi dead while
pumping gas in Virginia lasi night, and police were
trying to determine whether he was the latest vic tim of
the sniper who has terrorized the Washington area for
a week. Meanwhile, a tarot card with the words "Dear
policeman, I am God" emerged as a potential clue.
Virginia State Police said two males were seen dri
ving away in a white vehicle alter the shooting at the
station in Prince William County, near Manassas, 25
miles west of the nation's capital.
Prince William County police spokeswoman Sgt.
Kim Chinn said one man was killed. Chinn said she
had lew details to release. She said police did not
know where the shots came from, or how many shots
were fired.
Police had blocked off several streets around the
gas station, and they were interviewing people at
the scene.
"We are still very preliminarily beginning this in
vestigation," Chinn said. "We have been in contact
with the officials from Maryland and the task force
there, so we are sharing any information we have."
The tarot card was found near a shell casing out
side a middle school in Bowie, where a 13-year-old
boy was critically wounded by a gunman Monday, a
source familiar with the investigation said on condi
tion of anonymity.
Authorities said the shell was .223-caliber, the same
kind of bullet used to kill six people and wound an
other in Washington and its Maryland and Virginia
suburbs in the last week. The casing is believed to be
the first one recovered since the slayings began.
Michael Bouchard, an agent with the Bureau of Alco
hol, Tobacco and Firearms, would not say whether
authorities had linked the casing to the attacks.
Montgomery County Police Chief Charles Moose
also wouldn't comment when asked about the tarot
card, and angrily suggested unapproved information
had been leaked.
"I need to make sure 1 don't do anything to hinder
our ability to bring this person or these people into

custody," Moose said.
The message left on the tarot card called the Death
card was first reported by WUSA-TV. Police sources
said tlie items were found 150 yards from the school
in a wooded area on matted grass, suggesting the
gunman had lain in wait.

This is an example of a Death card from a tarot deck. A
Death card was apparently left behind at a Maryland
crime scene by Washington's suburban sniper and could
be an important clue in capturing the killer who is terror
izing the nation's capital.
