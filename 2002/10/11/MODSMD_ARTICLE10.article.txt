# Haugen addresses problems of power
## Former UN officer suggests that the United States may be using its power in the wrong ways 
### KRISTIN MORITZ 
As part of Cornerstone College Ministries'
Veritas speaker series, Gary Haugen, former
director of the United Nations genocide inves
tigation in Rwanda and current president of
the International Justice Mission, addressed a
crowd of roughly 200 last night in Kresge Au
ditorium in a talk entitled "The Moral Exertion
of Power: Can America Be Trusted?"
Haugen spoke of the problems of power in
America and throughout the world. As he dis
cussed moral and ethical tragedies, including
the mass execution of Rwandans in 1994 and
the forced prostitution of nearly one million
children in Thailand and India each year, Hau
gen suggested that Americans often neglect to
extend compassion to people who need help
worlds away.
"Americans have so much power, which pre
sents so many challenges," Haugen said. "We as
Americans spend more money on golf balls
each year than what constitutes the entire na
tional budget of Cambodia.
" There has never been a nation-state as
dominant as the United States in the history of
mankind. We have these horrendous injustices
taking place on our own watch, yet we have
failed to extend concern beyond our borders."
According to Haugen, much of America's
oversight of international atrocities stems from
the absence of transcultural and transnational
moral absolutes. He said that the lack of inter
national moral clarity, coupled with the lack of
courageous sacrificial action directed toward
people far away, makes it easy for Americans to
overlook these distant problems.
"God makes no distinction between the dif
ferent people around the world," Haugen said.
"There is a dire need to form a standard of moral
absolutes because, as Americans and as Chris
tians, we often speak of them with great rectitude
but live them with only minimal compliance."
In addition to his positions with the United

Nations and the International Justice Mission,
Haugen worked in the Civil Rights division of
the U.S. Department of Justice. While serving
on the executive committee of the National
Initiative for Reconciliation in South Africa,
Haugen collaborated with then-Bishop
Desmond Tutu.
Haugen's book, published in 1999 and enti
tled "Good News about Injustice," offers ac
counts of child prostitution, racial violence, re
ligious persecution, torture and genocide.
Haugen received his bachelor's degree from
Harvard University and his law degree from
the University of Chicago.
This year, Haugen was the first of a series of
Veritas speakers presented by Cornerstone.
The group plans to invite a speaker each quar
ter to address issues relating Jesus Christ to the
Stanford community.
"Our former director of University ministry
had a long-standing interest injustice and its re

lation to (he church," said Josh Ralston, assis
tant director of university ministry at Menlo
Park Presbyterian Church. "He heard Mr.
Haugen speak at UC-Berkeley and thought
that his ideas were very pertinent to the audi
ence. Cornerstone wanted him to speak here
because his perception of injustice is germane
to the political and social climate at Stanford."
The Veritas Forum originated at Harvard in
1992. During the first forum, 1,000 people
gathered for one weekend to attend film
screenings, lectures and workshops.
The writers of the book "Finding God at Har
vard" called the forum an "interdisciplinary ex
ploration of truth in relation to Jesus Christ."
Word of the Veritas Forum quickly spread,
and over 70 universities played host to their
own gatherings as participants sought to an
swer questions about the meaning of Christian
ity in their lives. Stanford hosted its first Veritas
Forum in 1995.
