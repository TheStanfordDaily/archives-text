PG&E to offer reduced gas and electricity prices
This Saturday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. in East Palo Alto, PG&E will
be offering people of low or fixed incomes 20 percent discounts on
their gas and electricity bills through the California Alternate Rate for
Energy program.
Many students would qualify for these reduced rates, because they
have fixed incomes. According to Stephanie Wilson of Young Commu
nications, PG&E cited that as many as 17,000 households in San Mateo
County are eligible for this discount.
The event on Saturday will include gospel music, giveaways, raffle
prizes including an energy-efficient refrigerator and clowns for kids.
Those interested "need to bring a PG&E bill, but do not need to bring
verification of their incomes," Wilson said.
The event will be held at the Community Church of East Palo Alto on
2201 University Ave., which is located across from City Hall.
Jazz concert series will start cranking tunes
This Sunday at 7:30 p.m. in the Campbell Recital Hall, the Stanford
Jazz Workshop will present a concert by the David Friesen Trio. Sun
day's concert marks the start of the Second Sunday Jazz Series.
"The improvisation of a jazz trio, with its spontaneous interactions
and internal musical conversations, can provide one of the highest forms
of contemporary music," said Jim Nadel, the executive director of the
Stanford Jazz Workshop. "The brilliant bassist David Friesen and his
trio, who are all accomplished musicians with years of experience mak
ing music together, bring a rare listening opportunity to campus this
weekend."
Brazilian vocalist Claudia Villela and Shanna Carlson will give indi
vidual performances later in Autumn quarter.
Pickets for the general audience are $20; $18 for seniors, students
and Palo Alto Jazz Alliance members; and $5 for Stanford students. Pick
ets can be purchased at the Stanford Ticket Office in Tresidder Union.
Stanford veteran librarian passes away
Oswalda Deva, who began working in Stanford's libraries in 1959,
passed away at 91 on Sept. 30.
Deva had been living with her daughter, Dagmar Logie, in their Red
wood City home when she died.
"As Oswalda's daughter I have, of course, only the fondest memories
of my mother," Logie, an administrator in the English Department, said.
"Our family has benefited from the Stanford experience tremendously:
Oswalda and her husband Djafer both retired from Stanford, my broth
er Udo Kaiser graduated with an A.B. and M.A. in architecture, my hus
band Dennis and I met at Stanford as undergraduates and our son Hans
Logie graduated from Stanford with a degree in sociology. It's been 'all
in the family' at Stanford for us!"
A memorial service for Deva is scheduled to be held at 3 p.m. in Se
quoia Christian Church, 233 Topaz St., Redwood City.
