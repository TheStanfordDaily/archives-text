## New al-Quaida tapes broadcast 
### 
After a summer of silence, al-
Qaida leaders are back on the
Mideast air waves.
Experts say the terrorist
network is on a renewed
public relations campaign
aimed at keeping itself in the
public eye and associated
with events which could turn
the Arab public against the
United States.
U.S. counterterrorism offi
cials believe the tapes — coin
ciding with the one-year an
niversary of the war in
Afghanistan — are a sign of al-
Qaida's leadership asserting it
is still viable to its rank-and
file followers.
The recent taped statements
prompted the FBI toissueanew
warning to state and local law
enforcement agencies that a
new al-Qaida attack on the Unit
ed States has been approved by
the terror network's leadership.
But the agency said it did not
have any specific information
detailing where and when an at
tack may occur.
Yesterday, the State De
partment followed suit, issu
ing a worldwide caution to
Americans abroad to alert
them to "the continuing threat
of terrorist actions that may
target civilians."
Last month, the al-Jazeera
network aired voice record
ings of Osama bin Laden and
top al-Qaida operatives. The
CIA authenticated bin Laden's
voice, but officials said the
recordings probably weren't
made recently.
U.S. officials have not veri
fied bin Laden's whereabouts
this year and say a previously
aired videotape of him having
dinner with his associates in
early November in Afghanistan
is the last absolutely certain sign
he was alive.
Those thought to be alive
because of their recent
recordings include bin
Laden's No. 2, Ayman al-Za
wahri, and his spokesman Su

lairnan Abu Ghaith.
A U.S. official said this week
that a recent recording from al-
Zawahri appears to be genuine
and made in the last few weeks.
The recording, obtained by
Associated Press Television
News, was produced by a shad
owy production company be
hind previous al-Qaida video
tape. But the format of the al-Za
wahri recording is entirely dif
ferent from the videos released
in April which were crude, 30-
minute compilations of violent
images strung together with
Quranic verses and old footage
of bin Laden.
The latest disc features
snapshots of al-Zawahri and
news footage of anti-Ameri
can protests while he is
heard answering an inter
viewer's questions about
America's aims in the region
and its future.
The interview runs fora
brief five minutes and ends
abruptly with the juxtaposi
tion of two images: the col
lapse of the World Trade
Center and Israeli bulldoz
ers destroying a Palestinian
home.
Speaking about Iraq, he
accused Washington of seek
ing to subjugate the Arab
world on behalf of Israel —
America's strongest support
er in the region.
"The campaign against
Iraq has aims that go be
yond Iraq into the Arab Is
lamic world," al-Zawahri is
heard saying. "Its first aim is
to destroy any effective mili
tary force in the proximity
of Israel. Its second aim is to
consolidate the supremacy
of Israel."
State Dept. spokesman
Richard Boucher said the
United States continued to re
ceive "credible indications
that extremist groups and in
dividuals are planning addi
tional terrorist attacks against
U.S. interests."
