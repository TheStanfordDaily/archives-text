# Sniper strikes again with Virginia attack
## The
						Washington-area killer struck yet another gas station 
### 
MANASSAS, Va. (AP) â€” The
death toll from the Washington
area sniper rose to seven yesterday
as authorities said ballistics evi
dence had linked the killer to a
man gunned down at a Virginia
gas station.
Dean Meyers, 53, of Gaithers
burg, Md., was felled by a single
shot Wednesday night, moments
after filling his car's tank. Six other
people have been killed and two
have been wounded since the at
tacks began Oct. 2.
Prince William County Police
Chief Charlie Deane said the re
sults of an autopsy on Meyers and
ballistic evidence had linked the
cases. He pleaded for the killer to
give up: "There's enough damage
been done."
Police earlier said they were
searching for a white minivan seen
leaving the gas station in this bed
room community, but Deane said
the van's occupants had a reason
able explanation of their actions.
He refused to say whether there
were surveillance cameras at the
station, but said some cameras
were in the area.
"It's a difficult case but we are
developing more information as
the minutes go by," Deane said.
Manassas is about 35 miles
southwest of the Maryland sub

urbs where most of the attacks
happened. The shooting is the
second in Virginia: A woman was
wounded by the sniper last Friday
in Fredericksburg, 30 miles south
of here.
Police in yellow slickers walked
shoulder to shoulder through a
drizzling rain, looking for evi
dence near the gas station. Deane
did not say whether they had
found anything, but said there
had been no communication from
the killer.
A tarot death card with the
taunting words "Dear policeman,
1 am God" was found near a shell
casing outside a school in Bowie,
Md., where a 13-year-old boy was
critically wounded by the sniper
Monday. Authorities have refused
to discuss the card or any other ev
idence.
Investigators say the sniper, or
snipers, fired from a distance with a
high-powered hunting or military
style rifle. Like Meyers, all the vic
tims were lelled by a single bullet.
At a news conference, Com
monwealth's Attorney Paul Ebert
said he would seek the death
penalty against the killer. He said
a new Virginia law allows the
death penalty in killings "in which
the perpetrator tends to terrorize
the general public."
"11l have anything to do with it,
we will prosecute in this jurisdic
tion, and do it to the full extent of
the law," said Ebert, whose office
has sent more people to death row
than any other in Virginia.
