# House approves use of force in Iraq

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The House voted
296-133 yesterday to give President Bush the
broad authority he sought to use military force
against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein — with or
without U.N. support. The Senate was poised
to do the same and to deliver Bush a major na
tional security policy victory.
"The House of Representatives has spoken
clearly to the world and to the United Nations
Security Council: The gathering threat of Iraq
must be confronted fully and finally," Bush
said immediately after the vote.
Senate sponsors later succeeded in defeat
ing all efforts to weaken the proposal, opening
the way fora final vote late yesterday or early
Friday. "It is clear that we have lost this battle in
the Senate," said Sen. Robert Byrd, I)—W.Va.,
the most outspoken Senate foe of the resolu
tion. Byrd accused Congress of "handing the
president unchecked authority."
While Bush hailed the strong showing, a
majority of House Democrats voted against the
resolution — even though their leader, Dick
Gephardt of Missouri, was one of its authors.

"The issue is how to best protect America.
And I believe this resolution does that,"
Gephardt said.
Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, R —W.Va., who
voted for the resolution, said Bush had made
his case for war to Congress, the United Na
tions and American voters.
"In a world where a terrorist can use
weapons of mass destruction and kill several
million people in a matter of hours, we cannot
afford to sit and wait for others to strike us,"
Capito said. "Rather, we have responsibility to
identify and address potential threats to global
peace and stability."
The Senate was working on the same reso
lution, voting 75-25 to choke off delaying tac
tics and move toward a final vote. It voted
down a series of efforts to weaken or block the
resolution, as did the House. Senate leaders of
both parties predicted easy passage.
The administration got a big boost when
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle an
nounced he was putting aside his misgivings to
support the president.

"I believe it is important for America to
speak with one voice," said Daschle, D—S.I).
" It is neither a Democratic resolution nor a Re
publican resolution. It is now a statement of
American resolve and values."
But some Democrats remained opposed.
"The power to declare war is the most
solemn responsibility given to Congress by the
Constitution," said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D —Mass. "We must not delegate that respon
sibility to the president in advance."
The resolution gives the president wide lati
tude in defending the United States against the
"continuing threat" posed by Baghdad. In a
concession to Democrats, it encourages that all
diplomatic means be exhausted before force is
used, and requires reports to Congress every
60 days once action is taken.
Bush has said he hopes to work with the
United Nations, but he wanted congressional
authority to act independently if necessary.
The strong congressional backing he was re
ceiving could bolster U.S. efforts before the
U.N. Security Council.
