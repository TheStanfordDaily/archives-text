## The 						Stanford Daily Spanish immersion dorm deserves a second chance 
### 
Published Since 1891

Stanford's five language theme houses
offer some of the best ways for stu
dents to hone their language skills
and learn about cultural traditions
without actually leaving campus. Stanford's
first Spanish language immersion theme
dorm in Yost House, however, might not be
able to carry out its mission: the house lacks a
solid pool of Spanish speakers.
While those non-Spanish speaking resi
dents will undoubtedly contribute to the
dorm community, the lack of immersion set
ting runs contrary to the purpose of the
house. Such a program should not have
been established if implementing it was not
a possibility.
Yost was selected to house a Spanish and
Portuguese near-total immersion program
last spring, replacing the dorm's Human
Biology focus.
Surveys seemed to indicate overwhelm-

ing support for the program, and as many
as 50 percent of underclassmen said they
were interested in living in such a resi
dence. The faculty in the Spanish and Por
tuguese Department said it was excited
about doing something they had wanted to
do for years. For all intents and purposes,
the foundation and interest were there for
a solid program.
But it seems as though there was a lack of
follow through to ensure that the goals of
both the house and Residential Education
were met. Dorm staff is disappointed, but
they plan to make do with the current situ
ation. Could this situation have been avoid
ed in the first place?
A language immersion program pro
vides many ways in which the intentions of
Res Ed — intellectual stimulation, academ
ic progress and success, a pluralistic com
munity and leadership — can be realized.

In theory, immersion dorms enhance
language skills by giving students constant
exposure to new vocabulary and skill levels.
In addition, language houses and im
mersion programs allow students who go
overseas to maintain their level of fluency
once they return.
In a country where some knowledge of the
Spanish language is becoming necessary in a
variety of settings, it makes sense that Stan
ford increase the opportunities students
have to learn Spanish.
Those implementing the immersion
dorm should have paid more attention to
the assignment procedures at Housing and
Dining Assignment Services. Details about
what happened in the Draw regarding Yost
are unclear.
The Resident Fellow says she gave priority to
more students than could have lived in the
house; staff from Res Ed say too few students

were given priority, so the extra spots in the
house were opened up to non-priority students
(and non-Spanish speakers).
The bottom line is that miscommunica
tion and misunderstanding prevented a
good idea from being fully realized.
Res Ed should not change its priority sys
tem and the language immersion program
certainly deserves another shot.
What must be recognized, however, is
that a language immersion dorm is differ
ent than a theme dorm, and the assignment
system should be adjusted accordingly.
We suggest that in the future both
groups work closely together to anticipate
problems and to guarantee that a house like
Yost fulfills its stated mission. The language
immersion theme, after all, is why students
applied for priority.
In the future, it's only fair to everyone that
the house deliver what was promised.
