# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Anti-war stance is flawed 
### WILLIAM HUDSON GUEST columnist 
There has been a lot of press and opinion
devoted to the subject of the impending war
on Iraq in the past few weeks.What I find
missing from many of the activist remarks is
a consistent attempt to play the blame game
and wholeheartedly ignore that old forgot
ten standby — logic.
Many argue that the problem in Iraq was
of American construction and that ultimate
ly the United States is to blame for Saddam's
dictatorship and gross overextension of
power in the region and over the lives of his
own people.
Strikingly, and even ridiculously, this is
often cited as a primary reason for the Unit
ed States not to correct past wrongs and at
tempt to bring about a better solution.
There is no bigger fundamental logical flaw
than attempting to argue, in all seriousness,
that because someone causes a problem in
the past they should not be allowed to fix it
in the present.
Also, some activist cells like to point out
that America isn't very good at nation-build
ing: after all, look at Afghanistan. Pointing
to car bombs and attempted assassinations
in a newly formed country plagued by
decades of internal and external conflict
and somehow drawing out larger conclu
sions of American impotence to enforce pos
itive change is absolutely absurd.
While there are car bombs and internal
problems in the present iteration of
Afghanistan, one must take into considera
tion the progression that Afghanistan has
gone through in such a short time period.
Before American troops moved in,
women had virtually no rights, religious ex
tremism and outright persecution were the
name of the game and harboring terrorists
was considered to be civic duty.
While there are problems at present in
Afghanistan, they are the sorts of problems
one could expect in a newly formed nation
— rebellion and discontent were not for
eign to the aftermath of our country's revo
lution, either.
But still this is not enough. Americans
cannot be trusted to rebuild nations, anti
war activists say. We export our own norms
onto others and bring about economic and
political ruin.
If exporting values means giving women
some basic human rights and not gassing
your own populations, then I would argue
that this is a fair trade. When it comes to in
effective political and economic construc
tions, the more ast ute observer might look
to Japan or Germany and consider Ameri
ca's track record of nation-building.
Others point to the possibility of a larger
war with a destabilizing effect on the region.
Quite honestly, and as I've said before, this
is precisely what the region needs: some
thing that can shake the political founda
tions for some of the last regimes in the
world to support slavery and religious per
secution as a matter of state policy.

Perhaps the most unfounded argument
against U.S. action in Iraq is that the gov
ernment hasn't made Saddam's ties to A1
Qaeda credible enough.
While this line of thinking ignores the ve
racity of reports not only from American in
telligence but also from our principal Euro
pean opponent to military action, Ger
many, it is also completely irrelevant.
Whether or not Saddam has ties to A1
Qaeda would only lengthen his list of crimes
against his own people and the security of
the world at large; in the simplest sense,
there is certainly enough on the books
against Saddam to justify any American ac
tion in the country.
Most pressingly, his continual search for
weapons of mass destruction pose a special
danger to human liberty, freedom and po
litical change in the region.
If asked if the United States would be
Saddam's target with any newfound
weapons of mass destruction, I would
venture to guess with reasonable certain
ty that he would not. Again, the most
pressing consideration is not merely our
own interests, but the interests of the peo
ple of the Middle East.
We have to divorce ourselves from the no
tion that military action undertaken by the
United States in the Middle East only serves
the security interests of the United States.
Iran is on the verge of a revolution.
Kuwait is no friend of Saddam. Both are tar
gets for any Iraqi weapons of mass destruc
tion; the first case would effectively thwart
any revolution and thereby make the first
positive step towards basic human rights
and democratic rule in the region collapse
before it got started.
In the case of Kuwait, there is suffi
cient political and economic collateral to
make the case appealing to a tyrant like
Saddam Hussein.
Essentially, then, with weapons of mass
destruction Saddam would be able to so
lidify his own power, deter the United
States or United Nations from interven
ing and be able to deter revolutionary
democracy and human rights in the re
gion, especially in Iran.
Democratic rule on his borders would
endanger the political vitality of Saddam's
reign and ultimately would shift the bal
ance of power in the region in a fairly fun
damental way.
By deterring such revolution under the
smokescreen of biological or nuclear
weapons, Saddam maintains control of his
country and solidifies the Middle Eastern
resistance to reform and democratlicization.
And the people want to be democratic,
too. Look at the faces of the Iranians on
the news — they are tired of being op
pressed, tired of the tyranny, tired of the
religious persecution and moral
hypocrisy. They want little more than to
be free of these oppressions.

power in the region and over the lives of his
own people.
Strikingly, and even ridiculously, this is
often cited as a primary reason for the Unit
ed States not to correct past wrongs and at
tempt to bring about a better solution.
There is no bigger fundamental logical flaw
than attempting to argue, in all seriousness,
that because someone causes a problem in
the past they should not be allowed to fix it
in the present.
Also, some activist cells like to point out
that America isn't very good at nation-build
ing: after all, look at Afghanistan. Pointing
to car bombs and attempted assassinations
in a newly formed country plagued by
decades of internal and external conflict
and somehow drawing out larger conclu
sions of American impotence to enforce pos
itive change is absolutely absurd.
While there are car bombs and internal
problems in the present iteration of
Afghanistan, one must take into considera
tion the progression that Afghanistan has
gone through in such a short time period.
Before American troops moved in,
women had virtually no rights, religious ex
tremism and outright persecution were the
name of the game and harboring terrorists
was considered to be civic duty.
While there are problems at present in
Afghanistan, they are the sorts of problems
one could expect in a newly formed nation
— rebellion and discontent were not for
eign to the aftermath of our country's revo
lution, either.
But still this is not enough. Americans
cannot be trusted to rebuild nations, anti
war activists say. We export our own norms
onto others and bring about economic and
political ruin.
If exporting values means giving women
some basic human rights and not gassing
your own populations, then I would argue
that this is a fair trade. When it comes to in
effective political and economic construc
tions, the more ast ute observer might look
to Japan or Germany and consider Ameri
ca's track record of nation-building.
Others point to the possibility of a larger
war with a destabilizing effect on the region.
Quite honestly, and as I've said before, this
is precisely what the region needs: some
thing that can shake the political founda
tions for some of the last regimes in the
world to support slavery and religious per
secution as a matter of state policy.

Perhaps the most unfounded argument
against U.S. action in Iraq is that the gov
ernment hasn't made Saddam's ties to A1
Qaeda credible enough.
While this line of thinking ignores the ve
racity of reports not only from American in
telligence but also from our principal Euro
pean opponent to military action, Ger
many, it is also completely irrelevant.
Whether or not Saddam has ties to A1
Qaeda would only lengthen his list of crimes
against his own people and the security of
the world at large; in the simplest sense,
there is certainly enough on the books
against Saddam to justify any American ac
tion in the country.
Most pressingly, his continual search for
weapons of mass destruction pose a special
danger to human liberty, freedom and po
litical change in the region.
If asked if the United States would be
Saddam's target with any newfound
weapons of mass destruction, I would
venture to guess with reasonable certain
ty that he would not. Again, the most
pressing consideration is not merely our
own interests, but the interests of the peo
ple of the Middle East.
We have to divorce ourselves from the no
tion that military action undertaken by the
United States in the Middle East only serves
the security interests of the United States.
Iran is on the verge of a revolution.
Kuwait is no friend of Saddam. Both are tar
gets for any Iraqi weapons of mass destruc
tion; the first case would effectively thwart
any revolution and thereby make the first
positive step towards basic human rights
and democratic rule in the region collapse
before it got started.
In the case of Kuwait, there is suffi
cient political and economic collateral to
make the case appealing to a tyrant like
Saddam Hussein.
Essentially, then, with weapons of mass
destruction Saddam would be able to so
lidify his own power, deter the United
States or United Nations from interven
ing and be able to deter revolutionary
democracy and human rights in the re
gion, especially in Iran.
Democratic rule on his borders would
endanger the political vitality of Saddam's
reign and ultimately would shift the bal
ance of power in the region in a fairly fun
damental way.
By deterring such revolution under the
smokescreen of biological or nuclear
weapons, Saddam maintains control of his
country and solidifies the Middle Eastern
resistance to reform and democratlicization.
And the people want to be democratic,
too. Look at the faces of the Iranians on
the news — they are tired of being op
pressed, tired of the tyranny, tired of the
religious persecution and moral
hypocrisy. They want little more than to
be free of these oppressions.

There has been a lot of press and opinion
devoted to the subject of the impending war
on Iraq in the past few weeks.What I find
missing from many of the activist remarks is
a consistent attempt to play the blame game
and wholeheartedly ignore that old forgot
ten standby — logic.
Many argue that the problem in Iraq was
of American construction and that ultimate
ly the United States is to blame for Saddam's
dictatorship and gross overextension of
power in the region and over the lives of his
own people.
