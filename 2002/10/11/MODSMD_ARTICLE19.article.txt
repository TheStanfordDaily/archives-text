Campus Watch should be 'commended'
for bringing biases to light
I read with great dismay your edito
rial "Campus Watch Stifles Freedom of
Expression" on Oct. 9. While I cannot
speak to the quality of Middle Eastern
Studies at Stanford, as an alum of
Georgetown University (another
school on Daniel Pipes's list). I was
painfully aware of many instances of
bias in the curriculum.
In one of the most egregious examples
that I personally witnessed, a professor in
my Islamic theology course asserted as a
fact that the primary motivation behind
America's support for Israel's founding
was that Jewish financiers had bought off
President Truman.
Such statements are not merely anti-Is
raeli, but rather the crudest form of anti-
Semitism. While I do not believe such
statements are representative of the views
of most academics, the fact that they often
go unchallenged speaks volumes about
the state of contemporary Middle Eastern
Studies. Mr. Pipes should be commended
for helping to bring such biases to light.
Secondly, I am puzzled by your invoca
tion of "freedom of expression" while
denying the same right to Mr. Pipes. A
privately run and financed Web site ex
pressing one's views about a contempo
rary issue is the height of freedom of ex
pression, not its enemy. In fact, by care
lessly throwing around emotionally laden
terms like "McCarthy-style tactics" (where
are the government blacklists?) at its op

ponents, it is the Daily's editorial board
that seems to be seeking to suppress de
bate, not Mr. Pipes.

Grad student says: 'we have
nothing to hide'
The Oct. 9 editorial ("Campus Watch
Stifles Freedom of Expression") on the
Campus Watch initiative claims to be for
free speech but instead ends up arguing
against it. The issue at stake is a new Web
site, www.campus-watch.org, that com
ments on the treatment of Middle Eastern
studies on college campuses. The editorial
claims that this Web site attempts to "quiet
voices in American academia that clearly
differ from [its] own."
While the Web site has a pro-Israeli
stance, it seeks only to illuminate instances
of anti-Israeli teaching on campuses. In
doing so, it adds a new meta-level to the
rich discussion of the conflicts in the Mid
dle East. The commentary provided and
other articles of this type enable students
to realize the unfortunate fact that some
professors may be biased, either for or
against Israel, and that this bias may affect
their teaching.
The editorial however concludes, "this
is one campus that [they] definitely don't
have to watch." While I know that we have
nothing to hide, let the world watch so that
they too can appreciate the diversity of
opinion present here.

Editorial neglects the fact that Judaism is
not a 'unified political voice'
Look, we have a Jewish department, so
we couldn't be anti-Israel. This seems to be
a message of the Daily's Oct. 9 editorial,
"Campus Watch stifles academic freedom
of expression."
The Daily uses the presence ofTaube
Center for Jewish Studies to refute Cam
pus Watch's claim that Stanford is anti-Is
rael. By implicating Taube, the Daily
wrongly politicizes Judaism.
True, Israel is a Jewish state and Taube
is a Jewish depart ment. But by connecting
the two, the Daily views Judaism as a uni
fied political force, capable of mediating
Israeli views on campus.
Judaism is a religion, a culture and a
country, but all three elements do not nec
essarily coincide. And without a political
agenda, the Jewish Studies department is
irrelevant to the issue at hand.
Taube studies Jews as Jews and not
Jews as pro-Israelis. The Middle East
courses that Taube does offer actually
cross-register into other departments;
they are by no means "Jewish courses."
In fact, Campus Watch has targeted
Stanford History Prof. Joel Beinin as anti-
Israel, but at the same time, his Arab-Is
raeli course actually falls within Jewish
Studies. Clearly, Taube Center for Jewish
Studies does not translate to a pro-Israel
view on campus.
A Jewish department could easily exist
