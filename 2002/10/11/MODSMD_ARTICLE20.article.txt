# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## LGBT.CRC invites everyone to celebrate Coming Out Day 
### MOLLY GOLDBERG GUEST COLUMNIST 
Today is National Coming Out Day,
and chances are, l here are a bunch of peo
ple who will not read beyond the first hall
of this sentence. "What does NCOD have
to do with me. l '' many ask. "I'm not gay or
I'm already out." Maybe these people
haven't seen the LCBT Community Re
sources Center's poster campaign.
Perhaps these people missed the
Queer Straight Social and Political Al
liance's kick-off social last night, "Open
ly Queer, Openly Allied." For whatever
reason, there are people out there who

think that today doesn't apply to them.
Each of us, at various points through
out our lives, feels compelled to "come
out" about some part of who we are or
what we believe.
Perhaps you've recently realized that
you don't even like computer science,
and that what you really want to be is an
English major. Now all you have to do is
break the news to ;ill your techie friends
and your parents (who have been saving
for you to go to Call ech since you were
in the womb).
There are times when you may have
to come out about your religious affilia
tion, your socio-economic class, your

gender identity, your political beliefs or
pretty much anything else that can't be
discerned just by looking at you.
If we all have hidden parts of our
identity, or if society makes inaccurate
assumptions about who we are based on
any number of external factors, then
coming out isn't just a queer issue. It's a
human issue. Today we have the oppor
tunity to reflect on how to make our com
munity safer for anyone and everyone to
be who they are. Yes, NCOD focuses
most on the issue of coming out about
sexual orientation, but (and this goes out
to all the straight readers) anyone can
come out about their sexuality.

Chances are that your sexuality is not
the only part of your identity and it
might not even be your primary identi
ty. But NCOD isn't about boiling your
selfdown to one word, picking the one
label that explains it all. Today is about
examining all the different ways there
are to be you.
Just as important, today is about
doing more than merely tolerating all of
the ways the rest of the world expresses
itself, but rather actively working to cre
ate an environment at Stanford where
everyone is safe to celebrate and honor a
greater part of who they are.
Today I challenge you to come out as

a lew things. Hang an "I support Queer
Rights" sign on your door and come out
as an ally. Talk to someone about this ar
ticle — someone you doubt made it past
the first line. Ask people questions about
themselves and appreciate when their
answers aren't simple. Question yourself
when your own answers are simple,
dome out as the complex, constantly
changing person you most likely are.

Molly Goldberg and the Staff of the LGBT
Community Resources Center (LGBT.CRC)
invites you to come out and join the effort to
support queer rights. For more information
