## Moore: A big back making the big plays 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
From the 1999 Rose Bowl team to Buddy Teevens'
inaugural team, senior fullback Casey Moore has been
on the field for it all.
A four-year starter, Moore has seen a lot of
changes to the Cardinal football team (1-3, 0-1 Pacif
ic- 10 Conference).
"It's been interesting," Moore said. "You see a lot of
the g(xxl years, and you see some of the bad years."
Though this year's Cardinal team has so far found it
selfon the "bad" side of things, Moore has been a bright
spot on offense, leading the team in rushing while se
nior Kerry Carter has been hobbled by a knee injury.
"I've just kind of gotten the opportunity and taken
advantage of it," Moore said. "It's definitely been a lot
of fun this year getting to carry the ball more and do dif
ferent things in the offense."
However, as a player who has spent most of his time
on the field blocking for Cardinal tailbacks, Moore en
joys the less noticeable aspects of his job.
"Any running back will tell you, carrying the ball, if
the guys aren't blocking for you, you're not going to get
much on your own," Moore said. "Everybody's got to
be blocking to spring that running back, so it's nice to
be a part of that team effort."
The 6-foot-2, 250-pound Moore looks like a bruis
ing short-yardage back, but throughout his career he
has had a knack for breaking off long runs. In 1999, he
sprinted 94 yards fora touchdown against California
and 49 yards fora score against Arizona, both sealing
Cardinal victories. This year, he broke through the line
of scrimmage against Arizona State and rumbled 68
yards for the touchdown.
"I definitely think I have surprised some people
with my abilities to get those long runs," Moore said.
Moore also has endeared himself to Stanford fans by
shining against Cal. He has won the Frank Rehm
Memorial Award for the best back in the Big Game
twice already in his career, totaling three touchdowns
while gaining 153 yards on only 14 carries.
"That's a big game lor us, and I think as our teams
have [always] done, we get really focused for that
game," Moore said.
Moore has never gotten many carries because of
Stanford's backfield depth, something that has not
changed this year, as Teevens has substituted early and
often. Moore thinks that's not a bad thing.
