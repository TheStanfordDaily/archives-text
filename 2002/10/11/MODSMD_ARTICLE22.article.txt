# A 						sports fan's dilemma
## 
### 
Ah, Saturday. No class. No reason to wake up.
And fora sports bum like myself, life is good,
because Saturdays are college football days.
Days where I can wake up, roll out of bed,
collapse on the couch and turn on the TV for 12
straight hours. I watch some Big East, some Pac-10
and some SEC. Fora break, maybe I will watch a little
"City Guy" before going back to the Miami-Florida
State game.
But this Saturday was going to be even better. For
the first time since school started, the Cardinal was
playing at home. Finally I could go to a game! I could
yell with my fellow students and lose my voice. I could
watch the Band and have some lemonade in the hot
sun. It was going to be great.
But suddenly, I had to make a decision, and I hate
making decisions. I was offered the a ticket to Satur
day's (iiants game against St. Louis.
It isn't often that you get a chance to go to a Na
tional League Championship Series game. How can I
decide between these two amazing but conflicting op
portunities? I thought I would break the decision
down into components to help me choose:

•The Athletes
Stanford Game: Two teams of stu
dent athletes compete for bragging
rights and the ability to play in a post
season game.

Giants Game: Two teams of steroid-filled athletes
compete for bonuses and the ability to play another
week of games on FOX.
Advantage: Stanford. I never saw Jim Edmonds or
Barry Bonds in my stats class.
•The Tempo of the Game
Stanford Game: With the ball Hying around like a
hacky sack, tomorrow's game should be changed to a
first-to-100-points format.
Giants game: During the Giants' Game H loss in
the Division Series, I got up, went to the bathroom,
talked to a friend and bought a pretzel in time to
watch the same batter hit a fly ball to left field.
Enough said.


Jacob Saperstein
Advantage: Stanford. Frickin'
baseball.
•Atmosphere
Stanford Game: There is noth
ing quite like a good cheer of" Pen
etrate, penetrate, score, score."
Giants Game: There is nothing
quite like watching a drunk fan get
kicked out of the ballpark.
Advantage: Giants. At the
NLI)S I saw someone throw beer
on a Braves fan and then argue his
ejection.
•Stadium
Stanford Game: With my binoc
ulars I hopefully will be able to look
past the track surrounding the
field to actually watch the game.
Giants Game: If the game gets
ugly, I can always go watch a five
year-old try to throw as fast as
Manny Aybar, or just walk behind
the bleachers and watch the ships
in McCovey's Gove.
Advantage: Giants. Pacific Bell

Park is the most beautiful park 1
have ever seen.
• Entertainment
Stanford Game: You get to
watch the Stanford Band run
around the field like a bunch of
headless chickens.
Giants Game: Between innings
you can watch random people
dance like idiots on the big screen.
Advantage: Stanford. At least the
Band plays music while they dance.
•Importance
Stanford Game: For the Cardi
nal, a loss on Saturday will severe
ly decrease their chances of mak
ing a bowl game.
Giants Game: It's the World
Series or go home.
Advantage: Push. The college
football season is one long playoff .
After the Cardinal's three losses, it
has to win five of seven to qualify
fora bowl game.
•Fans
Stanford Game: It is in
evitable that during a break be
tween quarters someone will be
reading physics.

Giants Game: It is inevitable
that during a break between in
nings someone around you will yell
something that makes absolutely
no sense but is at least obscene.
Advantage: Giants game. My
personal favorite was when some
one yelled, "Oh come on ump. F—
ing f-—k!"
•Team Pride
Stanford Game: GO CARDI
NAL!
Giants Game: Giants and St.
Louis? When does basketball start?
Advantage: Stanford. Go
Dodgers!
It was close, but it looks like I
will be at Stanford Stadium tomor
row to watch the Cardinal's first
home game in almost a month.
But that won't stop me from call
ing my Giants-loving roommate
for updates.

Jacob Saperstein is a sophomore major
ing in public policy. He hopes lhal the
(Hants game is over after the Jirst in
ning so he can go to the Stanford game
with a dear conscience. Email him at

Ah, Saturday. No class. No reason to wake up.
And fora sports bum like myself, life is good,
because Saturdays are college football days.
Days where I can wake up, roll out of bed,
collapse on the couch and turn on the TV for 12
straight hours. I watch some Big East, some Pac-10
and some SEC. Fora break, maybe I will watch a little
"City Guy" before going back to the Miami-Florida
State game.
But this Saturday was going to be even better. For
the first time since school started, the Cardinal was
playing at home. Finally I could go to a game! I could
yell with my fellow students and lose my voice. I could
watch the Band and have some lemonade in the hot
sun. It was going to be great.
But suddenly, I had to make a decision, and I hate
making decisions. I was offered the a ticket to Satur
day's (iiants game against St. Louis.
It isn't often that you get a chance to go to a Na
tional League Championship Series game. How can I
decide between these two amazing but conflicting op
portunities? I thought I would break the decision
down into components to help me choose:

•The Athletes
Stanford Game: Two teams of stu
dent athletes compete for bragging
rights and the ability to play in a post
season game.

Giants Game: Two teams of steroid-filled athletes
compete for bonuses and the ability to play another
week of games on FOX.
Advantage: Stanford. I never saw Jim Edmonds or
Barry Bonds in my stats class.
•The Tempo of the Game
Stanford Game: With the ball Hying around like a
hacky sack, tomorrow's game should be changed to a
first-to-100-points format.
Giants game: During the Giants' Game H loss in
the Division Series, I got up, went to the bathroom,
talked to a friend and bought a pretzel in time to
watch the same batter hit a fly ball to left field.
Enough said.


Jacob Saperstein
Advantage: Stanford. Frickin'
baseball.
•Atmosphere
Stanford Game: There is noth
ing quite like a good cheer of" Pen
etrate, penetrate, score, score."
Giants Game: There is nothing
quite like watching a drunk fan get
kicked out of the ballpark.
Advantage: Giants. At the
NLI)S I saw someone throw beer
on a Braves fan and then argue his
ejection.
•Stadium
Stanford Game: With my binoc
ulars I hopefully will be able to look
past the track surrounding the
field to actually watch the game.
Giants Game: If the game gets
ugly, I can always go watch a five
year-old try to throw as fast as
Manny Aybar, or just walk behind
the bleachers and watch the ships
in McCovey's Gove.
Advantage: Giants. Pacific Bell

Park is the most beautiful park 1
have ever seen.
• Entertainment
Stanford Game: You get to
watch the Stanford Band run
around the field like a bunch of
headless chickens.
Giants Game: Between innings
you can watch random people
dance like idiots on the big screen.
Advantage: Stanford. At least the
Band plays music while they dance.
•Importance
Stanford Game: For the Cardi
nal, a loss on Saturday will severe
ly decrease their chances of mak
ing a bowl game.
Giants Game: It's the World
Series or go home.
Advantage: Push. The college
football season is one long playoff .
After the Cardinal's three losses, it
has to win five of seven to qualify
fora bowl game.
•Fans
Stanford Game: It is in
evitable that during a break be
tween quarters someone will be
reading physics.

Giants Game: It is inevitable
that during a break between in
nings someone around you will yell
something that makes absolutely
no sense but is at least obscene.
Advantage: Giants game. My
personal favorite was when some
one yelled, "Oh come on ump. F—
ing f-—k!"
•Team Pride
Stanford Game: GO CARDI
