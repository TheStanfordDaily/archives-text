						sports fan's dilemma
## 
### 
Ah, Saturday. No class. No reason to wake up.
And fora sports bum like myself, life is good,
because Saturdays are college football days.
Days where I can wake up, roll out of bed,
collapse on the couch and turn on the TV for 12
straight hours. I watch some Big East, some Pac-10
and some SEC. Fora break, maybe I will watch a little
"City Guy" before going back to the Miami-Florida
State game.
But this Saturday was going to be even better. For
the first time since school started, the Cardinal was
playing at home. Finally I could go to a game! I could
yell with my fellow students and lose my voice. I could
watch the Band and have some lemonade in the hot
sun. It was going to be great.
But suddenly, I had to make a decision, and I hate
making decisions. I was offered the a ticket to Satur
day's (iiants game against St. Louis.
It isn't often that you get a chance to go to a Na
tional League Championship Series game. How can I
decide between these two amazing but conflicting op
portunities? I thought I would break the decision
down into components to help me choose:

•The Athletes
Stanford Game: Two teams of stu
dent athletes compete for bragging
rights and the ability to play in a post
season game.

Giants Game: Two teams of steroid-filled athletes
compete for bonuses and the ability to play another
week of games on FOX.
Advantage: Stanford. I never saw Jim Edmonds or
Barry Bonds in my stats class.
•The Tempo of the Game
Stanford Game: With the ball Hying around like a
hacky sack, tomorrow's game should be changed to a
first-to-100-points format.
Giants game: During the Giants' Game H loss in
the Division Series, I got up, went to the bathroom,
talked to a friend and bought a pretzel in time to
watch the same batter hit a fly ball to left field.
Enough said.
