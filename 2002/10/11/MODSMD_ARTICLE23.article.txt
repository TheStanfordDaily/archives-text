other shot at C )klahoma.
Ken Dorsey plans to become the first Miami quar
terback to beat Florida State three times.
And Georgia, at long last, can take control of the
SEC East with a victory over Tennessee.
Texas-Oklahoma. Florida State-Miami. Ten-
Jeorgia.
Nearly midway through the season, college loot
ball stages its first Showdown Saturday, featuring ri
valry games with implications for conference title's
and the national championship.
No game is bigger than No. 3 Texas (5-0) vs. No. 2
Oklahoma (5-0) in the Red River Shootout at the Cot
ton Bowl. It's the second straight year both teams arc
undefeated and ranked in the top five. Hie winner
takes control of the Big 12 South.
"I'm proud that the game means what it means na
tionally now," Texas coach Mack Brown said. "It is
like a bowl game at midseason."
Brown will feel a lot better with a victory. So will

No. 1 Miami (5-0), which plans to knock oil No. 9
Florida State (5-1) and end the Seminoles' national
title hopes.
The I lurricanes own the nation's longest winning
streak at 27 games — two shy of the school record.
Dorsey is 31-1 as a starter and has thrown for 577
yards and five 11 )s in two wins over Florida State.
"I think he comes alive when the pressure is on,"
Miami coach Larry Coker said.
Sixth-ranked Georgia (5-0,2-0 SEC) can take a big
steptoward reaching its first SEC title game with a win
over No. 10 Tennessee (4-1, 1-1). Since the league
went to divisional play in 1992, the SEC East has been
won by either Florida or Tennessee.
"1 get chill bumps thinking about what can happen
if we win the rest of our games," Bulldogs receiver
Damian (lary said.
Oklahoma vs. Texas
Both teams are coming off close calls, perhaps
caught looking ahead to this season-defining game.
The Sooners don't have defensive stars such as Roy
