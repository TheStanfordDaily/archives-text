# It's a Saturday showdown
## 
### 
(AP) — Texas quarterback Chris Simms gets an
other shot at C )klahoma.
Ken Dorsey plans to become the first Miami quar
terback to beat Florida State three times.
And Georgia, at long last, can take control of the
SEC East with a victory over Tennessee.
Texas-Oklahoma. Florida State-Miami. Ten-
Jeorgia.
Nearly midway through the season, college loot
ball stages its first Showdown Saturday, featuring ri
valry games with implications for conference title's
and the national championship.
No game is bigger than No. 3 Texas (5-0) vs. No. 2
Oklahoma (5-0) in the Red River Shootout at the Cot
ton Bowl. It's the second straight year both teams arc
undefeated and ranked in the top five. Hie winner
takes control of the Big 12 South.
"I'm proud that the game means what it means na
tionally now," Texas coach Mack Brown said. "It is
like a bowl game at midseason."
Brown will feel a lot better with a victory. So will
Simms. In two losses against Oklahoma — 14-3 last
year and 03-14 in 2000 — Simms has no touchdown
passes and five interceptions
"I'm real confident, and think I'm going to go out
there and play a good game," Simms said.

There's no team playing with more bravado than
No. 1 Miami (5-0), which plans to knock oil No. 9
Florida State (5-1) and end the Seminoles' national
title hopes.
The I lurricanes own the nation's longest winning
streak at 27 games — two shy of the school record.
Dorsey is 31-1 as a starter and has thrown for 577
yards and five 11 )s in two wins over Florida State.
"I think he comes alive when the pressure is on,"
Miami coach Larry Coker said.
Sixth-ranked Georgia (5-0,2-0 SEC) can take a big
steptoward reaching its first SEC title game with a win
over No. 10 Tennessee (4-1, 1-1). Since the league
went to divisional play in 1992, the SEC East has been
won by either Florida or Tennessee.
"1 get chill bumps thinking about what can happen
if we win the rest of our games," Bulldogs receiver
Damian (lary said.
Oklahoma vs. Texas
Both teams are coming off close calls, perhaps
caught looking ahead to this season-defining game.
The Sooners don't have defensive stars such as Roy
Williams and Rocky Calmus around this year, but the
results haven't changed much.
Oklahoma is allowing just 13
points and 299.4 yards. Texas lias
been even better — 9.4 points and
225.6 yards per game.
Simms is the key, though. The
Sooners will try to stop running
back Cedric Benson and force
Simms to throw. The strategy lias
worked before.
"You've got to stop the run first,
but when you do, they're going to
throw it," OU coach Bob Stoops

said. "You've got to be able to
cover 'em. Fortunately, we have in
the past and hopefully we can
again."
Florida State at Miami
Now it's the Seminoles trying to
keep pace with the Hurricanes.
Florida State has five losses in its last
16 games — three to imranked
teams, including Louisville on Sept.
26. No longer feared, the 'Noles
know it will take an exceptional ef
fort to upset the 'Canes, who ended
FSU's 54-game home unbeaten
streak last year with a 49-27 win.
"They are dominating now like
we dominated the '905," Florida
State coach Bobby Bowden said.
"We were kind of the elite, us and
Nebraska and you'd have to say
Florida. Miami was down. But now
Miami is back. Right now, they're
sitting one level up."
Dorsey's totals — 1,044 yards
and 14 I Ds — aren't as great as ex
pected, but that's because lie can
simply hand off to Willis McGahee,
who's averaging 128 yards a game
and 8.1 yards a carry.
Florida State quarterback Chris
Rix has been inconsistent — he's

even been booed at home — but
the Seminoles are still scoring 38.5
points per game.
Tennessee at Georgia
Vols coach Phillip Fulmer is
being coy about an injury to quar
terback Casey Clausen's shoulder
— the non-throwing left one. Fx
pect Clausen to play, as Tennessee
desperately needs a win to keep its
SFC title hopes alive.
The Vols make a rare trip out
side the state to visit a team off to its
best start in 20 years. Georgia, a
27-25 winner at Alabama last
week, is looking for its first home
win over a top-10 SEC opponent
since 1976.
"We feel like we've got a special
team," 'I)awgs quarterback David
Greene said. "We feel like we can
be a great football team. We've not
reached our potential yet."

matchups include No. 7 Oregon at

who's averaging 128 yards a game
and 8.1 yards a carry.
Florida State quarterback Chris
Rix has been inconsistent — he's

even been booed at home — but
the Seminoles are still scoring 38.5
points per game.
Tennessee at Georgia
Vols coach Phillip Fulmer is
being coy about an injury to quar
terback Casey Clausen's shoulder
— the non-throwing left one. Fx
pect Clausen to play, as Tennessee
desperately needs a win to keep its
SFC title hopes alive.
The Vols make a rare trip out
side the state to visit a team off to its
best start in 20 years. Georgia, a
27-25 winner at Alabama last
week, is looking for its first home
win over a top-10 SEC opponent
since 1976.
"We feel like we've got a special
team," 'I)awgs quarterback David
Greene said. "We feel like we can
be a great football team. We've not
reached our potential yet."
Other key conference
matchups include No. 7 Oregon at
I CLA and California at No. 20
use in the Pac-10.
No. 4 Virginia Tech (6-0, 1-0
Big Fast Conference) defeated

night.
(AP) — Texas quarterback Chris Simms gets an
other shot at C )klahoma.
Ken Dorsey plans to become the first Miami quar
terback to beat Florida State three times.
And Georgia, at long last, can take control of the
SEC East with a victory over Tennessee.
Texas-Oklahoma. Florida State-Miami. Ten-
Jeorgia.
Nearly midway through the season, college loot
ball stages its first Showdown Saturday, featuring ri
valry games with implications for conference title's
and the national championship.
No game is bigger than No. 3 Texas (5-0) vs. No. 2
Oklahoma (5-0) in the Red River Shootout at the Cot
ton Bowl. It's the second straight year both teams arc
undefeated and ranked in the top five. Hie winner
takes control of the Big 12 South.
"I'm proud that the game means what it means na
tionally now," Texas coach Mack Brown said. "It is
like a bowl game at midseason."
Brown will feel a lot better with a victory. So will
Simms. In two losses against Oklahoma — 14-3 last
year and 03-14 in 2000 — Simms has no touchdown
passes and five interceptions
"I'm real confident, and think I'm going to go out
there and play a good game," Simms said.

There's no team playing with more bravado than
No. 1 Miami (5-0), which plans to knock oil No. 9
Florida State (5-1) and end the Seminoles' national
title hopes.
The I lurricanes own the nation's longest winning
streak at 27 games — two shy of the school record.
Dorsey is 31-1 as a starter and has thrown for 577
yards and five 11 )s in two wins over Florida State.
"I think he comes alive when the pressure is on,"
Miami coach Larry Coker said.
Sixth-ranked Georgia (5-0,2-0 SEC) can take a big
steptoward reaching its first SEC title game with a win
over No. 10 Tennessee (4-1, 1-1). Since the league
went to divisional play in 1992, the SEC East has been
won by either Florida or Tennessee.
"1 get chill bumps thinking about what can happen
if we win the rest of our games," Bulldogs receiver
Damian (lary said.
Oklahoma vs. Texas
Both teams are coming off close calls, perhaps
caught looking ahead to this season-defining game.
The Sooners don't have defensive stars such as Roy
Williams and Rocky Calmus around this year, but the
results haven't changed much.
Oklahoma is allowing just 13
points and 299.4 yards. Texas lias
been even better — 9.4 points and
225.6 yards per game.
Simms is the key, though. The
Sooners will try to stop running
back Cedric Benson and force
Simms to throw. The strategy lias
worked before.
"You've got to stop the run first,
but when you do, they're going to
throw it," OU coach Bob Stoops

said. "You've got to be able to
cover 'em. Fortunately, we have in
the past and hopefully we can
again."
Florida State at Miami
Now it's the Seminoles trying to
keep pace with the Hurricanes.
Florida State has five losses in its last
16 games — three to imranked
teams, including Louisville on Sept.
26. No longer feared, the 'Noles
know it will take an exceptional ef
fort to upset the 'Canes, who ended
FSU's 54-game home unbeaten
streak last year with a 49-27 win.
"They are dominating now like
we dominated the '905," Florida
State coach Bobby Bowden said.
"We were kind of the elite, us and
Nebraska and you'd have to say
Florida. Miami was down. But now
Miami is back. Right now, they're
sitting one level up."
Dorsey's totals — 1,044 yards
and 14 I Ds — aren't as great as ex
pected, but that's because lie can
simply hand off to Willis McGahee,
who's averaging 128 yards a game
and 8.1 yards a carry.
