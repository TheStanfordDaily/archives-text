# Card faces tall order against Cougars
## 
### MATT LONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Though it seemed impossible, the
Stanford football team will feature an
even younger defense this Saturday
against No. 12 Washington State.
Senior nose tackle Craig Albrecht,
who has started two of the Cardinal's
four games, suffered an Achilles ten
don injury that will require surgery
and end his season. Fellow senior

Football
vs. No. 1 2 Washington St., Saturday,
2:00 p.m.

Trey Freeman lias been plagued by
an ankle injury, so Stanford (1-3, 0-1
Pacific-10 Conference) w ill start red
shirt freshman BabatundeOshinowo.
This brings the total number of un
derclassmen on the Cardinal's start
ing defense to seven. The inexperi
enced defense played well through
out most of last week's 31 -7 loss to No.
8 Notre Dame (5-0), holding the Irish
to just three first-half points and al
lowing only two touchdowns.
But this week's opponent poses an
entirely different kind of challenge.
The Cougars (5-1,2-0) haven't shown
the timely defense that Notre Dame
did in returning two second-half in
terceptions for touchdowns against
the Cardinal, but the Washington
State offense scores so much that the
defense can relax and just do its job.
The Cougars are led by senior
quarterback Jason Cesser, a I leisman
candidate and all-around superstar.
Cesser is completing just under 60
percent of his passes this season and
has thrown for 13 touchdowns against
just four interceptions.
Gesser may have the best pocket
presence and decision making of any
signalcaller in the nation, and when
ever he drops back to throw he also
has what might be the biggest receiv
ing corps.
At 6-foot-6, Mike Bush, like Stan
ford's sophomore wideout Teyo
Johnson, poses serious matchup
problems. Many teams have chosen to
line up double coverage against Bush
this season, giving 6-foot-3 Devard

Darling a chance to shine. Darling has
taken the opportunity in stride and
has lii up opposing secondaries. The
sophomore is tied for second in the
Pac-10 with eight touchdowns.
"They are a very talented group,"
Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens
said. "They were picked to finish No.
1 in the conference, and after watch
ing them on tape, that is for good rea
son. l hey are very thorough on of
fense. They throw the ball an awful lot
— any time, any place, any situation."
While Stanford would be wise to
focus on containing the Cougars' po
tent offense, the Cardinal desperately
needs to revisit the offensive drawing
board. Despite expectations that Stan
lord had the one of the Pac-10's
strongest offensive units, the Cardinal
has struggled to produce. T he passing
game is ranked last in the conference,
and junior quarterback Chris Lewis
can't seem to find any rhythm.
Lewis leads the conference in inter
ceptions with eight and is last among
starting quarterbacks with only four
passing touchdowns. Lewis shouldn't
take all the blame for the Cardinal's
passing woes, though, as pass protec
tion has been shaky at times and he is
often is forced to throw under pres
sure.
For Stanford to have any chance at
conference wins with Teevens' pass
heavy scheme, Lewis must improve
his play.
Despite his rough play so far,
Teevens gave Lewis a vote of confi
dence this week, naming him the
starter over redshirt freshman Kyle
Matter.
"Chris showed some very positive
things [against Notre Dame] that we
had not seen prior to Saturday,"
Teevens said. "The opportunity to
play an entire game was a plus for
him."
Stanford will play only its second
home game of the season and will
have student support for the first
time. The Cardinal won its home
opener against San Jose State, 63-26.
That game was Stanford's only relief
this season from the nation's top
teams, and the Cardinal has the
NCAA's toughest remaining sched

ule.
Stanford's seven final opponents
have a combined record of 28-10, and
the next four have a 17-4 advantage.
The Cardinal will play without
sophomore wide receiver Nick Sebes
for the next three to six weeks, '['he
speedster has provided flashes of bril

liance in limited time this season but
sustained a right knee injury against
Notre Dame. Players expected to play
through injury Saturday include se
nior leading rusher Casey Moore (foot
sprain), senior defensive tackle Matt
Leonard (ankle) and sophomore
Hanker Luke Powell.

needs to revisit the offensive drawing
board. Despite expectations that Stan
lord had the one of the Pac-10's
strongest offensive units, the Cardinal
has struggled to produce. T he passing
game is ranked last in the conference,
and junior quarterback Chris Lewis
can't seem to find any rhythm.
Lewis leads the conference in inter
ceptions with eight and is last among
starting quarterbacks with only four
passing touchdowns. Lewis shouldn't
take all the blame for the Cardinal's
passing woes, though, as pass protec
tion has been shaky at times and he is
often is forced to throw under pres
sure.
For Stanford to have any chance at
conference wins with Teevens' pass
heavy scheme, Lewis must improve
his play.
Despite his rough play so far,
Teevens gave Lewis a vote of confi
dence this week, naming him the
starter over redshirt freshman Kyle
Matter.
"Chris showed some very positive
things [against Notre Dame] that we
had not seen prior to Saturday,"
Teevens said. "The opportunity to
play an entire game was a plus for
him."
Stanford will play only its second
home game of the season and will
have student support for the first
time. The Cardinal won its home
opener against San Jose State, 63-26.
That game was Stanford's only relief
this season from the nation's top
teams, and the Cardinal has the
NCAA's toughest remaining sched

ule.
Stanford's seven final opponents
have a combined record of 28-10, and
the next four have a 17-4 advantage.
The Cardinal will play without
sophomore wide receiver Nick Sebes
for the next three to six weeks, '['he
speedster has provided flashes of bril

liance in limited time this season but
sustained a right knee injury against
Notre Dame. Players expected to play
through injury Saturday include se
nior leading rusher Casey Moore (foot
sprain), senior defensive tackle Matt
Leonard (ankle) and sophomore
Hanker Luke Powell.

Though it seemed impossible, the

even younger defense this Saturday

vs. No. 1 2 Washington St., Saturday,
2:00 p.m.

Trey Freeman lias been plagued by
an ankle injury, so Stanford (1-3, 0-1
Pacific-10 Conference) w ill start red
shirt freshman BabatundeOshinowo.
This brings the total number of un
derclassmen on the Cardinal's start
ing defense to seven. The inexperi
enced defense played well through
out most of last week's 31 -7 loss to No.
8 Notre Dame (5-0), holding the Irish
to just three first-half points and al
lowing only two touchdowns.
But this week's opponent poses an
entirely different kind of challenge.
The Cougars (5-1,2-0) haven't shown
the timely defense that Notre Dame
did in returning two second-half in
terceptions for touchdowns against
the Cardinal, but the Washington
State offense scores so much that the
defense can relax and just do its job.
The Cougars are led by senior
quarterback Jason Cesser, a I leisman
candidate and all-around superstar.
Cesser is completing just under 60
percent of his passes this season and
has thrown for 13 touchdowns against
just four interceptions.
Gesser may have the best pocket
presence and decision making of any
signalcaller in the nation, and when
ever he drops back to throw he also
has what might be the biggest receiv
ing corps.
At 6-foot-6, Mike Bush, like Stan
ford's sophomore wideout Teyo
Johnson, poses serious matchup
problems. Many teams have chosen to
line up double coverage against Bush
this season, giving 6-foot-3 Devard

Darling a chance to shine. Darling has
taken the opportunity in stride and
has lii up opposing secondaries. The
sophomore is tied for second in the
Pac-10 with eight touchdowns.
"They are a very talented group,"
Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens
said. "They were picked to finish No.
1 in the conference, and after watch
ing them on tape, that is for good rea
son. l hey are very thorough on of
fense. They throw the ball an awful lot
— any time, any place, any situation."
While Stanford would be wise to
focus on containing the Cougars' po
tent offense, the Cardinal desperately
needs to revisit the offensive drawing
board. Despite expectations that Stan
