# Card, Cougars take to the air
## 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN STAFF WRITER 
After a long break, the Cardinal
is Finally back at home.
At home, the Cardinal is per
fect. It has outscored its opponents
by 37 points and is averaging 63
points per game.

So it's only been one game.
That doesn't change the stats.
Coming off two rough loses, the
Cardinal has to linda way to turn
around the season during the cur
rent two-game homestand. With
conference games against No. 12
Washington State and Arizona up
next, the Cardinal has to play its

best football of the season to cata
pult itself back into the bowl pic
ture. With this in mind, here are six
tilings to watch for on Saturday:
1. Watch the people around
you. This advice is only for first
year Stanford students. Like all
other schools, Stanford has its own
cheers and traditions. By this time,
you may have the jump down in
"All Right Now," or you may not.
But that may be the least of
your problems. Bring your keys
(you'll need them before kickoffs)
and prepare for random cheers
at random times. It can be con
fusing, but all that matters is that
you scream loudly when the
Cougars are on offense and cheer
when we score.
2. Watch Jason Cesser. If the
Cougars are going to win on Sat
urday, it will be on Cesser's arm.
Cesser has thrown 13 touchdowns
this year with 1,600 yards to his
credit. A preseason Heisman Tro
phy candidate, he has dropped
out of the spotlight after Washing
ton State's 25-7 loss to Ohio State
on Sep. 14.
However, with a strong game
this week, Cesser may jump back
into the national race. Cesser will
be the best player to come to Stan
lord Stadium this year, and, if
nothing else, it should be fun to
watch someone who will be play
ing on Sundays next year.
3. Prepare lor a game of highs
and lows. Both the Cougars and
the Cardinal consider the pass
their primary weapon, so don't be
surprised if there are over 80 total
passing attempts in the game. The
Cougars boast a deep wide receiv
er corps with three players over 6-
foot-2.

in 2001, led the Cougars to a 45-39 victory at Stanford Stadium in that game.

nal cornerbacks are all six feet or
under, creating an intriguing
match-up. This game is going to
be decided in the air, just hope
fully not in the air above the Car
dinal cornet backs.
Regardless, with such empha
sis on the passing attack the
game is bound to be comprised
of big plays. Don't get too com
fortable if the Cardinal has a
lead and don't worry if we fall a
little behind.
4. Watch for trick plays. The
shift to Buddy Teevens' oflense
has taken some time this season.
Against Notre Dame, the Cardinal
used a trick reverse to receiver
Nick Sebes to advance into the red
zone. Don't be surprised if
Teevens uses some more trickery

to move (lit' ball down the field.
1 his should keep the Cougars de
fense oil balance.
5. Watch the undercard of
"Chris Lewis vs. Kyle Matter."
Teevens claims that there is no
controversy and that Lewis is the
starter, but he also adds that Mat
ter "is waiting in the wings."
Lewis has played excellently for
the Cardinal the last few years and
was one of the primary reasons
that the Cardinal won nine games
last season.
However, alter three intercep
tions against Notre Dame, Lewis'
hold on the starting job is becom
ing more tenuous. Matter has ma
tured throughout the year, show
ing poise within the pocket. In the
game against San Jose State, he
was on the field for the second half
as the team pulled ahead of the
Spartans. On Saturday, Lewis'
play will decide whether he keeps
the starting job.

II Lewis is unable to keep the
Cardinal in the game, Matter could
gel on the field for some of the dri
ves. If it is another messy game, the
Cardinal may have a full-blown
quarterback controversy.
6. Watch Kerry Carter. Last
week, Carter played his first snap
since the first play of the San Jose
State game. Coming into the sea
son, Carter was hoping to run for
over 1,000 yards as the primary
back in the offense. However, after
missing two games he has a total of
66 yards.
For the Cardinal offense to be
successful, Carter is going to have
to run the ball well. This will allow
the offense to open up and throw
the ball more effectively. In the
Cougars' loss to the Buckeyes, they
allowed 301 yards rushing. If the
Cardinal can exploit this weakness
in the Washington State defense, it
should be able to extend its home
winning streak.
