# Card, Cougars take to the air
## 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN STAFF WRITER 
After a long break, the Cardinal
is Finally back at home.
At home, the Cardinal is per
fect. It has outscored its opponents
by 37 points and is averaging 63
points per game.

So it's only been one game.
That doesn't change the stats.
Coming off two rough loses, the
Cardinal has to linda way to turn
around the season during the cur
rent two-game homestand. With
conference games against No. 12
Washington State and Arizona up
next, the Cardinal has to play its

best football of the season to cata
pult itself back into the bowl pic
ture. With this in mind, here are six
tilings to watch for on Saturday:
1. Watch the people around
you. This advice is only for first
year Stanford students. Like all
other schools, Stanford has its own
cheers and traditions. By this time,
you may have the jump down in
"All Right Now," or you may not.
But that may be the least of
your problems. Bring your keys
(you'll need them before kickoffs)
and prepare for random cheers
at random times. It can be con
fusing, but all that matters is that
you scream loudly when the
Cougars are on offense and cheer
when we score.
2. Watch Jason Cesser. If the
Cougars are going to win on Sat
urday, it will be on Cesser's arm.
Cesser has thrown 13 touchdowns
this year with 1,600 yards to his
credit. A preseason Heisman Tro
phy candidate, he has dropped
out of the spotlight after Washing
ton State's 25-7 loss to Ohio State
on Sep. 14.
However, with a strong game
this week, Cesser may jump back
into the national race. Cesser will
be the best player to come to Stan
lord Stadium this year, and, if
nothing else, it should be fun to
watch someone who will be play
ing on Sundays next year.
3. Prepare lor a game of highs
and lows. Both the Cougars and
the Cardinal consider the pass
their primary weapon, so don't be
surprised if there are over 80 total
passing attempts in the game. The
Cougars boast a deep wide receiv
er corps with three players over 6-
foot-2.

Heisman Trophy candidate Jason Gesser, pictured here against the Cardinal
in 2001, led the Cougars to a 45-39 victory at Stanford Stadium in that game.
The senior is only 800 yards away from WSU's all-time passing record.
