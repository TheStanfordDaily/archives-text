## Men battle injuries, conference foes 
### JIMMY WU EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Cardinal currently lias a
short list of wishes.
A healthy knee, quad and ankle
would do just line.
With the top-ranked men's soc
cer team (9-1) beginning its Pacif
ic-10 Conference schedule at
home, the squad could potentially
be without three seniors who are
currently responsible lor half of its
offensive production.

Johanes Mali/a (ankle) and outside
defender 'Ibdd Dunivani (quad),
the defending Pac-10 champions
would be fairly hard-pressed tot re
ate scoring opportunities against
tough conference rivals Washing
ton (3-3-3) and No. 18 Oregon
State (9-1) tonight and Sunday, re
spectively, at Maloney Field.
Despite the uncertainty of the
three's playing condition come
tonight, the Cardinal is still opti
mistic about its chances in the Pac
-10 and in this weekend's games.
"It's going to be tough filling in
for (the injured players]," senior
forward Sean VVhalen said.
"They're ;ill great players, and
they've been doing well. I lowever,
we're a pretty deep team, and we
just need guys to step up."
Coach Bret Simon believes that
his players will be able to fight
through this weekend.
"We're in the right frame of
mind to compete," Simon said.
"Kverybody knows these games
mean an awful lot. They are all ex
cited about it. We'll be ready."
However, if the three seniors
are unable to play this weekend,
they will be sorely missed.
Twelve of the 2<S team goals and
21 of its 31 assists this season have
been recorded by the three in
jured stars.

In addition, their leadership
presence would be difficult to re
place on the field. Levesque and
Dunivant are both captains on
the team.
Levesque, who battled a back
injury earlier in the season, has
been the same phenomenal offen
sive machine he was last season.
He currently leads the team in
points with 22, including a team
high 12 assists.
Oddly, his presence might be
the easiest to compensate for, as
Stanford is very deep on the front
line. Hoping to pick up the scoring
slack will be third-leading scorers
James 1 wellman and Darren Fer
nandez and sixth-leading scorer
sophomore forward Matt Janus/.
Fernandez and Twellman are
also players who have the versatil
ity to play midfield and try to
lessen the blow of Maliza's possible
absence.
Mali/a currently leads the team
with six goals, and his leadership
and relentless style of play in the
middle would be greatly missed.
With an important player from
the frontline and the middle po
tentially out, it was only fitting that
the injury bug also bit one of the
(Cardinal's top defenders.
In "Duni's" possible loss, the
Cardinal will miss its most offen
sive-minded defender. And
with the team's style of creating
scoring opportunities from the
back, his presence would be
hard to replace.
Without Dunivant, the still-de
veloping defense will face a huge
challenge against Oregon State's
high-octane offense. The athletic,
high-pressuring Beavers lead the
Pac-10 with 29 goals, paced by
Alan Gordon's nine scores.
With two new starters in fresh
man Chad Marshall and sopho
more Aaron Maines, Stanford's
defensive unit has not always
looked to be on the same page.
However, the group has perse
vered, allowing only eight goals

through 10 games.
Besides Dunivant and the in
creasing assimilation of Marshall
and Maines into the starting line
up, senior Taylor Graham has
played a huge role in getting the
defense in gear.
"Although we have let up a few
more goals than we would've
liked, I feel we have been doing a
decent job so far," Graham said.
"Sometimes we've played too of
fensively, which left us vulnerable
in the back, and so we've been
working on our defensive shape.
All of us understand how to de
fend. It's just putting the little
things together."
Although the team's defense
has done a good enough job so far,
the little things must be put to
gether quickly because the rest of
the conference will be aiming to
knock off the Cardinal.
Sophomore goalkeeper An
drew Ferris believes that the puz
zle is close to being completed.
"I definitely feel the team is
ready, but at the same time, every
conference game will be a tough
challenge," he said. "In the Pac
-10, every game is a battle. We're
ready, but we need to come and
play every minute of every game
to do well."
The challenge begins tonight
with a match against Washington.
Although they have not looked as

strong this season, the Huskies
have been a huge rival over the
past few years. Heading into the
game with a mediocre record,
there would be nothing more
boosting than an upset victory
over the conference favorite.
"I have heard that Stanford is
every bit as good if not better than
last season," Washington head
coach Dean Wurzberger said.
"Their returning players are out
standing and their new players are
first rate. I only hope our team can
hang with them."
New UCLA coach Tom Fitzger
ald believes that there will be a lot
of clawing for the top.
"It will be a very evenly
matched conference this year with
all of the teams doing well in their
games leading up to this week
end's start," he said. "I think the
Pac-10 championship will be de
cided later as opposed to sooner. It
should be a very exciting year."
The other Pac-10 opponents
waiting to face the Cardinal are
perennial rivals Fresno State and
California. Fresno State is new to
the conference this year.
According to Graham, the Bru
ins have always been a "thorn to
our side," and Fresno State has al
ways offered a hard-fought match.
And of course, the matchup
against Cal is always huge because,
well, it's Cal.
Stanford and Washington kick
off at Maloney Field at 7:30 p.m.
tonight. Sunday, the Cardinal
and the Beavers will get started at
1:00 p.m.

"Sometimes we've played too of
fensively, which left us vulnerable
in the back, and so we've been
working on our defensive shape.
All of us understand how to de
fend. It's just putting the little
things together."
Although the team's defense
has done a good enough job so far,
the little things must be put to
gether quickly because the rest of
the conference will be aiming to
knock off the Cardinal.
Sophomore goalkeeper An
drew Ferris believes that the puz
zle is close to being completed.
"I definitely feel the team is
ready, but at the same time, every
conference game will be a tough
challenge," he said. "In the Pac
-10, every game is a battle. We're
ready, but we need to come and
play every minute of every game
to do well."
The challenge begins tonight
with a match against Washington.
Although they have not looked as

strong this season, the Huskies
have been a huge rival over the
past few years. Heading into the
game with a mediocre record,
there would be nothing more
boosting than an upset victory
over the conference favorite.
"I have heard that Stanford is
every bit as good if not better than
last season," Washington head
coach Dean Wurzberger said.
"Their returning players are out
standing and their new players are
first rate. I only hope our team can
hang with them."
New UCLA coach Tom Fitzger
ald believes that there will be a lot
of clawing for the top.
"It will be a very evenly
matched conference this year with
all of the teams doing well in their
games leading up to this week
end's start," he said. "I think the
Pac-10 championship will be de
cided later as opposed to sooner. It
should be a very exciting year."
The other Pac-10 opponents
waiting to face the Cardinal are
perennial rivals Fresno State and
California. Fresno State is new to
the conference this year.
According to Graham, the Bru
ins have always been a "thorn to
our side," and Fresno State has al
ways offered a hard-fought match.
And of course, the matchup
against Cal is always huge because,
well, it's Cal.
Stanford and Washington kick
off at Maloney Field at 7:30 p.m.
tonight. Sunday, the Cardinal
and the Beavers will get started at
1:00 p.m.
The Cardinal currently lias a
short list of wishes.
A healthy knee, quad and ankle
would do just line.
With the top-ranked men's soc
cer team (9-1) beginning its Pacif
ic-10 Conference schedule at
home, the squad could potentially
be without three seniors who are
currently responsible lor half of its
offensive production.

vs. Oregon State, Sunday, 1:00 p.m,

Johanes Mali/a (ankle) and outside
defender 'Ibdd Dunivani (quad),
the defending Pac-10 champions
would be fairly hard-pressed tot re
ate scoring opportunities against
tough conference rivals Washing
ton (3-3-3) and No. 18 Oregon
State (9-1) tonight and Sunday, re
spectively, at Maloney Field.
Despite the uncertainty of the
three's playing condition come
tonight, the Cardinal is still opti
mistic about its chances in the Pac
-10 and in this weekend's games.
"It's going to be tough filling in
for (the injured players]," senior
forward Sean VVhalen said.
"They're ;ill great players, and
they've been doing well. I lowever,
we're a pretty deep team, and we
just need guys to step up."
Coach Bret Simon believes that
his players will be able to fight
through this weekend.
"We're in the right frame of
mind to compete," Simon said.
"Kverybody knows these games
mean an awful lot. They are all ex
cited about it. We'll be ready."
However, if the three seniors
are unable to play this weekend,
they will be sorely missed.
Twelve of the 2<S team goals and
21 of its 31 assists this season have
been recorded by the three in
jured stars.

In addition, their leadership
presence would be difficult to re
place on the field. Levesque and
Dunivant are both captains on
the team.
Levesque, who battled a back
injury earlier in the season, has
been the same phenomenal offen
sive machine he was last season.
He currently leads the team in
points with 22, including a team
high 12 assists.
Oddly, his presence might be
the easiest to compensate for, as
Stanford is very deep on the front
line. Hoping to pick up the scoring
slack will be third-leading scorers
James 1 wellman and Darren Fer
nandez and sixth-leading scorer
sophomore forward Matt Janus/.
Fernandez and Twellman are
also players who have the versatil
ity to play midfield and try to
lessen the blow of Maliza's possible
absence.
Mali/a currently leads the team
with six goals, and his leadership
and relentless style of play in the
middle would be greatly missed.
With an important player from
the frontline and the middle po
tentially out, it was only fitting that
the injury bug also bit one of the
(Cardinal's top defenders.
In "Duni's" possible loss, the
Cardinal will miss its most offen
sive-minded defender. And
with the team's style of creating
scoring opportunities from the
back, his presence would be
hard to replace.
Without Dunivant, the still-de
veloping defense will face a huge
challenge against Oregon State's
high-octane offense. The athletic,
high-pressuring Beavers lead the
Pac-10 with 29 goals, paced by
Alan Gordon's nine scores.
With two new starters in fresh
man Chad Marshall and sopho
more Aaron Maines, Stanford's
defensive unit has not always
looked to be on the same page.
However, the group has perse
vered, allowing only eight goals

Besides Dunivant and the in
creasing assimilation of Marshall
and Maines into the starting line
up, senior Taylor Graham has
played a huge role in getting the
defense in gear.

more goals than we would've
