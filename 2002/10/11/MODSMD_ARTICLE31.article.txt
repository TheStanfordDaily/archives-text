The 2002 Stanford women's
soccer season enters the spotlight
down in the land of the rich and fa
mous, as the Cardinal heads to Los
Angeles, Calif., to begin its Pacific
-10 Conference run.
With two conference games in
one weekend, the Cardinal will
need to get oil to a quick start in
what looks to be another tough
year in one of the nation's most tal
ented conferences.

" These two games will go a long
way toward deciding who is going to
be the leader coming into the Pac
-10 season," co-coach Paul Sapsford
said.
After running through it's non
conference schedule with a 9-1-0
record, including wins over four
ranked opponents, the Cardinal
appears ready for another compet
itive year in the Pac-10.
"Obviously there are never any
easy games in the Pac-10," Saps
ford said.
The latest NSCAA rankings,
which have Stanford in the No. 2
position, support Sapsford's claim.
Three Pac-10 teams are ranked in
the top-12 positions in the nation.
The Cardinal gets things going
this afternoon at 3:00 p.m. against
Southern California, with a sec
ond game against No. 12 UCIA
Sunday at 2:00 p.m.
The game against the Bruins
presents the Cardinal with an op
portunity for sweet revenge.
Last year's game against UCLA
is still fresh in the memory of
many on the Cardinal squad. After
losing to the Bruins at home, the
Cardinal watched UCLA take the
Pac-10 title back down 1-5 with
them. So the Cardinal, while re
specting its opponent, is certainly
looking forward to the chance to
play them again.

"Going down and playing
UCLA in their backyard will not be
easy," Sapsford said. "But we are
relishing the challenge."
This year's team appears to be
making a habit out of challenging it
self. The Cardinal t<x>k on the de
fending national champions in its
opening game and promptly beat
Santa Clara for the first time since
1994. Then Stanford ux>k on Texas
A&M, the team that eliminated it
from last year's College Cup — and
emerged with a 1-0 overtime victory.
I'he latest challenge came just
last weekend as the Cardinal took
on then-No. 2 North Carolina. In a
hard-fought game, Stanford came
up just a bit short and was handed
its first defeat of the year.
Yet with the composure of a
team boasting five seniors, the Car
dinal bounced right back.
"We thought there would be a lit
tle bit of a letdown, players down in
the dumps," Sapsford said. "That
wasn't the case at all, even on Satur
day in practice between the two
games ... a champion is always able
to respond in a positive manner, and
they did in a tremendous way."
The injury bug has plagued the
squad of late. Senior midfielder
Kelsey Carlson missed the first
starts of her Stanford career the last
two weekends with a badly
sprained ankle.
"She's well on the road to recov
ery," Sapsford said. "She's cleared
to go."
However, now the Cardinal
will have to fill the gaps of other in
jured players, as senior midfielder
Becky Myers is dealing with a knee
problem and junior defender Na
talie Spilger has an injured shoul
der. Finally, freshman striker Jen
nifer Farenbaugh has a hand in
jury that will keep her out of the
L.A. action.
"It's very disappointing to see
Jenni Farenbaugh out because she
has made a massive contribution to
this team," Sapsford said. "She's
just been phenomenal. It's a big
loss, but it's also an opportunity for
someone else to step in."

Understandably, the team
could have a lot on its mind: a
week as the top-ranked team in
the nation, a heart-breaking loss to
a rival squad, a rematch of one of
last season's toughest games and
the beginning of conference play.
Yet the team appears as com
posed and controlled as ever.
"They take each game as it
comes: that's what's so good about
this team," said Sapsford. "It's the
norm for us to have big games."
It should be a conference sea
son to look forward to for fans all

around the Pac-10. While No. 2
Stanford has to be considered the
early favorite, California lias post
ed impressive wins early and cer
tainly deserves its current No. 5
ranking. UCLA, always a strong
program, tell from its position last
week at No. 3 on the heels of their
OT loss to Santa Clara.
The conference season looks to
have all the makings of a good film:
plenty of action, a little drama and
a suspenseful ending. So what bet
ter place to kick things off than
Hollywood?
