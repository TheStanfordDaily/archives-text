After eight const* utive Seal s ( -tip Victo
ries. some may wonder how Stanford can
continue its dominance in collegiate athlet
ics. I lie answer is coat liing.

Men's Cross Country
at Arizona State Invitational, Today, 5:15 p.m.

The Stanford toadies and their stall
recruit athletes, train them and guide
them through possibly the most rigorous
combination of athletics and academics in
the nation.
()ne such coach is Vin I .ananna, director
of crosscountry and track and field. Lman
na tame to Stanford in 1992 from Dart
month, where lie found success coaching
the (iret*n Wavedislatu e running program
in an a( ademically intense environment.
"As a coach, von are a teacher, motiva

tor and technician outside of the class
room," Lananna said. "You are in the
unique position to support their athleti
cism, goals and values."
Since his arrival at the Farm, Linanna
lias worked to turn Stanford into one of the
most dominant distance programs in the
nation, claiming three NCAA champi
onships in cross country (men 1996, 1997;
women 1996) and one in track and field
(men 2000). Since 1990, no Stanford cross
country team has placed lower than fifth in
(he NCLAA Championships.
"I think ii is a great experience for these
guys to be on a potential championship
team," Linanna said. "But they need to bal
ance this with their individual aspirations.
I hey trust you as the coach to advise them
without compromising either."
But Lananna's fix us is not solely on col
let ling more trophies lor Stanford. He is
trainingthc next wave <>l elite American dis
tance runners.

In 2000, Lananna coached three Stan
lord runners to the Sydney Olympics.
I hese runners are helping to lead an Amer
ican resurgence of middle- and long-dis
tance competitors to challenge the Africans
who currently dominate the events.
Despite the success ol the United States
in international track competition, no
American has medaled at an event above
800 meters since 1984, when Brian
Diemer scored a bronze in the 3,000-
meter steeplechase.
"It is a problem with the system that we
have," said. "Right now, guys go
from high school to college to post-colle
giate programs. Everywhere else, you stay
with one coach and one program."
in 2001, Lananna tooka hiatus from ad
ministrative responsibilities to help build
the Nike Farm Team into a viable post-col
legiate distance running program. The
goal of the program is to offer coaching, la
< ilitics and support to emerging post-colle

giate runners.
"With the post-collegiate program, we
want to help bridge the gaps between col
lege and international competition that our
system has created," Lananna said. "Our
goal is to have these guys reach the A quali
fying standard lot the ()lympics by the time
they run the Olympic trials."
Athletes who place in the top three at
the Olympic trials earn a birth to the
()lympics or World Championships only if
they have met an A qualifying time. Dur
ing the last two international competi
tions, unprepared U.S. runners have been
required to desperately chase the stan
dard after the trials.
"We are hosting big meets like the U.S.
Open here at Stanford so that our athletes
don't have to travel to meet the standards,"
Lananna said. "We bring tlit* competition
here. We need last rates to produce these
times, and our meets go out last."
While the Farm Team is helping to

bridge college and post-collegiate run
ning, Lananna sees Stanford's team as a
bridge between high school and college
running. He believes that Stanford's
unique combination of academics, athlet
ics, athlete support and training environ
ment makes this an ideal place for any top
high school runner.
I his may help to explain the huge size
and depth of Stanford's roster. Unlike most
college programs, Lananna likes to build a
large but manageable team where the best
from across the nation can train together.
"It wouldn't be possible without the
coaching staff," Lmanna said. "|Assistant
coachesj Mike Reilly and Dena Kvans do ;i
great job helping to manage the program.
"The huge size of the team helps us to
rest and not over-race people. YVc can jug
gle the lineup without compromising our
ability to field a strong team."
