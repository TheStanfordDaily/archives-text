# Hosers and Irish and Bears, oh my!

### 
Thoughts, myths and half-truths
fora Friday morning: Cardinals
vs. Giants. This is a beautiful
thing. Angels vs. Twins. Almost
as beautiful.
For the first time in four years, there will be
two new teams in the World Series.
There are few things better than the
amount of baseball being watched in my
house right now. Games on during dinner (fi
nally, the Simpsons gone) and after dinner.
Sunday afternoon games, too.
Speaking of games on television, if yon
even moved from your couch last weekend,
you're not a real sports fan.
You had college football: Stanford-Notre
Dame, UCLA-Oregon State, Colorado-
Kansas State.
And you had baseball: Angels-Yankees,
A's-Twins, Giants-Braves.
You even had pre-event hype for the
Breeder's Cup, the horse race that's not im
portant enough to be in the Triple Crown.
Oct. 26 — mark your calendars now.
ALL ON TELEVISION. Free television,
even; no need to splice the cable into the
lounge.
And that was just Saturday. Sunday was ar
guably the main event, with the NFL taking
over for the college pigskin games and the
baseball continuing on.
Granted, some of the games were more
enjoyable than others.
The A's broke my heart, just as I thought
they could pull off one more comeback.
The Golden Domers, they just pissed me
off.

Should someone tell
Buddy Teevens that it is
within the collegiate rules to
score in the second half, as
well?
More importantly, is it too
early to be a little uneasy
about Big Game for the first
time in about a decade?
The Golden Bears have

started an unsettling trend of breaking
records this year. Beating Washington for
the first time in 19 games and handing the
Huskies their first home loss in 13 games.
You know they're looking to end one other
streak, too.
A big win like that might get them noticed
fora decent bowl, if they can keep things
rolling until Nov. 23rd.
Oh wait — 1 forgot about how they
dropped the ball on that whole academic
fraud fiasco and got slammed with the subse
quent suspension.
Speaking of dropping things, the puck
dropped two nights ago to start up this year's
NHL season.
The regular season, for those of you who don't
follow hockey, won't end until spring break.
Hie playoffs won't end until Commencement
And in the interim, bones will be broken,
teeth knocked out, mullets grown (bring it
back, Melrose!) and admired, gloves
dropped, lamps lit and blistering slap shots
from the point slammed in.
Plus you get post-game interviews from
guys whose noses haven't been straight
since they let us have bonfires in Lake Lag.

You know what they call the Hockey Hall
of Fame in Toronto?
The Temple of the Famous.
You gotta love hockey season.
This is also the prime time to watch our
friendly neighbors to the north on televi
sion waxing poetic about their national
sport. (Or is curling the national sport?)
Either way, I had the good fortune lobe in
Canada the last week of summer before
school started this fall, as TSN (the Canadian
ESPN) was in the process of intensely profil
ing every NHL team.
One anchor went so far as to describe
hockey players as "the most ferocious animals
on the face of the earth, with exception of the
polar bear."
I le said this with a straight face.
Sports Centre (clever spelling, eh?) was
devoting half of their shows every day to the
programming.
Five hours of coverage per TEAM.
There are 30 teams in the NHL. You do
the math.
Speaking of math, do you think Sports Il
lustrated would rank Texas ahead of us in
that department, as well?
No, I don't think so either.
I think they could count our Sears
Cups, though. You can still use your fin
gers for that.

Speaking of dropping things, the puck
dropped two nights ago to start up this year's
NHL season.
The regular season, for those of you who don't
follow hockey, won't end until spring break.
Hie playoffs won't end until Commencement
And in the interim, bones will be broken,
teeth knocked out, mullets grown (bring it
back, Melrose!) and admired, gloves
dropped, lamps lit and blistering slap shots
from the point slammed in.
Plus you get post-game interviews from
guys whose noses haven't been straight
since they let us have bonfires in Lake Lag.

You know what they call the Hockey Hall
of Fame in Toronto?
The Temple of the Famous.
You gotta love hockey season.
This is also the prime time to watch our
friendly neighbors to the north on televi
sion waxing poetic about their national
sport. (Or is curling the national sport?)
Either way, I had the good fortune lobe in
Canada the last week of summer before
school started this fall, as TSN (the Canadian
ESPN) was in the process of intensely profil
ing every NHL team.
One anchor went so far as to describe
hockey players as "the most ferocious animals
on the face of the earth, with exception of the
polar bear."
I le said this with a straight face.
Sports Centre (clever spelling, eh?) was
devoting half of their shows every day to the
programming.
Five hours of coverage per TEAM.
There are 30 teams in the NHL. You do
the math.
Speaking of math, do you think Sports Il
lustrated would rank Texas ahead of us in
that department, as well?
No, I don't think so either.
I think they could count our Sears
Cups, though. You can still use your fin
gers for that.
