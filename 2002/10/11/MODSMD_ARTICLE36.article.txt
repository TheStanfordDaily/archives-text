But the quest fora three-peat has gotten
off to a bumpy start, as the Cardinal competes
in Pacific Palisades, Calif., at the Intercolle
giate Tennis Association's Riviera All-Ameri
can Championships.
Competing in this year's tournament for
Stanford are freshmen Amber Liu and Alice
Barnes, junior Lauren Barnikow and sopho
more Erin Burdette.
In the first round of the main draw yester
day, Liu defeated Julie Deßoo of Duke, 2-6,
6-1, 6-4. Liu advanced through the qualify
ing rounds by defeating Emily Marker of
Maryland 6-0, 6-2 and Katie Granson of
Duke 6-1,6-1 in the final round of the quali
fying draw. Today she is scheduled to play
Vilmarie Castellvi of Tennessee.
Yesterday, Barnikow fell to Kate Pinch
beck of North Carolina 6-4, 6-1, and fellow

teammate Burdette fell to Amanda Johnson
of Duke 6-3, 6-4. The two were also upset in
doubles today, 8-4, by Kentucky players
Nathalie Roels and Sara Witten.
Head coach Lele Forood, a former Stan
ford player and Ail-American, had high
hopes entering the tournament, and her
hopes have not diminished for the rest of the
tournament or the year.
Given that the Cardinal won its 12th
NCAA team championship in the 22-year his
tory of the event — its fourth in the last six
seasons — with its defeat of the University of
Florida in last year's team final, she has good
reason to have such aspirations.
"We expect our freshmen, Amber Liu and
Alice Barnes, to make some noise and our re
turning players, Lauren Barnikow and Erin
Burdette, to get established among the top
players this year," Forood said.
The participants' previous accomplishments
are nothing to balk at and will prove a most for
midable challenge for the competition.
Liu is ranked among the top 350 players
in the world by the WTA. She is also the 2001
Girls 18-and-Under national champion.
Barnes, originally hailing from Cam
bridge, England, was the number one Eng
lish junior player and made it to the third

round of junior Wimbledon this summer.
Barnikow was ranked No. 15 in the pre
season collegiate rankings, while Burdette
was ranked No. 7.
The Riviera / ITA Women's All-American
Championships is the first major tournament
of the 2002-03 season.
It consists of two prequalifying tourna
ments of 64 singles players and 32 doubles
teams. The prequalifying segment was held
at UCLA.
The main draw, played yesterday through
Sunday, consists of eight singles players and
four doubles teams.
The tournament was inaugurated in
1983 with Lisa Spain of Georgia winning
the first title. Since then Stanford has dom
inated, with a total of eight singles and
doubles championships.
The Cardinal is followed by Texas with six
titles and Florida with two.
Earlier in the year, the team accepted an
invitation to the White House to represent
the top collegiate sports teams in America in
the 2002 NCAA Spring Sports Champi
onship Day. A win at the Riviera tourna
ment would serve to further solidify the
standing of the top-ranked team in the com
ing year.
