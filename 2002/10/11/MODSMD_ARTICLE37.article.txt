# Women take fifth place at Invitational
## 
### BRIAN DOYLE 
I'he Stanford women's golf
team turned in a much better re
sult in its second tournament oft he
year this week than in its season

opener last month. Hit'll again,
after iis next-to-last-place showing
at the Mason Rudolph Champi
onships in Nashville in September,
there wasn't really anywhere to go
hnt up.

The Cardinal took fifth at the
Edean Ihlanfeldt Invitational in
Tacoma, Wash. Led by senior Kim
Row ton, the Cardinal posted suc
cessively lower team rounds in the
three-day tournament that
wrapped up Wednesday, finish
ing with a final-round 294, the sec
ond-best score of the day among
the field.
Rowton fired a 2-over 221 for
the tournament, finishing sixth in
dividually. Freshman Kelly
Husted rebounded from a shaky
debut in Stanford's first tourna
ment with a very strong perfor
mance, finishing in a tie for 13th
with a 6-over 225. Junior Angela
Rho finished 18th at 8-over.
Stanford made its biggest move
on the final day of the tournament,
beginning Wednesday in seventh
before passing both Pacific-10
Conference rival UCLA and
Brigham Young. Much of the
credit for the strong finish belongs
to Husted, who shot a 1-under 72,
far and away her best round in
tournament play this season.
Junior teammate Kim
Kouwabunpat was not surprised
by Husted's performance
"Kelly has looked really good as
a freshman and will get a lot better
as she continues to adjust,"
Kouwabunpat said. "She's a great
competitor."
Southern California, which
dominated the tournament from
wire to wire, was the story of the
week. The Trojans won by a mar
gin of 15 strokes over host Wash
ington in second.
To appreciate USC's domi
nance, note that the Trojans boast
reigning U.S. Amateur champion
junior Becky Lucidi, but she wasn't
even their best player over the
three-day tournament. USC Ail-
American Mikaela Parmlid won a
one-hole playoff for medalist hon-

ors after carding a blistering 08.
"This is probably one of my best
rounds," Parmlid said. "1 had five
birdies and no bogeys. It was just a
solid round. I played with [individ
ual runner-up] Lindsey Wright
and she made seven birdies, so it
felt like match play out there be
tween us."
Amateur champion Becky Lu
cidi finished one shot behind, tied
with Pepperdine's Katherine Hull
at 4-under. Parmlid, Wright, Hull
and Lucidi were the only players to
break par in Tacoma, distancing
themselves from the rest of the
field by four shots.
As solid as Stanford's result was,
it could have easily been better as,
with the exception of USC, the
field was very closely grouped at
the top — only five shots separat
ed the Cardinal from second-place
Washington.
Also, though they both came
back on Wednesday with good
rounds, neither Kouwabunpat nor
sophomore Wendra Liang turned
in the kind of individual perfor
mances they are capable of.
They and the rest of the Cardi
nal will get a golden opportunity
next weekend, when the team
hosts the Stanford Pepsi Invita
tional at the Stanford Golf Course.
"The team has gotten off to
kind of a slow start," Kouwabun
pat said. "But I think a lot of that
has to do with our not having
played as much as some other
teams over the summer. But we
feel very confident that we'll con
tinue to improve and do very well
as the season goes on."

ors after carding a blistering 08.
"This is probably one of my best
rounds," Parmlid said. "1 had five
birdies and no bogeys. It was just a
solid round. I played with [individ
ual runner-up] Lindsey Wright
and she made seven birdies, so it
felt like match play out there be
tween us."
Amateur champion Becky Lu
cidi finished one shot behind, tied
with Pepperdine's Katherine Hull
at 4-under. Parmlid, Wright, Hull
and Lucidi were the only players to
break par in Tacoma, distancing
themselves from the rest of the
field by four shots.
As solid as Stanford's result was,
it could have easily been better as,
with the exception of USC, the
field was very closely grouped at
the top — only five shots separat
ed the Cardinal from second-place
Washington.
Also, though they both came
back on Wednesday with good
rounds, neither Kouwabunpat nor
sophomore Wendra Liang turned
in the kind of individual perfor
mances they are capable of.
They and the rest of the Cardi
nal will get a golden opportunity
next weekend, when the team
hosts the Stanford Pepsi Invita
tional at the Stanford Golf Course.
"The team has gotten off to
kind of a slow start," Kouwabun
pat said. "But I think a lot of that
has to do with our not having
played as much as some other
teams over the summer. But we
feel very confident that we'll con
tinue to improve and do very well
as the season goes on."
