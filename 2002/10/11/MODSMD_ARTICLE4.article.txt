# Teach-in to address war, Iraq
## 
### JEN GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Concerned that the public has not been sufficient
ly informed on the issues surrounding a potential
war with Iraq, the Peninsula Peace and Justice Cen
ter and several Stanford faculty, along with at least 12
campus student organizations and academic pro
grams, has organized a teach-in from 12:30 to 6:30
p.m. on Sunday.
Titled "War on Iraq? Exploring the Real Issues: A
Teach-in and Emergency Organizing Conference,"
the event aims to present students and community
members with critical information organizers say is
not available from either the Bush administration or
the national media.
"We try to keep an academic focus on [the teach
in] and really try to respond to what's coming from
the administration and the fact that most people rely
on televisions and newspapers to get their informa
tion. In this case it's absolutely insufficient," said
Paul George, director of the Peninsula Peace and
Justice Center.
A lot of the issues surrounding the potential war
have been "glossed over or straight-out lied about,"
George said.
The teach-in will consist of opening and closing
plenary sessions and two rounds, or "tracks," of work
shops, where attendees can choose to attend one of
five panels in each track.
Initially, Scott Ritter, a former United Nations
weapons inspector who has publicly challenged the
Bush administration's claim that Iraqi President Sad
dam Hussein has dangerous weapons of mass de
struction, was scheduled to give the opening plenary
address. However, Ritter had to back out of his con
tract to appear at the teach-in to consult with the pres
ident of South Africa and other leaders about the cur
rent situation with Iraq.

At presstime, organizers were uncertain of who
would replace Ritter, but potential options included
California Congresswoman Barbara Lee and USF
Assoc. Politics Prof. Stephen Zunes. The teach-in may
also feature MIT Linguistics Prof, and liberal activist
Noam Chomsky via telephone broadcast.
The teach-in will begin at 12:30 p.m. at Kresge Au
ditorium with an opening plenary session that fea
tures two speeches, one by Middle Eastern History
Prof. Joel Beinin titled "The Political Landscape of
the Middle East" and another by Ceorge titled "The
Political Landscape of the United States."
The event will then move to the History Corner in
the Quad, where the individual workshops will take
place — the first track from 2:30 to 3:45 p.m. and the
second from 4 to 5:15 p.m. Most workshops are of
fered during both tracks and include titles such as
"Iraq and the United States - History, Gulf War and
Sanctions," "U.S. Foreign Policy: Oil, Security Strate
gy and International Law," "Regional Repercussions"
and "Civil Liberties and Other Legal Issues." There
were also be a workshop dealing with protest and lob
bying strategies.
The closing plenary session will run from 5:30 to
6:30 p.m. where organizers hope that attendees will
synthesize information and formulate plans of action.
George said that plans to hold the teach-in got un
derway in August when he contacted Beinin about
the idea.
After quickly gaining support from other faculty,
including History Prof. David Como, numerous stu
dents and faculty have contributed to the event's or
ganization and have helped determine what issues
the teach-in will address.
The teach-in also is sponsored by the Program in
Modern Thought and Literature, the Program in
Ethics and Society, Students for Environmental Ac-
tion at Stanford, the Stanford
Community for Peace and Jus
tice, Castano House, the Asian
American Students Association,
the Black Graduate Student As
sociation, Redwood Action at
Stanford, the Muslim Student
Awareness Network, the
Women's Center, the Program in
Feminist Studies, the Philosophy
Department and the Stanford
Labor Action Coalition, in addi
tion to the Peninsula Peace and
Justice Center.
The success of a teach-in held
before the start of the Persian Gulf
War in 1990, which George de
scribed as a "very valuable pro

gram," was inceniive for the cur
rent teach-ins organizers to hold a
similar event.
While certain individuals and
groups sponsoring the teach-in
have been outspoken about their
opposition to war in Iraq, George
stressed that the teach-in was
aimed at providing information
and that anyone, regardless of
their beliefs on the potential war,
could benefit from the teach-in.
"We would encourage people
who are decided ... to show up
and see the full picture and then
make up their minds," he said.
Calvin Miaw, president of the
Stanford Community for Peace
and Justice, emphasized that
the teach-in is geared toward
students who already have
opinions but especially the
large number of Stanford stu

dents who are still uncertain of
their feelings on the issue.
"They can come in expecting to
hear a lot of viewpoints they
wouldn't normally hear in the
mainstream media," Miaw said.
"We've there to inform and pro
voke a critical [analysis]."
Miaw said that organizers ex
pect both members of the Stanford
community and the local commu
nity to attend.
"What I think you won't find
is a kind of ivory tower, contem
plative, abstract approach to
these issues," he said. "This is
going to be about discovering
about how we are positioned in
the world and how we have an
impact on the world and how the
world has an impact on us — 1
think that's going to lend a very
deep sense of urgency."

Calvin Miaw, president of the
Stanford Community for Peace
and Justice, emphasized that
the teach-in is geared toward
students who already have
opinions but especially the
large number of Stanford stu

dents who are still uncertain of
their feelings on the issue.
"They can come in expecting to
hear a lot of viewpoints they
wouldn't normally hear in the
mainstream media," Miaw said.
"We've there to inform and pro
voke a critical [analysis]."
Miaw said that organizers ex
pect both members of the Stanford
community and the local commu
nity to attend.
"What I think you won't find
is a kind of ivory tower, contem
plative, abstract approach to
these issues," he said. "This is
going to be about discovering
about how we are positioned in
the world and how we have an
impact on the world and how the
world has an impact on us — 1
think that's going to lend a very
deep sense of urgency."
Concerned that the public has not been sufficient
ly informed on the issues surrounding a potential
war with Iraq, the Peninsula Peace and Justice Cen
ter and several Stanford faculty, along with at least 12
campus student organizations and academic pro
grams, has organized a teach-in from 12:30 to 6:30
p.m. on Sunday.
Titled "War on Iraq? Exploring the Real Issues: A
Teach-in and Emergency Organizing Conference,"
the event aims to present students and community
members with critical information organizers say is
not available from either the Bush administration or
the national media.
"We try to keep an academic focus on [the teach
in] and really try to respond to what's coming from
the administration and the fact that most people rely
on televisions and newspapers to get their informa
tion. In this case it's absolutely insufficient," said
Paul George, director of the Peninsula Peace and
Justice Center.
A lot of the issues surrounding the potential war
have been "glossed over or straight-out lied about,"
George said.
The teach-in will consist of opening and closing
plenary sessions and two rounds, or "tracks," of work
shops, where attendees can choose to attend one of
five panels in each track.
Initially, Scott Ritter, a former United Nations
weapons inspector who has publicly challenged the
Bush administration's claim that Iraqi President Sad
dam Hussein has dangerous weapons of mass de
struction, was scheduled to give the opening plenary
address. However, Ritter had to back out of his con
tract to appear at the teach-in to consult with the pres
ident of South Africa and other leaders about the cur
rent situation with Iraq.

At presstime, organizers were uncertain of who
would replace Ritter, but potential options included
California Congresswoman Barbara Lee and USF
Assoc. Politics Prof. Stephen Zunes. The teach-in may
also feature MIT Linguistics Prof, and liberal activist
Noam Chomsky via telephone broadcast.
The teach-in will begin at 12:30 p.m. at Kresge Au
ditorium with an opening plenary session that fea
tures two speeches, one by Middle Eastern History
Prof. Joel Beinin titled "The Political Landscape of
the Middle East" and another by Ceorge titled "The
Political Landscape of the United States."
The event will then move to the History Corner in
the Quad, where the individual workshops will take
place — the first track from 2:30 to 3:45 p.m. and the
second from 4 to 5:15 p.m. Most workshops are of
fered during both tracks and include titles such as
"Iraq and the United States - History, Gulf War and
Sanctions," "U.S. Foreign Policy: Oil, Security Strate
gy and International Law," "Regional Repercussions"
and "Civil Liberties and Other Legal Issues." There
were also be a workshop dealing with protest and lob
bying strategies.
The closing plenary session will run from 5:30 to
6:30 p.m. where organizers hope that attendees will
synthesize information and formulate plans of action.
George said that plans to hold the teach-in got un
derway in August when he contacted Beinin about
the idea.
After quickly gaining support from other faculty,
including History Prof. David Como, numerous stu
dents and faculty have contributed to the event's or
ganization and have helped determine what issues
the teach-in will address.
The teach-in also is sponsored by the Program in
Modern Thought and Literature, the Program in
Ethics and Society, Students for Environmental Ac-
tion at Stanford, the Stanford
Community for Peace and Jus
tice, Castano House, the Asian
American Students Association,
the Black Graduate Student As
sociation, Redwood Action at
Stanford, the Muslim Student
Awareness Network, the
Women's Center, the Program in
Feminist Studies, the Philosophy
Department and the Stanford
Labor Action Coalition, in addi
tion to the Peninsula Peace and
Justice Center.
The success of a teach-in held
before the start of the Persian Gulf
War in 1990, which George de
scribed as a "very valuable pro

gram," was inceniive for the cur
rent teach-ins organizers to hold a
similar event.
While certain individuals and
groups sponsoring the teach-in
have been outspoken about their
opposition to war in Iraq, George
stressed that the teach-in was
aimed at providing information
and that anyone, regardless of
their beliefs on the potential war,
could benefit from the teach-in.
"We would encourage people
who are decided ... to show up
and see the full picture and then
make up their minds," he said.
