# Hospital workers, students protest as talks continue
## 
### ERIC ELDON 
Chanting slogans such as, "What's this all about? Pa
tient Care!", union workers and students picketed in a
circle for four hours outside of the Stanford Hospital
yesterday afternoon in support of changes they have
been advocating to the new union contract currently
under negotiation.
This is the latest action by union SEIU Local 715 in
its campaign to improve conditions for workers at the
Hospital. The union represents approximately 1,400
workers, including nursing assistants, unit secretaries
and other support staff who are not medically licensed.
"Workers at the Hospital were only unionized in
1999, and the contracts that they've got still do not com
pare with workers' contracts at almost all other hospitals
in the area," said Danielle Mahones, a union spokesper
son present at the picket yesterday. "But each year we
try to negotiate fora better one."
Mahones added that "While Stanford Hospital is one
of the best hospitals in the country, they rank near the
bottom of the wage scale."
Robert Dicks, media relations manager for the Lu
cille Packard Children's Hospital, which is involved in
the negotiations, said in a phone interview last night that
"We respect the right of the union to demonstrate as
long as it does not interfere with patient care. We also
hope that the new agreement is satisfactory for all par
ties involved."
"With each negotiation, progress is made — but we
cannot comment on the specifics of the negotiations at
this time," he added.
Several Stanford Labor Action Coalition members
participated in the picket on behalf of the workers.
"As part of our campaign for the code of conduct on
campus, we support the actions of the union at the hos
pital," said coalition member Clara Webb.
Union workers were vocal about the issues they felt
were important. Lourdes Arafiles, a unit secretary in the
cardiovascular unit, and a first-generation immigrant
from the Philippines, found her experiences at the Stan
ford Hospital to be more difficult than when she was

working in her home country at the University of the
Philippines.
"We are a poor country," she said, "but we know how
to respect even the janitors."
At the Hospital, Arafiles felt, numerous problems
exist between the management and the non-licensed
support workers.
"Sometimes they act like we don't even exist", she
said. "Even in the negotiations, they seem arrogant.

One negotiator told us that 'We
don't like unlicensed people to run
the Hospital.'"
Arafiles said that she and other
long-time employees have been es
pecially angered by the pay system
currently in use.
"We train newly hired people for
the same positions as ourselves, and

then we find out that they are get
ting paid more than us. The Hospi
tal doesn't like to acknowledge
length of service."
Arafiles and other union mem
bers at the picket felt that they were
a necessary part of providing high
quality care at the Hospital: "If you
want an institution with high-quali
ty care, you should be respectful
and listen to all members of the
team, even janitors", she said.

Nov. 4.
