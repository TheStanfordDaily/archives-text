# Weekend transportation becomes a challenge when
## Caltrain Closes 
### CARLY GEEHR 
Until recently, the Caltrain was
the easiest, cheapest and most effi
cient way for Stanford students to
travel to San Francisco. Since the
weekend service shut down on July
6, however, getting to the city via
public transportation has become
considerably more difficult, partic
ularly for the car-less freshmen.
In lieu of the temporarily elimi
nated weekend service, a substitute
weekend bus route has been instat
ed, in addition to three express
baseball routes for weekend games
at Pacific Bell Park.
Most students agree that the
substitution is inadequate at best.

The main bus route, Route
RRX, makes only four stops be
tween San Jose and San Francisco
and offers a far less convenient
schedule than Caltrain's usual
weekday service. The weekend
buses begin their last run at 8 p.m.
Nicole Nicholas, a freshman
who was recently stranded in San
Francisco by the early-departing
buses, said that "if Caltrain is dis
continuing its weekend service, an
equivalent alternative should be
provided." Along with many other
students, she feels that the buses do
not provide weekend commuters
with adequate means of trans
portation to and from the city.
"The buses take a lot longer

than Caltrain, are less conve
nient and cost just as much,"
Nicholas said.
If the buses faifTifpkwtde sat
isfactory transit to the city, stu
dents have three options. They
can use the replacement bus sys
tem, find another means of trans
portation or just avoid going into
the city completely.
Many freshmen are choosing
the latter option in order to avoid
dealing with inconvenient bus
schedules and unnecessary hassles.
"It's definitely a deterrent from
going into the city," said freshman
Colleen Fenand-Andrew. "I'd love
to spend a day of the weekend in
San Francisco, but I don't really
know how it could work."
Prohibited 112 rom having cars by
the University, the Stanford class
of 2006 is feeling the brunt of the
weekend service shutdowns.
Many freshmen want to explore
the city, as its proximity was a key
selling point for some in coming
to Stanford, but they now find
themselves sorely disappointed at
its inaccessibility.
"I was really hoping to be able
to get to know the city and go into
it on weekends," freshman Nicole
Schuetz said. "I don't want to

waste three hours traveling back
and forth if I'm only going to be
able to spend a few hours in the
city anyway."
What was once about an hour
commute now takes nearly twice
that, and most students don't have
the luxury of spending that extra
time on buses to the city.
The Citizens Advisory Commit
tee decided last November to em
bark on the 22-month, $110 mil
lion project to expand and im
prove Caltrain's service. The pur
pose of the shutdown is to give the
contractor in charge of the im
provement project the largest win
dow possible in which to complete
the construction.
According to Caltrain Public In
formation Officer Jayme Maltbie,
the weekend shutdowns maximize
the efficiency of the project and

also reduce disturbance for resi
dents who live near the construc
tion sites.
"The project will take less time,
and it can be completed more effi
ciently, reducing cost," explained
Maltbie. As for the replacement
buses, Maltbie said that their pur
pose is merely to "supplement local
transportation already available."
Until the project's anticipated
completion in mid-2004, students
without cars will be faced with the
same dilemma when traveling to
the city on the weekend: whether
to brave the buses or to avoid
going altogether.
For some, during the next cou
ple of years, San Francisco will be
just out of reach.
