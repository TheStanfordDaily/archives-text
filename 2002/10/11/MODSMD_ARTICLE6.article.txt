# Weekend transportation becomes a challenge when
## Caltrain Closes 
### CARLY GEEHR 
Until recently, the Caltrain was
the easiest, cheapest and most effi
cient way for Stanford students to
travel to San Francisco. Since the
weekend service shut down on July
6, however, getting to the city via
public transportation has become
considerably more difficult, partic
ularly for the car-less freshmen.
In lieu of the temporarily elimi
nated weekend service, a substitute
weekend bus route has been instat
ed, in addition to three express
baseball routes for weekend games
at Pacific Bell Park.
Most students agree that the
substitution is inadequate at best.

The main bus route, Route
RRX, makes only four stops be
tween San Jose and San Francisco
and offers a far less convenient
schedule than Caltrain's usual
weekday service. The weekend
buses begin their last run at 8 p.m.
Nicole Nicholas, a freshman
who was recently stranded in San
Francisco by the early-departing
buses, said that "if Caltrain is dis
continuing its weekend service, an
equivalent alternative should be
provided." Along with many other
students, she feels that the buses do
not provide weekend commuters
with adequate means of trans
portation to and from the city.
"The buses take a lot longer

than Caltrain, are less conve
nient and cost just as much,"
Nicholas said.
If the buses faifTifpkwtde sat
isfactory transit to the city, stu
dents have three options. They
can use the replacement bus sys
tem, find another means of trans
portation or just avoid going into
the city completely.
Many freshmen are choosing
the latter option in order to avoid
dealing with inconvenient bus
schedules and unnecessary hassles.
"It's definitely a deterrent from
going into the city," said freshman
