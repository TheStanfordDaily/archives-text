The Faculty Senate held the first meet
ing of its 35th year yesterday afternoon.
During the meeting, President John Hen
nessy presented the University's new liv
ing-wage policy to the senate. In addition,
Provost John Ftchemendy announced
that Pamela Matson, a professor in the De
partment of Geological and Environmen
tal Sciences and a member of the Institute
for International Studies, had been
named the new dean of the School of
Earth Sciences.
Also during the meeting, Law Prof.
Henry Greely, the new senate chair, gave
a speech describing his goals for the sen

ate, and he introduced two new adminis
trators: Vice President for Public Affairs
Gordon Earle and Dean of Freshmen and
Transfer Students Julie Lythcott-Haims.
Lythcott-Haims said that in addition to
helping new arrivals adjust to Stanford
life, she would work hard to reduce drink
ing on campus.
The first meeting of the senate was ac
tually scheduled for Sept. 26, but it was
canceled due to the lack of an agenda and
the fact that many senate members were
not yet on campus. Following the confer

favor of the recommended media poli

was a memorial resolution and moment of
silence for Steven Chaffee, the Janet M.
Peck Professor of International Commu
nication Emeritus, who died on May 15 of
last year.
Greely then gave his report as chair of
the Steering Committee and also took the

opportunity to discuss what he hoped the
senate would accomplish in the coining
year.
"When I returned to Stanford in 1985
as a professor of law, my first impression
was that the senate was like the high school
student government — its main purpose
was to keep the brighter, more ambitious
students busy," he said. "I soon discovered
that I could not have been more wrong."
Greely said that he saw the senate as
serving four important roles: reminding
the faculty that it had an important and le
gitimate role in the governance of the
University, discharging duties such as re
viewing degrees and approving interdisci
plinary programs, leading discussions 011
important issues over which it had no ju
risdiction and helping faculty see that they
are members of a larger community.
In his report to the senate, Hennessy
made two announcements. He first pre-
