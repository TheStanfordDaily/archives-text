### ANTHONY HA EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Faculty Senate held the first meet
ing of its 35th year yesterday afternoon.
During the meeting, President John Hen
nessy presented the University's new liv
ing-wage policy to the senate. In addition,
Provost John Ftchemendy announced
that Pamela Matson, a professor in the De
partment of Geological and Environmen
tal Sciences and a member of the Institute
for International Studies, had been
named the new dean of the School of
Earth Sciences.
Also during the meeting, Law Prof.
Henry Greely, the new senate chair, gave
a speech describing his goals for the sen

ate, and he introduced two new adminis
trators: Vice President for Public Affairs
Gordon Earle and Dean of Freshmen and
Transfer Students Julie Lythcott-Haims.
Lythcott-Haims said that in addition to
helping new arrivals adjust to Stanford
life, she would work hard to reduce drink
ing on campus.
The first meeting of the senate was ac
tually scheduled for Sept. 26, but it was
canceled due to the lack of an agenda and
the fact that many senate members were
not yet on campus. Following the confer
ral of degrees and a unanimous vote in
favor of the recommended media poli
cy — which has remained relatively un
changed in the last eight years — there
was a memorial resolution and moment of
silence for Steven Chaffee, the Janet M.
Peck Professor of International Commu
nication Emeritus, who died on May 15 of
last year.
Greely then gave his report as chair of
the Steering Committee and also took the

opportunity to discuss what he hoped the
senate would accomplish in the coining
year.
"When I returned to Stanford in 1985
as a professor of law, my first impression
was that the senate was like the high school
student government — its main purpose
was to keep the brighter, more ambitious
students busy," he said. "I soon discovered
that I could not have been more wrong."
Greely said that he saw the senate as
serving four important roles: reminding
the faculty that it had an important and le
gitimate role in the governance of the
University, discharging duties such as re
viewing degrees and approving interdisci
plinary programs, leading discussions 011
important issues over which it had no ju
risdiction and helping faculty see that they
are members of a larger community.
In his report to the senate, Hennessy
made two announcements. He first pre-

sented the University's new living
wage policy, which involves paying
workers a minimum of $10.10 per
hour with health benefits or $11.35
per hour without benefits. He said
that the policy was based largely on
a living-wage law in San Jose.
Eamonn Callan, a professor of
education, asked the president to
supply more information so that
the faculty could give feedback
on the policy.
"It's difficult to give input in ab
sence of more information about
the reasons behind this policy," he
said. "I encourage you to supply
that detail."
Blake Naughton, the ASSU
Representative At Large, also ques
tioned the policy.
"There are two key concerns of
the student body," Naughton said.
"The first is the process involved in
drafting the policy, a process that
did not include the workers who
will be affected.

"The second is with the product
of the policy. It doesn't apply to
people in unions, temp workers or
hospital workers. These are people
to whom the policy should apply,
but for reasons beyond my naive
understanding, it doesn't. Also,
there is no mechanism in the policy
to deal with inflation," he said.
Thomas Macurdy, a professor
of economics, responded, "The
San Jose living wage was fairly ar
bitrary. If we're going to seriously
discuss a living wage, then it
would need to be different for
each worker depending on their
family situation .. . Also, I think
that there needs to be a discussion
of what we are foregoing in order
to have this policy."
"There were many issues be
hind the living-wage policy," Hen
nessy said as he addressed the con
cerns. "Its intention is to be a safe
ty net, so that subcontractors on
campus meet a basic standard.
That's all it is."
The living wage is currently
being enforced by the University,
but it will only apply to several of the
subcontractors paid by the Univer

sity after their contracts are renego
tiated.
Hennessy also announced that,
due to a donation from Robert and
Anne Bass, the University would be
appointing eight professors to the
position of Bass University Fellow
for Undergraduate Education.
In his report, Etchemendy an
nounced t he appointment of Mat
son as Dean of Earth Sciences.
She is succeeding Franklin M.
Orr, Jr., and will begin to work as
dean on Dec. 1.
After an open forum period,
Greely introduced Earle, whose
duties will include government
communications, University com
munications and lively arts and spe
cial events.
"My mission is to strengthen ties
to the community, get out the posi
tive news about Stanford and to
help with public outreach in the
neighboring community," Earle
said. "It's my job to protect the Uni
versity's reputation."
Lythcott-Maims also spoke to the
senate about her position.
"I have an office — a small of
fice — where students can come

and hear, 'We are here for you,' "
she said. "Myjob is to make the rest
of the first-year experience — the
non-academic part — not get in
the way."
Lythcott-Haims noted that
there have been many changes
since she was an undergraduate at
Stanford 16 years ago, including
the level of drinking.
"I was truly shocked at the
amount of drinking among under
graduates," she said. "I don't have
any solutions, but I'm going to
work to examine the situation. We
need to be presenting students
with alternatives so that they don't
feel the need to go to frat parties
and get drunk."
When the meeting ended,
ASSU President Monica Hene
stroza, a senior echoed Callan's re
quest that Hennessy provide more
information about the formulation
of the living wage.
"Fhe policy of the ASSU is not to
comment officially and to allow
other organizations to comment,"
she said. "But it would be a good
first step to provide more informa
tion to students."
