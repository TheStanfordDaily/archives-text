# Bursar retires after 30 years of service
## 
### MORGAN SPRINGER 
After over 30 years as a popular University
staff member and 18 years of serving as the bur
sar, Jon Krickson is leaving Stanford. The move
comes during a restructuring operation in the
controller's office and aims to eliminate both
t he position and office of bursar and replace it
with a new office of student financial services.
The official word is that Krickson chose
to retire.
"He's been here fora long time, he's a great
guy, he's just ready to retire. I think he's going
to do other things," said University Controller
Susan Calandra. "He will be missed, and we
wish him well in retirement."
Others aren't so certain that the choice was
solely Krickson's. Huy Son, who works with Kr
ickson on both the Axe Committee and Flicks,
said, "I get the feeling that they want to phase
out the whole concept of bursar."
In fact, the position of the bursar will now be
eliminated, and the new student financial ser
vices office will be headed by Assoc . Controller

Allison Baird-James. According to Krickson, this
reflects a change going on across the country, as
Harvard, Columbia and the University of Penn
sylvania have all removed the bursar position.
"There are some new directions that are
being taken in the office," Krickson said.
"There are a lot of other systems that are com
ing up now that won't impact most students,
but for those of us in the internal infernal bu
reaucracy, we get impacted. I'm eligible for re
tirement, so why put up with it?"
Besides his role as bursar, Krickson, a grad
uate of the class of '65, has been involved in nu
merous Stanford traditions. He serves as advi
sor to the Axe Committee and has worked with
the organization since it was founded. He also
works as an academic advisor, shares the duty
of cranking the clock tower, helps with Flicks
and is involved with the athletics department.
Krickson plans on continuing his involve
ment in these roles. He is also a licensed py
rotechnician and will continue to put on fire
works shows both on campus and around the
Bay Area.

Erickson is well-liked and respected by many
students.
"He's quite a character if you get to know
him," said Son, who attended Erickson's retire
ment party.
Said Axe Committee Chief Jatzin Alvarado,
"Jon is really devoted to whatever he does. It's
a pleasure working with him â€” he's so helpful,
and he's always willing to guide you."
While he doesn't regret giving up the ad
ministrative aspect of his job, Erickson said he
did enjoy the customer service.
"I'm really going to miss the contact with
the students and the families, trying to work
through to some financial solutions," he
said. "That's where I've gotten all of the per
sonal rewards."
As far as any further official staff positions at
Stanford, Erickson rules nothing out.
"Right now today I'm retiring completely,
but there are a lot of things out there that are of
interest. Don't be surprised if you see me
around campus in some other role at some
point," he said.
