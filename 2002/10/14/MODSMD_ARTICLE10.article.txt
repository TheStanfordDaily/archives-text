# Pres. Bush calls bombing in Indonesia 'heinous act of terrorism'

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Presi
dent Bush said a car bombing in
Indonesia that killed at least 187
people — including at least two
Americans — was a heinous act of
terrorism, and he resolved yester
day to fight "this global menace."
The State Department ordered
U.S. government personnel in
nonessential positions and all family
members to leave the Southeast
Asian country. I he department also
advised all U.S. citizens to defer trav

el to Indonesia, and advised Ameri
cans now living there to leave.
The bombing Saturday, on the
second anniversary of the al-
Qaida-linked attack against the de
stroyer USS Cole off Yemen that
killed 17 sailors, led the Bush ad
ministration to evaluate its own ol
ficial presence in the world's
largest Muslim country. The State
Department had warned last week
that Indonesia was becoming a
home to terrorists.

There was no immediate claim
of responsibility for the bomb that
ripped through a nightclub
packed with foreign tourists on the
vacation island of Bali.
State Department spokes
woman Jo-Anne Prokopowicz
said Sunday night that at least
two Americans were killed and
three injured. She was not able to
release the names or details of
these individuals.
"There are ongoing efforts to

identify other possible victims,"
Prokopowicz said. "We are not
able to confirm any other Ameri
can casualties at this point.
" These incidents are under in
vestigation. I don't want to spec
ulate about possible perpetra
tors, motivations or connec
tions," she said.
Indonesian officials said it was
the island nation's worst terrorist
ac t ever. Bush's statement did not
mention the al-Qaida network or

any other terrorist group by name,
but he said the attack was"a cow
ardly act designed to create terror
and c haos."
"On behalf of the people of the
United States, I condemn this
heinous act," the president said.
"'The world must confront this
global menace, terrorism," Bush
said. "We must together chal
lenge and defeat the idea that the
wanton killing of innocents ad
vances any cause or supports any

aspirations. And we must call this
despicable act by its rightful
name: murder."
After an early morning church
service, Bush was asked if he had
said a prayer for victims of the at
tack. "Every clay," he replied.
Bush said the United States has
offered Indonesia assistance "to
help bring these murderers to jus
tice," and a senior White House of
ficial said U.S. investigators al
ready were at the scene.
