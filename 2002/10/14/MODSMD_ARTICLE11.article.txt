## The 						Stanford Daily Sigma Chi deserves punishment for violation 
### 
Many people would agree with the
statement, "Orientation week
end should be dry." Orientation
is a time for new students to ac
climate themselves to campus life without
the added social pressures that are usually
associated with alcohol.
The Office of the Dean of Students placed
the Sigma Chi fraternity on alcohol suspen
sion two weeks ago, for allegedly serving al
cohol during Orientation weekend. Al
though Sigma Chi has not officially been
placed on probation (it is suspended until
the Judicial Board meets and makes a final
judgement), if allegations surrounding the
party are confirmed, the organization
should be punished.
Some wonder whether Sigma Chi in fact
deserves to be placed on alcohol probation.
Fraternity members say that the party was
not a Sigma Chi sponsored event and that a
large contingent of the fraternity had not
even returned to campus. "Why should the

Published Since 1891

entire chapter be punished for the actions of
a few?" some ask.
We believe that when violations are made
within an organization's house or at an es
tablished meeting place, the organization be
comes responsible for that event.
Let's face it, the alcohol policy at Stanford
is extremely lenient. Regarding Orientation,
it states, "At no time should any Stanford stu
dent provide, serve or in any way have alco
hol available to any new undergraduate stu
dent." The rule essentially says, "Stay away
from freshmen during Orientation week
end." Nowhere does that statement say that
providing alcohol to minors should at all
times be avoided.
We urge students and organizations to
abide by the current policy because repeated
offenses could lead the University to make its
current policy more stringent.
It doesn't seem that the University's alco
hol policy attempts to regulate all underage
drinking on campus. In fact, relative toother

campus's policies, Stanford's alcohol policy
takes into account the genuine sentiment of
many students here — which is that, al
though we're not all quite legal, drinking is
all right if handled responsibly. Residential
Education seems to echo this reasoning
through its continued support of in-house
programs targeted towards freshmen about
"safe drinking."
Because of the continued leniency by the
University, we feel that a stricter policy dur
ing Orientation weekend is not only fair, but
also necessary. Consequently, Sigma Chi's
disregard for the policy warrants disciplinary
action.
Whether non-Greeks want to admit it or
not, we depend heavily on the housed-Greek
organizations for social interactions. Main
stream parties are usually provided by these
institutions and are one reason that the Uni
versity allows them special housing options.

housing, whether ethnic-focused, language-

centered or Greek, is contingent upon its
ability to bring something different to cam
pus life.
That said, the Stanford community has a
right to be disheartened by the alcohol sus
pension that several fraternities have been on
in the past few years. In a sense, many non-
Greeks "forfeit" prime housing with the idea
that Greeks are filling a vital social role
through their ability to draw into fraternity
houses.
The existence of Sigma Chi on the Row,
and the fact that it will soon be joined by
Sigma Nu, limits prime housing options for
all females and for any male who is not inter
ested in pledging a fraternity. Therefore, if
the fraternities cannot obey the rules, stay off
alcohol suspension and throw parties, why
should other students have less of an oppor
tunity to live in a Row house?
It's unfortunate that Sigma Chi didn't heed
the Unversity's policy. Hopefully, in the fu
ture, it and other similar organizations will.
