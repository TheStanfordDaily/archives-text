# 21 AND STILL CLUELESS
## Memo to undergrads: Find a new Santa Claus 
### 
Four weeks ago, I arrived on
campus for fall quarter for the
fourth and hopefully last time in
my life. Aside from the usual
generalized anxiety that accompanies
the start of classes, I've been feeling old
and wise (01 maybe just old). I have an
uncontrollable urge to pass advice on to
future generations. There are worse
ways to warp the minds of young, unsus
pecting frosh.
For you young whippersnappers who

have no idea what you're
doing after you gradu
ate, read on (The rest of
y'all can clip this column,
save it and read it when
you drop out of Chem
35).
First of all, don't sweat
the feeling of dread that
you're not smart enough to

be here. It goesaway. Second ofall, never,ever
download Snood (http://www.snood.com/).
Third ofall, find a better Santa Claus.
Many of us spent our early childhood
thinking that if we were especially good,
we would get presents. It's a pretty basic
first lesson in cause and effect: Actions
have consequences. Which may or may
not explain why people put their trash in
the halls expecting it to magically disap
pear overnight.
Eventually, we learn that there is no
Santa Claus (or equally attractive non-reli
gious alms bearer), but the lesson sticks.
We want presents. We do things to get pre
sents. Santa Claus lives on, not unlike Elvis
and Strom Thurmond.
Fora lot of us, our Santa Claus was Stan
ford (or another equally attractive non-Ivy
League university). I know I wouldn't
have bothered to plod through my public
high -school personal hell, if it weren't for
the glimmer of a promise that the brand

new world of college was going to sweep
me away.
Well, now you're here. You got in.
Christmas has come and gone, and the
tree is still up, only now all the needles
have fallen off, and the trunk is starting to
smell. My little brothers and sisters, what
do you want next Christmas?
1 came to Stanford thinking that I
would "find myself" during my four years
here. So far, it has more or less turned out
to be true. I think (Ask me again in eight
months, when I'm out of school and un
employed).
But I had this naive idea that my next
Santa Claus was going to come to me, that
it was going to come knock on my door or
swoop down my chimney. I didn't want to
start planning for next Christmas because
I figured that it would work itself out on its
own. Let me tell you something: Life
doesn't come to you. You have to meet it
halfway.
I'm not saying you should blindly fol
low the path of least resistance into law
school, or tried school or B-school (God
have mercy on your soul). I would highly
recommend taking a long, hard look at
where you want to be in five years. Ask
yourself where you stand right now. Do
you still want to be standing there a year
from now? If not, then where? I low are
you going to get there?
Plans change. The future is uncertain.
But how else are you going to know that
you've changed your mind unless you
make up your mind in the first place?
You're on a journey of a thousand miles,
my friend. Take a step. Then another one.
Repeat.
