Professors should 'inspire us to think'
I'm not sure if Daniel Wichs' letter is a
suitable defense for Campus Watch ("Edi
torial 'misrepresents' Campus Watch,"
Oct. 10). He asserts that Campus Watch
has served the Stanford community by
pinpointing [History Prof.] Joel Beinin's
misuse of academic facilities. I do not know
Prof. Beinin, nor have I taken a course
with him, but even I can say that Wichs' al
legations remain unsubstantiated.
For one, he accuses the History De
partment and Prof. Beinin of funding a
political protest in the guise of a memorial
for Al Nakba and claims that this had "no
academic value whatsoever." In one
sweeping statement, Wichs labels an im
portant event in the history of the Pales
tinians as having "no academic value
whatsoever." Surely, regardless of one's
political views, one would say that the cre
ation of Israel has a unique position in
Jewish history; one must also say that the
displacement of Palestinians and the cre
ation of a diaspora has a unique place in
Palestinian history. These are facts, not
moral judgements.
And it can never he denied that both
Jewish and Palestinian blood was spilled
during that time. By enunciating the
names of villages lost, the event brought
out the history of the Palestinians — facts,
once more, not values. I, for one, applaud
the History Department for its move. As

students, and as educated (and privileged)
human beings, how can we ignore each
others' history and term it of little aca
demic import?
I agree with Wichs that Campus Watch
has the right to comment upon academic
work — guarding freedom of expression
is always essential — but at the same time,
are we to have passionless professors who
have no moral standpoints on the Middle
East? The role of a professor is not to teach
us what to think, but to inspire us to think.
If Prof. Beinin uses his position to prevent
individuals from disagreeing with him, I
will be (he first to protest his actions; but if
his passion leads other students to search
for what they believe is true, I will com
mend him for believing in something.
In the end, we go to Green Library for
objective truth. To our professors, we go
for inspiration and passion.

Hudson's arguments 'more flawed'
than anti-war stance
William Hudson's arguments are far
more Hawed than those of the anti-war
movement ("Anti-war stance is flawed," Oct.
11). First of all, we should finish the war on
terror before going after a secular regime
tliiii is one of al-Qaida's natural targets. In

addition, Saddam Hussein lias been con
tained for the last several years; there is no
reason to think lie will move anytime soon.
As for Hudson's argument that we
should act to protect the people of the
Middle East, since when is the United
States the world's policeman? The people
of Iraq hate us more than they hate Sad
dam, and there is no indication that ei
ther Iran or Kuwait are particularly wor
ried about being targeted by Iraqi
weapons of mass destruction. In any case,
the use of such weapons would make
Saddam's guilt clear and inspire the rest
of the world to unite against him, so we
can probably count on his sense of self
preservation to keep those weapons (if lie
has them) in storage.
Furthermore, what the hawks try to ig
nore is the precedent that would be set by
our preemptive strike. If we can invade a
country because we think it may attack us
at some point, we implicitly allow other
countries to do so. Russia has been ex
pressing an interest in preemptively invad
ing Georgia, while the possibilities in India
and Pakistan boggle the mind. Heck, the
"Bush Doctrine" even gives Saddam an ex
cuse to preemptively attack us; after all,
Congress just voted to allow an invasion. In
short, the drawbacks of allowing preemp
tive strikes far outweigh the benefits.

can probably count on his sense of self
preservation to keep those weapons (if lie
has them) in storage.
Furthermore, what the hawks try to ig
nore is the precedent that would be set by
our preemptive strike. If we can invade a
country because we think it may attack us
at some point, we implicitly allow other
countries to do so. Russia has been ex
pressing an interest in preemptively invad
ing Georgia, while the possibilities in India
and Pakistan boggle the mind. Heck, the
"Bush Doctrine" even gives Saddam an ex
cuse to preemptively attack us; after all,
Congress just voted to allow an invasion. In
short, the drawbacks of allowing preemp
tive strikes far outweigh the benefits.
