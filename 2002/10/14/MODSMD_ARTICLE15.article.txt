### MICHELLE KELLER EDITORIAL STAFF 
On Friday afternoon in HI Cen
troChicano, the Stanford commu
nity had the opportunity to view a
showing of the work of photogra
pher Tom Van Dyke and listen to
the story of how more than a third
of the population from a small
town in Mexico moved to Red
wood City, California.
1 he show, formally named
"Living in Two Worlds," was or
ganized by Jim Burklo, the
Protestant campus minister, and
by the staff of El Cent 10 Chicano.
Van Dyke's framed photographs
are now part of El Centro Chi
cano's collections and efforts are
underway to display them in
venues around the Bay Area in
order to spread awareness of the
roots of many Mexicans living in
Redwood ( aty.
At the event, students gazed at
the photographs and listened to
San Jose Mercury News reporter
Edwin Garcia recount the story of
the immigration phenomenon.
The rural town of Aguililla, Mi
choacan in Mexico is home to
25,000 people, but has a popula
tion of about 10,000 people who
live in Redwood City part of the
year and return for die holidays to
see relatives.
According to Garcia's article
on Aguililla, the influence of Red
wood City is so great in this small
town that "teenagers wear the lat
est style in clothes purchased by
cousins in Redwood City. Van
dals spraypaint 'RWC' tags on
blank walls."
The influence of this small town
is also evident in Redwood City.
"In small restaurants along one
stretch of Middlefield Road known
as 'Little Aguililla,' diners can re
quest that mariachis play their fa
vorite rancheras," wrote Garcia.
Garcia said he became in
trigued in investigating this impor
tant link between Redwood City
and Aguililla when he began to no
tice that many people around the
Bay Area came from one specific
Mexican state, Michoacan — the

state in which Aguililla is located —
and many still had relatives in
Mexico. A little more investigative
work led him to the conclusion
that Aguililla, this tiny rural town,
had a significant population in
Redwood City.
When he went to this small
rural town, he noticed that "no
matter where [photographer Tom
Van Dyke and I] went, Redwood
City was everywhere."
Campus minister Burklo said
he became interested in showcas
ing Van Dyke's photographs and
having Garcia speak when he
learned of the connection between
Aguililla and Redwood City.
"1 remember going to Menlo
Atherton School with [Van Dyke]
and asking the kids how many had
relatives in Michoacan. When
nearly every hand went up, and
kids looked around in surprise, re
alizing that they all had roots in the
same area, I knew that this was an
important topic to educate people

about," Burklo said.
Burklo first met Van Dyke sev
eral years ago when he took a
group of Russian students on a
"Reality Check" tour of East Palo
Alto — a tour he makes regularly
with members of the Stanford
community to educate them about
the difficulties people face in this
impoverished area — and Van
Dyke came along to take pho
tographs fora story he was doing
for the San Jose Mercury News.
"I was telling the Russian stu
dents about the connection be
tween Aguililla and the Bay Area
when Van Dyke suddenly said
'I've been to Aguililla!' 1 was so sur
prised — I mean, no one goes to
Aguililla — it's in the middle of
nowhere! We started talking, and 1
realized how important it would be
for him to show his photographs at
Stanford to tell this story."
Students munched on conchas
and cuernitos, Mexican sweet
breads, while enjoying the show.

Many left impressed with the pre
sentation, saying they felt more
aware of the roots of people in
their community.
"The photos are really captivat
ing in themselves," said sopho
more Wendy Salazar. "They are so
similar to so many rural towns in
Michoacan. The really recreate the
story of this whole pueblilo."
Sophomore Laura Avina, pro
gram coordinator for El Centro
Chicano, said she was excited
about the show and pleased that it
had all come together. She worked
with Bnrklo to bring the show to
Stanford and said she shared his
passion for spreading awareness
about this immigration trend.
"I think that it is very impor
tant to present this show to Stan
ford students, to get them think
ing about the roots of a lot of
Mexicans who work here at Stan
ford," said Avina.
