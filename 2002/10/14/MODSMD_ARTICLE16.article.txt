# Ecstasy harmful even on first use

### SUPRIA RENADE THE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER 
(U-WIRE) BALTIMORE â€”
For some people, it is known as
happiness in a pill. Toothers, it is
a harmful, habit-forming drug.
Met h ylenedioxy met h am
phetamine, commonly known as
Ecstasy or E, has been primarily
taken in the urban club and rave
scene. But according to recent
studies, MDMA usage is branch
ing out to suburban house par
ties and college campuses. With
this increase in acceptance of the
drug, the National Institute on
Drug Abuse has found that ec
stasy usage has doubled among
teens since 1995 and that one in
10 teens has experimented with
the drug.
In fact, the appeal of the drug
has been growing ever since its
national recognition by the U.S.
Drug Enforcement agency in
1985. A portion of the rave and
nightclub cultures embrace the
drug as one of its central compo
nents, and some users conse
quently indulge in its usage to
feel the "vibe."
According to a study done
by The Washington Post, ecsta
sy functions by stimulating
neurons to secrete large
amounts of serotonin, a neuro
transmitter that is involved in
the behavioral aspect of the
human body. Serotonin is also
the target of some common
prescription antidepressants.
The health risks involved
with Ecstasy usage are alarm
ing, because the drug afflicts
just about every integral organ
in the human body. For exam
ple, MDMA causes severe mus
cle breakdowns, known as
rhabdomyolisis, which leads to
kidney failure. Ecstasy also
cause an irregular increase in
heart rate and blood pressure,
putting users at a higher risk
for heart disease.
Perhaps the most severe
organ afflicted is the brain. Re
cent research done by the Part
nership fora Drug-Free Ameri
ca link MDMA use to a long
term damage of those parts of
the brain critical to all cognitive
function. It is believed that the
drug causes damage to the neu
rons that use the chemical sero
tonin to communicate with
other neurons.

In a recent interview by
Newsweek magazine, Dr.
George Ricaurte, a neurologist
at Johns I lopkins who has pub
lished many Ecstasy and other
MDMA studies, said evidence
was overwhelming that the drug
is hazardous.
"My belief and the belief of
the vast majority of others is that
the serotonin-producing nerve
endings are destroyed by the
drug. It is a pruning, if you will,"
Ricaurte said.
Ricaurte started his research
on Ecstasy seven years ago with
a single image of a monkey brain
on MDMA. After several doses
commonly taken by users over a
span of one month, Ricaurte
found that the brain was shot
through with holes where its
neurons should have been busy
making serotonin.
"The implications seemed
obvious," Ricaurte said. "If Ec
stasy could eat away at a mon
key, it could do the same to us."
Not only did Ricaurte 112 ind that
Ecstasy severely damages many
parts of the brain, he also linked
its usage to a high risk of develop
ing Parkinson's disease. In order
to model the drug's effects on a
frequent user, Ricaurte injected
the monkeys with small amounts
of MDMA three times in nine
hours, and found similar results:
one night's worth of Ecstasy also
kills the brain cells that produce
dopamine, a chemical messenger
similar to adrenaline. Dopamine
affects brain processes that con
trol movement, emotional re
sponse and ability to experience
pleasure and pain.
A variety of cognitive and
mental problems result from
dopamine deficiencies, which
may explain why some Ecstasy
users experience severe lethar
gy the morning after use. Ac
cording to Ricaurte, if the
dopamine reductions in the
brain are permanent, users
may be vulnerable to early
onset Parkinson's disease, a
disorder of the central nervous
system. More unnerving is the
fact that a serious diagnosis of
the disorder is caused by the
death of those same dopamine
producing neurons.
In a recent interview by The
Washington Post, Alan Leshner,
the former director of the Na
