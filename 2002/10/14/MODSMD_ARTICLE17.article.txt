# Fellows bring tech to the third world

Reuters Digital Vision fellows
at Stanford's Center for the
Study of Language and Informa
tion are working to extend the
bounty of Silicon Valley to the
developing world.
"For economic development of
the third world, we have to create
enablers to allow the entrepre
neurial talent that is there to come
out," said Sanjay Bhargava, a
Reuters Digital Vision Fellow at
the Center for the Study of Lan
guage and Information. "The
technological models of Ebay and
Pay Pal have not been extended to
the third world."
Thomas George, another fellow,
said that "the rural poor in the
poverty cycle have no connection to
technology. An internet connection
center doesn't help — we need to
change the focus to people."
Bhargava and George are just
two of the twelve visiting fellows at
CSLI t his year engaged in projects
to bring cutting-edge technology
to underdeveloped regions. The
Digital Vision Fellowship, now in
its second year, gives the fellows
nine months to execute their am
bitious projects using the re
sources of Stanford to solve exist
ing development problems.
From a rich variety of back
grounds, each fellow has a unique
vision of how the Internet can be
applied to the developing world.
Bhargava, a founding employee
of Pay Pal, wanted to exploit the
direct seller and consumer con
nection. Starting with two prod
ucts — cotton rugs and light
weight quilts — the wanted to cre
ate a company that would bridge
the gap between Indian sellers in
Delhi and Bay Area buyers.
Bhargava's project, which he
characterized as "venture philan
thropy," aims to cut out the Crate

and Barrels of the world and in
crease the amount of money that
returns to the workers in India
who make rugs on pit looms.
Named SuVyapar, which
means "good trade" in Hindi,
Bhargava's model would set up a
world community fund where all
the profits would be directed. This
fund would then finance locally
relevant products to help the pro
ducers in the developing world.
All of the company's finances
would be completely transparent.
Bhargava has his market - social
ly conscious consumers - and has al
ready put together the organiza
tional structure for his company.
"We need six market-makers
for the Bay Area, a business lead,
and a technology lead," he said.
It may seem a lot like a startup,
but Bhargava notes that he is also
trying a unique experiment.
"I want to open source every
part of the commercial enter
prise," he said. "We will place
plans, linancials, everything in the
public domain."
Bhargava plans may seem am
bitious, but he argues that they
are practical.
"I don't believe charity based
on pure volunteerism is success
ful. It must be economically sus
tainable," he said.
Still, Bhargava has high hopes.
"Just from India to the United
States, by the year 2005 we expect
$1 billion of exports to How
through this re-engineered
model."
George also wants to use the In
ternet to connect the poor in the
developing world. But instead of
connecting the developed and de
veloping worlds, he wants to use
the Internet to improve local con
nections between those with
knowledge and those who need it.
"E-mail is a killer application be
cause of the personal connection,"

George said. His vision involves
farmers connecting with personal
ized databases of local experts who
can help with their problems in
stead of just allowing access to the
overwhelming Internet.
"The farmer will want to grow a
particular crop, say soybeans, and
then he can talk to a soybean ex
pert, a market maker and some
one who can provide value-added
services," he said.
Starting with a specific crop,
soybeans, in a certain region, a
subdistrict of Maharashtra, India,
George wants to create a fully
working prototype. His plans are
already sponsored by one Silicon
Valley entrepreneur, and he
hopes that a working prototype
will attract attention and allow his
project to expand.
"Repositories of knowledge do

not necessarily solve problems, es
pecially those of the poor,"
George said. "Better connections
instead lead to greater returns on
investment in agriculture."
"Right now there are ineffi
ciencies, including substantially
lower production than is possi
ble, waste of resources from in
appropriate use, very low prices
in comparison to what con
sumers actually pay, and lack of
opportunities to add value to the
produce," said George.
George grew up in rural India
and comes from a farming back
ground himself. He has a l'h.l). in
agronomy and has worked for
twelve years with the International
Rice Research Institute. Now
George sees himself in a career

transition, as he knows how much
knowledge is generated about
agriculture but how little actually
reaches farmers.
"More than 1.2 billion people
live on less than a dollar a day,"he
said. "And they live hand to mouth,
not because they want to, but be
cause they are unable to make
more money than they invest."

"I am determined and poised
to make a difference, given my
own background of growing up
with limited resources and know
ing what being informed can do to
people's lives," said George.
Both researchers are looking
to tap the Stanford community
for resources and welcome po
tential collaborators. Bhargava's
project is explained on his web
site, www.transfinium.com, and
