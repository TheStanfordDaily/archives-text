# Cheer squad has competitive advantage
## New Cardinal Competitive Cheer seeks new members to perform with squad 
### NATALIE SCHWARTZ 
Students who thought being a Dolly was
their only opportunity to cheer for Stanford
now have another option. Cardinal Competi
tive Cheer, Stanford's new competitive cheer
leading team, is seeking two to five new mem
bers to add to its current 16-member squad.
This year's tryouts will be held Oct. 14 and
1 6. The squad was originally formed last year,
but is competing for the first time this year.
Interest for the group has been spreading
since last fall, when sophomores Chelsea
Dudek and Renee Burrull started talking
about their common love for cheering. Dudek
and Burrull both cheered competitively prior
to coming to Stanford and were surprised to
find out that, with so many sports and dance
groups, there was no cheering squad.
"I have played a lot of sports," said Dudek,
"But 1 love cheering the most because no
body sits on the bench. Every member of the
squad is essential; the pyramid falls without
one person. This creates a stronger cama

raderie than in other sports."
During winter quarter the two began pur
suing the possibility of starting a squad them
selves. By word of mouth and friends, they
found four other people that were interested,
and, together, they filled out the paperwork
to become an official ASSU student group.
They held tryouts the third week of spring
quarter and formed a squad of 14 women
and two men and three alternates.
Not all of the women have cheered com
petitively before, although all have strong
backgrounds in dance, gymnastics or other
sports. Sophomore Kim Strand, one of the six
members of the original cheer group, says "1
have done all kinds of dance — ballet, tap,
jazz, hip-hop — and gymnastics. These two
are the basis of cheerleading, so it wasn't hard
to make the transition."
The squad is lead by coach Lena Thomp
son, a recent graduate of James Madison Uni
versity in Virginia, where she was a cheer
leader herself.
"She brings first-hand collegiate cheer ex
perience to the squad, which is vital," Dudek
reports. "Even those of us who have cheered
before are learning a lot; the collegiate level is
very different from high school."
Lena works closely with the new team,
teaching them new moves and helping the

members to perfect their skills as well as
choreographing all their cheers.
Most importantly, Burrull says, "She shows
such enthusiasm and loyalty to our squad."
The squad will make its debut perfor
mance on Nov. 17, performing with other stu
dent performance groups from Stanford and
Cal at a pre-Big Game rally at Pier 39 in San
Francisco. Its Stanford debut will be Nov. IS
at the halltime show for the men's basketball
team's first pre-season game against Boston
University. The squad hopes to perform at
more recreational events and halltime shows
to gain experience performing and becoming
more widely known across campus.
The team's competitive debut will be the
USA regional Spirit Competition on Jan. 19 at
the University of the Pacific in Santa Rosa,
Calif. It also plans to attend the USA Colle
giate Cheer and Dance Nationals Feb. 9 and
10 in Las Vegas, NV.
Strand wants everyone to know that "the
Cardinal Competitive Cheerleading group
gives students a taste of what collegiate cheer
leading is all about. With awesome stunts,
amazing tumblers and sharp choreographed
dances, we hope to provide a new and differ
ent entertainment to the student body!"
