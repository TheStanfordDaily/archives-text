The Graduate School of Business is expand
ing its Center for Social Innovation in an effort to
centralize all of its programs dealing with social
work.
"CSI is an umbrella organization for several
different programs here at the Business School,"
said Julie Juergens, director of external relations
and program development for CSI.
"This summer, the [Business] School aggre
gated all of the social impact work being done at
the GSB under the CSI umbrella. Additionally,
several new programs were launched under the
auspices of CSI," she added.
These new programs include the Stanford
Project on Emerging Nonprofits, the Stanford
Social Innovation Review and the Stanford Edu
cational Leadership Institute.
The Stanford Project on Emerging Nonprof
its will examine the effects of different funding
sources on young nonprofit organizations. The
project, which will be completed in 2005, will
track and analyze 20 nonprofits that were started
between 1995 and 2001.
The Stanford Social Innovation Review will
"chronicle and advance the exchange of ideas be
tween the nonprofit, public and private sectors to
foster innovative solutions to social problems,"
Juergens said.

The Stanford Educational Leadership Insti
tute, a joint collaboration with the Business
School and the School of Education, will explore
the integration of the knowledge and resources
from teaching and learning with the practices of
organizational management to create, redesign
and sustain high-performing K-12 schools, ac
cording to Juergens.
These new programs adhere to CSl's three
primary goals: to support research, promote
teaching and provide community outreach.
The Stanford Project of Emerging Non
profits and the Stanford Social Innovation Re
view are just two of the many research-orient
ed programs run by CSI. CSl's research fo
cuses on that which applies general manage
ment or entrepreneurial knowledge to under
stand and improve the performance of social
purpose organizations.
CSI also promotes teaching in the area of so
cial innovation. Programs such as the Stanford
Educational Leadership Institute provide an in
terdisciplinary focus on ideas related to social
purpose organizations. Currently there are 17
faculty affiliates from the Business School who
work with CSI.
CSI also houses community outreach activities
that directly impact more than 700 nonprofit or
ganizations each year. These include community
conferences and the Alumni Consulting Team,
which provides pro bono management consult

ing services from Business School alumni to non
profit and government agencies.
The Alumni Consulting Team is one of the
many programs in existence prior to the forma
tion of CSI but brought under the umbrella of
CSI this summer.
Others include the Public Management Pro
gram, a 31-year-old program that oilers a com
prehensive approach to public management
education through academic, co-curricular and
extra-curricular activities, and the Quest Schol
ars Program, which is an educational / leader
ship program for gifted low-income high school
juniors and seniors who are concerned with the
environment.
CSI was founded to promote innovative, ef
fective and efficient solutions to important social
problems by adapting business knowledge and
experience to challenges faced by the nonprofit
sector.
"Through the Center for Social Innovation,
the 1 Business] School has made a long-term com
mitment to making the world a better place by
helping managed institutions — whether non
profit, private, or public-sector — better perform
their important social missions," said Stanford
Graduate School of Business Dean Robert Joss.
CSI is led by faculty co-directors Dale Miller,
professor of organization behavior and psycholo
gy, and James Phiilis, acting associate professor or
organization behavior.
