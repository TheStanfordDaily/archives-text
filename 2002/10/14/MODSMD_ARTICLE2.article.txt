### ILENA C. GEORGE 
I he Peninsula Peace and Jus
tice Center yesterday sponsored a
teach-in about the current conflict
with Iraq. Aimed at informing
students and others from around
t lie Bay Area about the issues sur
rounding and underlying the
current conflict, the teach-in car
ried a decidedly anti-war message
and, despite sparse student atten
dance, was deemed a success by
many participants.
Stanford faculty and other ex
perls spoke to students, faculty,
local activists and anti-war sup
porters in a series of workshops
addressing different aspects of
the conflict, its historical basis
and the potential consequences
of military action.

"Education conies first," said
Paul George, director of the
Peninsula Peace and Justice Cen
ter. "If people are going to op
pose (he war or support it, they
should really know what the
deeper issues are, and they're cer
tainly not getting that from the
sources that they have right now,"
he said.
"This is a way to get some peo
ple who are real experts in their
different fields . . . to sit clown
with folks and deliver that infor
mation one-to-one, which is,
from my experience, the most ef
fective way of organizing and
reaching people."
The Peninsula Peace and Jus
tice Center was instrumental in
the initiation and organization of
this weekend's teach-in. In order
to further educate the communi
ty, (he talks held (his weekend will
he aired on local television.
According to History Prof. Joel
Beinin, the event had been in the
works since early September.

Beinin spoke during the opening
plenary on the political landsc ape
of the Middle East and conducted
a workshop on the history of U.S.-
Iraq relations.
In their opening remarks, both
Beinin and George criticized the
current administration and its
reasons for going to war.
Beinin summarized his open
ing remarks: "What I am suggest
ing is that a closely linked c ire le of
neo-conservative ideologues with
strong ties to Israel . . . have long
favored a war against Iraq," he
said. "They seized the opportuni
ty of the Sept. 1 1 attacks to pro
mote the notion that a war on Iraq
is an integral part of the war
against terrorism, despite having
no evidence that Iraq had a part
in the Sept. 1 1 attacks."
At the end of his speech,
George stressed, "It is not too late.
It is even not too late to stop this
war."
