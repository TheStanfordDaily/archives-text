# Teach-in tackles Iraq issues
## Faculty, other experts critique U.S. govt's Iraq policy 
### ILENA C. GEORGE 
I he Peninsula Peace and Jus
tice Center yesterday sponsored a
teach-in about the current conflict
with Iraq. Aimed at informing
students and others from around
t lie Bay Area about the issues sur
rounding and underlying the
current conflict, the teach-in car
ried a decidedly anti-war message
and, despite sparse student atten
dance, was deemed a success by
many participants.
Stanford faculty and other ex
perls spoke to students, faculty,
local activists and anti-war sup
porters in a series of workshops
addressing different aspects of
the conflict, its historical basis
and the potential consequences
of military action.

"Education conies first," said
Paul George, director of the
Peninsula Peace and Justice Cen
ter. "If people are going to op
pose (he war or support it, they
should really know what the
deeper issues are, and they're cer
tainly not getting that from the
sources that they have right now,"
he said.
"This is a way to get some peo
ple who are real experts in their
different fields . . . to sit clown
with folks and deliver that infor
mation one-to-one, which is,
from my experience, the most ef
fective way of organizing and
reaching people."
The Peninsula Peace and Jus
tice Center was instrumental in
the initiation and organization of
this weekend's teach-in. In order
to further educate the communi
ty, (he talks held (his weekend will
he aired on local television.
According to History Prof. Joel
Beinin, the event had been in the
works since early September.

Beinin spoke during the opening
plenary on the political landsc ape
of the Middle East and conducted
a workshop on the history of U.S.-
Iraq relations.
In their opening remarks, both
Beinin and George criticized the
current administration and its
reasons for going to war.
Beinin summarized his open
ing remarks: "What I am suggest
ing is that a closely linked c ire le of
neo-conservative ideologues with
strong ties to Israel . . . have long
favored a war against Iraq," he
said. "They seized the opportuni
ty of the Sept. 1 1 attacks to pro
mote the notion that a war on Iraq
is an integral part of the war
against terrorism, despite having
no evidence that Iraq had a part
in the Sept. 1 1 attacks."
At the end of his speech,
George stressed, "It is not too late.
It is even not too late to stop this
war."

Asst. History Prof. David Como speaks about the possible courses of action the United States should take with Iraq
yesterday during a teach-in.
Originally, Scott Ritter, who
went into Iraq as a weapons in
spector for the United Nations,
was also scheduled to speak dur
ing the opening plenary. 1 lowev
er, Ritter was unable to attend be
cause he was meeting with world
leaders in South Africa to address
the conflict with Iraq.
Following the opening re
marks, there were two sessions of
workshops taught by Stanford
faculty and other experts from
beyond the University.
Among the workshops were
one on the history of U.S.-Iraq re
lations before and after the Gulf
War, including the impact of U.S.
sanctions on Iraq, and one enti
tled "Economy, Labor and War,"
led by Dave Sylvester of the San
Jose Mercury News.
Those who attended the teach
in said they found the sessions in
formative.
"I think this is wonderful," said
Mahmood Suleiman, one of the
attendees of the workshop on the
history of U.S.-Iraq relations. "1
commend professor Beinin for
encapsulating all of that in this

[short | period of time."
Suleiman was born in Iraq
and has done graduate study at
Stanford.
"I lived part of that histo
ry . . . that historical background
that he gave is quite accurate."
Ending the day was a closing
plenary session featuring live
music by "Folk This!"
While a significant number of
students attended the opening
remarks and first session of
workshops, few remained at the
event by the closing plenary ses
sion, which was instead attended
mostly by older activists who
strongly encouraged collegiate
involvement and activism.
"We believe that education will
lead directly to active opposition
to the war," George said. "I think
when you dig behind the political
rhetoric, there's really only one
side to come down on. This is a
political move by the administra
tion to save itself from what had
been a politically damaging sum
mer . . . they have manufactured
a crisis here."
George added that he believes
that although most of the speak
ers were opposed to the war, the
teach-in was not biased.
"I like to think it's not one
sided, it's the truth."

spector for the United Nations,
was also scheduled to speak dur
ing the opening plenary. 1 lowev
er, Ritter was unable to attend be
cause he was meeting with world
leaders in South Africa to address
the conflict with Iraq.
Following the opening re
marks, there were two sessions of
workshops taught by Stanford
faculty and other experts from
beyond the University.
Among the workshops were
one on the history of U.S.-Iraq re
lations before and after the Gulf
War, including the impact of U.S.
sanctions on Iraq, and one enti
tled "Economy, Labor and War,"
led by Dave Sylvester of the San
Jose Mercury News.
Those who attended the teach
in said they found the sessions in
formative.
"I think this is wonderful," said
Mahmood Suleiman, one of the
attendees of the workshop on the
history of U.S.-Iraq relations. "1
commend professor Beinin for
encapsulating all of that in this

[short | period of time."
Suleiman was born in Iraq
and has done graduate study at
Stanford.
"I lived part of that histo
ry . . . that historical background
that he gave is quite accurate."
Ending the day was a closing
plenary session featuring live
music by "Folk This!"
While a significant number of
students attended the opening
remarks and first session of
workshops, few remained at the
event by the closing plenary ses
sion, which was instead attended
mostly by older activists who
strongly encouraged collegiate
involvement and activism.
"We believe that education will
lead directly to active opposition
to the war," George said. "I think
when you dig behind the political
rhetoric, there's really only one
side to come down on. This is a
political move by the administra
tion to save itself from what had
been a politically damaging sum
mer . . . they have manufactured
a crisis here."
George added that he believes
that although most of the speak
ers were opposed to the war, the
teach-in was not biased.
"I like to think it's not one
sided, it's the truth."
I he Peninsula Peace and Jus
tice Center yesterday sponsored a
teach-in about the current conflict
with Iraq. Aimed at informing
students and others from around
t lie Bay Area about the issues sur
rounding and underlying the
current conflict, the teach-in car
ried a decidedly anti-war message
and, despite sparse student atten
dance, was deemed a success by
many participants.
Stanford faculty and other ex
perls spoke to students, faculty,
local activists and anti-war sup
porters in a series of workshops
addressing different aspects of
the conflict, its historical basis
and the potential consequences
of military action.

"Education conies first," said
Paul George, director of the
Peninsula Peace and Justice Cen
ter. "If people are going to op
pose (he war or support it, they
should really know what the
deeper issues are, and they're cer
tainly not getting that from the
sources that they have right now,"
he said.
"This is a way to get some peo
ple who are real experts in their
different fields . . . to sit clown
with folks and deliver that infor
mation one-to-one, which is,
from my experience, the most ef
fective way of organizing and
reaching people."
The Peninsula Peace and Jus
tice Center was instrumental in
the initiation and organization of
this weekend's teach-in. In order
to further educate the communi
ty, (he talks held (his weekend will
he aired on local television.
According to History Prof. Joel
Beinin, the event had been in the
works since early September.

Beinin spoke during the opening
plenary on the political landsc ape
of the Middle East and conducted
a workshop on the history of U.S.-
Iraq relations.
In their opening remarks, both
Beinin and George criticized the
current administration and its
reasons for going to war.
Beinin summarized his open
ing remarks: "What I am suggest
ing is that a closely linked c ire le of
neo-conservative ideologues with
strong ties to Israel . . . have long
favored a war against Iraq," he
said. "They seized the opportuni
ty of the Sept. 1 1 attacks to pro
mote the notion that a war on Iraq
is an integral part of the war
against terrorism, despite having
no evidence that Iraq had a part
in the Sept. 1 1 attacks."
At the end of his speech,
George stressed, "It is not too late.
It is even not too late to stop this
war."
