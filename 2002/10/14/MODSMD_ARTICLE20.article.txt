## Cardinal falls to 1-4 after loss to Cougars 
### MATT LONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
One play sums up Stanford's Saturday
afternoon against No. 12 Washington
State.
The situation: Trailing 26-3 with a few
seeonds to play in the third quarter, the
Cardinal drives deep in Cougar territory
behind the arm of junior quarterback
Chris Lewis. After an untimely delay-of
game penalty, Stanford faces fourth-and
-13 from the Washington State 28-yard line.

No. 1 2 Washington State 36, Stanford 1 1

The play: Lewis drops back to pass and
under heavy pressure, rolls out to his right
and begins to scramble down the Cougar
sideline. He gains six yards before two de
fenders set their sights on shooting down
any Cardinal comeback.
The choice: Lewis evaluates the situa
tion and, with seven yards to go for the
first down, he ducks out of bounds,
choosing to surrender the ball on downs
rather than face the tacklers and attempt
to squeeze out a first down.
These kind of plays happened all game,
as Stanford (1-4, 0-2 Pacific-10 Conference)
lacked poise, intensity and decision-making
ability in a 36-11 loss. The blowout is the
Cardinal's third straight loss, giving the
squad its worst record since 1998, and its

worst defeat to the Cougars (6-1, 3-0) since
1961, leaving Stanford wondering when the
sun will shine over first-year head coach
Buddy Teevens' cloudy start
"We're not questioning the play-call
ing or the scheme," senior receiver Luke
Powell said. "We're questioning our
selves. Why are we doing stupid things?
Why is it not working?"
One reason is the absence of a leader. No
player has been able to emerge and make the
big play at the right moment. This has re
sulted in frustration leading to 11 penalties
for 85 yards — seven of which came from
pure lack of discipline (five personal fouls
and two roughing the passer flags).
The Cougars began the game by scoring
at will on the Cardinal's shaky defense.
Washington Suite found the end/one on its
first three possessions. First, tailback Jer
maine Green took advantage of Stanford's
arm tackling to chalk up the first seven points
on a 42-yard run. Then, after Lewis was in
tercepted by Jason David, who returned the
ball to the Stanford 18-yard line, quarter
back Jason Gesser found Jerome Riley on a
three-yard touchdown pass.
Gesser, a darkhorse Heisman candidate,
threw for 297 yards and three touchdowns,
despite suffering from bruised ribs.
With a2l-0 deficit, the Cardinal could not
stage any sort of first half comeback, with
special teams' mistakes costing even more
points. Drew Caylor's snap to fellow junior
Eric Johnson sailed past the punter and into

the end zone fora safety, and then, after se
nior safety Colin Branch provided the Car
dinal with its best field position of the half by
snagging Cesser's only interception, redshirt
freshman Michael Sgroi missed a 41-yard
field goal that would have put the Stanford
on the board.

As it happened, the Cardinal did not
score until midway through the third quar
ter, when Sgroi hit a 28-yard field goal.
()n the next drive, Stanford showed signs
of life when junior linebacker Jake Covault
intercepted Cesser and returned the ball the
the Cougar 32-yardline. But mental error

struck again when the play was nullified by a
whistle for roughing the passer.
"We kind of feel like nothing's working,"
Lewis said. "It seems like every time we get a
drive, we get a setback. Our defense is play-

Lewis threw for 102 yards on 13-
<>1-27 passing with one interception
and no touchdowns. 1 le did not
reenter the game alter the afore
mentioned gaffe, but redshirt fresh
man backup Kyle Matter did little to
inspire Teevens' confidence with
seven-of-14 for 56 yards and an in
terception against a Cougar defense
made up of mostly backups late in
the game. Teevens declared that he
will stick with Ix»wis as the starter in
next week's homecoming contest
with Arizona.
"Chris is our starter, and we're
planning to move forward with
him," Teevens said.
One rose among the thorns for
Teevens was the performance of
backup tailback Kenneth Tolon.
Tolon sparked Stanford's stagnant
running attack in the second quar
ter, and led the Cardinal with 89
yards on 14 carries. 1 lie sophomore

averaged over six yards per carry,
compared with three for senior
suiter Kerry Carter.
Following the game, Teevens ac
knowledged that Tolon will lx' given
more repetitions in practice this
week, with the chance to earn a stint
ing role.

"Chris is our starter, and we're

One rose among the thorns for

Tolon sparked Stanford's stagnant

MATT SAYLES/The Stanford Daily
Sophomore safety O.J. Atowge sacks Washington State quarterback Jason
Gesser to force a fumble.
One play sums up Stanford's Saturday
afternoon against No. 12 Washington
State.
The situation: Trailing 26-3 with a few
seeonds to play in the third quarter, the
Cardinal drives deep in Cougar territory
behind the arm of junior quarterback
Chris Lewis. After an untimely delay-of
game penalty, Stanford faces fourth-and
-13 from the Washington State 28-yard line.
Football

No. 1 2 Washington State 36, Stanford 1 1

The play: Lewis drops back to pass and
under heavy pressure, rolls out to his right
and begins to scramble down the Cougar
sideline. He gains six yards before two de
fenders set their sights on shooting down
any Cardinal comeback.
The choice: Lewis evaluates the situa
tion and, with seven yards to go for the
first down, he ducks out of bounds,
choosing to surrender the ball on downs
rather than face the tacklers and attempt
to squeeze out a first down.
These kind of plays happened all game,
as Stanford (1-4, 0-2 Pacific-10 Conference)
lacked poise, intensity and decision-making
ability in a 36-11 loss. The blowout is the
Cardinal's third straight loss, giving the
squad its worst record since 1998, and its

worst defeat to the Cougars (6-1, 3-0) since
1961, leaving Stanford wondering when the
sun will shine over first-year head coach
Buddy Teevens' cloudy start
"We're not questioning the play-call
ing or the scheme," senior receiver Luke
Powell said. "We're questioning our
selves. Why are we doing stupid things?
Why is it not working?"
One reason is the absence of a leader. No
player has been able to emerge and make the
big play at the right moment. This has re
sulted in frustration leading to 11 penalties
for 85 yards — seven of which came from
pure lack of discipline (five personal fouls
and two roughing the passer flags).
The Cougars began the game by scoring
at will on the Cardinal's shaky defense.
Washington Suite found the end/one on its
first three possessions. First, tailback Jer
maine Green took advantage of Stanford's
arm tackling to chalk up the first seven points
on a 42-yard run. Then, after Lewis was in
tercepted by Jason David, who returned the
ball to the Stanford 18-yard line, quarter
back Jason Gesser found Jerome Riley on a
three-yard touchdown pass.
Gesser, a darkhorse Heisman candidate,
threw for 297 yards and three touchdowns,
despite suffering from bruised ribs.
With a2l-0 deficit, the Cardinal could not
stage any sort of first half comeback, with
special teams' mistakes costing even more
points. Drew Caylor's snap to fellow junior
Eric Johnson sailed past the punter and into

the end zone fora safety, and then, after se
nior safety Colin Branch provided the Car
dinal with its best field position of the half by
snagging Cesser's only interception, redshirt
freshman Michael Sgroi missed a 41-yard
field goal that would have put the Stanford
on the board.

As it happened, the Cardinal did not
score until midway through the third quar
ter, when Sgroi hit a 28-yard field goal.
()n the next drive, Stanford showed signs
of life when junior linebacker Jake Covault
intercepted Cesser and returned the ball the
the Cougar 32-yardline. But mental error

struck again when the play was nullified by a
whistle for roughing the passer.
