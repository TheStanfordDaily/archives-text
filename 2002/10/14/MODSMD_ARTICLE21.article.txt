Five minutes into the first overtime, the
Beavers' defense committed a foul against Car
dinal forward James Twellman on the light
side of the field, close to the penalty box.
As lie has done many times in his career,
midfielder Johanes Maliza placed the free
kick up in the air towards the back post and
Fernandez's head was in the right place at the
right time.
"All game long, I was setting screens for
our set pieces and this time, I thought I would
try to cut in the back post," Fernandez ex
plained alter the game. "The ball came, and I
just put it in."
Fernandez also scored die winning goal in a
double overtime victory over San Jose State on
Oct. 3.
"These wins were important for us, because
the Pac-1() this year is really tight," Maliza said.
"With such good teams, we can't afford to slip
up, especially at home."
The Fernandez header ended a match that
saw seven yellow cards. In such a physical
game, the already-depleted Cardinal lineup
managed to escape from the 95-minute match
with its second conference win of the weekend.

Already a thin roster with 23 players, the
Cardinal was without Ail-American forward
Roger Levesque, its leading scorer, because of
an injured light knee. Also missing in action
was All-Pac-10 senior defender I odd Duni
vant, who sat out due to a torn quadricep mus
cle in his right leg.
Maliza, who was also questionable before the

weekend started, noted that the team was able
to play well without its stars because of Stan
ford's emphasis on team play.
"[Dunivantand Levesque] are great players,
but there's no excuse to lose any game," he said.
"We're not a team of just 10, II guys — a lot of

people stepped up and played well
for us."
Although Stanford compensat
ed for its losses well enough to win,
Levesque and Dunivant's absences
were obvious at times.
There were moments during
the Oregon State game where pos
session was lost quickly on the of
fensive side. Levesque is known as
one of the nation's best ball-posses
sors up front, and without him in

the lineup, the offense stalled on
many occasions.
However, Fernandez, Twell
man and fellow forward Matt
Janus/, filled in admirably.
Janusz also scored an unassisted
goal in the match against Wash
ington.
On Friday night, Stanford
opened its Pac-10 season with a
solid 2-0 victory over Washington
(3-4,0-2).
If Fernandez was the MVP for
the second game, the Stanford de
fense shared MVP honors for the
entire weekend.
Without Dunivant, its most of

fensive-minded defender, head
coach Bret Simon decided to go
with sophomore Seyi Abolaji as a
defensive midfielder for both
matches. The strategy worked
very well as the defense was able
to shut out one of the nation's
most potent offenses in the
Beavers yesterday.
Also playing key roles in patch
ing up the defense were Ashvin
Kumar, Bronson McDonald,
Todd Leber and Clayton Peters.
The goalkeepers played flawlessly
as Robby Fulton notched his fifth
clean sheet of the season yesterday.
Andrew Ferris recorded his third

shutout of the season against
Washington.
While Terris and the defense
were solid throughout the match
on Friday, the offense helped by
scoring early and often.
In the 15th minute, Janusz
scored on a deflected shot off
Washington goalkeeper Chris
Eylander's chest. Only four min
utes later, the Cardinal offensive
onslaught continued as 6-foot-4
central defender Taylor Graham
headed in a corner kick from
Twellman.
The offense quieted down after
its second score, but the 2-0 cush

ion was more than enough for the
(Cardinal defense.
Although his team looked shaky
without its two stars, Simon was very
pleased with his squad's efforts.
"I think everybody chipped
in a little bit," he said. "We got
two results that we had to get at
home. I don't think we were co
hesive at times — sometimes we
couldn't hold the ball up front,
and we weren't able to play the
ball from the back as confident
ly. However, we were short
handed in two physical games,
and the guys worked hard this
weekend. I'm excited and

proud for the team."
According to Simon, Levesque
and Dunivant are still question
able for this weekend's confer
ence games against No. (i UCLA
and unranked Fresno State.
However, progress is being made
in both cases, and it is very possi
ble that they will play in the
team's trip to Southern Califor
nia.
Either way, with the heart that
the team showed this past week
end, the Cardinal is looking for
ward to giving the Bruins and

er players are available.

Although Stanford compensat
ed for its losses well enough to win,
Levesque and Dunivant's absences
were obvious at times.
There were moments during
the Oregon State game where pos
session was lost quickly on the of
fensive side. Levesque is known as
one of the nation's best ball-posses
sors up front, and without him in

the lineup, the offense stalled on
many occasions.
However, Fernandez, Twell
man and fellow forward Matt
Janus/, filled in admirably.
Janusz also scored an unassisted
goal in the match against Wash
ington.
On Friday night, Stanford
opened its Pac-10 season with a
solid 2-0 victory over Washington
(3-4,0-2).
If Fernandez was the MVP for
the second game, the Stanford de
fense shared MVP honors for the
entire weekend.
Without Dunivant, its most of

fensive-minded defender, head
coach Bret Simon decided to go
with sophomore Seyi Abolaji as a
defensive midfielder for both
matches. The strategy worked
very well as the defense was able
to shut out one of the nation's
most potent offenses in the
Beavers yesterday.
Also playing key roles in patch
ing up the defense were Ashvin
Kumar, Bronson McDonald,
Todd Leber and Clayton Peters.
The goalkeepers played flawlessly
as Robby Fulton notched his fifth
clean sheet of the season yesterday.
Andrew Ferris recorded his third

shutout of the season against
Washington.
While Terris and the defense
were solid throughout the match
on Friday, the offense helped by
scoring early and often.
In the 15th minute, Janusz
scored on a deflected shot off
Washington goalkeeper Chris
Eylander's chest. Only four min
utes later, the Cardinal offensive
onslaught continued as 6-foot-4
central defender Taylor Graham
headed in a corner kick from
Twellman.
The offense quieted down after
its second score, but the 2-0 cush

ion was more than enough for the
(Cardinal defense.
Although his team looked shaky
without its two stars, Simon was very
pleased with his squad's efforts.
"I think everybody chipped
in a little bit," he said. "We got
two results that we had to get at
home. I don't think we were co
hesive at times — sometimes we
couldn't hold the ball up front,
and we weren't able to play the
ball from the back as confident
ly. However, we were short
handed in two physical games,
and the guys worked hard this
weekend. I'm excited and

proud for the team."
According to Simon, Levesque
and Dunivant are still question
able for this weekend's confer
ence games against No. (i UCLA
and unranked Fresno State.
However, progress is being made
in both cases, and it is very possi
ble that they will play in the
team's trip to Southern Califor
nia.
Either way, with the heart that
the team showed this past week
end, the Cardinal is looking for
ward to giving the Bruins and
Bulldogs its best shot with whatev
er players are available.

In an extremely physical match under a
scorching Sunday afternoon sun, forward Dar
ren Fernandez scored his second game-win
ning goal in three games to give the No. 1 Car

fought 1-0 overtime victory over No. 18 Ore
gon State (9-3, 0-2).

Five minutes into the first overtime, the
Beavers' defense committed a foul against Car
dinal forward James Twellman on the light
side of the field, close to the penalty box.
As lie has done many times in his career,
midfielder Johanes Maliza placed the free
kick up in the air towards the back post and
Fernandez's head was in the right place at the
right time.
"All game long, I was setting screens for
our set pieces and this time, I thought I would
try to cut in the back post," Fernandez ex
plained alter the game. "The ball came, and I
just put it in."
Fernandez also scored die winning goal in a
double overtime victory over San Jose State on
Oct. 3.
"These wins were important for us, because
the Pac-1() this year is really tight," Maliza said.
"With such good teams, we can't afford to slip
up, especially at home."
The Fernandez header ended a match that
saw seven yellow cards. In such a physical
game, the already-depleted Cardinal lineup
managed to escape from the 95-minute match
with its second conference win of the weekend.

Already a thin roster with 23 players, the
Cardinal was without Ail-American forward
Roger Levesque, its leading scorer, because of
an injured light knee. Also missing in action
was All-Pac-10 senior defender I odd Duni
vant, who sat out due to a torn quadricep mus
cle in his right leg.
Maliza, who was also questionable before the

weekend started, noted that the team was able
to play well without its stars because of Stan
ford's emphasis on team play.
"[Dunivantand Levesque] are great players,
but there's no excuse to lose any game," he said.
