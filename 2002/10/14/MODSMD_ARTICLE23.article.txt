# Team waiting for leader to emerge
## After 1-4 start, Teevens and players look for answers 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN STAFF WRITER 
On Saturday, the Cardinal
just couldn't pull it together.
Coming off an emotional loss
to No. 8 Notre Dame, the Cardi
nal faced No. 12 Washington
State at Stanford Stadium.
The Cougars were led by
Heisman Trophy candidate
Jason Cesser, who finished with
297 yards and three touch
downs. Cesser led his team to
victory, whether with his play on
the field or his actions on the
sideline.
In comparison, the Cardinal
seemed without leadership all
game, as no one stepped up to
make the big play.
"We need to find a way to put
the ball in the end zone," head
coach Buddy Teevens said.
After the game, the team was
at a loss for words, searching to
find a way to explain its 1-4 start.
"We gotta put it all together
eventually," junior receiver
Luke Powell said.
"Its hard to tell what it-is, but
something is different," junior
quarterback Chris Lewis said.
"I need to continue to try to
make plays," sophomore wide
receiver Teyo Johnson said.
Stanford suddenly looks like
a team stuck in quicksand. On
the sidelines, the players appear
silent, taking in the game. The
Cardinal players are also begin
ning to look desperate.
"We need to bear down and
regroup," Johnson said.
I he team seems to be missing
something on offense. In partic -
ular. no one has stepped up as a
leader.
"A leader is still emerging,"
Teevens said. " There are a
bunch of guys with leadership
capabilities. A lot of the seniors
have that capability."
Without a clear-cut leader,
the offense seems lost on the
field, unable to create strong
drives into the end zone.
"It's on me to adjust," Lewis
saifl. "I've got to step up and

lead this team."
The Cardinal was penalized
11 times for 85 yards during the
game. In particular, the penal
ties halted drives and nullified
key plays. With these mistakes,
Stanford couldn't push the
Cougars.
"We hurt ourselves," John
son said. "We make drive-killing
mistakes. We just gotta stop
killing ourselves."
In order to stop this down
ward spiral, the Cardinal needs
someone to step up and take
hold of the team.
"All of our guys are leaders,"
Powell said. "All the older guys
like me, Teyo, Chris and the
whole offensive line. We are all
leaders, and that's what is so
frustrating. We aren't pulling
our weight. The defense is play
ing well, and we just aren't
pulling our own weight."
As the Cardinal searches for
answers, some guys are step
ping up. Sophomore Kenneth
Tolon had a solid game at run
ning back, leading the team
with 91 yards on only 14 car
ries. Tolon sparked the Cardi
nal offense in the second half,
scoring the only Stanford
touchdown of the game.
On defense, sophomore safe
ty Oshiomogho Atogwe was the
Cardinal player of the game, in
tercepting a pass, sacking the
quarterback and recovering a
fumble.
Regardless of the defensive
play, the Cardinal was unable to
score with the constant penalties
and turnovers.
The problem for the Stan
ford team could he summa
rized by one play late in the
game. In the fourth quarter,
the Cardinal had a fourth-and
eight on the Cougar 23-yard
line. It decided to go for it,
only to lose five yards on a
delay of game penalty. Stan
ford still elected to go for the
first down, only to see Lewis
scramble out of bounds fora
gain of only six yards.
As long as no one steps up to
inspire the players, there is no
reason to think that things will
turn around any time soon.
"We need to make plays and
have more consistency,"
Teevens said.
