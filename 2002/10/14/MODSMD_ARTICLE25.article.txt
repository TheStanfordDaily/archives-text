# Team hopes to rebound after tough loss

### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Early season performances can
be excellent indicators of a team's
character. This week, the Stanford
men's golf team will try to get back
into a positive frame of mind after a
disappointing performance at the
Pepperdine Intercollegiate, which
was held last Monday and Tuesday.

Stanford finishes 1 1 th at the
Club Glove Intercollegiate

Even though it opened the sea
son with a third-place finish at the
Windon Memorial, the Cardinal
took a step backward in its last out
ing, dropping to the 11th spot in a
12-team field.
Today, the team travels to Fair
fax, Calif, to compete in the Alister
Mackenzie Invitational. The tour
nament will lake place at the
Meadow Club, and is named for
the man who designed the par-71,
6,602-yard track.
This is the first year fort he event,
and the venue promises to be a spe
cial one. The list of Mackenzie's
projects reads like a golfing vaca
tion itinerary: Cypress Point at Peb
ble Beach, Augusta National and
Royal Melbourne in Australia.
The field is arguably the
strongest that the Cardinal has
faced this year. Among the 17 teams
vying for this year's title are No. 5
UCLA and No. 10 Northwestern.
Also in the field is UC-Irvine. The
last time the Cardinal saw Irvine,
the Anteaters were raising both the
team and individual trophies at the
Pepperdine Intercollegiate.
In addition, Stanford will face
stiff competition from the Pacific
-10 Conference, as Oregon, Ore
gon State, Washington, Washing
ton State and host-team California
will also participate in the event.
"We are both pleased and ex
cited to be hosting the Alister
Mackenzie Invitational," Cal
head coach Steve Desimone said.

"It is something that we've want
ed to do fora long time. We have
a great field and a wonderful
venue in the Meadow Club.
We're looking forward to a
tremendous event."
Once again, the senior tandem
of Jim Seki and Ron Won will look
to lead the Cardinal c harge. While
Won was able to generate just two
top-25 finishes in eight events last
season, he has already reached
that mark this year with a pair of
15th-place performances.
Seki, too, has been outstanding.
He has notched third-place finish
es in both events this year and is
currently ranked No. 7 in the na
tion individually by Golfweek
magazine.
Coach Jeff Mitchell will shake

up the roster a bit this week, giving
junior Blake Mastalir some rest,
while starting senior Del deWindt
for the first time this season.
I he senior's leadership and ex
perience may be an important ele
ment for the Cardinal, as the re
maining two starters this week
have played just one collegiate
tournament between them.
Freshmen Kyle Gentry and
Scott Mac Donald round out the
team. In his only collegiate event
(the Windon Memorial), Gentry
finished in a tie for 65th place.
Mac Donald will be making his col
legiate debut.
In the individual competition,
there are plenty of big names to go
around. Tom Johnson of North
western and Conner Robbins of

Washington check in at the No. 3
and No. 4 spots in the nation, re
spectively. Irvine's Jeff Coburn en
ters the tournament coming off a
victory in I'epperdine, where he
won a one-hole playoff against
New Mexico's Jae Choi.
The Cardinal welcomes the
challenge as it looks to get back on
track after a rocky outing its last
time out.
"We are excited to compete
with teams like UCLA, Cal and
Oregon. UC-Irvine has also been
very strong the past couple sea
sons," Mitchell said.
Play at the Mackenzie Invita
tional will begin at 7:30 a.m. today,
and continue through 36 holes.
The final 18 holes of competition
will take place tomorrow at 8 a.m.
