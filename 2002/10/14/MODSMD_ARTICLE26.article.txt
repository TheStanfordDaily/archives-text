### SPENCER PORTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Its like deja vu all over again for the
Cardinal. As if taking a cue from Fox's
Mardi Cras-themed "Magical Matchups"
promo for the Major League Baseball
playoffs, the Stanford women's field
hockey team faced off'against No. 16 Cal
ifornia to decide supremacy in the North
ern Pacific Athletic Conference.
End result: Stanford must be cursed
while in Berkeley.
For the second time in two years, Stan
ford went across the Bay fora crucial
NorPac game, only to come back to the
Farm empty-handed. California downed
the Cardinal 2-1, scoring the winning
goal in the closing minutes of the game.
Over the last two seasons, the Cardinal

Women's Field Hockey
No. 16 California 2, Stanford 1
(8-8,4-1 NorPac) has still won 14 of its last
17 games against NorPac opposition,
with all three losses coming at the hands
of Cal (8-3,3-0 NorPac).
All three losses have been devastating.
Last year, all the Cardinal needed to do
was go to Berkeley and get a win, which
would have given ii the NorPac season
title. The second loss came in the NorPac
tournament title game in Berkeley. This
year, a win would have put the Cardinal
in the driver's seat in its quest fora con
ference championship.
As it stands now, the Cardinal are in a
precarious position, needing a win
against Cal to gain a share of the confer
ence title.
Despite the loss, Stanford was upbeat.
"We played the best game of our sea
son and never gave up [during] the en
tire 70 minutes, which it is why it is such
a heartbreaker that we lost," senior tri

captain Christina Williams said. "But
luckily we will see them again in three
weeks when we beat them on our home
field."
Cal scored early in the game to take it
to 1-0 when Anita Reyes notched her first
goal of the season off a penalty corner at
4:35.
The score remained 1-0 at halftime,
but not for long. Williams, taking a re
bounded shot at 37:59, scored a goal to tie
t lie game.
However, with just under two minutes
to play, Nora Feddersen slotted the win
ning goal forCal and catapulted the team
to first place in the NorPac standings.
The Cardinal outshot Cal 13-9 and has
outshot its opponent in 14 of its last IC>
games. Stanford also held a 10-7 edge in
penalty corners.
Stanford will have to wait for its te
match versus Cal; the Cardinal will first
play a pair of home nonconference
games. The first against Yale on Oct. 20 at
1 p.m. and the second versus UC-Santa
Barbara on Oct. 27 at 1 p.m.
