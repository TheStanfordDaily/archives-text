# Law school launches new tech institute
## 
### ANDREW HENDEL 
Last Tuesday, the Law School announced
the creation of the Center of E-Cominerce as
part of the Stanford Program in Law, Science
and Technology. The center will focus on the
growing field of e-commerce law and will act as
a forum for scholars, policy makers, attorneys
and executives.
Lan Ballon, chairman of the Internet and E-
Commerce Practice Group, will serve as execu
tive director.
"This center is unique among law schools in
bringing together both academics and business
leaders and leading in-house and law-firm

lawyers," Ballon said. "We intend to examine
trends in Internet law, evaluate where the law
is going and make constructive recommenda
tions to influence its future development."
Prof. Margaret Jane Radin, director of the
Law School's Program in Law, Science and
Technology and co-author of a new casebook
called "Internet Commerce: The Emerging
Legal Framework" saitl that Stanford is strate
gically the best place to locate the center.
"We need the center because the economic,
technological and legal context of e-commerce
is evolving and very complex," Radin said.
"Business decision makers and their counsel
have to implement strategies while this is still

evolving. Public debate needs to be more thor
ough and more deep and more attentive to all
sides of the picture."
At the center, students will learn from busi
ness leaders and practicing lawyers as well as
visiting scholars, policymakers and graduate
students from outside the United States.
Ballon said the program will be ground
breaking because it will bring in leading Inter
net practitioners, in-house lawyers from com
panies such as Yahoo! and Net IQ, and lop pro
fessors from Stanford.
The institute will serve as a center for inter-

disciplinary research and will offer
student research assistantships. It
will sponsor conferences, speakers
and other events.
In addition, the center is cur
rently developing a Web site to

provide Internet resources to its
students and also to the global
community.
Funding will come primarily
from interested alumni and cor
porate and law-firm supporters.
On Oct. 23, the center will host
its first conference, titled "Burst
of the Bubble: Legal Impact of
the Dot Com Collapse."
The keynote speakers will be

former Pay Pal Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Peter
Thiel, '89, JD '92. The confer

fallout from the dot-com collapse,
touching on issues such as litiga
tion trends, the management of
venture capital, corporate reor
ganization and bankruptcy, secu
rity of corporate networks and
the management of intellectual

property portfolios.
I "lie (Center of E-CCommerce will
join two other centers at the law
school as part of the Program in
