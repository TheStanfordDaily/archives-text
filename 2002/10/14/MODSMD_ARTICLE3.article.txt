Last Tuesday, the Law School announced
the creation of the Center of E-Cominerce as
part of the Stanford Program in Law, Science

technological and legal context of e-commerce
is evolving and very complex," Radin said.

sides of the picture."
At the center, students will learn from busi

students from outside the United States.

net practitioners, in-house lawyers from com
