# Community celebrates coming out
## 
### BRIAN CHANG 
"Genderqueer feminist dyke," "Straight but
not narrow," and "Sexpositive queer fag from
another country," proclaimed banners around
campus last week. Friday was National Coming
Out Day, and the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and
IYansgender community celebrated its identity
by tearing down old stereotypes.
"National Coming Out Day acknowledges
an entire year's worth of coming out. Coming
out is a process, and the event celebrates that
journey," said Ben Davidson, director of the
LGBT-CRC.
The event began in 1987 when half a million
gay-rights activists marched in Washington.
There, activists from all over the country decid
ed to commemorate their march annually with
National Coming Out Day. The movement
gradually spread nationwide, and by 1999,
Stanford had its first LGBT-sponsored Nation
al Coming Out Day.
Thursday evening's event, sponsored by the
Queer / Straight Social and Political Alliance
kicked oft' the weekend with a dessert-social
called "Openly Queer / Openly Allied." About
100 students attended the program, which wel
comed the queer and queer-allied alike.
Friday, the LGBT-CRC set up couches on
White Plaza for "Find Your Living Room," a
lunchtime celebration of diversity.
Booths near the exhibit advertised for orga
nizations like the Queers of Color Coalition at
Stanford, Queer and Questioning Asians and
Pacific Islanders, and Masque, an "art and liter
ary journal of queer expression." North of
Cuba provided musical entertainment. The
day concluded with the "Stanford Pride BBQ"

held at Gibbons Grove.
Davidson emphasized the necessity of host
ing a National Coming Out Day on campus.
"It's an accepting and tolerant campus," he
said, "but queer and questioning students don't
see their community as being accepting. We still
live in a society in which LGBT people don't
have the same civil lights as heterosexual peo
ple.
"It's not easy for anyone to anyone to ac
knowledge or celebrate being IX JBT or queer.
Stanford lias a long way to go," he added.
Junior Ellen Freytag, a staff member of the
LGBT-CRC, said that she sees some degree of
intolerance on campus.
"I lived in a four-class dorm my freshman
year, and groups of upper class boys would yell

iliings like 'lesbian' and 'dyke' at me."
The use of slurs like "dyke" or "fag" are still
common at Stanford, but, according to LGBT
CRC assistant director Elizabeth Warren, "We
describe ourselves with words like 'queer' to
empower ourselves. We reclaim the word so
I hat it cannot be used against us."
Freytag agreed that turning slurs around
empowers I he community.
"On a flyer advertising National Coming
Out Day, I'm holding up a sign iliai says 'gen
derqueer feminist dyke,'" she said. "I've re
claimed the term so that those who use ii offen
sively don't have as much power over me."
Davidson said he believes that National

Coming Out Day is not just for the
LGBT community.
"It's about living in the open,
whoever you may be," he said.
Senior Ming Wang agreed
with Davidson.
"It's not just coming out about
your sexuality. You can come out as

a slacker, a philosopher, or even
come out about your straightness."
"Straight allies risk disap
proval of religious communities,"
Davidson said.
Straight ally Orion Courtin, a
junior, said t hat "ft was not hard at
all for me to be a straight ally, not
nearly as hard as 'coming out'
would be. I'm a straight ally be
cause it's important to be open
minded and accepting of the
choices others make."
