# ASSU campaigns to get students to vote
## 
### NATALIE FARRELL 
In an effort to "Get Out the
Vote" for the Nov. 5 local, state
and congressional elections, stu
dent political groups are coordi
nating with leaders of various stu
dent organizations to encourage
voter registration and educate stu
dents on the issues.
According to the ASSU, this
year the focus will be on reaching
out to students who may not be
part of Stanford's political infra
structure by helping them regis
ter to vote and by providing
more opportunities for students
to become informed on issues
and candidates.
The ASSU, Stanford in Govern
ment, the NAACP and the various
political party groups are all work
ing to promote student voting.
"The truth is that the ASSU and
all the political groups can only
reach so far," said Monica Hene
stroza, president of the ASSU. "By
getting other groups involved we
will be able to get students more
excited and eager to vote."
The ASSU will hold a student
leader dinner next week to discuss
issues that are important to differ
ent groups on campus, like the In
terfraternity and Intersorority
Councils and how they might be
affected by legislation. I fenestroza
said she hopes these leaders will
carry the "Get Out the Vote" mes
sage back to their constituencies.
Sophomore Sarah Schulman,
ASSU senator and the program's
coordinator, described this year's
approach to student voting as

"two-pronged."
"First, we want to ensure that
students are registered. Second
ly, we want to inform t hem about
issues and candidates," Schul
man said.
I his year, the ASSU put voter
registration forms in all of the
New Student Orientation pack
ets. Henestroza said that even if
students didn't register to vote
with these forms, at least they
were exposed to the civic-mind
ed ness of Stanford.
According to 1 fenestroza, reg
istering to vote as a student can
be confusing. She also said that
many students don't know that
they have to re-register when
their residence changes, even
from dorm to dorm. She said this
can often leave students feeling
excluded on election day when
they are turned away. One of her
top priorities this year is to make
sure th;it students not only regis
ter, but re-register if necessary.
1 he Stanford in Government
Campus Awareness Committee is
working to inform students about
issues and candidates, which is the
other major goal of the "Get Out
the Vote" program. Hie commit
tee coordinators, junior Jason
Angel and sophomore Bonnie
Johnson, said that they are work
ing to create leaflets, pamphlets
and flyers as part of this effort.
"We want to help students lig
ure out who to vole for and what
it means to vote for someone,"
Angel said.
