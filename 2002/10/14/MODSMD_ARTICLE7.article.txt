Musical group Axiom of Choice
played to a packed Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium on Friday night, enter
taining a crowd of listeners from
Stanford and the surrounding
community.
Formed in 1992, the six-mem
ber ensemble — consisting of im
migrants of Middle Eastern and
southern European descent —
aimed to define a new sound with
in the context of Iranian music.
Based on traditional Iranian
melodies and modes, the group
said that its music has a universal
appeal because of its cohesive,
seamless and natural fusion with
other styles of music.
"We have two goals," said Loga
Ramin Torkian, the group's lead
guitarist, composer and artistic di
rector. "One is to create sounds
that belong to the Iranian immi
grant artist. [The other is that] Per
sian music has a lot of elements
that [are] very provocative to
Americans ... we like to tailor our
music for all Americans."

1 he group's second guitarist,
Dimitris Mahlis, said "I'm Greek,
[and] we share a lot of musical his
tory with the Persians. The spiritu
al aspect inspires me."
The musicians work within a
unique compositional structure in
which both improvisation and per
sonal expression can freely take
place, enabling them to incorpo
rate sounds from other cultures.
According to Mahlis, 40 percent of
the group's music consists of on
the-spot improvisation.
The event was sponsored by
the Graduate Student Council
and hosted by the Persian Stu
dent Association.
"The best thing that the audi
ence can get from the music is that
it is the traditional music for Iranian
immigrants," said the association's
president, Sina Zahedi, a doctoral
student in electrical engineering.
"This is distinctively Iranian
music," said sophomore Mahan
Esfahani. "If one can reach a non-
Iranian audience, we would have
achieved our goal."
Since U.S. President George
Bush's State of the Union Address

last January, Iran has been in the
spotlight as one of the members of
Bush's "Axis of Evil."
"This is PSA's first large event
since 9/11, and we wanted to in
vite the Stanford community to
experience a different side of
Iranian culture which is rarely
presented in the media," said
l)ara Ghahremani, a doctoral stu
dent in psychology.
"The rich music and poetry of

Iran has been with its people
through centuries and speaks uni
versally to all," he continued.
Kaveh I losseini, a doctoral stu
dent in aeronautics and astronau
tics, spoke ol the unifying power of
music.
"We want the people to enjoy it,
we want to create bonds," he said.
"We want to share the experience,

especially now ... we want to
show who Iranians are."
Members of the listening audi
ence described the event as a very
unique musical experience.
"It's very surreal; it's aina/ing
how they do it," said Lisa Wong, a
doctoral student in biophysics.
"You can't help but be energized."
According to Pedram keyani,
a master's student in computer
science, one of the major aspects
of the group's music is fusion
and "bringing Persian and
American styles [of music] to

gether, just like the Persian com
munity here."
The blending of diverse styles
of music iu Axiom's performance
underscored a motif of unity.
"It was very interesting," said
genetics graduate student Alok
Saldanha. "[lt| had a lot in com
mon with classical Indian Music."
"If it wasn't for the PSA, you
wouldn't get exposed to such a
musical experience," Torkian
added.
In addition to the guitarists,
Axiom of Choice consists of vocal
ist Mamak Khadem; duduk, clar
inet and zurna player Ruben
Haratoonian; and percussionists
Andre Harutyunyan and Doug
Lunn.
