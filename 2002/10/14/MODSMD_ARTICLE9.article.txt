## Hunt for D.C. sniper continues 
### 
ROCKVILLE, Md. (Al*) â€” Investigators hunting
an increasingly brazen sniper defended their meager
release of information, saying yesterday they don't
want the killer to know what they know.
Authorities pointed to the dangerous balance be
tween pleading for public help and revealing too
much.
"We don't want to release anything that may cause
anyone to think they're a suspect," said Bureau of Al
cohol, Tobacco and Firearms agent Mike Bouchard.
Montgomery County police Chief Charles Moose,
meanwhile, has cut back on his news briefings while
saying he wishes there was more he could reveal.
"I wish we could give you a name, <i mug shot and
an address but we're not at that point," he said in one
of four appearances he made yesterday on national
TV talk shows.
Moose has become the public face of a massive task
force investigating a random shooter who has fired a
single round into each of 10 victims, killing eight, in
suburban Washington since Oct. 2.
The last killing occurred Friday morning, when a
53-year-old father of six was shot while fueling his
sedan in a gas station just south of Fredericksburg,
Va. At the time, a state trooper stood just 50 yards
away, investigating a traffic accident.
Also yesterday, calls continued to flood tipster hot

lines with information about white box trucks and a
second while vehicle, a Chevrolet Astro van, seen at
two or more of the killing sites.
And authorities began describing the serial sniper
as not just a local threat, but an attempt to terrorize an
already anxious nation.
"This reminds us that people in our past have
tried to intimidate and put fear into Americans,"
Moose said. "This a strong nation . . . and we will not
be intimidated."
At the sprawling Covenant Life Church in
Caithersburg, Md., pastor C.J. Mahaney urged Sun
day worshippers to turn off their televisions and turn
to Cod.
"I am concerned there is too little faith and too
much fear," the preacher said from the pulpit.
Eighty-six-year-old Frances Pratt attended morn
ing services at St. George's Episcopal Church in Fred
ericksburg, a few miles north of the latest shooting.
"I don't worry," Pratt said. "Sooner or later he'll be
caught. They always are."
At Landover, Md., police on horseback and bi
cycles ringed parking areas before yesterday's
Washington Redskins pro football game against
the New Orleans Saints. Fans grilling burgers at
tailgate parties said they welcomed the rifle-tot
ing officers.
