## Alleged bin Laden letter praises attacks 
### 
CAIRO, Egypt (AP) â€” A signed statement
allegedly from Osama bin Laden claimed yes
terday that recent attacks in Yemen and Kuwait
were designed to coincide with the anniversary
of the war in Afghanistan and to send a "clear
and strong message" to the world that his al-
Qaida organization is still active.
The statement, which was faxed to the Al-
Jazeera network and posted on an Islamic Web
site, appeared to have been written on a com
puter, using an Arabic font that looks like
handwriting. The signature at the bottom is
similar to bin Laden's distinctive style, with a
loop at the end.
Still, there was no way to authenticate the
statement. Bin Laden's whereabouts are un
known and President Bush said yesterday: "We
don't know whether bin Laden is alive or
dead."
"We do know that al-Qaida's still dangerous,
and while we've made good progress, there is a
lot more work to do," Bush said.
Yesterday's statement accused the United
States of occupying Afghanistan and planning a
war in Iraq in order to conquer the Muslim
world. It praised two Kuwaitis who opened fire
on U.S. Marines as brothers-in-arms with the
Sept. 11 hijackers.
"The heroic Kuwait operation proved the
extent of the danger that confronts American
troops wherever they go in the Islamic world,"
the statement read.
"America is getting ready fora new round of
its crusade against the Islamic world, this time.
. . against the Muslim Iraqi people, aiming at
completing its plan to divide the Islamic nation
and tear it apart, looting its wealth, and prepar
ing for establishing the state of greater Israel
after expelling the Palestinians."
A copy faxed to Al-Jazeera on Monday was
nearly identical to one posted on an Islamic
Web site. It was addressed to "the Islamic na
tion, on the one-year anniversary of the begin
ning of the American new crusade war."

It was signed: "Your brother, Osama bin
Mohammed bin Laden."
Vince Cannistraro, a former counterterror
ism chief, believes the signature is real, but it
could have been duplicated from earlier state
ments. In that case, it wouldn't be a definite
confirmation bin Laden is alive. "It could be
'cut-and-paste,' " he said.
On Oct. 6, a French tanker was damaged in
an explosion in Yemen. The explosion is being
investigated as a terror attack and Yemeni offi
cials said they were looking at the possibility the
blast was caused by a small boat laden with ex
plosives. The USS Cole was attacked in a simi
lar fashion in Yemen in October 2000 in an act

blamed on bin Laden's al-Qaida network.
The U.S.-led bombing campaign in
Afghanistan began Oct. 7, 2001, three weeks
after the Sept. 1 1 terrorist attacks in the United
States.
"By exploding the oil tanker in Yemen, the
holy warriors hit the umbilical cord and lifeline
of the crusader community, reminding the
enemy of the heavy cost of blood and the grav
ity of losses they will pay as a price for their con
tinued aggression on our community and loot
ing of our wealth."
Bin Laden has often referred to Westerners
as "crusaders" and to Americans as "the
enemy."
