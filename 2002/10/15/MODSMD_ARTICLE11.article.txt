FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) —
A woman was killed outside a
Home Depot store yesterday
night, and police were trying to
determine whether the shooting
was related to the sniper spree re
sponsible for eight deaths in the
region in the past 12 clays.
"A female has been shot and
killed," said Fairfax County Police
Lt. Amy Lubas. The woman was
felled by a single shot at about 9:30
p.m., authorities said. All the other
deaths were also caused by one
shot, and two people also were
wounded by a single bullet.
Roads and highways were
being closed in the area, about 10
miles west of Washington, D.C.,
while the Maryland task force in
vestigating the sniper attacks con
ferred with Fairfax authorities to
see if yesterday's victim was the
sniper's ninth.
Virginia State Police said they
were on the lookout fora white
Chevrolet Astro van, last seen
traveling east on Route 50 from
Falls Church. The van's right rear
taillight was out. Interstates 66
and 1-95 are nearby. Witnesses at
some of the earlier shootings said
a white van or truck left those slay
ing scenes.
The victim's body lay under a
sheet in the parking lot in front of
the Home Depot, on the first floor
of a two-story structure, 30 yards
from the store entrance. The
Home Depot is in the Seven Cor

ners Shopping Center, a 450,000-
square-foot strip shopping center
with a parking garage.
Kristin Reed, a supervisor at
the Barnes 8c Noble bookstore in
the sprawling strip mall, said six
employees were locked inside the
store with an FBI agent.
"Cops and cops and more
cops," Reed said of the scene out
side. She said no one heard the
shot inside her store, hut "a cus
tomer had just walked outside,
then came back in and said '1 think
1 heard a shot.' "
Earlier yesterday, the longest
lull yet in the Washington sniper's
killing spree brought little relief as
jittery residents Hooded police
with calls upon hearing car back
fire, firecrackers or breaking glass.
"Everyone is edgy," said Mont
gomery County Police Chief
Charles Moose, who is heading
the investigation. "People are
hearing things that may normally
be overlooked."
President Bush said the "cold
blooded" attacks have made him
sick to his stomach. "I weep for
those who have lost their loved
ones," he said.
Authorities in Baltimore, mean
while, seized a white van and
found an assault rifle, sniper man
ual and ammunition similar to the
.223 bullets used in attacks that
have killed eight people and
wounded two others, WBAL-TV
reported.
