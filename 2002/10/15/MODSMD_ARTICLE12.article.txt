## The 						Stanford Daily University should seek transportation alternatives 
### 
Published Since 1891

The ever-elusive city of San Fran
cisco has gotten even farther
away for Stanford students, and
this time we have Caltrain to
blame. In order to remodel and expand its
services, Caltrain has ceased all running on
weekends, giving Stanford students one
more reason to stay in their rooms and
study.
We understand the Caltrain's need for
renovation and recognize that in the whole
scheme of things, providing transportation
for weekday commuters is paramount to stu
dents' weekend recreational desires. Howev
er, the alternative transportation initiatives
put forth by the Caltrain and the University
are less than adequate.
Currently, students are left with Caltrain's
substitute weekend bus service, which takes

longer and runs less frequently than the Cal
train. This is not a viable alternative to those
students who want to explore the Bay Area.
Now, more than ever, the University
needs to step up to the challenge of helping
its students get off campus.
We hope the administration is not dis
suaded by its failed past experiments with
creative transportation alternatives, includ
ing the weekend Marguerite service to San
Francisco and the short-lived car sharing
program.
With this year's more restrictive trans
portation options, it is imperative that the
University consult students and come up
with solutions to get them, especially car-less
freshmen, off of this campus.
Futhermore, the leaders of the ASSU in
their pledge to get more students involved

in the decision-making infrastructure
should take this opportunity to work with
the University in order to create trans
portation programs.
Why not create a student task force to start
looking into options? This is by no means an
unsolvable situation.
San Francisco and the entire Bay Area
offer students a much-needed check-in with
the numerous issues that members of the
larger community face.
There is more to life than just Stanford,
and when students aren't able to indulge
themselves in off-campus culture on a regu
lar basis, a little bit of outside perspective can
be lost.
Furthermore, there exists little diversity in
the Palo AJto social and cultural scene. Uni

For those students on campus who are not
interested in shopping or watching other
people shop, something must be done. San
Jose, San Francisco and Oakland help ex

and allow them to follow alternative musical

Hopefully when the Caltrain's expanded
service is completed in 2004, it will truly rep

accessible and affordable to working class
people and students.
Until then, it is up to the administration
and the ASSU to fund transportation pro

want to explore life beyond Stanford's
campus.
