# TALES FROM UNDERCLASS
## Freshman year rantings 
### 
I'm out here, putting my heart on my
sleeve, and my life on the line, to rant
about being a frosh. Freshmeat. Ev
eryone can remember the awkward
first few months of dorm life, figuring out
how to peacefully cohabitate with 80 other
freshmen, many of whom are members of
the opposite sex. The rough transition
from being an all-powerful senior in high
school to a lowly, stupid, pitiful freshman.
If you're in the class of 06, ("000-6" — I

can't believe I actually
have school spirit. When
did this happen?), I hope
you can gain some solace
knowing that we're all in
the same boat.
I promise somewhere
on campus at 8 a.m.,
someone is wondering
whether or not wearing a

"Chicks Dig Me" t-shirt would give people
the wrong impression, or at 3 a.m., the pre
vious night, someone is thinking that the
parallels between Plato and Saddam Hus
sein are so clearly the perfect thesis for an I-
Hum paper.
And to the upperclassmen who have
walked these roads before us, 1 hope you
can feel sympathetic towards us youngins,
and nostalgic for simpler times, when pro
fessors still accepted "I don't know where
Bldg. 70 is" as a valid excuse for being late
to section.
There are so many things I still need to
figure out, and I have so many questions
about how to survive life here at The Farm.
I still haven't learned all the wonderful
new rituals of dorm life. The dances we do
with each other. Now to take group show
ers — Do you wear sandals? Strip in your
room? In the shower stall? Where does
your towel go? If you put it in the stall, you
run a high risk of your towel getting soak
ing wet, but if you leave it outside, then you
need to take the naked walk of shame back
to get it. Does anyone else worry about
being the one in the hall who clogs the
shower drain with hair? Or clogging one of

the toilets?
When to dress? Should you go back to
your room to put on underwear, then come
back to shave? Is shaving with just a towel
permitted? Is preening in front of the full
length mirrors in the bathrooms allowable?
If you're a guy hanging out on an all girls
floor, and you really need to go pee, is it
okay to use the girls bathroom, or should
you break the rhythm of the conversation
and go off in search of a men's room?
And that's just the bathroom.
While I'm busy worrying about bath
room etiquette, I'm also trying to devote
the maximum amount of mental effort nec
essary to remembering people's names.
I still don't know all the guys on my
floor. And the 60 girls in my dorm? I can
name about 10. The worst part is that ev
eryone knows my name. And not just in my
dorm. Everyone I've ever met in my entire
life remembers my name. And not just my
first name, people remember the whole
thing "David Blackmail." People I knew in
first grade when I was a chubby kid with
long bangs and aviator glasses can recall my
name at first sight — 10 years later, me
twice as tall, twice as thin, hair three times as
long, facial hair and contacts. I have no idea
who they are. Not only do I need to greet all
these new faces and remember their
names, but I also need to come up with
things to talk about. Ever spend a day meet
ing people, retelling the same opening
numbers over and over again like a crappy
lounge warm-up act, feeling cheaper every
time you tell it? Just wondering.
I have this fear that failing to respond to
one of these challenges properly will deter
mine how people perceive me for the next
four years. Some minor faux pas in ()tero will
be a permanent stain upon my character.
But, I don't worry about self image at all.
That's definitely what these first few weeks
have taught me.

David Blackmail is an undeclared freshman.
