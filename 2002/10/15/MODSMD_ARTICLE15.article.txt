Hennessy reminds students of 'the im
portance of civil dialogue'
Later this week, on two separate occa
sions, the Stanford community will hear
from speakers with distinct perspectives
on current events. On Wednesday, for
mer Israeli prime minister and Stanford
alumnus Ehud Barak will speak; on Fri
day, poet and activist Amiri Baraka will
take the rostrum.
I write in advance of these speakers' ar
rivals to remind tlie entire Stanford com
munity of the importance of open, diverse
and civil dialogue, especially on the con
troversial and difficult issues facing our
nation and our world.
Earlier this month, at a memorial ser
vice for Stanford's renowned constitution
al scholar Gerald Gunther, President
Emeritus Gerhard Gasper recalled some
of Professor Gunther's most powerful
words. "University campuses," Gunther
wrote, "should exhibit greater, not less,
freedom of expression than prevails in so
ciety at large."
That Stanford should host these two
speakers in the same week is a vivid testa
ment to the high standard set by Professor
Gunther. These events epitomize the spe
cial role that the University plays as a place
where all people have the right to speak
freely, where divergent ideas can be ex
pressed without censure, where emphasis
is put on the intellectual content of the
idea rat her than the emotional sway of the
argument. I call on all members of our
community, no matter how passionate
they may feel about these matters, to en
gage in a civil dialogue about the issues
and ideas that the speakers raise.

This tradition runs deep at Stanford, as
reflected in the University's motto, "The
wind of freedom blows." I sincerely believe
that this is an opportunity for the Stanford
community to show our fellow citizens that
important social and political issues —
even contentious ones — can be addressed
in a way that embraces the best values of
free speech and academic freedom.

Former prof calls for renaming of Zapata
The Stanford Daily ran an editorial en
titled "Spanish immersion dorm deserves
a second chance" (Oct. 11). There is a long
history behind this. 1 arrived at Stanford
on Jan. 1,1942, invited to join the Stanford
faculty by Aurelio M. Espinosa, head of the
Romantic Languages Department.
He had a remarkable career. Born in
a poor, Hispanic village on the border
between New Mexico and Colorado, he
obtained a doctorate at the University
of Chicago, came to Stanford, and
made it a leader in the study of I lispan
ic studies as a founder of the American
Association of Teachers of Spanish and
its journal, Hispania.
Two of his sons became well-known
Hispanists. One, my friend Aurelio, now
living here in retirement, taught at Stan
ford for decades. He is a leading authority
on Spanish folklore. His sister, Margarita,
a Stanford graduate, became the principal
of the well-known Cast illeja School in Palo
Alto. After retiring, she joined the Peace
Corps to teach English in South Korea,
where my wife and I met her again. Her

dedication to her students was notewor
thy. She died recently, and she is sorely
missed. A memorial gathering will be held
on Oct. 25.
It should be evident that I have been
close to the Espinosa family, to whom
Stanford and Palo Alto owe so much.
At Stanford, 1 was invited to found the
Latin American program, and I estab
lished Bolivar House and the Casa Es
panola, a University residence devoted to
total immersion in the Spanish language
and to Spanish culture. Both were very
successful, but both were destroyed by the
University administration. Bolivar House
was an internationally known research
center. At present, it is just a shadow of
what it was. Without a word to me, the
Spanish 1 louse was closed.
The Espinosa family was Catholic and
conservative. Indue course, the Spanish
House was replaced by Zapata House,
named after a Mexican revolutionary who
had no link with Stanford and was dedicat
ed to promoting the revolutionary ideas
which were popular on campus at the time.
I have long been trying to have Zapata
House renamed Espinosa House, in
honor of the family that has done so much
lot Stanford, and to have its language and
culture mission restored. Every time, my
initiative has led nowhere. It was referred
to the Housing Committee, where it died
a natural death.
The death of Margarita Espinosa
prompts me once more to raise this issue.
In view of the importance of the Hispanic
world, it deserves proper attention.

take the rostrum.
I write in advance of these speakers' ar
rivals to remind tlie entire Stanford com
munity of the importance of open, diverse
and civil dialogue, especially on the con
troversial and difficult issues facing our
nation and our world.
Earlier this month, at a memorial ser
vice for Stanford's renowned constitution
al scholar Gerald Gunther, President
Emeritus Gerhard Gasper recalled some
of Professor Gunther's most powerful
words. "University campuses," Gunther
wrote, "should exhibit greater, not less,
freedom of expression than prevails in so
ciety at large."
That Stanford should host these two
speakers in the same week is a vivid testa
ment to the high standard set by Professor
Gunther. These events epitomize the spe
cial role that the University plays as a place
where all people have the right to speak
freely, where divergent ideas can be ex
pressed without censure, where emphasis
is put on the intellectual content of the
idea rat her than the emotional sway of the
argument. I call on all members of our
community, no matter how passionate
they may feel about these matters, to en
gage in a civil dialogue about the issues
and ideas that the speakers raise.

This tradition runs deep at Stanford, as
reflected in the University's motto, "The
wind of freedom blows." I sincerely believe
that this is an opportunity for the Stanford
community to show our fellow citizens that
important social and political issues —
even contentious ones — can be addressed
in a way that embraces the best values of
free speech and academic freedom.

Former prof calls for renaming of Zapata
The Stanford Daily ran an editorial en
titled "Spanish immersion dorm deserves
a second chance" (Oct. 11). There is a long
history behind this. 1 arrived at Stanford
on Jan. 1,1942, invited to join the Stanford
faculty by Aurelio M. Espinosa, head of the
Romantic Languages Department.
He had a remarkable career. Born in
a poor, Hispanic village on the border
between New Mexico and Colorado, he
obtained a doctorate at the University
of Chicago, came to Stanford, and
made it a leader in the study of I lispan
ic studies as a founder of the American
Association of Teachers of Spanish and
its journal, Hispania.
Two of his sons became well-known
Hispanists. One, my friend Aurelio, now
living here in retirement, taught at Stan
ford for decades. He is a leading authority
on Spanish folklore. His sister, Margarita,
a Stanford graduate, became the principal
of the well-known Cast illeja School in Palo
Alto. After retiring, she joined the Peace
Corps to teach English in South Korea,
where my wife and I met her again. Her

dedication to her students was notewor
thy. She died recently, and she is sorely
missed. A memorial gathering will be held
on Oct. 25.
It should be evident that I have been
close to the Espinosa family, to whom
Stanford and Palo Alto owe so much.
At Stanford, 1 was invited to found the
Latin American program, and I estab
lished Bolivar House and the Casa Es
panola, a University residence devoted to
total immersion in the Spanish language
and to Spanish culture. Both were very
successful, but both were destroyed by the
University administration. Bolivar House
was an internationally known research
center. At present, it is just a shadow of
what it was. Without a word to me, the
Spanish 1 louse was closed.
The Espinosa family was Catholic and
conservative. Indue course, the Spanish
House was replaced by Zapata House,
named after a Mexican revolutionary who
had no link with Stanford and was dedicat
ed to promoting the revolutionary ideas
which were popular on campus at the time.
I have long been trying to have Zapata
House renamed Espinosa House, in
honor of the family that has done so much
lot Stanford, and to have its language and
culture mission restored. Every time, my
initiative has led nowhere. It was referred
to the Housing Committee, where it died
a natural death.
The death of Margarita Espinosa
prompts me once more to raise this issue.
In view of the importance of the Hispanic
world, it deserves proper attention.
