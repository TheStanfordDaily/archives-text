# Classes join to finance Full Moon
## 
### ELIZABETH MADJLESSI STAFF WRITER 
Two years alter the Alumni As
sociation passed on to 11 it* senior
class the duty of funding Stanford's
infamous Full Moon on the Quad,
this year's senior (hiss presidents
are seeking to make the event a
more collaborative effort by solicit
ing financial support from organi
zations and other classes.
In summer of 2001, the associa
tion— which had traditionally
sponsored the Farm's annual scan
dalous freshman initiation — gave
notice that it would no longer fund
the event, leaving ii to the senior
class presidents to ensure that the
tradition would continue.
"When [the association's] stu
dent programs department reorga
nized, we decided that our depart
ment needed to shift resources,"
said Victor Madrigal '95, director of
the association's student programs.
"I needed to make sure that our
programs were more complimenta
ry to our department goals, which
are to develop alumni-student net
works, to foster class identity, to nur
ture a pride for Stanford and to cre
ate an effective volunteer pipeline."
year, because Full Moon on
the Quad had no official sponsor,
the senior class presidents overtook
the endeavor — however, because

of this year's especially large senior
class, the class budget is too tight for
the senior class to hold the event
without outside help.
"[Administrators] asked us if we
wanted to fund and plan this event
this year," said senior James Alva,
one of four senior class presidents.
"I lowever, it costs about $2,000 to
hold Full Moon on the Quad, and
the senior class budget is $30,000,
so we have been working with dif
ferent groups [to defray] the cost. .
. this event has a lot of support."
I he freshman and senior class
are each contributing $400, while
the sophomore and junior classes
are contributing $200. The ASSU
Undergraduate Senate and the
Stanford Band are also making fi
nancial contributions.
I he heaviest cost for the event is
security, followed by the cost for
the microphone, sound system,
stage and clean-up.
This year, Full Moon on the
Quad will take place on Oct. 21.
Some students see the event as
an important part of the history of
the University.
"All the classes should support
it, just to make sure it stays a Stan
lord tradition," said junior Jade
Hwa, who will be attending the
event as a peer health educator but
not a participant.
"Students are missing out on the

traditions we've had in the past,
which makes it important to save
the ones we can," Alva said.
"i have mixed feelings about the
event itself, but I can understand
and respect the decisions by other
groups, including the presidents,
to step up in the name of maintain
ing a school tradition that most
people seem to enjoy," said senior
Miciiael Areinoff, a resident assis
tant in Donner. "I won't be going
this year, though."
"I'm going to tell the freshmen
in my dorm to stay sober enough to
make good decisions and not to
kiss the Tree," Areinoff added.
As an alumnus, Madrigal recalls
the event from his freshman year,
though he did not attend his senior
year.
"Full Moon on the Quad lias
taken a different direction than
when I first attended my freshman
year oh so many years ago," he
said. "The Full Moon on the Quads
that 1 witnessed in 1999 and 2000
as a staff member on security watch
were vastly different than what I
saw October of 1990 as a frosh."
"The event started off simply as
a spur-of-the moment gathering of
students—no official sponsor, no
organizers, just a spontaneous
combustion of student pride and
enthusiasm," Madrigal said.
In the early '90s, the senior class

presidents and the association
added features to the event such as
a DJ, a contest, a stage, lights, secu
rity and newspaper advertising. As
advisors to the senior class presi
dents and as sponsors of the Stan
ford Student Alumni Network, the
association indirectly ended up
funding the event because the net
work was under its umbrella.
" The association has since shift
ed its resources to Sophomore Aca
demic Dinners, Junior Alumni
Night, Senior Send-Off, Cardinal
Class Core and other activities and
products that support our depart

ment's mission and that better
serve the needs of students,"
Madrigal said. "While we were glad
to lend our support fora few years,
the association is comfortable with
the fact that the student leadership
and student interest is what is now
driving the event," Madrigal said.
"College traditions are only as
strong as the students that partici
pate in them," he added. "Ulti
mately, 1 believe that students will
enjoy campus traditions more if
such traditions are born, nurtured
and supported by the students that
enjoy them."

year, the senior class will fund Full Moon on the Quad with help from the
other classes, the ASSU and the Stanford Band.
