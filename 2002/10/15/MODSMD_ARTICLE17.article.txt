## Goalie keeps Card on top of Pac-10 
### MATT BABIN STAFF WRITER 
It's rare fora goalkeeper to
post eight shutouts in the first 11
games of a season and not get all
the attention. But on a Stanford
squad that also presents a bal
anced attack with potential scor
ers all over the field and one of the
fastest back lines in collegiate soc
cer, sometimes redshirt sopho
more keeper Nicole Barnhart
gets overlooked. Shutouts be
come routine, almost expected.

Sunday: Stanford 1, No. 12 UCLA 0

Routine, though, could hardly
be used to describe Barn hart's play
this weekend. Barnhart stole Sun
day's game from No. 12 UCLA,
enabling the Cardinal to return
from Los Angeles with two wins
and an early season Pacific-10
Conference lead. The Cardinal de

UCLA. 1-0.
The weekend began Friday af

In what became a pattern for the
weekend, the Cardinal struck
early. Sophomore striker Natalie
Sanderson converted a penalty
kick in the 4th minute to put the

visitors ahead early.
It was a lead the Cardinal never
relinquished.
The Women of Troy battled
back immediately with a counter
attack that had good scoring
chances in the 10th and 11th min
utes, although they were unable
to convert.
Stanford put more pressure on
USC for the duration of the half,
but despite junior striker Marcie
Ward hitting the post and the
crossbar with two consecutive
shots, Stanford only led 1-0 at
halftime.
The Women of Troy pressured
the Cardinal early in the second
half. Jessica Edwards had a good
scoring chance just four minutes
in, but Barnhart was again there
for the Cardinal to keep USC off
the board.
It took the skills of recently-re
turned senior midfielder Kelsey
Carlson for Stanford to score
again. Carlson, back in the lineup
sooner than expected after badly
spraining her ankle three weeks
ago against Tennessee, threaded
a pass to junior midfielder Brit
tany Oliveira in the 66th minute,
but Oliveira's shot was just wide of
the mark.
But a minute later, Ward took

Kim Glass hits around Stanford senior Logan Tom last weekend. The No. 6 Stanford women's
volleyball team suffered its second loss in two weeks, as it fell to No. 19 Arizona in five games
one night after the Cardinal handily defeated Arizona State in Tempe, Ariz.
