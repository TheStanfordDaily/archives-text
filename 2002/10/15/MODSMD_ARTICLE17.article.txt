## Goalie keeps Card on top of Pac-10 
### MATT BABIN STAFF WRITER 
It's rare fora goalkeeper to
post eight shutouts in the first 11
games of a season and not get all
the attention. But on a Stanford
squad that also presents a bal
anced attack with potential scor
ers all over the field and one of the
fastest back lines in collegiate soc
cer, sometimes redshirt sopho
more keeper Nicole Barnhart
gets overlooked. Shutouts be
come routine, almost expected.

Sunday: Stanford 1, No. 12 UCLA 0

Routine, though, could hardly
be used to describe Barn hart's play
this weekend. Barnhart stole Sun
day's game from No. 12 UCLA,
enabling the Cardinal to return
from Los Angeles with two wins
and an early season Pacific-10
Conference lead. The Cardinal de
feated Southern California 2-0 and
UCLA. 1-0.
The weekend began Friday af
ternoon with a match against (JSC.
In what became a pattern for the
weekend, the Cardinal struck
early. Sophomore striker Natalie
Sanderson converted a penalty
kick in the 4th minute to put the

visitors ahead early.
It was a lead the Cardinal never
relinquished.
The Women of Troy battled
back immediately with a counter
attack that had good scoring
chances in the 10th and 11th min
utes, although they were unable
to convert.
Stanford put more pressure on
USC for the duration of the half,
but despite junior striker Marcie
Ward hitting the post and the
crossbar with two consecutive
shots, Stanford only led 1-0 at
halftime.
The Women of Troy pressured
the Cardinal early in the second
half. Jessica Edwards had a good
scoring chance just four minutes
in, but Barnhart was again there
for the Cardinal to keep USC off
the board.
It took the skills of recently-re
turned senior midfielder Kelsey
Carlson for Stanford to score
again. Carlson, back in the lineup
sooner than expected after badly
spraining her ankle three weeks
ago against Tennessee, threaded
a pass to junior midfielder Brit
tany Oliveira in the 66th minute,
but Oliveira's shot was just wide of
the mark.
But a minute later, Ward took

another pass from Carlson and
buried it past the Trojan keeper for
the Cardinal's second, and final,
goal of the night.
After taking the conference
opener, the Cardinal headed
across town on Sunday afternoon
to take on the Bruins in a rematch
of last year's Pac-10 title con
tenders. The Bruins, perhaps con
fident after beating the Cardinal
for the conference crown last year,
came out strong.
Perhaps a little too strong,
however, as a foul in the sth
minute of play gave the Cardinal
a free kick just outside the Bruin
box. Senior midfielder Callie
Withers converted the spot piece
into the Cardinal's second early
lead of the weekend.
"The opportunities presented
themselves. They were both off of
free kicks, and we took advantage
and attacked," co-coach Stephanie
Erickson said, describing the early
Cardinal leads in both games this
weekend.
'Hie Cardinal was only able to
get off one more shot in the first half
as UCLA kept up intense pressure
and made it hard for Stanford to get
going.
The second half proved that the
first half was no fluke. The Bruins
kept up the pressure and presented
the Stanford defense with one of the
most solid attacks it has seen this sea
son. The Bruins outshot the Cardi

nal 10-3 in the second half yet still re
mained without a goal.
"[Barnhart] kept us in that
game," Erickson said. "She's one of
(lie best keepers in the country."
Few would have disagreed with
that statement Sunday afternoon
as Barnhart recorded six saves, in
cluding an incredible diving save
in the 77th minute and a clutch
save on a Bruin free kick in the

88th minute.
"It was amazing," Erickson said.
"I'd say that they had three clear
scoring chances, chances that make
your heart sink, and she came up
with them. She had her best perfor
mance in a regular-season game.
Absolutely amazing."
The Cardinal heads home after
the first weekend of conference
play with two wins and an early

lead in a competitive conference
with dangerous opponents still to
be played.
"It's tough to get two road wins
at the L.A. schools," Erickson said.
"This is a great way to start. It's a
confidence builder. It's good to
have everything in our control. We
don't have to worry about what
other teams do. Our season is still
under our control."

Sunday: Stanford 1, No. 12 UCLA 0

Routine, though, could hardly
be used to describe Barn hart's play
this weekend. Barnhart stole Sun
day's game from No. 12 UCLA,
enabling the Cardinal to return
from Los Angeles with two wins
and an early season Pacific-10
Conference lead. The Cardinal de
feated Southern California 2-0 and
UCLA. 1-0.
The weekend began Friday af
ternoon with a match against (JSC.
In what became a pattern for the
weekend, the Cardinal struck
early. Sophomore striker Natalie
Sanderson converted a penalty
kick in the 4th minute to put the

visitors ahead early.
It was a lead the Cardinal never
relinquished.
The Women of Troy battled
back immediately with a counter
attack that had good scoring
chances in the 10th and 11th min
utes, although they were unable
to convert.
Stanford put more pressure on
USC for the duration of the half,
but despite junior striker Marcie
Ward hitting the post and the
crossbar with two consecutive
shots, Stanford only led 1-0 at
halftime.
The Women of Troy pressured
the Cardinal early in the second
half. Jessica Edwards had a good
scoring chance just four minutes
in, but Barnhart was again there
for the Cardinal to keep USC off
the board.
It took the skills of recently-re
turned senior midfielder Kelsey
Carlson for Stanford to score
again. Carlson, back in the lineup
sooner than expected after badly
spraining her ankle three weeks
ago against Tennessee, threaded
a pass to junior midfielder Brit
tany Oliveira in the 66th minute,
but Oliveira's shot was just wide of
the mark.
But a minute later, Ward took

another pass from Carlson and
buried it past the Trojan keeper for
the Cardinal's second, and final,
goal of the night.
After taking the conference
opener, the Cardinal headed
across town on Sunday afternoon
to take on the Bruins in a rematch
of last year's Pac-10 title con
tenders. The Bruins, perhaps con
fident after beating the Cardinal
for the conference crown last year,
came out strong.
Perhaps a little too strong,
however, as a foul in the sth
minute of play gave the Cardinal
a free kick just outside the Bruin
box. Senior midfielder Callie
Withers converted the spot piece
into the Cardinal's second early
lead of the weekend.
"The opportunities presented
themselves. They were both off of
free kicks, and we took advantage
and attacked," co-coach Stephanie
Erickson said, describing the early
Cardinal leads in both games this
weekend.
'Hie Cardinal was only able to
get off one more shot in the first half
as UCLA kept up intense pressure
and made it hard for Stanford to get
going.
The second half proved that the
first half was no fluke. The Bruins
kept up the pressure and presented
the Stanford defense with one of the
most solid attacks it has seen this sea
son. The Bruins outshot the Cardi

nal 10-3 in the second half yet still re
mained without a goal.
"[Barnhart] kept us in that
game," Erickson said. "She's one of
(lie best keepers in the country."
Few would have disagreed with
that statement Sunday afternoon
as Barnhart recorded six saves, in
cluding an incredible diving save
in the 77th minute and a clutch
save on a Bruin free kick in the

88th minute.
"It was amazing," Erickson said.
"I'd say that they had three clear
scoring chances, chances that make
your heart sink, and she came up
with them. She had her best perfor
mance in a regular-season game.
Absolutely amazing."
The Cardinal heads home after
the first weekend of conference
play with two wins and an early

lead in a competitive conference
with dangerous opponents still to
be played.
"It's tough to get two road wins
at the L.A. schools," Erickson said.
"This is a great way to start. It's a
confidence builder. It's good to
have everything in our control. We
don't have to worry about what
other teams do. Our season is still
under our control."
