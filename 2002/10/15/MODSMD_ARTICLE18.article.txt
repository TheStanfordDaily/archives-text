# Arizona upsets volleyball in dramatic form
## 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
There seems to be a growing sense that the Cardi
nal's resident comeback women may have used up all
of their volleyball karma during last year's NCAA
championship season.

Women's Volleyball
Thursday: No. 6 Stanford def. No. 21 Arizona State 30-20,
30-18,30-16
Friday: No. 19 Arizona def. Stanford 25-30, 17-30, 30-16,
32-30, 15-13

The Stanford women's volleyball team pulled off
no fewer than four epic come-from-behind wins — in
cluding unforgettable comebacks in both the NCAA
semifinal and championship match — last year.
But on Friday, the Cardinal (14-3, 5-2 Pacific-10
Conference) found itself on the raw end of a back
from-the-dead performance for the second time in as
many weeks.
No. 19 Arizona (8-7, 3-4) overcame a 2-0 deficit to
knock off Stanford in five games in front of 9,141
in Tucson.
The loss, which came just a week after the Cardinal
missed seven match points in losing to No. 1 Southern
California in five games at Maples Pavilion, leaves
Stanford a game and a half behind the Trojans in the
Pac-10 race and dropped the Cardinal two spots to
No. 6 in the national rankings.
The largest crowd ever fora Pac-10 game saw the
Wildcats get their revenge on
Stanford, which had overcome a 2-
0 deficit to win in live games in the
teams' previous meeting on Nov.
17,2001.
"When the crowd breaks the
Pac-10 record, you never expect
that," coach John Dunning said.
"It was very exciting, and they got
excited and it affected the match.
Wecould've played a lot better but
we didn't, and we know we need to
do something about that."
Heading into the intermission,
a Cardinal sweep seemed in
evitable. Stanlord dominated the
first two games, outhitting the
Wildcats .413 to .20(5 behind nine
kills from senior outside hitter
Logan Tom, who was attacking at
a .750 clip. Sophomore outside hit
ter Ogonna Nnamani had also
picked up an additional eight kills
as the Cardinal jumped way ahead
with 30-25 and 30-17 wins in the
opening games.
But the third game was possibly
the most disastrous the Cardinal
has played all year.
The Wildcats took the lead lor
good on a five-point run that put

them up 13-10, and from there,
things just fell apart on the Stan
ford side of the court.
Arizona middle blockers Shan
non Torregrosa and Bre Ladd
ripped apart the Cardinal at the
net and from the service line. The
two teamed up on three blocks and
combined for four kills in the sec
ond half of the game. Torregrosa
rattled off four straight aces to help
blow away Stanford 30-10.
"There were a lot of things lack
ing," senior defensive specialist
Lindsey Yamasaki said. "They
were lacking when we were win
ning too. We seem to clamp up
when the pressure gets on and go
our separate ways. When things
weren't going well, everything
went downhill."
The Cardinal was forced into
nine hitting errors on its way to a sea
son-low .000 hitting percentage in
the game.
"We got distracted fora while.
Our passing overall wasn't that
bad, but game three was not a pret
ty sight," Dunning said.
Though the huge crowd was os
tensibly there to take part in Ari
zona basketball's Midnight Mad
ness festivities that took place alter
the volleyball match, the big Wild
cat win in the third game got (he
fans into the contest.

Stanford fought off two game
points in i lie fourth game, but fell
32-30 to force a decisive fifth game.
A pair of timely blocks by Tor
regrosa and a couple of untimely
Stanford service errors from Tom
and senior outside hitter Ashley
Ivy made all the difference in the
final game. 'I'he Wildcats outhit
the Cardinal .3(58 to .207 in the 15-
13 fifth-game win.
"We need to practice 15-point
games whenever we can and do
drills that put us under pressure,"
Robinson said. "We can't make er
rors, and that's the way you win a
15-point game."
Both teams finished the night
hitting .273, but Arizona had the
edge in blocks (12.5-12), digs (60-
54) and aces (12-5).
Arizona 112 reshman outside hitter
Kim Glass led the Wildcats with 28
kills on the night.
Tom finished with a team-high
22 kills on a .419 hitting clip in
addition to coming up with 11
digs, just one fewer than Ivy's
team-leading total. Nnamani and
junior middle blocker Sara
McGee also finished with 17 kills
apiece.
Stanford, which didn't lose any
five-game matches last season, is 0-
2 in fifth-games this year.
Just to add a touch of insult to

injury, unranked California
knocked off the Wildcats in three
games on Saturday.
Meanwhile, Stanford entered
the Arizona match coming off one
of its most dominating perfor
mances of the season in its 75-
minute crushing of No. 21 Arizona
State on Thursday.
The Cardinal never trailed by
more than a point in the 30-20,30-
18, 30-16 win in Tempe.
Tom led both teams with 16
kills and 13 digs, as Stanford deci
sively outkilled (50-33), outhit
(.371-.035), outblocked (16-4) and
outdug (42-40) the Sun Devils.
The Cardinal defense squashed
Arizona State's big threat, outside
hitter Juliana Escobar, forcing her
to 12 errors with only eight kills for
a -.105 hitting percentage.
"We scared [the Sun Devils]
with our block, and they just
couldn't get past it," Dunning said.
"So they didn't play well after that
at all. It was good volleyball on our
side of the net, and we started out
the same for the first two games
against Arizona. We have to learn
to keep it up."
Stanford hits the court again
on Thursday at Maples to take on
No. 17 Washington State, the
Cardinal's fifth straight ranked
opponent.

couldn't get past it," Dunning said.

the same for the first two games

Women's Volleyball
Thursday: No. 6 Stanford def. No. 21 Arizona State 30-20,
30-18,30-16
Friday: No. 19 Arizona def. Stanford 25-30, 17-30, 30-16,
32-30, 15-13

The Stanford women's volleyball team pulled off
no fewer than four epic come-from-behind wins — in
cluding unforgettable comebacks in both the NCAA
semifinal and championship match — last year.
But on Friday, the Cardinal (14-3, 5-2 Pacific-10
Conference) found itself on the raw end of a back
from-the-dead performance for the second time in as
many weeks.
No. 19 Arizona (8-7, 3-4) overcame a 2-0 deficit to
knock off Stanford in five games in front of 9,141
in Tucson.
The loss, which came just a week after the Cardinal
missed seven match points in losing to No. 1 Southern
California in five games at Maples Pavilion, leaves
Stanford a game and a half behind the Trojans in the
Pac-10 race and dropped the Cardinal two spots to
No. 6 in the national rankings.
The largest crowd ever fora Pac-10 game saw the
Wildcats get their revenge on
Stanford, which had overcome a 2-
0 deficit to win in live games in the
teams' previous meeting on Nov.
17,2001.
"When the crowd breaks the
Pac-10 record, you never expect
that," coach John Dunning said.
"It was very exciting, and they got
excited and it affected the match.
Wecould've played a lot better but
we didn't, and we know we need to
do something about that."
Heading into the intermission,
a Cardinal sweep seemed in
evitable. Stanlord dominated the
first two games, outhitting the
Wildcats .413 to .20(5 behind nine
kills from senior outside hitter
Logan Tom, who was attacking at
a .750 clip. Sophomore outside hit
ter Ogonna Nnamani had also
picked up an additional eight kills
as the Cardinal jumped way ahead
with 30-25 and 30-17 wins in the
opening games.
But the third game was possibly
the most disastrous the Cardinal
has played all year.
The Wildcats took the lead lor
good on a five-point run that put

them up 13-10, and from there,
things just fell apart on the Stan
ford side of the court.
Arizona middle blockers Shan
non Torregrosa and Bre Ladd
ripped apart the Cardinal at the
net and from the service line. The
two teamed up on three blocks and
combined for four kills in the sec
ond half of the game. Torregrosa
rattled off four straight aces to help
blow away Stanford 30-10.
"There were a lot of things lack
ing," senior defensive specialist
Lindsey Yamasaki said. "They
were lacking when we were win
ning too. We seem to clamp up
when the pressure gets on and go
our separate ways. When things
weren't going well, everything
went downhill."
The Cardinal was forced into
nine hitting errors on its way to a sea
son-low .000 hitting percentage in
the game.
"We got distracted fora while.
Our passing overall wasn't that
bad, but game three was not a pret
ty sight," Dunning said.
Though the huge crowd was os
tensibly there to take part in Ari
zona basketball's Midnight Mad
ness festivities that took place alter
the volleyball match, the big Wild
cat win in the third game got (he
fans into the contest.

Stanford fought off two game
points in i lie fourth game, but fell
32-30 to force a decisive fifth game.
A pair of timely blocks by Tor
regrosa and a couple of untimely
Stanford service errors from Tom
and senior outside hitter Ashley
Ivy made all the difference in the
final game. 'I'he Wildcats outhit
the Cardinal .3(58 to .207 in the 15-
13 fifth-game win.
"We need to practice 15-point
games whenever we can and do
drills that put us under pressure,"
Robinson said. "We can't make er
rors, and that's the way you win a
15-point game."
Both teams finished the night
hitting .273, but Arizona had the
edge in blocks (12.5-12), digs (60-
54) and aces (12-5).
Arizona 112 reshman outside hitter
