# Football looks to limit miscues

### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
After its third straight game
giving up more than twice as
many points as it scored, the Stan
ford football team (1-4, 0-2 Pacif
ic- 10 Conference) finds itself des
perately searching fora way to
make plays.
Fortunately for the Cardinal,
this weekend's opponent, Arizona
(3-3,0-2), is the weakest remaining
team on its schedule. The Cardinal
is in dire need of a confidence in
fusion, and for that reason, Satur
day's very winnable game is its best
chance to right the ship before the
murderous schedule resumes with
road trips to UCLA (4-2, 1-1) and
No. 6 Oregon (6-0, 2-0)
But after losing 65-24 to Ari
zona State (5-2,2-0), 31-7 to No. 7
Notre Dame (6-0) and 36-11 to
No. 10 Washington State (6-1, 3-
0) — games that were played the
way its opponents wanted them to
be played — the Cardinal will
look to set the tone early against
the Wildcats.
One thing Stanford will focus
on is discipline. The loss to the
Cougars featured an embarrass
ing seven penalties for inappro
priate personal conduct — five
personal fouls and two roughing
the-passer calls.
Not only did those penalties

negate a possible scoring drive and
nullify an interception, they also
reflected poorly on a football pro
gram that has an established repu
tation.
"I think they were frustrated,
but you can't really tell because
they're a dirty team," said Cougar
defensive lineman Rien Long.
"They've got their ways of doing
things that aren't quite legal."
Under former coach Tyrone
Willingham, the Cardinal was pe
nalized only 60 times in its 1 1 reg
ular-season games last year. This
year's squad, less than halfway
through the season, has already
racked up 50 penalties.
On the plus side, the defense,
having spotted the Cougars all the
points they would need by half
time, regrouped and played well
in the second half. Though it has
consistently allowed a lot of points,
the defense has done a nice job of
forcing turnovers and giving the
offense some big chances.
Sophomore safety Osh
iomogho Atogwe stood out above
all other defenders on Saturday.
He had four tackles, a pass deflec
tion, a 16-yard sack which forced a
fumble and a fumble recovery that
he returned 42 yards to set up the
Cardinal's first points of the after
noon.
On offense, coach Buddy
Teevens once again chose to run

out the clock and hasten the end of
a blowout loss, and once again run
ning back Kenneth Tolon looked
good doing so. The sophomore
gained 89 yards on only 14 carries
and scored the Cardinal's only
touchdown after starting senior
Kerry Carter managed only 55
yards on 18 carries while playing
against the Cougars' first-string
defense.
Most of the Cardinal's success
ful drives this year have been the
result of good running, but given
its tendency for allowing a lot of
points, Stanford needs a decent
passing game to keep up in the
track meet that is the Pac-10.
No one doubts that the talent is
there, but Lewis, whom Teevens
insists is still the starter, despite the
usual in-game musical-chairs sub
stitutions of freshman Kyle Matter,
is obviously pressing.
Lewis has a Pac-10-worst 10 in
terceptions — despite sitting out
the season opener at Boston Col
lege — and has struggled with his
accuracy at times this season. The
Cardinal didn't complete a single
20-yard pass on Saturday with ei
ther Lewis or Matter at the helm,
and with a run-first offensive
scheme that didn't look downfield,
it is not surprising that the Cardi
nal found the Cougar defense to

be right on top of things.
Stanford has done a good job of
correcting its early-season fum
bling problem, and its special
teams looked decent on Saturday.
Though freshman Michael
Sgroi was wide on a 41-yard field

goal attempt at the end of the first
half, he did connect on a 28-yarder
later on. He also kept plenty of air
underneath his kickoffs, allowing
the coverage to hold the Cougars
to only 67 yards on four returns.
Junior punter Eric Johnson,
who could be the most improved
member of the Cardinal, has
demonstrated great hangtime,
and Stanford's punt-coverage unit
allowed only one 5-yard return

against Washington State.
However, Stanford hasn't done
much with its own return game so
far. Junior All-American punt re
turner Luke Powell has yet to
break a long runback, and senior
Ryan Wells is the least effective
kick returner in the Pac-10, with a
season long of just 22 yards.
Though it may seem like the
Cardinal has regressed from early
season form, defense and special

teams seem to be improving. This
week in practice, Stanford will try
to get its passing game in gear.
Cougar head coach Mike Price,
for one, thinks the Cardinal could
be dangerous if it can get its down
field attack straightened out.
"I feel like this Stanford team is
about ready to explode and do re
ally well on offense," he said.
"They're going to spoil some
body's Saturday real soon."

Teevens once again chose to run

out the clock and hasten the end of
a blowout loss, and once again run
ning back Kenneth Tolon looked
good doing so. The sophomore
gained 89 yards on only 14 carries
and scored the Cardinal's only
touchdown after starting senior
Kerry Carter managed only 55
yards on 18 carries while playing
against the Cougars' first-string
defense.
Most of the Cardinal's success
ful drives this year have been the
result of good running, but given
its tendency for allowing a lot of

No one doubts that the talent is
there, but Lewis, whom Teevens
insists is still the starter, despite the
usual in-game musical-chairs sub

is obviously pressing.
Lewis has a Pac-10-worst 10 in

the season opener at Boston Col

accuracy at times this season. The

be right on top of things.
Stanford has done a good job of
correcting its early-season fum
bling problem, and its special
teams looked decent on Saturday.
Though freshman Michael
Sgroi was wide on a 41-yard field

goal attempt at the end of the first
half, he did connect on a 28-yarder
later on. He also kept plenty of air
underneath his kickoffs, allowing
the coverage to hold the Cougars
to only 67 yards on four returns.
Junior punter Eric Johnson,
who could be the most improved
member of the Cardinal, has
demonstrated great hangtime,
and Stanford's punt-coverage unit
allowed only one 5-yard return

against Washington State.
However, Stanford hasn't done
much with its own return game so
far. Junior All-American punt re
turner Luke Powell has yet to
break a long runback, and senior
Ryan Wells is the least effective
kick returner in the Pac-10, with a
season long of just 22 yards.
Though it may seem like the
Cardinal has regressed from early
season form, defense and special

teams seem to be improving. This
week in practice, Stanford will try
to get its passing game in gear.
Cougar head coach Mike Price,
for one, thinks the Cardinal could
be dangerous if it can get its down
field attack straightened out.
"I feel like this Stanford team is
about ready to explode and do re
ally well on offense," he said.
"They're going to spoil some
body's Saturday real soon."
After its third straight game
giving up more than twice as
many points as it scored, the Stan
ford football team (1-4, 0-2 Pacif
ic- 10 Conference) finds itself des
perately searching fora way to
make plays.
Fortunately for the Cardinal,
this weekend's opponent, Arizona
(3-3,0-2), is the weakest remaining
team on its schedule. The Cardinal
is in dire need of a confidence in
fusion, and for that reason, Satur
day's very winnable game is its best
chance to right the ship before the
murderous schedule resumes with
road trips to UCLA (4-2, 1-1) and
No. 6 Oregon (6-0, 2-0)
But after losing 65-24 to Ari
zona State (5-2,2-0), 31-7 to No. 7
Notre Dame (6-0) and 36-11 to
No. 10 Washington State (6-1, 3-
0) — games that were played the
way its opponents wanted them to
be played — the Cardinal will
look to set the tone early against
the Wildcats.
One thing Stanford will focus
on is discipline. The loss to the
Cougars featured an embarrass
ing seven penalties for inappro
priate personal conduct — five
personal fouls and two roughing
the-passer calls.
Not only did those penalties

negate a possible scoring drive and
nullify an interception, they also
reflected poorly on a football pro
gram that has an established repu
tation.
"I think they were frustrated,
but you can't really tell because
they're a dirty team," said Cougar
defensive lineman Rien Long.
"They've got their ways of doing
things that aren't quite legal."
Under former coach Tyrone
Willingham, the Cardinal was pe
nalized only 60 times in its 1 1 reg
ular-season games last year. This
year's squad, less than halfway
through the season, has already
racked up 50 penalties.
On the plus side, the defense,
having spotted the Cougars all the
points they would need by half
time, regrouped and played well
in the second half. Though it has
consistently allowed a lot of points,
the defense has done a nice job of
forcing turnovers and giving the
offense some big chances.
Sophomore safety Osh
iomogho Atogwe stood out above
all other defenders on Saturday.
He had four tackles, a pass deflec
tion, a 16-yard sack which forced a
fumble and a fumble recovery that
he returned 42 yards to set up the
Cardinal's first points of the after
noon.
