# Then and now: approaching war in Iraq
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Editors Note: This article is the third in a weekly se
ries investigating the relationship between the Stan
lord community and the potential war in Iraq. This
installment will appear in two parts. Today's article
compares the current campus climate to Stanford's re
action to the onset of the Persian Gulf War in 1990.
Tomorrow's article addresses changes in the campus'
response as war neared in 1990 and discusses the di
rections student reaction could take in 2002 if war
becomes imminent.

As the nation lays the groundwork fora pre
emptive strike against Iraq, the Stanford com
munity's engagement in the debate on U.S.

military action has visibly spiked. In recent
weeks, Stanford has been home to an anti-war
rally and call-in, a teach-in on Iraq, and height
ened debate on campus, in both residences
and the media.
But this is not the first time the Stanford
community has gradually mobilized to re
spond to anticipated U.S. military involvement
with Iraq.
Twelve years ago, the prospect of war in the
Persian Gulf was leading many of Stanford's
outspoken voices to organize public opposition
to (he war. Despite dissimilarities in the circum
stances surrounding U.S. intervention then
and now, today's protestors have employed
many of the same means to convey their mes
sages.

Leaving aside superficial similarities be
tween the current situation and the period of
1990 leading up to the Gulf War — U.S. dis
cussions about using decisive force began in
the summer and continued through the fall,
and both Saddam Hussein and a Bush were in
power — the circumstances of the two conflicts
are very different.
Today, students are discussing the implica
tions of a preemptive war, not whether the
United States should respond to Iraqi aggres
sion abroad. Arguments for war in 2002 focus
on national security and regime change, not
national sovereignty and limited conflict.
Furthermore, the concerns weighing on the

minds of today's students include
the threat of nuclear, biological
and chemical weapons and the
specter of terrorist attacks. In
1990, students' primary concerns
were the fear of being drafted,
worries about a repeat of the Viet
nam War, and frustration with
what many described as a biased,
pro-war media.
Despite these striking differ
ences, Stanford students and fac
ulty, whether activist or apathetic,
have treated the two situations al
most identically.
In both 1990 and 2002, stu
dents returned to campus in the
fall cognizant of the potential for
war, after summers when escalat
ing tensions between the United
States and Iraq burst to the lore
front of the national conscious
ness. Yet in both cases, the campus
as a whole did not rapidly involve
itself in public debate or action
surrounding the war.
Similar to activity on campus
this year, organized responses to
potential war in the fall of 1990
were driven largely by a relatively
small, dedicated group of activists
and faculty who opposed U.S. mil
itary action in Iraq — a contrast to
many current students' memory
of the Gulf War as one that gar
nered little opposition.
On Oct. H, 1990, Stanford fac
ulty and the Peninsula Peace
Center sponsored a teach-in
against U.S. involvement in the
Persian Gulf organized by faculty
including Joel Beinin.a professor
of Middle Eastern history. On
Oct. IS, 2002, Beinin and the
Peninsula Peace and justice Cen
ter again held a teach-in critical of
U.S. policies.
To kick off the 1990 teach-in,

activists organized a rally in White
Plaza; on Oct. 3, 2002, several
campus organizations sponsored a
"Words Against War" rally in
White Plaza in which they urged
students to call their elected repre
sentatives.
And, in both years, several fac
ulty took public stands on the po
tential wars. In 1990, at least four
faculty from the School of Hu
manities and Sciences spoke out
against the war and, in Novem
ber of that year, two Stanford law
professors worked with other
prominent constitutional schol
ars on a brief declaring that for
mer President George Bush
needed congressional consent to
attack Iraq.
Last night, a group of faculty
met at the home of Statistics Prof.
Emeritus Charles Stein to discuss
how they should respond to cur
rent President George W. Bush's
push toward a preemptive war
against Iraq.

Public interpretations in 1990
of the road to war also go hand-in
hand with today's headlines. In
mid-November, The Stanford
Daily printed two guest columns
bearing the headlines "Americans
are beginning to view war with
Iraq as inevitable" and "While
Hussein seems ready to negotiate,
Bush is preparing for war" —
headlines that have appeared al
most verbatim in newspapers
across the country in (he past
month this year.
While public responses to po
tential war in 1990 and 2002 mir
ror each other almost exactly, an
other similarity between campus
response in these two periods lies
in the lack of broad-based student
response.
Despite several Iraq-related
events this month that have
gained substantial publicity, stu
dent turnout does not indicate
that campus is sufficiently preoc
cupied by the prospect of war to

alter people's daily routine. The
opening plenary session of last
weekend's teach-in, despite a
sizeable advertising campaign, at
tracted only several dozen stu
dents. The Daily similarly de
scribed the 1990 rally kicking off
that year's teach-in as "sparsely
attended."
But students today argue that,
while Stanford students may not be
attending demonstrations or edu
cational panels in droves, the situa
tion in Iraq is not being ignored.
"My personal feeling is that
[potential war in Iraq] is high on
the minds of Stanford students,"
said senior Bo Cowgill, ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate Chair. "1
don't think I've been to any parties
where it hasn't come out at some
point."
Organizers also stated that the
turnout they have seen at Iraq-re
lated events thus far exceeds nor
mal attendance.
"For sure, I've seen student re
sponse as being very receptive,
compared at least to issues we
were trying to publicize in the
spring of last year, as people
stopped following the bombing in
Afghanistan," said senior Calvin
Miaw, co-coordinator of the Stan
ford Community for Peace and
Justice. "One of the things that has
surprised me was, for the Oct. 6
rally, a busload of Stanford stu
dents went," he said, adding that
the number far exceeded partici
pants in last year's rallies.
However, many students are
skeptical that their peers will be
come genuinely concerned with
the situation in Iraq, even if war
does erupt. If this holds true, it
may prove to be the biggest dispar
ity between today and 1990, when
about one thousand of students ul
timately gathered in White Plaza
just before the United States
launched a massive air assault on
Iraq on Jan. 15, 1991.

where organizers urged participants to call their elected representatives.
Campus groups held similar rallies in 1990 before the Persian Gulf War.
