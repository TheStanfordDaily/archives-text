# Then and now: approaching war in Iraq
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Editors Note: This article is the third in a weekly se
ries investigating the relationship between the Stan
lord community and the potential war in Iraq. This
installment will appear in two parts. Today's article
compares the current campus climate to Stanford's re
action to the onset of the Persian Gulf War in 1990.
Tomorrow's article addresses changes in the campus'
response as war neared in 1990 and discusses the di
rections student reaction could take in 2002 if war
becomes imminent.

As the nation lays the groundwork fora pre
emptive strike against Iraq, the Stanford com
munity's engagement in the debate on U.S.

military action has visibly spiked. In recent
weeks, Stanford has been home to an anti-war
rally and call-in, a teach-in on Iraq, and height
ened debate on campus, in both residences
and the media.
But this is not the first time the Stanford
community has gradually mobilized to re
spond to anticipated U.S. military involvement
with Iraq.
Twelve years ago, the prospect of war in the
Persian Gulf was leading many of Stanford's
outspoken voices to organize public opposition
to (he war. Despite dissimilarities in the circum
stances surrounding U.S. intervention then
and now, today's protestors have employed
many of the same means to convey their mes
sages.

Leaving aside superficial similarities be
tween the current situation and the period of
1990 leading up to the Gulf War — U.S. dis
cussions about using decisive force began in
the summer and continued through the fall,
and both Saddam Hussein and a Bush were in
power — the circumstances of the two conflicts
are very different.
Today, students are discussing the implica
tions of a preemptive war, not whether the
United States should respond to Iraqi aggres
sion abroad. Arguments for war in 2002 focus
on national security and regime change, not
national sovereignty and limited conflict.
Furthermore, the concerns weighing on the
