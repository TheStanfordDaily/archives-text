## 
### JAY DAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite bringing high hopes and its top players,
the Stanford women's tennis team came back to The
Farm empty-handed from its first tournament of
the year.
At the Riviera/I'l A All-American Championships
in Pacific Palisades, Calif., Stanford junior Lauren
Barnikow, freshman Amber Liu and sophomore
Erin Burdette, three of the top college players in the
country, fell to a barrage of obstacles and ill-fate.
Liu had made astounding progress throughout
the tournament, advancing out of the qualifying
rounds last week to go on to defeat top-seeded Vil
marie Castellvi of Tennessee on Friday. Later in the
day, however, Liu was forced to withdraw from her
match against Mira Radii of Mississippi due to injury,
bringing her first —but certainly not last—run with
the Cardinal to a premature close.
To reach the main draw, Liu had defeated Katie
Granson of Duke 6-1,6-1 in the final round of qual

ifying. Liu earlier posted wins over Emily Marker of
Maryland 6-0, 6-2, and Kentucky's Sarah Witten 6-
1,6-2.
While Burdette and Barnikow's freshman team
mate made a strong entrance onto the collegiate
scene, the defending NCAA doubles champions did
not start the season in grand style.
Both Burdette and Barnikow fell in the first round
of the singles tournament — Amanda Johnson of
Duke took out Burdette and Barnikow lost to Kate
Pinchbeck of North Carolina — before the two made
a first-round exit from the doubles competition. Wit
ten and Nathalie Roels of Kentucky took down the
Stanford duo, 8-4.
Barnikow defeated Adria Engel of Arizona State
2-6, 6-4, 6-2 in the consolation bracket on Friday be
fore falling in the quarterfinals to Ohio State's Sad
hafPervez. Burdette did not advance in the consola
tion bracket.
The Cardinal will look fora better showing when
it returns to competition on Oct. 25 al the lIA Re
gional, which will be held at Stanford.
