# Martin wins consolation title

### JAY DAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite an ominous start, the
Stanford men's tennis team
demonstrated how strong it can
rebound in its opening tourna
ment of the year.
Senior David Martin cap
tured the consolation singles
title at the 2002 Icy Hot/II A
All-American Men's Tennis
Championships in Chattanooga,
Tenn., with a straight-set win
over Nic Boeker of Georgia last
weekend. The eighth-seeded
Martin defeated Boeker 7-(i (8-
0), 6-2 to post his fifth victory in
three days. Martin did not lose a
set in his five consolation brack
et victories.
It was certainly a solid start for
Martin, who was last year's NCAA
singles runner-up.
In Sunday afternoon's doubles

final, the top-seeded team of Mar
tin and senior Scott Lipsky
dropped an 8-5 decision to third
seeded Michael Calkins and
Amer Delic of Illinois. Lipsky and
Martin, who are two-time doubles
Ail-Americans, were making their
second consecutive appearance in
the ITA Ail-American doubles
final. Last year they were defeat
ed by the same doubles team from
Illinois.
Despite promising outlooks, all
three Stanford players — David
Martin, Scott Lipsky and k.C.
Corkery — fell in Thursday's
opening round. It was the first
time since 1984 that Stanford,
which has won a tournament-best
six Icy I lot / ITA Ail-American sin
gles titles, did not have a player in
the sec ond round.
Although Stanford did not
c linc ha championship title, coach
Dick Gould was pleased despite

unfortunate circumstances.
"Dave lost a good First
rounder," Gould said. "Me re
bounded well in the consolation.
Dave and Scott did well in doubles,
and Scott had to default out of sin
gles due to a bad hamstring. K.C.
did a great job for his first time
out."
This weekend, Sam Warburg
and junior Carter Morris will
head to Midland, Texas, to com
pete in a tournament with eight
other universities. From Oct. to
29, the team will compete in the
Omni Hotels Regional Champi
onships at Saint Mary's College in
Moraga, Calif.
Overall, the fall season holds a
relatively light schedule for the
men's tennis team, but it is a warm
up period for demanding play to
come in the spring.
