# Academics to be embraced by NCAA

### SARAH MEINECKE INDIANA DAILY STUDENT 
(U-WIRE) BLOOMING
ION, Ind. â€” Indiana Universi
ty President Myles Brand ac
knowledged last week that he
plans to continue to pursue his
idea of "purifying" college ath
letics once he takes the helm of
the NCAA.
But Brand said he doesn't
want to deny sports fans or ath
letes the chance to enjoy the
games. He would just like to see
a bigger emphasis on providing
good academics.
"I've had a lot of experience
running large complex organi
zations," Brand said Friday. "I
believe I can carry that experi
ence over to the NCAA. While I
have not been active in the
NCAA itself, I certainly have
been active in presidential asso
ciations, and I've certainly been
involved in sports on my cam
pus and in the conference."
Some say Brand's outsider
status was one of the reasons he
was hired. Brand fired leg
endary Indiana men's basket
ball coach Bob Knight and
fought for tighter regulation of
college sports.
Soon after firing Knight,
Brand called for reforms in col
lege athletics, pitching his "acad
emics first" initiative in a speech
to the National Press Club.
Brand's opinions on athletics
gave some people the wrong
idea, IU board of trustees presi

dent Frederick Lie hhorn said.
"He has been misinterpreted
on the subject of athletics," Eich
horn said. "I le is not anti-athlet
ics, but he thinks that athletics
needs to come more under the
overall umbrella of the universi
ty and be part of the university
community rather than an is
land unto itself."
And that's a concept the
NCAA embraces. In April, the
N(L\A board of directors adopt
ed reforms aimed at curtailing
the trend of student-athletes
forgoing college or leaving
school early for the pros.
Dave Frohnmayer, an NCAA
Executive Committee member
and president of the University
of Oregon, said it's appropriate
for an NCAA president to be an
advocate of the academic world.
"He has the knowledge of
athletics and an impressive aca
demic background," Frohn
mayer said. "He's been a good
administrator in a complex or
ganization, and is recognized as
a national leader."
Brand said he believes acade
mics can coexist with athletics.
"The collegiate game must
be distinguished from the pro
game, which is good in its own
right, but different," Brand
said. "It's important to make
sure to maintain the integrity of
intercollegiate athletics, and
most especially integrate inter
collegiate athletes with the acad
emic missions of colleges and
universities."
