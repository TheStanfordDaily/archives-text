# New Olives cafe offers Mediterranean meals
## 
### ALLISON DENCKER 
As part of a plan to expand the
range of food options available to
students and faculty, University
Dining Services opened a new con
cept cafe in the basement of Build
ing 160 this month, offering region
al Mediterranean cuisine that is not
available elsewhere on campus.
Olives @ Building 160, the sec
ond retail restaurant that dining
services has opened, is already ex
periencing booming business, said
manager Amanda Gotthold, citing
the cafe's positive feedback from
customers.
"People have been coming in
here sayingthey feel like they're not
even at the University, that it feels
like a world away," she said. "We've
gotten a lot of praise for our ambi
ence, music and service, all of which
are really involved in the concept of

the cafe."
Eric Montell, assistant director
of dining services, agrees with Got
thold.
"Business has been gigantic —
far exceeding our expectations, es
pecially given the location of the
cafe," he said, referring to its loca
tion in the basement of newly-reno
vated Building 160, which he said
doesn't get much foot traffic and
formerly housed an unpopular
restaurant.
The cafe serves Mediterranean
fare such as sandwiches and bakla
va and also operates a grill on its
outside patio.
According to Montell, some of
the most popular dishes are the
skewer combos, which include beef,
spicy chicken or tofu, plus a Greek
salad, various dressings, rice, pita
and a drink.
The cafe opens at 8 a.m lot

breakfast and closes at 2:30 p.m.
Dining Services found in mar
keting studies that University staff
members usually leave by 5 p.m.,
and students are most likely to re
turn to their dining halls for dinner,
so it decided to close the cafe for
evening dining.
Lunch prices range from $2.95

soups to $6.75 combination plat
ters, said Gotthold, who explained
that prices at the cafe were geared
towards the college student's bud-
Gotthold said the cafe is also
planning on introducing more

food that students can afford, such
as a European-style pizza for
under live dollars.
Cafe clientele is a mix of stu
dents and staff who work in the
Main Quad area, Montell said, and
has recently become home to small
staff meetings.
Reaction from patrons has been
positive.
" ITie combos come with a free
drink, which is really cool," said
first-year civil and environmental
engineering graduate student
Boon Lim.
Haitham lioshnak, a second
year electrical engineering gradu
ate student, said, "The portions are
very big. There's a bit of everything
you want: dips, salad, pita, rice."
Montell said that die only major
problem the management has
faced is seating issues — the cafe is
slightly smaller than the previous
restaurant and is often filled to ca
pacity.
