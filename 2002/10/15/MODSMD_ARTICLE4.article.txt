# Students remember indigenous peoples
## Indigenous People's Day gives alternative to Columbus Day 
### JULIE TUNG 
In an effort to counter the
observance of Columbus Day,
Stanford's Native American
community celebrated Indige
nous People's Day yesterday, a
holiday in recognition and re
membrance of their ancestors'
tribulations at the hands of
Western influence.
The day began at 4 a.m. for
lIJ of Stanford's Native Ameri
can students, who boarded a
ferrv in San Francisco with

other American Indians from
all over the Bay Area to attend
Solidarity Day on Alcatraz Is
land. The participants gath
ered there to watch ihe sunrise
and commemorate the
takeover of Alcatraz 33 years
ago by American Indians fight
ing for their culture.
"The purpose was to pray
for indigenous people who
have suffered since Christo
pher Columbus' arrival 500
years ago, to remember those
people, and to give support to
indigenous people's struggles,"
said Brooke Swaney, co-chair
of the Stanford American Indi
an Organization.

Students gathered in White Plaza last night to celebrate Indigenous
People's Day, organized by the Stanford American Indian Organiza
tion to provide an alternative to Columbus Day.
The festivities at Alcatraz lasted
for three hours, with numerous
speakers, drum groups and
dancers from (lie Aztec, Porno
and Ohlone tribes.
"It's really an incredible expe
rience," Swaney said. "It was great
to see so many people come out
and to be able to listen to the
speakers and the music and watch
the sunrise together."
In White Plaza the same
evening, almost 20 Native Ameri
can students gathered to hold a
moment of silence and share their
stories, perspectives and experi
ences with others in the commu
nity.
Initially, organizers had
arranged a candlelight vigil, typi
cally a part of the annual celebra
tion, but plans fell through at the
last minute.
Although in previous years the
celebration attracted more partic
ipation and publicity, most stu

dents were unfazed by the lower
profile of this year's event.
"It doesn't matter to me what
other people think as long as I'm
here, and I know what it means to
me to be indigenous," said Mar
lon Footracer. "Being here and
being ourselves is what's most im
portant."
Indigenous People's Day is cel
ebrated by Native Americans na
tionwide.
According to Denni Wood
ward, the assistant director at the
Native American Cultural Center,
the holiday has been held largely
in earnest on the Stanford cam
pus in the past decade, since the
500-year anniversary in 1992 of
Columbus' arrival.
For many, Indigenous Peo
ple's Day represents an opportu
nity for American Indians to
heighten awareness of history in
the community.
"I think we've all grown up
going through the school system,
where there's only one viewpoint
about Columbus and we're never
presented with an alternative,"
Woodward said. "We're doing

what we can to show that there are
other perspectives."
During the holiday, the partic
ipants aimed not only to educate
the public, but the rest of the na
tive community as well. Accord
ing to some of the students, ac
tivism and participation in the
Native American community has
been waning, and they are work
ing to change that.
"I know there are a lot of peo
ple who just check the box for
'Native American' and have no in
tention of fighting for our culture,
or even being a part of it, and that
saddens me," said senior Tanya
Beatus.
In response to critics who claim
that the Native American commu
nity is unfairly blaming Columbus
for its troubles, the students ex
plain that Columbus is merely the
figurehead for Western oppres
sion as a whole.
"We're not blaming Columbus
for everything," Beatus said. "But
the truth is that 1.5 million native
people died in a 10-year period,
and that's what Columbus sym
bolizes to us."
