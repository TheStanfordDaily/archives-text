## 
### MIKEY LEE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford's new gustatory guru loves
the University and its students almost as
much as he loves food, and he has al
ready begun to enliven the campus din
ing scene vviih his enthusiastic, hands-on
approach to customer service.
Nadeem Siddiqui, the former direc
tor of dining and retail at Cornell Uni
versity, began his job as the new director
ofStanford Dining on June 3 and imme
diately became enamored of his new
post.
"Besides the sun," Siddiqui said, what
brought him to Stanford was a conversa
tion he had with a former Stanford stu
dent.
"Shafique Adam, who is now a gradu
ate student at Cornell, said only one
thing when I asked him about Stanford:
'It's my home.' That's what sold me.
Here was a kid — whose real home is
Kenya — who had moved to the East
Coast, and while he could've said any
thing about Stanford, that's what he
chose to say.

"l found all positive things here and
was amazed by the quality of people and
their commitments," he said. "1 think it's
a privilege and an honor to be here."
Siddiqui said he also considers his
boss, Associate Vice Provost of Residen
tial and Dining Enterprises Shirley
Everett, to be a large factor in his deci
sion to come to Stanford.
"Her approach and commitment to
students were exactly the same as my
philosophy," he said.
In the four months that he has been
here, he has looked at programming
and is starting a committee in conjunc
tion with the ASSU to look at improving
Dining Services.
"These last four months have seemed
like four years, but in a good way," Sid
diqui laughed. "[ The committee] will
look at programming and we hope it will
improve things."
Emphasizing that his staff— includ
ing 200 full-time and 200 part-time em
ployees — shares his vision. Siddiqui says
lie wants to improve things, not.just have
things work.
"Mv entire team is committed to take

things to the next level," he said. "We will
be working on having much better ser
vice, more flexible plans, and all of us
have a clear-cut understanding of what
we are here for. 1 really see students as
our stockholders."
Education is something that Siddiqui
considers to be one of food industry's
greatest attributes. He is aware that stu
dents are here to be educated and says
he hopes that he can help in that process.
"I want to be cutting-edge in our in
dustry," Siddiqui said. "I want to have
more diverse dishes and more ethnic
dishes. Food is not for feeding, but for
education, too. People learn from and
over food.
"We have five executive chefs who are
Culinary Institute of America chefs. This
gives us the strength to have a variety of
choices and the ability to be flexible
enough to enhance the services."
His dedication to students may be his
biggest focus.
"I don't spend much time in the of
fice," Siddiqui said. " That's my manage-

ment style: not behind the desk. I
want to be out where I can observe
and see what students want.
"I have such admiration for stu
dents and the work they do," he
said. "On top of studying and
learning, they're improving the
quality of life by involving them
selves in activities on campus and
off campus, doing things to help
the community and the environ
ment. Stanford students have such
a high expectation of themselves
and their work . . . they also have
that same expectation of service,
and we realize this.
Siddiqui also said that he loves
to cook with students.
"[My staff and I| were testing
some menus, and a student who
is currently living in Chi Theta
Chi came in and said he was very
hungry . . . that the food smelled
very good," Siddiqui said. "We
invited him in to eat with us and
after talking, he said, 'We should
cook together.' So we stayed in
contact and on Thursday
evening I II be cooking with resi
dents [at I'heta Chi]."
Siddiqui's hands-on approach
to management partly stems from
how he says the dining staff views
students.
"I really feel that for nine
months, our entire team becomes
foster parents," he said. "We feel
very strongly that [students] are
our kids. They're sharp, hard
working, smart, and their lives are
going at rocket speed.
"We admire that, and our goal
is to do our part to make these the
best four years of their lives."
Addressing student concerns
that items under the a la carte
points system, used in Manzanita
and Wilbur Dining, are priced too
high, Siddiqui explained that
much research goes into pricing
items and that staff wages and ben
efits are factors as well.
"We're non-profit," he said.
"When we do renovations, we pay
for it without [subsidy]. We have to
have money stored for keeping fa

cilities to code . . . up to speed,
cleanliness and safety. Each [staff
member] has the same benefits
that I do. We have a good rela
tionship with the union, and this
factors into pricing.
"For [the points system], we
analyzed pricing from 10 off
campus and 10 on-campus
restaurants to compare our pric
ing structure. Obviously not [all
prices are cheaper on campus
than oil], but there are lists com
paring item prices outside each of
the points-based [eating areas]:
Manzanita Dining , The Cafe,
Wilbur Marketplace and Olives,
the new eatery located in Build
ing 160."
Prices are not his only concern,
as Siddiqui says he also wants to
improve quality.
"We want food to be fresh,
high-quality, consistent and fla
vorful," he said. "Students come
here with amazingly refined
palettes — they know what curry
tastes like and what good sushi is."
Siddiqui says that students
should contact him at any time by
e-mail at nes@stanfbrd.edu or by
phone at (650) 725-1510 if they
have any concerns of if they just
want to talk.
