## 
### MIKEY LEE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford's new gustatory guru loves
the University and its students almost as
much as he loves food, and he has al
ready begun to enliven the campus din
ing scene vviih his enthusiastic, hands-on
approach to customer service.
Nadeem Siddiqui, the former direc
tor of dining and retail at Cornell Uni
versity, began his job as the new director
ofStanford Dining on June 3 and imme
diately became enamored of his new
post.
"Besides the sun," Siddiqui said, what
brought him to Stanford was a conversa
tion he had with a former Stanford stu
dent.
"Shafique Adam, who is now a gradu
ate student at Cornell, said only one
thing when I asked him about Stanford:
'It's my home.' That's what sold me.
Here was a kid — whose real home is
Kenya — who had moved to the East
Coast, and while he could've said any
thing about Stanford, that's what he
chose to say.

"l found all positive things here and
was amazed by the quality of people and
their commitments," he said. "1 think it's
a privilege and an honor to be here."
Siddiqui said he also considers his
boss, Associate Vice Provost of Residen
tial and Dining Enterprises Shirley
Everett, to be a large factor in his deci
sion to come to Stanford.
"Her approach and commitment to
students were exactly the same as my
philosophy," he said.
In the four months that he has been
here, he has looked at programming
and is starting a committee in conjunc
tion with the ASSU to look at improving
Dining Services.
"These last four months have seemed
like four years, but in a good way," Sid
diqui laughed. "[ The committee] will
look at programming and we hope it will
improve things."
Emphasizing that his staff— includ
ing 200 full-time and 200 part-time em
ployees — shares his vision. Siddiqui says
lie wants to improve things, not.just have
things work.
"Mv entire team is committed to take

things to the next level," he said. "We will
be working on having much better ser
vice, more flexible plans, and all of us
have a clear-cut understanding of what
we are here for. 1 really see students as
our stockholders."
Education is something that Siddiqui
considers to be one of food industry's
greatest attributes. He is aware that stu
dents are here to be educated and says
he hopes that he can help in that process.
"I want to be cutting-edge in our in
dustry," Siddiqui said. "I want to have
more diverse dishes and more ethnic
dishes. Food is not for feeding, but for
education, too. People learn from and
over food.
"We have five executive chefs who are
Culinary Institute of America chefs. This
gives us the strength to have a variety of
choices and the ability to be flexible
enough to enhance the services."
His dedication to students may be his
biggest focus.
"I don't spend much time in the of
fice," Siddiqui said. " That's my manage-
