# SCN to expand repertoire
## 
### JESSICA WANG 
Over the years, the Stanford Concert Net
work has developed a reputation for bringing
only rock and jam bands to campus, a pattern
that 2002-03 SC IN Director Eric Blackerby, a se
nior, has said he is determined to break.
SCN is a student-run organization that
works to bring live music to campus, booking
established and rising acts from various genres,
including rock, jazz and hip-hop. The size of
SCN's venues range from the University's
largest auditoriums to the CoHo series, which
features small shows at the Coffee House.
"SCN has been working hard to improve its
image to a group that brings a diverse roster of
great music to campus," Blackerby said. "We've
added a hip-hop and open-mic night featuring
Stanford talent and a hot up-and-coming artist
from Philadelphia, esteban, and New Jersey
artist, D J Supa. Our Thursday night CoHo se
ries also features an extremely talented vocalist,
Sakai, who combines soul and funk to create a
great sound."
In addition to bringing a diverse range of
artists to campus to perform, SCN aims to have
a concert-producing system that provides a
hands-on opportunity for students to learn
how to produce a variety of events.
SCN receives its funds by applying for ASSU

special fees at the end of each year, along with
many other student groups. SCN also has a re
serve account it dips into, and this money is gen
erated from ticket sales on big shows held at
Memorial Auditorium, Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
Kresge Auditorium and Frost Amphitheater.
Blackerby explains, "Most of the time SCN
loses money or breaks even on shows in Mem
And, Dink and Kresge in order to keep student
ticket prices low. Frost is our big money-maker,
and il we do it right, we can make a substantial
amount of money from a Frost show."
In the past, SCN has brought to campus a va
riety of artists, including Dispatch, Common and
Blackalicious. SCN's most recent acts have been
RAN A and Pseudopod at the CoHo on Oct. 10,
and before that, Matt Nathanson on Oct. 3.
Many students think that SCN just picks out
an artist and then gets the artist to come play on
campus. However, it does not work quite like
that. SCN cannot just get any artist it wants to
come and play at Stanford.
First, SCN must see if the artist is available for
the date it has on hold with the Room Schedul
ing Office. If the artist is not available for that
specific date, then SCN must choose another
one. SCN then puts in offers to multiple artists
for big shows in order to keep its options open.
After that, SCN then does research on the
artists, figuring out how much the acts are

grossing at shows, and how much they are
probably making per show. Based on these fig
ures, SCN will then make an offer, because, ac
cording to Blackerby, "booking agents often in
flate the figures for how much money artists are
being paid per show."
Next, if the artist accepts the offer, SCN ne
gotiates the contract. If the two parties agree to
the terms, SCN and the artist signs the contract
and put together the show.

Currently, there are about a total
of 25 to 30 students on the SCN
staff. Some are executive direc
tors, while most are part of the
"Street Team" which is responsi
ble for advertising and getting the
word out about upcoming events.
Senior Jodie Ellis, the produc
tion manager for SCN, explains
why he finds his role in SCN re
warding: " This is something that 1
like to do. The people who don't
really know what SCN is should
know that it's a small group of
people who work their asses off to
bring good music to campus.
"A whole lot of work goes into
bringing what seems like a simple
small show. The people who work
on it work really really hard. They
spend eight or nine hour days
putting effort into a show that
people can enjoy on a Thursday
or Friday night."
Freshman Bethany Bier, a
member of the "Street Team," has
already been helping out SCN by
posting flyers and setting up at
events in her first few weeks on
board: "I love being in SCN be
cause it's a good opportunity to
meet cool artists and learn more
about music. All of the staff is real
ly fun."
