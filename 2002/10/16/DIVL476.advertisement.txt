What it Means to Love You
with author Stephen Elliott
-WHAT IT MEANS
* TO LOVEYOU
Stephen Elliott returns with his second book, What It Means To Love You, the story of Anthony,
Brooke, and Lance, three Chicago sex workers whose lives are interlinked
as they travel the underworld that is Halsted Street. Anthony, at thirty-four, finds
himself stripping on the bottom rung of the ladder. He sees clearly that his days on the stage
are numbered. But it is not easy for Anthony to leave the life. Before Anthony can stop strip
ping, he has to learn how to stop stripping. Brooke and Lance came to Halsted Street in
Chicago from Grand Falls, Michigan. Lance, handsome and strong, is in his mid-twenties and
is starting to lose his mind. Brooke is seventeen and she has been turning tricks since she was
fifteen. Her goal, one day, is to go back home to her father after her mother goes away. What
It Means To Love You extends far beyond these main characters. This is a novel about Chicago
and all the boys and girls from all over the Midwest who run away to Halsted Street and the
fate that awaits them there.
