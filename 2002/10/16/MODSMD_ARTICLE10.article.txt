## U.S. urges Indonesia 'to deal with threat' 
### 
WASHING I ON (AP) â€” The
United States is pressing Indone
sia to crack down on the Islamic
militants blamed for the weekend
bombing on Bali that killed nearly
200 people.
"You cannot pretend it (terror
ism) doesn't exist in yourcountry,"
Secretary of State Colin Powell
said at a news conference yester
day. He said he hoped the attack
"reinforces Indonesia's determi
nation to deal with this kind of
threat."
Powell had announced a $50
million, three-year anti-terrorism
assistance package during a visit to
Indonesia in August. The Bali
bombing could prompt more U.S.
help along those lines.
The United States had warned
last week that Indonesia was be
coming a home to terrorists. And
U.S. Ambassador Ralph Boyce
met with Indonesian President
Megawati Sukarnoputri yesterday
to press for action terrorist
groups, a senior Bush administra
tion official said on condition of
anonymity.
The official could not confirm a
New York Times report that
Boyce had also warned Megawati
the day before the bombing that a

group linked to al-Qaida was plan
ning an attacks in Indonesia.
President Bush said Monday
thai he planned to speak to
Megawati. "And I hope I hear the
resolve of a leader that recognizes
that any time terrorists take hold
in a country it is going to weaken
the country itself," Bush said.
"There has to be a firm and delib
erate desire to find the killers be
fore they kill somebody else."
The bombing may boost the ar
guments of top Pentagon officials
who want to resume ties with In
donesia's military that Congress
severed because of the army's
atrocities against civilians.
"This is the first and most pow
erful recognition that the battle
against terrorism is not strictly lim
ited to the Middle East or south
Asia," said Kurt Campbell, a for
mer Pentagon adviser now with
the Center for Strategic and filter
national Studies, a nonpartisan or
ganization that analyzes foreign
policy. "Human rights worries in
the short term will be overridden
by national security concerns."
The car bomb that exploded on
the resort island of Bali on Satur
day killed more than 180 people,
most of them Australians.
