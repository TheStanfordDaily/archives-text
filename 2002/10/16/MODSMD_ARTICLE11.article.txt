An FBI terrorism analyst was iden
tified yesterday as the ninth per
son killed by the Washington-area
sniper, shot in the head in an at
tack investigators say has yielded
the most detailed clues yet.
For the first time, witnesses
were able to give information
about license plates on vehicles
seen fleeing the scene, including a
light-colored Chevrolet Astro van
with a burned-out rear taillight.
A law enforcement official,
speaking on condition of
anonymity, said another witness
gave a description of a dark
skinned man, possibly Hispanic or
Middle Eastern, in a white van.
"There was some additional in
formation that we were able to get
from last night's case, and 1 am
confident that that information is
going to lead us to an arrest in the
case," Fairfax County Police Chief
Tom Manger said.
Law enforcement sources said
there was no indication the sniper
targeted Linda Franklin because
of her job. She worked for the
FBl's Cyber-Crimes Division, cre
ated last year to focus on comput
er crimes as well as intellectual
property cases.

Montgomery County (Md.) Po

the sniper case.
Franklin, a 47-year-old mother
of two grown children, was killed
Monday night as she and her hus
band loaded packages into their
car outside a Home Depot store.
Ballistics evidence yesterday
connected the slaying to the gun
man who has killed eight other
people and wounded two more
since Oct. 2.
With the terrifying spree nearly
two weeks old, Defense Secretary
Donald H. Rumsfeld agreed yes
terday evening to provide military
surveillance aircraft in the hunt for
the killer, a Pentagon spokesman
said. Sources said federal agents
on the plane will relay any infor
mation they collect to authorities
on the ground.
'Fhe Army also has started
searching its records for people
with sniper training.
Separately, Homeland Security
Director Tom Ridge said investi
gators are hesitant to rule out the
possibility that the slayings are the
work of a terrorist because there is
no hard evidence about motive.
