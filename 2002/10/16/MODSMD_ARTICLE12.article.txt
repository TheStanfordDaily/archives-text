## The
						Stanford Daily ASSU agenda is solid but needs follow through 
### 
Published Since 1891

A quick glance at the yearly figures
concerning ASSU election voter
turnout might lead one to infer that
Stanford students are largely apa
thetic about issues their campus leaders re
gard as imperative.
The current ASSU leadership aims to
change this.
In setting out their agenda for this year,
ASSU President Monica Henestroza and Vice
President Nick Rodriguez have expressed a
commitment to engage and empower under
represented student voices.
We are impressed by the agenda that Hene
stroza and Rodriguez have recently laid out.
Their expressed desire to get more students
involved in the University decision-making in
frastructure is praise-worthy but must be pro
tected against becoming a system of token stu
dent positions. Empowerment must be sup
ported by real ASSU bodies, including real po
sitions, and cannot come at the expense of
other student representation.
More broadly, Henestroza and Rodriguez
seek to increase student participation in the
government of the student polity â€” a worth-

while goal. All too frequently the campus dia
logue, like I-Hum sections or graduate semi
nars, is dominated by the overweening, the
boisterous, and those who have something to
prove. Many virtuous ideas on campus are
heard only by a few, perhaps among friends at
the CoHo, in dorm rooms at 3 a.m., at Tresid
der Fitness Center or even at parties.
To start amplifying student voices, the ASSU
leadership has created a large and diverse cab
inet, started by what one would hardly call a
mutual admiration society. A diverse inner cir
cle, however, is not enough.
There are dangers of having an executive
level bureaucracy. First, empowerment of
some voices may result in the exclusion of
others, and, second, organizational develop
ment might be confused with effective action.
There is a big difference between attending
numerous meetings with influential Univer
sity personnel and becoming an effective
conduit for communication between stu
dents and senior administrators.
Likewise, there is an equally large distinc
tion between building task forces and just get
ting things done. ASSU leaders must not allow

a large policy making body to degrade into an
administrative wasteland.
More specifically, how the ASSU leadership
will access the more apathetic students, and
how it will assure that student voices are heard
is likely to be a formidable challenge, one
which the ASSU has yet to articulate. Yet the
onus of arousing involvement cannot fall en
tirely on the ASSU leadership.
Also in the agenda was Henestroza and Ro
driguez's initiative to register as many Stan
ford students as voters, with the Get Out the
Vote campaign. We believe this is a worthwhile
effort to awaken civic involvement and to get
students out of the Stanford bubble.
We also applaud Henestroza and Ro
driguez's plan to reduce, as much as possible,
the cost of living on campus. To be successful
in this endeavor, the ASSU leadership will re
quire a coordinated effort of research and ne
gotiation. Clamorous demands of campus ven
dors to lower prices will avail nothing.
Most campus vendors are not high margin
operations. Consequently, well-intentioned ef
forts to cut costs may result in fewer services
available to students. For this campaign to be

effective, ASSU leaders will need close contact
with students, such that the former under
stands student spending behavior and eco
nomic preferences, and can communicate this
information to vendors and concessionaires.
The ASSU leaders have set before them
selves noble challenges that, if successful, will
impact students both meaningfully and imme
diately. However, for every visible success the
ASSU achieves, there exists a tremendous
amount of behind-the-scenes strategizing, ma
neuvering, communicating and executing.
The ASSU leadership should take great
pains to involve students in as many of these ac
tivities as possible, especially activities that in
clude interaction with the University. Current
student involvement in University decision
making processes is appallingly scarce, and
ASSU leaders possess no prerogative claims to
University affairs.
For empowerment to be authentic, ASSU
leaders need to create opportunities for
student voices to be heard, while restrain
ing themselves from overpowering student
voices with their own politics of fulfilling
their agenda.
