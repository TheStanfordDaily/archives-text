# MEMORY YIELDS
## The 						older we get, the better Stanford was 
### 
Class of 2006, we'd prefer not to
be the ones that break this to
you. But, in the twisted philos
ophy that spawned dorms like
Serra and Burbank, on occasion, we up
perclassmen will feel compelled to clue
you in to the ulterior forces that only se
nior members of the hundred thousand
dollar club could have noticed. Indeed,
Stanford is a-changin'.
And so, before Jeffrey Seilbach, Stan
ford's risk management director, inches
any closer toward John Ashcroft, we'd
like to take this time to present a requiem
for experiences, you, the Class of 2006,

may never get to see. We
record this history not
just to entice you with
th e sweetness of
yesteryear (thus tempt
ing you to remember the
bounties of high school)
but also so that you may
fight for what once was
and should be.
To begin with, per-

haps the greatest sin — li
brary printing. Once upon a time (until
three days after you freshmen arrived),
Provost John Etchemendy waxed philo
sophically about the amount $25,917 and
thought, "free printing!" For, what subsidy
so enlivens the spirit to learn? A student
mindlessly pillaging J-Stor is the essence of
a liberal education.
OK, you hear someone in the Lane
Reading Room saying, limited resources,
leaser, paper and repairs cost money. But
that hardly explains the ludicrous sum the
library now charges. Does the library not
wish to stay in the learning business? Since
when did annual printing industry infla
tion hit 30 percent? And why do the com
puters claim to c harge seven cents a page,
when the actual cost is 10? (Mass of 2006,
make your voice heard, lest you find your
self writing a Daily column in fall 2005 on
the new library admission charges or full
cavity searches before exiting or the utter
disappearance of. ..
Alcohol.
Before you know it, Alumni Weekend
will be upon us. So rather than sidestep
ping the catered barbeques outside Stan
ford Stadium, take some time, procure
some food, and ask about the good old days
— chances are you'll be told that the booze
flowed freely. To hear the alumni talk, it

sounds as though Stanford paved over the
Serra Stoli Canal sometime in the mid
-19705. And, while streets of alcohol may or
may not be your thing, the trend is clear.
To be sure, let us empiricize. During the
first weeks of freshman year, we were per
mitted to take that $50 per person slated
for house meeting grub and turn it into liq
uid dorm-commode bonding. We ask our
selves, with Shibu's vengeful infiltration of
A-l and cops now a übiquitous presence in
side both parties and the CoHo (whither
the Band Run?), are we better off than we
were three years ago?
What happened to the implicit contract
between students and the administration,
where no red cups outside and no alcohol
during Admit Weekend meant a good time
for all? After all, it's not like Stanford re
ceives any federal highway funding.
Lastly, the post office.
Yes, it's trite, but no four-year visit to
Stanford is complete without a near stroke
caused by the motley fools who work at the
post office. In bygone days, the Stanford
post office was located in a rundown build
ing next to the Bookstore. Students' wits,
patience and problem-solving skills were
tested with every trip. Now, as you fresh
men should already have learned, the post
office is located in a shiny new building
next to the Bookstore (after a brief sojourn
in a tented shack on FloMo field), provid
ing service that tests students' wits, patience
and problem-solving skills.
It has long been a belief that the Stan
ford post office was piloting the federal
government's affirmative action program
for the incompetent. In fact, the Post Of
fice Experiment is run by Zimbardo, and
tests the sanity of the unemployed co
term who graduated last spring and is still
waiting for some troglodyte to finish
reading our Sports Illustrated and put
her transcripts in her P.O. Box. We per
sonally think the post office should hang
a sign out front warning those with heart
problems and high blood pressure to seek
service elsewhere.
