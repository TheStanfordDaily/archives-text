Stanford resident says, 'real
security lies in peace'
When former Israeli prime minister
Ehud Barak speaks at Stanford tonight, he
is likely to be introduced as a man who
risked his political career for peace. At
Camp David in July 2000, so the myth that
has developed around him goes, Barak of
fered the Palestinians virtually everything
they had been asking for, only to be
turned down by Yasser Arafat.
But, in fact, no Palestinian leader
could have accepted Barak's offer. A
map published soon afterwards by the
Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz showed the
huge settlement blocks that Barak insist
ed on annexing to Israel extending like
thick fingers across the West Bank from
Jerusalem to Jericho, and curving south
in a broad pincer movement. Land along
the Jordan River would remain under
Israeli military control as long as neces
sary to insure Israel's security. The
Palestinians would be left with three seg
ments of land, each one separated 112 rom
the others by Israeli settlements and
roads. Palestinian travelers would have
to take long and circuitous routes and
still face the nightmare of roadblocks.

Robert Malley, a special assistant to
President Clinton at Camp David, point
ed out in a June 13 article for the New
York Review that Barak's offer "would
have entailed the incorporation of tens of
thousands of additional Palestinians into
Israeli territory [. . .] and would have
meant that territory annexed by Israel
would encroach deep inside the Pales
tinian state."
Palestinians also had reason to mis
trust Barak himself. After he took office,
he refused to implement an agreement
on withdrawal signed by his predecessor
Benjamin Netanyahu, rapidly expanded
construction of new settlements, failed to
carry out a third troop withdrawal man
dated by the Oslo agreement, and re
neged on his own agreement to return
three Palestinian villages near
Jerusalem.
By Sept. 2000, the Palestinians had be
come disillusioned with a peace process
that had dragged on for seven years and
brought them no appreciable benefits.
Hie number of West Bank settlements
had doubled, and their land was still being
seized and their homes demolished to
make way for roads that served only the
settlers. Ariel Sharon's march onto 1 laram

al-Sharif accompanied by a thousand po
lice in full riot gear on Sept. 27, 2000 was
the spark that set off an explosion.
When Palestinians gathered to protest
his incursion at a site sacred to all Muslims,
police fired on the unarmed protesters
and killed seven of them. Since then the vi
olence has escalated, with more than 600
Israelis and 1,800 Palestinians killed.
Israel has now turned the occupied ter
ritories into a giant prison, where Pales
tinians live under almost constant curfew,
unable to get to their jobs, go to school or
even to reach a hospital in an emergency.
Israeli forces have destroyed the basis of
their civic society — streets, power lines,
water systems, court houses, public
records and even school records.
Barak will undoubtedly argue that Is
rael is only doing what is necessary to put
down terrorism, but the continued pun
ishment has only provoked continued vio
lence. I hope those who attend his talk will
remember that Israel's real security lies in
a just peace, and that neither Israel nor the
Palestinians will be secure until Israel ends
its occupation and both peoples can live
side by side as equals.
