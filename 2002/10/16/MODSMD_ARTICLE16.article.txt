# . Should Arafat have accepted Barak's offer at Camp David?
## Campus groups debate critical question surrounding historic meeting in July 2000 PRO 
### STANFORD ISRAEL ALLIANCE 
As former Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak comes to speak at Stan
ford, one wonders what things
would be like if peace talks at Camp
David and Taba had succeeded.
Barak had the courage and vision to
make far-reaching compromises in
the name of peace. But at this his
toric fork in the road, his partner in
the talks, Yasser Arafat, rejected
every one of his proposals without
making a counteroffer, and started a
violent war.
The unprecedented Israeli offer,
as confirmed by the American mod
erators, was as follows: a Palestinian
state on 95 to 97 percent of the West
Bank, 100 percent of the Gaza Strip,
including part of Jerusalem and the
Old City, plus a portion of land from
pre-1967 Israel. The offer incorpo
rated enormous financial aid to help
end the Palestinian refugee crisis,
and included removing Jews from
the majority of the settlements and
using the housing for resettling
refugees.
The Palestinian demands are
quite similar to that Israeli offer.
Arafat should have accepted it, but
he did not. Why? Because during
the whole Oslo peace process, he in
cited his people to anger and hatred
in the schools and failed to meet his
obligations to crack down on vicious
extremist groups, and this hatred fi
nally bubbled over in the Intifada.
That is precisely why Arafat not only
cast away the offer, but refused to
make a counteroffer. Instead of lay
ing groundwork for peaceful coex
istence as Yitzhak Rabin and Shi
mon Peres did, he exploited his own
people into war and poverty as he
built a personal fortune of $1.3 bil
lion. As such, at Camp David, he was
unable to accept or make any sort of
peace deal at all.
The Israeli offer was fully in com
pliance with U.N. Resolution 242,
which was the basis fora negotiated
peace settlement. The authors of
Resolution 242 specifically chose
wording to allow for some variation
from the 1967 borders. It was not in
tended to suggest a unilateral or un
conditional withdrawal. Barak also
complied by proposing a just resolu
tion to the refugee problem. Israel
offered to admit tens of thousands
of refugees with family in Israel, and
included monstrous monetary
funds and the use of dismantled
Jewish settlements to provide per
manent housing for refugees.
Resolution 242, however, also
called on a complete termination of
violence and belligerency, and re
spect for Israel's right to live within
secure borders, which Arafat has
never complied with. In fact,
Arafat's "just solution" to the
refugee problem is for Israel, a
country of 5 million Jews and 1 mil
lion Arabs, to suddenly absorb a
Hood of several million Palestinian
refugees. This is simply his tool to
destroy Israel as a Jewish state.
Arafat should have accepted
Barak's offer, but he did not be
cause that would involve giving up
on his dream of acquiring all of Is
rael. Arafat then tried to deny that
there was ever a Jewish holy site in
Jerusalem, and he refused to recog
nize the Jewish historical connec

tion to Jerusalem, a severe new
roadblock he suddenly brought

up at Camp David. In short, it
is Arafat who stands in defi
ance of the guiding U.N.
resolutions.

You'll probably hear
that the Israeli offer broke
up the disputed territories

into little pieces. But the
fact that 95 to 97 percent of
the West Bank was offered
should convince anyone that

the land was contiguous. That
allegation is a flat lie. In the
last few offers, the Palestinian

land in the West Bank was one
contiguous piece. The disconti
nuity of the West Bank and Gaza

Strip is unavoidable, but Barak
even accepted the idea of a Pales
tinian-controlled road connecting
the two.

Arafat, just like the Palestinian
leaders who rejected the 1937
Peel Partition plan, rejected the
1947 U.N. Partition plan, and

rejected recognition of or peace
with Israel in the 1967 Khar
toum resolutions, simply can
not accept Israel's presence.

Arafat could not accept the
offer because he had al
lowed the extremist ele
ments of his society to

take too much control
In defiance of U.N. at
tempts to seek a nego-

tiated resolution,
Arafat and the
Arab world started
numerous wars

and continue
even today to
threaten Israel
with genocide.
Even if you re
ject these argu
ments, and you
feel Israel should
have offered

more, you must
admit that the re
maining disagree-

ments were awfully
small â€” the kind of
disagreements that

good-faith negotia
tions without the

threats and pressures of

the Intifada could have
smoothed over. So ask your-

self: Were these differences real
ly worth not even making a coun
teroffer? Were they really worth

starting a war over? Apparently,
Arafat did, and by rudely rejecting
Barak's overtures, he plunged the
region into chaos.
To summarize, the Israeli offer re
flected the deep consciousness in Is
rael of the importance of making a
just peace with its neighbor. The Is
raeli dream of a vivacious home for
Jews now could be realized alongside
a neighboring country of thriving
Palestinians in peace, harmony and
democracy. The growing umbrella of
peaceful neighbors that already in
cluded Jordan and Egypt would now
include the Palestinians. It was, in
essence, the true two-state, two-peo
ple resolution: a fully pragmatic ap
proach based on reality, not mythol
ogy. It could have ended the conflict
once and for all, and brought the
kind of hope that the Palestinians
and Israelis could use right now.
