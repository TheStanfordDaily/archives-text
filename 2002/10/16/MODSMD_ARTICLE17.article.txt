### COALITION FOR JUSTICE IN ISRAEL / PALESTINE 
The interpretation of Camp David
II that has crystallized in U.S. and Is
raeli memory glorifies the supposed
Israeli willingness to work for

peace while casting the Pales-

tinians as recalcitrant
warmongers. Yet if the
summit failed due to a

lack of vision, the my
opia was on the Israeli

side. What former Is
raeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak offered
at Camp David fell

woefully short of the
minimum require
ments fora just and
viable resolution to

the conflict. The
Palestinians could not
have accepted it as a
final peace deal.
To understand this

assessment, let's recall
what the Israeli-Palestini
an conflict is really about.

The conflict has its roots in
the century-old Zionist

movement, whose main goal
was the establishment of a
Jewish state in overwhelm
ingly non-Jewish Palestine.
Allying itself with Britain,
then the colonial power, the
Zionist movement organized
decades of Jewish immigra
tion into Palestine, against
Palestinian wishes.

The 1948 war drove
700,000 Palestinian refugees
into exile in surrounding
countries. Many were forced
out by Zionist forces that at
tacked Palestinian towns and
villages with the deliberate
aim of ethnic cleansing. The
State of Israel was estab
lished on 78 percent of his
toric Palestine. Israel then
closed its borders to prevent
the refugees' return, razed
over 400 Palestinian villages,
and confiscated refugee land
and property for use by Jew
ish immigrants.
In 1967, Israel com
pleted its conquest of the re
maining 22 percent of Pales
tine, capturing the West
Bank, the Gaza Strip and
East Jerusalem. These areas

were placed under a brutal
military occupation and
subjected to a massive
campaign to establish

Jewish-only settlements.
Israeli treatment of
Palestinian civilians in
the occupied territories
is characterized by
gross human rights

abuses including tor
ture, assassination, ar
bitrary detention,
land confiscation, ex
cessive use of force and
collective punishment.
Palestinian political
goals have been shaped

by this historical context.
Palestinians have sought a

just solution for the 4 mil
lion Palestinian refugees
which, if it does not undo all

the damage inflicted by the
1948 war, at least compensates Pales
tinians for their losses. Palestinians
have sought shared sovereignty over
Jerusalem, the political, religious and
cultural capital of Palestine. Above all,
Palestinians h:>ve sought an indepen
dent state tl rough which they can
achieve self-determination and have
their security and rights protected, in
stead of living under occupation or
colonization or as second-class citizens
in foreign countries.

In striving for these goals, the Pales
tinian movement has made major
concessions to the Israeli side in recog
nition of current realities on the
ground. The most significant is that
the Palestinians have recognized Is
rael and abandoned any claim of
sovereignty over the 78 percent of
Palestine that lies within Israel's inter
nationally-recognized borders. The
Palestinians have, in effect, agreed
that Palestinian self-determination
will be exercised only on the 22 per
cent of Palestine that make up the oc
cupied territories.
Consistent with this position, the
Palestinians have adopted a flexible
approach to the refugee issue, otter
ing to solve the problem in a way that
does not endanger the Jewish majori
ty within Israel — even though inter
national law requires a total return of
all refugees. The Palestinian formula
for peace is thus a two-state solution
with compensation for refugees and
shared sovereignty over Jerusalem.
This position has long been recog
nized as the most viable, achievable
and fair solution to the conflict.
Unfortunately, the Israeli side has
not reciprocated Palestinian conces
sions, and continues to adhere to
maximalist positions in its approach to
the conflict. Nowhere was this clearer
than at Camp David.
First, Israel offered no solution to
the refugee problem. This by itself
would have been a deal-breaker, since
it meant relinquishing the valid legal
and political rights of over half the
Palestinian population. In effect,
Palestinians were being asked to
sweep under the rug the principal his
torical injustice Israel had inflicted
upon them.
Second, the Israeli-proposed
Palestinian "state" would have been
divided into four non-contiguous en
claves completely surrounded by Is
raeli-controlled areas. The"state"
would have no control over the bor
der with Jordan, the Gaza Strip sea
border, or passage between the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip. The"state"
could thus be shut down at Israel's
whim — hardly an exercise in Pales
tinian sovereignty.
Third, the Israeli offer involved
annexing 9 percent of the West
Bank, including all major settlement
blocs, which contain around 150,000
Jewish settlers outside Jerusalem. Is
rael, not content with the 78 percent
of Palestine that Palestinians had al
ready conceded, was demanding
even more. The Israel proposal also
would have meant accepting the le
gitimacy of illegal settlements built
for Jews only on confiscated Pales
tinian land during the 35-year mili
tary occupation.
Fourth, Israel did not offer Pales
tinians a real sharing of Jerusalem.
Israel would keep all Israeli settle
ments in occupied East Jerusalem.
Palestinians would get sovereignty
over some outlying Palestinian
neighborhoods, but not the old city
of Jerusalem where the third holiest
site in Islam, the Haram al-Sharif, is
located. This meant Palestinian ac
cess to the old city and the Haram al-
Sharif would remain subject to Is
raeli discretion.
For these reasons, Barak's "gener
ous offer" at Camp David was any
thing but generous. Palestinian
sovereignty? No. Palestinian securi
ty? No. Solution to the refugee prob
lem? No. Sharing of Jerusalem? No.
Dismantling of Israeli settlements?
No. Barak's proposal amounted to
nothing more than consolidation of
the Israeli occupation, rejection of
the minimum requirements fora just
peace, and perpetuation of Israeli vi
olations of international law. The
Palestinians were right to turn it
down — accepting it would have
been glorified surrender.
