# Univ. raises laundry, printing fees
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF 
Laundry and printing costs are on the rise, with washing and
drying now costing $1 each per load and printing fees increas
ing to 10 cents per page University-wide. These two unrelated
price hikes both took effect in the beginning of this academic
year.
While many freshmen are unaware that there has been a
change, upperclassmen are more responsive to the differences.
"1 thought laundry was expensive before the 25-cent price
hike," said junior Jennifer Kim. "It seems like the University is
trying to get as much money out of us as possible."
This is the University's first laundry-price increase since
1995, and it applies to all undergraduate and graduate housing.
I here is no longer a discount available for students using the
Stanford Card Plan.
Roger Whitney, executive director of student housing, ex
plained that the causes of the increase in laundry prices stem
from escalating utilities costs in (lalifornia.
"We are paying 60 percent more for electricity, 25 percent
more for gas and 30 percent more for water than we did in
1999," he said.
Whitney noted that there has also been an increase in labor
costs since 1995, an increase which did not result in a corre
sponding jump in laundry prices.
"We are still not covering the costs we have incurred," he said.
Student 1 lousing and Services is also working continually to
renovate laundry rooms and add more machines. Stern Hall is
one of the first dorms to have undergone an extensive laundry
room renovation.
Freshman Xach Warren did not find the Stanford laundry
prices to be excessively high.
"1 have been to several universities in Virginia, and their
prices are about the same," he said.
As for printing costs, the price has risen from seven cents to
10 cents per page, and it applies to printers across the campus,
including those in Meyer Library, Tresidder Union and dorm
computer clusters. For the first time, printing at Green Library
will no longer be free.
This price increase comes at a time when there are a growing
number of classes that post assignments and lecture notes on
line.
"The library had to start charging for its printing because of
the excessive volume of printing and because of students who
simply abused the privilege," said Kathy Kerns, head of Green's
information center. She also noted that printing costs were ris
ing, and the library faced budget cuts across the board.
Academic Technology Manager Olivia Williamson said that
the 10 cents per page currently being charged will just go to
cover the library's costs.
Sarah Schulman, director of the ASSU Cost of Living Cam
paign, said, "The campaign is working on its own independent
research that might validate the claims of University personnel."
It is also working on price comparisons of Stanford printing and
laundry costs with those of other universities and service
providers in the Bay Area.

Many students are not bothered by the new prices.
" Three cents isn't really a big deal," said freshman Corie
Geballe.
Network and Systems Administrator Ethan Rikleen ex
plained that there was not enough money previously to replace
the printers after three to four years of use.
"The extra money will help us make improvements to the
PDNotify print accounting system and have enough money for
printer repair and replacement. We are not making any extra
income," Rickleen said.
Neither of these cost increases is expected to have a signifi
cant impact on students' habits and lifestyle.
"The price has not increased enough for me to do less laun
dry or stop using a printer," said senior Anne Cabrillo. "But it's
still annoying."
