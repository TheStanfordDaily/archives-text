## White gloves, white boots and red dresses The
						Stanford Dollies 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Symbols come and go: the Indian,
the Cardinal, the Tree.
And styles change.
Yet amid the flux of Stanford tradi
tion, there is one institution that re
mains unbending.
Every autumn five red-arid-white
clad women can he seen waving pom
pons and flashing their white teeth in
Stanford Stadium.
These "darling demoiselles of de
lightful dancing"are the Stanford Dol
lies.
So began a 1979 Daily article
about the Dollies, and 23 years
later the words ring just as true.
At a school where the band
doesn't march, the cheers are led
by a group clad in Hawaiian shirts
and Gilligan hats and the fight
song is a '70s British rock tune, the
Dollies seem to make a lot of sense.

()l course, that doesn't mean
coming up with a simple definition
for what the Dollies are is any easi
er. Perhaps it's a puzzle best solved
by the Dollies themselves.
"This is the most famous ques
tion throughout the entire year,"
says sophomore Malia Skaer, who
is part of this year's Dollie pentad.
"What are you? Are you cheer
leaders? We are a group of five
trained dancers. We don't yell, we
don't tumble, we don't stunt, we
don't jump."
Unsatisfied to settle fora nega
tive definition, the other four Dol
lies are quick to jump in, in unison
no less.
"We'rejust Dollies."
With how long the Dollies have
been around, there are few among
the Cardinal faithful that need any
more of a definition than that.
Skaer, seniors Marisa Dye and
Erin Christofferson, junior
Nevenka Mattenet and sopho

more Valerie Rozycki comprise
the current Dollie lineup, the 47th
group of Stanford women to don
the white gloves, the white boots
(look for them during football
pregames) and the red dresses
synonymous with the Dollies.
And given how hard each year's
quintet works, the women should
feel free to give any kind of answer
they want. #
Their training begins in August
with a Dollie boot camp of all-day
rehearsals up until the beginning
of school. During the year, the
Dollies have a practice schedule
that rivals that of any varsity team
at Stanford, and their role as Uni
versity ambassadors fills their cal
endar with around five perfor
mances every week, including a
number of off-campus appear
ances that Stanford students never
even see.

The Dollies displayed their style and grace once again for all of Stanford to see during a performance earlier this year,
dancing with the Stanford Band.
