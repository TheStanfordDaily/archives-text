## White gloves, white boots and red dresses The 						Stanford Dollies 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Symbols come and go: the Indian,
the Cardinal, the Tree.
And styles change.
Yet amid the flux of Stanford tradi
tion, there is one institution that re
mains unbending.
Every autumn five red-arid-white
clad women can he seen waving pom
pons and flashing their white teeth in
Stanford Stadium.
These "darling demoiselles of de
lightful dancing"are the Stanford Dol
lies.
So began a 1979 Daily article
about the Dollies, and 23 years
later the words ring just as true.
At a school where the band
doesn't march, the cheers are led
by a group clad in Hawaiian shirts
and Gilligan hats and the fight
song is a '70s British rock tune, the
Dollies seem to make a lot of sense.

()l course, that doesn't mean
coming up with a simple definition
for what the Dollies are is any easi
er. Perhaps it's a puzzle best solved
by the Dollies themselves.
"This is the most famous ques
tion throughout the entire year,"
says sophomore Malia Skaer, who
is part of this year's Dollie pentad.
"What are you? Are you cheer
leaders? We are a group of five
trained dancers. We don't yell, we
don't tumble, we don't stunt, we
don't jump."
Unsatisfied to settle fora nega
tive definition, the other four Dol
lies are quick to jump in, in unison
no less.
"We'rejust Dollies."
With how long the Dollies have
been around, there are few among
the Cardinal faithful that need any
more of a definition than that.
Skaer, seniors Marisa Dye and
Erin Christofferson, junior
Nevenka Mattenet and sopho

more Valerie Rozycki comprise
the current Dollie lineup, the 47th
group of Stanford women to don
the white gloves, the white boots
(look for them during football
pregames) and the red dresses
synonymous with the Dollies.
And given how hard each year's
quintet works, the women should
feel free to give any kind of answer
they want. #
Their training begins in August
with a Dollie boot camp of all-day
rehearsals up until the beginning
of school. During the year, the
Dollies have a practice schedule
that rivals that of any varsity team
at Stanford, and their role as Uni
versity ambassadors fills their cal
endar with around five perfor
mances every week, including a
number of off-campus appear
ances that Stanford students never
even see.

The Dollies displayed their style and grace once again for all of Stanford to see during a performance earlier this year,
dancing with the Stanford Band.
"We don't get to choose when we
come to events," Rozycki says as she
and the other Dollies wrap up one
of their daily two-hour rehearsals at
the Klliot Programming Outer.
"We have to be on top of things. We
have to look good. We don't mess
around; it's really serious.
"The st till oil campus is not just
a 30-minute deal. We're gone fora
big part of the day. We're not on
scholarship; we're students, and
we're here for academic reasons.
This is an additional thing we do,
but we devote so much time to it
every day."
Don't get them wrong — they
do love this stuff.
"It's so worth it. It's so much
fun," Mattenet says. "It's out of
control how close we are."
However, the Dollies' training
regimen and large repertoire of
dances — some of which they
choreographed themselves and
some which have been passed
down from Dollie generation to
generation — belie the common
association of the Dollies with the
irreverence of the Stanford Band,
to which they are technically an
"accessory."
The Dollies' polished dancing
and the Band's not-always-pol
ished playing may seem to make
for strange bedfellows, hut nei

(her group seems to want it any
other way.
"The Band is known for being
wild and crazy, but it keeps it inter
esting. 11 would be boring il we
were dancing to a CI) all tne time,"
Dye says. "They call a song and
maybe it's faster than we're used
to, or maybe they do it slow all of
the sudden, or maybe there's a
count missing here or there. It
keeps our job interesting."
The Band's sentiments to
wards the Dollies are on the same
wavelength, and with good rea
son: the Band picks the Dollies
each winter, leading up to the an
nual Dollie Splash in the spring,
when the new Dollies make their
debut — in the Claw.
"It works pretty well. The Dollies
are always the best dancers we can
find, but they're also people who
know what they're getting into,"
says LSJUMB member Mike Hui
jon at the Band's weekly rehearsal
in the temporary Band Shak near
the Fol d Center. "As a group, they
gel really well with the band.
"On the one hand, I'm amazed
that we can find five people who
are willing to put up with us fora
year. On the other hand, every
Dollie I've talked to always talks
about how much of an honor it is to
be a Dollie, and they remember
their Dollie year forever."
The focus on bringing in more
skilled dancers has been one of the
biggest changes that the Dollies
have gone through since their in

ception in 195(5.
In fact, it's one of the only
changes that the Dollies have
made over the years, though some
changes to the Dollies' look have
taken place. The most notable of
these changes occurred in the late
'70s and early '80s after Stanford
dropped the Indian mascot and
the Dollies fazed out the tradition
al Indian-inlluenced designs on
their costumes.
"The Dollies have become
much more professional," said
Elena Beyers '79, who was a Dol
lie during the 1977-1978 school
year. "In the pools they come
from now, dance ability has be
come much more important. The
fact that Dollies no longer wear
boots [when they dance] has
changed the dancing consider
ably. It's more athletic now."
Becoming a Dollie is a lifelong
dream for some, especially among
those who grew up around Stan
ford, like Christofferson and
Rozycki.
"I live around here, so I'd seen
them [before attending Stanford].
They always came to the CChristmas
parade," Christofferson says with a
big smile. "I never thought I would
be that good a dancer. I always
used to think it would be really
cool to be a Dollie."
For others, trying out to be a
Dollie was more of a spur-of-the
moment decision.
"It wasn't exactly something 1
thought I could do," Dye says."It

wasn't until my junior year that I
decided to try out, and I'm so glad
I did because it's been such a won
derful experience."
Whatever the impetus behind
each Dollie's choice to try out, it's

clear that the Dollies have made
their mark on Stanford athletics —
and the campus as a whole.
There's a half century of tradi
tion behind those white gloves
and the red dresses, which are for

ever entrenched in Stanford lore.
And you can bet that after another
50 years, the answer to the pri
mordial question about them will
still be the sanr*

ANDREW PETERMAN/The Stanford Daily
The Dollies practice last night outside the Elliot Programming Center. Being a Dolly may look like all smiles, but Dolly
training camp begins in August, and the women perform approximately five times per week.
Symbols come and go: the Indian,
the Cardinal, the Tree.
And styles change.
Yet amid the flux of Stanford tradi
tion, there is one institution that re
mains unbending.
Every autumn five red-arid-white
clad women can he seen waving pom
pons and flashing their white teeth in
Stanford Stadium.
These "darling demoiselles of de
lightful dancing"are the Stanford Dol
lies.
So began a 1979 Daily article
about the Dollies, and 23 years
later the words ring just as true.
At a school where the band
doesn't march, the cheers are led
by a group clad in Hawaiian shirts
and Gilligan hats and the fight
song is a '70s British rock tune, the
Dollies seem to make a lot of sense.

()l course, that doesn't mean
coming up with a simple definition
for what the Dollies are is any easi
er. Perhaps it's a puzzle best solved
by the Dollies themselves.
"This is the most famous ques
tion throughout the entire year,"
says sophomore Malia Skaer, who
is part of this year's Dollie pentad.
"What are you? Are you cheer
leaders? We are a group of five
trained dancers. We don't yell, we
don't tumble, we don't stunt, we
don't jump."
Unsatisfied to settle fora nega
tive definition, the other four Dol
lies are quick to jump in, in unison
no less.
"We'rejust Dollies."
With how long the Dollies have
been around, there are few among
the Cardinal faithful that need any
more of a definition than that.
Skaer, seniors Marisa Dye and
Erin Christofferson, junior
Nevenka Mattenet and sopho

more Valerie Rozycki comprise
the current Dollie lineup, the 47th
group of Stanford women to don
the white gloves, the white boots
(look for them during football
pregames) and the red dresses
synonymous with the Dollies.
And given how hard each year's
quintet works, the women should
feel free to give any kind of answer
they want. #
Their training begins in August
with a Dollie boot camp of all-day
rehearsals up until the beginning
of school. During the year, the
Dollies have a practice schedule
that rivals that of any varsity team
at Stanford, and their role as Uni
versity ambassadors fills their cal
endar with around five perfor
mances every week, including a
number of off-campus appear
ances that Stanford students never
even see.

The Dollies displayed their style and grace once again for all of Stanford to see during a performance earlier this year,
dancing with the Stanford Band.
"We don't get to choose when we
come to events," Rozycki says as she
and the other Dollies wrap up one
of their daily two-hour rehearsals at
the Klliot Programming Outer.
"We have to be on top of things. We
have to look good. We don't mess
around; it's really serious.
"The st till oil campus is not just
a 30-minute deal. We're gone fora
big part of the day. We're not on
scholarship; we're students, and
we're here for academic reasons.
This is an additional thing we do,
but we devote so much time to it
every day."
Don't get them wrong — they
do love this stuff.
"It's so worth it. It's so much
fun," Mattenet says. "It's out of
control how close we are."
However, the Dollies' training
regimen and large repertoire of
dances — some of which they
choreographed themselves and
some which have been passed
down from Dollie generation to
generation — belie the common
association of the Dollies with the
irreverence of the Stanford Band,
to which they are technically an
"accessory."
The Dollies' polished dancing
and the Band's not-always-pol
ished playing may seem to make
for strange bedfellows, hut nei

(her group seems to want it any
other way.
"The Band is known for being
wild and crazy, but it keeps it inter
esting. 11 would be boring il we
were dancing to a CI) all tne time,"
Dye says. "They call a song and
maybe it's faster than we're used
to, or maybe they do it slow all of
the sudden, or maybe there's a
count missing here or there. It
keeps our job interesting."
The Band's sentiments to
wards the Dollies are on the same
wavelength, and with good rea
son: the Band picks the Dollies
each winter, leading up to the an
nual Dollie Splash in the spring,
when the new Dollies make their
debut — in the Claw.
"It works pretty well. The Dollies
are always the best dancers we can
find, but they're also people who
know what they're getting into,"
says LSJUMB member Mike Hui
jon at the Band's weekly rehearsal
in the temporary Band Shak near
the Fol d Center. "As a group, they
gel really well with the band.
"On the one hand, I'm amazed
that we can find five people who
are willing to put up with us fora
year. On the other hand, every
Dollie I've talked to always talks
about how much of an honor it is to
be a Dollie, and they remember
their Dollie year forever."
The focus on bringing in more
skilled dancers has been one of the
biggest changes that the Dollies
have gone through since their in

ception in 195(5.
In fact, it's one of the only
changes that the Dollies have
made over the years, though some
changes to the Dollies' look have
taken place. The most notable of
these changes occurred in the late
'70s and early '80s after Stanford
dropped the Indian mascot and
the Dollies fazed out the tradition
al Indian-inlluenced designs on
their costumes.
"The Dollies have become
much more professional," said
Elena Beyers '79, who was a Dol
lie during the 1977-1978 school
year. "In the pools they come
from now, dance ability has be
come much more important. The
fact that Dollies no longer wear
boots [when they dance] has
changed the dancing consider
ably. It's more athletic now."
Becoming a Dollie is a lifelong
dream for some, especially among
those who grew up around Stan
ford, like Christofferson and
Rozycki.
"I live around here, so I'd seen
them [before attending Stanford].
They always came to the CChristmas
parade," Christofferson says with a
big smile. "I never thought I would
be that good a dancer. I always
used to think it would be really
cool to be a Dollie."
For others, trying out to be a
Dollie was more of a spur-of-the
moment decision.
"It wasn't exactly something 1
thought I could do," Dye says."It

wasn't until my junior year that I
decided to try out, and I'm so glad
I did because it's been such a won
derful experience."
Whatever the impetus behind
each Dollie's choice to try out, it's

clear that the Dollies have made
their mark on Stanford athletics —
and the campus as a whole.
