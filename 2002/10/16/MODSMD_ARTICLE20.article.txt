# Card sailing battles East Coast elements

### MIA ASHTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Cardinal was already up
fora real challenge this past week
end, as five Stanford sailors were
competing in the season's toughest
women's races at Navy Fall
Women's Regatta. However, the
Cardinal soon saw the tough get
tougher, as poor weather was
c|uic kly thrown into the equation.
This marked the second
straight weekend that the Cardi
nal, used to practicing in the windy
conditions of the Bay Area, had to
battle light wind. The previous
weekend's Bryson Women's com
petition posed winds of only three
to-six knots. At Navy, the women
found themselves in similar condi
tions, but this time they also had to
face rain.
Coach Jay Kehoe observed
early on that weather might be a
challenge, explaining that he was
"worried that the dreary East
Coast conditions would put a
dar.per ~>n my California girls."
But the Cardinal overcame
wind and weather to make a fair
showing at uit event, even after
the low v.ind conditions forced a
delay in Saturday's competition.
When the racing finally began,

the Cardinal sailed solidly. The A-
Division team of junior Jen Porter
and sophomore Jessie Duncan
placed fifth and first in its first two
races, respectively, while the B-Di
vision team, composed of juniors
Ashley Frush and Shadi Mehraein,
placed ninth and second.
The wind seemed to have its
greatest eflect on singlehanded C-
Division competitor junior Liz
Shearer, who struggled in her first
three races Saturday, placing sixth,
10th and 11th, respectively. How
ever, as the clay went on and the
wind picked up, Shearer earned
the Cardinal second, third and
fifth place finishes in races later in
the competition.
Kehoe was pleased with the
team's performance, especially in
light of the fact that the Cardinal's
training varies so much from its
competitors.
" The confidence was there,"
Kehoe said, "and their speed in the
light air was comparable to the
schools that practice in those con
ditions all the time."
Kehoe had good reason for his
praise, as the Cardinal closed the
first clay of racing tied with host
Navy for fifth place. Yet the poor
weather quashed any hopes of a
rally, as Navy cancelled the regatta

at 2:00 p.m. on Sunday due to the
windless conditions.
Ultimately, Porter and Duncan
finished 10th in the A-Division,
Frush and Mehraein came in
fourth in the B-Division and
Shearer placed 10th in the single
handed C-Division. Overall, the
Cardinal placed sixth, a solid per
formance on which it will hope to
improve at the Yale Women's Re
gatta on Saturday.
While Porter, Duncan, Frush,

Mehraein and Shearer grappled
with poor sailing weather and chal
lenging competition, other mem
bers of the team were participating
at the annual Stoney Burke Inter
sectional with relative success.
California hosted the event on
Oct. 12 and Oct. 13 at Treasure Is
land in the San Francisco Bay.
