### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With a fine venue and a strong
field, the Mackenzie Invitational
in Fairfax, Calif., provided the
Stanford men's golf team with a
great chance to rebound from a
tough outing last week.
However, for the second con
secutive event, the Cardinal start
ed poorly and took itself out of the
running early, finishing in 16th
place out of 17 teams.
Going into the event, it was ap
parent that the Stanford squad
would need another strong per
formance out of its three senior
players, with two freshmen round
ing out the group.
Senior Ron Won did his part.
After a pair of 15th-place finishes
in his first two events of the year,
he got out to an excellent start on
Monday, carding an opening
round 07.
He followed up that 4-under
par performance with a 09 in the
second round, leaving himself in a
tic for sixth place (-(>) heading into
the final 18 holes.
Unfortunately, Won's senior
teammates were unable to follow
his lead. Jim Seki, the seventh
ranked golfer in the nation, man

aged only a 4-over-par 75 in an
opening round that saw more
than a third of the field break par.
A second-round 72 helped Seki get
back on track slightly, but still left
him hovering in 50th place overall.
Del de Windt, the final member
of the Cardinal's senior trio, shot a
pair of 78s in his first two rounds
and sat tied for 82nd with 18 holes
left to play.
As for the Cardinal's young
guns, Kyle Gentry shot 75-77 to tie
for 76th, and Scott Mac Donald
played the first round of his col
lege career in 8-over par. Another
79 in the second round left the
first-year player in 87th place
overall.
It all added up lo a two-round
total of 591, which landed Stan
ford in a tie for 16th with UC-
Santa Barbara.
While the CCardinal struggled to
get its bearings, both UCLA and
Fresno State appeared quite com
fortable at the Meadow Club, with
the Bruins and Bulldogs knotted
after two rounds in a first-place tie
at 16-under-par.
A different day only brought
similar results for the Cardinal on
Tuesday. Seki, looking to get his

through. At the Mackenzie Invitational last weekend, Won was one of the few
bright spots for the Cardinal, wrapping up his third straight top-15 finish.
