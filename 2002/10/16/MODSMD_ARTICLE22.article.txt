# Can Ryan Stewart replace coach Teevens?
## 
### 
For the 18-or-so people in
attendance at this Satur
day's football game
against Washington
State, I am sure that the 36-11
blowout loss was as bile-swallowing
an event for you as it was for me.
Watching the Cougars of all teams
(I mean, this is the team that grad
uated Ryan Leaf for the sake of all
things decent) come into Stanford
Stadium and push us around like
the wife of a drunken Dallas Cow
boys lan after a Cowboys loss was
just too much to handle.
Sooner or later, one just has to
question the ability of the new
coaching stall to lead this football
team. After

three embar
rassing defeats
in a row, I'm
starting to think
that I could do a
better job coach
ing the team.
And with
good cause.
I mean, how

hard can coaching at this level re
ally be? There can't be all that
much to it. I know that it may not
exactly capture all of the com
plexities of real life play-calling,
but I am in the middle of my
third consecutive undefeated
season with my Madden 2003
video game franchise for Xbox—
and that's at the NFL level.
Coach Buddy Teevens doesn't
even have to deal with the salary
cap constraints and white-hot
pressure that come from being
an NFL coach like I have to put
up with on a daily basis.
Not only that, but I also creat
ed the franchise—the "Atown
Playaz" (Arlington, Texas) — all
by myself after relocating and
renaming the Carolina Pan
thers. Fhe uniforms, the stadi
um layout, the oh-so-clever
team name (complete with ver
nacular spelling to catch that
hip, young effect) were all pro
jects of my own design without
any outside help whatsoever.
The Cardinal football team has
about 12 assistant coaches and
hordes of others who handle all
the things that I had to grind out
myself. And people say college
head coaches don't have it easy.
But for the disbelievers out
there who don't see the direct
link between success in the best
selling football video game fran
chise of all time and success as a
college head coach, I have real
life experience as well. Just this
past week, I successfully used
hindsight to point out every mis
take that the Cardinal coaching
staff made in the game, and I
of ten went so far as to suggest al
ternative plays that possibly
could have worked better.
Like when we went for the

field goal near the end of the
first half. At the time, 1 wasn't
sure whether going for it on
fourth down or attempting the
kick was the right call. But as
soon as the kick missed its mark,
I was absolutely sure that we
should have gone for it, possibly
with a pass of some sort, maybe
to Teyo. It is the mark of a great
coach who can use all the tools in
his arsenal, especially hindsight,
to the advantage of his team.
One thing I've noticed is that
the Cardinal offense seems so
bland this year as opposed to the
Fun-N-Gun that we were
promised. If I were coach, I
would propose that we funnify
the offense by, say, 22 percent.
There is a wealth of knowledge
in the area of offensive funnifica
tion from which I would draw.
Like recruiting a Kathy Ire
land look-a-like from a local girls
soccer team to be my strong
legged kicker a la "Necessary
Roughness." We could immedi
ately improve our scoring range
and versatility, with sexy results.
Failing that, importing a South
American donkey with a pen
chant for 70-yard field goals has
also been met with success in the
past (admit it, you know you re
member the Disney film "Gus").
And how about changing up
the playbook just a tad to mod
ernize our attack? I have yet to see
a single statue-of-liberty-triple-re
verse-Ilea-flicker-double-pass-to-
the-eligible-tackle-hook-and-lad-
der play. Buddy, if you don't try
it, you'll never know.
When it comes right down to
it, a lot of things have gone
wrong for the Cardinal football
team early this year, but none of
them are the fault of any one
man. Even though I stand by my
claim that I kick ass in Madden
2003, I realize that coaching in
the shadow of the departed Ty
rone Willingham, especially
amidst his success in South
Bend, is one of the toughest sit
uations in college sports, and I
envy no one in that position.
So before we go ahead and of
ficially swear me in as the next
head coach of Cardinal football,
let's give the current staff and
the current team a chance to
turn its season around. Let's
cheer in the stands instead of
doing problem sets. Let's ap
plaud our successes instead of
booing our failures. Hell, let's
take the first step and actually go
to the game. Because if you
don't try it, you'll never know.
