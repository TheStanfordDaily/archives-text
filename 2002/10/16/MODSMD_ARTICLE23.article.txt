# Willingham to stay with plan
## 
### 
SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) —
He's not going to criticize, he's not
going to fret and he's not going to
look too far ahead.
Nope, Tyrone Willingham is
going to stick with the game plan
that has No. 7 Notre Dame off to
its best start in nine years.
The Irish offense and defense
had their worst performances of
the season in a 14-6 win over Pitts
burgh, and now the team must
play in the mile-high altitude at
No. 18 Air Force at 10 p.m. EDT
on Saturday.
Then there's the upcoming
road game against No. 12 Florida
State (5-2).
Still, Willingham refuses to call
any game more crucial than the
previous six.
"I would never look at the
schedule and say this one is any
more difficult than the other ones
because 1 know sometimes the
thought process that goes on with
players," Willingham said. "It be
comes extremely difficult to win
any game at any time."

As an example, Willingham
pointed to Michigan State's 46-22
loss to California one week before
the Spartans faced the Irish.
"Somehow, some of their play
ers might have thought that Cali
fornia was insignificant on that
schedule, or maybe someone had
told them that was an easy football
game," Willingham said. "That
did not turn out to be an easy foot
ball game."
Willingham shouldn't have to
worry much about the Irish (6-0)
thinking Air Force (6-0) will be an
easy game. 1 he unbeaten Falcons
are 3-point favorites, and the Irish
remember the Falcons scoring 18
fourth-quarter points two years
ago to force overtime in a game
the Irish eventually won 34-31.
He does have to worry about
stopping Air Force's triple-threat
option under quarterback
Chance Harridge, who has more
touchdowns (15) than the Irish of
fense (11). Harridge is averaging
102.5 a yards rushing, compared
to the 142.7 yards the Irish are av-

eraging.
The Irish are still struggling to
learn the West Coast offense that
Willingham brought with him
from Stanford in an attempt to im
prove what had been the nation's
sixth-worst offense, averaging
289.7 yards last year.
Midway through the season,
the Irish have the nation's fifth
worst offense at 293 yards per
game.
Willingham's offense is still not
coming naturally to the Irish.
"Anytime a young man is
thinking, the ability to execute is
reduced," he said.
But Willingham is sticking with
the mantra that the only statistic
that matters is whether the Irish
win. If he knows how the Irish are
succeeding, he not telling.
"That is always a difficult ques
tion to answer," he said. "There
are so many things that go into it,
I'm not sure you could ever put
your linger on any one thing."
Whatever it is, Willingham is
planning to stick with it.
