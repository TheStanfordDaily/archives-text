## Networking with no wires attached Despite demand, wireless connections are limited on campus 
### JONATHAN THAW 
Imagine being able to write e
mail while drinking Jamba Juice,
search Google during class and
surf the web while lounging in the
sun — all on your laptop — with
no wires attached. That's the
promise of wireless networking,
which is set to become another
typical feature of campus life.
For laptop owners, wireless
networking seems to make a lot of
sense. With a wireless connection,
you can connect to the Internet
without worrying about cables
and finding network connection
sockets — the connection is magi
cally provided "over the air."
At the moment, Stanford's
wireless network extends to most
departments and buildings
around the center of campus, in
cluding the Main Quad, the Law
and Medical Schools, School of
Education, Tresidder Union and
a number of other libraries and
departments.
"We see great potential for
wireless at the University," said
Tony Holland, executive director
of Communication and Network
ing Services at Information Tech
nology Systems and Services
(ITSS).
And one of the best features of
wireless networking: It's currently
free to students. Unlike wired In
ternet connections in dorms,
which cost $10 per month, there
are currently no fees to use a wire
less connection, as the costs are
covered by the various depart
ments where the service is avail
able.
"We are still working with Aca
demic Computing on how we
model the service," Holland said.
But, at least in the short term, the
service is likely to remain free.
One major disadvantage of the
system, however, is that there is
currently no wireless coverage in
most undergraduate and gradu
ate residences.
A program to pilot wireless
connections in Wilbur and Stern
Halls is due to start soon, and will

run for six months. The pilot is a
collaboration between ITSS and
Residential Computing, the pro
gram responsible for computing
in dorms on campus.
As fora wider implementation
of services, Holland said that
"there is no specific plan for fund
ing or timescales for when it would
happen."
Although wireless connectivity
is slowly creeping over campus,
the way the program is funded
and coordinated means that t here
may be gaps in coverage in the fu
ture. Holland's team at ITSS helps
coordinate the installation of wire
less services within buildings and
departments, although the de
partments are responsible for
footing the bill. Without any major
source of central funding for wire
less networking, it could be a long
time before the entire campus is
covered.
Universities around the coun
try are also beginning to adopt
wireless networking. Carnegie
Mellon University, which started
its wireless research network in
1994, now has one of the largest
wireless infrastructures of its type
anywhere.
Although wireless is not yet a
way of life at Stanford, we do not
seem to be lagging too far behind
rival universities.
"This is not the leading univer
sity in terms of wireless, but we are
certainly not far behind," said
Francois Bar, assistant professor
in communication.
So how does one sign up for
wireless networking? First, you'll
need a laptop computer with a
Type II PCMCIA slot. Into this
slot goes a wireless network
adapter, which generally cost
around $100. Some newer laptop
models come with wireless con
nections built in, so there is no
need for the adapter. After activat
ing the connection by submitting
some details online and down
loading the software, your days of
wireless web surfing can begin.
Students who have used wire
less during class seem enthusiastic.
"I like the alternate source it
gives me in lectures," said Kevin
Lim, a master's student in the De
partment of Communication.

"Some profs are bound to refer
ence some cutting-edge concept
or recent development. Being
able to use the web to be another
informant about these topics real
ly enriches lectures."
Lim also noted that many Stan
lord students don't even know
that wireless networking is avail
able.
On learning about the service,
Francine Miller, a masters student
in journalism, commented on the
possible implications for informa
tion overload.
"It's a real reflection of our
times," she said. "It's no longer
enough for us to just check our
email after getting home at the
end of the day. We have to keep
our lingers on the pulse every sec
ond wherever possible."

Wireless connections are available in most academic departments across
campus. A six-month pilot program will begin soon to offer wireless connec
tions in Wilbur and Stern Halls.
