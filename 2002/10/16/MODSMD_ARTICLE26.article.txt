# Stanford maintains copyright policy
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"We say, 'Don't do it' because it is against
the law and University policy, and we don't
scan computers lor content," said (led Ben
nett, Director of Information Security Services
in reference to Stanford's policy toward copy
righted media and downloading them from
the Internet.
"If a student downloads Men In Black If,
we're not looking for that," Bennett said. "We
aren't making sure yon don't."
Bennett was responding to a letter sent out
by the Recording Industry Association of
America (RIAA), the Motion I'ictlire Associa
tion of America (MPAA) and other media as
sociations urging colleges and universities to
educate their students about copyright laws
and restrict illegal distribution of copyrighted
materials. The letter was accompanied by one
from the Americ an Council of Education and

other university associations urging universi
ties to discuss copyright and its proper role on
a college campus.
"We are concerned that an increasing and
significant number o! students are using uni
versity networks to engage in online piracy of
copyrighted creative works," the media com
panies wrote. " The educational purpose for
which these networks were built is demeaned
by such illegal behavior and is inconsistent
with the ethical principles underlying the uni
versity community."
Regardless of pleas by media companies,
Stanford has a policy in place and has no plans
to change it any time soon.
"We believe in copyright," Bennett said.
" The University takes advantage of copyright
when publishing works." 1 lowever, that copy
right has never been something easy to en
force, and Stanford takes a hands-oil' ap-

proach to network usage on its
network.
Stanford handles most copy
right violations according to the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act
(DMCA). I he RIAA frequently
scans Stanford's networks, and
when the association finds a user
sharing copyrighted files, the user
is reported to Stanford's Informa
tion Security Services. The Uni
versity immediately informs the
violator that they have been found
to be sharing files illegally. "Nine
ty nine percent of the time people
have no idea they're sharing
stuff," Bennett said. If users re
spond quickly, then their Internet
connection is unaffected, other
wise the connection is shut off.
This quarter, ITSS has re
ceived four or five notices of copy
right infringement on average
each day, up from the average of
one to two per day, but Bennett
said this was to be expected with
new users on the network.
Stanford's policy already ad
dresses the two main concerns put
forward by the media companies
in their letter.
"Colleges and universities
should not be in the business of
condoning or promoting unlaw
ful activities," the media compa
nies wrote, encouraging more
education about the law. Ben
nett emphasized that Stanford
has always discouraged copy
right violation.
"Not only is piracy of copy
righted works illegal, it can take
up a significant percentage of a

university's costly bandwidth,"
wrote the media companies. Stan
lord already addresses this prob
lem by limiting the amount of traf
fic that outside users can direct to
the Stanford network.
"Stanford does not limit band
width of on-campus users to the
Internet, but only restricts traffic
going off-campus," said Phil
Reese, director of Network Sys
tems. "Of the two main Internet
connections, the connection to the
residences has traffic-shaping
technology." The capability limits
traffic from certain protocols,
mostly those associated with the
sharing of MP3s and movies,
going out from the residences.
"Our goal is not to impede, but
to keep the bits moving," Reese
said. "The student load is as large
as the load to the rest of campus,
and students actually have more
bandwidth than the rest of cam
pus." Reese declined to provide
specific numbers about the band
width limits, but noted that Stan
ford has plenty of bandwidth for
legitimate uses.
Sentiment varies widely as to
what a university's proper role in
copyright enforcement should be,
but few students find fault with
Stanford's policies. "I don't think
it's the role or responsibility of a
university to police its users," said
Jason Anderson, resident com
puter coordinator in Schiff
House. "It's up to each person as
a citizen to decide whether they
choose to abide by the rules."
Bennett summed up Stanford's
pragmatic approach, which some
students view as a license to do
whatever they want so long as they
don't share files. "So far, it seems
to be working," he said.

students view as a license to do
whatever they want so long as they
don't share files. "So far, it seems
to be working," he said.
"We say, 'Don't do it' because it is against
the law and University policy, and we don't
scan computers lor content," said (led Ben
nett, Director of Information Security Services
in reference to Stanford's policy toward copy
righted media and downloading them from
the Internet.
"If a student downloads Men In Black If,
we're not looking for that," Bennett said. "We
aren't making sure yon don't."
Bennett was responding to a letter sent out
by the Recording Industry Association of
America (RIAA), the Motion I'ictlire Associa
tion of America (MPAA) and other media as
sociations urging colleges and universities to
educate their students about copyright laws
and restrict illegal distribution of copyrighted
materials. The letter was accompanied by one
from the Americ an Council of Education and

other university associations urging universi
ties to discuss copyright and its proper role on
a college campus.
"We are concerned that an increasing and
significant number o! students are using uni
versity networks to engage in online piracy of
copyrighted creative works," the media com
panies wrote. " The educational purpose for
which these networks were built is demeaned
by such illegal behavior and is inconsistent
with the ethical principles underlying the uni
versity community."
Regardless of pleas by media companies,
Stanford has a policy in place and has no plans
to change it any time soon.
"We believe in copyright," Bennett said.
" The University takes advantage of copyright
when publishing works." 1 lowever, that copy
right has never been something easy to en
force, and Stanford takes a hands-oil' ap-

proach to network usage on its
network.
Stanford handles most copy
right violations according to the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act
(DMCA). I he RIAA frequently
scans Stanford's networks, and
when the association finds a user
sharing copyrighted files, the user
is reported to Stanford's Informa
tion Security Services. The Uni
versity immediately informs the
violator that they have been found
to be sharing files illegally. "Nine
ty nine percent of the time people
have no idea they're sharing
stuff," Bennett said. If users re
spond quickly, then their Internet
connection is unaffected, other
wise the connection is shut off.
This quarter, ITSS has re
ceived four or five notices of copy
right infringement on average
each day, up from the average of
one to two per day, but Bennett
said this was to be expected with
new users on the network.
Stanford's policy already ad
dresses the two main concerns put
forward by the media companies
in their letter.
"Colleges and universities
should not be in the business of
condoning or promoting unlaw
ful activities," the media compa
nies wrote, encouraging more
education about the law. Ben
nett emphasized that Stanford
has always discouraged copy
right violation.
"Not only is piracy of copy
righted works illegal, it can take
up a significant percentage of a

university's costly bandwidth,"
wrote the media companies. Stan
lord already addresses this prob
lem by limiting the amount of traf
fic that outside users can direct to
the Stanford network.
"Stanford does not limit band
width of on-campus users to the
Internet, but only restricts traffic
going off-campus," said Phil
Reese, director of Network Sys
tems. "Of the two main Internet
connections, the connection to the
residences has traffic-shaping
technology." The capability limits
traffic from certain protocols,
mostly those associated with the
sharing of MP3s and movies,
going out from the residences.
"Our goal is not to impede, but
to keep the bits moving," Reese
said. "The student load is as large
as the load to the rest of campus,
and students actually have more
bandwidth than the rest of cam
pus." Reese declined to provide
specific numbers about the band
width limits, but noted that Stan
ford has plenty of bandwidth for
legitimate uses.
Sentiment varies widely as to
what a university's proper role in
copyright enforcement should be,
but few students find fault with
Stanford's policies. "I don't think
it's the role or responsibility of a
university to police its users," said
Jason Anderson, resident com
puter coordinator in Schiff
House. "It's up to each person as
a citizen to decide whether they
choose to abide by the rules."
Bennett summed up Stanford's
pragmatic approach, which some
students view as a license to do
whatever they want so long as they
don't share files. "So far, it seems
to be working," he said.
