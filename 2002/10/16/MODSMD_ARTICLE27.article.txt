## Auto industry explores alternate fuel sources 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN 
It's too bad that there weren't more di
nosaurs.
Willi the United Suites consuming more
than 17 million barrels of oil per day, and the
Oil Depletion Analysis Center warning omi
nously that global crude oil supplies may peak
as early as 2010, one can only wish that there
had been more of t hose scaly monsters to die,
fossilize and eventually end up in our gas
tanks.
Of course, that wouldn't be very good for
the planet.
That's why the automotive industry is fo
cusing increasingly on the development of al
ternative fuel sources for transportation.
While the possibilities range anywhere from
electricity (remember the failed EV1?) to
ethanol to biodiesel fuels, recent trends have
seen exploration mainly in three new tech

nologies — solar power, gas-electric hybrid
and fuel cells.
Efforts in past years concentrated on solar
power. The noontime sun offers an incredible
1000 watts of energy per square meter; the
only problem lies in utilizing this energy.
"As far as actually powering a commercial
vehicle, 1 don't think that it's ever going to hap
pen," said senior Eloy Avila, president of the
Stanford Solar Car Project, on the possibility of
solar-powered cars one day crowding the rush
hour highways.
While solar cell efficiency has skyrocketed
recently, increasing from 8 percent to 32 per
cent in the last decade, this type of power may
never be available on standard cars. "There's
just not enough area" to lit the required num
ber of fuel cells, Avila said.
Instead, innovators have shifted away from
solar sources and towards a new power source:
the gas-electric hybrid, already available for

purchase. The technology, pioneered by
1 londa and Toyota, uses a battery to maximize
the power released by a normal internal com
bustion engine.
Besides making use of advanced aerody
namics, low resistance tires and lightweight
materials to increase gas mileage, hybrids em
ploy a tool called "regenerative braking" to
allow the battery to store some of the kinetic
energy lost when the car slows down for later
use. Hybrids are also intelligent enough to
shut themselves off when the car is being inef
ficient, such as when stopped at a red light.
And the results? The Honda Insight hybrid
receives an astounding 70 miles per gallon on
the highway, compared with an ordinary
Honda Civic at 39 mpg and the country's fa
vorite scapegoat, the Chevrolet Suburban, at a
paltry 10 mpg.

General Motors' Autonomy packs fuel cell energy, motors, suspension and an electronic control system into a chassis only six inches thick.
Even with these latest improve
ments, the future lies elsewhere.
Most innovators today are holding
out hope for the promise of fuel
cells, which combine hydrogen
and oxygen to produce electricity.
And fuel cells are remarkably
clean: The only waste emissions
are water and heat. Green Party
members may emit a collective
sigh of relief.
Several car companies — no

tably Ford, DaimlerChrysler and
Honda — have begun to develop
fuel cell-based cars and even plan
to have models on the market by
2004. One of the most innovative
designs has come from General
Motors, whose model, code
named Autonomy, fits all the ne
cessities of propulsion — fuel c ells,
motors, suspension and electronic
control system — into a chassis
only six inches thick.
President Bush has thrown the
power of the government behind
this approach. "We happen to be
lieve that fuel cells are the wave of
the future," he said recently after

announcing a $150 million plan
dubbed FreedomCAß designed
to foster development of fuel cell
technology.
The big cost, however, lies in
converting America's countless
gas stations into hydrogen deposi
tories. The price tag may run up
wards of $ 100 billion.
With such exhorbitant costs
and implementation difficulties,
the 112 uture of fuel cells is far from
certain. It will require joint ef
fort between the government
and industry leaders to make the
hope of an emissions-free future
a reality.
