# 'Human neuron mouse model' under review by bioethics team
## 
### MEGAN CLARK 
Stanford's Center for Biomedical
Ethics is currently reviewing a research
proposal to inject human stem cells into
the brains of mice. The proposed project,
led by Dr. Irving Weissman, professor of
cancer biology, would lead to a live exper
imental model of the cells that make up
the human nervous system. While current
neuroscientists are limited to working with
tissues and cells in a dish, the new project
would allow them to observe and manipu
late cells in a live animal.
Lead scientist pioneered stem
cell research
In 1988, Weissman went down in histo
ry as the first scientist to isolate any kind of
stem cell. These elusive makers of various

cell types in our bodies had been discov
ered in the 19605, but had avoided scien
tists' grasp for over two decades.
After successfully isolating blood-form
ing stem cells in mice, Weissman set out to
find their equivalent in humans. I lowever,
he knew that he could more easily and eth
ically experiment on mice. So within a year,
he and his colleagues created the "scid-hu"
mouse, a mouse with a human immune
system and an ideal model for studyingour
bodies' natural defenses. Experiments on
these mice led to his discovery of human
blood-forming stem cells in 1992.
Now, 10 years and a number of land
mark discoveries later, Dr. Weissman is
putting a new class of stem cells, human
central nervous system stem cells, to the
test. He and his colleagues were also the
first to discover these cells in Dec. 2000.

Such cells give rise to brain cells as well as
other important components of the brain
and spinal cord.
A possibility soon presented itself to
Weissman: I le might be able to make
mouse models of these cells as well. But a
mouse with human brain cells? Knowing
that such an experiment would raise ethi
cal questions, he consulted the ('-enter for
Biomedical Ethics at Stanford.
Ethical concerns
I lie ( '.enter soon organized a working
group of five faculty members to ethically
appraise the project. I his group consists of
Mildred ('ho, co-director of the Biomed
ical Kthies Center; I lank Creely, professor
of law; Linda I logic, senior research schol
ar at the Center; Hill Newsome, professor
of neurobiology; and Debra Sat/, professor

of philosophy. Their thoughts and find
ings concerning the so-called "Human
Neuron Mouse Model" were the subject of
a recent talk given by Greely at the Stan
ford Medical School.
The bioethics team has identified five
possible dilemmas involved in the project,
two of which are well-known issues of stem
cell research and the treatment of animals.
A more unique issue concerns the resulting
structure of the mouse model brains.
Greely posed the question, "Would you
have a human brain if you had a mouse
brain made out of human cells?"
He responded by explaining that "our
best guess is that the difference between
brains isn't what kind of neurons they're
made of, but how they're organized."
Greely added that the animals would most
likely have "a mouse brain with mouse ar

chitecture, hut human bricks."
Weissman said he thinks it is "almost im
possible" that these mice will develop
human-like structures, since their brain ar
chitecture is "pre-ordained by mouse de
velopment." Furthermore, the mouse's
differing skull size and support structures
also make this possibility unlikely, accord
ing to Weissman.
Weissman plans to use an experimental
mouse model in which almost all the brain
cells die a week before birth. 1 le hopes that
human stem cells injected into these mouse
brains will divide and replace the dying
neurons.
Weissman said that in response to the
precaution suggested by the bioethics
team, he will first sacrifice the mice three
days before birth and make sure
that no human-like structures have
developed. Both Greely and Weiss
man agreed, however, that there is
a very low probability that func
tional brains of any kind will devel
op in the mice.
The project also raises questions
about the appropriate use of
human tissue, specifically nervous
system tissue. Greely said the big
difference between this project and
Weissman's scid-hu immune sys
tem mouse model is that "we care
more about brain cells than we do

about immune cells." He explained
that since brain cells are thought to
give rise to consciousness, they are
generally awarded a special status.
Gould there then be some spe
cial difference between human
and mouse neurons, a property
that gives rise to human con
sciousness?
"It seems to me unlikely that
emergent properties of the mind,
consciousness, and learning are
human-specific at the neuronal
level, but we don't know," Weiss
man said.
The bioethics team's final rec
ommendation to Weissman? "Go
ahead, with a great deal of humili
ty, scientifically and ethically,"
Greely said.

Possible Research Benefits
Weissman is particularly interested
in studying the mouse's olfactory
system, which is both highly devel
oped and well understood in the
mouse. Specifically, he plans to
study how the human neurons af
fect the mouse's "hardwired re
sponses" to smell, as well as their
learned responses.
He also believes the model
would be useful for studying how
human neurons respond to drugs.
"We have a long and rich histo
ry of drugs that treat manic de
pressive disorder, schizophrenia,
epilepsy and also mind altering
drugs like cannabinoids and LSD.
But we don't know how they actu

ally work," Weissman said.
This is where the mouse model
comes in. "You can do more to a
mouse than you can do ethically,
legally and practically in humans,"
Greely explained.
Greely said the model might be of
great use for studying Parkinson's
disease, Huntington's disease, and
other neurodegenerative disorders.
"The hope is that you can use
[stem cells] to replace dead or
dying cells," Greely said.
It is the promise of these poten
tial benefits that motivate Weiss
man's research. "The guiding prin
ciple for me," Weissman said, "is
that if you can do research that
could benefit human lives, you
should do that research."

late cells in a live animal.
Lead scientist pioneered stem
cell research
In 1988, Weissman went down in histo
ry as the first scientist to isolate any kind of
stem cell. These elusive makers of various

cell types in our bodies had been discov
ered in the 19605, but had avoided scien
tists' grasp for over two decades.
After successfully isolating blood-form
ing stem cells in mice, Weissman set out to
find their equivalent in humans. I lowever,
he knew that he could more easily and eth
ically experiment on mice. So within a year,
he and his colleagues created the "scid-hu"
mouse, a mouse with a human immune
system and an ideal model for studyingour
bodies' natural defenses. Experiments on
these mice led to his discovery of human
blood-forming stem cells in 1992.
Now, 10 years and a number of land
mark discoveries later, Dr. Weissman is
putting a new class of stem cells, human
central nervous system stem cells, to the
test. He and his colleagues were also the
first to discover these cells in Dec. 2000.

Such cells give rise to brain cells as well as
other important components of the brain
and spinal cord.
A possibility soon presented itself to
Weissman: I le might be able to make
mouse models of these cells as well. But a
mouse with human brain cells? Knowing
that such an experiment would raise ethi
cal questions, he consulted the ('-enter for
Biomedical Ethics at Stanford.
Ethical concerns
I lie ( '.enter soon organized a working
group of five faculty members to ethically
appraise the project. I his group consists of
Mildred ('ho, co-director of the Biomed
ical Kthies Center; I lank Creely, professor
of law; Linda I logic, senior research schol
ar at the Center; Hill Newsome, professor
of neurobiology; and Debra Sat/, professor

of philosophy. Their thoughts and find
ings concerning the so-called "Human
Neuron Mouse Model" were the subject of
a recent talk given by Greely at the Stan
ford Medical School.
The bioethics team has identified five
possible dilemmas involved in the project,
two of which are well-known issues of stem
cell research and the treatment of animals.
A more unique issue concerns the resulting
structure of the mouse model brains.
Greely posed the question, "Would you
have a human brain if you had a mouse
brain made out of human cells?"
He responded by explaining that "our
best guess is that the difference between
brains isn't what kind of neurons they're
made of, but how they're organized."
Greely added that the animals would most
likely have "a mouse brain with mouse ar

chitecture, hut human bricks."
Weissman said he thinks it is "almost im
possible" that these mice will develop
human-like structures, since their brain ar
chitecture is "pre-ordained by mouse de
velopment." Furthermore, the mouse's
differing skull size and support structures
also make this possibility unlikely, accord
ing to Weissman.
Weissman plans to use an experimental
mouse model in which almost all the brain
cells die a week before birth. 1 le hopes that
human stem cells injected into these mouse
brains will divide and replace the dying
neurons.
Weissman said that in response to the
precaution suggested by the bioethics
team, he will first sacrifice the mice three
days before birth and make sure
that no human-like structures have
developed. Both Greely and Weiss
man agreed, however, that there is
a very low probability that func
tional brains of any kind will devel
op in the mice.
The project also raises questions
about the appropriate use of
human tissue, specifically nervous
system tissue. Greely said the big
difference between this project and
Weissman's scid-hu immune sys
tem mouse model is that "we care
more about brain cells than we do

about immune cells." He explained
that since brain cells are thought to
give rise to consciousness, they are
generally awarded a special status.
Gould there then be some spe
cial difference between human
and mouse neurons, a property
that gives rise to human con
sciousness?
"It seems to me unlikely that
emergent properties of the mind,
consciousness, and learning are
human-specific at the neuronal
level, but we don't know," Weiss
man said.
The bioethics team's final rec
ommendation to Weissman? "Go
ahead, with a great deal of humili
ty, scientifically and ethically,"
Greely said.

Possible Research Benefits
Weissman is particularly interested
in studying the mouse's olfactory
system, which is both highly devel
oped and well understood in the
mouse. Specifically, he plans to
study how the human neurons af
fect the mouse's "hardwired re
sponses" to smell, as well as their
learned responses.
He also believes the model
would be useful for studying how
human neurons respond to drugs.
"We have a long and rich histo
ry of drugs that treat manic de
pressive disorder, schizophrenia,
epilepsy and also mind altering
drugs like cannabinoids and LSD.
But we don't know how they actu

ally work," Weissman said.
This is where the mouse model
comes in. "You can do more to a
mouse than you can do ethically,
legally and practically in humans,"
Greely explained.
Greely said the model might be of
great use for studying Parkinson's
disease, Huntington's disease, and
other neurodegenerative disorders.
"The hope is that you can use
[stem cells] to replace dead or
dying cells," Greely said.
It is the promise of these poten
tial benefits that motivate Weiss
man's research. "The guiding prin
ciple for me," Weissman said, "is
that if you can do research that
could benefit human lives, you
should do that research."
Stanford's Center for Biomedical
Ethics is currently reviewing a research
proposal to inject human stem cells into
the brains of mice. The proposed project,
led by Dr. Irving Weissman, professor of
cancer biology, would lead to a live exper
imental model of the cells that make up
the human nervous system. While current
neuroscientists are limited to working with
tissues and cells in a dish, the new project
would allow them to observe and manipu
late cells in a live animal.
