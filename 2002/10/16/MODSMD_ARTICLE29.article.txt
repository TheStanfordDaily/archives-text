# Nervous system interface puts mind over matter
## 
### AMIT GARG STAFF WRITER 
Imagine controlling a car
with only your mind. You may be
thinking: ESP or Star Trek? Nei
ther. Scientists are working to
produce an interface to direct the
human nervous system to an ex
ternal network that would allow
people to control a machine with
merely a thought. This would be
greatly useful to people who have
lost control of limbs or have pros
thetic ones. Scientists at Duke
University have successfully al
lowed a monkey to respond to
lights on a panel using a mind
controlled joystick. The group re
lied on computers capable of in

terpreting (he human electroen
cephalogram — the brain's elec
trical signature. The technique is
still in its infancy and may take
years before becoming practical.
Some day, diabetics may not
feel the constant pain of daily in
jections to monitor blood glu
cose. Several groups are develop
ing non-invasive methods to per
form exactly this critical function.
At the American Chemical Soci
ety's national meeting this fall,
some of these included an im
plantable infrared watch, a fluo
rescent smart tattoo, and color
changing contact lenses. Most of
the ideas are based on optics,
using a laser to measure the
amount of glucose in the blood
stream. Unfortunately, many of
these devices are years away from
human testing so they will not be
in the markets for some time.
Lately, major companies have
been embracing computer mod
eling to solve a diverse range of

problems. British company Qine
tiQ uses computer models of bone
at the nano-molecular scale to un
derstand how it reacts to various
stressors. The United Kingdom
Defense Department utilizes
QinetiQ's services to prevent fight
er pilot head injuries. In addition,
General Motors uses computer
models to study collision safety,
which is considerably cheaper on
the computer than smashing
dummies in actual cars. Finally,
Monsanto uses atomic models to
follow the path of a drug in order
to maximize its efficiency.
Scientists at Rothamsted Re
search in England recently
published a study on Drosophi
la's resistance to the insecticide
DDT. By studying the genome
of the fly, the researchers deter
mined tliat there is a single gene
responsible for its DDT-resis
tant ability. The scientists hy
pothesize the allele resulted
from a random but advanta
geous mutation after the advent

of DDT in 1939. It turns out that
the allele codes fora protein that
confers resistance to not just
DD T but a broad range of insec
ticides. The findings have im
portant implications for pest
control and disease manage
ment, but the group acknowl
edged that further studies are
needed to neutralize the resis
tance.
There is a new type of ra
dioactivity in the air. Two inde
pendent teams of nuclear physi
cists observed the presence of
short-lived isotope iron-45 in the
air. The groups, one in France
and the other in Germany, ob
served simultaneous emission of
two protons. Until now, elements
with an odd mass number were
thought to emit a radiation of at
most one proton. The experi
ments were unable to measure
the angle at which the emission
occurs and other experiments
will be needed to explain the phe
nomena better.
