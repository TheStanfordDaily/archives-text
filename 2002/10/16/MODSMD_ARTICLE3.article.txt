# Then and now: the road to war

### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Editors Note: This article is the third in
a weekly series investigating the rela
tionship between the Stanford commu
nity and the potential war in Iraq. This
installment has appeared in two parts.
Yesterday's article compared the current
campus climate to Stanford's reaction to
the onset of the Persian Gulf War in
1990. Today's article addresses changes
in the campus' response as war neared
in 1990 and discusses the directions stu
dent response could take in 2002 if war
becomes imminent.

Over the past month, Stanford
has reacted to the prospect of a war
with Iraq much in the same way it
did before the Persian Gulf War 12
years ago — while rallies, teach-ins
and dialogue increased, the issue
remained largely peripheral to the
general student body.
hi 1990, however, as a U.S. at
tack became imminent, war in Iraq
was transformed into an issue of
campus-wide concern. By the time
the American military began a for
mal offensive, student protests
were drawing crowds of more than
1,000 people.
Despite the striking similarities
between the early responses of
campus to a war in 1990 and in
2002, students today are in dis

agreement over whether an Amer
ican attack on Iraq will absorb the
community so thoroughly.
1990: A campus transformed
In the early fall of 1990, student
activists and small clusters of con
cerned students were the driving
forces behind visible campus reac
tion to war. But starting in late No
vember and extending through
January of 1991, the mainstream
of the student body began to en
gage in the dialogue surrounding
the war, with many students taking
strong stands.
Activists escalated their protests
against U.S. military involvement.
On Nov. 21, 1990, 10 members of
an organization formed at an anti
war rally earlier that year began a
six-day hunger fast to protest U.S.
policy in the Persian Gulf. On Dec.
5, Stanford students formed a
coalition with l(i other California
schools and 70 colleges and univer
sities nationwide to protest Ameri
can intervention.
While driven by activists, these
movements began to garner cam
pus-wide support. Over 200 stu
dents pledged to participate in a
one-day hunger strike, and, ac
cording to Stanford representa
tives in the coalition of schools
protesting American involvement

in Iraq, the anti-war stance repre
sented a majority of Stanford.
Comparing the 1990 anti-war
movement at Stanford with
protests against the Vietnam War
in the 19605, then-Stanford-stu
dent Kate Morris told The Daily,
"There is a lot more depth in this
movement."
That depth was evidenced
through the actions taken by orga
nizations representing the whole of
the student body and individuals
typically removed from such dis
cussions.
On Nov. 15, 1990, the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate passed a bill
opposing "an unprovoked non-
U.N.-sponsored military oflensive
in the Middle East" — although (he
resolution angered students who
felt making statements on such is
sues was not the job of the ASSU.
Senators who passed the bill
siiid that they felt they were acting
in accordance with general student
sentiment.
"I'm not in favor of war in the
Middle East," said then-ASSU Sen
ator Noel Maurer. "1 don't think
you can find a single Stanford stu
dent who is."
In the two weeks of January that
preceded the U.S. assault on Iraq,
this gradually expanding student

engagement skyrocketed.
Alter then-President George
Bush sent a letter to campus news
papers all across t he cou 111 ry ca 11 ing
for student support of the war,
protests both in Palo Alto and Stan
ford garnered the support of hun
dreds of students.
On Jan. 15, 1991 — the day be
fore the start of the Persian Gulf
War — about 1,000 members of
the Stanford community gathered
in White Plaza for an anti-war rally.
One day later, The Daily reported
that almost the entire campus sat
huddled around televisions to un
derstand what action the United
States had taken and what lay
ahead. That night, Stanford stu
dents were found protesting both
in Palo Alto and San Francisco.
Even just before the start of die
war, though, there were students
who acknowledged that the con
cerns of University life were more
pressing.
"I don't worry about it now,"
then-sophomore Malika Dalai told
The Daily on Jan. 14. "I have more
pressing things to worry about, like
school and stull— but if I gave my
self a moment, 1 probably would
worry about it."
But once war broke out, related
concerns were hard to escape. In

the Main Quad, 700 students gath
ered to hear University President
Donald Kennedy speak, and the
repercussions of war overtook both
the classroom and student con
sciousness.
"I'll think I'll be going through
the motions of school, but my heart
is not in the work," said then-fresh
man Lisa Goldman. "Every book
and paper seems trivial."
2002: An unclear future
As in 1990, some Stanford stu
dents who describe themselves as
not particularly politically engaged
have started to change their habits
because they see war with Iraq as
an issue of special gravity.
"I usually don't read the paper,"
said sophomore Valerie Byrnes,
who went to last Sunday's teach-in
on Iraq, a type of event she says she
normally does not attend. "Lately,
I've been trying to go online and
get as much information as I can."
Students say that they have
been surprised at conversations
they have recently engaged in with
their peers, which they cite as in
dicative that Iraq has made in
roads into the campus' collective
consciousness.
"I've actually been very im
pressed with how much interest the
students here are taking," said
sophomore Joseph Fairbanks,
president ol the Stanford College
Republicans. "I see students who I
know wouldn't normally get in

volved with any political issues are
taking the time to educate them
selves because they know what is at
stake."
I le added, "You may not have
activism per se where you see them
marching down the street with a
sign, but this is one issue they're not
apathetic about."
But students said that many re
main indifferent to escalating ten
sions between the United States
and Iraq, questioning whether the
campus will actually mobilize —
whether in favor of or against
war — as it did in 1990.
"I think most people that I know
that are usually apathetic are still
apathetic," Byrnes said.
Junior Faisal Rashid, who ran a
Sophomore Fellows c lass last year
on U.S. policy toward Iraq through
the Freshman/Sophomore College,
said he felt Iraq had assumed the
role of a "water-cooler topic"
among students — it has become a
part of pop-culture, but is not some
thing they are deeply concerned
with.
"It just comes up in general con
versation now," Rashid said. "Per
sonally, I think [an increase in dis
cussion about Iraq is | just because
it's in the news — I don't think [stu
dents] have this greater calling to
analyze the merits of U.S. interven
tion. Some are, not everyone."
I le added, "I think the majority
of people are oblivious to it —
oblivious in that it occupies live

minutes of their thinking per day."
Rash id and other students at
tributed the lack of overall student
engagement in discussions on war
in Iraq to the reality that, with no
draft and increasingly distant con
llicts, the threat of U.S. engage
ment doesn't hit close enough to
home.
"1 truly think that most people
don't even think about [war with
Iraq]," said sophomore lan Cox.
"The general perception that our
generation has is that we're always
at war wit h someone, and half the
time it's a place where we can't even
pronounce the city's name."
Explaining why he felt students
were not engaging in more discus
sion or protest for or against war,
Rashid said, "I guess they don't feel
threatened enough. To a certain
degree, they feel it's a large hill to
climb to effect any change, and
they're not willing to climb that hill
because their interests aren't affect
ed enough."
Similar to before the Persian
Gulf War, activist groups such as
the Stanford Community for Peace
and Justice continue to plan events
and are hoping to bring a contin
gent of students to a protest in San
Francisco on Oct. 26.
Fairbanks said that the College
Republicans — which he believes
to be the only on-campus organiza
tion openly in support of war —
plans to begin flyering campus to
inform students of the group's

views and will hold rallies in sup
port of President George VV. Bush's
position.
In contrast to 1990, the ASSU
will remain on the periphery of de
bate, and is instead engaged in
helping organizations plan infor
mational events. After its 1991 state
ment against war, a constitutional
amendment was enacted prohibit
ing the ASSU from passing bills on
issues not directly affecting student
life.
With Vietnam out of the collec
tive memory and students doubtful
that they will be drafted in an era of
high-tech warfare, many students
have expressed doubt that the road
leading up to a potential war will
mirror that of the early '90s.
They do agree, however, that if
the United States does go to war,
students will respond.
"I wouldn't be surprised if that
happened again," Rashid said, re
ferring to student protests in 1991
after the U.S. bombed Iraq. "No
one really wants to go to war, and
because we're a more liberal uni
versity, people are going to get in
volved."
SCPJ co-coordinator Calvin
Miaw said he has noticed increased
attention to Iraq, and he said that
an actual U.S. strike may propel
students to action.
"People who don't consider
themselves political have said, 'If
we go to war, I'm going to be in the
streets.'"

nity and the potential war in Iraq. This
installment has appeared in two parts.
Yesterday's article compared the current
campus climate to Stanford's reaction to
the onset of the Persian Gulf War in
1990. Today's article addresses changes
in the campus' response as war neared
in 1990 and discusses the directions stu
dent response could take in 2002 if war
becomes imminent.

Over the past month, Stanford
has reacted to the prospect of a war
with Iraq much in the same way it
did before the Persian Gulf War 12
years ago — while rallies, teach-ins
and dialogue increased, the issue
remained largely peripheral to the
general student body.
hi 1990, however, as a U.S. at
tack became imminent, war in Iraq
was transformed into an issue of
campus-wide concern. By the time
the American military began a for
mal offensive, student protests
were drawing crowds of more than
1,000 people.
Despite the striking similarities
between the early responses of
campus to a war in 1990 and in
2002, students today are in dis

agreement over whether an Amer
ican attack on Iraq will absorb the
community so thoroughly.
1990: A campus transformed
In the early fall of 1990, student
activists and small clusters of con
cerned students were the driving
forces behind visible campus reac
tion to war. But starting in late No
vember and extending through
January of 1991, the mainstream
of the student body began to en
gage in the dialogue surrounding
the war, with many students taking
strong stands.
Activists escalated their protests
against U.S. military involvement.
On Nov. 21, 1990, 10 members of
an organization formed at an anti
war rally earlier that year began a
six-day hunger fast to protest U.S.
policy in the Persian Gulf. On Dec.
5, Stanford students formed a
coalition with l(i other California
schools and 70 colleges and univer
sities nationwide to protest Ameri
can intervention.
While driven by activists, these
movements began to garner cam
pus-wide support. Over 200 stu
dents pledged to participate in a
one-day hunger strike, and, ac
cording to Stanford representa
tives in the coalition of schools
protesting American involvement

in Iraq, the anti-war stance repre
sented a majority of Stanford.
Comparing the 1990 anti-war
movement at Stanford with
protests against the Vietnam War
in the 19605, then-Stanford-stu
dent Kate Morris told The Daily,
"There is a lot more depth in this
movement."
That depth was evidenced
through the actions taken by orga
nizations representing the whole of
the student body and individuals
typically removed from such dis
cussions.
On Nov. 15, 1990, the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate passed a bill
opposing "an unprovoked non-
U.N.-sponsored military oflensive
in the Middle East" — although (he
resolution angered students who
felt making statements on such is
sues was not the job of the ASSU.
Senators who passed the bill
siiid that they felt they were acting
in accordance with general student
sentiment.
"I'm not in favor of war in the
Middle East," said then-ASSU Sen
ator Noel Maurer. "1 don't think
you can find a single Stanford stu
dent who is."
In the two weeks of January that
preceded the U.S. assault on Iraq,
this gradually expanding student


GINA HSIEH/The Stanford Daily
engagement skyrocketed.
Alter then-President George
Bush sent a letter to campus news
papers all across t he cou 111 ry ca 11 ing
for student support of the war,
protests both in Palo Alto and Stan
ford garnered the support of hun
dreds of students.
On Jan. 15, 1991 — the day be
fore the start of the Persian Gulf
War — about 1,000 members of
the Stanford community gathered
in White Plaza for an anti-war rally.
One day later, The Daily reported
that almost the entire campus sat
huddled around televisions to un
derstand what action the United
States had taken and what lay
ahead. That night, Stanford stu
dents were found protesting both
in Palo Alto and San Francisco.
Even just before the start of die
war, though, there were students
who acknowledged that the con
cerns of University life were more
pressing.
"I don't worry about it now,"
then-sophomore Malika Dalai told
The Daily on Jan. 14. "I have more
pressing things to worry about, like
school and stull— but if I gave my
self a moment, 1 probably would
worry about it."
But once war broke out, related
concerns were hard to escape. In

the Main Quad, 700 students gath
ered to hear University President
Donald Kennedy speak, and the
repercussions of war overtook both
the classroom and student con
sciousness.
"I'll think I'll be going through
the motions of school, but my heart
is not in the work," said then-fresh
man Lisa Goldman. "Every book
and paper seems trivial."
2002: An unclear future
As in 1990, some Stanford stu
dents who describe themselves as
not particularly politically engaged
have started to change their habits
because they see war with Iraq as
an issue of special gravity.
"I usually don't read the paper,"
said sophomore Valerie Byrnes,
who went to last Sunday's teach-in
on Iraq, a type of event she says she
normally does not attend. "Lately,
I've been trying to go online and
get as much information as I can."
Students say that they have
been surprised at conversations
they have recently engaged in with
their peers, which they cite as in
dicative that Iraq has made in
roads into the campus' collective
consciousness.
"I've actually been very im
pressed with how much interest the
students here are taking," said
sophomore Joseph Fairbanks,
president ol the Stanford College
Republicans. "I see students who I
know wouldn't normally get in

volved with any political issues are
taking the time to educate them
selves because they know what is at
stake."
I le added, "You may not have
activism per se where you see them
marching down the street with a
sign, but this is one issue they're not
apathetic about."
But students said that many re
main indifferent to escalating ten
sions between the United States
and Iraq, questioning whether the
campus will actually mobilize —
whether in favor of or against
war — as it did in 1990.
"I think most people that I know
that are usually apathetic are still
apathetic," Byrnes said.
Junior Faisal Rashid, who ran a
Sophomore Fellows c lass last year
on U.S. policy toward Iraq through
the Freshman/Sophomore College,
said he felt Iraq had assumed the
role of a "water-cooler topic"
among students — it has become a
part of pop-culture, but is not some
thing they are deeply concerned
with.
"It just comes up in general con
versation now," Rashid said. "Per
sonally, I think [an increase in dis
cussion about Iraq is | just because
it's in the news — I don't think [stu
dents] have this greater calling to
analyze the merits of U.S. interven
tion. Some are, not everyone."
I le added, "I think the majority
of people are oblivious to it —
oblivious in that it occupies live

minutes of their thinking per day."
Rash id and other students at
tributed the lack of overall student
engagement in discussions on war
in Iraq to the reality that, with no
draft and increasingly distant con
llicts, the threat of U.S. engage
ment doesn't hit close enough to
home.
"1 truly think that most people
don't even think about [war with
Iraq]," said sophomore lan Cox.
"The general perception that our
generation has is that we're always
at war wit h someone, and half the
time it's a place where we can't even
pronounce the city's name."
Explaining why he felt students
were not engaging in more discus
sion or protest for or against war,
Rashid said, "I guess they don't feel
threatened enough. To a certain
degree, they feel it's a large hill to
climb to effect any change, and
they're not willing to climb that hill
because their interests aren't affect
ed enough."
Similar to before the Persian
Gulf War, activist groups such as
the Stanford Community for Peace
and Justice continue to plan events
and are hoping to bring a contin
gent of students to a protest in San
Francisco on Oct. 26.
Fairbanks said that the College
Republicans — which he believes
to be the only on-campus organiza
tion openly in support of war —
plans to begin flyering campus to
inform students of the group's

views and will hold rallies in sup
port of President George VV. Bush's
position.
In contrast to 1990, the ASSU
will remain on the periphery of de
bate, and is instead engaged in
helping organizations plan infor
mational events. After its 1991 state
ment against war, a constitutional
amendment was enacted prohibit
ing the ASSU from passing bills on
issues not directly affecting student
life.
With Vietnam out of the collec
tive memory and students doubtful
that they will be drafted in an era of
high-tech warfare, many students
have expressed doubt that the road
leading up to a potential war will
mirror that of the early '90s.
They do agree, however, that if
the United States does go to war,
students will respond.
"I wouldn't be surprised if that
happened again," Rashid said, re
ferring to student protests in 1991
after the U.S. bombed Iraq. "No
one really wants to go to war, and
because we're a more liberal uni
versity, people are going to get in
volved."
SCPJ co-coordinator Calvin
Miaw said he has noticed increased
attention to Iraq, and he said that
an actual U.S. strike may propel
students to action.

Yesterday's article compared the current
campus climate to Stanford's reaction to
the onset of the Persian Gulf War in
1990. Today's article addresses changes
in the campus' response as war neared
in 1990 and discusses the directions stu
dent response could take in 2002 if war
becomes imminent.

Over the past month, Stanford
has reacted to the prospect of a war
with Iraq much in the same way it
did before the Persian Gulf War 12
years ago — while rallies, teach-ins
and dialogue increased, the issue
remained largely peripheral to the
general student body.
hi 1990, however, as a U.S. at
tack became imminent, war in Iraq
was transformed into an issue of
campus-wide concern. By the time
the American military began a for
mal offensive, student protests
were drawing crowds of more than
1,000 people.
Despite the striking similarities
between the early responses of
campus to a war in 1990 and in
2002, students today are in dis

agreement over whether an Amer
ican attack on Iraq will absorb the
community so thoroughly.
1990: A campus transformed
In the early fall of 1990, student
activists and small clusters of con
cerned students were the driving
forces behind visible campus reac
tion to war. But starting in late No
vember and extending through
January of 1991, the mainstream
of the student body began to en
gage in the dialogue surrounding
the war, with many students taking
strong stands.
Activists escalated their protests
against U.S. military involvement.
On Nov. 21, 1990, 10 members of
an organization formed at an anti
war rally earlier that year began a
six-day hunger fast to protest U.S.
policy in the Persian Gulf. On Dec.
5, Stanford students formed a
coalition with l(i other California
schools and 70 colleges and univer
sities nationwide to protest Ameri
can intervention.
While driven by activists, these
movements began to garner cam
pus-wide support. Over 200 stu
dents pledged to participate in a
one-day hunger strike, and, ac
cording to Stanford representa
tives in the coalition of schools
protesting American involvement

in Iraq, the anti-war stance repre
sented a majority of Stanford.
Comparing the 1990 anti-war
movement at Stanford with
protests against the Vietnam War
in the 19605, then-Stanford-stu
dent Kate Morris told The Daily,
"There is a lot more depth in this
movement."
That depth was evidenced
through the actions taken by orga
nizations representing the whole of
the student body and individuals
typically removed from such dis
cussions.
On Nov. 15, 1990, the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate passed a bill
opposing "an unprovoked non-
U.N.-sponsored military oflensive
in the Middle East" — although (he
resolution angered students who
felt making statements on such is
sues was not the job of the ASSU.
Senators who passed the bill
siiid that they felt they were acting
in accordance with general student
sentiment.
"I'm not in favor of war in the
Middle East," said then-ASSU Sen
ator Noel Maurer. "1 don't think
you can find a single Stanford stu
dent who is."
In the two weeks of January that
preceded the U.S. assault on Iraq,
this gradually expanding student


GINA HSIEH/The Stanford Daily
engagement skyrocketed.
Alter then-President George
Bush sent a letter to campus news
papers all across t he cou 111 ry ca 11 ing
for student support of the war,
protests both in Palo Alto and Stan
ford garnered the support of hun
dreds of students.
On Jan. 15, 1991 — the day be
fore the start of the Persian Gulf
War — about 1,000 members of
the Stanford community gathered
in White Plaza for an anti-war rally.
One day later, The Daily reported
that almost the entire campus sat
huddled around televisions to un
derstand what action the United
States had taken and what lay
ahead. That night, Stanford stu
dents were found protesting both
in Palo Alto and San Francisco.
Even just before the start of die
war, though, there were students
who acknowledged that the con
cerns of University life were more
pressing.
"I don't worry about it now,"
then-sophomore Malika Dalai told
The Daily on Jan. 14. "I have more
pressing things to worry about, like
school and stull— but if I gave my
self a moment, 1 probably would
worry about it."
But once war broke out, related
concerns were hard to escape. In

the Main Quad, 700 students gath
ered to hear University President
Donald Kennedy speak, and the
repercussions of war overtook both
the classroom and student con
sciousness.
"I'll think I'll be going through
the motions of school, but my heart
is not in the work," said then-fresh
man Lisa Goldman. "Every book
and paper seems trivial."
2002: An unclear future
As in 1990, some Stanford stu
dents who describe themselves as
not particularly politically engaged
have started to change their habits
because they see war with Iraq as
an issue of special gravity.
"I usually don't read the paper,"
said sophomore Valerie Byrnes,
who went to last Sunday's teach-in
on Iraq, a type of event she says she
normally does not attend. "Lately,
I've been trying to go online and
get as much information as I can."
Students say that they have
been surprised at conversations
they have recently engaged in with
their peers, which they cite as in
dicative that Iraq has made in
roads into the campus' collective
consciousness.
"I've actually been very im
pressed with how much interest the
students here are taking," said
sophomore Joseph Fairbanks,
president ol the Stanford College
Republicans. "I see students who I
know wouldn't normally get in

volved with any political issues are
taking the time to educate them
selves because they know what is at
stake."
I le added, "You may not have
activism per se where you see them
marching down the street with a
sign, but this is one issue they're not
apathetic about."
But students said that many re
main indifferent to escalating ten
sions between the United States
and Iraq, questioning whether the
campus will actually mobilize —
whether in favor of or against
war — as it did in 1990.
"I think most people that I know
that are usually apathetic are still
apathetic," Byrnes said.
Junior Faisal Rashid, who ran a
Sophomore Fellows c lass last year
on U.S. policy toward Iraq through
the Freshman/Sophomore College,
said he felt Iraq had assumed the
role of a "water-cooler topic"
among students — it has become a
part of pop-culture, but is not some
thing they are deeply concerned
with.
"It just comes up in general con
versation now," Rashid said. "Per
sonally, I think [an increase in dis
cussion about Iraq is | just because
it's in the news — I don't think [stu
dents] have this greater calling to
analyze the merits of U.S. interven
tion. Some are, not everyone."
I le added, "I think the majority
of people are oblivious to it —
oblivious in that it occupies live

minutes of their thinking per day."
Rash id and other students at
tributed the lack of overall student
engagement in discussions on war
in Iraq to the reality that, with no
draft and increasingly distant con
llicts, the threat of U.S. engage
ment doesn't hit close enough to
home.
"1 truly think that most people
don't even think about [war with
Iraq]," said sophomore lan Cox.
"The general perception that our
generation has is that we're always
at war wit h someone, and half the
time it's a place where we can't even
pronounce the city's name."
Explaining why he felt students
were not engaging in more discus
sion or protest for or against war,
Rashid said, "I guess they don't feel
threatened enough. To a certain
degree, they feel it's a large hill to
climb to effect any change, and
they're not willing to climb that hill
because their interests aren't affect
ed enough."
Similar to before the Persian
Gulf War, activist groups such as
the Stanford Community for Peace
and Justice continue to plan events
and are hoping to bring a contin
gent of students to a protest in San
Francisco on Oct. 26.
Fairbanks said that the College
Republicans — which he believes
to be the only on-campus organiza
tion openly in support of war —
plans to begin flyering campus to
inform students of the group's

views and will hold rallies in sup
port of President George VV. Bush's
position.
In contrast to 1990, the ASSU
will remain on the periphery of de
bate, and is instead engaged in
helping organizations plan infor
mational events. After its 1991 state
ment against war, a constitutional
amendment was enacted prohibit
ing the ASSU from passing bills on
issues not directly affecting student
life.
With Vietnam out of the collec
tive memory and students doubtful
that they will be drafted in an era of
high-tech warfare, many students
have expressed doubt that the road
leading up to a potential war will
mirror that of the early '90s.
They do agree, however, that if
the United States does go to war,
students will respond.
"I wouldn't be surprised if that
happened again," Rashid said, re
ferring to student protests in 1991
after the U.S. bombed Iraq. "No
one really wants to go to war, and
because we're a more liberal uni
