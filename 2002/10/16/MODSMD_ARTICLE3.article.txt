# Then and now: the road to war

### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Editors Note: This article is the third in
a weekly series investigating the rela
tionship between the Stanford commu
nity and the potential war in Iraq. This
installment has appeared in two parts.
Yesterday's article compared the current
campus climate to Stanford's reaction to
the onset of the Persian Gulf War in
1990. Today's article addresses changes
in the campus' response as war neared
in 1990 and discusses the directions stu
dent response could take in 2002 if war
becomes imminent.

Over the past month, Stanford
has reacted to the prospect of a war
with Iraq much in the same way it
did before the Persian Gulf War 12
years ago — while rallies, teach-ins
and dialogue increased, the issue
remained largely peripheral to the
general student body.
hi 1990, however, as a U.S. at
tack became imminent, war in Iraq
was transformed into an issue of
campus-wide concern. By the time
the American military began a for
mal offensive, student protests
were drawing crowds of more than
1,000 people.
Despite the striking similarities
between the early responses of
campus to a war in 1990 and in
2002, students today are in dis

agreement over whether an Amer
ican attack on Iraq will absorb the
community so thoroughly.
1990: A campus transformed
In the early fall of 1990, student
activists and small clusters of con
cerned students were the driving
forces behind visible campus reac
tion to war. But starting in late No
vember and extending through
January of 1991, the mainstream
of the student body began to en
gage in the dialogue surrounding
the war, with many students taking
strong stands.
Activists escalated their protests
against U.S. military involvement.
On Nov. 21, 1990, 10 members of
an organization formed at an anti
war rally earlier that year began a
six-day hunger fast to protest U.S.
policy in the Persian Gulf. On Dec.
5, Stanford students formed a
coalition with l(i other California
schools and 70 colleges and univer
sities nationwide to protest Ameri
can intervention.
While driven by activists, these
movements began to garner cam
pus-wide support. Over 200 stu
dents pledged to participate in a
one-day hunger strike, and, ac
cording to Stanford representa
tives in the coalition of schools
protesting American involvement

in Iraq, the anti-war stance repre
sented a majority of Stanford.
Comparing the 1990 anti-war
movement at Stanford with
protests against the Vietnam War
in the 19605, then-Stanford-stu
dent Kate Morris told The Daily,
"There is a lot more depth in this
movement."
That depth was evidenced
through the actions taken by orga
nizations representing the whole of
the student body and individuals
typically removed from such dis
cussions.
On Nov. 15, 1990, the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate passed a bill
opposing "an unprovoked non-
U.N.-sponsored military oflensive
in the Middle East" — although (he
resolution angered students who
felt making statements on such is
sues was not the job of the ASSU.
Senators who passed the bill
siiid that they felt they were acting
in accordance with general student
sentiment.
"I'm not in favor of war in the
Middle East," said then-ASSU Sen
ator Noel Maurer. "1 don't think
you can find a single Stanford stu
dent who is."
In the two weeks of January that
preceded the U.S. assault on Iraq,
this gradually expanding student
