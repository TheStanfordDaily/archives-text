### MICHELLE KELLER EDITORIAL STAFF 
Last night in Kresge auditori
um, Dr. Steven Pinker discussed
his controversial genetically
based theory of human nature
in a lecture given to students,
faculty and members of the
Stanford community. Pinker, a
world-renowned scholar of lin
guistics and cognitive and evolu
tionary psychology, outlined his
theory in a new book, "The
Blank Slate."
Pinker was invited to speak
by a Program in Writing and
Rhetoric class called " The
Rhetoric of Experiment." The
lecture was organized by stu
dents in the class working with
several organizations, including
the Stanford Undergraduate
Psychology Association.
In his lecture, Pinker intro
duced the three dominant doc
trines concerning human na
ture before turning to a discus
sion of his own view.
Pinker explained that the
"blank slate" school of thought,
formulated by philosopher
John Locke, holds that humans
come into a world with a tabula
rasa — that is, without any trace
of humanity or culture.
"It carries an enormous
moral appeal," he said. "Dog
mas could no longer be treated

as self-evident truths . . . Insti
tutions like slavery could be un
dermined because people could
not argue that slaves are inher
ently inferior."
Pinker argued that the influ
ence of the idea of the "blank
slate" is widely prevalent in soci
ety. Even modern intellectuals
and professionals refer to this
idea.
"()ne person even said '. .. a
child's mind [is like] a blank
book.' That person was Walt
Disney," Pinker said.
Pinker also addressed the
two main competitors to Locke's
theory.
The "noble savage" concept
of humanity — a belief that all
humans are born "good" but are
corrupted by society — was an
ideology developed by Jean-
Jacques Rousseau.
"( fhe noble savage dogma]
has emotional appeal.. . imply
ing that we can work lor a Utopi
an society ... It holds influence
in our everyday lives — we re
sped everything organic and
natural — natural medicine,
natural births, even natural yo
gurt," Pinker said.
Lastly, Pinker introduced
Rene Descartes' "Ghost in the
Machine" ideology, which states
that human souls are complete-
