# Linguist gives talk on human nature

### MICHELLE KELLER EDITORIAL STAFF 
Last night in Kresge auditori
um, Dr. Steven Pinker discussed
his controversial genetically
based theory of human nature
in a lecture given to students,
faculty and members of the
Stanford community. Pinker, a
world-renowned scholar of lin
guistics and cognitive and evolu
tionary psychology, outlined his
theory in a new book, "The
Blank Slate."
Pinker was invited to speak
by a Program in Writing and
Rhetoric class called " The
Rhetoric of Experiment." The
lecture was organized by stu
dents in the class working with
several organizations, including
the Stanford Undergraduate
Psychology Association.
In his lecture, Pinker intro
duced the three dominant doc
trines concerning human na
ture before turning to a discus
sion of his own view.
Pinker explained that the
"blank slate" school of thought,
formulated by philosopher
John Locke, holds that humans
come into a world with a tabula
rasa — that is, without any trace
of humanity or culture.
"It carries an enormous
moral appeal," he said. "Dog
mas could no longer be treated

as self-evident truths . . . Insti
tutions like slavery could be un
dermined because people could
not argue that slaves are inher
ently inferior."
Pinker argued that the influ
ence of the idea of the "blank
slate" is widely prevalent in soci
ety. Even modern intellectuals
and professionals refer to this
idea.
"()ne person even said '. .. a
child's mind [is like] a blank
book.' That person was Walt
Disney," Pinker said.
Pinker also addressed the
two main competitors to Locke's
theory.
The "noble savage" concept
of humanity — a belief that all
humans are born "good" but are
corrupted by society — was an
ideology developed by Jean-
Jacques Rousseau.
"( fhe noble savage dogma]
has emotional appeal.. . imply
ing that we can work lor a Utopi
an society ... It holds influence
in our everyday lives — we re
sped everything organic and
natural — natural medicine,
natural births, even natural yo
gurt," Pinker said.
Lastly, Pinker introduced
Rene Descartes' "Ghost in the
Machine" ideology, which states
that human souls are complete-
ly separate from the human biological sys
tem.
"It separates humans from machines, im
plying that humans have higher purpos
es— love, worship and the pursuits of joy
and beauty," Pinker said.
The impacts of the "Ghost in the Ma
chine" dogma, Pinker argued, have led to
the beliefs that "freedom, dignity, responsi
bility . . . are incompatible with a biological
view of the mind."
Pinker then contrasted these theories
with his own.
People associate a biologically-based view
of human nature with "bad words like 're
ductionist' and 'determinist'," Pinker said.
"No one really knows what they mean, but
people agree they are bad."
After introducing the dominant dogmas
and their major influences in history and
modern thought, Pinker moved on to ad
dress the fears associated with denying their
validity and instead adopting a biologically
based view of human nature.
" There are four major fears or objections
to falsifying these dogmas: a fear of inequal
ity, a fear of imperfectability, a fear ol deter
minism and a fear of nihilism," he contin
ued.
A fear of imperfectability, for example,
leads to totalitarian regimes or the "distor
tion of human relationships, especially par
enting," he said.
"Children are not shaped by their par
ents, but in part by genes, culture and
chance," he continued. "Child-rearing is
above all an ethical responsibility. There is
more to human relationships than shaping
someone's personality."
Pinker concluded his lecture by empha
sizing the danger of denying human nature
by subscribing to the "blank slate" theory.
"It can even lead to the devaluing of
human life on Earth," he said.

After the lecture, several students re
marked that Tinker's views — particularly
on the enormous influence of genetics on
human nature — were too extreme.
"I agree with his theory on most parts,"
said senior Janice Chyou, who is majoring in
human biology. "But when he started talk
ing about his parental theories and how the
only role parents play in raising their chil
dren is a role of 'ethical responsibility,' 1
began to question his theory.
"1 was particularly surprised by his em
phasis on genetics, especially because I asso
ciated Tinker as someone who was more
based in the social sciences," Chyou added.
Professor of Anthropological Sciences
|im Fox said he did not agree with Pinker's
theory that processes like language acquisi
tion are completely coded for in our genes.
Fox said lie believes that culture and learn
ing play a large role in the formation of lan
guage in the brain and in the development
of dillerent languages across the world.
"II genes completely coded the way we
learn languages, then why don't we all speak
the same language?" Fox said.
"Many anthropologists find Pinker's
views very anti-anthropological. He has
pretty systematically downplayed evidence
c ited by anthropologists that there is a sig
nificant role for learning in processes like
human language," Fox added.
Fox concluded, "[Pinker] is a very good
writer, and I often use his books because he
knows how to explain complex topics in a
very clear and highly entertaining manner,
but he overemphasizes what he's trying to
get across and does not represent the ideas
of many other scientists in a fair manner."
Pinker is a professor at MIT, where he
teaches courses on the brain, language
and cognitive genetics. He has written sev
eral books on the study of language and
the brain, including "How the Mind
Works," "Words and Rules" and"The
Language Instinct." On sabbatical for the
2002-2008 school year, Pinker is currently
lectures and makes media appearances
around the nation.
