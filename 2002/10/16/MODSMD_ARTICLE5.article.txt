# Barak comes to Stanford
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford will have the opportunity to hear one of its
most influential alumni speak tonight when lormer Is
raeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak visits Memorial Audi
torium at 7:30 p.m. Barak's presence on campus is ex
pected to ignite tensions between members of some
pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian groups, and protest ef
forts are already underway.
"Hillel and |the] ASSU Speakers Bureau are the pri
mary sponsors," said ASSU President Monica Hene
stroza, a senior. "Many other student organizations in
terested in the dialogue that this event will produce are
cosponsoring."
According to Justin Wilson, a coterminal student
and director of the Speakers Bureau, Hillel was the
group that first brought up the possibility of an on
campus Barak appearance, although the project itself
has been a partnership.

"We were first made aware of the opportunity of
having Barak come to campus this summer through
11illel at Stanford," Wilson said. "The Speakers Bureau
and Hillel have been working in partnership on the
event and have shared in the responsibilities at every
step of the way."
Mimi Feldman, Hillel member and the University's
Jewish student life coordinator, described how Hillel
arranged for Barak to come.
"Over the summer, Hillel learned that Ehud Barak
would be touring in the area and, as a Stanford alum
nus, was eager to come to the Stanford campus," Feld
man said. "We quickly contacted Justin Wilson and
Adam Kahn in the ASSU Speaker's Bureau to explore
the possibility of working together on this unusual op
portunity — we are very happy with this continued re
lationship."
According to Henestroza, there are many reasons

why it would be beneficial to have
someone like Barak come to the
University.
"I think the situation in the Mid
dle East has generated significant
controversy on campus and around
the world," Henestroza said.
"Barak can provide a first-hand
perspective that will be informative
for the Stanford community re
gardless of one's position on the

issue."
Wilson underscored the per
spective that an individual like
Barak could bring to campus about
the Middle East conflict, despite the
controversy that is expected to sur
round the visit.
"Most students are excited to
have Barak come to campus," Wil
son said. " There are some groups
that are organizing peaceful
protests prior to the event, which 1
believe adds to the experience in a
positive way and helps drive dia
logue on campus. We appreciate it
when they coordinate with us so we

can ensure a safe environment
where everyone has an opportunity
to have their voices heard."
Henestroza also recognized that
protests may occur. She comment
ed, "I have heard that students are
organizing to protest the event, but
I am not familiar with the details."
According to the Speakers Bu
reau Web site, ticket distribution
took place in White Plaza on a first
come, first-served basis.
"A record number of students
came to White Plaza to pick up tick
ets for this unique event," Feldman
said. "The ASSU Speakers Bureau

distributed tickets in White Plaza
according to policies that they have
used in the past. They did their ab
solute best to accommodate the ex
tremely high demand for this
event."
Despite these efforts to stream
line ticket distribution, many stu
dents still reported long lines and
overall confusion.
"I got in the line [and] it was a lit
tle bit chaotic," said one student. "I
got there just at the beginning,
when the line was starting and
everyone had lined up facing the
wrong way.

"They had to walk the entire line
over from facing the (Haw, and it
was a huge line of people. That
made it really chaotic. People said it
took them two hours and more. I
don't know whether that is true for
everyone though."
VVilson confirmed that the line
had to be moved and explained
why.
"I arrived just after 11:00 — dis
tribution was supposed to occur at
11:45 — to begin preparing for the
distribution and hundreds of peo
ple had already lined up in the mid
dle of White Plaza to nothing in par

ticular," Wilson said. "We immedi
ately moved the line away from
White Plaza to between Tresidder
and White Plaza to avoid any dis
tractions or conflict with the Na
tional Coming Out Day Celebra
tion."
He also explained that other fac
tors led to increased complications
in the ticket distribution process.
"Ticket distribution was a bit
slow due to the higher levels of se
curity necessary for this event and
the need to verify SUIDs," Wilson
said. "But I think it was still a fair
process."

According to the Speakers Bu
reau Web site, ticket distribution
took place in White Plaza on a first
come, first-served basis.
"A record number of students
came to White Plaza to pick up tick
ets for this unique event," Feldman
said. "The ASSU Speakers Bureau

distributed tickets in White Plaza
according to policies that they have
used in the past. They did their ab
solute best to accommodate the ex
tremely high demand for this
event."
Despite these efforts to stream
line ticket distribution, many stu
dents still reported long lines and
overall confusion.
"I got in the line [and] it was a lit
tle bit chaotic," said one student. "I
got there just at the beginning,
when the line was starting and
everyone had lined up facing the
wrong way.

"They had to walk the entire line
over from facing the (Haw, and it
was a huge line of people. That
made it really chaotic. People said it
took them two hours and more. I
don't know whether that is true for
everyone though."
VVilson confirmed that the line
had to be moved and explained
why.
"I arrived just after 11:00 — dis
tribution was supposed to occur at
11:45 — to begin preparing for the
distribution and hundreds of peo
ple had already lined up in the mid
dle of White Plaza to nothing in par

ticular," Wilson said. "We immedi
ately moved the line away from
White Plaza to between Tresidder
and White Plaza to avoid any dis
tractions or conflict with the Na
tional Coming Out Day Celebra
tion."
He also explained that other fac
tors led to increased complications
in the ticket distribution process.
"Ticket distribution was a bit
slow due to the higher levels of se
curity necessary for this event and
the need to verify SUIDs," Wilson
said. "But I think it was still a fair
process."
Stanford will have the opportunity to hear one of its
most influential alumni speak tonight when lormer Is
raeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak visits Memorial Audi
torium at 7:30 p.m. Barak's presence on campus is ex
pected to ignite tensions between members of some
pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian groups, and protest ef
forts are already underway.
"Hillel and |the] ASSU Speakers Bureau are the pri
mary sponsors," said ASSU President Monica Hene
stroza, a senior. "Many other student organizations in
terested in the dialogue that this event will produce are
cosponsoring."
According to Justin Wilson, a coterminal student
and director of the Speakers Bureau, Hillel was the
group that first brought up the possibility of an on
campus Barak appearance, although the project itself
has been a partnership.

"We were first made aware of the opportunity of
having Barak come to campus this summer through
11illel at Stanford," Wilson said. "The Speakers Bureau
and Hillel have been working in partnership on the
event and have shared in the responsibilities at every
step of the way."
Mimi Feldman, Hillel member and the University's
Jewish student life coordinator, described how Hillel
arranged for Barak to come.
"Over the summer, Hillel learned that Ehud Barak
would be touring in the area and, as a Stanford alum
nus, was eager to come to the Stanford campus," Feld
man said. "We quickly contacted Justin Wilson and
Adam Kahn in the ASSU Speaker's Bureau to explore
the possibility of working together on this unusual op
portunity — we are very happy with this continued re
lationship."
According to Henestroza, there are many reasons

Ehud Barak, former prime minister of Israel and a Stanford alumnus, will speak in Memorial Auditorium at 7:30 p.m.
why it would be beneficial to have
someone like Barak come to the
University.
"I think the situation in the Mid
dle East has generated significant
controversy on campus and around
the world," Henestroza said.
"Barak can provide a first-hand
perspective that will be informative
for the Stanford community re
gardless of one's position on the

issue."
Wilson underscored the per
spective that an individual like
Barak could bring to campus about
the Middle East conflict, despite the
controversy that is expected to sur
round the visit.
"Most students are excited to
have Barak come to campus," Wil
son said. " There are some groups
that are organizing peaceful
protests prior to the event, which 1
believe adds to the experience in a
positive way and helps drive dia
logue on campus. We appreciate it
when they coordinate with us so we

can ensure a safe environment
where everyone has an opportunity
to have their voices heard."
Henestroza also recognized that
protests may occur. She comment
ed, "I have heard that students are
organizing to protest the event, but
I am not familiar with the details."
