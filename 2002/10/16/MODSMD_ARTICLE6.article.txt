# Magazine honors Stanford scientists
## Discover puts Daily and Drell among top-50 women nationwide 
### KRISTIN MORITZ 
In a November feature article,
Discover Magazine compiled a list
of the " l op 50 Women Scientists
in the Country." Among those rec
ognized by the magazine were two
Stanford faculty members:
Crete hen Daily, an associate pro
lessor of research in biological sci
ences, and Persis Drell, director of
research at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center.
Kathy Svitil, an associate editor
for the magazine, spent three
years researching, interviewing
and selecting the final 50 women.
In a time when men comprise the
majority of noted scientists, the
magazine's editors thought that
the women making significant ad
vances in their fields should re
ceive the same acknowledgement.
"It will take goodwill and hard
work to make science a good
choice fora woman, but it is an ef
fort at which we cannot afford to
fail," Svitil wrote in her article.
" The next Einstein or the next
Pasteur may be alive right now —
and she might be thinking it's not
worth the hassle."
Daily, whose research focuses
on biodiversity loss, graduated
from Stanford in 1986 and later
received a doctorate in biological

sciences from the University. In
addition to her recognition in Dis
cover, Daily was a recipient of the
21st Century Scientist Award in
2000.
She has documented her work
in over 100 scientific and popular
articles, and she published her
third book, "The New Economy
of Nature: The Quest to Make
Conservation Possible," this year.
Daily has been credited with
revolutionizing the study of con
servation by uniting economists,
legal scholars and humanists in a
partnership to protect ecosystems.
" Through my work with biodi
versity loss, 1 have been studying
which resources our society is like
ly to retain in decades to come,"
Daily said. "Most recently I have
been looking at different animal
species and analyzing those that
are vital to our environment and
those that society can afford to
lose. From this information, 1 can
assess the current conservation
policies."
As a high-energy experimen
talist, Drell concentrates on un
derstanding the building blocks
of nature at their most basic
level. She came to the University
six months ago from Cornell
University to accept her current
position.
Though Drell grew up in the
Palo Alto area, she went to Welles
ley College for her undergraduate
studies. Drell received her doctor-

ate in atomic physics from UC-
Berkeley and, during her post
doctorate work, she focused her
research on high-energy experi
mental physics and astrophysics.
"I moved to California to man
age the research program at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter, which is one of the great labo
ratories in the country," Drell said.
"I think that taking on this leader
ship role in overseeing such a
major lab may have been what
caught the magazine's attention."
