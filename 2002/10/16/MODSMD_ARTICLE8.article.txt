# Students bridge gap between Farm and EPA
## Community service initiatives bring Stanford volunteers to Ravenswood School District 
### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU 
Hardly a highway separates East Palo Alto
from the Stanford campus, yet the divide be
tween the two communities is huge. Thanks to
the volunteer work of Stanford students, the di
vide is growing smaller.
While the Peninsula as a whole is one of the
country's wealthiest pockets, the 2.5 square
mile city of East Palo Alto can feel like another
country from its glitzy neighbors. The city com
prises just three and a half percent of San Mateo
County's population, yet EPA residents make
up 25 percent of the county welfare caseload.
Many of the inhabitants of East Palo Alto are
immigrants and have little knowledge of Eng
lish. As a result, 61 percent of kindergarten
through eighth grade students have limited
English proficiency.
Stanford students could keep sipping their
Jamba Juice smoothies and ignore the fact that

about half of East Palo Alto high school students
will ch op out this year. But many have taken a
more ac tive approach.
They've helped bridge the gap with the
neighboring city by participating in the numer
ous community-service projects the 1 laas Cen
ter offers. Volunteer programs include
Ravenswood Reads, Upward Bound and the
East Palo Alto Tennis Program, among dozens
of others.
Ravenswood Reads takes Stanford students
into two elementary schools in East Palo Alto —
Costano and Cesar Chavez — to tutor second
through fifth graders who need additional
help. There, they participate in a minimum of
three 40-minute sessions per week and are as
signed to one of three reading curricula: Al
phabet, Word-Families or Reading Compre
hension.
"It's great the way the kids get excited to see
you," said reading tutor Kelly Landy, a sopho
more. "You feel like you've done something re
ally worthwhile."
Ravenswood Reads Tutor Coordinator Son
ali Murarka explained why Stanford students
often exceed the minimum time commitment:
"They enjoy volunteering because it gives them

(he opportunity to gain a new perspective on
large, seemingly distant issues that are in reali
ty just minutes from Stanford."
Upward Bound teat lies first-generation and
low-income high-school students in a broader
range of subjects: mathematics, sciences, Eng
lish and foreign languages. Tutors spend three
hours on Saturday afternoons with their stu
dents and call their tutees during the week to
check in.
Ranked as one of the nation's top ten inner
city tennis programs, EPA'IT combines acade
mics with tennis instruction. About 100 East
Palo Alto kids ages six to 18 work one-on-one
with Stanford students both in the classroom
and on the courts.
"I started doing EPATT because I really
wanted to work with kids" said Tutor Coordi
nator Amelia DeLaPaz, who's involved with the
academic side of the program and not the
sports. "We live in such a bubble here at Stan
ford. I feel like I'm helping to get rid of the dis
parity, even if it's only on a small scale."
Haas Service Fellow Jeb Ory summed up the
advantages of volunteering: "The work Stan
ford students do in East Palo Alto benefits both
sides of the street."
