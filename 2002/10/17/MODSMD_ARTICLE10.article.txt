## English's unlikely enemy 
### 
The status of the English lan
guage in the United States has
become increasingly precarious
since the advent of multicultur
alism, bilingual education and immigra
tion from non-Anglophone nations.
English proponents have argued that,
like it or not, it is the lingua franca of Amer
ican business and law, and to some degree,
global trade. Personally, while I studied
Spanish for six years and have a genuine re
spect for the language, I remain an un
abashed devotee of English. No other lan
guage has proven so versatile and adaptive
— consider the wealth of borrowings, not
only from classic and modern European
languages, but from languages as disparate
as Tongan and Narraganset. English has
clearly proven its ability to weather cen-

turies of political and so
cial change.
Flowever, it is not
merely the rise of Spanish
and other formerly
marginal languages that
imperils the hegemony of
English — an almost im
perceptible assault is
being waged from the

most unlikely of sources: American sports.
The color commentators of American
sports, but principally baseball, basketball
and football, are mangling and bastardiz
ing English perhaps more than any single
group. While many play-by-play broad
casters began their careers in journalism
and exhibit, by necessity, a considerable
degree of verbal dexterity, their color
counterparts — generally ex-athletes —
are often terminally tongue-tied. They
scour their oft-concussed brains fora ger
mane anecdote or a sagacious Lombardi
quote, but more often than not their
brains refuse to cooperate.
A speech pathology common to both
color and play-by-play commentators, how
ever, is their highly liberal approach to
grammatical rules. Consider: "Rumbles
ahead for the first down, does fon Ritchie;"
"And so, to their sophomore tailback the ball
goes;" "Quality person, Tony I^aßussa."
Is their mixed-up syntax — postpone
ment of the verb — a function of sports
commentators' love of German or Latin
(or Yoda)? Is their awkward verbiage evi
dence that English is their second lan
guage? < )r, as I am inclined to believe, have
they not quite grasped their fust language?
I regret to report that the problem is
not merely the commentators, however.
The sports establishment's subtle assault
on the English language is being fought
on another front as well: the chronic inar
ticulacy of the players and coaches them
selves. Considering the popularity of the
communication major among profession
al athletes, they certainly have a difficult
time communicating. It is nearly impossi
ble to extract a single nugget of meaning
ful commentary from the trite, aphoristk
babble of players and coaches. To this day

I cannot comprehend how a player per
forms a( "110 percent."
Have you noticed the trend toward
overly literal explanations as well? In a
post-game interview, you may have heard
the losing coach remark, "We just didn't
get the football in the end zone." What's
wrong with "We just didn't score?" Do ath
letes and their coaches have so little faith in
their fans' knowledge of the game that
they need to insert superfluous exposition
of how the game is played — indeed, with
which hall the game is played?
It was not always so. A man by the name
of Howard Cosell once endowed sports
commentary with erudition and elo
quence. More than a mere intellectual,
though, the former lawyer possessed a
tremendous love lor and an encyclopedic
knowledge of sports. Cosell became the
boxing announcer for Muhammad Ali
throughout his career; the two colorful
personalities formed a lasting friendship.
During his career with ABC 1 Sports, and
particularly Monday Night Football, Cosell
infused sports commentary with intelli
gence and wit. His manner of "telling it like
it is" often caused controversy. ATV Guide
from the 1970s lists Cosell as both the most
liked and most disliked sportscaster in
America. When he left Monday Night Foot
ball in 1983, he remarked that football had
become a "stagnant bore."
A few years ago, when ABC hired Den
nis Miller for its Monday Night Football
booth, I thought that sports commentary
might be approaching a renaissance. But
while Miller provided an undeniable intel
lectual spark, his esoteric allusions,
pompous egotism and insufferable smarm
simply did not lend themselves to the all-
American game.
Furthermore, he lacked Cosell's sin
cere love of sports. The show's Nielsen rat
ings floundered, and Miller was canned.
Fhe prospects seem dire for those of us
who love both English and sports. We des
perately need an articulate voice among
the din of seemingly illiterate has-beens. Is
this too much to ask? Would it be such a
bad thing to hold the beer-chinking arm
chair quarterbacks of the nation to a high
er standard?
