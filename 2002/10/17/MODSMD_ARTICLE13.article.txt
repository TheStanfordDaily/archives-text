Bus service isn't so bad
In two recent issues, The Daily stated
that weekend bus service to the city is ex
tremely bad and unbearable, with lower
frequency and longer trips [than offered
by theCaltrainj.Thisis not true and there
fore misleading to prospective students
who wish to make a trip to San Francisco.
Depending on the traffic, it takes from
45 to 65 minutes to go from Palo Alto to
San Francisco with this bus service, while it
takes 90 minutes on the train. So, the trip
duration can be half the duration of the
train trip when traffic is fluid.
There is one bus every hour, which is
about the same as what the Caltrain's fre
quency was on weekends. The only draw
back of the bus service is that the last one
leaves the city at 8 p.m. However, that does
not prevent anyone from spending the day
or part of the day in San Francisco.
There are certainly ways to improve the
current situation, but it is by no means as
bad as described.

Living-wage policy 'limited'
Last week, President Hennessy pre
sented the administration s Proposed Liv
ing Wage and Benefit Guidelines to the
Faculty Senate and told faculty that if they
have any questions or comments about the
policy to send individual e-mails to his of
fice. The senate was presented with a two
page policy that included a multitude of
clauses and loopholes and no data sup
porting the policy.
President Hennessy did not disclose
the source of the actual living-wage

amount that was used in the policy or what
constitutes health benefits for workers.
Furthermore, his suggestion that faculty
members e-mail their concerns without
receiving any information on the policy
demonstrates the University's lack of com
mitment to a true democratic decision
making process at Stanford.
President Hennessy's attempt to gather
token feedback at the Faculty Senate is one
of the many undemocratic actions that his
office has taken in regards to labor poli
cies. We applaud the University's commit
ment to setting lair labor standards and
providing a living wage, yet the actual pol
icy that has been drafted is so limited in its
scope that it will probably accomplish nei
ther goal.
The flaws in the policy are the direct re
sult of the way in which it was created. It
was drafted without the input of faculty,
students or, most importantly, workers â€”
the individuals who will be affected by
such a policy. President Hennessy has re
fused to meet with the Coalition for Labor
Justice because the group has insisted that
workers be present in meetings between
the coalition and the administration; his
office rejected that proposal, stating the
administration will only meet with work
ers during contract negotiations. It is cru
cial that the University meets with workers
and their union representatives to formu
late labor policies to ensure that such poli
cies will reinforce existing labor standards,
not undermine them.
The formulation of this living-wage
policy was announced last winter as a
band-aid response to student pressure
about labor issues on campus. The Coali
tion for Labor Justice has demanded that
the University address labor issues on
campus by formulating a comprehensive
Code of Conduct that will regulate basic

labor standards for all directly hired and
subcontracted workers. Stanford's living
wage policy is inadequate and does noth
ing to remedy the most deplorable labor
situations on campus. The policy excludes
temporary workers, Stanford Hospital
employees and unionized subcontracted
workers, and it fails to even mention the
number of workers it will affect, the types
of jobs they perform or the names of the
companies who employ them.
The policy's inadequacies reflect the
process by which it was conceived. The Uni
versity must collectively work with workers,
faculty and students to devise a compre
hensive Code of Conduct that addresses
the real concerns of workers on campus.
