# Stanford wins award for recycling
## 
### WHITNEY SADO 
Ixist month, Stanford won the
National Recycling Coalition's
award for Outstanding School
Program.
I he N R( 1 is a nonprofit organi
zation that promotes reduction,
recycling and composting through
education and outreach, and
awards individuals, communities
or businesses for significant contri
butions towards this aim. The
award was presented to the Uni
versity for its campus-wide recy
cling plan that in 2001 diverted 53
percent of waste from landfills into
other uses.
"The NRC awards program
recognizes the best of the best and
demonstrates that recycling is alive
and well," said Margetta Morris,
chairwoman of the NRC. "Being
an NRC award winner brings to
light the tremendous achieve
ments of individuals and organiza
tions."
The University's recycling pro
gram is run by Peninsula Sanitary
Service, Inc., or PSSI, a private
company that serves only the Stan
ford community.
"A key element of Stanford Re
cycling is its comprehensiveness,"
said Julie Muir, PSSI's community
relations manager.
The comprehensive nature of
the recycling program includes
reusing organic waste through
manure composting, grinding
logs into wood chips, chipping
brush into mulch, and grass cy
cling. Construction waste such as
dirt, asphalt, metal, drywall and
even electronic trash are recycled
in addition to typical paper and
plastic recycling. Muir noted that
this is essential to the recycling
program, as it involves everyone
on campus, whether they are
staff, students, repairmen or visi
tors.
"Everyone has the opportunity
to reduce waste here," Muir said.
Stanford Recycling was started
in the late 1970s as a student pro
ject. It later became a student orga

nization aided by PSSI until 1991,
when it became too large to be run
by students. PSSI's permanent stall
took over all collection in 1991, al
though students are still heavily in
volved in internships and in edu
cating the campus about recycling.
PSSI also processes and markets
recyclables and operates a commu
nity recycling center.
Last year, 11,300 tons of waste
that otherwise would have gone to
local landfills was recycled by the
Stanford campus community; the
percentage of waste diverted from
landfills has risen fr om 31 percent
in 1994 to 53 percent in 2001,
Muir said.
PSSI applied for the award in
June, and Muir and Grounds
Manager Herb Pong accepted
the award for the University at a
ceremony in Austin, Texas, on
Sept. 9.
Much of the campus remains
unaware of the University's award,
but Muir pointed out that some
colleges still do not have recycling
programs. She said that Califor
nia's public universities were man
dated to recycle a mere two years
ago.

Muir cautioned the Stanford
community not to become compla
cent with the program's success
thus far.
"There are many avenues for
future development," she said.
PSSI is planning to unveil a
new food-waste program in Janu
ary, with compost piles provided
in the dining halls. Diners will be
able to scrape their plates clean of
food after eating to avoid using
landfills for biodegradable food
products such as meat and veg
etables. This will also provide a lo
cation alternative to trash bins for
soiled paper, which is currently
not recyclable. With this new ad
dition to its recycling program,
PSSI hopes that the University
will be able to achieve a 70 percent
diversion of waste.
There are currently 3,000 bins
on campus to facilitate the recy
cling program, yet Muir said, "I
still find paper and bottles in the
trash, which is frustrating."
She said that she hopes this
award will make students proud of
their school's program and conse
quently remind them of the im
portance of recycling.

programs. She said that Califor
nia's public universities were man
dated to recycle a mere two years
ago.

Muir cautioned the Stanford
community not to become compla
cent with the program's success
thus far.
"There are many avenues for
future development," she said.
PSSI is planning to unveil a
new food-waste program in Janu
ary, with compost piles provided
in the dining halls. Diners will be
able to scrape their plates clean of
food after eating to avoid using
landfills for biodegradable food
products such as meat and veg
etables. This will also provide a lo
cation alternative to trash bins for
soiled paper, which is currently
not recyclable. With this new ad
dition to its recycling program,
PSSI hopes that the University
will be able to achieve a 70 percent
diversion of waste.
There are currently 3,000 bins
on campus to facilitate the recy
cling program, yet Muir said, "I
still find paper and bottles in the
trash, which is frustrating."
She said that she hopes this
award will make students proud of
their school's program and conse
quently remind them of the im
portance of recycling.

Stanford received the National Recycling Coalition's Outstanding School
Program award for its campus-wide recycling plan, which diverted 53 per
cent of waste from landfills into other uses in 2001.
