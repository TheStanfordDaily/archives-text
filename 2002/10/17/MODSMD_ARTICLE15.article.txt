### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Holding signs and lit candles,
demonstrators held a protest yester
day evening as former Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak addressed a
maximum-capacity audience in
Memorial Auditorium.
The protestors expressed their
discontent with Barak's past policies
concerning the Middle East peace
process. Approximately 50 individu
als from various groups throughout
the Bay Area gathered outside the
auditorium. Groups involved in
cluded the Stanford organization
Coalition for Justice in Israel / Pales
tine, as well as A Jewish Voice for
Peace and Global Exchange.
Joel Beinin,a professor of Middle
East History, discussed the specific
significance of A Jewish Voice for
Peace's protest against Barak.

"lt is very important to have a
Jewish voice say that we want the | Is
raeli] occupation to end," Beinin
said. "We think the occupation is the
principle source of the problem.
"We don't think Barak's offer [at
Camp David in July 2000] was a gen
erous offer, and we don't think the
extreme repressive measures that he
used in response to the Palestinian
uprisings were helpful."
liana Hairston, a fifth-year neu
roscience graduate student and par
ticipant in the protest, explained that
the demonstrators did not oppose
Barak's right to visit the University.
"We are happy to have Ehud
Barak speak on campus, as it gives us
a good opportunity to raise our con
cerns about the escalating violence in
Palestine and Israel," I lairston said.
"We believe Ehud Barak is largely
responsible for the current situation
in Palestine, as he was prime minis

terwhen the Intilada broke out."
Robert Lipton '81, a research sci
entist from UC-Berkeley and active
member of A Jewish Voice for Peace,
stated his objections to Barak's han
dling of the peace negotiations.
"The problem is that Barak was
claiming that he made a generous
offer to the Palestinians at the Camp
David negotiations of 2000," Lipton
said. "Everyone is functioning under
this myth of the generous offer, and
that is simply not the case... It turns
out that he and the United States of
fered an ultimatum to the Palestin
ian people. It was not treated as a ne
gotiation; it was dumped on the table
by Barak, and they said take it or
leave."
I lairston seconded Lipton's sen
timents.
"The famed 'generous offer'
which he touts is a travesty," Hair
ston said. "The maps that were final

ly shown to the public reveal a system
of enclaves surrounded by areas of
Israeli control, akin to the system of
bantustans developed in South
Africa during the apartheid
[regime]."
Lipton explained that Yasser
Arafat was also justified in refusing to
negotiate at Camp David based 011
the shortcomings of Barak's offer.
"It left Palestinians far short of a
viable state," Lipton continued.
"The question of Jerusalem was not
properly discussed, and the question
of refugees was not properly dis
cussed.
"If they accepted the offer, the
Palestinians would not have control
of their own water rights, air space,
or their borders. Every border
would be controlled by Israel — this
is not a real state."
Junior Lizzi Heydemann, presi
dent of the Jewish Leadership

Council of I lillel, explained that "in
dividuals within the Jewish commu
nity have varying stances on Camp
David. But I lillel's political stance in
cludes, without question, that a de
mocratic and Jewish Israel exist in
the Middle East with secure and rec
ognized borders."
Stanford Israel Alliance Co-Presi
dent Tali Golan pointed out that
protestors should look at the greater
significance of Camp David.
"The technical aspects or the de
tails of what were offered at Camp
David are not the real issue," Golan
said. "The real issue is that Arafat re
fused a historic proposal. No prime
minister has gone this far in making
sacrifices for his country, and the fact
that Arafat refused to even take this
proposal as a basis for negotiation
shows he is not a partner for peace."
Josh Saidoff, Class of'o2, under
scored the opportunity that Arafat

missed by refusing Barak's offer at
Camp David.
"I think, unequivocally, the
blame for the failure at Camp David
is Arafat," Saidoff said. "1 absolutely
feel that had Arafat genuinely in
tended to resolve the issue in the
manner prescribed by the Oslo Ac
cords, and had he intended for there
to be a two-state solution, that he
could have had it."
Though the ASSU Speakers Bu
reau sponsored the Barak speech in
conjunction with llillel, ASSU Sen
ate Chair Ho Cowgill, a senior, ex
plained that the ASSU has no official
stance on the arguments regarding
Barak's policies.
"The ASSU is not for or against
the protesting," Cowgill said. "We
are for Stanford students raising
their voices on anything. It is all
about expression and dialogue — as
long as it is peaceful, it is fine."
