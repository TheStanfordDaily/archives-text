Frankie Albert passed away on Sept. 4.
He was 82. Perhaps you'd heard of
him, but more likely the name is un
familiar.
A black and white photomontage of Stan
ford's 1941 Rose Bowl team, displaying wear
112 rom years of exposure to nacho grease and
sweat from students following a workout
next door, hangs in the first booth at the
Treehouse.
Number 13, the guy in the middle with the
white leather helmet, exaggerated pose and
goofy grimace on his face is the one. That's
Frankie Albert.
I, for one, had never heard of him. Perhaps
I'd come across his name in football books or

online over the years, but
until recently he might as
well have been Fat Albert or
Frankie Four Fingers to me.
They say that a picture is
worth a thousand words, but
the picture in this case just
wouldn't do the man justice
— not given the way my
grandfather, a Stanford
alum and my primary source

for this column, talks about seeing the left
handed Stanford siinger play as a kid.
As my grandfather put it, recalling his ex
periences at every home game of the 1940 sea
son, "He was different than anything you'd
ever seen before."
Being just the twinkle of the twinkle in my
grandfather's eye at the time, I obviously
never had the luxury of seeing him myself. I
can only rely upon my grandfather's memo
ries and historical sports literature to shape my
knowledge of the man.
With reunion weekend upon us, it's a fit
ting time to remember Albert, a true Stan
ford football legend of the past, in less than
1,000 words:
Following a dismal 1-7-1 campaign in 1939,
Stanford hired Clark Shaughnessy as head
coach. Shaughnessy had coached at the Uni
versity of Chicago until the university decided
to drop its football program that year, a for
gettable one that included an 85-0 loss to
Michigan.
He had big plans at Stanford and they all
involved Albert, who had spent his unherald
ed sophomore year on the Farm splitting time
at tailback.
One of my grandfather's good friends re
calls conversing with Albert, who manned the
gates at Stanford Stadium during his fresh
man season in 1938. Freshmen in those days
did not play.
As a junior, Allwrt blossomed into his new

role as quarterback, flourishing as the first
play-caller to run the modern T-formation.
The quarterback under center coupled with
two backs lined up next to each other behind
him formed the "T."
Albert doubled as the team's kicker and
punter as well, boominga season-long 79-yard
punt against Oregon State.
"He was the greatest defensive back I've
ever seen," my grandfather's friend said,
going on to describe a play in the 1940 Big
Game where Albert saved a sure touchdown
following an interception by running down
the return man a la Darrell Green on Tony
Dorset!.
Befuddling opposing defenses with the un
familiar set, which utilized fake handoffs,
bootlegs and motion, Albert and the "Wow
Boys," as the team would come to be called,
wenl 1 ()-() that season.
The Indians capped off their magical run
with a 21-13 win over Nebraska in the Rose
Bowl on New Years Day in 1941, marking the
greatest one-year turnaround in college loot
ball history.
While the team was less successful the fol
lowing year, finishing 6-3, Albert and Shaugh
nessy had left their marks on Stanford football.
Number 13 finished his college career as a
two-time Ail-American and twice finished in
the top-four in the I leisman Trophy balloting.
Albert was a first-round NFL draft-pick by
the Chicago Bears, but he deferred to serve in
the Navy during World War 11. Later, he
would earn professional fame with the San
Francisco 49ers.
Albert was elected into the College Foot
ball I fall of Fame in 1956, but whereas other
college football legends, from Walter Camp
and Doak Walker to Jim Brown and Archie
Griffin, are remembered for awards they
won —even awards named in their honor —
Albert's fame is arguably more grandiose, if
less recognized.
I lis legacy, along with that ofShaughnessy,
persists in the playbooks of virtually every f(>ot
ball team today — Pop Warner and profes
sional alike.
I can only hope that I'll be able to recite
fond memories of Stanford greats I saw
play to my children and grandchildren. II
nothing else, I can tell them about Frankie
Albert because, while the man may be gone,
his legend, like the picture in the Free
house, endures.

Scull Allen is an undeclared sophomore who holds
old hope thai Buddy Teevrns and Chris Iswis can
come up with a new formation to rex'olat ionize the
sport. E-mail him at ssallenQt stanford.edu.
