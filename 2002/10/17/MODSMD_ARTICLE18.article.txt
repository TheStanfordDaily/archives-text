# Volleyball looks to overcome pair of tough conference losses
## 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
The floor of Maples Pavilion is
known around the NCAA for
being one of the bounciest in any
arena in the country. There aren't
too many other volleyball venues
around where you can clearly see
the floor clip an inch or two when
someone is preparing to jump for
a kill or a block.
But the way the Maples floor was
moving Monday evening during
the Stanford women's volleyball
team's practice was just unnatural.
The way the players were hurling
themselves at the ground digging
for balls to make the floor move that
way was even more so.
Diving, sliding, tumbling and all
the other tokens of all-out hustle

vs. No. 17 Washington St., Toniqht.
7:00 p.m.
were in full effect during the No. 6
Cardinal's (14-3, 5-2 Pacific-10
Conference) first practice since
blowing a 2-0 lead in its five-game
loss to the No. 19 Arizona in Tucson
Friday night.
That loss, combined with the lin
gering frustration from its five
game loss at home to No. 1 South
ern (California the weekend before,
set a determined tone in practice
this week for the Cardinal, leading
up to tonight's match with No. 17
Washington State (14-3,4-3) at 7:00
p.m. in Maples.
"Wejust had the hardest practice
we've had in months," junior setter
Anna Robinson said after Monday's

two-and-a-half hour session. "We've
got more fire in us than ever. We've
got lots of motivation to go out and
play hard. We don't want to let any
thing like what happened [at Ari
zona] happen again."
Tonight's contest with the
Cougars wraps up a stretch of five
straight matches against ranked
conference opponents for Stanford,
as the Cardinal completes its first set
of meetings with the Pac-10's slate of
top-25 teams.
Stanford is 2-2 during the span
so far, but the reality for the Cardi
nal is that it was really only three
points away from being 4-0. Stan
ford had seven match points in its
loss to the Trojans and was locked
up at 28-28 with a 2-1 lead in the
fourth game against the Wildcats.
The difference looks small on the
scoreboard, but it has had a big im
pact in the Pac-10 standings, drop
ping Stanford two and a half games
behind first-place USC as the mid
point of the season approaches.
More than anything, it's made it
clear for the Cardinal how hard it's
going to have to work during and
between matches to successfully de
fend its Pac-10 and NCAA titles
from last year.
"We had a team meeting before
[Monday] to say that we don't ever
want to play again the way we did
[against Arizona]," coach John
Dunning said. "It's all about ef
fort, communication and desire. I
think we're very capable of beat
ing anyone on any day, but we're
not anywhere near as good as I
want us to be.
"We haven't had the right feeling

about everything, so we had to do
some talking to figure out how to get
to the place where it feels like we
want it to. It's a matter of working
hard enough that you feel like you
deserve it to go your way."
Once the Cardinal gets that leel
ing, it has plenty of reason to be con
fident that the placers it has on its
roster are more than enough to get
it back to the top of the conference
and the country.
Juniors Jenn Harvey and Sara
McGee are the Pac-10's top middle
blockers, combining for 2.9 blocks
per game, an average output high
er than that of any other team in the
conference. Ail-American outside
hitters senior Logan Tom and
sophomore Ogonna Nnamani are
both among the top seven in the
Pac-lOin kills. McGee leads the con
ference with a .451 hitting percent
age, driving Stanford to hit a Pac-
I 0-best .317. And senior outside bit
ter Ashley Ivy leads the conference
in aces with 41.
Passing and digging remain as
the lone weak spots for Stanford.
Arizona ran off 12 service aces on
the Cardinal last Friday, and Stan
ford is last in the conference in

digging.
Hence, the Cardinal women
hitting the floor hard in practice,
trying to bring its defense to the
same level as its conference-lead
ing offense.
"We're focusing on ourselves a
lot. We're not worrying too much
about what the other team is
doing," senior defensive specialist
Lindsey Yamasaki said. "Our main
drive all year is to get better every
week."
fhe Cougars could potentially
match up well with the Cardinal as
they enter tonight second in the
Pac-10 in kills and digs.
Outside hitters LaToya Harris
and Adrian Hankofflead Washing
ton State with a combined 7.38 kills
per game. Libero Kortneyjamtaas
is second in the Pac-10 in digs, av
eraging 4.00 digs per game after
coming up with 30 in the Cougars'
3-1 loss to Washington last week
end.
fhe Cougars have been slowly
climbing in the national rankings all
year, though Friday's loss to the
Huskies leaves them at 0-3 on the
road in conference play. But Wash
ington Suite did knock off both the
Wildcats and No. 21 Arizona State at

were in full effect during the No. 6
Cardinal's (14-3, 5-2 Pacific-10
Conference) first practice since
blowing a 2-0 lead in its five-game
loss to the No. 19 Arizona in Tucson
Friday night.
That loss, combined with the lin
gering frustration from its five
game loss at home to No. 1 South
ern (California the weekend before,
set a determined tone in practice
this week for the Cardinal, leading
up to tonight's match with No. 17
Washington State (14-3,4-3) at 7:00
p.m. in Maples.
"Wejust had the hardest practice
we've had in months," junior setter
Anna Robinson said after Monday's

two-and-a-half hour session. "We've
got more fire in us than ever. We've
got lots of motivation to go out and
play hard. We don't want to let any
thing like what happened [at Ari
zona] happen again."
Tonight's contest with the
Cougars wraps up a stretch of five
straight matches against ranked
conference opponents for Stanford,
as the Cardinal completes its first set
of meetings with the Pac-10's slate of
top-25 teams.
Stanford is 2-2 during the span
so far, but the reality for the Cardi
nal is that it was really only three
points away from being 4-0. Stan
ford had seven match points in its
loss to the Trojans and was locked
up at 28-28 with a 2-1 lead in the
fourth game against the Wildcats.
The difference looks small on the
scoreboard, but it has had a big im
pact in the Pac-10 standings, drop
ping Stanford two and a half games
behind first-place USC as the mid
point of the season approaches.
More than anything, it's made it
clear for the Cardinal how hard it's
going to have to work during and
between matches to successfully de
fend its Pac-10 and NCAA titles
from last year.
"We had a team meeting before
[Monday] to say that we don't ever
want to play again the way we did
[against Arizona]," coach John
Dunning said. "It's all about ef
fort, communication and desire. I
think we're very capable of beat
ing anyone on any day, but we're
not anywhere near as good as I
want us to be.
"We haven't had the right feeling

about everything, so we had to do
some talking to figure out how to get
to the place where it feels like we
want it to. It's a matter of working
hard enough that you feel like you
deserve it to go your way."
Once the Cardinal gets that leel
ing, it has plenty of reason to be con
fident that the placers it has on its
roster are more than enough to get
it back to the top of the conference
and the country.
Juniors Jenn Harvey and Sara
McGee are the Pac-10's top middle
blockers, combining for 2.9 blocks
per game, an average output high
er than that of any other team in the
conference. Ail-American outside
hitters senior Logan Tom and
sophomore Ogonna Nnamani are
both among the top seven in the
Pac-lOin kills. McGee leads the con
ference with a .451 hitting percent
age, driving Stanford to hit a Pac-
I 0-best .317. And senior outside bit
ter Ashley Ivy leads the conference
in aces with 41.
Passing and digging remain as
the lone weak spots for Stanford.
Arizona ran off 12 service aces on
the Cardinal last Friday, and Stan
ford is last in the conference in

digging.
Hence, the Cardinal women
hitting the floor hard in practice,
trying to bring its defense to the
same level as its conference-lead
ing offense.
"We're focusing on ourselves a
lot. We're not worrying too much
about what the other team is
doing," senior defensive specialist
Lindsey Yamasaki said. "Our main
drive all year is to get better every
week."
fhe Cougars could potentially
match up well with the Cardinal as
they enter tonight second in the
Pac-10 in kills and digs.
Outside hitters LaToya Harris
and Adrian Hankofflead Washing
ton State with a combined 7.38 kills
per game. Libero Kortneyjamtaas
is second in the Pac-10 in digs, av
eraging 4.00 digs per game after
coming up with 30 in the Cougars'
3-1 loss to Washington last week
end.
fhe Cougars have been slowly
climbing in the national rankings all
year, though Friday's loss to the
Huskies leaves them at 0-3 on the
road in conference play. But Wash
