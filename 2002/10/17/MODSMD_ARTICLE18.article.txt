# Volleyball looks to overcome pair of tough conference losses
## 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
The floor of Maples Pavilion is
known around the NCAA for
being one of the bounciest in any
arena in the country. There aren't
too many other volleyball venues
around where you can clearly see
the floor clip an inch or two when
someone is preparing to jump for
a kill or a block.
But the way the Maples floor was
moving Monday evening during
the Stanford women's volleyball
team's practice was just unnatural.
The way the players were hurling
themselves at the ground digging
for balls to make the floor move that
way was even more so.
Diving, sliding, tumbling and all
the other tokens of all-out hustle

vs. No. 17 Washington St., Toniqht.

were in full effect during the No. 6
Cardinal's (14-3, 5-2 Pacific-10
Conference) first practice since
blowing a 2-0 lead in its five-game
loss to the No. 19 Arizona in Tucson
Friday night.
That loss, combined with the lin
gering frustration from its five
game loss at home to No. 1 South
ern (California the weekend before,
set a determined tone in practice
this week for the Cardinal, leading
up to tonight's match with No. 17
Washington State (14-3,4-3) at 7:00
p.m. in Maples.
"Wejust had the hardest practice
we've had in months," junior setter
Anna Robinson said after Monday's

two-and-a-half hour session. "We've
got more fire in us than ever. We've
got lots of motivation to go out and
play hard. We don't want to let any
thing like what happened [at Ari
zona] happen again."
Tonight's contest with the
Cougars wraps up a stretch of five
straight matches against ranked
conference opponents for Stanford,
as the Cardinal completes its first set
of meetings with the Pac-10's slate of
top-25 teams.
Stanford is 2-2 during the span
so far, but the reality for the Cardi
nal is that it was really only three
points away from being 4-0. Stan
ford had seven match points in its
loss to the Trojans and was locked
up at 28-28 with a 2-1 lead in the
fourth game against the Wildcats.
The difference looks small on the
scoreboard, but it has had a big im
pact in the Pac-10 standings, drop
ping Stanford two and a half games
behind first-place USC as the mid
point of the season approaches.
More than anything, it's made it
clear for the Cardinal how hard it's
going to have to work during and
between matches to successfully de
fend its Pac-10 and NCAA titles
from last year.
"We had a team meeting before
[Monday] to say that we don't ever
want to play again the way we did
[against Arizona]," coach John
Dunning said. "It's all about ef
fort, communication and desire. I
think we're very capable of beat
ing anyone on any day, but we're
not anywhere near as good as I
want us to be.
"We haven't had the right feeling

With a tough conference schedule against nationally-ranked opponents, the
