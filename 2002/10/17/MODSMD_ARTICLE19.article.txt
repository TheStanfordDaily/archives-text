# World Series puts football on hold
## 
### 
Saturday is homecoming. Per
haps that will motivate the loot
ball team against Arizona, al
though 1 doubt it.
But that's not the only reason you
won't find meat Stanford Stadium this
Saturday afternoc >n.
1 won't be there because I'll be
putting some hot dogs on the grill, some
beer on ice and my ass in front of the TV
— Saturday is also Game 1 of the World
Series.
Look, it's not a knock on "Operation

Cardinal," which I
think was a good oper
ation to begin with
until the enemy man
aged to intercept all of
our radio communica
tions, supply lines and
tactical data maps.
(That's what I'm blam
ing the 1-4 start on,
anyway).

It's that an all-California World Se
ries has only happened three previous

times in the history of the world, so I'm
riding this one for all it's worth while
I'm here.
Yon always hear about the East Coast
bias. They get Monday Night Football
prime time. They had Biggie Smalls
and Puff Daddy. They get the Today
Show live. They have almost every team
in the WUSA.
But we get the late game box scores
in our paper the next morning. We get

football on television as soon as we
wake up on the weekend. VVe get
Snoop, Ore and Pac. We get out
door sports year round. We get
sunshine on Christmas. We get
those California avocados. We get
earthquakes. ((3k, bad example.)
And now we get two teams in the
World Series.
It's a Series full of characters.

You've got Barry "I'm not perfor
mance enhanced" Bonds, whose
glare at the end of his sacrifice lly in
the eighth inning of Game 5 of the
NLCS wasn't exacdy the look of a
team player who had just tied the
game for his squad.
You've got Benito Santiago,
who I'm sure is taking most of my
paychecks home in Social Security.
You've got Francisco Rodriguez,
who is younger than most of Roble
Hall. You've got the "King Fish,"
the "X-Factor" and then that rally
monkey.

If that damn monkey isn't rea
son enough to watch the Series, I
don't know what is.
This time last year I was in Flo
rence, where watching the World
Series required a fair amount of
planning. Our locale of choice was
"II Fauno," a sports-pub on Via
Cavour that served up mean pizza
and gave you a discount on the 10-
liter beer il it was your birthday.
Baseball was squeezed into their
lineup just between minor league
soccer highlights and Kylie
Minogue music videos. Neverthe

less, they showed every game of the
Series. That was fantastic. They
also showed every game on a clay or
two delay. That was slightly less
than fantastic.
What this meant was that every
day of the Series, everyone who
wanted to have any suspense
watching the game had to avoid
Web sites that would say anything
about the game, and avoid reading
the International Herald Tribune
or Gazzetto dello Sport, Italy's
finest sports paper. It was like a sell
imposed sports-fast every day, for

almost two weeks.
So now I'm immersing myself in
it all, making up for lost time. I've
got my Thunder Stix and my Rally
Rag. I'll be watching like everyone
else to see if Bonds is going to keep
launching balls to those fools in
kayaks in McCovey Cove or if he's
going to revert to form and self-im
plode in the playoffs like he's al
ways done before.
Ill be watching to see if the Gi
ants can come up with those clutch
late-inning rallies they had in their
first two playoff series, or if the An

gels can bat around and put up an
other 10 spot.
So I'm sorry, Operation Cardi
nal, but you'll have to wait for me to
come back to a game again. I've got
Operation World Series going on
this weekend.

Matt Babin is a senior majoring in eco
nomics who thinks the smartest invest
ment around was to pick up some tickets
at Pac Hell Park this morning and put
them up on eßay. If you've got extra
tickets for Games 3, 4 or 5, send him an
e-mail at babin@skinford.edu.
