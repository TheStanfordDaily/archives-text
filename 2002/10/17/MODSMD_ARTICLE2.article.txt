# Barak addresses packed house at Mem Aud

### JENNIFER GRAHAM WILL OREMUS EDITORIAL STAFF 
Emphasizing the importance of win
ning the war against terrorism, the ur
gency of ousting Iraqi President Sad
dam Hussein, and the unwillingness of
the Palestinian leadership to work to
ward peace, former Israeli Prime Minis
ter and Stanford alumnus Ehud Barak
addressed the prospects of peace in the
Middle East before a capacity crowd at
Memorial Auditorium last night.
In a speech tempered by humor but
characterized by force, Barak called on
audience members to summon the
courage and determination of the
World War II and Cold War genera
tions in the current war on terrorism.
"We are in the opening year of an
epic struggle," said Barak, who served
as the lOth prime minister of Israel
from 1999 to 2001. "Now in 2002, the
greatest challenge to our generation is
to free the world form the reign of ter
ror and deliver freedom to people
everywhere."
Barak opened his remarks by reflect
ing upon his experience at Stanford,
which he described as two of the best
years of his life.
"I feel here at home," said Barak,
who in 1979 graduated with a master's
degree in economic engineering sys

tems. "Very tew tilings that I have done
have given me so ninth delight and so
much positive response from people
around tlie* world than the tact that I
can say I'm a Stanford graduate."
The topic quickly turned to the state
of the post-Sept. 11 world, which Barak
described as "uniquely turbulent and
uncertain."
"A year after Sept. 11, it is still a time
of testing, and the toughest tests may
still lie ahead," he said.
Affirming the reality of the biologi
cal, chemical and nuclear threat posed
by terrorist groups such as al-Qaida,
Barak urged the audience to prepare
for the consequences of what he de
scribed as a long but necessary struggle.
"Many innocent civilians, as well as
people in uniform, may lose their lives
along the way, but we have to win this
first world war of the 21st century, and
we will," lie said.
"After Sept. 11, nothing about terror
t an ever be taken for granted or be seen
as inconceivable," lie said. "The choice
is clear: Destroy world terror, or be de
stroyed by it."
Barak, who served in the Israeli De
fense Force for over -U) years and is
often described as Israel's mostdecorat
ed soldier, illustrated the need for ruth
less resolve as lie recounted some of his
most memorable operations against
Palestinian militants. He told the audi

ence about a successful raid he led on a
hijacked airplane, and he described the
execution of a I lamas leader he carried
out while disguised as a female brunette
— "with everything in place," he
laughed, gesturing toward his chest.
Barak returned to the topic of the
war against terrorism and praised the
example U.S. President George W.
Bush set by striking quickly in
Afghanistan last year, an action he de
scribed as an effective deterrent.
"To the best of my judgment, the
course that has been set by the Bush ad
ministration is the right one," he said.
Barak then segued into the merits of
removing Hussein from power, stress
ing that no one can be sure when Iraq's
leader will acquire a crude nuclear
weapon.
"Previous violations of many United
Nations Security Council resolutions
provide the legitimacy to remove him
before it is too late," he said, defending
the "moral and strategic clarity" of
Bush's motives fora strike against Iraq.
Barak said any future war with Iraq
would be a"different ballgame" ifaction
was not taken against Hussein before he
acquired nuclear weapons, and he ar
gued that the United States should
quickly push fora U.N. resolution au
thorizing force if "full Iraqi compliance

is not forthcoming."
In a press conference prior to
his talk, Barak characterized the Is
raeli public as generally supportive
of U.S. military action in Iraq. He
cited an increased ability to vacci
nate the populace against small
pox and the further development
of anti-ballistic missile systems as
evidence that the country could ad
equately defend itself in the event
of an Iraqi offensive.
He added that, ii Iraq were to
launch a substantial attack against
Israel, it would not ref rain fiom re
sponding.
"We don't pretend it's for us to
decide, but I believe that there is
wide support in Israel for the
need to disarm Saddam Hussein.
Few [Israelis are] so naive as to be
lieve that Saddam will disarm
himself without being ousted

from power."
"Freeing the region from Sad
dam I lussein would also create the
opportunity for progress in peace
between Israelis and Palestinians,"
he added, arguing that inaction is
the greatest risk. " The last century
lias shown us what the price of
paralysis can be."
Barak then addressed the state
of affairs between Israel and Pales
tine, indicting Palestine Liberation
Organization Chairman Yasser
Arafat for walking away from the
2000 Camp David peace talks and
outlining his own views on how the
Israeli government should now
proceed to achieve peace.
In reference to the current up
swing in violence, Barak said, "In
essence, it is a Palestinian attempt
to impose upon Israel suicide
bombings as a new diplomatic tool.
Israel will never, ever yield to this
terror."
Barak also recapped the pro
posal presented to Arafat at Camp
David, contending that "this offer

was much closer to the Palestinian
demands than to the Israeli de
mands."
lie said that Arafat, whom he
derisively called Hussein's "best
friend," "walked out of the room
and deliberately and consciously
turned to this suicide bombing and

said.
Addressing the current state of
affiiiis, Barak outlined the"three
pillars" lie thought should charac
terize Israeli foreign policy.
The first was to strike decisively
against terror iu all its forms, a pol
icy he said was already in place

"I believe that there is wide support in Israel for the
need to disarm Saddam Hussein. . . The last century
has shown us what the price of paralysis can be
— Ehud Barak

terror.
"Arafat does not have the char
acter of President [Anwar] Saddat
or King Hussein [of Jordan]," he
said, arguing that Arafat's inflexi
bility and reluctance to take a con
troversial stand kept him from
making a decision that would
greatly benefit his constituents.
"Arafat on the most profound
level does not recognize I he right of
Israel to exist as a Jewish state,"he

undercurrent Israeli Prime Minis
ter Ariel Sharon.
But, he ridded, "I believe we
should have another two pillars to
our strategy that are now missing."
()ne was to "leave I he door open
for the resumption of negotiations
at any moment, with no precondi
tions except the complete absence
of violence, based on the principles
of Gamp David."
The other was to "disengage"

Israel from the Palestinians in the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip by
building a guarded fence around
Israel proper, three main settle
ment bloc ks, and a slice of the bor
der with Jordan. Stating that these
enclosed areas would comprise
"no more than 25 percent of (he
West Bank," Barak said that the
plan would c all tor the relocation
of Israeli settlers living beyond the
fence.
Barak based his support of the
fence proposal on the success of a
50-mile "pilot" fence already in
place around the Gaza Strip, and
noted that the West Bank fence
would not represent a legal or for
mal annexation of the settlement
blocks it enclosed.
" The terrorists do not know
how to cross the fence," he said,
eliciting laughter from pockets in
the audience.
Aside from saving lives, Barak
said, the* partitioning of Israel from
the bulk of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip would be a necessary

condition for maintaining a Jewish
majority in Israel.
"If there is only one political en
tity in [the land between the
Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan
Riverj, it will inevitably become ei
ther non-Jewish or non-democrat
ic," he said.
Barak reiterated the demands
that Bush has presented to Arafat
and discussed the benefits that
could result from a new Palestinian
leadership.
" The moment a different Pales
tinian leadership will emerge or
appear, I assure you within several
weeks you will see a majority of Is
raelis ready to go back to negotia
tions."
Barak concluded his speech
with a summary of his major points
and an appeal to the cause of social
justice worldwide.
"Nothing should weaken our
sense of purpose when we are
fighting with terror and evil, but we
should never lose sight of the poor
of the earth," lie said.

He added that, ii Iraq were to
launch a substantial attack against
Israel, it would not ref rain fiom re
sponding.
"We don't pretend it's for us to
decide, but I believe that there is
wide support in Israel for the
need to disarm Saddam Hussein.
Few [Israelis are] so naive as to be
lieve that Saddam will disarm
himself without being ousted

from power."
"Freeing the region from Sad
dam I lussein would also create the
opportunity for progress in peace
between Israelis and Palestinians,"
he added, arguing that inaction is
the greatest risk. " The last century
lias shown us what the price of
paralysis can be."
Barak then addressed the state
of affairs between Israel and Pales
tine, indicting Palestine Liberation
Organization Chairman Yasser
Arafat for walking away from the
2000 Camp David peace talks and
outlining his own views on how the
Israeli government should now
proceed to achieve peace.
In reference to the current up
swing in violence, Barak said, "In
essence, it is a Palestinian attempt
to impose upon Israel suicide
bombings as a new diplomatic tool.
Israel will never, ever yield to this
terror."
Barak also recapped the pro
posal presented to Arafat at Camp
David, contending that "this offer

was much closer to the Palestinian
demands than to the Israeli de
mands."
lie said that Arafat, whom he
derisively called Hussein's "best
friend," "walked out of the room
and deliberately and consciously
turned to this suicide bombing and

Addressing the current state of
affiiiis, Barak outlined the"three
pillars" lie thought should charac
terize Israeli foreign policy.
The first was to strike decisively
against terror iu all its forms, a pol
icy he said was already in place

"I believe that there is wide support in Israel for the
need to disarm Saddam Hussein. . . The last century
has shown us what the price of paralysis can be

terror.
"Arafat does not have the char
acter of President [Anwar] Saddat
or King Hussein [of Jordan]," he
said, arguing that Arafat's inflexi
bility and reluctance to take a con
troversial stand kept him from
making a decision that would
greatly benefit his constituents.
"Arafat on the most profound
level does not recognize I he right of
Israel to exist as a Jewish state,"he

undercurrent Israeli Prime Minis
ter Ariel Sharon.
But, he ridded, "I believe we
should have another two pillars to
our strategy that are now missing."
()ne was to "leave I he door open
for the resumption of negotiations
at any moment, with no precondi
tions except the complete absence
of violence, based on the principles
of Gamp David."
The other was to "disengage"

Israel from the Palestinians in the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip by
building a guarded fence around
Israel proper, three main settle
ment bloc ks, and a slice of the bor
der with Jordan. Stating that these
enclosed areas would comprise
"no more than 25 percent of (he
West Bank," Barak said that the
plan would c all tor the relocation
of Israeli settlers living beyond the
fence.
Barak based his support of the
fence proposal on the success of a
50-mile "pilot" fence already in
place around the Gaza Strip, and
noted that the West Bank fence
would not represent a legal or for
mal annexation of the settlement
blocks it enclosed.
" The terrorists do not know
how to cross the fence," he said,
eliciting laughter from pockets in
the audience.
Aside from saving lives, Barak
said, the* partitioning of Israel from
the bulk of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip would be a necessary

condition for maintaining a Jewish
majority in Israel.
"If there is only one political en
tity in [the land between the
Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan
Riverj, it will inevitably become ei
ther non-Jewish or non-democrat
ic," he said.
Barak reiterated the demands
that Bush has presented to Arafat
and discussed the benefits that
could result from a new Palestinian
leadership.
" The moment a different Pales
tinian leadership will emerge or
appear, I assure you within several
weeks you will see a majority of Is
raelis ready to go back to negotia
tions."
Barak concluded his speech
with a summary of his major points
and an appeal to the cause of social
justice worldwide.
"Nothing should weaken our
sense of purpose when we are
fighting with terror and evil, but we
should never lose sight of the poor
of the earth," lie said.
Emphasizing the importance of win
ning the war against terrorism, the ur
gency of ousting Iraqi President Sad
dam Hussein, and the unwillingness of
the Palestinian leadership to work to
ward peace, former Israeli Prime Minis
ter and Stanford alumnus Ehud Barak
addressed the prospects of peace in the
Middle East before a capacity crowd at
Memorial Auditorium last night.
In a speech tempered by humor but
characterized by force, Barak called on
audience members to summon the
courage and determination of the
World War II and Cold War genera
tions in the current war on terrorism.
"We are in the opening year of an
epic struggle," said Barak, who served
as the lOth prime minister of Israel
from 1999 to 2001. "Now in 2002, the
greatest challenge to our generation is
to free the world form the reign of ter
ror and deliver freedom to people
everywhere."
Barak opened his remarks by reflect
ing upon his experience at Stanford,
which he described as two of the best
years of his life.
"I feel here at home," said Barak,
who in 1979 graduated with a master's
degree in economic engineering sys

tems. "Very tew tilings that I have done
have given me so ninth delight and so
much positive response from people
around tlie* world than the tact that I
can say I'm a Stanford graduate."
The topic quickly turned to the state
of the post-Sept. 11 world, which Barak
described as "uniquely turbulent and
uncertain."
"A year after Sept. 11, it is still a time
of testing, and the toughest tests may
still lie ahead," he said.
Affirming the reality of the biologi
cal, chemical and nuclear threat posed
by terrorist groups such as al-Qaida,
Barak urged the audience to prepare
for the consequences of what he de
scribed as a long but necessary struggle.
"Many innocent civilians, as well as
people in uniform, may lose their lives
along the way, but we have to win this
first world war of the 21st century, and
we will," lie said.
"After Sept. 11, nothing about terror
t an ever be taken for granted or be seen
as inconceivable," lie said. "The choice
is clear: Destroy world terror, or be de
stroyed by it."
Barak, who served in the Israeli De
fense Force for over -U) years and is
often described as Israel's mostdecorat
ed soldier, illustrated the need for ruth
less resolve as lie recounted some of his
most memorable operations against
Palestinian militants. He told the audi

ence about a successful raid he led on a
hijacked airplane, and he described the
execution of a I lamas leader he carried
out while disguised as a female brunette
— "with everything in place," he
laughed, gesturing toward his chest.
Barak returned to the topic of the
war against terrorism and praised the
example U.S. President George W.
Bush set by striking quickly in
Afghanistan last year, an action he de
scribed as an effective deterrent.
"To the best of my judgment, the
course that has been set by the Bush ad
ministration is the right one," he said.
Barak then segued into the merits of
removing Hussein from power, stress
ing that no one can be sure when Iraq's
leader will acquire a crude nuclear
weapon.
"Previous violations of many United
Nations Security Council resolutions
provide the legitimacy to remove him
before it is too late," he said, defending
the "moral and strategic clarity" of
Bush's motives fora strike against Iraq.
Barak said any future war with Iraq
would be a"different ballgame" ifaction
was not taken against Hussein before he
acquired nuclear weapons, and he ar
gued that the United States should
quickly push fora U.N. resolution au
thorizing force if "full Iraqi compliance

In a press conference prior to

raeli public as generally supportive
of U.S. military action in Iraq. He
cited an increased ability to vacci

of anti-ballistic missile systems as

sense of purpose when we are
fighting with terror and evil, but we
should never lose sight of the poor
of the earth," lie said.
Emphasizing the importance of win
ning the war against terrorism, the ur
gency of ousting Iraqi President Sad
dam Hussein, and the unwillingness of
the Palestinian leadership to work to
ward peace, former Israeli Prime Minis
ter and Stanford alumnus Ehud Barak
addressed the prospects of peace in the
Middle East before a capacity crowd at
Memorial Auditorium last night.
In a speech tempered by humor but
characterized by force, Barak called on
audience members to summon the
courage and determination of the
World War II and Cold War genera
tions in the current war on terrorism.
"We are in the opening year of an
epic struggle," said Barak, who served
as the lOth prime minister of Israel
from 1999 to 2001. "Now in 2002, the
greatest challenge to our generation is
to free the world form the reign of ter
ror and deliver freedom to people
everywhere."
Barak opened his remarks by reflect
ing upon his experience at Stanford,
which he described as two of the best
years of his life.
"I feel here at home," said Barak,
who in 1979 graduated with a master's
degree in economic engineering sys

tems. "Very tew tilings that I have done
have given me so ninth delight and so
much positive response from people
around tlie* world than the tact that I
can say I'm a Stanford graduate."
The topic quickly turned to the state
of the post-Sept. 11 world, which Barak
described as "uniquely turbulent and
uncertain."
"A year after Sept. 11, it is still a time
of testing, and the toughest tests may
still lie ahead," he said.
Affirming the reality of the biologi
cal, chemical and nuclear threat posed
by terrorist groups such as al-Qaida,
Barak urged the audience to prepare
for the consequences of what he de
scribed as a long but necessary struggle.
"Many innocent civilians, as well as
people in uniform, may lose their lives
along the way, but we have to win this
first world war of the 21st century, and
we will," lie said.
"After Sept. 11, nothing about terror
t an ever be taken for granted or be seen
as inconceivable," lie said. "The choice
is clear: Destroy world terror, or be de
stroyed by it."
Barak, who served in the Israeli De
fense Force for over -U) years and is
often described as Israel's mostdecorat
ed soldier, illustrated the need for ruth
less resolve as lie recounted some of his
most memorable operations against
Palestinian militants. He told the audi

ence about a successful raid he led on a
hijacked airplane, and he described the
execution of a I lamas leader he carried
out while disguised as a female brunette
— "with everything in place," he
laughed, gesturing toward his chest.
Barak returned to the topic of the
war against terrorism and praised the
example U.S. President George W.
Bush set by striking quickly in
Afghanistan last year, an action he de
scribed as an effective deterrent.
"To the best of my judgment, the
course that has been set by the Bush ad
ministration is the right one," he said.
Barak then segued into the merits of
removing Hussein from power, stress
ing that no one can be sure when Iraq's
leader will acquire a crude nuclear
weapon.
"Previous violations of many United
Nations Security Council resolutions
provide the legitimacy to remove him
before it is too late," he said, defending
the "moral and strategic clarity" of
Bush's motives fora strike against Iraq.
Barak said any future war with Iraq
would be a"different ballgame" ifaction
was not taken against Hussein before he
acquired nuclear weapons, and he ar
gued that the United States should
quickly push fora U.N. resolution au
thorizing force if "full Iraqi compliance

is not forthcoming."
In a press conference prior to
his talk, Barak characterized the Is
raeli public as generally supportive
of U.S. military action in Iraq. He
cited an increased ability to vacci
nate the populace against small
pox and the further development
of anti-ballistic missile systems as
evidence that the country could ad
equately defend itself in the event
of an Iraqi offensive.
He added that, ii Iraq were to
launch a substantial attack against
Israel, it would not ref rain fiom re
sponding.
"We don't pretend it's for us to
decide, but I believe that there is
wide support in Israel for the
need to disarm Saddam Hussein.
Few [Israelis are] so naive as to be
lieve that Saddam will disarm
himself without being ousted

from power."
"Freeing the region from Sad
dam I lussein would also create the
opportunity for progress in peace
between Israelis and Palestinians,"
he added, arguing that inaction is
the greatest risk. " The last century
lias shown us what the price of
paralysis can be."
Barak then addressed the state
of affairs between Israel and Pales
tine, indicting Palestine Liberation
Organization Chairman Yasser
Arafat for walking away from the
2000 Camp David peace talks and
outlining his own views on how the
Israeli government should now
proceed to achieve peace.
In reference to the current up
swing in violence, Barak said, "In
essence, it is a Palestinian attempt
to impose upon Israel suicide
bombings as a new diplomatic tool.
Israel will never, ever yield to this
terror."
Barak also recapped the pro
posal presented to Arafat at Camp
David, contending that "this offer

was much closer to the Palestinian
demands than to the Israeli de
mands."
lie said that Arafat, whom he
derisively called Hussein's "best
friend," "walked out of the room
and deliberately and consciously
turned to this suicide bombing and

said.
Addressing the current state of
affiiiis, Barak outlined the"three
pillars" lie thought should charac
terize Israeli foreign policy.
The first was to strike decisively
against terror iu all its forms, a pol
icy he said was already in place

"I believe that there is wide support in Israel for the
need to disarm Saddam Hussein. . . The last century
has shown us what the price of paralysis can be

terror.
"Arafat does not have the char
acter of President [Anwar] Saddat
or King Hussein [of Jordan]," he
said, arguing that Arafat's inflexi
bility and reluctance to take a con
troversial stand kept him from
making a decision that would
greatly benefit his constituents.
"Arafat on the most profound
level does not recognize I he right of
Israel to exist as a Jewish state,"he

undercurrent Israeli Prime Minis
ter Ariel Sharon.
But, he ridded, "I believe we
should have another two pillars to
our strategy that are now missing."
()ne was to "leave I he door open
for the resumption of negotiations
at any moment, with no precondi
tions except the complete absence
of violence, based on the principles
of Gamp David."
The other was to "disengage"

Israel from the Palestinians in the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip by
building a guarded fence around
Israel proper, three main settle
ment bloc ks, and a slice of the bor
der with Jordan. Stating that these
enclosed areas would comprise
"no more than 25 percent of (he
West Bank," Barak said that the
plan would c all tor the relocation
of Israeli settlers living beyond the
fence.
Barak based his support of the
fence proposal on the success of a
50-mile "pilot" fence already in
place around the Gaza Strip, and
noted that the West Bank fence
would not represent a legal or for
mal annexation of the settlement
blocks it enclosed.
" The terrorists do not know
how to cross the fence," he said,
eliciting laughter from pockets in
the audience.
Aside from saving lives, Barak
said, the* partitioning of Israel from
the bulk of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip would be a necessary

condition for maintaining a Jewish
majority in Israel.
"If there is only one political en
tity in [the land between the
Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan
Riverj, it will inevitably become ei
ther non-Jewish or non-democrat
ic," he said.
Barak reiterated the demands
that Bush has presented to Arafat
and discussed the benefits that
could result from a new Palestinian
leadership.
" The moment a different Pales
tinian leadership will emerge or
appear, I assure you within several
weeks you will see a majority of Is
raelis ready to go back to negotia
tions."
Barak concluded his speech
with a summary of his major points
and an appeal to the cause of social
justice worldwide.
"Nothing should weaken our
sense of purpose when we are
fighting with terror and evil, but we
should never lose sight of the poor
of the earth," lie said.
