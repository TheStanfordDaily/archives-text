### JENNIFER GRAHAM WILL OREMUS EDITORIAL STAFF 
Emphasizing the importance of win
ning the war against terrorism, the ur
gency of ousting Iraqi President Sad
dam Hussein, and the unwillingness of
the Palestinian leadership to work to
ward peace, former Israeli Prime Minis
ter and Stanford alumnus Ehud Barak
addressed the prospects of peace in the
Middle East before a capacity crowd at
Memorial Auditorium last night.
In a speech tempered by humor but
characterized by force, Barak called on
audience members to summon the
courage and determination of the
World War II and Cold War genera
tions in the current war on terrorism.
"We are in the opening year of an
epic struggle," said Barak, who served
as the lOth prime minister of Israel
from 1999 to 2001. "Now in 2002, the
greatest challenge to our generation is
to free the world form the reign of ter
ror and deliver freedom to people
everywhere."
Barak opened his remarks by reflect
ing upon his experience at Stanford,
which he described as two of the best
years of his life.
"I feel here at home," said Barak,
who in 1979 graduated with a master's
degree in economic engineering sys

tems. "Very tew tilings that I have done
have given me so ninth delight and so
much positive response from people
around tlie* world than the tact that I
can say I'm a Stanford graduate."
The topic quickly turned to the state
of the post-Sept. 11 world, which Barak
described as "uniquely turbulent and
uncertain."
"A year after Sept. 11, it is still a time
of testing, and the toughest tests may
still lie ahead," he said.
Affirming the reality of the biologi
cal, chemical and nuclear threat posed
by terrorist groups such as al-Qaida,
Barak urged the audience to prepare
for the consequences of what he de
scribed as a long but necessary struggle.
"Many innocent civilians, as well as
people in uniform, may lose their lives
along the way, but we have to win this
first world war of the 21st century, and
we will," lie said.
"After Sept. 11, nothing about terror
t an ever be taken for granted or be seen
as inconceivable," lie said. "The choice
is clear: Destroy world terror, or be de
stroyed by it."
Barak, who served in the Israeli De
fense Force for over -U) years and is
often described as Israel's mostdecorat
ed soldier, illustrated the need for ruth
less resolve as lie recounted some of his
most memorable operations against
Palestinian militants. He told the audi

ence about a successful raid he led on a
hijacked airplane, and he described the
execution of a I lamas leader he carried
out while disguised as a female brunette
â€” "with everything in place," he
laughed, gesturing toward his chest.
Barak returned to the topic of the
war against terrorism and praised the
example U.S. President George W.
Bush set by striking quickly in
Afghanistan last year, an action he de
scribed as an effective deterrent.
"To the best of my judgment, the
course that has been set by the Bush ad
ministration is the right one," he said.
Barak then segued into the merits of
removing Hussein from power, stress
ing that no one can be sure when Iraq's
leader will acquire a crude nuclear
weapon.
"Previous violations of many United
Nations Security Council resolutions
provide the legitimacy to remove him
before it is too late," he said, defending
the "moral and strategic clarity" of
Bush's motives fora strike against Iraq.
Barak said any future war with Iraq
would be a"different ballgame" ifaction
was not taken against Hussein before he
acquired nuclear weapons, and he ar
gued that the United States should
quickly push fora U.N. resolution au
thorizing force if "full Iraqi compliance
