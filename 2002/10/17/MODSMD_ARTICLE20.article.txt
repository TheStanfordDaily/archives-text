# Climbing high
## Stanford Alpine Club Resurrected 
### DANIEL URBAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
"Your head is totally worked. Your arms twitch
like they're gonna fall off. Your fingers are cracked
and bleeding. I find it all so peaceful."
This is how one of the world's best climbers,
Tommy Caldwell, describes the paradox of his sport.
The coexistence of peace, pain and fear is just one
reason a climber might give you when asked of the
reason for his or her love affair with the sport. The
physical and mental challenges, the time with
friends, getting away from the everyday routine and
a birds-eye view of some of earth's most beautiful
scenery are others you'd likely hear.
"When I am on a climb, all other things in my life
disappear," says Dave Weaver, a Ph.D. student in
chemical engineering. "I don't think about work,
about my broken car, about girl problems. It de
mands your entire focus and attention.
"It allows you to eat lunch in ridiculous places
hundreds of feet above the ground. It puts you in
places that no one except for climbers will ever be.
You wind up going to beautiful places like Yosemite,
Kings Canyon, Joshua Tree, Pinnacles, Castle R<x k
and Needles almost every weekend."
With descriptions like this one, it's no wonder that
many Stanford students load up their work during
the week (or skip it altogether) to steal away to the
mountains for the weekend.
While climbers have always been found among

the Stanford student body, they
have often been frustrated by the
lack of an organized (limbing com
munity on campus. But this has not
always been the c ase.
In the '50s and '60s, the Stan
ford Alpine Club was an interna
tionally renowned organization of
some the world's best roc k climbers
and mountaineers.
Membership cards carried the
slogan, "Ohm- Dame, kein Ru/wi,"
((ierman lor "No guts, no glory").
I I lis was no empty boast. The
pioneering members of SAC
walked it (or climbed, rather) like
they talked it.
When they weren't putting their
flag on the pinnacle of Hoover
lower, rappelling oil the sides of
campus buildings or traversing the
sandstone walls of the Quad, Stan
lord c limbers were making first as
cents of sheer, half-mile-high gran
ite walls like Yosemite Valley's El
Capitan.
Leading with gear far inferior to
modern technology, "don't fall"
was the general rule, and the Stan
lord climbers of that era left a lega
cy of commitment, boldness and

badassed-ness.
SAC started to fade out in the
'70s and, for the past two decades,
has been virtually nonexistent.
As of this year, however, the
once-legendary Stanford Alpine
Club is being reformed, though
with no immediate goals of match
ing the boldness of its original
founders.
"One of the reasons it's taken so
long to get the club started again
has been the feeling that, 'Oh,
we're not as hard core as [the origi
nal SAC climbers] were. We'd have
so much to live up to,' " said gradu
ate student Bryan Palmintier, who
has spearheaded the effort to res
urrect SAC.
Still, the need fora collected
climbing community at Stanford
pushed Palmintier and others to
begin planning the founding of the
new SAC, despite the weight of the
previous club's glory.
While the new club may not
have the pioneering, visionary as
pect that the old SAC had, it will at
tempt to be as broad in scope.
"We want the club to be devoted
to alpinism, not necessarily just
rock climbing," Palmintier said.
"Ice climbing, big-wall climbing,
mountaineering, ski mountaineer
ing— everything will be included."
While providing a forum for

campus climbers to plan epic trips
together may be one aspect of SAC,
it is by no means its only purpose.
"Climbing isn't all about push
ing limits, but having community,
getting places and having those
experiences with friends,"
Palmintier said.
As such, SAC aims to provide
safety-focused instructional trips
for beginning climbers, as well as
progressively more advanced
workshops to help new climbers
gradually work their way into the
sport's more advanced techniques.
Additionally, the club had its
own collection of gear for every
type of climbing, not just rock, that
members can rent.
"Ice climbing, rock climbing,
mountaineering — SAC will have
gear available fora student's bud
get," Palmintier said.
Anyone interested in climbing
should drop by the ( limbing wall
(http://www.stanford.edu/group/cl
imbingwall for information),
where you'll meet campus
climbers willing to teach and intro
duce you to ( limbing outdoors on
real rock.
Students may also subscribe to
the "climbing" Stanford e-mail list
to get information on joining SAC
or to find a climbing partner for the
weekend.

With descriptions like this one, it's no wonder that
many Stanford students load up their work during
the week (or skip it altogether) to steal away to the
mountains for the weekend.

the Stanford student body, they
have often been frustrated by the
lack of an organized (limbing com
munity on campus. But this has not
always been the c ase.
In the '50s and '60s, the Stan
ford Alpine Club was an interna
tionally renowned organization of
some the world's best roc k climbers
and mountaineers.
Membership cards carried the
slogan, "Ohm- Dame, kein Ru/wi,"
((ierman lor "No guts, no glory").
I I lis was no empty boast. The
pioneering members of SAC
walked it (or climbed, rather) like
they talked it.
When they weren't putting their
flag on the pinnacle of Hoover
lower, rappelling oil the sides of
campus buildings or traversing the
sandstone walls of the Quad, Stan
lord c limbers were making first as
cents of sheer, half-mile-high gran
ite walls like Yosemite Valley's El
Capitan.
Leading with gear far inferior to
modern technology, "don't fall"
was the general rule, and the Stan
lord climbers of that era left a lega
cy of commitment, boldness and

badassed-ness.
SAC started to fade out in the
'70s and, for the past two decades,
has been virtually nonexistent.
As of this year, however, the
once-legendary Stanford Alpine
Club is being reformed, though
with no immediate goals of match
ing the boldness of its original
founders.
"One of the reasons it's taken so
long to get the club started again
has been the feeling that, 'Oh,
we're not as hard core as [the origi
nal SAC climbers] were. We'd have
so much to live up to,' " said gradu
ate student Bryan Palmintier, who
has spearheaded the effort to res
urrect SAC.
Still, the need fora collected
climbing community at Stanford
pushed Palmintier and others to
begin planning the founding of the
new SAC, despite the weight of the
previous club's glory.
While the new club may not
have the pioneering, visionary as
pect that the old SAC had, it will at
tempt to be as broad in scope.
"We want the club to be devoted
to alpinism, not necessarily just
rock climbing," Palmintier said.
"Ice climbing, big-wall climbing,
mountaineering, ski mountaineer
ing— everything will be included."
While providing a forum for

campus climbers to plan epic trips
together may be one aspect of SAC,
it is by no means its only purpose.
"Climbing isn't all about push
ing limits, but having community,
getting places and having those
experiences with friends,"
Palmintier said.
As such, SAC aims to provide
safety-focused instructional trips
for beginning climbers, as well as
progressively more advanced
workshops to help new climbers
gradually work their way into the
sport's more advanced techniques.
Additionally, the club had its
own collection of gear for every
type of climbing, not just rock, that
members can rent.
"Ice climbing, rock climbing,
mountaineering — SAC will have
gear available fora student's bud
get," Palmintier said.
Anyone interested in climbing
should drop by the ( limbing wall
(http://www.stanford.edu/group/cl
imbingwall for information),
where you'll meet campus
climbers willing to teach and intro
duce you to ( limbing outdoors on
real rock.

to get information on joining SAC
or to find a climbing partner for the
weekend.
"Your head is totally worked. Your arms twitch
like they're gonna fall off. Your fingers are cracked
and bleeding. I find it all so peaceful."
This is how one of the world's best climbers,
Tommy Caldwell, describes the paradox of his sport.
The coexistence of peace, pain and fear is just one
reason a climber might give you when asked of the
reason for his or her love affair with the sport. The
physical and mental challenges, the time with
friends, getting away from the everyday routine and
a birds-eye view of some of earth's most beautiful
scenery are others you'd likely hear.
"When I am on a climb, all other things in my life
disappear," says Dave Weaver, a Ph.D. student in
chemical engineering. "I don't think about work,
about my broken car, about girl problems. It de
mands your entire focus and attention.
"It allows you to eat lunch in ridiculous places
hundreds of feet above the ground. It puts you in
places that no one except for climbers will ever be.
You wind up going to beautiful places like Yosemite,
Kings Canyon, Joshua Tree, Pinnacles, Castle R<x k
and Needles almost every weekend."
