"Your head is totally worked. Your arms twitch
like they're gonna fall off. Your fingers are cracked

a birds-eye view of some of earth's most beautiful
scenery are others you'd likely hear.
"When I am on a climb, all other things in my life
disappear," says Dave Weaver, a Ph.D. student in
chemical engineering. "I don't think about work,
about my broken car, about girl problems. It de
mands your entire focus and attention.
"It allows you to eat lunch in ridiculous places
hundreds of feet above the ground. It puts you in
places that no one except for climbers will ever be.
You wind up going to beautiful places like Yosemite,
Kings Canyon, Joshua Tree, Pinnacles, Castle R<x k

many Stanford students load up their work during
the week (or skip it altogether) to steal away to the
mountains for the weekend.
