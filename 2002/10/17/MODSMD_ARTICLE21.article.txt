# Quarterback let off easy; setter shafted

### ROBIN WASHUT DAILY NEBRASKAN 
(U-WIRE) LINCOLN, Neb. —
Last Saturday night ended with
misdemeanor charges for two Ne
braska star athletes, but the pun
ishments announced at the Tues
day press conferences differed
drastically.
After volleyball setter Gre
ichaly Cepero and football quar
terback Janimal Lord were ticket
ed for disturbing the peace and
taken to Cornhusker Place Detox
ification Center, both face con
trasting consequences.
Nebraska volleyball coach John
Cook announced Tuesday that
Cepero would be suspended from
the team indefinitely, while Lord
was cleared to start Saturday against
Oklahoma State by football coach
Frank Solich.
Cepero, however, also re
ceived a citation for failure to
comply Saturday.
But even with Cepero's addi
tional charge, the question of why
only one of the athletes was sus
pended is still left glaring.
(]ook said the incident was teach

ing lessons more valuable than win
ning or losing.
"It is about the standards which
have been set about Nebraska vol
leyball. 1 have a responsibility to
keep it at that level," Cook said.
(lepero will not step on the court
again until C<x>k "is confident she
understands the result of her ac
tions and is ready to move forward
and uphold the standards of Ne
braska volleyball."
As for Solich and the football
program, the decision not to sus
pend Lord came down to a matter
of personal opinion and points.
A five-point penalty system es
tablished by the team's Unity Coun
cil played a major role in choosing
Lord's fate. When a player accrues
live points during a season, it war
rants an automatic suspension.
According to Solich, Lord's viola
tion wasn't enough to keep him off
the field on Saturday.
"[animal handled himself in a
manner that no other tickets or any
thing else was done, as far as the law
officers are concerned," Solich said,
"fie has been put under some
guidelines that are within the inter
nal part of our football operations.
"Along with the internal guide
lines, he will also be involved in
some support systems that are
available to him, and it will be
mandatory that he attend those

support systems.
Lord's programs were left un
specified but Cook said Cepero will
attend a pre-trial diversion course.
Last Saturday's incident marks
the first time Cepero has been cited
while residing in Lincoln.
For Lord, though, it's not the first
time the junior from Bayonne, N.J.,
has had a run-in with the law, ac
cording to Lincoln Police Depart
ment records.

Lord was convicted of public uri
nation in May 2001 and was con
victed of attempting to purchase al
cohol as a minora month later.
In December 2001, lord was ar
rested as a minor for driving with a
blood alcohol content above .02.
Although there were no official
meetings between the two coaches,
Cook said there was comnumicat ion
while evaluating tin* situations.
The final reactions, which were

distinct Tuesday, differ heavily lx--
tween the programs.
Cook used words such as "crisis"
and "unacceptable" in describing
(lepero's situation. Solic h, however,
carried himself with a more busi
ness-like demeanor.
As (brother members of the f<>ot
ball team, there seemed to be a con
sensus of confusion as to what all the
fuss was about.
"We as football players prefer

that players don't drink during the
season, hut we'd be hypocrites by
saying we don't drink," senior kick
er Josh Brown said. "There's a con
stant eye on your back at all times.
You have to watch how you act at
school, at work, everywhere.
"It's really no different from Joe
Blow doing it. It's just that we're
l(K)tball players."
Regardless of the punishments,
both Lord, Cepero and their re

spective programs were alfected by
last Saturday's events.
The volleyball team loses ar
guably the Ix'st setter in the country
for an indefinite amount of matches,
while the fixrtball team once again
goes under scrutiny for its players'
actions.
In either case, both of the pro
grams are left trying to recover in
their own way from that fateful
night.

ing lessons more valuable than win
ning or losing.
"It is about the standards which
have been set about Nebraska vol
leyball. 1 have a responsibility to
keep it at that level," Cook said.
(lepero will not step on the court
again until C<x>k "is confident she
understands the result of her ac
tions and is ready to move forward
and uphold the standards of Ne
braska volleyball."
As for Solich and the football
program, the decision not to sus
pend Lord came down to a matter
of personal opinion and points.
A five-point penalty system es
tablished by the team's Unity Coun
cil played a major role in choosing
Lord's fate. When a player accrues
live points during a season, it war
rants an automatic suspension.
According to Solich, Lord's viola
tion wasn't enough to keep him off
the field on Saturday.
"[animal handled himself in a
manner that no other tickets or any
thing else was done, as far as the law
officers are concerned," Solich said,
"fie has been put under some
guidelines that are within the inter
nal part of our football operations.
"Along with the internal guide
lines, he will also be involved in
some support systems that are
available to him, and it will be
mandatory that he attend those

support systems.
Lord's programs were left un
specified but Cook said Cepero will
attend a pre-trial diversion course.
Last Saturday's incident marks
the first time Cepero has been cited
while residing in Lincoln.
For Lord, though, it's not the first
time the junior from Bayonne, N.J.,
has had a run-in with the law, ac
cording to Lincoln Police Depart
ment records.

Lord was convicted of public uri
nation in May 2001 and was con
victed of attempting to purchase al
cohol as a minora month later.
In December 2001, lord was ar
rested as a minor for driving with a
blood alcohol content above .02.
Although there were no official
meetings between the two coaches,
Cook said there was comnumicat ion
while evaluating tin* situations.
The final reactions, which were

distinct Tuesday, differ heavily lx--
tween the programs.
Cook used words such as "crisis"
and "unacceptable" in describing
(lepero's situation. Solic h, however,
carried himself with a more busi
ness-like demeanor.
As (brother members of the f<>ot
ball team, there seemed to be a con
sensus of confusion as to what all the
fuss was about.
"We as football players prefer

that players don't drink during the
season, hut we'd be hypocrites by
saying we don't drink," senior kick
er Josh Brown said. "There's a con
stant eye on your back at all times.
You have to watch how you act at
school, at work, everywhere.
"It's really no different from Joe
Blow doing it. It's just that we're
l(K)tball players."
Regardless of the punishments,
both Lord, Cepero and their re

spective programs were alfected by
last Saturday's events.
The volleyball team loses ar
guably the Ix'st setter in the country
for an indefinite amount of matches,
while the fixrtball team once again
goes under scrutiny for its players'
actions.
In either case, both of the pro
grams are left trying to recover in
their own way from that fateful
night.
