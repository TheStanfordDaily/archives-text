						Talk with Barak 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Among his supporters, Ehud Barak is known as a
revered military commander and a former Israeli
prime minister who conceded more than most would
ever contemplate in trying to strike a peace treaty with
the Palestinians.
But Barak, an Israeli who joined the military while
still a teenager and ultimately served for over 30 years,
also spent several years of his life in academia — first as
a student at Hebrew University and later as a graduate
student at Stanford.
In a 20-minute interview yesterday evening before
his address to the University, Barak spoke about his ex
perience at Stanford, how his studies affected his career
as a military leader and prime minister, and how stu
dents and universities can affect policy and peace in the
Middle East.
An emphasis on decision-making
Though Barak had spent the bulk of his education
focusing on mathematics and science, he was looking
for more flexibility in a graduate program to pursue his
new interest: decision-making.
After being accepted by Harvard, MIT, Yale and
Stanford, Barak chose Stanford because of the flexibili
ty it gave him in accommodating his academic interests.
In 1973, he enrolled in Stanford as a masters student
in economic engineering systems — what is now called
management science and engineering.
"They allowed us to look over the walls of the school
of engineering, and they allowed me to take about al
most half of my hours almost wherever I wanted to," he
said. "I could study everything. I found it more stimu
lating to be able to take courses wherever I wanted when
my focus was decision-making."
He added, " The Hoover Institute, the Business
School — I got courses in everyone of them."
Only a few weeks after arriving on campus, Barak re
turned to Israel to serve in the military during the Yom
Kippur War. Afterwards, he returned to Stanford's Es
condido Village, or "Kibbutz Escondido" as he called it,
with his wife and two daughters in the late 1970s and
completed his degree in 1979.
Life after the Farm
Despite being elected prime minister of Israel in
1999, Barak said that he didn't always have his mind set
on getting involved in politics.
"I didn't think in such long-term [goals] at the time,"
he said. "It was not something that was a grand plan, to
become prime minister or something like this."
