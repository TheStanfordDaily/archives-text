## A 						Talk with Barak 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Among his supporters, Ehud Barak is known as a
revered military commander and a former Israeli
prime minister who conceded more than most would
ever contemplate in trying to strike a peace treaty with
the Palestinians.
But Barak, an Israeli who joined the military while
still a teenager and ultimately served for over 30 years,
also spent several years of his life in academia — first as
a student at Hebrew University and later as a graduate
student at Stanford.
In a 20-minute interview yesterday evening before
his address to the University, Barak spoke about his ex
perience at Stanford, how his studies affected his career
as a military leader and prime minister, and how stu
dents and universities can affect policy and peace in the
Middle East.
An emphasis on decision-making
Though Barak had spent the bulk of his education
focusing on mathematics and science, he was looking
for more flexibility in a graduate program to pursue his
new interest: decision-making.
After being accepted by Harvard, MIT, Yale and
Stanford, Barak chose Stanford because of the flexibili
ty it gave him in accommodating his academic interests.
In 1973, he enrolled in Stanford as a masters student
in economic engineering systems — what is now called
management science and engineering.
"They allowed us to look over the walls of the school
of engineering, and they allowed me to take about al
most half of my hours almost wherever I wanted to," he
said. "I could study everything. I found it more stimu
lating to be able to take courses wherever I wanted when
my focus was decision-making."
He added, " The Hoover Institute, the Business
School — I got courses in everyone of them."
Only a few weeks after arriving on campus, Barak re
turned to Israel to serve in the military during the Yom
Kippur War. Afterwards, he returned to Stanford's Es
condido Village, or "Kibbutz Escondido" as he called it,
with his wife and two daughters in the late 1970s and
completed his degree in 1979.
Life after the Farm
Despite being elected prime minister of Israel in
1999, Barak said that he didn't always have his mind set
on getting involved in politics.
"I didn't think in such long-term [goals] at the time,"
he said. "It was not something that was a grand plan, to
become prime minister or something like this."

Alter graduating, he continued
to ascend the ranks of the Israeli De
fense Forces as a military comman
der, which initially seemed re
moved from his studies at Stanford.
"At the time, I was in uniform —
[what I studied] was hardly some
thing to do with the activities that
I ve done as a military commander."

the head of the IDF's planning
branch and later of IDF intelligence,

he had been taught at Stanford.
on, when 1 came to head
our planning branch and to [man
age] the budget of billions and orga
nizations with hundreds of thou
sands of people, 1 found it very use
liil," he said.
The role of the university
Though Barak ultimately left his
mark on the world not through
academia but rather through the
military and politics, he said that he
considers universities to be at the
forefront of international leader
ship.
"Somehow, the university is the
place where the leadership of the fu
ture in all areas of life is formed," he

said. "Since the best and the bright
est are coming through ... these in
stitutions, they have a great influ
ence on the leadership oi this nation
and nations as a whole."
Students and peace
Citing the important role of uni
versities in influencing history,
Barak urged students to engage in
constructive dialogue to help fur
ther the peace process.
"I believe that you have to study
well to prepare yourself for the fu
ture," he said. "At the same time, to
be aware, to be interested, and to ex
press your voice."
He added, "Open dialogue
needs an open mindset, a readiness
to study the facts and to try to shape
a position or two out of knowledge,
not out of superstitious thinking or
wishful thinking."
Barak called on Jewish and Is
raeli students in the United States to
educate Americans.
"There is a lot of work, I believe,
to do just to inform — not to impart
individual judgment — but to try to
inform people about what really un
derlies this conflict and why Israel is
doing what we're doing."
'It's about the truth'
Barak said he felt that senti
ment in the United States was
more supportive of Israel than it

was in Europe and other areas of
the world, despite movements at
some American universities to
begin divestment campaigns and
sever ties with Israeli academics in
protest of Israeli policies.
However, Barak said that the
strength of American solidarity
may have slightly waned over the
years.
"Even among students in Ameri
ca, maybe [they're] not as support
ive as [they were] after the Six Day
War," he said.
He also questioned the divest
ment campaigns, arguing that
those behind them failed to see the
truth of the situation in the Middle
East.
"[One] needs especially distort
ed glasses to see Israel as the source
of the problem in the Middle East,"
Barak said, emphasizing that de
spite his eflorts, he was unable to
reach a settlement with the Pales
tinians. "It takes two to tango —
you can impose war but you cannot
impose peace."
He added, "1 believe that we do
not need more than the truth.
There is no need for brainwashing
or indoctrination; it's about the
truth —just telling the truth and
conveying the truth, pulling off the
veil of half-truths and smoke
screens and lies that some of our
neighbors spread around."

The role of the university
Though Barak ultimately left his
mark on the world not through
academia but rather through the
military and politics, he said that he
considers universities to be at the
forefront of international leader
ship.
"Somehow, the university is the
place where the leadership of the fu
ture in all areas of life is formed," he

said. "Since the best and the bright
est are coming through ... these in
stitutions, they have a great influ
ence on the leadership oi this nation
and nations as a whole."
Students and peace
Citing the important role of uni
versities in influencing history,
Barak urged students to engage in
constructive dialogue to help fur
ther the peace process.
"I believe that you have to study
well to prepare yourself for the fu
ture," he said. "At the same time, to
be aware, to be interested, and to ex
press your voice."
He added, "Open dialogue
needs an open mindset, a readiness
to study the facts and to try to shape
a position or two out of knowledge,
not out of superstitious thinking or
wishful thinking."
Barak called on Jewish and Is
raeli students in the United States to
educate Americans.
"There is a lot of work, I believe,
to do just to inform — not to impart
individual judgment — but to try to
inform people about what really un
derlies this conflict and why Israel is
doing what we're doing."
'It's about the truth'
Barak said he felt that senti
ment in the United States was
more supportive of Israel than it

was in Europe and other areas of
the world, despite movements at
some American universities to
begin divestment campaigns and
sever ties with Israeli academics in
protest of Israeli policies.
However, Barak said that the
strength of American solidarity
may have slightly waned over the
years.
"Even among students in Ameri
ca, maybe [they're] not as support
ive as [they were] after the Six Day
War," he said.
He also questioned the divest
ment campaigns, arguing that
those behind them failed to see the
truth of the situation in the Middle
East.
"[One] needs especially distort
ed glasses to see Israel as the source
of the problem in the Middle East,"
Barak said, emphasizing that de
spite his eflorts, he was unable to
reach a settlement with the Pales
tinians. "It takes two to tango —
you can impose war but you cannot
impose peace."
He added, "1 believe that we do
not need more than the truth.
There is no need for brainwashing
or indoctrination; it's about the
truth —just telling the truth and
conveying the truth, pulling off the
veil of half-truths and smoke
screens and lies that some of our
neighbors spread around."
Among his supporters, Ehud Barak is known as a
revered military commander and a former Israeli
prime minister who conceded more than most would
ever contemplate in trying to strike a peace treaty with
the Palestinians.
But Barak, an Israeli who joined the military while
still a teenager and ultimately served for over 30 years,
also spent several years of his life in academia — first as
a student at Hebrew University and later as a graduate
student at Stanford.
In a 20-minute interview yesterday evening before
his address to the University, Barak spoke about his ex
perience at Stanford, how his studies affected his career
as a military leader and prime minister, and how stu
dents and universities can affect policy and peace in the
Middle East.
An emphasis on decision-making
Though Barak had spent the bulk of his education
focusing on mathematics and science, he was looking
for more flexibility in a graduate program to pursue his
new interest: decision-making.
After being accepted by Harvard, MIT, Yale and
Stanford, Barak chose Stanford because of the flexibili
ty it gave him in accommodating his academic interests.
In 1973, he enrolled in Stanford as a masters student
in economic engineering systems — what is now called
management science and engineering.
"They allowed us to look over the walls of the school
of engineering, and they allowed me to take about al
most half of my hours almost wherever I wanted to," he
said. "I could study everything. I found it more stimu
lating to be able to take courses wherever I wanted when
my focus was decision-making."
He added, " The Hoover Institute, the Business
School — I got courses in everyone of them."
Only a few weeks after arriving on campus, Barak re
turned to Israel to serve in the military during the Yom
Kippur War. Afterwards, he returned to Stanford's Es
condido Village, or "Kibbutz Escondido" as he called it,
with his wife and two daughters in the late 1970s and
completed his degree in 1979.
Life after the Farm
Despite being elected prime minister of Israel in
1999, Barak said that he didn't always have his mind set
on getting involved in politics.
"I didn't think in such long-term [goals] at the time,"
he said. "It was not something that was a grand plan, to
become prime minister or something like this."

Alter graduating, he continued
to ascend the ranks of the Israeli De
fense Forces as a military comman
der, which initially seemed re
moved from his studies at Stanford.
