Stanford community mem
bers will have the opportunity to
view undergraduate students
presenting their research pro
jects during the Symposium of
Undergraduate Research in
Progress, which will be held
today at 3:15 p.m. at the Arrillaga
Alumni Center. The event is the
first of its type in the University's
history.
Students, faculty and alumni
are encouraged to attend the
symposium, which is being spon
sored by the Undergraduate Re
search Programs office and the

Office of the Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education. There
will be 119 presenters at the sym
posium — 17 sophomores, 39 ju
niors, 58 seniors and 5 co-termi
nal students.
According to Laura Selznick,
associate director for student ser
vices, a broad spectrum of re
search projects will be presented
at the symposium.
"There is everything from a
guy who was writing a novel
about Venice to a person who
writing about how terrorism is
portrayed to someone who did a
project on dowry in South
India," Selznick said. "[The sym
posium] is something we have
thought about fora long time. No
one person could get the credit

for i(. It is something I know that
I have had in the back of my
mind — we mentioned in a meet
ing with the Development Office
a couple of years ago."
Ellen Woods, the interim direc
tor of the URP office, explained
what she would like participants
to gain from the symposium.
"For all student researchers
who are presenting their projects
as posters or on panels, I hope
that these students improve their

abilities to communicate (lie ex
citement of scholarship to a wider
audience than their research
group or fellow honors students
and enjoy the experience of shar
ing their work with others,"
Woods said.
Woods also explained that she
hopes the symposium will also
serve to motivate student atten
dees by leading other under
graduates to start research pro
jects of their own.
Jason I lom, a sophomore, dis
cussed what he will he presenting
at the symposium.
"My project is about the dorsal
basal ganglia, a part of the brain

that is involved in memory, cog
nition, learning and, most specif
ically, movement sequencing,"
I lom said. "I think it isexcitingto
participate in this symposium,
because we all can learn about re
search in a wide variety of scien
tific and non-scientific fields."
Selznick explained that prepa
rations for the symposium began
as early as July.
"We made this whole planning
thing like a space launch . . . and
worked out everything far in ad
vance," Selznick said. "It is a nice
example of different offices
working together for the benefit
of t he undergraduates."
