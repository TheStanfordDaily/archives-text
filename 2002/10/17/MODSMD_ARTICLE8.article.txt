## U.S. President George W. Bush signs Iraq war resolution 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” President
Bush yesterday signed a congressional res
olution authorizing war against Iraq, and
told Prime Minister Ariel Sharon that Is
rael has a right to retaliate if Saddam I lus
sein strikes his nation now without provo
cation. In Iraq, Saddam Hussein won a
referendum extending his power lor an
other seven years.
"II Iraq attacks Israel tomorrow, I
would assume the prime minister would
respond," Bush said in remarks that creat

ed confusion about his expectations lor Is
rael if America goes to war. "I le's got a de
sire to defend himself."
In a flurry of activity, Bush tried to use
Sharon's visit and the vote of support in
Congress to ease opposition at the United
Nations fora tough new anti-Iraq resolu
tion. He warned France, Russia, China
and other balking allies that Saddam poses
a grave threat to their security.
" Those who choose to live in denial
may eventually be forced to live in fear,"

the president said as the United Nations
opened two days of contentious debate
over his Iraqi plans. In an East Room cer
emony to sign the war-making resolu
tion, Bush also said it's time to "fully and
finally" disarm Iraq and remove Saddam
from power.
Alter a lengthy meeting with Sharon,
the president was asked whether he
wanted Israel to refrain from retaliating
if Iraq attacks in response to a U.S.-led
war. Bush's father persuaded Israel to

hold its lire during the 1991 Persian
Gulf War.
Sidestepping the question, Bush said,
"First of all, I have told the prime minister
that my hope is that we could achieve dis
armament of the Iraq regime peacefully."
On a follow-up question, Bush seemed
to limit the discussion to the consequences
of an immediate, unprovoked attack by
Saddam. "If Iraq were to attack Israel to
morrow, I'm sure there would be an ap
propriate response," he said.

White House officials hastily tried to
clarify Bush's remarks, saying lie was not
giving Israel a green light to retaliate if
Iraq attacks in response to U.S. action.
Bush assured Sharon that he would get
sufficient warning il tlie U.S. were to attack
Iraq, and said America would do every
thing it could to prevent an Iraqi attack on
Israel, the Israeli official said.
II Israel were struck by Iraq, Sharon's
government would have a right to defend
the nation, the Israeli said.
