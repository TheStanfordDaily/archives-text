## The 						Stanford Daily Int'l studies planners should seek outside input 
### 
Published Since J 891

When die University presented a
pair of initiatives last week to
strengthen its international stud
ies program, Prof. David Hol
loway acknowledged the flaws of Stanford's ex
isting curriculum. We agree with Holloway
that the program could use an update — and
we fully support Stanford's efforts to expand
course offerings and encourage collaboration
between schools and departments.
In the past year, Stanford students have be
come increasingly interested in learning
about the world outside of the campus "bub
ble" — and beyond that, outside of the United
States. But demand has far outweighed sup
ply, in terms of courses offered. Even under
graduates majoring in international relations
experience difficulties being accepted into
classes. Often, as many as 50 students show up
in a classroom on the first day, only to be told

that just 12 students will be accepted into the
class. Broadening the international relations
program will not only widen the range of
courses offered, it will also allow students a
chance to take courses in areas that truly in
terest them, rather than simply enrolling in
the courses that are less popular and therefore
more accessible.
However, while an impressive roster of fac
ulty members comprises the steering commit
tee in charge of expanding course offerings, it
represents quite a narrow range of interests
— the seven-person group includes neither a
member with a non-international studies-re
lated major, nor a student representative. In
fact, almost every faculty member on the com
mittee is already involved in some kind of in
ternationally oriented field.
This, in itself, is not surprising. It makes
sense that those who are most invested in the

existing program are most likely to be interest
ed in strengthening it. We appreciate their
commitment to international fields and harbor
no doubts about each member's expertise in
his or her area of study.
But given its stated objective of encouraging
interdisciplinary courses, we urge the Univer
sity to seek considerable input from outside the
international studies circle when planning and
implementing the program. How might an en
gineering course integrate international stud
ies, for example? What about the English De
partment? Or the Department of Communica
tion? The best way to find out is by asking fac
ulty from each of these programs.
We also encourage the University to involve
students in the process — and not just those
students who are already involved in interna
tional studies. The University's goal of ex
panding the program beyond the standard

history / political science / economics triad is

the committee should focus on collecting input
from a diverse group of students specializing
in a variety of fields.
In planning the creation of the Islamic stud
ies program, its architects contacted students
from various community groups for input. We
hope the international studies steering com
mittee takes a similar approach — perhaps al
lowing students an even more involved role, by
holding student forums and discussions.
International studies should be part of
every student's curriculum, and this will only
be made possible if faculty and students from
all areas of study collaborate to make the pro
gram truly interdisciplinary. We fully support
the initiatives to enhance the program and en
courage the steering committee to take every
step necessary to make it work.
