"A romantic comedy as wonderful as it is
strange that expands the genre to its
absurdist outer limits and makes
us believe..."
Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times
"Two thumbs up!'
Ebert & Roeper
Boogie Nights' and Magnolia'
auteur Paul Thomas Anderson
saw something most critics
missed in Adam Sandler.
Better yet, he brings it
out onscreen...Sandler can
act, beautifully. That's that."
Peter Travers, Rolling Stone
"Adam Sandler is absolutely
perfect...Emily Watson is
sublime. 'Punch-Drunk Love'
is an extraordinary experience."

"Punch-Drunk Love' is sweet and strange
with an ending whose heart-melting
sincerity had several tough critics
(including this one) in tears."
A O. Scott, The New York Times
"Amazing!'
Oavirl Arisen, Newsweek
"A wickedly funny black comedy."
Jack Mathews, New York Daily News
"Punch-Drunk Love' is not only
one of the edgiest romantic
comedies ever made, it's a
romantic comedy on the edge:
on the edge of being a comedy,
on the edge of being romantic,
on the edge of sanity
and on the edge - the leading
one - of American movies
themselves."
Geoff Pevere, The Toronto Star
