Baraka to talk about 'Arts and Activism'
Poet/playwright Amiri Baraka will speak at Kresge Auditorium
tonight at 8 p.m. in a talk entitled "Aits and Activism," presented by the
Committee on Black Performing Aits.
Baraka, a celebrated writer and political activist who was recently
named to a two-year term as New Jersey's poet laureate, stirred con
troversy with "Somebody Blew Up America,"a poem he read at a
New Jersey poetry festival in August. The poem implied that Israel
knew about the Sept. 11 attacks in advance. After he recited the
poem, New Jersey Gov. James E. McGreevey and other have called
for Baraka's resignation.
An American dramatist, poet and novelist who has explored the ex
perience and anger of African Americans, Baraka has used his writ
ings as a weapon against racism and later to advocate scientific social
ism. Originally called Everett Le√üoi Jones, Baraka changed his name
in 1968.
CUE comes close to raising $1 billion after three
years
University President John Hennessy recently announced that the
Campaign for Undergraduate Education at Stanford, the fundraising
campaign that was born two years ago, has already raised $795 million
of its $1 billion goal.
"Although we face a challenging economy, given the momentum that
we have and the remarkable enthusiasm for these programs, I'm confi
dent that we can reach our goal of $ 1 billion and ensure that we will have
the endowment that we need," Hennessy said. "The response of our
alumni and supporters to the campaign has been simply extraordinary."
With the goal of $1 million just around the corner, Stanford has al
ready experienced the benefits of this fundraising campaign through
support in programs including the Introduction to the Humanities,
Sophomore College and Freshman/Sophomore College.
Moreover, 114 new need-based scholarship funds and 64 athletic
scholarship funds amounting to $215 million have been formed. The
donations have also gone toward new professorships in the School of
Humanities and Sciences, the School of Engineering and the School of
Earth Sciences.
Bass and Morgridge elected to Board of Trustees
Robert M. Bass, founder and president of Keystone Inc., and John P.
Morgridge, chairman of Cisco Systems, were elected to Stanford's Board
of Trustees at the board's first meeting on Oct. 15.
Both new trustees have many years of involvement with the Stanford
community dating back to their respective student days at the business
school. Morgridge (MBA '57), a part-time lecturer at the Graduate
School of Business, has served on the Business School Advisory Council
since 1992 and is a current member of the John Gardner Center Advi
sory Board.
Bass (MBA '74), currently chair and a founding member of the Stan
ford Management Company Board of Directors, previously served on
the University's Board of Trustees from 1989 to 2000, including as chair
from 1996 to 2000.
"Robert Bass has for many years made a tremendous contribution
to Stanford and particularly our Board of Trustees," said Isaac Stein,
current chairman of the board. "As chairman of the board, [Bass] led
the presidential succession process that welcomed [University Presi
dent] John Hennessy into that office. We warmly welcome Bob back to
the board."
