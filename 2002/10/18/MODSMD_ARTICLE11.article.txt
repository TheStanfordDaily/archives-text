## N. Korea-U.S. pact doomed from start 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —Almost as
soon as North Korea averted war with the
United States in 1994 by pledging not to
develop nuclear weapons, there were
signs it was abrogating the agreement —
a deception it has now acknowledged to
U.S. diplomats.
Kim Jong IPs caginess from the outset
immediately aroused the suspicions of
U.S. intelligence agencies, which began
tracking questionable purchases and mil
itary maneuvers by the world's last Stalin
ist redoubt.
By the beginning of this year, the Unit
ed States believed at least two nuclear
weapons had probably been built; in July,
the paper trail ended with purchase or
ders fora program to enrich uranium.
In a dramatic two-day encounter earli
er this month, a top U.S. diplomat con
fronted the North Koreans with the evi
dence. After a day of vehement denials,
the North Koreans about-faced with defi

ant acknowledgment: Yes, they had a nu
clear capability — and more.
The revelation recalled the dark days
of 1993, when Kim's father, longtime
strongman Kim Sung-11, stunned, the
world by quitting the Nuclear Nonprolif
eration Treaty.
The recalcitrant leader's already abun
dant paranoia had been fed by the col
lapse of the Iron Curtain and China's in
creasing flirtations with the West: He ap
parently wanted to prove his nation could
stand alone, or at least take others down.
His threat led to months of escalating
tension, and the Clinton administration
even considered precision airstrikes — a
possible precursor to another all-out war of
the kind that consumed the Koreas from
1950-53 — if the North didn't back down.
Fate stepped in on July 8, 1994, when
the elder Kim died of a massive heart at
tack. His son gradually assumed power
and appeared to lean toward conciliation.

On Oct. 21 of that year, U.S. and North
Korean negotiators signed the "Agreed
Framework." North Korea's nuclear
weapons program would be frozen, and
the West would help Kim Jong II pull his
people out of near-stai"vation-level poverty.
The heart of the deal was a pair of mod
ern nuclear reactors that would use non
weapons-grade radioactive materials.
Mistrust dogged the accord almost
from the beginning, when U.S. intelli
gence found that the earlier threat to
begin" weapons development was itself
a feint. A nuclear weapons program had
been in place since at least the 1980s,
when North Korea had purchased
enough plutonium for two bombs.
Soon evidence began to accumulate
suggesting that North Korean scientists
were building the bombs to house the ex
isting plutonium, according to Leonard
Spector of the Monterey Center for Non
proliferation Studies.
