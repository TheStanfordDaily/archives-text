# CIA document reveals Sept. 11 details

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — A written
statement, declassified yesterday, from
CIA Director George J. Tenet provides
new insight into al-Qaida's preparations
for Sept. 11 attacks. Some of its conclusions:
In 1996, Osama bin Laden's second
in-command, Mohammed Atef, studied
the feasibility of hijacking U.S. planes and
destroying them in flight. Tenet suggest-

Ed he may have been inspired by the 1995
plot to crash a plane into CIA headquar
ters. The CIA only learned this after Sept.
11. Atef was killed in a U.S. airstrike last
November.
A top al-Qaida operative, known as
Mukthar or Khalid Shaikh Mohammed,
has been linked to planning both the
Sept. 11 plot and the 1995 plot to crash a

plane into CIA headquarters. He's also
linked to a key plotter of the 1993 World
Trade Center bombing.
Planning for the attacks began three
years before Sept. 11.
When one bin Laden associate pro
posed crashing a small plane, packed
with explosives, into the World Trade
Center, bin Laden himself suggested
using larger planes, according to reports
received by the CIA.
The three members of the Hamburg,
Germany-based cell who became Sept. 11
hijackers — Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-
Shehhi and Ziad Jarrah — were recruited
by Mohammed Haydar Zammar, a Syri
an al-Qaida associate in Hamburg. He is
now in Syrian custody.
Those three were probably brought
into the plot during a trip to Afghanistan
in late 1999. They, and the other hijack
ers, were selected by Atef.
The CIA has evidence that 18 of the 19
hijackers were in Afghanistan in the years
before the attacks, but U.S. intelligence
had associated only two with al-Qaida be
fore Sept. 11.
Those two veteran al-Qaida operatives,
Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi,
may have been in the United States on an
other mission before being brought into
the Sept. 11 plot in April 2000.
The CIA has no evidence confirming
that Atta met with an Iraqi intelligence
agent in Prague in April 2001, as some
have alleged.
