# Md. police say lead on sniper was inaccurate

ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) â€” A witness
who says he saw the Washington-area
sniper fire with an assault rifle and flee in
a cream-colored van gave a phony story,
investigators said yesterday in a setback
that casts doubt on much of what the
public thought it knew about the roving
killer.
Prosecutors are investigating the wit
ness, whose name wasn't released, to de
termine whether he should be charged
with filing a false statement.
Fairfax County police Lt. Amy Lubas
said the inaccurate account didn't match
that of other witnesses to Monday night's
killing of an FBI cyberterrorism analyst
in a crowded Virginia parking lot outside
a Home Depot. It was the only shooting
so far that people actually saw.
Asked if the witness intentionally mis
led investigators with his description of a
cream-colored van and a burned-out
rear taillight, Montgomery County Po
lice Chief Charles Moose, who is heading
the investigation, said simply, "Yes."
Investigators were optimistic after the
latest attack seemed to yield the best de
tails yet about the killer. But that gave
way to anger yesterday.
While Moose did not give the witness'
exact description of the shooter, he chas
tised reporters for running reports that
variously described the gunman as dark
skinned, olive-skinned, Middle Eastern
or Hispanic.
"When we have people from the
media interviewing witnesses and pub
lishing reports, we get confusion,"
Moose said. "We would like to be able to

do our job."
Similar witness accounts of a sniper in
a cream-colored van were published this
week in both The Washington Post and
The New York Times, based on an inter
view with an Arlington, Va., man who
said he met a man at the Falls Church,
Va., Home Depot.
Glen Guymon said he and the witness
started talking when police ordered
them inside after the shooting. Guymon
said the witness told him he saw a man in
the parking lot standing behind a cream
colored Chevy Astro van.
"There was a woman walking out to
her car, he said she was with a guy," Guy
mon told the rimes of the man'saccount.
"The guy behind the van lifted up a rifle
and shot her, then got in the car and
drove oft. He was probably about 50 feet
away from where he shot her."
Reached at home yesterday, Guymon
told The Associated Press: "I'm shocked
he was lying because he had a very de
tailed story. The guy sounded credible.
He didn't sound like he was making it
U P"
Moose said the witness' description to
police of the shooter's AK-74 assault rifle is
also bogus. But investigators cautioned
they still believe the sniper is using one of
more than 30 similar assault-type weapons
capable of firing a .223-caliber bullet.
" People saw a description of a weapon
over the last day and a half and we're
convinced they eliminated people they
know because they say, 'Their gun is not
the weapon I saw in the paper,"' Moose
said.

Det. James Banachoski uses a tool yesterday to map the scene where a woman was shot
on Monday. She was the ninth victim of a sniper who has terrorized the Washington, D.C.
area for three weeks.
