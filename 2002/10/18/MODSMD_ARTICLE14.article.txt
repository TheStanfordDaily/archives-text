## The 						Stanford Daily Budget cuts should affect all constituents equally 
###

In an ideal world, the lack of money would
not pose a problem at Stanford, Health
insurance premiums would be more af
fordable, graduate students would have
surplus housing options, cultural community
centers would have overflowing space and re
sources, and Stanford students would benefit
from more car-less transportation alternatives.
However, as a direct result of economic
downturn, the University will face steep bud
get cuts of at least 8 percent during the 2003-
04 fiscal year. W r hile many budgets will be
modified to reflect these cuts, student inter
ests must remain a high priority on the Uni
versity agenda.
By supporting the priority of student is
sues, we do not wish to undermine the needs
and importance of other University con
stituents — alumni, staff and faculty. For ex
ample, low-wage workers, also relatively
voiceless in the University decision-making
structure, should not be overlooked and dis
missed in budgetary planning.
However, the University revolves around
students — alumni exist as a result of their stu-

dent experience, most staff work can be tied di
rectly or indirectly to the service of students,
and faculty teach students, many of whom will
eventually become faculty.
Without students, Stanford University
would not exist. When disastrous market con
ditions threaten endowment payout, aspects
of the University budget that preserve student
experience must be prioritized and defended
at the decision-making level. However, by
virtue of being students, we can be more vul
nerable to the negative side of these budget
cuts than our counterparts in other Universi
ty constituencies.
While some alumni, faculty and staff
members hold decades of affiliation with
the University, many Stanford students
spend a mere four to six years on the Farm.
By the time undergraduates are old
enough to bring cars to campus and expe
rience the challenges of parking shortages,
they only have a few remaining years of col
lege to voice their concerns about this issue.
In contrast, the construction of new park
ing structures on campus is at least a

decade-long process.
When the University prepares its budget,
students can easily be overlooked. Because of
high turnover, the collective attention span of
the student body does not always focus on
procuring institutionalized resources from
the University. Though academic aspects of
the student experience have more security,
student-life issues such as transportation,
housing and student space run the risk of los
ing funds.
When a dollar spent on faculty resources or
staff inventory is deemed more valuable than
a dollar spent on student space, the Universi
ty has drifted from its founding grant, which
dedicates loyalty to students.
Each year, budget drafts travel through
multiple stages and University offices for ap
proval. During this process, there is no formal
communication between the University ad
ministration and students. As the University
prepares a budget that will ultimately govern
aspects of the student-life experience, students
could easily be left out of the process.
When students perceive misrepresentation

within this budget process, historical respons
es have included campaigns, rallies and
protests. Student-life concerns might be better
captured in the budget planning process by
creating an infrastructure mechanism where
by student voice is included in the process.
Stanford's financial situation is not unique
— almost all of its peer institutions are also at
tempting to recover from the harsh economic
climate —but no one group should suffer
from a disproportionate burden of reduced
resources.
Many successful ventures have occurred
when students communicate and collaborate
with faculty, staff and alumni. Yet such efforts
tend to be one-time endeavors and do not pen
etrate the infrastructure of how decisions are
made at Stanford.
Because student life is more susceptible to
budget cuts, students should work with Stan
ford officials to establish a meaningful voice
within the budget process. Although we can
not predict the future of economic booms and
downturns, we could then at least rely on the
stability of student resources.
