# THE
						WAY I SEE IT
## Who's the minority here? 
### 
On Monday night I attended a
diversity panel held in Alon
dra by the dorm's new staff
member, the cultural aware
ness associate. Now, I consider myself to
be pretty caught up on issues and debates
concerning diversity — I mean, I'm from
South Africa, I'm a woman, I'm black, so
you know I don't necessarily fit into
mainstream Stanford culture — whatev
er that is.
Since high school, I've been involved in
organizations and societies that deal with
cultural tolerance and exposure, so I was
expecting to go over there and hear com
ments that were, you know, interesting,
but that I had probably encountered and
tried to tackle before.
But I found that there are a whole lot of

issues on this campus that
are extremely pertinent
to all of us as a communi
ty, and these are issues
that I had just never
heard discussed before.
This raised several ques
tions about what we're re
ally doing with all this di
versity, especially if this is

the first time I've heard these topics de
bated in a public forum — and I've been
here for three years.
What got me started on this train of
thought is something that one of our pan
elists mentioned almost in passing. She
said something like, "Well, you know, the
fact that we don't have a queer theme
dorm is something that I would like to see
raised," and then continued.
I was awestruck.
I started talking to some of my friends
to hear what they had to say, and I got
some very interesting responses. They
ranged from, "Yes, that should have been
thought of a long time ago; I can't believe
the queer community hasn't taken a
stronger stand on this and demanded that
they be recognized," to "Well, where do
we draw the line? If we're going to have a
queer theme dorm, how many other
groups are going to pop up and ask to be
housed?"
Well . . . maybe we should backtrack
and outline some of the thinking behind
the theme dorms. Usually when this issue
is discussed, it is in the context of the so
called "ethnic" theme houses: Ujamaa for
African-Americans, Okada for Asian-
Americans, Muwekma-Tah-Ruk for Na
tive Americans, and Zapata for Chicano /
Latino students.
The most popular argument for ethnic
theme dorms is that they provide a space
for people who identify most strongly with
the "minority" group they represent, al
lowing them to live in a house where their
so-called minority experience is the ma

jority, in that they make up 50 percent of
the residents of the house. This gives them
the comfort and safety of being surround
ed by people they can relate to, while al
lowing the other 50 percent, those not in
their minority group, to learn by immer
sion in another culture.
Obviously, race is a pretty salient factor
in determining how we identify ourselves,
or we wouldn't have theme dorms orga
nized around color or nationality. But it is
also worthwhile to look at some of the
other "theme" houses on campus — we
have a dorm cluster to suit the special
needs of freshmen and sophomores; some
people would call Syngery a clothing-op
tional house; we have French, Italian,
German and Slavic theme houses; the in
ternational house, and we do also have
various single-sex houses as well.
Looking carefully at this list actually
brings up another question: Why, if we
can have an African-American theme
dorm, can't we have a white-American
theme dorm? The typical answer to this
question is that every dorm on campus
that does not have an ethnic theme is al
ready a white theme dorm, since "white
culture" is the mainstream in those hous
es. This leads me to another question:
Well, then who are white people, and
what is white culture? And I'm not just
being facetious here. I'm really interested
to know: What can we pinpoint as white
culture? If white people are asking to be
separated by nationality of origin, dress
preference and gender, then maybe
there's more to whiteness than meets the
eye. Maybe there is such a thing as a white
minority student.
The girl who made the statement about
the need fora queer theme dorm is white.
Yet she doesn't feel that there is a living
space designed for her to be completely
herself at Stanford. Does that make her a
minority? Yes? But she's a white girl. How
much further from the connotation of
"minority" can you get? (Well, she could
have been a white man, but you know
what I mean.)
So the next question is, who is a minor
ity and who is not? Interestingly enough,
just to throw it out there, I will let every
body know that I do not identify with the
term minority. How could I? I)o you know
how many Africans there are in the world?
There may not be all that many in the
United States, relative to other population
groups, but in the world, there definitely
are, and since I'm not a U.S. citizen, I
don't define myself according to anything
that exists only within this country's
boundaries.
Yet many people would argue that I
epitomize what it means to be a minority
