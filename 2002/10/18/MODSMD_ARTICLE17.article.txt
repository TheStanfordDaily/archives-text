Protesters' impression of Barak incorrect
The members of the Stanford commu
nity who convened to protest former Is
raeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on
Wednesday night claimed unanimously
that Barak's generous offer of peace at
Camp David in 2000 was not genuine
("Protestors express disapproval of
Barak's policies as prime minister," Oct.
17). According to their account of Camp
David, Arafat and the Palestinians negoti
ated in good faith but were met with a
stubborn Israeli delegation that was unin
terested in concluding a true peace.
Anyone in doubt as to the sincerity of
the two sides that convened at Camp
David need only look at their respective
homecomings. On this, the historical
record is clear and undeniable.
Arafat returned from Camp David to
ticker tape parades in Gaza City, celebrat
ed by the Palestinian masses for refusing to
compromise their maximalist demands.
Arafat remains in power, his perceived
steadfastness — in fact, obstinacy — hav
ing actually boosted his prestige.
Barak, on the other hand, returned to
Israel defeated. With his tail between his
legs, Barak headed home to a shell of a
government and to an Israeli population
utterly disappointed with his failure at
Camp David. Barak had been elected on
the promise to bring an end to 100 years of
conflict between Israel and the Arab
world. Having failed to deliver, Barak had
spent his political capital. He has since
been relegated to the lecture circuit.
When one leader is celebrated for his
refusal to make peace and another reject
ed for his failure to make peace, the true

motives of each side are laid bare.

Arafat's real choice
Both Rachelle Marshall's letter (Stan
ford resident says, 'real security lies in
peace,"' Oct. 16) and the pro/con headline
("Should Arafat have accepted Barak's
offer at Camp David?", Oct. 16) seriously
misrepresent the options that Arafat had
at Camp David in July 2000. His choice
was not whether to simply accept Barak's
offer as it stood or to reject it. This was a
negotiation, and as all the students in my
negotiation class understand, counterof
fers are expected in such encounters.
Thus, Arafat's real choice was between
making a counteroffer to Barak's propos
al — one that would have been more fa
vorable to the Palestinians — or shutting
down the peaceful negotiation process en
tirely and turning to violence. He chose
the latter, using as a pretext Sharon's
stupid (but unofficial — Sharon was not in
Barak's government) visit to the Temple
Mount. Clearly, Arafat and his advisers ex
pected that a renewed Intifada would
force the Israeli government to yield more
than the Palestinians could have gotten via
a peaceful counterproposal. It is for this
decision, for the failure to offer a viable
and peaceful counteroffer and to turn in
stead to the path of bloodshed, that Arafat
should be condemned. Two years and sev
eral thousand deaths later, the conse
quences of his choice are plain for all to
see. He should have continued negotiat
ing with Barak.

Portrayal of Greeks 'unfair'
As a member of the Greek community
at Stanford and especially as an inhabitant
of Greek housing, I resent the obvious im
plication in the recent editorial, "Sigma
Ghi deserves punishment for violation,"
(Oct. 14) that the reason that we have re
served housing is simply because of our so
cial agenda. The myth that all fraternities
do here at Stanford is throw parties and
drink alcohol is possibly the largest source
of bitterness amongst the Greek commu
nity, and it is irresponsible for The Daily to
take part in the perpetuation of that myth.
Whereas the ethnic and language-fo
cused groups and houses on campus are
perennially lauded for their accomplish
ments and contributions to the Universi
ty, local organizations and the Stanford
community at large, Greeks only get pub
licity in The Daily when we are negatively
portrayed.
The simple fact is that the members of
the Greek community contribute more to
this campus than they are given credit for.
Although [ can only speak truthfully and
completely about the frequency of my
chapter's involvement with community
service, residential education and univer
sity initiatives, I am fairly certain that other
chapters, housed and un-housed alike,
have many of their own activities and in
terests besides parties and alcohol.
The stigma that fraternity and sorority
members suffer as a result, and in
complete depictions of our organi
zations in The Daily is an unfair
burden for the Greek community
to carry. Our reputations are con
tinuously marred by the lack of
coverage relating to our responsi
ble and altruistic endeavors. I
would not expect every student to
abandon whatever negative opin
ions they have about Greeks, nor
do I think The Daily should write
about every little event we have; I
would, however, like to see The
Daily continue to write articles and
editorials on Greek life, but that it
do so in a more responsible man
ner by acknowledging the
achievements and assistance that

fraternities and sororities provide
to charitable organizations and
campus groups.
With the school year having just
begun, hopefully we will see an in
creased effort to recognize every
group's and house's achievements
equally, and with the same amount
of professionalism expected from
an important and well-read publi
cation like The Daily.

Bridging the gap or
storming the briage?
While I join The Daily's effort
to highlight the well-intentioned
service work Stanford students are
doing in East Palo Alto ("St udents
bridge gap between Farm and
EPA," Oct. 16), I caution those

who feel that we are doing enough
or feel that in merely thinking or
engaging in volunteer work for
those on the other side of the
bridge, we are providing the most
effective service to empower the
individuals of E.P.A.
While I agree that many stu
dents are doing what they can to
help out in E.P.A., the relationship
between Stanford and E.P.A. has a
greater complexity than ivory
tower- located -near-impover
ished-community syndrome. Fac
ing a slew of environmental justice
and social equity issues, Silicon
Valley and the Bay Area have
grown at the expense of commu
nities like E.P.A. So, while I do not
question the apparent sincerity
and industriousness of service ef
forts in E.P.A., I question the claim
that the divide between our two
communities is growing smaller
because of volunteerism in that

community.
In a service relationship be
tween communities, I begin to
question those students who see it
only as a warm-fuzzy-feeling gen
erator and something they do in
their spare time, instead of part of
a bigger picture of social change. A
tutor may cross the divide and
spend 40 minutes raising the liter
acy level and developing a bond
with a bright-eyed child, but who
in the relationship is able to return
over the bridge and into a safer
context at the end of the day? Who
in the relationship is able to poten
tially leave this area in four years
and not have to think about issues
of equitable education, affordable
housing or environmental health?
If volunteer efforts are nothing
more than filling gaps in students'
spare time and students who vol
unteer in literacy programs are not
questioning the larger social
frameworks of why there may be
such a need for student-driven vol
unteer support programs in
E.P.A., 1 believe the service has
failed as a learning experience.
In most volunteer work, there is
an inequitable distribution of
power in the giving relationship.
This divide of roles between,
and receiver is dangerousl:>ecsus£
it could allow the giver to feel over
ly self-righteous and the receiver to
be disempowered to a greater ex
tent, driving the relationship far
ther away from a balance of power.
So, volunteer efforts could poten
tially contribute to a growing di
vide between our communities if
not imbued with sensitivity, empa
thy and respect for our different
positions in the power game.
I do not mean to sound as if I
am criticizing service work or to
imply that all the work that Stan
ford students do in E.P.A. is not
thoughtful or effective in helping.
Far from it, I feel that much is
being done on campus through
the Haas Center to integrate ser
vice with learning and to help stu
dents reflect on their efforts and
examine the systems that may per
petuate these problems. But,
through my experience I see that
bridging the gap between our
communities will take a lot more

than just well-intentioned volun
teer work. 1 encourage Stanford
students to engage in establishing
meaningful and thoughtful ties to
the community in which they serve
and truly think about what it
means to live on the other side of
the bridge.

CoHo performer's lyrics carried
misogynist message
Having seen Eric Blackerby's
rave review in The Daily of a rap
per named esteban who per
formed the other night at the
CoHo, I thought I'd shed my own
light on the issues of hip-hop, sex
ism and social change at Stanford
University, esteban's lyrics were
highly offensive to many in the au
dience who chose to take their
minds off the beat and focus on the
message. Specifically, his views on
women were, to say the least,
derogatory, but when a few
women approached the stage in
protest, they received no support.
Some people even seemed to think
that ..because h,e never the
and that •me'wftmeii hfict i& right
to be upset.
I happen to disagree, but lest
your mind be prejudiced against
my message by stereotypical im
ages of a hairy, angry feminist, let
me give you an analogy that might
go over a little more easily.
I think it is fair to say that, a per
former whose material carried
highly racist undertones would not
be tolerated by the student body at
any venue. I do not mean to insin
uate that he would be forced from
the stage, but certainly, some de
gree of protest would be expected
and, I believe, generally support
ed. I think, too, that most people
would agree that the absence of the
n-word from the artist's rhetoric
does little to change the fact that a
message extolling the inferiority of
blacks is offensive. The ideas that
are being communicated are
what's important, not the jargon
used to express them. Similarly,
when someone says things that rel

egate females to the role of sexual
accessories for men, the message is
not favorable to women, regard
less of whether the terms used are
"bitch" and "ho," or "woman" and
"female." If that's the kind of thing
1 want to hear, I can stay at home,
listen toJay-Z and hear misogyny
to a better beat. However, 1 went to
the CoHo that night to have my
mind stimulated, not hear the
same old, tired white-washed
brand of commercialized hip-hop
whose profit comes at the cost of a
woman's worth and which I can
hear anytime, anyplace.
Honesdy, Stanford, the time has
come to wake up and welcome
progress toward equality for all peo
ple. Consciousness, awareness —
they're not about keeping an ear out
for buzzwords. I realize that's easier
than actually tuning your ear to rec
ognize ideology, but I think we owe
it to ourselves to be truly perceptive.
Anything else is a cop-out.

Organizers of Baraka appear

/)f his message „
TMsil.
tor, President Hennessy refers to
poet and activist Amiri Baraka,
who is to appear on campus on Fri
day. Baraka is the poet laureate of
New Jersey who recently read a
poem claiming that 4,000 Israelis
who worked in the World Trade
Center had advance knowledge of
the attacks. He has a history of
making similar statements that hint
at a world Jewish conspiracy, as has
been recorded by the And-Defama
tion League. While he character
izes these as mere critiques of Is
raeli power and policy, they are
reminiscent of some of the worst
forms of anti-Semitism. I recom
mend that Stanford students inves
tigate for themselves the sources of
anti-Semitism and that the event's
sponsors be more cognizant of the
message t hey may be sending to the
Stanford comm unity.

tower- located -near-impover

ing a slew of environmental justice
and social equity issues, Silicon
Valley and the Bay Area have
grown at the expense of commu
nities like E.P.A. So, while I do not
question the apparent sincerity
and industriousness of service ef
forts in E.P.A., I question the claim
that the divide between our two
communities is growing smaller
because of volunteerism in that

community.
In a service relationship be
tween communities, I begin to
question those students who see it
only as a warm-fuzzy-feeling gen
erator and something they do in
their spare time, instead of part of
a bigger picture of social change. A
tutor may cross the divide and
spend 40 minutes raising the liter

with a bright-eyed child, but who
in the relationship is able to return
over the bridge and into a safer
context at the end of the day? Who
in the relationship is able to poten
tially leave this area in four years
and not have to think about issues
of equitable education, affordable
housing or environmental health?
If volunteer efforts are nothing
more than filling gaps in students'
spare time and students who vol
unteer in literacy programs are not
questioning the larger social
frameworks of why there may be
such a need for student-driven vol
unteer support programs in
E.P.A., 1 believe the service has
failed as a learning experience.
In most volunteer work, there is
an inequitable distribution of
power in the giving relationship.
This divide of roles between,
and receiver is dangerousl:>ecsus£
it could allow the giver to feel over

be disempowered to a greater ex

So, volunteer efforts could poten
tially contribute to a growing di

not imbued with sensitivity, empa

I do not mean to sound as if I
am criticizing service work or to
imply that all the work that Stan
ford students do in E.P.A. is not
thoughtful or effective in helping.
Far from it, I feel that much is
being done on campus through
the Haas Center to integrate ser
vice with learning and to help stu
dents reflect on their efforts and
examine the systems that may per
petuate these problems. But,
through my experience I see that
bridging the gap between our
communities will take a lot more

than just well-intentioned volun

students to engage in establishing
meaningful and thoughtful ties to
the community in which they serve
and truly think about what it
means to live on the other side of
the bridge.

CoHo performer's lyrics carried
misogynist message
Having seen Eric Blackerby's
rave review in The Daily of a rap
per named esteban who per
formed the other night at the
CoHo, I thought I'd shed my own
light on the issues of hip-hop, sex
ism and social change at Stanford
University, esteban's lyrics were
highly offensive to many in the au
dience who chose to take their
minds off the beat and focus on the
message. Specifically, his views on
women were, to say the least,
derogatory, but when a few
women approached the stage in
protest, they received no support.
Some people even seemed to think
that ..because h,e never the
and that •me'wftmeii hfict i& right
to be upset.
I happen to disagree, but lest
your mind be prejudiced against
my message by stereotypical im
ages of a hairy, angry feminist, let
me give you an analogy that might
go over a little more easily.
I think it is fair to say that, a per
former whose material carried
highly racist undertones would not
be tolerated by the student body at
any venue. I do not mean to insin
uate that he would be forced from
the stage, but certainly, some de
gree of protest would be expected
and, I believe, generally support
ed. I think, too, that most people
would agree that the absence of the
n-word from the artist's rhetoric
does little to change the fact that a
message extolling the inferiority of
blacks is offensive. The ideas that
are being communicated are
what's important, not the jargon
used to express them. Similarly,
when someone says things that rel

egate females to the role of sexual
accessories for men, the message is
not favorable to women, regard
less of whether the terms used are
"bitch" and "ho," or "woman" and
"female." If that's the kind of thing
1 want to hear, I can stay at home,
listen toJay-Z and hear misogyny
to a better beat. However, 1 went to
the CoHo that night to have my
mind stimulated, not hear the
same old, tired white-washed
brand of commercialized hip-hop
whose profit comes at the cost of a
woman's worth and which I can
hear anytime, anyplace.

Organizers of Baraka appear

/)f his message „
TMsil.
tor, President Hennessy refers to
poet and activist Amiri Baraka,
who is to appear on campus on Fri
day. Baraka is the poet laureate of
New Jersey who recently read a
poem claiming that 4,000 Israelis
who worked in the World Trade
Center had advance knowledge of
the attacks. He has a history of
making similar statements that hint
at a world Jewish conspiracy, as has
been recorded by the And-Defama
tion League. While he character
izes these as mere critiques of Is
raeli power and policy, they are
reminiscent of some of the worst
forms of anti-Semitism. I recom
mend that Stanford students inves
tigate for themselves the sources of
anti-Semitism and that the event's
sponsors be more cognizant of the
message t hey may be sending to the
Stanford comm unity.

Protesters' impression of Barak incorrect
The members of the Stanford commu
nity who convened to protest former Is
raeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on
Wednesday night claimed unanimously
that Barak's generous offer of peace at
Camp David in 2000 was not genuine
("Protestors express disapproval of
Barak's policies as prime minister," Oct.
17). According to their account of Camp
David, Arafat and the Palestinians negoti
ated in good faith but were met with a
stubborn Israeli delegation that was unin
terested in concluding a true peace.
Anyone in doubt as to the sincerity of
the two sides that convened at Camp
David need only look at their respective
homecomings. On this, the historical
record is clear and undeniable.
Arafat returned from Camp David to
ticker tape parades in Gaza City, celebrat
ed by the Palestinian masses for refusing to
compromise their maximalist demands.
Arafat remains in power, his perceived
steadfastness — in fact, obstinacy — hav
ing actually boosted his prestige.
Barak, on the other hand, returned to
Israel defeated. With his tail between his
legs, Barak headed home to a shell of a
government and to an Israeli population
utterly disappointed with his failure at
Camp David. Barak had been elected on
the promise to bring an end to 100 years of
conflict between Israel and the Arab
world. Having failed to deliver, Barak had
spent his political capital. He has since
been relegated to the lecture circuit.
When one leader is celebrated for his
refusal to make peace and another reject
ed for his failure to make peace, the true

motives of each side are laid bare.
BKNJAMIN KLAFTER
San Francisco resident

Arafat's real choice
Both Rachelle Marshall's letter (Stan
ford resident says, 'real security lies in
peace,"' Oct. 16) and the pro/con headline
("Should Arafat have accepted Barak's
offer at Camp David?", Oct. 16) seriously
misrepresent the options that Arafat had
at Camp David in July 2000. His choice
was not whether to simply accept Barak's
offer as it stood or to reject it. This was a
negotiation, and as all the students in my
negotiation class understand, counterof
fers are expected in such encounters.
Thus, Arafat's real choice was between
making a counteroffer to Barak's propos
al — one that would have been more fa
vorable to the Palestinians — or shutting
down the peaceful negotiation process en
tirely and turning to violence. He chose
the latter, using as a pretext Sharon's
stupid (but unofficial — Sharon was not in
Barak's government) visit to the Temple
Mount. Clearly, Arafat and his advisers ex
pected that a renewed Intifada would
force the Israeli government to yield more
than the Palestinians could have gotten via
a peaceful counterproposal. It is for this
decision, for the failure to offer a viable
and peaceful counteroffer and to turn in
stead to the path of bloodshed, that Arafat
should be condemned. Two years and sev
eral thousand deaths later, the conse
quences of his choice are plain for all to
see. He should have continued negotiat
ing with Barak.

Portrayal of Greeks 'unfair'
As a member of the Greek community
at Stanford and especially as an inhabitant
of Greek housing, I resent the obvious im
plication in the recent editorial, "Sigma
Ghi deserves punishment for violation,"
(Oct. 14) that the reason that we have re
served housing is simply because of our so
cial agenda. The myth that all fraternities
do here at Stanford is throw parties and
drink alcohol is possibly the largest source
of bitterness amongst the Greek commu
nity, and it is irresponsible for The Daily to
take part in the perpetuation of that myth.
Whereas the ethnic and language-fo
cused groups and houses on campus are
perennially lauded for their accomplish
ments and contributions to the Universi
ty, local organizations and the Stanford
community at large, Greeks only get pub
licity in The Daily when we are negatively
portrayed.
The simple fact is that the members of
the Greek community contribute more to
this campus than they are given credit for.
Although [ can only speak truthfully and
completely about the frequency of my
chapter's involvement with community
service, residential education and univer
sity initiatives, I am fairly certain that other
chapters, housed and un-housed alike,
have many of their own activities and in
terests besides parties and alcohol.
The stigma that fraternity and sorority
members suffer as a result, and in
complete depictions of our organi
zations in The Daily is an unfair
burden for the Greek community
to carry. Our reputations are con
tinuously marred by the lack of
coverage relating to our responsi
ble and altruistic endeavors. I
would not expect every student to
abandon whatever negative opin
ions they have about Greeks, nor
do I think The Daily should write
about every little event we have; I
would, however, like to see The
Daily continue to write articles and
editorials on Greek life, but that it
do so in a more responsible man
ner by acknowledging the
achievements and assistance that

fraternities and sororities provide
to charitable organizations and
campus groups.
With the school year having just
begun, hopefully we will see an in
creased effort to recognize every
group's and house's achievements
equally, and with the same amount
of professionalism expected from
an important and well-read publi
cation like The Daily.

Bridging the gap or
storming the briage?
While I join The Daily's effort
to highlight the well-intentioned
service work Stanford students are
doing in East Palo Alto ("St udents
bridge gap between Farm and
EPA," Oct. 16), I caution those

who feel that we are doing enough
or feel that in merely thinking or
engaging in volunteer work for
those on the other side of the
bridge, we are providing the most
effective service to empower the
individuals of E.P.A.
While I agree that many stu
dents are doing what they can to
help out in E.P.A., the relationship
between Stanford and E.P.A. has a
greater complexity than ivory
tower- located -near-impover

ing a slew of environmental justice
and social equity issues, Silicon

Protesters' impression of Barak incorrect
The members of the Stanford commu
nity who convened to protest former Is
raeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on
Wednesday night claimed unanimously
that Barak's generous offer of peace at
Camp David in 2000 was not genuine
("Protestors express disapproval of
Barak's policies as prime minister," Oct.
17). According to their account of Camp
David, Arafat and the Palestinians negoti
ated in good faith but were met with a
stubborn Israeli delegation that was unin
terested in concluding a true peace.
Anyone in doubt as to the sincerity of
the two sides that convened at Camp
David need only look at their respective
homecomings. On this, the historical
record is clear and undeniable.
Arafat returned from Camp David to
ticker tape parades in Gaza City, celebrat
ed by the Palestinian masses for refusing to
compromise their maximalist demands.
Arafat remains in power, his perceived
steadfastness — in fact, obstinacy — hav
ing actually boosted his prestige.
Barak, on the other hand, returned to
Israel defeated. With his tail between his
legs, Barak headed home to a shell of a
government and to an Israeli population
utterly disappointed with his failure at
Camp David. Barak had been elected on
the promise to bring an end to 100 years of
conflict between Israel and the Arab
world. Having failed to deliver, Barak had
spent his political capital. He has since
been relegated to the lecture circuit.
When one leader is celebrated for his
refusal to make peace and another reject
ed for his failure to make peace, the true

motives of each side are laid bare.
BKNJAMIN KLAFTER
San Francisco resident

Arafat's real choice
Both Rachelle Marshall's letter (Stan
ford resident says, 'real security lies in
peace,"' Oct. 16) and the pro/con headline
("Should Arafat have accepted Barak's
offer at Camp David?", Oct. 16) seriously
misrepresent the options that Arafat had
at Camp David in July 2000. His choice
was not whether to simply accept Barak's
offer as it stood or to reject it. This was a
negotiation, and as all the students in my
negotiation class understand, counterof
fers are expected in such encounters.
Thus, Arafat's real choice was between
making a counteroffer to Barak's propos
al — one that would have been more fa
vorable to the Palestinians — or shutting
down the peaceful negotiation process en
tirely and turning to violence. He chose
the latter, using as a pretext Sharon's
stupid (but unofficial — Sharon was not in
Barak's government) visit to the Temple
Mount. Clearly, Arafat and his advisers ex
pected that a renewed Intifada would
force the Israeli government to yield more
than the Palestinians could have gotten via
a peaceful counterproposal. It is for this
decision, for the failure to offer a viable
and peaceful counteroffer and to turn in
stead to the path of bloodshed, that Arafat
should be condemned. Two years and sev
eral thousand deaths later, the conse
quences of his choice are plain for all to
see. He should have continued negotiat
ing with Barak.

Portrayal of Greeks 'unfair'
As a member of the Greek community
at Stanford and especially as an inhabitant
of Greek housing, I resent the obvious im
plication in the recent editorial, "Sigma
Ghi deserves punishment for violation,"
(Oct. 14) that the reason that we have re
served housing is simply because of our so
cial agenda. The myth that all fraternities
do here at Stanford is throw parties and
drink alcohol is possibly the largest source
of bitterness amongst the Greek commu
nity, and it is irresponsible for The Daily to
take part in the perpetuation of that myth.
Whereas the ethnic and language-fo
cused groups and houses on campus are
perennially lauded for their accomplish
ments and contributions to the Universi
ty, local organizations and the Stanford
community at large, Greeks only get pub
licity in The Daily when we are negatively
portrayed.
The simple fact is that the members of
the Greek community contribute more to
this campus than they are given credit for.
Although [ can only speak truthfully and
completely about the frequency of my
chapter's involvement with community
service, residential education and univer
sity initiatives, I am fairly certain that other
chapters, housed and un-housed alike,
have many of their own activities and in
terests besides parties and alcohol.
The stigma that fraternity and sorority
members suffer as a result, and in
complete depictions of our organi
zations in The Daily is an unfair
burden for the Greek community
to carry. Our reputations are con
tinuously marred by the lack of
coverage relating to our responsi
ble and altruistic endeavors. I
would not expect every student to
abandon whatever negative opin
ions they have about Greeks, nor
do I think The Daily should write
about every little event we have; I
would, however, like to see The
Daily continue to write articles and
editorials on Greek life, but that it
do so in a more responsible man
ner by acknowledging the
achievements and assistance that

fraternities and sororities provide
to charitable organizations and
campus groups.
With the school year having just
begun, hopefully we will see an in
creased effort to recognize every
group's and house's achievements
equally, and with the same amount
of professionalism expected from
an important and well-read publi
cation like The Daily.
JASON LEV IN E

Bridging the gap or
storming the briage?
While I join The Daily's effort
to highlight the well-intentioned
service work Stanford students are
doing in East Palo Alto ("St udents
bridge gap between Farm and
EPA," Oct. 16), I caution those

who feel that we are doing enough
or feel that in merely thinking or
engaging in volunteer work for
those on the other side of the
bridge, we are providing the most
effective service to empower the
individuals of E.P.A.
While I agree that many stu
dents are doing what they can to
help out in E.P.A., the relationship
between Stanford and E.P.A. has a
greater complexity than ivory
tower- located -near-impover
ished-community syndrome. Fac
ing a slew of environmental justice
and social equity issues, Silicon
Valley and the Bay Area have
grown at the expense of commu
nities like E.P.A. So, while I do not
question the apparent sincerity
and industriousness of service ef
forts in E.P.A., I question the claim
that the divide between our two
communities is growing smaller
because of volunteerism in that

community.
In a service relationship be
tween communities, I begin to
question those students who see it
only as a warm-fuzzy-feeling gen
erator and something they do in
their spare time, instead of part of
a bigger picture of social change. A
tutor may cross the divide and
spend 40 minutes raising the liter
acy level and developing a bond
with a bright-eyed child, but who
in the relationship is able to return
over the bridge and into a safer
context at the end of the day? Who
in the relationship is able to poten
tially leave this area in four years
and not have to think about issues
of equitable education, affordable
housing or environmental health?
If volunteer efforts are nothing
more than filling gaps in students'
spare time and students who vol
unteer in literacy programs are not
questioning the larger social
frameworks of why there may be
such a need for student-driven vol
unteer support programs in
E.P.A., 1 believe the service has
failed as a learning experience.
In most volunteer work, there is
an inequitable distribution of
power in the giving relationship.
This divide of roles between,
and receiver is dangerousl:>ecsus£
it could allow the giver to feel over
ly self-righteous and the receiver to
be disempowered to a greater ex
tent, driving the relationship far
ther away from a balance of power.
So, volunteer efforts could poten
tially contribute to a growing di
vide between our communities if
not imbued with sensitivity, empa
thy and respect for our different
positions in the power game.
I do not mean to sound as if I
am criticizing service work or to
imply that all the work that Stan
ford students do in E.P.A. is not
thoughtful or effective in helping.
Far from it, I feel that much is
being done on campus through
the Haas Center to integrate ser
vice with learning and to help stu
dents reflect on their efforts and
examine the systems that may per
petuate these problems. But,
through my experience I see that
bridging the gap between our
communities will take a lot more

than just well-intentioned volun
teer work. 1 encourage Stanford
students to engage in establishing
meaningful and thoughtful ties to
the community in which they serve
and truly think about what it
means to live on the other side of
the bridge.

CoHo performer's lyrics carried
misogynist message
Having seen Eric Blackerby's
rave review in The Daily of a rap
per named esteban who per
formed the other night at the
CoHo, I thought I'd shed my own
light on the issues of hip-hop, sex
ism and social change at Stanford
University, esteban's lyrics were
highly offensive to many in the au
dience who chose to take their
minds off the beat and focus on the
message. Specifically, his views on
women were, to say the least,
derogatory, but when a few
women approached the stage in
protest, they received no support.
Some people even seemed to think
that ..because h,e never the
and that •me'wftmeii hfict i& right
to be upset.
I happen to disagree, but lest
your mind be prejudiced against
my message by stereotypical im
ages of a hairy, angry feminist, let
me give you an analogy that might
go over a little more easily.
I think it is fair to say that, a per
former whose material carried
highly racist undertones would not
be tolerated by the student body at
any venue. I do not mean to insin
uate that he would be forced from
the stage, but certainly, some de
gree of protest would be expected
and, I believe, generally support
ed. I think, too, that most people
would agree that the absence of the
n-word from the artist's rhetoric
does little to change the fact that a
message extolling the inferiority of
blacks is offensive. The ideas that
are being communicated are
what's important, not the jargon
used to express them. Similarly,
when someone says things that rel

egate females to the role of sexual
accessories for men, the message is
not favorable to women, regard
less of whether the terms used are
"bitch" and "ho," or "woman" and
"female." If that's the kind of thing
1 want to hear, I can stay at home,
listen toJay-Z and hear misogyny
to a better beat. However, 1 went to
the CoHo that night to have my
mind stimulated, not hear the
same old, tired white-washed
brand of commercialized hip-hop
whose profit comes at the cost of a
woman's worth and which I can
hear anytime, anyplace.
Honesdy, Stanford, the time has
come to wake up and welcome
progress toward equality for all peo
ple. Consciousness, awareness —
they're not about keeping an ear out
for buzzwords. I realize that's easier
than actually tuning your ear to rec
ognize ideology, but I think we owe
it to ourselves to be truly perceptive.
Anything else is a cop-out.

bridge gap between Farm and
EPA," Oct. 16), I caution those

who feel that we are doing enough
or feel that in merely thinking or
engaging in volunteer work for
those on the other side of the
bridge, we are providing the most
effective service to empower the
individuals of E.P.A.
While I agree that many stu
dents are doing what they can to
help out in E.P.A., the relationship
between Stanford and E.P.A. has a
greater complexity than ivory
tower- located -near-impover
ished-community syndrome. Fac
ing a slew of environmental justice
and social equity issues, Silicon
Valley and the Bay Area have
grown at the expense of commu
nities like E.P.A. So, while I do not
question the apparent sincerity
and industriousness of service ef
forts in E.P.A., I question the claim
that the divide between our two
communities is growing smaller
because of volunteerism in that

community.
In a service relationship be
tween communities, I begin to
question those students who see it
only as a warm-fuzzy-feeling gen
erator and something they do in
their spare time, instead of part of
a bigger picture of social change. A
tutor may cross the divide and
spend 40 minutes raising the liter
acy level and developing a bond
with a bright-eyed child, but who
in the relationship is able to return
over the bridge and into a safer
context at the end of the day? Who
in the relationship is able to poten
tially leave this area in four years
and not have to think about issues
of equitable education, affordable
housing or environmental health?
If volunteer efforts are nothing
more than filling gaps in students'
spare time and students who vol
unteer in literacy programs are not
questioning the larger social
frameworks of why there may be
such a need for student-driven vol
unteer support programs in
E.P.A., 1 believe the service has
failed as a learning experience.
In most volunteer work, there is
an inequitable distribution of
power in the giving relationship.
This divide of roles between,
and receiver is dangerousl:>ecsus£
it could allow the giver to feel over
ly self-righteous and the receiver to
be disempowered to a greater ex
tent, driving the relationship far
ther away from a balance of power.
So, volunteer efforts could poten
tially contribute to a growing di
vide between our communities if
not imbued with sensitivity, empa
thy and respect for our different
positions in the power game.
I do not mean to sound as if I
am criticizing service work or to
imply that all the work that Stan
ford students do in E.P.A. is not
thoughtful or effective in helping.
Far from it, I feel that much is
being done on campus through
the Haas Center to integrate ser
vice with learning and to help stu
dents reflect on their efforts and
examine the systems that may per
petuate these problems. But,
through my experience I see that
bridging the gap between our
communities will take a lot more

than just well-intentioned volun
teer work. 1 encourage Stanford
students to engage in establishing
meaningful and thoughtful ties to
the community in which they serve
and truly think about what it
means to live on the other side of
the bridge.

CoHo performer's lyrics carried
misogynist message
Having seen Eric Blackerby's
rave review in The Daily of a rap
per named esteban who per
formed the other night at the
CoHo, I thought I'd shed my own
light on the issues of hip-hop, sex
ism and social change at Stanford
University, esteban's lyrics were
highly offensive to many in the au
dience who chose to take their
minds off the beat and focus on the
message. Specifically, his views on
women were, to say the least,
derogatory, but when a few
women approached the stage in
protest, they received no support.
Some people even seemed to think
that ..because h,e never the
and that •me'wftmeii hfict i& right
to be upset.
I happen to disagree, but lest
your mind be prejudiced against
my message by stereotypical im
ages of a hairy, angry feminist, let
me give you an analogy that might
go over a little more easily.
I think it is fair to say that, a per
former whose material carried
highly racist undertones would not
be tolerated by the student body at
any venue. I do not mean to insin
uate that he would be forced from
the stage, but certainly, some de
gree of protest would be expected
and, I believe, generally support
ed. I think, too, that most people
would agree that the absence of the
n-word from the artist's rhetoric
does little to change the fact that a
message extolling the inferiority of
blacks is offensive. The ideas that
are being communicated are
what's important, not the jargon
used to express them. Similarly,
when someone says things that rel

egate females to the role of sexual
accessories for men, the message is
not favorable to women, regard
less of whether the terms used are
"bitch" and "ho," or "woman" and
"female." If that's the kind of thing
1 want to hear, I can stay at home,
listen toJay-Z and hear misogyny
to a better beat. However, 1 went to
the CoHo that night to have my
mind stimulated, not hear the
same old, tired white-washed
brand of commercialized hip-hop
whose profit comes at the cost of a
woman's worth and which I can
hear anytime, anyplace.
Honesdy, Stanford, the time has
come to wake up and welcome
progress toward equality for all peo
ple. Consciousness, awareness —
they're not about keeping an ear out
for buzzwords. I realize that's easier
than actually tuning your ear to rec
ognize ideology, but I think we owe
it to ourselves to be truly perceptive.
Anything else is a cop-out.

Organizers of Baraka appear
ance should be 'more cognizant 7
/)f his message „
TMsil.
tor, President Hennessy refers to
poet and activist Amiri Baraka,
who is to appear on campus on Fri
day. Baraka is the poet laureate of
New Jersey who recently read a
poem claiming that 4,000 Israelis
who worked in the World Trade
Center had advance knowledge of
the attacks. He has a history of
making similar statements that hint
at a world Jewish conspiracy, as has
been recorded by the And-Defama
tion League. While he character
izes these as mere critiques of Is
raeli power and policy, they are
reminiscent of some of the worst
forms of anti-Semitism. I recom
mend that Stanford students inves
tigate for themselves the sources of
anti-Semitism and that the event's
sponsors be more cognizant of the
message t hey may be sending to the
Stanford comm unity.
