Protesters' impression of Barak incorrect
The members of the Stanford commu
nity who convened to protest former Is
raeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on
Wednesday night claimed unanimously
that Barak's generous offer of peace at
Camp David in 2000 was not genuine
("Protestors express disapproval of
Barak's policies as prime minister," Oct.
17). According to their account of Camp
David, Arafat and the Palestinians negoti
ated in good faith but were met with a
stubborn Israeli delegation that was unin
terested in concluding a true peace.
Anyone in doubt as to the sincerity of
the two sides that convened at Camp
David need only look at their respective
homecomings. On this, the historical
record is clear and undeniable.
Arafat returned from Camp David to
ticker tape parades in Gaza City, celebrat
ed by the Palestinian masses for refusing to
compromise their maximalist demands.
Arafat remains in power, his perceived
steadfastness — in fact, obstinacy — hav
ing actually boosted his prestige.
Barak, on the other hand, returned to
Israel defeated. With his tail between his
legs, Barak headed home to a shell of a
government and to an Israeli population
utterly disappointed with his failure at
Camp David. Barak had been elected on
the promise to bring an end to 100 years of
conflict between Israel and the Arab
world. Having failed to deliver, Barak had
spent his political capital. He has since
been relegated to the lecture circuit.
When one leader is celebrated for his
refusal to make peace and another reject
ed for his failure to make peace, the true

motives of each side are laid bare.

Arafat's real choice
Both Rachelle Marshall's letter (Stan
ford resident says, 'real security lies in
peace,"' Oct. 16) and the pro/con headline
("Should Arafat have accepted Barak's
offer at Camp David?", Oct. 16) seriously
misrepresent the options that Arafat had
at Camp David in July 2000. His choice
was not whether to simply accept Barak's
offer as it stood or to reject it. This was a
negotiation, and as all the students in my
negotiation class understand, counterof
fers are expected in such encounters.
Thus, Arafat's real choice was between
making a counteroffer to Barak's propos
al — one that would have been more fa
vorable to the Palestinians — or shutting
down the peaceful negotiation process en
tirely and turning to violence. He chose
the latter, using as a pretext Sharon's
stupid (but unofficial — Sharon was not in
Barak's government) visit to the Temple
Mount. Clearly, Arafat and his advisers ex
pected that a renewed Intifada would
force the Israeli government to yield more
than the Palestinians could have gotten via
a peaceful counterproposal. It is for this
decision, for the failure to offer a viable
and peaceful counteroffer and to turn in
stead to the path of bloodshed, that Arafat
should be condemned. Two years and sev
eral thousand deaths later, the conse
quences of his choice are plain for all to
see. He should have continued negotiat
ing with Barak.

Portrayal of Greeks 'unfair'
As a member of the Greek community
at Stanford and especially as an inhabitant
of Greek housing, I resent the obvious im
plication in the recent editorial, "Sigma
Ghi deserves punishment for violation,"
(Oct. 14) that the reason that we have re
served housing is simply because of our so
cial agenda. The myth that all fraternities
do here at Stanford is throw parties and
drink alcohol is possibly the largest source
of bitterness amongst the Greek commu
nity, and it is irresponsible for The Daily to
take part in the perpetuation of that myth.
Whereas the ethnic and language-fo
cused groups and houses on campus are
perennially lauded for their accomplish
ments and contributions to the Universi
ty, local organizations and the Stanford
community at large, Greeks only get pub
licity in The Daily when we are negatively
portrayed.
The simple fact is that the members of
the Greek community contribute more to
this campus than they are given credit for.
Although [ can only speak truthfully and
completely about the frequency of my
chapter's involvement with community
service, residential education and univer
sity initiatives, I am fairly certain that other
chapters, housed and un-housed alike,
have many of their own activities and in
terests besides parties and alcohol.
The stigma that fraternity and sorority
