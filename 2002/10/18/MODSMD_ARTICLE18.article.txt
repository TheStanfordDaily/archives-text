# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Students can express enthusiasm without breaking the rules 
### GENE AWAKUNI GUEST COLUMNIST 
I want to congratulate Stanford stu
dents in achieving one of the best New
Student Orientation weeks ever! To the
frosh: You gave energy and enthusiasm
and displayed unflagging determination
as you participated in a cascade of pro
grams and activities, mastered the arcane
alphabet soup of Stanford acronyms and
forged new friendships with classmates.
To the residential staff: You greeted each
new student as a vital and vibrant member
of our intellectual and social community,
and you made your house a real home for
new students. To Stanford student orga
nizations and Orientation staff: You of
fered incoming students a glimpse into
our educational and social resources, and
you held parties and hosted events that
promoted healthy activities for our in

coming students. We appreciate every
thing that all of you did to make Orienta
tion such a success.
During Convocation, President Hen
nessy reminded us that we inherit the
legacy of Stanford's richly diverse past
and that each of us bears responsibility for
the cultivation of a dynamic and healthy
educational climate in which all students
can flourish as scholars and citizens.
We encourage you to keep President
Hennessy's words in mind as you move
forward into the school year. University
policies such as the Honor Code, the Fun
damental Standard and the Alcohol Policy
establish guidelines that help us maintain
this vibrant atmosphere.
Clearly, with or without these policies,
the vast majority of Stanford students
would make responsible decisions about
their personal health and the safety of oth
ers. Unfortunately, in the first few weeks of

the term, a small number of Stanford stu
dents blatantly disregarded the Universi
ty's policies, and their behavior resulted in
serious adverse consequences.
Excessive drinking was a major factor
in several incidents. Three undergradu
ates drank so much alcohol that they re
quired medical attention. Two were ad
mitted to the emergency room in critical
condition. While we share their families'
relief that both students recovered well,
we also pause and consider what could
have happened. Other Stanford students
were driving, bicycling or walking on
campus so obviously drunk that they were
pulled over and cited by police for various
offenses such as Driving Under the Influ
ence (DUI), Bicycling Under the Influ
ence and Minor in Possession. One stu
dent organization served high school stu
dents so much alcohol that the high
schoolers were stopped by police and re

ceived DUl's. Members of other organi
zations were involved in incidents in
which theft and destruction of property
were alleged.
Stanford prides itself in using primarily
an educational approach in striving to cre
ate a healthy and safe campus (See
http://www.stanfbrd.edu/group/cowell/he
althpromo). Students must understand,
however, that Stanford will enforce all state
and federal laws in addition to our own
campus policies regarding alcohol use.
Moreover, we strongly encourage stu
dents to recognize the real consequences
of their actions. When an individual's
drinking places them or others in harm's
way, the University has a responsibility to
respond swiftly and justly. Students who
abuse alcohol often find themselves in dif
ficult and unwanted circumstances with
the law. In addition, a student's health,
academic work, friends, community and

employment opportunities can all be
placed at risk.
We want students to thrive intellectually
and personally at Stanford. We invite you to
share your thoughts with us on this impor
tant issue by emailing pertofsky@stan
ford.edu or mwais@stanford.edu. How do
we, as interdependent individuals, create
and promote a safe and healthy living and
learning community? In what ways does al
cohol use on campus raise concerns for you?
We want to work in partnership with
you to foster a caring community in which
people are thoughtful, respectful and re
sponsible, especially with regard to the use
of alcohol. Together we can minimize the
possibility of our ever having to make that
dreaded phone call to loved ones.
