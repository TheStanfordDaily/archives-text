The graphic about Ehud Barak
on the front page of yesterday's
Daily stated incorrectly that Barak
was born in "Kibbutz Mishmar
Hasharon, Israel" in 1942. The
state of Israel was not established
until 1948.
The article "Magazine honors
Stanford scientists" in the Oct. 16
issue of The Daily stated that
Gretchen Daily's new book is
called "The New Economy of Na
ture: The Quest to Make Conser
vation Possible." The book is actu
ally named " The New Economy of
Nature: The Quest to Make Con
servation Profitable."
