# Law school brings famous speakers
## FBI director; Supreme Court justices to speak during Alumni Weekend 
### ALISON PIERCE 
Fifty years ago this spring,
United States Supreme Court
Justices William H. Rehnquist
and Sandra Day O'Connor grad
uated from Stanford Law School.
They return this weekend along
with Federal Bureau of Investiga
tion Director Robert S. Mueller
111, former U.S. Secretary of
State Warren Christopher and
other distinguished figures to
speak at the law school's annual
alumni event.
The school's flurry of big
name speakers comes mainly
over the next two days, with
Christopher participating in a
panel in Dinkelspiel at 1:30 p.m.
today and Mueller speaking at 5
p.m. today in Memorial Auditori
um. Rehnquist and O'Connor
will, along with University Presi
dent Emeritus Gerhard Casper,
reargue a famous law case tomor
row morning at 9;30 a.m. in
Memorial Auditorium.
Rehnquist '52, current Chief
Justice of the United States, as
sumed his post on Sept. 26, 1986.
He received his bachelor's, mas
ter's and law degrees from Stan
ford. Before enrolling, he served

in the US Army Air Corps and was
discharged with the rank of
sergeant. He was appointed assis
tant attorney general in the Office
of Legal Counsel, by President
Nixon in January 1969. In 1971,
Nixon nominated him for associ
ate justice on the Supreme Court
where he served until he was ap
pointed chief justice.
One unique aspect about
Rehnquist's term as chief justice is
the court's lack of turnover in the
last nine years. This period has
even come to be known as "the
second Rehnquist Court,"a term
coined by Northwestern Universi
ty Law School Prof. Thomas W.
Merrill, to describe an efficient
and predictable court.
O'Connor '52 was the first
woman to be appointed to the
Supreme Court where she has
served as an associate justice since
1981. Before her appointment,
she served as Arizona's assistant at
torney general, as well as the ma
jority leader in the Arizona Senate.
Both justices will preside over
the re-argument of the
Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v.
Sawyer case, otherwise knows as
The Steel Seizure Case. The land
mark case also celebrates its 50th
anniversary this year. In 1952, the
court was sharply divided.
Today's national atmosphere —
amidst the war on terrorism —
lends new significance to a debate
over the scope of presidential

power in national emergencies.
The event is free and open to the
University community and will be
taped for later broadcast on the
Public Broadcasting Service.
FBI Director Mueller is the re
cipient of the 2002 Jackson 11. Ral
ston Prize and will deliver the Ral
ston Lecture in International Law
today.
The prize is awarded for origi
nal and distinguished contribu
tions to the development of the
role of law in international rela
tions. Mueller was nominated to
the FBI by U.S. President George
W. Bush and assumed office on
Sept. 4, 2001. He served as assis
tant attorney general in charge of
the Criminal Division (1990-93).
During this term, he supervised
the prosecutions of former Pana

manian dictator Manuel Noriega
and crime bossjohn Gotti, and the
investigation of the bombing of
Pan Am Flight 103. Mueller also
served as an officer in the U.S. Ma
rine Corps and fought in Vietnam.
I le received the Bronze Star, two
Navy Commendation Medals, the
Purple Heart and the Vietnamese.
Cross of Gallantry. Tickets to the
event are free and can be obtained
