# Though it's slowly spreading, there should be less
## Fear of West Nile Virus 
### ALISON PIERCE 
The journey lias been
formidable for the West Nile
Virus, but county health offi
cials suspect it will come knock
ing next spring. Making its way
from Uganda in 1937, the virus
has fully established itself
throughout the United States,
even California. According to
the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, it's here to stay.
How much of a threat is the
West Nile Virus to Stanford stu
dents? Will the advent of the
disease in our area require a
permanent lifestyle change?
California may be the best
place to live for safety from the
virus. The disease is passed on
by infected mosquitoes, and
California has the most exten
sive mosquito abatement pro
gram in the country with over
50 mosquito-control agencies.
The state has been working on
mosquito control since 1915. Ef
forts in Santa Clara County go
back to 1918.
"What people have to realize
is that California has been
preparing for this fora long
time," said Kriss Kosta, Santa
Clara County Health Depart
ment's community resource spe
cialist. Kosta noted that New
York, for instance, did not have
mosquito abatement until much
later. "What we don't have are
the numbers of mosquitoes."
The Bay Area wasn't always
mosquito free, according to
Kosta. "In the early 1900s real
tors had trouble selling land
here because the mosquitoes
were so bad close to the marsh
areas. Today, due to the abate
ment program, West Nile really
shouldn't be a big issue."

Kosta said that she is sure that
mosquito sources will continue
to be eliminated with the coun
ty's efforts.
"People will have to be more
careful, more aware and use in
sect repellent," she said, "but
there shouldn't be a significant
lifestyle change."
There are several easy ways to
prevent mosquito bites and pos
sible West Nile infection, accord
ing to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.
The first is to check your back
yard. Many people don't realize
that they are breeding mosqui
toes in their ponds, bird baths
and swimming pools. Standing
water, even water that collects in
flower pots, pet dishes, buckets
and cans should be eliminated.
This may not apply to those of us
that live in dorms, but if you have
a back yard, remove anything
that could potentially collect
water.
The second is to wear mosqui
to repellent containing DEET,
the common name for N, N-di
ethyl-m-toluamide, the active in
gredient in the most commonly
used insect repellents. Repellent
should especially be worn at
dawn, dusk and in the early
evening. You can even consider
staying indoors during these
times or wear long sleeved shirts
and pants.
If you do happen to be bitten
by a mosquito infected with the
West Nile Virus, your chances of
becoming ill are very low. Your
chances of developing en
cephalitis, the severe and deadly
neurological disease associated
with West Nile, are even lower.
According to the CDC, there
have been 2,796 known cases of
West Nile since 1999 when the

disease first appeared in New
York. 148 people have died.
The only locally acquired case
of the virus in California oc
curred on Aug. 10, when a
woman from Los Angeles Coun
ty was infected. There have also
been a few other cases of import
ed West Nile infection, in which
a person has been out of state
and brings the virus back. None
has been fatal. The latest import
ed case is that of a 70-year-old
Orange County man, reported
on Oct. 9 in the Orange County
Register. The patient is the first
probable West Nile infection in
Orange County. He recently
traveled to Nebraska where he
likely was bitten by an infected
mosquito and has since recov
ered. Tests on the virus will take
several days to confirm.
As for the atmosphere on
campus, Stanford students don't
seem too concerned about con
tracting West Nile.
"It seems like one thing the
media sort of picks up on," said
Mike Kassoff, a computer sci
ence graduate student. "It's
something we need to be aware
of, but I don't feel West Nile is a
big threat."
"I'm more worried about my
tests doing me in," said Dan
Gindikin, a Ph.D. student in
computer science.
For more information, call
the Santa Clara County Public
Health at (650) 792-5010. The
department said that it would
appreciate any news of people
regularly being bitten by mos
quitoes, in case there is a water
source in the area that they are
unaware of. Dead birds should
also be reported, as they are car
riers of the virus and are often a
sign of West Nile infection.
