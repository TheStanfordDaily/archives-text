## Fans give soccer a boost 
### JIMMY WU STAFF WRITER 
Imagine playing in goal in front over
1,000 people at Maloney Field, facing down
the attackers of the top-ranked Stanford
men's soccer team on their home turf.
As if that wasn't pressure enough, now
imagine having to deal with passionate Car
dinal soccer fans behind your net, constant
ly heckling you and trying to make you lose
focus on the game.

at Fresno State, Sunday, 2:00 p.m.

For the past two seasons, throngs of
Stanford students, most notably a large
group of last year's Branner Hall resi
dents, have slowly established Maloney
Field as one of the most feared places to
play for opposing goalies.
The Stanford players certainly appreci
ate the efforts of the " Back of the Net" club.
"The guys behind the goal are amazing,"
junior midfielder Mike Wilson said. "See
ing them come out at every game really lifts
the team up. I have the utmost respect for
them, and I hope it continues throughout
the season. For the last two seasons, it really
has taken off, and now [Maloney] is one of
the worst places to play at | for opponents]."
According to sophomore Spencer
Porter, one of the original fans to start set
tling down behind the net of the opposing
defense, they mean no direct insult to the
other team.
"Our entire purpose is to get into the
keeper's head," Porter said. "We try to
make the keeper remember his past mis
takes so he can't focus on the present. We
just try and confuse the keeper and make
him and the rest of his team doubt their
own abilities."
Fhe psych-out efforts of Porter and com
pany aren't to be taken lightly, according to
Stanford sophomore goalkeeper Robby
Fulton, who stresses the importance of
focus and concentration as the biggest keys
to success in goal.
"From the goalie's perspective, it makes
it so tough to play and focus when we have
fans like that behind the goal," Fulton said.
"Having them there really helps the team

out a lot because it adds to the whole atmos
phere of the game. They really get us
pumped up and ready to play."
Unfortunately, the team will have to find
its own way to get pumped up this week
end, as Stanford (11-1-0, 2-0-0 Pacific-10
Conference) will travel south to play con
ference rivals No. 6 UCLA (6-1-2, 1-0-0)
and Fresno State (3-5-3, 0-1-0) on Friday
and Sunday, respectively.
In their past 24 meetings, UCLA has
been a thorn in Stanford's side as the Bru
ins have won 19 of those matchups, includ
ing two of the last three. According to head
coach Bret Simon, if the team wants to turn
the recent trend around, the Cardinal will
have to be better prepared mentally and
get past recent injuries.
"Our own team is the largest challenge to
us," Simon said. "The guys must under
stand the difficulty of the weekend and pre
pare appropriately. The guys who are com
ing back from injury are able to compete
but are not at full functional speed yet."
The recovering players who will proba
bly play this weekend are seniors forward
Roger Levesque (knee) and outside defend
er Todd Dunivant (quadricep).
"As of now, they are going to play this
weekend," Simon predicted. "However, it's
hard to tell how much they will play."
Even though the two will not be playing
at full speed, their presence on the field
alone will cause concern for the Bruins and
the Bulldogs. Levesque leads the team and
the conference with 22 points, and Duni
vant is coming off an All-Pac-10 season that
established him as one of the premier de
fenders of the nation.
Even though this is UCLA head coach
Tom Fitzgerald's first year with the team,
he recognizes the challenge that the Cardi
nal will pose on Friday.
"Stanford is a very well balanced team
and have proven again this year that they
are the team to beat in the West," Fitzgerald
said. "We have a few injuries at the moment
which affected our play last weekend, and
we need to play much better this weekend
to win."
Fitzgerald was referring to his team's
narrow escape from disaster in a thrilling 2-
1 win against Fresno State last weekend.

Stanford has its very own soccer hooligans. The men's team has enjoyed the way the "Back of the
Net Club" gets into the heads of opposing goalkeepers.
