# Volleyball sweeps past Wazzou
## 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
For the first half of last night's match
against No. 17 Washington State, the
Stanford women's volleyball team didn't
look much like the sixth-ranked team in
the nation.
It didn't make much of a difference,
though, because Washington State was
looking even less like a 17th-ranked
squad, especially after the Cardinal final
ly kicked into gear halfway through the
match.

Women's Volleyball
Last night: No. 6 Stanford def. No. 17 Wash
ington St. 30-28, 30-22, 30-24
vs. Washington, Tonight, 7:00 p.m.

The end result was a fairly lopsided 3-
0 win for Stanford (15-3, 6-2 Pacific-10
Conference) in front of 1,309 in Maples
Pavilion, as the Cougars (14-4, 4-4)
missed a golden opportunity to catch the
Cardinal while it was down. Stanford was
playing its first match since blowing a 2-0
lead to No. 19 Arizona last Friday in pick
ing up its second five-game Pac-10 loss in
as many weeks.
"We're going through a lot of new
things right now in practice," senior out
side hitter Logan Tom said. Tom picked
up 15 kills in the final two games fora
match-high 17 on the night.
"This was the first game we were try
ing to incorporate things in," she said.
"We did a good job at the end."
Early on, it looked like last weekend's
fiasco in Tucson wasn't completely out of
the Cardinal's mind yet, as Stanford let
an early five-point lead in the first game
slip away.

The Cougars, led by a big digging ef
fort from libero Kortney Jamtaas, were
doing a number on Tom and sophomore
outside hitter Ogonna Nnamani
throughout the game, holding the pair to
a combined five kills and a negative hit
ting percentage. But the Cardinal re
turned the favor, forcing Washington
State's big gun, senior outside hitter La-
Toya I larris, to a hitting percentage even
more in the red.
Stanford found itself down 25-23 but
rallied back behind some timely hitting
and service errors from the Cougars to
take the game 30-28. The Cardinal only
mustered a .152 hitting percentage,
though that still easily eclipsed Washing

ton Suite's .087 clip.
"They dug a lot of balls. The defense
they put up against Logan early on was
impressive," Stanford coach John
Dunning said. "But the longer we
went, Logan's experience took her to
different places."
Torn did indeed return in the second
game to the form that earned her Na
tional Player of the Year honors last year,
rattling off eight kills on 14 sets without
picking up an error. But it took the rest of
the Stanford lineup a while to catch up
with her, as Stanford trailed by four early
in the game before eventually tying it up

Senior defensive specialist Lindsay Yamasaki picks up one of her team-high nine digs in
No. 6 Stanford's 3-0 win over No. 1 7 Washington State at Maples Pavilion last night.
Stanford takes on Washington tonight at 7:00 p.m. in Maples.
at 15-15.
The Cardinal took the lead for
good during a seven-point rally
that saw the Cougars wilt under in
creasing pressure from Stanford's
block. Stanford won the game 30-
22, and the Cougars' attack never
recovered.
The Stanford defense dominat
ed Washington State in the third
game, picking up 22 digs and eight
blocks in the 30-24 Cardinal win.
Junior middle blockers Sara McGee
and Jenn Harvey, the Pac-10's top
two blockers, picked up four blocks
apiece, while defensive specialists
sophomore Leahi Hall and senior
Lindsey Yamasaki combined for 12
digs in the final game.
"Sometimes we all realize that we
need to step up, and as one of the
upperclassmen, 1 feel like I should
be doing that more often," McGee
said. "When people started coming

in and digging balls, everyone's en
ergy lifted. Everyone started play
ing better and celebrating more.
That makes a big change."
The team's blocking and dig
ging display in the third game — as
well as its sometimes lackluster at
tack — reflected the team's focus
on defense in practice this week.
"I think our block after a while
just wore them down so they were
having a hard time for getting kills,"
Dunning said. "With our hitting
numbers, though, we're not exe
cuting as well. We're trying to work
out somethings that we're not good
enough at, and when you do that
sometimes you're not as good.
We're not focusing on the things
that make you execute really well
[on offense]. We're focusing on the
defense."
Nnamani's six kills in the final
game helped pull her hitting per
centage for the match back into the
positive, as Stanford ended up out
hitting Washington State .289 to
.087. The Cardinal also out
blocked the Cougars 18-7.

Outside hitter Adrian Hankoff
led Washington State with 14 kills,
while Harris finished with only
seven and a -.036 hitting percent
age.
Stanford returns to Maples
tonight at 7:00 p.m. to take on
Washington (11-5, 3-4) in its last
match of the 112 irst half of the Pac-10
season.
Outside hitter Paige Benjamin,
who is second in kills in the Pac-10,
seems the likely target of the Stan
ford defense, which has consistent
ly shut down its opponents'
strongest weapon all season long.
But Dunning has yet to set the Car
dinal's strategy for tonight's contest.
"We really prepare one at a
time," Dunning said. "We've got a
lot of preparing to do for [Washing
ton]. It's not clear in my head yet
who to focus on."
The Cardinal will also have to
look out for Sanja Tomasevic, who
is 10th in the conference in digs
(3.09 per game), ninth in the con
ference in kills (3.59) and sixth in
aces (0.46).
