# Volleyball sweeps past Wazzou

### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
For the first half of last night's match
against No. 17 Washington State, the
Stanford women's volleyball team didn't
look much like the sixth-ranked team in
the nation.
It didn't make much of a difference,
though, because Washington State was
looking even less like a 17th-ranked
squad, especially after the Cardinal final
ly kicked into gear halfway through the
match.

Women's Volleyball
Last night: No. 6 Stanford def. No. 17 Wash
ington St. 30-28, 30-22, 30-24
vs. Washington, Tonight, 7:00 p.m.

The end result was a fairly lopsided 3-
0 win for Stanford (15-3, 6-2 Pacific-10
Conference) in front of 1,309 in Maples
Pavilion, as the Cougars (14-4, 4-4)
missed a golden opportunity to catch the
Cardinal while it was down. Stanford was
playing its first match since blowing a 2-0
lead to No. 19 Arizona last Friday in pick
ing up its second five-game Pac-10 loss in
as many weeks.
"We're going through a lot of new
things right now in practice," senior out
side hitter Logan Tom said. Tom picked
up 15 kills in the final two games fora
match-high 17 on the night.
"This was the first game we were try
ing to incorporate things in," she said.
"We did a good job at the end."
Early on, it looked like last weekend's
fiasco in Tucson wasn't completely out of
the Cardinal's mind yet, as Stanford let
an early five-point lead in the first game
slip away.

The Cougars, led by a big digging ef
fort from libero Kortney Jamtaas, were
doing a number on Tom and sophomore
outside hitter Ogonna Nnamani
throughout the game, holding the pair to
a combined five kills and a negative hit
ting percentage. But the Cardinal re
turned the favor, forcing Washington
State's big gun, senior outside hitter La-
Toya I larris, to a hitting percentage even
more in the red.
Stanford found itself down 25-23 but
rallied back behind some timely hitting
and service errors from the Cougars to
take the game 30-28. The Cardinal only
mustered a .152 hitting percentage,
though that still easily eclipsed Washing

ton Suite's .087 clip.
"They dug a lot of balls. The defense
they put up against Logan early on was
impressive," Stanford coach John
Dunning said. "But the longer we
went, Logan's experience took her to
different places."
Torn did indeed return in the second
game to the form that earned her Na
tional Player of the Year honors last year,
rattling off eight kills on 14 sets without
picking up an error. But it took the rest of
the Stanford lineup a while to catch up
with her, as Stanford trailed by four early
in the game before eventually tying it up
