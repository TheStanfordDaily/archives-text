# Women geared up to take down Oregon schools

### MATT BABIN STAFF WRITER 
It's Homecoming Weekend here on campus for
alumni, parents and professors—and the women's soc
cer team, which is back competing on campus for the
first time in three weeks. While the Cardinal sailed
through most of its six-game road swing, compiling a 5-

Women's Soccer
vs. Oregon St., Tonight, 7:00 p.m.
vs. Oregon, Sunday, 1:00 p.m.

1-0 record, with the only loss coming to No. 2 North
Carolina, the friendly confines of Maloney Field will be
a comfort to many on the Stanford roster.
Stanford will host Oregon State tonight at 7:00 p.m.
and will take on Oregon on Sunday at 1:()() p.m.
The Cardinal returns to campus not only with two
fresh conference wins from its trip to Los Angeles,
where it shut out No. 19 Southern California and No.
7 UCLA last weekend, but also with the nation's top
ranking. Following the Cardinal's road wins and
North Carolina's surprising loss to North Carolina
State, the Stanford women find themselves ranked as
the nation's best team for the second time this year.

Sophomore goalkeeper Nicole Barnhart picked up 12 saves in Stanford's
shutout wins over No. 7 UCLA and No. 19 USC last weekend, earning her
Pac-10 Player of the Week honors.
Nevertheless, ii the Cardinal
team has shown anything thus far
this year, it is that there is a greater
goal in mind than a weekly No. I
ranking. Co-coach Paul Sapsford
made that clear ihe first week the
Cardinal took the top spot earlier
this season.
"Rankings don't mean any
thing," Sapsford said. "The only
ranking that means anything is the
last one of the season."
The game against UCLA on
Sunday was stolen from the Bruins
by Stanford sophomore keeper
Nicole Barnhart, who handed
UCLA just its second shutout defeat
of the year. 1 lei 12 saves in the two
shutouts over the weekend earned
her Pac-10 Player of the Week hon
ors for the first time in her career.

Barnhart will be looking for two
more shutouts this weekend against
Oregon State and Oregon.
The Beavers come into
tonight's game with a 7-4-2 record
after dropping both games to the
Washington schools last weekend.
Oregon State fell 1-0 in overtime to
Washington State on Friday, then
dropped a decision to Wash
ington on Sunday.
The Beavers will be looking to
bounce back this weekend on the
strong play of keeper Jo Fletcher
and the golden boot of freshman
Brianna Monka, who has 12 points
(five goals, two assists) on the year
and scored the Beavers' only goal
last weekend.
The Ducks come to Maloney
with a 1-8-1 record. Last week
end, they fell 2-1 to Washington
before salvaging a 1-1 draw
against the Cougars.
Oregon has impressed few this
season, ranking last in goals scored

and goals allowed, leading to a
league-worst minus-14 goal differ
ential. No one on the Ducks squad
has more than two goals—Stanford
junior forward Marcie Ward, the
Cardinal's leading goal scorer with
seven, has only two fewer goals than
Oregon's entire roster.
The Cardinal is looking not
only to maintain its perfect home
record on the season, but also its
perfect record against the Oregon
schools. Stanford is an all-time 9-0
against Oregon and 5-0 against
Oregon State.
1 lie games won't be easy, howev
er, as the Pac-10 still looks as com
petitive as ever.
Off to an early lead in the con
ference standings, the Cardinal
currently controls its own destiny
in the Pac-10, which currently
boasts four top-20 teams, with No.
11 California joining the Cardinal,
Trojans and Bruins in the national
rankings.
