vs. Oregon St., Tonight, 7:00 p.m.
vs. Oregon, Sunday, 1:00 p.m.

1-0 record, with the only loss coming to No. 2 North
Carolina, the friendly confines of Maloney Field will be
a comfort to many on the Stanford roster.
Stanford will host Oregon State tonight at 7:00 p.m.
and will take on Oregon on Sunday at 1:()() p.m.
The Cardinal returns to campus not only with two
fresh conference wins from its trip to Los Angeles,
where it shut out No. 19 Southern California and No.
7 UCLA last weekend, but also with the nation's top
ranking. Following the Cardinal's road wins and
North Carolina's surprising loss to North Carolina
State, the Stanford women find themselves ranked as
the nation's best team for the second time this year.
