# Chima beats odds for field hockey
## 
### SPENCER PORTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Anirit Chima is a rarity. She is a
defender, yet is the points leader
on the Stanford field hockey team.
She did not play field hockey in
high school, yet has become a team
leader on a Division I squad. But
perhaps most impressive of all, she

has become such a good player de
spite the fact that she was born and
raised in Southern California, a
part of the country where field
hockey is almost unheard of.
Even with all that against her,
she is leading the Stanford team
down the home stretch in her final
grasp for glory.
"Being from Ventura, there
was no opportunity for me to play
with other girls at my high school,"
Chima said. "I had to play on a
men's team where some of the
guys could just tool people with

their ball skills or were national
players and could just run circles
around their opponents. But play
ing club with those guys made me
into a better player. Also, because
this is the first organized field
hockey team I've been on, I've
been able to appreciate it a lot
more and enjoy the experience."
Chima and the Cardinal (8-8,4-
1 Northern Pacific Athletic Confer
ence) are looking to forget their re
cent loss to No. 16 California with a
win against Yale (3-7) in non-con
ference action this Sunday. It is the
first game of a three game homes
tand that also includes games
against UC-Santa Barbara and Cal.
Stanford will not leave the farm
until the NCAA tournament, if the
team gets that far; the NorPac tour
nament will take place at Stanford's
Artificial Turf Field from Novem
ber 7 through Nov. 9.
"It's nice to be at home for the
final games. Our games against
Vale and Cal will definitely help
ns prepare for NorPacs," Chima
said. "We don't want to overlook

any of these games, but we really
see them as opportunities to im
prove before the tournament.
The home field advantage is im
portant, though. It's nice mainly
because there are no distractions
â€” no planes, no missed classes, no
adjusted sleep schedules. We'll get
some days oil, and it will allow us to
get some good practices in.
It's also good for the seniors.
Being able to play Cal at home
on senior day will be a nice
touch, but being at home will be
the big difference."
Chima has a point, seeing as
how Stanford hasn't beaten Cali
fornia in Berkeley since she
watched the game on her recruit
ing trip. Stanford has won 14 out
of it's last 17 Norl'ac games, but all
three losses have been in Berkeley.
"That was disappointing,"
Chima said about the Cal game,
"While we played pretty well,
being a senior without ever beat
ing Cal at Berkeley is frustrating."
