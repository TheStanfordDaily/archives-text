# Chima beats odds for field hockey
## 
### SPENCER PORTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Anirit Chima is a rarity. She is a
defender, yet is the points leader
on the Stanford field hockey team.
She did not play field hockey in
high school, yet has become a team
leader on a Division I squad. But
perhaps most impressive of all, she

vs. Yale, Sunday, 1:00 p.m.

has become such a good player de
spite the fact that she was born and
raised in Southern California, a
part of the country where field
hockey is almost unheard of.
Even with all that against her,
she is leading the Stanford team
down the home stretch in her final
grasp for glory.
"Being from Ventura, there
was no opportunity for me to play
with other girls at my high school,"
Chima said. "I had to play on a
men's team where some of the
guys could just tool people with

their ball skills or were national
players and could just run circles
around their opponents. But play
ing club with those guys made me
into a better player. Also, because
this is the first organized field
hockey team I've been on, I've
been able to appreciate it a lot
more and enjoy the experience."
Chima and the Cardinal (8-8,4-
1 Northern Pacific Athletic Confer
ence) are looking to forget their re
cent loss to No. 16 California with a
win against Yale (3-7) in non-con
ference action this Sunday. It is the
first game of a three game homes
tand that also includes games
against UC-Santa Barbara and Cal.
Stanford will not leave the farm
until the NCAA tournament, if the
team gets that far; the NorPac tour
nament will take place at Stanford's
Artificial Turf Field from Novem
ber 7 through Nov. 9.
"It's nice to be at home for the
final games. Our games against
Vale and Cal will definitely help
ns prepare for NorPacs," Chima
said. "We don't want to overlook

any of these games, but we really
see them as opportunities to im
prove before the tournament.
The home field advantage is im
portant, though. It's nice mainly
because there are no distractions
â€” no planes, no missed classes, no
adjusted sleep schedules. We'll get
some days oil, and it will allow us to
get some good practices in.
It's also good for the seniors.
Being able to play Cal at home
on senior day will be a nice
touch, but being at home will be
the big difference."
Chima has a point, seeing as
how Stanford hasn't beaten Cali
fornia in Berkeley since she
watched the game on her recruit
ing trip. Stanford has won 14 out
of it's last 17 Norl'ac games, but all
three losses have been in Berkeley.
"That was disappointing,"
Chima said about the Cal game,
"While we played pretty well,
being a senior without ever beat
ing Cal at Berkeley is frustrating."



AAATT SAYLES/The Stanford Daily File
Senior Amrit Chima, pictured against lowa earlier this year, is the Cardinal's points leader. She follows in the tradi
tion of Melissa Stai, '02, by being a high-scoring player despite her position as a defender.
She'll gel her shot at redemp
tion in three weeks, when the Car
dinal wraps up its regular season
play against the Golden Bears.
However, when asked about
her favorite moment on the team,
Chima wasn't sure what to say,
perhaps because she had too many
choices to pick from. But with the
help of freshman goalkeeper Ana
Kralovec, Chima recounted the
story of how she and fellow senior
Christina Williams decorated the
off-campus house the team stayed
in before the school year while the
rest of the team was away.
They were playing powerhouse
Ohio State for their first game of the
year the next day and wanted to
start the season off well. In Chima's
mind, it was a simple, funny ges
ture, but it was obvious that

Kralovec, and undoubtedly the rest
of the team, appreciated the level of
commitment the seniors put into
the team. When the team shocked
the Buckeyes the next day with a 1-
0 overtime victory, Chima and
Kralovec both thought the leader
ship skills and emotions were a
huge part of the win.
"That was my favorite part of
this year. Yeah, that was a great
day," Chima said.
Stanford dropped its latest
heartbreaker last week to Cal, 2-1.
After tying the game up at 1-1 with
a goal from senior Christina
Williams, Cal's Nora Feddersen
scored with less than 2:00 remain
ing to ice the game for the Golden
Bears. The win put Cal (8-3, 3-0
NorPac) in first place in the NorPac.
1 lowever, Stanford is not out of
the hunt for the season champi
onship just yet. California still has
three NorPac games left, and a loss
in either of the first two would give
Stanford a shot at the title with a

win over California in their final
showdown of the year.
However, the Stanford squad
was not entirely disappointed with
their performance in Berkeley.
"Stanford dominated the game,
but unfortunately the result did
not show that," Williams said.
"Luckily, we will play them again
in three weeks on our field for the
seniors' last home game. It will be
a great game and we know we can
and will beat them. The loss will
only make us work harder these
next three weeks."
This Sunday's game against
Vale is also of note due to the fact
that it will be head coach Sheryl
Johnson's 300 th game at the helm
for the Cardinal. Coach Johnson,
who will be stepping down at the
end of the year, has an impressive
106-122-11 overall record fora
university not known for field
hockey, and on a coast not known
for the sport either.
Just don't tell that to Amrit.
