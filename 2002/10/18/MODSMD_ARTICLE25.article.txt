### RACHAEL HANLEY 
Morning is breaking along the coast, and the bay at
Redwood Shores is tranquil. Out on the water two
eights lock gently in the swells.
But the time has come to prepare die crew team for
the 1 lead of the Charles, the squads first regatta of the
season taking place this weekend in Boston. Coach
Aimee Baker lifts her megaphone.

"This is the mindset: We're the fastest boat on the
water," she announces to her rowers. "Drive right up
Texas' you-know-what and anyone else that comes be
tween you and the finish!"
Today the first varsity boat members from the men
and women's crew teams are headed to Boston for the
Head of the Charles, the world's largest regatta. Lo
cated on the Charles River in the center of Boston, the
regatta draws (>,()()() competitors from around the
world. Rowers race in 21 different categories, includ
ing club, collegiate and champion divisions.
Starting in 12th position in its race behind such
schools as Princeton, Yale, Brown, Ohio State and
Texas, the Stanford women are in a prime position to
walk on the competition this year. Baker said their
strategy is to pass boats in the early straightaway and

avoid bottlenecks along later bends in the course.
"We'll try to jump out in that first mile and then
focus on turns," Baker said.
The men's team has a similar plan to move out
early. Stanford varsity men's eight will start in the mid
dle of the pack in 32nd position behind the Tidew ay
Sculler's School from England and the Sydney Uni
versity Boat Club from Australia.
"Our goal isto finish in the top 15, no matter what,"
said Craig Amerkhanian, head coach of the men's
crew team. "I'm hoping they'll get an adrenaline rush
going through the bridges that will spur them on to
glory."
Amerkhanian is the first to insist, however, that
the race is not results driven. Describing the Charles
as a "reward regatta," Amerkhanian explains that
Stanford rowers go to experience the thrill of having
a large crowd of spectators and to socialize with other
teams.
"It's a great coming together of college rowers, and
that's the benefit of this race â€” the coming together of
rowers from around the world," he said.
The Head of the C Charles regatta is a three-mile race
that includes six bridges and three sharp bends. The
result is a steering intensive course so difficult that only
experienced coxswains need apply. Junior Christen
Young, the varsity men's coxswain, said that, having

coxed the Charles in high school,
she isn't too worried about the
course.
"It's definitely a tough course
fora cox, but it's the kind of thing
that if you prepare well you can
just hope for the best," she said.
"Having that experience I feel bet
ter about it."
The Charles is also one of the few
rowing events that draws a signifi
cant number of spectators. Over two
days, an estimated 300,000 people
line the riverbanks and bridges in
screaming hoards to support their
favorite teams.
"When we're at the bay, we've got
salt mines all around us, but at the
Charles we get lots of screaming
fens," said junior Molly Loeb, a var
sity rower who went to the Charles
last year. "We just have to stay fo
cused. Just talking about it, 1 get re
ally excited."
