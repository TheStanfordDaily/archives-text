# Cross country runners believe anything is possible

May 6, 1954 dawned cold and stormy at the Iflley
Road track in Oxford, England. A steady 15-mph cross
wind blew across the track, with gusts reaching 25 miles
per hour.
Yet this was the day Roger Bannister, a medical stu
dent at Oxford, chose to make his attempt on the "im
possible" four-minute mile.
It was widely assumed that this leat was physically im
possible, but Bannister painstakingly researched the
medical aspects of running and developed scientific
training methods to help him break what is now known
as an arbitrary barrier.

at Pre-NCAA Meet at Indiana St., Saturday, 9:00 a.m.

Competitors around the globe were threatening to
set the record first, but Bannister knew his training had
prepared him for top condition on that specific clay. In
spite of the weather, he took to the track and ran into
history.
Since Bannister's feat, scientific methods have per
meated every aspect of endurance sports training.
While it may look like the No. 2 Stanford women's cross
country team is just "running" when seen pounding the
track, charging the foothills or racing around Lake I .ag,
every second of its training is meticulously planned,
with the goal of bringing every runner to perfect form
on Nov. 25, the date of the NCAA Championship.
To maximize the potential of the athletes on that
day, the season is segmented into several parts, each
with a different approach to training. During the
summer and at the pre-season altitude camp at Mam
moth, Calif., the runners build the foundation that
will allow them to complete more intense workouts
later in the season.
"Volume is the key word in the early part of the sea
son," senior Katie Hotchkiss said. "Summer is an im
portant time to slowly integrate the various aspects of
training, like weights, core strength exercises, strides
and drills, so that your body isn't overwhelmed, which
can lead to injuries."
"As the middle part of the season approaches, there
is a transition from high-volume, low-intensity training
to higher-intensity, slightly lower-volume training. Our
workouts become closer to race simulations. While the
focus of the beginning part of the season was to get in
great shape, the focus in the middle part of the season is
to prepare your body to race effectively."
Training an endurance athlete is in some ways anal
ogous to baking a cake. The coach mixes the various in
gredients of intensity, distance and rest, with little feed
back on how changes will affect the end result.

" There are obvious ebbs and flows related to the times
of the championship meet," women's assistant coach
Dena Evans said. "By the time the championship season
begins with the Pacific-10 Conference Meet, we have de
creased our volume and increased our intensity."
Every coach knows the basic recipe, with long miles
early in the season dropping oil to higher intensity
workouts before the championship. But each coach has
an individual flair, and his or her own particular mix of
the three important variables — distance, intensity and
rest — especially during the final weeks of the season.
"Once we get to the championships, the hay is in the
barn, so to speak," Hotchkiss said. "Workouts remain
intense to simulate racing, and there is a focus on feel
ing rested and ready to compete."
The final weeks, then, are similar to the frosting on

In the fall of 2001, three of the best high school
runners ever entered college to begin pursuing a ca
reer in running. Everyone's expectations were high,
and the "big three" did not want to disappoint.
A year later, Alan Webb, the fastest high school
miler ever, has dropped out of school at Michigan to
pursue a professional running career after a troubled
freshman year. Dathan Ritzenhein of Colorado is
faced with a stress fracture in his upper leg and can
not compete. But Stanford sophomore Ryan Hall,
after a year of growing up on the Farm, is ready for his
best season yet.

Without anyone at his ability in high school, Hall
usually trained alone. But after arriving at Stanford,
he faced one of the best squads in the nation and more
training partners than he was accustomed to.
"It's difficult to adjust to so many people," Hall
said. "You have to run behind guys and not let your
stride get choppy. Sometimes [coach Vin LanannaJ
has me run intervals alone because I just look
smoother, even though I am not going any faster."
But Hall admits that his training partners are one
reason he chose Stanford.
"1 had a great time on my recruiting trip," Hall
said. "It was a tough decision for me, but the team is
so special. The coach is great, and the program he es
tablished is so good."
After a successful freshman cross country cam
paign that saw Hall win in his collegiate debut and
compete on Stanford's runner-up squad at the NCAA
Championships, he faced a set back in his training. A
stress fracture forced him to stop running and red
shirt the indoor and outdoor track seasons.
Now, after a summer of recovery and training, he
is smashing the competition again. With command
ing victories at the Stanford Invitational on Sept. 28
and at Notre Dame on Oct. 4, I lall has dispelled any
doubts about whether he can race with the best in the
NCAA.
For him, the recovery was as much a spiritual thing
as it was a physical.
"Physically, things didn't go well for me last year,"
Hall said. "But I grew mentally and spiritually. It is
great getting back to doing what I love. God has given
me the desire to train and the love of running, and I
run to glorify I lim."
Despite his success in cross country, Hall's main
focus remains on the track, though he sees the work
he does in the fall as crucial to his success in the spring.

Although he is primarily a 1,500-meter racer, Hall
believes the strength gained from racing 10,000 me
ters in cross-country is crucial to being successful at
shorter distances.
"My main goal is to get stronger," Hall said.
"Hicham El Guerrouj (the 1,500-meter world record
holder) doesn't have great speed, but he is stronger
than everyone else out there. The guys here approach
the 1,500 from the strength side, not the speed side."
Despite thoughts of leaving school and running
professionally, Hall has decided to remain at Stanford
for now to get the college experience. 1 Ie still hopes to
compete at the 2004 Olympics but realizes that his
professional career can wait until he graduates.
"The coaching staff really knows how to accommo
date goals like the Olympics and World Champi
onships within your training and racing so that you
are prepared when those races are run," Hall said.

Sophomore Ryan Hall, shown at this year's Stanford In
vitational, which he won handily, is used to running
ahead of the pack. He paces a dynamic Cardinal team
that is ranked No. 1 in the nation.

Olympians] Gabe Jennings and
Michael Stember.
"I really hope to have a learning
experience at Stanford — academ
ically, physically and spiritually. I
hope to develop into the person 1
want to be."
While Stanford is back in action
this weekend, Hall will not race so
he can focus on quality training in
preparation fort he post-season.
On Saturday, many of Stan
ford's other top runners will travel
to Terre Haute, Ind., where they
will compete in the Blue Division
of the Pre-NCAA Championship
races.
"This is a dry run to see what it
is like where the national champi

onships will take place," Lananna
said.
This race marks the debut ofju
niors Grant Robison and lan Dob

Tom McArdle are two of the fa
vorites for the individual title.

for months, and the coach can only
tinker with the top-end speed of the
runners. But even minutely small
improvements can have important
consequences.
Last year, the women's team
won the Pre-NCAA Meet by a
margin of one point, the differ
ence of one runner finishing one
place higher. Had any of the five
scoring runners ran a second or
two slower over the 6,000-meter
course, the margin might have
been erased.

NCAA Meet tomorrow, the Cardi
nal is undefeated after four team
races. Sophomore Sara Bei has
won all three races she entered,

while senior Lauren Fleshman
and sophomore Alicia Craig have
also shown strong form. However,
the team has yet to compete
against some of their principal ri
vals, including last year's national
