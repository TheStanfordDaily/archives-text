# Undergraduates present research
## First-of-its-kind event features presentations of ongoing research 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford has an impressive
record of fostering undergradu
ate research efforts, with over $2
million in assistance awarded to
some 1,000 students last year.
Yesterday evening, the first ever
Symposium of Undergraduate Re
search in Progress, or SURP, was
held at the Arrillaga Alumni Center.
In past years, the only oppor
tunities for University community
members to observe student re
search efforts were department

symposium programs for honors
thesis presentations, according to
Laura Selznick, the associate di
rector of student services.
The high-profile event, spon
sored by the Undergraduate Re
search Programs Office and the
Office of the Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education, featured
114 undergraduate project pre
sentations and attracted the atten
tion of hundreds of students, fac
ulty and alumni.
Selznick. discussed how SURP
is conceptually unique when com
pared to other symposium-type
programs put on by specific Uni
versity departments.
"It is a symposium of research
in progress, it is the in-progress
aspect that makes it special and
different," Selznick said.

"[SURP] takes the energy from
projects done in the summer and
carries this into the fall — it gives
that energy to others. Also, stu
dents are not so buried in course
work and midterms to come see
the projects."
Selznick explained that the stu
dent participants, in addition to
creating a poster display or panel
presentation, had to have faculty
sponsors as a requirement to lie
participants in SURP.
Vice Provost for Undergrad
uate Education John Bravman
explained that the University
wanted to use SURP as an op
portunity to show Stanford
alumni what is happening acad
emically on-campus.

ate Research in Progress. The event was held at the Arrillaga Alumni Center.
"The best way to show them is
to put our alumni in front of our
students," Bravman said. "Since
we have been placing so much
emphasis on undergraduate re
search, we came up with the idea
of having a showcase for under
graduates engaged in research
during Reunion Homecoming
Weekend. Providing [alumni]
with the opportunity to engage
with the students is the very best
way to show them the University
in regards to undergraduate edu
cation and research."
Bravman also commented that
he thought the event was a success
and that it definitely would occur
again the future.
According to Selznick,
preparations for SURP began
long in advance.
"The preparations started in
July, and we all were working on
the planning of the SURP prac
tically as soon as graduation was
over," Selznick said. "If you are
at this wonderful research Uni
versity, you should participate
in the creation of new knowl
edge. If you have a place and a
face where people have had a

chance to get involved and you
invite others and alumni to
come see it, then you create an
exciting environment."
Selznick said that many pre
cautions were taken to ensure that
the presentations on display
would be of the highest caliber.
"We had two workshops for
students to help them design their
posters," Selznick said. "People
have gone to great lengths to de
sign their presentations. We are
really excited about it — we have
been working on it pretty hard."
Kenny Gundle, a sophomore,
explained how he came to be a
presenter at SURP.
"While I was doing research
this summer, I just happened to
go to the undergraduate re
search program Web site," Gun
dle said. "I saw an announce
ment for this symposium, and it
seemed like a great opportunity
to present my research and get
experience at a symposium, so I
decided to apply."
Students overall expressed
that they felt SURP achieved its
purpose.
"I think this is really good and
I think this effort to promote un
dergraduate research is a positive
thing for Stanford," said Cather
ine Liang, a co-terminal student
whose presentation was on prac

tices of knowledge-sharing within
organizations. "I actually worked
on this project over the summer
as part of Summer Research Col
lege. I felt this was a great way for
me to share my work with the
Stanford community."
Bravman concurred with the
students' sentiments.
"It is amazing, the students
learn a great deal in preparing for
this event," Bravman said. "They
worked endless hours refining
their posters and presentation
skills. From the interactions that
are going on in this room, you can
really feel the buzz of excitement
and innovation that is always part
of the best research."
Ellen Woods, the interim di
rector of the URP Office, ex
plained that events like SURP
are representative of the nur
turing nature of the University
as a whole.
"[lt] reflects the wonderful
variety of intellectual interests
and talents among Stanford stu
dents and the support they find
in working with faculty and
graduate students from
throughout the University,"
Woods said. "It also demon
strates Stanford's deep commit
ment to the life of the mind and
to the activity of scholarly dis
covery at all levels of education."
