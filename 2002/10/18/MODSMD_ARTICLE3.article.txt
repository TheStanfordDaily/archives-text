# Undergraduates present research
## First-of-its-kind event features presentations of ongoing research 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford has an impressive
record of fostering undergradu
ate research efforts, with over $2
million in assistance awarded to
some 1,000 students last year.
Yesterday evening, the first ever
Symposium of Undergraduate Re
search in Progress, or SURP, was
held at the Arrillaga Alumni Center.
In past years, the only oppor
tunities for University community
members to observe student re
search efforts were department

symposium programs for honors
thesis presentations, according to
Laura Selznick, the associate di
rector of student services.
The high-profile event, spon
sored by the Undergraduate Re
search Programs Office and the
Office of the Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education, featured
114 undergraduate project pre
sentations and attracted the atten
tion of hundreds of students, fac
ulty and alumni.
Selznick. discussed how SURP
is conceptually unique when com
pared to other symposium-type
programs put on by specific Uni
versity departments.
"It is a symposium of research
in progress, it is the in-progress
aspect that makes it special and
different," Selznick said.

"[SURP] takes the energy from
projects done in the summer and
carries this into the fall â€” it gives
that energy to others. Also, stu
dents are not so buried in course
work and midterms to come see
the projects."
Selznick explained that the stu
dent participants, in addition to
creating a poster display or panel
presentation, had to have faculty
sponsors as a requirement to lie
participants in SURP.
Vice Provost for Undergrad
uate Education John Bravman
explained that the University
wanted to use SURP as an op
portunity to show Stanford
alumni what is happening acad
emically on-campus.
