# Filling in: Tolon takes advantage
## 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN STAFF WRITER 
Watching the Stanford football
team, it is evident that all the
pieces aren't coming together.
The Cardinal appears in need
of a sparkplug, someone who will
bring the team out of its slump
and into the endzone.
After Saturday's loss to Wash
ington State, it looks like that per
son may he sophomore running
back Kenneth Tolon.
"I think the main thing is that
when I come in, 1 am fresh,"
Tolon said. "Kerry [Carter] has
been running since the first quar
ter, so I come in and I have been
watching, so I am well rested. It's
nice to get in there and give him a
break."
Last year, Carter, then a junior,
split time with now-graduated
Brian Allen. As the third-string
back, Tolon played in 10 games,
leading all backs with 6.4 yards
per carry. He played especially
strong after Carter went out with
an injury toward the end of the
season, scoring the winning
touchdown in last year's game
against Notre Dame.
Tolon began this season still as
the third-string back behind
Carter and redshirt freshman
J.R. Lemon. However, with
Lemon injured, Tolon is now the

primary backup in a system that
likes to employ two running
backs.
"J.R. is a little banged up, so I
am trying to fill in for him a little
bit," Tolon said. "I have been get
ting some more carries in prac
tice, but who knows what will hap
pen on Saturday."
Last week, Tolon played well
against the Cougar defense, rush
ing for 89 yards on 14 carries.
"Every team is different, but
you just have to go out, play hard
and try to win the game," Tolon
said.
When Tolon enters the game,
he brings a different running
style to the team.
"Kerry is definitely a stronger
back, so he is going to drag guys,"
Tolon said. "I am not really going
to go in there and power through
the pile. I am probably a less ag
gressive runner."
It is his ability to avoid defend
ers with his agility that enables
Tolon to average so many yards
per carry. In addition, he is able
to use his balance and speed to
avoid defenders, setting him up
for large gains. Last year, Tolon
scored on a 71-yard run from
scrimmage.
"I am just trying to read the de
fenses and play hard," he said.

Quarterback Chris Lewis makes a handoff in Stanford's 36-11 loss to
Washington State last week. The junior likely will be making a lot of hand
offs tomorrow as the Cardinal tries to exploit Arizona's run defense, which
ranks last in the Pac-10.
After a strong performance on
Saturday, Tolon is looking for an
other big game against Arizona
this weekend.
"He is doing a great job," coach
Buddy Teevens said. "He acceler
ated well last week, broke a bunch
of tackles and saw some seams in
holes. His confidence level has re
ally climbed after his perfor
mance last Saturday."
Last year, Tolon had his best
game against the Wildcats, run
ning for 100 yards on only 12 car
ries.
With Carter and Tolon rotat
ing, the Cardinal hopes to keep
the Arizona defense off balance.
In addition, Tolon allows Carter
to get some rest, keeping both
backs fresh.
"I am just happy to get in there
and play," Tolon said. "I just
want to help the team win. I know
Kerry is a good back who is going
to get it done. If I can give him a
break and keep him rested, then
I have faith that we are going to

win the game."
Like the rest of the offense this
season, Tolon has had to adjust to
Teevens' offense.
"But it doesn't really matter,"
Tolon said. "They hand it to me,
and I still run."
And Tolon has clearly been
getting better at that skill since
first arriving on the Farm.
" I have had a lot of good backs
to watch and just learn from,"
Tolon said. "Brian Allen, Justin
Faust, Casey Moore, Carter,
Lemon, they are all good backs. I
just try to watch them practice
and pick things up from them.
They are really helpful, too, be
cause they give me hints and try to
help me out along the way."
Tolon has continued to im
prove over the last two years as
he is beginning to emerge as an
explosive player in the Cardinal
arsenal.
And with Lemon out and
Carter coming off an injury, the
team is going to need another
strong game from Tolon to get a
win this weekend.
"We need a win, and I am just
trying to help any way 1 can,"
Tolon said.
