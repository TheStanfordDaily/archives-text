# Filling in: Tolon takes advantage
## 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN STAFF WRITER 
Watching the Stanford football
team, it is evident that all the
pieces aren't coming together.
The Cardinal appears in need
of a sparkplug, someone who will
bring the team out of its slump
and into the endzone.
After Saturday's loss to Wash
ington State, it looks like that per
son may he sophomore running
back Kenneth Tolon.
"I think the main thing is that
when I come in, 1 am fresh,"
Tolon said. "Kerry [Carter] has
been running since the first quar
ter, so I come in and I have been
watching, so I am well rested. It's
nice to get in there and give him a
break."
Last year, Carter, then a junior,
split time with now-graduated
Brian Allen. As the third-string
back, Tolon played in 10 games,
leading all backs with 6.4 yards
per carry. He played especially
strong after Carter went out with
an injury toward the end of the
season, scoring the winning
touchdown in last year's game
against Notre Dame.
Tolon began this season still as
the third-string back behind
Carter and redshirt freshman
J.R. Lemon. However, with
Lemon injured, Tolon is now the

primary backup in a system that
likes to employ two running
backs.
"J.R. is a little banged up, so I
am trying to fill in for him a little
bit," Tolon said. "I have been get
ting some more carries in prac
tice, but who knows what will hap
pen on Saturday."
Last week, Tolon played well
against the Cougar defense, rush
ing for 89 yards on 14 carries.
"Every team is different, but
you just have to go out, play hard
and try to win the game," Tolon
said.
When Tolon enters the game,
he brings a different running
style to the team.
"Kerry is definitely a stronger
back, so he is going to drag guys,"
Tolon said. "I am not really going
to go in there and power through
the pile. I am probably a less ag
gressive runner."
It is his ability to avoid defend
ers with his agility that enables
Tolon to average so many yards
per carry. In addition, he is able
to use his balance and speed to
avoid defenders, setting him up
for large gains. Last year, Tolon
scored on a 71-yard run from
scrimmage.
"I am just trying to read the de
fenses and play hard," he said.

Quarterback Chris Lewis makes a handoff in Stanford's 36-11 loss to
Washington State last week. The junior likely will be making a lot of hand
offs tomorrow as the Cardinal tries to exploit Arizona's run defense, which
ranks last in the Pac-10.
