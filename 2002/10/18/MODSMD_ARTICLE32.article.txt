# Paradise found for Milton

ATHENS, Ga. (AP) — Tony Milton left
home — or what passed fora home — when
he was 9. He became a father at 17. He lived
in his car fora while, which wasn't as bad as
it sounds.
"Hey, coming from where I came from,
that was luxury," he said. "My car had
leather seats."
No wonder Milton wasn't the least bit ap
prehensive when No. 5 Georgia decided to
hand him the ball on fourth down last week
end, with a crucial game against Tennessee
hanging in the balance. Milton broke free for
a 25-yard run that clinched an 18-13 victory
for the Bulldogs.
"Nothing rattles me much," Milton said.
"I could get nervous during the games, but
what for?"
Indeed, Milton already has overcome
some huge obstacles just to get his life back
on track. The guy who walked away from
football after high school is now a 21-year
old redshirt freshman, backing up Musa
Smith at tailback for the 6-0 Bulldogs. The
guy who didn't make the grade on his col
lege entrance exams is now one of the team's
star students, posting a 3.73 grade-point av
erage during the spring semester.
"I remember asking him what position he
wanted to play," Georgia coach Mark Richt
said. "He told me, 'I don't care, coach. I just
want to be somebody.'"
Milton kept hearing those voices from his
past, the people back in Tallahassee, Fla.,

who told him he'd never amount to any
thing. Especially his parents. He basically
severed ties with them while still in elemen
tary school and decided life as a nomad was
better than what he had at home.
"I lived with so many friends, it's not
funny," he said. "Whoever had a room."
Milton had to grow up quickly or get swal
lowed up by the streets. Fortunately, he had
a gift for running with a football in his hands.
Football became Milton's escape. He
earned a scholarship to North Florida Chris
tian High School, where he helped the team
win a couple of state championships and
wound up rushing for 5,502 yards and 77
TDs in his prep career.
Away from the field, though, things
didn't go quite as planned.
His girlfriend became pregnant with a
boy, Anthony. Milton didn't score high
enough on his ACT to be a full qualifier fora
NCAA football scholarship.
For the next year and a half, he bounced
from job to job trying to support his son.
Milton didn't have a permanent home.
Sometimes, he'd stay with friends. Other
times, he just slept in his car. All that time, he
longed to get back on the football field.
"People were always very negative toward
me," Milton said. "Football was my scapegoat.
I could take out my anger on the opponent.
For those hours I was playing, 1 was happy. I

Sophomore Kenneth Tolon's knack for eating up large chunks of yardage has earned him an ex
panding role in coach Buddy Teevens' increasingly run-oriented offense. Against Washington
State, Tolon gained a team-high 89 yards. Last year against this weekend's foe, Arizona, the
running back broke loose for 100 yards on just 12 carries.
never wanted to go home."
Finally, he decided it was time
to give football another try. Richt,
who had just been hired as Geor
gia's coach, decided to take a
chance on Milton. It paid off when
he scored well on the ACT.
"Coach Richt gave me a second
chance at life," Milton said.

Milton entered this season as
Georgia's No. 2 tailback. He has
carried 20 times for 97 yards.
Life is good for Milton, except
for being separated from his son,
who still lives with his mother in
Tallahassee. He and his son talk
every night on the phone, and 4-
year-old Anthony attends most
Georgia home games.
Milton, it seems, has finally out
run his past.
"It's like garbage," he said.
"You've got to leave it behind."
