# Football looks to tame Wildcats

### MATT LONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Saturday might be Stanford's
best chance at a Pacific-10 Confer
ence win this season. The Cardinal
(1-4, 0-2 Pat-10) will face off
against fellow conference pre
tender Arizona.
Though the Wildcats' (3-3, 0-2)
best win this season was against

lowly Utah, they showed flashes of
brilliance in last week's 32-28 loss
to No. 17 Washington, lighting up
the Huskies' defense for 443 yards
in the air and forcing Washington
into a last minute comeback.
The Wildcats have traditionally
dominated the Cardinal at Stan
ford Stadium, winning the last five
games played there. I n fact, Stan
ford has not beaten Arizona at
home since 1985.
Like the Cardinal, Arizona has
struggled this season on defense.
Unlike the Cardinal, though, the
passing game has been quite effec
tive for the Wildcats.
A team traditionally known for
its rushing attack, Arizona has
taken to the air this season under
quarterback Jason Johnson. John
son is second in total offense
among Pac-10 players and ranks

No. 10 in the nation in that same
category.
Much of this success is due to his
favorite target, Bobby Wade.
Wade leads the conference with
over eight receptions and 122
yards per game.
These teams are quite an inter
esting matchup, as each is particu
larly weak where the other is
strong. Stanford has the confer
ence's third most productive rush
ing attack, while Arizona ranks last
in both rushing and rush defense.
1 n contrast, Arizona has the second
best passing game, while Stanford
ranks last in passing and No. 8 in
pass defense.
"The attitude going into the
game is that we need to have suc
cess both running and passing,"
said Stanford coach Buddy
Teevens, who is still searching for
his first conference victory.
"Arizona has a potent offense, so
we need to keep them on the side
lines as often as possible," he said.
"We've done a decent job with our
running game. That takes a little
pressure off our quarterback and
doesn't put him in a position to
have to make all the plays."
Teevens announced after last
week's game that junior Chris
Lewis will continue to start at quar
terback for the Cardinal, despite
struggling in his first four games.
Lewis is averaging just 146.5 yards
per game and has thrown nine in
terceptions to go with only four
touchdowns.
Stanford's backfield seems just
as shaky. Both of its most experi
enced backs, seniors Kerry Carter
and Casey Moore, have played
through injury much of the season.
Carter has been surprisingly un
productive, as he gained just 55
yards on 18 carries in last week's

loss to Washington State.
Moore, the team's leading
rusher, will be playing for his sec
ond consecutive week without
practice. A foot sprain has plagued
the fullback to the point of being
unable to participate in practice,
but he will play through the injury
to make his 39th consecutive start
for the Cardinal. While Stanford
will need his blocking and leader
ship, he has seen limited carries
since sustaining the injury during
practice. He carried the ball just
three times for 11 yards last week
end, both season lows.
Fortunately for the Cardinal,
sophomore tailback Kenneth Tolon

is quickly emerging as the team's
feature back. He gained 89 yards on
14 carries last weekend and scored
Stanford's only touchdown.
"He is doing a great job,"
Teevens said. "He accelerated
well last week, broke a bunch of
tackles and saw some seams in
holes. His confidence level has re
ally climbed after his perfor
mance last Saturday."
If the Cardinal is to appease its
alumni with a homecoming win to
morrow afternoon, it must find a
way to shut down Arizona's passing
game, something it has failed to do
against its previous opponents.
Things will not get any easier for

the Cardinal, as it will face the sec
ond-toughest schedule in the na
tion for the remainder of the sea
son. Yet Teevens remains opti
mistic about the team's constant
improvement, and understand
ably labels tomorrow's game as a
"must win."
"The attitude you should have is
[that] every game is a must win," he
said. "Certainly, it would be helpful
for us to have a [win]. Guys get frus
trated when they work hard and
there is no satisfaction on Saturday.
But I know Arizona is a very capa
ble and well-coached football team,
and they are going to come out with
the same mindset."

loss to Washington State.
Moore, the team's leading
rusher, will be playing for his sec
ond consecutive week without
practice. A foot sprain has plagued
the fullback to the point of being
unable to participate in practice,
but he will play through the injury
to make his 39th consecutive start
for the Cardinal. While Stanford
will need his blocking and leader
ship, he has seen limited carries
since sustaining the injury during
practice. He carried the ball just
three times for 11 yards last week
end, both season lows.
Fortunately for the Cardinal,
sophomore tailback Kenneth Tolon

is quickly emerging as the team's
feature back. He gained 89 yards on
14 carries last weekend and scored
Stanford's only touchdown.
"He is doing a great job,"
Teevens said. "He accelerated
well last week, broke a bunch of
tackles and saw some seams in
holes. His confidence level has re
ally climbed after his perfor
mance last Saturday."
If the Cardinal is to appease its
alumni with a homecoming win to
morrow afternoon, it must find a
way to shut down Arizona's passing
game, something it has failed to do
against its previous opponents.
Things will not get any easier for

the Cardinal, as it will face the sec
ond-toughest schedule in the na
tion for the remainder of the sea
son. Yet Teevens remains opti
mistic about the team's constant
improvement, and understand
ably labels tomorrow's game as a
"must win."
"The attitude you should have is
[that] every game is a must win," he
said. "Certainly, it would be helpful
for us to have a [win]. Guys get frus
trated when they work hard and
there is no satisfaction on Saturday.
But I know Arizona is a very capa
ble and well-coached football team,
and they are going to come out with
the same mindset."
Saturday might be Stanford's
best chance at a Pacific-10 Confer
ence win this season. The Cardinal
(1-4, 0-2 Pat-10) will face off
against fellow conference pre
tender Arizona.
Though the Wildcats' (3-3, 0-2)
best win this season was against

Football
vs. Arizona, Saturday, 2:00 p.m.

lowly Utah, they showed flashes of
brilliance in last week's 32-28 loss
to No. 17 Washington, lighting up
the Huskies' defense for 443 yards
in the air and forcing Washington
into a last minute comeback.
The Wildcats have traditionally
dominated the Cardinal at Stan
ford Stadium, winning the last five
games played there. I n fact, Stan
ford has not beaten Arizona at
home since 1985.
Like the Cardinal, Arizona has
struggled this season on defense.
Unlike the Cardinal, though, the
passing game has been quite effec
tive for the Wildcats.
A team traditionally known for
its rushing attack, Arizona has
taken to the air this season under
quarterback Jason Johnson. John
son is second in total offense
among Pac-10 players and ranks

No. 10 in the nation in that same
category.
Much of this success is due to his
favorite target, Bobby Wade.
Wade leads the conference with
over eight receptions and 122
yards per game.
These teams are quite an inter
esting matchup, as each is particu
larly weak where the other is
strong. Stanford has the confer
ence's third most productive rush
ing attack, while Arizona ranks last
in both rushing and rush defense.
1 n contrast, Arizona has the second
best passing game, while Stanford
ranks last in passing and No. 8 in
pass defense.
"The attitude going into the
game is that we need to have suc
cess both running and passing,"
said Stanford coach Buddy
Teevens, who is still searching for
his first conference victory.
"Arizona has a potent offense, so
we need to keep them on the side
lines as often as possible," he said.
"We've done a decent job with our
running game. That takes a little
pressure off our quarterback and
doesn't put him in a position to
have to make all the plays."
Teevens announced after last
week's game that junior Chris
Lewis will continue to start at quar
terback for the Cardinal, despite
struggling in his first four games.
Lewis is averaging just 146.5 yards
per game and has thrown nine in
terceptions to go with only four
touchdowns.
Stanford's backfield seems just
as shaky. Both of its most experi
enced backs, seniors Kerry Carter
and Casey Moore, have played
through injury much of the season.
Carter has been surprisingly un
productive, as he gained just 55
yards on 18 carries in last week's

loss to Washington State.
Moore, the team's leading
rusher, will be playing for his sec
ond consecutive week without
practice. A foot sprain has plagued
the fullback to the point of being
unable to participate in practice,
but he will play through the injury
to make his 39th consecutive start
for the Cardinal. While Stanford
will need his blocking and leader
ship, he has seen limited carries
