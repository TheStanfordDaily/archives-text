Saturday might be Stanford's
best chance at a Pacific-10 Confer
ence win this season. The Cardinal
(1-4, 0-2 Pat-10) will face off
against fellow conference pre
tender Arizona.
Though the Wildcats' (3-3, 0-2)
best win this season was against

lowly Utah, they showed flashes of
brilliance in last week's 32-28 loss
to No. 17 Washington, lighting up
the Huskies' defense for 443 yards
in the air and forcing Washington
into a last minute comeback.
The Wildcats have traditionally
dominated the Cardinal at Stan
ford Stadium, winning the last five
games played there. I n fact, Stan
ford has not beaten Arizona at
home since 1985.
Like the Cardinal, Arizona has
struggled this season on defense.
Unlike the Cardinal, though, the
passing game has been quite effec
tive for the Wildcats.
A team traditionally known for
its rushing attack, Arizona has
taken to the air this season under
quarterback Jason Johnson. John
son is second in total offense
among Pac-10 players and ranks

No. 10 in the nation in that same
category.
Much of this success is due to his
favorite target, Bobby Wade.
Wade leads the conference with
over eight receptions and 122
yards per game.
These teams are quite an inter
esting matchup, as each is particu
larly weak where the other is
strong. Stanford has the confer
ence's third most productive rush
ing attack, while Arizona ranks last
in both rushing and rush defense.
1 n contrast, Arizona has the second
best passing game, while Stanford
ranks last in passing and No. 8 in
pass defense.
"The attitude going into the
game is that we need to have suc
cess both running and passing,"
said Stanford coach Buddy
Teevens, who is still searching for
his first conference victory.
"Arizona has a potent offense, so
we need to keep them on the side
lines as often as possible," he said.
"We've done a decent job with our
running game. That takes a little
pressure off our quarterback and
doesn't put him in a position to
have to make all the plays."
Teevens announced after last
week's game that junior Chris
Lewis will continue to start at quar
terback for the Cardinal, despite
