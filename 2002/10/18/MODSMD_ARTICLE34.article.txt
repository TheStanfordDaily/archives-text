# Bobby Wade: The best in the West
## The
						senior Arizona wideout, the Pac-10's leading receiver, just knows how to get open 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Bobby Wade, the Pacific-10 Confer
ence's leading receiver, is preparing to
line up against the conference's third
worst pass defense — but he just wants
his team to run the football more often.
A senior wide receiver for Arizona (3-
3,0-2 Pac-10), Wade believes that success
against Stanford (1-4, 0-2) will start on
the ground.
"1 think because Stanford plays tough
on the run, we might try to establish the
run game early," Wade said. "Against a
team that's geared to stop the run, as
soon as you pop something off on the
run, you've got them beat."
Wade leads the Pac-10 in receptions
(50), receiving yards (730) and, by virtue
of his punt and kick returns, total
yardage (933 yards). He has six touch
downs on the year.
So how does he keep getting open de
spite being the top target in a pass-happy
offense?
"When we play teams that play a lot of
zones, we try to attack any holes in the
defense," Wade said, "or any personnel
we think we match up better against."
It doesn't hurt to have Jason John
son, the Pac-10's second-leading pass
er (310 yards per game), at the helm of
the offense.
"We're able to know when each
other's in trouble," Wade said. "If it's
third down and he's feeling some pres
sure, often I am able to feel that, and I
might snap off a route early. He hits me
on stride every time I get open. Plus,
we're great friends off the field, which al
ways helps."
Wade isn't worried about the speed of
the Cardinal secondary — there's always
a way to get open, he said.
"Every [cornerback] in the Pac-10 is
fast. I'he big deal is how aggressive they
might play," Wade said.
"If you've got a corner who might
jump a route early, you want to expose
the leverage that they're playing. Inside,
outside, how deep they're playing [off
the snap], all those things go into trying
to get open. If we see a corner who might
not flip his hips right, we might really at
tack that corner with the deep ball."
Like Stanford, Arizona is off to an 0-2
start in conference play, but the Wildcats
haven't yet relinquished their postseason
hopes.
"This is a must-win for us," Wade said.
"You go 0-3 in the beginning of the Pac,
it's a hard hole to fight out of, [and] we

have high goals here still."
Wade chuckles when asked if he en
joys playing in such a tough conference.
"You get beat up a lot, but at the same
time, it's fun, exciting and just a great
conference to play in,"he said. "It's real
ly unpredictable."
Saturday's match-up figures to be an
intense one, as the two teams both try to
seize one oi their best opportunities of the
Pac-10 season to walk away with a win.
"We've got to really try to establish
something here to try to be a force later
in the Pac-10," Wade said. "We've been

in every game we've played ... We've
just got to be able to finish the game."
Though he wants the Wildcats to im
prove a run game that ranks dead last in
the Pac-10 with only 79 yards per game,
Wade isn't worried about the passing
game being disrupted.
Arizona head coach John Mackovic
doesn't blame Johnson for throwing to
Wade so often.
"We really like to spread it around
more, but Jason has a lot of confidence in
