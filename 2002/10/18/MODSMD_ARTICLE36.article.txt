# The 						Bay Area just can't match SoCal
## 
### 
It's now official. With the
Anaheim Angels in the
World Series, Southern Cal
ifornia will be voting on
Nov. 5 to secede from Northern
California.
Those of us lucky enough to be
from the bottom half of the Gold
en State have always had the hotter
girls, better weather and Tijuana.
The only thing we were lacking
was a good baseball team. We sat
down there and bided our time.
We watched the Padres have
one good year and reach the
World Series. Watched the
Dodgers acquire and trade away
what seems like every All-Star in
Major League Baseball, yet still fail
to win a playoff series. Sure, we
wore San Francisco Giants' hats
and cheered for Barry Bonds. We
saw the Oakland A's make the

postseason every
year. We thought
to ourselves, "It's
alright if my team
can't make the
playoffs, at least
there's a Califor
nia team in
there."
But we forgot
about our Angels.

Turns out all that the Rally
Monkey needed was a former
Dodger as manager and a 5-foot-7
shortstop. So in the largest display
of bandwagon jumping since Cal's
sudden football fans, those Dodger
caps have been cast aside and trad
ed in for Halos. Did anyone even
know an Angels fan, let alone the
name of an Angels player, three
weeks ago?
But we'll put that question aside

and our surfboards away fora
week and enjoy another champi
onship season in Los Angeles. Be
cause we've liked the Angels all
season long, or at least we'll party
that way when we win.
It's only fair that we now have
the best baseball team in the world.
Shaq and Kobe were getting lone
ly, and they'll welcome Garret An
derson and Jarrod Washburn to
the top of the sports kingdom.
Of course, an Angel victory will
make little sister NorCal second
best in two sports. The team from
Sacramento can tell you that
much. Besides, the Kings are the
ugliest team in sports and don't fit
into the new-look California that
we will be creating. Sacramento
was never a good capital anyway —
too many cowbells and players
from Eastern Europe. Malibu will

do much better.
Governor Schwarzenegger will
rule from a lifeguard tower. Sena
tors Pamela Anderson and Kathy
Ireland will do a fine job convinc
ing Congress that secession is good
for the nation. Besides, they won't
be much more annoying than
Boxer and Feinstein, and they
could probably sway a few more
high-up people in Washington
with their California charms, if you
know what I mean.
We've got the college sports
thing covered, too. With Stanford
football and basketball both in the
midst of rebuilding and Cal being
Cal, UCLA and (JSC are looking
pretty good for the next few years.
And the East Coast recruiting will
be a lot tougher when you have to


Matt Long
tell the recruits, "You're just
gonna love California Adjacent."
Trust us, California was too big
for the both of us anyway, and
you'll have the Sears Cup and the
Golden State Warriors up here to
cherish. We may miss your water
supply, but we drink Perrier down
there anyway.

Beyond that, we can still send
our kids to Stanford, vacation in
Tahoe and use your electricity
when we run our air conditioners
too long.
So NorCal, you can keep that
rusty bridge, Gray Davis and Fres
no.
Now if we could just talk you
out of those Raiders.

litical science. What, the Angels haven't
won yet? Just give them six games.
