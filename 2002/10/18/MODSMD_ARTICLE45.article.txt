Interpol
Turn On The Bright Lights

Let's face it folks. If the Strokes weren't
acting like rock stars on MTV and in every
single issue of" Rolling Stone" since the mid
dle of 2001, they wouldn't have incurred
the wrath of indie snobs everywhere. That
the Strokes were the first band to break out
of New York City as part of this whole rock
revival thing only means they are destined
to be the first victims of an inevitable back
lash. Of course this type of thing happens all
the time; it even killed a gny named Kurt
Cobain. Yes Kurt, you were at least partially
right. Success often sucks eggs.
Interpol comes at the heels of Manhat
tan's Strokes and Brooklyn's Yeah Yeah
Yeahs. Their debut full-length has been re
viewed in every magazine imaginable: from
the hip online indie publication Pitchfork to
the decidedly less-hip Entertainment Week
ly. And no matter which review you read
(including this one), the reviewer will men
tion that Interpol sounds eerily similar to
joy Division. As if anyone who reads Enter
tainment Weekly knows who the hell lan
Curtis was.
A word from the wise (or at least the
jaded): When the first record you release on
an independent label gets reviewed in both
Entertainment Weekly and Stuff, rest as
sured that the backlash is coming.
Well, when I first heard Interpol's
" PDA," I actually thought it was a remix of a
Joy Division track. To be frank, I was both
excited and disappointed to learn the truth.
Don't get me wrong. Interpol is a good
band that has put out an excellent debut.
"Turn On The Bright Lights" happens to

do the Joy Division dance

quite well. Even its cover
art resembles that of Joy

Division's seminal debut, "Unknown Plea
sures." Singer Paul Banks' manic-depres
sive delivery is a spot-on lan Curtis impres
sion that occasionally morphs into a de
mented David Byrne, especially on the ter
rific "Obstacle 1."
The album's songs are often compelling.
"NYC" is a vague indictment of the cruel re
alities that accompany living in a big city.
"Hands Down" is downbeat, bleak sound
scape of thin electric guitars and the deep,
slight throb of drums layered over hazy vo
cals. A few of the songs mix this gloomy vi
sion with a tender romanticism. On both
"Stella Was A Driver And She Was Always
Down" and "Obstacle 2" the group weaves
paranoia and despondency into a lush
melody.
Interpol doesn't disappoint because they
are a bad band. On the contrary, "Turn On
The Bright Lights" is evidence of real com
petence. They simply can't get beyond their
obvious influences.
Joy Division's music was a dark, brood
ing, minimalist vision of a harsh world. Even
when the band managed to rock out (on
"Love Will Tear Us Apart," "Transmission,"
and "Shadowplay"), the songs were still
painfully sad and even more depressing still
when you stop to think that they were the
expressions of a very disturbed man, the
enigmatic singer lan Curtis. Interpol's
songs are often cold and detached, but they
still seem calculated, and they don't break
new ground on their own.
It's probably unfortunate that Interpol
has been lumped with the Strokes as New
York's Next Big Thing because Interpol
shows much more promise than that. With
both bands, the question is how long they
can keep up the act. The "Bright Lights" are
on, and they're turned way up. Despite the
quality of this debut, the pressure is on al
ready for Interpol to dig itself out of the hole
it has created. If one thing is clear

it's that the backlash from this

album could sting very, very
hard.
