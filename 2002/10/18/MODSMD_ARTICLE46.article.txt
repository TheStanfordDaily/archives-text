# Apples are round, red and rockin'

### KEVIN LIM 
Thus far, the life of The Apples in Stereo
has been a fairy tale of happy indie rock.
Apples in Stereo was conceived in 1991
when Beach Boys fans Jim Mclntyre and
Robert Schneider met on a Denver bus, and
decided to form a cheery rock beacon in the
dreary sea of grunge. Since then, Apples
frontman Schneider has watched things
blossom around him. As the Apples in
Stereo grew, so did the adoration from a
growing indie crowd. In 1999, Robert mar
ried Jim's roommate and Apples drummer
Hilarie Sidney, and on Christmas Day in
2000, the couple welcomed a son, Maxwell.
Apples in Stereo recently emerged from
parental leave by scoring a soundtrack hit,
"Signal in the Sky (Let's Go)" with the "Pow
erpuff Girls" cartoon.
The Apples in Stereo have showed no
signs of getting old, and having a son and
earning Cartoon Network success has only
served to foster their youthful force and
glee. Their bright orange, brand new album
is aptly named "Velocity of Sound." The
wild, 11-track ride rushes in, rarely slows,
and is gone before the listener is ready to
grab hold. The presentation of the album is
as appropriate for the label of some
ephedrine tonic as it is for this latest, most
frenzied of the Apples in Stereo albums.
The first track on the album is "Please."
And that high nasal sound isn't the result of
some chaotic Doppler effect, as the liner art
and album title would lead you to believe
that's Robert. While first-time Apples in
Stereo listeners bob their heads and focus
on the nearly cartoonish vocals, those famil
iar with this band will note the fuzzier, edgi
er, more dominant guitar setting on which
Robert's voice dances. While the tracks no
longer let the guitars flutter freely (see

The Apples in Stereo
Velocity of Sound

2()00's trip "The Bird That You Can't See"),
they're not simply flat, low-profile plat
forms. For example, watch the guitars do a
bit of country line dancing in "Rainfall" and
"Better Days," the seconci and seventh
tracks. There is a lack of tempo change; the
fifth track "Where We Meet" may be an at
tempt at a dreamy downer, but seems more
like a forceful speed-freak trying to play it
cool and rock slow after being pulled over
the pace police. Bassist Eric Allen's first
crack at lead vocal is a treat, as his relatively
deadpan voice navigates the edgy, giddy
hooks, giving us some basis to admire
Schneider's high, hold-your-nose good vo
cals. Pause and imagine Schneider taking
on his best friend, Neutral Milk Hotel's Jeff
Mangum, at a high, nasal yodelfest.
As tickets to a yodelfest would probably
be tough to sell, the Apples have a hard time
selling some of their teenage-angst-driven
lyrics. "Dagger" and "trigger" threats on
the fourth track "Do You Understand" just
seem implausible, as does Allen's supposed
desire to press in his heart until nothing re
mains. For the most part, the upbeat, play
ful and successful band sticks to what ii
knows: quirky observations, the tough
kinks of relationships and wonderful
hodgepodge imagery. The Beach-Boys
eque ba-ba-ba on "Baroque" is unquestion
ably Apples. The songs have uniformly
been infused with rougher guitar punch,
but their old selves are there. Sporadically
the forcefulness is a welcome addition, but
over the course of "Velocity of Sound" the
tracks don't really jump out as a result of
this. On top of that, the album is so short
that it's over before the listener can try to
find some variance.
"Velocity of Sound" is what fans knew
the Apples in Stereo could pack in: an exu
berant 29-minute blast of giddy fuzzy rock.
And while fans have to love the confirma
tion that geeks can indeed rock, this dose of
confirmation is a bit much, and not charac
teristic of the diversity that fans are accus
tomed to seeing from the Apples in Stereo.


The Apples in Stereo smiling happily despite onset of baldness and failing sight.

cals. Pause and imagine Schneider taking
on his best friend, Neutral Milk Hotel's Jeff
Mangum, at a high, nasal yodelfest.
As tickets to a yodelfest would probably
be tough to sell, the Apples have a hard time
selling some of their teenage-angst-driven
lyrics. "Dagger" and "trigger" threats on
the fourth track "Do You Understand" just
seem implausible, as does Allen's supposed
desire to press in his heart until nothing re
mains. For the most part, the upbeat, play
ful and successful band sticks to what ii
knows: quirky observations, the tough
kinks of relationships and wonderful
hodgepodge imagery. The Beach-Boys
eque ba-ba-ba on "Baroque" is unquestion
ably Apples. The songs have uniformly
been infused with rougher guitar punch,
but their old selves are there. Sporadically
the forcefulness is a welcome addition, but
over the course of "Velocity of Sound" the
tracks don't really jump out as a result of
this. On top of that, the album is so short
that it's over before the listener can try to
find some variance.
"Velocity of Sound" is what fans knew
the Apples in Stereo could pack in: an exu
berant 29-minute blast of giddy fuzzy rock.
And while fans have to love the confirma
tion that geeks can indeed rock, this dose of
confirmation is a bit much, and not charac
teristic of the diversity that fans are accus
tomed to seeing from the Apples in Stereo.


The Apples in Stereo smiling happily despite onset of baldness and failing sight.
