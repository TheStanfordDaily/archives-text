# Sunday's Best: Straight up Emo to the izo
## 
### TAM VO 
rhe title of the Los Angeles-based band
Sunday's Best debut full-length release in
2000, "Poised to Break," ironically almost
became a self-fulfilling prophecy. In just
over a year's time, the band endured a
horrible 15 month long fall tour, the loss
of two booking agents, the departure of a
founding member (who was also the pri
mary songwriter), and their share of di
vorce and rehab. Most bands would have
called it quits, but after going into hiber
nation fora short while and regrouping
and adding members, Sunday's Best came
back with their second full length on
Champaign, Illinois based Polyvinyl
Records, " The California!!." This 10 song
CD is a 40-minute display of one of the
best upcoming bands.
The four-member team of Sunday's
Best has often been hidden behind well
known artists like Bright Eyes, Piebald,
Onelinedrawing and label mates Rainer
Maria, Aloha and Mates of State. They
have proven themselves by making real
music with intricate weavings of passion
and struggle. Blending folk and emo/
indie rock with a heavy dash of emotion,
Sunday's Best has created a testament to
their trial and tribulations in recent times.
Then-bassist now turned singer / guitarist
Ed Reyes explains: "It was definitely the
idea of coming back from adversity." He
became intrigued with the idea of Califor
nia, and more specifically Los Angeles, as

Sunday's Best
The Californian

"a place where you can get lost and fall
and get up again."
No two songs are alike, but all incorpo
rate the best of what the members of Sun
day's Best have to offer — Ed Reyes' lan
guid vocals, Tom Ackerman's powerful
drumming, lan Moreno's hook-laden
guitar riffs, and new bassist James
Tweedy's smooth bass lines. Together, all
10 songs come together like a storybook,
detailing the personal experiences of the
band, with each song telling an integral
part of a larger story. Sunday's Best, with
songs ranging from new Americana style
on "Beethoven St." to straightforward
rocking out on tracks such as "Our Left
Coast Ambitions" and laidback melodies
on. "If We Had It Made," prove that they
will not be pigeonholed into a single cate
gory. "The Try" reflects the hardship en
dured for the band in recent months, with
heartfelt lyrics such as: "Do we get no
points for the try? They will all testify that
everything falls around you." Reyes
speaks of how joyful it would be to run
from the law in "IfWe Had It Made," and
takes the time to quote great movies such
as "The Getaway" and"The Great Es
cape." Some of the best lyrics on the album
are in "Brave, but Brittle," as the lyrics
speak for themselves: "You're just one

more habit that I have to kick."
Listening to this CD as 1 struggled to
get through 400+ pages of "The
Odyssey" for I-Hum. it wasn't difficult to
see how "The Californian" was somewhat
of an epic in itself— melding images of
defeat and redemption with love and
hope, promises of a new start, a story of
how a band stuck together and grew older
and wiser through it all. You would've
thought that their story ended there, as I
did, but drummer Tom Ackerman re

cently decided to leave the band, shortly
after the completion of The Californian."
Being no stranger to such happenings,
however, Sunday's Best is undeterred,
and Ed Reye's lyrics echo their determi
nation to go on — "Hard luck never
stopped me from taking risks. Never
stop." This band has so much more to
offer, and definitely should not be over
looked. Sunday's Best needs no points for
the try, for they have succeeded in getting
back up after a long, hard fall.
