# Attack of the Gallaghers

"I may have woman problems, but I
can still be a bloody rock star."
That pitiable insistence summarizes
Noel Gallagher's lyrical vision on "Hea
then Chemistry." After the clutter that was
"Be Here Now" and the dullness of a fa
tally arrogant "Standing on the Shoulder
of Giants," Oasis needs a return to form.
Noel, their principal songwriter, knows it.
It is painfully evident that "Heathen
Chemistry" constitutes Noel's attempt to
regain the swagger of "Definitely Maybe"
and the good of rock-and-roll that was
"Morning Glory." The result is a work
manlike re-hashing of every single trick in
a book Noel stopped writing in 1995. In
the end, Noel is dependent on the rest of
the band to redeem the album.
Everyone points out that they steal the
Stooges' guitar riffs on "Hung In A Bad
Place," and borrow the melody of the Bea
tles' "Rain" for"( Probably) All In The
Mind." We've resigned ourselves to "trib
utes" like that. But homage is no excuse
for recycling your own lyrics. Issuing the
exact same command to "get on your
knees and pray" in "Forces of Nature"
that he did in "Gas Panic," Noel pettily
scolds a socialite (who may or may not be
his ex-wife; who cares?) and also lends a
new spin to the derivativeness we used to
tolerate.
Liam Gallagher was one reason why we
previously accommodated Noel's obses-

sive lifting. When Oasis has succeeded, it
has been because Liam's demonic larynx
gave life to Noel's rousing choruses. But
the one song on "Heathen Chemistry"
most touted by Oasis as a potential soccer
stadium classic — "Stop Crying Your
Heart Out" — is not even as rabble-rous
ing as an Aerosmith power ballad. Noel
gives Liam and England's soccer hooli
gans hardly anything to work with. We've
come to expect a certain heady arrogance
from an Oasis anthem ("We're gonna live
forever!"). Instead, what Noel gives us are
lame exhortations to "hold on." As if we
didn't already have enough of that from
Britrock's ambassadors to America — U2.
Exactly how Liam's snarly defiance fits
into U2's bleeding-heart sensibility, I'm
not quite sure.
Reassuringly, the listeners aren't the
only ones aware of Noel's increasing falli
bility. The addition of guitarist Gem
Archer and bassist Andy Bell means every
one knows what they're doing. Ironically,
it's the new guy who writes the other kind
of song Noel used to be responsible for.
Archer's "Hung In A Bad Place" channels
the frenetic drug-fuelled rush that domi
nated the band's earlier days. Thankful
for the chance, Liam lets rip with his most

driven vocal since he urgently demanded,
"IVYou Know What I Mean?"
Fora fan weaned on "Definitely
Maybe," the most tragic realization is that
Oasis still has it in them. There's more
cause for hope and a sixth album. Sand
wiching disappointing stabs at lost glories
are two pieces that are as simultaneously
menacing and emotional as the best of
them. "The Hindu limes" kicks off the
album with a pummelling guitar rumble,
laced with enough explosive feedback to
remind Radiohead of what rock-and-roll

used to sound like. "Better Man" closes
"Heathen Chemistry" with yet another re
minder that Liam is a latter-day rock
shaman, summoning the spirits of rawk
while accompanied by screaming guitars
and thundering drums. "Heathen Chem
istry" might not be the great comeback
Oasis has been hoping for, but the album
showcases an Oasis v2.0 that can with
stand the stumbling of the man who used
to provide its direction. I think that's good
news, though not as good as I would've
hoped.




The new Oasis: matching glasses, matching ratty hair do's, matching gaunt faces
