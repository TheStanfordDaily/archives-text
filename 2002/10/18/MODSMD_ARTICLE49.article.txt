Jonathan Jackson spent most of his teens
playing Lucas "Lucky" Spencer on the soap
opera "General Hospital." It was a role that
earned him six Daytime Emmy nominations
and three wins.
It also earned him a chance to get cast in
movies — most notably, "Camp Nowhere"
(1994) with Christopher Lloyd, "The Deep
End of the Ocean" (1999) with Michelle
Pfeiffer and "Insomnia" (2001) with Robin
Williams.
Now Jackson, 20, is starring in the new
movie "luck Everlasting," which opens to
morrow and is based on the much-acclaimed
novel by Natalie Babbit.
Jackson was promoting the film at the Ritz
Carlton in San Francisco last month. He
looked casual, in jeans and a leather jacket,
and was accompanied by two publicists, a
make-up artist and his wife.
Had you read the book before accepting
the role? I asked him.
"I read the book while we were shooting
the movie," he said.
What did you think?
"It was great. It was awesome. There were
little differences, but it stayed pretty close to
the book."
I don't agree.
The novel, by Babbit, is an engaging para
ble that deals with mature themes like loss,
mortality and redemption. The movie, pro

duced by Walt Disney, is glossier — and
comes off as a cross between "The Adven
tures of Huck Finn" and "Swiss Family
Robinson."
In the movie, Jackson's character, Jesse
Tuck, is elevated to the lead role. There's also
an added love story between him and Winnie
(Alexis Bledel), which ultimately works be
cause both actors exude a strong on-screen
chemistry.
I asked him if he believed fans of the book
would find the adaptation faithful.
"Yeah. I do. Because everything other
than the love story — which I think is the
heart of the movie-is very faithful."
And the end? That was changed too,
wasn't it?
"I think they just wanted the movie to
have a little more excitement."
The film's biggest selling point is the sup
porting cast-which includes Sissy Spacek,
William Hurt and Ben Kingsley. I asked
Jackson about the mood on the set.
"Sissy is very professional, in a good way.
She really feels the scenes out. William is
very philosophical and intellectual. Kings
ley is very rehearsed; he's very technical
and prepared in how he does his work.
They all work very differently, but it was
fun to see."
Jackson has made his share of headlines in
the last few years.
In 1999, Newsweek reported that he
had virtually clinched the role of Anakin
Skywalker in the second "Star Wars"
movie, "Episode II: Attack of the Clones."
Instead, the part went to Hayden Chris
tensen.
"I don't know how it happened," Jackson

said, when addressing the conjecture made
by Newsweek.
Had you met with George Lucas?
"No. I was never a 'Star Wars' fan, so I
wasn't really passionate about it. I would
have gotten passionate about it, if I had got
ten it. But I wasn't really really hoping to get
it."
There was also some talk when Jackson
got married earlier this year to Lisa Vultag
gio, who played FBI agent Hannah Scott on
the soap opera "Days of Our Lives." He's 20.
She's nine years his senior.
Were you worried about the way the press
would handle the age difference? I asked.
"Not really," he said. "The people who
know me and know her know that it makes
sense. It's a healthy thing not to over read
your own press. I keep up on it to see what's
going on, but I don't read all of it ."
Since he left "General Hospital" in 1999,
Jackson has remained busy — starring in a
handful of smaller films and playing with
his rock band, Scarlet River, which includes
his older brother Richard Lee Jackson
("Saved By the Bell: The New Class") as the
drummer.
He discussed some of their musical ambi
tions.
"I think music is a little different for us
than other people," he said. "We don't nec
essarily want to rival the pop stars and stuff.
We want to have a little more influence with
it, like opening for some really great rock
bands and playing around."
So far, the group hasn't signed with a
mainstream label. All records released are
sold via their Web site, www.jackson-broth
ers.com/scarletriver.html.


Jackson loves nature more than he loves the ladies. Bledel looks on jealously.

Jonathan Jackson spent most of his teens
playing Lucas "Lucky" Spencer on the soap
opera "General Hospital." It was a role that
earned him six Daytime Emmy nominations
and three wins.
It also earned him a chance to get cast in
movies — most notably, "Camp Nowhere"
(1994) with Christopher Lloyd, "The Deep
End of the Ocean" (1999) with Michelle
Pfeiffer and "Insomnia" (2001) with Robin
Williams.
Now Jackson, 20, is starring in the new
movie "luck Everlasting," which opens to
morrow and is based on the much-acclaimed
novel by Natalie Babbit.
Jackson was promoting the film at the Ritz
Carlton in San Francisco last month. He
looked casual, in jeans and a leather jacket,
and was accompanied by two publicists, a
make-up artist and his wife.
Had you read the book before accepting
the role? I asked him.
"I read the book while we were shooting
the movie," he said.
What did you think?
"It was great. It was awesome. There were
little differences, but it stayed pretty close to
the book."
I don't agree.
The novel, by Babbit, is an engaging para
ble that deals with mature themes like loss,
mortality and redemption. The movie, pro

duced by Walt Disney, is glossier — and
comes off as a cross between "The Adven
tures of Huck Finn" and "Swiss Family
Robinson."
In the movie, Jackson's character, Jesse
Tuck, is elevated to the lead role. There's also
an added love story between him and Winnie
(Alexis Bledel), which ultimately works be
cause both actors exude a strong on-screen
chemistry.
I asked him if he believed fans of the book
would find the adaptation faithful.
"Yeah. I do. Because everything other
than the love story — which I think is the
heart of the movie-is very faithful."
And the end? That was changed too,
wasn't it?
"I think they just wanted the movie to
have a little more excitement."
The film's biggest selling point is the sup
porting cast-which includes Sissy Spacek,
William Hurt and Ben Kingsley. I asked
Jackson about the mood on the set.
"Sissy is very professional, in a good way.
She really feels the scenes out. William is
very philosophical and intellectual. Kings
ley is very rehearsed; he's very technical
and prepared in how he does his work.
They all work very differently, but it was
fun to see."
Jackson has made his share of headlines in
the last few years.
In 1999, Newsweek reported that he
had virtually clinched the role of Anakin
Skywalker in the second "Star Wars"
movie, "Episode II: Attack of the Clones."
Instead, the part went to Hayden Chris
tensen.
"I don't know how it happened," Jackson

said, when addressing the conjecture made
by Newsweek.
Had you met with George Lucas?
"No. I was never a 'Star Wars' fan, so I
wasn't really passionate about it. I would
have gotten passionate about it, if I had got
ten it. But I wasn't really really hoping to get
it."
There was also some talk when Jackson
got married earlier this year to Lisa Vultag
gio, who played FBI agent Hannah Scott on
the soap opera "Days of Our Lives." He's 20.
She's nine years his senior.
Were you worried about the way the press
would handle the age difference? I asked.
"Not really," he said. "The people who
know me and know her know that it makes
sense. It's a healthy thing not to over read
your own press. I keep up on it to see what's
going on, but I don't read all of it ."
Since he left "General Hospital" in 1999,
Jackson has remained busy — starring in a
handful of smaller films and playing with
his rock band, Scarlet River, which includes
his older brother Richard Lee Jackson
("Saved By the Bell: The New Class") as the
drummer.
He discussed some of their musical ambi
tions.
