### ERIC ELDON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate
Senate and the Graduate Stu
dent Council have both unani
mously approved an ASSU exec
utive committee response to the
Office of University President
John Hennessy's newly intro
duced labor-policy proposal.
The response reads, in part:
"The ASSU will not comment on
the policy itself because it is our
position that stakeholders
should be actively involved in
University decision-making
rather than incorporated at the
end of such a process."
Earlier this month, the Univer
sity administration had asked for
the ASSU to develop a feedback

process and issue a statement on
the "Proposed living Wage and
Benefit Guidelines for Stanford
Contractors" developed by the
Office of the University President
The guidelines included a

minimum $ 10.10 hourly wage with
benefits, or a minimum $11.35
hourly wage without benefits for all
workers covered by the policy.
"One problem we have with the
policy is that we don't know who
exactly the policy covers," said
Anna Mumford, a member of the
Stanford Labor Action Coalition.
"As far as we can tell, it doesn't
cover very many workers at all."
Some of those explicitly not cov
ered in the policy include unionized
workers, temporary workers and
workers at the Stanford Hospital.
"We appreciate the ASSU send
ing us their statement on the living
wage policy, but we have only just
received the statement and want to
give it a full and careful review,"

said Gordon Earle, the University's
vice president for public affairs.
"We expect to have our response
ready as soon as possible."
In its response, the ASSU made
recommendations for additional
steps to be taken by the administra
tion in creating a campus living
wage policy.
The ASSU requested that the
administration "make the data that
informed the creation of the pro
posed policy available to the gener
al university community" and sug
gested the formation of "a standing
University committee, consisting of
workers, faculty, administrators
and students, and empower it to
make decisions on this and future
university labor policies."
"The administrations has two
ways with which to get policy devel
opment feedback," said ASSU Pres
ident and executive committee
member Monica Henestroza.

"First, they can involve the student
body in the generation of policies;
second, they can develop policies
and then test them out with the stu
dent body. In this case, they chose
the second option."
Graduate Student Council
Deputy Chair and Executive Com
mittee member Elizabeth Marin
said, "Given [our] established focus
and our limited time and person
power, we strongly feel that the
GSC as a body would not be the
best source of graduate student
input on the living wage issue."
Marin also noted that "repeated
ly, and most recently in a meeting
with [Vice Provost of Student Af
fairs] Gene Awakuni this afternoon,
GSC Chair Grace Chang and I have
encouraged the administration to
set up such a committee through
[the Nominations Commission] to
guarantee informed student input
on the proposed living-wage policy."
