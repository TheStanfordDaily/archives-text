### ANTHONY HA 
"Bowling for Columbine," the latest doc
umentary from writer / director Michael
Moore, is a disturbing and thought-pro
voking film. It uses the April 20, 1999
shootings in Columbine High School as a
launching pad for an examination of the
United States' culture of violence and fear,
an examination that ultimately indicts both
the oppressive foreign and domestic poli
cies of the U.S. government and the "if it
bleeds it leads" hysteria-mongering mass
media.
Highlights include a hilarious, viciously
right-on cartoon that condenses hundreds
of years of bloody American history into a
few short minutes, an interview with a sur
prisingly articulate Marilyn Manson and
Moore's climactic confrontation with Na
tional Rifle Association President Charlton
Heston. "Bowling for Columbine" some
times suffers from a lack of coherence and
focus, and it definitely raises more ques
tions than it answers, but the movie truly
engages the viewer, forcing you to confront
the issue of guns in the United States and

why we are so goddamned violent.
"Bowling for Columbine" was screened
at this year's Cannes Film Festival — the
first documentary at the festival in 42 years
— where it won a Special 55th Anniversary
Prize. The film opens today in the Bay
Area.
I participated in a round-table discus
sion with Moore last Friday. The interview
was held in San Francisco's very swanky
Ritz Carlton Hotel, a fact that was not lost
on Moore.
"I love the irony of it, don't you?" he
asked. "They finally let us into the big
house!"
In person, Moore closely resembled his
on-screen persona. He was very funny and
very articulate, but he would often launch
into unrelated and unprovoked rants on
whatever topic caught his attention. His an
swers were peppered with self-deprecation,
but he was clearly very proud of the work
that he has done. Some of the college re
porters in the room seemed to view Moore
with something approaching awe; when he
first entered, there was a spontaneous
round of applause, and the interview

ended with several autograph requests..
When asked about why he chose to make
a film about the Columbine shootings,
Moore noted, "I have to say that this issue of
violence has been with me a long time, since
I was a kid."
He went on to describe walking out of
mass on April 4,1968 and hearing that Mar
tin Luther King, Jr., had been shot.
"And a cheer goes up amongst many of
the people," he said. "All white, of course —
suburbs, you know. It's like burning. I'm 13
years old, you know?... And that was just
one of those moments. I thought, 'Look at
these adults! Who are these people? They
just came out of mass!'"
As for the reaction that he hopes "Bowl
ing for Columbine" will provoke, Moore
said, "I want you to go to this film, and when
you walk out you're going, 'Holy fuck! Can
you fucking believe that guy said that? I
can't fucking believe you can get a gun in a
bank!' That's what I want you to leave with,
you know?
" 'Can you believe Kmart did this? Can
you believe Heston said that the problem
with America is its mixed ethnicity?' It's like
one horror thing after another! And you
need to go somewhere and talk for an hour.
Boy, if that happens, home run in my head,
right? That you are actually thinking and
you're talking to whoever about what you
just saw."
One of the big targets of Moore's film is

what he sees as a culture of fear, a culture
fed and nurtured by the practices of the
mass media.
"Hate does well, violence does well," he
said. "Tolerance and understanding does
less well in the ratings ... Marilyn Manson's
whole thing about how they keep all of us so
whipped into such a state of panic and fear.
And not just fear of crime, but fear of, The
girl won't like me because I've got pimples.
I need to buy this, buy this, get that, get that,
look this way, get these clothes.' it's like,
whoa, man! It's amazing more of us don't
kill ourselves."
"Bowling for Columbine" also asserts a
close connection between violence at home
and abroad. For example, the film opens by
noting that the day of the Columbine shoot
ings was also the day of the highest casualties
in the U.S. bombing of Kosovo.
"I couldn't get my hands on it, but Dylan
[Klebold], one of the kids at Columbine, the
week before the shooting, had written a
poem about the bombing in Kosovo,"
Moore said. "1 think that especially on kids,
I don't think any of that's lost on them at all.
1 think that if your dad goes off to build MX
missiles every day, I think especially on chil
dren, that that's not lost on them."
He added, "I'm not saying that there's an
A to B connection: because they build mis
siles in Littleton, therefore there's a school
shooting. I'm just saying that we should take
a look at how we weave violence into the
very fabric of our culture."
This argument has been heavily criti
cized in several reviews of "Bowling for
Columbine" in the American press. The
New York limes, for example, described
Moore's "What a Wonderful World"-
scored montage of U.S. intervention in
other nations — ending with footage of the
Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade
Center and the subtitle "Osama bin Laden
uses his expert CIA training to murder
3,000 people" — as "idiocy...hardly worth
engaging."
"Well, it's a tough and bitter pill to swal
low, isn't it, Mr. New York Times?" Moore
said. "I'm sorry I gotta be the doctor to dis
pense the pill, you know, but that's the
case."
Another criticism directed at Moore's
films is that they're actually about Moore
rather than about the issues that they os
tensibly address. Some say that the point of
"Bowling for Columbine" is not to under
stand the extraordinarily high murder rate
in the United States, but to watch and cheer
as Moore and surviving victims of the
Columbine shooting successfully demand
that Kmart stop selling bullets.
"It's an odd criticism," he said. "If you
look like me, would you have this incredi
ble ego where you'd want to see yourself
blown-up 40-feet on a movie screen? 'Oh,
put me in another shot, I look so good
there, ah!' I'm sitting in the other room
going, 'Oh fuck!' you know?
"I can't stand it. That's a horrible, horri
ble feeling. You'd have to live your life in
my body to understand this. 1 have a little
sign that I put on my edit room door,
'When in doubt, cut me out.' Seriously, you
can call the editor and ask him. Rule one: I
believe a little bit of me goes a long way.
People are going to the movies that's visu
ally pleasing, and they're hoping to have
sex afterwards, and they do not want the
image of this guy in their heads, you
know?"
When pressed on the issue, Moore
added, "Well, OK, right, here's the mes
sage: I am there as your stand-in. I'm just in

there for you, OK? If I have any kind of role,
it'sjust for some lucky, stupid reason I get to
make my movies, and I get them distributed
by Hollywood studios...
"It is rare that someone from the working
class ever gets to see themselves, truly them
selves, not some caricature of themselves, on
the screen or on the tube. So I am there, re
ally, just as a representative for that mass au
dience out there who wants to sit there and
cheer me on and live vicariously through
me as 1 go after the bastards that have
ripped them off, have stolen their pension
funds, have just made their life miserable."
And how does Moore respond to those
who say that he's just another leftist propa
gandist?
"Good!" he said. "Proud leftist propa
gandist. Closet Communist."
Given this year's success of Moore's best
selling book "Stupid White Men," one has to
wonder which medium Moore prefers:
print or film?
"Film," he answered immediately. "I
think the visual medium is much more gal
vanizing to people. Millions are going to see
this film, hundreds of thousands are going
to read the books. It's a big difference."
Moore has no formal t raining as a film di
rector, and in fact dropped out of college
after one year. He said that he began work
ing on his first movie, "Roger and Me" (a
documentary exploring the effects of large
layoffs by General Motors in Moore's home
town of Flint, Mich.), simply because he was
angry.
"I just got mad one day,"he said. "Roger
Smith was laying off some more people at
General Motors, my hometown. 1 said, '1
want to make a movie about this.' I didn't
know anything about making a movie."
Moore argued that this lack of education
has, in fact, benefited him as a filmmaker.
"I don't organize my thoughts in some
kind of way like I'm writing a paper or a the
sis," he noted. "I keep myself very open,
very loose, the chaos theory at work, you
know? And 1 also cop this attitude that mis
takes are good and that's how you learn.
School punishes you. If you have a wrong
answer, they flunk you."
Moore said that he hopes "Bowling to
Columbine" is a call to action, particularly
against what he sees as the violent, repres
sive actions of U.S. President George W.
Bush and his administration. A UC-Berke
ley reporter asked Moore what type of ac
tion and resistance he had in mind.
He responded, "I was thinking about
that while I was making this film, 'I gotta
make sure that people don't leave the the
ater feeling more helpless.' I need you to
leave feeling angry and talking to other
people about what we've got to do.
"Here's what I believe: I believe a few
people can make a difference. You do not
need to get the whole Berkeley campus in
volved in this. You've got to quit feeling this
sense of despair that 'the students who go
to my school are all apathetic.' Of course
they are. The students 100 years ago were
all apathetic. The people 1,000 years ago
were all apathetic. People have always been
apathetic, I think it'sjust our human nature
to be apathetic. Don't worry about that.
"If you and three friends just did some
thing, just something that was so audacious,
that was so out-the-of-ordinary, to make
your point, to make your stand, to do what
ever that is. I can't tell you exactly what it is,
you'd have to kind of come up with this
yourself, you know? Those things all make
a difference, because it inspires other peo
ple to do something."

town of Flint, Mich.), simply because he was
angry.
"I just got mad one day,"he said. "Roger
Smith was laying off some more people at
General Motors, my hometown. 1 said, '1
want to make a movie about this.' I didn't
know anything about making a movie."
Moore argued that this lack of education
has, in fact, benefited him as a filmmaker.
"I don't organize my thoughts in some
kind of way like I'm writing a paper or a the
sis," he noted. "I keep myself very open,
very loose, the chaos theory at work, you
know? And 1 also cop this attitude that mis
takes are good and that's how you learn.
School punishes you. If you have a wrong
answer, they flunk you."
Moore said that he hopes "Bowling to
Columbine" is a call to action, particularly
against what he sees as the violent, repres
sive actions of U.S. President George W.
Bush and his administration. A UC-Berke
ley reporter asked Moore what type of ac
tion and resistance he had in mind.
He responded, "I was thinking about
that while I was making this film, 'I gotta
make sure that people don't leave the the
ater feeling more helpless.' I need you to
leave feeling angry and talking to other
people about what we've got to do.
"Here's what I believe: I believe a few
people can make a difference. You do not
need to get the whole Berkeley campus in
volved in this. You've got to quit feeling this
sense of despair that 'the students who go
to my school are all apathetic.' Of course
they are. The students 100 years ago were
all apathetic. The people 1,000 years ago
were all apathetic. People have always been
apathetic, I think it'sjust our human nature
to be apathetic. Don't worry about that.
"If you and three friends just did some
thing, just something that was so audacious,
that was so out-the-of-ordinary, to make
your point, to make your stand, to do what
ever that is. I can't tell you exactly what it is,
you'd have to kind of come up with this
yourself, you know? Those things all make
a difference, because it inspires other peo

Writer/director Michael Moore blocks cache of guns from view.
"Bowling for Columbine," the latest doc
umentary from writer / director Michael
Moore, is a disturbing and thought-pro
voking film. It uses the April 20, 1999
shootings in Columbine High School as a
launching pad for an examination of the
United States' culture of violence and fear,
an examination that ultimately indicts both
the oppressive foreign and domestic poli
cies of the U.S. government and the "if it
bleeds it leads" hysteria-mongering mass
media.
Highlights include a hilarious, viciously
right-on cartoon that condenses hundreds
of years of bloody American history into a
few short minutes, an interview with a sur
prisingly articulate Marilyn Manson and
Moore's climactic confrontation with Na
tional Rifle Association President Charlton
Heston. "Bowling for Columbine" some
times suffers from a lack of coherence and
focus, and it definitely raises more ques
tions than it answers, but the movie truly
engages the viewer, forcing you to confront
the issue of guns in the United States and

why we are so goddamned violent.
"Bowling for Columbine" was screened
at this year's Cannes Film Festival — the
first documentary at the festival in 42 years
— where it won a Special 55th Anniversary
Prize. The film opens today in the Bay
Area.
I participated in a round-table discus
sion with Moore last Friday. The interview
was held in San Francisco's very swanky
Ritz Carlton Hotel, a fact that was not lost
on Moore.
"I love the irony of it, don't you?" he
asked. "They finally let us into the big
house!"
In person, Moore closely resembled his
on-screen persona. He was very funny and
very articulate, but he would often launch
into unrelated and unprovoked rants on
whatever topic caught his attention. His an
swers were peppered with self-deprecation,
but he was clearly very proud of the work
that he has done. Some of the college re
porters in the room seemed to view Moore
with something approaching awe; when he
first entered, there was a spontaneous
round of applause, and the interview

ended with several autograph requests..
When asked about why he chose to make
a film about the Columbine shootings,
Moore noted, "I have to say that this issue of
violence has been with me a long time, since
I was a kid."
He went on to describe walking out of
mass on April 4,1968 and hearing that Mar
tin Luther King, Jr., had been shot.
"And a cheer goes up amongst many of
the people," he said. "All white, of course —
suburbs, you know. It's like burning. I'm 13
years old, you know?... And that was just
one of those moments. I thought, 'Look at
these adults! Who are these people? They
just came out of mass!'"
As for the reaction that he hopes "Bowl
ing for Columbine" will provoke, Moore
said, "I want you to go to this film, and when
you walk out you're going, 'Holy fuck! Can
you fucking believe that guy said that? I
can't fucking believe you can get a gun in a
bank!' That's what I want you to leave with,
you know?
" 'Can you believe Kmart did this? Can
you believe Heston said that the problem
with America is its mixed ethnicity?' It's like
one horror thing after another! And you
need to go somewhere and talk for an hour.
Boy, if that happens, home run in my head,
right? That you are actually thinking and
you're talking to whoever about what you
just saw."
One of the big targets of Moore's film is

what he sees as a culture of fear, a culture
fed and nurtured by the practices of the
mass media.
"Hate does well, violence does well," he
said. "Tolerance and understanding does
less well in the ratings ... Marilyn Manson's
whole thing about how they keep all of us so
whipped into such a state of panic and fear.
And not just fear of crime, but fear of, The
girl won't like me because I've got pimples.
I need to buy this, buy this, get that, get that,
look this way, get these clothes.' it's like,
whoa, man! It's amazing more of us don't
kill ourselves."
"Bowling for Columbine" also asserts a
close connection between violence at home
and abroad. For example, the film opens by
noting that the day of the Columbine shoot
ings was also the day of the highest casualties
in the U.S. bombing of Kosovo.
"I couldn't get my hands on it, but Dylan
[Klebold], one of the kids at Columbine, the
week before the shooting, had written a
poem about the bombing in Kosovo,"
Moore said. "1 think that especially on kids,
I don't think any of that's lost on them at all.
1 think that if your dad goes off to build MX
missiles every day, I think especially on chil
dren, that that's not lost on them."
He added, "I'm not saying that there's an
A to B connection: because they build mis
siles in Littleton, therefore there's a school
shooting. I'm just saying that we should take
a look at how we weave violence into the
very fabric of our culture."
This argument has been heavily criti
cized in several reviews of "Bowling for
Columbine" in the American press. The
New York limes, for example, described
Moore's "What a Wonderful World"-
scored montage of U.S. intervention in
other nations — ending with footage of the
Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade
Center and the subtitle "Osama bin Laden
uses his expert CIA training to murder
3,000 people" — as "idiocy...hardly worth
engaging."
"Well, it's a tough and bitter pill to swal
low, isn't it, Mr. New York Times?" Moore
said. "I'm sorry I gotta be the doctor to dis
pense the pill, you know, but that's the
case."
Another criticism directed at Moore's
films is that they're actually about Moore
rather than about the issues that they os
tensibly address. Some say that the point of
"Bowling for Columbine" is not to under
stand the extraordinarily high murder rate
in the United States, but to watch and cheer
as Moore and surviving victims of the
Columbine shooting successfully demand
that Kmart stop selling bullets.
"It's an odd criticism," he said. "If you
look like me, would you have this incredi
ble ego where you'd want to see yourself
blown-up 40-feet on a movie screen? 'Oh,
put me in another shot, I look so good
there, ah!' I'm sitting in the other room
going, 'Oh fuck!' you know?
"I can't stand it. That's a horrible, horri
ble feeling. You'd have to live your life in
my body to understand this. 1 have a little
sign that I put on my edit room door,
'When in doubt, cut me out.' Seriously, you
can call the editor and ask him. Rule one: I
believe a little bit of me goes a long way.
People are going to the movies that's visu
ally pleasing, and they're hoping to have
sex afterwards, and they do not want the
image of this guy in their heads, you
know?"
When pressed on the issue, Moore
added, "Well, OK, right, here's the mes
sage: I am there as your stand-in. I'm just in

there for you, OK? If I have any kind of role,
it'sjust for some lucky, stupid reason I get to
make my movies, and I get them distributed
by Hollywood studios...
"It is rare that someone from the working
class ever gets to see themselves, truly them
selves, not some caricature of themselves, on
the screen or on the tube. So I am there, re
ally, just as a representative for that mass au
dience out there who wants to sit there and
cheer me on and live vicariously through
me as 1 go after the bastards that have
ripped them off, have stolen their pension
funds, have just made their life miserable."
And how does Moore respond to those
who say that he's just another leftist propa
gandist?
"Good!" he said. "Proud leftist propa
gandist. Closet Communist."
Given this year's success of Moore's best
selling book "Stupid White Men," one has to
wonder which medium Moore prefers:
print or film?
"Film," he answered immediately. "I
think the visual medium is much more gal
vanizing to people. Millions are going to see
this film, hundreds of thousands are going
to read the books. It's a big difference."
Moore has no formal t raining as a film di
rector, and in fact dropped out of college
after one year. He said that he began work
ing on his first movie, "Roger and Me" (a
documentary exploring the effects of large
layoffs by General Motors in Moore's home
town of Flint, Mich.), simply because he was
angry.
"I just got mad one day,"he said. "Roger
Smith was laying off some more people at
General Motors, my hometown. 1 said, '1

know anything about making a movie."

put me in another shot, I look so good
there, ah!' I'm sitting in the other room
going, 'Oh fuck!' you know?
"I can't stand it. That's a horrible, horri
ble feeling. You'd have to live your life in

People are going to the movies that's visu

When pressed on the issue, Moore
added, "Well, OK, right, here's the mes

"Good!" he said. "Proud leftist propa

Given this year's success of Moore's best
selling book "Stupid White Men," one has to
wonder which medium Moore prefers:
print or film?
"Film," he answered immediately. "I
think the visual medium is much more gal
vanizing to people. Millions are going to see
this film, hundreds of thousands are going
to read the books. It's a big difference."
Moore has no formal t raining as a film di
rector, and in fact dropped out of college
after one year. He said that he began work
ing on his first movie, "Roger and Me" (a
documentary exploring the effects of large
layoffs by General Motors in Moore's home
town of Flint, Mich.), simply because he was
angry.
"I just got mad one day,"he said. "Roger
Smith was laying off some more people at
General Motors, my hometown. 1 said, '1
want to make a movie about this.' I didn't
know anything about making a movie."
Moore argued that this lack of education
has, in fact, benefited him as a filmmaker.
"I don't organize my thoughts in some
kind of way like I'm writing a paper or a the
sis," he noted. "I keep myself very open,
very loose, the chaos theory at work, you
know? And 1 also cop this attitude that mis
takes are good and that's how you learn.
School punishes you. If you have a wrong
answer, they flunk you."
Moore said that he hopes "Bowling to
Columbine" is a call to action, particularly
against what he sees as the violent, repres
sive actions of U.S. President George W.
Bush and his administration. A UC-Berke
ley reporter asked Moore what type of ac
tion and resistance he had in mind.
He responded, "I was thinking about
that while I was making this film, 'I gotta
make sure that people don't leave the the
ater feeling more helpless.' I need you to
leave feeling angry and talking to other
people about what we've got to do.
"Here's what I believe: I believe a few
people can make a difference. You do not
need to get the whole Berkeley campus in
volved in this. You've got to quit feeling this
sense of despair that 'the students who go
to my school are all apathetic.' Of course
they are. The students 100 years ago were
all apathetic. The people 1,000 years ago
were all apathetic. People have always been
apathetic, I think it'sjust our human nature
to be apathetic. Don't worry about that.
"If you and three friends just did some
thing, just something that was so audacious,
that was so out-the-of-ordinary, to make

you'd have to kind of come up with this

Writer/director Michael Moore blocks cache of guns from view.
"Bowling for Columbine," the latest doc
umentary from writer / director Michael
Moore, is a disturbing and thought-pro
voking film. It uses the April 20, 1999
shootings in Columbine High School as a
launching pad for an examination of the
United States' culture of violence and fear,
an examination that ultimately indicts both
the oppressive foreign and domestic poli
cies of the U.S. government and the "if it
bleeds it leads" hysteria-mongering mass
media.
Highlights include a hilarious, viciously
right-on cartoon that condenses hundreds
of years of bloody American history into a
few short minutes, an interview with a sur
prisingly articulate Marilyn Manson and
Moore's climactic confrontation with Na
tional Rifle Association President Charlton
Heston. "Bowling for Columbine" some
times suffers from a lack of coherence and
focus, and it definitely raises more ques
tions than it answers, but the movie truly
engages the viewer, forcing you to confront
the issue of guns in the United States and

why we are so goddamned violent.
"Bowling for Columbine" was screened
at this year's Cannes Film Festival — the
first documentary at the festival in 42 years
— where it won a Special 55th Anniversary
Prize. The film opens today in the Bay
Area.
I participated in a round-table discus
sion with Moore last Friday. The interview
was held in San Francisco's very swanky
Ritz Carlton Hotel, a fact that was not lost
on Moore.
"I love the irony of it, don't you?" he
asked. "They finally let us into the big
house!"
In person, Moore closely resembled his
on-screen persona. He was very funny and
very articulate, but he would often launch
into unrelated and unprovoked rants on
whatever topic caught his attention. His an
swers were peppered with self-deprecation,
but he was clearly very proud of the work
that he has done. Some of the college re
porters in the room seemed to view Moore
with something approaching awe; when he
first entered, there was a spontaneous
round of applause, and the interview

ended with several autograph requests..
When asked about why he chose to make
a film about the Columbine shootings,
Moore noted, "I have to say that this issue of
violence has been with me a long time, since
I was a kid."
He went on to describe walking out of
mass on April 4,1968 and hearing that Mar
tin Luther King, Jr., had been shot.
"And a cheer goes up amongst many of
the people," he said. "All white, of course —
suburbs, you know. It's like burning. I'm 13
years old, you know?... And that was just
one of those moments. I thought, 'Look at
these adults! Who are these people? They
just came out of mass!'"
As for the reaction that he hopes "Bowl
ing for Columbine" will provoke, Moore
said, "I want you to go to this film, and when
you walk out you're going, 'Holy fuck! Can
you fucking believe that guy said that? I
can't fucking believe you can get a gun in a
bank!' That's what I want you to leave with,
you know?
" 'Can you believe Kmart did this? Can
you believe Heston said that the problem
with America is its mixed ethnicity?' It's like
one horror thing after another! And you
need to go somewhere and talk for an hour.
Boy, if that happens, home run in my head,
right? That you are actually thinking and
you're talking to whoever about what you
just saw."
One of the big targets of Moore's film is

what he sees as a culture of fear, a culture
fed and nurtured by the practices of the
mass media.
"Hate does well, violence does well," he
said. "Tolerance and understanding does
less well in the ratings ... Marilyn Manson's
whole thing about how they keep all of us so
whipped into such a state of panic and fear.
And not just fear of crime, but fear of, The
girl won't like me because I've got pimples.
I need to buy this, buy this, get that, get that,
look this way, get these clothes.' it's like,
whoa, man! It's amazing more of us don't
kill ourselves."
"Bowling for Columbine" also asserts a
close connection between violence at home
and abroad. For example, the film opens by
noting that the day of the Columbine shoot
ings was also the day of the highest casualties
in the U.S. bombing of Kosovo.
"I couldn't get my hands on it, but Dylan
[Klebold], one of the kids at Columbine, the
week before the shooting, had written a
poem about the bombing in Kosovo,"
Moore said. "1 think that especially on kids,
I don't think any of that's lost on them at all.
1 think that if your dad goes off to build MX
missiles every day, I think especially on chil
dren, that that's not lost on them."
He added, "I'm not saying that there's an
A to B connection: because they build mis
siles in Littleton, therefore there's a school
shooting. I'm just saying that we should take
a look at how we weave violence into the
very fabric of our culture."
This argument has been heavily criti
cized in several reviews of "Bowling for
Columbine" in the American press. The
New York limes, for example, described
Moore's "What a Wonderful World"-
scored montage of U.S. intervention in
other nations — ending with footage of the
Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade
Center and the subtitle "Osama bin Laden
uses his expert CIA training to murder
3,000 people" — as "idiocy...hardly worth
engaging."
"Well, it's a tough and bitter pill to swal
low, isn't it, Mr. New York Times?" Moore
said. "I'm sorry I gotta be the doctor to dis
pense the pill, you know, but that's the
case."
Another criticism directed at Moore's
films is that they're actually about Moore
rather than about the issues that they os
tensibly address. Some say that the point of
"Bowling for Columbine" is not to under
stand the extraordinarily high murder rate
in the United States, but to watch and cheer
as Moore and surviving victims of the
Columbine shooting successfully demand
that Kmart stop selling bullets.
"It's an odd criticism," he said. "If you
look like me, would you have this incredi
ble ego where you'd want to see yourself
blown-up 40-feet on a movie screen? 'Oh,
put me in another shot, I look so good
there, ah!' I'm sitting in the other room
going, 'Oh fuck!' you know?
"I can't stand it. That's a horrible, horri
ble feeling. You'd have to live your life in
my body to understand this. 1 have a little
