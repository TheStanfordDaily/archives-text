# Madonna says:
## Make me a star, Guy, or your pretty face is going to hell 
### ERICK FLORES 
Madonna has aged like a fine wine — the
greater the age, the better the taste. Most

would agree with this insofar as her

music goes, but now she has finally in-

vested herself in a movie project

that, while by no means establish
ing her as a Shakespearean ac-

tress, lias at least given
her a credit compara-

ble to other; more

mediocre broads
like Cameron

Diaz.
In her
latest en
dea v or
"Sw e p t
Awav,"

Madonna plays Amber, a first-class rich bitch
whose bitterness, whining, and Versace out
fits get her nowhere when she becomes
stranded on a deserted island with her Ital-

ian ship servant (Adrianno C.i
annini). The film, a remake

of a 1975 flick by Lina
Wertmuller, inverts the

classic Cinderella
paradigm —

instead
telling a
riches-to-

rags story in
which the
diva is

knocked
off her

soap-

box and humbled in the process, all while
falling in love with the very man on whose
face she once spit. Although the story sounds
cheesier than the singer's infamous faux
British accent, the film makes sense and the
plot is as cohesive and complete as any other
A-list movie out there.
It probably helps that the movie is direct
ed by Madonna's lnibbie Guy Ritchie, the
British filmmaker who has created a follow
ing with such cult favorites as "Snatch" and
"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels."
Able to read her better than any of the other
directors she has worked with, Ritchie
makes up for his wife's limited acting chops
with several tricks that have worked for him
in the past. He sticks to a simple directing
format reminiscent of golden-age cinema,
uses excellent cinematography and paces
the movie by interspersing drama with just
the right amount of comic relief that comes
in the form of slapstick and oddball humor
typically unseen in the work of American
filmmakers.
Madonna fans and critics alike will be
swept away by "Swept Away." Haters will be
astonished when they learn that she finally
doesn't suck on the big screen, and lovers will
enjoy the details and lines that pay homage

to, or poke fun
at, the per
former's career.
For instance, she
drops a line
about the neces
sity of spirituality
juxtaposed with
one about the

logic or capitalism in a "material world." She
also gives a spiel about being a forty-some
thing competing with the looks and youth of
today's 18 year olds. But Britneys of the
world beware: Madonna's bikini-clad body
will leave you in shame and send you straight
to ihe gym faster than you can say "hit me
baby, one more time."
It's unfortunate that Madonna's past
film failures will most likely overshadow
the triumph of this feature. And my reluc
tance to give it a four-star rating rests on
this precedent, as insurance that this film
is not just "good fora Madonna movie."
Whether you see it in a theater or wait for
video — watch it. It preserves the star's
status as reigning queen of pop culture
and gives us another sneak peak into her
bottomless bag of attention-grabbing
tricks.
