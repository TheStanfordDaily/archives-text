# 8 Women, one dead body
## 
### TRACEY NYBERG 
When I walk out of (he the
ater after seeing "8 Women," re
ality seems a little bit more banal.
People aren't randomly break
ing into song, clothes don't look
as if they were designed with
Technicolor film in mind, and
no one indulges in and exhibits
all their neuroses. Trying to pic k
a genre that this film falls under
is impossible; for while it draws
from the drama, comedy, sus
pense, and musical, "8 Women"
mocks all these genres as well as
the society we inhabit.
Enlisting the help of eight of
the best French actresses from
three generations, Francois
Orzon does a wonderful job of
directing them in this very odd
film. An adaptation from the
Robert Thomas play, the scene is
set in the late fifties at a French
mansion in the country. With
the entire family gathering for
Christinas, the family patriarch,
Marcel, is found stabbed in his
bed. Isolated from the outside
world due to a snowstorm, the
eight women of the house must
discover who among them is the
culprit. Everyone is a suspect —
the matriarch and wife of the de
ceased, Gaby (Catherine

Deneuve); the two teenage
daughters, Suzon and Catherine
(Virginie Ledoyen and Ludivine
Sagnier); Gaby's infirm mother,
Mamy (Danielle Darrieux);

Gaby's neurotic sister Au-

gustine (Isabelle

Huppert); the t
cook Chanel
(Fir mi n e
Richard); the
beautiful maid
Louise (Em
tnanu e 1 1 e
Heart); and the
dead man's es-

tranged sister, Pierrette (Fanny
Ardant).
All of these women have the
motive and opportunity to kill
Marcel. In an interesting direc
torial choice, we only catch a
glimpse of Marcel's face at the
end of the film, despite the nu
merous flashbacks to the events
of the night before. This re
quires the audience to form its
own opinions of the characters
of the eight women, heighten
ing the sense of isolation the
women feel.
In case you think the film is
getting too serious, Orzon has
included original musical num
bers that are part interpretive
dance, part nursery school

rhyme. Each woman has her
own song, with each song ex
pressing her peculiar situation.
The plot twists and turns
until you cannot keep it

straight (which, by the
way, many of the women

are not). The situations the

characters find them
selves in are hilarious in
a laugh-until-your-side
hurts kind of way. The
first 15 or 20 minutes re
quire an adjustment to
the comic book feel of
the film, as well as the

very bizarre characters that in
habit it. The best performance
and character in the film is
Aunt Augustine, a hypochon
driac who immerses herself in
romance novels to escape her
boring life. She accuses every
one of trying to hurt her, and
actress Isabelle Huppert gives
her enough soul to be laugh
able but not pathetic. The dy
namics between the women are
the central conflict of the film,
so much so that it becomes ir
relevant who killed Marcel.
This bizarre film is easy to over
look, but it should be given a fair
chance — you will either love it
or hate it, but you'll never know
which unless you give it a try.



If you could be murdered by one of these French hotties, which would you pick?
