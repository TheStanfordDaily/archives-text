## Diesel simmers hot, Malkovich suffers from ugly comb-over

"Knockaround Guys" is a film made by guys, for guys
and starring guys. From a female perspective, this makes
it a bit of a think piece and a lot of eye-candy.
"Knockaround Guys" is a drama focusing on the tensions
between fathers and sons, the old generation and the

new, and the city and the coun
try. As the story develops,
these tensions build and finally
converge in a final showdown.
The film revolves around
Matty (Barry Pepper), who
feels forced into following in
the footsteps of his father,
Benny Chains (Dennis Mop
pet). The problem is that
Matty's father is a bigwig in a

Brooklyn crime ring. At first
Benny does not have faith in his son, but Matty's Uncle
Teddy (John Malkovich) convinces Benny to give Matty
a shot.
Matty enrolls the help of his three best friends, who are
from very different backgrounds. Seth Green nicely por
trays Marbles, the doofiis with the heart of gold; newcom
er Andrew Davoli plays a luscious Scarpa; and the action
star of the summer, Vin Diesel, flexes all his muscles as Tay
lor. When Marbles panics and loses the money, the four
friends must travel to Montana to reclaim it, leading to the
conflict between a greedy sheriff and the four heroes.
The movie is not an action / adventure flick. In fact, di
rectors Brian Koppelman and David Levien have only
left in the barest minimum of action. 1 appreciated the

low body count and found the sparse
violence more effective as I was saved
from being desensitized halfway
through the film. Diesel does get to
flex his muscles, and I have to say

that no one takes his coat offlike him — the man

lias the arms of a Greek god! In addition to
providing some appealing visuals, Diesel de-

velops the character of Taylor into a sympa
thetic individual struggling with serious
inner demons. Malkovich is also excellent in
his role as Uncle Teddy, although he has a

bad comb-over that upstages him in many

scenes — the hairstylist 011 this film
should have been fired.

Unfortunately, much of the film

could use a lot of work. The dia
logue is well written, but the pac
ing is too slow to maintain interest.
The lighting is very dark, and
even in a pitch-black theater it was
a struggle during some of the
scenes to discern what was going
on. There is a distinction between
the pace of the city and the coun
try that Koppelman and Levien
really draw out — from the pace
of life to the dialect to the isola
tion. Koppelman and Levien I
also wrote the screenplay, and

while their investment in the charac
ters is apparent, some of the scenes are
unnecessary while others drag on for

too long. The transformation that
Taylor and Matty undergo is pro-

found, but it feels like it would play
better on the stage rather than the
screen. The advertising campaign
for the film leads one to expect a lot
of action, which is misleading.
There are a number of good per
formances, and while I don't rec
ommend you run out to see this
film like it's the greatest thing to

happen to cinema since E.T., it is an interesting film that
can be appreciated by a
broad audience.
