# 'Bloody Sunday' emotional, relevant and moving
## 
### RANDY MANO 
Perhaps your world history courses were
different from mine, but in school I learned
very little about that fateful Bloody Sunday
in Northern Ireland, 1972. In one dav on

the streets of Derry, British soldiers shot 27
unarmed civilians — and killed 14 — during
what was supposed to be a peaceful, though
forbidden, march for civil rights. We all
know what has developed in that region
since then: the unfolding of a violent cam-

paign by the Irish Republican Army over

the past 25 years.
I couldn't help but think
about national and world
events while at the screen
ing. A well-crafted movie,

"Bloody Sunday"
pushed me to con
sider first and fore
most the war on ter
rorism and the war
on Iraq. I am not a

peacenik, per se, but I do hold guard
ed support for the Bush administra
tion's expansion of military and pres
idential powers over our economy,
educational system and other
branches of government. Seeing the
result of organizational theory unfold
in sharply edited, crisp images on the
big screen drove me to question fur
ther whether the U.S. — with British
support — is opening up a Pandora's
Box and driving the world closer to a
global war.
Writer-director Paul Greengrass
has chosen to focus on four individ
uals to retell the events of that day.
One of the 10,000 civilian marchers
was Gerry Donaghy (Declan Duddy,
whose uncle died on Bloody Sun
day), a 17-year-old Catholic who
wants to settle down with his Protes
tant girlfriend. Ivan Cooper (James

Nesbitt), the idealistic Civil Rights
leader, is a Protestant trying to lead
he angry Catholics on a peaceful
march through Derry.
On the loyalist side is Brigadier
Patrick MacLellan (Nicholas Far
rell), who faces immense pressure
to stop the march as commander
of the British Army in Londonder
ry (that's right, two names for the
same town). One of the 3,000
British soldiers is a young radio

operator who is ordered into the heart of
the conflict amongst his experienced
Paras.
The low-budget production looks and
feels great. Tons of extras pulled from the
towns of Derry and Dublin help flesh out
the re-enacted march against internment,
and ex-soldiers — many of which were sta
tioned in Northern Ireland — have no
problem acting out one more military ex
ercise for the sake of cinema.
"Bloody Sunday" often utilizes quick
edits and a hand-held camera to make the
action seem more realistic and in-your
face. History and art-house fans are not the
main target of this film; instead, this British
production would be most appreciated by
a growing populace concerned with the
use of violence to solve disputes. And as an
exclamation mark to the film, a live version
of the powerful U2 song "Sunday Bloody
Sunday" unfolds during the credits.


And the battle's just begun,there's many lost, but tell me who has won?'
