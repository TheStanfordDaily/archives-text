# Ace of Base: Awesome or genius?
## 
### ALICE KIM 
This is the fourth in a series of arti
cles railed "'The Record Bin"exploring
classic albums from the past.
Do you know what I listened to
the summer before middle school
started and everything turned crap
taculous? What I would listen to in
the car while the wind tossed my
hair and I felt cool, even though it
my brother's car and I was 11 years
old? It was Ace of Base's only hit
album, "The Sign."
Possibly all of you will think I am
lame.
I was in sixth grade. My parents
fought all the time, my cat got lost, I
wore horrible fake-ass velvet green
babydoll dresses to school, and ap
peared younger than everyone else
(it is the Asian Aging Complex: You
look approximately 5 years
younger than non-Asians until the
age of 30, at which point you look 30
forever and ever, until you get so
old that no one can tell if you're
Asian or not. Yeah!) The world was
pretty gross.
That was the time and the place.
But more importantly, that was the

RECORD BIN
Ace of Base
The Sign
1993

music. The best music in the world
at the time was from Ace of Base.
The song 1 loved most, THE
SONG, because it was in constant
rotation 011 the radio, because 1
could sing with it in a high, unap
pealing falsetto, was"The Sign."
Plus it had lyrics like "Under the
pale moon/For so many years I've
wondered who you are/How could
a person like you bring me
joy?/Under the pale moon/Where 1
see a lot of stars/Oooooo," which
have a spectacular ESL-quality, as if
those seductive, flaxen-haired
dorks cobbled together lyrics from
American candy wrappers.
Ace of Base songs were hit-mak
ers, and I must mention another hit
from the album, "All That She
Wants." This one is equipped with
correspondence school English as
well, with lines such as "It's a day for
catching tan"(H!) and the unforget
table chorus, ".Ml that she wants/Is an
other baby/she's gone tomorrow
but/all that she wants/Is another

baby/Whoa." This,
I think, under
standably confused
the hell out of me,
because I thought
that meant the
"she" in question
wanted to get preg
nant, and wouldn't
my parents get
mad at me for lis
tening to songs
about wanting to
birth a baby, and
what's more, it
wouldn't even the
first one? I was 11,
after all.
Another ab
solutely great and
happy thing is that
this song and al
most all of the

other songs on " The Sign" are fla
vored with European reggae synth
beats, which are decidedly not fat,
but I love them. Iliere is even a
banghra version of "All That She
Wants" tacked onto the end of the
album, which is actually quite awful
because the original is so genius. It
replaces some of the European
synth with crazv style Indian techno,

but the happily threatening atmos
phere of the original, its well as the
line about catching tan, are missing.
It follows that after a while, I for
got about Ace of Base fora long
time. However.
At a karaoke session last year,
accidentally enough, a group of us
sang "The Sign." "I saw the
sign/And it opened up my eyes and

I am happy now living without you
... "It was the part at which Jenny
or Linn or maybe both of them
sing an octave or so higher, and the
boys were straining to sing it, and
so were the girls, and no one knew
where to sing the all-important
"Oooooohs" and we sounded like
shit.
It was good to be back.
