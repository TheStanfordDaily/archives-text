### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
/t's 8 o'clock Saturday morn
ing when the noises begin.
You are still sleepy and hung
over enough to think it's a
dream. But when the rhythmic
banging of the bed-frame next
door speeds up, certain realities of
dorm life can no longer be ig
nored. Then it really starts. OH!
OH YES BABY! HELL YEAH!
RIDE ME! I II 111 111 UH UH
(grunt grunt grunt) OHHHH
YES! YES! YES! AIY
EEEEEEEEEEEE
Let's get real here. While your
neighbor on the football team
may be getting some, the some
that he's getting is very likely fake.
The good news is, while a
woman's orgasm can be almost as
mysterious and elusive as a phallic
symbol hidden in a Disney movie,
that doesn't mean it does not
exist.
Women fake fora variety of
reasons, such as:
1) To make him feel like an
amazing lover, and "reward" him
for his efforts.
2) They want to come but do
not really know what coming is, so
they just act out what they have
seen in the movies.
3) He says things like "Are you
coming? Are you there yet? I want
you to come!" This immediately

sends any chance of a real climax
out the window, but she can't fig
ure out how else to shut him up.
4) He has been going for so
long she has gone numb (Viagra?
Or is he doing calculus problems
in his head?), and there seems to
be no other way to make him stop.
So gentlemen, you want to
know how you can tell if her or
gasm is for real? You are not going
to like the answer: There is no
surefire way you can tell for cer
tain. She is the only one who truly
knows.
112 fowever ladies, it is not in your
best interest to fake. If you do, the
guy will assume that whatever he
was doing is the best way to make
you come. Then he will try to re
peat it even time — this gets old
REALLY fast.
Of course there are certain
things a man should be aware of if
lie wants to help his lady score the
big O. First of all, foreplay is key.
Begin by slowly running your fin
gers over all parts of her body,
paying special attention to her
back, the crook of her elbows, her
neck, and between her thighs.
Kiss her with sensitivity and de
sire. Often women are much more
turned on by deep and thoughtful
kisses, with prolonged eye contact,
than by overly aggressive thrust
ing.
Once she begins to get worked
up, let her rtib herself against your

erection for as long as you can wait
— the more waiting the better.
Tell her how much you want her,
but do not pressure her to go tin -
ther. Wait and wait and wait . . .
soon she will be dying for you.
Enter VERY slowly, and be
sure you are not hurting her.
Then find your rhythm (yes, you
do need one), building from a
slow relaxing pace to something
more vigorous. If you feel you are
coming too fast, try to slow down
or pause entirely and languish in
that feeling of togetherness.
Whatever you do, do NOT put
any pressure on her to have an or
gasm. Pay attention to her breath
ing, and what she truly seems to
enjoy. (If you watch closely
enough, you will not need to do a
lot of asking). Keep kissing her! If
the position is right, try to reach in
and rub her clitoris from the out
side with a constant, firm pres
sure. Let her hand guide you to
the right motion. Most impor
tantly, enjoy yourself. She wants
to please you too.
"Why should I care if she actu
ally comes?" you ask. Besides the
obvious "You are a jerk if it's not
important to you," the best way of
telling ifyou are giving it to her for
real is if she suddenly can't get
enough of it. And if that's the case,
you could be suddenly getting
triple the sex you were having be
fore. Enough said.
