MIAMI, Fla. (AP)â€” A jury
convicted a 22-year-old Miami
man of first-degree murder for
fatally beating his girlfriend's 3-
year-old daughter after she ate a
package of raw sausages he
planned to cook for breakfast.
I'he conviction for the 1998
death of Ashley Smithson car
ries a mandatory life sentence
with no chance for parole for
Juvon Pickett, who also was con
victed of aggravated child
abuse.
Pickett sat motionless as the
jury delivered its verdict after
eight hours of deliberations. His
face showed little reaction as his
attorneys embraced him.
"You've forfeited your right
to live as a free. man," said
Miami-Dade Circuit Judge
Manny Crespo.
Diane Smithson, Ashley's pa
ternal aunt who sat through
every day of the two-week trial,
had a subdued reaction.
"This was over breakfast
sausage," she said incredulous
ly. "Was it worth it? No? Can
you imagine hitting, kickingand
shaking a toddler?"
The child lingered in a coma
fora month after the September

1998 beating, then died in the
arms of a pediatric nurse at
Jackson Memorial Hospital.
Prosecutors charged that
while in a rage over the
sausages, Pickett punched and
shook the child repeatedly and
slammed her head into a wall
and the refrigerator of the Over
town efficiency he shared with
the girl's mother, Pecynthia
Bradley.
Bradley, 28. made a deal with
prosecutors in exchange for her
testimony against Pickett. She
pleaded guilty to manslaughter
and was sentenced to an 11-year
prison term, which she is now
serving.
Bradley told investigators she
watched Pickett beat her daugh
ter but did nothing to stop him
because she feared for her safety.
Pickett's attorneys, public de
fenders Patrick Nally and Tal
itha Leacock, argued that
Bradley was responsible for the
child's death and manipulated
Pickett, who has an IQ of 50,
into taking the blame for the
beating. They said she concoct
ed a story for Pickett to tell po
lice about Ashley getting hurt
during a trip to the park.
