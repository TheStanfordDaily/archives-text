# Union, Bon Appétit make progress in talks
## 
### ERIC ELDON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Bon Appetit management
and SEIU union Local 715
reached agreements on key as
pects of negotiations yesterday
in some of the most fruitful talks
between the parties since they
signed a new contract last
spring. The negotiations were
aimed at resolving claims
brought by union members
against the company for con
tract infringements that they say

occurred on campus this sum
mer.
"The negotiation process
has been ongoing for the past
two months," said Marvin Ro
driguez, Bon Appetit's general
manager on the Stanford cam
pus. "While we can't say any
thing specific [about the new
agreements] at this point, I
haven't felt this positive about
the outcome since the conclu
sion of the negotiations last
May."
Union representative Roxana
Rivera, who was part of the nego
tiations yesterday, said, "We're
happy that they're making a good
faith effort at this point. The
workers are ready to move on
from this struggle."
One issue that has been re
solved was a dispute over health
care benefits. Under the contract
signed last May, Bon Appetit had
agreed to lower the cost of the
health care plan provided to full
time workers.
"Bon Appetit failed to imple
ment the more affordable health
care plan last June," Rivera said,
"but they've gone back and recti
fied the problem, and they're
paying the difference between in
surance premiums. The [work
ers'] checks for this will be going
out tomorrow."
And while many full-time
workers became part-time work
ers this summer as a result of Bon
Appetit's cost-cutting measures —
and so became ineligible for
health benefits — Rivera said that
"as students came back and busi
ness picked up, they were able to
increase many people's hours to
full-time."
"While this is an ongoing
process, and some people are still
working part-time, Bon Appetit is
now committed to finding ways to
restore workers' hours."
Rivera concluded, "We want
both the business and the workers
to thrive."
