# Students react to Barak speech
## 
### SARAH LUSTBADER SAMEER AHMED EDITORIAL STAFF 
Wednesday night, while hun
dreds of Stanford students waited
in line outside Memorial Auditori
um for over an hour to hear former
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
speak, some of their conversations
centered on the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict. After Barak addressed the
packed auditorium, the conflict —

and Barak's view of it — was prac
tically the only thing on most stu
dents' minds.
Before the talk, some students
hoped that Barak's speech would
lead to an open political dialogue
on campus, as well as increased
awareness of the situation in the
Middle East.
"Anything that contributes to
Stanford students' thinking and
talking about this issue is positive,"
said senior Josh Bushinsky.

Law student Ben Radparvar
added that he thought Barak was
"an example of a voice of modera
tion."
Other students worried that
presenting an Israeli speaker
would create an imbalance be
tween supporters of Israel and
Palestine at Stanford.
"To have one side represented
and not the other is dangerous .. .

said senior Seema Ahmad, refer
ring to the more than 50 students
and Bay Area community mem
bers who protested against Barak's
policies before his speech.
Senior Rajaie Batniji worried
that Barak's oratory skills might in
fluence students to support his
view, without giving them a full
picture of the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict. "Barak can be articulate,
convincing and misleading," he
said.
While the atmosphere inside
Memorial Auditorium was calm,
tolerant and respectful during
Barak's talk — with Barak receiv
ing three standing ovations — af
terward, students had strongly di
vergent opinions about the speech.
"I believe [Barak's] message is a
good one for Jewish students on
campus to hear," said Avi Yotam,

president of the Stanford Israel Al
liance. "He is in many ways the
most progressive of the recent Is
raeli prime ministers, and he will
hopefully help bring students to
gether by showing that people on
the left and right of the issue can
work together in unity."
Also supporting Barak's views,
Robert Rudintsky, a doctoral can
didate in applied physics, applaud
ed the former Israeli prime minis
ter's devotion "to the cause of
peace and security in his country."
However, some students were
not as appreciative of Barak's
speech.
"Barak's strong advocacy for lit
erally 'fencing out the Arabs' made
Muslim students in the audience
very uncomfortable," said junior
Ariege Misherghi, president of the
Muslim Students Awareness Net
work. "It was extremely disturbing
to be a witness to his enthusiasm for
this and other policies that were
enacted, which are reminiscent of
apartheid South Africa."
Barak's support for U.S. Presi

dent George W. Bush's war on ter
rorism caused even more debate
among the student body.
While junior Matt Sorlien stated
that Barak's speech made him
more "pro-Israel," he was critical
of Barak's position regarding the
use of force in Iraq. "1 wasn't ready
fora pro-Bush speech," Sorlien
said.
Some students, like senior
Matthew Kraft, expressed even
stronger sentiments. "I was ap
palled by Barak's complete sup
port for what basically amounts to
World War III," he said. "I was
shocked at his resolve and his de
termination that military invasion
of Iraq without Li.N. approval is
the best and the only option."
Other students felt more in
clined to support Bush's foreign
policy after hearing Barak. Bill
Curry, a third-year graduate stu
dent in geophysics, was among
them. "Barak has convinced me
more than anyone else — includ
ing" the president — as to why force
is necessary fin Iraq]."
