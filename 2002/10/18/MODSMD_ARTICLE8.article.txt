# Center adds Eurasia to its expertise
## Five extra fellowships to be offered, Turkish and Kazakh to be taught

On Sept. 1, Stanford's Center
for Russian and East European
Studies changed its title to the Cen
ter for Russian, East European and
Eurasian Studies. CREEES has cre
ated a new postdoctoral fellowship
and will offer new courses.
Jack Kollmann, academic coor
dinator for the center, cited histor
ical reasons for the expansion.
"This is an overdue extension of
the geographic area [covered by
the center 1," he said.
The center has represented
Eurasia since the 19605, and, after

the demise of the Soviet Union,
much of what used to be consid
ered Russia is now considered Cen
tral Asia.
"There is a tradition for combin
ing [Europe and Asia into Eurasia],
at least in a historical view," Koll
mann explained. "Eurasia has a
special connotation. One viewpoint
is to view Russia and Asia as one ge
ographical unit."
Other universities, including
LJC-Berkeley and Harvard, have
also made recent changes reflecting
a broader coverage of the region.
Though the decision to ex
pand the center was made in the
interest of accuracy before Sept.
11,2001, the center has made sev
eral changes as a result of the ter
rorist attacks.
A designated National Resource
Center, CREEES receives funding

from the U.S. Department of Edu
cation through a Title VI grant.
This funding increased after Sept.
11, when Congress voted for addi
tional support for Islamic studies to
enhance the knowledge of Islam in
the United States.
Nancy Kollmann, director of
the center, said that the grant
would be used to fund five
extra fellowships, as well as the
teaching of the Turkish and
Kazakh languages.
"We were able to create a
postdoctoral fellowship in Cen
tral Asian and Islamic studies
and to commission three new
courses," she said.
Eric McGlinchey, a Princeton
scholar in post-Soviet regime
changes in Central Asia, will hold
the new postdoctoral fellowship
and teach a course on Central

Asian politics this winter. John
Dunlop, a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution, will teach a
course on Russia and Islam, also of
fered this winter. Gail Lapidus, a
senior fellow at the Institute for In
ternational Studies, is currently
teaching a new fall course on the
foreign policies of Central Asia.
GREEKS also uses the Title VI
grant to collaborate with the
Stanford Program on Interna
tional and Cross-Cultural Educa
tion. SPICE provides a link be
tween Stanford and secondary
schools by developing curricula
on international and cross-cul
tural topics. CREEES will fund
the development of a new Cen
tral Asian unit, which will educate
intermediate and high school stu
dents on issues of international
conflict in the area.
