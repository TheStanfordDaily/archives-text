# Saddam Hussein remains hidden from the public

BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — His hat? Kevlar-coated
for bulletproofing. His meals? Nibbled by food-tasters
first, sampling for poison. And is it really Saddam
Hussein anyway — or one of his many reported dou
bles, hired to fool would-be assassins?
Contemplating war, Washington has made clear
that this time it's personal: The U.S. goal in any attack
on Iraq would be getting rid of its leader.
But Saddam is taking elaborate steps against being
eliminated — ranging from networks of bunkers,
sleeping compartments on wheels, to unusual head
gear — according to those who've dealt with him and
Western intelligence agencies.
Unseen among his people since December 2000,
the Iraqi leader today appears only on television in
very secure settings. An armed guard stood next to
him during a televised appearance last week before
Parliament.
"This talk of changing regimes, this is a dream. If
they want to talk about a bullet or anything else, it's
just a dream," crowed Parliament member Mo
hammed Mudhafr al-Adhamy, referring to intermit
tent U.S. talk of assassination.
Americans have "been trying and trying for 30
years, and they couldn't do anything. They tried in
1991, and they couldn't do anything," said al-Ad
hamy.
President Bush's administration has been outspo
ken in its aim of ridding Iraq of Saddam, at a U.S.-es
timated price of $9 billion a month for war — or less.
"The cost of one bullet, if the Iraqi people take it on
themselves, is substantially less than that," White
House spokesman Ari Fleischer said early this month.
