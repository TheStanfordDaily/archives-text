SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) â€” Officials at San Fran
cisco-area locations that 2012 Olympics organiz
ers said will house athletes or host events at the
games say they haven't guaranteed the sites are
available.
Trustees with Santa Clara's Mission College
say they were surprised to learn the nonprofit
group trying to bring the games to Northern Cal
ifornia told the United States Olympic Commit
tee the campus would be home to its $47 million
tennis venue.
"It is a completely false presentation," said
trustee Jeffrey Schwartz.
Ihe U.S. Army, which controls the former
base where the Bay Area Sports Organizing Com
mittee hopes to build an $830 million Olympic
village for thousands of athletes and staff, say
they've never said the land was available.
Maj. Jeff Cooper, the Army housing project
manager for Moffet Field, said the land currently
is earmarked for military housing.
"My job as a housing project officer is to ensure
the quality of life for military personnel in the
South Bay," Cooper said.
Officials at Stanford University, the proposed
home of a new $337 million stadium for the
games' track and field events and opening and
closing ceremonies, say they support the plans
but lack approval from trustees or investors.
Directors of the Bay Area's bid committee,
which hopes to beat out New York City to contend
as tfie host of the 2012 games, say although some
plans are uncertain, the proposal also includes fa
cilities like the Oakland Coliseum Arena that al
ready exist or just need minor modification.
