# Bush supports cheaper drugs
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Bush ad
ministration will seek to bring cheaper pre
scription drugs to market more quickly by
blocking pharmaceutical companies from
filing multiple patent-protection lawsuits
that can stall generic drugs for years, ad
ministration officials said yesterday night.
Brand-name drug manufacturers some
limes file lawsuits against generic drug mak
ers poised to put less expensive competitors
on the shelves. The lawsuits invoke the 1984
Hatch-Waxman Act, which was meant to
promote competition in the drug industry
but which also gives the brand-name makers
up to 30 months of additional patent pro
tection while litigation proceeds.
The Federal Trade Commission found
earlier this year that big pharmaceuticals
are increasingly using this tactic to fend off
competition and keep generics out of con
sumers' hands, sometimes for years.
Usually there is no such patent chal
lenge, but in some instances the brand
name makers use the 30-month shield
more than once.
The drug manufacturers sometimes
build their patent lawsuits around what an
administration official called "frivolous" is
sues such as packaging claims.
President Bush was to announce early
today that the administration will move to
limit the brand-name manufacturers to a
single 30-month stay per drug. The admin
istration was also moving to tighten re
quirements and increase disclosure man
dates for drug patent listings.
Prescription drugs are a hot-button issue
in this year's elections. Looking to squeeze
maximum political gain out of the move,
the White House told reporters of its move
in a conference call yesterday night, ensur

ing two days worth of headlines.
I'he administration will announce its in
tentions early this week in the Federal Regis
ter, open the plan up to public comment for
60 days and move to finalize the rule after
that, said a senior administration official.
According to the White House, about
half of all prescriptions are filled with
generic drugs, which cost about a third as
much as brand-name drugs.
The administration estimated the change
would save $3 billion in drug costs per year.
It said the rule would ease the burden on
employers who contribute to prescription
drug coverage, and would make it easier for
the federal government to provide a pre
scription drug benefit as part of Medicare.
The Generic Pharmaceutical Association
said it had not seen the specifics of Bush's
move but had urged the administration to
move in this direction. "The administration
understands the need to address the system
abuses that have delayed affordable phar
maceuticals to consumers," said Kathleen
I). Jaeger, the association's president.
The Senate passed legislation in July to
limit brand-name pharmaceutical compa
nies' usage of patent laws to thwart generic
competition. That bill's sponsor, Sen.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., was skeptical
about the White House move.
"This sounds like an Election Day con
version," Schumer said in a statement yes
terday night. "The devil will be in the details.
"This could be a very good proposal, but
given the White House's track record on
this issue, it could be just another loophole
to let the name-brand drug companies
delay the implementation of generic
drugs," Schumer said. "We'll have to exam
ine the details very closely."
