## The
						Stanford Daily Safety should be a priority for Full Moon participants 
### 
Published Since 1891

In theory the very idea of it is quite
romantic â€” lovers kissing under
the gentle moonlight amidst a sea of
endless stars, a beautiful church
hangs as a backdrop, and all around you
frolicking naked people dance drunken
ly to techno music. Well, on second
thought, Full Moon on the Quad is de
void of all romance.
But if you are a freshman or a senior
(or even a sketchy sophomore or junior,
for that matter), tonight's Full Moon on
the Quad celebration is most probably
atop your list of things to do this evening.
And it should be.
Traditions are important. They keep
us bound to the past and allow us to es
tablish ourselves in that history.

Regardless of how you feel about Full
Moon on the Quad, it's definitely a funny
tradition, one that is specific to Stanford
culture and one that brings a large inter
section of the campus together.
And while it may seem like a complete
ly spontaneous event, a lot of prepara
tion goes into making Full Moon on the
Quad successful and safe.
But before you slap on your strawber
ry lip gloss, or begin to cover your body
with black and white paint in zebra fash
ion, know that safety is a major concern
for tonight's event and that the Class
Presidents as well as the University ad
ministration are making it clear that safe
ty is a priority, as it should be.
The money that the Senior Class Pres

idents raised to make sure Full Moon on
the Quad happened this year will be in
vested in tools that hope to prevent sexu
al assaults from occurring.
The existence of security and addition
al lighting to the Main Quad combine to
make sure that students feel safe and act
as reminders to everyone involved that
although this is a light-hearted event,
sexual assault should not be taken lightly.
Despite your PHE's constant warn
ings, mono isn't the only thing that Full
Moon on the Quad attendees should
worry about. The combination of alco
hol and sexual frustration can some
times be dangerous.
The inherent physical nature of the
event is definitely cause for concern. We

feel that it is important that students
know that there have been past assaults
that resulted from Full Moon on the
Quad and that any future assaults will
threaten our beloved tradition.
Further, we applaud Full Moon on the
Quad organizers for their acknowledg
ment that there are safety risks that war
rant attention.
With that said, Full Moon on the Quad
should be a fun time for everyone in
volved. It should not be an excuse to dis
respect one another.
We urge students to exercise judgment
and caution when attending this event.
Full Moon on the Quad can be a positive
experience for all if personal boundaries
are upheld.
