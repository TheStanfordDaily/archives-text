# 21 AND STILL CLUELESS
## About the word 'about' 
### 
I hate editing. Seriously — it's the
worst part of the writing process. I'm
in a position to know, because a) I'm a
SLE tutor and b) six hours before this
runs, I will be explaining to my editor what
this column is "about."
Practically every waking moment that
we are here at Stanford, we are called upon
to write or speak intelligently. I don't think
I'm alone in saying that sometimes, I don't
know what the hell I'm talking "about."
So here I am, facing the music, giving
my column its last once-over before it goes
to press. My editor asks, "So what exactly is
your piece ABOUT?"
Well, if you'd taken the time to read it,
you'd know! The worst part is, I use the
question myself on my SLE tutees. "So tell
me, what is your paper ABOUT?"

Usually, the problem
is that the writer doesn't
know what the fudge
she's just written (I'm re
ferring to me, here), and
it sucks to have someone
tell you that your writing
isn't clear.
The worst part about
"about" is that the word it-

self is unclear. Formally, "about" means
"around, approximately, or on the verge
(of)," e.g. "All about the mulberry bush," or
"He's about as dumb as bricks," or "I'm
about ready to kick you into next week for
asking me one too many times what my col
umn is about."
Somehow, "about" has also come to
mean "concerning or with regard to,"
e.g. "Let's talk about sex," or "It's all
about me." The meaning is so common
now that it's included in dictionaries,
kind of like "ain't."
If you take into account the formal
meaning of the word, when you say that
you're thinking "about" something,
you're really saying it in almost the
vaguest way possible.
You're thinking around the subject.
Your thoughts approximate the concept.
You're on t he verge of understanding it.
So on Sunday, when my editor asks me
to tell her what my column is "about,"
she's asking me to describe in vague terms
an already vague concept that I stated too
vaguely in the first place in these 900
words.
Maybe it's just appropriate to the evolu
tion of our thought and our language.
Compare Shakespeare with Ibsen: The first
one relies on soliloquy and asides to convey
meaning, while the other builds white ele
phants out of subtext.
Compare classical and modern art. The
former creates specific, detailed images
with technical virtuosity; the latter parlays
the simplest of brush strokes into moun
tains of suggestion.
Subtext and suggestion certainly have
their advantages, for both the author and
the audience.
The artist can draw upon not only her

own vocabulary, but also the language of
collective memory, feeling and myth. An
awkward pause in speech or a woman's un
apologetic gaze can cut to the heart of uni
versal experience, whereas a more explicit
piece loses that link into the imagination
and becomes merely that moment at that
place and time. Specificity cuts the power of
ambiguity.
But in forcing himself to express the
range of human emotions in words and
not silences, Shakespeare created the
greatest lyricism the English language has
ever known. He teased it, tamed it and
when it failed him, he made up new words
to fit his meanings.
Something was lost when we abandoned
language, and I miss it without really ever
knowing what it was.
I wish I could be specific like Shake
speare; I wish 1 had that sort of literary Tal
ent (with a capital T). I also doubt that my
writing is ambiguous on purpose.
If someone doesn't get me, it's probably
not because I was being artistic and subtle.
It's more than likely that I was just too
damn lazy to make myself clear.
Maybe that's just it. Maybe it's sheer
laziness that leads us now to communicate
in fits and starts, in tired cliches, in mum
bled greetings and well-rehearsed con
ventions of wordplay. "What's up." "You
know." "Whatever."
Frankly, I don't think it's a big problem
if one (or all) of my columns doesn't have a
"main idea" with a "topic sentence" and an
"argument." (Don't think I don't know that
you're reading this instead of paying atten
tion to lecture.)
Or maybe our modern linguistic short
hand is a tacit acknowledgment of post
modern ambiguity — a shared under
standing that meaning is always in flux. We
can only talk "about" something because we
will never be able to pin down its Platonic
form with mere words.
I imagine that this would be the case
with most freshman papers. Come on, they
expect you to write something intelligible
on "Augustine's Confessions"? You're 18
years old.
Or maybe we fail to express ourselves
explicitly because we don't know what to
say. That's probably what annoys me so
much, because I have this sneaking suspi
cion that that's the case.
At least with me. Some people seem to
be born with a preternatural verbal facili
ty, as in they can actually write and speak
clearly and concisely. On demand. Usual
ly in class, refuting the stupid, garbled
thing that I just said.
But that's okay, I don't resent it — I ad
mire it. I strive for that. One day, I too will
know how to say what I mean.
