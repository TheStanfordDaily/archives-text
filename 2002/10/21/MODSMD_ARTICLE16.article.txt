Fuel sources article correctly points out
the "expensive infrastructure problem'
Barrett Sheridan's article ("Running
on Low: Auto industry explores alternate
fuel sources," Oct. 18) explores alternate
fuel sources for automobiles. He describes
fuel cell-based cars, which use molecular
hydrogen as a fuel. This would seem to be
an attractive solution to problems of ener
gy conservation and noxious exhaust.
Fuel cells can be very efficient and the
only exhaust is water. Sheridan correctly
points out an expensive infrastructure
problem, fitting gas stations with hydro
gen tanks.
T here is a greater problem. There are
no hydrogen wells. Hydrogen must be
manufactured from hydrocarbons such as
natural gas (methane). This process pro
duces carbon dioxide as a byproduct,
which some deplore, because carbon diox
ide is a major greenhouse gas and is in
volved in global warming.
More significantly, the hydrogen ob
tained from methane contains less energy
than does the methane that would be con
sumed in producing that hydrogen.
There is no free lunch in matters of ener
gy. The entire system must be considered.
Finally I should point out that
petroleum is no longer thought to be de
rived from dinosaurs.

Stanford students have an 'obligation to
speak out 7
Stanford has become more shrill con

cerning the Middle East since Ehud Barak
and 1 attended the school in 1979.
I regard Israel as the Jewish home
land, and it saddens me to hear people
who should know better describe Is
rael as though Jewish history of the
last 3,000 years in the Jewish land did
not occur.
When I was last at Stanford, Moshe
I)ayan, then Israel's foreign minister, was
waiting for the proverbial "phone to ring,"
so that Israel could fulfill its generational
desire to make peace and become an ac
cepted country in the Middle East.
Unfortunately, Israel's somewhat naive
and romanticized view of peace has not
been reciprocated, and has given way to
cold realism.
Arafat claims that Jews have no histori
cal connection to Jerusalem. Arafat used
terror tactically as part of his cunning
diplomacy "for peace" and when Israel
was finally provoked into responding mil
itarily, Arafat appealed to the internation
al community for "protection."
We, as Stanford-educated people, have
an obligation to speak out against these lies
as not only detrimental to peace, but as the
proximate cause of the continuation of the
occupation.
Without these lies, Israel would have
no security problems and no reason to re
main in the West Bank.

SSE refuses to disclose financial records
Six months ago, The Stanford Daily
and Stanford Review jointly requested

several documents from SSE to investi
gate whether SSE's businesses are mak
ing money.
To my surprise, SSE rejected without
comment the argument that, like any
public corporation, SSE should release
basic information about their financial
status — even though the ASSU Consti
tution requires that "all records of any
Association entity must be available for
scrutiny by the public."
Believing that students have a right to
see these documents, The Stanford Daily's
ex Editor-in-Chief Mark Boucher and I
have tried to file a case with the ASSU's
Constitutional Council.
Out of 14 senators, only five, the
bare minimum needed for the case to
go forward, have agreed to allow it to.
We commend them not only for follow
ing ASSU policy, but for standing by
the ASSU Constitution and basic prin
ciples of accountability.
Unfortunately, most senators have not
only tried to block the case, but have either
refused to explain why, or, even worse,
come up with bizarre and forced excuses.
For example, Senator Connie Chen
claims that the ASSU Constitution should
be ignored and that the Undergraduate
Senate can override it by a majority vote.
Senate Chair Bo Cowgill has practically
campaigned against us: While he couldn't
find the lime to explain his refusal to sign
or to clarify what the relevant policies are,
he did find the time to forward the case to
SSE without consent. However Cowgill's
campaign may have been for something
else — the CEO of SSE has since nominat
ed him to SSE's Board of Directors.
