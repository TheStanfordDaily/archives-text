# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Why the Middle East conflict should be important to you 
### MIRIAM WENGER GUEST COLUMNIST 
Why is the Middle East conflict impor
tant to me? I want to give my reasons to the
many people that stopped me in White
Plaza last Friday and asked about the long
line of Stanford community members
waiting to get tickets to heard Ehud Barak
speak on campus. Most had never even
heard of Ehud Barak. Granted, we are all
busy people, but in today's tumultuous
world, we must understand the history
and present politics of Israel and the Mid
dle East. The controversial speech that
Ehud Barak gave Wednesday night at
Memorial Auditorium raised awareness of

this obligation.
1 confess I spent the first two decades
of my life generally apathetic and disin
terested in this conflict. It seemed very far
away and unrelated to my daily life. It was
not until I visited Israel for the first time
last December that it hit home. A soldier
in the Israeli Defense Force, let me hold
his rifle as he explained how he felt the
first time he shot at someone. I could not
get over how different his reality was
from my own.
In the United States, we have taken our
safety for granted fora very long time.
Barak warned us, "You must avoid wishful
thinking. No one really knows how close
Saddam is to a crude nuclear device â€” few

will doubt his willingness to use it."
Sept. 11 was a startling wake-up call for
Americans. The truth is we do not expect
terrorism on U.S. soil, and it still catches us
by surprise.
The American illusion of safety is being
shattered once again by the recent sniper
attacks in Washington, D.C., and the inci
dents in Bali that happened only a few
days ago shows that terrorism is every
where. In Israel, there is no illusion. Acts
of terror occur on a daily basis. People
there live their life by a different set of
rules, where riding the bus means you
could be sitting next to a bomb.
We can look at the Middle East conflict
as a microcosm of what soon could be hap

pening in the United States. "You cannot
solve anything by closing your eyes,"
Barak warns. And if we choose to ignore
the world outside, we are helpless and vul
nerable. Knowledge is our responsibility if
we want to be prepared.
Barak said, "We are not in the Midwest,
we are in the Middle East. It is a tough
neighborhood." In today's age of global
ization, the distance between the two is not
far. With great technological develop
ments, we have become a global village.
What is happening elsewhere in the world
is affecting us more than we realize. We ex
pect the sympathy of the world when ter
rorism happens on U.S. soil.
What entitles us to their compassion if

we do not make ourselves aware that ter
rorism happens to others?
The best reason we need to educate
ourselves about the Middle East conflict is
this: If we wake up to what Barak calls a
"moral imperative of social justice," we can
attempt to create a better world for the
next generation. 1 urge you to ask ques
tions, read newspapers and be aware. The
future of Palestinians, Israelis and Ameri
cans is inextricably intertwined. If we do
not even know what is going on, how can
we begin to search for peace?
