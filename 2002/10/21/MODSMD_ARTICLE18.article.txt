# Baraka urges students to be activists
## Artist and activist Baraka criticizes Bush administration for its policy regarding Iraq 
### ILENA C. GEORGE 
Friday night Amiri Baraka, an African-
American poet, dramatist and activist, asked a
crowd of students and community members
in Kresge Auditorium: "What is art?"
For Baraka, who has been working as an ac
tivist in the creative arts since his play "Dutch
man" helped launch the "black theater" move
ment in 1963, art is a way of life.
"Art means to exist, to create, to be," he
said. "And so after that, what? Well, that's
the point."
The "after that," for Baraka, is activism.
In Baraka's mind, activism and art are al
ways connected.
"There is no such thing as political activism
without art," Baraka said.
During the speech, Baraka read a poem
that he recently wrote about the events of
Sept. 11. The poem, entitled, "Somebody
Blew Up America" repeatedly asks who can
be held responsible for atrocities committed
throughout world history, from American
slavery to the Holocaust.
In the work, Baraka asks, "Who knew the
World Trade Center was gonna get
bombed / Who told 4,000 Israeli workers at
the Twin Towers / To stay home that
day / Why did Sharon stay away?"
Baraka noted that lie has come under in
creased scrutiny since he wrote the poem, and
he has been accused of anti-Semitism by the
Anti-Defamation League. He defended him
self by saying that he was not targeting any
particular group with his poem, but was rather
criticizing the fact that our government, as well
the governments of other countries — includ
ing Israel — knew what was going to happen
and took no action against it.

Baraka's speech criticized acts committed in
America's name, spanning from the country's
birth to current events. He was particularly ve
hement about the Bush administration and
the possible war with Iraq, calling Bush a
"counterfeit president" and pointing out that
the "axis of evil" lies along a strategic, pro
posed oil pipeline in the Middle East.
Tim Yu, a doctoral student in the English
Department, said he agreed with much of
Baraka's message.
"We think we know who is responsible for
tilings like acts of terrorism against America,"
Yu said. "But what we don't really think about
[arej all the injustices in our own history of
racism and colonialism and those kinds of
things. 'The current talk of terrorism is a way of
covering up those things; it's a way of not tak
ing responsibility."
Baraka's talk was preceded by a presenta
tion of Theodore Harris' collages. Harris is a

poet and muralist who describes his collages as
"visual essays." Baraka, who read a set of
poems inspired by Harris' work, described
Harris as a promising artist.
The collages and the poems were filled with
images addressing the treatment of African-
Americans in this country, particularly by the
government and the police.
"A skilled artist is one of the most danger
ous things in the world," Baraka said.
Throughout his speech, Baraka called on
students to take action to change the world.
"For you college students, to be active, you
have to take what you were given here," he
said. "You mean you're going to sit here, pas
sively, in this school, and never learn anything,
and then go out and get a job at American Ex
press and die as a fool?
"You're supposed to be alive, you're sup
posed to be disrupting. You're supposed to be
creating new information."
