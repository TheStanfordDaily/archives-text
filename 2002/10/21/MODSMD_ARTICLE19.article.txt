# The 						wall at Arrillaga allows members of the Stanford Climbing Wall Club to
## Keep on rockin' 
### ROSE JENKINS 
Think rock climbing is a trendy
sport of the current generation at
Stanford? Think again â€” it's been
around for more than 50 years
and is still a highly popular sport.
Stanford students today can go to
the climbing wall inArrillaga Fam
ily Sports Center and partake in a
variety of classes to learn how to
climb or master their skills.
The appeal is so great that
graduate student Erika Monahan,
the treasurer for the Climbing
Wall Club, pointed out that its
database shows over 3,000 mem
bers of the Stanford community as
having used the wall on at least
one occasion.
"Dating back to the 19505,
there has always been a huge in
terest in rock climbing at Stan
ford," said Dan Arnold, the in
structor for various classes offered
at the Stanford Climbing Wall.
Although it has only been open
for about a year and a half, plans for
the climbing wall have been circu
lating since 1997, when the club was
formed. The group of students cir
culated petitions and got a special
fee request on the ASSU ballot.
Stanford students voted to pro
vide $3.0,000 to the endeavor, and
the funds were matched by the
Department of Athletics, Physical
Education and Recreation. Due to
delays in finding both a location
and a contractor for the wall, con
struction was not begun until win
ter of 2000, and the wall finally
opened up in the spring of2ool in
the racquetball courts.
Since then, the demand for
using the wall has been growing.
When asked how many are usual
ly at the climbing wall, mechanical
engineering graduate student
Bryan Palmintier, who has been
involved with the climbing wall

since its inception, responded, "All
I know is that there are lots."
More specifically, Monahan es
timated that there are probably a
few hundred regular users of the
climbing wall, which is available
for use free-of-charge.
Many of the regulars are also
active in outdoor clubs on campus.
Among the largest of these organi
zations is the Redwood Outdoor
Club, which has a over 600 people
on its mailing list and leads excur
sions of about 10 or 15 people
nearly every weekend.
Although most of these are
backpacking trips, the club usually
takes a couple of rock-climbing
trips per year.
The Outing Club focuses on
day hikes, but members occasion
ally take group trips to climbing
gyms. In the Kayak Club, experi
enced members may take trips
year-round, but activity is especial
ly high in the spring, when the
club offers a beginning whitewater
kayaking clinic.
Another organization that
climbers and other outdoor sports
enthusiasts may partake in is the
Stanford Outdoor Outreach Pro
gram, which teaches high-school
students outdoor skills and takes
them on backpacking trips. Also
offering classes is the Outdoor Ed
ucation Program, which teaches
the Wilderness Skills class GES7 to
beginner backpackers during the
fall and winter quarters and to ad
vanced students in the spring.
Students often take advantage of
the different focuses of these clubs
to participate in a wider variety of
activities. Palmintier noted that the
more experienced climbers using
the climbing wall ". . . are involved
in at least two of those."
Dave Weaver, a fourth-vear
l'h.l) student in chemical engi
neering and the head route-setter
at the Stanford Climbing Wall,
noted that the climbing wall has
many functions, allowing students
to get a great workout and mingle
socially as well.
"The climbing wall is not only a
great place to train, but it's a per
fect physical place for the climbing
community to get together and
meet one another," Weaver said.
Even for those with no prior ex
perience and no connection to the
climbing community, the climbing
wall is a great opportunity to get
involved in climbing. Weaver
pointed out many students have
different levels of experience when
they come to the wall.

"Many of them have no experi
ence. You don't even have to be
able to do a pull-up," he said.
Instead, there are two free daily
lessons at the wall where beginners
can learn the basics of tying a rope
and belaying. For those who want
to acquire more rock-climbing
skills, d ie climbing wall offers begin
ner, intermediate and advanced
level quarter-long classes taught by
Dan Arnold, a Stanford alumnus.
"1 had done some climbing be
fore, but I didn't realize there were
so many technical details," said
Kelsey Clark, a junior taking the
intermediate class. She added that
approximately 15 students in her
class had taken the beginning class
last year.
Whether they take the classes or
not, many of those who first expe
rience climbing at the Stanford
wall will continue on in the activity.
"The climbing wall is a fantastic

addition to the campus because it
provides an easy way to learn and
be exposed to climbing right on
campus," Arnold said.
Many students take the classes
or go to the wall and are then in
troduced by their peers to outdoor
climbing opportunities.
"At some point, one of the more
experienced friends takes them
outdoors, or they hear about the
Stanford Alpine club, and then they
are taken outside for some real rock
climbing," Weaver said. "Alter that
they are undoubtedly hooked."
It is clear from the current pop
ularity of the climbing wall and the
plans under consideration to ex
pand it that the Stanford climbing
wall is an integral part of a long his
tory of rock climbing on campus.
Dan Arnold points out, "From
the old Stanford Alpine Club to
bouldering on the Quad, students
[at Stanford] have always climbed."
