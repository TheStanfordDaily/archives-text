# Group adds twist to social scene
## New 'Swingtime' troupe auditions students to complete the ensemble 
### NATALIE SCHWARTZ 
Despite their busy schedules, Stanford students
are always looking for new ways to have fun, relax
and meet new people — and joining a dance group
is one way many students can do all of these at once.
Over tlie last few years, swing dancing has become
very popular throughout the country, and Stanford
has definitely not been excluded from this new trend.
This year, Stanford has two brand-new swing dance
groups. Swingtime, one of the groups, will perform au
thentic choreographed swing dances.
" Fhe group will work with professional choreogra
phers, dance historians and dancing legends to recre
ate swing-era dances and integrate current swing
trends," said Swingtime coordinator Maria Reese, a co
term student.
"Swing dancing takes the foot-tapping and seat
bopping that we do when we hear good swing music to
a whole new level," she said.
"You, your partner and the entire group of dancers
share a special connection of pure enjoyment. .. there
is nothing quite like flying through the air in a swing
aerial or turning so quickly that you get dizzy just to
make you giggle and smile like a little kid," she added.
Ten years ago, Prof. Richard Powers started the
Stanford Vintage Dance Ensemble, which per
formed social partner dances from the 19th
through early 20th century including Victorian,
ragtime and swing dances.
Originally, the group was open to both students and
other talented dancers from the area. Powers enforced
a students-only policy for the group five years ago, be
cause the interest and success of the group led mem
bership to skyrocket to over 60 dancers.
For the past several years, the ensemble has been
comprised mainly of students along with several alum
ni who continued to dance with the group after gradu

ation to keep the gender numbers balanced — last
year the group had 32 members.
Starting this year, the Dance Department, which
was previously part of the Department of Athletics,
Physical Education and Recreation, will be part of the
School of Humanities and Sciences. The new depart
ment requirements do not allow Powers enough time
to direct the ensemble.
Upon hearing of the termination of the ensemble,
Reese, along with two of the other coordinators, Andy
Huang, a second year co-term student, and Derrick
Tong, a fifth year Ph.D. student, came up with the idea
and title for Swingtime. Reese, Huang and Tong, who
had all been members of the ensemble, later asked
sophomore Meg Kale to become the fourth coordina
tor of the troupe.
Kale danced in high school and organized a swing
dance troupe in her hometown this summer. Although
involved in the dance community, she did not hear
about the ensemble until this fall. When she contacted
Powers, he put her in touch with the other coordina
tors and she jumped on board the Swingtime team.
As the youngest coordinator, Kale said she hopes to
"bridge the gap between undergraduates and gradu
ate students and get some younger dancers. This will
create a good base of talent."
Although the coordinators self-designated Kale
and Tong as the artistic directors and Huang and
Reese as the business directors, the four work to
gether closely as a team and have the same goals
and aspirations for the group.
"We share the same vision fora polished but fun
group owned by the student members. This re
quires vested interest in the group's high reputa
tion," Huang said.
Tong shares the same feelings. He said he believes
the group should stay small
"Each member should have a say," he continued.
"We are looking fora group of less than 50 dancers."
Swingtime plans to perform on and off campus. The
group is scheduled to perform Nov. 16 at the Ragtime
Ball in the Roble Dance Studio as well as at a men's
basketball half-time show also that
month. The group expressed their
excitement over the possibility of
doing a performance in Las Vegas
this February.
In addition to performing on
their own, Swingtime will have
joint performances with Double or
Nothing, the swing dance troupe
on campus. Double or Nothing is

run by two Stanford alumni and
will focus on innovative and new
in-house swing choreographies.
Powers has been working closely
with the Swingtime directors.
"They really want to see the
group succeed at a high level," he
said. "I really admire that."
Auditions will be held today,
today from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. at
Roble Main Dance Studio. The
troupe is an ASSU Voluntary Stu
dent Organization, which means
that it is funded according to how
many students are in its group, but

it is willing to accept Stanford alum
ni with swing experience. The
group does ask that those trying out
for the troupe make at least a one
year commitment.
"Swingtime is looking tor enthu
siasm, solid technique, personal
llair and charisma in its dancers.
Dance and swing experience are
recommended, but if you can learn
fast and have got some pizzazz,
show up," Reese said.
