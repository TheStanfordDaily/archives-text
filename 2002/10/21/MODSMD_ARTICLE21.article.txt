Saturday: Stanford 16, Arizona 6

While junior quarterback Chris Lewis and sopho
more wide receiver TeyoJohnson failed to make their
long-awaited golden connection and light up the
scoreboard, three field goals and a first-quarter
touchdown by sophomore tight end Alex Smith were
enough to break the Cardinal's three game losing
streak.
Offensive success came from an unexpected source
for Stanford. Smith, the backup tight end at the sea
son's outset, was moved into the starting role after a
season-ending injury to senior Brett Pierce in the first
game against Boston College. But as Arizona focused
on shutting down Johnson — which it did successful
ly — Smith found himself as Lewis' and freshman
Kyle Matter's favorite target. He finished with eight
catches for 120 yards.
"[Arizona] was bringing in their other safety to
cover Teyo, which left me in single coverage," Smith
said. " The defense was beginning to say they knew
what was coming, so I just had to make something
happen."
The biggest hero for the Cardinal was its defen
sive unit. The much-maligned pass defense found
success both in the pass rush and in the secondary,
holding the Wildcats (3-4, 0-3) to just two first-half
field goals — 15 fewer points than Arizona's season
average.
Stanford sacked Arizona's Jason Johnson six
times and put him under heavy pressure countless
others, leading to three interceptions. Redshirt
freshman nose tackle Babatunde Oshinowo had two
sacks in the contest, while corner Stanley Wilson and
fellow sophomores safety Oshiomogho Atogwe and
linebacker J a red Newberry all added picks.
"We're starting to play with chemistry and poise,"
Wilson said of the young defense. "We have a lot of
guys who have never played together before, but we
are starting to mature."
Stanford scored on its first two possessions. The
first points came on a 45-yard field goal by redshirt
freshman Michael Sgroi. Sgroi was 3-4 on field goal
attempts, the other two conversions coming from 27
and 21 yards. It took the Cardinal two plays to find
the end zone after Wilson returned an interception
35 yards to the Arizona 17.
Despite using Matter throughout most of the sec
ond half after Lewis suffered a minor injury to his
throwing shoulder, Teevens quelled any notion of a
quarterback controversy, saying Lewis will continue
to start for the Cardinal. Lewis played his most con
trolled game of the season, going 14-27 passing for
120 yards and no interceptions, a category in which

he leads the conference.
Lewis also showed uncharacteristic mobility,
scrambling for several first downs, including a 26-
yard run on the game's first series, a career best for
him.
"I thought Chris made some good decisions
early, threw the ball well, and 1 was impressed that
he ran the ball," Teevens said. "It was the first time
we've really seen that, and they came at the right
time."
Stanford's running game was especially produc
tive in the second half. Senior tailback Kerry Carter
wore down Arizona's run defense with 74 yards
rushing in the half, giving him a season-high 98

the Cardinal's leading receiver, recording eight receptions for 1 20 yards.
yards on 27 carries for the season
and running enough time off the
clock to ensure the Wildcats little
chance at a comeback.
Even after expressing relief
and pride in his first conference
win, Teevens found serious room
for improvement. His biggest dis
appointment was lack of efficien
cy deep in enemy territory. Seven
times Stanford found itself inside
the Wildcat 25 yard line. The re
sult was just 16 points, and three
of these possessions, with penal
ties, an interception and a missed
field goal, produced no points at
all.
"We probably won't work any
where else but in the red zone this
week," Teevens said.
With its next three games
against UCLA (4-3), No. 14 Ore
gon (6-1) and No. 15 Southern
California (5-2), Stanford will
need a better performance than
Saturday's to emerge victorious.
But earning that elusive second
win gives the squad confidence
and Teevens' staff a foundation
to build upon.
"A win's a win," Lewis said.
"When you have three losses in a
row, your food tastes horrible,
you can't get any sleep."
