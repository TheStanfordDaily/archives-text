# Card defense stifles 'Cats
## 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford (1-4, 1-2 Pacific-10 Conference) only
scored one touchdown on Saturday against Ari
zona (3-4,0-3), but the story of the game wasn't the
Cardinal offense's red-zone futility. Rather, it was
Stanford's surprisingly effective defense.
The Cardinal secondary forced four turnovers,
and the Stanford pass rush harried Wildcat quar
terback Jason Johnson all day, sacking him six
times.
Not only did the Stanford defense make some
big plays, it also prevented Arizona from making
many big plays of its own, limiting the Wildcats to
266 total yards on only 54 plays.
From the first series, Stanford's defense set the
tone.
Prior to the game, Arizona's Bobby Wade, the
leading receiver in the Pac-10, had said, "The key
[is that] we've gotta start early. Our first drive, we've
got to score. A touchdown, a field goal, whatever,
we've got to score."
On Arizona's first drive, the Cardinal gave up
seven yards on two rushes and then, on third down,
senior tackle Trey Freeman fought his way into the
backfield and batted down Johnson's pass, forcing
a punt.
On the next Arizona possession, Wildcat receiv
er Lance Relford fell down before completing his
route, and Johnson's pass hit sophomore corner
back Stanley Wilson right between the numbers.
Wilson ran back the interception 35 yards to the
Arizona 17, setting up the Cardinal's only touch
down.
"It's veiy exciting when we get
the turnover and see them go
[score]," sophomore safety Osh
iomogho Atogwe said. "It just
makes us leel so good."
Late in the first quarter, Wade
broke off a 64-yard punt return to
put the Wildcats 14 yards away
from the end /one. But the Cardi
nal's secondary played shut-down
coverage, and Johnson couldn't
complete a pass, forcing Arizona to
settle fora field goal.
Halfway through the second
quarter, alter a 15-yard sack by
sophomore defensive end Anion
Gordon, Stanford had backed up
the Wildcats to third-and-20 on
their own 43, when Johnson hit
Relford for what would have been a
first down. But sophomore corner
back Leigh lo ire nee ripped the
ball out of Relford's hands as he
went down.
On the last possession of the half,
Stanford once again held Arizona
to a 23-yard field goal after the
Wildcats had driven 62 yards into
the Cardinal red zone.
Stanford's defense, which had
kept Arizona contained in the first
half, took control in the second half,
dominating the line of scrimmage
and mounting a dangerous pass
rush the likes of which Cardinal
fans haven't seen in a long time.
Stanford intercepted Johnson
on two of the Wildcats' three sec
ond-half drives. Atogwe had a key
pick deep in Stanford territory on
the Wildcats' first drive of the third
quarter, a drive that could have tied
theballgame.
"I could tell that he was gonna
run a corner route, and we were in a
cover-two," Atogwe said. "So I just
wanted to be over the top of him and
then just made a break on the ball."
The defense also sacked John
son on all three second-half drives,
even getting consecutive sacks on
Arizona's last-gasp drive.
As time ran down in the fourth,

freshman tackle Babatunde Oshi
nowo hit Johnson fora loss of seven
yards for his second sack of the
game on second down, and T.J.
Rushing came untouched and un
seen on a corner blitz for an 11 -yard
sack on the very next play.
"I thought we defended them
well," head coach Buddy Teevens
said. "This, emotionally and men
tally, was a huge step for us."
Though Johnson found the
ever-dangerous Wade lor 39 yards,
and the first down on the ensuing
fourth-and-26 play the two sacks
burned enough time off the clock
that the Wildcats had only a minute
left to try to score, recover an on
sides kick, and score again.
Sophomore linebacker Jared
Newberry's interception of John
son's deep pass intended for Wade
with 40 seconds left sealed the deal.
All day long, Johnson was unable to
complete the deep ball, and often

didn't even have time to look that
far downfield, with most of his com
pleted passes being tjnic:k hits.
"They took [the deep ball] away
by playing those deep safeties, and
we tried to go through the coverage
a couple of times," Arizona head
coach John Mackovic said. "Jason
Johnson just did not have the time
to go back and find those throws."
Granted, the Stanford defense
has a lot of work still to do â€” the
Cardinal came into the game aver
aging 38.4 points allowed per
game, and even after its Arizona ef
fort, Stanford's 33.0 average ranks
last in the Pac-1(). But Saturday's
showing was a pleasant surprise
and certainly marked a big step in
the right direction.
"A win's a win," junior quarter
back Chris Lewis said. "When you
have three losses in a row, your
food tastes horrible, you can't get
any sleep."
