# Card defense stifles 'Cats

### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford (1-4, 1-2 Pacific-10 Conference) only
scored one touchdown on Saturday against Ari
zona (3-4,0-3), but the story of the game wasn't the
Cardinal offense's red-zone futility. Rather, it was
Stanford's surprisingly effective defense.
The Cardinal secondary forced four turnovers,
and the Stanford pass rush harried Wildcat quar
terback Jason Johnson all day, sacking him six
times.
Not only did the Stanford defense make some
big plays, it also prevented Arizona from making
many big plays of its own, limiting the Wildcats to
266 total yards on only 54 plays.
From the first series, Stanford's defense set the
tone.
Prior to the game, Arizona's Bobby Wade, the
leading receiver in the Pac-10, had said, "The key
[is that] we've gotta start early. Our first drive, we've
got to score. A touchdown, a field goal, whatever,
we've got to score."
On Arizona's first drive, the Cardinal gave up
seven yards on two rushes and then, on third down,
senior tackle Trey Freeman fought his way into the
backfield and batted down Johnson's pass, forcing
a punt.
On the next Arizona possession, Wildcat receiv
er Lance Relford fell down before completing his
route, and Johnson's pass hit sophomore corner
back Stanley Wilson right between the numbers.
Wilson ran back the interception 35 yards to the
Arizona 17, setting up the Cardinal's only touch
down.
