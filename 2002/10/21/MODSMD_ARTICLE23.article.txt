The Stanford men's water polo
team came away smiling after
back-to-back battles with two of its
toughest rivals.

Men's Water Polo
Saturday: No. 1 Stanford 14, No. 9
Long Beach St. 6
Yesterday: Stanford 7, No. 4 UCLA 5

The team brought a striking 14-
2 record overall, 2-1 in the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation, to
Avery Aquatic Center on Saturday
to face the No. 9 Long Beach State
49ers before squaring off against
the UCLA Bruins yesterday.
The Cardinal defeated Long
Beach earlier this season, winning
a 10-6 victory in the opening
round of the SoCal Tournament
in September. Yet this previous
victory and Stanford's eight-point
lead by the end of the game belie
the intensity of the match.
The opening period of the
game was probably the most fast
paced, with numerous turnovers
and several goals on both sides.
The goalies certainly had their
work cut out for them, with over
20 shots on goal in the first period
alone. Only a minute into the
game, both teams managed to get
the ball into the opposite net-
Several shots were also scored

from the posts, including those
made by seniors Peter Hudnut
and Jeff Nesmith. Junior Mike
Derse added two goals of his own,
giving the Cardinal a two-point
cushion by the end of the quarter.
Derse has posted 27 goals since
the season began, already a
tremendous improvement from
his nine-goal sophomore season,
and has been a consistent contrib
utor to Stanford's victories.
The frenetic first period did not
slow down either team before the
half. Stanford especially flexed its
muscles during the second period,
widening the two point lead with
another four points. Senior and
captain Tony Azevedo, who is now
averaging 3.69 goals per game,
knocked in two more goals. Fresh
man Peter Varellas and sopho
more Greg Crum followed Azeve
do's lead, each tallying one goal.
Both teams showed their fa
tigue by the end of the second pe
riod, which contributed to the
high number of turnovers. "We
were both starting to turn the ball
over a lot during the counter-at
tacks," Derse said. "So during the
second half, we were really trying
to get back into the rhythm of the
game."
Focusing on more carefully ex
ecuted passes and better coordina
tion, the Cardinal more than
found its rhythm, almost tripling
the 49ers in points during the sec
ond half. Hopkins, Derse, Ne
smith and Azevedo, who had each
scored during the first half , contin
ued their scoring streak with three
more goals during the third peri
od. Senior Kellyn Carlson of the
49ers was Long Beach's sole play
er to score during the second half.
The intensity of the match be
tween the 49ers and the Cardinal
seemed to fizzle during the fourth
period, and it seemed the 49ers
were resigned to accept defeat. But
as Nesmith remarked after the
game, the Stanford victory was not
unexpected.
"We had beat them once before,
and we knew that if we played our
best we could definitely beat them
again," he said. In reference to the
toned down second half, Nesmith
said that "[the 49ers] knew we had
a really good counter-attack, so
they were forced to slow down the
pace of the game."
In the end, a game that initially
seemed like it might be dose ulti
mately turned into another deci
sive Stanford victory.
The main event of the weekend
occurred the following day at noon
with Stanford's first face-off with
the UCLA Bruins this season.
Twenty minutes before the game
began, Stanford's side of Avery was
almost completely filled with avid
Cardinal water polo fans. The
bleachers on the guest side, al
though much less crowded, was
equally vocal.
11 was clear that both the players
and the fans were anxious going
into the game. Senior Nick Ellis
commented on the tension, saying
that "the reason people get so ex
cited about a game against UCLA
is that they know beforehand that
its going to be a great match. The
outcome is never predetermined,
and the fans react to that."

The last time these two teams
met was at the 2002 NCAA Cham
pionships, in which Stanford
snatched the title.
The game began auspiciously
for the Cardinal, with Nesmith
winning t lie opening the opening
sprint for the ball. Nesmith would
in fact win every sprint in the
game, going four-for-lour.
The tone of the game, although
galvanized by the crowd's excite
ment, was nevertheless very seri
ous and methodical during the
first half, with each team both run
ning clown the shot clock several
times.
Each team only scored one goal
during the first period, with
sophomore Reed Gallogly notch
ing the Cardinal's sole point of the
period. The tension in the game
was visible in the pool as well as in
the crowds, so much so that a small
tiff between Nesmith and Bruin
Albert Garcia occurred, resulting
in ejections for both of them.

The Cardinal saw no points
from leader and captain Tony
Azevedo. Derse stepped up and
and scored a whopping three
goals, including one after a fast
break in the second quarter. By
the end of the half, the Cardinal
had increased its lead on the
Bruins by two points and main
tained this lead for the rest of the
game.
Stanford did not give the Bru
ins much opportunity to lessen
their deficit in the second half, with
goals coming from Hudnut and
freshman Peter Varellas.
The last minutes of the fourth
period proved the most exciting of
the game. Seniors Dan Yielding
and Josh Hewko of UCLA each
scored, reviving the UCIA crowd
and rallying the Bruin polo squad.
Fortunately for the Cardinal, Ne
smith secured victory for Stanford
with a last-second goal.
Stanford's next game will be
held at UC-Irvine at 6:00 p.m.

against the Bruins, tallying three goals fora season total of 27. The Cardinal
maintained its No. 1 ranking with its two victories this weekend.
The Stanford men's water polo
team came away smiling after
back-to-back battles with two of its
toughest rivals.

Men's Water Polo
Saturday: No. 1 Stanford 14, No. 9
Long Beach St. 6
Yesterday: Stanford 7, No. 4 UCLA 5

The team brought a striking 14-
2 record overall, 2-1 in the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation, to
Avery Aquatic Center on Saturday
to face the No. 9 Long Beach State
49ers before squaring off against
the UCLA Bruins yesterday.
The Cardinal defeated Long
Beach earlier this season, winning
a 10-6 victory in the opening
round of the SoCal Tournament
in September. Yet this previous
victory and Stanford's eight-point
lead by the end of the game belie
the intensity of the match.
The opening period of the
game was probably the most fast
paced, with numerous turnovers
and several goals on both sides.
The goalies certainly had their
work cut out for them, with over
20 shots on goal in the first period
alone. Only a minute into the
game, both teams managed to get
the ball into the opposite net-
Several shots were also scored

from the posts, including those
made by seniors Peter Hudnut
and Jeff Nesmith. Junior Mike
Derse added two goals of his own,
giving the Cardinal a two-point
cushion by the end of the quarter.
Derse has posted 27 goals since
the season began, already a
tremendous improvement from
his nine-goal sophomore season,
and has been a consistent contrib
utor to Stanford's victories.
The frenetic first period did not
slow down either team before the
half. Stanford especially flexed its
muscles during the second period,
widening the two point lead with
another four points. Senior and
captain Tony Azevedo, who is now
averaging 3.69 goals per game,
knocked in two more goals. Fresh
man Peter Varellas and sopho
more Greg Crum followed Azeve
do's lead, each tallying one goal.
Both teams showed their fa
tigue by the end of the second pe
riod, which contributed to the
high number of turnovers. "We
were both starting to turn the ball
over a lot during the counter-at
tacks," Derse said. "So during the
second half, we were really trying
to get back into the rhythm of the
game."
Focusing on more carefully ex
ecuted passes and better coordina
tion, the Cardinal more than
found its rhythm, almost tripling
the 49ers in points during the sec
ond half. Hopkins, Derse, Ne
smith and Azevedo, who had each
scored during the first half , contin
ued their scoring streak with three
more goals during the third peri
od. Senior Kellyn Carlson of the
49ers was Long Beach's sole play
er to score during the second half.
The intensity of the match be
tween the 49ers and the Cardinal
seemed to fizzle during the fourth
period, and it seemed the 49ers
were resigned to accept defeat. But
as Nesmith remarked after the
game, the Stanford victory was not
unexpected.
"We had beat them once before,
and we knew that if we played our
best we could definitely beat them
again," he said. In reference to the
toned down second half, Nesmith
said that "[the 49ers] knew we had
a really good counter-attack, so
they were forced to slow down the
pace of the game."
In the end, a game that initially
seemed like it might be dose ulti
mately turned into another deci
sive Stanford victory.
The main event of the weekend
occurred the following day at noon
with Stanford's first face-off with
the UCLA Bruins this season.
Twenty minutes before the game
began, Stanford's side of Avery was
almost completely filled with avid
Cardinal water polo fans. The
bleachers on the guest side, al
though much less crowded, was
equally vocal.
11 was clear that both the players
and the fans were anxious going
into the game. Senior Nick Ellis
commented on the tension, saying
that "the reason people get so ex
cited about a game against UCLA
is that they know beforehand that
its going to be a great match. The
outcome is never predetermined,
and the fans react to that."

The last time these two teams
met was at the 2002 NCAA Cham
pionships, in which Stanford
snatched the title.
The game began auspiciously
for the Cardinal, with Nesmith
winning t lie opening the opening
sprint for the ball. Nesmith would
in fact win every sprint in the
game, going four-for-lour.
The tone of the game, although
galvanized by the crowd's excite
ment, was nevertheless very seri
ous and methodical during the
first half, with each team both run
ning clown the shot clock several
times.
Each team only scored one goal
during the first period, with
sophomore Reed Gallogly notch
ing the Cardinal's sole point of the
period. The tension in the game
was visible in the pool as well as in
the crowds, so much so that a small
tiff between Nesmith and Bruin
Albert Garcia occurred, resulting
in ejections for both of them.

The Cardinal saw no points
from leader and captain Tony
Azevedo. Derse stepped up and
and scored a whopping three
goals, including one after a fast
break in the second quarter. By
the end of the half, the Cardinal
had increased its lead on the
Bruins by two points and main
tained this lead for the rest of the
game.
Stanford did not give the Bru
ins much opportunity to lessen
their deficit in the second half, with
goals coming from Hudnut and
freshman Peter Varellas.
The last minutes of the fourth
period proved the most exciting of
the game. Seniors Dan Yielding
and Josh Hewko of UCLA each
scored, reviving the UCIA crowd
and rallying the Bruin polo squad.
Fortunately for the Cardinal, Ne
smith secured victory for Stanford
with a last-second goal.
Stanford's next game will be
held at UC-Irvine at 6:00 p.m.
