The Stanford men's water polo
team came away smiling after
back-to-back battles with two of its
toughest rivals.

Men's Water Polo
Saturday: No. 1 Stanford 14, No. 9
Long Beach St. 6
Yesterday: Stanford 7, No. 4 UCLA 5

The team brought a striking 14-
2 record overall, 2-1 in the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation, to
Avery Aquatic Center on Saturday
to face the No. 9 Long Beach State
49ers before squaring off against
the UCLA Bruins yesterday.
The Cardinal defeated Long
Beach earlier this season, winning
a 10-6 victory in the opening
round of the SoCal Tournament
in September. Yet this previous
victory and Stanford's eight-point
lead by the end of the game belie
the intensity of the match.
The opening period of the
game was probably the most fast
paced, with numerous turnovers
and several goals on both sides.
The goalies certainly had their
work cut out for them, with over
20 shots on goal in the first period
alone. Only a minute into the
game, both teams managed to get
the ball into the opposite net-
Several shots were also scored

from the posts, including those
made by seniors Peter Hudnut
and Jeff Nesmith. Junior Mike
Derse added two goals of his own,
giving the Cardinal a two-point
cushion by the end of the quarter.
Derse has posted 27 goals since
the season began, already a
tremendous improvement from
his nine-goal sophomore season,
and has been a consistent contrib
utor to Stanford's victories.
The frenetic first period did not
slow down either team before the
half. Stanford especially flexed its
muscles during the second period,
widening the two point lead with
another four points. Senior and
captain Tony Azevedo, who is now
averaging 3.69 goals per game,
knocked in two more goals. Fresh
man Peter Varellas and sopho
more Greg Crum followed Azeve
do's lead, each tallying one goal.
Both teams showed their fa
tigue by the end of the second pe
riod, which contributed to the
high number of turnovers. "We
were both starting to turn the ball
over a lot during the counter-at
tacks," Derse said. "So during the
second half, we were really trying
to get back into the rhythm of the
game."
Focusing on more carefully ex
ecuted passes and better coordina
tion, the Cardinal more than
found its rhythm, almost tripling
the 49ers in points during the sec
ond half. Hopkins, Derse, Ne
smith and Azevedo, who had each
scored during the first half , contin
ued their scoring streak with three
