# Volleyball cruises to win over Huskies
## 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Stanford women's volley
ball team's match against Wash
ington in Maples Pavilion on Fri
day wasn't very exciting. There
were no nail-biting moments, no
late comebacks, no intense, mo
mentum-changing rallies. There
was nothing much there to ever
get a whole lot of noise out of the
2,068 fans in attendance, and the
final outcome never really seemed
in doubt once the match really got
underway.

Friday: No. 6 Stanford def. Washing
ton 30-24, 30-18, 30-23

In short, it was exactly what the
Cardinal needed.
No. 6 Stanford (16-3, 7-2 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) closed out what
was a bumpy first half of its Pac-10
season with an end-to-end domi
nation of the Huskies (12-6, 4-5).
The Cardinal swept the match 30-
26, 30-18, 30-23 in just under an
hour and a half.
The win, in addition to Stan
ford's 3-0 win over No. 17 Wash
ington State on Thursday night,
leaves the Cardinal two games
back of conference leader No. 1
Southern California.
"It's the halfway point of the
season, and we need to keep
rolling and gain momentum," said
sophomore outside hitter Ogonna
Nnamani, who tallied 13 kills at a
.391 hitting clip for the Cardinal.
"This was definitely a momentum
builder."
I he Cardinal's serving and
passing, which had been quite er
ratic the past couple of weeks as

Stanford dropped costly five-game
matches to the Trojans and No. 19
Arizona, were in near-perfect form
on Friday.
That could mean more playing
time for freshman setter Katie
Goldhahn and senior outside hit
ter Lindsey Yamasaki, who each
made the most of rare starting
nods in the match.
Yamasaki, who has been uti
lized mostly as a defensive special
ist this season, got to start on the
right side in place of under-the
weather senior .Ashley Ivy. Ya
masaki picked up five kills and
eight digs while also serving up
three of Stanford's 10 aces, as the
Cardinal picked up more aces
than service errors for the first
time in weeks.
Goldhahn shined in her first
full match at setter, guiding Stan
ford to a .389 hitting percentage
while also picking up career highs
in assists (40) and blocks (2).
"We have lots of good players
on our team. It's not a message to
anyone on our team, but every
one knows that with me it's day
to day," coach John Dunning
said. "Katie did a great job in her
first full match against a confer
ence opponent. When we hit
.390 against a darn good team,
that says that we've got some
good hitters, but also that Katie
did a really good job."
Senior outside hitter Logan
Tom was Goldhahn's primary tar
get, putting away a match-high 16
kills off 32 sets from the freshman.
With solid passing behind her,
Goldhahn also found junior mid
dle blockers Jenn Harvey and Sara
McGee often, as the two picked up

19 kills while holding themselves
to just two errors.
"Everything ran smoothly
tonight," Goldhahn said. "There
weren't too many miscommuni
cations. It really felt light, llowed
well."
Stanford had an unusually hard
time slowing down Washington's
best player, senior outside hitter
Paige Benjamin, breaking the Car
dinal's usual trend of running its
opponents go-to hitter into the
ground.
Benjamin was able to put away
17 kills while hitting .300. The Car
dinal also had a hard time slowing
sophomore outside hitter Sanja
Tomasevic, who picked up 10 kills
with only two errors on the night,
though Stanford still outblocked
the Huskies 10.5-5.

"We served really well, and
that's a big part of any time we play
well because it lets us get our block
into the, game," Dunning said.
"[Benjamin and Tomasevic] are re
ally hard to block the way they run
their offense. They're speedy, and
it's hard to get a block into place. It
took us about two games to start
getting up early enough on them."
The first game was the only one
that was remotely close, as neither
team's defense was able to slow the
other team's attack. The Huskies
took an early 13-10 lead on three
kills by Tomasevic.
But back-to-back kills from
McGee capped a six-point Cardi
nal run that put Stanford ahead
for good at 16-13. The Cardinal hit
.465 in the 30-26 first-game win,
though the Huskies also managed
an impressive .333 clip.
The Washington attack
couldn't even get off the ground in
the second game, though, as the
I luskies started to show some wear

from their five-game win over Cal
ifornia the previous night.
The Huskies back row
couldn't handle Stanford's tough
serving, leading to seven Cardi
nal aces, and the Washington at
tackers ran into the ferocious net
play of Harvey, who assisted on
four of Stanford's five blocks in
the game. The Cardinal cruised
to a quick 30-18 win.
Little changed in the third
game, as Goldhahn's first career
ace put Stanford up early, 13-5.
Steady digging from Tom and
freshman libero Courtney Schultz,
who each had a match-high nine
digs, kept the Huskies from
mounting a comeback in the 30-23
win to seal the match.
Tomorrow, the Cardinal heads
to Pacific, where Dunning coached
for 16 years before coming to Stan
ford last year, fora nonconference
match before returning to Pac-10
play this weekend against the Ore
gon schools at Maples.

Friday: No. 6 Stanford def. Washing
ton 30-24, 30-18, 30-23

In short, it was exactly what the
Cardinal needed.
No. 6 Stanford (16-3, 7-2 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) closed out what
was a bumpy first half of its Pac-10
season with an end-to-end domi
nation of the Huskies (12-6, 4-5).
The Cardinal swept the match 30-
26, 30-18, 30-23 in just under an
hour and a half.
The win, in addition to Stan
ford's 3-0 win over No. 17 Wash
ington State on Thursday night,
leaves the Cardinal two games
back of conference leader No. 1
Southern California.
"It's the halfway point of the
season, and we need to keep
rolling and gain momentum," said
sophomore outside hitter Ogonna
Nnamani, who tallied 13 kills at a
.391 hitting clip for the Cardinal.
"This was definitely a momentum
builder."
I he Cardinal's serving and
passing, which had been quite er
ratic the past couple of weeks as

Stanford dropped costly five-game
matches to the Trojans and No. 19
Arizona, were in near-perfect form
on Friday.
That could mean more playing
time for freshman setter Katie
Goldhahn and senior outside hit
ter Lindsey Yamasaki, who each
made the most of rare starting
nods in the match.
Yamasaki, who has been uti
lized mostly as a defensive special
ist this season, got to start on the
right side in place of under-the
weather senior .Ashley Ivy. Ya
masaki picked up five kills and
eight digs while also serving up
three of Stanford's 10 aces, as the
Cardinal picked up more aces
than service errors for the first
time in weeks.
Goldhahn shined in her first
full match at setter, guiding Stan
ford to a .389 hitting percentage
while also picking up career highs
in assists (40) and blocks (2).
"We have lots of good players
on our team. It's not a message to
anyone on our team, but every
one knows that with me it's day
to day," coach John Dunning
said. "Katie did a great job in her
first full match against a confer
ence opponent. When we hit
.390 against a darn good team,
that says that we've got some
good hitters, but also that Katie
did a really good job."
Senior outside hitter Logan
Tom was Goldhahn's primary tar
get, putting away a match-high 16
kills off 32 sets from the freshman.
With solid passing behind her,
Goldhahn also found junior mid
dle blockers Jenn Harvey and Sara
McGee often, as the two picked up

19 kills while holding themselves
to just two errors.
"Everything ran smoothly
tonight," Goldhahn said. "There
weren't too many miscommuni
cations. It really felt light, llowed
well."
Stanford had an unusually hard
time slowing down Washington's
best player, senior outside hitter
Paige Benjamin, breaking the Car
dinal's usual trend of running its
opponents go-to hitter into the
ground.
Benjamin was able to put away
17 kills while hitting .300. The Car
dinal also had a hard time slowing
sophomore outside hitter Sanja
Tomasevic, who picked up 10 kills
with only two errors on the night,
though Stanford still outblocked
the Huskies 10.5-5.

"We served really well, and
that's a big part of any time we play
well because it lets us get our block
into the, game," Dunning said.
"[Benjamin and Tomasevic] are re
ally hard to block the way they run
their offense. They're speedy, and
it's hard to get a block into place. It
took us about two games to start
getting up early enough on them."
The first game was the only one
that was remotely close, as neither
team's defense was able to slow the
other team's attack. The Huskies
took an early 13-10 lead on three
kills by Tomasevic.
But back-to-back kills from
McGee capped a six-point Cardi
nal run that put Stanford ahead
for good at 16-13. The Cardinal hit
.465 in the 30-26 first-game win,
though the Huskies also managed
an impressive .333 clip.
The Washington attack
couldn't even get off the ground in
the second game, though, as the
I luskies started to show some wear

from their five-game win over Cal
ifornia the previous night.
The Huskies back row
couldn't handle Stanford's tough
serving, leading to seven Cardi
nal aces, and the Washington at
tackers ran into the ferocious net
play of Harvey, who assisted on
four of Stanford's five blocks in
the game. The Cardinal cruised
to a quick 30-18 win.
Little changed in the third
game, as Goldhahn's first career
ace put Stanford up early, 13-5.
Steady digging from Tom and
freshman libero Courtney Schultz,
who each had a match-high nine
