# Volleyball cruises to win over Huskies

### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Stanford women's volley
ball team's match against Wash
ington in Maples Pavilion on Fri
day wasn't very exciting. There
were no nail-biting moments, no
late comebacks, no intense, mo
mentum-changing rallies. There
was nothing much there to ever
get a whole lot of noise out of the
2,068 fans in attendance, and the
final outcome never really seemed
in doubt once the match really got
underway.

Friday: No. 6 Stanford def. Washing
ton 30-24, 30-18, 30-23

In short, it was exactly what the
Cardinal needed.
No. 6 Stanford (16-3, 7-2 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) closed out what
was a bumpy first half of its Pac-10
season with an end-to-end domi
nation of the Huskies (12-6, 4-5).
The Cardinal swept the match 30-
26, 30-18, 30-23 in just under an
hour and a half.
The win, in addition to Stan
ford's 3-0 win over No. 17 Wash
ington State on Thursday night,
leaves the Cardinal two games
back of conference leader No. 1
Southern California.
"It's the halfway point of the
season, and we need to keep
rolling and gain momentum," said
sophomore outside hitter Ogonna
Nnamani, who tallied 13 kills at a
.391 hitting clip for the Cardinal.
"This was definitely a momentum
builder."
I he Cardinal's serving and
passing, which had been quite er
ratic the past couple of weeks as

Stanford dropped costly five-game
matches to the Trojans and No. 19
Arizona, were in near-perfect form
on Friday.
That could mean more playing
time for freshman setter Katie
Goldhahn and senior outside hit
ter Lindsey Yamasaki, who each
made the most of rare starting
nods in the match.
Yamasaki, who has been uti
lized mostly as a defensive special
ist this season, got to start on the
right side in place of under-the
weather senior .Ashley Ivy. Ya
masaki picked up five kills and
eight digs while also serving up
three of Stanford's 10 aces, as the
Cardinal picked up more aces
than service errors for the first
time in weeks.
Goldhahn shined in her first
full match at setter, guiding Stan
ford to a .389 hitting percentage
while also picking up career highs
in assists (40) and blocks (2).
"We have lots of good players
on our team. It's not a message to
anyone on our team, but every
one knows that with me it's day
to day," coach John Dunning
said. "Katie did a great job in her
first full match against a confer
ence opponent. When we hit
.390 against a darn good team,
that says that we've got some
good hitters, but also that Katie
did a really good job."
Senior outside hitter Logan
Tom was Goldhahn's primary tar
get, putting away a match-high 16
kills off 32 sets from the freshman.
With solid passing behind her,
Goldhahn also found junior mid
dle blockers Jenn Harvey and Sara
McGee often, as the two picked up

which the Cardinal defeated in three straight sets on Friday. Stanford is now
two games behind top-ranked USC in the conference standings.
