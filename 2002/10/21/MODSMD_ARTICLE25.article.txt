# Cardinal bitten by Bulldogs
## 
### SPENCER PORTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With more fans than the Bible's
got psalms, the Stanford field hoc k
ey team looked to forget its woes
stemming from last week's loss to
No. 16 California with a win over
Yale (5-7) yesterday.

Field Hockey
Yesterday: Yale 2, Stanford 1

It had the home field, it had a big
crowd, and it had plenty of scoring
opportunities, but the Cardinal (8-9)
didn't have enough goals, losing to
the Bulldogs in the waning mo
ments of the game, 2-1.
With a strong alumni presence
and many local field hockey teams
dotting the sideline of the Artificial
Turf Field, the Cardinal had plenty
of support from the home fans. But
Yale was still able to strike first, scor
ing at 13:19 in the first half when
Elizabeth Topp put away a pass
from Sarah Driscoll.
Yale seemed determined in the
first half, with the Bulldogs taking

the first 10 shots of the game and
scoring the only goal of the first half.
The Stanford attack got going as
the first half winded down, finishing
t he half with a 17-12 shot advantage
but with 110 g( >als to show for its eflbn.
That shot edge lasted into the sec
ond half, as the Cardinal finished
with 25 shots to Yale's 17 in what has
become a constant trend this year of
outplaying opponents and still los
ing. It was the 15th time out of 17
games that the Cardinal has outshot
its opponent and the seventh time it
has done so in its nine defeats on the
season.
"They came out strong, but we
definitely outplayed them," said
Stanford midfielder Eleanor Mor
gan, a sophomore. 'The intensity
was there, but we need to solve our
finishing problem."
Yale scored again in the second
half, taking the game to 2-0 when
|ana Halfbn picked up a goal at
63:23.
However, Stanford wasn't
through yet, and with some added
intensity, the Cardinal scored a
minute later when senior forward

Amanda Billmyer notched her fifth
goal of the season to make the score
2-1. With her score, Billmyer be
came the co-points leader of the
team, joining senior Amrit Chima
with 17.
llie game featured a rare occur
rence, with 112 ive defensive saves, when
a defender saves a shot from scoring.
A normal game usually has one or
two saves, but Stanford recorded
three (senior defender Lauren Stew
ard 2, Chima) and Yale had two
(Brigid Boland, Chrissy Hall).
Stanford still has three games left
tin the schedule before the Northern
Pacific Athletic Conference playoffs.
This weekend Stanford will host
Cardinal field hockey alumnae in
their annual game before playing
UC-Santa Barbara in an exhibition
game next Sunday.
The Cardinal will then take on
California in a conference show
down on Nov. 2 to decide the Nor-
Pac season champion. Cal cunendy
leads the Cardinal with a perfect 3-0
conference record to Stanford's 4-1
mark. Stanford's only loss was to the
Golden Bears on Oct. 12.
