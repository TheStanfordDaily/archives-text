# Golf takes 9th at tournament
## Rival California wins the Intercollegiate on Stanford's home course. 
### BRIAN DOYLE 
On the course that its head
coach said had come to feel like
home, the California women's
golf team walked away with top
honors at the Stanford Pepsi In-
Women's Golf

Stanford Pepsi Intercollegiate
1. Cal 885; 2. Vanderbilt 887; 3.
Washington 890; 9. Stanford 914

tercollegiate this weekend at the
Stanford Golf Course. The Cardi
nal, led by senior Kim Rowton,
finished ninth out of the 17 teams
competing on its home links.
After posting a disappointing
round of 80 in the first round,
Rowton came back with rounds of
73 and 2-under-par 70 to finish
13th individually. It was her sec
ond top-15 showing of the year.
Her strong finish might have
been inspired by the remarkable
play of one of her playing part
ners, Arizona freshman Erica
Blasberg, who carded her second
consecutive round of 69 to wrap
up top medalist honors. Blas
berg's three-day total of a 5-under
211 put her five shots clear of in
dividual runner-up Alena Sharp
of New Mexico State.
"Whenever [Blasberg] got in

trouble, she got up and down,"
Rowton said.
Stanford freshman Kelly
Husted followed up her strong
showing at the Edean Ihlanfeldt
Invitational two weeks ago with a
33rd-place finish. Junior Kim
Kouwabunpat finished at 16-over,
alone in 44th. Sophomore Wen
dra Liang and junior Angela Rho
rounded out the Cardinal squad
with scores of 18- and 19-over, re
spectively.
"I scored well considering how
badly I was hitting the ball," Liang
said. "I wasn't hitting it well at all,
but my chipping and putting
saved a lot of strokes."
Rho was one of three Cardinal
players to finish the tournament
with "hockey sticks," the team's
shorthand fora round of 77.
"I started out terribly, 4-over
through four holes. From then
on, I was 1-over, so I settled down
a little bit," Rho said.
Though wind conditions were
favorable for the tournament, the
players teed off in cold tempera
tures, which made the course play
slightly longer than usual, thus
giving an added advantage to the
field's longer hitters.
Asked how much of a factor
home course advantage was, sev
eral players downplayed its im
portance in golf.
"It's probably harder, actual
ly," Rho said. "The added pres
sure plays a bigger role than
course knowledge."
Cal coach Nancy McDaniel

pointed to her team's experience
on the Stanford Golf Course as a
key to its win in yesterday's final
round.
"Some of our seniors have
played 20, 25 rounds here at this
point," McDaniel said. "VVe some
times call it our home course, but
we know it's not."
Maybe not, but her team cer
tainly seemed to know how to
play it, firing team rounds of 296,
295 and 294 to pass second
round leader Washington. The
Bears were led by Scottish senior
Vikki Laing, who finished third
individually with a 3-over 219,
and placed a remarkable seven
players in the top 30.
Though originally scheduled to
play in the tournament, Pacific-10
Conference powerhouse South
ern California withdrew from the
field due to the number of Trojan
players competing in the World
Amateur Championships.
Still, the absence of the Edean
Ihlanfeldt winners will certainly
not diminish the satisfaction of a
Cal team, which appears ready to
enter the top tier of the very com
petitive Pac-10.
The Stanford women are still
looking to make such a statement
but remain confident as they pre
pare for the upcoming Rainbow
Invitational in Honolulu. The
outstanding play of Rowton, as
well as the continued develop
ment of H usted, should build the
Cardinal some momentum as it
moves on in the young fall season.

round of 80 in the first round,
Rowton came back with rounds of
73 and 2-under-par 70 to finish
13th individually. It was her sec
ond top-15 showing of the year.
Her strong finish might have
been inspired by the remarkable
play of one of her playing part
ners, Arizona freshman Erica
Blasberg, who carded her second
consecutive round of 69 to wrap
up top medalist honors. Blas
berg's three-day total of a 5-under
211 put her five shots clear of in
dividual runner-up Alena Sharp
of New Mexico State.
"Whenever [Blasberg] got in

trouble, she got up and down,"
Rowton said.
Stanford freshman Kelly
Husted followed up her strong
showing at the Edean Ihlanfeldt
Invitational two weeks ago with a
33rd-place finish. Junior Kim
Kouwabunpat finished at 16-over,
alone in 44th. Sophomore Wen
dra Liang and junior Angela Rho
rounded out the Cardinal squad
with scores of 18- and 19-over, re
spectively.
"I scored well considering how
badly I was hitting the ball," Liang
said. "I wasn't hitting it well at all,
but my chipping and putting
saved a lot of strokes."
Rho was one of three Cardinal
players to finish the tournament
with "hockey sticks," the team's
shorthand fora round of 77.
"I started out terribly, 4-over
through four holes. From then
on, I was 1-over, so I settled down
a little bit," Rho said.
Though wind conditions were
favorable for the tournament, the
players teed off in cold tempera
tures, which made the course play
slightly longer than usual, thus
giving an added advantage to the
field's longer hitters.
Asked how much of a factor
home course advantage was, sev
eral players downplayed its im
portance in golf.
"It's probably harder, actual
ly," Rho said. "The added pres
sure plays a bigger role than
course knowledge."
Cal coach Nancy McDaniel

pointed to her team's experience
on the Stanford Golf Course as a
key to its win in yesterday's final
round.
"Some of our seniors have
played 20, 25 rounds here at this
point," McDaniel said. "VVe some
times call it our home course, but
we know it's not."
Maybe not, but her team cer
tainly seemed to know how to
play it, firing team rounds of 296,
295 and 294 to pass second
round leader Washington. The
Bears were led by Scottish senior
Vikki Laing, who finished third
individually with a 3-over 219,
and placed a remarkable seven
players in the top 30.
Though originally scheduled to
play in the tournament, Pacific-10
Conference powerhouse South
ern California withdrew from the
field due to the number of Trojan
players competing in the World
Amateur Championships.
Still, the absence of the Edean
Ihlanfeldt winners will certainly
not diminish the satisfaction of a
Cal team, which appears ready to
enter the top tier of the very com
petitive Pac-10.
The Stanford women are still
looking to make such a statement
but remain confident as they pre
pare for the upcoming Rainbow
Invitational in Honolulu. The
outstanding play of Rowton, as
well as the continued develop
ment of H usted, should build the
Cardinal some momentum as it
moves on in the young fall season.
