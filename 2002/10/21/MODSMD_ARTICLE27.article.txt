# UCLA loses Paus to injury, and the game to California
## 
### 
California 17, UCLA 12
The California defense finished off a spec
tacular clay by keeping UCLA out of the end
zone during a fourth-quarter goal-line stand
as the Golden Bears defeated the Bruins 17-
12 on Saturday.
UCLA — which got a safety on the
game's final play as Cal ran out the clock —
had first-and-goal twice during the pivotal
series, but it ended with Cal's Jamaal Cher
ry blocking a 22-yard field-goal try by Chris

Griffith.
Joe Igber ran 4 yards for the game-win
ning touchdown with 12:08 left, but the de
fense was I he star for the Bears (5-3, 2-2 Pac
-10). UCLA, averaging 437 yards coming in,
was limited to 226.
UCLA played most of the second half with
out starting quarterback Cory Paus, who was
carted off the field with an injured right ankle
with 12:02 left in the third quarter. He didn't
return.
Cal quarterback Kyle Boiler was inconsis

tent, completing only 13 of 30 passes for 130
yards and a touchdown. But his 24-yard TD
pass to Tom Swoboda in the second quarter
gave the senior quarterback the most TD
passes in Cal history with 55. He surpassed
Pat Barnes, who had 54 from 1993-96.
Tyler Ebell carried 28 times for 102 yards,
and Bragg had seven catches for 113 yards
for the Bruins, who have lost two straight.
UCLA, which will host Stanford on Saturday
at the Rose Bowl, had three turnovers to
none for Cal.

UCLA's Paus out for year
UCLA starting quarterback Cory Paus will
miss the rest of the season after breaking his
right ankle in the Bruins' game against Cali
fornia on Saturday.
"He will probably need surgery this week
to stabilize the ankle," said UCLA
spokesman Marc Dellins. "He should make
a full recovery."
Paus went down with 12:02 left in the third
