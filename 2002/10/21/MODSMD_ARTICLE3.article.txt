### CYNTHIA CHO EDITORIAL STAFF 
U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist AB '48, AM '48, JI) '52, Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor, AB '50, JD '52, and
former University President Gerhard Gasper
revisited the U.S. Supreme Court case
"Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer" —
better known as "the Steel Seizure case" — to
mark the 50th anniversary of the Law School's
Kirkwood Moot Court competition.
Nearly 1,700 students, alumni and faculty
were in attendance at Memorial Auditorium
for the event, which was sponsored by the
Stanford Alumni Association and the Gradu
ate School of Business.
The event, entitled "Presidential Power in
Times of Crisis: The Steel Seizure Case Revis
ited" also commemorated the 50th anniver
sary of Rehnquist and O'Connor's graduation
from the Law School. Additionally, it is the
50th anniversary of the court decision itself.
Saturday's moot-court presentation revisit
ed a case that has both historic and present
day importance. Many scholars regard the
Steel Seizure decision as evidence of the U.S.
Supreme Court's effectiveness in limiting the
president 's expansion or acquisition of power
at the expense of Congress.
In 1952, in a 6-3 decision, the majority de
cided that President Harry Truman did not
have the power to seize the country's steel
mills in order to prevent a labor strike, despite
Truman's argument that the conflict in Korea
required that he do so.
"President Truman ... set up this profound
issue: What may the president do without con
gressional .authority in times of national security
crises? It is an issue that we argued back in 1952
and will argue in the next hour and is an issue
that has enormous national significance today,"
Kathleen M. Sullivan, dean of the Law School,
said in her introductory remarks.
On Saturday, the counsel for the petition
er was Charles E. Koob, JD ' 69, who is the
head of the litigation department and a part
ner with Simpson Thacher 8c Barlett in New

York City. The counsel for the respondent
was Karen L. Stevenson JD '98, who won the
Moot Court competition when she was in
her third year at the Law School. Third-year
law student Benjamin J. Horwich served as
marshal.
In his presentation, Koob stressed that
power within the American government is di
vided into three branches.
"We do not dispute that the government
has the authority to seize private property," he
said. "That is a congressional right. And Con
gress can even delegate that right to the pres
ident, if it so chooses, and it has done so on nu
merous occasions. This president didn't ask."
Throughout Koob's presentation, those

presiding over the case challenged Koob's ar
guments.
Casper said, "You ask us to do something
extraordinary. You ask us, the Supreme
Court of the United States, to uphold an in
junction against the president of the United
States."
O'Connor added, "Your theory, if upheld,
could have all kinds of implications . . . [such
as] lawsuits against the president."
Stevenson began her presentation in affir
mation of Truman's argument that the
seizure of the steel mills was necessary because
of U.S. involvement in Korea.
