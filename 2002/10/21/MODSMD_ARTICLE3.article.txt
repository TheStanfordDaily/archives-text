### CYNTHIA CHO EDITORIAL STAFF 
U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist AB '48, AM '48, JI) '52, Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor, AB '50, JD '52, and
former University President Gerhard Gasper
revisited the U.S. Supreme Court case
"Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer" —
better known as "the Steel Seizure case" — to
mark the 50th anniversary of the Law School's
Kirkwood Moot Court competition.
Nearly 1,700 students, alumni and faculty
were in attendance at Memorial Auditorium
for the event, which was sponsored by the
Stanford Alumni Association and the Gradu
ate School of Business.
The event, entitled "Presidential Power in
Times of Crisis: The Steel Seizure Case Revis
ited" also commemorated the 50th anniver
sary of Rehnquist and O'Connor's graduation
from the Law School. Additionally, it is the
50th anniversary of the court decision itself.
Saturday's moot-court presentation revisit
ed a case that has both historic and present
day importance. Many scholars regard the
Steel Seizure decision as evidence of the U.S.
Supreme Court's effectiveness in limiting the
president 's expansion or acquisition of power
at the expense of Congress.
In 1952, in a 6-3 decision, the majority de
cided that President Harry Truman did not
have the power to seize the country's steel
mills in order to prevent a labor strike, despite
Truman's argument that the conflict in Korea
required that he do so.
"President Truman ... set up this profound
issue: What may the president do without con
gressional .authority in times of national security
crises? It is an issue that we argued back in 1952
and will argue in the next hour and is an issue
that has enormous national significance today,"
Kathleen M. Sullivan, dean of the Law School,
said in her introductory remarks.
On Saturday, the counsel for the petition
er was Charles E. Koob, JD ' 69, who is the
head of the litigation department and a part
ner with Simpson Thacher 8c Barlett in New

York City. The counsel for the respondent
was Karen L. Stevenson JD '98, who won the
Moot Court competition when she was in
her third year at the Law School. Third-year
law student Benjamin J. Horwich served as
marshal.
In his presentation, Koob stressed that
power within the American government is di
vided into three branches.
"We do not dispute that the government
has the authority to seize private property," he
said. "That is a congressional right. And Con
gress can even delegate that right to the pres
ident, if it so chooses, and it has done so on nu
merous occasions. This president didn't ask."
Throughout Koob's presentation, those

presiding over the case challenged Koob's ar
guments.
Casper said, "You ask us to do something
extraordinary. You ask us, the Supreme
Court of the United States, to uphold an in
junction against the president of the United
States."
O'Connor added, "Your theory, if upheld,
could have all kinds of implications . . . [such
as] lawsuits against the president."
Stevenson began her presentation in affir
mation of Truman's argument that the
seizure of the steel mills was necessary because
of U.S. involvement in Korea.


KATE KAUFMAN AND KATHERINE LIU/The Stanford Daily
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and Chief Justice William Rehnquist listen to Stanford Law School alum
ni and students plead the "Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer" case in Memorial Auditorium. The
event marked the 50th anniversary of the Law School's Kirkwood Moor Court competition.
"Those lives [being lost in
Korea] must be defended not by
political discourse but bullets and
guns and ships and airplanes —
all of which are highly dependent
on the robust and uninterrupted
production of steel in this coun
try," Stevenson said.
Stevenson also pointed out
that past presidents have seized
private properties without statu
tory or congressional authority.
In response, O'Connor asked a
question that generated laughter
from the audience.
"Are you saying that your ar
gument boils down to something
along the lines of a page of history
is worth a pound of logic?"
O'Connor asked.
"A page of history is certainly
worth some value," Stevenson
replied. "It does not exceed logic .

. . but may inform the inquiry
here."
"It cannot be the case that the
executive does not have the au
thority, as commander in chief
and in obligation to execute law,
does not have the authority to
prevent a catastrophic threat to
our national security," Stevenson
said toward the end of her pre
sentation.
While the justices and Casper
were in deliberation, Sullivan
said, in an interview, "When I
dreamt up this idea, I couldn't
have imagined a better presenta
tion. It had both drama and pro
fundity, along with great prepara
tion on all parts and terrific sense
of humor."
When Sullivan first ap
proached Rehnquist about his
participation in a moot court, she
proposed a reenactment of Mar
bury v. Madison. But Rehnquist
turned that case down, claiming
that it was "too lopsided."
"Justice Rehnquist wanted a

case with great arguments on
both sides, and he suggested the
Steel Seizure case," Sullivan said.
Considering the current na
tional political climate — with the
war on terrorism and U.S. rela
tionships with Iraq and North
Korea — the Steel Seizure case
seems as relevant today as it was
50 years ago.
When Rehnquist, O'Connor
and Casper returned from delib
eration, Rehnquist refrained
from disclosing his personal view
points on the issue of presidential
power. He did, however, share
with the audience what it was like
to be a clerk for Justice Robert
Jackson when the Steel Seizure
case was taken up by the Supreme
Court.
"When the [Justice Jackson]
came back from conference, he
said [to me and my co-clerk],
'Well boys, the president got
licked,'" Rehnquist said.
O'Connor also shared person
al memories from when the Steel

Seizure decision was made.
O'Connor explained that back
then, the president and members
of the Supreme Court were
friends, and so Justice Hugo
Black held a dinner for all of the
justices and the president.
"It is reported that the presi
dent was quite stiff at the dinner,
but after a few drinks, he said
'Your law is no good, but your
Bourbon is,'" O'Connor said.
The last of the three to speak,
Casper began by saying, "I'm not
a justice on the Supreme Court,
alas, and I can express my
views."
In an interview immediately
following the event, Casper said,
"I asked myself last night, 'How
would I have decided?' I would
have voted with the majority."
"I used to teach the case, and I
had not fully appreciated it until
now," Casper added. "I didn't
know that it was such a complicat
ed case. The court had such a di
versity of opinions."
