# FBI Director weighs security, liberty
## 
### ALEX BLEYLEBEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
In an nearly-full Memorial Auditori
um flanked by security agents on the in
side and by protesters on the outside, FBI
Director Robert Mueller discussed the
balance between security and civil liberties
and warned about the threat of terrorism
on American soil in the near future.
Mueller spoke as the recipient of the
Jackson 11. Ralston prize in internation
al law, given annually by the Stanford
Law School to "someone who has made
distinguished contributions to the de

velopment of the role of law in interna
tional relations."
Mueller stressed the difficult position
the FBI has been in since Sept. 11. The
agency is mandated on the one hand to
seek out terrorists within the country and
on the other to protect fundamental civil
liberties. Mueller argued that the terror
ists of Sept. 11 had been able to use Amer
ican civil liberties to help them accom
plish their mission.
"What we have found, paradoxically,
is that those participating in that attack
operated while hidden in plain view,"
Mueller said. "In many ways, they

turned the liberties we most cherish in
this nation against us."
Mueller denied that the expanded
powers given to his agency to fight ter
rorism would lead to a loss of civil liberties
and to racial and religious profiling â€”
two of the main concerns expressed by
the protesters outside. But he did say
that, to fulfill the mission of his agency, it
is necessary to negotiate a delicate bal
ance between saving lives and overstep
ping authority.
"There is a continuum between those
who on the one hand have expressed dis
content .. . and on the other hand those
who commit terrorist acts," Mueller said.
"Someplace on that continuum we have
to begin to investigate to determine
whether or not an individual who has ex
pressed the desire may have the capabili
ty to kill Americans."
"We have to investigate that individ
ual. If we do not, we are not doing our
job. The difficult tension that we have is
to allow and push aside and not inter
rupt those who are expressing their dif
ferent views . . . yet on the other hand
try to [investigate] those who are plan
ning a terrorist act."
While acknowledging that,, in the past,
the agency had abused its powers and
overrun civil liberties of certain groups of
Americans, Mueller strongly dismissed
the notion that these problems are taint
ing the current terrorist investigations.
Accused by several questioners and
protesters of being the head of an agency
that discriminates against Muslims and
Middle Easterners, Mueller denied the
use of race or religion as primary factors
in investigations.
"We do not target individuals or
groups by reason of their country of ori
gin or nationality," he said. "Rather, we
take investigative steps when there is a

factual basis justifying that step."
However Mueller did ac
knowledge that the majority of
terrorist investigations since
Sept. 11 have involved Muslims
or Middle Easterners.
"The overwhelming majority of
Muslims in this country and
around the world are peaceful,
law-abiding citizens," lie said.
"However, a small number of Mus
lims are members of radical funda
mentalist sects sworn to the de
struction of the United States, and
this presents a dilemma for those
charged with protecting against
the next attack, raising difficult in

vestigative issues for which there
often is no dear answer."
The approximately 20 protest
ers gathered outside of Memorial
Auditorium were not so quick to
accept the investigative premises
of the FBI. Bearing signs like "Big
Brother is watching" and
"Mueller, Director of Ministry of
Truth," protesters decried what
they perceive as a grave threat to
minorities and general freedoms
in the United States.
Students dressed as FBI agents
made mock arrests of Middle East
erners and Muslims and pretend
ed to detain them indefinitely
without civil liberties.
In the background, a mega
phone droned, "Out of respect for
tonight's speakers and your fellow
audience members, we would like

to remind you that there will be no
Hash photography... no men of
Middle Eastern descent between
the ages of 18-35, no oversize
handbags, no political dissent of
any kind . . . and no civil liberties
allowed inside the building."
Sophomore Ryan Hebert and
other protesters spoke against
the extension of the agency's
power and its detainment of Mus
lims. They also objected to
Mueller's winning of a presti
gious international award.
"We're here because we believe
it's very dangerous to sacrifice
freedoms in the name of security,
and we have a lot of grave concerns
about what's been happening to
our civil liberties," Hebert said.
After the speech, law student
and protester Shahid Buttar said

he was disappointed.
"All Mueller had to say was that
his administration's positions and
actions are defensible, when any
objective look at the record indi
cates otherwise."
At a press conference following
the speech, Mueller warned that
another terrorist attack on Ameri
can soil may be imminent.
Since al-Qaida published two
warnings of imminent attacks two
weeks ago, "we've had an attack
on the French tanker in Yemen,
you have an explosion in Bali,
you have marines killed in
Kuwait, and you have just today
one more in a series of bombings
in the Philippines," he said. "You
cannot believe that those attacks
would not also extend to the
United States."
