# OSP to announce Australia center
## Program to focus on biology in the Great Barrier Reef 
### ELIZABETH MADJLESSI STAFF WRITER 
Beginning in Fall 2003, stu
dents will be able to study
abroad in a new location. The
Overseas Studies Program is
opening a new study center â€”
down under.
In conjunction with the Uni
versity of Queensland's Aus
tralian Coastal Studies and Cen
tre for Marine Studies, between
24 and 48 Stanford students will
be able to study bioecology in
the Great Barrier Reef.
"This program will be dif
ferent from the others OSP of
fers, since the Great Barrier
Reef is so unique," said Amos
Nur, academic director of
Overseas Studies. "Students
will do a ten-week research
project with a topic linked to
the Great Barrier Reef and to
his or her own interest ."
Applications are open to
everyone, though "there will
probably be basic biology or
chemistry prerequisites," Nur
said. "They may even be high
school-level requirements."
Susan Christopher, acade
mic program officer at Over
seas Studies, said that part of
tlie motivation to open the
Australia center was to diversi

fy the academic offerings of
Overseas Studies.
"The motivation for this en
deavor comes in part from the
degree that it offers content in
Biological Science and Marine
Studies," Christopher said.
"Biology students tend to be
slightly underrepresented in
other OSP programs, even
though Biology is one of the
largest majors here. This pro
gram will serve to cut across
different interests."
Students will also be able to
take courses about Australia's
indigenous peoples from the
University of Queensland, in
addition to more scientific offer
ings.
"Earth systems has already
accepted credit for this pro
gram, but we have not heard
the final word from the Biology
Department," Nur said.
The length of the program's
life has yet to be determined.
"There is a good chance that
the program will last two years,
given enough interest in the
first year to justify repeating it,"
Nur said.
Several factors came into
play in allowing the launch of
tliis program.
According to Christopher,
who conducted a survey of
graduating seniors who had not
studied abroad, Overseas Stud
ies discovered a "surprisingly
great interest" in this region.
