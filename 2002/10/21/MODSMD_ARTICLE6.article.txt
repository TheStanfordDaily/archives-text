# LAS to propose master's program to Dean of H&S
## 
### NATALIE AHN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This week, Prof. Jim Fox, director of the
Center for Latin American Studies, will
submit a proposal fora new masters pro
gram in Latin American Studies to Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Sharon Long.
The CIAS lost its bachelor's and master's
degree programs last December when the
Committee for Undergraduate Studies de
cided not to renew them due to a lack of fac
ulty involvement. The center has been revis
ing its structure and programs since then,
working to regain degree-granting status.
Although it cannot grant degrees, (he
center still provides many other opportuni
ties in Latin American Studies, such as a
minor and an honors program.
"It is important to get the degree pro
grams back as soon as possible, because 1
began to realize that without them, the cen
ter was weaker overall," said Fox. "We

bring great speakers and visiting faculty
from all over. As long as you have a core of
students who call the center their own, you
can guarantee that there will he a core of at
tendees for speakers. Without that core, we
lose a lot of life here."
Fox became the director of the (".lAS
after I lie degree programs were ended, and
he has made many changes to the center in
recent months. 1 le is planning several pilot
programs including an initiative to distrib
ute research funds to students. He has im
proved the center's available facilities by
creating a new student resource center
named after Prof. John 1). Wirth of Latin
American Studies, who died last June. Fox
is also fostering opportunities for students
to pursue honors in LAS by teaching the
program's Summer 1 lonors College.
"We do have a lot of students involved in
our programs, just not our degree pro-

grams," said Caroline Schultz, the
center's public programs coordi
nator. "[Fox] is great with stu
dents, he's very student-oriented
and very focused on their needs."
Students come to the center for
classes and resources on Latin
American Studies, as a meeting
place or study place complete with
new computers, and to pursue
their own initiatives in LAS. Schultz
works with eight student-run work
ing groups on different Latin
American themes, which sponsor
student activities such as a discus
sion forum on elections in Brazil,
which is being planned for this year.
"To me, Bolivar House and
LAS signify what Stanford
could — and should — be," said
senior Nat Corey-Moran, a stu
dent in the center's honors pro
gram. "[LAS is] an intimate com
munity of scholars, students and
teachers, from diverse back
grounds, with incredible experi
ences, representing different
points of view, all united in their
common interests."
Fox believes that there is now
an implicit deadline for beginning
the process to reinstate the degree
programs, with the deadline to
apply for renewal of the center's
Title XI Grant from the California
Department of Education coming
up on Nov. 12.
"We have to demonstrate that
the University is behind the cen
ter," Fox said, regarding the ap

plication for Title XI. "I think that
the fact that they took the pro
grams away is a clear vote of no
confidence in the center."
Fox said that the reasons stated
for ending the programs were
mainly the lack of support and loy
alty by faculty, since this is an in
terdisciplinary area studies pro
gram without its own department.
"The real problem is that none
of the critiques of our master's pro
gram suggested that there was any
thing wrong with the structure of
the program itself," Fox said. "It's a
very strong program. The main
change needed is to get faculty to
feel loyal and supportive of the cen
ter so they will take on advising out
side of their departments."
"Tenure-line faculty need to
sponsor student projects on LAS,
and they need to show interest in
and enthusiasm for participating
and teaching in the program," said
senior J ill Redhage, who was able to
declare her Latin American Studies
major before the program ended.
Fox will be soliciting commit
ments from Latin American Stud
ies-affiliated faculty to go along
with the new degree program
proposal.
The center is pursuing the mas
ter's program first since there is a
longer timeline for bringing mas
ter's students back in than under
graduates. Fox is consulting with
Cognizant Dean Judy Goldstein
011 the master's proposal, which
will then go to Long and eventual
ly to the Faculty Senate fora vote.
"1 hope the vote will take place
this fall so we can start recruiting
master's students for next year,"

Fox said. "We'll then re-assess our
position with the undergraduate
degree and probably go forward
immediately with that."
Master's students must be ac
cepted specifically into their pro
gram in order to come to Stanford.
Once a bachelor's program be
comes active, students already at
Stanford can begin to apply for that
major.
Students, faculty and staff have
shown strong interest in the contin
uation of the programs. According
to the center's receptionist Kaila
Jimenez, many students use the cen
ter, and many more wish to come to
Stanford to take advantage of it.
"I think most people were in
terested in the center because of
this M.A. program we had,"
Jiminez said.
On the ending of the program,
she said, "It was a shock to every
one. I get a lot of calls asking when
it will be back on."
"Stanford has a historic, current,
and future connection to Latin
America," Corey-Moran said. "The
cancellation of the degree programs
last December is distressing because
it represents a lack of appreciation
for the past and a lack of vision into
the future."
Fox said that they have been in
"a bit of an uphill fight," but he re
mains optimistic.
"Dean Long did indicate to me
at the end of the spring that she
would like to get a master's pro
gram proposal from me and be
able to indicate to the Department
of Education that the University is
in support of Latin American Stud
ies," he said.
