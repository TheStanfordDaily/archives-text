### NATALIE AHN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This week, Prof. Jim Fox, director of the
Center for Latin American Studies, will
submit a proposal fora new masters pro
gram in Latin American Studies to Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Sharon Long.
The CIAS lost its bachelor's and master's
degree programs last December when the
Committee for Undergraduate Studies de
cided not to renew them due to a lack of fac

working to regain degree-granting status.
Although it cannot grant degrees, (he
center still provides many other opportuni
ties in Latin American Studies, such as a
minor and an honors program.
"It is important to get the degree pro
grams back as soon as possible, because 1
began to realize that without them, the cen

bring great speakers and visiting faculty
from all over. As long as you have a core of
students who call the center their own, you
can guarantee that there will he a core of at
tendees for speakers. Without that core, we
lose a lot of life here."
Fox became the director of the (".lAS
after I lie degree programs were ended, and
he has made many changes to the center in
recent months. 1 le is planning several pilot
programs including an initiative to distrib
ute research funds to students. He has im
proved the center's available facilities by
creating a new student resource center
named after Prof. John 1). Wirth of Latin
American Studies, who died last June. Fox
is also fostering opportunities for students
to pursue honors in LAS by teaching the
program's Summer 1 lonors College.
"We do have a lot of students involved in
our programs, just not our degree pro-
