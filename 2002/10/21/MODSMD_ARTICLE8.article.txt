# Calendar of Events
## 
### 
Tonight at midnight is
Full Moon on the Quad.
The event is organized by
the Senior Class Presidents,
with funding coming from
all four class years. It will
take place in the Quad.
Full Moon on the Quad
is a Stanford tradition in
which seniors and freshmen
make out in the moonlight.
It is said that a freshman is
not a real Stanford student
until he has been kissed by a
senior.
Some go to the event to
kiss, others to pick up a new
romantic prospect, some just
go to watch the debauchery.
