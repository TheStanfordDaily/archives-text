## Authorities find clues about D.C. sniper 
### 
ASHLAND, Va. (AP) — Authorities
believe the Washington-area sniper
left a message with a telephone num
ber at the scene of the latest shooting
in Virginia, The Associated Press
learned yesterday. Police appealed to
the person who left the message to
contact them.
" 1 o the person who left us a message
at the Ponderosa last night. You gave us
a telephone number. We do want to
talk to you. Call us at the number you
provided. Thank you," Montgomery
County, Md., Police Chief Charles
Moose said in a televised briefing.
Moose made his cryptic statement as
sniper task force investigators said they
were working on the assumption that
the sniper has expanded his geograph
ic reach after shooting 11 people, nine
fatally, in the Washington area since
Oct. 2.
Surgeons succeeded yesterday night
in removing the bullet from the 37-
year-old man shot at the Ponderosa in
Ashland, Va., on Saturday night, and
turned it over to investigators for test
ing. Hospital spokeswoman Pam Lep
ley did not know the bullet's condition.
The victim remained in critical con
dition after three hours of surgery.
Lepley said doctors were cautiously op
timistic but expect the man will need
more surgery.
Public schools in the Ashland and
Richmond area will be closed tomor
row, affecting more than 200,000 stu
dents, "based on the volume of parent
and community concern," school offi
cials announced late yesterday. After
the earlier sniper slayings, schools re
stricted activities but did not close.
Moose refused to elaborate or take

questions about the message left at the
steakhouse or how it was left. But he
asked the news media to "carry it clear
ly and carry it often."
After the briefing, Officer Joyce
Utter, spokeswoman for Montgomery
County police, said Moose's statement
"should make complete sense" to the
person who left the message.
"That is the only person Chief
Moose wants to talk to," she said.
A law enforcement source close to

the investigation said the person who
left the message is probably the sniper
who is responsible for the Washington
area shootings.
Investigators who combed the area
outside the Ponderosa finished their
search yesterday but said little about
what, if anything, they had found.
Some witnesses said they heard a
shot coming from a wooded area near
t lie restaurant, but nobody reported
seeing the shooter.

If the shooting is linked to the sniper
attacks, it would be the first weekend at
tack and the farthest the sniper has
traveled — about 85 miles south of
Washington.
The longest previous distance from
the Washington area was Spotsylvania
County, about 50 miles south of Wash
ington. It would also break die longest
lull between shootings, about five days.
Former FBI profiler Clinton Van
Xandt said Saturday's shooting, if relat
ed, could show the killer's approach is
changing in response to law enforce
ment tactics. For instance, reports last
week that military surveillance planes
would be used in the Washington sub
urbs probably prompted the sniper to
move farther away, he said.
And since much had been made
about the weekend lulls, "I think he re
acted to that," Van Zandt said.
Authorities in Maryland, mean
while, continued testing a shell casing
found in a white rental truck to deter
mine if it could be linked to the sniper
attacks. Police said it would be at least
tomorrow before they could announce
whether the casing is connected to the
shootings.
A source close to the investigation,
however, said yesterday that "it has
nothing to do with this case." The
source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, would not confirm reports
that the shell was .30-caliber, a different
size from the sniper's bullets, but said:
"It's got caliber problems, it's got age
problems."
The shell casing was found in a car
seized at a rental agency near Dulles In
ternational Airport in Virginia, author
ities said.

If the shooting is linked to the sniper
attacks, it would be the first weekend at
tack and the farthest the sniper has
traveled — about 85 miles south of
Washington.
The longest previous distance from
the Washington area was Spotsylvania
County, about 50 miles south of Wash
ington. It would also break die longest
lull between shootings, about five days.
Former FBI profiler Clinton Van
Xandt said Saturday's shooting, if relat
ed, could show the killer's approach is
changing in response to law enforce
ment tactics. For instance, reports last
week that military surveillance planes
would be used in the Washington sub
urbs probably prompted the sniper to
move farther away, he said.
And since much had been made
about the weekend lulls, "I think he re
acted to that," Van Zandt said.
Authorities in Maryland, mean
while, continued testing a shell casing
found in a white rental truck to deter
mine if it could be linked to the sniper
attacks. Police said it would be at least
tomorrow before they could announce
whether the casing is connected to the
shootings.
A source close to the investigation,
however, said yesterday that "it has
nothing to do with this case." The
source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, would not confirm reports
that the shell was .30-caliber, a different
size from the sniper's bullets, but said:
"It's got caliber problems, it's got age
problems."
The shell casing was found in a car
seized at a rental agency near Dulles In
ternational Airport in Virginia, author
ities said.
