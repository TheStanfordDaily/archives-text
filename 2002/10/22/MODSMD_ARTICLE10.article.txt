# D.C. area sniper tried to contact authorities
## 
### 
ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP)— In a
tantalizing turn in the hunt for the
Washington-area sniper, investi
gators said yesterday the killer ap
parently tried to contact them in a
phone call that was too "unclear"
to be understood. They pleaded
with the person to call back.
The announcement came
hours after Virginia authorities
surrounded a white van parked at
a pay phone in Richmond, Va.,
and seized two men. Police later
said the men had nothing to do
with the case and would be de
ported for immigration violations.
The most intriguing develop
ment came from Montgomery
County Police Chief Charles
Moose, who is in charge of the in
vestigation.
Moose disclosed for the first
time that a call had been received
from someone of high interest to
investigators — but the call was
somehow muddled.
"The person you called could not
hear everything you said. The audio
was unclear and we want to get it
right. Call us back so that we can
clearly understand," Moose said.
He did not disclose who re
ceived the call, when or where it
was made or other details.
But investigators believe the call
may have come from the sniper
and that the caller was the same
person who left a note and phone
number Saturday night at the
scene of the latest shooting, a law
enforcement source told The .As

sociated Press on condition of
anonymity.
For the second consecutive day,
Moose seemed intent on establish
ing a dialogue with the killer. On
Sunday, he publicly pleaded with
the note writer to call authorities.
Early Monday, he said: "The
message that needs to be deliv
ered is that we are going to re
spond to a message that we have
received. We are preparing our
response at this time."
Moose said he could not discuss
the message further.
The (lurry of activity raised
hope there had been a break in
the search for the sniper who has
killed nine people and critically
wounded three others in Vir
ginia, Maryland and Washington
since Oct. 2.
The latest attack came Saturday
night in a steakhouse parking lot
in Ashland, just north of Rich
mond. The victim, a 37-year-old
man, was felled by a single shot to
the stomach.
He remained in critical but sta
ble condition at a Richmond hos
pital yesterday after having his
spleen and parts of his pancreas
and stomach removed. Surgeons
removed the bullet from the vic
tim, and authorities said yesterday
that ballistics tests had linked the
slug to the sniper.
Schools in Richmond and
three nearby counties were shut
down yesterday, idling 141,000
students.
