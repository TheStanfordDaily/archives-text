## The
						Stanford Daily Featuring diverse views promotes free speech 
### 
Published Since 1891

In a span of just two days last week,
Stanford hosted a pair of very different
speakers: Former Israeli Prime Minis
ter and Stanford alumnus Ehud Barak
addressed a capacity crowd at Memorial Au
ditorium on Wednesday night, and Amiri
Baraka, New Jersey's poet laureate, spoke at
Kresge Auditorium on Friday evening.
Though, ideologically, the speakers have lit
tle in common, we congratulate the Universi
ty for allowing both men to speak freely on
campus last week.
Barak's speech championed U.S. Presi
dent George W. Bush's foreign policies and
denounced terrorism and the Palestinian
leadership. Baraka, on the other hand, con
demned Bush and Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon and denounced the prospect of
war on Iraq, reciting his poem, "Somebody
Blew Up America,"in which he asks, "Who

knew the World Trade Center was gonna get
bombed / Who told 4,000 Israeli workers at
the Twin Towers / To stay home that day /
Why did Sharon stay away?"
Some members of the Stanford communi
ty had their own questions. Why did Stan
ford invite a pair of speakers with such diver
gent messages to speak within 48 hours of
each other? W r ho decided that Baraka's mes
sage —or Barak's, for that matter — was
worth listening to? Who does the University
really support?
The answers to these questions lie in Stan
ford's role as an institution of learning. As
such, Stanford has the right — in fact, the re
sponsibility —to promote freedom of ex
pression through open dialogue. Often, that
dialogue will lead to difficult questions. And
sometimes, those questions will anger, offend
and incense.

And then what? Shouldn't the University
step in? Shouldn't the administration avoid
conflict altogether by choosing one ideologi
cal stance to support? Or, better yet, by sim
ply steering clear of controversial guests?
Our answer is an emphatic no. If we were to
hold the University accountable for the opin
ions of every party involved in discourse, we
would run the risk of stifling free speech — at
a place where free speech should be
paramount. And if we were to allow the stub
born fear of disagreement to stifle discussion,
the risk would be even greater.
As Americans, even controversial speakers
— indeed, especially controversial speakers
— should feel free to voice their opinions.
And as citizens concerned with both aca
demics and activism, members of the Stan
ford community should feel free to voice
their own.

I his editorial represents the views of the members of The Daily's editorial board. The board consists of The Daily's editor in chief, managing editor for daily special sections, two opinions
editors and three community members at-large. Signed columns and contributions are the view of the writer and do not necessarily represent the view of the editorial board.

While we applaud the ASSU, the Univer
sity and other campus organizations for
bringing many high-profile speakers to Stan
ford in the past week, we also recognize the
importance of bringing off-beat, lesser
known figures to the University, like photog
rapher Tom Van Dyke, who documents Mex
ican immigration through his art.
So why should Stanford host speakers with
many different views and ideas? Why should
those speakers be allowed to say things that
might upset audiences? And why should
members of the Stanford community hear the
thoughts of those whose opinions diverge
from their own?
It is because, if freedom of expression is
truly respected, and if dialogue is truly open
and critical, every difficult question will be
met with the most constructive kind of an
swer: a new question.
