# NOTES FROM THE UNDERCLASS
## Can I trust anyone yet? 
### 
I don't know whom to trust yet. I can't
trust the people in my dorm.
They've been trying to kill me with
saltines and water all week long.
Can't trust my clock; it's trying to drive me
insane. Who, or what, am 1 supposed to
trust?
I should be able to trust my clocks.
They're inanimate objects. But I can't. On
the first day of school, I synchronized my
alarm clock with my roommate's, and now
we're both about seven minutes fast. But
I'm afraid to change it back, because I'm
now convinced that I can leave my room at
8:55 a.m., go to the bathroom, and bike to
the other side of the Main Quad by 9:00
a.m.. Fora while, before I realized I was
seven minutes ahead of the rest of campus,
I kept getting really annoyed at my teach-

ers and my classmates,
because they were always
late to class.
Does anyone else have
upstairs neighbors who
use their windows as a
garbage chute? I'm not
sure if I can trust my up
stairs neighbors, as they
seem to be trying to kill

me. I love them dearly, and they have yet
to dispose of anything other than various
states of water out the window, but it's still
really disconcerting when I'm sitting in
my room, and it looks like the heavens are
opening above me.
While my upstairs neighbors are try
ing to bean me in the head with ice cubes,
some of my other dormmates are trying
to choke me to death with crackers. I was
sitting in the dining hall the other day,
when one of the Otero girls postulated
that it was impossible to eat five saltine
crackers in a minute. This didn't seem
like such a problem to me, so I rose to the
challenge.
Before 1 noticed she was gone, there
was a stack of five crackers on my tray. By
this point, both Oteran tables were watch
ing, and my RA was looking for an official
timer. I asked if this was the type of behav
ior he was supposed to be discouraging.
He said no.
I couldn't do it. I tried eating two at a
time, but they just wouldn't go down (part
of the rules involved not drinking any
thing). By the third and fourth cracker, I
had a giant ball of reprocessed starch that
wasn't going anywhere. 1 didn't think I'd
make it at all, but I got the last one down
15 seconds late (The trick, I'm told, is to se
cretly build up a store of saliva before the
competition starts).
The moral of all this? Don't trust your
dormmates; they're secretly trying to kill
you.
But if you can't trust your dormmates,
whom can you trust? Who are my real
friends? (And have they all got the bends?)
It's only a month into school; I don't think
we have real friends yet (unless you
brought them from home), but the inti

macy of dorm life gives us that special and
dangerous bond. We're willing to reveal
so much, but should we? Do you ever get
wrapped up in telling a story and sudden
ly wonder if you're telling it to the wrong
person?
Regardless, my dormmates are the
people I have to trust, because I've volun
tarily marooned myself thousands of miles
from home, and these people have been
randomly selected to be my support
group. My dormmates are the first to
know when I'm having trouble with my
column, even if they don't want to be, and
I'm the second person they ask to edit
their papers (first, if my dorm's writing in
structor isn't around).
Basically, your roommate is the only
one who knows if you're trying to be a new
person, because they see you when you let
your guard down. When you stop being
someone new and slip into old, comfort
able habits. It's those new, phony person
alities that make it hard to figure out who
to trust.
Did anyone else expect to show up at
college a different person? And then were
you really surprised to find out you
weren't much different from the person
you were four months ago, when you
graduated from high school? I know I
was. I was really surprised when I got to
my first party, and I was the same guy who
was too self-conscious to dance. Same guy,
different clothes.
It's not like I want to be the geek on the
sidelines, nursing a Coke and hoping
someone will drag him onto the dance
floor. But I don't know any other way to
be. Is this who I want to be? I don't think
so, since it didn't get me where I wanted to
be in high school. But I don't know how to
be anyone else. And even if I tried,
wouldn't it be the phoniest thing in the
world? Who do I want to be? And does
that persona involve drinking?
It'll all work out. The fog is clearing,
and normal, complete people are emerg
ing. It's good to see. I don't think I'm
going to go get smashed and be the life of
a party tomorrow night, and not just be
cause it'll be Wednesday night, but be
cause that's not me. Maybe Ill have a little
beer and do a little dancing next time;
maybe I won't. Maybe I'll stop trying so
hard and just let it happen naturally. If
Stanford wants me to party, it'll give me a
sign; if Stanford wants me to study, it'll
give me a sign (that B- / C+ on my CS as
signment was almost enough to convince
me). Maybe, if you see me at a party (and
no, I'm not as scary-looking as that mug
shot might have led you to believe), maybe
drag me onto the dance floor. I'll thank
you later.
