Allowing Baraka to speak
is 'outrageous'
Last Friday, Amiri Baraka, ne Le√üoi
Jones, gave a speech in Kresge Auditori
um sponsored by the Committee on Black
Performing Arts.
Who is this Baraka, you ask? Besides
the fact that he is about to be stripped of
his title as the New Jersey Poet Laureate,
Baraka's latest claim to fame is an anti-
Semitic poem entitled "Somebody Blew
Up America," with the following stanza:
"Who knew the World Trade Center was
gonna get bombed / Who told 4000 Israeli
workers at the Twin Towers/To stay
home that day / Why did Sharon stay
away?"
In the poem, Baraka propagates the
unsubstantiated lie that the Israelis
bombed the World Trade Center. Of
course, Baraka chooses to couch his anti-
Semitism in the fashionable cloak of anti-
Zionism, but this latest poem follows a
long list of Baraka's anti-Semitic state
ments from the 'GO's to the '80's, including
such notoriously virulent poems as "Black
Art," with its famous line: "We want.. .
dagger poems in the slimy bellies of the
owner-jews."
Or how about the following excerpt
from Baraka's poem entitled, "For Fom
Postell, Dead Black Poet:"
"Smile, jew. Dance, jew. Tell me you
love me, jew .... I got the extermina
tion blues, jewboys. 1 got the hitler syn

drome figured."
At this point, I have to ask the Committee
on Black Performing Aits who they will in
vite to campus next under the guise of free
speech. David Duke? Louis Farrakhan? Or
perhaps the leader of Hamas? I've heard
lie's written some poems too.
Don't get me wrong; this is a free coun
try, I am a strong believer in the Bill of
Rights, and Baraka has a right to stand in
the middle of a public park and, if he
chooses to do so, scream about a Zionist
conspiracy. Of course, all of this on his
own time and money. But to provide
sponsorship fora man like Baraka to spew
this filth in a forum like Kresge Auditori
um is not just morally reprehensible, it's
outrageous. The Committee on Black
Performing Arts ought to be ashamed of
themselves.

Baraka's words ring of
'anti-Semitism'
Dear Mr. Baraka: I'm so glad that you
have found the root of the world's prob
lems. They were guilty all along, those
Jews. There is a pattern I see, a pattern
that you help elucidate. For not only were
the Jews involved in Sept. 11, they can be
traced back to many a calamity in history.
They are reported to have caused the

Black Plague. In Russia they kidnapped
Christian children and made pastries out
of their blood. They were, as Hitler point
ed out, responsible for the economic prob
lems of Germany. And now, with a state of
their own, they are helping wreak havoc
across the globe with their knowledge of
attacks on New York and Washington.
History speaks loud and clear. Mr.
Baraka, I applaud you, for you now join
the ranks of many illustrious men who
have given us the word anti-Semitism.
