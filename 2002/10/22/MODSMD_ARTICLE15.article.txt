# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## The 						season's latest trend: fashion mags feature 'breast cancer culture' 
### TACY CONARD GUEST COLUMNIST 
The fall colors are out, and for women's magazines
that means October issues are popping with pink. It's
National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, the in-sea
son for targeting consumers eager to give back while
shopping for themselves.
The cause of fighting breast cancer finds itself in a
unique position when it comes to consumerism. Look
at the advertisements and product profiles in
women's fashion magazines this month. An array of
companies are pledging to give varying percentages
of product proceeds to breast cancer organizations.
When leafing through these ads, consumers and ac
tivists need to ask an important question: What am I
buying into when 1 purchase a certain product that is
linked with breast cancer?
Breast cancer has become fashionable for corpo
rate America, leaving us in what some call a "breast
cancer culture." In the November 2001 issue of Harp
er's Magazine, Barbara Ehrenreich skillfully explains
the commercialization that has taken over breast can
cer in her article, "Welcome to Cancerland; A Mam
mogram Leads to a Cult of Pink Kitsch." She ques
tions what is conveyed when makeup, teddy bears
and everything pink are used to symbolize women
with breast cancer. For each of us faced with breast
cancer-related ads this October, here is a good ques
tion to ask: Am I comfortable with the image of breast
cancer that a company chooses to market?
By cloaking breast cancer in pink and offering pink
versions of warm, fuzzy, feminine products, are we
minimizing the serious stakes of breast cancer? Is mak
ing breast cancer trendy a good idea? As fashion mag
azines will tell you, what's in today is out tomorrow.
Today, cause-marketing is in. For those concerned
about breast cancer, there needs to be another kind of
breast cancer "awareness." In October and beyond,
be aware that you may be more comfortable and em
powered by giving directly to an organization. (After
all, online donations are as fast and simple as shop
ping on the web.) Or, if you like the idea of buying a

The following Web sites offer a range of

needed product and simultaneously giving back to a
cause of interest, be aware of how your money is spent
when proceeds "go to breast cancer."
Note the fine print in an InStyle ad this month for
Ann Taylor's "exclusive t-shirt" promoting National
Breast Cancer Awareness Month. You will see that
100 percent of proceeds go toward putting on a
fundraising event. If you want your money to go di
rectly to research and programs, and not a party that
may or may not raise more funds, this is a crucial piece
of information. Read this kind of fine print. Find out
if you agree with the agendas of the organizations that
receive such funds. There are complex and differing
views between breast cancer organizations.
So here is the challenge this fall, when it comes to
National Breast Cancer Awareness Month: Embrace
the idea of "awareness" in its true sense. If we're faced
with a breast cancer commodity culture, buy wisely.
Buy into a new movement to combat this commer
cialism, or simply know where your money is going.
