Everyone watching the races knows

tional title after dominating the I're-Na
tional Championships in Terre Haute,
Ind., last Saturday.
The conditions were nearly perfect
and the competition responded with
great performances on the same course
that will host the NCAA Championships

on Nov. 25.
Because of the sheer number of run
ners, the field was split into two divisions
and the nationally-ranked teams were di
vided evenly between them.
Racing in the Blue Division, the Cardinal
placed five runners in the top 10 to claim the
team title with only 27 points. Runner-up
Northern Arizona, which is ranked No. 4 in
the country, scored 92 points.
Individual winner Kip Kangogo of
Brigham Young led his No. 10 Cougars to
a third-place finish.
"The guys did an excellent job of exe
cuting our strategy," said Stanford assis
tant coach Mike Reilly. "They communi
cated well throughout the race and helped
each other along."
In the race, the Cardinal started strong,
putting four runners in the front pack
early on. Freshman Peter Meindl took po
sition at the back of the lead pack while ju
nior Adam Tenforde and sophomore
Robert Smitson sat back and waited.
.Juniors Grant Robison and lan Dob
son, who were making their debut this
weekend, led the Cardinal squad into the
finish chute. Robison covered the 8,000-
meter course in 23 minutes, 46 seconds to
claim second place in a close finish, just 0.2
seconds off of Kangogo. Dobson finished
right behind Robison in third at 23:49.
Juniors Don Sage and Louis Luchini
followed their teammates closely, claim
ing sixth and seventh in 24:02.0 and
24:02.3, respectively.
Meindl (9th, 24:06.7) rounded out the
Cardinal scoring in his first race in a Stan
ford uniform.
Tenforde moved up steadily through
the last half of the race to claim 14th, cov
ering the course in 24:16. Smitson com
pleted the Cardinal's effort with a strong
30th-place finish in 24:43.
In the open race, redshirt freshmen
Neil Davis (3rd, 24:39) and Justin Roma
niuk (6th, 24:59) added two more great
performances for the Cardinal.
In the White Division, No. 3 Colorado
took the first three individual spots and
claimed the team title with 87 points. Col
orado senior Jorge Torres, one of the fa
vorites for the individual national title this
year, won the race in a blazing 23:34.
If the performances in both races were
combined, the Cardinal would have
scored only 41 points to the Buffaloes' 162
