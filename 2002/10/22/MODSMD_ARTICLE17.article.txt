# Women stay on top

### MATT BABIN STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's soccer team fi
nally came back to Maloney Field last
weekend for its first home matches in
three weeks. And while the scenery may
have seemed a little different after being
gone for so long, at the end of the week
end, the result was similar to many
other weekends this year â€” two Cardi
nal wins.

-Friday: N0...l Stanford 2, Oregon St. 0
Sunday: Stanford 3, Oregon 0

Stanford posted a 2-0 victory over
Oregon State Friday night before tak
ing Sunday's finale 3-0 over Oregon.
The wins ran the Cardinal's record to
13-1-0, a mark that includes 10
shutouts. The weekend's results also
kept the Cardinal on top of the Pacific
-10 Conference standings, with a perfect

4-0-0 record.
The Cardinal wasted no rime getting
started Friday night, finding the back of
the net just 1 :4(> into the contest. Junior
striker Marcie Ward played the ball to se
nior midfielder Katherine Harrington,
who then fed senior striker Marcia VVallis.
Wallis easily beat the Beavers' keeper for
the early lead.
The Beavers came back with a resilient
counterattack, which included one shot
that hit the post and another that forced
sophomore keeper Nicole Barnhart to
make a tough save.
The first half, however, was dominated
by the Cardinal, which outshot the visitors
10-2 and seemed to have the Beavers back
on their heels.
The Stanford women didn't let up in
the second half, coming out of the break
firing. Numerous players put shots on
goal, the most dramatic of which was
sophomore striker Natalie Sanderson's
