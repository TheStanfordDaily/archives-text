# Women stay on top

### MATT BABIN STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's soccer team fi
nally came back to Maloney Field last
weekend for its first home matches in
three weeks. And while the scenery may
have seemed a little different after being
gone for so long, at the end of the week
end, the result was similar to many
other weekends this year â€” two Cardi
nal wins.

-Friday: N0...l Stanford 2, Oregon St. 0
Sunday: Stanford 3, Oregon 0

Stanford posted a 2-0 victory over
Oregon State Friday night before tak
ing Sunday's finale 3-0 over Oregon.
The wins ran the Cardinal's record to
13-1-0, a mark that includes 10
shutouts. The weekend's results also
kept the Cardinal on top of the Pacific
-10 Conference standings, with a perfect

4-0-0 record.
The Cardinal wasted no rime getting
started Friday night, finding the back of
the net just 1 :4(> into the contest. Junior
striker Marcie Ward played the ball to se
nior midfielder Katherine Harrington,
who then fed senior striker Marcia VVallis.
Wallis easily beat the Beavers' keeper for
the early lead.
The Beavers came back with a resilient
counterattack, which included one shot
that hit the post and another that forced
sophomore keeper Nicole Barnhart to
make a tough save.
The first half, however, was dominated
by the Cardinal, which outshot the visitors
10-2 and seemed to have the Beavers back
on their heels.
The Stanford women didn't let up in
the second half, coming out of the break
firing. Numerous players put shots on
goal, the most dramatic of which was
sophomore striker Natalie Sanderson's

hit post shot in the 55th minute.
It was not until the 72ncl
minute that the Cardinal added to
its lead. Senior midfielder Callie
Withers blasted a shot past the
Oregon State keeper for her
fourth goal of the year.
Withers came close to scoring
again just four minutes later but
just missed the mark as her shot
clanged off the post. Senior mid
fielder Kelsey Carlson also nearly
netted the Cardinal's third goal of
the game in the waning minutes,
but her shot barely missed the
mouth of the goal.
While it was the usual suspects
who led the Cardinal in the first
game of the weekend, it was Stan
ford's bench that led the way on
Sunday.
Running with a slightly al
tered lineup due to injuries,
Stanford dominated the early
part of the game but was unable
to get onto the board until the
26th minute. Ward stole the ball
from a defender and dished it to
Wallis just before being tackled.
Wallis was then able to find the
back of the net for her sixth goal
of the season.
The rest of the game was all
Stanford, as the Ducks were only
able to get off one shot while the
Cardinal pressured Oregon with

25 shots of its own.
The final two goals were netted
by freshman Leah Tapscott and
sophomore Amy Grady, who both
scored their first collegiate goals.
Tapscott headed in a corner kick,
and Grady curled in a 25-yard shot
over the Oregon keeper.
"We went pretty deep on the
bench and got two goals from the
bench," co-coach Stephanie Erick
son said. "It was a great team per
formance today."
On a team stacked with great
players, it was the team effort that
brought the Cardinal the win on
Sunday.
"Everyone on this team mat
ters," Erickson said. "The way
they push each other throughout
the week in training is what
makes us the best team. They
have chosen to have a great atti
tude, and we can't ask for more
because every time we put some
one in, they do great. The level
stays the same, if not better. The
depth is a huge asset."
Tapscott echoed Erickson's
comments.
"It's a privilege to get in [to a
game]," she said. "This is an amaz
ing team. It's the most talented
team I've ever been on. I just try to
help this team win in any way pos
sible. This is an amazing place and
an amazing time."
The Cardinal will look to con
tinue its run this weekend as it
travels north to take on Washing
ton and Washington State.
