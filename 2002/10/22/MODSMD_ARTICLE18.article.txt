# Card runners prevail

It is often said that predictions
are only worth the paper they are
printed on. I low the pundits think
a team will perform is often quite
different from the actual results on
race day.

However, at the Pre-NCAA
Meet at Indiana State on Saturday,
the polls actually did reflect the
outcome of the race.
No. 2 Stanford dominated its
field, scoring 57 points en route
to an easy victory over No. 26
Wake Forest (165) and No. 6
North Carolina State (199).
Stanford sophomore Alicia
Craig finished second with a
time of 20 minutes, 3 seconds for
the 6,000-meter course, putting
her eight seconds behind Flori
da State's Vicky Gill, who cap
tured the individual title.
The Pre-NCAAs are held a
month prior to nationals and allow
runners to test their fitness and
their competitors on the course
where the big NCAA showdown
will occur.
Every team with aspirations of
making NCAAs wants to try out
the course, so organizers are
faced with the task of splitting
over 90 teams into two equal
fields. Top-ranked Brigham
Young, last year's national cham
pion, was placed into the women's
blue race, while Stanford, by
virtue of its No. 2 ranking, head
ed the white race field.
Craig wasn't the only one to
perform well for the Cardinal. Fol
lowing close behind were her
teammates sophomore Sara Bei

(3rd, 20:13), senior Lauren Flesh
man (4th, 20:13) and senior Ma
lindi Elmore (9th, 20:29).
Although the Stanford results
were promising, the split field
meant that Stanford will return to
nationals without having faced its
principal-rival BYU or other
strong teams such as Colorado and
Georgetown.
Comparing times and finish po
sitions between the two fields — al
though somewhat speculative —
gives the Cardinal a rough indica
tion of what the team will face in
November.
"The fields seemed similarly
matched," Elmore said. "Al
though the races may have de
veloped differently, there was no
major difference between the
conditions, the teams or the indi
viduals in either the blue or
white races."
In the blue race, BYU was
similarly outstanding, as it
scored 55 points to comfortably
defeat No. 4 Colorado (143) and
No. 5 Georgetown (175). No
tably, the average time of the
seven BYU runners was 12 sec
onds slower than the Stanford
runners, and Craig, Bei and
Fleshman all outpaced BYU's
top finisher.
I lowever, the BYU times were
closely spaced about a mean,
with only 26 seconds separating
the first and fifth runners, indi
cating a tight pack. In contrast,
the difference between Stan
ford's first and fifth runner was
1:20.
While big gaps between run
ners can still lead to a win if the
front-runners place high
enough, they are usually fatal in
big races. Stanford's fifth run
ner, who represented the last
scoring position, was sophomore
Jeane Goff, who placed 39th in a

Sophomore Sara Bei runs at the Stanford Invitational earlier this year. Bei
and the No. 2 Stanford women's cross country team were victorious at the
2002 Pre-NCAA Meet at Indiana State on Saturday, which completed a
Cardinal sweep of men's and women's races.
