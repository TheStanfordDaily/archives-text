Nnamani. The entire
women's and men's vol
leyball teams.
I don't care who you pick, what
team you choose, but on my home
court, the Kappa Sigma lineup of
myself, Jan "my last name is very
similar to Spencer's old Spanish
teacher Juan Petrovsky" Piotro
vsky, Rudy "1 can sit on you" Rudi
ger, Hal "what's a lift?" Brands,
Matt "will tackle anyone who
blocks me" Twomey and Rahul
"the responsible one" Dhillon will
destroy them.
It won't even be a game.
You know whv?

We are masters
of our own des
tiny. We have bla
tant disregard for
the admittedly
limited capabilities
our bodies possess.
Once we step foot
on the Kappa Sig
sand volleyball
court, we are en-

tering a zone eclipsed of sight and
sound. We are entering a new di
mension, with new rules and with,
undoubtedly, more physical play.
We are entering a /one where testos
terone flows free, and the calming
voice of reason and responsibility
have no place to exist. We enter our
zone: The Cheater's Zone.
The Cheater's Zone is a place
where correct volleyball rules die.
While technically, the zone describes
the two-foot wide vertical imaginary
box that surrounds the net on either
side, you could say that its spirit runs
free throughout the sand.
On any random play, the ball
will get served in the court, the
other team will bump the ball, set it
and spike it. Simple enough. I low
ever, early 011 in the year, Rudy re
alized that he could easily "steal"
the other team's set, if it was close
enough to the net. Essentially, he

would reach over the net, aided by
his enormous wingspan and a net
lower than Tsuyoshi Shinjo's bat
ting average, and spike the ball
and the opposing player into the
ground. With blatant disregard
for the net and/or common de
cency, Rudy would commonly
hold the top of the net down for
added leverage, so far that the top
of the net was frequently lower
than the bottom of the net.
Now, if you know Rudy at all,
you know that he is intense, tall,
large and muscular. And if you are
unlucky enough to be Jonas Rod
denbery, you also know how it
feels to have your fingers dislocat
ed by try ing to block Rudy. Watch
ing Rudy going up against Jonas
was like watching Free Willy jump
over the kid on the rocks, only to
fall through the air, crushing the
poor child like a cheap Happy
Meal toy. Watching Jonas run for
ice afterward was just comical.
But the spirit of the ('.heater's
Zone, known by chronic offenders
as "Winners' Alley," lives through
out the court. Whether that be
Hal's "catch and throw" (a move
where he palms the ball mid-air
rand then chooses where to throw)
or Sin il Shah's failure to have hit a
"legal" ball yet, it doesn't matter.
The point is, where the varsity
teams call a foul, we play on.
You'd think there would be
some posting of rules, at least
something to stop the bickering
that undoubtedly follows every
Winners' Alley violation. But there
isn't, mainly because the most re
sponsible one, Rahul (he's the RA
too!), is by far the worst cheater.
He has modified his own catch
and-throw, will play the ball after it
has obviously hit the sand, will
barge into the net at top speed (ap
proximately 72 miles per hour)
and has also patented (lie "quick
