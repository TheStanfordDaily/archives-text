# Faculty discuss possible war in Iraq, plan action

### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Editor's Note: This article is the fourth in a weekly
series investigating the relationship between the
Stanford community and the potential war in Iraq.

Over the last several months, many Stan
ford students have begun to discuss the
prospect of a U.S.-led war against Iraq and
increasingly take action to advocate their
stances. With all the attention given to stu
dent activism, it is easy to overlook the fact
that faculty members are often just as inte
gral a part of the on-campus debate.
•Numerous Stanford professors and aca
demics have staked out positions on the
thorny issue of whether the United States
should take preemptive military action
against Iraq — as well as if such action
should be unilateral or coalition-based.
And, as war nears, many faculty are form
ing coalitions to advocate their positions to
both the University and the public.
The general sentiment of the faculty ap
pears to oppose war in Iraq.
Todd Davies, a Humanities and Sciences

lecturer, commented on the possibility of
military action.
"1 am opposed to the bombing and at
tempting to change the regime in Iraq —
especially unilaterally," Davies said. "It is
an act of conscience — I feel like I have a re
sponsibility to state my opinions. 1 have
spent at least a modicum of time exploring
the issues, and I would encourage others to
do likewise."
Joel Beinin, a professor of Middle East
history, explained that he feels the Bush ad
ministration has not made an adequate case
for an offensive against Iraq.
"That is not to say that Saddam Hussein
is a good leader or that the Iraqi regime
poses no threat to its neighbors," Beinin
said. "However, there is no solid evidence
that Iraq had anything to do with the Sep
tember 11 attacks... It is not likely that
Iraq has much in the way of chemical
weapons. Biological weapons are more un
certain. Iraq does not have nuclear
weapons. It has no missiles capable of
reaching the United States."

Scenes from last night's debaucherous Full Moon on the Quad show that Stanford kids are down with tomfoolery and balleyhoo.
