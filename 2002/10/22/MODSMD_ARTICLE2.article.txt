# Faculty discuss possible war in Iraq, plan action
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Editor's Note: This article is the fourth in a weekly
series investigating the relationship between the
Stanford community and the potential war in Iraq.

Over the last several months, many Stan
ford students have begun to discuss the
prospect of a U.S.-led war against Iraq and
increasingly take action to advocate their
stances. With all the attention given to stu
dent activism, it is easy to overlook the fact
that faculty members are often just as inte
gral a part of the on-campus debate.
•Numerous Stanford professors and aca
demics have staked out positions on the
thorny issue of whether the United States
should take preemptive military action
against Iraq — as well as if such action
should be unilateral or coalition-based.
And, as war nears, many faculty are form
ing coalitions to advocate their positions to
both the University and the public.
The general sentiment of the faculty ap
pears to oppose war in Iraq.
Todd Davies, a Humanities and Sciences

lecturer, commented on the possibility of
military action.
"1 am opposed to the bombing and at
tempting to change the regime in Iraq —
especially unilaterally," Davies said. "It is
an act of conscience — I feel like I have a re
sponsibility to state my opinions. 1 have
spent at least a modicum of time exploring
the issues, and I would encourage others to
do likewise."
Joel Beinin, a professor of Middle East
history, explained that he feels the Bush ad
ministration has not made an adequate case
for an offensive against Iraq.
"That is not to say that Saddam Hussein
is a good leader or that the Iraqi regime
poses no threat to its neighbors," Beinin
said. "However, there is no solid evidence
that Iraq had anything to do with the Sep
tember 11 attacks... It is not likely that
Iraq has much in the way of chemical
weapons. Biological weapons are more un
certain. Iraq does not have nuclear
weapons. It has no missiles capable of
reaching the United States."

Scenes from last night's debaucherous Full Moon on the Quad show that Stanford kids are down with tomfoolery and balleyhoo.
He also pointed out contradic
tions in the United States' foreign
policy.
"Iraq certainly has violated
U.N. Security Council resolu
tions," Beinin said. "But the Unit
ed States is in no position to make
this a criterion for military action
against Iraq, as U.S. Middle East
allies including Morocco, Turkey
and Israel have also violated such
resolutions and remain on excel
lent terms with the United States."
According to Paul Ehrlich, a
professor of biological studies, the
potential war effort is not about
terrorism, but "purely after oil."
He further commented that "I
think it is one of the stupidest ideas
our government has come up with
in my lifetime."
/ No Stanford professors that

The Daily contacted expressed
support for any sort of action in
Iraq, and most of those contacted
could not name a faculty member
who did.
Such lack of vocal support fora
preemptive strike against Iraq is
particularly striking given that
Bush's pro-war National Security
Advisor, Condoleezza Rice was se
lected directly from ranks of the
University's faculty.
While many faculty members at
Stanford have spoken out against
attacking Iraq, some have taken
their efforts a step further by
speaking out publicly in support
of their views and helping arrange
rallies and teach-ins.
"Faculty members opposed to
war have an obligation to let their
voices be heard and to share their
views with others before the first
bombs are dropped," said Khalil
Barhoum, coordinator of the Mid
dle Eastern and African Lan
guages and Literatures program.

An online petition opposing
war in Iraq that has collected en
dorsements from tens of thou
sands of members of the academic
community has already been
signed by over 40 Stanford faculty
from departments all across the
University.
Furthermore, faculty are start
ing to gather to plan ways they can
present a unified statement and
assist students.
Statistics Prof. Emeritus Charles
Stein held a meeting at his house
last week attended by seven faculty
members, who discussed ways to
further the anti-war campaign.
They have set up an e-mail list for
"progressive profs," plan to pur
chase an advertisement in The
Daily urging students to attend a
Sept. 26 anti-war rally in San Fran
cisco, and are organizing panels,
teach-ins and film viewings.
According to Stein, many facul
ty share the group's beliefs, but
simply are not as mobilized.

"Unfortunately, only a few [fac
ulty] are taking action, or only a
few are trying to get organized,"
Stein said. "But casual comments
tend to agree with us, but as far as
doing anything is concerned we
shall all have to see.
"I think most of the faculty are
against the war, but to come out and
say this publicly is something else."
The group met again last night,
and Computer Science Prof. Eric
Roberts, one of the faculty at the
original meeting, said that 18 fac
ulty members were in attendance
and that there are about 65 on the
mailing list.
When asked if he could name
any faculty who supported war
with Iraq, Roberts responded,
"No."
"Some faculty members were in
volved in planning the October 13
teach-in [on Iraq]," Beinin said.
"Some have a long term relation
ship with the Peninsula Peace and
Justice Center and continue to work

with the center to oppose a war on
Iraq .... I believe students should
take the lead in campus anti-war ac
tivity — or campus political activity
of any sort — though I would be
happy to work with any student
groups who want to oppose a war."
Davies expressed that he has
participated in a number of activist
efforts, including protests and the
distribution of flyers and e-mails
for anti-war petitions and events.
"I spoke at a small student gath
ering in White Plaza before Con
doleezza Rice [spoke at last year's
Commencement] with the Stu
dents Coalition for Peace and Jus
tice," Davies said.
While most professors feel that
they can make a difference on
campus, they are skeptical about
their ability to directly influence
national policy.
Harumi Befu, an emeritus pro
fessor of anthropology who is op
posed to military action in Iraq, de
clared that "Bush is not likely to lis

ten to academics — still, we should
make our views known to him."
Beinin concurred with Befu's
sentiments.
"Faculty members, as such,
have little direct impact on gov
ernment policy," Beinin said.
"Only those with connections to
the administration can directly
impact government policy. Most
of our impact on comes from
teaching our students. A small mi
nority of us write or otherwise ap
pear in the mass media."
Ehrlich described how he has
been writing to Congress mem
bers, talking to alumni about the
issues and distributing informa
tion in his attempt to convince oth
ers to oppose the potential war.
Reflecting on the significance of
faculty involvement, Davies ex
plained that "it is good for students
to see people, that their instructors
are human beings who have politi
cal opinions that they are willing it
voice in a constructive way."

According to Paul Ehrlich, a

terrorism, but "purely after oil."

preemptive strike against Iraq is
particularly striking given that
Bush's pro-war National Security
Advisor, Condoleezza Rice was se
lected directly from ranks of the
University's faculty.
While many faculty members at
Stanford have spoken out against
attacking Iraq, some have taken
their efforts a step further by
speaking out publicly in support
of their views and helping arrange
rallies and teach-ins.
"Faculty members opposed to
war have an obligation to let their
voices be heard and to share their
views with others before the first
bombs are dropped," said Khalil
Barhoum, coordinator of the Mid
dle Eastern and African Lan
guages and Literatures program.

An online petition opposing
war in Iraq that has collected en
dorsements from tens of thou
sands of members of the academic
community has already been
signed by over 40 Stanford faculty
from departments all across the
University.
Furthermore, faculty are start
ing to gather to plan ways they can
present a unified statement and
assist students.
Statistics Prof. Emeritus Charles
Stein held a meeting at his house
last week attended by seven faculty
members, who discussed ways to
further the anti-war campaign.
They have set up an e-mail list for
"progressive profs," plan to pur
chase an advertisement in The
Daily urging students to attend a
Sept. 26 anti-war rally in San Fran
cisco, and are organizing panels,
teach-ins and film viewings.
According to Stein, many facul
ty share the group's beliefs, but
simply are not as mobilized.

"Unfortunately, only a few [fac
ulty] are taking action, or only a
few are trying to get organized,"
Stein said. "But casual comments
tend to agree with us, but as far as
doing anything is concerned we
shall all have to see.
"I think most of the faculty are
against the war, but to come out and
say this publicly is something else."
The group met again last night,
and Computer Science Prof. Eric
Roberts, one of the faculty at the
original meeting, said that 18 fac
ulty members were in attendance
and that there are about 65 on the
mailing list.
When asked if he could name
any faculty who supported war
with Iraq, Roberts responded,
"No."
"Some faculty members were in
volved in planning the October 13
teach-in [on Iraq]," Beinin said.
"Some have a long term relation
ship with the Peninsula Peace and
Justice Center and continue to work

with the center to oppose a war on
Iraq .... I believe students should
take the lead in campus anti-war ac
tivity — or campus political activity
of any sort — though I would be
happy to work with any student
groups who want to oppose a war."
Davies expressed that he has
participated in a number of activist
efforts, including protests and the
distribution of flyers and e-mails
for anti-war petitions and events.
"I spoke at a small student gath
ering in White Plaza before Con
doleezza Rice [spoke at last year's
Commencement] with the Stu
dents Coalition for Peace and Jus
tice," Davies said.
While most professors feel that
they can make a difference on
campus, they are skeptical about
their ability to directly influence
national policy.
Harumi Befu, an emeritus pro
fessor of anthropology who is op
posed to military action in Iraq, de
clared that "Bush is not likely to lis

ten to academics — still, we should
make our views known to him."
Beinin concurred with Befu's
sentiments.
"Faculty members, as such,
have little direct impact on gov
ernment policy," Beinin said.
"Only those with connections to
the administration can directly
impact government policy. Most
of our impact on comes from
teaching our students. A small mi
nority of us write or otherwise ap
pear in the mass media."
Ehrlich described how he has
been writing to Congress mem
bers, talking to alumni about the
issues and distributing informa
tion in his attempt to convince oth
ers to oppose the potential war.
Reflecting on the significance of
faculty involvement, Davies ex
plained that "it is good for students
to see people, that their instructors
are human beings who have politi
cal opinions that they are willing it
voice in a constructive way."

Over the last several months, many Stan
ford students have begun to discuss the
prospect of a U.S.-led war against Iraq and
increasingly take action to advocate their
stances. With all the attention given to stu
dent activism, it is easy to overlook the fact
that faculty members are often just as inte
gral a part of the on-campus debate.
•Numerous Stanford professors and aca
demics have staked out positions on the
thorny issue of whether the United States
should take preemptive military action
against Iraq — as well as if such action
should be unilateral or coalition-based.
And, as war nears, many faculty are form
ing coalitions to advocate their positions to
both the University and the public.
The general sentiment of the faculty ap
pears to oppose war in Iraq.
Todd Davies, a Humanities and Sciences

lecturer, commented on the possibility of
military action.
"1 am opposed to the bombing and at
tempting to change the regime in Iraq —
especially unilaterally," Davies said. "It is
an act of conscience — I feel like I have a re
sponsibility to state my opinions. 1 have
spent at least a modicum of time exploring
the issues, and I would encourage others to
do likewise."
Joel Beinin, a professor of Middle East
history, explained that he feels the Bush ad
ministration has not made an adequate case
for an offensive against Iraq.
"That is not to say that Saddam Hussein
is a good leader or that the Iraqi regime
poses no threat to its neighbors," Beinin
said. "However, there is no solid evidence
that Iraq had anything to do with the Sep
tember 11 attacks... It is not likely that
Iraq has much in the way of chemical
weapons. Biological weapons are more un
certain. Iraq does not have nuclear
weapons. It has no missiles capable of
reaching the United States."

He also pointed out contradic
tions in the United States' foreign
policy.
"Iraq certainly has violated
U.N. Security Council resolu
tions," Beinin said. "But the Unit
ed States is in no position to make
this a criterion for military action
against Iraq, as U.S. Middle East
allies including Morocco, Turkey
and Israel have also violated such
resolutions and remain on excel
