Sunday: Stanford 0, Fresno St. 0

And yet, the streak continues.
With a heartbreaking 1-0 over
time loss to UCLA (8-1-1, 3-0-0
Pacific-10 Conference), the then-
No. 1 Cardinal men's soccer team
(11-2-1, 2-1-1) extended a four
game streak in which it has not
been able to defeat its archrival
from Los Angeles.
The Cardinal's loss to the Bruins
was only part one of a two-game
saga in the bottom half of the suite
this weekend. Stanford also found
itself Unable to break a scoreless tie
with lowly Fresno State on Sunday,
even after two overtime periods.
With the results, Stanford
dropped seven spots to No. 8 in this
week's NSCAA Coaches Poll.
"The weekend was a character
builder, going on the road, playing

two tough teams," said senior for
ward Roger Levesque, who re
turned from a knee injury. "We
ended up with a lie and a loss, but
we can learn from the experiences
we had and hopefully play better in
the future."
Character-builder or not, Stan
ford's loss to UCLA and tie to Fres
no State, coupled with the Bruins'
win over California yesterday,
leaves the Cardinal trailing in the
conference standings.
Although the weekend results
don't seem to indicate success,
coach Bret Simon was proud of his
team and believed that his players
played some of their best soccer of
the season.
"The guys did a great job
preparing, and I thought they
played well," Simon said. "We
played with a lot of heart for the
entire game, and that's all I can
ask out of them. I give a lot of
credit [to UCLA and Fresno
State]. They defended like mad
and played very well."
Simon attributed the Cardinal's
many overtime games this season to
its opponents' extra desire to play
well against Stanford.
"Our opponents are very deter
mined, and when we're ranked as

one of the best, teams will be keyed
for ns," Simon said. "When teams
are playing us close, it raises their
confidence level as the game pro
gresses. This allows them to keep
pushing hard."
Stanford's weekend started off
with UCLA continuing its three
year domination of the Cardinal.
"This was a big win for us, but we
still have more conference games
and more games to go in the sea
son," UCLA head coach Tom
Fitzgerald said. "But this keeps us
going in the right direction."
Stanford last beat UCLA on Oct.
8,2000, when the Cardinal won 1 -0
at home.
As characteristic of any match be
tween the two powerhouses, the
game was played fairly evenly until
the end of regulation.
Although Stanford put up 10
shots to the Bruins' six, the Cardi
nal was only able to put three of
them on goal. Stanford's best
chance came in the 50th minute,
when senior defender Todd
Dunivant placed a hard shot from
the left side that was kept out of
the goal by the Bruins' keeper
Zach Wells.
Wells played an excellent game,
keeping the potent Cardinal of
fense from getting any balls into the

back of the UCLA goal. One of the
key players that he managed to sti
fle was Levesque.
Levesque and Dunivant were
welcomed back to the Cardinal line
up after they took a few weeks off to
nurse injuries.
Ifanything positive were going
to be taken from the weekend, it
would be that Levesque and
Dunivant made a noticeable dif
ference on the field. Levesque
looked well-recovered, but Simon
had to sit Dunivant out of the
Fresno State match due to a reag
gravation of his injury.
The Cardinal gave itself a chance
to snap its losing streak against
UCLA by escaping regulation with
a tie.
However, Stanford's hopes to
get at least a point out of its West
wood trip fizzled quickly.
Ninety seconds into the first
overtime, the referee called a
hand-ball on the Cardinal, giving
UCLA a free kick right outside the
Stanford box.
Bruin midfielder Adolfo Gre
gorio then launched the ball over
the Stanford wall that Cardinal ju
nior keeper Robby Fulton was
able to knock away. But the re
bound came right to the feet of
UCLA forward Jimmy Frazelle,
who scored the game-winning
goal off t he Fulton deflection.
The loss didn't take away from
a strong defensive effort put forth
bv Stanford. Aside from the one

costly blunder in overtime, the
defensive unit played extremely
well, limiting UCLA to three shots
on goal.
Like on Friday, the Cardinal was
once again unlucky on the offen
sive side against Fresno State on
Sunday, as Stanford recorded
plenty of shots but was unable to
get on the scoreboard.
Junior forward Todd Leber
had the Cardinal's best chance of
the first half, rocketing a shot off
the goalpost, but the Bulldogs still
escaped with a 0-0 tie despite being
outshot 8-5 in the opening period.
Things turned around dra
matically in the second half as the
Bulldogs put on relentless pres
sure, registering five corner kicks
and outshooting Stanford 7-2.
However, regulation ended
without a score, and Stanford was
only able to register two shots in the
two ensuing overtime periods, lead
ing both teams to end the game
with a clean sheet.
Although Stanford's weekend
could have been much worse, the
Cardinal has a lot to prove to it
self and to the rest of the nation
as it faces California on the road
this Friday.
"Everybody is really tired after
two tough games," Levesque said.
"But against Cal, we're really ex
cited to get back out and prove
ourselves. It'll be a tough test, and
it will show the true character of
our team."

Sunday: Stanford 0, Fresno St. 0

And yet, the streak continues.
With a heartbreaking 1-0 over
time loss to UCLA (8-1-1, 3-0-0
Pacific-10 Conference), the then-
No. 1 Cardinal men's soccer team
(11-2-1, 2-1-1) extended a four
game streak in which it has not
been able to defeat its archrival
from Los Angeles.
The Cardinal's loss to the Bruins
was only part one of a two-game
saga in the bottom half of the suite
this weekend. Stanford also found
itself Unable to break a scoreless tie
with lowly Fresno State on Sunday,
even after two overtime periods.
With the results, Stanford
dropped seven spots to No. 8 in this
week's NSCAA Coaches Poll.
"The weekend was a character
builder, going on the road, playing

two tough teams," said senior for
ward Roger Levesque, who re
turned from a knee injury. "We
ended up with a lie and a loss, but
we can learn from the experiences
we had and hopefully play better in
the future."
Character-builder or not, Stan
ford's loss to UCLA and tie to Fres
no State, coupled with the Bruins'
win over California yesterday,
leaves the Cardinal trailing in the
conference standings.
Although the weekend results
don't seem to indicate success,
coach Bret Simon was proud of his
team and believed that his players
played some of their best soccer of
the season.
"The guys did a great job
preparing, and I thought they
played well," Simon said. "We
played with a lot of heart for the
entire game, and that's all I can
ask out of them. I give a lot of
credit [to UCLA and Fresno
State]. They defended like mad
and played very well."
Simon attributed the Cardinal's
many overtime games this season to
its opponents' extra desire to play
well against Stanford.
"Our opponents are very deter
mined, and when we're ranked as

one of the best, teams will be keyed
for ns," Simon said. "When teams
are playing us close, it raises their
confidence level as the game pro
gresses. This allows them to keep
pushing hard."
Stanford's weekend started off
with UCLA continuing its three
year domination of the Cardinal.
"This was a big win for us, but we
still have more conference games
and more games to go in the sea
son," UCLA head coach Tom
Fitzgerald said. "But this keeps us
going in the right direction."
Stanford last beat UCLA on Oct.
8,2000, when the Cardinal won 1 -0
at home.
As characteristic of any match be
tween the two powerhouses, the
game was played fairly evenly until
the end of regulation.
Although Stanford put up 10
shots to the Bruins' six, the Cardi
nal was only able to put three of
them on goal. Stanford's best
chance came in the 50th minute,
when senior defender Todd
Dunivant placed a hard shot from
the left side that was kept out of
the goal by the Bruins' keeper
Zach Wells.
Wells played an excellent game,
keeping the potent Cardinal of
fense from getting any balls into the

back of the UCLA goal. One of the
key players that he managed to sti
fle was Levesque.
Levesque and Dunivant were
welcomed back to the Cardinal line
up after they took a few weeks off to
nurse injuries.
Ifanything positive were going
to be taken from the weekend, it
would be that Levesque and
Dunivant made a noticeable dif
ference on the field. Levesque
looked well-recovered, but Simon
had to sit Dunivant out of the
Fresno State match due to a reag
gravation of his injury.
The Cardinal gave itself a chance
to snap its losing streak against
UCLA by escaping regulation with
a tie.
However, Stanford's hopes to
get at least a point out of its West
wood trip fizzled quickly.
Ninety seconds into the first
overtime, the referee called a
hand-ball on the Cardinal, giving
UCLA a free kick right outside the
Stanford box.
Bruin midfielder Adolfo Gre
gorio then launched the ball over
the Stanford wall that Cardinal ju
nior keeper Robby Fulton was
able to knock away. But the re
bound came right to the feet of
UCLA forward Jimmy Frazelle,
who scored the game-winning
goal off t he Fulton deflection.
The loss didn't take away from
a strong defensive effort put forth
bv Stanford. Aside from the one

costly blunder in overtime, the
defensive unit played extremely
well, limiting UCLA to three shots
on goal.
Like on Friday, the Cardinal was
once again unlucky on the offen
sive side against Fresno State on
Sunday, as Stanford recorded
plenty of shots but was unable to
get on the scoreboard.
Junior forward Todd Leber
had the Cardinal's best chance of
the first half, rocketing a shot off
the goalpost, but the Bulldogs still
escaped with a 0-0 tie despite being
outshot 8-5 in the opening period.
Things turned around dra
matically in the second half as the
Bulldogs put on relentless pres
sure, registering five corner kicks
and outshooting Stanford 7-2.
However, regulation ended
without a score, and Stanford was
only able to register two shots in the
two ensuing overtime periods, lead
ing both teams to end the game
with a clean sheet.
Although Stanford's weekend
