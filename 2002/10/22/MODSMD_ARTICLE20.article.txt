Sunday: Stanford 0, Fresno St. 0

And yet, the streak continues.
With a heartbreaking 1-0 over
time loss to UCLA (8-1-1, 3-0-0
Pacific-10 Conference), the then-
No. 1 Cardinal men's soccer team
(11-2-1, 2-1-1) extended a four

played with a lot of heart for the
entire game, and that's all I can
ask out of them. I give a lot of
credit [to UCLA and Fresno

Simon attributed the Cardinal's
