# Crew starts strong in Boston
## 
### RACHAEL HANLEY 
The Stanford crew teams had a strong showing in
their first regattas of the season at the 38th annual
Head of the Charles Race on Sunday in Boston with
fifth- and 18th-place finishes by the women's and
men's varsity boats, respectively.
The Cardinal women's team was the third-place
collegiate team in its race. Stanford finished with a
time of 16 minutes, 53 seconds — nine seconds be
hind Princeton, which finished fourth overall. Also
among the top finishers were the London Training
Center in second place, and Yale in third. The U.S.
Rowing women's team took top honors with a time
of 16:12.9.
The Stanford men's varsity boat finished 18th out
of 40 competitors in the championship eight race with
a time of 15:34.8. I'he U.S. Rowing men's boat won
with a time of 14:53.2.
Among college teams, the Stanford men were
ninth behind Yale. Navy had an unofficial time of
15:34.2, placing the Midshipmen ahead of Stan
ford, but a 20-second penalty dropped them behind
the Cardinal.
Stanford men's coach Craig Amerkhanian said
that the race was a growing experience for the men.
"I think that they really embraced the celebration
of rowing, and that's the basis of this trip," he said.
The Stanford men's boat was even with Yale and
Navy throughout most of the race, but in the last push
to the finish, Stanford tell slightly off the pace, taking
2:44 to complete the last 500 meters, compared to

Navy's time of 2:34 and Yale's 2:36.
A pass by the Cambridge Boat Club in the final
push to the finish line may have also affected the Stan
ford time. But senior Chris Jones, stroke seat of the
men's eight, said a larger factor was the West Coast
season, which starts several weeks behind the East
Coast schools'.
"Getting passed by Cambridge didn't affect us too
much," Jones said. "Having a boat right next to us
probably helped us to keep our focus during the last
half mile of the race. 1 think that our relatively slow
finish was more a product of our shortened condi
tioning season than anything."
"I'm pleased as a coach," Amerkhanian said. "I'm
pleased that they can be in the top 10 as a walk-on
crew team."
The conditions for the race were fair, although the
men rowed against a headwind.
Despite the Cardinal's minor setbacks, Jones was
exuberant about his experience in Boston, where
roughly 300,000 people turn out to watch the races
each year.
" The entire community of Boston gets involved in
the event,"he said. "Literally dozens of people came
up to us on the subway or in restaurants to talk about
the race and wish us luck."
The Stanford men's and women's boats gained an
automatic invitation to next year's Head of the
Charles Races by finishing within five percent of the
winning time. Stanford's women were within 4.1 per
cent off the winning pace, while the men were within
4.7 percent.
