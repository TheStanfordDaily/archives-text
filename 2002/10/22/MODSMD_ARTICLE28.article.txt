# Card v-ball visits Pacific

### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
There were plenty of emotional
matches during the Stanford
women's volleyball team's season
last year — it's basically a given that
there would be fora team that wins
the national championship.

at Pacific, Tonight, 7:00 p.m.

But amidst the slew of dramatic
come-from-behind wins that dotted
the Cardinal's season and the emo
tional high points of its nearly-per
fect NCAA run, one match from last
year still stuck out as the most men
tally grueling — at least for head
coach John Dunning. Stanford's 3-2
win over Pacific on Oct. 23 last year
took a visible toll on Dunning, who
had left Stockton for Palo Alto just
before the season started after 16
years at the helm of the Tigers.
The only people who looked
more shaken up than Dunning
after last season's contest were the
Pacific players, some of whom
broke down after blowing a 2-1 lead
to their former coach on his new
home court.
But as the sixth-ranked Stanford
squad heads to Stockton to take on
the Tigers in a non-conference
match at 7:00 p.m. tonight, there's a
sense on both sides that the year that
has passed since the two teams last
met has been a long one.
Dunning set his place in the Car
dinal volleyball family by guiding
Stanford to its NCAA-record fifth
national title last year, and Pacific's
roster for tonight's contest bears lit
tle resemblance to the last Tiger
squad Dunning oversaw.
Put simply, the loyalties and con
nections have faded.
"Ten of 14 of our players have
no association with John," said Pa
cific coach Jayne McHugh, who
played for Dunning at Pacific be
fore serving as an assistant to him
for 12 years. "We all lovejohn, and
he will always remain a friend while
he's coaching and after with what
ever he does. He's a guy you're al
ways going to have good things to
say about."
Dunning's thoughts on returning

to Pacific nearly mirror those of his
former colleague. Gone are any
traces of the uneasiness he openly ex
pressed heading into last year's face
offwith die Tigers at Maples Pavilion.
"My daughter lives [by Pacific]
and works there, but I haven't been
there to visit people since I came [to
Stanford]," Dunning said. "You
get immersed in what you're
doing. Now 1 know the kids here
better than I know the kids there.
When you move, you grow de
tached to some degree, so it's dif
ferent this year. This will be easier
to do [emotionally]."
Pacific's second year after the
Dunning era has been tougher than
its first, with several early-season
losses knocking the Tigers out of the
rankings despite starting the year at
No. 12. A 3-2 loss at home to Idaho
on Saturday dropped them to third
in the Big West Conference, three
games behind No. 7 Long Beach
State.
The Tigers' biggest strength and
weakness lie in junior All-American
middle blocker Jennifer Joines.
Joines is the most dominant player
in the Big West, ranking second in
the conference in kills (5.03 per
game) and hitting percentage (.381)
and third in blocks (1.57 per game).
But Pacific is almost entirely reliant
on Joines to spark the offense and its
net game, and she has not proven
unstoppable during t he season.
"We really need to focus on
blocking [Joines] and digging
around her so that we can really try
to stop any momentum she can

build for them," said Stanford ju
nior setter Anna Robinson.
"They're a really competitive, ath
letic team. We just need to block well
and pass well and stay in control,
and that's how we're going to win."
Pacific's dependence on Joines
could be its undoing against the Car
dinal, which has routinely been able
to shut down its opponents' best
player. Arizona State's Juliana Esco
bar, California's Mia Jerkov and
Florida's Amy Cruz are just a short
list of the likely Ail-Americans that
Stanford has contained this season.
With the Pac-10's top two blockers
in junior middles Jenn Harvey and
Sara McGee and a steadily improving
back row, the Cardinal has even
thing it needs to take out die Tigers'
goto hitter.
"We spent the last week com
pletely doing defense. We came
out [last weekend] with a certain
mentality knowing that we had to
pop every ball up," said freshman
libero Courtney Schultz. "It felt
good to see it in the match, and
we're still going to be working on
it. Our block is really good right
now. We don't dig a lot of balls be
cause we block so many."
The Tigers are going to have to
find some way to slow the Stanford
offense, which leads the Pac-10 with
a .319 hitting percentage. AU-Amer
ican outside hitters sophomore
Ogonna Nnamani and senior
Logan Tom are combining for 8.65
kills per game from the left side, and
McGee is hitting a Pac-10 best .464
with over three kills per game.

Pacific's dependence on Joines
could be its undoing against the Car
dinal, which has routinely been able
to shut down its opponents' best
player. Arizona State's Juliana Esco
bar, California's Mia Jerkov and
Florida's Amy Cruz are just a short
list of the likely Ail-Americans that
Stanford has contained this season.
With the Pac-10's top two blockers
in junior middles Jenn Harvey and
Sara McGee and a steadily improving
back row, the Cardinal has even
thing it needs to take out die Tigers'
goto hitter.
"We spent the last week com
pletely doing defense. We came
out [last weekend] with a certain
mentality knowing that we had to
pop every ball up," said freshman
libero Courtney Schultz. "It felt
good to see it in the match, and
we're still going to be working on
it. Our block is really good right
now. We don't dig a lot of balls be
cause we block so many."
The Tigers are going to have to
find some way to slow the Stanford
offense, which leads the Pac-10 with
a .319 hitting percentage. AU-Amer
ican outside hitters sophomore
Ogonna Nnamani and senior
Logan Tom are combining for 8.65
kills per game from the left side, and
McGee is hitting a Pac-10 best .464
with over three kills per game.

Women's volleyball head coach John Dunning gives some advice to his play
ers yesterday in practice. Dunning will face his former team Pacific tonight in
Stockton, Calif.
There were plenty of emotional
matches during the Stanford
women's volleyball team's season
last year — it's basically a given that
there would be fora team that wins
the national championship.

at Pacific, Tonight, 7:00 p.m.

But amidst the slew of dramatic
come-from-behind wins that dotted
the Cardinal's season and the emo
tional high points of its nearly-per
fect NCAA run, one match from last
year still stuck out as the most men
tally grueling — at least for head
coach John Dunning. Stanford's 3-2
win over Pacific on Oct. 23 last year
took a visible toll on Dunning, who
had left Stockton for Palo Alto just
before the season started after 16
years at the helm of the Tigers.
The only people who looked
more shaken up than Dunning
after last season's contest were the
Pacific players, some of whom
broke down after blowing a 2-1 lead
to their former coach on his new
home court.
But as the sixth-ranked Stanford
squad heads to Stockton to take on
the Tigers in a non-conference
match at 7:00 p.m. tonight, there's a
sense on both sides that the year that
has passed since the two teams last
met has been a long one.
Dunning set his place in the Car
dinal volleyball family by guiding
Stanford to its NCAA-record fifth
national title last year, and Pacific's
roster for tonight's contest bears lit
tle resemblance to the last Tiger
squad Dunning oversaw.
Put simply, the loyalties and con
nections have faded.
"Ten of 14 of our players have
no association with John," said Pa
cific coach Jayne McHugh, who
played for Dunning at Pacific be
fore serving as an assistant to him
for 12 years. "We all lovejohn, and
he will always remain a friend while
he's coaching and after with what
ever he does. He's a guy you're al
ways going to have good things to
say about."
Dunning's thoughts on returning

to Pacific nearly mirror those of his
former colleague. Gone are any
traces of the uneasiness he openly ex
pressed heading into last year's face
offwith die Tigers at Maples Pavilion.
"My daughter lives [by Pacific]
and works there, but I haven't been
there to visit people since I came [to
Stanford]," Dunning said. "You
get immersed in what you're
doing. Now 1 know the kids here
better than I know the kids there.
When you move, you grow de
tached to some degree, so it's dif
ferent this year. This will be easier
to do [emotionally]."
Pacific's second year after the
Dunning era has been tougher than
its first, with several early-season
losses knocking the Tigers out of the
rankings despite starting the year at
No. 12. A 3-2 loss at home to Idaho
on Saturday dropped them to third
in the Big West Conference, three
games behind No. 7 Long Beach
State.
The Tigers' biggest strength and
weakness lie in junior All-American
middle blocker Jennifer Joines.
Joines is the most dominant player
in the Big West, ranking second in
the conference in kills (5.03 per
game) and hitting percentage (.381)
and third in blocks (1.57 per game).
But Pacific is almost entirely reliant
on Joines to spark the offense and its
net game, and she has not proven
unstoppable during t he season.
"We really need to focus on
blocking [Joines] and digging
around her so that we can really try
to stop any momentum she can

build for them," said Stanford ju
nior setter Anna Robinson.
"They're a really competitive, ath
letic team. We just need to block well
and pass well and stay in control,
and that's how we're going to win."
Pacific's dependence on Joines
could be its undoing against the Car
dinal, which has routinely been able
to shut down its opponents' best
player. Arizona State's Juliana Esco
