# ASSU surveys RAs on diversity
## Results show that students on financial aid are underrepresented 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Concerned that students from
certain ethnicities and socioeco
nomic classes are underrepresent
ed among resident advisors, the
ASSU lias begun to survey current
RAs to find out what factors play
into a student's decision to apply to
the position and if the pay structure
discourages some students from
applying.
Specifically, the ASSU has tenta
tively found that the portion of RAs
who are on financial aid is much
smaller than the portion of Stanford
undergraduates who receive finan
cial assistance. Members believe that
this may be correlated to the lact that

there are relatively few black, Ixitino
or queer RAs — a reality that the
ASSU tears could hinder efforts to
bring diversity into residences and
may alienate some students.
" There's always been Uilk about
how there aren't very many stall
members of color or queer RAs,"
said senior Monica Henestroza,
ASSU president. "It's a general di
versity issue— it's not about 'Is
everyone on staff white?' If you look
at the overall racial breakdown of
the Stanford population, is that
mirrored in the RA population?
From what we've seen, the answer
is no ... there definitely seems to be
a trend."
As of last week, the ASSU had
collected approximately 40 surveys,
which it says does not yet represent
a majority of RAs, but does provide
it with a decent sampling size.
"What it looks like right now is
that the majority of RAs aren't on fi
nancial aid," Henestroza said.

"Many of the staff people who are
on financial aid had to reconsider,
reconsider and reconsider again
whether they could do it." ■
According to ASSU representa
tives, many students on financial
aid decided not to apply for RA po
sitions because the stipend they re
ceive is factored directly into their
financial-aid package.
Of the RAs already surveyed,
less than one-third received finan
cial aid. winter, Dean of Ad
mission and Financial Aid Robin
Mamlet reported that about 70 per
cent of Stanford students received
some form of financial assistance
and that just over 40 percent re
ceived need-based financial aid

"When an RA gets paid, they
take money from a person's finan
cial aid," said junior Jordan Perala
