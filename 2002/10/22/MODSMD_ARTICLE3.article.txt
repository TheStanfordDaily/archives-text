# ASSU surveys RAs on diversity
## Results show that students on financial aid are underrepresented 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Concerned that students from
certain ethnicities and socioeco
nomic classes are underrepresent
ed among resident advisors, the
ASSU lias begun to survey current
RAs to find out what factors play
into a student's decision to apply to
the position and if the pay structure
discourages some students from
applying.
Specifically, the ASSU has tenta
tively found that the portion of RAs
who are on financial aid is much
smaller than the portion of Stanford
undergraduates who receive finan
cial assistance. Members believe that
this may be correlated to the lact that

there are relatively few black, Ixitino
or queer RAs — a reality that the
ASSU tears could hinder efforts to
bring diversity into residences and
may alienate some students.
" There's always been Uilk about
how there aren't very many stall
members of color or queer RAs,"
said senior Monica Henestroza,
ASSU president. "It's a general di
versity issue— it's not about 'Is
everyone on staff white?' If you look
at the overall racial breakdown of
the Stanford population, is that
mirrored in the RA population?
From what we've seen, the answer
is no ... there definitely seems to be
a trend."
As of last week, the ASSU had
collected approximately 40 surveys,
which it says does not yet represent
a majority of RAs, but does provide
it with a decent sampling size.
"What it looks like right now is
that the majority of RAs aren't on fi
nancial aid," Henestroza said.

"Many of the staff people who are
on financial aid had to reconsider,
reconsider and reconsider again
whether they could do it." ■
According to ASSU representa
tives, many students on financial
aid decided not to apply for RA po
sitions because the stipend they re
ceive is factored directly into their
financial-aid package.
Of the RAs already surveyed,
less than one-third received finan
cial aid. winter, Dean of Ad
mission and Financial Aid Robin
Mamlet reported that about 70 per
cent of Stanford students received
some form of financial assistance
and that just over 40 percent re
ceived need-based financial aid

"When an RA gets paid, they
take money from a person's finan
cial aid," said junior Jordan Perala

tive Cabinet who focuses on stu
dent retention and recruitment.
"So the RA doesn't get anything
monetarily speaking, just the ex
change itself."
Peralata said that some students
may have to sacrifice other sources
of income, such as off-campus jobs,
because of the time commitment
required by the RA position, and
thus, the way the RA stipend is
worked into their aid package dis
courages them from pursuing the
position.
Director of Student Awards Ron
Diaz said that, because of federal
law, it is impossible for the Univer
sity to not include a student's RA
stipend — which amounts to 80
percent of the cost of an RA's room
and board — when calculating
their aid package.
"Federal law requires us to treat
the RA stipend as a part of the re
sources available to a student," Diaz
said. "What we are able to do, how
ever, is to count the RA stipend
against a student's self-help, so at
least RAs benefit by having their job
and loan expectation eliminated,"
he said.
He added, "While I under
stand that there is a desire to
have us go even further and not
count the stipend when comput
ing the package at all, this would
place us out of compliance with
federal regulations."
Director of Residential Educa
tion Jane Camarillo said she did not
believe that most students who
wanted to be RAs had financial aid
considerations that kept them from
applying, explaining that, in theo
ry, any job a student takes would re
sult in the student's financial aid
being reconsidered.
"They may find that their re
ported personal contribution in
creases (equal to the amount that
they receive as an RA/CA)," Ca
marillo said. "But this would hap
pen for any job that they took on
campus. It would also happen for
any job that they would take off
campus as long as they reported
that income."
Camarillo did acknowledge
that the time commitment that
being an RA requires can prevent
students from pursuing additional

employment.
ASSU representatives fear that
the nnder-representation of some
communities in staff positions
could work against University goals
of bringing diversity into the resi
dences.
"It seems as though there are a
lot of Caucasians within staff, and
there are select places on campus
where people 011 campus aren't
interested in applying at all," Per
alata said. "In some staffs at
dorms there aren't people of
color at all. One freshman told
me their freshman experience
was really horrible because there
was no one on stall [for her] to re
late [to]."
Camarillo emphasized that, re
gardless of race, sexual orientation
or socioeconomic status, any RA
must be prepared to be a "multicul
tural educator and embrace diver
sity in their work as well as support
it through their programming and
behavior."
However, she also said that get
ting students of color specifically to
take RA positions has proved diffi
cult.
"We usually see our greatest
interest amongst students of color
in ihe ethnic theme houses," Ca
marillo said. "As one might guess,
these students are also applying
for other competitive jobs on
campus. Over the last two years,
we are finding that there are a
number of excellent opportuni
ties for students of color that are
also attractive to a student who
has competing time commit
ments, for which the RA position
would be a conflict."
Henestroza said that the ASSU is
now trying to survey all RAs to get
more conclusive results and is also
working with Res Ed to find ways to
lessen the financial burden felt by
students.
Peralata said current efforts are
also focusing of discovery why in
terested students decided not to
apply for RA positions, and that
efforts will be made in the future
to expand the pool of applicants.
"We're focusing on more in
creasing the applicant pool and
finding a way to not let the money
issue deter people from applying,"
he said. "Right now we're just
starting with getting more appli
cants in and drawing more from
the ethnic communities and the
LGBT-CRC."

the nnder-representation of some
communities in staff positions
could work against University goals
of bringing diversity into the resi
dences.
"It seems as though there are a
lot of Caucasians within staff, and
there are select places on campus
where people 011 campus aren't
interested in applying at all," Per
alata said. "In some staffs at
dorms there aren't people of
color at all. One freshman told
me their freshman experience
was really horrible because there
was no one on stall [for her] to re
late [to]."
Camarillo emphasized that, re
gardless of race, sexual orientation
or socioeconomic status, any RA
must be prepared to be a "multicul
tural educator and embrace diver
sity in their work as well as support
it through their programming and
behavior."
However, she also said that get
ting students of color specifically to
take RA positions has proved diffi
cult.
"We usually see our greatest
interest amongst students of color
in ihe ethnic theme houses," Ca
marillo said. "As one might guess,
these students are also applying
for other competitive jobs on
campus. Over the last two years,
we are finding that there are a
number of excellent opportuni
ties for students of color that are
also attractive to a student who
has competing time commit
ments, for which the RA position
would be a conflict."
Henestroza said that the ASSU is
now trying to survey all RAs to get
more conclusive results and is also
working with Res Ed to find ways to
lessen the financial burden felt by
students.
Peralata said current efforts are
also focusing of discovery why in
terested students decided not to
apply for RA positions, and that
efforts will be made in the future
to expand the pool of applicants.
"We're focusing on more in
creasing the applicant pool and
finding a way to not let the money
issue deter people from applying,"
he said. "Right now we're just
starting with getting more appli
cants in and drawing more from
the ethnic communities and the
LGBT-CRC."
Concerned that students from
certain ethnicities and socioeco
nomic classes are underrepresent
ed among resident advisors, the
ASSU lias begun to survey current
RAs to find out what factors play
into a student's decision to apply to
the position and if the pay structure
discourages some students from
applying.
Specifically, the ASSU has tenta
tively found that the portion of RAs
who are on financial aid is much
smaller than the portion of Stanford
undergraduates who receive finan
cial assistance. Members believe that
this may be correlated to the lact that

there are relatively few black, Ixitino
or queer RAs — a reality that the
ASSU tears could hinder efforts to
bring diversity into residences and
may alienate some students.
" There's always been Uilk about
how there aren't very many stall
members of color or queer RAs,"
said senior Monica Henestroza,
ASSU president. "It's a general di
versity issue— it's not about 'Is
everyone on staff white?' If you look
at the overall racial breakdown of
the Stanford population, is that
mirrored in the RA population?
From what we've seen, the answer
is no ... there definitely seems to be
a trend."
As of last week, the ASSU had
collected approximately 40 surveys,
which it says does not yet represent
a majority of RAs, but does provide
it with a decent sampling size.
"What it looks like right now is
that the majority of RAs aren't on fi
nancial aid," Henestroza said.

"Many of the staff people who are
on financial aid had to reconsider,
reconsider and reconsider again
whether they could do it." ■
According to ASSU representa
tives, many students on financial
aid decided not to apply for RA po
sitions because the stipend they re
ceive is factored directly into their
financial-aid package.
Of the RAs already surveyed,
less than one-third received finan
cial aid. winter, Dean of Ad
mission and Financial Aid Robin
Mamlet reported that about 70 per
cent of Stanford students received
some form of financial assistance
and that just over 40 percent re

dent retention and recruitment.
"So the RA doesn't get anything
monetarily speaking, just the ex
change itself."
Peralata said that some students
may have to sacrifice other sources
of income, such as off-campus jobs,
because of the time commitment
required by the RA position, and
thus, the way the RA stipend is
worked into their aid package dis
courages them from pursuing the
position.
Director of Student Awards Ron
Diaz said that, because of federal
law, it is impossible for the Univer
sity to not include a student's RA
stipend — which amounts to 80
percent of the cost of an RA's room
and board — when calculating
their aid package.
"Federal law requires us to treat
the RA stipend as a part of the re
sources available to a student," Diaz
said. "What we are able to do, how
ever, is to count the RA stipend
against a student's self-help, so at
least RAs benefit by having their job
and loan expectation eliminated,"
he said.
He added, "While I under
stand that there is a desire to
have us go even further and not
count the stipend when comput
ing the package at all, this would
place us out of compliance with
federal regulations."
Director of Residential Educa
tion Jane Camarillo said she did not
believe that most students who
wanted to be RAs had financial aid
considerations that kept them from
applying, explaining that, in theo
ry, any job a student takes would re
sult in the student's financial aid
being reconsidered.
"They may find that their re
ported personal contribution in
creases (equal to the amount that
they receive as an RA/CA)," Ca
marillo said. "But this would hap
pen for any job that they took on
campus. It would also happen for
any job that they would take off
campus as long as they reported
that income."
Camarillo did acknowledge
that the time commitment that
being an RA requires can prevent
students from pursuing additional

employment.
