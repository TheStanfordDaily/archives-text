# In need of aid, int'l student stays home
## First Stanford student from Mongolia unable to enroll 
### MADHAVI DEVASHER 
Oyungerel Tsedevdamba,
political and human rights ac
tivist, is the first student from
Mongolia ever to be admitted
to Stanford. But don't expect to
see her roaming around White
Plaza or grabbing a Jamba Juice
at Tresidder any time soon —
inability to pay her tuition has
prevented her from enrolling
this year.
Coming from an impover
ished developing country,
Tsedevdamba earns an average
salary of $250 a month and had
only $6,000 to pay for the
$45,000 program in Interna
tional Policy Studies. Financial
aid in her case was nonexistent.
When asked whv she didn't

receive financial aid, Tsedev
damba replied bye-mail, "First
of all, the program I was ad
mitted [to] in International
Policy Studies didn't have fi
nancial aid to support its stu
dents. Second, I was not eligi
ble to apply for student loans
because 1 was not an American
or had nobody whom I can ask
as a sponsor.
"Many scholarships avail
able at Stanford seemed to be
offered mostly for Americans
or those who were already en
rolled into University," she
continued.
Assoc. Dean of Admission
and Financial Aid Christina
Wire elaborated, "As with all
graduate students at Stanford,
whether U.S. or foreign citi
zens, financial aid is not based
on need.
Instead, grant support is
provided to the most promis
ing graduate students on a de
partmental basis.
"The International Policy
Studies Program to which Oyun
gerel has been accepted has ex
tremely limited grant funds to
support graduate student aid,"
Wire said.
For very poor international
students like Tsedevdamba, who
have no access to alternative
sources of funding, the task of
paying for higher education is
nearly insurmountable.
At Stanford, international un
dergraduates have more options
in securing financial aid than
graduates.
The Financial Aid Office pro
vides long-term loans to interna
tional students from certain coun
tries on aid.
Financial aid for undergradu
ates is also need-based. However,
international undergraduates
face many more restrictions on
applying for aid than their Amer
ican counterparts.
Admissions for international
undergraduates are not need

blind — sources of aid are highly
limited, and therefore competition
amongst international applicants
seeking aid is very high. Each year,
Stanford can offer admission and
financial aid to 30 international
students; in 2002-2003, there were
104 international students receiv
ing approximately $3 million in
aid. International students seeking
aid are not allowed to apply for
early decision.
In defense of Stanford's policy,
Wire states, "We will not admit a
student unless we are certain ei
ther that the student is self-fund
ed or that we are able to provide
financial aid.
The Financial Aid Office evalu
ates all applications for financial
aid from international students
after Regular Review admission
decisions are completed in late
March.
"Thus, those international stu
dents applying for aid may not
apply to Stanford under the Early
Decision option. However, the
Offices of Admission and Finan
cial Aid are currently reevaluating
this policy."
Changes in the current policy
are in the works. According to
Wire, "the University is in the

process of raising funds to in
crease the endowment resources
available to support need-blind
undergraduate admission for in
ternational students."
Organizations such as the In
ternational Undergraduate Com
munity, lUC, are also trying to
campaign for need-blind admis
sions. Sophomore Jonathan
Choi, international student advo
cate for the lUC, described the or
ganization's latest campaign, the
"Share Your Stories Project,"
which aims to produce a brochure
that the Development Office can
show to potential donors.
"The point is to help those who
cannot come here because of
funding . . . not to have more in
ternational students," Choi said.
Tsedevdamba's story is not
over yet. She managed to secure
deferred enrollment from Stan
ford and is currently trying to
raise $45,000.
With publicity from her story,
donations have poured in. Sever
al cultural charity events have
been held in the Bay Area and
many people have sent checks to
the Financial Aid Office to donate
money toward Tsedevdamba's
tuition. As of Oct. 17, she has

raised $20,200.
"Maybe someone will think I'm
just kidding," writes Tsedevdam
ba. "But it is true that I had money
to apply to only one school, and I
applied to Stanford."
Her reasons for applying here
are simple: "Stanford's [Interna
tional Policy Studies] program
was unique and very interesting .
. . I believe studying at Stanford
will enable me to offer my help in
designing the policies of the
Mongolian Government and
Parliament, especially of the De
mocratic Party of Mongolia," she
continued.
Meanwhile, Tsedevdamba
labors on. Besides working for
the Mongolian Parliament, she
is also the executive director of
the Liberty Center, a human
rights non-governmental orga
nization whose "mission is to
protect rights and liberties stat
ed in Mongolian Constitution
and to strengthen democratic
values in Mongolia."
She holds out hope that the
coming months will see her over
come the obstacle of money to
gain an invaluable education that
could serve not just her, but her
entire nation.
