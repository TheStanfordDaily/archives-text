# ITSS expands residential internet bandwidth
## University more than doubles bandwidth for residences after controversial restrictions

After capping residential internet access last
year to deal with slowed network speeds on
campus, Information Technology Systems and
Services has taken new steps to improve the
networking situation by changing service
providers and allotting new bandwidth to resi
dences. Multiple connections have been added
and residential connections have been separat
ed from campus networks — all in an attempt
to speed up Stanford student web-surfing
Bandwidth refers to the measure of the size
of the "pipe" through which network informa
tion travels. Thus, increasing bandwidth
translates to increased internet speeds because
more information can be sent at once.
Early this calendar year, networking, a divi
sion of ITSS, purchased a new 100-megabits
per-second link to the commodity, or general
use, internet to serve only the residences. This
feed, purchased from Cogent Communica
tions, replaced the old 40 Mbps portion of the
campus-wide internet connection from the
provider Genuity that had previously served
the residences.
Stanford has three types of internet links:

Ethan Rikleen, network and systems admin

practical outcome is that the residences have

than last year."
Also, this summer, an addition
al link from Cogent was added to
the academic connections, used in
libraries, faculty offices and other
non-residence buildings. So, even
though the campus and resi
dences have separate links, they
each still have enough bandwidth
to support all the commodity in
ternet traffic should either net
work fail.
Previously, some students had
complained that Stanford had too
little bandwidth to feed the com
bined needs of the residential and
academic communities. In 2000,
ITSS first capped residence ac
cess to all of the University's band
width, but vowed to allocate 80
percent of its total bandwidth to
students. Last year, networking

purchased more bandwidth, but
allocated all of the new bandwidth
to the academic community, leav
ing residences with 40 Mbps while
academic usage was allotted 60
Mbps.
Over the past year, network
ing also implemented a prioritiz
ing technology to more efficient
ly use the bandwidth available.
The prioritizing limited the
amount of bandwidth that was
available for outgoing Peer-to-
Peer traffic — the type of traffic
used when people off campus
download music over programs
like KaZaA and WinMX from
Stanford students.
"This technology allowed the
campus to get control of how the
bandwidth was being used," said
Phil Reese, director of network
ing for ITSS. "[With its imple
mentation], important e-mail and
Web traffic could then flow."
Despite all of the changes,
some students haven't been con

vinced that the situation is any
better.
"Freshman year the traffic was
really slow, and it improved from
then to sophomore year, but I
don't think that it's any faster this
year" said junior Albert Chen, a
resident computer coordinator in
Otero.
Others have been unim
pressed by the high-speed cam
pus connections.
"My cable connection at home
was actually faster than the speeds
1 get here," said freshman Derek
Alley.
Not all the responses have
been negative, however.
"The anecdotal feedback I've
heard is that it's noticeably better
in the residences," Rikleen said.
"There's no more difference be
tween the residences and the
campus, which is how it should
be. Still, my personal opinion is
that they should buy more [band
width] anyway."
