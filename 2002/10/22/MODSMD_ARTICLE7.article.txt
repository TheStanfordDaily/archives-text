# CUE ahead of schedule with $795 million

### JULIE TUNG 
Two years from its inception
and with $795 million under its
belt, the Campaign for Under
graduate Education is well on its
way to reaching its goal of $ 1 bil
lion over the next three years.
"We're a little bit ahead because
of the Hewlett Foundation's very
generous contribution [of $400
million]," said Director of Devel
opment Marketing Bob Pringle.
"But that puts us into good shape
now, especially given the current
economic environment; the next
three years will probably be the
more difficult years."
Launched by University Presi
dent John Hennessy at his inaugu
ration in 2000, CU E seeks to estab
lish funding earmarked specifical
ly for undergraduates. No other
fundraising campaign of this mag
nitude geared exclusively toward
undergraduate education has ever
been attempted.
Four components comprise
CUE — the Stanford Endowment

for Undergraduate Education, en
dowed scholarships (athletic and
need-based), annual giving to The
Stanford Fund and undergradu
ate programs across the Universi
ty. All of the components hope to
raise $300 million, except for The
Stanford Fund, which has a goal of
$100 million.
As of Sept. 30, the Stanford En
dowment for Undergraduate Ed
ucation has raised $239 million,
endowed scholarships has raised
$215 million, The Stanford Fund
has raised $42 million and under
graduate programs has raised
$227 million.
Several new programs, such as
Stanford Introductory Seminars,
Freshman / Sophomore College
and Sophomore College have
begun within the last decade to en
rich the undergraduate experi
ence. Last year, 2,239 students en
rolled in at least one introductory
seminar, and more than 200 semi
nars are being offered this year.

"We have a faculty that eagerly
embraced [the new programs] and
an environment at Stanford that is
uniquely open to change; it was
that spirit of openness that allowed
it to be so successful," Pringle said.
"It just took off. I think the pro
grams actually grew a lot faster
than the faculty had expected,
which is a good problem to have."
However, because these pro
grams were launched primarily
using expendable start-up funds
comprised of University general
funds and seed money from
donors, they are currently fi
nanced only on a temporary basis.
This makes the Stanford Endow
ment for Undergraduate Educa
tion especially critical, because it is
necessary to secure these pro
grams and continue them on a
permanent basis.
Other programs that will be
funded by this endowment in

elude the Introduction to the Hu
manities sequence required of all
freshmen and Undergraduate Re
search Programs, which make un
dergraduate research opportuni
ties more accessible to students.
Many of these initiatives were
sparked by recommendations
made by the Commission on Un
dergraduate Education, a group
convened by former University
President Gerhard Casper to ex
amine the undergraduate experi
ence and suggest reforms.
Other CUE goals include funds
for endowed scholarships, both
athletic and need-based, and gen
eral funds for undergraduate pro
grams across the University, such
as Overseas Studies, Stanford in
Government and endowed profes
sorships across the University.
"The Stanford Endowment for
Undergraduate Education is real
ly the heart and soul of the cam
paign, and right after that is the fi
nancial aid component, because as
the Ivies continue to become more
and more competitive, we still
need to be putting together good

packages for the students," Pringle
said.
He added, "We don't want to
be too detailed in the uses for
these funds now, because we
want to make sure that the un
dergraduate experience contin
ues to be dynamic. For instance,
in the future, maybe we'll find
some new program that is even
more effective than what we have
now, and we want to be able to
support that."
An innovative fundraising ef
fort from the past year has been
Think Again, a road show consist
ing of faculty, students and volun
teers that visited 12 U.S. cities to
share the Stanford undergraduate
experience with alumni.
Although no plans fora project
as extensive as Think Again are
currently in place, smaller-scale
events will continue to be held. On
Nov. 1, one such event will take
place in Vancouver, with faculty
seminars and student panels.
"We want to let people know
that what's going on here is pretty
wonderful," Pringle said.

seminars and student panels.
"We want to let people know
that what's going on here is pretty
wonderful," Pringle said.
Two years from its inception
and with $795 million under its
belt, the Campaign for Under
graduate Education is well on its
way to reaching its goal of $ 1 bil
lion over the next three years.
"We're a little bit ahead because
of the Hewlett Foundation's very
generous contribution [of $400
million]," said Director of Devel
opment Marketing Bob Pringle.
"But that puts us into good shape
now, especially given the current
economic environment; the next
three years will probably be the
more difficult years."
Launched by University Presi
dent John Hennessy at his inaugu
ration in 2000, CU E seeks to estab
lish funding earmarked specifical
ly for undergraduates. No other
fundraising campaign of this mag
nitude geared exclusively toward
undergraduate education has ever
been attempted.
Four components comprise
CUE — the Stanford Endowment

for Undergraduate Education, en
dowed scholarships (athletic and
need-based), annual giving to The
Stanford Fund and undergradu
ate programs across the Universi
ty. All of the components hope to
raise $300 million, except for The
Stanford Fund, which has a goal of
$100 million.
As of Sept. 30, the Stanford En
dowment for Undergraduate Ed
ucation has raised $239 million,
endowed scholarships has raised
$215 million, The Stanford Fund
has raised $42 million and under
graduate programs has raised
$227 million.
Several new programs, such as
Stanford Introductory Seminars,
Freshman / Sophomore College
and Sophomore College have
begun within the last decade to en
rich the undergraduate experi
ence. Last year, 2,239 students en
rolled in at least one introductory
seminar, and more than 200 semi
nars are being offered this year.

"We have a faculty that eagerly
embraced [the new programs] and
an environment at Stanford that is
uniquely open to change; it was
that spirit of openness that allowed
it to be so successful," Pringle said.
"It just took off. I think the pro
grams actually grew a lot faster
than the faculty had expected,
which is a good problem to have."
However, because these pro
grams were launched primarily
using expendable start-up funds
comprised of University general
funds and seed money from
donors, they are currently fi
nanced only on a temporary basis.
This makes the Stanford Endow
ment for Undergraduate Educa
tion especially critical, because it is
necessary to secure these pro
grams and continue them on a
permanent basis.
Other programs that will be
funded by this endowment in

elude the Introduction to the Hu
manities sequence required of all
freshmen and Undergraduate Re
search Programs, which make un
dergraduate research opportuni
ties more accessible to students.
Many of these initiatives were
sparked by recommendations
made by the Commission on Un
dergraduate Education, a group
convened by former University
President Gerhard Casper to ex
amine the undergraduate experi
ence and suggest reforms.
Other CUE goals include funds
for endowed scholarships, both
athletic and need-based, and gen
eral funds for undergraduate pro
grams across the University, such
as Overseas Studies, Stanford in
Government and endowed profes
sorships across the University.
"The Stanford Endowment for
Undergraduate Education is real
ly the heart and soul of the cam
paign, and right after that is the fi
nancial aid component, because as
the Ivies continue to become more
and more competitive, we still
need to be putting together good

packages for the students," Pringle
said.
He added, "We don't want to
be too detailed in the uses for
these funds now, because we
want to make sure that the un
dergraduate experience contin
ues to be dynamic. For instance,
in the future, maybe we'll find
some new program that is even
more effective than what we have
now, and we want to be able to
support that."
An innovative fundraising ef
fort from the past year has been
Think Again, a road show consist
ing of faculty, students and volun
teers that visited 12 U.S. cities to
share the Stanford undergraduate
experience with alumni.
Although no plans fora project
as extensive as Think Again are
currently in place, smaller-scale
events will continue to be held. On
Nov. 1, one such event will take
place in Vancouver, with faculty
seminars and student panels.
"We want to let people know
that what's going on here is pretty
wonderful," Pringle said.
