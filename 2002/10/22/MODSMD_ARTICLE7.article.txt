Two years from its inception
and with $795 million under its
belt, the Campaign for Under
graduate Education is well on its
way to reaching its goal of $ 1 bil
lion over the next three years.
"We're a little bit ahead because
of the Hewlett Foundation's very
generous contribution [of $400
million]," said Director of Devel
opment Marketing Bob Pringle.
"But that puts us into good shape
now, especially given the current
economic environment; the next
three years will probably be the
more difficult years."
Launched by University Presi
dent John Hennessy at his inaugu
ration in 2000, CU E seeks to estab
lish funding earmarked specifical
ly for undergraduates. No other
fundraising campaign of this mag
nitude geared exclusively toward
undergraduate education has ever
been attempted.
Four components comprise
CUE â€” the Stanford Endowment

for Undergraduate Education, en
dowed scholarships (athletic and
need-based), annual giving to The
Stanford Fund and undergradu
ate programs across the Universi
ty. All of the components hope to
raise $300 million, except for The
Stanford Fund, which has a goal of
$100 million.
As of Sept. 30, the Stanford En
dowment for Undergraduate Ed
ucation has raised $239 million,
endowed scholarships has raised
$215 million, The Stanford Fund
has raised $42 million and under
graduate programs has raised
$227 million.
Several new programs, such as
Stanford Introductory Seminars,
Freshman / Sophomore College
and Sophomore College have
begun within the last decade to en
rich the undergraduate experi
ence. Last year, 2,239 students en
rolled in at least one introductory
seminar, and more than 200 semi
nars are being offered this year.
