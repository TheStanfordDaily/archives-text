## Car bombing in Israel kills at least 16 
### 
KARKUR JUNCTION, Israel
(AP) — A car packed with explo
sives pulled up to a bus in northern
Israel during rush hour yesterday,
igniting a massive fireball that
trapped passengers in the blazing
bus and killed at least 16 people,
including two suicide attackers.
About 45 people were wounded
in the blast at Karkur Junction,
several miles east of the town of
Hadera. The army said 15 of the
wounded were soldiers. The body
of at least one soldier was seen
lying next to the bus.
The explosion unleashed in
tense flames that sent huge plumes
of smoke into the sky and initially
prevented police and rescue work
ers from approaching the bus.
When the fire was extinguished an
hour later, the bus and the car were
reduced to blackened skeletons.
The militant Islamic Jihad move
ment claimed responsibility in a let
ter faxed to The Associated Press, in
Beirut, Lebanon. The group said
the attack was in "retaliation for the
series of massacres committed by
the criminal enemy against our peo
ple." It cited recent Israeli military
operations that have resulted in
Palestinian civilian deaths in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The bombing raised the
prospect of tough Israeli retalia
tion, and Public Security Minister
Uzi Landau called for disbanding
the Palestinian security forces.
"We must not take our feet off the
gas pedal, and keep acting with
the utmost thoroughness in all
the pockets of Palestinian terror,"
he said.

Ihe army's chief spokeswoman,
Brig. Gen. Ruth Yaron, did not say
what the likely response would be,
but linked the attacks to the recent
easing of curfews in some West
Bank towns.
"We'll have to be very careful
now, there are probably more tick
ing bombs on the way," she said.
"We have to re-evaluate the situa

tion and see if we have any infor
mation on where the next attack
might be coming from."
Military officials said on condi
tion of anonymity that the cur
fews in West Bank towns and clo
sures around them would be
tightened and humanitarian aide
would be restricted.
Israel has imposed curfews on

hundreds of thousands in the
West Bank's Palestinian cities for
t lie past four months, a move that
has brought a sharp decline in
bombing attacks, but not their
complete cessation.
Ron Ratner, a spokesman for
the Egged bus company, said secu
rity officers in cars are trailing
buses, watching for bombers.
