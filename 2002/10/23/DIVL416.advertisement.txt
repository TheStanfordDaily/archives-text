"Early detection
saved my life!"
I had a timebomb in my body and I had no idea," says Linda Sloan
Last November, at my doctors recommendation, I had a Vitascan . That EBT full body scan
revealed a large mass that turned out to be an aggressive form of uterine cancer.
Fortunately, I was able to get surgery and treatment before the
cancer had metastasized to other parts of my body. That cancer
would still be growing larger every day, had I not
taken the twenty minutes fora Vitascan '.
My husband Bud and I feel very, very lucky.
Thanks to early detection, I can look forward
to a long and healthy life. I am living
proof that you shouldn't put off
getting a Vitascan M .
You need to know. "
