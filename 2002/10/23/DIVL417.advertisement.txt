that will enable you tn succeed. In any field.
"Upon graduation (Ohio State University, *84), I went on lo hold
positions of leadership and responsibility at the platoon, company,
and battalion level. My title was Lieutenant, but in reality, 1 was a
junior executive in a well-run, well-managed corporation that
was larger than General Motors. Within two years I was in charge
of 200 men and millions of dollars of equipment. The parallels
between the Army and the private sector are countless, ranging
from personnel, safety, and budgeting, to effective oral and
written communications and implementing new technologies
and equipment. The one exception to this is that I know of no other
company that would entrust such a responsibility to a 23 year old."
