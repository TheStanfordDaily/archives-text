The Adventures of Sander Lamori and His Wonder Dog, Bentham
Episode I Dara Weinberg

jffo I THE 101-VENTURA FREEWAYâ€”
I
E The open road is mine, all mine.
Sander (that's me) champion of lies,
and (lie Unamerican Way, is
cruising at a nicely legal 55 in the almost-slowest lane of the Ventura
Eastbound. It's not really necessary to get on the freeway lo go to the Teacup
Trance. Infect, I'm only going to be on here fora couple exits. Bui I like the
freeway. I like speed. If the Sandermobile was capable of breaking 60, I
would be going much faster. But it really isn't safe to take this engine above
55. Don't get me wrong. She's a beautiful piece of souped-up steel, spray
painted black, with speakers in both doors and the trunk. She is, in fact, a low
rider 1969 Beetle. I love this car. There's a big "69" on the hood in glow-in
the-dark paint. Bentham thinks it's tacky. I think it gets chicks.
Why, you ask, would anyone make a Beetle a low-rider? I think she looks
a little like Bentham, my badass basset hound, this way. Furthermore, it
makes her oh-so-low profile even lower. And finally, no one would ever steal
it. Even for its most excellent stereo. But she does what 1 want. She parks in
small places, blasts my music, runs over squirrels, and with the back seat
removed, fits a small mattress for the ladies. (And my dog.)
Only girls name their cars, really. But my baby has a name. I just don't
share it with anyone so they won't think I'm a girl. She's the Sandermobile to
all and sundry, and Zeta to me. (You have to ask? It's after Catherine Zeta-
Jones, of course. The only woman as beautiful as Ravana, or ibis car.)
There's also a good reason for me and Zeta to stay off the streets between
Woodlake and Corbin tonight. Mandy has informed me that the Wiccan
coven associated with the donut shop at Fallbrook will be doing some sort of
mass aura-cleansing of all the cars passing through. I'm not afraid of girly
magic, but Mandy seems to think some of those girls aren't really Wiccans, or
they've stumbled on something else more powerful than their lame-ass God
and Goddess can take care of. So I'm playing it sate. Anyway, I don t want no
damn teenage girls cleansing my aura. I like my aura dirty. Like my car.
Exit on Corbin, making sure to cut oil that ugly gold Lexus, and head
north to Victory. For all you South of the Boulevard 5.0.8. s, permit me to
tip you off. The real action in the Valley (do I have to tell you which Valley?)
occurs when you go North. All the good clubs, the good cheap stores, the
good cheap food, the seediest people and the sexiest preteenagers are North.
I went to a club South once. It was a big mistake. There wasn't a single person
there with ugly bleached hair or pleather. I felt so out of place.
Why the hell is that gold Lexus still behind me? Whatever. It's probably
some Beverly Hills boy picking up his trashy Wednesday girl. I ought to
rescue her and show her how a real man, a North Valley man, makes a
woman feel.
What, you don't think Sander and Zeta can take a chick off a boy with a
gold Lexus? You haven't seen us in action yet. We could so do it, if Zeta had
enough energy tonight for the getawav. She's now refusing to go above forty,
which means it's time for me to stop at Madame Quetzal's right here on
Victory and pick up a few healing crystals for the hard drive.
Quetzal sells crystals, incense, various "potions," magic books, sex toys,
Uruguayan passports, cushions with stupid Tibet symbols on them, hand
woven thingies, and some damn intoxicating beverages. I've heard there are
drugs, too, if you're eighteen. I mostly come for the Tibetan porn and the
rocks. This woman stocks a high variety and quality of rocks. Hie problem is
like half of them have these damn do-no-harm charms on them first, and 1
have to spend forever taking them off before I can use them. I think she
knows what I'm up to. The last two times 1 was in here, she wouldn't sell me
anymore picture jasper. And I needed it.
Park Zeta here on the corner and open the door. Bells, jingly noises,
enough incense to kill a room of asthmatics, and some mantra tantra (Ont!
Oin! Yes! Otn!) music hit me all at once. This place trips me out. Literally. 1
always trip on her stupid rock fountain, or the tassels on the rug.
"Sander, you unravel my rug."
She's been weaving the thing for years. As long as I've been coining in
here. With the loom behind the counter and the strands trailing all over the
floor, her hippie dress, and her dreadlocks. She looks like a spider. Creeps
me out. I can tell you. But you can't let her see that.
"Yeah baby, well you unravel my heart," 1 shoot right back at her, as I
saunter my way over to the ceramic beverage dispenser. It's something hot
with too many cloves. I drink it and sit down on the cushions. Don't say a
word about what I'm here for.
Gotta keep them guessing. Always.
