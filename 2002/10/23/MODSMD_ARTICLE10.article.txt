# Russia and France not satisfied with U.S.-backed Iraq resolution

### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — In a trou
bling sign for U.S. efforts to push a tough
new Iraq resolution through the Security
Council, Russia and France said yesterday
they weren't satisfied with a revised draft
that warns Baghdad of "serious conse
quences" if it fails to cooperate with
weapons inspections.
The five permanent council members
— the United States, Britain, France, Rus
sia and China — discussed the new U.S.
text for the first time at a three-hour meet
ing yesterday, with Paris and Moscow con
cerned the draft could be used by Wash

ington to launch an attack on Iraq. The
five veto-wielding members met again for
over an hour yesterday afternoon.
"The American draft resolution . . .
does not answer the criteria which the
Russian side laid out earlier and which it
confirms today," Russian Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov said after meeting Hans Blix,
the chief U.N. weapons inspector, in
Moscow.
France also expressed disappointment
with the latest U.S; offer.
"There is still a lot of work to do," French
Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin

said yesterday in Luxembourg. "There are
some points that need to be discussed
among us before we have an accord."
A senior Chinese diplomat at the United
Nations, speaking on condition of anonymi
ty, said: "It's a pity there are no substantive
changes from the previous text."
Diplomats said the five permanent
members went line-by-line through the
seven-page U.S. text, with Russia most
vocal in its opposition.
France, backed by Russia and China,
wants to give Iraq another chance to meet
U.N. disarmament obligations. It favors a

two-stage approach that would give Iraq a
chance to comply and only authorize force
in a second resolution if Baghdad ob
structed inspections.
The new U.S. proposal, drafted with
British support, is a single resolution that
Washington says will allow the use of force
if Saddam Hussein fails to cooperate. It in
cludes phrases that could be interpreted as
triggering military action, wording that
has raised disagreement from the French
and Russians.
President Bush reiterated the warning he
gave world leaders at the U.N. General As

sembly on Sept. 12. "If the United Nations
can't make its mind up, if Saddam Hussein
won't disarm, we will lead a coalition to dis
arm him for the sake of peace," he said.
Iraq responded to the escalating threat
of a U.S. attack by inviting inspectors to re
turn after nearly four years.
Yesterday, Iraqi state television urged
the permanent members to prevent the
United States from pushing through an
"evil and aggressive" resolution that it said
"would be considered a violation of the
signed agreements between Iraq and the
United Nations."
