## The 						Stanford Daily Dining Services takes a step in the right direction 
### 
Published Since 1891

Last spring, the grand opening of the
new Wilbur Dining Hall was no less
glamorous than the debut of a casino.
Dancing dragons, ornate costumes,
festive music and gourmet cuisine from
around the world all symbolize the commit
ment of Housing and Dining Services to en
hancing the dining experience for students.
Amidst economic pressures and University
obligations, Dining Services' collaboration
with students and changes in staff have bene
fited the student body. We commend them for
prioritizing student service.
Historically, Dining Services has been
stereotypically associated with dimly lit din
ing halls, flavorless food and less-than-di
verse meal offerings. The Dining Service ad
ministration had been branded with percep
tions of being driven by profit and uncon
cerned with student needs. Recent partner
ships mark what might represent a new era
of collaboration-based improvements.
During any given weekday, students now
enjoy free New York Times and San Jose
Mercury newspapers within the dining com-

mons. These papers represent collaboration
between Dining Services and students, who
both sought to integrate a new educational
aspect into the dining experience.
Last week in an effort to support the
ASSU's "Get Out the Vote Campaign," Din
ing Services distributed voter registration
cards to students as they entered and left din
ing commons. Both instances are small ex
amples of a larger trend: a seemingly re
newed initiative by Dining Services to collab
orate more with student groups and improve
student outreach.
In addition to new partnerships, the ev
eryday attitude of the employees has made a
difference in the dining experience. Last
year a Lagunita chef, out of the mere good
ness of his heart, hosted a Super Bowl party
in the Lagunita Dining Hall. Many would
have been surprised to see dozens of Stan
ford students lounging in lawn furniture en
joying peanuts and other refreshments.
Since last year, Dining Services has under
gone transitions that have allowed fresh ener
gy to govern various aspects of the student din

ing experience. Shirley Everett, former execu
tive director of dining services and current as
sociate vice provost for housing and dining en
terprises, has prioritized student needs in both
positions and spearheaded this new trend of
collaboration.
Bill Wilson, Dining Services' marketing
guru, has successfully created more stu
dent-friendly messages within the dining
areas. Rafi Taherian has overseen many op
erational aspects of this transition, and
newly selected chef Nadeem Saddiqui has
already set a tone of student-partnership
within Dining Enterprises.
Further, in the last couple years Dining
Services has backed its commitment to pre
mier facilities and campus expansion. Wilbur
and Stern Dining Halls are products of
multi-million dollar renovations. In addi
tion, the recent opening of Olive's, a
mediterranean cuisine cafe, denotes invest
ment into retail food service.
During this same period, such capital in
vestments have been matched by service in
vestments for the benefit of students. For ex-

ample, Late Night was completely revised to
include more central locations and a more as
sorted menu offering everything from trendy
chai milk shakes to more traditional sandwich
es and after-hour snacks.
While such service improvements have oc
curred, admittedly, many student needs have
yet to be met â€” more flexibility with meal plan
options and universal acceptance of dining
points are two extremely valid issues at the top
of students' complaint lists.
For example, some students have com
plained that through high prices, Dining Ser
vices has abused the forced marriage between
student eating options and Dining Services.
However, if Dining Services utilizes the same
collaborative spirit to collect more input con
cerning these issues raised by the student body,
the improvements that can be achieved will be
infinite.
This year, Dining Services has embraced a
new slogan, "It's All About You." In order for
these words to ring more true, Dining Services
must continue to blaze a trail of commitment to
the student dining experience.
