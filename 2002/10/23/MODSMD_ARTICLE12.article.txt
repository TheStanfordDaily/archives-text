# MEMORY YIELDS
## The 						day after Full Moon 
### 
So, Full Moon on the Quad has
come and gone. Alcohol was par
taken. Seniors and freshmen
joined with sophomores and ju
niors pretending to be seniors and fresh
men to celebrate the beginning of a new
academic year per Stanford tradition.
However all is not well in Lelandland.
And so, before your respective viral load
hit critical levels and incapacitate you from
sampling your daily dose of journalistic
acumen, we should like to point out one
failure in this year's (and previous years')
Full Moon on the Quad: People get sick.
The Vaden Health Center's official
word on Full Moon on the Quad implored
students to make it a dry event so that sex
ual assaults from previous years would not
be replicated. While we applaud Vaden

for tackling this impor
tant and politically cor
rect issue, this response
fails to even touch on the
problem facing the cam
pus at large the morning
after Full Moon — sick
students.
So, what can we do
about this issue?
We would like to pro
pose that the proper pub-

lie health response to Full Moon on the
Quad be modeled after the national re
sponse to bioterrorism.
As in the case of biological weapons,
nonproliferation is at the very least dif
ficult to enforce. In the case of Stanford
and Full Moon on the Quad, it is im
possible. There will always be new class
es of freshmen.
And said freshmen will eventually ma
ture into seniors. Furthermore, if Dean
Mamlet's first two classes are any indica
tion, those students will undoubtedly be
hotter than the celibacy-inducing ones of
Dean Kinally (with the obvious exception
of your esteemed columnists). Thus, the
public health dilemma posed by students
hooking up is, if anything, increasing and
cannot be met by old nonproliferation
regimes from bygone administrations.
Once said students have proliferated,
one's next hope is to deter them from
hooking up. In the international system,
economic sanctions are the buzzword for
plans aimed at deterring certain activities
that do not really inconvenience one
enough to actually do anything effective to
prevent them. Here, witness the attempt
by the Stanford Alumni Network to deter
Full Moon by retracting its funding back
into its shiny new barracks—s79s million
so far in the Campaign for Undergraduate
Education, and it can't pony up $2,000 for
undergraduate networking, one of the
true perks of going to a school such as

Stanford.
Our response, much like that of poor,
beleaguered, well-armed nations around
the globe was to reallocate resources. The
senior, junior, sophomore and freshman
classes galvanized to foot the bill them
selves. Apparently, unlike the alumni, the
undergrads are willing to sacrifice In-N-
Out on Wilbur Field for the sake of our
alma mater's rich heritage.
Since nonproliferation and deter
rence cannot ensure Stanford student
security, active defense is the best re
maining option — it's that, or preemp
tive strikes. While, in an ideal world,
equal time to the issue of illness spring
ing from shoving your tongue down as
many throats as possible in a three-hour
span would move us toward solving the
problem, we believe that the average
Stanford student is already aware of the
risk of infection incurred by attendance
at this rite of passage, no matter how
much alcohol has been consumed.
No, we need to deploy our very own
Stanford version of national missile de
fense: rapid deployment of dental dams
for everyone. Also required is Listerine or
an equally strong substance to sterilize
each mouth after engaging in high-risk
proliferation activity.
And the coup de grace: increasing the
pre-event availability of the smallpox vac
cine, e.g. flu shots, and Z-pushpacks be
fore upperclassmen are attacked by the in
sidious germs sent via the well-known de
livery vehicle of the freshman long-dis
tance relationship.

Education, and it can't pony up $2,000 for
undergraduate networking, one of the
true perks of going to a school such as

Stanford.
Our response, much like that of poor,
beleaguered, well-armed nations around
the globe was to reallocate resources. The
senior, junior, sophomore and freshman
classes galvanized to foot the bill them
selves. Apparently, unlike the alumni, the
undergrads are willing to sacrifice In-N-
Out on Wilbur Field for the sake of our
alma mater's rich heritage.
Since nonproliferation and deter
rence cannot ensure Stanford student
security, active defense is the best re
maining option — it's that, or preemp
tive strikes. While, in an ideal world,
equal time to the issue of illness spring
ing from shoving your tongue down as
many throats as possible in a three-hour
span would move us toward solving the
problem, we believe that the average
Stanford student is already aware of the
risk of infection incurred by attendance
at this rite of passage, no matter how
much alcohol has been consumed.
No, we need to deploy our very own
Stanford version of national missile de
fense: rapid deployment of dental dams
for everyone. Also required is Listerine or
an equally strong substance to sterilize
each mouth after engaging in high-risk
proliferation activity.
And the coup de grace: increasing the
pre-event availability of the smallpox vac
cine, e.g. flu shots, and Z-pushpacks be
fore upperclassmen are attacked by the in
sidious germs sent via the well-known de
livery vehicle of the freshman long-dis
tance relationship.
