Baraka's poetry 'not welcome at Stanford'
In April 2001, during my second year at
Stanford, our campus community was
shaken by sexist and racist graffiti left
anonymously on a classroom wall. Individ
ual students, the University administration
and many student groups uniformly de
nounced the graffiti and spoke of the cow
ardice of its author. Our campus police and
The Daily both thought the content so vile,
they delayed and discouraged its public re
lease. Though The Daily later apologized
for withholding the text, the original logic
was clear: A campus newspaper should
think twice about providing a forum for the
voicing of racist and sexist filth.
Hence, my shock when I opened up
Monday's Daily to see Amiri Baraka's visit
— and anti-Semitic poetry reading — cov
ered in Ilene C. George's article as if it were
just another campus event, not a hate at
tack. The only suggestion that his new age
blood libel about 4,000 Israelis being told to
stay home on Sept. 11 was anti-Semitic
came in the form of an accusation attribut
ed to the ADL. Perhaps The Daily felt it was
not newsworthy to mention what the Wash
ington Times' Ward Connerly calls Bara
ka's "dozens of anti-Jewish [. . .] screeds
during the last 25 years" or any of the vast
array of editorials and protests by artist
groups — all railing against Baraka's anti-

Semitism — such as the recent editorial by
John I .eo in U.S. News. It further fails to
mention New Jersey Governor James Mc-
Greevey's demand that Baraka resign from
his position as that state's Poet Laureate
after Baraka's anti-Semitic poem gained
publicity.
Baraka tries to escape the charge of anti-
SemitisYn by claiming only that 4,000 Is
raelis were told not to come to work on
Sept. 11. But, with all his artistic accolades,
he should be smart enough to know how
close that sounds to the lie being perpetrat
ed in Pakistan, Egypt and elsewhere that
3,000 World Trade Center Jews stayed
home on Sept. 11.
Perhaps we should be glad that The
Daily no longer shies away from reporting
hate-filled messages in their original text.
But should we be glad that hate is now
given equal billing as other campus events?
Should the graffiti messages from last year
have been treated as notes left on the wall
from a guest history lecture? Should we
expect The Daily, or our campus commu
nity, to maintain different standards for
hate against various groups? Is hate pack
aged as poetry so much more acceptable
than hate packaged as vandalism?
One final point: While the graffiti author
chose to remain anonymous, we know who
authored the poem in question and who
brought him to campus. While the former

has adamantly refused to apologize for his
Sept. 11 poem, we can at least expect the
latter to make an apology to our campus
community. Perhaps then the healing can
begin, and we can come together to tell
would-be guest hatemongerers that nei
ther their graffiti nor their poetry is wel
come at Stanford.

Baraka's invitation 'is a sign of the grow
ing acceptance of anti-Semitism'
Last Friday, Amiri Baraka read his con
troversial poem "Somebody Blew Up
America"in Kresge Auditorium. He asked
"who told 4,000 Israeli workers at the Twin
lowers/ To stay home that day/ Why did
Sharon stay away?"
Baraka denied that this statement is anti-
Semitic, saying it was simply a criticism of
the Israeli government for allowing the dis
aster of Sept. 11. Baraka is essentially claim
ing that Ariel Sharon's government was
complicit in the attack.
Unless he knows something about Israel
that he hasn't told us, his claim is based on
only one piece of evidence, the "4,000 Is-
raeli workers" that were missing
from the World Trade Center. This
vicious lie, which Baraka propa
gates in his poem, is nothing more
than a crude Arab rumor.
Originally the al-Jazeera tele
vision network mistakenly re
ported that 4,000 Israelis worked
in the World Trade Center. Later
they corrected themselves to
about 400 Israelis, saying that

there were not 4,000 Israeli
workers in the twin towers.
This was promptly misinterpret
ed, and throughout the Middle
East, Arab leaders asked what hap
pened to the original 4,000 and
why they had not shown up to work
that day.
There were even several claims
that the attacks had been carried
out by Mossad, the Israeli intelli
gence agency.
Whether or not Baraka be
lieves this statement, he be
trayed his own feelings.
If he believed the Arab lie and
wrote about it without bothering to
check it against official data, that
displays his predisposition to be
lieve in an Israeli / Jewish interna
tional conspiracy, a common form
of anti-Semitism.
If Baraka doesn't believe the
4,000 rumor, then he is purpose
fully repeating lies about Jews, in
order to foster anti-Semitism
among his listeners. The fact that
this man was invited to speak at
Stanford and even praised by Pres
ident Hennessy sickens me. It is a
sign of the growing acceptance of
anti-Semitism at Stanford and in
America in general.
