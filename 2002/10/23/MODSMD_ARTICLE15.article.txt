# HIGH WATER RISING
## Feeding crocodiles: Why you can't 'fight terror with peace' 
### 
At the speech last Wednesday night by
former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, a
young woman politely asked the following
question, roughly paraphrased: If the meth
ods of fighting terror have grown more so
phisticated than ever —and the parties wag
ing this war more vigilant than ever — why
have we seen an increase in terrorism over
the last 50 years? Since war doesn't seem to
be working, wouldn't it be better, she in
quired, for us to finally start fighting terror
through peace? This question was met with
resounding applause.
I was not clapping.
I felt, at first, that the notion of fighting
terror through peace suggests a glaring non
sequitur. But hundreds around me were
moved to applause by her admonishment.
Why? Did those who clapped really see a
meaningful proposition in this young
woman's question? Assuming they did, I
could conceive of only two things she could
have meant by "fighting terror through
peace": The first is nonviolent resistance to
wards the terrorists, and the second is ap
peasement. The former is infeasible, and the
latter unbearable.

Nonviolence is the ex
clusive domain of the self
perceived victim. .African-
Americans fighting for
their civil rights, and Indi
ans fighting the British
reign, showed their
courage against their op
pressors by demanding
their freedom with quiet

dignity and unrelenting resolve. Although
the student in question seemed to be sug
gesting a change in the behavior of Western
powers (America and Israel), it seems to me
that no strategy would lend more credence
to the Palestinian cause — which is thor
oughly undercut by the terrorists in its ranks
— than a decision to adopt nonviolence as
the method of resistance.
But in the context at hand, a more irrele
vant recourse to terrorism than nonviolence
has never been suggested. Pursuing nonvio
lent resistance against terrorism credits the
terrorists with a victory they do not deserve:
We are not seeking to overcome terror from
a position of subservience, but rather to de
stroy it from a position of strength. The as

sumption of a victim's position (and the at
tendant use of a victim's tactics) would be
strategic suicide fora Western power. The
radical left might relish the conception, for it
would get many new opportunities to play its
favorite game: the substitution of reality for
relativism and hyper-empathy, manifested
in the constant search for new victims to em
brace. Should the West, by employing non
violence, itself play the victim out of sympa
thy for "victims" in the Muslim world —
while those "victims" continue to lash out
through force? Of course not.
Nonviolent protests in the West would be
targets for terrorists, not causes to recalibrate
their views. So it seems like this student
couldn't have been talking about nonvio
lence, but rather about recognizing and
changing our behavior to preempt and pre
vent the terrorists from ever wanting to at
tack us at all. "Fighting terror through
peace," it seems, means conducting a thor
ough inventory of our way of life, figuring
out why they hate it, and changing it accord
ingly. And why shouldn't we?
In 1938, Neville Chamberlain and
Edouard Daladier, the leaders of Britain and

France, set off fora meeting with the Chan
cellor of Germany. The carnage of WWI, the
threat of new violence, failing economies
and profound insecurity among their peo
ples ravaged the minds of the statesmen as
they departed for Munich.
Their nations had fought a world war,
but the treaty that ended it had further at
omized Europe, not ameliorated it. Cham
berlain and Daladier craved peace but
would not fight for it: At the meeting, they of
fered the man who sat across the table carte
blanche to invade and annex Czechoslo
vakia, in the hope that this resolution would
sensitively address the stated German need
for greater living space and thus preclude
further bloodshed.
This gesture of appeasement was be
stowed upon none other than Adolf Hitler;
its legacy is seared upon the pages of modern
history's darkest chapter. Yet 64 years later,
the "progressive" voices of the world stand
ready and eager to appease again.
Of course, fighting terror is not achieved
through force alone. Law enforcement co
operation, intelligence sharing between
countries, and more concerted efforts at eco

nomic engagement and diplomacy in places
where the West is hated or misunderstood,
are essential elements of the tight. But pas
sivity, masquerading as an a commitment to
"peace," is not.
And such hope is born of fear, not of vi
sion: As Sir Winston Churchill said, "an ap
peaser is one who feeds a crocodile, hoping
it will eat him last."
Israel, who stands to suffer the most di
rect and devastating consequences of an
American-led campaign against Iraq, is the
potential war's most vocal advocate.
Why? Because Israelis have no choice but
to confront the reality (and it is most certain
ly a reality) that a chemical attack today is bet
ter than a nuclear attack in 10 years. To ap
pease terrorist or rogue threats by "fighting
through peace" is to ignore history and — as
President Bush said in front of the United
Nations — to hope against evidence. Peace
must be won, and won decisively, before it
can be lastingly waged.

Israel, who stands to suffer the most di

American-led campaign against Iraq, is the
potential war's most vocal advocate.
Why? Because Israelis have no choice but
to confront the reality (and it is most certain
ly a reality) that a chemical attack today is bet
ter than a nuclear attack in 10 years. To ap

must be won, and won decisively, before it
can be lastingly waged.

At the speech last Wednesday night by
former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, a
young woman politely asked the following
question, roughly paraphrased: If the meth
ods of fighting terror have grown more so
phisticated than ever —and the parties wag
ing this war more vigilant than ever — why
have we seen an increase in terrorism over
the last 50 years? Since war doesn't seem to
be working, wouldn't it be better, she in
quired, for us to finally start fighting terror
through peace? This question was met with
resounding applause.
I was not clapping.
I felt, at first, that the notion of fighting
terror through peace suggests a glaring non
sequitur. But hundreds around me were
moved to applause by her admonishment.
Why? Did those who clapped really see a
meaningful proposition in this young
woman's question? Assuming they did, I
could conceive of only two things she could
have meant by "fighting terror through
peace": The first is nonviolent resistance to
wards the terrorists, and the second is ap
peasement. The former is infeasible, and the
latter unbearable.

Nonviolence is the ex
clusive domain of the self
perceived victim. .African-
Americans fighting for
their civil rights, and Indi
ans fighting the British
reign, showed their
courage against their op
pressors by demanding
their freedom with quiet

dignity and unrelenting resolve. Although
the student in question seemed to be sug
gesting a change in the behavior of Western
powers (America and Israel), it seems to me
that no strategy would lend more credence
to the Palestinian cause — which is thor
oughly undercut by the terrorists in its ranks
— than a decision to adopt nonviolence as
the method of resistance.
But in the context at hand, a more irrele
vant recourse to terrorism than nonviolence
has never been suggested. Pursuing nonvio
lent resistance against terrorism credits the
terrorists with a victory they do not deserve:
We are not seeking to overcome terror from
a position of subservience, but rather to de
stroy it from a position of strength. The as

sumption of a victim's position (and the at
tendant use of a victim's tactics) would be
strategic suicide fora Western power. The
radical left might relish the conception, for it
would get many new opportunities to play its
favorite game: the substitution of reality for
relativism and hyper-empathy, manifested
in the constant search for new victims to em
brace. Should the West, by employing non
violence, itself play the victim out of sympa
thy for "victims" in the Muslim world —
while those "victims" continue to lash out
through force? Of course not.
Nonviolent protests in the West would be
targets for terrorists, not causes to recalibrate
their views. So it seems like this student
couldn't have been talking about nonvio
lence, but rather about recognizing and
changing our behavior to preempt and pre
vent the terrorists from ever wanting to at
tack us at all. "Fighting terror through
peace," it seems, means conducting a thor
ough inventory of our way of life, figuring
out why they hate it, and changing it accord
ingly. And why shouldn't we?
In 1938, Neville Chamberlain and
Edouard Daladier, the leaders of Britain and

France, set off fora meeting with the Chan
cellor of Germany. The carnage of WWI, the
threat of new violence, failing economies
and profound insecurity among their peo
ples ravaged the minds of the statesmen as
they departed for Munich.
Their nations had fought a world war,
but the treaty that ended it had further at
omized Europe, not ameliorated it. Cham
berlain and Daladier craved peace but
would not fight for it: At the meeting, they of
fered the man who sat across the table carte
blanche to invade and annex Czechoslo
vakia, in the hope that this resolution would
sensitively address the stated German need
for greater living space and thus preclude
further bloodshed.
This gesture of appeasement was be
stowed upon none other than Adolf Hitler;
its legacy is seared upon the pages of modern
history's darkest chapter. Yet 64 years later,
the "progressive" voices of the world stand
ready and eager to appease again.
Of course, fighting terror is not achieved
through force alone. Law enforcement co
operation, intelligence sharing between
countries, and more concerted efforts at eco

nomic engagement and diplomacy in places
where the West is hated or misunderstood,
are essential elements of the tight. But pas
sivity, masquerading as an a commitment to
"peace," is not.
And such hope is born of fear, not of vi
sion: As Sir Winston Churchill said, "an ap
peaser is one who feeds a crocodile, hoping
it will eat him last."
