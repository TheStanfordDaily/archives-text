# Fellowships fund 10 assistant professors

### KATHERINE WANG 
Ten assistant professors in the Schools of
Medicine, Earth Sciences, Engineering and the
Humanities and Sciences have been awarded
Terman Fellowships this year, providing them
with funding that will have a pivotal role in
launching their research at the University.
"The funding is important in that it provides
the resources for the initial stages of research,"
said Molecular and Physiology Asst. Prof. Miriam
Goodman, who joined Stanford this January and
wasjust awarded a Terman Fellowship. "It serves
mainly as seed funding in order to compete suc
cessfully for outside funding."
The Terman Fellowship, established from a
$25 million gift from William Hewlett and
David Packard, grants up to $100,000 per year
for three years tojunior faculty members in the
fields of science and engineering. This money
allows many of the professors the ability to con
tinue their work at the University.
"The funding gives me additional resources
to push for my project," said Terman Fellow

and Chemistry Asst. Prof. Vijay Pande of the
School of Humanities and Sciences. "I have a
staff of about 10 people, so the budget really
does add up."
The 2002-2003 Terman Fellows are Neuro
biology Asst. Prof. Thomas Clandinin; Man
agement Science and Engineering Asst. Prof.
Feryal Erhun; Petroleum Engineering Asst.
Prof. Margot Gerritsen; Computer Science
Asst. Prof. Ashish Goel; Goodman; Pande; Bio
logical Sciences Asst. Profs. Elizabeth Hadly
and Michael Rexach; Electrical Engineering
Asst. Prof. Jelena Vuckovic; and Physics Asst.
Prof. Vladan Vuletic.
The esteem that comes with receiving the
award is indeed an invaluable part of a profes
sor's start on campus, some professors said.
"One additional component that this helps is
in getting good people, good resources, and
good funding to work with," Vuckovic said.
The Terman Fellowship is a source of ac
knowledgment from the academic community
and garners immediate attention from the pub
lic that may not have been otherwise received.

This is vital as Stanford professors are required
to both teach and conduct research to gain
tenure, a mandate known in academic circles as
"publish or perish."
Receiving the Terman Fellowship allows
many of the professors the freedom and flexi
bility they would not have had from other re
sources, such as the government.
"This enables me to do many experiments I
otherwise would not have been able to do as a
new professor," Clandinin said.
"I think it's wonderful," Vuckovic said. "It's
the best thing that can happen to someone at
the beginning of their career."
The Terman Fellows' research interests in
clude investigating how animals sense touch
and temperature using the roundworm species
C-elegans; finding the mechanisms that allow
proteins to assemble themselves so quickly and
efficiently; studying the mechanisms by which
neurons make connections in (he Central Ner
vous System; and researching the application
of photonic crystals in quantum information
science.
