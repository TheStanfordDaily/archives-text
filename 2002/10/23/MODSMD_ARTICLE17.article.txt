More than 200 students and
alumni attended a ceremony this
past weekend to honor the five in
ductees into the 2002 Multicultur
al Hall of Fame.
The Hall of Fame is cospon
sored by the Asian American Activ
ities Center, the Black Community
Services Center, El Centro Chi
cano, the Native American Cultur
al Center and the Stanford Alum
ni Association. Trustee W. Richard
West JD '71 served as master of
ceremonies at the induction, and
his presentation was followed by
speeches from the inductees.
"No university has done more
than Stanford in the past 20 years
to promote diversity," he said.
The Multicultural Hall of Fame
was established in 1995 at the sug
gestion of Trustee Charles Ogle
tree after the creation of an Alum
ni Minority Task Force. Every year
since 1995, each of the cultural
centers has admitted one or two
alumni, usually through a nomi
nation and voting process.
Native American Cultural Cen
ter inductee Charman J.K. Akina
was the first to accept his award.
After 30 years of work with the
Honolulu Medical Group, he re
tired and helped build the
Waimanolo Health center, which is
a nonprofit clinic to treat poverty
stricken Native Hawaiians living in
rural Oahu. He is the first native
Hawaiian to be inducted into the
Flail of Fame.
"I have a great deal of love for
Stanford," he said.
Husband and wife pair Glen
and Sakie Fukushima were Asian
American Activites center in
ductees. Sakie holds an MBA from
Stanford as well as a master's in ed
ucation from Harvard. She is the
Senior Client Partner / Regional
Managing Director of Japan for
Korn/ Ferry International, as well
as a member of the Global Con
sumer Specialty Markets groups
which regulates Japanese markets
in consumer goods, retail, apparel
and luxury goods.
Her husband is the President
and CEO of Cadence Design Sys
tems, a $1.4 billion software com
pany based out of Japan. Before
entering the private sector, he
worked in Washington D.C. at the

Office of the United States Trade
Representative.
The two were unable to attend
the event, but University Presi
dent John Hennessy will personal
ly present them with their awards
on his upcoming trip to Asia.
The BCSC inductee, Susan E.
Rice, is the former Assistant Secre
tary of State for African Affairs. A
history major from the class of
1986, she went on to receive a
Ph.D. in international relations
from Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar.
Rice previously worked as the
Special Assistant to the President
and Senior Director in African Af
fairs at the National Security
Council and was the co-recipient
of the White House's 2000 Samuel
Nelson Drew Memorial Award for
"distinguished contributions to
the formation of peaceful, cooper
ative relationships between the
states."
"I am very touched and hon
ored to be inducted," she said. "It
is an acknowledgement, in a sense,
from family."
The inductee for El Centro Chi
cano was Felix F. Guitierrez.
Guitierrez received his master's
in 1972 and a Ph.D. in 1976 in the
Department of Communication.
He is the author of several books
and scholarly articles on the topic
of racial diversity in the media.
While on faculty at the USC School
of Journalism, he was named Dean
of Student Academic Services and
Special programs, reportedly the
highest position ever held by a
member of the Latino community
at USC.
He spoke about his efforts as a
student to give the Latino commu
nity at Stanford more of a presence
on campus, as well as to acquire re
sources like El Centro Chicano and
Casa Zapata.
"We did not come to Stanford
to line up at a filling station and re
ceive information, but rather to
change what it was for us and for
everybody," he said.
One alumnus said that he is
very thankful for the ground
breaking work that Guitierrez did
while at Stanford.
"His speech really gave me
some perspective about how all of
the things that I enjoyed as a stu
dent were the result of student ac
tivism," Felipe Barragan '97 said.
