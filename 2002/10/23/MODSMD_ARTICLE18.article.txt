## Sailing has a busy weekend on water 
### MIA ASHTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If you thought the Stanford
campus was busy this past week
end with returning alumni, it was
nothing compared to the whirl
wind weekend that Stanford sail
ing had across the country.
The marquee event of the
weekend was the Navy Fall Inter
sectional in Annapolis, Md., which
tested the Cardinal's depth by de
manding two singlehanded and
two doublehanded boats in both
the A-Division and B-Division.
The addition of singlehanded
competition to the regatta re
quired a total of 14 races over two
days, in which the Cardinal proved
its consistency and endurance in a
plethora of wind conditions.
The duo of senior Ted Conrads
and sophomore Lucy Horton
wowed the other 19 opponents as
well as its coach with its solid work,
especially in the face of such tough
competition. The two finished in
the top-five in nine of the races.
"Ted and Lucy were consistent
in the changing conditions," coach
Jay Kehoe said. "They dominated
the field of Ail-American skippers
and crews."
Even when strong winds ne
cessitated a crew heavier than
Horton, the Stanford team
adapted well to the change.
Freshman Chris Ralli stood in for
Horton as crew in race six to win
alongside Conrads.
The B-I)ivision team confirmed
Stanford's tendency to perform
best in windy conditions, which the
team suspected after last week
end's poor performance in light
air at the Navy Women's event. Se
nior Dave Kenny and junior Sonja
Bebber performed well for Stan
ford in the B-Division in Satur
day's strong winds. Ralli replaced
Kenny as skipper for the 14th race

in lighter air. Overall, the com
bined performances of Kenny,
Bebber and Ralli left Stanford's B-
Division in 10th place.
Freshman Brian Haines, who
earlier this season was able to qual
ify for Singlehanded Nationals,
sailed a Laser sailboat in the C-Di
vision. Again, Haines performed
impressively, sailing competitively
against Georgetown sailor Andrew
Campbell, an Olympic hopeful for
2004. In the end, Haines, the sole
Stanford sailor to finish in the top
nine throughout the weekend,
closed the weekend fourth overall.
The large regatta even spon
sored a D-Division, in which
sophomore Jeff Allen participated.
Allen sailed in a Laser, which is not
his usual boat, but still he managed
to finish in the top-10 11 times in
14 races. His performance earned
him eighth place in the division.
In a surprising turn of events,
the Cardinal suffered from the
Naval Academy Race Committee's
scoring error. In fact, the commit
tee called fora re-sailing of two
races whose scores it had lost. Con
rads and Horton, the undisputed
winners of one of the two lost races,
petitioned for their original score.
But in the 20-team rush to rein
state previous scores, Stanford's
request was ignored. The mishap
resulted in an additional five
points being given to Stanford's A-
Division score and ultimately a
fifth-place overall finish for the
Cardinal.
In the end, Georgetown won
the Navy competition rather
handily, beating out second-place
Kings Point by 15 points.
Kehoe was proud of his squad's
performance in such a competitive
and demanding regatta.
"This finish is indicative of the
incredible depth of our present
Stanford sailing team," he said.
In a different sort of sailing

event, the Mission Bay Yacht club
supported an instructional Fresh
men / Sophomore Regatta at UC-
San Diego Saturday and Sunday.
As the event's name implies, the
competition included only those
sailors with one or two years of col
lege sailing experience.
The Cardinal performed well at
the regatta, with freshman Liz
Rountree and junior Margia Cor
ner impressively winning the A-Di
vision. Fine weather allowed for
the sailing of 12 races in both the A-
Division and B-Division. Stanford
placed fifth overall.
The Cardinal saw a full week

end of sailing as the team partici
pated in a third competition, the
Yale Women's Regatta. The races
proved challenging, as light wind
and a disqualification of the A-Di
vision team of junior Jen Porter
and sophomore Jessie Duncan re
sulted in a lOth-place finish in that
division. The B-Division duo ofju
niors Ashley Frush and Shadi
Mehraein also grappled with the
light air, finishing 14th.
The Cardinal's next regatta,
the Women's Fall Pacific Coast
Championships, will be held at
the Stanford Boathouse Saturday
and Sunday.

ify for Singlehanded Nationals,
sailed a Laser sailboat in the C-Di
vision. Again, Haines performed
impressively, sailing competitively
against Georgetown sailor Andrew
Campbell, an Olympic hopeful for
2004. In the end, Haines, the sole
Stanford sailor to finish in the top
nine throughout the weekend,
closed the weekend fourth overall.
The large regatta even spon
sored a D-Division, in which
sophomore Jeff Allen participated.
Allen sailed in a Laser, which is not
his usual boat, but still he managed
to finish in the top-10 11 times in
14 races. His performance earned
him eighth place in the division.
In a surprising turn of events,
the Cardinal suffered from the
Naval Academy Race Committee's
scoring error. In fact, the commit
tee called fora re-sailing of two
races whose scores it had lost. Con
rads and Horton, the undisputed
winners of one of the two lost races,
petitioned for their original score.
But in the 20-team rush to rein
state previous scores, Stanford's
request was ignored. The mishap
resulted in an additional five
points being given to Stanford's A-
Division score and ultimately a
fifth-place overall finish for the
Cardinal.
In the end, Georgetown won
the Navy competition rather
handily, beating out second-place
Kings Point by 15 points.
Kehoe was proud of his squad's
performance in such a competitive
and demanding regatta.
"This finish is indicative of the
incredible depth of our present
Stanford sailing team," he said.
In a different sort of sailing

event, the Mission Bay Yacht club
supported an instructional Fresh
men / Sophomore Regatta at UC-
San Diego Saturday and Sunday.
As the event's name implies, the
competition included only those
sailors with one or two years of col
lege sailing experience.
The Cardinal performed well at
the regatta, with freshman Liz
Rountree and junior Margia Cor
ner impressively winning the A-Di
vision. Fine weather allowed for
the sailing of 12 races in both the A-
Division and B-Division. Stanford
placed fifth overall.
The Cardinal saw a full week

end of sailing as the team partici
pated in a third competition, the
Yale Women's Regatta. The races
proved challenging, as light wind
and a disqualification of the A-Di
vision team of junior Jen Porter
and sophomore Jessie Duncan re
sulted in a lOth-place finish in that
division. The B-Division duo ofju
niors Ashley Frush and Shadi
Mehraein also grappled with the
light air, finishing 14th.
The Cardinal's next regatta,
the Women's Fall Pacific Coast
Championships, will be held at
the Stanford Boathouse Saturday
and Sunday.

Freshman Brian Haines sails in the singlehanded competition at the Navy Fall
Intersectional in Annapolis, Md., last weekend. Haines finished fourth in the
C-Division, helping Stanford to a fifth-place finish overall at the event, one of
several that Stanford sailors took part in over the weekend.
If you thought the Stanford
campus was busy this past week
end with returning alumni, it was
nothing compared to the whirl
wind weekend that Stanford sail
ing had across the country.
The marquee event of the
weekend was the Navy Fall Inter
sectional in Annapolis, Md., which
tested the Cardinal's depth by de
manding two singlehanded and
two doublehanded boats in both
the A-Division and B-Division.
The addition of singlehanded
competition to the regatta re
quired a total of 14 races over two
days, in which the Cardinal proved
its consistency and endurance in a
plethora of wind conditions.
The duo of senior Ted Conrads
and sophomore Lucy Horton
wowed the other 19 opponents as
well as its coach with its solid work,
especially in the face of such tough
competition. The two finished in
the top-five in nine of the races.
"Ted and Lucy were consistent
in the changing conditions," coach
Jay Kehoe said. "They dominated
the field of Ail-American skippers
and crews."
Even when strong winds ne
cessitated a crew heavier than
Horton, the Stanford team
adapted well to the change.
Freshman Chris Ralli stood in for
Horton as crew in race six to win
alongside Conrads.
The B-I)ivision team confirmed
Stanford's tendency to perform
best in windy conditions, which the
team suspected after last week
end's poor performance in light
air at the Navy Women's event. Se
nior Dave Kenny and junior Sonja
Bebber performed well for Stan
ford in the B-Division in Satur
day's strong winds. Ralli replaced
Kenny as skipper for the 14th race

in lighter air. Overall, the com
bined performances of Kenny,
Bebber and Ralli left Stanford's B-
Division in 10th place.
