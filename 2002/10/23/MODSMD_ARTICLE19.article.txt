## 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Stanford men's ultimate team
started the defense of its UPA national
title by taking top honors at last week
end's Chico Hops Ultimate Gathering at
Chico State, the Bloodthirsty's first tour
nament of the fall season.

CLUB SPORTS ROUNDUP

Despite playing with a short roster
that included only seven returning play
ers from last year's championship squad,
Bloodthirsty still looked as threatening
as ever, going 7-0 against a tough field
that included longtime rival Oregon.
Bloodthirsty got its first crack at Ore

gon — which over the last two years has
taken turns with Bloodthirsty in elimi
nating each other from the UPA North
west Regionals — in Saturday night's
feature game. Stanford took an early 1-0
lead in the season series against Oregon
with a narrow 15-13 win behind several
scoring catches by junior James Herbert.
That result was the closest Bloodthirsty
posted in Chico. The Stanford squad
cruised through pool play on Saturday,
starting things off with a 15-6 thrashing of
Oregon's rookie squad and a 15-4 domi
nation of Oregon State's B-team. Blood
thirsty saved its best for last in pool play,
bagelling the Chico State B-team 15-0.
In Sunday's quarterfinals, Blood
thirsty struggled to pull away from Chico
State's alumni team, holding a slim 9-8

lead early in the second half. But an in
spirational speech from senior captains
Bart Watson and Shreyas Vijaykumar
fired up the Stanford squad, which took
the next six points fora 15-9 win.
After advancing past Chico State's A
team 15-10 in the semifinals, Bloodthirsty
went toe-to-toe with Humboldt State in the
finals. The back-and-forth game was
swung into Stanford's favor for good by a
late handblock by Vijaykumar, and Blood
thirsty walked away with a 15-10 win.
Bloodthirsty returns to action Nov. 9
at the Sean Ryan Invitational in Santa
Cruz.
Badminton
The Stanford badminton club took to
UC-Davis for its season opener last
weekend, but with several key players
out of its lineup, the Cardinal squad was
only able to win four of the meet's 13
matches.
Sophomore Catherine Wong was the
only women's single player to pick up a
win, taking down the Aggies' Janice
Wang in three sets. Stanford freshman
Cyndy Chen fell to Regina Tran 1 1-7,
13-10, while Davis' Shirly Leung outlast
ed sophomore Janie Funamura in three.
First-year graduate Kyle Chan and
junior Trung Lai both crushed their sin
gles opponents on the men's side, but
first-year graduate Oren Shiran was un
able to put away the Aggies' Kendrick
Liu after taking the first set, ultimately
falling 11-5 in the decisive third set.
Holding even wi th the Aggies
through singles play, the Cardinal
couldn't keep things together in the
doubles competition, going 1-6 to cede
the match to Davis.
Stanford was shorthanded on the
men's side, as first-team doubles player se
nior Jay Simon was sidelined with a sepa
rated shoulder. The Cardinal men got
swept handily in both of their matches.
The women's team of Wong and senior
Julia Chu held with Davis' Leung and
Lynn Chee, eventually falling 17-14, 15-8,
but the Stanford team of Chen and fresh
man Linda Tran went down 15-1, 15-1.

twosomes were able to take a set from the

Aggies' pairings in the men's and
women's doubles competitions,
Stanford did have a measure of
success in mixed doubles. Shiran
and Chu teamed up for the Car
dinal's only doubles win, taking

out Davis' Chee and Phil Kwong
15-9, 15-6. Stanford's Funamura
and freshman David Wang kept
things close with the Aggies' team
of Scott Hsiang and Rita Lin in
their 15-13, 15-10 loss, but the
Cardinal pairing of Lai and Tran
was no match for Tony Phan and
Belindo Ho of Davis, who cruised
to a 15-2, 15-7 win.
"The teams we lined up had

never really practiced together,"
Lai said. "Similarly, the girls dou
ble teams had not really played to
gether this year. The thrashing we
took from Davis in those events
means we'll need to do a bit more
doubles practice with regular,
fixed partners."
Stanford will return to Davis
this weekend for the Davis Fall

CLUB SPORTS ROUNDUP

Despite playing with a short roster
that included only seven returning play
ers from last year's championship squad,
Bloodthirsty still looked as threatening
as ever, going 7-0 against a tough field
that included longtime rival Oregon.
Bloodthirsty got its first crack at Ore

gon — which over the last two years has
taken turns with Bloodthirsty in elimi
nating each other from the UPA North
west Regionals — in Saturday night's
feature game. Stanford took an early 1-0
lead in the season series against Oregon
with a narrow 15-13 win behind several
scoring catches by junior James Herbert.
That result was the closest Bloodthirsty
posted in Chico. The Stanford squad
cruised through pool play on Saturday,
starting things off with a 15-6 thrashing of
Oregon's rookie squad and a 15-4 domi
nation of Oregon State's B-team. Blood
thirsty saved its best for last in pool play,
bagelling the Chico State B-team 15-0.
In Sunday's quarterfinals, Blood
thirsty struggled to pull away from Chico
State's alumni team, holding a slim 9-8

lead early in the second half. But an in
spirational speech from senior captains
Bart Watson and Shreyas Vijaykumar
fired up the Stanford squad, which took
the next six points fora 15-9 win.
After advancing past Chico State's A
team 15-10 in the semifinals, Bloodthirsty
went toe-to-toe with Humboldt State in the
finals. The back-and-forth game was
swung into Stanford's favor for good by a
late handblock by Vijaykumar, and Blood
thirsty walked away with a 15-10 win.
Bloodthirsty returns to action Nov. 9
at the Sean Ryan Invitational in Santa
Cruz.
Badminton
The Stanford badminton club took to
UC-Davis for its season opener last
weekend, but with several key players
out of its lineup, the Cardinal squad was
only able to win four of the meet's 13
matches.

only women's single player to pick up a
win, taking down the Aggies' Janice
Wang in three sets. Stanford freshman
