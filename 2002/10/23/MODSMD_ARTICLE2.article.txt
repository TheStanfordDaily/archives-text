# Governor speaks in Palo Alto
## Demonstrators both for and against Davis rally outside the Technet Forum 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Gov. Gray Davis, Class of' 64, discussed
his political platform — emphasizing his
successes in education, labor and health
care — in front of hundreds of technology
industry employees yesterday evening
during the Technet Forum at the Hyatt
Rickeys Hotel in Palo Alto.
While his speech jumped from topic to
topic, Davis repeatedly returned to a
theme of investment —in education,
medical research and California workers
and businesses.
Prior to the speech, dozens of demon
strators for and against Davis loudly ex
changed their respective viewpoints con
cerning the upcoming gubernatorial
election.
David Shashoua, treasurer of the Cali
fornia Young Republicans of Silicon Val
ley, declared that Davis' record as gover
nor "speaks for itself."
"We need to help show how much gov
ernment corruption has been happening
with Davis," Shashoua said. "Our roads
are sick, our education system is a flop —
if you turn a $12 billion surplus into at
least a $24 billion deficit with more regula
tions causing small businesses to leave and
move out of our state, there are hardly any
jobs at small- to mid-sized firms."
Kathleen Sundaram, who supports
Davis' Republican opponent, Bill Simon,

said that she was not associated with any
specific organization, but was protesting
on her own initiative.
"I am concerned how Davis has driven
the state into the ground — union mem
bers being fooled, taxing anything that
moved," Shundaram said. "The economy
will be more depressed with no building or
construction projects for the workers to
work in. They are all fooling themselves.
We have had it."
She went on to explain that "the press
has just been putting up the image that
Simon is a flawed candidate ... but to elect
Davis is like a woman who goes back to her
abusive spouse."
Joe Keys, a member of the Internation
al Union of Painters and Allied Trades
(District Council 16), was among the pro-
Davis supporters on the street.
"We are out here to come to Davis'
[speech] tonight," Keys said. "Upon notic
ing the Simon supporters, we brought out
our signs to show our side of the issue.
"I found out [about this speech] from
my union meeting," he added.
Keys explained that he and his fellow
Davis supporters have done all they can to
back the governor in his reelection bid,
and that sometimes they even go to protest
at Simon's speeches.
According to Steve Havens, the political
director for lUPAT, the union members
are in support of the governor because "he
has been a big help to the working folks."
Havens went on to explain that Davis
has signed a number of important bills, in
cluding the reinstatement of an eight
hour work day and increasing worker
compensation, as well as ensuring prevail
ing wage compliance — "everything that

makes it fair fora worker."
Keys said that he felt the pro-Davis sup
porters' presence was important as a coun
terbalance to the anti-Davis protesters.
"We, just like them, use our right to free
speech and make sure that people hear us
and hear our voice," Keys said. "Anywhere
that the governor shows up, we are look
ing to be there to support him and to have
our unionists and fellow working families
realize that Davis is the candidate that sup
ports working people."
In his speech, Davis stressed the impor
tance of implementing plans that are both
advantageous in the short term, yet also vi
able long-term solutions and improve
ments on the status quo.
"I am a great believer that we all stand
on someone else's shoulders," Davis said.
"The opportunities we have today are the
result of someone else's hard work. We
have an obligation to make such invest
ments in our children, to give them op
portunities we won't have, just as those
who invested in our future did not have
the opportunity to reap the benefits of the
investments they made."
He addressed the improvements in
public education his administration has
striven toward during his four-year tei m.
"By all accounts, California schools were
[ranked] 50 out of 50 or 49 out of 50 when
I entered office," Davis said. "We have in
vested in teacher training, in more tech
nology, new textbooks, and test scores are
up four years in a row—people are excited
about learning. Spending-wise we were
last, now we are about 26th."
The governor explained that he wants

Governor Gray Davis speaks during the Technet Forum at the Hyatt Rickeys Hotel last night. He
discussed his political platform and emphasized recent successes in health care and education.
"to make sure that every child's
dream comes true; I want you to be
happy." He also brought up the
statewide college-merit scholarship
programs that were introduced
during his term.
"Do your part, and the state will
do its part to pay all the academic
costs to go to a four-year college,"
Davis said. "That child will get mo
tivated, go to school and widen his
horizons."
In addition to state money that is
going toward supporting students'
college educations, Davis added
that he is simultaneously trying to
maintain college costs.
"One of the things we have done
is to keep the fees and tuition for our
Cal states and [community colleges]
and UCs as low as they have been
since 1992," Davis said. "I am asking
the legislature not to raise the fees,

because when you raise the fees, you
freeze out students who cannot af
ford it. I am convinced there are
productive students who will bring
us joy and pleasure and pay us back
many times more."
Another key point of his address
was the investments being made to
ward medical research.
"You will see drugs that will ex
tend life and improve life," Davis
said. "I am not going to create the
cure for AIDS or Parkinson's dis
ease or cancer, but I want to create
the atmosphere here for world
class scientists. We believe in invest
ing in people."
He also commented that innov
ative scientific research centers
have been established at various
schools within the University of
California system and wished to
"thank the legislature for giving
me the honor to allow the full
scope of research on stem cells."
Davis emphasized the progres
sive nature of California.
"I am very proud that we have

invested in enhanced workers'
compensation, a strong new pre
vailing wage law and paid family
leave —we are the first state in
America to do that," Davis said.
"Our HMOs were the first reforms
in the country. We have given you
and every patient a whole lot of
rights you wanted."
He explained that the state
should take advantage of its unique
character by urging both other
states and those overseas to pur
chase the distinctive products that
California has to offer.
Overall, the governor expressed
that he believes the state is on the
right track.
"We are where the American
dream is most alive and
well . . . We have a great future,
my friends. We are going through
a natural recession, but the sky is
the limit on where we can go,"
Davis said. "It is our obligation to
make investments — and it is
amazing how quickly such invest
ments can pay dividends."
