# Football prepares to face UCLA after win
## 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN STAFF WRITER 
Against Arizona on Saturday,
Stanford (2-4, 1-2 Pacific-10
Conference) needed a win.
And it may not have been
pretty, but the Cardinal did just
enough right to get its first con
ference victory of the season.
"We did what we had to do,"
coach Buddy Teevens said.
On Saturday, the Cardinal
played tenacious defense,
haunting Wildcat quarterback
Jason Johnson all day. The Car
dinal finished with six sacks
while holding Johnson to 244
yards with three interceptions.
On Saturday, the Cardinal
running game found its rhythm,
as senior Kerry Carter ran for 98
of the team's 175 rushing yards.
Even junior quarterback Chris
Lewis showed off his athletic
ability, scrambling for 45 yards.
But on Saturday, the Cardi
nal was again unable to get in
the end zone with any real con
sistency. Similar to its previous
four games, Stanford had trou
ble converting when it was fac
ing a short field.
"We had our scoring opportu
nities. Penalties knocked us out of
a couple," Teevens said. "There
are things that have haunted us.
We're there, but not in the quan
tity we've seen previously."
Against the Wildcats, the Car
dinal rallied behind the perfor
mance of sophomore backup
tight end Alex Smith. Smith fin
ished the game with 120 receiv
ing yards and the Cardinal's sole
touchdown. More importantly,
he was able to make the big plays
when it counted, especially on
third downs.
"Alex had a great game over
all," redshirt freshman quarter

back Kyle Matter said. "He was
reliable on any third-and-long.
We focus a lot of our throwing
on the outside receivers, so
when looking inside, Alex
was a big part of that."
However, Smith would not
have been able to have such a big
game without the improvement
in the Cardinal's emerging run
ning attack.
"We still had some mistakes
today, but once we saw the run
ning game was working today
and after we started taking time
off the clock, if it's not broken,
don't fix it," Carter said.
With some momentum be
hind it now, the Cardinal must
leave the friendly confines of
Stanford Stadium, where it has
played the last two weekends,
for the Rose Bowl to face UCLA
(4-3, 1-2).
"This is a happier week for
us," Teevens said. "The attitude
of this team is positive, and it was
nice to come away with a win."
Some of the controversies
surrounding the team have
begun to quiet down as well.
The quarterback controversy is
clearly over as Lewis has be
come the definite starter. How
ever, after slightly injuring
himself on Saturday, Lewis
may not be able to get as many
snaps against UCLA as he did
against Arizona.
"He had a lot of reps last
week, and I thought it was pro
ductive for him," Teevens said.
"Last week was his best perfor
mance to date in terms of what
he needed to do. Fora guy that
has been through as much as he
has, he probably does not need
as many reps. We would like
him to get as much as possible,
