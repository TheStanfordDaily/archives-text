# Madden meets Full Moon
## 
### 
Asportswriter's view on Monday
night's debauchery: Three years
have come and gone since I stum
bled down to the Quad as a wide
eyed freshman who thought Full Moon on
the Quad wasjust another dorm activity, like
the scavenger hunt or broomball.
After surveying Monday night's action, I
can only say diat the puck has officially
dropped on the 2002-03 tonsil-hockey season.
But I think that with Full Moon on the

Quad falling on a Monday
night this year, they could
have juiced it up a little bit
(not that there weren't
enough juices being ex
changed to begin with). We
should have stolen a little
bit of Monday Night Foot
ball's style. The jet flyovers.
Melissa Stark. The heavy

country music ("Are you ready for some
mono?"). Melissa Stark. The helmets flying
into each other. Melissa Stark.
Can't you just imagine John Madden up
in the booth, analyzing each kiss in excruci
ating detail with the telestrator?
Madden: "Now you see, Al, the guy goes
in here. He's going to fake the freshman
route (big yellow telestrator line here), then
comeback with the senior buttonhook! He's
got that sorority girl cornerback trapped in
double coverage! (violent scribbling) She's
got no escape from that double-team! He's
definitely All-Madden."
Al: "Yes, John, good observation."
Madden: "You know what I love about
this match-up, .Al? We've got a real underdog
here. He spent much of the offseason doing
solo reps and strengthening those forearms.
He's put in his time, he believed he could pull
it off , and he did. He really came through in
the clutch â€” a prime-time player."
Then the helmets crash on the Jum
botron and Melissa Stark is in there for the
postkiss interview.
Melissa: "So, what did your coach talk to
you about before the game tonight?"
Freshman: "You know, my RAgave us a
little Rudy-esque speech before we left
Otero. He said, 'You're 5-foot-nothin', 100-
and-nothin' and you have nearly a speck of
macking ability. And you hung in there with
the best-looking college freshmen for the
last two weeks. And you're getting a degree
from Stanford University. In this life, you

don't have to prove nothin' to nobody but
yourself.' So I was just trying to go out there
and make my RA proud - by bagging some
senior chicks."
We could even have a closing shot of the
RAin question being doused by a celebrato
ry Gatorade jug filled with malt liquor. It
would have been 0.E.-riffic.
Going with the football theme, I think
we should make Full Moon on the Quad
a Pac-10 event as well. Look, who
wouldn't love a Full Moon match-up with
the UCLA Bruins? Come on. A home
and-home series with Arizona State?
Eventually we could have an All-Confer
ence team that could travel to bowl games
against other conferences. Who can beat a
West Coast offense in a match-up like
that? Honestly, Teevens could have
everyone fun-and-gunnin' girls (or guys)
in no time.
The officials would have a field day be
cause penalties were all over the place Mon
day night. In fact, I heard reports of the fol
lowing transgressions from my undercover
observers:
Illegal Use of Hands. I think that no de
scription is really needed for this one.
Ineligible Upperclassman. On the grid
iron, you'll get called if you're a lineman
caught downfield; on the Quad, you'll get
called if you're caught as a sophomore or ju
nior posing as a senior to grade the new
freshman meat.
Too Many Men on the Freshman. Just
because she's the one freshman girl to actu
ally "participate" in Full Moon doesn't
mean that you and all of your friends
should rush on her like the guys from
"Night at the Roxbury."
Too Many Men Naked. See above, only
more so.
Encroachment. Usually only thrown after
repeated offenses of jumping die gun or in
vading the neutral zone without consent of
the other party (see also "False Start").
Roughing the Shy Introverted Freshman
Girl Under the Influence for the First Time
in Her Life and Still Reeling from the Recent
Breakup with Her Longtime High School
Sweetheart Who Just Informed Her Fhat
He Banged His Next-Door Neighbor in His
Freshman Dorm at UCLA Enough said.
Of course, there were probably other
