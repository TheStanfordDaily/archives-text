# J.T. Slacker and lazy baseball
## 
### 
Generally, I try to avoid
postgame interviews
given that they tend to
be filled with asinine
questions and pointless informa
tion. I really cannot fathom the
thought process going through
the interviewer's mind when he
decides that asking a question like
"Do you think scoring more points
than the other team had anything
to do with your win today?" is
somehow insightful.
But with my remote control
being a good six feet away after the
Giants Game 1 victory in the
World Series, I resigned myself to
watching the postgame interview
with the game's hero J.T. Snow,
who had a big two-run home run
in the sixth inning.
After several minutes of mind
less drivel that undoubtedly low
ered the IQ of everyone watch
ing, Snow made one of the more
ridiculous comments I've been
privy to hearing from a profes
sional athlete (at least one with
any dignity).
When asked whether the fact
that he was not in the lineup for as
many regular-season games as he
has in the past has been the reason
for his solid postseason play, Snow
responded by stating that you can't
give 100 percent in every baseball
game or you'll never last. It is im
portant to pace yourself through
out the season.
Now I don't pretend to be an
expert on the everyday rigors of a
baseball season, but how can any
one being paid $5.9 million a sea
son claim that he can't go all out for
the entirety of a baseball game? It's
baseball, one of the least physically
draining sports ever invented. In
what other sport do they schedule
doubleheaders with the knowl
edge that the players really
shouldn't be so tired after the first
game to prevent them from play
ing a second?
What really irritates me about
Snow's comment is that he is a first
baseman, the least physically de-

manding position
in the least physi
cally demanding
sport. Going all
out fora first
baseman means
possibly diving
once or twice,
catching the ball
when it's thrown

to you and running when you get
a base hit (and when you're bat
ting average is .246, that's not all
that much running).
I don't imagine that Giants
manager Dusty Baker walks over
to Barry Bonds and says "Barry,
you've been swinging that bat real
ly hard lately. Why don't you give
it a rest today, and let's go have
some Fresca."
Jerry Rice is a 40-year-old wide
receiver for the Oakland Raiders
who owns every major receiving
record in the history of the NFL.
He has had major knee surgeries,
and his body has been battered in
every conceivable way by 225-
pound strong safeties running full
speed with the sole intent of hitting
him as hard as they possibly can.
But you will never see Jerry Rice
pacing himself through a game.
That's probably the reason why
Jerry Rice is the greatest wide re
ceiver to ever play the game.
Can anyone honestly say that a
sport in which one of its most dec
orated, recognizable players, Babe
Ruth, had the figure of Rosie
O'Donnell after an all-you-can-eat
beef brisket binge, and another,
Mickey Mantle, regularly drank
more than Robert Downey, Jr., on
his finest day, is so demanding on
your body that you can't play every
game hard?
Maybe J. T. Snow should have a
nice long chat with guys like An
dres Galarraga or Fric Davis, two
baseball players who battled back
from life-threatening cancer to get
another shot at the game they love.
I'm sure they'd be appalled to hear
that someone whose been given
talent, fame and wealth beyond

the comprehension of most people
in this world doesn't want to chase
down that fly ball because he's sav
ing himself for the playoffs.
If you were to ask one of the
millions of Dominican children
who play baseball every day of
their lives with the dream of one
day being able to escape the ex
treme poverty they face if it were
possible to play hard every day, I
doubt many of them would share
Snow's opinion.
I for one hope that J.T. Snow
continues his excellent postseason
performance throughout this
World Series. It would be a real
shame if guys like Barry Bonds
and Jeff Kent were denied their
chance to wear a World Series ring
because their supporting cast
didn't give it their all. Let's just
hope that all that coasting will pay
off big when it counts.

economics, and he has yet to meet a seri
ous Angels fan who cheeredfor the team
before they went to the World Series. He

it a rest today, and let's go have
some Fresca."
Jerry Rice is a 40-year-old wide
receiver for the Oakland Raiders
who owns every major receiving
record in the history of the NFL.
He has had major knee surgeries,
and his body has been battered in
every conceivable way by 225-
pound strong safeties running full
speed with the sole intent of hitting
him as hard as they possibly can.
But you will never see Jerry Rice
pacing himself through a game.
That's probably the reason why
Jerry Rice is the greatest wide re
ceiver to ever play the game.
Can anyone honestly say that a
sport in which one of its most dec
orated, recognizable players, Babe
Ruth, had the figure of Rosie
O'Donnell after an all-you-can-eat
beef brisket binge, and another,
Mickey Mantle, regularly drank
more than Robert Downey, Jr., on
his finest day, is so demanding on
your body that you can't play every
game hard?
Maybe J. T. Snow should have a
nice long chat with guys like An
dres Galarraga or Fric Davis, two
baseball players who battled back
from life-threatening cancer to get
another shot at the game they love.
I'm sure they'd be appalled to hear
that someone whose been given
talent, fame and wealth beyond

the comprehension of most people
in this world doesn't want to chase
down that fly ball because he's sav
ing himself for the playoffs.
If you were to ask one of the
millions of Dominican children
who play baseball every day of
their lives with the dream of one
day being able to escape the ex
treme poverty they face if it were
possible to play hard every day, I
doubt many of them would share
Snow's opinion.
I for one hope that J.T. Snow
continues his excellent postseason
performance throughout this
World Series. It would be a real
shame if guys like Barry Bonds
and Jeff Kent were denied their
chance to wear a World Series ring
because their supporting cast
didn't give it their all. Let's just
hope that all that coasting will pay
off big when it counts.

Generally, I try to avoid
postgame interviews
given that they tend to
be filled with asinine
questions and pointless informa
tion. I really cannot fathom the
thought process going through
the interviewer's mind when he
decides that asking a question like
"Do you think scoring more points
than the other team had anything
to do with your win today?" is
somehow insightful.
But with my remote control
being a good six feet away after the
Giants Game 1 victory in the
World Series, I resigned myself to
watching the postgame interview
with the game's hero J.T. Snow,
who had a big two-run home run
in the sixth inning.
After several minutes of mind
less drivel that undoubtedly low
ered the IQ of everyone watch
ing, Snow made one of the more
ridiculous comments I've been
privy to hearing from a profes
sional athlete (at least one with
any dignity).
When asked whether the fact
that he was not in the lineup for as
many regular-season games as he
has in the past has been the reason
for his solid postseason play, Snow
responded by stating that you can't
give 100 percent in every baseball
game or you'll never last. It is im
portant to pace yourself through
out the season.
Now I don't pretend to be an
expert on the everyday rigors of a
baseball season, but how can any
one being paid $5.9 million a sea
son claim that he can't go all out for
the entirety of a baseball game? It's
baseball, one of the least physically
draining sports ever invented. In
what other sport do they schedule
doubleheaders with the knowl
edge that the players really
shouldn't be so tired after the first
game to prevent them from play
ing a second?
What really irritates me about
Snow's comment is that he is a first
baseman, the least physically de-

manding position
in the least physi
cally demanding
sport. Going all
out fora first
baseman means
possibly diving
once or twice,
catching the ball
when it's thrown

to you and running when you get
a base hit (and when you're bat
ting average is .246, that's not all
that much running).
I don't imagine that Giants
manager Dusty Baker walks over
to Barry Bonds and says "Barry,
you've been swinging that bat real
ly hard lately. Why don't you give
it a rest today, and let's go have
some Fresca."
