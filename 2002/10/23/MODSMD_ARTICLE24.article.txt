## Astronomers discover 10th rock from sun Object is most distant body photographed by optical telescope 
### AMIT GARG STAFF WRITER 
Astronomers at CalTech an
nounced about two weeks ago the
discovery of a new "planet" in the
solar system. It is not Planet X, a
hypothetical massive 10th rock
from the sun, but it is still a remark
able find. The object is about half
the size of Pluto and the largest rock
discovered since Pluto was identi
fied in 1930.
The new object has been provi
sionally named 2002 LM6O, but its
finders are already calling it by the
nickname Quaoar. Quaoar is 4 bil
lion miles from the sun, takes about
288 years to complete an orbit, and
is the most distant body in the solar
system photographed by an optical
telescope.
The discovery reflects the im
provements in astronomers' capac
ity to focus light from very faint dis
tant objects. It also raises the
prospects of discovering even larg
er rocks in the icy Kuiper belt, a
rocky belt beyond Pluto.
Color is only skin deep, but it
has important implications in
health. According to anthropolo
gists Nina Jablonski and George
Chaplin from the California Acad
emy of Sciences, the evolution of
skin pigmentation is related to
hairlessness. Homo sapiens are the

only primates with mostly hairless
skin. Over the course of evolution,
humans have adapted to their
habitat, allowing adequate vitamin
D absorption from the sun while
still protecting from UV radiation.
Thus, humans have darker col
ored skins in hotter Africa than in
colder Europe.
In the last hundred years, how
ever, extensive human migration
around the globe has created
problems. Our bodies are not able
to adjust spontaneously as we
move from one UV radiation pat
tern to a totally different one, in
creasing the risk of vitamin D defi
ciency and skin cancers. Still, as
Jablonksi and Chaplin have point
ed out, the ability of skin color to
adapt is nevertheless remarkable
and should be "celebrated as a vis
ible manifestation of our evolution
as a species."
AIDS can be ultimately fatal,
but there is a small subset of peo
ple who get infected with HIV,
but never develop the disease. For
example, Magic Johnson, the fa
mous ex-Lakers star, still has a
negligible viral blood count, years
after he contracted HIV. Dr.

The new discovery, which scientists have already nicknamed Quaoar, is 4
billion miles from the sun. It takes about 288 years to complete its orbit.
