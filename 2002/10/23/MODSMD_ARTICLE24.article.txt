## Astronomers discover 10th rock from sun Object is most distant body photographed by optical telescope 
### AMIT GARG STAFF WRITER 
Astronomers at CalTech an
nounced about two weeks ago the
discovery of a new "planet" in the
solar system. It is not Planet X, a
hypothetical massive 10th rock
from the sun, but it is still a remark
able find. The object is about half
the size of Pluto and the largest rock
discovered since Pluto was identi
fied in 1930.
The new object has been provi
sionally named 2002 LM6O, but its
finders are already calling it by the
nickname Quaoar. Quaoar is 4 bil
lion miles from the sun, takes about
288 years to complete an orbit, and
is the most distant body in the solar
system photographed by an optical
telescope.
The discovery reflects the im
provements in astronomers' capac
ity to focus light from very faint dis
tant objects. It also raises the
prospects of discovering even larg
er rocks in the icy Kuiper belt, a
rocky belt beyond Pluto.
Color is only skin deep, but it
has important implications in
health. According to anthropolo
gists Nina Jablonski and George
Chaplin from the California Acad
emy of Sciences, the evolution of
skin pigmentation is related to
hairlessness. Homo sapiens are the

only primates with mostly hairless
skin. Over the course of evolution,
humans have adapted to their
habitat, allowing adequate vitamin
D absorption from the sun while
still protecting from UV radiation.
Thus, humans have darker col
ored skins in hotter Africa than in
colder Europe.
In the last hundred years, how
ever, extensive human migration
around the globe has created
problems. Our bodies are not able
to adjust spontaneously as we
move from one UV radiation pat
tern to a totally different one, in
creasing the risk of vitamin D defi
ciency and skin cancers. Still, as
Jablonksi and Chaplin have point
ed out, the ability of skin color to
adapt is nevertheless remarkable
and should be "celebrated as a vis
ible manifestation of our evolution
as a species."
AIDS can be ultimately fatal,
but there is a small subset of peo
ple who get infected with HIV,
but never develop the disease. For
example, Magic Johnson, the fa
mous ex-Lakers star, still has a
negligible viral blood count, years
after he contracted HIV. Dr.

The new discovery, which scientists have already nicknamed Quaoar, is 4
billion miles from the sun. It takes about 288 years to complete its orbit.

Diamond AIDS Research Center,
may have an explanation for this
phenomenon.
Ho and colleagues have identi
fied three proteins that are present
in "non-progressors" but not in
AIDS patients. The scientists hope
these proteins can offer new in
sights into fighting HIV.
Currently the best-established
method to combat AIDS is a com
bination of anti-retrovirals that at
tack the enzyme responsible for
translating the viral genes and pro
teases, which break key proteins.
However, neither of these treat
ments has been effective for more
than a very short period of time, as
HIV has continuously mutated to
counter these drugs and others
like them.
Approximately 11,000 animal
and plant species are currently

endangered, an increase of almost
120 from two years ago. Further
more, the 7,000 experts tracking
this trend also counted about 800
species as extinct in the past 500
years. The criteria fora specie
being endangered is variable but
usually means there are less than
100 individuals of the specie in the
wild.
Over the years, there have
been some success stories. For in
stance, two species which were
thought extinct have since been
rediscovered. Also, a few species
have recovered enough to be re
moved from the endangered list.
However, for the most part, the
trend has been an alarming de
crease in species numbers
throughout the globe. Conserva
tionists believe the current extinc
tion rate is 1,000 to 10,000 times
higher than it should be under
natural conditions.
Store your data in plastic.
Sounds implausible? Well, that is
exactlv what scientists in Utah and

Ohio are investigating. The re
searchers are hoping to convert
plastic into a device that can be
read and utilized by the computer.
This would be done through a
technique called spin polarization.
In this technique, data would be
encoded as electrons with a spin
up or a spin down. So far success
has only been achieved in poly
mers but the researchers have re
ported initial progress with plastics
as well. Optimistic analysts predict
the technology could be publicly
available within five years. Plastic
spintronics could even replace tra
ditional electronics, dramatically
improving speed, efficiency and
cost of computers.
Researchers in Japan pub

lished in Nature their discovery
of a transparent insulating mate
rial that becomes a conductor
when exposed to UV lights. The
scientists built a metal oxide to
trap hydrogen atoms and then
heated the structure. This caused
negatively charged hydride atoms
to be entrapped, thus transform
ing an insulator into a conductor.
This technology would allow cir
cuits to be "imprinted" cheaply
while providing accurate control.
Traditional circuits, on the other
hand, require switches and have
to be built in layers, a more ex
pensive process. This discovery
could potentially be used in prac
tically any electronic device, in
cluding computer screens and
mobile phones.

Scientists are hoping that "non-progressors," those who are infected by HIV
but do not develop AIDS, can offer new insights into fighting HIV (shown in
this 3D computer model).
