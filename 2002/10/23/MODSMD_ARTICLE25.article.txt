# Beyond sci-fi: a deeper look at cloning
## 
### DESPINA CHRISTOPOULOU 
Almost every day, the media
presents debates on human
cloning, but often fails to educate
readers on the basic science be
hind the technique. In fact,
cloning is much more complicated
than they would lead us to believe.
There are three types of cloning
— embryo cloning, the therapeu
tic cloning and adult DNA cloning
— that often fall under the um
brella of cloning because of the
common scientific pathway they
follow. But each works towards
different goals.
Cloning is the creation of iden
tical cells from the same "parent"
cell. Identical here means geneti
cally identical to each other and to
their common ancestor. As a pro
cedure, cloning has been around
fora long time. For example,
when we buy roses from a floral
shop, the rose we buy is usually a
clone because it is genetically
identical to every other specimen.
One of the first instances of an
imal cloning was when re
searchers led by Prof. Gerald
Schatten of the Oregon Health
Sciences University split one Rhe
sus monkey embryo into four.
First, they fertilized an egg with
a sperm to produce a zygote, or a
single-celled embryo. After this zy
gote had grown into an 8-celled
embryo, it was divided into four 2-
celled embryos. Each of these was
then implanted into four monkey
mothers. Only one of the four em
bryos survived and was born 157

days later. She was named Tetra
after the Greek prefix for "four."
This type of cloning is called em
bryo cloning or "artificial twin
ning," because it simulates the
mechanism by which natural
twins develop.
In biological research, it is often
useful to have genetically identical
animals so that different experi
mental results can be attributed to
the factor being researched rather
than to genetic incompatibility.
The second type of cloning is
adult DNA cloning. The goal of
this technique is to produce a du
plicate of an existing animal. The
sheep Dolly was created with this
technique in 1997 by the embryol
ogist Dr. Lan Wilmut and his team
at the Roslin Institute.
In their experiment, a cell was
taken from the mammary tissue of
a mature 6-year-old sheep while
its DNA was in a dormant state. It
was fused with a sheep ovum that
had had its nucleus removed. The
"fertilized" cell was then stimulat
ed with an electric pulse.
Out of 277 attempts at cell fu
sion, only 29 progressed enough
to be implanted in ewes. Thirteen
became pregnant but only one
lamb, Dolly, was born.
The technique would work
similarly in humans. The DNA
from an ovum would be removed
and replaced with the DNA from
an adult individual. Then, the fer
tilized ovum, now called a pre-em
bryo, would be implanted in a
womb and allowed to develop into
a new human organism.

The third type of cloning is
therapeutic cloning. In this proce
dure, the DNA is removed from a
woman's ovum. The DNA from
another human cell is inserted
into the initial ovum. In a small
percentage of cases, a pre-embryo
will be formed and will be allowed
to develop and produce stem cells.
At this point, the procedure is
identical to that used in adult
DNA cloning.
However, unlike in adult DNA
cloning, the pre-embryo is not im

planted in a woman's womb to
cause pregnancy. Stem cells are
removed from the pre-embryo, an
action that results in its death. The
stem cells are made to grow into
whatever tissue or organ is need
ed to treat the patient. The tissue
or organ could potentially be
transplanted into the patient.
If successful, this technique
could potentially replace the sys
tem of using organ transplants

that there will be no worry of fu

By the end of 2000, eight
species of mammals had been
cloned, including mice, cows,
rhesus monkeys, sheep, goats,
pigs and rats.

Almost every day, the media
presents debates on human
cloning, but often fails to educate
readers on the basic science be
hind the technique. In fact,
cloning is much more complicated
than they would lead us to believe.
There are three types of cloning
— embryo cloning, the therapeu
tic cloning and adult DNA cloning
— that often fall under the um
brella of cloning because of the
common scientific pathway they
follow. But each works towards
different goals.
Cloning is the creation of iden
tical cells from the same "parent"
cell. Identical here means geneti
cally identical to each other and to
their common ancestor. As a pro
cedure, cloning has been around
fora long time. For example,
when we buy roses from a floral
shop, the rose we buy is usually a
clone because it is genetically
identical to every other specimen.
One of the first instances of an
imal cloning was when re
searchers led by Prof. Gerald
Schatten of the Oregon Health
Sciences University split one Rhe
sus monkey embryo into four.
First, they fertilized an egg with
a sperm to produce a zygote, or a
single-celled embryo. After this zy
gote had grown into an 8-celled
embryo, it was divided into four 2-
celled embryos. Each of these was
then implanted into four monkey
mothers. Only one of the four em
bryos survived and was born 157

days later. She was named Tetra
after the Greek prefix for "four."
This type of cloning is called em
bryo cloning or "artificial twin
ning," because it simulates the
mechanism by which natural
twins develop.
In biological research, it is often
useful to have genetically identical
animals so that different experi
mental results can be attributed to
the factor being researched rather
than to genetic incompatibility.
The second type of cloning is
adult DNA cloning. The goal of
this technique is to produce a du
plicate of an existing animal. The
sheep Dolly was created with this
technique in 1997 by the embryol
ogist Dr. Lan Wilmut and his team
at the Roslin Institute.
In their experiment, a cell was
taken from the mammary tissue of
a mature 6-year-old sheep while
its DNA was in a dormant state. It
was fused with a sheep ovum that
had had its nucleus removed. The
"fertilized" cell was then stimulat
ed with an electric pulse.
Out of 277 attempts at cell fu
sion, only 29 progressed enough
to be implanted in ewes. Thirteen
became pregnant but only one
lamb, Dolly, was born.
The technique would work
similarly in humans. The DNA
from an ovum would be removed
and replaced with the DNA from
an adult individual. Then, the fer
tilized ovum, now called a pre-em
bryo, would be implanted in a
womb and allowed to develop into
a new human organism.

The third type of cloning is
therapeutic cloning. In this proce
dure, the DNA is removed from a
woman's ovum. The DNA from
another human cell is inserted
into the initial ovum. In a small
percentage of cases, a pre-embryo
will be formed and will be allowed
to develop and produce stem cells.
At this point, the procedure is
identical to that used in adult
DNA cloning.
However, unlike in adult DNA
cloning, the pre-embryo is not im

planted in a woman's womb to
cause pregnancy. Stem cells are
removed from the pre-embryo, an
action that results in its death. The
stem cells are made to grow into
whatever tissue or organ is need
ed to treat the patient. The tissue
or organ could potentially be
transplanted into the patient.
If successful, this technique
could potentially replace the sys
tem of using organ transplants

from other people. The new tissue

that there will be no worry of fu
ture rejection of the organ or tis
sue, as is currently the case.
By the end of 2000, eight
species of mammals had been
cloned, including mice, cows,
rhesus monkeys, sheep, goats,
pigs and rats.
