# Gene therapy not just skin deep
## New technique brings hope to those suffering from rare skin disease 
### RAVI GARG 
Recessive dystrophic epider
molysis bullosa, while not a deadly
disease, has still caused incredible
pain and suffering, especially
among children. Children who
suffer from RDEB have skin so
loose it tears even when they are
merely being lifted by a parent.
The disease weakens the con
nection between the outer and
under layers of skin, making it vul
nerable to friction. It causes severe
pain, infections, permanent
wounds, scarring and tissue de
struction in patients, according to
Michele Calos, associate professor
in dermatology at the Stanford
Medical School.
Calos and Associate Prof. Paul
Khavari lead a research team that
recently developed a technology
that uses a protein to implant
genes into skin cells diseased with
RDEB. The protein, called inte
grase, can insert the corrected
gene into a specific location of the
genetic sequence. It has been used
on grafts of mice skin, successfully
leading to the stable integration of

the corrective gene and normal,
healthy skin.
"We fonnd a way to put the
gene that is mutated in [RDEBj
back into human skin cells so that
it is active permanently and re
stores the missing gene product
and normalizes the skin," Calos
said.
In the past, according to Nature
Medicine journal, other methods
of DNA implantation such as using
vectors and plasmids have proven
less preferable, because DNA im
plantation using plasmids is not al
ways stable while DNA implanta
tion using viral vectors poses a po
tential biosafety threat.
Vectors are used to directly in
sert DNA into a patient's chromo
some. This has been done with
tumor suppressor genes and has
shown clinical success. Plasmids are
rings of DNA that can be implant
ed into a patient's genome to pro
vide fora missing gene.
On the other hand, the new
technique works by introducing a
copy of the correct Type-VII colla
gen gene into the cells of patients
that lack it. The integrase allows
the gene to combine into the
genome more stably than other
technologies allow for.
According to postdoctoral stu
dent Susana Ortiz-Urda, who
works in Khavari's lab, the

"(phi)C3l integrase mediates uni
directional and specific genomic
integration of plasmids containing
a special sequence. The integrase
does not integrate these plasmids
somewhere in the genome, but
only in specific few places."
The big advantage is that now
"we can achieve durable gene inte
gration without using viruses
which have biosafety and cost con
cerns," she said.
Calos, who has been working to
wards this goal over the past few
years., said that this discover)' "was
not accidental. We deliberately
sought a way to achieve putting a
gene back into a chromosome in a
known spot."
So far research has been con
fined to the lab and only tested on
mice, the eventual goal is to apply
the research to humans and con
tinue with pre-clinical studies to
determine other genetic diseases
the technology can be applied to.
The team believes that the new
gene therapy technique will have
applications to other diseases as
well. To show this, they published a
second article on other applica
tions of their gene therapy tech
nique in the November issue of Na
ture Biotechnology.
