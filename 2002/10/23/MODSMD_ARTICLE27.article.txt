## Baby boomers try to grasp MP3 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Since the
days of vinyl records, the music in
dustry has sold its goods in fickle
formats that have come and gone,
leaving obsolete record and tape
players moldering in basements
and thrift stores.
For baby boomers, the digital
sound files called MP3s are merely
the trend's newest incarnation.
"We're a generation that has
lived through so many modes of
experiencing music — from vinyl
to 8-track to CD to cassette and
reel-to-reel," said Melissa Easton,
38, an industrial designer who
lives in Manhattan's Chinatown.
"We're sick of changing our modes
of listening."
Still, Easton bought an Apple
iPod MP3 player, which she and
her husband use at home, on the
subway, in the car and in their
weekend home in theCatskills. If it
weren't for the iPod's superb de
sign and ease of use, Easton said
she'd never have fallen for it.
"I don't trust that the technolo
gy is going to stick around, so the
investment is something I'm reluc
tant to make," Easton said.
Most baby boomers, who range
in age from 38 to 56, haven't yet

taken the leap. According to a sur
vey by research firm Parks Associ
ates, 40 percent of Americans ages
45 to 54 with Internet access in
their homes have MP3s on their
hard drives.
That figure, although large,
lags the 81 percent of 18-to-24-
year-olds who have downloaded
MP3s.
But several converging factors
point to MP3 becoming a wide
spread — and perhaps persistent
— music format, despite the oppo
sition of the music industry, said
Phil Leigh, digital media analyst
with Raymond James & Associates
in St. Petersburg, Fla.
First, sales of CDs haven't in
creased for four years, a fact that
Leigh figures will push reluctant
music publishers to finally offer
online a larger portion of their cat
alogs as MP3s.
Second, the iPod has been a
coup for the format, its award-win
ning design and functionality at
tracting even skeptics like Easton.
Third, MP3 files are more
portable than any of the other
music formats.
"Labels and music publishers
are finally recognizing that this is a

trend," Leigh said. "It does look
like it's become the de facto for
mat. The labels recognize it's the
only way to go."
For baby boomers, download
ing free MP3s on KaZaA or Mor
pheus — an act of questionable
ethics and legality — isn't as attrac
tive as it is for younger users, who
may be hard up for cash, said 48-
year-old Bill Paige, an MP3 buff
who lives in Chicago.
Paige, like many others, simply
buy or borrow CDs and "rip" the
tracks they want.
Also, MP3 sites tend to come
and go. They require download
ing and installing their own soft
ware. And the quality of the tiles is
never consistent. Some down
loaded MP3 tracks sound notice
ably degraded. Others are inten
tionally cut short.
"A person my age isn't going to
hit a moving target like that.
They're just going to buy the CD,"
Paige said. "If some great MP3
subscription service came along
for $10 or $15 a month and you
had access to a huge store of tracks,
that might succeed."
