# Students protest new airport-screener laws
## 
### ANTHONY HA EDITORIAL STAFF 
As the Nov. 19 deadline to fed
eralize all airport screener posi
tions approaches, several Stanford
students are working with the Jus
tice for Screeners Committee to
protest the new regulations, which
senior Kuusela Hilo said will result
in a "mass layoff." Hilo and other
Stanford activists participated in a
rally at San Francisco Internation
al Airport on Saturday to demon
strate their solidarity with the
screeners.
At the top of protesters' com
plaints is a law signed by Presi
dent George W. Bush on Nov. 19

of last year. Under this law, all air
port screeners must be federal
employees, which means that
(hey must also be citizens of the
United States. The newly-estab
lished Transportation Security
Administration also requires that
screeners must pass an assess
ment test in order to re-apply for
their positions.
"The ISA is really the Termi
nating Security Administration,"
said Hilo, who is one of the Justice
for Screeners Committee's orga
nizers. "They're firing all of the
experienced screeners and replac
ing them with people who only

rity Act, all screeners must be U.S. citizens, making 55 percent of current SFO screeners ineligible.
have the bare minimum hours of
training."
Hilo said that because most
screeners are U.S. residents, not
citizens, 55 percent of them will
lose their positions under the new
law. She also criticized the assess
ment tests, particularly the seg
ment that tests the applicants' Eng
lish ability.
"All the screeners are fired, and
then they can reapply for their jobs
if they want," she said. "As a result,
the people to who have the most
experience are given the last
chance to apply."
She added, "The [English seg
ment] of the assessment test is
deeply flawed, because it relies on a
very subjective interpretation of
diction. I remember reading about
a class for screeners called 'Break

ing the Accent Barrier.' So white
accents guarantee security?"
According to Hilo, of the Oak
land Airport Screeners who reap
plied for their jobs, only 80 percent
passed the TSA assessment test.
"The TSA wasjust scrambling to
find someone to blame," she said.
"The security breach on 9/11
wasn't even at the checkpoints, so
clearly the screeners are just being
scapegoated."
Last Saturday morning, the
committee held a rally at SFO with
over 100 protesters — including
about a dozen Stanford students
— in attendance. The rally, which
Hilo said was held to spread public
awareness of the situation, lasted
from 8-10 a.m. and included
speakers, chants and a march
through the airport.
Senior Owen Li, chair of the
Asian American Students Associa
tion, was one of the Stanford stu
dents present.
"There were more people than

I expected on a Saturday morn
ing," he said. "I was also really sur
prised by how many people there
were youths — high schoolers and
college students."
Li described his role in the cam
paign as a supportive one and said
that it was important for students
to become involved.
"As Stanford students, we have a
unique opportunity and position,"
Li said. "We have a strong respon
sibility to the community to be con
scious of the struggles going on
around us."
Sophomore Sheila Laqui, who
was also at Saturday's rally, wrote a
research paper for her Program in
Writing and Rhetoric class last year
about the firing of the airport
screeners.
"This is just really unfair to
wards immigrant communities,"
Laqui said. "It's just blatant dis
crimination. I see it, and I think,
'Oh my God, why don't more peo
ple know about this?' "

Laqui added that she was
pleased and surprised at how in
volved Hilo has become in the ef
fort to prevent the firings. Hilo cur
rently splits her time between orga
nizing efforts in San Francisco and
her academic work on campus.
"I became aware of the new law
and its ramifications early this
year," Hilo said. "Then I was orga
nizing in the San Francisco this
summer, south of Market, and I
started to talk to people who said
that we need to start organizing to
support the screeners in SFO.
That's how the Justice for Screen
ers Committee got started."
Hilo added that more events
will take place as the deadline gets
closer. She pointed out that local
efforts have the larger goal of sway
ing Congress and the IS A.
"One of our goals is to make the
situation more publicly known,"
she said. "Concerned people
should contact TSA and ask them
to rethink their plans."

plied for their jobs, only 80 percent
passed the TSA assessment test.
"The TSA wasjust scrambling to
find someone to blame," she said.
"The security breach on 9/11
wasn't even at the checkpoints, so
clearly the screeners are just being
scapegoated."
Last Saturday morning, the
committee held a rally at SFO with
over 100 protesters — including
about a dozen Stanford students
— in attendance. The rally, which
Hilo said was held to spread public
awareness of the situation, lasted
from 8-10 a.m. and included
speakers, chants and a march
through the airport.
Senior Owen Li, chair of the
Asian American Students Associa
tion, was one of the Stanford stu
dents present.
"There were more people than

I expected on a Saturday morn
ing," he said. "I was also really sur
prised by how many people there
were youths — high schoolers and
college students."
Li described his role in the cam
paign as a supportive one and said
that it was important for students
to become involved.
"As Stanford students, we have a
unique opportunity and position,"
Li said. "We have a strong respon
sibility to the community to be con
scious of the struggles going on
around us."
Sophomore Sheila Laqui, who
was also at Saturday's rally, wrote a
research paper for her Program in
Writing and Rhetoric class last year
about the firing of the airport
screeners.
"This is just really unfair to
wards immigrant communities,"
Laqui said. "It's just blatant dis
crimination. I see it, and I think,
'Oh my God, why don't more peo
ple know about this?' "

Laqui added that she was
pleased and surprised at how in
volved Hilo has become in the ef
fort to prevent the firings. Hilo cur
rently splits her time between orga
nizing efforts in San Francisco and
her academic work on campus.
"I became aware of the new law
and its ramifications early this
year," Hilo said. "Then I was orga
nizing in the San Francisco this
summer, south of Market, and I
started to talk to people who said
that we need to start organizing to
support the screeners in SFO.
That's how the Justice for Screen
ers Committee got started."
Hilo added that more events
will take place as the deadline gets
closer. She pointed out that local
efforts have the larger goal of sway
ing Congress and the IS A.
"One of our goals is to make the
situation more publicly known,"
she said. "Concerned people
should contact TSA and ask them
to rethink their plans."
As the Nov. 19 deadline to fed
eralize all airport screener posi
tions approaches, several Stanford
students are working with the Jus
tice for Screeners Committee to
protest the new regulations, which
senior Kuusela Hilo said will result
in a "mass layoff." Hilo and other
Stanford activists participated in a
rally at San Francisco Internation
al Airport on Saturday to demon
strate their solidarity with the
screeners.
At the top of protesters' com
plaints is a law signed by Presi
dent George W. Bush on Nov. 19

of last year. Under this law, all air
port screeners must be federal
employees, which means that
(hey must also be citizens of the
United States. The newly-estab
lished Transportation Security
Administration also requires that
screeners must pass an assess
ment test in order to re-apply for
their positions.
"The ISA is really the Termi
nating Security Administration,"
said Hilo, who is one of the Justice
for Screeners Committee's orga
nizers. "They're firing all of the
experienced screeners and replac
ing them with people who only

rity Act, all screeners must be U.S. citizens, making 55 percent of current SFO screeners ineligible.
have the bare minimum hours of
training."
Hilo said that because most
screeners are U.S. residents, not
citizens, 55 percent of them will
lose their positions under the new
law. She also criticized the assess
ment tests, particularly the seg
ment that tests the applicants' Eng
lish ability.
"All the screeners are fired, and
then they can reapply for their jobs
if they want," she said. "As a result,
the people to who have the most
experience are given the last
chance to apply."
She added, "The [English seg
ment] of the assessment test is
deeply flawed, because it relies on a
very subjective interpretation of
diction. I remember reading about
a class for screeners called 'Break

ing the Accent Barrier.' So white
accents guarantee security?"
According to Hilo, of the Oak
land Airport Screeners who reap
plied for their jobs, only 80 percent
passed the TSA assessment test.
"The TSA wasjust scrambling to
find someone to blame," she said.
"The security breach on 9/11
