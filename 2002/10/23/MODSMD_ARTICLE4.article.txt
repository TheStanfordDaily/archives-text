Seventeen Magazine's recent October
issue ranked Stanford University as num
ber four in its feature story on the "Top 50
Coolest Colleges." Rice, Yale and Univer
sity of Texas-Austin placed ahead of Stan
ford. The magazine used criteria quite un
like those in most college guides to rank
Stanford so high.
"Stanford revels in its rep as the best of
the West, and even more important —
what other school can boast its own cam
pus mall!" the article said. "Stress relief is
big on this campus of notorious over
achievers: Students are aggressively casu
al, the most popular for-credit sport is
windsurfing, and almost 20 percent of
those who go on to graduate drop out for
a semester or two along the way (part of a
formal policy called 'stop-out')."
The magazine described the campus as
looking like an upscale taqueria, and
praised the warm weather, the suburban
setting that "feels secure" and the proxim
ity to San Francisco.
The magazine also included a picture
of bikini-clad bikers, noting "owning a
bike is practically required."

The University was even noted for the
quality of boys on campus. "As for boys —
ever see the hunks snapped in the tabloids
with Chelsea Clinton before she graduat
ed from here? Hope she left some for the
rest of us. Boy-girl ratio: 48:52."
In ranking the schools, academics
counted for 40 percent, "cool stuff like
shopping and nightlife" counted for 30
percent, financial aid counted for 20 per
cent, and issues of transportation and
dorm safety made up the remaining 10
percent.
The magazine also interviewed stu
dents and graduates at every school to see
the school from a girl's point of view, since
the magazine is targeted specifically at
teenage girls. On the survey, students
were interviewed about what they liked
and disliked about their respective col
leges.
Freshman Sarah Teng, however,
thinks the paragraph on Stanford is some
what inaccurate and misleading.
"The mall isn't even on campus," she
said. "And do you know anyone who
windsurfs? Because I sure don't. And

would you really pick a college
based on what the boys look like
there or how close it is to a mall?"
Other students believe that the
article is an accurate portrayal of
Stanford.
Freshman Lance Cidre said, "I
think it's pretty accurate, espe
cially the 'aggressively casual'
part. . . like me."
