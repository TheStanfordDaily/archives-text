# Golf-cart heists rise on campus
## 
### WHITNEY SADO 
At Full Moon on the Quad on Monday night, an in
jured Stanford student left his crutches in the golf cart
he uses to get around campus and parked the cart by
the Quad. When he returned from the revelry, the
crutches were on the ground, and the golf cart was
missing. The c art was found later that morning, being
driven down Embarcadero by two local kids.
Stanford students may also be linked to the theft.
The case is currently being investigated.
This is just one example of the recent trend of on
campus golf-cart theft. Thousands of dollars worth of
golf carts have been stolen in the past six months. Both
students and outsiders are believed to be at fault.

A golf cart sits idle on campus. In the past six months,
thousands of dollars worth of carts have been stolen. Al
though no students have been arrested, both students
and outsiders are believed responsible.
