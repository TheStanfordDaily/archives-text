# Golf-cart heists rise on campus
## 
### WHITNEY SADO 
At Full Moon on the Quad on Monday night, an in
jured Stanford student left his crutches in the golf cart
he uses to get around campus and parked the cart by
the Quad. When he returned from the revelry, the
crutches were on the ground, and the golf cart was
missing. The c art was found later that morning, being
driven down Embarcadero by two local kids.
Stanford students may also be linked to the theft.
The case is currently being investigated.
This is just one example of the recent trend of on
campus golf-cart theft. Thousands of dollars worth of
golf carts have been stolen in the past six months. Both
students and outsiders are believed to be at fault.

A golf cart sits idle on campus. In the past six months,
thousands of dollars worth of carts have been stolen. Al
though no students have been arrested, both students
and outsiders are believed responsible.
Much of the theft occurred dur
ing campus summer programs, in
cluding camps, according to Lieu
tenant Hilary Karp, public rela
tions representative for the Depart
ment of Public Safety.
"The rise in theft is attributable
to the summer months, although
these thefts certainly occur periodi
cally throughout the school year as
well," he said.
Some of the stolen golf carts be
long to the University, while others
are owned by individual students.
Students may rent out carts from
private companies for weekly fees
ranging from $100 to $fB5 per
week. Student use of golf carts for
personal transportation is prohibit
ed on campus unless the student is
injured or disabled.
The University owns many golf

carts for administrative and safety
purposes. Students may not indi
vidually use these carts, although
they may arrange to receive free
transportation from them.
Lindsey Cox, a senior who
bought a used golf cart for use dur
ing her sophomore year due to a
back surgery, said she never had a
problem with theft.
"Just using a chain and lock was
pretty effective for me," she said,
though she acknowledgetl that the
problem of theft was not so wide
spread then.
"Stealing a golf cart is just like
stealing a car," Karp pointed out,
referring to section 10851 of the
California code, which also does not
differentiate between the intent of
permanently or temporarily taking
a vehicle. Thus, what many stu
dents believe is merely borrowing is
in fact vehicle theft.
Penalties for golf cart theft may
include up to a $5,000 fine and a
year in prison.
