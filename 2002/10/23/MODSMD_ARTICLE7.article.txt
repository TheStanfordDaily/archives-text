# Doctoral student runs for congressional seat
## 28 year old says that platform will address ideas often ignored by politicians and the media 
### ANDREW HENDEL 
Many students at Stanford are politically active
on campus, and some even aspire to work for the
government some day, but 28-year-old Andrew
Carver is not content to wait until graduation to
become involved in national politics.
Carver, a fourth-year management science
and engineering doctoral student, is running lor
Congress in the 14th district of California as the
Libertarian candidate.
Carver asserts that his platform, which is so
cially liberal and financially conservative, will
bring to light ideas that are often ignored by
politicians and the media. Among the main issues
that Carver supports are states' rights, lower
taxes, abortion rights and the legalization of
drugs and prostitution.
Carver said he is targeting issues neither the
Democratic nor the Republican parties are will
ing to focus on because they are too politically
risky. Carver said he believes the Libertarian
Party is a viable alternative to the two main par
ties, merging what he believes are their better is
sues.
"It's kind of unfortunate how the country is di
vided the way it is because you have Democrats
on one hand, who are more open minded, gen
erally speaking, but they like to tax and spend.
Then you have the Republicans who like to blow
things up," Carver said.
According to Carver, the Libertarian position
appeals to people because it promotes individual
freedom, allowing people to make important de
cisions about their own life without involving the
government.
Carver argues that one such issue in which the
government imposes its moral and ethical views
is in its drug policy. In this case, he continues, gov

ernment involvement has negative conse
quences.
"In my opinion [the war on drugs] is the most
destructive piece of domestic policy that the Unit
ed States has," Carver said. "There are few politi
cians that will ever say, 'we need to end the war on
drugs.'"
"If the media and the candidates would focus
on this and highlight the fact that there are almost
a million nonviolent offenders in jail at the cost of
$40,000 apiece; at a cost of half of our police ac
tivity enforcing nonviolent charges; at a cost of
our justice system running these people through;
at a cost of funneling tons of money into criminal
minds; at a cost of funneling tons of money into
terrorist groups; at the cost of destabilizing the
government of Columbia, [policy might
change]," he added.
Carver sees the current war on drugs akin to
Prohibition. Regulation is fruitless, he reasons,
because it only drives up the price of drugs and
increases organized crime.
Since Carver targets drugs as the major source
of crime and violence, he said that there is no
good reason to illegalize gun sales. According to
Carver, drugs — not guns — kill people.
"Going after gun makers is not going to stop
violence," he said. "I support the bill of rights
which gives people die right to own guns. I feel
very strongly that if we live in a country in which
the only people who have guns are the govern
ment, that's a very dangerous situation."
Although he admitted that the current United
States government is no real threat at the mo
ment, he said that in the future, the right to bear
arms might serve as a necessary check to the gov
ernment's power. Outlawing guns, he continued,
will not prevent gun sales, just as outlawing drugs
has not prevented their usage.
Carver said that prostitution, like the sale of
drugs, should be legalized for the same reasons.
According to Carver, restricting these activities
only aids criminals.
"There is no reason why sex should be illegal
to sell," Carver said. "It's sad because if you want

to be a prostitute now there's no way to get pro
tection from the law. There is no way to run a le
gitimate business and provide a safe environment
for people to get this service.
"As a result it's been driven underground, and
people who are in the sex business need to hire vi
olent people to protect them, pimps and things
like that, so again it creates a culture of criminal
activity," he added.
In terms of foreign policy, Carver said that
he opposes active participation in the rest of
the world because it involves the United States
in issues that are not in the best interest of the
country. Giving aid to foreign countries, he ar
gued, makes enemies where no enemies need
to be made.
Carver said he believes that special interest
groups influence the government in a negative
manner, forcing government involvement.
"We have special interest groups like the Jew
ish lobby that push foreign policy in one direction
to the disadvantage of the general populace,"
Carver said. "We're putting ourselves in danger."
"That [terrorists are waging war against
democracy] is propaganda thrown out by the
president," he continued. "The idea that [9/11] is
an attack on freedom, that's silly."
Carver will be running in District 14, which in
cludes Stanford. Any students who reregistered
should expect to see his name on the ballot next
to Democratic incumbent Anna Eshoo and Re
publican contender Joe Nixon.
Carver said that he expects to get 2-3 percent
of the vote, but that is not a problem since his cam
paign is more about spreading a message than
winning the election.
He cites his status as a third-party candidate
and his lack of funding as the main reasons con
tributing to his poor standings in the polls. Carv
er spent about $1,000 of his own money to fund
his campaign, issuing "Vote for Andrew Carver"
t-shirts along with a Web site that he pro
grammed himself.
Another limiting factor, Carver
argued, is that he is not a career
politician and must split his time
between his campaign and his stud
ies. Carver received a bachelor's in
mechanical engineering and eco
nomics from Duke University and
a master's in management science
and engineering from Stanford.
He worked at AXA Rosenberg In
vestment Management and Eli
Lilly Pharmaceuticals and served as
Vice President at Bank of America,
where he managed portfolios of
currency options.
He said he got involved in poli
tics in order to spread ideas that nei
ther the Republican nor the Demo
cratic parties adopted.
"I wanted to do it because in the
whole scheme of your life you have
to be involved in something mean
ingful," he said.
