## Death possibly linked to sniper 
### 
ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) — A bus dri
ver was shot to death yesterday as he was
about to set out on his morning route in
what authorities fear was the 13th attack
by the Washington-area sniper. Police
also revealed a chilling warning found at
a weekend shooting scene: "Your chil
dren are not safe anywhere at any time."
Montgomery County Police Chief
Charles Moose issued a new plea, urging
the gunman to continue a dialogue with
investigators.
"It is important that we do this without
anyone else getting hurt," he said.
In an extraordinary statement that ap
peared to confirm authorities are in a
desperate parley to stop the killing, the
police chief said the sniper had tried to
communicate with police over the past
several days — and he suggested the gun
man had made demands.
"We have researched the options you
stated and found that it is not possible
electronically to comply in the manner
that you requested," Moose said in a cryp
tic message directed at the sniper, and the

most extensive so far. "However, we re
main open and ready to talk to you about
the options you have mentioned."
He said the sniper was seeking an 800
telephone number to talk with authori
ties, and he offered to set up a private post
office box "or another secure method."
"You indicated that this is about more
than violence," said Moose, who had
asked the sniper to contact authorities for
two days before yesterday's slaying. "We
are waiting to hear from you."
He refused to take questions from re
porters.
Earlier, Moose suggested police had
received a new message from the killer.
According to a source familiar with the
case, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, that message was received
after yesterday's shooting.
The sniper has killed nine people and
critically wounded three others in Mary
land, Virginia and Washington since Oct.
2. Authorities were awaiting ballistics tests
to confirm that bus driver Conrad John
son is the killer's latest victim.

Johnson, 35, was gunned down in
Aspen Hill, the same community in sub
urban Washington where the attacks
began.
He was shot once in the abdomen just
before 6 a.m. as he stood on the top step of
his bus, setting off a police dragnet and
snarling traffic in the suburbs north of the
nation's capital. Johnson, a married father
of two children, died later at a hospital.
The warning about children's safety
was discovered by police outside a steak
house near Richmond, Va., where the
sniper critically wounded a man Satur
day night. Moose said the warning came
in the form of a "postscript," but refused
to describe the rest of the note.
However, a senior law enforcement of
ficial speaking to The Associated Press on
condition of anonymity said the note de
manded $10 million. It was unclear
whether the demand was linked to the
options outlined by Moose.
Schools in the Richmond area re
mained closed fora second day yester
day, idling more than 140,000 students.
