U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY TO PREPARE/SEEK PUBLIC COMMENT ON
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT FOR THE LINAC COHERENT LIGHT SOURCE AT
THE STANFORD LINEAR ACCELERATOR CENTER
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Security Administration NNSA) Oakland
Operations Office (OAK) announces the availability of a draft environmental assessment for the Linac
Coherent Light Source (LCLS) Project at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), California.
The DOE proposes to construct the LCLS at SLAC. The LCLS would be the world's first x-ray free elec
tron laser (FEL) that would produce x-ray laser pulses that are billions of times more intense than those
from existing synchrotron sources. The LCLS would take advantage of the existing infrastructure at SLAC
and would install a new photoinjector at sector 20 of the 30 sector linear accelerator (linac), the last
kilometer of the linac would be modified to accelerate the electrons to be used in the LCLS. A 120 meter
long undulator magnet would be fabricated and installed in the existing Final Focus Test Beam facility
and two new experimental halls would be constructed. The LCLS would further DOE's mission of plan
ning, constructing, and operating user facilities to provide special scientific and research capabilities to
serve the needs of U.S. universities, industry, and Federal laboratories. The alternatives considered to
the proposed action are: (1) no action; (2) siting LCLS at an alternative SLAC location; and, (3) siting
LCLS at another DOE site. Under the no-action alternative, DOE would not construct the LCLS at SLAC
and the short-term impacts associated with the construction and on-site traffic congestion would not
occur. However, the no-action alternative would not meet DOE's mission and need. Under the second
alternative, DOE would construct the LCLS at an alternate SLAC location. Construction impacts, poten
tial environmental impacts, and additional costs associated with Alternative 2 would be greater than
those of the proposed action. Under the third alternative, DOE would construct the LCLS at another DOE
site. Construction and potential environmental impacts would be greater than the proposed action
because a new electron linear accelerator would have to be constructed for the LCLS, which would also
increase the cost.
DOE is seeking public comment on the draft environmental assessment during a 30-day comment peri
od. Written comments should be sent by November 8, 2002 to: Mr. Hanley Lee, DCE NEPA Document
Manager, U.S. Department of Energy, Stanford Site Office, M/S BA, 2575 Sand Hill Road, Menlo Park, CA
94025 or sent via e-mail to hanley.lee@oak.doe.gov, or by fax to (650) 926-3210.

Tower, Room 180N, 1301 Clay Street, Oakland, CA, (510) 637-1762.
