New Frosh Council born
Members of this year's new Frosh Council have recently been
elected by dorms with frosh residents and are already planning
freshman-class events for this year.
"This group of approximately 40 frosh (one for every 40 frosh
in the class) will be advised by me and will meet weekly to plan
events for the freshman class," said Julie Lythcott-Haims, the as
sistant vice provost for student affairs and dean of freshman and
transfer students. "Past Councils have put on formals, trips and
other social events, and have coordinated student participation
in the Frosh Thank-A-Thon, where frosh call alumni who have
donated to the Stanford Fund for Undergraduate Education, just
to thank them."
According to Lythcott-Haims, four sophomores who were last
year's Frosh Council Representatives lead the Frosh Council. This
year's council has already planned its first event, Frosh Formal,
which will be held this Friday at the Alumni Center.
Charity event races toward affordable housing

Habitat for Humanity and Silicon Light Machines will host their
11th Annual Home Run Charity Event. This event, which includes
a 5-kilometer race at 9 a.m., a 10-kilometer race at 9:30 a.m. and an
awards ceremony at 11 a.m., will support the construction of af
fordable housing on the Peninsula.
"Nearly 1,000 Silicon Valley running enthusiasts will participate
in 5K and 10K runs and a 5K walk to support the construction of af
fordable housing on the Peninsula," said Molly Mulloy of Silicon
Light Machines, which is sponsoring this event. "Silicon Light Ma
chines will match the donation of any Silicon Valley technology
company's team that beats its team of runners. Proceeds of the race
will benefit the Peninsula and Silicon Valley chapters of Habitat for
Humanity and Global Partners for Development."
There will also be interview opportunities with Tom Werner,
the CEO of Silicon Light Machines, and two representatives for
Habitat for Humanity, including Srinivas Panguluri, the co-pres
ident of the Stanford chapter, and Dave Ahn from the Silicon Val
ley chapter.
According to Mulloy, the Home Run event has raised more than
$120,000 since it was started in 1983, and The Association of Bay
Area Government projects that 16,305 additional housing units will
be needed by 2006, 4,781 of which are needed for low- and very
low-income residents.

Fhe Office for Religious Life and the Associated Students at Stan
ford University are sponsoring a series called "What Matters to Me
and Why," which gives empathetic and curious ears opportunities
to listen to speakers describe what they find important in life based

and Why" series with a talk about group dynamics, stereotypes and
his parents, whom he identified as the key influence in shaping his
values. This week's speaker was Luis Fraga, associate professor of
political science.
