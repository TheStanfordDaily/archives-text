## Warrant issued in sniper case 
### 
TACOMA, Wash. (AP) —The search for the serial
sniper jumped across the country yesterday as FBI
agents converged on a home in Tacoma with metal
detectors and chain saws. A U.S. official in Washing
ton said authorities were looking for two "people of
interest" — one of them formerly connected to Fort
Lewis, an Army base south of Tacoma.
Police also disclosed late yesterday that an arrest
warrant has been issued fora 42-year-old man they
believe has information about the string of terrifying
shootings that have left 10 people dead in the Wash
ington suburbs.
Montgomery County Police Chief Charles Moose
said the man, John Allen Mohammed, should be con
sidered "armed and dangerous" and that he was
being sought on a federal weapons charge.
Agents in Tacoma, acting on information from the
sniper task force based in Maryland, were seeking ev
idence at a rental home related to ammunition, a se
nior law enforcement official in Washington said on
condition of anonymity.
Lt. Col. Joseph Piek, a spokesman at Fort Lewis,
said the FBI had asked for help from the base, which
provides some of the most intense sniper training in
the U.S. military. He said he could not confirm TV re
ports t hat a Fort Lewis soldier may have been a tenant
at the home.
FBI agents also visited Bellingham High School,
90 miles north of Seattle, yesterday. Mayor Mark As
mundson told the Bellingham Herald the agents
were apparently seeking information on a male
teenager who once attended the school and on an
older man. He said both left the area about nine
months ago.
The flurry of activity raised hopes that investiga
tors had a lead in the shooting spree that has left 10
people dead and three others critically wounded in
and around the nation's capital since Oct. 2.
FBI spokeswoman Melissa Mallon said the search
was consented to by the property owner, but refused
to say why agents were there.
