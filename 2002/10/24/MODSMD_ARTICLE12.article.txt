Measure includes $7.4
billion to further develop
missile defense system
WASHINGTON (AP) — President
Bush signed into law yesterday the
biggest military spending increase
since Ronald Reagan's administration
— a $355.5 billion package giving the
wartime Pentagon "every resource,
every weapon and every tool they
need."
Overwhelmingly approved by Con
gress, the measure contains a 4.1 per
cent salary increase for military person
nel, $7.4 billion to keep developing a
ballistic missile defense system and $72
billion for new weapons.
With the president contemplating
war against Iraq, and U.S. troops in
volved in an anti-terror campaign
across the globe, the law increases Pen
tagon spending in almost every area for
the budget year that began Oct. 1 by a
total of more than $34 billion, or 11

percent, over the previous year. It was
the biggest increase in 20 years.
"Since September 11, Americans
have been reminded that the safety of
many depends on the courage and
skill of a few," Bush told a Rose Gar
den audience filled with uniformed
military personnel and lawmakers
from both parties.
"The bill today says America is de
termined and resolute to not only de
fend our freedom but to defend free
dom around the world, that we're de
termined and resolute to answer the
call to history and that we will defeat
terror."
He also signed a $10.5 billion bill fi
nancing the building and upgrading of
military installations in fiscal 2003.
While Congress gave Bush most of
what he requested, lawmakers rejected
his plea fora $10 billion fund he could
tap without congressional input for
combating terrorists overseas.
In a statement later in the clay,
Bush said he was disappointed by that
decision and another to approve $2.7

billion less than he wanted for opera
tions and maintenance programs.
"Without these funds, we may he
forced to reduce other important pro
grams to finance the war on terror

ism," Bush said.
There was a tinge of politics in the
bill signing less than two weeks before
elections that will decide which party
controls Congress.
