# Chechen rebels hold hostages in Moscow theater
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) —At least 40 armed
Chechen rebels stormed a crowded
theater and took hundreds of people
hostage in the midst of a musical,
threatening early today to shoot their
captives and blow up the building if
Russian security forces attacked.
Several hours after the rebels
rushed the theater, firing automatic
weapons, they began communicating
with Russian officials by cell phone.
The hostage-takers demanded that
Russia end the war in Chechnya, a

southern region where the army is
fighting Islamic separatists.
Some hostages released by the gun
men reported seeing pools of blood.
But there was no confirmation of casu
alties at the theater in a working-class
neighborhood of southeastern Moscow,
about three miles from Red Square.
Fhe rebels had automatic weapons,
grenades, belts with explosives at
tached, mines and canisters of gasoline,
lawmaker Yuli Rybakov said outside
the theater. There was little water or

food inside, he said. The raid occurred
in wet, freezing weather.
The gunmen told national parlia
ment member Aslanbek Aslakhanov
from Chechnya, who was serving as a
mediator, that they wanted Russian
troops to withdraw from Chechnya and
implement a cease-fire, he said. A pro
rebel Web site said Russia had seven
days to begin its withdrawal or the the
ater and hostages would be blown up.
The raid brought home to the very
heart of Russia a war seen as far-off by

many Russians despite a growing num
ber of military and civilian casualties.
The Russian military has been especial
ly tough on rebels, but several hostages,
speaking by cell phone to Russian re
porters, appealed to security forces not
to use force in the Moscow siege.
Russian security forces do not in
tend to storm the building unless the
hostage-takers start killing their cap
tives, said Gennady Gudkov, deputy
chairman of the parliamentary Com
mittee on Security.
