## The 						Stanford Daily ASSU sends a strong message in its refusal to comment 
### 
An unexpected result of the living wage
campaign's efforts has been the recogni
tion of the inadequacy of student and
stakeholder involvement in the formula
tion of University policies that affect them directly.
This inadequacy was made most evident by the re
cent wish from the Office of University President
John Hennessy to the ASSU to issue a statement re
garding the former's proposed living wage policy.
t he ASSU Undergraduate Senate and the Grad
uate Student Council, in their refusal to comment on
the president's proposal, have thereby given it a vote
of no confidence, citing the lack of involvement by
students and stakeholders in the early stages of the
decision-making process.
We believe the Undergraduate Senate and the
Graduate Student Council are correct in their re
sponse to the policy as delivered by President Hen
nessy's Office. Students' and stakeholders' voices
should not be resigned to the final stages of Univer
sity policy dialogue. As the only constitutionally legit
imate student representative body, the ASSU has the

Published Sihce J 891

burden to assure that students are properly repre
sented in all University matters that relate to them.
Therefore the ASSU, itself not an exclusionary body,
is correct to not affirm an exclusionary process.
While we commend President Hennessy's Office
for crafting a living wage proposal, we find the pro
cess by which the document was produced worthy of
repudiation. We concur with the Faculty Senate, in
cluding Prof. Eamonn Callan, who indicated the
proposal did not contain sufficient detail for making
a judicious decision. Prof. Thomas MaCurdy, like
wise, was correct in noting that a living wage relates
to the economics of a worker's individual household,
not the firm or the institution. Both Callan and
MaCurdy illuminate subtler points, namely the na
ture of the information still missing, and where to
find that information.
The take home message for the President's Office
should be clear: Student and stakeholder involve
ment in University decision-making processes is
strikingly deficient.
Attempts to make decisions by such deficient

processes have a history of creating a culture of
foul communication on campus. In recent years,
prominent student demonstrations, in areas as di
verse as graduate student health care coverage
and the acceptance of a living wage policy, were
precipitated when communication between the
President's Office and students was denied, mis
handled or allowed to break down. Such demon
strations have caused many to mistrust the Uni
versity: Outsiders wondered how such a collection
of talent could remain unengaged while decisions
were made on their behalf by obscure committees.
ASSU President Monica Henestroza and others
seem fond of mentioning their purportedly regular
communication with President Hennessy's Office. In
light of this unanimous rejection of Hennessy's living
wage proposal, the question arises whether ASSU
leaders such as Henestroza will leverage their access
into actual student participation in University deci
sion-making processes.

mission committee to discuss living wage matters.
We believe such a committee is a first step to prop
erly institutionalizing the work of students and
stakeholders, and creating a process for each to be
freely heard.
The time has come for the living wage debate to
join ranks with other issues that rightfully occupy
University attention like acts of intolerance, minority
alumni outreach and graduate student quality of life,
'fhe ASSU must fulfill its role in giving legitimacy to
these critical areas, as they are advanced, in the cam
pus dialogue, and cannot neglect its duty to get the
right people communicating with one another.
The President's Office has been criticized often
for its lack of communication and contact with stu
dents. The response by the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate and the Graduate Student Council to the
President's Office living wage proposal is a due con
sequence of the failure of Hennessy and his staff to
include the parties of greatest interest in University
decision-making.
