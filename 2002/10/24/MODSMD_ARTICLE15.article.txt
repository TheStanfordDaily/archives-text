# THE 						MINISTRY OF TRUTH
## In defense of George Bush 
### 
This evening I followed a link at The
Onion online to a site which has
culled many of President Bush's
malapropisms into a calendar. I have to
admit, many of the quotes sound hilarious
in an utterly decontexualized medium.
There are apparent contradictions, awk
ward phrasings, imperfect grammar —
things which, I might add, checker most
unrehearsed speech.
The litany of quotes hearkens back to
the indictment of Dan Quayle's intellect
over a decade ago, and, like the assault on
Quayle, these quotes are reproduced in
text, a stark medium which cannot capture
the nuances of an actual human voice.
So I chuckled as I scrolled through the

assembled quotes until I
reached one in particular
that piqued my curiosity.
It was not an instance of
misspeaking, but rather
an answer to a question
about something he was
"not good at."
"Sitting down and
reading a 500-page book

on public policy or philosophy or some
thing," Bush replied.
The Web site does not take an overt par
tisan stance, but the suggestion that this is in
some manner funny falls in line with liber
als' conviction that our president is simply
not smart enough for them.
Never mind that reading 500-page
books may not be the most productive way
for the leader of the free world to spend his
time (although perhaps the left's treasured
Clinton found plenty of time to cultivate his
intellect while ignoring portentous terrorist
activity, debauching interns and abusing
executive power).
Never mind that American politics, un
like the Utopian experiments of some Eu
ropean nations, are not founded on intel
lectual sophistry but on basic, unequivocal
rights. Indeed, I'd prefer that my president
shelve Plato or Marx in order to deal with
the real problems our nation faces.
In the beginning, the liberal elite's foil to
the image of a philistine cowboy/ fratboy
that they cultivated for Bush was, of course,
the lame automaton A1 Gore. Questions
about Bush's intellectual qualifications
were repeatedly posed by pundits; mean
while, Gore became a media darling for his
perceived Clintonian eloquence.
Even after nearly two years of scrupu
lous service, the assault on Bush's intellect
has not subsided. Jon Stewart, host of Com
edy Central's "The Daily Show," has taken
to showing Bushisms out of context then
simply smirking knowingly, as if the brief
video segments were hilarious in and of
themselves. No wry commentary from
Stewart, the arch ironist. Just the implicit
message: Bush is dumb.
Nothing ever seems to be good enough
for the liberal intellectual elite. It may be
difficult for many Stanford undergrads to
remember, but in our infancy the president
was a man dubbed the "Great Communica

tor." Ronald Reagan, a former film actor
(and former Democrat), became one of the
most popular presidents in history by win
ning the Cold War and overseeing un
precedented economic prosperity, but also
by projecting, wittingly or not, the image of
a trustworthy everyday guy. Perhaps more
than any other president before or since,
Ronald Reagan could have been your next
door neighbor.
But despite Reagan's incomparable abil
ity to communicate his vision in landmark
speeches (such as his "March of Freedom"
address to the British House of Commons
or his exhortation to Gorbachev: "Tear
down this wall.") liberals repeatedly ques
tioned his competence. Reagan was called
an "amiable dunce" with a "fuzzyheaded
political ideology" dispensing "dumb slo
gans." Because his speech was infallible and
his charisma so strong, the focus of these at
tacks was Reagan's perceived simple-mind
edness (and later, his suspected dotage).
Whether the president struggles to
speak well or talks with effortless euphony,
if he is a Republican, liberal intellectuals ap
pear to deem him incompetent by default.
The attacks often depict our conservative
leaders as narrow-minded, uninspired and
intellectually incurious. Faux-intelligentsia
like Bill Maher and Jon Stewart seize every
opportunity to ridicule them.
It is not merely American media who
censure Bush. Last night a cable news net
work played footage of Germans condemn
ing the president's foreign policy. One of
them called Bush a "cowboy." The man
seemed to be suggesting that Bush exhibits
an unhealthy penchant for conflict. Inten
tionally or not, he was invoking the West
ern archetype — the gutsy, righteous, gun
slinging hero.
The analogy was delivered in a critical
vein, but I wonder: Is the American cow
boy really such an unfavorable icon? He is
unaffected, self-reliant and unafraid of
acting alone (as indeed the U.S. might
have to act to eliminate the threat of Sad
dam Hussein). He is the knight-errant of
Arthurian legend, stripped of courtly pre
tense; perhaps it is precisely this pragmat
ic approach to politics and diplomacy
which troubles the insensible sophists
among our European allies.
George W. Bush is not the philosopher
king of classical imagination. So what? Like
many other competent politicians, he cut
his teeth in the private sector, not in the
ivory tower of some elitist university.
He has demonstrated incontestable skill
in assembling and managing a highly expe
rienced and respected cabinet. That this
cabinet has not expressed a consensus on
the issue of Iraq is a testament to the fact
that he did not stock his staff with syco
phants, but with independent-thinking,
conscientious men and woman.
Bush exhibited true, fine leadership in
perhaps our nation's direst hour. His un
hurried Texas drawl belies his Yale and

Harvard education. He loves base
ball. He has a sense of humor. And
God help him, he does not speak
with Clinton's polish. But he is en
tirely American.
And he's your president.
