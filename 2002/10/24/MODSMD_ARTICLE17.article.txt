Decision to sign petition 'was an individu
al one'
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate
would like to briefly address some of the
points raised in Henry Towsner's letter to
the editor regarding the constitutional
case surrounding the release of Stanford
Student Enterprises' financial records.
First, the decision of whether or not to
sign the petition was an individual one.
Each of us, those who signed and those who
did not sign, had a distinct reason for doing
so. We each made our decisions based on
our knowledge of the ASSU governing doc
uments, as well as the Constitutional merits
of the case.
The diversity of opinion in the Senate on
the issue reflects the diversity of the Senate
and the diversity of the students we repre
sent — not a desire to "manipulate the
court system."
Second, there were a number of other
means by which The Stanford Review and
The Stanford Daily could have had their
case heard had they not received five Sena
torial signatures.
They could have petitioned the Grad
uate Student Council to obtain five sig
natures from GSC members. They could
have also petitioned the President and
Vice President of the Association to ob
tain the same result.
Even if elected officials failed to sign the
petition, they could have obtained signa
tures from five percent of either the under
graduate or graduate student population
(approximately 332 or 395 respectively) to
have their case heard by the Council.
Finally, the fact of the matter is that this
case is going forward to the Constitutional
Council. Fhe Stanford Review and The
Stanford Daily received the five required
signatures by approaching the Undergrad
uate Senate. The petitioners received what
they wanted — a hearing before the Con

stitutional Council on the matter.

Student responds to 'the lack of diversity'
in Full Moon pictures
I'm writing to express my disappoint
ment in the lack of diversity shown in The
Daily's front page photo spread on Oct. 22
of people making out at Full Moon. Specif
ically, the rather pronounced lack of
Asian-American men in the photos. While
I know it's hard to put together something
that can represent true campus diversity
(and people's definitions differ as well), I
don't believe it's truly that difficult to find
an Asian guy making out on campus,
much less at Full Moon. Now I'm not affil
iated with AASA or any other similar
group, and personally, I thought the
Abercrombie shirts ("Wong's Laundry")
were funny as hell.
But I do know as well as anyone that
any kind of media, even a local campus
newspaper, can deeply influence how we
view each other, especially on matters of
race. We can't change the fact that there's
a stereotype of Asian men being sexless or
passive, but it's irresponsible for some
thing as widespread as The Daily to play
into it. The truth is, Asian guys were out
there at Full Moon getting as much play as
anyone else, and they'll be at everything
else, doing exactly that.

Baraka's praisers 'should be ashamed'
In Tuesday's editorial, The Daily prais
es Stanford's support of diverse views and
"opinions" expressed by on-campus
speakers, particularly recent talks by for

mer Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
and poet Amiri Baraka.
The editorial begins by explaining the
different views of world events present
ed by the two speakers, taking a stanza of
one of Baraka's poems as an example of
his opinions. "Who knew the World
Trade Center was gonna get bombed /
Who told 4,000 Israeli workers at the
Twin Towers / To stay home that day /
Why did Sharon stay away?"
For The Daily to liken this blatant anti-
Semitic lie to opinions on world events is
ludicrous. It is one thing for someone to
proclaim their hate at a rally or a protest, it
is another for The Daily or the University
to endorse such speech.
The Stanford University I know does
not tolerate hate of any kind. Stanford,
The Daily and President Hennessy, who
praised Baraka's presence in a recent let
ter to The Daily, should be ashamed.
