# NATIONAL VIEWPOINT
## Our nation's challenges and your generation's mission 
### TOM DASCHLE GUEST COLUMNIST 
In 1968,1 sat in a car with three friends
and drove for hours to hear Robert
Kennedy speak. We had no air condition
ing, our quarters were cramped, and we
were running late, with no time to get out
and stretch our legs.
On the drive back not one of us doubt
ed that the trip had been worth every mile
of discomfort. That speech, and others like
it, helped clarify the challenges that faced
my country and my generation, and
helped convince me that I could make a
difference. The course that had first been
plotted with John F. Kennedy's election
had finally led me, and many other mem
bers of my generation, to the realization
that we had to take an active role in ad
dressing the problems of our world.
I believe your generation's mission
came into greater focus on Sept. 1 1, 2001.
The events of that tragic day shocked and
horrified us all, causing an entire nation to

wonder how this could have happened,
and what we could do to help in its after
math. Sept. 11 also gave a new generation
cause to wonder what differences they
could make in the future of our country
and our world.
I'he unity and sense of common pur
pose that swept the country created an
opportunity to strengthen our nation in
every sense of the word by working to
gether to promote real, positive change.
If the only lasting change in our behav
ior is our willingness to arrive at the air
port earlier, we will have failed to seize
that opportunity.
Every elected official, Democrat and
Republican, understands that the safety
and security of the American people is our
first responsibility. Democrats, however,
also understand that the challenges we
face go beyond national security and
homeland security. They involve the pro
tection of the quality of our air and water,
help in affording college tuition, the type
of jobs and the strength of the economy

waiting for you when yon graduate, the
status of women's rights and workers'
rights and civil rights, the integrity of our
system of capitalism, and the future we're
building for today's seniors and tomor
row's workers.
Some of you are helping to meet these
challenges already, by volunteering your
time, by organizing campus events or by
mentoring neighborhood children. For
all that you do, however, there is one
simple activity which can influence ev
erything else. You can exercise your
right to vote.
1 was first elected to Congress by 14
votes out of quarter of a million votes
cast, so I know in a very personal way
how much every vote counts. In the
2000 presidential race, the whole coun
try learned how breathtakingly impor
tant just a few votes can be. And this
year, your vote could be the one that
tips the balance of power in Congress
and defines the direction of our nation
al policy agenda.

I would argue that, during the past
year, Democrats have used our majority in
the Senate to enact positive change, and to
keep inadequate and even harmful legisla
tion from slowing our national progress.
We have passed tough accounting reform
to guarantee accountability in our nation's
largest corporations. We have also enacted
real election reform, passed a bill that in
vests in renewable sources of energy, and
made real progress on lowering the cost of
prescription drugs.
We have also prevented drilling in the
protected Alaskan wilderness, and
blocked a policy that would prevent stu
dents who have several student loans from
consolidating them into one loan with
fixed interest rates, effectively increasing
the cost of college loans — and therefore
the cost of college — for the very students
who are having a hard time affording it to
begin with.
There are real differences to be decid
ed in this election, and real differences
between the candidates. More than ever,

what course we choose will make a dif
ference — to you, your lives and your fu
ture. So I urge you to get involved in this
year's elections, regardless of your party
preference. One place you can start is by
going to my political website, www.dash

YOUth' section.
In 1787, near the end of the Consti
tutional Convention, Benjamin
Franklin was approached by a woman
who asked him, "Dr. Franklin, what
have you given us?"
"A republic," he replied. "If you can
keep it."
Now is your time to not only keep our
republic but to strengthen it. Now is your
time to shape America to your ideals, and
that work begins at the ballot box.

Senator Majority leader Tom Daschle, Democrat
from South Dakota, was first elected to Congress
in 1978. He has sewed in the U.S. Senate since
1986, and has sewed as Majority leader since
2001. He is not currently up for re-election.
