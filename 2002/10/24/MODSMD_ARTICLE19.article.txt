# Controversial views should be respected
## 
### ANGAD BHALLA EDITORIAL BOARD 
As a member of The Stan
ford Daily editorial board, I
would like to personally apolo
gize for what I believe was a
mistake that appeared in the
Oct. 22 editorial "Featuring di
verse views promotes free
speech." The message of the
editorial was clear. However, its
presentation reflected an unin
tentional bias. As the editorial
stated, the board believes that
the presentation of speakers
with diverse perspectives pro
motes a climate of healthy intel
lectual debate on campus. Free
dom of speech should be up
held for speakers regardless of
the controversy that may sur
round them.
The editorial acknowledged
that both Ehud Barak and
Amiri Baraka are considered
controversial and even offen
sive to members of the Stan
ford community. In order to

contextualize the argument,
the editorial included four
lines of a Baraka poem. I be
lieve that, taken out of context,
these lines alone could be con
strued as controversial or of
fensive. The editorial in no way
intended to reinforce the claim
that these lines are offensive or
that the author's views can be
judged by four lines out of a
two-page poem.
Ehud Barak's positions and
statements on various issues
could just as easily be deemed
controversial or offensive to
members of the Stanford com
munity. In an interview for the
New York Times Review of
Books, Barak stated in refer
ence to Arab society: "They are
products of a culture ... in
which to tell a lie creates no dis
sonance. Truth is seen as an ir
relevant category."
The editorial board still
firmly believes that the rights of
speakers with controversial
views should be respected.
