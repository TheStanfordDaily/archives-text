# Festival to highlight humanitarian films
## UNAFF to screen int'l documentaries on campus this weekend 
### DEVON MAYLIE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In his film "The Mark of Cain,"
Alix Lambert explores the fading
practice of tattooing as a mark of
power in Russian prisons, a cus
tom that is being replaced by the
exchanging of money.
Lambert's film is one of the
many that will be screened at
Stanford as a part of the fifth an
nual United Nations Association

Film Festival from Oct. 24 to 27.
This year's festival, entitled
"Humanity is Indivisible," pre
sents documentary films from five
continents and 26 countries that
cover topics such as human
rights, women's issues, environ
mental problems and war and
peace.
The festival is sponsored by the
United Nations Association Mid
peninsula Chapter and the Stan
ford Film Society.
"The cameras of our filmmak
ers take us on a global journey,
and their powerful images each
outline a unique snapshot of the
world today," said UNAFF
founder and director Jasmina

Bojic, a Stanford professor. She
established the festival four years
ago to bring films to Stanford and
the Bay Area that are rarely, or
never, seen in movie theaters or
on television.
"Unlike other forms of com
munication such as the newspa
per, television or the Internet,
documentaries immerse the par
ticipants into a world where they
can get to know individuals, their
lives and the realities that plague
them," Bojic said.

In talking about his film, Lam
bert said," I hoped that while talk
ing about what their tattoos
mean, the prisoners would tell a
story of Russia, tattooing being a
window — a visual — into a
changing society."
One inmate in the film makes
this connection directly.
"The prison is a model of the
state,"he says."It resembles the
theater of the absurd; how every


LUIS FELIPE ADAIME/The Stanford Daily
thing is bought by new Russian
money."
The film also illustrates how
the transition from tattooing to
monetary exchange is a product
of the growing number of wealthy
young people being jailed for
murder and drug possession.
Another film that will be
screened at the festival is "Strange
Fruit," a documentary on the
1930s song about lynching in the
American South. The song was
originally written by a Russian-
Jewish immigrant named Abel
Meeropol and popularized by Bil
lie Holiday's 1939 rendition.
"The power of art and the acts
of individuals have the power to
change the world," said Joel Katz,
producer and director of
"Strange Fruit."
"1 have tried to see it as an op
portunity to try to heal some of
the wounds around race which
my father suffered and which all
Americans suffer," he added.
The film illustrates the power

of music while telling a story of
prejudice and lynching. Thread
ed by a reading of the lyrics, musi
cians and historians comment on
the importance of the song in the
past and how today it is given new
meanings.
"Underground Zero," a collec
tion of 13 short films created in re
sponse to the Sept. 11 attacks —
as a dialogue about suffering,
confusion and different reactions
to violence — will also be
screened.
"Today, more than ever, there
is a need for diverse voices to be
heard," said producers Jay
Rosenblatt and Caveh Zahedi.
" 'Underground Zero' is our at
tempt to make a meaningful con
tribution to the current political
and cultural discourse."
Communication Prof. Kristine
Samuelson and her husband and
film partner John Haptas submit
ted one of the 13 short films,
called "The World as We Know-
It." When the team started film
ing, the United States had just
begun to bomb Afghanistan.
"We are not saying if it is right
or wrong, but are putting it in
context with other 20th-century

wars," said Samuelson, who de
scribes the short film as a series of
impressionistic essays on the
boundary between documentary
and experimental. Stanford
Music Prof. Chris Chafe provided
an electronic music soundtrack
for the four-minute piece.
While the festival features
award-winning documentaries
such as "Thoth," winner of the
2002 Academy Award for best doc
umentary short, it will also show
first-time screenings such as the
American premier of "Gaza Strip."
Director and producer James
Longley went to Israel and the
Palestinian territories to film the
situation in the Gaza Strip, which
he said has not been widely tackled
by filmmakers. With no connec
tion to any of the parties involved
in the Middle East conflict, Long
ley was shocked to see a different
situation than he had expected.
"When I arrived there, it
rapidly became clear that the situ
ation on the ground was far worse
than I had anticipated and that
there was probably a moral im
perative to make a film about the
conditions that 1 saw, because the
reality 1 encountered was so much

more extreme than its portrayal
in most media," Longley said.
While filming, Longley said he
tried not to get in between the view
er and the subject but instead to
create a window for the viewer to
experience the conflict first-hand.
"The annual UNAFF cele
brates the efforts of documentary
filmmakers to fight for interna
tional peace, justice and dignity
for all people around the world,"
Bojic said. Twenty filmmakers
will discuss their work at the end
of the screenings, and all screen
ings are free for students.
"Audience members the have
the opportunity to 'travel the
world' in four clays," Bojic said.
"It's an invitation to partake in the
most pressing international de
bates, by educating, informing and
stimulating each viewer's mind."
"Strange Fruit" shows Thurs
day at 10:45 p.m. in Cubberly Au
ditorium. "Underground Zero"
shows Saturday at 4:16 p.m. in
Annenberg Auditorium. "Mark of
Cain" shows at 2:40 p.m. and

rights, women's issues, environ
mental problems and war and
peace.
The festival is sponsored by the
United Nations Association Mid
peninsula Chapter and the Stan
ford Film Society.
"The cameras of our filmmak
ers take us on a global journey,
and their powerful images each
outline a unique snapshot of the
world today," said UNAFF
founder and director Jasmina

Bojic, a Stanford professor. She
established the festival four years
ago to bring films to Stanford and
the Bay Area that are rarely, or
never, seen in movie theaters or
on television.
"Unlike other forms of com
munication such as the newspa
per, television or the Internet,
documentaries immerse the par
ticipants into a world where they
can get to know individuals, their
lives and the realities that plague
them," Bojic said.

In talking about his film, Lam
bert said," I hoped that while talk
ing about what their tattoos
mean, the prisoners would tell a
story of Russia, tattooing being a
window — a visual — into a
changing society."
One inmate in the film makes
this connection directly.
"The prison is a model of the
state,"he says."It resembles the
theater of the absurd; how every


LUIS FELIPE ADAIME/The Stanford Daily
thing is bought by new Russian
money."
The film also illustrates how
the transition from tattooing to
monetary exchange is a product
of the growing number of wealthy
young people being jailed for
murder and drug possession.
Another film that will be
screened at the festival is "Strange
Fruit," a documentary on the
1930s song about lynching in the
American South. The song was
originally written by a Russian-
Jewish immigrant named Abel
Meeropol and popularized by Bil
lie Holiday's 1939 rendition.
"The power of art and the acts
of individuals have the power to
change the world," said Joel Katz,
producer and director of
"Strange Fruit."
"1 have tried to see it as an op
portunity to try to heal some of
the wounds around race which
my father suffered and which all
Americans suffer," he added.
The film illustrates the power

of music while telling a story of
prejudice and lynching. Thread
ed by a reading of the lyrics, musi
cians and historians comment on
the importance of the song in the
past and how today it is given new
meanings.
"Underground Zero," a collec
tion of 13 short films created in re
sponse to the Sept. 11 attacks —
as a dialogue about suffering,
confusion and different reactions
to violence — will also be
screened.
"Today, more than ever, there
is a need for diverse voices to be
heard," said producers Jay
Rosenblatt and Caveh Zahedi.
" 'Underground Zero' is our at
tempt to make a meaningful con
tribution to the current political
and cultural discourse."
Communication Prof. Kristine
Samuelson and her husband and
film partner John Haptas submit
ted one of the 13 short films,
called "The World as We Know-
It." When the team started film
ing, the United States had just
begun to bomb Afghanistan.
"We are not saying if it is right
or wrong, but are putting it in
context with other 20th-century

wars," said Samuelson, who de
scribes the short film as a series of
impressionistic essays on the
boundary between documentary
and experimental. Stanford
Music Prof. Chris Chafe provided
an electronic music soundtrack
for the four-minute piece.
While the festival features
award-winning documentaries
such as "Thoth," winner of the
2002 Academy Award for best doc
umentary short, it will also show
first-time screenings such as the
American premier of "Gaza Strip."
Director and producer James
Longley went to Israel and the
Palestinian territories to film the
situation in the Gaza Strip, which
he said has not been widely tackled
by filmmakers. With no connec
tion to any of the parties involved
in the Middle East conflict, Long
ley was shocked to see a different
situation than he had expected.
"When I arrived there, it
rapidly became clear that the situ
ation on the ground was far worse
than I had anticipated and that
there was probably a moral im
perative to make a film about the
conditions that 1 saw, because the
reality 1 encountered was so much

more extreme than its portrayal
in most media," Longley said.
While filming, Longley said he
tried not to get in between the view
er and the subject but instead to
create a window for the viewer to
experience the conflict first-hand.
"The annual UNAFF cele
brates the efforts of documentary
filmmakers to fight for interna
tional peace, justice and dignity
for all people around the world,"
Bojic said. Twenty filmmakers
will discuss their work at the end
of the screenings, and all screen
ings are free for students.
"Audience members the have
the opportunity to 'travel the
world' in four clays," Bojic said.
"It's an invitation to partake in the
most pressing international de
bates, by educating, informing and
stimulating each viewer's mind."
"Strange Fruit" shows Thurs

In his film "The Mark of Cain,"
Alix Lambert explores the fading
practice of tattooing as a mark of
power in Russian prisons, a cus
tom that is being replaced by the
exchanging of money.
Lambert's film is one of the
many that will be screened at
Stanford as a part of the fifth an
nual United Nations Association

Film Festival from Oct. 24 to 27.
This year's festival, entitled
