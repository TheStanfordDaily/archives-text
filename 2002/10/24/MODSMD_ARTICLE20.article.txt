### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU 
Synergy is not the average
Stanford dormitory. One of
seven cooperative houses at the
University, it boasts a sweet
smelling compost heap, a hilly,
"thigh strengthening" location,
and the biggest garden on cam
pus. Residents plant, clean and
cook vegetarian meals together.
They don't hold house meet
ings in the usual fashion: "Syn
ners" make decisions by holding
up a varying number of lingers.
Five signifies approval; a "fist
block" means dissent.
Synergy has something else
that makes it stand out: a com
mune. In previous years, its
down-the-hUI neighbor Colum
bae also offered communal liv
ing. This quarter, however, Syn
ergy is the only co-op with a com
mune. Fourteen Synners sleep,
socialize and study in a four
room complex spread out over
the dorm's second and third
floors. The commune comprises
a study room, two sleep rooms
and a party room.
Nicknamed "Meyer Library"
or "Bing Wing" by Synners, the
study area is a large, window
filled space with a hummingbird
feeder hanging from the eves. A
long table with wooden chairs
occupies the center. Desks and
armchairs face the windows.
"There are great working
vibes here," said commune
member Malavika Mohanan.
"No one would ever dream of
talking on the phone or doing

something disrespectful like
that. The hummingbirds are the
only possible distraction."
The co-ed sleeping rooms
contain a mix of bunk beds, fu
tons, blankets and egg-crates.
Pinpointing how many people
sleep there is difficult; because
guests are always welcome, the
number changes almost every
night.
One closet contains a sur
prise: a mattress that barely fits
on the floor. Mohanan ex
plained the meaning of this
bizarre set-up.
"There was one person who
wanted to be part of the com
mune but didn't like noise and
wanted personal space. So we
tried to be accommodating and
now he has something that re
sembles a single," she said.
Fhe social room is tangle of
futons, blankets, Christmas
lights and wall decorations. On
the other side of the walk
through window is a porch filled
with sleeping bags and a gigantic
mural. The mural is the product
of the commune-warming party;
the sleeping bags are an indica
tion that many sleep outside.
Members of the commune
range from underclassmen to
one graduate student. They
have diverse majors, political
views, personalities and environ
mental ethics.
"What's fabulous is that peo
ple can have different opinions
and still get along," Mohanan
said. "You can have a disagree
ment with someone and have a
great conversation at dinner
with them 10 minutes later."
"We're really accepting here,"
she added. "We learn to deal
with our differences."
Junior David Gasca called the

commune Stanford's "best-kept
secret."
Erica Simmons, a latecomer
to the commune, cited space as a
main advantage. "Having four
different rooms means that
there is room for everyone to do
their own tiling without bother
ing others," she said.
Material things soon lose
their significance for residents.
"You realize you don't need
all of your stuff," Mohanan said.
"There are always textbooks and
computers lying around. And
everyone's willing to share."
Commune living is definitely
not for everyone. It works for the
open-minded and flexible who
are willing to accept that a guitar
left in the social room may be
come what Gasca termed "a
communal guitar."
Zack Frenz, a Columbae se
nior who has lived in four com
munes, said messiness could be a
problem.
"Lots of times there will be
books, papers and Coke cans
everywhere," he said. "Occa
sionally you just have to go on a
cleaning crusade."
Mohanan said she doubted
things would run as smoothly if
Synergy's four-room complex
were a true commune in the real
world.
"Paying the rent and dealing
with stuff like that could cause a
lot of problems," she said.
"We're pretty protected here at
Stanford."
For the self-selecting group
that can put up with a bit of
noise, lots of neighbors and "ac
cidental borrowing," the com
mune is a great opportunity.
"This place is heaven," Gasca
said. "It's really Mount Olym
pus."
