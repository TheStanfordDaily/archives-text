# Minority enrollment rises at UC schools
## 
### SHANE WALLIN THE CALIFORNIA AGGIE (UC-DAVIS 
(U-WIRE) DAVIS, Calif.—
The University of California
announced earlier this month
that more students from under
represented ethnic groups have
enrolled this year in the UC
medical and law schools than in
2001.
System-wide, the five medical
schools enrolled 94 underrepre
sented students — or 16.5 percent
of the total first-year student pop
ulation— up from the 11.9 per
cent that (58 students yielded in
2001.
The UC law schools had a simi
lar percentage increase from 2001
to 2002. Students from underrep
resented ethnic groups represent
ed 11 percent of first-year law stu
dents in 2001 and rose to 1(5.2 per
cent this year. The three UC law
schools enrolled 817 first-year stu
dents in fall 2001 and 772 in fall
2002.
These rates, however, are still
below those of the affirmative ac
tion era, when the rates were con
sistently over 20 percent, and did
not indicate how many women
were in the schools.
"We are greatly encouraged
to see the positive trend in en
rollment of underrepresented
minorities," said Michael V.
Drake, the UC vice president for
health affairs, in a press release.
According to UC spokesperson
Lavonne Luquis, after Proposition
209 there was a sharp drop-off in
underrepresented minority stu
dent enrollment, but the rising
numbers are indications that out
reach programs are starting to
yield results.
In 2001, the UC Davis School of
Law enrolled 214 new students.
Of these, 19 students were from
underrepresented ethnic groups.
The total number enrolled in 2002

was 190; 31 of those identified as
minorities.
The UCI) Medical School en
rolled 93 new students in both
2001 arid 2002. Of those in 2001,
eight were identified as underrep
resented and increased this year to
14, or 15.1 percent of the incom
ing class.
Outreach and recruitment
programs at the UC medical and
law schools are intended to im
prove students' skills and pre
pare them for professional
school.
The King Hall Outreach Pro
gram is aimed at economically and
educationally underprivileged
students. The program is year
long and begins its efforts with un
dergraduate sophomores, said
Kevin Johnson, UCD Law
School's associate dean for acade
mic affairs.
During Summer Sessions, eco
nomically disadvantaged prospec
tive law students are paid a small
stipend that enables them to at
tend KHOP classes. These classes
are designed to improve writing
skills, prepare students for the
LSAT — the law school entrance
exam — and the application
process for law school, Johnson
said.
Students who are not admitted
to the medical schools can go
through the Postbaccalaureate
Reapplicant Program — a year
long program of courses, seminars
and workshops.
The programs target students
from educationally and economi
cally disadvantaged backgrounds
and students who want to work in
areas in California that are med
ically underserved.
The release cited stronger re
cruitment efforts and strong out
reach programs as some reasons
for the increase in enrollment
among underrepresented stu
dents.
