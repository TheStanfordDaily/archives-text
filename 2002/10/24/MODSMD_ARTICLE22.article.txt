(U-WIRE) NEW YORK — Semen may be
a natural "upper" and its effect may be addic -
tive, according to a recent study of sexually ac
tive college women.
The study, conducted at the State Univer
sity of New York at Albany, found that women
having sex without condoms were less de
pressed than those using them.
Researchers asked 293 undergraduate fe
males how often they had sex, the type of con
traception used and the number of days since
they last had sex. Results revealed that de
pression levels increased with the frequency
of the subjects' condom use.
"1 wouldn't use the word 'addictive,' but
sex without a condom is definitely better,"
said Paula, a New York University graduate
student who declined to give her last name.
"You feel much more connected to the per

son you're with emotionally. Skin on skin just
feels so much smoother."
Professor Gordon Gallup, who headed the
research project, said although the exact
cause of the antidepressant effect was not
clear, it has been proven that semen is ab
sorbed through the vaginal walls. Semen con
tains testosterone, estrogen and other hor
mones with the potential to affect mood and
sexual behavior, he said.
"If the results could be proven, 1 suppose
some attempt should be made to try to isolate
and simulate the antidepressant effect," Gallup
said, but added later that he was not concerned
with practical applications of the study.
The study, published in the June issue of
the "Archives of Sexual Behavior," has re
ceived mixed reactions.
Dr. Ira Sharlip, a urologist in San Francis
co and president of the Sexual Medicine Soci
ety of North America, criticized the study in
an article published on Salon.com.

"This is the kind of junk science that smears
the name of honest science," Sharlip wrote.
Student critics were tjnic k to point out the
dangers of unprotected sex.
"We were raised watching after-school spe
cials informing us about the dangers of AIDS
and the importance of wearing a condom, not
to mention STDs and unwanted pregnan
cies," said Sarah, a performing arts major at
NYU who declined to give her last name.
"I'm not saying I've never done it, but I he fact
that there are so many students having sex
without condoms is scary."
Gallup said it was not his intention to pro
mote sex without a condom.
"Condom use was the only way we could
isolate the effect of semen. 1 have no control
over the media. I just try to represent the
facts," Gallup said.
Although few NYU students questioned
the uplifting effects of sex, some questioned
I he cause.
