### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Stanford women's volleyball team's
mtotch against Pacific on Tuesday in Stock
ton was supposed to be about Cardinal
coach John Dunning's long-awaited return
to his former school. It ended up being
about another highlight-reel performance
in the illustrious career of Stanford senior
outside hitter Logan Tom.

Tuesday: No. 6 Stanford def. Pacific 30-28, 30-
18, 30-26

1 he three-time Ail-American put away
14 kills with only one hitting error in guid
ing the No. 6 Cardinal (17-3) to a 79-
minute sweep over the Tigers (11-8) in
front of 2,126 in the Spanos Center.
In his first visit back to the Stockton cam
pus since leaving for Stanford last year,
Dunning improved to 2-0 against Pacific,
where he coached for 16 years, winning
back-to-back national titles in 1984 and
1985.
The leelings expressed by Dunning and
Tigers coach Jayne McHugh, who played
for and coached alongside Dunning at Pa
cific, leading up to the match on Monday
were much more subdued than the emo
tions surrounding last year's meeting at
Stanford. This week, both sides talked of
having moved on with their respective pro
grams in the past year, a sentiment that
seemed to extend through the match.
"Last year, I felt bad playing against peo

pie who I was close to," Dunning said.'This
year, there was more distance. It was like
going home to see friends who weren't on
my team. It was more like a homecoming
than a trauma. I left feeling good. Winning
didn't hurt."
At the outset, it looked like Tuesday's
match could provide as much excitement as
last year's contest in Maples Pavilion, which
Stanford narrowly pulled out in five games.
On Tuesday, Pacific took the first three
points of the opening game on its way to an
early 8-2 lead. Stanford took its first lead at
21-20 on one of sophomore outside hitter
Ogonna Nnamani's 10 kills and never
looked back.
"We had the first game start the
wrong way," Dunning said. "We got aced
twice right of! the bat, and we just tight
ened up fora while. Then we started
playing volleyball.
"For being on the road against a team
that is unranked but could be dangerous,
with some unusual circumstances, we were
happy to be on the road at 9:00."
The Cardinal had a strong night from
the service line for the second straight
match—continuing the team's recovery
from a couple of weeks of woeful serving
earlier this month — running off nine aces
on the Tigers' receivers and thwarting Pa
cific's passing all match long.
Senior outside hitter Ashley Ivy, the Pa
cific- 10 Conference's ace leader, broke a re
cent serving cold streak with a match-high
four aces, bringing her to within one of her
career-best season total of 46.
"Serving is a major component of the

game, and when the serving is off, it can af
fect other aspects of the game," Ivy said.
"These last two matches, we've shown a lot
of improvement in our serve, and hopeful
ly it'll continue to improve."
Junior All-American middle blocker Jen
niter Joines of Pacific was the primary target
of the Stanford defense, and the Cardinal
did a good job of shutting her down for most
of the match. Though a spat of late kills gave
Joines a match-high total of 15, Stanford was
able to hold her to a .237 hitting percentage,
about 150 points below her season average.
Tom had a big hand in containing
Joines, coming up with a match-high 15
digs to go along with 11 from freshman
libero Courtney Schultz. Stanford outdug
Pacific 52-43, forcing the Tigers to hit just
.163 in the match.
"[Tom] had a lot of energy on defense,"
Dunning said. "She served some good balls,
hit well. I think she's starting to have more
fun out there."
After the Cardinal tied the first game up
at 20-20, the teams exchanged points up to
28-28, when kills by Tom and junior mid
dle blocker Jenn Harvey sealed a 30-28 win
for Stanford.
An early five-point run in the second
game, sparked by two aces from Ivy, set the
Cardinal on course fora quick 30-18 win
leading into the intermission.
Junior Sara Dukes took over Harvey's
spot in the middle in the third game and
prompt ly ran off her first two aces of the sea
son as the Cardinal took five straight points

on her serve for an early 6-0 lead.
Despite eight kills from Joines, the
Tigers couldn't catch up, and a kill
by Tom on Stanford's second
match point sealed the affair with a
30-26 Cardinal win.

"They picked up their game in
the third game, and at the end it
was a relief to have it over with and
to come back home," said junior
middle blocker Sara McCee, who
had a match-high three blocks.
"We got the job done, and that's all
that matters."

a visit to Maples at 7:00 p.m.
