# Virtual polls drive some fans insane
## 
### 
To borrow a line from Jamiroquai, the in
comparable recording artist of '90s fame,
the future's made of virtual insanity. I
couldn't put it any better myself. From
glowing hockey pucks and catcher cams, to yellow
first-down lines and ads behind home plate that
aren't really there, technology has forever altered the

way we watch sports. And while most
new features designed to improve
viewing pleasure draw lots of Oohs,
every now and then a new effect will
come along that is worthy of more
than a few Boos, or booze if you are
so inclined.
Fox's coverage of the World Series
is a fine example. While I love the
Sounds of the Game feature, such as

listening in on conversations at the pitcher's mound,
the advent of the Sprint PCS Virtual Manager, an in
teractive component that asks viewers to log on to a
Web site to answer various questions throughout the
game, is absolute garbage.
"Should the Angels pitch to Barry Bonds?" is one
example of the type of question you can expect to
pop up following the network's patented chime,
which for years has signaled the scrolling scoreboard
was on its way.
If as much as one percent answered yes to this ut
terly useless question you must conclude one of two
things. Either Barry cast an absentee vote from the
on-deck circle, or he got Shawon Dunston's son and
team ball boy to log on to vote in Dusty Baker's office.
Besides the fact that I'd be watching "Who Wants
to be a Millionaire?" if I wanted to see people ask the

audience, the Virtual Manager
questions are duller than a steak
knife in Wilbur Dining.
After Bonds blasts one, prepare
yourself for the gripping, "Should
the Angels make a pitching
change?" to pop up.
Um, gee, can I phone a friend?
Honestly, what do 1 care ifjoe
Blow in Idaho thinks the Angels
should go to the pen? And why
should he care if I think Percival
should pitch the eighth inning? I
only mildly care what Anaheim
manager Mike Scioscia does, and
1 can guarantee you he isn't
swayed by what either of us
thinks.
But while Virtual Manager is
incapable of asking the big ques
tions, your Virtual Columnist —
still awaiting word on a sponsor
ship deal — is not!
Consider this the interactive
component of your Thursday
morning enhanced reading, if you
will, albeit without the nifty intro
ductory chime. And now for the
truly important questions on
everyone's mind, with no online
voting necessary.
Should Barry Bonds swing at
pitches while being intentionally
walked?
In the event they win the World
Series, will the Angels have a bottle
of sparkling cider set aside for 20-
year-old, virtually unhittable
Francisco Rodriguez for the lock
et-room celebration?
If two home runs hit the Taco
Bell target in McCovey Cove,
does that mean everyone gets two

free tacos?
Who would win a steel-cage
wrestling match between Baker
and Scioscia?
What about a sunflower-seed
spitting contest?
Who would you rather see play
Mini-Me's sidekick in the next
Austin Powers movie, David Eck
stein or the Rally Monkey?
Could anyone possibly be
watching this Series and be think
ing, "I can't wait for the NBA sea
son to start?"
Are there more fans waving
Thunder Stix at Edison Field or
elite businessmen on cell-phones
at Pac-Bell?
Do you think the Angels'
Bengie Molina, a sub-.230 hitter
this postseason, had to pinch
himself to make sure he wasn't
dreaming after being intentional
ly walked not once, but twice in
Game 3?
Is there a funnier sight than
watching American League pitc h
ers bat?
Ramon Ortiz, I'm talking
about you.
Needless to say, the chances of
any of these popping up on your
television screen during Game 5
are, well,'virtually none.
I could get used to this Virtual
Columnist deal, providing all
questions and no answers, but alas,
I don't need to poll the audience to
know that it's time to put an end to
at least this virtual, and Virtual
Manager, insanity.

more. Write him at ssallen@stan
ford.edu if you have any idea why
anyone continues to pitch to Harry
Bonds.
