Fresh off a short two-game homestand,
the Stanford women's soccer team hits the
road again this weekend, putting its No. 1
national ranking on the line against Wash
ington State and Washington in the third
weekend of Pacific-10 Conference play.

at Washington, Sunday, Noon

The Cardinal (13-1 -0,4-0-0 Pac-10) takes
with it the momentum of a truly dominating
weekend. In winning its two games against
the Oregon schools last weekend, the squad
also posted its ninth and 10th shutouts of the
year â€” outshooting the opposition by a
combined 51-4 margin in the process.
The Cardinal marked five goals on the
weekend, with two players scoring their first
collegiate goal. The contribution from the
bench that is received was important on a
weekend when injuries depleted the start
ing lineup.
"It's always good when you can bring
players on and the intensity and skill level
stays the same," co-coach Paul Sapsford
said. "That's one of the attributes of this
team. We have so much strength and depth,
[that] we're able to wear other teams down."
Thankfully for the Cardinal, the injury
report looks much better this week, as ju
nior defender Alison Pabon should be able
to play with her sprained ankle and junior
defender Natalie Spilger shouldn't be hin
dered by a nagging shoulder injury.
"We just have [freshman] Jennifer
Farenbaugh recovering from a broken fin
ger," Sapsford said. "She's got that in a cast
and hopefully the referees will allow her to
play. That's the only real concern we have."
It will be important for the Cardinal to be

at full strength as it goes against two worthy
opponents in a tough road series.
Washington State brings a 7-4-2 record
into the weekend and the momentum of
three straight double-overtime wins. The
Cougars are undefeated in Pac-10 play with
a 1-0-2 record.
Washington, which is returning home
for the first time in a month, brings in a 7-4-
3 mark on the season with a 2-0-1 Pac-10
record. The main task for the Cardinal de
fense will be to shut down junior striker
Melissa Bennett, who leads the Huskies
with 24 points (five goals, 14 assists).
The Stanford defense can take some
comfort in the fact that it plays in front of
one of the nation's best goalkeepers in red
shirt sophomore Nicole Barnhart. Just two
weeks off of her dominating performances
against No. 7 UCLA and No. 17 USC, which
earned her Pac-10 Player of the Week hon
ors, she appears as sharp as ever.
"1 would have to say that [the UCLA
game] was the finest female goalkeeping
performance that I've ever seen," Sapsford
said. "She pulled off a couple of inspira
tional saves and is an outstanding goalkeep
er. She'll be a very high draft choice when
she eventually turns professional. She's a
leading goal keeper in the nation and one of
the reasons we have so few goals conceded."
With excellent communication between
Barnhart and one of the fastest backlines in
women's collegiate soccer, Stanford has
posted 10 shutouts on the year already.
The strength of the defense also enables the
Cardinal to open up more space offensive
ly and pressure teams up front.
"Having a good keeper gives the rest of
the team confidence," Sapsford said.
"When a defender has the ball, they have
more composure because they know if they
make a mistake, then Barney is back there
to bail them out. The whole team
plays with more confidence."
The Cardinal will look to take
that confidence up to Washing

ton this weekend to face Wash
ington State on Friday at 3:00
p.m. and Washington on Sunday
at noon.
"The most important thing is to
take each game as it comes," Saps
ford said. "Right now we are
preparing for Washington State.
We focus on that and nothing else."
