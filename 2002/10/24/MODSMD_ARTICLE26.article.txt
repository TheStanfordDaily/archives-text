# Swimmers have loss to Texas on minds
## 
### KRISTIN MORITZ 
Beating the No. 1 men's collegiate
swimming team might seem a formida
ble task. Beating that team in its own
pool might seem down right impossi
ble. But the members of the Cardinal
men's swimming team, however, have
high hopes of making this goal a reality
come spring at the expense of top
ranked Texas.

Last season, Stanford finished second
at the NCAA Championships in Athens,
Ga., falling just short of the coveted na
tional title. The Longhorns outscored
the Cardinal by 11 points, one of the clos
est margins in championship history. It
was the second year in a row that Stan
ford finished behind the Texas team.
"Though the circumstances last year
were unfortunate, this year we know that

if we swim like we know how to, we will
win the meet," junior Nick Bott said. "It
will be a very competitive, extremely in
tense meet in Austin (the site of the 2003
NCAA Championships). Swimming in
their pool is not going to be easy, but I
know that our team has the confidence
and depth to come away with the title."
"I"lie Stanford men dominated the Pa
cific- 10 Conference last year, finishing 4-
0 in Pac-10 dual meet competition. Stan
ford won its 21st consecutive title at the
Pac-10 Championships, the longest ath
letic winning streak in NCAA history. As
always, California and Southern Califor
nia will be the team's toughest Pac-10
competition this year.
Though the regular dual-meet season
does not begin until January, this week
end Stanford travels to Stockton for the
University of the Pacific Invite.
"We don't have any lofty goals going
into this meet, but it will be a good indi
cation of how we are swimming as a team
and what we still need to work on," se

nior co-captain Randall Bal said. "It is an
especially valuable experience for the
freshmen to compete in their first colle
giate meet. We are all excited to see
where we are in training because we
have been working so hard."
Working hard is indeed what the
team has been doing. The swimmers
spent 11 days at the Olympic Training
Center in Colorado Springs, Colo., in
early September. Though the athletes
completed grueling high-altitude aero
bic workouts, head coach Skip Kenney
stressed the importance of their mental
as well as physical toughness.
"We had three practices a day for four
of the days. Granted the training was dif
ficult, but it really helped to bring the
team together," Bott said. "We all knew
that it would make us better and that it
would give us that mental edge we need
in order to win."
This year, the team elected four cap-

tains instead of the usual three.
Bal, in addition to seniors John
Waters and Dan Westcott and ju
nior Markus Rogan, took on the
role as team leader.
"Those four are the guys we
count on in meets and in practice,"
Bott said. "They lead us in the
water in competition and keep us
motivated in practice as well. It's
great to have guys on the team that
everyone respects."
In August, Rogan claimed two
silver medals and a bronze at the
European Championships held in
Berlin. Bal swam for the United
States at the Pan-Pacific Champi
onships in Japan and captured a
silver medal in the 100-meter
backstroke. Junior Peter Marshall
also competed in the Pan-Pac meet
but did not advance to the finals in
the 100 back due to the fact that
only two swimmers from each
country could advance to the fi
nals, and other Americans posted
the top-two times.

In addition to the strength of
the somewhat older, more experi
enced swimmers, the Cardinal also
expects a strong showing from its
seven freshmen. According to
Bott, the freshmen have incredible
depth and the potential to make
significant contributions to the
team. The freshmen, as well, look
forward to competition.
"My experience so far with the
team has exceeded all expecta
tions," freshman Mark Stephens
said. "The practices are intense,
but all of us are getting stronger
and faster as we push ourselves to
the limit.
"Everyone on the team is best
friends with everyone else. We are
brothers, and that is the best part
about this team. If we stick togeth
er, work each other through the
practices and strive to accomplish
our best, then we will improve in
the pool and a national champi
onship will come."
As the season progresses, the
combined talents of both the up
perclass leaders and the incoming
freshmen should provide all that is
necessary to capture a title at the
national championships.

especially valuable experience for the
freshmen to compete in their first colle

where we are in training because we
have been working so hard."
Working hard is indeed what the
team has been doing. The swimmers
spent 11 days at the Olympic Training
Center in Colorado Springs, Colo., in
early September. Though the athletes
completed grueling high-altitude aero
bic workouts, head coach Skip Kenney
stressed the importance of their mental
as well as physical toughness.
"We had three practices a day for four
of the days. Granted the training was dif
ficult, but it really helped to bring the
team together," Bott said. "We all knew
that it would make us better and that it
would give us that mental edge we need
in order to win."

tains instead of the usual three.
Bal, in addition to seniors John
Waters and Dan Westcott and ju
nior Markus Rogan, took on the
role as team leader.
"Those four are the guys we
count on in meets and in practice,"
Bott said. "They lead us in the
water in competition and keep us
motivated in practice as well. It's
great to have guys on the team that
everyone respects."
In August, Rogan claimed two
silver medals and a bronze at the
European Championships held in
Berlin. Bal swam for the United
States at the Pan-Pacific Champi
onships in Japan and captured a
silver medal in the 100-meter
backstroke. Junior Peter Marshall
also competed in the Pan-Pac meet
but did not advance to the finals in
the 100 back due to the fact that
only two swimmers from each
country could advance to the fi
nals, and other Americans posted
the top-two times.

In addition to the strength of
the somewhat older, more experi
enced swimmers, the Cardinal also
expects a strong showing from its
seven freshmen. According to
Bott, the freshmen have incredible
depth and the potential to make
significant contributions to the
team. The freshmen, as well, look
forward to competition.
"My experience so far with the
team has exceeded all expecta
tions," freshman Mark Stephens
said. "The practices are intense,
but all of us are getting stronger
and faster as we push ourselves to
the limit.
"Everyone on the team is best
friends with everyone else. We are
brothers, and that is the best part
about this team. If we stick togeth
er, work each other through the
practices and strive to accomplish
our best, then we will improve in
the pool and a national champi
onship will come."
As the season progresses, the
combined talents of both the up
perclass leaders and the incoming
freshmen should provide all that is
necessary to capture a title at the
national championships.
Beating the No. 1 men's collegiate
swimming team might seem a formida
ble task. Beating that team in its own
pool might seem down right impossi
ble. But the members of the Cardinal
men's swimming team, however, have
high hopes of making this goal a reality
come spring at the expense of top
ranked Texas.

at University of Pacific Invite, Saturday, 9:00 a.m

Last season, Stanford finished second
at the NCAA Championships in Athens,
Ga., falling just short of the coveted na
tional title. The Longhorns outscored
the Cardinal by 11 points, one of the clos
est margins in championship history. It
was the second year in a row that Stan
ford finished behind the Texas team.
"Though the circumstances last year
were unfortunate, this year we know that

if we swim like we know how to, we will
win the meet," junior Nick Bott said. "It
will be a very competitive, extremely in
tense meet in Austin (the site of the 2003
NCAA Championships). Swimming in
their pool is not going to be easy, but I
know that our team has the confidence
and depth to come away with the title."
"I"lie Stanford men dominated the Pa
cific- 10 Conference last year, finishing 4-
0 in Pac-10 dual meet competition. Stan
ford won its 21st consecutive title at the
Pac-10 Championships, the longest ath
letic winning streak in NCAA history. As
always, California and Southern Califor
nia will be the team's toughest Pac-10
competition this year.
Though the regular dual-meet season
does not begin until January, this week
end Stanford travels to Stockton for the
University of the Pacific Invite.
"We don't have any lofty goals going
into this meet, but it will be a good indi
cation of how we are swimming as a team
and what we still need to work on," se

nior co-captain Randall Bal said. "It is an
especially valuable experience for the
freshmen to compete in their first colle
giate meet. We are all excited to see
where we are in training because we
