# Swimmers have loss to Texas on minds

Beating the No. 1 men's collegiate
swimming team might seem a formida
ble task. Beating that team in its own
pool might seem down right impossi
ble. But the members of the Cardinal
men's swimming team, however, have
high hopes of making this goal a reality
come spring at the expense of top
ranked Texas.

Last season, Stanford finished second
at the NCAA Championships in Athens,
Ga., falling just short of the coveted na
tional title. The Longhorns outscored
the Cardinal by 11 points, one of the clos
est margins in championship history. It
was the second year in a row that Stan
ford finished behind the Texas team.
"Though the circumstances last year
were unfortunate, this year we know that

if we swim like we know how to, we will
win the meet," junior Nick Bott said. "It
will be a very competitive, extremely in
tense meet in Austin (the site of the 2003
NCAA Championships). Swimming in
their pool is not going to be easy, but I
know that our team has the confidence
and depth to come away with the title."
"I"lie Stanford men dominated the Pa
cific- 10 Conference last year, finishing 4-
0 in Pac-10 dual meet competition. Stan
ford won its 21st consecutive title at the
Pac-10 Championships, the longest ath
letic winning streak in NCAA history. As
always, California and Southern Califor
nia will be the team's toughest Pac-10
competition this year.
Though the regular dual-meet season
does not begin until January, this week
end Stanford travels to Stockton for the
University of the Pacific Invite.
"We don't have any lofty goals going
into this meet, but it will be a good indi
cation of how we are swimming as a team
and what we still need to work on," se

nior co-captain Randall Bal said. "It is an
especially valuable experience for the
freshmen to compete in their first colle
giate meet. We are all excited to see
where we are in training because we
have been working so hard."
Working hard is indeed what the
team has been doing. The swimmers
spent 11 days at the Olympic Training
Center in Colorado Springs, Colo., in
early September. Though the athletes
completed grueling high-altitude aero
bic workouts, head coach Skip Kenney
stressed the importance of their mental
as well as physical toughness.
"We had three practices a day for four
of the days. Granted the training was dif
ficult, but it really helped to bring the
team together," Bott said. "We all knew
that it would make us better and that it
would give us that mental edge we need
in order to win."
This year, the team elected four cap-
