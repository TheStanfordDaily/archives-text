# Fresh-faced squad opens preseason

### MIKE SCOTTO 
Less than six months after winning its 13th
national championship, the Stanford women's
tennis team is looking to reestablish itself as the
team to beat both in the Pacific-10 Conference
and the nation.

Women's Tennis

hosts iTA Regionals, Friday-Monday

Its first step toward that goal will be at the
ITA Regionals this weekend at Stanford's
Taube Family Tennis Center.
I he seedings for the tournament are based
on the ITA's individual preseason rankings.
Stanford will hold the top three seeds of the
tournament, with seventh-ranked sophomore
Erin Burdette taking the top seed, followed by
second-seeded junior Lauren Barnikow and
third-seeded freshman Amber Liu. The abun
dance of top seeds increases the opportunity for
a Stanford victory.
"We're going to have three of the top seeds,
so I think what happens is pretty wide open,"
said Stanford coach Lele Forood.
Stanford will be hosting the Northwest Re
gional, one of eight regionals nationwide. Al
though the finalists from this regional advance
to the ITA National Indoors in Dallas, Texas
next month, this weekend's play has more sig
nificance than simply just being a qualifying
tournament.
"It's bigger than that," Forood said. "It's a
chance for really all our team to play in a big
tournament. We have four freshmen, three of
whom haven't seen competition yet."
The tournament allows inexperienced play
ers, especially freshmen, to get a taste of actual
competition months before the start of the Pac
-10 season in February.
"It is significant. Erin Burdette won it last
year, and I think it allowed her to get estab
lished as a freshman early in the year," Forood
said.
While Forood enjoys the experience that the
regional provides her team, the players them
selves like the tournament because of the op

portunity it provides to get back into the swing
of competitive play.
"This is the most exciting tournament be
cause everybody can play," said sophomore
Story Tweedie-Yates, who anticipates facing
"players you don't normally play from other
schools."
Forood also believes that the tournament
will be a launching pad for the four freshmen

new to the Stanford team.
"It's probably more significant for the fresh
men than for anybody else because it gives
them a chance to establish themselves," she
said. "There aren't that many opportunities, if
you're not going to play at the top of the lineup,
to get a chance to play a lot of the No. I's from

that its youth and talent will carry it to a record 14th NCAA team title.
the other schools."
The regionals will serve as one
of the first chances for Stanford to
play meaningful matches against
other top collegiate players. In ad
dition, it will serve as a preliminary
measuring bar fora team that has
"multiple national contenders,"
according to its coach.
In addition to gaining experi
ence, the young Stanford team is
looking to leave a strong impres
sion in the minds of its regional op
ponents.
"If we do well in this tourna
ment, it's our chance to stamp our
authority on the region," fresh
man /Mice Barnes said.
That authority is likely to
emerge this weekend on Stan
ford's home courts. Stanford was
selected to host the regionals be
cause it was the only school to
place a bid.
"It really requires a lot of courts
and facilities. In the Northwest,
there aren't too many facilities that
could do it," Forood said.
Playing on its own campus, the
Stanford players will reap a num
ber of benefits from the home
court advantage beyond the in
creased fan support.
"I like to have it at home be
cause it's easier on our players,"

Forood said. "It's comfortable
playing at home and knowing you
can go about your schedule.
You're not staying at a hotel.
There are a lot of aspects about
this that are easy, which is one of
the reasons we bid every year to
host."
After losing three key players to
graduation, this year's team is
young but by no means incapable
of victory. The Cardinal may be
youthful, but it is far from devoid
of talent or leadership.
Six players are returning from
last year's championship squad,
and the squad has added four
freshmen capable of making an
immediate impact, including
Barnes and Liu.
Barnes, a native of England,
was the top-ranked English junior
player in 2002. Liu was the 2001
girls 18-and-under U.S. national
champion and advanced to the
quarterfinals of the ITA Ail-Amer
ican Championships two weeks
ago before withdrawing due to an
injury.
With the abundance of incom
ing talent , Forood expects no drop
off from the national champi
onship team of last year.
"We expect something out of all
of them," Forood said. "We're ex
pecting to be a young, talented
team. This means that maybe we'll
lose once or twice during the year,
but we'll be pretty good by the end
of the season."
