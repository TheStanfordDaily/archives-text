# Fresh-faced squad opens preseason

Less than six months after winning its 13th
national championship, the Stanford women's
tennis team is looking to reestablish itself as the
team to beat both in the Pacific-10 Conference
and the nation.

Women's Tennis

hosts iTA Regionals, Friday-Monday

Its first step toward that goal will be at the
ITA Regionals this weekend at Stanford's
Taube Family Tennis Center.
I he seedings for the tournament are based
on the ITA's individual preseason rankings.
Stanford will hold the top three seeds of the
tournament, with seventh-ranked sophomore
Erin Burdette taking the top seed, followed by
second-seeded junior Lauren Barnikow and
third-seeded freshman Amber Liu. The abun
dance of top seeds increases the opportunity for
a Stanford victory.
"We're going to have three of the top seeds,
so I think what happens is pretty wide open,"
said Stanford coach Lele Forood.
Stanford will be hosting the Northwest Re
gional, one of eight regionals nationwide. Al
though the finalists from this regional advance
to the ITA National Indoors in Dallas, Texas
next month, this weekend's play has more sig
nificance than simply just being a qualifying
tournament.
"It's bigger than that," Forood said. "It's a
chance for really all our team to play in a big
tournament. We have four freshmen, three of
whom haven't seen competition yet."
The tournament allows inexperienced play
ers, especially freshmen, to get a taste of actual
competition months before the start of the Pac
-10 season in February.
"It is significant. Erin Burdette won it last
year, and I think it allowed her to get estab
lished as a freshman early in the year," Forood
said.
While Forood enjoys the experience that the
regional provides her team, the players them
selves like the tournament because of the op

portunity it provides to get back into the swing
of competitive play.
"This is the most exciting tournament be
cause everybody can play," said sophomore
Story Tweedie-Yates, who anticipates facing
"players you don't normally play from other
schools."
Forood also believes that the tournament
will be a launching pad for the four freshmen

new to the Stanford team.
"It's probably more significant for the fresh
men than for anybody else because it gives
them a chance to establish themselves," she
said. "There aren't that many opportunities, if
you're not going to play at the top of the lineup,
to get a chance to play a lot of the No. I's from

Junior Lauren Barkinow serves to her opponent. The women's tennis team lost three seniors but hopes
that its youth and talent will carry it to a record 14th NCAA team title.
