# Construction thwarts tennis's plans
## 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Stanford men's tennis team had a sweet-sounding plan
for how to start its fall season: send some players to a couple of
warm-up tournaments, then have the whole team debut at the
ITA Regional Championships on its home courts.

There was just one snag — with the Cardinal women's team
already hosting their side of the ITA regionals and the new Enci
na tennis courts being constructed near the Taube Family Ten
nis Center not yet complete, there weren't enough courts on
campus available for the men's team to also host the tournament.
So the Stanford men will head across the Bay to Moraga,
where Saint Mary's will host the ITA regionals Saturday through
Tuesday.
All nine Cardinal players will vie for the one singles and one
doubles bid to the ITA National Indoor Championships in Dal
las in two weeks up for grabs this weekend. But for anyone in a
Stanford uniform hoping to earn a ticket to Texas, a long series
of 3-match days and tough opponents awaits.
"This will be a tough tournament," coach Dick Could said.
"California, UCLA and Washington are all good teams, and
they'll all be there. There will be a lot of tennis being played, two
singles games and one doubles every day."
The duo of seniors Scott Lipsky and David Martin, last year's
NCAA individual doubles runners-up, will lead the Cardinal in
the doubles competition. The two reached the finals of the ICY
HOT / ITA Ail-American Championships to start the season
earlier this month.
Martin also looks to lead Stanford in the singles tournament,
coming off of his consolation title at the ,-Mi-Americans.
Sophomore Sam Warburg is coming off his first-career tour
nament win from last weekend's Midland Invitational in Mid
land, Texas. Warburg defeated Tryston Meniane of North Car
olina in three sets in the quarterfinals on Saturday before ad
vancing to the finals with a straight-set win over Pepperdine's
Diego Acuna in the semifinals.
In the finals against Texas Christian'sToni Gordon, the tour
nament's top seed, Warburg battled back after dropping the first
set 7-6 to take the next two 6-3, 6-1 to grab the title.
Senior Carter Morris was the only other Cardinal player to
travel to Midland. Morris fell to Diedrick DeGroot of Texas Tech
7-6,4-6,7-6 in the first round of the singles tournament before the
team of Morris and Warburg lost in the quarterfinals of the dou
bles competition to Texas' Roger Gubsen and Drew Hoskins.
Morris and Warburg will team up again at Saint Mary's this
weekend, while freshmen James Pade and K.C. Korkery will
make up Stanford's third doubles tandem.
All nine Cardinal players will take part in the singles compe
tition, includingjunior Joe Kaoand sophomore PhilSheng, who
will each be making their season debuts.
