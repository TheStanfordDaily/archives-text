# Crew teams face tough competition

### RACHAEL HANLEY 
In the drizzle of the early morning, Stan
ford's two men's eights head out from Red
wood Shores, picking up speed as they move
past docked tugboats and through the shad
ow of a tanker, the "New Auspicious." The
rowers' faces are inscrutable, but it's not hard
to tell that they are focused on the repetitive
movement of practice.
Crew

at the Head of the American, Lake Natoma, Saturday

On Saturday, the Stanford men's and
women's crew teams will face traditional rivals
Sacramento State and UC-Davis at the Head
of the American, but they're not thinking
about that now.
The challenge of racing for five kilometers
down Lake Natoma in a pair, only to finish and
immediately have to row it again in an eight,
does not seem to worry them either. They are
not even particularly concerned that the coach
ing launch is no longer running beside them.
"When you back off and let the guys em
power themselves, it works," explains men's
head coach Craig Amerkhanian.
Amerkhanian's style certainly seems to be
working for Stanford rowers. After compet
ing well at the Head of the Charles in Boston
last weekend, the men are eager to race
against other California schools this weekend
"We're looking to beat Sacramento State and
UC-Davis," said coxswain Christen Young.
The women are also eager to race other

West Coast schools this weekend. Women's
head coach Aiinee Baker said that teams to
watch include UC-Santa Barbara, the Divi
sion II National champions last spring, and
traditional rival California. The women are
particularly looking forward to chasing Cal's
eight, scheduled to start directly ahead of
Stanford.
Last year, the Bears beat the Cardinal in
the Head of the American by five seconds.
Stanford has already shown a strong start this
season by beating Cal by seven seconds at the
Head of the Charles.
" There's a Stanford-Cal thing no matter
what the level," Baker said. "We want to main
tain composure, keep our confidence and
keep pushing. I think we showed in Boston
that we're keen."
Baker said that the lineups for the Head
of the American will be slightly different
than what was used in the Head of the
Charles, however. The varsity A boat will
consist of the eight rowers with the top erg
scores. Baker said that the women compet
ed for best erg scored on Tuesday and that
the boat lineups should be set by the end of
the week.
A relatively straight course, Lake Natoma
should provide a perfect forum for battles
between the competing schools. The loca
tion of the Pacific-10 Conference Champi
onships in May, Lake Natoma has three
long, easy turns that open into a straight line
to the finish.
"There's nothing too extreme."
Amerkhanian said "It's a very comfortable

course.
As the Stanford men and women are rat
ing in the pairs, fours and eights events,
Amerkhanian said that for the men, consecu
tive races will be a bigger factor than the
course shape, as the men will have to hot seat
from one event to the other.
"1 know that we're the only ones in a pair
right before, so that will probably hurt us,"
Amerkhanian said. He added that fall rowing
was not "results directed."
Despite predictions, the rowers are eager
to compete in multiple events on Saturday.
"I want to race as much as possible," said
varsity member Chris Jones.
"It'll be fun to race in pairs. We've never re
ally rowed pairs on this course," added team
mate Brian Belmont.
The women will also be doubling up this
weekend. The six rowers in the pairs compe
tition at 10:30 a.m. will then race again at
noon.
"It shouldn't have much of an effect. These
guys are in great shape," Baker said.
Back on the water, the two eights are
pulling out into the bay and Amerkhanian
tries to use his bullhorn to call the boats to a
stop. Too far away to hear, the eights con
tinue racing down the course, the blades
sending spray into the air as they row.
Watching the rowers, Amerkhanian is
pleased that the men have not paused, or
even slowed down.
"This is a good sign for the team. I like
this," he said. "It's a 10-minute piece, they're
11 minutes in, and they're still going."

immediately have to row it again in an eight,
does not seem to worry them either. They are
not even particularly concerned that the coach
ing launch is no longer running beside them.
"When you back off and let the guys em
power themselves, it works," explains men's
head coach Craig Amerkhanian.
Amerkhanian's style certainly seems to be
working for Stanford rowers. After compet
ing well at the Head of the Charles in Boston
last weekend, the men are eager to race
against other California schools this weekend
"We're looking to beat Sacramento State and
UC-Davis," said coxswain Christen Young.
The women are also eager to race other

West Coast schools this weekend. Women's
head coach Aiinee Baker said that teams to
watch include UC-Santa Barbara, the Divi
sion II National champions last spring, and
traditional rival California. The women are
particularly looking forward to chasing Cal's
eight, scheduled to start directly ahead of
Stanford.
Last year, the Bears beat the Cardinal in
the Head of the American by five seconds.
Stanford has already shown a strong start this
season by beating Cal by seven seconds at the
Head of the Charles.
" There's a Stanford-Cal thing no matter
what the level," Baker said. "We want to main
tain composure, keep our confidence and
keep pushing. I think we showed in Boston
that we're keen."
Baker said that the lineups for the Head
of the American will be slightly different
than what was used in the Head of the
Charles, however. The varsity A boat will
consist of the eight rowers with the top erg
scores. Baker said that the women compet
ed for best erg scored on Tuesday and that
the boat lineups should be set by the end of
the week.
A relatively straight course, Lake Natoma
should provide a perfect forum for battles
between the competing schools. The loca
tion of the Pacific-10 Conference Champi
onships in May, Lake Natoma has three
long, easy turns that open into a straight line
to the finish.
"There's nothing too extreme."
Amerkhanian said "It's a very comfortable

course.
As the Stanford men and women are rat
ing in the pairs, fours and eights events,
Amerkhanian said that for the men, consecu
tive races will be a bigger factor than the
course shape, as the men will have to hot seat
from one event to the other.
"1 know that we're the only ones in a pair
right before, so that will probably hurt us,"
Amerkhanian said. He added that fall rowing
was not "results directed."
Despite predictions, the rowers are eager
to compete in multiple events on Saturday.
"I want to race as much as possible," said
varsity member Chris Jones.
"It'll be fun to race in pairs. We've never re
ally rowed pairs on this course," added team
mate Brian Belmont.
The women will also be doubling up this
weekend. The six rowers in the pairs compe
tition at 10:30 a.m. will then race again at
noon.
"It shouldn't have much of an effect. These
guys are in great shape," Baker said.
Back on the water, the two eights are
pulling out into the bay and Amerkhanian
tries to use his bullhorn to call the boats to a
stop. Too far away to hear, the eights con
tinue racing down the course, the blades
sending spray into the air as they row.
Watching the rowers, Amerkhanian is
pleased that the men have not paused, or
even slowed down.
"This is a good sign for the team. I like
this," he said. "It's a 10-minute piece, they're
11 minutes in, and they're still going."
