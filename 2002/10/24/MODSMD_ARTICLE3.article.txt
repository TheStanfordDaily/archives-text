### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Hundreds of education practitioners, policy
makers, scholars and business leaders attended
a symposium intended to inspire and circulate
new ideas for reforming current education-sys
tem models. The event, entitled "Developing
Educational Entrepreneurship: Redesigning
Schools for the 21st Century," was held yester
day in the Arrillaga Alumni Center.
"The main purpose [of the symposium] is to
draw attention to the need fora different kind of
educational leader that will transform our
schools," said Mo-Yun Lei, the director of the
Stanford Educational Leadership Institute,
which sponsored the symposium.
"The purposes of SELI are to bring about
best practices of business and education and
bring about the best frameworks for manage
ment and design," she said.
Lei said that SELI —a joint initiative on the
part of the School of Education and the Center
for Social Innovation at the Graduate School of
Business with funding from the Goldman Sachs
Foundation —was established to allow educa-

tors to have educational outreach
opportunities through workshops
and symposiums, to generate new
research and to establish new
teaching material such as case
studies.
According to Vivian Drew, a co
ordinator for the Center for Social
Innovation at the Business School,
the day-long symposium had ap
proximately 250 attendees.
"There were representatives
from school districts around Cali
fornia, as well as [members from]
the California State Board of Edu
cation and The National Founda
tion for Teaching Entrepreneur
ship," Drew said.
Drew also noted that the event's
activities would be transcribed for
future reference by educators and
researchers.
"This is our launch event for the
SELI in general — we wanted this
to set the tone for how SELI is
going to proceed," Lei said.
"[SELI's] funder is the Goldman
Sachs Foundation — they gave us
a million dollars over the course of
two years to put the program to
gether and get started."

Members of the different
schools expressed satisfaction so far
with the joint SELI effort.
"The fact that this is a new area
— moving into this new area of fo
cusing on education leadership —
is exciting and fills a need in the
sector," said Julie M. Juergens, the
director for external relations and
program development at the Cen
ter for Social Innovation.
According to Lei, the original
idea fora partnership between the
Business School and the School of
Education to establish SELI was
conceived of by Linda Darling-
Hammond, a professor at the
School of Education.
"It is to exchange information
between those who work in the
business community and educa
tion to make high-performing or
ganizations," Darling-Hammond
said.
"We are at a moment in our his
tory where we need to develop
schools that are much more power
ful learning organizations than
they have been."
Darling-Hammond explained
that she feels that SELI can help fa
cilitate reforms and idea-sharing
concerning the education process.
Jim Phills, a professor at the
Business School who worked with
Darling-Hammond to establish

SELI as both a concept and a reali
ty, felt the symposium went over
well.
"From my perspective, I think it
was an extreme success. We want to
bring together people from the
business and the educational world
to develop leadership in the sector
to make more effective schools,"
Phills said.
"We got a dialogue going and
generated ideas for our upcoming
summer leadership training pro
gram. And it was an education for
me as well — it helps us to be more
grounded."
He expressed his belief that the
symposium will pave the way for
SELI to be able to accomplish its fu
ture goals.
"We are very excited about the
potential to have an impact on a so
cial need and problem, and we are
looking forward to doing things
next summer," Phills said.
Those who attended the sympo
sium appeared to concur with
Phills' sentiments regarding the ef
fectiveness of the event.
"1 thought it was very informa
tive," said Robin Higbee from the
Linscott Charter School. "It was
interesting to have the perspec
tives of people coming from out
side of the traditional educational
box."

teaching material such as case
studies.
According to Vivian Drew, a co
ordinator for the Center for Social
Innovation at the Business School,
the day-long symposium had ap
proximately 250 attendees.
"There were representatives
from school districts around Cali
fornia, as well as [members from]
the California State Board of Edu
cation and The National Founda
tion for Teaching Entrepreneur
ship," Drew said.
Drew also noted that the event's
activities would be transcribed for
future reference by educators and
researchers.
"This is our launch event for the
SELI in general — we wanted this
to set the tone for how SELI is
going to proceed," Lei said.
"[SELI's] funder is the Goldman
Sachs Foundation — they gave us
a million dollars over the course of
two years to put the program to
gether and get started."

Members of the different
schools expressed satisfaction so far
with the joint SELI effort.
"The fact that this is a new area
— moving into this new area of fo
cusing on education leadership —
is exciting and fills a need in the
sector," said Julie M. Juergens, the
director for external relations and
program development at the Cen
ter for Social Innovation.
According to Lei, the original
idea fora partnership between the
Business School and the School of
Education to establish SELI was
conceived of by Linda Darling-
Hammond, a professor at the
School of Education.
"It is to exchange information
between those who work in the
business community and educa
tion to make high-performing or
ganizations," Darling-Hammond
said.
"We are at a moment in our his
tory where we need to develop
schools that are much more power
ful learning organizations than
they have been."
Darling-Hammond explained
that she feels that SELI can help fa
cilitate reforms and idea-sharing
concerning the education process.
Jim Phills, a professor at the
Business School who worked with
Darling-Hammond to establish

SELI as both a concept and a reali
ty, felt the symposium went over
well.
"From my perspective, I think it
was an extreme success. We want to
bring together people from the
business and the educational world
to develop leadership in the sector
to make more effective schools,"
Phills said.
"We got a dialogue going and
generated ideas for our upcoming
summer leadership training pro
gram. And it was an education for
me as well — it helps us to be more
grounded."
He expressed his belief that the
symposium will pave the way for
SELI to be able to accomplish its fu
ture goals.
"We are very excited about the
potential to have an impact on a so
cial need and problem, and we are
looking forward to doing things
next summer," Phills said.
Those who attended the sympo
sium appeared to concur with
Phills' sentiments regarding the ef
fectiveness of the event.
"1 thought it was very informa
tive," said Robin Higbee from the
Linscott Charter School. "It was
interesting to have the perspec
tives of people coming from out
side of the traditional educational
box."
