# Apathy could limit student-voter voice

### SARAH PAPÃ‰ EDITORIAL STAFF 
With the Nov. 5 state and local
elections rapidly approaching,
Santa Clara County voters are
faced with a range of candidates
and ballot measures that could di
rectly affect Stanford and the sur
rounding community. But if stu
dents on campus follow a current
nationwide trend among college
age voters, they will have little to
say about the outcome of the
races.
A recent study conducted by
The Washington Post, the
Henry J. Kaiser Family Founda
tion and Harvard University re
vealed that Americans over the
age of 65 are twice as likely to
vote this year as those under the
age of 30. The study cited politi
cal apathy as part of the prob

voters are moving more fre
quently and waiting longer to
settle down, which "dampens
their civic involvement."
In the case of this year's elec
tions, dampened civic involve

student voice on issues ranging
from water quality to voter regis
tration and on races such as the
California gubernatorial and
District 14 U.S. Representative
elections.
ASSU Chief of Staff Hunter
Margraves noted that students at
Stanford aren't often reminded of
the elections and simply forget to
register or vote.
"Sometimes students won't re
member if they are registered to
vote absentee in another state or
region of California," Hargraves
said.
"With Iraq and a slumping
economy dominating newspaper
headlines, the political conscious

ness of most Stanford students
isn't centered around an event
like the 2002 elections," he con
tinued. "A lot of students don't
have to time or the ability to watch
national news, let alone sit
through campaign advertising."
Mitchell Smith, an administra
tive associate at Stanford who is a
member of the Campus Creens,
added that the isolation of Stan
ford's campus contributes to
voter apathy.
"More than most colleges and
universities, Stanford lias really
isolated itself from much of the sur
