# Apathy could limit student-voter voice
## 
### SARAH PAPÃ‰ EDITORIAL STAFF 
With the Nov. 5 state and local
elections rapidly approaching,
Santa Clara County voters are
faced with a range of candidates
and ballot measures that could di
rectly affect Stanford and the sur
rounding community. But if stu
dents on campus follow a current
nationwide trend among college
age voters, they will have little to
say about the outcome of the
races.
A recent study conducted by
The Washington Post, the
Henry J. Kaiser Family Founda
tion and Harvard University re
vealed that Americans over the
age of 65 are twice as likely to
vote this year as those under the
age of 30. The study cited politi
cal apathy as part of the prob
lem, but emphasized that young
voters are moving more fre
quently and waiting longer to
settle down, which "dampens
their civic involvement."
In the case of this year's elec
tions, dampened civic involve
ment on the part of Stanford stu
dents would translate to a lack of
student voice on issues ranging
from water quality to voter regis
tration and on races such as the
California gubernatorial and
District 14 U.S. Representative
elections.
ASSU Chief of Staff Hunter
Margraves noted that students at
Stanford aren't often reminded of
the elections and simply forget to
register or vote.
"Sometimes students won't re
member if they are registered to
vote absentee in another state or
region of California," Hargraves
said.
"With Iraq and a slumping
economy dominating newspaper
headlines, the political conscious

ness of most Stanford students
isn't centered around an event
like the 2002 elections," he con
tinued. "A lot of students don't
have to time or the ability to watch
national news, let alone sit
through campaign advertising."
Mitchell Smith, an administra
tive associate at Stanford who is a
member of the Campus Creens,
added that the isolation of Stan
ford's campus contributes to
voter apathy.
"More than most colleges and
universities, Stanford lias really
isolated itself from much of the sur
rounding community through its

structure and through its policies."
These obstacles motivated the
ASSU, with the help of Stanford
in Government, College Republi
cans, Stanford Democrats and
Campus Greens, to put together
its "Get Out The Vote" campaign
to move students toward the polls
and to educate them about the is
sues at stake.
"Ideally the goal is to increase
civic participation and see if stu
dents can become politically
aware of how they are represent
ed at all levels of government,"
Hargraves said. "We would like to
see voter turnout in the Stanford
precincts increase dramatically."
The first part of the campaign
was simply to register students, or
re-register students who had pre
viously been registered elsewhere.

"Even students who are regis
tered in other states and who vote
absentee often do not stay in
touch with political news and
events from their hometown,"
Hargraves said.
But some students, like sopho
more Mike Brooks, remain regis
tered in their home state and are
sending in absentee ballots.
"I'm registered in Maryland,
which is where I'm originally
from and where I think I can
make the most informed vote,"
Brooks said.
The GOTV campaign didn't
focus on absentee voting because
Hargraves explained that the
deadlines are different in each
state.
According to Hargraves, ap
proximately 6,000 people were
registered to vote in the Stanford
precincts before the campaign.
Their goal was to register 4,000
students by the voter-registration
deadline, which was Oct. 21.

The campaign has now moved
into its second phase, educating
students to ensure that they know
where candidates stand on issues
and how the different proposi
tions will affect them.
"We're planning some excit
ing campaign events both on and
off campus to encourage Stan
ford students to learn more
about who represents them and
how these elected officials match
up with each student's personal
political ideology," Hargraves
said.
Two election forums will be
held in Kresge to give students an
opportunity to directly hear from
the candidates. On Oct. 30 at 7
p.m., several candidates in the
local and state races will speak to
students and take questions.
Scheduled to be at the forum
are Assemblyman for the 21st dis
trict Joe Simitian (D) and Jim Rus
sell (R), his challenger; Peter
Camejo, the Green Party candi

date for governor; Greg Conlon,
the Republican candidate for
State Treasurer; and Sarah Kar
linsky, a representative from the
Proposition 46 campaign.
On Nov. 3 at 6 p.m., Congress
woman Anne Eshoo and others
will speak on Propositions 47 and
52.
"Voting is the first step to ex
pressing your political opinion,"
Hargraves said. "Too often we
hear of candidates ignoring the
concerns of youth because voters
ages 18-24 are traditionally apolit
ical. But students do care about is
sues like international student
visas, grants for Higher Education
(Pell Grants, CalGrants), accessible
housing and health care and most
recently, international relations.
"Our hope is that by putting
this first step in front of every
Stanford student, we spur each
student to voice their concerns to
their elected representatives,"
Hargraves said.
