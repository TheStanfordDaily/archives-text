For California voters, the time has
come again to evaluate the proposi
tions put before the public. In particu
lar, Proposition 49 presents voters with
the option to significantly increase
funding for before- and after-school
programs.
If passed, Proposition 49 will provide
for the following steps through the After
School Education and Safety Program
Act of 2002: increasing state grant funds
available for before- and after-school
programs providing tutoring, home
work assistance and educational enrich
ment, making public elementary, middle
and junior high schools, including char
ter schools, eligible for grants ranging
from $50,000 to $75,000, and providing
priority for additional funding for
schools with predominantly low-income
students.
Most importantly, the proposition
pronounces that funding for before- and
after-school programs shall be above
Proposition 98 base funding, and at least
$85 million for first year increasing to
$550 million annually il state revenues
grow. In comparison, $95.3 million was
allocated for the Before and After School
Learning and Safe Neighborhoods Part
nership Program as it is now called.
Those in favor of the proposition —
including the California Teachers Asso

ciation, the California State Sheriffs' As
sociation and the California Parent
Teacher Association — claim that this
proposition will make neighborhoods
safe, give children a safe, educational
and recreational place to go after school,
save taxpayers money and help working
families.
"Proposition 49 is funded out of fu
ture growth instate revenues, but only
after our economy has recovered. It will
not require an increase in taxes or affect
the current budget," according to a state
ment issued by those in favor of the
proposition on their Web site.
Many graduate students at Stanford
may feel a personal connection with this
issue because they have children who
may enroll in school in the near future.
Sang-Ho Yun, a graduate student at
Stanford, thinks that this proposition of
fers some good points.
"As a parent of a two-and-a-half-year
old boy, I am concerned about his wel
fare when he is old enough to attend
school," Yun said. "1 came from Korea
and always wished that more funding for
education was possible. This proposition

seems like it would benefit both my child
and many others in the state."
The opposition is equally passionate
in its arguments. Barbara Inatsugu, a
member of the League of Women Voters
of California, argued that the proposi
tion is a "bad approach to a good cause,"
according to the group's Web site.
"Prop 49 looks good, but in reality it
disregards principles of good govern
ment by reducing government's flexi
bility to respond to changing needs and
priorities. Prop 49 would increase the
Proposition 98 guarantee level without
raising additional revenues, so that pro
grams funded outside the guarantee
would be more vulnerable during eco
nomic downturns," she commented.
Some educators, including the Amer
ican Association of University Women,
the California Federation of Teachers
and Assembly member Jac kie Coldberg
all oppose Prop 49 because it could take
money from other education priorities.
Stanford Education Prof. Michael
Kirst agrees with this position.
"The instruction during the regular
day is more important, so the priorities
of this initiative are wrong. Prop [49]
does not add money to [the education
budget], it just redirects money to lower
priority expenditures," he said.
Sang-Ho Yun agrees with the cause of
the proposition, but also shares some of the
concerns brought up by the opposition.
"I am definitely for the additional
funding of before- and after-school pro
grams, but not necessarily at the cost of,
for example, health insurance," Yun
said.

grams, but not necessarily at the cost of,
for example, health insurance," Yun
said.
