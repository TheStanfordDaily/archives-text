# House supports families of ill children
## 
### CHELSEA DUDEK 
Most families will never experience the hard
ship of hav ing a seriously ill child. However, for
some of those who do, the Ronald McDonald
House at Stanford exists to help make this ex
perience a little easier.
The Ronald McDonald House provides a
home away from home and support for families
of children with life-threatening illnesses who
are receiving treatment from the Lncile Packard
Children's Hospital. Currently, the house is un
dergoing construction to meet the increasing
demand for rooms, with housing requests far
exceeding the facility's capacity. Almost 600
families were turned away last year.
To allow more families the opportunity to
stay in the house, 28,000 square feet of new con
struction is currently underway. The expanded
house will be completed in the fall of 2003 and
will include 22 more rooms, a Great Room for
families to gather, a new dedicated Computer
Learning for 111 Kids Room, a Family Research
Library and a Teen Recreation and Children's
Activity Center.
During construction, families stay at an inter
im location nearby.
Honey Meir-Levi, executive director for the
house, said that, "the house is specifically de
signed to foster relationships between families."
Accordingly, there are no televisions in the
rooms, so that people will be encouraged to use
common areas.
"The most important things the families get
from the house are the therapeutic relationships
with people who really know what they are
going through," Meir-Levi said.
Six-year-old Courtney has spent a total of 98
nights at the Ronald McDonald House over the
last three years as she visits the hospital for her
chemotherapy treatments.
"The house has been absolutely wonderful,"
her father, Mike, said. " The warmth and sup
port of the house has made a difficult time for all
of us far more bearable."
The program began in 1973 when McDon
ald's Restaurants' owners / operators joined
with the Philadelphia Eagles Football Club to

found the first Ronald McDonald House. There
are now more than 200 other houses world
wide.
Since more than 70 percent of these families
are of low to moderate income, the room fee is
only $10 per night. This is possible because 10
percent of the operating budget is provided by
Bay Area McDonald's owner / operators, and
another 80 percent is provided by community
members and businesses.
Located within one mile of the Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital, the Ronald Mc-
Donald House provides inexpensive housing to
pediatric patients and their families. It was built
in 1979, making it the fifth such house in the
country. Since then, the house has grown to a
stall of seven employees and 150 volunteers
who serve about 1,000 families every year.
To be eligible fora room at the house, the

child must be receiving treatment at the hospi
tal and be 18 years old or younger. The family
must live at least 50 miles away 112 rom the house.
While the house does serve children being
treated at the hospital, it is not a hospital in itself.
Medical treatment is not provided by the
Ronald McDonald House, though medical pro
cedures that would be done in a person's home
are permitted.
Originally, the purpose of the house was to
provide a way for out-of-town families to be near
the hospital where their children were being
treated. Due to the evolution of health care,
children are more commonly being treated as
out-patients, and so a higher number of ill chil
dren also stay in the house than in previous
years. Many children who stay in the house are

awaiting a transplant.
The average stay at the house is
six days, but there are also many
long-term stays â€” many families
stay for one month or more. Due
to this increase in length of stay,
families need more social activity.
With only seven paid employ
ees, the Ronald McDonald House
relies heavily on volunteers to re
main in operation. Volunteers
commit to work for six months for

a minimum of three hours a week.
This time commitment enables
families to have consistency in the
people they deal with in the house,
which makes staying in there more
comfortable.
There is also a need for special
event volunteers to work on a one
time basis. According to Meir-Levi,
"When the house re-opens, there
will be more of a need of support
from the Stanford student body
than ever before."
