# Language division begins to come together
## 
### MICHELLE KELLER EDITORIAL STAFF 
Last year, after years of disput
ing and reorganizing, six School of
Humanities and Sciences depart
ments merged to form the Division
of Literatures, Cultures and Lan
guages. Faculty generally seem sat

isfied with the merger's results but
are waiting to see what the future
holds before making any definite
judgments about the success of the
fledgling division.
The six departments under the
division are: Asian Languages,
Comparative Literature, French
and Italian, German Studies, Slav

it Languages and Literature, and
Spanish and Portuguese.
"An array of committees has
begun to operate across the de
partment," said German and
Comparative Literature Professor
Russell Berman. "However, we are
only six weeks into the [academic]
year, so we will have to see how
things pan out."
Three separate committees run
the division: a graduate studies
committee, an undergraduate stud
ies committee, and the planning
and personal committee, which
oversees long-range planning.
French and Comparative Liter
ature Prof. Sepp Gumbrecht
echoed Berman's statement, yet
expressed his satisfaction with cur
rent progress.
" The committees are merely be
ginning to function — so we will
have to see," Gumbrecht said. "I
get the impression that everybody
is happy that after almost a decade
of discussions, fights and uncer
tainty is over now. Seen from this
perspective, things can only get
better."
While the departments remain
largely autonomous, the creation
of the division will serve to "draw
on the combined resources of the
DLCL to develop joint programs
and represent common interests,"
according to the division Web site.
So far this year, most of the
changes have been quite small.
The real changes will take place
next year, explained Head of the
Division Roland Greene, a profes
sor of English and comparative lit
erature.

One recent change was to cre
ate a group for graduate students
across the divisions to receive
proper advising 011 the disserta
tion process.
"This has been a huge success,"
Greene said. "They were hungry
for something like that, and I think
they will benefit from [this group]
in many ways."
More serious changes are
planned for the 2003-2004 acade
mic year, after a thorough evalua
tion process by the various com
mittees.
"This year we started a process
to evaluate the different depart
ments and figure out things that
could be done better at one level or
another," said Greene, who also
serves as head of the planning and
personnel committee.
"We are figuring out that even
after years of operating side-by
side, departments hadn't really
learned from each other on many
matters. Now that we are working
as a division, we can evaluate the
different requirements of each de
partment, the way that their pro
grams are structured — we are
working to evaluate everything,"
he added.
The current structure of the di
vision represents the final compro
mise after decades-long argu
ments and discussions, and al
though some faculty last year saw
the final organization of the divi
sion as their second-choice alter
native, the current year shows
much promise.

"I think ... the structure and
the spirit of the new division are as
democratic as it gets," Gumbrecht
said.
"All departments . . . should
feel well represented. 1 think that
the mood in both [the French and
Italian, and Comparative Litera
ture departments] is better than I
have seen in a long time. This is
certainly partly due to the two ex
cellent chairs we have: [French
Prof.] Robert Harrison and [Com
parative Literature Prof.] Haun
Saussy," he added.

The division also contains a Re
search Unit, which is "dedicated to
advancing the research programs
ofDLCL faculty and graduate stu
dents," states the DLCL Web site.
The unit will work with the rest of
the department to present events
to students and the general com
munity.
On Nov. 1, the division will
present "Visuality at Degree
Zero: Picasso and Carl Einstein,
1928," with guest professor and
Chair of Modern Art at UC-
Berkeley Timothy J. Clark. The
workshop will work to fuse the
different types of media — lan
guage, modern art, and literature
— in an attempt to understand
the culture of modernity.
