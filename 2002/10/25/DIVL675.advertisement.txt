The Stanford Recycling Program has been awarded the
Outstanding School Program Award
FROM THE NATIOHAL RECYCLING COALITION.
The recycling efforts here at Stanford are improving our environment every day. With your help, Stanford has recy
cled, composted, or otherwise source reduced 53% of its waste in 2001. The results are clear: cleaner air and
water, less pollution, more forested land and open space, and reduced greenhouse gases.
The 4011 Ions of paper, glass, metals and plastic Stanford recycled in 2001 saved a total of
about 45,000 BTUs of energy, enough energy to power nearly 446 homes for one year,
more than half of the homes on campus.
Last year, recycling reduced overall air emissions by 11 3 tons excluding C02 and methane or 4975 tons including
C02 and methane and reduce waterborne waste by 18.5 tons.
Stanford's recycling efforts last year reduced
greenhouse gas emissions by about 2852 metric tons of carbon equivalent.
By recycling over 3100 tons of paper last year, Stanford saved 51,373 trees. Stanford reduced the need for 1 45
tons of iron ore, coal, and limestone by recycling over 440 tons of metal
