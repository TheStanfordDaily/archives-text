### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Princess Christina of Sweden
and former Secretary of State
George Shultz were among the
many dignitaries present for yes
terday evening's reopening cere
mony of Building 160 — which
was renamed Wallenberg Hall.
The renovated building will offer
learning spaces for Stanford class
es in addition to innovative facili
ties for educational research.
Sweden's Knut and Alice Wal
lenberg Foundation and the Mari
anne and Marcus Wallenberg
Foundation donated $15 million
to Stanford in 1999 to support the
renovation effort. While the out
side sandstone walls of the struc
ture were kept intact, the inside
was completely reconstructed and
redesigned.
The building, which was origi
nally constructed in the late 19th
century, formerly housed Stan
ford's Political Science Department.

Those involved with the project
hope that the new research re
sources within the building will
lead to significant changes in edu
cational practices.
"We believed that universities
have changed too little," said for
mer University President Gerhard
Casper. "What the Wallenberg
Foundation did, and what they are
doing now personally in support
ing this effort, was to act on their
insight — that learning would be
global. Someone had to do some
thing — not just talk about it."
According to the Stanford Uni
versity Web site, the new building
will house the Stanford Center for
Innovations in Learning, the Stan
ford Humanities Lab and Media-
X, "a new initiative that focuses on
interdisciplinary research about
interactive technology."
"The goal was to have a build
ing that would allow us to con
duct research about learning,"
said Provost John Etchemendy.
"We are proud that this building

bears the Wallenberg name. I am
excited by this venture, as I know
my colleagues are throughout
the University."
State-of-the-art computer tech
nology has been integrated into
rooms throughout the building to
allow for unique functionality such
as room options that are able to be
reconfigured to match the needs
of educators, large wall displays
that double as recording white
boards, and videoconference and
presentation capabilities.
"Students today have a very dif
ferent experience than they [had]
even a decade ago; they will be
challenged ways students 10 to 20
years ago could not even imagine,"
said Vice Provost for Undergradu
ate Education John Bravman. "I
am hoping — many are hoping —
that out of the work out of Wallen
berg Hall will be paradigm-chang
ing technologies that will allow us
to leave behind traditional modes
of education and move on to some
thing better."

Peter Wallenberg, chairman of
both of the Wallenberg founda
tions that donated to the project,
discussed why he felt such a build
ing was needed.
"For many years, many people
in many countries have had a lot to
say about the standards of educa
tion," Wallenberg said. "It has been
left, to a large extent, to the individ
ual people to react to what they say
as being the highly centralized prin
ciple of how to educate young peo
ple. More and more, people be
came critical of the shortcomings of
what was going on. It ended up
with us thinking that there had to
be a new way ... as opposed to
something that we have brought
down over generations."
Wallenberg explained that the
currently embraced education sys
tem that puts professors apart
from pupils largely grew out of
early teaching efforts by churches.
"We tend to forget that early
schooling was in the hands of the
clergy," Wallenberg said. "They
preached — they were the only
ones in the beginning who knew
anything, so there was no ex
change of views . . . There has to
be something more modern than
this. Look at all the development
we have around us. Everyday we
have new ideas coming forth, but
our education system remains rel
atively the same."
Shultz, a Hoover fellow and a
professor emeritus at the Gradu
ate School of Business, also spoke
at the event.
"I hope for the unexpected, be
cause it seems to me in an enter
prise like this that if you don't find
things that you don't expect, you
aren't doing it right," Shultz said.

During his address, Shultz dis
cussed the innovations that the
Wallenberg family has brought
about in the past, noting their
"compassion, ingenuity, capacity
for sheer brass and daring . . . and
boundless energy." He additional
ly expressed personal gratitude
for the donations to Stanford.
"I see this center and the Wal
lenbergs lilting together so well be
cause of [their] characteristics,"
Shultz said. "I am proud of my uni
versity and all that it does. Now, I
am doubly proud to have a univer
sity that also carries a name that has
depth and boundless meaning —
the name Wallenberg."
Casper concurred with Slniltz's
sentiments concerning the cre
ative nature of the center.
"There have been more
changes in the teaching and
learning environment over the
past decade — with the excep
tion of the book — over the last

millennium," Casper said. "I
have indeed been awed and con
tinue to be awed on a daily basis.
A splendid combination of an
cient Stanford and modern Swe
den, Wallenberg Hall is one of
the many outcomes of the very
hard work of many Swedish and
Stanford friends . . . The one
mistake we must not make is to
slacken in our determination."
At the end of the dedication cer
emony, keys to the building were
presented by Etchemendy to
Princess Christina of Sweden and
Wallenberg.
Etchemendy expressed en
thusiasm about the University's
opportunity to work with the
new facility.
"Let's add the best people and
the best minds and see what hap
pens," Etchemendy said. "Thank
you to all of you who have given us
this vote of confidence and have
made Wallenberg Hall a reality."
