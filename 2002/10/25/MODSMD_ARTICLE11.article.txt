# Survey to help prioritize ASSU's resources
## Questions aim to aid ASSU in understanding student concerns 
### MATT ZAFRA 
Last week, the ASSU e-mailed the student
body inviting it to participate in this year's SurF
survey. SurF, which stands for Survey the
Farm, asks students to rank and fill in concerns
about various issues on campus. The survey
asked students to prioritize a wide range of stu

said sophomore Nancy McKeown.
Other students noted that the survey, billed
as a five-minute process, lasted much longer,
considering the heavy significance of many of

the issues.
Yet the survey's first question on prioritizing
campus issues is designed to offer the ASSU Ex
ecutive Cabinet a practical way to learn the top
concerns of the entire student population. De
spite its shortcomings as a means of questioning,
the ranking is crucial for this purpose.
Because of their limited terms in office —
about five months — members of the ASSU ex
ecutive staff said that they want to tackle core is
sues as effectively as possible.
"The initial question will provide quantitative
evidence as to which issues the ASSU, with its
limited resources, ought to respond to first," said
Joseph Natoli, ASSU communications director,
"if one of the options is overwhelmingly chosen
as the top choice by students, it will serve as an in-
