# Survey to help prioritize ASSU's resources
## Questions aim to aid ASSU in understanding student concerns 
### MATT ZAFRA 
Last week, the ASSU e-mailed the student
body inviting it to participate in this year's SurF
survey. SurF, which stands for Survey the
Farm, asks students to rank and fill in concerns
about various issues on campus. The survey
asked students to prioritize a wide range of stu
dent concerns, from personal safety to under
graduate advising.
As of earlier this week, about 10 percent of the
student population, graduate and undergradu
ate, had taken the survey online.
The subjects were arranged in categories
including student groups, the arts and cam

pus diversity, with several questions focus
ing on whether students would support pos
sible new programs in transportation and
other departments.
Survey-takers were also asked to give input
on other issues, including student space on cam
pus, cost of living, community-center funding
and how well campus offices listen to students.
Some students objected to the survey's rank
ing system, arguing that those who don't know
or care about certain issues would rank them of
lower interest even though they might deserve
more careful consideration.
"I couldn't see how some of the questions per
tained to me or what they were really asking,"
said sophomore Nancy McKeown.
Other students noted that the survey, billed
as a five-minute process, lasted much longer,
considering the heavy significance of many of

the issues.
Yet the survey's first question on prioritizing
campus issues is designed to offer the ASSU Ex
ecutive Cabinet a practical way to learn the top
concerns of the entire student population. De
spite its shortcomings as a means of questioning,
the ranking is crucial for this purpose.
Because of their limited terms in office —
about five months — members of the ASSU ex
ecutive staff said that they want to tackle core is
sues as effectively as possible.
"The initial question will provide quantitative
evidence as to which issues the ASSU, with its
limited resources, ought to respond to first," said
Joseph Natoli, ASSU communications director,
"if one of the options is overwhelmingly chosen
as the top choice by students, it will serve as an in-
credible tool when negotiating with
the administration."
ASSU President Monica 1 Idle
st roza said the "SurF results will be
used by ASSU officials to further re
fine our agenda and as information
for our advocacy efforts to increase
student activities space, lower the
cost of living and ensure Stanford
addresses students' cultural, intel
lectual and social needs."
The survey is expected to be up
until this Sunday after a short delay
in the original timing. Students
who fill it out are eligible for prizes
to be given out next week.
The results of the survey will be
placed online, as an "executive
summary to the general public,"
on the ASSU Web site in the com
ing months.
