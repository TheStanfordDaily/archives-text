### HEATHER MURPHY THE GEORGETOWN VOICE 
(U-WIRE) WASHINGTON,
D.C. â€” As the clock struck 1 on
Wednesday, approximately 65
Georgetown University students
"died" for 15 minutes in Red
Square, lying motionless on the
red bricks to protest the potential
war on Iraq. Protest leaders spoke
against U.S. involvement in Iraq as
more than 60 students looked on.
The "die-in," sponsored by the
Muslim Student Association, Cam
pus Greens, the Young Arab
Leadership Alliance and George
town Peace Action is part of "Don't
Attack Iraq Week" and "Human
Rights Week," sponsored by the
Muslim Student Association.
"If you are against (he war on

Iraq, then please join us in dying
in. All you have to do is fall down
now," said Emil Totonshi (SFS
'06), prompting the gathered stu
dents to lay down simultaneously.
Organizers distributed anti
war pamphlets to onlookers, as
Totonshi, Shadi Hamid (SFS '05)
and Nabeel Yousef (SFS '05) took
turns speaking.
"We are dying to represent
more than 1 million Iraqi civilians,
mostly children, who have died
due to U.S.-led sanctions since the
Gulf War," Totonshi said. "Iraqi
civilians, or rather, all human be
ings, are not collateral damage."
Montana Ray (GAS '06) and
two friends entered Red Square
after the die-in started.
"1 had seen fliers and 1 was just
walking by. I think that the pur
pose was to draw attention to the
casualties," Ray said.
Ray said the visual demonstra
tion encouraged her to lay down
and join the protest. She said she
feels a lot of Georgetown students
are not aware of what is going on.
"We are protesting the imperi
alist and hawkish policies of the
Bush administration towards Iraq
... a war which the Bush adminis
tration already seems determined
to wage," 1 {amid, co-coordinator
of Human Rights Week, said.
Hamid said he hopes to draw
support for the downtown demon
strations scheduled for Saturday.
Ray said she does not know if
she will participate on Saturday.

Hamid said he was happy with
(he outcome of Wednesday's event.
"We were hoping for 40, we
ended up getting 70 people dying
in. You could tell people were in
terested. We wanted people to lis
ten and hear. This is the first step in
developing a really great anti-war
movement. We want to promote a
more proactive campus culture."
Student observer Pradeep Ra
mamurthy (SFS '03) said, "I think
this is the most effective method
because it's nonviolent and not in
trusive. The diversity of people
here make it a successful protest."
On Wednesday night a group
of College Republicans placed
pro-war signs above the anti-war
signs in Red Square.
Dave Benjamin, the communi
cations director of the College Re
publicans, passed through
Wednesday's die-in. Benjamin said
he feels that the pro-war group is a
silent majority on campus.
