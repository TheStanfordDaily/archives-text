### HEATHER MURPHY THE GEORGETOWN VOICE 
(U-WIRE) WASHINGTON,
D.C. â€” As the clock struck 1 on
Wednesday, approximately 65
Georgetown University students
"died" for 15 minutes in Red
Square, lying motionless on the
red bricks to protest the potential
war on Iraq. Protest leaders spoke
against U.S. involvement in Iraq as
more than 60 students looked on.
The "die-in," sponsored by the
Muslim Student Association, Cam
pus Greens, the Young Arab
Leadership Alliance and George
town Peace Action is part of "Don't
Attack Iraq Week" and "Human
Rights Week," sponsored by the
Muslim Student Association.
"If you are against (he war on

Iraq, then please join us in dying
in. All you have to do is fall down
now," said Emil Totonshi (SFS
'06), prompting the gathered stu
dents to lay down simultaneously.
Organizers distributed anti
war pamphlets to onlookers, as
Totonshi, Shadi Hamid (SFS '05)
and Nabeel Yousef (SFS '05) took
turns speaking.
"We are dying to represent
more than 1 million Iraqi civilians,
mostly children, who have died
due to U.S.-led sanctions since the
Gulf War," Totonshi said. "Iraqi
civilians, or rather, all human be
ings, are not collateral damage."
Montana Ray (GAS '06) and
two friends entered Red Square
after the die-in started.
