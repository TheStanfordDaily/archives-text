## Police arrest two men in sniper case 
### 
ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) — One of
America's most extraordinary manhunts
culminated yesterday in ihe arrests of an
Army veteran and a teenager, asleep at a
roadside rest stop — perpetrators, au
thorities believe, of a bloody, three-week
sniping spree that left 10 people dead
and multitudes paralyzed by fear.
John Allen Muhammad, 41 —arrest-
ed with 17-year-old John Lee Malvo —
appeared in court, and was ordered
held without bail. Both, said Mont
gomery County Police Chief Charles
Moose, are considered suspects in the
sniper attacks.
A gun found in the suspects'car — a
Bushmaster AR-15 rifle — had been
linked by ballistics to 1 1 of the 14
Washington-are shootings, including
one iu which no one was injured, said
Michael Bouchard, an agent with the
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms.
The AR-15 is the civilian form of the
M-lf) military assault rifle. As a soldier,
Muhammad received a Marksmanship
Badge with expert rating — the highest
of three ratings —in use of the M-1 (5, ac
cording to Army records. Police also
found a scope and tripod in the car, a law
enforcement source said.
In handcuffs and a green prison
jumpsuit, Muhammad appeared in a
Baltimore federal courthouse patrolled
by a dozen federal marshals armed with
high-powered rifles.
Muhammad is due back in court Tues
day on a federal firearms charge stem

ming from a 2000 court order in Tacoma,
Wash., that barred Muhammad from ha
rassing or using force against an ex-wife
and their children.
U.S. District Court Magistrate Beth P.
Gesnei" made no mention of the sniper
killings. Muhammad spoke little during
the 10-minute hearing. When Gesner
asked if he understood the charge, he
quietly answered, "Yes, ma'am."
Malvo is considered by the court to be
a juvenile, and all of his proceedings are
closed. Police said he was being held as a
material witness, pending charges, and
they did not identify him.
A law enforcement oHicial, speaking
on condition of anonymity, outlined de
velopments that led to the arrests:
On Thursday, Oct. 17, a Montgomery
County, Md., public information officer

received a call from someone they now
believe was the sniper. The caller re
ferred to a robbery-homicide in "Mont
gomery" — not, in itself, enough to
prompt authorities to call police in that
Alabama city.
The next day, a priest in Ashland, Va.,
received a call from someone who said he
was God and mentioned a crime in Mont
gomery, Ala., according to the Rev. Pat
Apuzzo, spokesman for the Catholic Dio
cese of Richmond. Apuzzo said the priest,
Monsignor William V. Sullivan, dis
missed the call as a prank.
After a shooting in Ashland Saturday,
task force members visited Sullivan at his
church Sunday, according to Apuzzo,
and the priest told them about the call.
Montgomery, Ala., police said they
were contacted by the task force Sunday.
