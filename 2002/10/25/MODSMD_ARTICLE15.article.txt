MOSCOW (AP) — Chechen rebels
holding hundreds of hostages at a Moscow
theater have agreed to release 75 foreign
captives, a security official said early today.
But more than 500 Chechen and Russian
hostages will remain inside as the siege en
tered its second night.
The rebels, who have threatened to kill
the hostages unless the Russian army pulls
out of Chechnya, earlier killed a woman
hostage.
Embassies were being requested to send
representatives to the scene to meet their
freed citizens, Federal Security Service
spokesman Sergei Ignatchenko said. The
foreign hostages include three Americans,
as well as Britons, Dutch, Australians, Aus
trians and Germans.
The releases were to happen at 9 a.m.
local time, Interfax news agency reported.
Early today, three male captors ap
peared on Russia's N TV network wearing
camouflage and carrying assault rifles. The

one unmasked man was identified by NTV
as ringleader Movsar llarayev, a nephew of
rebel warlord Arbi Barayev, who reported
ly died last year.
The network, whose crew was allowed to
accompany a doctor inside the theater, also
showed two female hostage-takers wearing
head-to-toe robes thai revealed only their
eyes. Arabic script was printed on their
hoods, they cradled pistols on their chests
and wore what appeared to be explosives
taped to their waists and wired to a small
button they carried in their hands.
The captors made no comments in the
footage shown, which later included a brief
shot <>! a group of six women hostages
guarded by one of the female attackers.
The drama began Wednesday when as
many as 50 attackers, some of them women
who claimed to be widows of ethnic
Chechen insurgents, stormed the theater
just before the second act of a popular mu
sical at 9:05 p.m.
