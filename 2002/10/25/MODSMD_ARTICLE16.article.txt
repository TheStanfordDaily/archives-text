# Israeli troops raid Jenin

JERUSALEM (AP) â€” Hundreds of Is
raeli troops entered the West Bank town of
Jenin early today in response to a Palestin
ian suicide bombing that killed 17 people
earlier in the week, the military said. The
incursion came just after a U.S. envoy fin
ished his first round of talks about a new
Mideast peace plan.
I'he troops and 16 armored vehicles
moved into Jenin, at the northern edge of
the West Bank, before daybreak, witnesses
said. The military linked the raid to a
bloody Palestinian suicide bombing attack
in Israel's north on Monday.
Palestinians said the troops took over
several buildings at the entrance to the
town, but the governor and local militia

leaders said there was no large-scale opera
tion in progress. No clashes or casualties
were reported.
Retaliation by the Israelis had been
widely expected after the violent Islamic
Jihad group claimed responsibility for the
bombing on Monday, naming two
teenagers from Jenin as the attackers. They
blew up a car filled with about 220 pounds
of explosives next to a bus.
But Israel had held oil with the U.S.
envoy, Assistant Secretary of State William
Burns, in the region. Israeli forces had
pulled out of Jenin just a lew days before the
blast, following a three-month occupation.
Burns met separately with officials from
both sides Wednesday and yesterday.
