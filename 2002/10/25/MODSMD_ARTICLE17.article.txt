## The Stanford Daily PASU's work with airport screeners sets good example
### 
Published Since JB9l

On Nov. 19 the Aviation Trans
portation and Security Act will
come into effect, requiring that
all baggage screeners be federal
employees and therefore U.S. citizens. After
Sept. 11, the Bush administration passed
the act in an attempt to assuage the public's
fear of flying and increase the sense of secu
rity for passengers.
However, we feel that the act will in fact
jeopardize security, while preventing thou
sands of fully qualified employees from re
taining their jobs. We applaud Stanford's
Pilipino American Students Association for
taking up the cause of the screeners and
working for several months with members
of the Bay Area Pilipino community to fight
this injustice.
Over 50 percent of airport screeners

around the United States are immigrants
â€” a proportion that is higher in the three
Bay Area airports. These screeners will
be losing their jobs because the new fed
eralized positions require that all screen
ers be U.S. citizens.
As members of the flying public, the Stan
ford community should be concerned with
the kind of security that we will be getting
with new federalized screeners, some with
little or no experience.
When one considers that thousands of
screeners with years of experience will be
replaced with people who have had only a
few months of training, it becomes clear that
the act has nothing to do with security for
passengers and much more with finding a
scapegoat community for the attacks.
As illustrated by the new regulations on

student visas, this scapegoat community is
the immigrant community. In a sense, it's as
if current baggage screeners are being
blamed for Sept. 11, even though the blades
carried by the terrorists onto the plane were
of a permissible length under the regula
tions in place at the time. Furthermore, by
including a U.S. citizenship requirement,
the Bush administration is implying that
immigrants are somehow less trustworthy
or loyal than U.S. citizens.
This is not only racist, it is preposterous,
considering that about 50,000 immigrants
serve in the U.S. Armed Forces. In fact, the
soldiers who hold guns behind the baggage
screeners are allowed to be immigrants.
In the Bay Area, the majority of the
screeners working in the three airports are
from the Pilipino community. PASU mem-

bers have been doing more than just at
tending rallies and making phone calls to
officials. They have also been part of the or
ganizing committee working directly with
the screeners who are losing their jobs to try
to find a solution.
PASU provides an example for all stu
dent organizations on campus, as it has
connected itself with larger issues facing
the community and is acting on them.
PASU has also rallied support on campus
by helping groups like the Students for
Environmental Action at Stanford and the
Stanford Labor Action Coalition get in
volved. PASU shows the importance of
Stanford's ethnic community organiza
tions, as they help connect the campus
with the issues facing members of the
broader community.
