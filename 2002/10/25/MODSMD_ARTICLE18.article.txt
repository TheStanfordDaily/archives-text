# THE 						WAY I SEE IT
## Questioning terrorism 
### 
On Friday night I was walking back
home when it got really cold, and
though most of my body was
warmly covered, my head was
not. You lose most of your heat through
your head and your toes, I think, and 1 was
wearing open-toed shoes (much to my com
panion's dismay â€” he hates toes) and no
hat. 1 was really freezing.
But I did have on my trusty pashmina
scarf, and 1 thought I would just wrap it
around my head to feel warmer. So I put on
the scarf and then turn to my friend who
exclaims, "Oh, wow. You look like an
Arab." Which, in itself, is obviously not a
bad thing. But of course the next thought
on my mind is: So, to the average non-Arab
American who sees me walking down the
street right now, what do I represent? It cx-

an t ed to me then that the
United States is practically
at war with Iraq right
now, and I wondered if it
was even safe for me to be
sporting this look.
This reminded me of
another time in my life
when the way you lcx)ked
relative to where you were

really could just mess up your day: 1 grew
up under apartheid. In 19H(i I was five years
old. The wliite government in my country,
South Af ric a, declared a state of emergency
that year. The president was an evil, evil
man named P.W. Botha. All I remember of
him was his nose and how much everyone I
knew hated him. During a state of emer
gency, martial law takes over, so the military
is basically free to do what it wishes. Because
I was only five, I didn't feel the worst of it. To
me, this "state of emergency" meant that
mommy was always talking about being
scared that the violence would get worse. It
meant that on the way to school you some
times had to wait longer in traffic on some of
the roads, because the army would have put
up blockades, and sometimes you had to
take detours for that same reason.
Like I said, I didn't feel the worst of it,
since I was so young, hut my siblings had a
different experience. They were all in
high school at the time. The army was al
ways around the high schools, because stu
dents were seen to be a big threat, because
they were young and literate and passion
ate about the cause of freedom. The mili
tary would show up at a school where
some students were marching or protest
ing (unarmed) and get them to "disperse
in 'tO seconds" by firing rubber bullets at
them, sometimes even as they ran away.
They did this because the student upris
ings had to be quelled, just like all the other
ac ts of "terrorism" in the country. Anyone
who opposed the workings of the apartheid
government could lx'c lassified as a terrorist
and arrested without trial under the Ter
rorism Act. These prisoners were often
killed in detention. So if you were black, and
you didn't like the fact that you couldn't get
an education lx*yond ;i c ertain level, or that

you couldn't take your wife to eat at most
nice restaurants, or that you couldn't swim
in public pools except on certain days (the
clay of the week before the pool got cleaned),
and so on, then technically, you were a ter
rorist. You could be a white terrorist too, if
you were of the inclination that the system
that afforded you privilege was wrong.
As a five-year-old, I thought that this was
just the way that life was, and 1 couldn't un
derstand why my family kept talking about
how bad and how wrong the system was. My
view was, since this is how it is and how it's
going to be, why do you make yourself sad
by talking about it so much? Surely it's not
going to change.
But it did change, and I can sit here and
write about it now. In 19861 would not have
been able to say any of what I just explained
above. That would count as terrorism. In
2002, I wonder how terrorism impacts me
now. Clan I walk around "looking like an
Arab?" Clan I say that I don't like the idea of
the U.S. bombing Iraq? Do either of those
actions make me a terrorist? I'm thinking
about non-Arab Muslims, or non-Muslim
Arabs for that matter. What has their expe
rience been in the U.S. since Sept. 11? I'm
thinking about five-year-old kids growing
up thinking it's normal to go to school amid
military forces. I don't want little kids to
know what that's like, wherever they are in
the world.
I was on campus on Sept. 11. I heard
about it while taking a shower in the morn
ing, and I spent ihe rest of the day confused
and shocked, and quite frankly, terrified,
just like most of the people around meat the
time. The fact that I am not American did
not detract from how deeply the events that
Tuesday affected me, because, to me, it's
about people, not governments, and 1 knew
of quite a few people who could have been
killed, on that clay.
So, in writing this, I'm not trying to get
into the politics of who made whom angry
first or who is under threat from whom. I'm
thinking about five-year-old kids growing
up thinking that it's normal to go to school
amid military forces. I don't want them to
know what that's like, whether they're
Rwandan, American, Yugoslavian or Iraqi,
so I do not support bombings, or crashes, or
anything else that makes ordinary people
live in fear of going about their daily lives. It's
not nearly like that in America right now, but
already restrictions on Americans' freedoms
have been put in place, through racial pro
filing and monitoring of particular universi
ty faculty members, among other things.
Americans are very proud to lx> able to
call this country the land of the free, and
they should be, because freedom is never to
be taken for granted. But willi all the con
cern about wiping out terrorism within and
beyond U.S. borders, I just wonder to what
degree within this country that very free
dom is Ix'ing taken away.
