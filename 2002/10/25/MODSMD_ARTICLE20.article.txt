Bhalla's column 'hardly an improvemenf
on the editorial'
Angacl Bhalla's recent [column] was ut
terly confusing ("Controversial views
should be respected," Oct. 24).
Bhalla first states that the inclusion of
an Amiri Baraka excerpt might be seen as
an endorsement of the view that Baraka's
poetry is controversial. According to Bhal
la, this was unintentional.
In a misguided attempt at rectifying the
error, Bhalla includes a controversial quo
tation by Ehud Barak. So, if the inclusion
of the Baraka excerpt was"in no way in
tended to reinforce the claim that these
lines are offensive," why the two-line Ehud
Barak quote?
Effectively, he endorses the view that
both Barak and Baraka are controversial.
Hardly an improvement on the editorial.

'All the cool people windsurf'
I am writing in response to Jessica
Wang's article concerning Seventeen
Magazine's "Coolest College" rankings
("Magazine ranks Stanford fourth-coolest
college," Oct. 23). I specifically want to ad
dress the comments made by freshman
Sarah Teng, who is quoted in the article as
saying, "And do you know anyone who
windsurfs? Because I sure don't."
While there is no doubt that windsurfing
makes Stanford one of the coolest colleges in
the United States, I believe it is my responsi
bility to ensure the facts are kept straight.
First, I am not going to imply that Sev

enteen's research and rankings are total
bunk, but we have not offered windsurfing
as a "for-credit sport" since we split from
the Athletics Department about seven
years ago.
Second, all the cool people windsurf. If
you want to be cool too, you should know
we offer windsurfing lessons to beginners
every spring on campus. And, yes, the
classes are quite popular, with more than
a hundred students signing up annually.
The club also has frequent outings to the
bay and ocean for official members. For
more information, please check out:

Bush's reputation as 'an idiot' has
been well earned
I was disappointed to read Craig Al
brecht's column ("In Defense of George
Bush," Oct. 24). While I can appreciate
that the Daily staff wants to maintain some
amount of diversity on its opinion pages
by occasionally throwing a bone to conser
vatives like Albrecht, they could have
picked a piece with a more insightful ar
gument than Albrecht's bemoaning of
how unkindly the "liberal intellectuals"
treat our president.
Preposterously, Albrecht implies that
the elitist, ivory tower-dwelling liberals are
in fact responsible for Bush's reputation as
an idiot. The truth is that this kiticl of rep
utation can only be earned, and Bush has
done more than enough to deserve it.

Why are intelligent people so hard on
Bush? I think it's an expression of frustration:
Many Americans still have trouble accepting
the reality that the leader of the free world is
a moron, and he's screwing up our country.
Bush is the "knight-errant of Arthurian leg
end?" More like Steve Sanders of "9()210."
Like the t-shirt says: Not My President.

Comic strip based on 'common miscon
ceptions' regarding Catholic Church
1 often hesitate to comment when the
Catholic Church and its faith are publicly
attacked. We have been attacked through
out time: by the Romans in the early
Church, at the beginning of our nation
and randomly on campus through e-mail
lists and comics in The Daily.
Andrew Nielsen's comic on Monday,
regarding the Catholic Church and the
Pope, is based on common misconceptions.
Despite this, Nielsen continues to propa
gate ignorant ideas.
1 suggest reading the papal encyclicals
that are issued by the Vatican to under
stand the Church's stance.
I his comic also brings another issue to
the Stanford campus. Why is it still con
sidered politically correct to attack and de
value a religious faith? But not only that,
why is the Catholic faith often a subject of
humor? The problems of the Church
today are a matter of concern, not humor.
