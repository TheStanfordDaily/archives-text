# Cardinal Today
## Football primed for UCLA 
### MATT LONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Midterms are upon the Stanford
campus, which means the Cardi
nal's football season is half over.
Stanford (2-4, 1-2 Pacific-10 Con
ference) has yet another tough con
ference test this weekend, when it
travels to UCLA (4-3, 1-2). Both
teams will have to answer quarter
back questions Saturday, as injuries
plague their respective starters.
The Cardinal's signalcaller, ju
nior Chris Lewis, suffered an in
jury to his throwing shoulder in
last week's win over Arizona that
held him out of most of the game's
second half. MRI results revealed
no structural damage, yet Lewis
practiced sparingly this week. Still,
Cardinal head coach Buddy
Teevens feels that a decrease of
practice time will not necessarily
translate to a decrease in perfor
mance for the experienced passer.
"Last week was [Lewis'] best per
formance to date, in terms of what
he needed to do," Teevens said.
" Fora guy that has been through as
much as he has, he probably does
not need as many reps."

UCLA is in a much worse posi
tion, as it lost Cory Paus with a sea
son-ending broken ankle in last
week's loss at California. In addi
tion, true freshman backup Drew
Olson is questionable with a shoul
der injury. That leaves Bruin coach
Bob Toledo with two options: red
shirt freshman John Sciarra, who
played poorly against Cal, and true
freshman Matt Moore.
One position where UCLA lias
erased its question marks is run
ning back. The Bruins started the
season with four backs vying to con
tribute, but redshirt freshman
Tyler Kbell has separated himself
from the competition and secured
his role as the Bruins' feature back.
In his last three games, the 5-foot-9
speedster has averaged over 140
yards per game.
"He runs hard and gets a lot out
of every carry," Teevens said. "He is
a concern because of his speed. We
have to tackle extremely well and be
in a position to wrap him up."
Stanford's season thus far has
been characterized by blowout
losses and errors on both sides of
the ball, but its hard-fought win
over Arizona gave the Cardinal

confidence in its ability to compete
in the Pac-10. Stanford football's
midterm grading cannot be done
on the curve, as schools like Ore
gon and Washington State set the
bar far too high for the Cardinal to
reach in a rebuilding year.
Stanford's young defense has
improved over the past six games,
yet Teevens continues to wonder
when the offense will follow suit
and play up to its potential. Here is
the Cardinal's midseason report
card. And the Stanford Daily does
not support grade inflation.
Quarterback
Stanford's passing offense is last in
the conference. Not very good, es
pecially considering the "fun and
gun" we were promised at the sea
son's outset. Much of the blame for
this lies on the shoulderpads of
Lewis. He leads the conference
with nine interceptions and is com
pleting under half of his passes,
begging the question "What if we
let Kyle Matter start the game and
brought Lewis in for relief?"

MATT SAYLES/The Stanford Daily File
Sophomore defensive end Amon Gordon and freshman linebacker Jon Alston sandwich an unfortunate Beau Carr
in Stanford's 16-6 win over Arizona last weekend. Tomorrow, the Cardinal defense will try to feast on the Bruins'
pair of untested freshman quarterbacks.
Running Backs
Surprisingly, Stanford's running
game is second in the Pac-10. After
a 98-yard outburst last Saturday,
senior Kerry Carter looks like he
might finally be over his nagging
knee injury. Senior fullback Casey
Moore dominated opposing de
fenses before his foot injury and
sophomore Kenneth Tolon has
also performed well off the bench,
providing optimism that the run
ning game will just get better.
Grade: B
Receivers
Sophomore Teyo Johnson was
plugged as one of the best receivers
in the Pac-10, but double coverage
and quarterback woes have held
him to just 54 yards per game.
Grade: C-
Offensive Line
The line has been the key to Stan
ford's rushing success, but didn't
protect Lewis and Matter with the
same reliability through the first
few games. A season-ending injury
to senior guard Paul Weinacht
does not bode well, but with junior
All-American candidate Kwame
Harris anchoring a veteran unit,
the Cardinal should be fine here.
Grade: B

Defensive Line
Injuries have kept the nose guard
position wide open, but senior
Trey Freeman and redshirt fresh
man Babatunde Oshinowo have
platooned nicely. Still, the line
hasn't gotten to the quarterback
often enough to take the heat off
the Cardinal's young defensive
backs, and has only 15 sacks.
Grade: C
Linebackers
Redshirt freshman Michael Craven
has not performed up to expecta
tions. After returning an intercep
tion fora score in the season open
er, the top recruit has been relative
ly silent, losing his starting job to
freshman Jon Alston.
Grade: C
Defensive Backs
This much-maligned group showed
flashes of brilliance in the Arizona
game. Sophomore safety Osh
iomogho Atogwe leads the team in
tackles and may be playing his way
onto the All-Conference team.
Grade: C
Special Teams
With the worst kickoff coverage
and return team this side of the
Mississippi, special teams need a
serious overhaul. On a side note,
the kicking game has improved,
but only when the snaps and holds
are good, which hasn't always true.
Grade: D
