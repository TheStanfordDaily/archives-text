# Cardinal Today
## Football primed for UCLA 
### MATT LONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Midterms are upon the Stanford
campus, which means the Cardi
nal's football season is half over.
Stanford (2-4, 1-2 Pacific-10 Con
ference) has yet another tough con
ference test this weekend, when it
travels to UCLA (4-3, 1-2). Both
teams will have to answer quarter
back questions Saturday, as injuries
plague their respective starters.
The Cardinal's signalcaller, ju
nior Chris Lewis, suffered an in
jury to his throwing shoulder in
last week's win over Arizona that
held him out of most of the game's
second half. MRI results revealed
no structural damage, yet Lewis
practiced sparingly this week. Still,
Cardinal head coach Buddy
Teevens feels that a decrease of
practice time will not necessarily
translate to a decrease in perfor
mance for the experienced passer.
"Last week was [Lewis'] best per
formance to date, in terms of what
he needed to do," Teevens said.
" Fora guy that has been through as
much as he has, he probably does
not need as many reps."

UCLA is in a much worse posi
tion, as it lost Cory Paus with a sea
son-ending broken ankle in last
week's loss at California. In addi
tion, true freshman backup Drew
Olson is questionable with a shoul
der injury. That leaves Bruin coach
Bob Toledo with two options: red
shirt freshman John Sciarra, who
played poorly against Cal, and true
freshman Matt Moore.
One position where UCLA lias
erased its question marks is run
ning back. The Bruins started the
season with four backs vying to con
tribute, but redshirt freshman
Tyler Kbell has separated himself
from the competition and secured
his role as the Bruins' feature back.
In his last three games, the 5-foot-9
speedster has averaged over 140
yards per game.
"He runs hard and gets a lot out
of every carry," Teevens said. "He is
a concern because of his speed. We
have to tackle extremely well and be
in a position to wrap him up."
Stanford's season thus far has
been characterized by blowout
losses and errors on both sides of
the ball, but its hard-fought win
over Arizona gave the Cardinal

confidence in its ability to compete
in the Pac-10. Stanford football's
midterm grading cannot be done
on the curve, as schools like Ore
gon and Washington State set the
bar far too high for the Cardinal to
reach in a rebuilding year.
Stanford's young defense has
improved over the past six games,
yet Teevens continues to wonder
when the offense will follow suit
and play up to its potential. Here is
the Cardinal's midseason report
card. And the Stanford Daily does
not support grade inflation.
Quarterback
Stanford's passing offense is last in
the conference. Not very good, es
pecially considering the "fun and
gun" we were promised at the sea
son's outset. Much of the blame for
this lies on the shoulderpads of
Lewis. He leads the conference
with nine interceptions and is com
pleting under half of his passes,
begging the question "What if we
let Kyle Matter start the game and
brought Lewis in for relief?"
Grade: D-

Sophomore defensive end Amon Gordon and freshman linebacker Jon Alston sandwich an unfortunate Beau Carr
in Stanford's 16-6 win over Arizona last weekend. Tomorrow, the Cardinal defense will try to feast on the Bruins'
pair of untested freshman quarterbacks.
