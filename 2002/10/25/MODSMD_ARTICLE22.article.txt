# Bruins have question mark at QB
## With Cory Paus out, UCLA must choose between two rookies 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN STAFF WRITER 
Going into last week's game against
California, UCLA looked like a confi
den football team.
The Bruins were 4-2, 1-1 in Pacific
-10 Conference play. They played No.
12 Oregon down to the wire, losing by a
point. Things were looking good for
head coach Bob Toledo and his team.
And then everything changed in a
heartbeat on Saturday. In the begin
ning of the third quarter, senior start
ing quarterback Cory Paus went down
with a broken right ankle. Suddenly,
the Bruins were without their leader,
and less than 24 minutes of football
later, they had a losing record in the
conference and no clear-cut quarter
back.
Paus had been the starter for the last
three years, reaching second on
UCLA's all-time passing list. Paus had
a rollercoaster season last year, both on
and off the field. However, this year he
had been leading the team with confi
dence, completing over 55 percent of
his passes.
Now, after Saturday's injury, Paus'
college career is over. Consequently, the
Bruins must begin the post-Paus era
much sooner than Toledo ever expect
ed.
When Paus came out, he was re
placed by true freshman Drew Olson.
Despite his youth, Olson looked excel
lent, going 5-for-7 for 58 yards. Howev
er, Olson also went down with an injury,
hurting his shoulder in the fourth quar
ter.
Olson was a big-time recruit last
spring and is expected to be the next big
quarterback out of UCLA. Olson came
into this season as the backup for Paus,
but with last week's spat of injuries, the
quarterback situation is even more un
clear.
"Olson has some range of motion,
but obviously he has a way to go," Tole
do said. "We are just going to play it day
by day. I felt very good about Drew
going into that game, and he looked
very good until he got hurt."

After Olson left the game, redshirt
freshman John Sciarra came in, finish
ingthegame l-for-7for 10 yards and an
interception. Originally the third-string
quarterback, Sciarra suddenly finds
himself fighting for the starting job.
"Sciarra will continue to get some

reps," Toledo said.
Freshman Matt Moore was the
fourth-string quarterback going into
the season. However, he was expecting
to redshirt and had not been traveling
