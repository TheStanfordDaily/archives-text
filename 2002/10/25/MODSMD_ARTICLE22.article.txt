# Bruins have question mark at QB
## With Cory Paus out, UCLA must choose between two rookies 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN STAFF WRITER 
Going into last week's game against
California, UCLA looked like a confi
den football team.
The Bruins were 4-2, 1-1 in Pacific
-10 Conference play. They played No.
12 Oregon down to the wire, losing by a
point. Things were looking good for
head coach Bob Toledo and his team.
And then everything changed in a
heartbeat on Saturday. In the begin
ning of the third quarter, senior start
ing quarterback Cory Paus went down
with a broken right ankle. Suddenly,
the Bruins were without their leader,
and less than 24 minutes of football
later, they had a losing record in the
conference and no clear-cut quarter
back.
Paus had been the starter for the last
three years, reaching second on
UCLA's all-time passing list. Paus had
a rollercoaster season last year, both on
and off the field. However, this year he
had been leading the team with confi
dence, completing over 55 percent of
his passes.
Now, after Saturday's injury, Paus'
college career is over. Consequently, the
Bruins must begin the post-Paus era
much sooner than Toledo ever expect
ed.
When Paus came out, he was re
placed by true freshman Drew Olson.
Despite his youth, Olson looked excel
lent, going 5-for-7 for 58 yards. Howev
er, Olson also went down with an injury,
hurting his shoulder in the fourth quar
ter.
Olson was a big-time recruit last
spring and is expected to be the next big
quarterback out of UCLA. Olson came
into this season as the backup for Paus,
but with last week's spat of injuries, the
quarterback situation is even more un
clear.
"Olson has some range of motion,
but obviously he has a way to go," Tole
do said. "We are just going to play it day
by day. I felt very good about Drew
going into that game, and he looked
very good until he got hurt."

After Olson left the game, redshirt
freshman John Sciarra came in, finish
ingthegame l-for-7for 10 yards and an
interception. Originally the third-string
quarterback, Sciarra suddenly finds
himself fighting for the starting job.
"Sciarra will continue to get some

reps," Toledo said.
Freshman Matt Moore was the
fourth-string quarterback going into
the season. However, he was expecting
to redshirt and had not been traveling

for the year due to a broken ankle, leaving Bruins head coach Bob Toledo with two fresh
men quarterbacks, who have a grand total of one collegiate game between them.
with the team in recent weeks.
Now, with Paus out and Olson
questionable, Moore must also
prepare for Saturday's matchup.
"We are going to bring in Matt
Moore, bring him off his red shirt,"
Toledo said. "He hasn't practiced
with the starters and with our of
fense. But he has done individual
drills and some group drills."
Toledo has not released his
starting quarterback and does not
plan to until game time.
"We're going to play a fresh
man quarterback," Toledo said.
"I'm just not sure who it will be
right now."
With Paus out, the Bruins be
come an incredibly young team.
The team's leading receiver, Craig
Bragg, and rusher, Tyler Ebell,
only had a season's worth of expe
rience between them coming into
the fall. In addition, whoever
starts under center on Saturday
will be starting his first college
game.
"We have a freshman center,

we will have a freshman quarter
back, a freshman fullback and a
freshman tailback," Toledo said.
"We are young, but we will find
ways to win some games down the
stretch. It's going to be a great
challenge for me and the staff, but
I believe that we can get them to
play hard and win some games
down the stretch."
In response to the new offen
sive situation, Toledo and the staff
may have to change UCLA's of
fensive game plan.
"When you don't have an expe
rienced quarterback, you narrow
things down so it's not complex
and the young quarterback can
handle it," Toledo said.
Regardless of what the Bruins
decide to do, Stanford coach
Buddy Teevens plans to prepare
for any possibility.
"We will find out as things go
on, but the expectation is that they
won't change anything," Teevens
said. "They may restrict to some
extent, but it is tough to throw
someone in the mix. They have
some quality guys that will be
ready to play, and our players are
aware of it. We have to prepare for
everything."
