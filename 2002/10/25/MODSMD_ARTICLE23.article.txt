# Band on the run
## Athletic Department censors LSJUMB's halftime show 
### 
I remember my first football game at
Stanford Stadium. Walking with my
new dormmates to the stadium, splash
ing in a few fountains along the way.
Collecting my free Stanford football t-shirt.
Watching the Cardinal trounce UCLA in an
awe-inspiring offensive display, and won
dering why the Stanford fans couldn't show

a little more energy and
support. But most of all, I
remember the Band.
Back in 1999, UCLA was
coming off a Cade Mc-
Nown-led national champi
onship run. The Bruin
faithful were hoping for an
other trip to the Rose Bowl.
But the meter maids de-

railed their season. It turns out six or so key
players were having trouble finding a place
to park, so they pulled a few strings'in the
UC system and hung handicap placards on
their rearview mirrors. T hey did start mak
ing practice on time until the mother of all
parking cops, the NCAA, gained wind of the
situation and handed out suspensions to all
the offenders.
Well, in my first trip to Stanford Stadium
1 was introduced to the Band in a perfect
formation: a handicapped symbol. This pic
ture of the LSJUMB forming a wheelchair
drew more cheers from Stanford fans than
any Troy Walters touchdown and made
highlights on Sportscenter that night.
UCLA has broken the law again, but on
a more serious note. Not on a harmless
parking scam, but rather with two drunk
driving arrests, both involving their quar
terback, Cory Paus. While the falsely dis
abled drew NCAA punishment, the NCAA
holds no jurisdiction over outside criminal
offenses of this sort. If Paus had borrowed
a booster's Lexus to do the drunk driving,
he'd probably be in big trouble, but the
consequences fora DUI alone is left to the
individual institution.
UCLA has chosen to withhold from pun
ishing Paus, effectively allowing its starter
to use a "get out of jail free" card not once
but twice.
Of course, with Stanford's trip to the Rose
Bowl this weekend, the LSJUMB planned to
capitalize on Paus' criminal record and the
UCLA Athletic Department's irresponsible
choice by planting a few barbs in their

planned pregame show, just as they did four
years ago. But the Stanford Athletic Depart
ment believes this is inappropriate and has
disallowed the pregame script and show.
The field show is entitled "Things Upon
Which Both Stanford and UCLA Can
Agree," and in a typically tongue-in-cheek
manner, the LSJUM B cites drunk driving as
a severe evil to which both schools demon
strate clear opposition.
Here is an excerpt from the passage in
question: "Both Stanford and UCLA stu
dents, faculty, and staff agree that there is
nothing more irresponsible than recklessly
endangering the lives of others. Drunk dri
ving kills hundreds of college students
every year. Swift and severe punishments
should be levied to discourage others from
making such poor choices. Because even if
it doesn't end your collegiate athletic ca
reer, drinking and driving could end
someone's life."
Some University bands show school pride
by gracefully marching, wearing lavish cos
tumes and demonstrating musical talent.
The LSJUMB has never been that kind of
band. Its only goal is to arouse a few laughs
from fans of both teams, while usually throw
ing a zinger or two at rival schools. Unfortu
nately, our band is rarely as funny as it was in
the wheelchair formation. Still, whether or
not the University, or anyone for that mat
ter, thinks the Cory Paus joke is funny, it
should not be censored.
If the band formed a bottle of Jack and
proclaimed "Cory Paus is a dirty alcoholic
who tries to run over little girls," that would
be unacceptable.
But a little irony never hurt anyone, and
outlawing the pre-game show on behalf of
such an inoffensive remark that might upset
a few (like Paus' grandparents) is cowardly
and heavy-handed. It is this same spirit that
has taken much of the fun out of Big Game
(for both Stanford and Cal) by disallowing
the Band's mention of the word "Cal" in its
Big Game shows.
The Band should be allowed to do what
it does best: poke fun at the students and
athletes of other schools in the name of in
stigating some healthy rivalry. And if the
Bruins want to ridicule Chris Lewis' NCAA
transgressions by playing "I Just Called to
Say I Love You," we'll laugh right along
with them.

I remember my first football game at
Stanford Stadium. Walking with my
new dormmates to the stadium, splash
ing in a few fountains along the way.
Collecting my free Stanford football t-shirt.
Watching the Cardinal trounce UCLA in an
awe-inspiring offensive display, and won
dering why the Stanford fans couldn't show

a little more energy and
support. But most of all, I
remember the Band.
Back in 1999, UCLA was
coming off a Cade Mc-
Nown-led national champi
onship run. The Bruin
faithful were hoping for an
other trip to the Rose Bowl.
But the meter maids de-

railed their season. It turns out six or so key
players were having trouble finding a place
to park, so they pulled a few strings'in the
UC system and hung handicap placards on
their rearview mirrors. T hey did start mak
ing practice on time until the mother of all
parking cops, the NCAA, gained wind of the
situation and handed out suspensions to all
the offenders.
Well, in my first trip to Stanford Stadium
1 was introduced to the Band in a perfect
formation: a handicapped symbol. This pic
ture of the LSJUMB forming a wheelchair
drew more cheers from Stanford fans than
any Troy Walters touchdown and made
highlights on Sportscenter that night.
UCLA has broken the law again, but on
a more serious note. Not on a harmless
parking scam, but rather with two drunk
driving arrests, both involving their quar
terback, Cory Paus. While the falsely dis
abled drew NCAA punishment, the NCAA
holds no jurisdiction over outside criminal
offenses of this sort. If Paus had borrowed
a booster's Lexus to do the drunk driving,
he'd probably be in big trouble, but the
consequences fora DUI alone is left to the
individual institution.
UCLA has chosen to withhold from pun
ishing Paus, effectively allowing its starter
to use a "get out of jail free" card not once
but twice.
Of course, with Stanford's trip to the Rose
Bowl this weekend, the LSJUMB planned to
capitalize on Paus' criminal record and the
UCLA Athletic Department's irresponsible
choice by planting a few barbs in their

planned pregame show, just as they did four
years ago. But the Stanford Athletic Depart
ment believes this is inappropriate and has
disallowed the pregame script and show.
The field show is entitled "Things Upon
Which Both Stanford and UCLA Can
Agree," and in a typically tongue-in-cheek
manner, the LSJUM B cites drunk driving as
a severe evil to which both schools demon
strate clear opposition.
Here is an excerpt from the passage in
question: "Both Stanford and UCLA stu
dents, faculty, and staff agree that there is
nothing more irresponsible than recklessly
endangering the lives of others. Drunk dri
ving kills hundreds of college students
every year. Swift and severe punishments
should be levied to discourage others from
making such poor choices. Because even if
it doesn't end your collegiate athletic ca
reer, drinking and driving could end
someone's life."
Some University bands show school pride
by gracefully marching, wearing lavish cos
tumes and demonstrating musical talent.
The LSJUMB has never been that kind of
band. Its only goal is to arouse a few laughs
from fans of both teams, while usually throw
ing a zinger or two at rival schools. Unfortu
nately, our band is rarely as funny as it was in
the wheelchair formation. Still, whether or
not the University, or anyone for that mat
ter, thinks the Cory Paus joke is funny, it
should not be censored.
If the band formed a bottle of Jack and
proclaimed "Cory Paus is a dirty alcoholic
who tries to run over little girls," that would
be unacceptable.
But a little irony never hurt anyone, and
outlawing the pre-game show on behalf of
such an inoffensive remark that might upset
a few (like Paus' grandparents) is cowardly
and heavy-handed. It is this same spirit that
has taken much of the fun out of Big Game
(for both Stanford and Cal) by disallowing
the Band's mention of the word "Cal" in its
Big Game shows.
The Band should be allowed to do what
it does best: poke fun at the students and
athletes of other schools in the name of in
stigating some healthy rivalry. And if the
Bruins want to ridicule Chris Lewis' NCAA
transgressions by playing "I Just Called to
Say I Love You," we'll laugh right along
with them.
