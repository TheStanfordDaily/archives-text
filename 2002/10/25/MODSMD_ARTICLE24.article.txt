# Catching on: Smith making the most of unexpected chances

### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Prior the season, Alex Smith was expect
ed to back up All-Pacific-10 Conference
tight end Brett Pierce and perhaps make a
few catches out of two-tight-encl sets.
Today, the sophomore finds himself the
second-leading receiver and only unin
jured tight end on the Stanford football
team (2-4, 1-2 Pac-10).
"It came as quite a shock," Smith said.
"You never know when it could be your
turn to go."
Smith was ready. He's racked up 20 re
ceptions for 279 yards and two touchdowns

in addition to the traditional tight end du
ties of pass- and run-blocking.
"I knew I'd get my opportunities to
make some plays, and fortunately for me
.they've been coming through," Smith said.
Head coach Buddy Teevens hasn't hesi
tated to put Smith in position to make the
big plays. Smith caught eight balls for 120
yards and a score in last week's win.
"Alex is doing a nice job executing his
routes and catching passes," Teevens said.
"I thought we did a nice job identifying
him last week."
Despite his breakthrough showing
against the Wildcats, Smith isn't worried
about UCLA's defense keying on him to

morrow in Los Angeles.
" They might be focusing on me right
now after last week's game, but if that's the
case, Luke and Teyo and those guys will be
wide open," Smith said. "But if they call
my number, I just want to go out there
and make some plays."
Smith's uncertainty week to week on
what the size of his role will be shows his
patience and focus.
"At times, it gets frustrating when you
feel you're open and the quarterback is not
exactly looking in your direction," Smith
said. "But you know you just have to keep
your head in it because you just never know
when he will throw it to you."

However, Stanford's quarterbacks
have learned that throwing to Smith can
pay big dividends.
"We focus a lot of our throwing on our
outside receivers, so when we're looking in
side, Alex is a big part of that," redshirt
freshman quarterback Kyle Matter said.
His ability to get open certainly hasn't
hurt Smith's cause. He has surprised de
fenders with his propensity for getting
open down field — a rarity fora tight end.
"Coach Teevens just likes to throw the
ball downfield, so when he calls it I just
have to go down there, outrun the line
backers, everybody else and catch the ball,"
Smith said.

Smith's size — 6-foot-5, 245 pounds —
and speed make him a tough man to stop
both before and after the catch. His favorite
coverage to face is man-to-man.
"You're usually too fast for the line
backers and too big for the safeties,"
Smith explained.
Deception and surprise also figure into
the picture.
"We have option routes, which are pret
ty helpful," Smith said. "You have the
choice which direction you want to run de
pending on how the defender is playing
you, so it gives you a lot of freedom to get
yourself open."
Pleased with his progress as a
receiver, Smith is also feeling more
comfortable as a blocker.
"I feel I've made pretty good
strides on that," Smith said. "I'm
not quite where I need to be, but I
think there's been a vast difference
from last year to this year."
Smith's practice schedule is a bit
unusual in that he works both as a
lineman and as a receiver.
"The first couple sessions of
practice, we'll be with the linemen,
getting our run blocking and our
pass blocking down," Smith said.
"Then we go work with the re
ceivers and work on our routes. I
have to do both just as much."
But, as the last man standing
from the tight end corps, is Smith
being more cautious?
"There's really nothing I can
do," Smith said. "I still have to go
hard in practice so I can stay strong
for the games."

Sophomore Alex Smith finds himself with plenty of room to run against Washington State. The tight end caught eight
balls last week against Arizona and ranks second on the team in both receptions and touchdown catches.
