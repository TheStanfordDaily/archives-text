# Undefeated Irish are still underdogs

SOUTH BEN 1), Ind. (AP) — In 1993,
Notre Dame won its showdown with Florida
State, breathed a sigh of relief, then went out
and lost to Boston College — blowing a shot at
the national title.
The Seminoles won the championship that
year, which irks the Irish to this day. That dis
appointment turned out to be the beginning of
a steady slide for Notre Dame.
The Irish have turned things around under
first-year coach Tyrone Willingham, though,
and they take a No. 6 ranking and 7-0 record
into Saturday's game at Florida State.
Even though Florida State is 5-2 and ranked
1 1 th, it's a 10-point favorite for the game in Tal
lahassee, Fla.
"We're undefeated, we're the higher ranked
team and we're underdogs once again," Irish
linebacker Courtney Watson said. "You take it
as a bit of disrespect."
Since 1993, the Seminoles won another na

tional championship and put together a string
of top-five finishes.
The Irish, meanwhile, have not finished
in the top 10 during that span —an eight
year drought that is the longest in the
school's history.
It's never easy to beat the Seminoles at their
Doak Campbell Stadium. Florida State is 84-4-
1 there since 1989.
Two of the losses came last season, which
gives hope to Irish center Jeff Faine.
"In recent years it's been kind of proven that
you can go there and win," Faine said.
Notre Dame hasn't exactly been a dominant
road team in recent years. It went 1-4 on the
road last season, and last week's 21-14 win over
Air Force was Notre Dame's first at a ranked op
ponent since a 24-6 win over No. 11 LSU on
Nov. 15, 1997.
But Notre Dame's confidence keeps grow
ing under Willingham. A significant statistic:

The Irish are 5-0 in games decided by eight
points or fewer.
Florida State coach Bobby Bowden said he
knows the Irish are for real.
"They're good enough to beat us and we're
good enough to beat them," he said.
Willingham marvels at Bowden's ability to
keep the Seminoles among the nation's elite for
so long.
"It has to be a testament to one's confi
dence in his system. Because it's very easy
when you have those down moments to doubt
yourself and doubt the things that are a part
of your system and begin to change," Willing
ham said. "It's amazing how destructive that
can be."
It's been some time since Notre Dame has
had to worry about that.
But if they beat Florida State on Saturday,
the Irish will be 8-0 going into a game against
— guess who? — Boston College.
