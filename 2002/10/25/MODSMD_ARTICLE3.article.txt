# University to freeze hiring, may cut budget 8 percent
## Facilities to close down over winter break, layoffs a possibility 
### CARLY GEEHR 
University Provost John
Etchemendy informed the Facul
ty Senate yesterday afternoon of
steep upcoming budget cuts for
the 2004 fiscal year and their con
sequences on the University as a
whole. Addressing a sea of wor
ried faces, Etchemendy outlined
three issues of major concern:
Stanford's grim financial out
look, a hiring freeze and the ef
fects of the reduced budget on
staff, including possible layoffs.
Budget cuts for 2004 are cur
rently estimated at 8 percent, a
figure Etchemendy called "a
large amount of money." The
outlook is in the process of being
finalized, as the budget commit
tee spends each academic year
developing the next year's fig
ures. The committee uses a long
range forecast to arrive at its "best
guess" of the amount of money
that can be spent in a given year.
For next year, that amount is
dwindling.
To deal with the impending
reductions in spending, the com
mittee will come up with plans for
three scenarios: a 5 percent cut, a
7.5 percent cut and a 10 percent
cut. According to Etchemendy,
these plans will ensure that the
University is best prepared to
deal with an unfavorable finan
cial situation.
"These are fairly significant
cuts and could involve layoffs,"
Etchemendy warned. He added
that while layoffs are not immi
nent, they are entirely possible
and will ultimately be left to the
discretion of the relevant deans
and vice presidents.
"Stanford is known for its sta
bility of employment,"
Etchemendy said. "That's going

to continue."
He later assured the senate
that it is possible there will be no
significant layoffs at all.
Major consequences of staff
cuts, as indicated by senate mem
bers, could include morale prob
lems among remaining Universi
ty employees and difficulties re
hiring staff after the financial
problems subside.
The threat of layoffs in the
near future poses the new and
difficult question of how many
staff to hire under such consider
able financial restraints. In re
sponse to this problem, Universi
ty President John Hennessy and
Etchemendy have proposed a
precautionary hiring freeze effec
tive immediately.
Etchemendy called this con
clusion "not a pleasing decision
to make."
This hiring freeze stipulates
that before filling any new open
ings, excepting faculty and cer
tain student positions, each
prospective employee will have to
be reviewed by a senior officer of
the University. While new em
ployees will continue to be hired,
it will significantly limit the num
ber of new employees in the
proximal future.
Coming on the heels of a mas
sive increase in staff, Etchemendy
argued that slowing down the
hiring rate could be a good idea
for the long-term benefit of the
institution. Last year, there was a

(j percent increase in (lie number
of staff; the year before, 7 per
cent. In light of these figures,
Etchemendy recommended that
the University "put the brakes on
that [increase]."
Senate member Robert Si
moni expressed concern about
the past staff increases, specifical
ly "not knowing where it's oc
curred and for what reason."
Other faculty members voiced
similar misgivings, whereupon
Etchemendy told the senate that
the past increases were spread
out relatively evenly throughout
the University.
In addition to possible layoffs
and the hiring freeze,
Etchemendy also encouraged fa
cilities to cease operations, when
ever possible, over the winter
break. This will "save substantial
amounts of money," reducing the
cost of utilities and employees'
pay during that period.
Senate member Jeffrey Koseff
vouched for the cost-effectiveness
of closing down during the win
ter break, as the Terman Engi
neering Center has done for al
most a decade. But Koseff
warned that it can be "a real hard
ship" for some employees, partic
ularly those who have been on
staff for less than a year.
Etchemendy recommended
that all staff use remaining paid
time off (PTO) over winter break
to compensate for the time off
from work. However, new em
ployees who have not yet had
time to accumulate adequate
I r rO will be hit hard by the break.
Considering that 6 percent of
the staff is in its first year at Stan
ford, if enforced, this forced time
off would severely impact a large
number of Stanford's employees.
Senate member Joanne Martin
noted that this would be "putting
the burden of the cut on the peo
ple who can afford it least." Staff
not on salary and without accrued

l r rO may have no alternative
source of income for as long as two
weeks over vacation. Etchemendy
assured the senate that he would
look into the matter.
Other concerns from the fac
ulty included the financial ef
fects of the budget cuts on new
departments, such as the new

Clark Center for Biomedical En
gineering & Sciences, and possi
ble reductions in the search for
faculty members.
The hiring freeze and reduc
tion in spending over the winter
break are short-term solutions to
what could potentially become a
long-term problem. Etchemendy
said the University may eventual
ly need to find ways to reorganize
its infrastructure and increase ef
ficiency to reduce spending in
the future.

the burden of the cut on the peo
ple who can afford it least." Staff
not on salary and without accrued

l r rO may have no alternative
source of income for as long as two
weeks over vacation. Etchemendy
assured the senate that he would
look into the matter.
Other concerns from the fac
ulty included the financial ef
fects of the budget cuts on new
departments, such as the new

Clark Center for Biomedical En
gineering & Sciences, and possi
ble reductions in the search for
faculty members.
The hiring freeze and reduc
tion in spending over the winter
break are short-term solutions to
what could potentially become a
long-term problem. Etchemendy
said the University may eventual
ly need to find ways to reorganize
its infrastructure and increase ef
ficiency to reduce spending in
the future.
University Provost John
Etchemendy informed the Facul
ty Senate yesterday afternoon of
steep upcoming budget cuts for
the 2004 fiscal year and their con
sequences on the University as a
whole. Addressing a sea of wor
ried faces, Etchemendy outlined
three issues of major concern:
Stanford's grim financial out
look, a hiring freeze and the ef
fects of the reduced budget on
staff, including possible layoffs.
Budget cuts for 2004 are cur
rently estimated at 8 percent, a
figure Etchemendy called "a
large amount of money." The
outlook is in the process of being
finalized, as the budget commit
tee spends each academic year
developing the next year's fig
ures. The committee uses a long
range forecast to arrive at its "best
guess" of the amount of money
that can be spent in a given year.
For next year, that amount is
dwindling.
To deal with the impending
reductions in spending, the com
mittee will come up with plans for
three scenarios: a 5 percent cut, a
7.5 percent cut and a 10 percent
cut. According to Etchemendy,
these plans will ensure that the
University is best prepared to
deal with an unfavorable finan
cial situation.
"These are fairly significant
cuts and could involve layoffs,"
Etchemendy warned. He added
that while layoffs are not immi
nent, they are entirely possible
and will ultimately be left to the
discretion of the relevant deans
and vice presidents.
"Stanford is known for its sta
bility of employment,"
Etchemendy said. "That's going

to continue."
He later assured the senate
that it is possible there will be no
significant layoffs at all.
Major consequences of staff
cuts, as indicated by senate mem
bers, could include morale prob
lems among remaining Universi
ty employees and difficulties re
hiring staff after the financial
problems subside.
The threat of layoffs in the
near future poses the new and
difficult question of how many
staff to hire under such consider
able financial restraints. In re
sponse to this problem, Universi
ty President John Hennessy and
Etchemendy have proposed a
precautionary hiring freeze effec
tive immediately.
Etchemendy called this con
clusion "not a pleasing decision
to make."
This hiring freeze stipulates
that before filling any new open
ings, excepting faculty and cer
tain student positions, each
prospective employee will have to
be reviewed by a senior officer of
the University. While new em
ployees will continue to be hired,
it will significantly limit the num
ber of new employees in the
proximal future.
Coming on the heels of a mas
sive increase in staff, Etchemendy
argued that slowing down the
hiring rate could be a good idea
for the long-term benefit of the
institution. Last year, there was a

(j percent increase in (lie number
of staff; the year before, 7 per
cent. In light of these figures,
Etchemendy recommended that
the University "put the brakes on
that [increase]."
Senate member Robert Si
moni expressed concern about
the past staff increases, specifical
ly "not knowing where it's oc
curred and for what reason."
Other faculty members voiced
similar misgivings, whereupon
Etchemendy told the senate that
the past increases were spread
out relatively evenly throughout
the University.
In addition to possible layoffs
and the hiring freeze,
Etchemendy also encouraged fa
cilities to cease operations, when
ever possible, over the winter
break. This will "save substantial
amounts of money," reducing the
cost of utilities and employees'
pay during that period.
Senate member Jeffrey Koseff
vouched for the cost-effectiveness
of closing down during the win
ter break, as the Terman Engi
neering Center has done for al
most a decade. But Koseff
warned that it can be "a real hard
ship" for some employees, partic
ularly those who have been on
staff for less than a year.
Etchemendy recommended
that all staff use remaining paid
time off (PTO) over winter break
to compensate for the time off
from work. However, new em
ployees who have not yet had
time to accumulate adequate
I r rO will be hit hard by the break.
Considering that 6 percent of
the staff is in its first year at Stan
ford, if enforced, this forced time
off would severely impact a large
number of Stanford's employees.
Senate member Joanne Martin
noted that this would be "putting
the burden of the cut on the peo
ple who can afford it least." Staff
not on salary and without accrued

l r rO may have no alternative
