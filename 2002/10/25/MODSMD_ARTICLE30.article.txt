## Seki puts in extra time to help golf get ahead 
### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On the practice green on Tues
day, Jim Seki is completely focused
on the task at hand. He concen
trates on each putting stroke anew,
as if he hasn't made the same mo
tion countless times before.
Seki and his teammates on the

Stanford men's golf team had got
ten up at the crack of dawn to play
a practice round, but Seki was back
at work in the afternoon even
though the team didn't have a
scheduled practice. That didn't
matter to the four-year varsity
player. The Cardinal has been
struggling during the last two
weeks — lie is responding by in
creasing his own efforts.
It would be easy for Seki to be
complacent at this point. In the
team's first three tournaments, he
notched a pair of top-five finishes.
Me leads the Cardinal in scoring

average and is currently the No. 7
player in the nation, according to
Golfweek. Nonetheless, he sees
room for improvement.
"[Putting] is what has cost me,"
Seki said. "During the last three
tournaments, I've been hitting the
ball great, but I just couldn't chip
or putt. That's what killed me."
This reaction is typical of Seki, a
soft-spoken senior who motivates
his teammates with actions, rather
than words.
"Jim leads by example. He
works really hard at [his game],"
says junior Blake Mastalir. "When
you see that someone else is work
ing hard, it's a lot easier to work
hard yourself."
Coach Jeff Mitchell echoes
those sentiments as well: "[Jim]
goes out and plays well on an
everyday basis. He gives it 100
percent. He leads by his actions,
not by what he says, and 1 think
that's one of the leadership quali
ties you really look for as a coach."
Seki hopes that all the hard
work will pay off when the post

season rolls around in the spring.
"I want to win a [Pacific-10 Con
ference] team championship be
fore I leave here," he says."I want
to see the team do well and make it
to nationals."
He will also try to defend his
l'ac-10 individual title this April
when the conference champi
onships will be held in Los Angeles.
This weekend, Seki and the rest
of the Stanford men's golf team
will host the Nelson Invitational at
the Stanford Golf Course. It will be
the team's only regular season
event that takes place at the Farm
this year.
Coming off disappointing per

formances at both the (Hub (Hove
Intercollegiate and the Alister
Mackenzie Invitational earlier
this month, the Cardinal lias had
a week off to prepare for the Nel
son. Although it's still relatively
early in the year, Seki believes
this is a very important event for
the team.
"I think this is a must-win tour
nament," Seki said. "We have to go
out and play well, or else we're
going to fall way behind. We'll be
0-3 against a lot of these teams in
our region."
In order to succeed this week,
Stanford will have to compete with
some of the best players and teams
in the nation.
The prestigious 18-team event
consistently attracts a top-notch
field, and this year looks to be no
different. Four teams (Georgia

lech, North Carolina State, Tole
do and Washington) are ranked in
the top 25 nationally in (iolll)i
-gest's coaches' poll. In addition,
Northwestern checks in at No. T> in
Colfweek's rankings.
Individually, Northweslern's
junior loin |ohnson is the No. 2
player in the nation and will look to
continue his brilliant season this
weekend. Also competing lor top
honors will be (Georgia Tech junior
Troy Matteson, the sixth-ranked
player in the country.
Look for Washington to be
excited about defending its title
this weekend. Last year, the
Huskies shot a 1 3-under-par 839
over the three days to edge the
second-place Cardinal by four
strokes.
Despite facing a tough field,
Stanford has an excellent chance

to get back on track this weekend.
"It's always good to go home,"
Mitchell said. "We've played this
golf course well this year. We've
played a lot of qualifying rounds,
and the stroke averages have been
a lot lower than they've been the
last two years. I think we have an
opportunity to have a really good
event."
In the past, the Cardinal has
looked very comfortable on its
home course. Last year's Nelson
saw strong performances from
both Seki and current sophomore
Kevin Blue. Seki tired a three
round 209 to tie for fourth place,
while Blue's 211 earned him a
12th-place finish.
Today and Saturday, tee times
will begin at 8:00 a.m. from split
tees. On Sunday, the teams will
play from a shotgun start.

Stanford has an excellent chance

to get back on track this weekend.
"It's always good to go home,"
Mitchell said. "We've played this
golf course well this year. We've
played a lot of qualifying rounds,
and the stroke averages have been
a lot lower than they've been the
last two years. I think we have an
opportunity to have a really good
event."
In the past, the Cardinal has
looked very comfortable on its
home course. Last year's Nelson
saw strong performances from
both Seki and current sophomore
Kevin Blue. Seki tired a three
round 209 to tie for fourth place,
while Blue's 211 earned him a
12th-place finish.
Today and Saturday, tee times
will begin at 8:00 a.m. from split
tees. On Sunday, the teams will
play from a shotgun start.
On the practice green on Tues
day, Jim Seki is completely focused
on the task at hand. He concen
trates on each putting stroke anew,
as if he hasn't made the same mo
tion countless times before.

Stanford men's golf team had got
ten up at the crack of dawn to play
a practice round, but Seki was back
at work in the afternoon even
though the team didn't have a
scheduled practice. That didn't
matter to the four-year varsity
player. The Cardinal has been
struggling during the last two
weeks — lie is responding by in
creasing his own efforts.
It would be easy for Seki to be
complacent at this point. In the
team's first three tournaments, he
notched a pair of top-five finishes.
Me leads the Cardinal in scoring

average and is currently the No. 7
player in the nation, according to
Golfweek. Nonetheless, he sees
room for improvement.
"[Putting] is what has cost me,"
Seki said. "During the last three
tournaments, I've been hitting the
ball great, but I just couldn't chip
or putt. That's what killed me."
This reaction is typical of Seki, a
soft-spoken senior who motivates
his teammates with actions, rather
than words.
"Jim leads by example. He
works really hard at [his game],"
says junior Blake Mastalir. "When
you see that someone else is work
ing hard, it's a lot easier to work
hard yourself."
Coach Jeff Mitchell echoes
those sentiments as well: "[Jim]
goes out and plays well on an
everyday basis. He gives it 100
percent. He leads by his actions,
not by what he says, and 1 think
that's one of the leadership quali
ties you really look for as a coach."
Seki hopes that all the hard
work will pay off when the post

"I want to win a [Pacific-10 Con
ference] team championship be
fore I leave here," he says."I want
to see the team do well and make it
to nationals."
He will also try to defend his
l'ac-10 individual title this April
when the conference champi
onships will be held in Los Angeles.
This weekend, Seki and the rest
of the Stanford men's golf team
will host the Nelson Invitational at
the Stanford Golf Course. It will be
the team's only regular season
event that takes place at the Farm
this year.
Coming off disappointing per

formances at both the (Hub (Hove
Intercollegiate and the Alister
Mackenzie Invitational earlier
this month, the Cardinal lias had
a week off to prepare for the Nel
son. Although it's still relatively
early in the year, Seki believes
this is a very important event for
the team.
"I think this is a must-win tour
nament," Seki said. "We have to go
out and play well, or else we're
going to fall way behind. We'll be
0-3 against a lot of these teams in
our region."
In order to succeed this week,
Stanford will have to compete with
some of the best players and teams
in the nation.
The prestigious 18-team event
consistently attracts a top-notch
field, and this year looks to be no
different. Four teams (Georgia

lech, North Carolina State, Tole
do and Washington) are ranked in
the top 25 nationally in (iolll)i
-gest's coaches' poll. In addition,
Northwestern checks in at No. T> in
Colfweek's rankings.
Individually, Northweslern's
junior loin |ohnson is the No. 2
player in the nation and will look to
continue his brilliant season this
weekend. Also competing lor top
honors will be (Georgia Tech junior
Troy Matteson, the sixth-ranked
player in the country.
Look for Washington to be
excited about defending its title
this weekend. Last year, the
Huskies shot a 1 3-under-par 839
over the three days to edge the
second-place Cardinal by four
strokes.
Despite facing a tough field,
Stanford has an excellent chance
