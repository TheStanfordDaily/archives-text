## Seki puts in extra time to help golf get ahead 
### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On the practice green on Tues
day, Jim Seki is completely focused
on the task at hand. He concen
trates on each putting stroke anew,
as if he hasn't made the same mo
tion countless times before.

Sunday

Stanford men's golf team had got
ten up at the crack of dawn to play
a practice round, but Seki was back
at work in the afternoon even
though the team didn't have a
scheduled practice. That didn't
matter to the four-year varsity
player. The Cardinal has been
struggling during the last two
weeks â€” lie is responding by in
creasing his own efforts.
It would be easy for Seki to be
complacent at this point. In the
team's first three tournaments, he
notched a pair of top-five finishes.
Me leads the Cardinal in scoring

average and is currently the No. 7
player in the nation, according to
Golfweek. Nonetheless, he sees
room for improvement.
"[Putting] is what has cost me,"
Seki said. "During the last three
tournaments, I've been hitting the
ball great, but I just couldn't chip
or putt. That's what killed me."
This reaction is typical of Seki, a
soft-spoken senior who motivates
his teammates with actions, rather
than words.
"Jim leads by example. He
works really hard at [his game],"
says junior Blake Mastalir. "When
you see that someone else is work
ing hard, it's a lot easier to work
hard yourself."
Coach Jeff Mitchell echoes
those sentiments as well: "[Jim]
goes out and plays well on an
everyday basis. He gives it 100
percent. He leads by his actions,
not by what he says, and 1 think
that's one of the leadership quali
ties you really look for as a coach."
Seki hopes that all the hard
work will pay off when the post
