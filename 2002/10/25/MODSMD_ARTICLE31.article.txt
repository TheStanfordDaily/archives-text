# Volleyball trails USC at halfway mark
## 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Halfway through the Pacific-10 Conference
volleyball schedule, the standings only bear
some resemblance to the way most expected
them to look at this point of the season. But how
the Pac-10 season got to where it is now — and
how different outcomes on just a few rallies
during the season could've jumbled things up
even more — few could've predicted.
Only last-place Oregon is in the spot pre
dicted by the Pac-10 coaches in their preseason
poll. With 13 five-game matches having gone
down already in Pac-10 play — and with seven
of the top eight teams in the standings having
already played in at least two — the confer
ence's frontrunners have had little chance to
feel secure so far. Here's a team-by-team look at
the Pac-10 at the midway point:
No. 1 USC (9-0 Pac-10)
The Trojans closed out a perfect first half to
the season by crushing crosstown rival UCLA
last weekend. Hut USC, has been taken to five
games twice, in both of its matches in the Bay
area three weeks ago. The Trojans survived
seven match points in the fifth game against
Stanford and only narrowly won the final game
against the California, meaning that the USC
women are not untouchable.
At 16-0, the Trojans are one of only three re
maining undefeated teams in Division I, most
ly thanks to their overpowering attack, which
leads the conference with 17.75 kills per game
and is second with a .292 hitting percentage. All
six of USC's hitters in its 6-2 offensive setup are
averaging over two kills per game.
No. 6 Stanford (7-2)
Stanford is hitting a conference-high .319 and
averaging almost a block more per game than
any other team in the conference. But a pair of
gut-wrenching five-game losses to the Trojans
and Arizona have made the Cardinal's Pac-10
title defense a much more formidable task.
Stanford's offense is doing fine, as senior
Logan Tom and sophomore Ogonna N namani
continue to look like the best combination of
outside hitters in the country, combining for
8.53 kills per game.
But the Cardinal's defense has been suspect
at times, although it is steadily improving as
freshman libero Courtney Schultz and senior
defensive specialist Lindsay Yamasaki settle in
to their defensive roles. That process has been
helped by Stanford's dominating block, which

Notes: Stanford (17-3, 7-2 Pac-10) swept both Oregon
and Oregon St. on the road last month. The Cardinal
has picked up 19 service aces in its last two matches.
Stanford is the only team in the Pac-10 hitting over
.300 and averaging more than three blocks per game
Oregon (10-13, 0-9) is last in the conference in kills
and hitting percentage. Outside hitter Lindsay Closs
leads the Ducks with 3.81 kills per game. Oregon took
on No. 18 Arizona State last weekend.
Oregon St. (6-12, 1 -8) has lost 11 of its last 12. The
Beavers lead the Pac-10 in digs but rank last in blocks
and opponent hitting percentage. Megan McMillan
leads the team with 3.38 kills and 3.09 digs per game.
Stanford has never lost to Oregon State, going 35-0 in
the series.

leads the Pac-10 for the third straight year with
3.72 blocks per game.
No. 18 Arizona State (6-3)
The Sun Devils have been the biggest sur
prise of the year, slowly rising in the Pac-10 and
the national rankings with wins over UCLAand
Arizona.
Sophomore outside hitter Juliana Escobar
has established her presence in the conference

as both as offensive and defensive threat, rank
ing fourth in the Pac-10 in kills and digs and
second in aces.
But Arizona State has to make tough road
trips to the Bay Area and to the Los Angeles
schools on top of having to face in-state rival
Arizona in Tucson during the second halfof the
season.
No. 13 UCLA (5-4)
With the Bruins graduating all-time Pac-10
kill leader Kristee Porter along with solid out
side hitter Ashley Bowles and setter Erika Sel
sor last year, not a whole lot was expected out of
Westwood this season, and that's about all that's
happened.
Granted UCLA had the toughest first-half
schedule, having to face USC, the NorCal
schools and the Arizona schools on the road,
but the Bruins only went 1-4 in those match
es, basically ending UCLA's chances in the
Pac-10 race.
Senior outside hitter Lauren Fendrick has
clone an admirable job of trying to lill her pre
decessors' shoes, but UCLA's offense has been
flat overall, ranking ninth in the conference
with a .210 hitting percentage.

Senior Lindsey Yamasaki, a defensive specialist, has played well this year in her return to the volleyball
team. Despite some bumps in the road so far, Yamasaki and the Cardinal find themselves second in the
Pac-10 standings and sixth in the national rankings.
