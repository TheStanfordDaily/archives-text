# Field hockey gets a breather vs. USCB

### SPENCER PORTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With losses in three of its last four games
and a big showdown with California that will
decide the Northern Pacific Athletic Confer
ence title looming a week down the road, the
Stanford field hockey team wouldn't mind a
little extra practice time.
Fortunately for the Cardinal (8-9,4-1 Nor-
Pac), a pair of exhibition games at home this
weekend will give it exactly that. Stanford will
take on a team of Cardinal field hockey alum
nae on Saturday, then will face off with UC-
Santa Barbara's club team on Sunday. Both
games start at 1:00 p.m. on the Artificial Turf
Field.

some of its recent problems before the crucial
regular season finale against the Golden
Bears, which will be followed by the NorPac
tournament. All of Stanford's remaining
games will be at home, a huge advantage for
the team.
"The home field advantage is nice mainly
because there are no distractions â€” no planes,
no missed classes, no adjusted sleep sched
ules," said senior Ann it Chima, Stanford's co
points leader. "We'll get some days off. It will
allow us to get some good practices in. It's also
good for the seniors. Being able to play Cal at
home on Senior Day will be a nice touch, but

being at home will be the big difference."
The other points leader, senior forward
Amanda Billmyer, was named the NorPac Of
fensive Player of the Week for the first time in
her career. Billmyer earned the biweekly
award for her hat trick against Saint Louis on
Oct. 7 and a goal against Yale last weekend.
Billmyer leads the team in goals with eight,
and her 17 points on the year is only one shy of
her single-season record of 18 as a sophomore.
She is also the Cardinal's active career points
leader with 48 in her four years on the Farm.
The Cardinal, with its away loss to Califor
nia two weeks ago, dropped but of first place in
the NorPac two weeks ago and remains in sec
ond place, a half-game back of the 4-0 Bears.
