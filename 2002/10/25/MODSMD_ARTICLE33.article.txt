### JIMMY WU STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's soccer
team's first loss of the season on
Sept. 27 stunned and haunted the
Stanford defensive quartet of se
niors Taylor Graham and Todd
Dunivant, sophomore Aaron
Maines and freshman Chad Mar
shall.

Men's Soccer
at California, Saturday, 2:00 p.m.

In its poorest performance of
the year, the Stanford backline
had just been schooled by a fast but
not-as-talented Tulsa squad, 3-1.
The No. 7 Cardinal men's soc
cer team (11-2-1, Pacific-10 Con
ference 2-1-1) took (he blame as a
defensive whole, but when it came
down if, the four guys positioned
by the goal didn't do their jobs.

"Against Tulsa, we weren't
playing as a unit," Dunivant said.
"Some guys were stepping while
some guys weren't, so we weren't
on the same page. This caused us
to be strung out and [the Tulsa
players] got behind us. We learned
that lesson pretty early on. It was a
pretty big slap in the face and was
proof that we have to play as a unit
or we'll get punished for it."
The lesson really seems to have
taken hold.

have been the primary reason for
why Stanford has only allowed two
goals in its last six games.
The foursome hopes to contin

weekend when they travel with the
Cardinal to Berkeley fora
matchup against perennial rival
No. 15 (California (10-3-1,3-1 -0) on
Saturday afternoon at 2:00 p.m.
According to Graham, the back

four's improvement stems from a
long learning process dating back
to the beginning of the year.
"We gave up a lot of goals early
in the season, so I think we've real
ly improved throughout the sea
son in terms of what we expect
from each other and what our
roles are on defense," Graham
said. "We've now know each
other's strengths and weaknesses,
and we've figured out a system
that we understand and have
bought into."
Compounding the inevitable
rough spots at the beginning of the
year is that the defense had to cope
with the loss of solid defenders Lee
Morrison and Aaron Biddle to
graduation.

has been superb, as Stanford has yielded only two goals in six games.
