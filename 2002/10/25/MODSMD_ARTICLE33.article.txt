## Defense takes charge 
### JIMMY WU STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's soccer
team's first loss of the season on
Sept. 27 stunned and haunted the
Stanford defensive quartet of se
niors Taylor Graham and Todd
Dunivant, sophomore Aaron
Maines and freshman Chad Mar
shall.

Men's Soccer
at California, Saturday, 2:00 p.m.

In its poorest performance of
the year, the Stanford backline
had just been schooled by a fast but
not-as-talented Tulsa squad, 3-1.
The No. 7 Cardinal men's soc
cer team (11-2-1, Pacific-10 Con
ference 2-1-1) took (he blame as a
defensive whole, but when it came
down if, the four guys positioned
by the goal didn't do their jobs.

"Against Tulsa, we weren't
playing as a unit," Dunivant said.
"Some guys were stepping while
some guys weren't, so we weren't
on the same page. This caused us
to be strung out and [the Tulsa
players] got behind us. We learned
that lesson pretty early on. It was a
pretty big slap in the face and was
proof that we have to play as a unit
or we'll get punished for it."
The lesson really seems to have
taken hold.
Ever since that low point, they
have been the primary reason for
why Stanford has only allowed two
goals in its last six games.
The foursome hopes to contin
ue bringing their "A" game this
weekend when they travel with the
Cardinal to Berkeley fora
matchup against perennial rival
No. 15 (California (10-3-1,3-1 -0) on
Saturday afternoon at 2:00 p.m.
According to Graham, the back

four's improvement stems from a
long learning process dating back
to the beginning of the year.
"We gave up a lot of goals early
in the season, so I think we've real
ly improved throughout the sea
son in terms of what we expect
from each other and what our
roles are on defense," Graham
said. "We've now know each
other's strengths and weaknesses,
and we've figured out a system
that we understand and have
bought into."
Compounding the inevitable
rough spots at the beginning of the
year is that the defense had to cope
with the loss of solid defenders Lee
Morrison and Aaron Biddle to
graduation.
However, with Maines, a valu
able substitute last season, and

has been superb, as Stanford has yielded only two goals in six games.
fender for the U.S. under-20 na
tional team, filling those spots,
head coach Bret Simon and the
rest of the team had no doubt
that the unit would eventually be
just fine.
"These guys have stepped in
and done a greatjob in helping the
defense remain as a team
strength," Dunivant said. "Putting
Aaron back here was a no brainer
because of his experience, and
Chad's been great. 1 fe's so solid in
the air. I le's a been a rock lot us
back there."
With the introduction of
Maines and Marshall into the line
up, many forget that the Cardinal
has two senior veterans in Graham
and Dunivant.
Besides depending on his in
stinctive ability to win balls on
the ground and in the air, Gra
ham has been looked upon as
the vocal leader of the defense.
Playing in the center, he lias to
organize his fellow defenders in
the backfield.
Graham has also served as a
mentor to several young players
on the team, including Marshall,
as the freshman continues to be
come more and more comfort
able with the Cardinal's style of
play.
"On the under-17 and under
-20 [national teams], we also played
the llat back four formation, but
we played it differently than from
here. It has been nice to have Tay
lor explain it to me."
On the outside, the Cardinal
has two players who had to make

the switch from offense to being
more defensive-minded. Al
though both Mainesand Dunivant
have settled into a defensive role
on the team, the two former at
tacking midfielders enable Simon
to implement effective attacks
from the back.
I lowever, the last thing that the
team needs is for two defenders to
get so caught up with the offense
that they forget their defensive du
ties. According to Graham, this is
why playing as a unit is so essential.
"We like to send guys forward
on the attack, so that puts a lot of
pressure on the back four and de
fensive midfielder to stop the ball
and give the guys time to get be
hind the ball," Graham said. "As a
back four, we can see the majori
ty of what's going on and where
the ball is going. We all just work
as a unit."
However, the unit might be
without Dunivant, who is current
ly nursing a quadriceps injury,
against California. He held out of
training this past week, and it will
be a game-time decision whether
he'll be on the field.
Although California is coming
off a 2-1 loss to UCI A, the Golden
Bears are a team brimming with
confidence. Before that loss, they
racked up a team-record-breaking
winning streak of nine games and
are currently tied with UCLA atop
the Pac-fO standings.
"[Cal] is very confident and
playing a good style of soccer,"
Simon said. "They have good ba
sics, good players and they work
very hard getting better over time.
The biggest thing is for us is to play
hard and confidently. The players
responded very well this week. It
will be a great game."
