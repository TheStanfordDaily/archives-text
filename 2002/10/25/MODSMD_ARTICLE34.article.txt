Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) went face
to face with the 49ers at Avery Aquatics Center
for the second time this season. Stanford, boast
ing a 10-6 victory over Long Beach earlier this
season, looked even more dominating in the re
match, taking a 14-6 win over (lie 49ers.
On the following day, the Bruins visited
Stanford's home pool for their first match up
with the Cardinal of the season. Long time ri
vals, Stanford and UCLA put on an intense and
emotional show at Avery, which was crammed
with excited fans from both teams. Because of
the tremendous ability on each side of the pool,
both teams were forced to focus on their pass
ing games and on executing a tightly coordi
nated offense.

In one of the biggest games of the season, ju
nior Mike Derse led the Cardinal in scoring,
netting several crucial goals after fast breaks
that contributed to the win. Speedy senior Jelf
Nesmith guaranteed Stanford possession of the
ball every period by outracing his opponent
during the opening sprints. The game was one
of the closest Stanford has had this season, as
the Cardinal narrowly edged the Bruins by a
margin of only two goals, 7-5.
With those successes under its belts, Stan

ford looks forward to encountering its biggest
rival UCLA once again this weekend in South
ern California.
The game against Irvine gives Stanford an
other chance to prove itself against the
Anteaters, whom they defeated 9-6 in the third
place match at the NorCal Tournament earlier
this month.
