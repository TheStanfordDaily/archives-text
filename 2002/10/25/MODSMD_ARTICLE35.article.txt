# A 						legendary runner; there was no one quite like
## Blazin' Ben Eastman 
### TORI BABIN 
World records have been set,
broken and set again at Stanford
for decades now. With a strong
population of multifaceted stu
dent athletes who can compete at
the international level in many
sports, as well as perform in the
classroom, Stanford's reputation
has grown to represent excel
lence in many arenas.
One of the athletes that built
this tradition, Benjamin Bangs
Eastman, affectionately known
as "Biazin' Ben," died on Oct. 6
at the age of 91.
Eastman's achievements as a
runner are extensive: He won a
silver medal at the 1932
Olympics in Los Angeles, set
world records in the 440-yard,
400-meter, 800-yard, 800-
meter, 500-yard and 650-yard
races — his record at 440 yards
stood for 40 years. His legacy at
Stanford has not been forgotten.
His athletic ability was the
kind that demanded attention
and awards for many years, yet
his character only matched, if

not superceded, his extraordi
nary physical talents. Biazin' Ben
was a man who put modesty,
fairness and honesty above all
else.
His trophies were never dis
played in his home; he rarely
volunteered information about a
career that is still celebrated for
having changed middle-distance
running permanently. East
man's work ethic extended not
only to his athletic career, but
also to his family life. He spent
his last years working in his
beloved apple orchards, sur
rounded by his wife, three sons,
seven grandchildren and four
great-grandchildren.
To his son, Ben Eastman Jr.,
these values became the defining
memories of his father, rather
than time trials or Olympic
records. According to his son,
Biazin' Ben was often known as
the "absolute fairest person any
one who ever knew him knew."
The values he instilled in his son
were centered on humility, kind
ness and the patience to listen,
along with the value of deriving

satisfaction from working hard.
When Biazin' Ben and his
wife were first dating, she
couldn't understand why he was
recognized everywhere they
went —he simply hadn't told
her of his athletic success and
growing fame. Eastman Jr. also
explained that his father was al
ways eager and ready to "talk ap
ples or community," but time or
race records were far from a rou
tine conversation topic.
For Biazin' Ben, track was a
passion, but never an obsession.
Will Rogers once commented on
Eastman's humility when they
met at the Olympics.
"You're one of the few peo
ple who've done what you've
done and your hat still fits,"
Rogers said.
Eastman's accompiishments
were featured in Time magazine
on July 11, 1932, but unlike
other stars or athletes that des
perately stay in the limelight as
long as possible, he was ready to
retire from his athletic career
when the time came.
He graduated from Stanford

with a degree in economics in
1933 and earned a master's in
business administration in 1935.
He married and started a family,
bringing his sons to all of the Stan
ford home athletic events with the
free lifetime pass lie had earned.
Eastman then worked fora
diesel engine company, an
equipment business, and later
moved to Colorado. His strong
drive led him to start a fruit farm
from a Sears equipment kit, and
he found another passion, this
time for growing apples. He was
elected to the Colorado Agricul
tural Commission and served for
12 years.
if Eastman could give advice
to Stanford students loday, his
son said that he would "want
them to work hard to maintain
an ethical posture at all times,"
and uphold sound priorities in
"putting family first."
Although times have changed
since Blazin' Ben attended the
Farm, his sage advice still holds
its importance in the athletic,
academic and personal lives of
students 70 years later.

1933 and earned a master's in
business administration in 1935.
He married and started a family,
bringing his sons to all of the Stan
ford home athletic events with the
free lifetime pass lie had earned.
Eastman then worked fora
diesel engine company, an
equipment business, and later
moved to Colorado. His strong
drive led him to start a fruit farm
from a Sears equipment kit, and
he found another passion, this
time for growing apples. He was
elected to the Colorado Agricul
tural Commission and served for
12 years.
if Eastman could give advice
to Stanford students loday, his
son said that he would "want
them to work hard to maintain
an ethical posture at all times,"
and uphold sound priorities in
"putting family first."
Although times have changed
since Blazin' Ben attended the
Farm, his sage advice still holds
its importance in the athletic,
academic and personal lives of
students 70 years later.
