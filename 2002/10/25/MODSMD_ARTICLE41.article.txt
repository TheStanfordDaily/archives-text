# Community protests potential war
## 
### ALI ALEMOZAFAR STAFF WRITER 
A peaceful protest against the cur
rent U.S. government's policies with
Iraq took place yesterday at Stanford's
White Plaza. With a "Rally for Peace"
backdrop, a panel of speakers consist
ing of Stanford students and faculty
spoke critically of U.S. intervention
with Iraq.
Sponsored by the Stanford Com
munity for Peace and Justice, the
noontime event attracted more than
200 individuals from Stanford and the
surrounding community.
One of the main objectives of the
protest was to challenge the U.S. for
eign policy on Iraq. Arguments were
made to dissuade the public against a
possible war with Iraq on the basis
that, among other things, the human
costs and causalities of the war would
outweigh the benefits.
"A lot of people in the U.S. will not
benefit from the so-called profits of the

war," said senior Lolita Roibal.
Jim Burklo of the United Campus
Christian Ministry also addressed
the crowd.
"Before we even consider waging
war against Iraq, we have a lot of work
to do in this country," Burklo said.
"We need to come up with a resolution
to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
Burklo further added that we
should not allow President Bush to
"deputize himself as the sheriff of the
entire planet."
"This isn't just about Iraq, it's
about the big picture," Religious
Studies Prof. Thomas Sheehan told
the crowd.
"World War IV, the one we are
just about to embark on, lias no end,
according to [Secretary of State] Don
ald Rumsfeld," Sheehan said. "The
Iraq war is one small chess piece . . .
we will be the constable of the globe as
we impose American hegemony onto
the world."
History Prof. David Como gave his

insights into the current Iraqi situa
tion as well.
"What our government is trying to
do is to create a new balance of
power," Como said. "It is much more
than a war against al-Qaida, much
more than a war against terror."
Commenting on the Iraq issue,
freshman Allen Cheung, a member of
the crowd, said "I believe that this war
against Iraq is morally wrong. This
war is not in the U.S.'s interest."
"The current leaders don't care
about my well-being, your well-being .
.. the future of America," added Man
deep Gill, a graduate student in
physics. "They think about keeping
wealthy in their small circles."
Senior Calvin Miaw, one of the co
ordinators of the rally, was pleased
with the event's turnout.
"When a lot of [the crowd] left, they
were committed to thinking about
how they can oppose the war," he said.
"I love my country, I love my Hag .
. . protest is patriotic," Burklo added.
