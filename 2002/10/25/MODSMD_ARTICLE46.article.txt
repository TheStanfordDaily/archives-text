# Ed Norton tastes like faua beans
## Red Dragon takes on the Tooth Fairy 
### PHIL FLORES 
"Red Dragon" feels like a movie that
would have been more successful if its
more distinguished ancestor, 1991 's
"The Silence of the Lambs," or its more
vilified sequel, 2001's "Hannibal,"
hadn't been released before it. Yet, di
rector Brett Ratner ("Rush Hour") and
screenwriter l ed Tally do well to try to
overcome the audience's built-in ex
pectations of a "Hannibal" flick (gross
moments, humans-as-food jokes, etc.)
and produce a well-crafted thriller.
The film isn't on par with "Silence" but
nonetheless provides the audience with
a good amount of scare.
The film boasts an all-star cast featur
ing Ed Norton as FBI agent Will Gra
ham. Ralph Fiennes as the "Tooth Fairy"
killer and, of course, Sir Anthony Hop
kins as Dr. Hannibal "The Cannibal"
Lector. The movie tells the story of

Agent Graham's re-re
cruitment into the FBI

and his pursuit of a serial killer

who bites his female vic
tims, hence the pet name
"Tooth Fairy." Follow
ing in the same concept
as established by "Si
lence," Graham seeks
and receives help from
the good doctor whom

he also captured.
For the most part, the cast is excel
lent. Norton instills a tired determina
tion and intelligence into Graham that
would normally escape less talented ac-

tors. Fiennes, who has been largely ab-
sent in film fora little over two years,
makes a commendable return as serial
killer Francis Dolarhyde. He comes off
as a truly tortured man whose obses-

sion with William Blake pictures gets
the better of him. Supporting actors
Philip Seymour Hoffman and Emily
Watson also give good turns as a
charmless tabloid reporter and

Dolarhyde's blind friend, respectively,
Despite its fine acting, the film will al
ways be compared to its earlier "Hanni
bal Lector" brethren. In fact, while Uni
versal has been marketing the film as

the prequel to "The Silence of the
Lambs," it is really a re-adaptation of an
earlier "Red Dragon" film titled "Man
hunter." Released in 1986, the novv
cnit film was directed by then-novice au
teur Michael Mann who has since built
an impressive collection of movies with
" The Insider" and "Meat" among them.
Burdened by its "Silence" legacy,
this film along with Ripley Scott's
"Hannibal" have slowly tainted Mr.
Hopkin's original performance as the
deranged psychologist. Through both
movies, the character has evolved from
a truly terrifying force of nature into a
caricature of one. While I'm not insin
uating that Hopkins as Hannibal can't
still make babies cry, my fears have less
ened since Hannibal the Cannibal be
came such a cultural icon. And don't
get me started on that whole "fava
beans and chianti" phenomenon.
Taken as a self-contained flick, "Red
Dragon" is pretty good as far as studio
films go these days. Hie movie has a
nice sleek look that stylistically fits in be
tween "Silence" (muted colors) and
"Hannibal" (heavily saturated colors).
The cinematography by Dante Spinot
ti ("Heat," "The Insider") is fantastic,
and the script by Ted Tally who also
won the Oscar for his "Silence" script
faithfully translates much of the origi
nal book.
