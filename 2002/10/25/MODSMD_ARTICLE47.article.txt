# Hate anime? Don't.
## 'Cowboy Bebop' nipple-twistingly brilliant 
### SHAWN STANDEFER 
If you haven't heard of
"Cowboy Bebop," walk down
the hall to the anime fan in
your dorm and ask him to show
it to you — it is incredibly cool.
"Cowboy Bebop" tells the tale
ofa group of four hapless space
bounty hunters in their pursuit
of money, love and personal
satisfaction. There's Spike
Spiegel, the martial arts master
and focus of the plot. Jet Black,
the ex-cop, Faye Valentine, the
amnesiac mysterious chick, Ed,
the child hacker, and their
Welsh corgi Ein.
It might sound a little odd,
but the show has a lot of charm
and kicks much ass. Recently,
"Cowboy Bebop: the Movie"
(subtitled "Knockin' on Heav
en's Door" in Japan) had its
VV 7 est Coast premier showing at
the Metreon Anime Festival in
the Verba Buena Center for
the Arts. The movie, like the se
ries, is pretty sweet.
"Cowboy Bebop: the Movie"
is wonderful, fitting into the
chronology about four

episodes before the end of the series. It introduces a
new villain, Vincent, for Spike and company to
chase, 112 le is an elite commando that was driven in
sane by military experiments. When you go insane,

the obvious thing to do is to try to kill as many people as possible, and Vin-

cent wants to do exactly that using leukocyte-shaped nanoma-

chines. He plans to unleash these nanomachines in

small explosions all around the city. Being ther
insane survivor of weird medical experiments,
Vincent has a huge bounty put on his head. That
money is what gets Spike and friends to go after
him.
The characters develop some during the
course of the movie as well. The focus is on Spike.
I lis role can be summed up in one word: badass.
He has some great light scenes. His interaction

with the new chick, Electra, is interesting to watch too — there is definite
tension between the two of them. Anyway, Spike takes a beating and keeps
011 going; at one point, he gets shot through the abdomen, falls out ola sus
pended train, and lands in the ocean, but ends up okay. II nothing else, you
can watch the action scenes in this movie and come away fairly satisfied with
their technical brilliance.
The TV series was noted for its high animation quality, great stories, cool
characters and neat music. The movie's animation raises the bar to an even
higher level. I thought the animation would look nice, but it was even more
fluid and well done than I had expected.
fhe movie meshes well with the series. So well, in fact, that it watches
more like a two hour long, high-budget episode than a movie itself. While
this could be a bad point about some shows, this isn't a bad thing for "Cow
boy Bebop." Since the series consisted mostly of one-off episodes, it
wouldn't be the style of the show to have an epic story thrust into the mid
dle of its chronology. "Cowboy Bebop" has an anti-epic feeling, focusing on
the four characters exciting, but small lives. This same feeling was kept for
the movie. Since the show is so good as is, it was good to see that they kept
the flavor intact.
l'he movie kicks ass. If you're a fan of the show, you must see the movie.
If you're not a fan of the show, find the anime fan in your dorm that has all
of it, watch their copy, and then you'll be a fan. The movie is geared towards
the people that know the show; if you like one, you'll like the other. They're
both genius in animated form.
