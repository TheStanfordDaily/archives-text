# The 						United Nations Assocation Film Fest: Better than I-Hum
## 
### EDITORIAL STAFF 
So you're too broke to attend the Venice
Film Festival. Your clothes aren't flashy
enough to make it in Cannes. And you're
way too sketched out by Utah to even think
of going to Sundance. The answer to your
problems: the United Nations Association
Film Festival (UNAFF).
I remember attending the festival last
year, more by force than by choice, really.
My frequently loathed I-Huin professors
had made ii mandatory for my class to at
tend a multicultural or ethnic event, and
while that was by no means a problem for
me, procrastination certainly was. It was five
o'clock in the afternoon when I opened up
my organizer to see in big red writing,
"PAPER DUE TOMORROW — DON'T
FORGET, DUMB ASS!"
After scrambling to find happenings in
the city or on campus, 1 was impeded by
sold-out shows, the unpredictable Caltrain
and the great luck of an event being sched
uled on every possible night but that dread
ed Thursday. I had seen flyers advertising
UNAFF. but 1 had originally been put olfby
the technicality of the "United Nations As
sociation" title. But beggars can't be
choosers, so, bitter and reluctant, 1 went off
to the film festival.
I caught the last feature of the evening,
which was titled "In the Light of Rever
ence," directed by Christopher McCleod.
Through a series of interviews, images and
song, the documentary offered an insider's
perspective on the modern intrusion ofcor-

porations and resi
dents on the sacred
lands of Native
a : i

Americans. I
didn't know what
to think or feel

after the film —
anger, sadness,
worry or guilt.

What I did
know was
that I had

been

forced to think and that by the end of the
night, I had finally begun to appreciate my
I-Hum professors for this worthwhile as
signment.
These are the types of movies presented

at UNAFF. More than
your average popcorn
flicks, the films are
I bought-provoking, in
triguing and intelligent,
highlighting issues of
modern political and
philanthropic debate,
while going easy on the
sometimes overwhelm
ing "artsy-fartsy"-ness.
Stanford students and
surrounding communi
ties are attracted to the
festival's explicit inten
tion to gather films from
around the world, made
by renowned filmmakers
originally from or por
traying places like Nepal,
Palestine, Japan and
Italy.
Brought to you by the
Stanford Film Society and
the UNA Midpeninsula
Chapter, the fifth annual
UNAFF begun last night
and will run through Sun
day in Stanford's Cubber
ley and Annenberg Audi
toriums. The opening
and closing receptions
will feature international
cuisine, as well as music by
Potential and a photo ex
hibition by Share Interna
tional. With this year's
theme, "Humanity is In
divisible," the bill will offer
such films as "Gaza Strip"
(Israel/Palestine/USA),
"Covered by Chocolate"
(Germany) and the 9/11
documentary "Under
ground Zero" (USA).

So try to make your way over to the film
festival this weekend for some eye and brain
candy. You can have the intensity of all
those other famous film festivals, without all
the hoopla and without having to travel

across the world. There are definitely no
crumpled-newspaper fights or shameless
flashes of nudity (like at Stanford's favorite
Sunday night activity), but who knows, you
might just learn something.
