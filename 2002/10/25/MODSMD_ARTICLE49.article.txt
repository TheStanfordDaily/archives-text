# Guitarist Hammond strokes ego, own booty
## 
### NASTASSIA LOPEZ 
"We never thought we'd be this big," gui
tarist Albert Hammond Jr. sheepishly ad
mitted. "We wanted to get a lot of people to
hear our music — but no, not this big." Any
one who thinks " The Strokes" are either 1. a
type of sexual foreplay, 2. a swim technique
or a medical condition, must have taken
up temporary residence on the moon for the
past year. The Strokes have toured (and sold
out venues in) both America and Europe
multiple times, graced dozens of magazine
covers, and "Is This It" (their debut album)
is on its way to platinum status. Not to men
tion they have three singles circulating the
airwaves right now and were asked to open
for The Rolling Stones this fall.
Despite their popularity, they've been
criticized by many who resent the bands' af
fluent lineage and by those who despise
everything mainstream that was once a bril
liant underground act. Hut there's absolute
ly no denying that The Strokes have resur
rected the pop/rock that was first introduced
by The Ramones, and The Velvet Under
ground, while generating the same vintage
raunchiness that existed within the music of
the 1970s and 80s.
Talking to guitarist Albert Hammond
was like having a discussion with Michael
Kelso from "That '70s Show." With his un
abashedly light hearted and laid back man
ner, the only thing missing between him and
I was a six-pack of Heinekens and a Cars 8-
track on loop.
INTERMISSION: Do you miss playing the
small New York club scene?
HAMMOND: No. It's a dump. Once you
move out, you miss the good times, but it's
like high school: You miss it, but you don't
want to go back.
INTERMISSION: You guys have been la
beled as the second coming of The Velvet
Underground. Which bands have you been
influenced by musically?
HAMMOND: Oh, so many. Let's just say
this: we were influenced by the 50s, 60s, 70s,
80s and 90s.
INTERMISSION: What has been the worst
part of being famous?
HAMMOND: Are we famous?
INTERMISSION: Yes.
HAMMOND: Nothing has been bad; it
hasn't been horrible yet. It's still cool; we still
have our privacy.
INTERMISSION: You've recently opened
for one of the biggest bands iu history (the
Rolling Stones). How did you feel when you
were asked to do those shows with them?
HAMMOND: Pretty crazy. It was fun and a
little surreal. Sharing the stage with them
was just fuc king weird.
INTERMISSION: In an interview with
MTV, you guys said that you didn't want to
acquire the "big band" mentality. You have
to admit that you guys are huge right now; is
it hard not letting your ego get to you?
HAMMOND: We never said that. I don't
know where MTV got that. Actually, I want
to be bigger than any band in the world right
now. We're really proud of [the bandj. We
want it to reach everyone. We don't have

egos; we have confidence. It's too soon for
egos to go up anyway.
INTERMISSION: I've 1 leard that you guys
don't even break a sweat when you're on
stage. How are you able to emit the same en
ergy night after night and make it look so
easy?
HAMMOND: (laughs) It's just practice and
a lot of time playing in the studio. It's like
watching a great tennis player do what he
does. It's all about practicing.
INTERMISSION: How do you confront
the fact that people believe your group's suc
cess was more than just luck, and had some
thing to do with the band's wealth and af
fluent background?
HAMMOND: 1 think if people want to be
ignorant, you know, than they can be igno
rant. It's just a bummer to think that as a

band, you work so hard, and that's what
people say about you, you know? It's OK if
you don't like us because of our music, but
if you don't like us because of our back
ground, that's just ignorant. There are so
many bands out there that come from well
to-do families that people don't even know
about, or aren't mentioned in magazines —
and I won't mention their names. I can't
help but think that if we were a group that
grew up in the ghetto, we would be a bigger
band.
INTERMISSION: All of you quit college in
order to focus on the band, what advice do
you give to college bands that want to follow
your lead, hoping to find success and get
signed?
HAMMOND: Julian was out of college; Fab
was done; Nick and Nicolai had just started.
It just felt right. Our manager was getting

us better gigs, and we were selling out
places. And then we were asked to tour Eng
land, and I was just like, 'fuck [school]' and
we left. In the end you have to feel that
you're making the right decision, and then
do it.
INTERMISSION: Because you were a
band that evolved in New York, did you
guys feel a need or have you fell a need to
write a song dealing with the event of Sept.
11?
HAMMOND: No. 1 mean, I think Sept. 11
was a terrible, horrible thing and I tell really
sad about it — you know, we were there in
New York when it happened — but we just
don't do any of that political shit. We're still
in the stage where we're a pop band.
INTERMISSION: How do you feel about
the other bands that you've been grouped
into a category with (like The White Stripes,
The Vines, The Hives)?
HAMMOND: I really don't think anything
about it. I don't think we all think the same
way [musically] either. I think the maga
zines just grouped us all together to sell
more magazines.
INTERMISSION: What bands are you re
ally into right now?
HAMMOND: We're really into Rooney
[Rooney's lead singer, Robert Shwartzman,
is nephew of Francis Ford Copolla and
brother of Phantom Planet's Jason Shwartz
man]. We took them on the road with us.
But right now I'm listening to some old stuff
from the 80s like The Cars, Boy George,
Billy Idol and some other one hit wonders.
INTERMISSION: Is the response any dif
ferent from American fans as opposed to Eu
ropean fans when you guys are touring?
HAMMOND: Each city and each place is
very different. Sometimes it seems like
you're in Europe at some venues in Ameri
ca, and sometimes it can feel like you're in
America when you're in Europe.
INTERMISSION: How much pressure do
you feel knowing that so many music critics
and America in general are looking to you
guys to resurrect rock?
HAMMOND: Well, you can't really do any
thing about it, you can't say, 'if I work really
hard they'll like it better.' Critics,journalists,
they can say that they hate your second cd
and then two years later say it was the best
shit they've ever heard. We're just going to
create the stuff that sounds good to us.
INTERMISSION: In less than two years
you guys have been in tons of magazines,
played all the late shows, toured the world
and your record "It" has almost reached
platinum. What is next for The Strokes?
HAMMOND: Wow, that sounds pretty
good.
INTERMISSION: It is really good.
HAMMOND: Well, this is our last tour of
America, and after we're done, we'll take
some time oil and record in February or
March of next year. This tour is our good
bye to this record [Is This It]. It's been quite
a ride—l can't imagine where it's gonna go.
The Strokes will he ploying at the Bill Graham
Civic ('.enter Oct. 31.


"Shit man, where's the C string again?"
