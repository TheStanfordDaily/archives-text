# Their first new record in 20 years
## 'Nextdoorland': The Soft Boys to Men 
### MICHAEL BAER 
The Soft Boys was one of those
bands, that, like Big Star and the Vel
vet Underground, were far more in
fluential than they were successful.
In fact, before giving reunion album
"Nextdoorland" a spin, I'd never
heard a Soft Boys song, though I'd
heard many by their proteges (e.g.
R.E.M.) and later bands by Soft Boys
alumni (e.g. Robyn Hitchcock and
the Egyptians). At first, my igno
rance made me hesitant to review
this album, but, seeing as how most
readers probably couldn't think of
any Soft Boys song either, it's likely
most appropriate, and I certainly
won't be hung up by any memories
of "how it used to be" 20-some years
back.

So here are the facts: Soft Boys
came together in 1976 and fell apart
in 1981. They were a semi-psyche-

delic folk-pop-rock

band as

®The Soft Boys
Nextdoorland

as I can explain; it's really hard to cat
egorize anything led by the eclectic
and absurdist Englishman known as
Robyn Hitchcock. Highlights from
their career include "(I Want to Be
an) Anglepoise Lamp" and "Where
Are the Prawns?" — weird songs
about weird things.
Reunion album "Nextdoorland"
doesn't fall too far from the tree, with
titles like "My Mind is Connected to
Your Dreams" (a mellow song) and
"Japanese Captain" (a light and
vaguely sexual love song). These

songs don't go for outright
L ridiculousness, but that nev-
I ertheless hint at the group's
F modus operandi. The album
kicks off with the good-na-

tured, mostly instrumental
k "I Love Lucy." "Mr.

Kennedy," the most rocking song on
the album, seems to be about weath
er or travel or something like that,
with the joyfully sung refrain,
"Maybe it'll rain! Maybe it'll rain
tonight!" "Strings" is a head-bobbing
song which may be about women or
about nothing at all or perhaps about
the current political era, singing
"Evil is the new enemy. Evil is the
new bad." And "Lions and Tigers"
ends the album on a light note,
telling us "Lions and tigers eat the
same bits as each other." Whatever
that's supposed to mean.
Most of the other songs mix the
absurdist and sexual into an easy
going, stream-of-consciousness re
flection on love and relationships.
Bright guitars bring to mind early
R.E.M., which makes sense, as this
was one band influenced by the Soft
Boys. By contrast, the production is
clear and simple, so the band has no
room to hide any defects in musi
cianship. Fortunately, there is noth
ing negative to hide, and the songs
are catchy; in some sense, this is a
nearly perfect album.
Still, it's actually quite hard to
make heads or tails of most of the
songs. Then again, it's not as
though this is something new for
the band, especially for Hitchcock,
who has made a lifelong career of
this. The members gel quite well,
but this still isn't music made for the
unwashed masses; it's not even
made for most people with relative
ly eclectic taste. But for those with a
love of the abstract and the absurd
— or a love of early Soft Boys — the
Soft Boys reunion is quite success
ful indeed.
