Listening to "Quality Control," Jurassic :Vs first lull
length album, you can't help but get the impression that the
group basically consists of six guys sitting down, hanging

out and having fun while
fucking around with some
microphones and a stack of
old vinyl. The record's
sound was a bit rough and
the whole production
echoed Kool Moe Dee, the
Furious 5 and Grandmaster
Flash.

Power In
Numbers

More than that, though, producers Cut Chemist and
Nu-Mark succeed in lending a sense of chaos to the whole
album, giving it credibility as a product of the metropolitan
Los .Angeles area. In short, "Quality Control" sounds like it
was recorded one sunny Saturday morning while jamming
in the park.
"Power In Numbers" sounds completely different,
which means that for better or worse, many people will
write this album off as disingenuous. Fundamentally, it re
places "Quality Control's" sunny demeanor with the ambi
ence of night. The sound is slicker, clearly aimed at widen
ing the group's audience. In fact, the record's first single,
"What's Golden," has been appearing everywhere from
MTV to college radio to corporate "alternative" rock sta
tions. .Another song, "Thin Line" features vocals by Nelly
Furtado. 'ITiat said, it's easy to sympathize with those who
are ready to dismiss this album and the group altogether.
On the other hand, however, Jurassic s's original charm
is readily displayed on "Power In Numbers." The group
will always be comprised of six performers who (with the
exception of Nu-Mark and (ait C Ihemist) probably couldn't
do much at all on their own, but work together remarkably
well. Additionally, the group displays more dexterity here
than on previous albums.
While "After School Special" is a classic J5 group jam ses
sion, "Hey" is a sweet, lazy reflection on what makes fora
great party: terrific music and people you love. "I Am
Somebody" is unadulterated, dirty funk with a sample lift
ed straight from a Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff record.
Other songs, however, are much darker.
"A Day At I Tie Races," features a last, fluid, rippin' bass
line and pairs J5 with classic MCs Percee P and Big Daddy
Kane. "Remember His Name," one of the LP's best tracks
traces each rapper's recollection of a dead neighborhood
gangster. "What's Golden" even samples Public Enemy's
"Prophets of Rage."
Though it's sometimes disappointing to see the group
tweak a formula that worked pretty well for two albums, it's
was also about time fora change. Though "Power In Num
bers" reflects mixed results, the basic essence that made
Jurassic 5 so appealing is still here.
