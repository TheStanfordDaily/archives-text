# Cockney rap deemed awesome
## 
### KEVIN LIM 
Seven months after detonating in Mother
England, The Streets' "Original Pirate Mate
rial" has been launched on a US-bound
IGBM roaring on the wings of rave reviews
and fueled by pulsating hype. And hang on
yankee-yee-haw cowboys, don't worry, be
cause perhaps we'll learn to love this bomb.
Though this album should come with a
glossy Fodor's guide and an array of abus
able substances, you're all alone in a foreign
world where the bitches are birds, fries are
chips and a cocky Birmingham man isn't hir
ing voice coaches to hide his cockney twist.
"Original Pirate Material" is a British urban
liaison that forces us to understand how un
weird it is to refer to Coke as "pop," and
shows off a white rapper who goes way be
yond whining about mommas and overdue
closet chores.
Being young in America means groov
ing your "what the hell is this" sensory path
ways, what with Hollywood CG mutating
Tobey Maguire, vanilla twisting our sodas,
Trojans numbing to last and dri-fit shirts,
well, keeping the fit dry. The first run-

around with "Original Pirate
Material" takes does a dance
down these neurons and in
evitably begs the question,
"What the hell IS this?"
The urge to classify is too
powerful. It's UK Garage (say

"GEHR-edge"), a descendant of disco, ac
cording to pros in the know, but as with any
firsts, there's a pressure to tie new foreign ex
periences back to the familiars. Hip hop?
Well, these beats are good, but tail a bit slow
for standard club chatter, aren't aggressive
enough for hip hop and resist being pre
dictable pop-rap samples. But is he even rap
ping? It's so ... conversational, too prosaic.
Spoken word perhaps? Autobiographical
poetry slam? Above all, Skinner's accent is
laid down thick, and the deluge of slang does
nothing to help an American audience wash
it down. It just seems deliriously wrong;
Tupac never sat down to tea and crumpets at
three; what the hell is Skinner talking about?
Finally, the categorizer in us just falls ex
hausted onto the pavement.
While some of the tracks on this album
seem like throwaways, and the vocals of Skin-

®The Streets
Original Pirate
Material

ner's supporting cast are often unnecessary
and annoying, the album coherently flows.
And though the novelty of the cockney accent
eventually fades, and the rhythms are some
times subpar, the shell-life of "Original Pirate
Material" is in its well-crafted, insightful lyrical
twists and turns. The tracks weave tales of
young disillusioned Brits, with each cocktail
being some mix of brandy, irony, barbitu
rates, rage, Playstation gaming and painful
disillusionment.
"Turn the Page" has Skinner admitting
that he's "45tli Generation Roman" and
painting a Gladiator epic on top of his excru
ciatingly standard garage-club lifestyle. Skin
ner serves as an eloquent advocate on behalf
of his constituents. "The Irony of it All" is a
compelling satire, contrasting an peaceful
herb-inhaling "criminal" and a violent, alco
holic "law abider." Skinner's sober "Stay Posi

tive" solemnly grabs his heroin-addicted
peers by the arm and reassures them: "It's
that world out there that's flicked you you're
no less of a person and if God exists He still
loves you ... you're the same as lam we all
need our Samaritan." The entire disc is laced
with fabulous images and rhymes, juggling
Smirnoff Ice rounds, Batman and Jackie
Chan daydreams and drugged-up Chinese
take-out runs.
"Original Pirate Material" indicts listen
ers for complaining about the homogeneity
of music, but doing voting in favor of the
dreary sameness with their wallets. Though
most Americans are outside the scope and
the scene that The Streets are aiming for, the
sheer uniqueness of this material on this side
of the pond makes it worthwhile, and worth
the dollars. Don't expect to get it, hut do ex
pect to get hooked.

compelling satire, contrasting an peaceful
herb-inhaling "criminal" and a violent, alco
holic "law abider." Skinner's sober "Stay Posi

peers by the arm and reassures them: "It's
that world out there that's flicked you you're
no less of a person and if God exists He still
loves you ... you're the same as lam we all
need our Samaritan." The entire disc is laced

Smirnoff Ice rounds, Batman and Jackie

take-out runs.
"Original Pirate Material" indicts listen
ers for complaining about the homogeneity
of music, but doing voting in favor of the
dreary sameness with their wallets. Though

sheer uniqueness of this material on this side
of the pond makes it worthwhile, and worth
the dollars. Don't expect to get it, hut do ex
pect to get hooked.
