# Roxy Sass, Full Moon Manhunter
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
Oh, how to describe the glorious sketchfest that is
Full Moon on the Quad? It's the potent combination
of undergraduate hormones, a fetching midnight
moon and tradition. Where everyone is intoxicated in
some way or another; where a mob mentality of blithe
horniness overtakes freshman and senior alike;
where the last people you'd ever want to see naked
run around.
Now, don't be misled by the event's high dick-to
chick ratio, Ms. Siiss and other female participants
enjoy the debauchery just as much as the guys do,
perhaps even more so. Full Moon allows us to get the
physical contact we crave without dealing with any of
the dreaded self-respect issues that often accompany
ii — it's a fun, safe sampler pack of play.

This year, five of my girlfriends and I decided to
put a spin on the tradition by turning it into a yummy,
flesh-based scavenger hunt. We crafted a list of 16 dif
ferent categories of guys to suck face with, including:

1. Sleazy frat guy (we wanted to start off with some
thing easy)
4. Blast from the past (an ex: messy, but necessary)
11-12. Surf'n' Turf (2 varsity athletes: one from a
water sport, one from a field sport)
15. A guy wearing a red hat (we had run out of cre
ativity by this point)
The scavenger hunt was a wild success. Motivated
by general friskiness and jello shooters, Roxy and
company rampaged through the Quad in search of
our prey. When I spotted someone who fit a catego
ry, I'd chase after him, waving my checklist madly,
screaming, "YOU'RE ON MY LIST! YOU'RE ON
MY LIST!"
The fact that alcohol can make you really compet
itive and horny only accentuated the greatness of the
game. I had to get all those boxes checked, damn it!
Although, as the night wore on, I began to invent cat
egories depending on who I happened to want to kiss
at the time ("I ley, wait-you're a 6'2" Vin Diesel looka
like? Well whaddya know? That's on my list!").
By the end of the night, 21 different fellows had ex
perienced the wonder of tongue wrestling with yours
truly. Sure, some were (much) better than others, and
all began in a ridiculously awkward fashion, but that's
the simple beauty of Full Moon on the Quad.
Stripped bare of the pretense, all acts of physical at
traction — whether at a party, on a date or in bed —
are just plain awkward. Instead of being embarrassed
by it, why not celebrate our gaucherie in this jubilant,
orgiastic, chaotic display?
Besides that, it's a great way to let loose all the pent
up sexual energy that accumulates at this seemingly
sexless, definitely dateless campus. Because you know
that next Monday night, when you're alone at your
desk, toiling over your Econ 102A problem set, you'll
silently wish that the moon were full again.
