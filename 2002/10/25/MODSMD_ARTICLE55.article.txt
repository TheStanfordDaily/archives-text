Freedom of Choice
1980

From the opening riffs of
Devo's 1980 album "Freedom of Choice,"
yon know you're in fora good time,
maybe a different type of a good time,
but a good time nonetheless. "Girl U
Want," the first track on Devo's best sell
ing album is odd by any definition of the
word: A love song caught in the midst of a
calculated chorus of robotic synthesizers,
lyrics that refer to an "aroma of undefined
love" sung in a seeminly programmed
nasal geeky voice. You might note to your
self that this is not a normal band. This is
not normal music.
Devo has always been different, as per
haps one of the few bands where most peo
ple can picture an image of the group in
their mind but not recall any of their faces.
That image is of course of their classic
video for "Whip It" — black sleeveless
shirts, black bycicle shorts, and strange red
art-deco flower pot hats, whipping clothes
off the backs of women. While other
groups have released concept albums,
Devo transcended this idea by creating
themselves as a concept band. Devo ish
short for De-Evolution, the idea that hu
mans aren't moving forward in evolution,
that we are regressing toward neanderthal
status.

The songs on "Freedom of
Choice" have a simple quality to
them while at the same time
boasting original synth sounds,
sort of like Louie Louie being

played on
ill o o g
" no -
ball" are
so simple that the track
takes on a childlike quality, all
the while objectifying the
singers love as a snowball that
could be rolled up and rolled
back down a hill. "Gates of
Steel" is another hard rocker
with a simple yet effective —
yes, you guessed it — synth
intro. Like the final song "Plan
et Earth," "Gates of Steel"
serves as a platform for singer
Mark Mothersbaugh to discuss
the possible fates of the earth.
Devo wavers between these two
types of songs, the de-volved
love song like "Girl U Want" or
"It's Not Right" to songs about
planetary issues like "Gates of
Steel" or the title track.
Most people's appreciation
of Devo usually ends at "Whip

It," which is by all means a great song.
Whats great about "Freedom of Choice" is
that almost all of the songs have a very sim
ilar vibe to "Whip It": Crazy synth sounds,
driving beats and Mothers-

baug h ' s
n e r d yA

vocals, singing about everything from love
to whips to planet earth to snowballs. It's
easy to listen to nearly any song on this
album and picture the men of Devo, in full
"Whip It" regalia, rockingridiculousy hard
and loving every minute of it.
