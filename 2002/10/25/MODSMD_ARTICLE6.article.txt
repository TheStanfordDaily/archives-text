## Planned field show on the social ills of drunk driving fails to make cut 
### MIKEY LEE EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Stanford Department of Athletics decided
earlier this week to not allow the Stanford Band to
perform the pre-game field show it had planned at
Saturday's game between the Stanford football team
and UCLA in Los Angeles.
According to a press release from the Band, the
content of the show intended to bring attention to
"the lack of disciplinary action taken by the UCIA
Athletics Department in response to multiple [Dri
ving Under the Influence] offenses committed by
[UCLA] quarterback Cory Pans."
Earlier this year, Pans was convicted of his second
drunk-driving offense iu 15 months. After spending
96 hours at the Los Angeles County Jail, Pans is cur
rently on probation for the next four years, according
to an article in the Daily Bruin.
"1 think it's pretty fair to say that we have nothing

against Cory Paus as a person," said Mike Huijon,the
Band's public relations director.
The piece that was to be performed, entitled
"Things Upon Which Both Stanford and UCLA Can
Agree," included the following lines: "... But more
seriously, both Stanford and UCLA, students, faculty,
and staff agree that there is nothing more irresponsi
ble than recklessly endangering the lives of others.
Drunk driving kills hundreds of college students
every year. Swift and severe punishments should be
levied to discourage others from making such poor
choices. Because even if it doesn't end your collegiate
athletic career, drinking and driving could end
someone's life."
I he Stanford Athletics Department, which was not
available for comment bv press time, did not allow
that part of the script to be in the upcoming show,
1 luijon said.
The Band has had a history of controversial
acts, including a halftime show versus Notre
Dame in 1991 which allegedly mocked members
of the Catholic faith. Because of that show, the
Band is indefinitely banned from the Notre Dame
campus.
