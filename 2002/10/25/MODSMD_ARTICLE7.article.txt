# Prof to create Korean Studies
## 
### CYNTHIA CHO EDITORIAL STAFF 
Imagine a professor leaving a university
that houses the largest and most compre
hensive Korean Studies program in the
U.S. — one that offers 40 courses taught by
10 tenured and tenure-track faculty — for
an institution that doesn't have one ;it all.
Imagine a professor leaving a university at
which more than 2,000 students enroll in
Korean Studies courses each year fora uni
versity at which most students don't even
know what Korean Studies is.
Gi-Wook Shin, associate professor of so
ciology and senior fellow at the Institute
for International Studies, did just that,
leaving UCLA during the summer of 2000
to come to Stanford, where he is in the
midst of creating the University's first Ko
rean Studies program.
"It is important to show to the University
that there is an interest and demand for Ko
rean Studies at Stanford," Shin said. 1 o iliis
end, Shin has worked to offer Stanford stu
dents opportunities to learn about Korea
both on campus and abroad.
This quarter, students have the option
of taking two courses on Korea. One is a
weekly workshop led by Shin, during
which students read and discuss literary
works on Korea. The other is a course of
fered by Political Science Visiting Prof.
Hyug Baeg I in entitled " The Political
Economy of Industrialization.''
"He is a respected political scientist in
Korea, and I met him first at an academic

conference many years ago. Since then, we
became good friends and colleagues," Shin
said of Im, whose coming to Stanford was in
large part due to Shin.
During winter quarter, Shin will teach
"State and Society in Korea," an introduc
tory course on the history, politics and eco
nomics of 20th-century Korea, for the sec
ond year in a row. For spring quarter, Shin
is working with the Center for East Asian
Studies to have Chin Nyum Jin, a former
deputy prime minister for economic af
fairs in Korea, teach a course on the Kore
an economy.
"While there aren't many courses on Ko
rean currently available to students, there is
[at least] one course offered each quarter,"
Shin said.
In addition to teaching, Shin has created
a bi-weekly speaker series called the "Korea
Luncheon Seminars," which began its sec
ond run this fall. Ihe program, which is
sponsored by the Asia/Pacific Research Ou
ter and the Center for East Asian Studies,
brings lo Stanford distinguished speakers
who address issues relevant to the past, cur
rent and future of Korean and Korean-
American cultures.
"1 created [the program] to offer a regular
forum to discuss issues related to Korea, both
North and South," Shin said.
Foday ai noon, best-selling Korean-
American author Helie Lee will speak
about her book "In the Absence of Sun: A
Korean-American Woman's Promise to Re-
unite Three Lost Generations of
Her Family."
Shin's interaction with stu
dents extends far beyond the
Stanford campus. This past sum
mer, Shin worked with the Over
seas Studies Program and the
Center for East Asian Studies in
giving students opportunities to
study or work in Korea.
Shin taught an overseas semi
nar entitled "Korea in a Globaliz
ing World," which was one of the
four overseas seminars offered by
the Overseas Studies Program.
Shin's seminar, offered in collabo
ration with the Center for East
Asian Studies, addressed concep
tual and theoretical issues related
to globalization and focused on
Korea's place and role in an in
creasingly globalizing world, ac
cording to Shin.
The course was comprised of a
three-hour lecture and discussion
each morning, followed by field
trips to corporations and organiza
tions, including Samsung Elec
tronics and the National Assembly.
"I think it is a great experience
for students," Shin said. "It is an
excellent combination of acade
mics and hands-on work."
At the moment, Shin believes
that he will "most likelv" offer the

seminar for summer 2003,
though he added that plans have
not been finalized yet. Last year,
55 students applied and 15 stu
dents were selected to participate
in the seminar.
In addition to teaching the
overseas seminar, Shin was in
volved with the Center for East
Asian Studies' Summer Intern
ship Program, which offers in
ternships to Stanford undergrad
uates in China, Japan and Korea.
While Shin isn't the official coordi
nator for the internship program,
he helped two students gain in
ternships with Joongang Ilbo, a
national newspaper in Korea, for
last summer.
While Shin is involved with sev
eral co-curricular and extra-cur
ricular activities, his main goal is
establishing a Korean Studies pro
gram here at Stanford.
"It is exciting to create a new
program, and I'm very pleased
with the progress that we have
made over the year. Yet, it re
quires a great deal of energy and
time and I can't possibly do all [of
it] by myself," Shin said.
"Without an adequate infra
structure, it would be impossible to
create a top-notch program. We
definitely need more support
from the University, especially in
hiring more faculty in Korean
Studies, to better accommodate
the growing demand for Korean
Studies from students," he added.
