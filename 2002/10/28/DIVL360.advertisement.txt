VVhatevei, I'm cool. I burn inv tongue on her i love concoction hut I don't
let her see it. I sit real (jiiiet on the cushions anil lead some ol the old porn
mags in the basket. I think Quetzal's plat e was the first time I saw the leiualc
form naked. That's not strictly true, bill I like to think it is.
"Sander, you read those before."
"Always time to reait|uain( myself with sonieol the ureal literary (lassie s,
right, Madame?"
"You are full of crap."
Well, I know it's true, but she didn't have to put it that way. I play the
Injured Young Man and turn my l>a< k on her (a dangerous iliing 10 do, but
you gotta live dangerously.) I stai I i idling through her crystals.
God, they're lieautiful. T.verv color and shape you can imagine, every
variety of stone, polished or not, prepared for one purpose or another. I he
order seems random but if vou know the secret, there's a < lever organization
behind these bins. Nothing is out of place, nothing is by chance. Il scares me
when I think of how much power lies before me.
I his place was where I first found out about how to use the tilings. She
trained me, a voting and inexpei ienced would-be manipulator ol the forces
of life, into the skilled young wizard you see before you today. Problem is, I
started getting way ton powerful for her to control. |ust when I was one step
awav from pel forming the most important spell of my life, she cut me oil. No
woman has ever cut the Sandsteroff besides Quetzal. Hut she did. Not a word
of explanation, not a hint. She left me standing alone on a rocky
moutiiaintop for two days waiting lot her. I hen when I dragged my soggy,
sorry ass back down the hill to ask bet what happened, she wouldn't speak to
me. Apparently Sander wasn't as interesting as he used to lie.
She still sells me crystals, though. I don't know why. She's such a tease.
She holds the secrets that could set me free and won't give them to me. She
sells me the crystals I need more than life itself, hut not a word on how to use
them. I ler library is locked, and I don't know where she hid the key. (living
me vague hints. It irritates me like you wouldn't believe, but you cannot lei
her see that. I'm telling you, you gotta Ik- careful around Quetzal.
"Sander, do not touch the stones."
Do not touch the stones. Do not touch the stones. Do not touch the
goddamn stones? Who do you think you're talking to, Quetzie? li s me, your
Lovely l.amoi i, your young apprentice. You used to let me touch — well,
you gel the idea — and now apparently I can't even lay my slimv fingers on
your precious crystals. Man, thai rubs me the wrong way. I could lilasi her
out of het seal with one flick of my lingers ill only had the pit lure jasper, but
I don't. And she knows it.
