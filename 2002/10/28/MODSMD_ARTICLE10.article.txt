## Angels win World Series 
### 
ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Garret Ander
son, the Anaheim Angels' quiet superstar,
broke out of his extra-base slump ai the per
fect time: Game 7 of the World Series.
Anderson's three-run double in the third
inning propelled the Angels to a 4-1 victory
over the San Francisco Giants yesterday
night and their first championship in their
42-season history.
"I can't believe it, man," he said. "It's over
with. I can smile now."
After the final out, while the Angels cele
brated wildly on the Edison Field infield,
Anderson was off to the side with his family,
holding one of his three children — no sur
prise considering his reserved demeanor.
Finally, when teammate Tim Salmon

handed him the World Series trophy, Ander
son let go, running around the outfield hold
ing it high and waving to the hysterical fans
before disappearing into the Angels' dugout.
Then came an even wilder celebration in
the clubhouse, but Anderson again didn't
take part, instead going to the training room
for treatment.
Odd, considering the team won't play
again until next season.
But that's Anderson.
His bases-clearing double was the fifth
such hit in Series history and the first since
Ferry Pendleton did it for the St. Louis Car
dinals in 1985.
Anderson's franchise-record 88 extra-base
hits were the second-most in the AL this season.
