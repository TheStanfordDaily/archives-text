MOSCOW (Al') — A mysterious
knockout gas killed 116 hostages alter
Russian special forces stormed a Moscow
theater to free them from Chechen ter
rorists, casting a shadow on what was first
seen as a triumphant rescue operation.
More than 150 more hostages were in
critical condition yesterday, the chief
Moscow city doctor said.
The physician in charge of the city's
poison unit said troops did not tell med
ical authorities they had gassed the au
ditorium until the 750 hostages were
brought out, most of them unconscious.
"But we didn't know the character of
the gas," said Yevgeny Luzhnikov, head

of the city health service Department of
Severe Poisoning. The substance was
described as akin to compounds used in
surgical anesthesia.
The gas aliened hearts and lungs,
said Andrei Seltsovsky, the chief city
physician. He said he had no informa
tion when asked about reports that the
compound could cause vomiting that
would choke unconscious victims.
"lu standard situations, the coin
pound does not act as aggressively as i(
turned out to do," Seltsovsky said. "But
it was used on people who were in a spe
cific (extreme) situation for more than
50 hours. All of this naturally made the

situation more difficult." The White
House declined to criticize tlie rescue
operation, making clear the Bush ad
ministration's view that blame lor the
deaths lay vviili the captors.
"The Russian government and the
Russian people are victims of this
tragedy, and the tragedy was caused as a
result of the terrorists who took hostages
and booby-trapped the building and
created dire circumstances," spokesman
Ari Fleischer said yesterday.
The approximately 800 hostages
were taken Wednesday night when an
estimated 50 Chechen rebels stormed
the theater during a popular musical.
