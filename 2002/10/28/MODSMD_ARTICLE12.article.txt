ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Sen. Paul
Wellstone's oldest son has urged former
Vice President Walter Mondale to step
in as his late father's replacement on the
Nov. 5 ballot, Democratic leaders said
yesterday.
Mike Erlandson, chairman of the
state's Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party,
said David Wellstone asked Mondale to
run in his father's place. He and other
surviving family members weren't im
mediately available to comment, the late
senator's campaign staff said.
A group of up to 875 Minnesota De
mocrats will meet Wednesday to officially
choose the substitute candidate for Well
stone, who died Friday in a plane crash.
Erlandson refused to say whether
Mondale would be the nominee, al
though he has said the family's choice
would weigh heavily in the party's deci
sion. He said he believes Mondale will
run if nominated.
If Democrats succeed in drafting

Mondale, it will give them a powerhouse
candidate fora six-day campaign
against Republican Norm Coleman, the
former St. Paul mayor who entered the
race at the urging of President Bush.
The race had been tight between Cole
man and Wellstone and was a top target
of Republicans trying to regain control
of the Senate.
White 1 louse spokesman Ari Fleisch
er yesterday said the administration
would wait until the Democrats formal
ly name a replacement before com
menting on the race. "It's still appropri
ate to let the people of Minnesota
grieve," he said.
State Republican officials have said
they would attempt to cast a Mondale-
Coleman race as a choice between a re
luctant placeholder and someone who is
eager to do the work.
"Walter Mondale is a good man,"
Coleman said yesterday, declining to
comment further on his potential oppo

nent. " There will lie a campaign, but
now is not the time."
Mondale, 74, hasn't returned calls to
reporters or answered the door at his
Minneapolis home.
Those close to Mondale said he isn't
expected to comment publicly on a po
tential candidacy until after Tuesday's
memorial service for Wellstone, his
wife, daughter and three campaign
workers who died in the plane crash.
Relatives of the six passengers and two
pilots visited the northern Minnesota
crash site yesterday.
A reconstruction of the flight showed
everything appeared normal as the pilot
made his approach, Carol Carmody, act
ing c hairwoman of the National Trans
portation Safety Board said yesterday.
She said they still don't know why
about a minute after the last radio con
tact, the aircraft began drifting south,
away from the airport, and slowing
down before it crashed.
