## The
						Stanford Daily SCN's hip-hop shows add diversity to campus scene

Published Since 18V!

Two years ago, the Stanford Concert
Network brought hip-hop artist
Common to campus in the spring
and failed to sell out Memorial Au
ditorium. Since then, the organization has
wondered how to bring hip hop to campus in
an economical way.
The Common concert provoked a very rele
vant question for SCN: How do you satisfy a
large contingent of Stanford listeners whose
tastes differ somewhat from the mainstream?
At a university that values diversity as much as
Stanford does, it is important that the wants of
a minority of students are never overlooked be
cause they don't fit in with mainstream tastes.
The short-term solution seems to be the

holding of concerts at smaller venues,
through avenues like SCN's CoHo series,
which brings smaller, more underground acts
to Stanford. This year, a hip-hop act, esteban,
and a soul / funk vocalist, Sakai, have both
come to the Farm.
SCN's decision to pair the esteban show fea
turing DJ Supa with an open-mic night result
ed in a successful gathering of a broad range of
students. This type of creative planning and
marketing scheme is exactly what SCN needs
to continue to do. Not only was the event well
executed, but it was also well-publicized and
well-marketed. Daily e-mail reminders pro
moted the event, and the atmosphere of the
CoHo made fora great get-together spot for

hip-hop enthusiasts.
We commend SCN's renewed commitment
to diversifying the music brought to campus.
SCN fulfills a vital social and cultural role, and
it is imperative that in its quest to bring quality
musical acts to campus, students with non
mainstream music tastes are not overlooked.
Further, SCN's attempt to rid itself of its cur
rent reputation for primarily inviting rock and
jam bands points to an excellent trend toward
cultural inclusion that is always welcomed 011
Stanford's campus. Through expanding its
services, SCN will improve its relationship with
the Stanford community as a whole.
Because a diverse cross-section of students
supports SCN through special fees, it is impor-

tant that SCN provides a diverse cross-section
of music. SCN is one of many organizations on
campus that lias the ability to bring students to
gether, and its importance to our campus
should not be taken lightly.
That said, we hope SCN can figure out a way
to bring hip hop and other musical styles to
campus on a larger scale than the CoHo series.
While the CoHo series focuses on up-and-com
ing artists and participation from the Stanford
community during the open-mic section of the
show, it is important that more established tal
ent is brought to campus. If SCN can figure out
a way to do so successfully, it will serve as an in
dicator of its continued growth as a valid en
trepreneurial organization on campus.
