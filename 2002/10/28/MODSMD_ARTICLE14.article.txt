# 21 AND STILL CLUELESS
## Falling out of love with learning 
### 
Wanna know my deepest,
darkest secret? I don't love
learning. I have reason to
believe that I never did. Not
that 1 hate it, mind you, but 1 have to say
that acadeniia doesn't really light a fire
under my center of gravity. I have but a
passing interest in advancing the cause of
the human race. 1 think that asking ques
tions without answers is a waste of time. 1
think research sucks dead bunnies
through a straw.
Two types of people come to Stanford.
I'he first kind I like to call the "True
Scholars." For some reason (maybe they
listened to Mozart in utero, or maybe
they were dropped on their heads as
small children) they have a genuine cu
riosity about the world around them. Bi
ology, physics, poetry, political science,

whatever — they actual
ly care about the classes
they're taking, and I
look upon them in awe
and jealousy.
These people have
passion in their lives,
spurred on by the mere
promise of ever more
knowledge. They ask

questions, and then tliey find the answers
to them, by dint of hard work or years of
diligent searching. Society will remember
these brave denizens of untamed knowl
edge for saving the world, or at least mak
ing it more beautiful. (Or for inventing the
ideas and technologies that lay the earth to
waste.)
Then there's me, and those of you out
there like me. I'll call us the "Somewhat
Bright." We Somewhat Blights are a
proud race of future bourgeoisie, plod
ding along in our pursuit of the American
Dream. Someone's got to tend the farm
while the rest of you are off curing cancer,
you know.
We may have written on our college ap
plications how much we love learning, but
I tell you it was lies, all lies. We have ambi
tions, but tliey don't include changing
world history. We look at what's in front of
us, and we deal with it as it comes. To us,
questions should lead to answers that you
can hold in your hand, not years of re
search and theory that only serve to beget
ever more questions.
Our five-year plans include the devel
opment of marketable skills and the im
plementation of those skills for money,
which will then be exchanged for goods

and services. What's that I hear? The
tragic deadening of the intellect, you say?
fhe evils of capitalism, you protest?
800 hoo. I support your cause, but
there are mouths to feed and student
loans to pay (the so-called Golden Hand
cuffs of higher education). Who do you
think funds third-world development
programs or research for HIV/AIDS? No
body's hands are clean here.
Chasing dreams is a difficult trade, and
though we respect you Scholars for your
dedication, we've come to acknowledge
that it's just not for us. We can't stomach
the Ivory Tower or the muddy reality of
activism. We've either realized that we
don't have the brains, or that we don't
have the passion.
That's what kills me every time. I get
into a conversation with a True Scholar,
and sooner or later the conversation drifts
onto their pet subject, and then they get
The Passion. You can see it in their eyes.
They love language, or they love science,
or they love healing people, or they love
social justice; they love something so much
that they would devote their lives to it.
Goodness.
Me, 1 can get pretty juiced about really
good yellow curry tofu, the season pre
miere of Buffy or the broken washer that
does your laundry for free. You gotta take
what you can get.
Sometimes it makes me sad that I don't
have fhe Passion. Life must be so intense
for you Scholars. 1 enviously picture you
working hard and playing hard, living life
to its fullest, gett ing the most out of each
second of each day. Then 1 get tired just
thinking about it. Sheesh, sit still fora
minute. Work a little, take a break for TV,
work some more, get a snack. Life is not a
roller coaster, and it's not a stage, and it's
not a bowl of cherries. Life is just living.
And there is absolutely no shame in living
life quietly.
So I'll go to my classes and hopefully
pick up a couple things along the way. I
do appreciate learning; I'm just not in
love with it. We Somewhat Brights are ca
pable of critical thinking, and we might
even enjoy it from time to time, but we
like to live in the real world. Because
someone has to.

Brighter Than Average. Contact her at

800 hoo. I support your cause, but
there are mouths to feed and student
loans to pay (the so-called Golden Hand
cuffs of higher education). Who do you
think funds third-world development

Chasing dreams is a difficult trade, and
though we respect you Scholars for your
dedication, we've come to acknowledge
that it's just not for us. We can't stomach
the Ivory Tower or the muddy reality of
activism. We've either realized that we
don't have the brains, or that we don't
have the passion.
That's what kills me every time. I get
into a conversation with a True Scholar,
and sooner or later the conversation drifts
onto their pet subject, and then they get
The Passion. You can see it in their eyes.
They love language, or they love science,
or they love healing people, or they love
social justice; they love something so much
that they would devote their lives to it.
Goodness.
Me, 1 can get pretty juiced about really
good yellow curry tofu, the season pre
miere of Buffy or the broken washer that
does your laundry for free. You gotta take
what you can get.
Sometimes it makes me sad that I don't
have fhe Passion. Life must be so intense
for you Scholars. 1 enviously picture you
working hard and playing hard, living life
to its fullest, gett ing the most out of each
second of each day. Then 1 get tired just
thinking about it. Sheesh, sit still fora
minute. Work a little, take a break for TV,
work some more, get a snack. Life is not a
roller coaster, and it's not a stage, and it's
not a bowl of cherries. Life is just living.
And there is absolutely no shame in living
life quietly.
So I'll go to my classes and hopefully
pick up a couple things along the way. I
do appreciate learning; I'm just not in
love with it. We Somewhat Brights are ca
pable of critical thinking, and we might
even enjoy it from time to time, but we
like to live in the real world. Because
someone has to.

Wanna know my deepest,
darkest secret? I don't love
learning. I have reason to
believe that I never did. Not
that 1 hate it, mind you, but 1 have to say
that acadeniia doesn't really light a fire
under my center of gravity. I have but a
passing interest in advancing the cause of
the human race. 1 think that asking ques
tions without answers is a waste of time. 1
think research sucks dead bunnies
through a straw.
Two types of people come to Stanford.
I'he first kind I like to call the "True
Scholars." For some reason (maybe they
listened to Mozart in utero, or maybe
they were dropped on their heads as
small children) they have a genuine cu
riosity about the world around them. Bi
ology, physics, poetry, political science,

whatever — they actual
ly care about the classes
they're taking, and I
look upon them in awe
and jealousy.
These people have
passion in their lives,
spurred on by the mere
promise of ever more
knowledge. They ask

questions, and then tliey find the answers
to them, by dint of hard work or years of
diligent searching. Society will remember
these brave denizens of untamed knowl
edge for saving the world, or at least mak
ing it more beautiful. (Or for inventing the
ideas and technologies that lay the earth to
waste.)
Then there's me, and those of you out
there like me. I'll call us the "Somewhat
Bright." We Somewhat Blights are a
proud race of future bourgeoisie, plod
ding along in our pursuit of the American
Dream. Someone's got to tend the farm
while the rest of you are off curing cancer,
you know.
We may have written on our college ap
plications how much we love learning, but
I tell you it was lies, all lies. We have ambi
tions, but tliey don't include changing
world history. We look at what's in front of
us, and we deal with it as it comes. To us,
questions should lead to answers that you
can hold in your hand, not years of re
search and theory that only serve to beget
ever more questions.
Our five-year plans include the devel
opment of marketable skills and the im
plementation of those skills for money,
which will then be exchanged for goods

and services. What's that I hear? The
tragic deadening of the intellect, you say?
fhe evils of capitalism, you protest?
