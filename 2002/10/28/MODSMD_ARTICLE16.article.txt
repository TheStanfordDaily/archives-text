Methodology behind semen study is
'obviously flowed'
I believe the article entitled, "Study
claims semen a natural 'upper' " (U
-WIRE, Oct. 24) is grounds for questioning
the editorial staffs criteria for publishing
an article.
The research is obviously Hawed. I he
whole study is based on the logical fallacy,
"Women had semen in their bodies.
Women were happy. Women must be
happy because they have semen in their
bodies." That is like saying, "Bob does not
have an arm. Bob is old. Bob must be old
because he does not have an arm."
Perhaps there were confounding fac
tors outside the scope of the study that
contributed to the women's happiness.
Was the article published because any
news about the penis must be good news?
After all, the article is sure to generate inter
est from at least half the student body. Was
the article published for its value as a piece
of humor? This would be the grade-school
variety of humor like when everyone gig
gled when the teacher said the word sex.
The article is not funny. It has offensive
overtones. Suggesting that men's semen
makes women happy implies that men
contribute to women's happiness by copu
lating with them. It implies the superiori
ty of male sexual functions because not
only do they make men feel good, they
make women happy as well. To suggest
that semen will make the world a happier
place is an example of masculine, ego
driven narcissism, not science.

In defense of diversity
I'm writing this letter iu agreement
with Bryan Choi's letter regarding the
lac k of Asian males portrayed in The
Daily's photographic coverage of Full
Moon on the Quad ("Student responds to
'the lack of diversity' in Full Moon pic
tures," Oct. 24). I, too, am sincerely dis
appointed by the pronounced lack of di
versity in those photos. While I applaud
I he Daily's effort to include two photos
representative of the thriving gay com
munity on campus, I find the deliberate
exclusion of the lesbian community from
those photos quite appalling.
Now, I'm not affiliated with the LGBT
CRC, nor would I consider myself an ac
tivist by any means, but I feel that some
thing must be said to address the blatant
anti-lesbian propaganda set forth by that
front-page banner, 112 hope in the future
I he Stanford Daily will recognize its re
sponsibility as the printed voice of this
c ampus and strive to uphold the values of
tolerance and diversity, as well as show us
all some good girl-on-girl ac tion.
When l'( 1 goes too far.

Reading of Baraka requires looking at
entire poem
In recent letters to the editor, Sam
Shapero and Aaron Master refer to the
same stanza from Amiri Haraka's poem

"Somebody Blew Up America" to argue
that the poem is offensive and tantamount
to hate speech. The stanza they identify as
objectionable has been cited in many criti
cisms of the poem: "Who knew the World
Trade Center was gonna get bombed/
Who told 4,000 Israeli workers at the
Twin Towers/To stay home that day /
Why did Sharon stay away?" In Tuesday's
issue. Max Kamenetsky described Baraka
as "spewing filth." All of these criticisms
hinge on the claim that Baraka's poem
(and the poet himself) are anti-Semitic.
Yet in this same poem, Baraka includes
Jews as one of many groups he argues
have been brutally oppressed. Among the
questions Baraka poses in the poem are:
"Who put the Jews in ovens,/and who
helped them do it/Who said 'America
First / and ok'd the yellow stars." And no
tably, he even asks, "Who set the Reich
stag Fire?" Baraka has explained that he
wrote this line to draw attention to how a
staged lire was attributed to Jews in order
to galvanize public support for the Nazis,
but what appears to be generating dis
comfort is the parallel he draws between
the burning of the Reichstag and the
events of Sept. II and their aftermath â€”
particularly in relation to anti-Muslim
and anti-Arab sentiment.
It concerns me that a poet who chal
lenges readers to ask questions has be
come the target of a sustained campaign
of censure, and I applaud him for refus
ing to resign as poet laureate of New Jer
sey. 1 am also very pleased that the Com
mittee on Black Performing Arts brought
him here to speak and talk directly with
