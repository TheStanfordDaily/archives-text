Methodology behind semen study is
'obviously flowed'
I believe the article entitled, "Study
claims semen a natural 'upper' " (U
-WIRE, Oct. 24) is grounds for questioning
the editorial staffs criteria for publishing
an article.
The research is obviously Hawed. I he
whole study is based on the logical fallacy,
"Women had semen in their bodies.
Women were happy. Women must be
happy because they have semen in their
bodies." That is like saying, "Bob does not
have an arm. Bob is old. Bob must be old
because he does not have an arm."
Perhaps there were confounding fac
tors outside the scope of the study that
contributed to the women's happiness.
Was the article published because any
news about the penis must be good news?
After all, the article is sure to generate inter
est from at least half the student body. Was
the article published for its value as a piece
of humor? This would be the grade-school
variety of humor like when everyone gig
gled when the teacher said the word sex.
The article is not funny. It has offensive
overtones. Suggesting that men's semen
makes women happy implies that men
contribute to women's happiness by copu
lating with them. It implies the superiori
ty of male sexual functions because not
only do they make men feel good, they
make women happy as well. To suggest
that semen will make the world a happier
place is an example of masculine, ego
driven narcissism, not science.

In defense of diversity
I'm writing this letter iu agreement
with Bryan Choi's letter regarding the
lac k of Asian males portrayed in The
Daily's photographic coverage of Full
Moon on the Quad ("Student responds to
'the lack of diversity' in Full Moon pic
tures," Oct. 24). I, too, am sincerely dis
appointed by the pronounced lack of di
versity in those photos. While I applaud
I he Daily's effort to include two photos
representative of the thriving gay com
munity on campus, I find the deliberate
exclusion of the lesbian community from
those photos quite appalling.
Now, I'm not affiliated with the LGBT
CRC, nor would I consider myself an ac
tivist by any means, but I feel that some
thing must be said to address the blatant
anti-lesbian propaganda set forth by that
front-page banner, 112 hope in the future
I he Stanford Daily will recognize its re
sponsibility as the printed voice of this
c ampus and strive to uphold the values of
tolerance and diversity, as well as show us
all some good girl-on-girl ac tion.

Reading of Baraka requires looking at
entire poem
In recent letters to the editor, Sam
Shapero and Aaron Master refer to the
same stanza from Amiri Haraka's poem

"Somebody Blew Up America" to argue
that the poem is offensive and tantamount
to hate speech. The stanza they identify as
objectionable has been cited in many criti
cisms of the poem: "Who knew the World
Trade Center was gonna get bombed/
Who told 4,000 Israeli workers at the
Twin Towers/To stay home that day /
Why did Sharon stay away?" In Tuesday's
issue. Max Kamenetsky described Baraka
as "spewing filth." All of these criticisms
hinge on the claim that Baraka's poem
(and the poet himself) are anti-Semitic.
Yet in this same poem, Baraka includes
Jews as one of many groups he argues
have been brutally oppressed. Among the
questions Baraka poses in the poem are:
"Who put the Jews in ovens,/and who
helped them do it/Who said 'America
First / and ok'd the yellow stars." And no
tably, he even asks, "Who set the Reich
stag Fire?" Baraka has explained that he
wrote this line to draw attention to how a
staged lire was attributed to Jews in order
to galvanize public support for the Nazis,
but what appears to be generating dis
comfort is the parallel he draws between
the burning of the Reichstag and the
events of Sept. II and their aftermath —
particularly in relation to anti-Muslim
and anti-Arab sentiment.
It concerns me that a poet who chal
lenges readers to ask questions has be
come the target of a sustained campaign
of censure, and I applaud him for refus
ing to resign as poet laureate of New Jer
sey. 1 am also very pleased that the Com
mittee on Black Performing Arts brought
him here to speak and talk directly with
members of the Stanford community.
I here is certainly ample room to engage
and c ritique "Somebody Blew Up .Ameri
ca," but the blanket condemnation of it as
anti-Semitic fails to address the lines cited
above and runs the risk of conflating Jews
with the state of Israel, a gesture which be
littles the vibrant diversity of thought and
opinion within Jewish communities here
and elsewhere.
Based on Baraka's unrelenting at
tacks on white supremacism, I would
think that the KKIs. would be among the
groups most offended by his work. The
poem "Jungle Jim fails I lis Screen Test,"
which Baraka also read during his visit to
Stanford, includes the line: "You ugly as
devil doo doo, white supremacy and you
/ Is identical." 1 nt he same poem, he also
writes, "You uglier than Papa Doc,
Hitler and Mobutu." I lie caption Bara
ka wrote to accompany the collage piece
entitled "Betrayal" by Theodore Harris,

a piece which depicts a black woman
picking cotton underneath a floating
"Last Supper" scene, reads: "Christ
never went to Europe."
Perhaps a more constructive conversa
tion could be pursued in the format Bara
ka suggested. He invited those who have
called his poem anti-Semitic to join him in
a debate on a national television program.
I, for one, would be very interested to hear
such a conversation.

Senators should exercise responsibility
I he Undergraduate Senate offered a
"defense" against my accusation that the
bulk of its members had improperly re
fused to allow a Constitutional Council
hearing ("Decision to sign petition 'was an
individual one,' "Oct. 24). I put defense in
quotes, since they didn't even try to refute
anything I said.
The Senate claims that each senator has
a distinct reason for signing or not signing
the petition. I his may be true, but it's hard

(o confirm since most senators failed to
give a reason when asked.
Last spring, ASSU policy was that pe
titions would he signed unless they were
absolutely frivolous (something none of
the senators have suggested about
ours). Thai policy was horn out of both
ethical considerations —review by an
independent judicial body is a corner
stone of constitutional democracy —
and practical ones — adding unneces
sary roadblocks to the process probably
won't block cases, but will make it look
like the ASSU is trying to avoid follow
ing its constitution.
This fall, the senators threw that poli
ty out, without discussion or logic. They
replaced it with the "whatever you feel
like" policy, under which senators have
no higher obligations than their mood
that day.
They justify this on the grounds that
they are not legally compelled to sign the
petition, as if a lack of rules is an excuse for
poor judgment.
I here are also no rules compelling the
Senate to fund groups objectively. Does
the Senate plan to only fund groups that
pay kickbacks? There's no rule against

that either.
The senators give only the excuse that,
in a system ofchecks and balances, the sys
tem doesn't break even if a few officials are
corrupt. So they have no problem with
improperly rejecting our petition, since
there were other ways to get it to the Con
stitutional Council. And presumably
there's nothing wrong with improperly
funding groups in exchange for kick
backs, since the ASSU president could
veto the bill.
The presence of checks and balances is
a protection, but it doesn't mean ASSU of
ficials should be allowed to hide from the
consequences of their actions when others
cover for them.
While some of the senators have
thought through this issue and reached
intelligent and careful decisions, many
have not. Most frightening is the Senate's
chair, Bo Cowgill, who not only violated
the standing policy despite a clear conflict
of interest, but in a recent e-mail to the
Senate offered this justification: "Having a
hearing before the Constitutional Council
is not the guaranteed right of every Asso
ciation member."
Insert those words into the mouth of

your favorite bogeyman, be it Attorney
General John Ashcroft 01 someone else.
We're still going to have elections tliis
spring, right?

Senators should exercise responsibility
I he Undergraduate Senate offered a
"defense" against my accusation that the
bulk of its members had improperly re
fused to allow a Constitutional Council
hearing ("Decision to sign petition 'was an

quotes, since they didn't even try to refute
anything I said.
The Senate claims that each senator has
a distinct reason for signing or not signing
the petition. I his may be true, but it's hard

(o confirm since most senators failed to
give a reason when asked.
Last spring, ASSU policy was that pe
titions would he signed unless they were
absolutely frivolous (something none of
the senators have suggested about
ours). Thai policy was horn out of both
ethical considerations —review by an
independent judicial body is a corner
stone of constitutional democracy —
and practical ones — adding unneces
sary roadblocks to the process probably
won't block cases, but will make it look
like the ASSU is trying to avoid follow
ing its constitution.
This fall, the senators threw that poli
ty out, without discussion or logic. They
replaced it with the "whatever you feel
like" policy, under which senators have
no higher obligations than their mood
that day.
They justify this on the grounds that
they are not legally compelled to sign the
petition, as if a lack of rules is an excuse for
poor judgment.
I here are also no rules compelling the
Senate to fund groups objectively. Does
the Senate plan to only fund groups that
pay kickbacks? There's no rule against

that either.
The senators give only the excuse that,
in a system ofchecks and balances, the sys
tem doesn't break even if a few officials are
corrupt. So they have no problem with
improperly rejecting our petition, since
there were other ways to get it to the Con
stitutional Council. And presumably
there's nothing wrong with improperly
funding groups in exchange for kick
backs, since the ASSU president could
veto the bill.
The presence of checks and balances is
a protection, but it doesn't mean ASSU of

consequences of their actions when others
cover for them.
While some of the senators have
thought through this issue and reached
intelligent and careful decisions, many
have not. Most frightening is the Senate's
chair, Bo Cowgill, who not only violated
the standing policy despite a clear conflict
of interest, but in a recent e-mail to the

Methodology behind semen study is

I believe the article entitled, "Study

the editorial staffs criteria for publishing
an article.
The research is obviously Hawed. I he
whole study is based on the logical fallacy,
"Women had semen in their bodies.
Women were happy. Women must be
happy because they have semen in their
bodies." That is like saying, "Bob does not
have an arm. Bob is old. Bob must be old
because he does not have an arm."
Perhaps there were confounding fac

Was the article published because any

After all, the article is sure to generate inter

the article published for its value as a piece
of humor? This would be the grade-school
variety of humor like when everyone gig
gled when the teacher said the word sex.
The article is not funny. It has offensive
overtones. Suggesting that men's semen
makes women happy implies that men
contribute to women's happiness by copu
lating with them. It implies the superiori
ty of male sexual functions because not
only do they make men feel good, they
make women happy as well. To suggest
that semen will make the world a happier
place is an example of masculine, ego

Reading of Baraka requires looking at
entire poem
In recent letters to the editor, Sam
Shapero and Aaron Master refer to the
same stanza from Amiri Haraka's poem

"Somebody Blew Up America" to argue
that the poem is offensive and tantamount
to hate speech. The stanza they identify as
objectionable has been cited in many criti
cisms of the poem: "Who knew the World
Trade Center was gonna get bombed/
Who told 4,000 Israeli workers at the
Twin Towers/To stay home that day /
Why did Sharon stay away?" In Tuesday's
issue. Max Kamenetsky described Baraka
as "spewing filth." All of these criticisms
hinge on the claim that Baraka's poem
(and the poet himself) are anti-Semitic.
Yet in this same poem, Baraka includes
Jews as one of many groups he argues
have been brutally oppressed. Among the
questions Baraka poses in the poem are:
"Who put the Jews in ovens,/and who
helped them do it/Who said 'America
First / and ok'd the yellow stars." And no
tably, he even asks, "Who set the Reich
stag Fire?" Baraka has explained that he
wrote this line to draw attention to how a
staged lire was attributed to Jews in order
to galvanize public support for the Nazis,
but what appears to be generating dis
comfort is the parallel he draws between
the burning of the Reichstag and the
events of Sept. II and their aftermath —
particularly in relation to anti-Muslim
and anti-Arab sentiment.
It concerns me that a poet who chal
lenges readers to ask questions has be
come the target of a sustained campaign
of censure, and I applaud him for refus
ing to resign as poet laureate of New Jer
sey. 1 am also very pleased that the Com
mittee on Black Performing Arts brought
him here to speak and talk directly with
members of the Stanford community.
I here is certainly ample room to engage
and c ritique "Somebody Blew Up .Ameri
ca," but the blanket condemnation of it as
anti-Semitic fails to address the lines cited
above and runs the risk of conflating Jews
with the state of Israel, a gesture which be
littles the vibrant diversity of thought and
opinion within Jewish communities here
and elsewhere.
Based on Baraka's unrelenting at
tacks on white supremacism, I would
think that the KKIs. would be among the
groups most offended by his work. The
poem "Jungle Jim fails I lis Screen Test,"
which Baraka also read during his visit to

the article published for its value as a piece
of humor? This would be the grade-school
variety of humor like when everyone gig
gled when the teacher said the word sex.
The article is not funny. It has offensive
overtones. Suggesting that men's semen
makes women happy implies that men
contribute to women's happiness by copu
lating with them. It implies the superiori
ty of male sexual functions because not
only do they make men feel good, they
make women happy as well. To suggest
that semen will make the world a happier
place is an example of masculine, ego
driven narcissism, not science.

In defense of diversity
I'm writing this letter iu agreement
with Bryan Choi's letter regarding the
lac k of Asian males portrayed in The
Daily's photographic coverage of Full
Moon on the Quad ("Student responds to
'the lack of diversity' in Full Moon pic
tures," Oct. 24). I, too, am sincerely dis
appointed by the pronounced lack of di
versity in those photos. While I applaud
I he Daily's effort to include two photos
representative of the thriving gay com
munity on campus, I find the deliberate
exclusion of the lesbian community from
those photos quite appalling.
Now, I'm not affiliated with the LGBT
CRC, nor would I consider myself an ac
tivist by any means, but I feel that some
thing must be said to address the blatant
anti-lesbian propaganda set forth by that
front-page banner, 112 hope in the future
I he Stanford Daily will recognize its re
sponsibility as the printed voice of this
c ampus and strive to uphold the values of
tolerance and diversity, as well as show us
all some good girl-on-girl ac tion.
When l'( 1 goes too far.

Reading of Baraka requires looking at
entire poem
In recent letters to the editor, Sam
Shapero and Aaron Master refer to the
same stanza from Amiri Haraka's poem

"Somebody Blew Up America" to argue
that the poem is offensive and tantamount
to hate speech. The stanza they identify as
objectionable has been cited in many criti
cisms of the poem: "Who knew the World
Trade Center was gonna get bombed/
Who told 4,000 Israeli workers at the
Twin Towers/To stay home that day /
Why did Sharon stay away?" In Tuesday's
issue. Max Kamenetsky described Baraka
as "spewing filth." All of these criticisms
hinge on the claim that Baraka's poem
(and the poet himself) are anti-Semitic.
Yet in this same poem, Baraka includes
Jews as one of many groups he argues
have been brutally oppressed. Among the
questions Baraka poses in the poem are:
"Who put the Jews in ovens,/and who
helped them do it/Who said 'America
First / and ok'd the yellow stars." And no
tably, he even asks, "Who set the Reich
stag Fire?" Baraka has explained that he
wrote this line to draw attention to how a
staged lire was attributed to Jews in order
to galvanize public support for the Nazis,
but what appears to be generating dis
comfort is the parallel he draws between
the burning of the Reichstag and the
events of Sept. II and their aftermath —
particularly in relation to anti-Muslim
and anti-Arab sentiment.
It concerns me that a poet who chal
lenges readers to ask questions has be
come the target of a sustained campaign
of censure, and I applaud him for refus
ing to resign as poet laureate of New Jer
sey. 1 am also very pleased that the Com
mittee on Black Performing Arts brought
him here to speak and talk directly with
members of the Stanford community.
I here is certainly ample room to engage
and c ritique "Somebody Blew Up .Ameri
ca," but the blanket condemnation of it as
anti-Semitic fails to address the lines cited
above and runs the risk of conflating Jews
with the state of Israel, a gesture which be
littles the vibrant diversity of thought and
opinion within Jewish communities here
and elsewhere.
Based on Baraka's unrelenting at
tacks on white supremacism, I would
think that the KKIs. would be among the
groups most offended by his work. The
poem "Jungle Jim fails I lis Screen Test,"
which Baraka also read during his visit to
Stanford, includes the line: "You ugly as
devil doo doo, white supremacy and you
/ Is identical." 1 nt he same poem, he also
writes, "You uglier than Papa Doc,
Hitler and Mobutu." I lie caption Bara
ka wrote to accompany the collage piece
entitled "Betrayal" by Theodore Harris,

a piece which depicts a black woman
picking cotton underneath a floating
"Last Supper" scene, reads: "Christ
never went to Europe."
Perhaps a more constructive conversa
tion could be pursued in the format Bara
ka suggested. He invited those who have
called his poem anti-Semitic to join him in
a debate on a national television program.
I, for one, would be very interested to hear
such a conversation.

Senators should exercise responsibility
I he Undergraduate Senate offered a
"defense" against my accusation that the
bulk of its members had improperly re
fused to allow a Constitutional Council
hearing ("Decision to sign petition 'was an
individual one,' "Oct. 24). I put defense in
quotes, since they didn't even try to refute
anything I said.
The Senate claims that each senator has
a distinct reason for signing or not signing
the petition. I his may be true, but it's hard

(o confirm since most senators failed to
give a reason when asked.
Last spring, ASSU policy was that pe
titions would he signed unless they were
absolutely frivolous (something none of
the senators have suggested about
ours). Thai policy was horn out of both
ethical considerations —review by an
independent judicial body is a corner
stone of constitutional democracy —
and practical ones — adding unneces
sary roadblocks to the process probably
won't block cases, but will make it look
like the ASSU is trying to avoid follow
ing its constitution.
This fall, the senators threw that poli
ty out, without discussion or logic. They
replaced it with the "whatever you feel
like" policy, under which senators have
no higher obligations than their mood
that day.
They justify this on the grounds that
they are not legally compelled to sign the
petition, as if a lack of rules is an excuse for
poor judgment.
I here are also no rules compelling the
Senate to fund groups objectively. Does
the Senate plan to only fund groups that
pay kickbacks? There's no rule against

that either.
The senators give only the excuse that,
in a system ofchecks and balances, the sys
tem doesn't break even if a few officials are
corrupt. So they have no problem with
improperly rejecting our petition, since
there were other ways to get it to the Con
stitutional Council. And presumably
there's nothing wrong with improperly
funding groups in exchange for kick
backs, since the ASSU president could
veto the bill.
The presence of checks and balances is
a protection, but it doesn't mean ASSU of
ficials should be allowed to hide from the
consequences of their actions when others
cover for them.
While some of the senators have
thought through this issue and reached
intelligent and careful decisions, many
have not. Most frightening is the Senate's
chair, Bo Cowgill, who not only violated
the standing policy despite a clear conflict
of interest, but in a recent e-mail to the
Senate offered this justification: "Having a
hearing before the Constitutional Council
is not the guaranteed right of every Asso
ciation member."
Insert those words into the mouth of

your favorite bogeyman, be it Attorney
General John Ashcroft 01 someone else.
We're still going to have elections tliis
spring, right?
