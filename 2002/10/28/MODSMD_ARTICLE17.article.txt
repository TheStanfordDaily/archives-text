# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Former intern remembers Minn. Senator Paul Wellstone 
### ALEX BRADFORD GUEST COLUMNIST 
A charismatic leader ol Democratic lil>-
eralism — and a loved friend of integrity,
zeal and courage—Minnesota Senator
Paul Wellstone was killed in ,i tragic plane
crash last Friday, sending a shock wave
through Minnesota and the United States.
II Wellstone's death wasn't tragic enough,
his wile and daughter were also killed in
the crash, making this disaster all the more
horrific.
Having worked in his lollice lliis
summer, I knew Wellstone and his family
like they were my own. They were the
nicest folks you could imagine. Wellstone
and his wife, Sheila, even came out to Stan
ford several times throughout their years
to give talks and entourage liberalism on

campus, and they praised Stanford lor its
cultivation of progressive thinkers.
Representing everything that is hon
orable in public service, Wellstone was a
man ol principled conviction, never giv
ing in to the political incentives that con
trol many of his former colleagues. As
Rev. Jesse Jackson described Wellstone,
he was"the voice of conscious in the U.S.
Senate and the catalyst of die coalition of
hope."
I heonly senator lacing a tight election
to vote against the resolution authorizing
President Bush to t.ike unilateral action
against Iraq, Wellstone frequently fount!
himself on the short end of 99-1 votes.
Wellstone was in the heat of the c los
est Senate race in the country, and with
the Democrats holding just a 50-49 edge,
his death could have profound implica

tions on the Democrat-Republican bal
ance in the Senate.
If Norm Coleman, Wellstone's oppo
nent, wins ihe Nov. 5 election, the
Democrats would immediately lose their
one-vote margin, since Minnesota law
specifies that when a Senate office he
comes vacant or is filled by a temporary
appointee, the winner of the next regu
lar election "shall also succeed to the ol
lice for the remainder of the unexpired
term."
Leaders of the Minnesota Democratic
Party are in the process of finding someone
to replace Wellstone for the upcoming
election, which is just days away.
Democrats see Walter F. Mondale, former
U.S. vice president and a Minnesota native,
to enter the race as Minnesota's best hope
for salvaging Wellstone's seat.

When he first campaigned for the Sen
ate in 1990, Wellstone didn't have much
money. 1 le was an outspoken politic al sci
ence professor at Carleton College and
could no longer restrain himself from
leaving his academic post for the Senate
lloor.
Because his opponent's budget was live
times the size of his own, Wellstone had to
be creative with his campaign. 1 le had one
of his students produce a TV ad, which
was played at an extra-fast speed so that
Wellstone could say as much as possible.
Campaigning in an old, green, rickety
school bus, Wellstone inspired Min
nesotans with his fervent and principled
convictions, and he won the election.
I remember meeting Wellstone at the
Minnesota State Fair when I was eight
years old. Amid the cows, pigs, tractors

and cheese curds, his liberalism seemed
out of place, but Minnesotans were fed up
with career politicians and found relief in
his non-traditional, true-spirited cam
paigning style. He was everyone's best
friend, not because he wanted votes, but
because he genuinely liked and cared for
all kinds of people.
Wellstone has been a role model for
me, and I'm sure that if you could have
known him, you'd feel the same way. Well
stone's death is a loss for the United States,
for Minnesota and for me. But at the same
time, his death inspires me to carry on the
ideals, passion and sincerity that charac
terized a man we should all thank.
