## War with UCLA just beginning for Card Two Hart High School alums duel in Pac-10 battle 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN STAFF WRITER 
On Saturday, the Cardinal lost
to UCLA 28-18.
But the battle that waged was
truly just a precursor of wars to
come.
Both Stanford (2-5, 1-3 Pacific
-10 Conference) and UCLA (5-3,2-
2) put a young team on the field on
Saturday, resting their hopes on
freshman shoulders. While the
Bruins may have won this year's
confrontation at the Rose Bowl, it
is evident that this war will be close
for the next three years.
The youth insurrection began

at the quarterback position. For
the Cardinal, redshirt freshman
Kyle Matter started only his sec
ond game of the season. With ju
nior starter Chris Lewis out with
an injury, Matter stepped in and
took control of the offense. Matter
played well despite being hurried
most of the game.
"They did a good job of press
ing up on our receivers," Matter
said. "They did a great job of tak
ing [sophomore tight end] Alex
Smith away. We expected they
would do that, but we didn't think
they would do it so well."
Despite mediocre numbers,
Matter played as a team leader,
taking hits and scrambling for
yards.
"I thought he played smart loot
ball," coach Buddy Teevens said.

Redshirt freshman kicker Michael Sgroi scrambles fora two-point conversion
on a botched snap during the first half of Saturday's loss to UCLA. The Car
dinal lost 28-18 at the Rose Bowl behind quarterback Kyle Matter.
"I le was harassed most of the after
noon, but he scrambled and picked
up some hey first downs for us. I
thought he played really heady
football. I was pleased overall."
The Bruins sent out freshman
Matt Moore, who had been plan
ning on using his redshirt for the
season before two UCLA quarter
backs went down with injuries.
Moore was Matter's back-up at
Hart High School, as the former
teammates went head to head on
Saturday.
"It was a little bit strange," Mat
ter said. "It is tough because he is
my good friend, but he is the
enemy. It was strange seeing him
in a different color jersey because
we were always playing on the
same team. Ii was a strange feeling.
I am happy that he did well, but it's
just unfortunate that we couldn't
come away with a win."
Moore had a decent outing,
ending the game with 142 yards
and a touchdown.

"[Moore] made some nice deci
sions and threw the ball well,"
Teevens said.
"I was amazed. [Moore] plays
like a veteran," Stanford defensive
end Matt Leonard said. "1 didn't
see any freshman in him at all. Of
course, I didn't get to him very
many times. 1 thought he did a
tremendous job, and he will prob
ably be a huge asset for them in the
future."
While "Moore vs. Matter" used
to take place on the Hart High
practice field, in the future it will
occur on Saturdays.
The primary driving force for
the Bruins offense was freshman
running back Tyler Ebell. Ebell
rushed for 1 (50 yards on 39 carries,
becoming the first Bruin back
since 1997 to run for 100 yards in
four straight games.
"With more carries, I feel that I
become a better runner," Ebell
said. "It reminded me of high
school. The quarterback situation
doesn't matter. Whoever's in there
w ill do a good job."
In the fourth quarter, UCLA
drove down the field trailing I<S
-16. With the Bruins on the Stan

ford Hi, UCIA handed the ball off
Kbell, who ran up the middle,
bounced off a tackle and sprinted
into the corner of the end zone to
give the Bruins the lead for the
first time. Behind Ebell's solid run
ning the Bruins kept the Cardinal
on it's heels.
1 lowever.on defense the Cardi
nal also saw solid play out of its
freshmen. True freshman Julian
Jenkins started the game at defen
sive end and soon made the most
out of the opportunity. On the
Bruins' first offensive possession,
they were looking at a second-and
-23 on their own 17 yard line. The
snap was fumbled, and Jenkins
picked up the ball and ran into the
end zone to give the (Cardinal a 15-
0 lead.
"I was running on the ball, and
1 had 'easy force,' which is outside
contain, and the ball just hap
pened to roll my way," Jenkins
said. "I scooped and scored. That's
my job, and that's what I did."
Jenkins played well all around,
finishing the game with three tack
les. Freshman T.J. Rushing also
started on defense, playing corner
back for the Cardinal.
