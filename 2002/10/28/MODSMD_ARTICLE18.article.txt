## War with UCLA just beginning for Card Two Hart High School alums duel in Pac-10 battle 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN STAFF WRITER 
On Saturday, the Cardinal lost
to UCLA 28-18.
But the battle that waged was
truly just a precursor of wars to
come.
Both Stanford (2-5, 1-3 Pacific
-10 Conference) and UCLA (5-3,2-
2) put a young team on the field on
Saturday, resting their hopes on
freshman shoulders. While the
Bruins may have won this year's
confrontation at the Rose Bowl, it
is evident that this war will be close
for the next three years.
The youth insurrection began

at the quarterback position. For
the Cardinal, redshirt freshman
Kyle Matter started only his sec
ond game of the season. With ju
nior starter Chris Lewis out with
an injury, Matter stepped in and
took control of the offense. Matter
played well despite being hurried
most of the game.
"They did a good job of press
ing up on our receivers," Matter
said. "They did a great job of tak
ing [sophomore tight end] Alex
Smith away. We expected they
would do that, but we didn't think
they would do it so well."
Despite mediocre numbers,
Matter played as a team leader,
taking hits and scrambling for
yards.
"I thought he played smart loot
ball," coach Buddy Teevens said.
