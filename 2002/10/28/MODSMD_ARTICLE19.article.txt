The Cardinal had struggled in its last two events be
fore the Nelson, finishing 11th at the Club Glove Inter
collegiate three weeks ago and tying for lbth at theAlis
ter Mackenzie Invitational two weeks ago. After a third
place showing at the Windon Memorial at the begin
ning of the month to start the season, the squad had late
ly been unable to get strong play fiom all five members
of the team in the same weekend.
Playing on its home course at the Nelson, the Cardi
nal had an excellent opportunity to break its streak of
poor showings, but the team was not able to capitalize,
finishing tied for seventh in the 18-team field.
Duke won the tournament with an 11-under 841,
putt ing it ahead of second-place Washington by a com
manding seven-stroke margin. Ihe Cardinal finished
21 strokes back of the Blue Devils with a 10-over 862.
I he team has played well at the Stanford Golf course,
and has had success at this event in the past, turning in
a second-place finish a year ago.
The early results were encouraging for the (Cardinal.
In its previous two events, poor play in the opening
rounds placed the team in a hole that virtually eliminat
ed any chance fora solid finish.
On Friday, Stanford shot a 1-over-par 285 in its
opening round to land in a tie with Notre Dame for fifth
place overall.

As has been the case virtually the entire year, the Car
dinal was led by the play of two seniors, Jim Seki and
Ron Won. Seki is currently ranked No. 7 in the nation
by Golf week, and Won has been the model of consis
tency, posting three top-15 finishes in as many events.
Won took the early lead for the Cardinal. His open
ing-round 08 put him in sixth place overall, tied with
Mike Castleforte of Duke and Brett Tobyne of Colorado
Stale.
Seki opened with a round of 70, tying him for 12th
place with a host of other players. Just three shots be
hind Seki was his sophomore teammate, Kevin Blue.
Senior Delde Windt carded a 74, one shot back of Blue.
Sophomore Pat Phillips rounded out the Cardinal's
first-round scoring with a 70.

"It was important to go out and
build confidence," Mitchell said. "At

think it will help us turn the corner."
On Saturday, the Cardinal's re

reared once again.
The seniors continued to play
well, with Seki's second consecutive
70 pulling him into a tie for ninth
place and VVon's second-round 71
moving him up to fifth place.
The rest of the team, however,
was unable to duplicate their team
mates' success. De Windt's 75
dropped him into a tie for 50th
place while Phillips, who carded a
77 on the day, slipped back to 78th

place overall.
As a team, the Cardinal put to
gether a round of 293, falling into a
tie for seventh place with Toledo.
Going into the final day, the Car
dinal still had an opportunity to cap
ture its second top-five 112 inish of the
year. At the time of yesterday's shot
gun start, Stanford sat just three
strokes behind fifth-place Kansas.
However, the Cardinal was un
able to muster the performances it
needed to move up in the standings.
Seki and Won continued their
solid play though. Seki stormed to
his third top-10 112 inish of the season
with a 68 in the final round, giving
him a 5-under-par total of2oB and a
sixth-place finish.
Won faded slightly yesterday,
shooting a 2-over-par 73 but still
managed to finish at 1 under par,
snagging his fourth consecutive top
-15 finish of the season.
De Windt fired a final-round 70
to finish in a tie for 35th place.
Phillips rounded out the scoring
with a 73 and tied for 68th.

proud in the individual competi

Although the Cardinal's sev
enth-place finish was an improve

Seki felt that the team did not live
lip to its potential. "
"1 honestly thought that we did
nothing well at all," Seki said. "Our

"We are presented with a situa

hitting rock bottom," Seki said. "We
are on our way to hitting rock bot

some specific tilings during the up
