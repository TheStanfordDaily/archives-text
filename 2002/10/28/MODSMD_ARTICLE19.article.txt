The Cardinal had struggled in its last two events be
fore the Nelson, finishing 11th at the Club Glove Inter
collegiate three weeks ago and tying for lbth at theAlis
ter Mackenzie Invitational two weeks ago. After a third
place showing at the Windon Memorial at the begin
ning of the month to start the season, the squad had late
ly been unable to get strong play fiom all five members
of the team in the same weekend.
Playing on its home course at the Nelson, the Cardi
nal had an excellent opportunity to break its streak of
poor showings, but the team was not able to capitalize,
finishing tied for seventh in the 18-team field.
Duke won the tournament with an 11-under 841,
putt ing it ahead of second-place Washington by a com
manding seven-stroke margin. Ihe Cardinal finished
21 strokes back of the Blue Devils with a 10-over 862.
I he team has played well at the Stanford Golf course,
and has had success at this event in the past, turning in
a second-place finish a year ago.
The early results were encouraging for the (Cardinal.
In its previous two events, poor play in the opening
rounds placed the team in a hole that virtually eliminat
ed any chance fora solid finish.
On Friday, Stanford shot a 1-over-par 285 in its
opening round to land in a tie with Notre Dame for fifth
place overall.

As has been the case virtually the entire year, the Car
dinal was led by the play of two seniors, Jim Seki and
Ron Won. Seki is currently ranked No. 7 in the nation
by Golf week, and Won has been the model of consis
tency, posting three top-15 finishes in as many events.
Won took the early lead for the Cardinal. His open
ing-round 08 put him in sixth place overall, tied with
Mike Castleforte of Duke and Brett Tobyne of Colorado
Stale.
Seki opened with a round of 70, tying him for 12th
place with a host of other players. Just three shots be
hind Seki was his sophomore teammate, Kevin Blue.
Senior Delde Windt carded a 74, one shot back of Blue.
Sophomore Pat Phillips rounded out the Cardinal's
first-round scoring with a 70.
