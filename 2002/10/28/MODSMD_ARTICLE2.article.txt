# Dry campus?
## With OSA cracking down on alcohol use, students complain that Stanford feels dry... 
### NATALIE FARRELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the Sigma Chi, Kappa
Sigma and Theta Delta Chi frater
nities, as well as the Stanford
Band, all currently on alcohol pro
bation, Stanford students are be
ginning to feel the effects ofa more
stringent enforcement of the Uni
versity's alcohol policy.
"We're holding people more
accountable lately because the risk
is so high," Associate Dean of Stu
dents Marcus Graves said. "12 to
15 deaths are occurring every year
from alcohol related deaths on col
lege campuses."
Graves, however, did not say
that stronger enforcement meant
University officials would be prob
ing around parties trying to catch
students breaking the rules.
"We don't go out looking for
violators," he said. "We only act
off complaints that we receive
from students, staff, faculty or the
police department."
Despite the high number of or
ganizations on alcohol probation,
the actual number of registered
parties this quarter has exceeded
the number for fall quarter of last
year. According to Assistant Direc
tor of Student Activities Joey
Greenwall, there have been 100
parties registered this fall as op
posed to 86 last year.
Because three fraternities are
on alcohol probation, residences
and student groups have been
holding more parties this year.

The number of parties registered
by Greek organizations fell from
24 last fall to 20 this fall, while resi
dence parties climbed from 47 to
58, and the number of parties reg
istered by student groups climbed
from 15 to 22.
Being put on alcohol proba
tion is not the only penalty that
can be imposed on groups that vi
olate the alcohol policy. Offend
ing organizations must also do
extra community service, host
workshops for other groups on
safe partying, throw dry parties,
and, in the most extreme case, a
fraternity or sorority can even
lose its house.
"With the new Vice Provost
[for Student Affairs Gene Awaku
ni], things have changed," said
Peter de Pentheny O'Kelly, the
president of the Sigma Alpha Ep
silon fraternity, one of the three
housed fraternities not on alco
hol probation.
"The risks involved in throwing
a big open party are still the same
as before, but consequences are
much worse, and that puts us into
a position where we might not
want to throw big, open parties,"
he continued.
Nate Ferhoff, the president of
the Kappa Alpha fraternity,
echoed similar reservations about
hosting big parties.
"We would love to provide the
service of big, open parties to the
community, but things like under

age drinking are becomingjust too
much of a liability for us," he said.
Chris Diedrich, the resident as
sistant in Theta Delt agreed.
"If we're going to get in trouble,
or get sued, or lose our house,
there's much less of an incentive to
throw big parties," he said.
Graves said that it was not the
size of the parties that has been
the problem, but rather the fact
that the parties have not been
properly conducted. He said
that party organizers need to
check IDs and issue wristbands,
tell minors that they cannot
bring in alcohol, and make sure
not to admit anyone who was ob
viously intoxicated.
Diedrich said that a meeting
was held at the beginning of this
year where those in attendance
were warned about a more strin
gent enforcement of the alcohol
policy.
"People don't get drunk at frat

parties; you wait fora half-hour for
a half-cup of foamy beer. They
come because they want to dance,"
Diedrich said.
Graves and Greenwall both
said that the fact that students
might not get drunk solely off of
the alcohol provided at fraternity
parties does not exempt the fra
ternities from liability in the
event of an incident.
"Fraternities do some of the
best party planning on campus,"
Greenwall said. "Unfortunately,
it's easy for things to go wrong.
They have to be able to show that
l hey did everything possible to
protect the health and safety of
their guests."
Many students, particularly
freshmen, said that the falloff in
traditional fraternity parties is
detrimental to the campus social
scene.
" The lack of frat pat ties forces
everyone to have parties in the
dorm, and it inhibits the mixing of
the classes more," said freshman
Melinda Groom.
One freshman said that the fact
that so many groups are on alcohol

probation has given him a negative
impression of the Stanford Greek
scene in general.
"I really expected to go to fiat
parties once a week, but that hasn't
been the case because they are all
on probation," said freshman
Brian Swanson. "ft turns me off to
that whole scene and makes me
think that I might not want to join
a fraternity because they are al
ways on probation, which isn't as
much fun."
While there is a formal struc
ture involved with the investiga
tion and punishment of Greek or
ganizations, no such process is in
place for residences that might vio
late University alcohol policy.
"We don't have the staff to do it
in the Office of Student Activities,"
Graves said.
Residential Education officials
are currently responsible for in
vestigating residence parties.
Graves said Res Ed officials are
examining the use of peer review
group evaluations for the resi
dences the same way in which the
evaluations are used by the Office
of Student Activities for Greek or

ganizations.
Graves said that the Universi
ty's stricter enforcement of the al
cohol policy, particularly as it re
lates to underage drinking, is a
national trend. This is largely due
to the number of students who
die every year from alcohol-relat
ed incidents.
"As I understand it, [Stanford
hasn't] had an alcohol related
death since 1985, and if we have
one, and it's just a matter of time
unless we curtail some of this stuff,
the University is going to he forced
to come clown much more severe
ly," he said.
Graves referred to an incident
earlier in the fall where a student
was rushed to the hospital and
ended up on a respirator.
"Right now, no one really goes
out to the frosh dorms and
checks out drinking," Graves
said. "If we were to have an alco
hol related death, 1 would sus
pect that we would ban all alco
hol from the freshman dorms.
The RFs and the RAs would be
held accountable for making
sure there was no alcohol."
