# Dry campus?
## With OSA cracking down on alcohol use, students complain that Stanford feels dry... 
### NATALIE FARRELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the Sigma Chi, Kappa
Sigma and Theta Delta Chi frater
nities, as well as the Stanford
Band, all currently on alcohol pro
bation, Stanford students are be
ginning to feel the effects ofa more
stringent enforcement of the Uni
versity's alcohol policy.
"We're holding people more
accountable lately because the risk
is so high," Associate Dean of Stu
dents Marcus Graves said. "12 to
15 deaths are occurring every year
from alcohol related deaths on col
lege campuses."
Graves, however, did not say
that stronger enforcement meant
University officials would be prob
ing around parties trying to catch
students breaking the rules.
"We don't go out looking for
violators," he said. "We only act
off complaints that we receive
from students, staff, faculty or the
police department."
Despite the high number of or
ganizations on alcohol probation,
the actual number of registered
parties this quarter has exceeded
the number for fall quarter of last
year. According to Assistant Direc
tor of Student Activities Joey
Greenwall, there have been 100
parties registered this fall as op
posed to 86 last year.
Because three fraternities are
on alcohol probation, residences
and student groups have been
holding more parties this year.

The number of parties registered
by Greek organizations fell from
24 last fall to 20 this fall, while resi
dence parties climbed from 47 to
58, and the number of parties reg
istered by student groups climbed
from 15 to 22.
Being put on alcohol proba
tion is not the only penalty that
can be imposed on groups that vi
olate the alcohol policy. Offend
ing organizations must also do
extra community service, host
workshops for other groups on
safe partying, throw dry parties,
and, in the most extreme case, a
fraternity or sorority can even
lose its house.
"With the new Vice Provost
[for Student Affairs Gene Awaku
ni], things have changed," said
Peter de Pentheny O'Kelly, the
president of the Sigma Alpha Ep
silon fraternity, one of the three
housed fraternities not on alco
hol probation.
"The risks involved in throwing
a big open party are still the same
as before, but consequences are
much worse, and that puts us into
a position where we might not
want to throw big, open parties,"
he continued.
Nate Ferhoff, the president of
the Kappa Alpha fraternity,
echoed similar reservations about
hosting big parties.
"We would love to provide the
service of big, open parties to the
community, but things like under
