# Season goes from bad to worse
## Cardinal offense falters behind QB Kyle Matter 
### MATT LONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The stars seemed perfectly
aligned fora Stanford victory over
UCLA.
First, the Bruins were forced to
start their fourth-string quarter
back, an 18-year-old true fresh
man who had never taken a snap
in college. Then, the Bruins did
everything but spot the Cardinal
two touchdowns, just for showing
up at the Rose Bowl.

But UCLA running back Tyler
Ebell and the Bruins' smothering
defense combined to send Stan
ford's hope fora winning streak —
and its first win against a quality
opponent — careening into space
with a 28-18 loss.
Ebell blasted off for his fourth
straight 100-yard rushing game,
the first UCLA freshman to ac
complish the feat. He rushed for
160 yards on 39 attempts.
"With more carries, I feel that I
become a better runner," Ebell
said.
He was true to his feelings Satur
day, as his fourth quarter 18-yard
touchdown showed. On a counter
play, Ebell broke redshirt freshman
linebacker Jon Alston's tackle and
out raced the Cardinal to the end
zone, giving UCLA a 22-18 lead.
Stanford took a 15-0 lead just
five minutes into the first quarter
after capitalizing on two Bruin
turnovers, but its hapless offense
could manage just a field goal for
the rest of the game. The Cardinal
had a season-low 241 yards in total
offense and was held scoreless in
the second half.
Both teams were playing with
out their starting quarterbacks.
UCIA lost starter Cory Pa us and
true freshman backup Drew
Olson in last Saturday's loss at
California — Pans with a season
ending broken ankle and Olson
with a shoulder injury. That left
Bruin coach Bob Toledo with the
decision of starting redshirt

freshman Jon Sciarra or untested
true freshman Matt Moore. Tole
do chose the latter, forfeiting
Moore's redshirt year.
With the Cardinal's junior
starter Chris Lewis sidelined by a
shoulder injury, redshirt fresh
man Kyle Matter was given the
nod by head coach Buddy
Teevens, setting up a showdown
under center of two former high
school teammates. Both Matter
and Moore starred at Hart High
School in Santa Clarita, Calif.
Moore got the better of his high
school predecessor Saturday
night, passing for 142 yards and
one touchdown on 7-of-19 pass
ing. Matter finished with just 75

yards and an interception, com
pleting 10 out of his 22 throws.
Matter was constantly hurried
by the UCIA pass rush, and the
Stanford offensive line gave up six
sacks, fhe young quarterback
showed mobility by scrambling for
70 yards, but in the end the pres
sure proved too much.
"Pressure makes everything
more difficult back there as a quar
terback," Matter said. "After a
while, getting hit takes its toll."
Mistakes took their toll early on
for the Bruius. After Stanford
punted away its first possession,
Ebell fumbled the kick at the UCLA
28 when a Cardinal was blocked
into him. Stanford recovered, and

Matter completed two passes to
carry his team to the goal line,
where senior running back Kerry
Carter plunged into the end zone.
Three plays later, freshman de
fensive end Julian Jenkins
scooped up a fumbled snap at the
UCIA 3-yard line and crossed
into the end zone.
"We were finally starting to click
on all cylinders," senior defensive
tackle Matt Leonard said. "I give a
lot of credit to UCLA. They
chipped away until they won the
ball game."
Most of the chipping was done
by Bruin kicker Nate Fiske. The
starting punter, Fiske took over for
UCLA's injured kicker and Ixxrted
all live of bis field goal attempts
through the uprights.
Stanford was able to score just
once more in the contest, as red
shirt freshman Michael Sgroi
kicked a 42-yard field goal in the
second quarter. Sgroi also missed
one kick and had another blocked
in the game.
Still, the Cardinal took an 18-13
lead into halftime and, after Ebell's
touchdown, had a chance to come
back, until Teevens made a deci
sion on fourth-and-1 that he will
remember fora while.
Trailing 25-18 with over six
minutes remaining, Stanford
sophomore wideout Teyo John
son c ut a third-down route short of
the first down marker. Stanford
faced a short fourth down on its
own 29-yard line, and Teevens
elected to go for the first down
rather than punt away and allow
his defense to get the ball back.
The Bruins controlled the line
once again, and senior running
back Kerry Carter was stopped at
the line of scrimmage, turning the
ball over on downs and leading to
a 44-yard Fiske field goal that iced
the game for the Bruins.
"The guys were excited about
[going for the first down],"
Teevens said. "In hindsight 1 re
gret the decision."
Stanford drove all the way to
the Bruin 18 on its next possession,
and on a fourth down with just
under a minute remaining, a
scrambling Matter flung a ball up
that found Carter, who broke a
number of tackles to get into the
end zone. But the play was called

ball up, a penalty that cost Stan
