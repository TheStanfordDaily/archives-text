### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Stanford women's volley

inant team in the country, the Car
dinal has sporadically floundered
against even its weakest opponents.

Friday: No. 6 Stanford 3, Oregon 0
Saturday: Stanford 3, Oregon St. 2

The No. () Cardinal's dual na
ture was in rare form this weekend
against the Oregon schools, the
Pacific-10 Conference's cellar
dwellers, as Stanford (19-3, 9-2
Pac-10) struggled to put consecu
tive solid games together in pick
ing up two conference wins at
Maples Pavilion.
Stanford came within a point
of dropping a game to Oregon
(10-15, 0-11) when it swept the
Ducks in front of 1,587 on Friday
night. On Saturday, 1,061
skipped watching Came 0 of the
World Series to see the Cardinal
flip between playing some of its
best and worst volleyball of the
year in edging Oregon State (7-
13,2-9)3-2.
"Tonight's an example of what
volleyball is like," Stanford coach
John Dunning said after Satur
day night's 3-2 win over the
Beavers. "When you outserve
and outpass a team the way Or e
gon State did tonight, it neutral
izes almost everything else. They
passed great, and you never
know what's going to happen.

That's the Pac-10. That's the
team in ninth place in the Pac-10.
They're good."
A Herculean effort by senior
outside hitter Logan Torn and ju
nior middle blocker Sara McGee
staved off disaster for the Cardinal
in the fifth game against the
Heavers. Behind six kills from
those two, Stanford slammed ()re
gon State 15-5 in the decisive
game, hitting .471 with no hitting
errors and outblocking the
Beavers 4-0.
"We picked it up in the fifth
game. If we play with that inten
sity every game, we'll do al
right," said McGee, who led all

players on Saturday with 10
blocks while picking up IS kills
at a .552 hitting clip. "I don't
know if ii was because we were
pissed [that we bad to go to a
fifth game], but we can play like
that every game."
The Cardinal dominated the
Beavers at the net, outblocking
them 25.5-2 during the match, but
during the night other parts of
Stanford's game came and went,
with its control over the match fol
lowing suit.

112 he Cardinal appeared to
take control in the second game,
as nine of Tom's match-high 25
kills guided Stanford to a 30-20
win. Fhe Cardinal followed that
up with an even more dominat
ing performance in the third
game, outhitting the Beavers
.433 to .000 behind seven kills
and four blocks from McGee in
the 30-1 0 win.
But in the fourth game, Stan
ford's passing and blocking sud
denly slipped away. Oregon State
controlled most of the game as
Stanford was forced to send an un
usually high number of free balls
over the net and the Beavers
seemed to capitalize on every Car
dinal mistake.
Stanford managed to battle
back late in the game behind
strong serving from Tom, even
getting a match point at 30-29,
but the Beavers recovered fora
33-31 win to force the lopsided
fifth game.
Senior outside hitter Megan
McMillan led Oregon State with
19 kills, heading a group of four
Beaver hitters with double-digit
kills, but with 38 hitting errors —
most resulting from Stanford
blocks — Oregon State only hit
.176 in the match.
"We need to go out last. We
have a tendency to start slow,"
Tom said. "We need to work on
the mental, get it going in the
pregame warmups and just keep
it up."

high 18 digs in the match, leading
the Cardinal to outdig the
Beavers, the Pac-10's digging
leader, 76-62.
"We're trying to find our
rhythm, and we have it some
times and we don't others," Dun
ning said. "It goes with how we

pass and how we dig. It's very ex
citing for our team [to outdig
Oregon State]."
On Friday, Oregon was also
able to give Stanford a brief
scare, coming within one point
of taking the second game,
though the Cardinal held on to
hand the Ducks their 30th
straight Pac-10 loss.
Stanford sophomore outside
hitter Ogonna Nnamani stole the
show early on, quickly picking up
13 kills without any errors to
guide the Cardinal to a 30-21
first-game win and a 9-8 lead in
the second game.
But Oregon, next to last in
the Pac-10 in blocking to start
the weekend, started touching a
lot of balls at the net as the game
proceeded. Dunning was also
experimenting with having
freshman setter Katie Ooldhahn
play in the back row in place of
starting junior setter Anna
Robinson. Though the system
showed some promise, there
were some kiuks that needed to
be worked out, and the Ducks
sudden blocking didn't help
matters.
Oregon reached game point at
29-28, but freshman Dariam
Acevedo, who led the Ducks with
10 kills in the match, then served
one into the net, and back-to-back
kills by McGee salvaged a 31-29
win for the Cardinal.
With that win behind them,
Stanford never trailed in the third
game, cruising to 30-21 win to seal
the match.
"[Goldhahn and Robinson]
both bring something different to
the court, so we were trying to see
if we split time between them how
it would work," Dunning said. "It
will work fine, but it didn't work
great tonight."
Nnamani finished with 17 kills
while Tom added another 1 1
along with a team-high nine digs.
The Cardinal heads south this
weekend fora big rematch with

Stanford was forced to send an un

On Friday, Oregon was also

Stanford sophomore outside

Robinson. Though the system
showed some promise, there
were some kiuks that needed to

Oregon reached game point at

Acevedo, who led the Ducks with

"[Goldhahn and Robinson]

Friday: No. 6 Stanford 3, Oregon 0
Saturday: Stanford 3, Oregon St. 2

The No. () Cardinal's dual na
ture was in rare form this weekend
against the Oregon schools, the
Pacific-10 Conference's cellar
dwellers, as Stanford (19-3, 9-2
Pac-10) struggled to put consecu
tive solid games together in pick
ing up two conference wins at
Maples Pavilion.
Stanford came within a point
of dropping a game to Oregon
(10-15, 0-11) when it swept the
Ducks in front of 1,587 on Friday
night. On Saturday, 1,061

World Series to see the Cardinal
flip between playing some of its
best and worst volleyball of the

"Tonight's an example of what
volleyball is like," Stanford coach
John Dunning said after Satur
day night's 3-2 win over the
Beavers. "When you outserve

izes almost everything else. They
passed great, and you never
know what's going to happen.

That's the Pac-10. That's the
team in ninth place in the Pac-10.
They're good."
A Herculean effort by senior
outside hitter Logan Torn and ju
nior middle blocker Sara McGee
staved off disaster for the Cardinal
in the fifth game against the
Heavers. Behind six kills from
those two, Stanford slammed ()re
gon State 15-5 in the decisive
game, hitting .471 with no hitting
errors and outblocking the
Beavers 4-0.
"We picked it up in the fifth
game. If we play with that inten
sity every game, we'll do al
right," said McGee, who led all

players on Saturday with 10
blocks while picking up IS kills
at a .552 hitting clip. "I don't
know if ii was because we were
pissed [that we bad to go to a
