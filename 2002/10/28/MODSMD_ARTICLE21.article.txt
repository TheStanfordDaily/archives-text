The Stanford women's volley

dinal has sporadically floundered
against even its weakest opponents.

Friday: No. 6 Stanford 3, Oregon 0
Saturday: Stanford 3, Oregon St. 2

The No. () Cardinal's dual na
ture was in rare form this weekend
against the Oregon schools, the
Pacific-10 Conference's cellar
dwellers, as Stanford (19-3, 9-2
Pac-10) struggled to put consecu
tive solid games together in pick
ing up two conference wins at
Maples Pavilion.
Stanford came within a point
of dropping a game to Oregon
(10-15, 0-11) when it swept the
Ducks in front of 1,587 on Friday
night. On Saturday, 1,061
skipped watching Came 0 of the
World Series to see the Cardinal
flip between playing some of its
best and worst volleyball of the
year in edging Oregon State (7-
13,2-9)3-2.
"Tonight's an example of what
volleyball is like," Stanford coach
John Dunning said after Satur
day night's 3-2 win over the
Beavers. "When you outserve
and outpass a team the way Or e
gon State did tonight, it neutral
izes almost everything else. They
passed great, and you never
know what's going to happen.

That's the Pac-10. That's the
team in ninth place in the Pac-10.
They're good."
A Herculean effort by senior
outside hitter Logan Torn and ju
nior middle blocker Sara McGee
staved off disaster for the Cardinal
in the fifth game against the
Heavers. Behind six kills from
those two, Stanford slammed ()re
gon State 15-5 in the decisive
game, hitting .471 with no hitting
errors and outblocking the
Beavers 4-0.
"We picked it up in the fifth
game. If we play with that inten
sity every game, we'll do al
right," said McGee, who led all

players on Saturday with 10
blocks while picking up IS kills
at a .552 hitting clip. "I don't
know if ii was because we were
pissed [that we bad to go to a
fifth game], but we can play like
that every game."
The Cardinal dominated the
Beavers at the net, outblocking
them 25.5-2 during the match, but
during the night other parts of
Stanford's game came and went,
with its control over the match fol
lowing suit.
