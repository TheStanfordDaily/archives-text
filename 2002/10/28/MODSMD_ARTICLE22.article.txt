Field Hockey
Yesterday: Stanford 11, UCSB (club) 0
Even the most casual observer
could it'll that this was a blowout by
just looking at the* scoreboard at
any time during the match.
With 7:15 left in the second half,
on Stanford's side of the lighted
board, the score showed 1 1 goals, a
ridiculous 17 penalty corners and
an incredible 4.S shots. For Santa

Barbara, it was just a trio of illumi
nated zeroes.
112 lic Cauchos' club team was
overwhelmed by the Cardinal var
sity squad. Because of l'( '.SB's club
status, the victory did not count in
the Cardinal's season statistics,
meaning Stanford remains at 8-9
overall and 4-1 in the Northern Pa
cific Athletic Conference.
The game ended 1 1-0, with Stan
ford allowing only one shot in the
waning moments, when a defensive
breakdown led to a U( '.SB forward
finding herself open in front of the
net. However, junior goalkeeper
Emily Zander was quit k on the up
take, stuffing the shot before it had a
chance to leave the attackers stick.
"It was a good opportunity to
practice individual skills," said se
nior tri-captain Christina Williams.

I he same sentiment was echoed
main times by Stanford players, .ill
of whom appreciated the opportu
nity to play in different positions.
"It was line appreciation day,"
said junior forward Keely Mach
mer-Wessels; who spent her play
ing time yesterday in the back line,
where she learned the value of the
work the defenders do during the
regular season.
I he Cauchos weren't able to get
any good plays on the ball, as su
perb passing out of the Cardinal
backfield to the strikers kept the
l ! ( ISB midf ielders on their heels.
"The [UCSB] game did a lot. It
allowed us to play with a lot of con
fidence, and allowed us to see peo
ple in different roles," said Stanford
assistant coach Lesley Irvine, who
will takeover the headcoachingjob

at iht* end of the season once long
time head coach Sheryl Johnson
steps down.
"We pulled the seniors out, and
got the freshmen in on set plays and
in leadership positions," Irvine said.
"That was fun; they really stepped
up and hit the ground running."
Commenting on the win, Irvine
c< included by saying, "We had a spe
cific game plan, and we executed it."
I he win gives a lot of confidence
lo the Cardinal squad, whose fin
ishing abilities have been in ques
tion of late, especially at home.
Stanford has only scored five goals
in five games at home, despite usu
ally outshooting its opponents.
Stanford needed to get a good
confidence boost before going into
