### MARK DOMINIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
Last Thursday evening, the Stanford Police
Dep. u tment took junior Nathan Charles Peter
son into custody for alleged rape and penetra
tion with a foreign object.
Peterson was held overnight in the Santa
Clara County jail; bail, which had been set at
$50,000, was posted on Friday afternoon.
I he victim of the alleged crimes is an 18-year
old freshman.
The crimes are alleged to have occurred at
about 2:15 a.m. on Saturday, Oct. 19. The victim
reported that Peterson came to her dorm room
to visit her, and then lie proceeded to rape her.
The two knew each other for about one week be
fore the incident is said to have occurred.
"This was not a forcible attack," said Lieu
tenant Hilary Karp of the Stanford police. "He
went to visit her."
Karp would not comment about whether al
cohol was involved in the alleged incident.

"We are not releasing whether the two were
legally drunk," he said. "We are continuing with
interviews and don't want to taint other people's
impressions of things.
"1 don't know if they were drunk. We're not
commenting on their level of intoxication."
Dean of Students Marc Wais noted that this is
the first sexual assault on campus that was re
ported to the police in his seven-year tenure as
dean of students.
Daniel Barton, Peterson's attorney, said
that he and Peterson have not yet been pro
vided with police reports from the alleged in
cident; therefore, Barton was unable to com
ment on the allegations.
"Police reports are not generally available to
the defendant until criminal charges are filed,"
Barton said. "As of Friday, the District Attorney's
office had not reviewed the reports or filed
charges .... As of noon-ish on Friday, no Dis
trict Attorney was aware of the case."
Barton said that the District Attorney's office
would probably reach a decision about whether

01 not to c harge Peterson within two weeks. Pe
terson's arraignment is tentatively scheduled lor
Nov. 12.
Barton, although unwilling to comment on
the specifics of the case, said that his office is con
ductingan ongoing investigation of the incident.
Barton believes what happened on the night of
Oct. 19 was not rape.
"Nathan did not show up at the girl's door un
invited," Barton said. "What happened in the
room doesn't even resemble a rape.
"When all the facts are known, it will be clear
that Nathan committed no crime. It is a shame
that accusations get so much publicity before
there is a full hearing of the facts because when
somebody is labeled a rapist or a sex offender,
the damage is done even though later on it be
comes clear that the accusation was false and the
charges were not true."
Peterson is still a student in good standing at
Stanford. Wais said that the University's judicial
proceedings operate independent
ly of the criminal justice system.
"The victim has been appraised
of her light to pursue this matter
with the Office of Judicial Affairs as
a possible violation of the Universi
ty's Fundamental Standard," Wais
said. "Stanford provides a hearing
in front of a judicial panel — com
prised of four students, one faculty
member and one staff member, al
ways chaired by a student —in
every case in which a student is
charged with violating the Funda
mental Standard or Honor Code.

I his judicial panel determines guilt
or innocence.
"If found guilty, this same judi
cial panel also determines what it
believes to be appropriate sanc
tions. Sanctions can include expul
sion from the University."
As of Friday afternoon, the vic -
tim had not filed a complaint with
the Office of Judicial Affairs.
The implications these allega
tions may have for Peterson s eligi
bility on the Stanford wrestling
team are unclear. After the alleged
incident, Peterson's biography was
removed from gosUinford.com, the
official Stanford Athletics Web site.
As of publication time, the Depart
ment of Athletics had not returned
The Daily's calls.
