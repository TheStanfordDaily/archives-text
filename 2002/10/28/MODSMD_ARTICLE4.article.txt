# More than 45,000 protest war in S.F.

### ANTHONY HA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Tens of thousands of people
marched in San Francisco last
Saturday to protest the potential
U.S. war against Iraq. Among the
rally's attendees were activists
from other West Coast cities such
as Seattle and Los Angeles, as
well as between 50 and 100 Stan
fot d students.
"1 was really encouraged by the
energy at the rally," said physics
research assistant Justin Vanden
broucke '02. "The best thing about
it was the strength of support from
people of all ages, races, social
groups and economic groups. It
wasn't just old hippies or college
students or anarchists or upper
middle-class left-wingers."
Students used the Caltrain
Samtrans bus line, buses provid
ed by the Peninsula Peace and
Justice Center and, in a lew cases,
nothing more than a bicycle, to
reach the protest.
While some students claimed
that over 100 Stanford students
were present at the anti-war

rally, graduate student Mandeep
S. Gill, a member of the Red
wood Action Team at Stanford,
had been compiling a list of Stan
ford attendees and estimated a
turnout between 50 and 70. Re
sponses to The Daily's inquiries
on various e-mail lists resulted in
an estimate of about 50.
The demonstration began at
Justin Herman Plaza at 1 1 a.m.,
where the streets and sidewalks
were packed with people waiting
to march. Protesters hoisted
signs and placards, one pro
claiming "Berkeley teachers Say
No to War" and another declar
ing "Of Course it's war for oil."
The demonstrators walked up
Market Street towards the San
Francisco Civic Center, accom
panied by the beat of bongo
drums, and with spontaneous
waves of cheering traveling
through the crowd.
Among the over 20 speakers at
the civic center were U.S. Rep.
Barbara Lee, I)-Oakland; Peter
Camejo, California gubernatorial
