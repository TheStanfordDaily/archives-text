# More than 45,000 protest war in S.F.
## 
### ANTHONY HA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Tens of thousands of people
marched in San Francisco last
Saturday to protest the potential
U.S. war against Iraq. Among the
rally's attendees were activists
from other West Coast cities such
as Seattle and Los Angeles, as
well as between 50 and 100 Stan
fot d students.
"1 was really encouraged by the
energy at the rally," said physics
research assistant Justin Vanden
broucke '02. "The best thing about
it was the strength of support from
people of all ages, races, social
groups and economic groups. It
wasn't just old hippies or college
students or anarchists or upper
middle-class left-wingers."
Students used the Caltrain
Samtrans bus line, buses provid
ed by the Peninsula Peace and
Justice Center and, in a lew cases,
nothing more than a bicycle, to
reach the protest.
While some students claimed
that over 100 Stanford students
were present at the anti-war

rally, graduate student Mandeep
S. Gill, a member of the Red
wood Action Team at Stanford,
had been compiling a list of Stan
ford attendees and estimated a
turnout between 50 and 70. Re
sponses to The Daily's inquiries
on various e-mail lists resulted in
an estimate of about 50.
The demonstration began at
Justin Herman Plaza at 1 1 a.m.,
where the streets and sidewalks
were packed with people waiting
to march. Protesters hoisted
signs and placards, one pro
claiming "Berkeley teachers Say
No to War" and another declar
ing "Of Course it's war for oil."
The demonstrators walked up
Market Street towards the San
Francisco Civic Center, accom
panied by the beat of bongo
drums, and with spontaneous
waves of cheering traveling
through the crowd.
Among the over 20 speakers at
the civic center were U.S. Rep.
Barbara Lee, I)-Oakland; Peter
Camejo, California gubernatorial

politicians and activists addressed the crowd.
candidate for the Green Party; and
Barbara Lubin of the Middle East Chil
dren's Alliance.
"People tell me that I'm too angry,"
Lubin said. "I don't think that you can
be too angry; I don't think that you can
be angry enough! I was distributing
lood in Baghdad, and a child said to
me, ' fell the people in the United
States not to kill us.' "
Richard Becker, a member of the
national steering committee of Interna
tional Ac t Now to Stop War and Racism
(ANSWER), which organized the rally,
told those in attendance, "There is truly
only one force on earth that can stop
the war, and that is the people."
He then directed his audience to
www.votenowar.org, where they
could become involved in a national
anti-war referendum.
According to Brenda Ryan, a mem
ber of the International ANSWER
coalition, the group was started shortly
alter the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11,
2001, to protest what it saw as the U.S.
government's violent and aggressive
actions in the Middle East.
Members of the coalition include
the Free Palestine Alliance, IFCO Pas
tors lor Peace, the International Ac
tion Center and the Partnership for

Civil Justice.
"We held this rally to show the Bush
administration that the people won't
allow this war to happen," Ryan said.
The San Francisco Police Depart
ment estimated that there were 45,000
people present at the demonstration,
while International ANSWER claimed
that the number was between 80,000
and 100,000.
Ryan pointed out that during the
march, demonstrators filled the entire
1.7-mile route from Justin Herman
Plaza to the civic center, and that it took
three hours for all of the demonstrators
to finish the march.
International ANSWER also orga
nized a similar demonstration in Wash
ington, D.C. on Saturday — a demon
stration that drew over 100,000 atten
dees and may be the largest anti-war
demonstration in the nation's capital
since the Vietnam War.
Despite the size of Saturday's protest
in San Francisco, some Stanford stu
dents expressed reservations about the
event. Senior Jessica Jenkins, a mem
ber of the Stanford Coalition for Peace
and Justice, described her reaction to
the rally as "underwhelmed."
"I found the range of speakers un
focused and the content of the speak
ers unanalytical, and the strong, radi
cal, language and style was alienating
to some who would otherwise support
the anti-war stance," she said.
"The current situation is unique

because ii is not just t he 'usual crowd'
getting aware and involved. The
movement needs to reflect the diverse
views represented and adapt and he
come more inclusive to build a
stronger, broader, base of support,"
Jenkins added.
Junior lan Timothy Slattery, anoth
er member of the SCPJ, also expressed
reservations about the protest.
"What worries me is the question,
'What's the goal of the protest?' he
said. "How can we use those protests
and those numbers to stop the war?"
Slattery also said that he found that
the rally was not accommodating of
the different views found in the anti
war movement.
"There are many people who still
aren't sure about their position on the
war, whether we should bomb Iraq or
not," he said.
"And 1 would hope that some of
them would say, 'Well, we need to wait
until we know beyond a reasonable
doubt that this is the right thing to do.
We cannot bomb Iraq yet; we can't just
rush into it.' There was no place for that
kind of opinion [on Saturday]."
Despite his concerns, Slattery said
that he would attend any future anti
war rallies.
"Either way, it's a spiral," he said.
"Either more and more people keep
showing up at rallies, or the attendance
drops and drops. I think that there are
enough benefits that it's worth it.

were present at the anti-war

rally, graduate student Mandeep
S. Gill, a member of the Red

an estimate of about 50.
The demonstration began at
Justin Herman Plaza at 1 1 a.m.,
where the streets and sidewalks
were packed with people waiting

signs and placards, one pro
claiming "Berkeley teachers Say
No to War" and another declar

The demonstrators walked up
Market Street towards the San

Yesterday tens of thousands of anti-war protesters marched through San
Francisco. The event culminated at the San Francisco Civic Center, where
politicians and activists addressed the crowd.
candidate for the Green Party; and
Barbara Lubin of the Middle East Chil
dren's Alliance.
"People tell me that I'm too angry,"
Lubin said. "I don't think that you can
be too angry; I don't think that you can
be angry enough! I was distributing
lood in Baghdad, and a child said to
me, ' fell the people in the United
States not to kill us.' "
Richard Becker, a member of the
national steering committee of Interna
tional Ac t Now to Stop War and Racism
(ANSWER), which organized the rally,
told those in attendance, "There is truly
only one force on earth that can stop
the war, and that is the people."
He then directed his audience to
www.votenowar.org, where they
could become involved in a national
anti-war referendum.
According to Brenda Ryan, a mem
ber of the International ANSWER
coalition, the group was started shortly
alter the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11,
2001, to protest what it saw as the U.S.
government's violent and aggressive
actions in the Middle East.
Members of the coalition include
the Free Palestine Alliance, IFCO Pas
tors lor Peace, the International Ac
tion Center and the Partnership for

Civil Justice.
"We held this rally to show the Bush
administration that the people won't
allow this war to happen," Ryan said.
The San Francisco Police Depart
ment estimated that there were 45,000
people present at the demonstration,
while International ANSWER claimed
that the number was between 80,000
and 100,000.
Ryan pointed out that during the
march, demonstrators filled the entire
1.7-mile route from Justin Herman
Plaza to the civic center, and that it took
three hours for all of the demonstrators
to finish the march.
International ANSWER also orga
nized a similar demonstration in Wash
ington, D.C. on Saturday — a demon
stration that drew over 100,000 atten
dees and may be the largest anti-war
demonstration in the nation's capital
since the Vietnam War.
Despite the size of Saturday's protest
in San Francisco, some Stanford stu
dents expressed reservations about the
event. Senior Jessica Jenkins, a mem
ber of the Stanford Coalition for Peace
and Justice, described her reaction to
the rally as "underwhelmed."
"I found the range of speakers un
focused and the content of the speak
ers unanalytical, and the strong, radi
cal, language and style was alienating
to some who would otherwise support
the anti-war stance," she said.
"The current situation is unique

because ii is not just t he 'usual crowd'
getting aware and involved. The
movement needs to reflect the diverse
views represented and adapt and he
come more inclusive to build a
stronger, broader, base of support,"
Jenkins added.
Junior lan Timothy Slattery, anoth
er member of the SCPJ, also expressed
reservations about the protest.
"What worries me is the question,
'What's the goal of the protest?' he
said. "How can we use those protests
and those numbers to stop the war?"
Slattery also said that he found that
the rally was not accommodating of
the different views found in the anti
war movement.
"There are many people who still
aren't sure about their position on the
war, whether we should bomb Iraq or
not," he said.
"And 1 would hope that some of
them would say, 'Well, we need to wait
until we know beyond a reasonable
doubt that this is the right thing to do.
We cannot bomb Iraq yet; we can't just
rush into it.' There was no place for that
kind of opinion [on Saturday]."
Despite his concerns, Slattery said
that he would attend any future anti
war rallies.
"Either way, it's a spiral," he said.
"Either more and more people keep
showing up at rallies, or the attendance
drops and drops. I think that there are
enough benefits that it's worth it.
Tens of thousands of people
marched in San Francisco last
Saturday to protest the potential
U.S. war against Iraq. Among the
rally's attendees were activists
from other West Coast cities such
as Seattle and Los Angeles, as
well as between 50 and 100 Stan
fot d students.
"1 was really encouraged by the
energy at the rally," said physics
research assistant Justin Vanden
broucke '02. "The best thing about
it was the strength of support from
people of all ages, races, social
groups and economic groups. It
wasn't just old hippies or college
students or anarchists or upper
middle-class left-wingers."
Students used the Caltrain
Samtrans bus line, buses provid
ed by the Peninsula Peace and
Justice Center and, in a lew cases,
nothing more than a bicycle, to
reach the protest.
