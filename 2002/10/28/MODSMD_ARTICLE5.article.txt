# Sexual harassment policy revised
## New policy discourages relationships between students and professors 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Last Friday, the Sexual Harass
ment Policy Of lite notified the Stan
ford community of revisions to the
University's sexual harassment pol
icy. The revised policy establishes
new guidelines for consensual sexu
al and romantic relationships be
tween individuals in unequal posi
tions, like student-teacher relation
ships, at the University.
The text of the policy's revised
section was enclosed with an ac
companying explanation by
LaOoris Cordell, vice provost and
special counselor to the president
tor campus relations, in an e-mail
message that was sent out at the end
of last week to faculty, staff, students
and volunteers.
"It is important that everyone in
the Stanford community be aware
of this revision and act to comply
with the policy," Cordell said.

The new policy proclaims that
there are risks in consensual sexual
or romantic relationships between
individuals in "inherently unequal
positions."
"Because of the potential for
conflict of interest, exploitation, fa
voritism and bias, such relation
ships may undermine the real or
perceived integrity of the supervi
sion and evaluation provided, and
the trust inherent particularly in
the teacher-student context," the
policy states.
"(The relationships] may, more
over, be less consensual than the in
dividual whose position confers
power or authority believes. The re
lationship is likely to be perceived in
different ways by each of the parties
to it, especially in retrospect."
Cordell explained that, in re
sponse to the acknowledged risks,
the policy seeks to remedy any con
flicts or problems that could arise
out of such relationships.
"It sets forth certain rules that
must be adhered to in such relation
ships, including the requirements
that the person in the position of
greater power must ensure that he
or she does not exercise any super

visory or evaluative function over
the other person in the relationship,
and must provide certain notifica
tions," (lordell said.
Specifically, if an individual is in a
position designated to evaluate his
or her partner, lie or she is expect
ed to recuse him or herself from the
evaluation process and notify su
pervisors of the change.
The policy goes on to declare
that such "inherently unequal" rela
tionships are undesirable, but not
expressly forbidden.
"The University believes that a
sexual or romantic: relationship be
tween a teacher and a student,
even where consensual and
whether or not the student would
otherwise be subject to supervision
or evaluation by the teac her, is in
consistent with the proper role of
the teacher, and should be avoid
ed," the policy states. "The Univer
sity therefore very strongly dis
courages such relationships."
Students tended to agree with
the revision.
"If a student likes a professor,

from going out with the professor,
but, at the same time, [the situa
tion] should not be unfair to the
other students," said Timnit
Gebru, a sophomore.
"I think (the policy] is reason
able, because even if the professor
thinks he or she is being fair, I

don't think that the professor can
be fail". I lis feelings for the student
will probably get in the way,"
Gebrn continued.
Some even expressed surprise at
the revision — not because of its
controversial nature, but because of
its basic common sense appeal.
"It took them this long to add
that?" said David Adiezes, a junior.
"All this time I assumed that was al
ways the policy. What in the world
were the guidelines previously?"
