## Health care 
### ADRIENNE CLARK 
In an area beset by gentrification, Arbor Free
Clinic is one of the few providers of immediate, no
cost health care. Each Sunday, its volunteers — all
members of the Stanford community — see pa
tients between 11:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. at Menlo
Park's Veteran's Affairs Hospital.
"It's a good environment for patients and med
ical students, who are the ones doing the exams,"
Clinic Manager Brooke Cotter said. "There's no
time limit. They can take as long as they want or
need in diagnosis and treatment. As a result, the pa
tient gets really good, thorough care."
Each patient at Arbor is seen by a series of vol
unteers. A Stanford undergraduate first takes a
visitor's medical history. Then the patient sees a
pre-clinical medical student and is given an exam
by a clinical medical student. The medical stu
dent's diagnosis is presented to a volunteer physi
cian, who can then approve treatment with the
limited medication available on-site or distribute
a pharmacy voucher.
Arbor primarily offers acute care for those in
need of immediate treatment, but Lars Osterberg,
the clinic's medical director of four years, stresses
that its role does not end there.
"We can help patients with chronic health is
sues until they are connected to a primary care
physician," he said. "We can serve as the patients'
advocate and enable them to access the broader
health-care system."
A county benefits analyst is available every Sun
day to help patients enroll in government insur
ance programs such as Medicaid, Medicare and
Medical. The clinic offers optometry and dental
exams monthly. Patient education is also a compo
nent of Arbor's treatment system.
"It's important to provide our patients with in
formation on staying healthy, especially since they
may have difficulty accessing health care," Cotter
said. "We have pamphlets and information packets
for them, and we're hoping to get a web-based data
base set up to enable us to store more information
and provide better access for patients."
Arbor has grown significantly from its hum
ble beginnings. It started 12 years ago as a stu
dent project funded by the Medical School's
Medical Scholars program and was originally
run out of the Palo Alto Red Cross facility.
Now Arbor is autonomously funded and relies
on alumni donations as well as grants to serve
its patients. One organization, the Peninsula
Community Foundation, recently gave
$14,000 to the clinic.
" Twelve years ago, it was really a shoestring
operation," Osterberg said. "They'd have one
physician come in, and they'd see a couple of
patients each Sunday. Now we see more than
20 patients a week. We're chartered and have
support from the Stanford dean's office, so
our doctors have malpractice coverage."
Arbor relies on word-of-mout.li and con
tads with other area groups to publicize for its
services. Its stall is currently developing a
bank of community resources lor medical and
non-medical referrals.
"We do a lot of homeless outreach and dis
tribute pamphlets," Cotter said. "We have a
symbiotic relationship with other organiza
tions in the area, too: We refer patients out
and get referrals in. We keep a database of
community resources so that we can connect
our patients to hospitals or other clinics for
continued care, or get them in touch with
child care or food stamp programs."
A key component to Arbor's success is its

undergraduate volunteers. 1 hey perform pa
tient intake, interpret between Spanish and
English and do clerical work.
"Undergrads are the first people our pa
tients see," said senior Erin Boyd, the under
graduate interpretation coordinator. "And in
terpreters go with patients through the entire
process, from intake to physician. I hey trans
late at each step of the way.
"We get so many patients who have been
in the states for years but have little English.
They've either stayed at home or worked
with other Spanish-speakers; they've not
had the opportunity to learn and practice.
They're so happy to be able to talk to anyone
who understands them and cares about their
health concerns. A lot haven't received any
basic care at all in years."
In addition to its Sunday clinic, Arbor coor
dinates the Children's Heath Fair, which will
be put on this summer at East Palo Alto's
South County Community Clinic. In its fifth
year, the Heath Fair will provide free physical
exams, dental exams and vaccines.
"We see about 100 kids over two full Satur
days. Our goal is toofFer anything they need to
be ready go back to school," Cotter said.
That includes connecting families with
available resources. According to the Chil
dren's Defense Fund, approximately 5.8
million of the 9 million uninsured children
in the U.S. qualify for Medicaid or the State
Children's Health Insurance Program. To
facilitate ongoing access to health care and
immunizations, benefits analysts are avail
able at the Health Fair to enroll families in
government programs.

Community Foundation, recently gave
$14,000 to the clinic.
" Twelve years ago, it was really a shoestring
operation," Osterberg said. "They'd have one
physician come in, and they'd see a couple of
patients each Sunday. Now we see more than
20 patients a week. We're chartered and have
support from the Stanford dean's office, so
our doctors have malpractice coverage."
Arbor relies on word-of-mout.li and con
tads with other area groups to publicize for its
services. Its stall is currently developing a
bank of community resources lor medical and
non-medical referrals.
"We do a lot of homeless outreach and dis
tribute pamphlets," Cotter said. "We have a
symbiotic relationship with other organiza
tions in the area, too: We refer patients out
and get referrals in. We keep a database of
community resources so that we can connect
our patients to hospitals or other clinics for
continued care, or get them in touch with
child care or food stamp programs."
A key component to Arbor's success is its

undergraduate volunteers. 1 hey perform pa
tient intake, interpret between Spanish and
English and do clerical work.
"Undergrads are the first people our pa
tients see," said senior Erin Boyd, the under
graduate interpretation coordinator. "And in
terpreters go with patients through the entire
process, from intake to physician. I hey trans
late at each step of the way.
"We get so many patients who have been
in the states for years but have little English.
They've either stayed at home or worked
with other Spanish-speakers; they've not
had the opportunity to learn and practice.
They're so happy to be able to talk to anyone
who understands them and cares about their
health concerns. A lot haven't received any
basic care at all in years."
In addition to its Sunday clinic, Arbor coor
dinates the Children's Heath Fair, which will
be put on this summer at East Palo Alto's
South County Community Clinic. In its fifth
year, the Heath Fair will provide free physical
exams, dental exams and vaccines.
"We see about 100 kids over two full Satur
days. Our goal is toofFer anything they need to
be ready go back to school," Cotter said.
That includes connecting families with
available resources. According to the Chil
dren's Defense Fund, approximately 5.8
million of the 9 million uninsured children
in the U.S. qualify for Medicaid or the State
Children's Health Insurance Program. To
facilitate ongoing access to health care and
immunizations, benefits analysts are avail
able at the Health Fair to enroll families in
government programs.
In an area beset by gentrification, Arbor Free
Clinic is one of the few providers of immediate, no
cost health care. Each Sunday, its volunteers — all
members of the Stanford community — see pa
tients between 11:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. at Menlo
Park's Veteran's Affairs Hospital.
"It's a good environment for patients and med
ical students, who are the ones doing the exams,"
Clinic Manager Brooke Cotter said. "There's no
time limit. They can take as long as they want or
need in diagnosis and treatment. As a result, the pa
tient gets really good, thorough care."
Each patient at Arbor is seen by a series of vol
unteers. A Stanford undergraduate first takes a
visitor's medical history. Then the patient sees a
pre-clinical medical student and is given an exam
by a clinical medical student. The medical stu
dent's diagnosis is presented to a volunteer physi
cian, who can then approve treatment with the
limited medication available on-site or distribute
a pharmacy voucher.
Arbor primarily offers acute care for those in
need of immediate treatment, but Lars Osterberg,
the clinic's medical director of four years, stresses
that its role does not end there.
"We can help patients with chronic health is
sues until they are connected to a primary care
physician," he said. "We can serve as the patients'
advocate and enable them to access the broader
health-care system."
A county benefits analyst is available every Sun
day to help patients enroll in government insur
ance programs such as Medicaid, Medicare and
Medical. The clinic offers optometry and dental
exams monthly. Patient education is also a compo
nent of Arbor's treatment system.
"It's important to provide our patients with in
formation on staying healthy, especially since they
may have difficulty accessing health care," Cotter
said. "We have pamphlets and information packets
for them, and we're hoping to get a web-based data
base set up to enable us to store more information
and provide better access for patients."
Arbor has grown significantly from its hum
ble beginnings. It started 12 years ago as a stu
dent project funded by the Medical School's
Medical Scholars program and was originally
run out of the Palo Alto Red Cross facility.
Now Arbor is autonomously funded and relies
on alumni donations as well as grants to serve
its patients. One organization, the Peninsula
Community Foundation, recently gave
$14,000 to the clinic.
