# Arbor Clinic provides free...
## Health care 
### ADRIENNE CLARK 
In an area beset by gentrification, Arbor Free
Clinic is one of the few providers of immediate, no
cost health care. Each Sunday, its volunteers — all
members of the Stanford community — see pa
tients between 11:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. at Menlo
Park's Veteran's Affairs Hospital.
"It's a good environment for patients and med
ical students, who are the ones doing the exams,"
Clinic Manager Brooke Cotter said. "There's no
time limit. They can take as long as they want or
need in diagnosis and treatment. As a result, the pa
tient gets really good, thorough care."
Each patient at Arbor is seen by a series of vol
unteers. A Stanford undergraduate first takes a
visitor's medical history. Then the patient sees a
pre-clinical medical student and is given an exam
by a clinical medical student. The medical stu
dent's diagnosis is presented to a volunteer physi
cian, who can then approve treatment with the
limited medication available on-site or distribute
a pharmacy voucher.
Arbor primarily offers acute care for those in
need of immediate treatment, but Lars Osterberg,
the clinic's medical director of four years, stresses
that its role does not end there.
"We can help patients with chronic health is
sues until they are connected to a primary care
physician," he said. "We can serve as the patients'
advocate and enable them to access the broader
health-care system."
A county benefits analyst is available every Sun
day to help patients enroll in government insur
ance programs such as Medicaid, Medicare and
Medical. The clinic offers optometry and dental
exams monthly. Patient education is also a compo
nent of Arbor's treatment system.
"It's important to provide our patients with in
formation on staying healthy, especially since they
may have difficulty accessing health care," Cotter
said. "We have pamphlets and information packets
for them, and we're hoping to get a web-based data
base set up to enable us to store more information
and provide better access for patients."
