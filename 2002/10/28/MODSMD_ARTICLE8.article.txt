# Graduate community center in the works
## 
### ALLISON PIERCE 
If all goes according to plan, graduate
students will have a new gathering place to
help them build a sense of community out
side of classrooms, offices and Libs. A two
story, 12,000 square-foot Graduate Stu
dent Community Center is in the works to
be built near Studio 1 of Escondido Village.
According to planners, the center will
serve as the focal point for graduate stu
dent life on campus. While the project is
still in the planning phase, it has secured
space in the accepted 2000 Stanford Com
munity Plan â€” a 10-year campus building
and implementation plan, and the building
site has been approved.
Lisa Marin, deputy chair of the Gradu
ate Student Council, is spearheading the
project in collaboration with other mem
bers of the council, the Graduate Hous
ing Advisory Committee, the Student
Space Committee and ASSU President
Monica I lenestro/a.
Marin said there had been talk of reno
vating Tresidder Union and its surround
ings to create a Stanford community center
in central campus.
"We would like our more modest Grad
uate Community Center to be located in
Escondido Village," she said. "It seems like
a prime spot since the vast majority of on
campus grad students live in East Campus.
It's also on the way home for many grad
students who live off campus in Palo Alto or
Mountain View."
A graduate student survey conducted in
2001 by the GSC, said, "many respondents
commented that graduate housing was iso
lating and that facilities for activities were
poor. Several mentioned specifically that
they would like to see more social activities
in EV and that a community center with a
cafe or pub where grad students could
hang out would be really great."
The new center is to be designed to meet
these needs.

According to the GSC, the center will
create the opportunity lor graduate stu
dents to meet students from other academ
ic disciplines, it will provide an environ
ment that will decrease graduate students'
sense of isolation, it will provide a space to
hold social events and meetings as well as a
space that addresses practical needs like
studying, sending faxes or making copies.
The tentative plans for the Graduate
Student Community Center include a
ground lloor dedicated mainly to social
activities and an upper lloor for quieter
study-related activities and use hy student
organizations.
The ground floor would feature a cafe
and bar similar to the Coffee House at
1 residder with indoor and outdoor seating
and a large multipurpose room with a TV
and a wood floor for aerobics and dancing.
The upper floor would contain a copier,
fax machine and printer in addition to sev
eral conference rooms and an office for the
GSC. The upper floor would also include a
semiformal lounge for receptions, a sound
proofed children's play room and a TV
lounge and study room.
"We'd like most of the center to be avail
able to grad students 24 hours a day, 7 days
a week. The cafe and bar requires food ser
vice and so would have more limited regular
hours, perhaps noon to 2 a.m.," Marin said.
A source for funding for the project has
not yet been established. In 2000, the cost
of construction was estimated at $4 million.
The project coordinators are hopeful
that University President John Hennessy
and Provost John Etchemendy will make
the center a priority for fundraising by the
Office of Development.
Marin said that the coordinators have al
ready met with Nancy Wells, vice president
of the Office of Development and Tim
Portwood, director of University Cam
paigns, who were both positive about the
feasibility of finding a single major donor
for the project.
