Jack Lambeau is the prodigal son returned home to Lakeland, New York: the Ivy-League educated architectural visionary
brought home to reinvent the dying port town and smooth over its self imposed scars. His friend, Steven Turner is the Brooklyn
born local reporter who will bear witness to the city's successes and failures. Between them come Jack's beautiful fiancee Anne
an artist with secrets of her own - and his undisciplined brother Harris, hired by Jack to remove the suspicious barrels of waste
from Lakeland's broken heart. As the town struggles to find a new identity, these four characters must find their way through
their own unexpected transformations and along the way attempt to answer the questions that plague us all: what is the price ol
loyalty, filially, goodness and love?
