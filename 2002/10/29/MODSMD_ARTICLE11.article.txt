Greek community and others get together for
Spike 8c Jam
About two hundred students gathered at Wilbur Field on Saturday to
enjoy an afternoon of music, food and intense volleyball competition
courtesy of Stanford fraternity and sorority organizations. The Interfra
ternity Council and the Intersorority Councils sponsored and planned
Spike & Jam, the free six-on-six volleyball tournament, as a way of en
hancing student life on campus.
"The success of Spike 8c Jam shows how supportive Greeks are of
their community, and hopefully this will enable us to stage all-Greek
community service efforts," said Naveen Kabir, the president of the ISC.
Eighteen teams competed in the volleyball extravaganza. The teams
included Greek organizations, freshman dorms and other groupings of
friends. Although the tournament welcomed all levels of competitors, it
became increasingly competitive near the end. Team Consin (Jason
Min, David Carlson, Marcelo, Yuri Bukhan and Waasil Kareem) de
feated Kappa Sigma in the nail-biting 32-30 final match.
Spike & Jam is one of a wide variety of events that Greek organiza
tions provide for Stanford students. Greeks coordinate many communi
ty service events like Theta Breakers and the Phi Psi 500 and more so
cial events like concerts, parties and Spike & Jam.
"The Greek community provides a tremendous amount of the ener
gy for both social life and service efforts at Stanford. Spike & Jam was an
enormous success for Stanford because members of fraternities and
sororities at Stanford are committed to improving life on campus," said
Jordan Connors, the president of the IFC.
Longtime Stanford News Service Director Bob
Beyers dies
Robert W. Beyers, who worked as the director of Stanford News Ser
vice for 29 years, died of pancreatic cancer at his home in Palo Alto on
Oct. 18 at the age of 71.
Beyers directed the News Service from 1961 to 1990 and earned a na
tional reputation for his candid reporting. He is noted for shaping a
News Service whose primary purpose was to report on the accomplish
ments of faculty and students.
"Bob Beyers never saw himself as engaged in public relations, always
as a journalist," said Richard W. Lyman, Stanford president emeritus.
"He lived by the highest standards of that profession: unflagging ener
gy, total integrity, insatiable curiosity and unsparing candor."
Philip Taubman, deputy editorial page editor at the New York
Times and editor of The Stanford Daily in 1969, said Beyers was the
best University spokesman in the country during the years he was at
Stanford. "He never flinched from telling the truth, even when it was
embarrassing to Stanford, and the University was always better for
it,"he said.
A service celebrating Beyers' life will be held in Stanford's Memorial
Church on Jan. 6,2003 at 4 p.m. A reception at the Faculty Club will fol
low.

Greek community and others get together for
Spike 8c Jam
About two hundred students gathered at Wilbur Field on Saturday to
enjoy an afternoon of music, food and intense volleyball competition
courtesy of Stanford fraternity and sorority organizations. The Interfra
ternity Council and the Intersorority Councils sponsored and planned
Spike & Jam, the free six-on-six volleyball tournament, as a way of en
hancing student life on campus.
"The success of Spike 8c Jam shows how supportive Greeks are of
their community, and hopefully this will enable us to stage all-Greek
community service efforts," said Naveen Kabir, the president of the ISC.
Eighteen teams competed in the volleyball extravaganza. The teams
included Greek organizations, freshman dorms and other groupings of
friends. Although the tournament welcomed all levels of competitors, it
became increasingly competitive near the end. Team Consin (Jason
Min, David Carlson, Marcelo, Yuri Bukhan and Waasil Kareem) de
feated Kappa Sigma in the nail-biting 32-30 final match.
Spike & Jam is one of a wide variety of events that Greek organiza
tions provide for Stanford students. Greeks coordinate many communi
ty service events like Theta Breakers and the Phi Psi 500 and more so
cial events like concerts, parties and Spike & Jam.
"The Greek community provides a tremendous amount of the ener
gy for both social life and service efforts at Stanford. Spike & Jam was an
enormous success for Stanford because members of fraternities and
sororities at Stanford are committed to improving life on campus," said
Jordan Connors, the president of the IFC.
Longtime Stanford News Service Director Bob
Beyers dies
Robert W. Beyers, who worked as the director of Stanford News Ser
vice for 29 years, died of pancreatic cancer at his home in Palo Alto on
Oct. 18 at the age of 71.
Beyers directed the News Service from 1961 to 1990 and earned a na
tional reputation for his candid reporting. He is noted for shaping a
News Service whose primary purpose was to report on the accomplish
ments of faculty and students.
"Bob Beyers never saw himself as engaged in public relations, always
as a journalist," said Richard W. Lyman, Stanford president emeritus.
"He lived by the highest standards of that profession: unflagging ener
gy, total integrity, insatiable curiosity and unsparing candor."
Philip Taubman, deputy editorial page editor at the New York
Times and editor of The Stanford Daily in 1969, said Beyers was the
best University spokesman in the country during the years he was at
Stanford. "He never flinched from telling the truth, even when it was
embarrassing to Stanford, and the University was always better for
it,"he said.
A service celebrating Beyers' life will be held in Stanford's Memorial
Church on Jan. 6,2003 at 4 p.m. A reception at the Faculty Club will fol
low.
