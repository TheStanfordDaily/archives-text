TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) â€” A
student flunking out of the I' ni
versity of Arizona nursing
school shot three of his profes
sors to death yesterday, then
killed himself as dozens of terri
fied students rushed to get
away.
Police said Robert Mores Jr.,
41, specifically targeted the in
structors, killing one in her of
fice on the second floor and
shooting the others in a fourth
floor classroom as students dove
for cover.
Mores walked to the front of
the classroom and shot the first
victim several times, then went to

the back of the room and killed
the second vic tim, police said.
Senior Julie Raymond said
she was taking an exam when
the gunman came in.
"We just thought that he was
late for the test," Raymond said.
"Then he started talking to in
structors and fired shots. All of
ns ducked under the tables and
then ran out of the room. At
first, I thought it was a joke and
realized it wasn't when I heard
the shots."
Flores told students in the
room to leave. He was later
found dead by officers search
ing the school.
