TACOMA, Wash. (AP) â€” Two suspects
charged in the rash of recent East Coast sniper
attacks were linked by authorities yesterday to
the murder of a Tacoma woman last winter,

17, are suspects in the killing of 21-year-old

gun, while I he pair were staying with him earli
er this year.
Investigators recovered three handguns
and two rifles from the man, including two al
legedly used in the crimes, Tacoma police
spokesman Jim Mattheis said. Ballistics tests
confirmed that both weapons were used in sep
arate shootings, he said.

Muhammad and John Lee Malvo as suspects in

the keenya (look homicide," Brame said.
Mattheis has said ( look's family recognized
Muhammad from news photos after his arrest

divorce and child-custody dispute, officials
said.

fall of 2001 for protection from an abusive
boyfriend. Members of (look's family won
dered if Isa Nichols was the intended target and
that (look was shot by mistake when she
opened the door.
