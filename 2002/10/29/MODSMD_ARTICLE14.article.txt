### 
AMMAN, Jordan (AP) — An
American diplomat was assassinat
ed yesterday in front of his house,
gunned down by eight pistol shots
in the first such targeted attack on a
U.S. diplomat in decades. The
killing appeared aimed at under
mining a key ally increasingly
under pressure as Washington pre
pares lor a showdown with Iraq.
Laurence Foley, a (i()-year-oId
administrator at the U.S. Agency
lor International Development,
was walking to his car when a sin
gle gunman opened lire, police
said. 1 he gunman — and likely ac

complices — escaped.
U.S. and Jordanian officials said
it was too early to tell whether the
attack was terrorist-related. There
were no suspects and no one
claimed responsibility.
A Jordanian police official,
speaking on condition of anonymi
ty, said the killing appeared to
have been carried out by profes
sionals who had been following
Foley for some time to determine
his schedule.
The killing stunned the estimat
ed 3,000-strong American commu
nity in Jordan, which generally con

siders Amman safe, despite occa
sional warnings of security threats.
Security was immediately in
creased at embassies and diplo
matic missions. In an unusual
scene for Amman, red beret-clad
special forces riding jeeps mount
ed with machine-guns escorted
diplomatic vehicles through the
city.
I'lie U.S. Hmbassy warned
Americans to "remain vigilant."
At a news conference, U.S. Am
bassador Edward Gnehm con
demned the shooting as a "cow
ardly, criminal act" but refused to

call it terrorist-related.
Foley, recently honored for 37
years of "superior" service, had
been working on projects to deliv
er clean drinking water and health
care to poor Jordanians and pro
vide loans to small businesses.
His voice breaking several
times, Gnehm described the for
mer Peace Corps volunteer as "a
man who dedicated his life to im
proving the lives of others." He
said Foley's wile, Virginia, recalled
him telling her the night before he
died: "I'm where 1 want to be
doing what I want to do."
