## The 						Stanford Daily LAS master's proposal only the first step in revival 
### 
Published Since IS 1 )I

In submitting a proposal fora new
master's program in Latin American
studies, Anthropological Sciences
Assoc. Prof. Jim Fox is trying to get
the program back to where it should be.
Last year, both the undergraduate and
graduate degree programs ended due to a
lack of faculty support. This situation must
be remedied, and LAS ought to be rebuilt
and strengthened to ensure that students
and faculty alike can continue to pursue
study in this area.
We urge Sharon Long, Dean of Human
ities and Sciences, and the Faculty Senate to
approve the master's degree proposal so
that LAS can grow into the thriving center
for studies in Latin America that it should
be and begin accepting graduate students
next year.
The reinstitution is a solid step forward,

but by no means has the program reached
the finish line.
The Center for Latin American Studies
has been instrumental in bringing world
renowned scholars, activists and journal
ists to campus from various regions in
cluding current visiting Columbian schol
ar Alfredo Molano.
Stanford's resources and location could
help make it one of the leading LAS centers
in the country. But in order for CI AS to con
tinue to thrive, lAS needs a base of students
for these scholars to mentor.
Furthermore, because a majority of stu
dents have studied Spanish in high school, it
is reasonable to assume that issues pertain
ing to Latin America are relevant to many
on campus.
CLAS's new student resource center will
help create this base by providing support

for students. When the degree programs
were revoked last year, students organized
to resist this action. 1 he negative reactions
by many students during the program's
demise further reiterates the demand for
LAS on Stanford's campus.
The fact that there was not enough facul
ty support to sustain this program may hint
at faculty diversity issues at the University.
It becomes even more important now, as
the recently announced University budget
cuts begin to take affect, that faculty diversi
fication is not put on the backburner.
LAS acts as a prime example of what can
happen to a department when faculty in
terest dwindles and no new faculty is
brought in to compensate for that apparent
lack of interest.
Prof. Fox has done an admirable job of
bringing together faculty from a variety of

departments to help sustain the program
and provide students with the support
they need.
The Faculty Senate should quickly ap
prove the master's degree proposal so that
staff can start to bring back the LAS bache
lor's degree and move forward in rebuild
ing the program.
This year's graduating seniors should
have the opportunity to apply for the mas
ter's program and a rapid response on the
part of the Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences as well as the Faculty Senate is nec
essary to ensure seniors have the time to
prepare and apply for this program.
Moreover, promoting LAS also speaks
to the University's support for cultural di
versity on campus and will hopefully at
tract more culturally and politically di
verse faculty.
