# TALES FROM UNDERCLASS
## Cali offers no stress relief 
### 
I seem to have lost the ability to
manage my time since I got to col
lege. 1 could always do it in high
school, hut here 1 just can't get it
together. A paper isn't due fora week;
therefore, the appropriate course of ac
tion is to spend six days sharpening my
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 skills, and
then on the seventh day finding the
cheapest price on a case of Red Bull, so
I can pull an all-nighter and finish the
paper. What happened to me?
What's really going on in my head is
that I'm still an overstressed New York
er at heart. I'm so paralyzed by fear
that 1 won't get all my work done that I
just haven't been doing my work.
Instead, I've been surfing the web,
hanging out, sleeping late, chatting on

AOL Instant Messenger
(obviously an evil Com
munist plot to kill all
semblance of American
productivity) and gen
erally wasting my days
away while the work
piles up.
And now it's Sunday
night, before the start

of my most stressful week of college so
far, and I have a column I'm not happy
with, a paper I haven't started, a
midterm given by a sadistic ex-marine
I'm not prepared for, and 300 pages of
I-Hum reading I've barely scratched
the surface of. So excuse me if my rant
ing this week is a little disjointed — I'm
a little stressed.
I should be able to cope with this
stress. I should be used to it. This was
what high school was all about, but il
really did come a lot easier and maybe
I'm having issues because for the first
time in my life, I'm taking challenging
classes, and I can't suck up to the teach
er for bonus points.
I should be able to just hunker down
and do the work. I know I won't lei my
self hand in a paper late, or fail a
midterm, but is this really the right way
to go about it?
I guess this is the week I learn that
I'm going to need to reevaluate how I
spend my time at college. I have ( lass
es everyday from 9 a.m. to around
noon. I don't go to bed until 2 a.m. So
I'm exhausted during my classes,
sleep through my lectures, and am to
tally incapacitated for the rest of the
day.
By the time I'm fully awake, it's time
to be social in the dorm, and I'm having
so much fun that I can't rip myself away
and go to the library.
I still haven't found a place that makes
me feel like doing work. Back home, it
was the reading room of the central
branch of the New York Public Library.
If it wasn't for that room, I probably
wouldn't have submitted a paper to the
Intel Science Talent Search.

In lieu of a transition between the
previous paragraph, and the next
paragraph, I will take this space to let
out a scream and hopefully destress a
little. Observe: aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh
hhhli! Thanks for bearing with me.
I came to California to try to loosen
up, to lose the New York edge. I went
to a high school that was so competitive
that if we had ranked students by
G.P.A., there would be regular assassi
nation attempts in the upper echelon
of the student body.
I didn't want or need that. But it
seems like I haven't figured out how to
balance the California mellowness
with my New York sense of time, and
instead I spend all my time chilling
out, and worrying about the work I
should be doing.
A month into college, and we all
seem to be getting stupider. I find my
self losing the ability to properly con
jugate verbs. A few days ago, a friend
asked me to help him edit a paper.
He'd been up until 3 a.m. writing it —
at which point his computer crashed
and took the paper with it.
So he'd been up since then rewriting it,
taking l()-minute naps on the hour to stay
"foc used." Alter about an hour of editing,
neither of us could even form full sentences
and ended up breaking down laughing
every time we noticed a new rhetorical flaw
in the paper.
Not that 1 was much better off. I
hadn't gotten any sleep either but not
for any particular reason. I'm mostly
worried about the opportunity cost of
going to sleep.
There's so much you might miss
when you go to bed. So many "in-jokes"
you might never understand. So much
fodder for breakfast conversations you
can't participate in (not that I've seen the
breakfast table on a weekday since ( lass
es started).
And the worst part is when you go to
sleep, you can hear the voices in the hall,
and you think to yourself — "They
might be having fun."
It's been an emotional, tumultuous
week. I'm still alive. I still think I'll
make all my deadlines, but just barely.
Thanks to my lack of foresight, while
everyone is off at Flic ks getting their
pants scared off by "Signs," I'm here
trying to polish I his column before the
turn of the hour so I can start on my
PWR paper.
My older and wiser college friends
tell me, "College is all about procrasti
nating and then doing everything at
the last minute."
They tell me, "You'll get used to it
eventually."
I hope they're right.
