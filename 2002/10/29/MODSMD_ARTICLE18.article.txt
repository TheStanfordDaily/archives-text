South Asians 'are equally Asian'
1 almost responded when I saw Bryan
Choi's letter to The Daily last week after
Full Moon on the Quad, but now this has
really gone too far.
I'd like (Ihoi and Phil Norton to pull out
an atlas and see that the continent of Asia
extends beyond China, Japan, Korea and
all the other Last Asian countries usually as
sociated with "Asian-American."
India, Cambodia, Nepal and Sri Lanka
are all part of the continent as well, and are
equally Asian. Before we berate The Daily
for not running any photos of Asian males
on the Full Moon feature, let's look at the
spread and see that there were TWC) South
Asian men pictured. South Asians and
Southeast Asians are Asian too.

Stanford 'has no obligation to give
Baraka a podium'
Adrienne Hurley writes in defense of
Baraka and suggests that far from being
anti-Semitic, Baraka's thoughts that the
events at the World Trade Center were
staged to promote anti-Islamic sentiment
ought to be explored.
While 1 Im Icy and Baraka may both get
"A's" lor creativity, all reasonable evidence
suggests that the perpetrators of the World
Trade Center and Pentagon bombings
were Saudi and Egyptian Muslim Arabs. A
public debate would add little to our knowl
edge of who the Sept. 11 terrorists were.
We already know who they are.
Furthermore, while I am pleased that
Baraka is not a Holocaust denier, his out
landish statements made this Jewish alum
nus feel isolated, attacked and abandoned

by the student body, the administration
and by The Stanford Daily. All of the above
offered tepid or no support for Jews who
endured extremely offensive speech.
Fortunately, Jews at Stanford have not
yet encountered physical attacks that have
occurred at Berkeley, C Concordia and other
universities. Perhaps the occurrence of
such violence should tip off the campus that
more is involved here than mere "free
speech."
11urley's comment that Jews should not
be "conflated" with Israel, because, pre
sumably, there are still some "good Jews" is
patronizing and insulting. Are there not
also five million good Israelis, most of them
Jews like myself? Are their opinions, lives
and history no longer worth talking about?
President 1 lennessy wrote a letter to
The Stanford Daily, upholding the right of
free speech, and I also support that right
for Baraka. 1 lowever, supporting his right
to utter falsehoods should not usurp truth,
nor prevent legitimate scholars from point
ing out that the emperor does not, in fact,
have any clothes. Finally, Stanford has no
obligation to give him a podium.

'War is not justified for the
developed Western world'
Alan Isenberg in his column "Feeding
Crocodiles" dismisses the question I asked
former Israeli Prime Minister Fluid Barak
— one all of us would do well to think
about. "Why not a peaceful solution to com
bat terrorism?" Mr. Isenberg argues that
nonviolence is for the weak, not for West
ern powers attempting to destroy terrorism
from a position of strength. Such an argu
ment is frighteningly similar in its likening
of Western powers to "a stronger race, a
higher-grade race, a more worldly wise

race to put it that way, [that] has come in
and taken their place" to quote Winston
Churchill at the height of imperialism in
1937.
War is not justified for the developed
Western world or for any other country, for
that matter. It is the ultimate violation of
human rights and erodes the very freedom
it claims to fight for. Consider the "War
against Terrorism;" Terrorism by defini
tion instills in innocent people fear for their
livelihood and security.
Mow different is the action of a nation
that goes to war, no matter how "just" the
cause.-' St. Augustine tells the story of a pi
rate captured by Alexander the Great, who
asked him "how he dares molest the sea."
"How dare you molest the whole
world?" the pirate replied, "because I do it
with a little ship only, 1 am called a thief;
you, doing it with a great navy, are called an
Emperor."
Pirate or Emperor, neither has the right
to terrorize nations, threaten world peace
and violate basic human freedoms. No
country can afford to forget that it shares the
same humanity as its neighbors. By identi
fying the "enemy" as an individual who de
cides to hate it in a certain way, it declares
war not only on the other, but also on itself.
In the words of cartoonist Walt Kelly,
"We have met the enemy, and he is us."
U.S. Senator Trent Lott condemned
former U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan's efforts at diplomacy with a
certain country head as "seeking to
cultivate a human relationship with a
mass murderer."
(iould not the same description be used
on any country using weapons of mass de
struction? What makes one more human
than the other? We are all part of a society
that would benefit from the just and peace
ful coexistence of its members.
The death and destruction caused by
war will not take us any closer to that, it will
only accelerate the cycle of violence, re
venge and retribution.
Ehud Barak responded to my question
bysaying"it took two hands to clap." Are we
willing to be (he first hand — to break the
cycle of violence?
I he United Nations has affirmed "the
dignity and worth of the human person"
and is determined to promote social
standards and better standards of life in

larger freedom."
Every person in every nation lias the
right to freedom from military aggres
sion. It is a question we need to ask our
selves, "Why is it so easy for us to be will
ing to pick up arms and risk our lives,
and so difficult to put down those same
weapons and still risk our lives — in the
cause of life?" (Ramzi Kysia)
Far from shifting blame to any nation or
head of state, it is our collective responsibil
ity to be passionately committed to, and to
speak out for the fundamental rights of all
people everywhere.
