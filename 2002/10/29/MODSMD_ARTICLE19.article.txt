## Pakistan's support of terrorism prevents peace with India 
### ARVIND KUMAR GUEST COLUMNIST 
India's recent decision with regard to
the withdrawal of troops from the
India-Pakistan border has renewed the
debate among the strategic community on
the future of India-Pakistan relations.
Some have welcomed India's decision and
suggested that India should also resume di
alogue on pertinent themes, including the
Kashmir issue. Others argued that India
should wait and watch until an elected and
democratic regime is in place in Pakistan.
The Dec. 13 attack against India's Par
liament building by two Pakistan-based ter
rorist groups, the Lishkar-e-Tayyaba and
the Jaish-e-Mohammed, prompted and
provoked India to mobilize and build up
military troops across the Indo-Pak border.
Pakistan followed suit, and both countries'
armies were on the verge of escalating a
full-fledged war. The intensity of the crisis
was so severe and grave that the interna
tional community, in general, and the Unit
ed States, in particular, were concerned
that a conventional war between India and
Pakistan could erupt. Authorities in Pak
istan made a number of statements signal
ing that nuclear weapons might be used
during such an eventuality.
The fear that a conventional war could

escalate into a nuclear war led many coun
tries to urge the departure of their nation
als (hiring May and J line this year. The mil
itary build-up by India and Pakistan across
tlicir mutual border continued lor more
than 10 months. The coercive diplomacy,
compellence strategy and the U.S.
brinkmanship played a dominant role in
averting the worst feared crisis. However,
current milieu and conditions across the
border are still tense.
In addition to military build-up across
the Indo-Pak border, India took a number
of other initiatives, including recalling its
high commissioner from Islamabad, termi
nating the Delhi-Lahore bus and train ser
vices and canceling over-flight facilities to
Pakistan and Pakistan Airlines. India also
handed over to Pakistan a list of 20 112 ugitives
and asked that they be apprehended and
handed over so that they could be brought
to justice for the crimes committed in the
country. As of now, Pakistan has not taken
any steps in handing over those fugitives.
The recent crisis originated from cross
border terrorism. India's demand from
Pakistan to contain cross-border terrorism
seems to be widely accepted among the
members of the international community.
The U.S. has pressured Pakistan to stop its
support of these activities. The
widespread international consensus today

is that there is 110 justification lor terror
ism, which must be eradicated wherever it
exists. India is determined to take all nec
essary steps to preserve its security and ter
ritorial integrity, and will resist terrorism
until it is decisively crushed.
India has made it clear that the with
drawal of troops in the existing circum
stances has been only from the internation
al border including parts ofjammu, Punjab
and Rajasthan. The high level of alert 011
the Line of Control in Janmiu and Kash
mir, however, would continue. Operation
Parakaram, the code name given to the mo
bilization of troops after the Dec. 1 3 terror
ist attack on India's Parliament has been
partially successful because it helped in get
ting the international community suffi
ciently alarmed enough to pressure Pak
istan into moderating its behavior.
Pakistan will, however, continue to pose
a threat to India's security in the future also.
Its traditional hostility and single-minded
aim of keeping India destabilized is not fo
cused just on Kashmir but on a search for
parity. Pakistan has been waging a proxy
war against India for more than two
decades. Pakistan's weapons acquisitions
112 rom the West and China, and its close col
laboration with China and North Korea 011
nuclear and missile matters, will continue to
be of grave concern to India.

Pakistan has also announced that it will
withdraw its forces in response to the Indi
an decision. However, Pakistan's earlier
commitment on containing cross-border
terrorism is yet to be fulfilled.
President Gen. Musharrafs pro
claimed desire to talk to India cannot be
achieved unless and until the cross-border
terrorism is absolutely contained. In Jan
uary 2002, Pakistan stated that it would
not allow its territory to be used for terror
ism anywhere in the world. In reality, Pak
istan has not been able to do any concrete
things with regard to containing cross bor
der terrorism. There is certainly a lack of
consistency between rhetoric and action
on the part of Pakistan.
'Hie onus lies 011 Pakistan again in the
current prevailing circumstances in the In
dian subcontinent. Pakistan must hand
over all those 20 fugitives, which India has
been asking for since December 2001.
In addition to lighting the global war on
terrorism, Pakistan should dismantle all of
the existing terrorist groups on Pakistani
soil, shun all of the fundamentalists, and
stop giving shelter to the members of the
terrorist groups. A recent phenomenon is
the mushrooming of pan-Islamist militant
outfits with links to radical organizations in
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and some
other West Asian countries. The man be

hind the 1992 major terrorist act in Mum
bai, India, has been given protection in Pak
istan by the authorities. Pakistan can only
light the global war on terrorism, in the
true sense of the term, if it would be able to
eradicate all the existing evils in the form of
terrorists on its soil.
Undoubtedly, the pullback provides
both sides a number of opportunities in
cluding the resumption of bilateral dia
logue on the matters affecting their rela
tionships. The politico-diplomatic strategy
warrants both sides to create a peaceful at
mosphere in the region.
The era of coercive diplomacy is over
now. The compellence strategy can still
work, and the U.S. brinkmanship has cer
tainly a dominant role to play. The U.S., to
a greater extent, helped in averting the
crisis and put pressure on Pakistan consis
tently for containing cross-border terror
ism. The cross-border terrorism as Pak
istan's state policy must be abandoned in
its own interest.
