Borrowing Irom their experi
ences as leaders in the field of high
er education, former University
Presidents (lei hard Casper,
Richard Lyman and Donald
Kennedy are speaking this quarter
in a seminar series organized by the
School of Education to foster discus
sion Ix'tween education researchers
and top-level administrators.
I he seminar is sponsored by the
Stanford Institute for I ligher Edu
cation Research and the National
Center for Post secondary Improve
ment, headquartered at Stanford.
SI 11ER organizes monthly sem
inars, which aim to "provide an in
formal forum for invited guests to
engage discussion with those inter
ested in research in higher educa
tion," said Patricia Gumport, direc
tor of SI lIER and executive direc
tor ofNCPI. "Guests typically pre
sent research in progress or often
bring expertise from selected are
nas of higher education policy and
practice."
Casper, the University's ninth
president, began the series last
month with a seminar that provid
ed an opportunity for those doing
research in higher education to
talk about how that work can be in
formed by and in turn support
university administ rat ion,
Gumport said.
About 2f> people attended the
seminar, held ()ct. 1.
"[Casper] offered a very
thoughtful perspective 011 the na
ture of academic change — the
conditions that both facilitated and
constrained several of his initiatives
during his administration at Stan
ford," (Jumport said.
Many of Casper's initiatives as
president dealt with advancing the
quality of linelergrach tate education.
"This is genuinely distinctive,
because it is unusual fora research
university president to make such

academic initiatives .1 priority,"
Gumport said. "Mv impression is
that lie gave the academic arena a
considerable amount of attention,
and he left his mark there as well."
According to Blake Naughton.a
second year doctoral candidate
serving as the coordinator for the
seminars, the School of Education
chose to have the former presidents
speak at this time because of their
experiences and the reflections
they can present as former leaders
of the University.
"They have weathered fiscal
crises, intense student unrest and
political battles, all while steeringan
immense international research
university," Naughton said.
Typical attendance at these sem
inars includes graduate students,
School of Education faculty and re
search associates from places like
the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching who are
interested in hearing from the lead
ing researchers and practitioners in
the field of higher education.
"It was a very interesting semi
nar," Cin 111 port said of this month's
seminar. "Gerhard Casper was ex
tremely insightful. And he spoke
with candor and humor. The par
ticipants were delighted to be able
to engage with him in this way."
Lyman, who is scheduled to
speak Nov. 5, said that he does not
plan to discuss his entire 10 years as
the University's seventh
president — instead, he will focus
mainly on the campus unrest of late
'60s and the early '70s and how it is
related to the University's substan
tial rise in prestige between the late
1950s and the present.
"How higher education can re
tain its role in education as opposed
to vocationally-related training is
the most important question of this
era, it seems to me," fie said.
Naughton will lie meeting with
Kennedy soon to discuss t he points of
his seminar, which will be on Dec. 3.
