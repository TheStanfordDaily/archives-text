"[Our bodies] were broken down from training, but
t he meet helped us see what we need to work on and
improve in practice," senior Randall Bal said. "We
were a little sluggish on turns, and in general, the
coaches thought that we needed to get our legs in bet
ter shape."
Each swimmer competed in four events. Though
the meet was long and did not follow traditional dual
meet format, the Cardinal men started strong and
never let up, scoring their first win in the 200-yard
medley relay over Pacific with a time of 1 minute,
33.07 seconds.
Then junior Markus Rogan clocked a time of
3:53.99, while sophomore teammate Dan Trupin
touched second in 4:02.27 to finish first and second, re
spectively, in the 400-yard individual medley.
In addition to a third-place finish in the 100-yard
backstroke, senior Dan Westcotttook second in the 100-
yard fly, clocking in at 50.04. Touching close behind,
sophomore Jayme Cramer grabbed third in 50.35.
"These guys were right about where we thought
they would be on Saturday, though the freshmen ex
ceeded our expectations," head coach Skip Kenney
said. "Since [California] did not compete, we really
didn't have the opportunity to measure ourselves
against our toughest competition."

Senior John Waters won the 200-yard freestyle,
turning in a time of 1:40.19. In the 100-yard breast
stroke, junior Michael Bruce, the team's top breast
stroker, touched second in 56.80, while Trupin fin
ished third (58.64).
Hal breezed through a successful day, capturing a
win in the 100-yard backstroke in 49.57. Junior Peter
Marshall and Westcott completed the 1-2-3 Stanford
sweep in the event, finishing in 49.86 and 50.22, re
spectively.
The Cardinal team then seized its second relay vic
tory of the day, clocking a (5:42.27 in the 800-yard
freestyle relay. The men followed that win with their
second 1-2-3 sweep, this time in the 200-yard fly.
Cramer, sophomore Matt McDonald and Bruce took
the top three spots in 1:51.03, 1:52.75 and 1:52.93,
respectively.
After winning his second event of the day, the 100-
yard free (45.55), Bal looked on as Bruce captured his
first victory. Bruce finished first in the 200-yard breast
in 2:01.99. Sophomore Thomas Brown placed third in
the event in 2:08.38.
In the 200-yard backstroke, the team once again

swept the top three spots, as junior Matt Sorlien
clocked the top time in 1:47.92, just one second off of
his fastest time from last year. Bal (1:51.49) and
freshman Tobias Oriwal (1:51.67) rounded out the
top three.
Asa freshman, Oriwal enjoyed his first taste of colle
giate competition.
"I've never been part of a team this big, and this
meet was a good start to get the feel of'things," Oriwal
said. "Considering all of the work that we have been
doing, we did a pretty good job. But I know that as we
focus on getting stronger and faster, we will only get
better in the water."
Following its successful individual finishes, the Car
dinal went on to win the final event, the 400-yard
freestyle relay, touching ahead of its closest competi
tion, BYU, in a time 0f3:03.27.
Bal, who capped off his day with 70 points, finished
first in the individual point standings. Bruce scored 66
points to finish second, with junior Bobby O'Bryan,
Trupin and Rogan following in third, fourth and fifth.

respectively.
Aside from the Cal Double Dis
tance Meet in late November, the Pa
cific meet was basically the team's
only opportunity to test the waters
lx*fbre the start of regular dual-meet
competition in January. According to
Rogan, the team tried to add an ad
ditional invitational meet to its sched
ule, but the Stanford administration
nixed the idea because the meet falls
duiing dead week. Rogan expressed
concern for the University's dedica
tion to the swimming program.
"It's ironic to say that they arc
committed to the best athletics in
the country yet they block us from
competition," Rogan said. " The
team, especially the freshmen,
needs the experience in the water,
but the administration will not let
us compete at this important point
in our training. I'm really question
ing what it means for the Universi
ty to win a national championship."
