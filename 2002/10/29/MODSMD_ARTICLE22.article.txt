# Women roll to wins up north

### MATT BABIN STAFF WRITER 
When you're the top-ranked
team in the nation, everyone else is
gunning for you. Every other team
in the nation wants to prove that
you're over-ranked, that you're
beatable, t hat you're not as good as
you're cracked up to be. So if
you're the Stanford women's soc
cer team, which traveled to Wash
ington for two Pacific-10 Confer
ence games on the road last week
end, what do you do?

Simple. You just keep winning.
The Cardinal returned home
with two more Pac-10 wins after
its latest road trip, running its sea
son record to 15-1-0 (6-0-0 Pac
-10). The squad defeated Wash
ington State 1-0 Friday night be
fore beating Washington by the
same score Sunday afternoon.
While two shutouts — which
brought the season total to 13 —
on the road are admirable. What
is even more impressive is that the
Cardinal has yet to allow a goal in
conference play.
While the usually explosive
Stanford offensive was held to one
goal in both games this past week
end, that was all the help that red
shirt sophomore keeper Nicole
Barnhart and the Cardinal de
fense needed.
The first goal of the weekend
came off of the foot of junior strik
er Marcie Ward, who took a touch
pass from senior Mart ia Wallisand
beat the Cougar keeper for the
only goal of the game in the 29th
minute. It was Ward's eighth goal
on the season.
"[Freshman defender] Lindsay
[Hunt] played a great through ball
on the ground to Marcia's feet, and
I made a diagonal run behind her
and just yelled to | Mania to| leave
the ball," Ward said.
"Marcia let il go through, and it
came perfectly to tne. 1 was already
in behind the defense, so it was me
and the goalie. I just dribbled with

speed at the goalie, she came out
and I slipped the ball past heron
the ground."
The goal may have seemed a
long time coming for Ward, who
fired 15 shots against Oregon and
Oregon State last weekend but
came away with nothing to show
for her effort.
"It was important for the team
and my own individual confidence
to score," Ward said. " The team
didn't need me to score last week
end, but it was very frustrating to
have many opportunities and not
see them go in. This weekend I

tried to forget about them and
make the most of every opportuni
ty. The goal against [the Cougars]
proved to be very beneficial to the
game and to my own confidence."
Ward proved to be instrumen
tal in tallying the second goal of the
weekend on Sunday as well. Ju
nior defender Natalie Spilger
passed the ball to Ward in the 38th
minute, giving her an open look
about five yards outside the penal
ty area.
"I could have shot," Ward said,

Senior forward Morcia Wallis goes up against Oregon a week and a half
ago. Wallis and the women's soccer team swept Washington and Wash
ington State this weekend with 1 -0 victories over both teams.
"but [Washington goalie] Hope
[Solo] is an amazing keeper, and
my best option was to pass to Mar
cia, who made an overlapping run
to my left."
Wallis received the pass and
fired a hard shot at Solo, who de
flected the shot with her fingertips
to Stanford freshman striker Jen
nifer Farenbaugh. Farenbaugh
took the shot from 10 yards out
and buried it in the back of the net.
"Marcia shot it at the left far
post," Ward said. "Hope Solo got
her fingers on it and knocked it
down. Biggie [Farenbaugh] was in
the perfect position to follow up."
Farenbaugh added: "1 just
happened to be in the right place
at the right time. Marcia Wallis
took a great shot 112 rom the left side
of the field, and their goalie
tipped the ball, but was unable to
control it. 1 was running in fora
cross and happened to get there

bound and put it in."
When ilit' loam left for Washing
ton, it was uncertain il Farenbaugh
would even be allowed to play. As a
result of hand surgery, the fresh
man striker is still in a soft-cast.
"My hand feels good, but I still
have a while to go before I will be
at 100 percent," Farenbaugh said.
"I'm just happy to be back."
file Cardinal will be happy to
be back in the Bay Area, where it
plays the final three games on its
schedule, including a tough awa\
game against California. I hough
the team leads the conference
going into the final three games,
no one on the Stanford roster is
looking ahead.
"We have much more confi
dence this year as a team. We de
serve to," Ward said. "We have
much more depth this year, and
everybody has just stepped it up.
We have fun everytinie we step
onto the field.
"But we still have three games,
which is essentially the same posi
tion we were in last year. We have
to take them one game at a time."
