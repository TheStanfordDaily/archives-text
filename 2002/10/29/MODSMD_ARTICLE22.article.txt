# Women roll to wins up north

### MATT BABIN STAFF WRITER 
When you're the top-ranked
team in the nation, everyone else is
gunning for you. Every other team
in the nation wants to prove that
you're over-ranked, that you're
beatable, t hat you're not as good as
you're cracked up to be. So if
you're the Stanford women's soc
cer team, which traveled to Wash
ington for two Pacific-10 Confer
ence games on the road last week
end, what do you do?

Simple. You just keep winning.
The Cardinal returned home
with two more Pac-10 wins after
its latest road trip, running its sea
son record to 15-1-0 (6-0-0 Pac
-10). The squad defeated Wash
ington State 1-0 Friday night be
fore beating Washington by the
same score Sunday afternoon.
While two shutouts — which
brought the season total to 13 —
on the road are admirable. What
is even more impressive is that the
Cardinal has yet to allow a goal in
conference play.
While the usually explosive
Stanford offensive was held to one
goal in both games this past week
end, that was all the help that red
shirt sophomore keeper Nicole
Barnhart and the Cardinal de
fense needed.
The first goal of the weekend
came off of the foot of junior strik
er Marcie Ward, who took a touch
pass from senior Mart ia Wallisand
beat the Cougar keeper for the
only goal of the game in the 29th
minute. It was Ward's eighth goal
on the season.
"[Freshman defender] Lindsay
[Hunt] played a great through ball
on the ground to Marcia's feet, and
I made a diagonal run behind her
and just yelled to | Mania to| leave
the ball," Ward said.
"Marcia let il go through, and it
came perfectly to tne. 1 was already
in behind the defense, so it was me
and the goalie. I just dribbled with

speed at the goalie, she came out
and I slipped the ball past heron
the ground."
The goal may have seemed a
long time coming for Ward, who
fired 15 shots against Oregon and
Oregon State last weekend but
came away with nothing to show
for her effort.
"It was important for the team
and my own individual confidence
to score," Ward said. " The team
didn't need me to score last week
end, but it was very frustrating to
have many opportunities and not
see them go in. This weekend I

tried to forget about them and
make the most of every opportuni
ty. The goal against [the Cougars]
proved to be very beneficial to the
game and to my own confidence."
Ward proved to be instrumen
tal in tallying the second goal of the
weekend on Sunday as well. Ju
nior defender Natalie Spilger
passed the ball to Ward in the 38th
minute, giving her an open look
about five yards outside the penal
ty area.
"I could have shot," Ward said,
