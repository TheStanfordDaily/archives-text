pairs races

The conditions were ideal for the regattas, sunny
with a stabilizing headwind. Lake Natoma also
helped out with a coxswain-friendly course. The 5-
kilometer course (3.1 miles) followed three easy
bends and ended with a 2-kilometer straightaway to
the finish line.
The pairs competit ion started the full day of races.
The men set out in five pairs and a four, while the
women raced in three pairs and a four. In the men's
pairs, Stanford took first through fifth place with ju
nior Jamie Schroeder and senior Stuart Scollay fin
ishing first.
In the women's pairs race, Stanford placed first,
fourth and seventh out of 10 boats, led by senior cap
tain Sabrina Kolker and junior Melissa Haury, who
started as the third pair in the lineup and passed two
boats to win.
Kolker described the race as a fun way for the low
ers to test themselves in a pair for the first time this fall.
"We thought it would be fun to give it a try in a rac
ing situation," Kolker said.
Kolker and Haury decided not to hold a high
stroke rate, preferring to concentrate on the feel of
the boat. According to Kolker, within 20 strokes of the
20-minute race, they began passing other boats and
were bearing down on the lead pair.
"Melissa said she could see the Cal boat that start
ed first, and if we closed in on them, we knew it would
be a win in our favor," Kolker said.
Kolker and Haury went on to win the event with a
time of 20 minutes, 37 seconds, a full
36 seconds ahead of the Cal boat.
The men's and women's fours
placed third and fifth, respectively.
Both men and women raced in
the eights shortly after finishing in
the pairs and fours.
Men's head coach Craig
Amerkhanian said that having the
pairs race before the eights
helped the rowers.
"A lot of them said it was a good

warm-up," Amerkhanian said. " The
eights felt super stable after t he pairs."
The rowers seemed to agree.
Stanford men's varsity A boat
started first in the lineup and
pushed back an early challenge
by Davis' A boat. Amerkhanian
said that the opposition by the
Aggies early in the race helped
energize the rowers.
"They told me Davis had
crowded them, that Davis got right
on them," Amerkhanian said.
But Stanford simply pushed
away from its challengers.
"They just walked the whole
way, immediately, in the first two

minutes," Amerkhanian said of
the Stanford A boat.
T he Cardinal increased its lead
throughout the race, ultimately
beating Davis by 36 seconds with a
time of 15:48. Stanford's B boat
came in third with a time of 16:21.
"The really good news was that
our Bboat was only nine seconds off
the Davis A boat. That's a really big
tiling Ibr us," Amerkhanian said.
In the women's varsity race, Stan
l< )i (1A started second, 10 seconds be
hind Cal, and began gaining on the
other team from the starting line,
pulling even with the lead boat by
the halfway mark.
