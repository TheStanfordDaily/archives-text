# Soccer falls to rival California
## 
### JIMMY WU STAFF WRITER 
In the game of soccer, being
close is not good enough.
In an 15-minute span on Satur
day, the No. 7 Cardinal men's soc
cer team (11-3-1, Pacific-10 Con
ference 2-2-1) saw its chances of re
peating this year as Pac-10 cham
pions slowly dwindle away, as the
California defense managed to
survive a four-shot onslaught by
the Stanford offense and defeated
the Cardinal 1-0.
With the score tied at 0-0 in its
match against the No. 15 Golden
Bears (11-3-1, 4-1-0), Stanford se
nior midfielder Johanes' Maliza
started the Cardinal onslaught
with a shot in front of the goal that
was saved by Cal keeper Josh
Saunders at the 22-minute mark.
Only 60 seconds later, All-
American senior forward Roger
Levesque blasted a shot directly in
front of the Cal net, but again
Saunders saved the day. Then, five
minutes later, sophomore forward
Matt Janus/, shot a ball that skid
ded across Cal's goal area. A fourth
shot eight minutes later by fresh
man Kevin Coyne, again in front
of the Cal goal, resulted in another
save for Saunders.
Stanford later regretted those
missed chances, as the Golden
Hears eventually capitalized on
one of its three opportunities in
the 42nd minute.
The Golden Bears had just won
a free kick, and Cal sophomore
Noah Merl placed the ball right
where teammate Troy Roberts
could get his head on it for his first
goal of the season.
To the delight of Cal head
coach Kevin Grimes, his team sur
vived a goal by Stanford sopho
more midfielder James Twell
man, which was nullified by an
offside call, and a Levesque head
er on goal in the second half. The
Bears' tenons 1-0 lead held up for
t he rest of the game, giving (lal its
first victory over Stanford since
1996.
"The players looked at this
game like any other game,"
Grimes said. "We didn't try to
treat it as anything extra special.

[The win] didn't surprise me and
it certainly didn't surprise the
players."
Roberts certainly agreed with
his coach's assessment.
"The win feels good," he
said. "It's definitely a confi
dence booster. We went into
this game thinking we could
win it. We performed, executed
and put the pressure on. It def
initely felt good."
On the other side of the coin,
Stanford head coach Bret Simon
was disappointed with the loss but
knew that the game was definitely
there for his team to win.

"We were right around the goal
almost the entire game," Simon
said. "We played well enough to
win, but Cal is a good team."
Unfortunately for Stanford, a
loss is a loss, and this defeat partic
ularly hurt because it further dis
tanced the Cardinal from its archri
val in the Pac-10 standings.
With two losses and a tie in
three conference games in the last
two weekends, Stanford stands at
2-2-1, resulting in seven points
and an unfavorable third-place
position. UCLA and Cal, the two
Pac-10 teams who have defeated
Stanford, are atop the standings
with 15 and 12 points, respective
ly. ()regon State follows the Cardi
