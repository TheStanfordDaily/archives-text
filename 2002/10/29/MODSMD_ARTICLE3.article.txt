# Less vocal but still present, pro-war students form a...
## Silent Minority 
### ALEX BLEYLEBEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Editors Note: This article is the fifth in a weekly se
ries investigating the relationship between the Stan
ford community and the potential rear in Iraq.

In a fall quarter that has been marked by
numerous rallies, teach-ins, flyers and many
other forms of protest against a war on Iraq,
strong sentiment in support of a war has been
all but invisible. According to a poll published
in last week's Stanford Review, only 14 per
cent of Stanford students support military ac
tion to oust Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
While most seem to agree that a majority of
the Stanford community is opposed to war,
war supporters disagree that the divide is as
overwhelming as the Review's poll or campus
activism would indicate.
Sophomore Joe Fairbanks, president of
the Stanford College Republicans, pointed
to flaws in the poll, the lac k of conservative
organizations on campus until the beginning
of this year, and a large number of undecid
ed students as factors that have overshad
owed a significant group of war supporters
on campus.
" The campus is not overwhelmingly anti
war, and 1 think that the majority of students
do not know whether they support it or not,"
he said. "I'd probably say that maybe a tiny
majority are opposed to it, with the others split

between supporting it and not knowing."
While many would disagree that the debate
is so even-handed, pro-war students do con
tend that they make up a significant, albeit
less-vocal group on campus.
"In many ways I feel less in a minority on an
issue like the war on Iraq because the protests
on campus have such a tinge of desperation,"
said senior Henry Towsner, a registered De
mocrat on the "libertarian side of the spec
trum" who was also last year's editor of The

Stanford Review. " The people here don't
speak for many other people in the country."
Towsner said he thought the anti-war
image of campus is created by a minority of
passionate liberal students.
Seventy-four percent of students polled by

military action in Iraq. I hese numbers con

Despite vocal objection for war in Iraq, pro-war students say that a substantial minority favors such action
that show a majority of Americans
would support military action in
Iraq.
Pro-war students indicated they
would support military action fora
variety of reasons, including na
tional defense, the ousting of an in
humane dictator, access to oil and
the prevention of future instability
in the Middle East.
Students differed in opinion
about whether they thought
Hussein would realistically use
future nuclear capabilities to di
rectly attack the United States,
but most felt strongly that he
should be kept from acquiring
this capability.
"I don't think it's highly likely
that Saddam will threaten the
U.S. mainland directly — but un
likely does not mean impossible,"
said second year Electrical Engi
neering doctoral student Balaji
Srinivasan, who considers himself
a "neo-libertarian."
Srinivasan, a strong opponent
of President George W. Bush's
domestic policy who expressed
doubts about Bush's faculties as
president, nevertheless supports
Bush's interventionist interna
tional policy and argued that
once Iraq acquires nuclear arms,
it will become a dangerous pres
ence in the Middle East.
"We foolishly allowed North
Korea to get nuclear weapons by
using just the sort of appeasement
the left would have us engage in
with Iraq," Srinivasan said, "and
they're now able to extract con
cessions simply by waving their
missiles at Seoul, Tokyo — and
eventually, Anchorage. We don't
want to let that happen again."
Srinivasan said that, with nu
clear capabilities, Hussein would
easily be able to take over "70 per
cent of the world's proven oil re
serves," while deterring the Unit
ed States from intervening.
"We are fortunate enough to
have discovered — in ad
vance— an ambitious dictator
with known plots fora nuclear
biological weapons pro
gram," said senior Jed Rose, a
Republican. "Don't we only wish
we had this type of advanced
knowledge of Bin Laden's de
structive plans prior to 9 / 11 ?"

Many students supportive ola
war in Iraq agreed that (he Unit
ed States would ideally obtain
broader international consensus
before attacking, though they also
said America should attack unilat
erally if necessary.
"Generally speaking, laws are
only meaningful if they're backed
by the credible threat of force,"
Srinivasan said. "The U.N. means
nothing without (he U.S., be
cause, in the end, any nation can
flout the U.N. with impunity un
less the U.S. decides to step in and
enforce a resolution. That's
what's happening now: If Sad
dam is allowed to flout the U.N.
again — for the 17th time, I think
—it just further cements the
image of the U.N. as irrelevant
and ignorable."
"I find it absurd that we can
consider the U.N. General As
sembly to in any way legitimately
represent the world's people,
since the vast majority of these
countries are neither democratic
nor free," said junior Alex Rob
bins, who added that in the ab
sence of a global enforcing agency
that regulates international situa
tions, a strong country like the
United States should step in fora
common benefit.
"I think the lack of interna
tional support is a shame, but it
reflects more about other coun
tries than us," Towsner said.
"The Europeans don't face an
immediate threat and they don't
care if Hussein is bad for his own
people or his neighbors. We do
and should have more global in
terests in mind."
Most pro-war students felt that
war is likely in the near future un
less Hussein complies fully with
all American demands. They also
criticized anti-war students for ig
noring the humanitarian benefits
of a new government in Iraq.
"Leftists aren't offering real solu
tions here," Srinivasan said. "If we
don't attack Saddam to disarm him,
we need to keep up sanctions to pre
vent him from getting nukes. But
'humanitarians' blame sanctions
rather than Saddam for the suffer
ing of the Iraqi people because only
America can be the bad guy.
"Yes, the liberation of the peo
ple of Iraq will be a side effect of
the intervention rather than the
main cause, but does that taint it
to the extent that the end is no
longer desirable?"
