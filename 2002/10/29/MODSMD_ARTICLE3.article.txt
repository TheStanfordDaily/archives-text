# Less vocal but still present, pro-war students form a...
## Silent Minority 
### ALEX BLEYLEBEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Editors Note: This article is the fifth in a weekly se
ries investigating the relationship between the Stan
ford community and the potential rear in Iraq.

In a fall quarter that has been marked by
numerous rallies, teach-ins, flyers and many
other forms of protest against a war on Iraq,
strong sentiment in support of a war has been
all but invisible. According to a poll published
in last week's Stanford Review, only 14 per
cent of Stanford students support military ac
tion to oust Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
While most seem to agree that a majority of
the Stanford community is opposed to war,
war supporters disagree that the divide is as
overwhelming as the Review's poll or campus
activism would indicate.
Sophomore Joe Fairbanks, president of
the Stanford College Republicans, pointed
to flaws in the poll, the lac k of conservative
organizations on campus until the beginning
of this year, and a large number of undecid
ed students as factors that have overshad
owed a significant group of war supporters
on campus.
" The campus is not overwhelmingly anti
war, and 1 think that the majority of students
do not know whether they support it or not,"
he said. "I'd probably say that maybe a tiny
majority are opposed to it, with the others split

between supporting it and not knowing."
While many would disagree that the debate
is so even-handed, pro-war students do con
tend that they make up a significant, albeit
less-vocal group on campus.
"In many ways I feel less in a minority on an
issue like the war on Iraq because the protests
on campus have such a tinge of desperation,"
said senior Henry Towsner, a registered De
mocrat on the "libertarian side of the spec
trum" who was also last year's editor of The

Stanford Review. " The people here don't
speak for many other people in the country."
Towsner said he thought the anti-war
image of campus is created by a minority of
passionate liberal students.
Seventy-four percent of students polled by
The Review were opposed to any American
military action in Iraq. I hese numbers con
