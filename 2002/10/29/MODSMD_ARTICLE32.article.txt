### BRIAN DOYLE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In its final tournament of the
fall season, the Stanford women's
golf team begins play today in the
Rainbow Wahine Fall Classic in
Kapolei, 1 lawaii.
I lie tournament field of 17
teams is comprised largely of
teams from the Pacific-10 Confer
ence and Mountain West Confer-

Women's Golf
Stanford competes in the Rainbow
Wahine Fall Classic, Today-Wednesday

ence, including UCLA, Oregon,
California, Brigham Young and
New Mexico. The No. 7 Lobos, last
year's team champions, are the
iiighest-nationally ranked team
competing in the event.
Hut Stanford coach Caroline
O'Connor's eyes will probably be

directed on a team just four spots
behind the Lobos â€” the Golden
Bears, who finished first at the
Stanford / Pepsi Invitational two
weeks ago.
The Cardinal is led by senior
Kim Rowton, who has two top-15
individual showings to her credit
this fall, including a 13th-place fin
ish last week. Her final round 70
was the lowest individual score by a
Stanford player so far this year and
helped her overcome a slow start
on the first day of the tournament.
Freshman Kelly Husted contin
ues to impress, as she finished sec
ond among Cardinal players two
weeks ago with a 33rd-place finish.
The two-time high school Ail-
American has already proven her
self more than capable of con
tributing and can further solidify
her position on the team with a
strong finish to the fall season.
Junior Kim Kouwabunpat, who
has yet to record a top-25 finish indi
vidually, will try to settle down her oc
casionally erratic play with three
strong rounds this week. Sophomore
Wendra Liang will look to comple
ment her improved play around the
greens with more consistent shot
making, while junior Angela Rhocan
lx' counted on to contribute three
strong rounds in the mid-70s.
The Cal women enter play fresh
off of their victory at the Stanford
Golf Course, in which they defeat
ed both the Cardinal and New
Mexico, establishing themselves as
contenders in any tournament.
Led by seniors Vikki Laing and Ria
Quiazon, the Golden Bears boast
one of the deepest rosters of any
program in the country.
The Rainbow Wahine Fall Clas
sic will be the Stanford's final event
until the TRW Regional Challenge
in February in Palos Verdes, Calif.
Despite facing the stiff competition
of Cal and New Mexico, as well as
four other ranked schools, the
Cardinal is optimistic about its
prospects against some of the
field's weaker squads. Strong play
this week could earn Stanford its
highest finish to date.
