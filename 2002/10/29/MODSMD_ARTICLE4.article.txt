# University builds East Bay library
## Overflow books will be moved from campus to new Livermore location 
### MORGAN SPRINGER 
Faced with an ever-increasing
quantity of books and a limited
amount of space, Stanford Univer
sity Libraries has almost complet
ed construction on a third Stan
ford Auxiliary Library location in
the East Bay city of Livermore that
will have the capacity to house
nearly one-third of the Universi
ty's volumes.
Previously, the SAL system,
which is used to house the books
that are only requested infre
quently, consisted of two on-cam
pus locations at Pampas Lane, re
ferred to as SAL 1 and SAL 2.
However, as the University contin
ues to acquire books at a rate of
150,000 per year, those two loca
tions, along with the other campus
libraries, have proved insufficient
for Stanford's storage needs.
"The problem was, in the main
SAL, there just wasn't enough

room," said junior Stewart Niel
son, a former student member of
the Academic Council Committee
on Libraries. "We have 7 million
volumes in the whole University li
brary system, so it was definitely
overflowing."
The first collections to be
moved to the new SAL, also called
SAL 3, will be what head Universi
ty Librarian Michael Keller refers
to as "non-browsable collections,
like archives, manuscripts and rare
books."
Next, the plan is to transfer clas
sified books and serials to SAL 3.
1 "liese items will be pulled out of all
libraries, but most of the first wave
will come from Green Library.
"In general, we will try to move
material consulted least 112 requently
to SAL 3," Keller said.
If researchers need access to the
materials at SAL 3, they have two
choices: either make the one-hour
drive to Livermore or request the
needed items through the libraries
on campus. Depending when the
request is sent in, the delivery time
to the campus location could take
anywhere from a few hours to a
weekend. Also, with the rise of dig

ital services, researchers may be
able to access scanned copies of the
material without requesting the
physical book.
Another factor possibly affect
ing turnaround time for delivery
is the recent budget cuts affecting
most University institutions. The
library budget has been slashed by
5 percent, with the most notice
able effect being a freeze on hiring
and the decision to close the li
braries at midnight, rather than 2
a.m. as planned, during the end
of-quarter period. The freeze on
hiring could slow delivery from
SAL 3 as well, but Keller hopes to
keep at least one physical delivery
going each day.
l iie push to create a new SAL
location began with Keller back in
1994, with the original plan involv
ing the creation of another SAL
building next to the currently ex
isting ones on campus. However,
the General Use Permit — agreed
upon with Santa Clara County —
limited development and land use
and thus derailed that plan.
Since then, Keller enlisted the
aid of Provost John Ktchemendy
and University President John
Hennessy in successfully persuad
ing the Board of Trustees to ap
prove the off-campus building
project as the need for book stor
age continued to rise.
"The SAL 3 building presently
under construction is large
enough to accommodate about 15
years of growth of the collection,
but because the building is going
up behind demand for it, about
half the building will be occupied
within the first three years of its
opening as we bring material to it
from various leased storage areas,"
Keller said. "[But] the site is big
enough for us to build three more
such buildings; that is, the site is
big enough to accommodate about
(>() years of growth of the Stanford
collections at present rates."
Many students said they were
unconcerned by ihe library move.

Stanford's less popular books are housed in auxiliary libraries on the edge
of campus. To accommodc.e' the new 150,000 volumes added to the li
brary's collectior each yoar, o third auxiliary library is being built in the East
Bay, about one hour from Stanford.
"The move shouldn't affect
me," said graduate student An
drew Nigrinis. "I'm in economics,
so most of the stuff 1 need is fairly
general, a lot of it I can get online."

Senior John Wolf echoed
these ideas. "I don't know, 1
mean I've done some primary
source research, so as long as
they keep the important books,
it'll be okay," he said. "I don't
know how they decide what to
move — that must he interesting.
But I doubt that it affects hardly
anyone here."

but because the building is going
up behind demand for it, about
half the building will be occupied
within the first three years of its
opening as we bring material to it
from various leased storage areas,"
Keller said. "[But] the site is big
enough for us to build three more
such buildings; that is, the site is
big enough to accommodate about
(>() years of growth of the Stanford
collections at present rates."
Many students said they were
unconcerned by ihe library move.

Stanford's less popular books are housed in auxiliary libraries on the edge
of campus. To accommodc.e' the new 150,000 volumes added to the li
brary's collectior each yoar, o third auxiliary library is being built in the East
Bay, about one hour from Stanford.
"The move shouldn't affect
me," said graduate student An
drew Nigrinis. "I'm in economics,
so most of the stuff 1 need is fairly
general, a lot of it I can get online."

Senior John Wolf echoed
these ideas. "I don't know, 1
mean I've done some primary
source research, so as long as
they keep the important books,
it'll be okay," he said. "I don't
know how they decide what to
move — that must he interesting.
But I doubt that it affects hardly
anyone here."
Faced with an ever-increasing
quantity of books and a limited
amount of space, Stanford Univer
sity Libraries has almost complet
ed construction on a third Stan
ford Auxiliary Library location in
the East Bay city of Livermore that
will have the capacity to house
nearly one-third of the Universi
ty's volumes.
Previously, the SAL system,
which is used to house the books
that are only requested infre
quently, consisted of two on-cam
pus locations at Pampas Lane, re
ferred to as SAL 1 and SAL 2.
However, as the University contin
ues to acquire books at a rate of
150,000 per year, those two loca
tions, along with the other campus
libraries, have proved insufficient
for Stanford's storage needs.
"The problem was, in the main
SAL, there just wasn't enough

room," said junior Stewart Niel
son, a former student member of
the Academic Council Committee
on Libraries. "We have 7 million
volumes in the whole University li
brary system, so it was definitely
overflowing."
The first collections to be
moved to the new SAL, also called
SAL 3, will be what head Universi
ty Librarian Michael Keller refers
to as "non-browsable collections,
like archives, manuscripts and rare
books."
Next, the plan is to transfer clas
sified books and serials to SAL 3.
1 "liese items will be pulled out of all
libraries, but most of the first wave
will come from Green Library.
"In general, we will try to move
material consulted least 112 requently
to SAL 3," Keller said.
If researchers need access to the
materials at SAL 3, they have two
choices: either make the one-hour
drive to Livermore or request the
needed items through the libraries
on campus. Depending when the
request is sent in, the delivery time
to the campus location could take
anywhere from a few hours to a
weekend. Also, with the rise of dig

ital services, researchers may be
able to access scanned copies of the
material without requesting the
physical book.
Another factor possibly affect
ing turnaround time for delivery
is the recent budget cuts affecting
most University institutions. The
library budget has been slashed by
5 percent, with the most notice
able effect being a freeze on hiring
and the decision to close the li
braries at midnight, rather than 2
a.m. as planned, during the end
of-quarter period. The freeze on
hiring could slow delivery from
SAL 3 as well, but Keller hopes to
keep at least one physical delivery
going each day.
l iie push to create a new SAL
location began with Keller back in
1994, with the original plan involv
ing the creation of another SAL
building next to the currently ex
isting ones on campus. However,
the General Use Permit — agreed
upon with Santa Clara County —
limited development and land use
and thus derailed that plan.
Since then, Keller enlisted the
aid of Provost John Ktchemendy
and University President John
Hennessy in successfully persuad
ing the Board of Trustees to ap
prove the off-campus building
project as the need for book stor
age continued to rise.
"The SAL 3 building presently
under construction is large
enough to accommodate about 15
years of growth of the collection,
but because the building is going
up behind demand for it, about
half the building will be occupied
within the first three years of its
opening as we bring material to it
from various leased storage areas,"
Keller said. "[But] the site is big
enough for us to build three more
such buildings; that is, the site is
big enough to accommodate about
(>() years of growth of the Stanford
collections at present rates."
