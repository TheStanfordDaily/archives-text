# Prop 52 lets voters file on election day

### KATHERINE WANG 
Current California voter regis
tration rules may keep many would
be voters from casting their ballots
on Election Day a week from
today — existing criteria stipulate
that a voter must be registered in
(California 15 days prior to the elec

ballot initiatives, Proposition 52,
would allow citizens to register to
vote on the day of an election, ac

students who might otherwise have
missed the 15-day deadline.
Only six other states —Idaho,
Maine, Minnesota, New Hamp

register to vote, 1 would just have to

South Carolina who said he would
consider changing his residency to
(California if the proposition passed.

allow those who turn 18 a couple
weeks before the election to partici

"I think Stanford students
should think very carefully about
this issue because if it were passed,
college students would have a big
ger chance to be involved in our
country's democratic process," said
senior Monica Henestroza, the
ASSU President.
