# Prop 52 lets voters file on election day
## 
### KATHERINE WANG 
Current California voter regis
tration rules may keep many would
be voters from casting their ballots
on Election Day a week from
today — existing criteria stipulate
that a voter must be registered in
(California 15 days prior to the elec
tion date in order to cast a vote.
But one of this year's California
ballot initiatives, Proposition 52,
would allow citizens to register to
vote on the day of an election, ac
commodating busy and forgetful
students who might otherwise have
missed the 15-day deadline.
Only six other states —Idaho,
Maine, Minnesota, New Hamp
shire, Wyoming and Wisconsin —
have similar initiatives on the ballot
this year.
Since the Stanford community
includes students from different
states across the nation, many stu
dents, who want to vote in Califor
nia, will have to re-register to be eli
gible to vote for candidates for (Cali
fornia office and its ballot initiatives.
"[Proposition 52] reduces some
of the administrative and bureau
cratic problems that come with reg
istering to vote," said Sarah Schul
inan, an ASSU senator who has
been working on the Get-Out-the-
Vote campaign.

A number of students seem to
agree that Proposition 52 would
make voting easier.
"Instead of having to go twice to
register to vote, 1 would just have to
register 11 ie day of the electk >n," said
Saahir Khan, a freshman from
South Carolina who said he would
consider changing his residency to
(California if the proposition passed.
112 he proposition would also
allow those who turn 18 a couple
weeks before the election to partici
pate in the election.
"I think Stanford students
should think very carefully about
this issue because if it were passed,
college students would have a big
ger chance to be involved in our
country's democratic process," said
senior Monica Henestroza, the
ASSU President.
Although analysts believe that
this could spike voter turnout in

California up to 9 percent, at the
same time, some argue that the
likelihood for voter fraud can
also increase.
Financed principally by Rob
McKay, heir to the Taco Bell for
tune, Proposition 52 proposes that
voters be allowed to register by
showing a valid California Driver's
License or two lbrms of identifica
tion proving that they are California
residents.
Some opponents of the initiative
expressed concern that random
pieces of mail could be used as proof
of residency, but others argued that
Proposition 52 contains language
that would combat falsification of
identity and other acts of fraud.
"We have to take care of the po
tential voter fraud," said Assembly
man Joe Simitian. "The procedures
should be rigorous, but 1 feel that
these are just technical aspects that

we can overcome.
Simitian said that Proposition 52
provides for stricter punishment to
fraudulent voters. The penalty
could include a long jail sentence
and a fine of up to $20,000.
Others said they disagree that
this is enough to prevent the im
pending problem of fraud.
"While 1 believe that the mea
sure and its proponents are well-in
tentioned ... I find that there are
simply not enough safeguards in
place within the measure to prevent
intentional voter fraud and substan
tial votes cast in error," California
Secretary of State Bill Jones said in a
speech to the members of Citizens
and Enforcement Against Elec
tion Fraud.
If Proposition 52 were passed,
county election officials will have to
bear the burden of adding at least
one additional officer per polling
place in order to accommodate on
site registration.
"Anything we can do for people
to participate in the process is im
portant," Simitian said.
