# New group forms for Republicans

Here at Stanford, students say it's not easy being
part of the right wing. Surrounded by more liberal
peers, conservative Republicans say they feel a skepti

This year, a new student group, the College Re
publicans, has formed to represent this minority.
According to sophomore Joe Fairbanks, founder
and president of the College Republicans, the group
is "a broad-based coalition of Republicans that wel
comes moderates, conservatives and libertarians.
Although the group began to organize prior to fall
quarter, i( was only able to officially establish itself
this year.
In past years the group did not form due to "in
sufficient leadership," Fairbanks said.
Last spring the group's attempt to become an offi

"They just let it sit there for weeks," he said. "They

let it go by graduation, and one signature on our pe

didn't have enough signatures because of this, even
though the petition was turned in before that student
graduated."
