# New group forms for Republicans
## 
### JULIE PARK 
Here at Stanford, students say it's not easy being
part of the right wing. Surrounded by more liberal
peers, conservative Republicans say they feel a skepti
cal, even disdainful atmosphere at times.
This year, a new student group, the College Re
publicans, has formed to represent this minority.
According to sophomore Joe Fairbanks, founder
and president of the College Republicans, the group
is "a broad-based coalition of Republicans that wel
comes moderates, conservatives and libertarians.
Although the group began to organize prior to fall
quarter, i( was only able to officially establish itself
this year.
In past years the group did not form due to "in
sufficient leadership," Fairbanks said.
Last spring the group's attempt to become an offi
cial student organization failed after the Office of Stu
dent Activities did not make a move on the organiza
tion's constitution, according to Fairbanks.
"They just let it sit there for weeks," he said. "They

let it go by graduation, and one signature on our pe
tition was by a student who had just graduated. We
didn't have enough signatures because of this, even
though the petition was turned in before that student
graduated."
At the beginning of the 2002-2003 academic year,

the College Republicans had no
trouble getting approved, Fair
banks said.
Bui, according to Fairbanks,
just because the group was ap
proved this year does not mean
that the (Mice of Student Activities
is more accepting of conservative
organizations.
"It seems the ()SA gives trouble
to conservative groups," he said.
"| It | is disorganized as a whole."
Director of Student Activities
Nanci Howe of the Oflice of the
Dean of Students disagreed, call
ing Fairbanks remarks concerning
the OSA "misleading."
"It was intentional [that the
group could not form until this
year]," she said. "Forms submitted

in late spring are not processed
until the following academic year."
Howe added that the signature
of the 2002 graduate could not be
included for the 2002-2003 acade
mic year.
Over 100 students expressed
interest on the College Republi
cans' sign-up sheet at the activities
fair this year. However, Fairbanks
speculated that there are "many,
many more" interested students
who did not sign up. Fairbanks
wants to attract 500 to 000 more
members.
Fhe group believes Stanford's
student body is increasingly toler
ant and open to conservative views,
despite the anti-war sentiment dis
played by Stanford students in ca
sual conversation and protests in
San Francisco and on campus.
Rustin McCullum, vice presi
dent of a different organization
known as the Stanford Republi

cans, said that students should not
"measure the conservative pres
ence at Stanford by the number oi
right-wing partisan groups, but by
the positive social contributions
that conservative students make."
He added, "It's easy to make
placards and stage a rally in White
Plaza. It's much harder to get up in
the morning and put eight hours
of work to further a social objective
that you support."
Sophomore Will Hudson, chief
flnanc ial officer of the College Re
publicans, explained the objectives
of the organization.
"We are finding ample support,
more than we had originally antic
ipated . . . There is a myth that Re
publicans in general don't care
about many important issues —
the environment, health care, that
sort of thing — and dispelling this
myth is one of the College Repub
licans' focuses on campus. We're

trying to combat lies about the Re
publican Party."
'Hie College Republicans are
planning to invite U.S. Senator
John McCain (R-Az.) to speak on
campus and is currently working
on a rally to "support our troops
and liberate Iraq," Fairbanks said.
I le also said the group is creat
ing a campaign to "educate [the]
campus on Saudi Arabia."
To date, the group has had as
guests two senior editors from the
National Review and is planning to
have Shannon Reeves, a "conserv
ative African American" of the
NAACP, speak on campus.
Another major goal of the orga
nization is to bring the ROTC — a
program that was removed from
campus more than three decades
ago — back to Stanford.
"All in all," I ludson said, "it's a
great time to be Republican at
Stanford."
