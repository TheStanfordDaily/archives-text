# Cantor Arts Center to debut student guides
## New program intends to bolster interest in the arts among students

Picture sitting around with
your biology classmates, analyzing
the anatomy of the Rodin sculp
tures in a discussion guided by a
knowledgeable fellow student.
This is what Patience Young, cu
rator for education at the Cantor
Arts Center, and Geoff Shamos,
student guides assistant, envision
as they kick off the first year of the
Student Guides Program.
Approximately 20 students will
be chosen to become guides after
participating in the training
course. The class will run three
hours a week from early Novem
ber through February.
During the sessions, some of
the trainees' time will be spent in a
combination of lectures and tours
by the program directors, other
curators at the museum, art histo
ry professors and the docents who
already volunteer at the museum.
In addition, students will learn
and practice the skill of successful
ly guiding discussions.
"We'll be working on the nuts
and bolts of how one leads a dis
cussion, how one converses about
art," Shamos explained.
Outside of class, the future
guides are expected to do re
search into specific pieces, periods
or movements represented in the
museum, in order to have some
background with which to field
questions and feed discussion.
That does not mean that all dis
cussions will have lo focus on art
history or even the ait itself.
"We particularly hope that stu
dents who are guides are bringing
the expertise of their own majors
and their own interests, so these
are not necessarily art history dis
cussions at all," Young said.
"I'm particularly interested in
people who are using art to learn,"
she added.
The Student Guides Program
hopes to attract students in a vari
ety of fields in order to help gen

erate interest in the Cantor Arts
Center for students of all majors.
The program coordinators hopes
that by having guides with diverse
academic backgrounds, a wider
range of students may be intro
duced to the museum.
"With training these students,
sort of giving them a behind-the
scenes look at what the museum is
and how it functions, you're also
getting a group of students that
can act as liaisons," Shamos said.
Program organizers want pro
fessors of all disciplines to inte
grate the discussions into their
classes, and would also like to lead
dorm groups, Young added.
Once students begin in their offi
cial capacity as guides, they will be
responsible for helping find and
attract groups to the museum to
participate in guided discussions.
" There will be an onus on the
individual guides to find a certain
audience," Shamos said.
Because the guides play such
an important role in connecting
with the greater Stanford commu
nity and in leading their peers in
discussion, the ideal applicant
must be good at working closely
with other people.
"One of the most crucial fac
tors is someone who is person
able, and someone who won't
clam up in front of a group,"
Shamos said. "If they can talk to a
group, their art history knowl
edge is not as important."
Shamos noted that there seems
to be a good deal of student inter
est in the program; the museum
had received more than 40 re
quests for more information more
than a week before the application
deadline of Nov. 1. There will be
an informational meeting for the
program at 8 p.m. on Oct. 29 in
the lobby of the Cummings Art
Building.
Students trained this year can
continue guiding discussions at
the museum through the rest of
their Stanford career.
Since this is the first year, there
are not yet plans for expansion of
the program.
Nevertheless, Shamos re
marked, "Hopefully it'll be some
thing that snowballs and grows."
