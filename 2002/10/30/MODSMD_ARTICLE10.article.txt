# University officials discourage students from exceeding cap
## THE 						20-UNIT LIMIT EXPLAINED 
### CORINA YEN 
Since Stanford recommends an aver
age undergraduate courseload of 15
units per quarter, students who take 20
units can generally expect long hours in
the library and little time for sleep or so
cial lives. Exceeding the maximum 20
academic units, which would theoretic al
ly equate to over 60 hours of work per
week, thus seems like a task few would
want to tackle, and one which University
officials strongly discourage.
"1 have no time to myself, and I prob
ably never want to do this again ... I
think [the cap| is a good policy that keeps
kids sane," said freshman Chris Mi
naker, who is currently taking 20 units.
However, for those students who do
want to take more, the University's 20-
unit cap feels restrictive and arbitrary.
"Why regulate studies when there are
so many more important life decisions
the University takes a hands-off ap
proach to in college life?" said sopho
more Sam Chang, who wanted to take
more than 21 units this term.
University Registrar Roger Printup,
whose office implements the policy, feels
there is general support for the restric
tion because it has been around for so
long. After 10 years at Stanford, Printup
has never heard the issue raised by stu
dents or faculty.

Associate Director for Freshman Ad
vising Dandre DeSandics, who repre
sents the Undergraduate Advising Cen
ter, added that he thinks the policy is en
tirely reasonable, because Stanford has
the right to set educational policies that
are in the students' best interest.
Printup and DeSandies offered dif
ferent perspectives on the reasons for the
cap.
According to Printup, many students
could still do well taking more courses
because of grade inflation, but faculty are
concerned that they would spread them
selves too thin and not receive an in
depth understanding of their courses.
DeSandies said he feels the policy rep
resents Stanford's philosophy that the
educational experience is more than just
taking c lasses — he encourages students
to enjoy Stanford's non-academic re
sources.
"Stanford is not just a 'courses' or
'units' university, but a comprehensive
educational experience," he said. "The
more units you take, the less time you
have to experience this."
DeSandies said that Stanford courses
tend to be very challenging, and more
units would create unhealthy stress lev
els.
Printup said that while lie believes stu
dents could handle live or six relatively
serious courses, the restriction is neces

sary to prevent "skimming the surface"
of understanding and "shallow explo
ration of topics." If the cap were re
moved, Printup asks, "Are we then say
ing to take more courses and [that] it is
okay to delve less deeply into courses en
rolled in?"
While some students want to take 20
or more units a quarter in order to grad
uate early, both Printup and DeSandies
deny that Stanford's policy is trying to
discourage early graduation. They point
out that it is possible to graduate in three
years by taking 20 units each quarter.
However, without a cap, Printup
thinks that enterprising students might
take more courses to maximize the
amount of instruction they receive for
their tuition.
Printup estimated that if the 20-unit
cap were not a part of student culture, up
to 1,000 students might register for more
than 20 units. Economic repercussions
would then include increasing tuition to
budget lor more course instruction or
(barging students per extra unit, as is
done for graduate students.
DeSandies said he also feels that many
students want to take more units from fi
nancial pressure to graduate early, but
this pressure is unnecessary.
"It is an entirely reasonable cap from
an advising perspective, and exceptions
should only be made in extraordinary

circumstances because Stanford
has . . . generous financial-aid pack
ages," he said.
The Registrar's Office does occasion
ally grant petitions to take more than 20
units. If one unit of a 21-unit load is an
activity course, the petition is always
granted. Also, once during a student's se
nior year there can be an exception up to
about 22 to 23 units when there is a good
reason, according to Printup.
While DeSandies said almost every
petition receives the approval of stu
dents' advisers, when asked for examples
of petitions that the Registrar's Office
granted, he could not recall one besides
those for the one-activity-unit rule.
Vicky Schwartz, a junior whose peti
tion to take 24 units was denied, said her
adviser was helpful and supportive but
that the Registrar's Office denied it on
principle without considering her partic
ular case.
DeSandies said the Undergraduate
Advising Center tries to help students
deal with the cap by exploring alterna
tives and forming an academic plan that
balances courses and other activities. 1 le
added that advisers try to learn about
each student's circumstances.
"We really want to help students get
what this great place has to offer, and you
cannot get ii if you're taking 25 units a
quarter."

there is general support for the restric
tion because it has been around for so
long. After 10 years at Stanford, Printup
has never heard the issue raised by stu
dents or faculty.

Associate Director for Freshman Ad
vising Dandre DeSandics, who repre
sents the Undergraduate Advising Cen
ter, added that he thinks the policy is en
tirely reasonable, because Stanford has
the right to set educational policies that
are in the students' best interest.
Printup and DeSandies offered dif
ferent perspectives on the reasons for the
cap.
According to Printup, many students
could still do well taking more courses
because of grade inflation, but faculty are
concerned that they would spread them
selves too thin and not receive an in
depth understanding of their courses.
DeSandies said he feels the policy rep
resents Stanford's philosophy that the
educational experience is more than just
taking c lasses — he encourages students
to enjoy Stanford's non-academic re
sources.
"Stanford is not just a 'courses' or
'units' university, but a comprehensive
educational experience," he said. "The
more units you take, the less time you
have to experience this."
DeSandies said that Stanford courses
tend to be very challenging, and more
units would create unhealthy stress lev
els.
Printup said that while lie believes stu
dents could handle live or six relatively
serious courses, the restriction is neces

sary to prevent "skimming the surface"
of understanding and "shallow explo
ration of topics." If the cap were re
moved, Printup asks, "Are we then say
ing to take more courses and [that] it is
okay to delve less deeply into courses en
rolled in?"
While some students want to take 20
or more units a quarter in order to grad
uate early, both Printup and DeSandies
deny that Stanford's policy is trying to
discourage early graduation. They point
out that it is possible to graduate in three
years by taking 20 units each quarter.
However, without a cap, Printup
thinks that enterprising students might
take more courses to maximize the
amount of instruction they receive for
their tuition.
Printup estimated that if the 20-unit
cap were not a part of student culture, up
to 1,000 students might register for more
than 20 units. Economic repercussions
would then include increasing tuition to
budget lor more course instruction or
(barging students per extra unit, as is
done for graduate students.
DeSandies said he also feels that many
students want to take more units from fi
nancial pressure to graduate early, but
this pressure is unnecessary.
"It is an entirely reasonable cap from
an advising perspective, and exceptions
should only be made in extraordinary

circumstances because Stanford
has . . . generous financial-aid pack
ages," he said.
The Registrar's Office does occasion
ally grant petitions to take more than 20
units. If one unit of a 21-unit load is an
activity course, the petition is always
granted. Also, once during a student's se
nior year there can be an exception up to
about 22 to 23 units when there is a good
reason, according to Printup.
While DeSandies said almost every
petition receives the approval of stu
dents' advisers, when asked for examples
of petitions that the Registrar's Office
granted, he could not recall one besides
those for the one-activity-unit rule.
Vicky Schwartz, a junior whose peti
tion to take 24 units was denied, said her
adviser was helpful and supportive but
that the Registrar's Office denied it on
principle without considering her partic
ular case.
DeSandies said the Undergraduate
Advising Center tries to help students
deal with the cap by exploring alterna
tives and forming an academic plan that
balances courses and other activities. 1 le
added that advisers try to learn about
each student's circumstances.
"We really want to help students get
what this great place has to offer, and you
cannot get ii if you're taking 25 units a
quarter."
Since Stanford recommends an aver
age undergraduate courseload of 15
units per quarter, students who take 20
units can generally expect long hours in
the library and little time for sleep or so
cial lives. Exceeding the maximum 20
academic units, which would theoretic al
ly equate to over 60 hours of work per
week, thus seems like a task few would
want to tackle, and one which University
officials strongly discourage.
"1 have no time to myself, and I prob
ably never want to do this again ... I
think [the cap| is a good policy that keeps
kids sane," said freshman Chris Mi
naker, who is currently taking 20 units.
However, for those students who do
want to take more, the University's 20-
unit cap feels restrictive and arbitrary.
"Why regulate studies when there are
so many more important life decisions
the University takes a hands-off ap
proach to in college life?" said sopho
more Sam Chang, who wanted to take
more than 21 units this term.
