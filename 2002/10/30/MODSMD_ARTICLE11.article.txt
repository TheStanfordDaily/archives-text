## North Korea refuses to disarm 
### 
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia
(AP) â€” Blaming the United States
for pushing it into a corner, North
Korea rejected demands it give up
its nuclear weapons program dur
ing an acrimonious opening
round of talks yesterday with
Japan on establishing diplomatic
ties, Japanese officials said.
The talks were the first the
countries have held in two years
on establishing ties, and hopes
were high North Korea would
oilier some sort of concession on
the nuclear issue and growing out
rage in Japan over the kidnapping
of its citizens in the 1970s and' 80s.
But along with ignoring calls to
halt its nuclear weapons develop
ment, the North strongly rebuffed
Japan on the abduction issue,
heightening an already emotional
tug-of-war between the Asian
neighbors.
"Not much progress," Japanese
delegation chief Katsunari Suzuki

said as he returned from the talks.
Still, officials said talks would
continue as scheduled today.
In Washington, Secretary of
State Colin Powell warned that
North Korea faces a grim econom
ic future unless it complies with
growing international demands to
surrender the nuclear program.
"No North Korean child can eat
enriched uranium," Powell told a
news conference.
Since the North acknowledged
its nuclear arms program this
month, Japan has insisted scrap
ping it was a precondition for nor
malization between the longtime
rivals.
The North "completely de
nied" calls for the country to give
up its nuclear weapons program, a
senior Japanese delegation official
said. The North blamed concerns
over its nuclear weapons program
on the United States, saying the
hard-line U.S. stance against it was

the "root of the problem," said the
official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
North Korea has long justified
efforts to bolster its military by
claiming the presence of tens of
thousands of U.S. troops in Japan
and South Korea is a threat
against which it must be able to de
fend itself.
"Japan wants to focus on the ab
duction and security issues," said
Pak RyongYeon, the North Kore
an delegation's No. 2 official. "But
our thinking is, that if we work to
ward diplomatic ties, then the se
curity issues will be solved along
the way."
North Korea acknowledged the
secret nuclear weapons program
to a visiting senior U.S. official this
month. For Japan, the news was
especially frightening because Py
ongyang has demonstrated that it
can fire missiles well beyond
Japan's main islands.
