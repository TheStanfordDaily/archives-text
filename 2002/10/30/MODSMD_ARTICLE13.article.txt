# U.S. to compromise on resolution
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Signaling compromise,
Secretary of State Colin Powell said yesterday "there
may be a way" to bridge remaining differences with
France and Russia on T f.N. resolution designed to
force Iraq to disarm.
"That's what we are working on, Intensively
today," Powell said as American diplomats at the Unit
ed Nations privately floated marginal revisions of the
tough resolution sought by the United States and
Britain six difficult weeks.
"We're hard at work and 1 think we are getting
closer," Powell said.
"Clear indictment of Saddam Hussein's past be
havior and current behavior has to be in the resolu
tion," he said, and "there has to be a very tough in
spection regime."
Powell also said "there have to be consequences.

Otherwise, Iraq will try to deceive and distract and they
may try anyway, even in the face of consequences."
A White House official said the Bush administra
tion was using its threat to act alone against Iraq as a
strategy to compel Russia and France to back the joint
U.S.-British resolution.
While they do not like the resolution, the adminis
tration is hoping they w ill support it rather than be left
behind, the official said.
Powell said "we're getting close to a point where
we'll have to see whether or not we can bridge these
remaining differences in the very near future."
If a decision on the resolution is not reached in the
next week it would mean President Bush would be
spared making a potentially explosive decision on
whether to go to war until after the Congressional elec
tions next Tuesday.
