## The 						Stanford Daily 'Real News' puts issues of diversity on campus radar 
### 
Published Since] 891

During Homecoming Weekend, many
African American alumni smiled as
they peered through the pages of The
Real News. Behind these smiles hid
recollections of their Stanford years, where this
same newspaper created such memorable expe
riences. From the 1970s until the mid-'9os, The
Real News served as a huh for African-American
intellectual thought and social awareness.
The original publication quickly carved a
niche for capturing exclusive interviews and
original articles from leading activists, scholars
and artists.
Recently, a small group of primarily African-
American students mustered resources within the
University and maximized networks within the
black community to reintroduce the first issue of
The Real News since 1995.
We would like to congratulate the staff of The
Real News for the successful revival of this publi
cation and encourage them to establish an infras
tructure that will allow this paper to smoothly

transition from year to year and continue to be a
part of the Stanford culture even after the cur
rent staffs graduation.
Not only does the paper look professional,
which is impressive fora first publication, but its
pages are extremely content heavy with topics
ranging from black political leaders, campus pol
itics, contemporary music and cultural editorials.
The exploration of some seemingly taboo top
ics, such as the lack of space in the Black Com
munity Services Center and the potential war in
Iraq, will allow readers to analyze a certain issues
from the minority perspective, which is valid and
important aspect of the college experience.
The Real News, in its commitment to focus on
minority issues, especially those specific to the
African-American community, adds diversity to
the publication community that has been missing
in recent years.
Further, we are impressed by The Real News'
attempts to reach out to other minority commu
nities on campus through its distribution setup,

which delivers to all of the ethnic and cultural
community centers, the ethnic theme dorms and
various other University academic departments,
and its topics that deal with subjects outside of
the African-American community.
Leaders from within non-black minority com
munities support The Real News by contributing
information and perspective. Such a partnership
spreads another layer of diversity onto the publi
cation and symbolizes more comprehensive mi
nority support for The Real News.
While developed and maintained within the
black community, the paper's diverse range of
topics and editorials reveal the deep extent to
which diversity exists within the black communi
ty at Stanford.
As a result, for the first time in a long time,
African-American students from various back
grounds and interests can unify, converse and ex
press themselves through The Real News, which is
reestablishing itself as a community forum.
While no one publication can embody every as

pect of an ethnic community, The Real News has
struck a balance that does not attempt to define
blackness, but rather expresses blackness.
However, the impact of such a paper cannot
and should not stop at the borders of the black
community. Non-black students can use this
paper as an ambassador into the interests and is
sues that define various aspects of a diverse
African-American diasporic culture.
The publication reveals humors and sensitiv
ities by highlighting current events and cultural
traditions. Such revelations cannot be taught in
a classroom.
Stanford can best accomplish its educational
mission when it expands the University learning
environment from within the walls of classrooms
to include the broader Stanford community.
The Real News serves as a catalyst for learning
and exchange that is an essential aspect of un
dergraduate and graduate education. With that
said, we urge all students to keep an eye out for
The Real News' next publication.
