# MEMORY YIELDS
## Researchers ask: 'Do you know the way to San Jose?'

Introduction — As ex-President Matt
Brewer so brilliantly pointed out in
the wake of last year's elections, de
spite the ASSU's best efforts, Stan
ford remains divided. Along ethnic lines?
Certainly. On gender issues? Absolutely.
Fuzzy /techy? Of course. However, inde
pendent of your stance on war in Iraq, the
tax cuts, white theme dorms (may we sug
gest the WASP Nest?), your poor draw
number or whether erecting a totem pole
in the middle of campus was a good idea,
there is still one issue that the Stanford
community still does not have an answer
to: Which is faster to US 101, Oregon Ex
pressway or Embar-

cadero Road?
For those of you with
out a car, just turn the
page and wipe that
smug look off your face
as you park your bike at
Mirrielees. For those of
you who have yet to hear
of Oregon, listen up.
Whether you are going
to Krispy Kreme be-

cause you need one more donut to se
cure that last vote, or the AMC to catch
the latest Antonio Banderas movie (don't
pretend you didn't go see "Ballistic") . . .
When you're hankering fora late-night
snack (but not so late that you have to set
tle for Jack), when you want the best bur
rito on the Peninsula (La Costena, of
course), or when you just need cheap
liquor and that chump down the hall has
a card, where do you head? The Mount
Olympus of highway exits: Rengstorff.
But, how do you get there?
As the signs on 101 indicate, "the man"
recommends using Embarcadero for your
Stanford-to-101 needs. However, his pref
erence for Embarcadero may easily be an
artifact of Embarcadero's directness and
the lack of confusion to those drivers who
actually need directions — indeed, no
turns are needed on Embarcadero. Be
cause erudite Stanford students are c apa
ble of making a left turn, directness mat
ters not to us. But, because we're all here
on borrowed time, speed is of the essence
on such a banal drive.
The funny thing about the Oregon /
Embarcadero debate is both how evenly
divided the Stanford community is and
how resolutely each side believes in its
route. Evidently, to attack one's internal
driving clock is to strike at the very essence
that makes us human. In a recent
Greninger & Meyer poll, 32 percent of
students claimed Embarcadero was faster
across the board, 27 percent gave a blan
ket Oregon response, 27 percent (in true
Stanford-student style) said it was faster to
take Embarcadero if you're going 101
North and Oregon if by 101 South and 14
percent gave the dull "depends on tin

time of day" response.
Thankfully, when compared to the
other issues that concern (lie Stanford
campus, this one seems resolvable with a
simple bit of empiricism. Thus, we set out
to find the truth in the Embarcadero/
Oregon debate.
Materials and Methods — To be truly
empirical, one 1997 Mazda MX-6 made
the rounds between Stanford University
and the Embarcadero / Oregon St. exit on
US 101. Timing was done for early trials
on a $4.99 Wal-mart stopwatch, but due to
LSAT requirements and kleptomaniac
friends, final time trials were measured off
the CD player's time remaining on Ferry
Corsten's "Trance Nation 2001 Disc 1"
(yes, one of us listens to that crap). All in all,
about 15 bucks was spent on gas, Krispy
Kreme and In N' Out — consider that
your debt to us.
Before we began time trials, a standard
course had to be charted between Stan
ford and 101. Because of the overwhelm
ing car-using population on the east side
of campus (yes, graduate students and
post docs count too), we decided to focus
on coming from East Campus. Anyway,
you West Campus folk are simply foolish
not to take Junipero Serra to Page Mill —
there's simply no tradeoff between the
speed limit and distance.
Time points began as soon as we start
ed to accelerate through the Serra Street
& Campus Drive 4-way stop and stopped
when we had successfully merged onto the
101, and vice versa for return trips. All
time trials were conducted between 11
p.m. and 1 a.m. to minimize traffic and
replicate previous late-night food runs.
Data was analyzed using the two-sample
I-test option on a TI-83, because neither
of us has taken anything above Stats 60.
Results — First, we had to normalize
the Oregon route, as different schools of
thought on the utility of Alma Rd. exist.
I lowever, it was soon found that the Alma
just couldn't compete with El Camino
"The Real Deal" 82 (data not shown).
With all the data pooled together (per
mutations include Oregon vs. Embar
cadero,and 101 Svs. 101 N to or from Stan
ford), Oregon was definitely faster to 101
(p= 0.069, n= 20). As far as resolving all
the permutations, Oregon was incredibly
faster to 101 S coming from Stanford (p=
0.007) and contained our absolute mini
mum time point — we challenge the more
intrepid to beat our time-to-merge of 5.33
minutes. On every other account, although
Oregon was faster between Stanford and
101, it was not statistically significant
(p=0.31 from 101 S to Stanford, p=0.49
from Stanford to 101 N,and p=0.39 from
101N to Stanford). 1 lowever, our study suf
fers from a low sample size (n=2o), so we


Alex Greninger &
Tim Meyer
encourage some of the more bored
upperclassmen to repeat our ex
periment to test our results.
Certainly further research is
needed. Although not within the
scope of this study, Stanford still re
mains divided over other traflic-re
lated issues such as: Is it faster to
take Junipero Serra or Maylield /
Santa Theresa between Maylield
and Campus Dr. and West Cam
pus housing, or which way around
Meyer Library is the most efficient
when biking from East Campus to
class? So, rather than taking that
$3,000 giant to create a photo
journal of Fiji, we suggest other stu
dents employ our methods of traf
fic timing as a cost-effective way of
undermining the name of under
graduate research. Thank you.
