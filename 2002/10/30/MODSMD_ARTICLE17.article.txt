More stringent alcohol policy points to 'a
disintegration of mutual respect 7
As former social manager of a fraternity
current ly on alcohol probation, I feel com
pelled to comment on the Oct. 28 article
"Dry Campus?". In fact, this article raises an
issue whose implications may not be clear at
first glance. The real issue here is respect.
While it may be masked by the particulars
of alcohol violations and "increasing" safety
concerns, the changes occurring on our
campus belie a disintegration of the mutual
respect between undergraduate students
and the administration. This is an unspo
ken agreement that has in the past made
living and studying here such a unique ex
perience, academically and socially. The
understanding is that we, as intelligent
adults, will be granted a certain amount of
freedom and we will do our best to use that
freedom responsibly—becoming better in
dividuals because of it.
Joey Greenwell and the Office of Stu
dent Activities did an outstanding job of
ensuring the safety of students at parties
in the past, through a system that empha
sized student responsibility, rather than
administrative action. What happened?
The administration's decision to use
"alcohol probation" as punishment
should be viewed for what it is: a reac
tionary response to a decidedly national —
not local — issue. Notice that Dean Graves
mentioned alcohol-related deaths nation
wide as a factor, but conceded that Stan
ford "[hasn't] had an alcohol-related
death since 1985."
Indeed, it may be "only a matter of time"
before an alcohol-related accident occurs at
Stanford, but shutting down fraternity par
ties is absolutely the wrong response.
Christopher Diedrich's observation that

"people don't get drunk at fi at parties; you
wait fora half-hour fora half-cup of foamy
beer," shows the conventional wisdom of
anyone who has been there. This is in stark
contrast to the actions of the administra
tion, which display a lack of practical expe
rience and, furthermore, only serve to com
pound the safety issue by compartmentaliz
ing alcohol consumption in the dorms and
fraternities. It is clear that the administra
tion has targeted only the most visible orga
nizations (i.e. the Band and fraternities) ap
parently in an attempt to intimidate stu
dents into compliance.
No hat parties? Who cares? Invitation
parties are certainly more fun to host. But
open parties allow an unparalleled oppor
tunity for meeting new people and making
friends from other parts of campus—an es
sential part of the college experience. I am
disappointed and frustrated at the notion
that the freshmen this year will not have the
opportunity we had to experience this. Oh,
and non-alcoholic parties? Come on, grand
ma, get your head out of the sand.
Solving the problem of alcohol safety
will not be easy of course, but clearly
putting fraternities and other highly visi
ble organizations on probation solves
nothing. In fact, it punishes those it at
tempts to protect.
While the administration's intentions
may be good, they seem to be taking two
steps back for every step forward. Perhaps
educating freshmen about the dangers of al
cohol is a better solution, for example.
Nonetheless, I believe that a certain amount
of respect and confidence in the responsibil
ity of Stanford students will go a long way.

'The final nail has been driven into the
coffin of fun'
Am I ever glad to be a senior and out
the door in June. I'm sorry to do this
freshmen, hut I'd like to point out the fact
that the final nail has been driven into the
coffin of fun at Stanford.
In 1 he Daily article, "Dry Campus?"
(Oct. 28) about the recent lameness
here, Joey Greenwell tells us that
though fraternities do great party plan
ning on campus, if some incident hap
pens, "they have to be able to show that
they did everything possible to protect
the health and safety of their guests,"
meaning when the case goes before the
conduct board after 60 to 90 days.
I he same goes lor any student group.
I in all for accountability for throwing safe
parties, except that recent events have
shown us that after any reported incident,
the organization in question will be in
stantly put on probation until its defense
can be made, months later.
Kven if the defense is successful, the ac
cusation will still have caused the group a
long and unpleasant probation.
So here's the problem: Every party,
no matter how well-planned, has a risk of
an incident. Any incident, valid or not,
puts the group on probation for up to a
lull quarter.
Campus police are now raiding par
ties, looking for incidents. Given these
obstacles, what are the odds we'll ever
sec- another large (read: fun) party at
Stanford and meet someone new? See
you all at Santa Clara, il you've got a car
(sorry, freshmen).
