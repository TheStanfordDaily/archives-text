ford was able to finish second among
West Coast schools, finishing ahead of
traditional powerhouses California and
Cal Poly.
The team got off to a strong start in the
cross country competition, tackling three
laps on a treacherous eight-mile course.
Michael Cleary overcame cold, thin air and
frozen water bottles to finish the 24-mile
race in 24th to lead the Stanford men's con
tingent. Kevin Weng was close behind in
27th, and Rob Becker rounded out the
Cardinal lineup in 52nd.
Stanford's performance was pushed
higher by the women's squad, with Ashley
Fonts posting an impressive seventh-place
finish, followed by Whitney Hopkins in
14th and Yayoi Takamura in 24th. The
women finished fourth in the event overall.
The Stanford women also stepped up
for the team in the brutal dual slalom
event, which the men on the team side
stepped. Hopkins braved the course,
which took out more than a few riders, for
a ninth-place finish.
The run-in with the law came on the
Saturday night of the competition as the
Cardinal riders were preparing to enter a
team in the unofficial naked criterium
race. Local police apprehended someone
in the Stanford party, though the team
was able to negotiate the accused's release
a few hours later.
Following that snafu, the team took part
in the final downhill competition on Sun
day, though after some very intense prac
tice runs, only three Cardinal riders en
tered the race. Few riders made it across t he
line with their bikes and bodies in good con
dition after the steep, hazard-lined course.
A lost chain on her bike wasn't enough to
keep Hopkins from finishing eighth, while
Tenille Smith managed to complete the
course in bare feet and a blown fork in 10th

place. Weng made it down the slope un
harmed but could only manage a 47th
place finish.
Ice Hockey fights for four points at UCLA
The Stanford club ice hockey team came
away with a win and a tie from a rough-and
tumble weekend in Los Angeles against Pa
cific-8 Conference rival UCLA.
A postgame bench-clearing brawl after
the Cardinal's 7-4 win over the Bruins on
Friday resulted in suspensions that left
Stanford shorthanded for the teams' re
match on Saturday. UCLA took the second
game 3-1 in a shootout after the teams
played to a 4-4 tie in regulation.
Three straight goals in the second peri
od put Stanford up 4-2 in Friday's game,
but a pair of Bruin goals in the first half of
the third locked the game up at 4-4.
But with 9:40 to go in the game, junior
faku Ide buried the game-winning goal,
his third of the game, from seniors Bobby
Jarosand Randy Gullett. Jaros added a pair
of insurance goals later in the period to give
him a hat trick as well.
Senior goaltender Jay Desai recorded 30
saves in the win.
Tempers flared during the game when
Stanford senior Paul Bastian was ejected for
kneeing, and things boiled over after the
final whistle when a scuffle on the ice
cleared the benches. Bastian, senior Garrett
Goldberg and junior Jamie Gull were all
suspended for Saturday's game.
Ide and Jaros each had a pair of goals on
Saturday, as Stanford outshot the Bruins
50-44. Alex Renfrew came up with 40 saves
for the Cardinal in regulation, but he could
only stop one of UCLA's first four attempts
in the shootout.
Stanford improved to 2-3-1 with the re
sults. The Cardinal started the year with a
pair of losses to Boise State on Oct. 11 and
Oct. 12 before rebounding with an 8-6 win
over Northern Arizona on Oct. 18 behind
five goals from Jaros. Fresno Suite rolled
over the Cardinal 11-0 on Oct. 19.
The Stanford skaters will head up to Eu

cross country competition, tackling three
laps on a treacherous eight-mile course.
Michael Cleary overcame cold, thin air and
frozen water bottles to finish the 24-mile
race in 24th to lead the Stanford men's con
tingent. Kevin Weng was close behind in
27th, and Rob Becker rounded out the
Cardinal lineup in 52nd.
Stanford's performance was pushed
higher by the women's squad, with Ashley
Fonts posting an impressive seventh-place
finish, followed by Whitney Hopkins in
14th and Yayoi Takamura in 24th. The
women finished fourth in the event overall.
The Stanford women also stepped up
for the team in the brutal dual slalom
event, which the men on the team side
stepped. Hopkins braved the course,
which took out more than a few riders, for
a ninth-place finish.
The run-in with the law came on the
Saturday night of the competition as the
Cardinal riders were preparing to enter a
team in the unofficial naked criterium
race. Local police apprehended someone
in the Stanford party, though the team
was able to negotiate the accused's release
a few hours later.
Following that snafu, the team took part
in the final downhill competition on Sun
day, though after some very intense prac
tice runs, only three Cardinal riders en
tered the race. Few riders made it across t he
line with their bikes and bodies in good con
dition after the steep, hazard-lined course.
A lost chain on her bike wasn't enough to
keep Hopkins from finishing eighth, while
Tenille Smith managed to complete the
course in bare feet and a blown fork in 10th

place. Weng made it down the slope un
harmed but could only manage a 47th
place finish.
Ice Hockey fights for four points at UCLA
The Stanford club ice hockey team came
away with a win and a tie from a rough-and
tumble weekend in Los Angeles against Pa
cific-8 Conference rival UCLA.
A postgame bench-clearing brawl after
the Cardinal's 7-4 win over the Bruins on
Friday resulted in suspensions that left
Stanford shorthanded for the teams' re
match on Saturday. UCLA took the second
game 3-1 in a shootout after the teams
played to a 4-4 tie in regulation.
Three straight goals in the second peri
od put Stanford up 4-2 in Friday's game,
but a pair of Bruin goals in the first half of
the third locked the game up at 4-4.
But with 9:40 to go in the game, junior
faku Ide buried the game-winning goal,
his third of the game, from seniors Bobby
Jarosand Randy Gullett. Jaros added a pair
of insurance goals later in the period to give
him a hat trick as well.
Senior goaltender Jay Desai recorded 30
saves in the win.
Tempers flared during the game when
Stanford senior Paul Bastian was ejected for
kneeing, and things boiled over after the
final whistle when a scuffle on the ice
cleared the benches. Bastian, senior Garrett
Goldberg and junior Jamie Gull were all
suspended for Saturday's game.
Ide and Jaros each had a pair of goals on
Saturday, as Stanford outshot the Bruins
50-44. Alex Renfrew came up with 40 saves
for the Cardinal in regulation, but he could
only stop one of UCLA's first four attempts
in the shootout.
Stanford improved to 2-3-1 with the re
sults. The Cardinal started the year with a
pair of losses to Boise State on Oct. 11 and
Oct. 12 before rebounding with an 8-6 win
over Northern Arizona on Oct. 18 behind
five goals from Jaros. Fresno Suite rolled
over the Cardinal 11-0 on Oct. 19.
The Stanford skaters will head up to Eu
gene this weekend fora pair of matches
with Pac-8 rival Oregon.
