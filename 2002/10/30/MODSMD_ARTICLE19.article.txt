# Card finishes second at FPCC
## Frush and Mehraein lead sailing to second-place finish behind Trojans

The Cardinal sailing team prepared
for the distant future last weekend. Stan
ford hosted the Fall Pacific Coast Cham
pionships at its home sailing center as a
warm up for the Collegiate National
Championships that will take place this
June in Detroit.
If last weekend was any indication of
possible success in Michigan, then the
team can expect to make a good showing
at the season's final meet.
The Cardinal placed second at the
FPCC, scoring a 59 and coming in a
mere four points behind triumphant
Southern California.
Stanford faced competition from six
other schools in windy conditions.
Coach Jay Kehoe commented on his
sailors' capability to maintain control of
the boats in winds as strong as 15 knots,
saying it was "thanks to the strength
training they have done with trainer
Ryan Capretta."
Stanford's B-Division team was
particularly solid this weekend, due
primarily to the good work of skipper
Ashley Frush and crew Shadi
Mehraein, both juniors. The two
proved their consistency with several
finishes in the top-three and their ver
satility with impressive racing in vari
ous wind conditions. In the end, the
Cardinal B-Division tied with
Hawaii's Sam Howard and Sarah
Reed for first place.
Stanford also had a second B-Divi
sion team ofjunior skipper Liz Rountree
and freshman crew Diana Ly that fin
ished fifth. Combined, the two teams
earned sixth place in B-Division.
Stanford's A-Division lacked such
consistency, as junior skipper Jen
nifer Porter and sophomore crew
Jessie Duncan struggled with light
winds in the morning, earning one
seventh and two sixth places in the
day's early races.
Kehoe commented that the duo
"seemed to be having a rough day"
until the gathering winds helped the A-
Division duo to a more successful sec
ond half of the regatta. The two placed

first, second and third in three races in
an impressive comeback, but the poor
performance of the morning meant
that the Cardinal ultimately placed
only fifth in the A-Division.
Stanford was also represented by a
second team in the A-Division, com
prised of skipper Liz Shearer and crew

Margia Corner, both juniors. Shearer
and Corner beat out teammates Porter
and Duncan by two points to place
fourth.
The Cardinal's next challenge will
occur Nov. 1 through Nov. 3 when Stan
ford sails at the Sloop Nationals at Brown
Universitvin Rhode Island.
