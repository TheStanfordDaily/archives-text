# Barnes reaches finals at regional
## Freshman leads womenâ€™s tennis team in her first collegiate tournament 
### MIKE SCOTTO 
For the second consecutive year at the
ITA Northwest Regional, a Stanford
freshman has impressed her region and
left a lingering impact on the upcoming
season.
Last year, then-freshman Erin Bur
dette fought her way to a singles victory
that propelled her remarkable rookie
season. This time around, it was fresh
man Alice Barnes who promptly turned
her first-ever college tournament into a
stomping ground over the competition.
Although Barnes lost a tough three
set match 7-6(4), 3-6, 6-1 in the singles
final to California's Raquel Kops-Jones
yesterday, Barnes is now assured a spot
in next month's ITA National Indoor
Championships with her second-place
finish at the regionals held Friday to
Tuesday.

The top-seeded team of Burdette
and junior Lauren Barnikow teamed
up to win the doubles championship.
Alter both were upset in singles play,
the duo rebounded in impressive fash
ion with resounding victories in the
doubles bracket.
"Doubles-wise, 1 got some matches in,
and in singles I got some matches in to
see what I need to work on," Barnikow
said. "It was good to just get back in to
doubles matches and to win. It feels
good to win."
Another great Stanford performance
was contributed by sophomore Story
Tweedie-Yates. After falling in the first
round of the main singles draw, she
fought through grueling matches to win
the back draw of the tournament.
Her toughness was evident in the
overpowering forehands and first serves
she displayed, even in her fifth set of play
on Monday. After a lengthy three-set
win on Monday morning against Vida
Senci of Idaho, Tweedie-Yates prompt
ly defeated her next opponent, Janelle
Kaloi of Santa Clara, 6-4, 6-2, a few
hours later.

"You never want anybody to lose
their first round match, but when you
get into the back draw, it gives you a
chance to play a lot of matches, and
that's what she needed right now," Stan
ford coach Lele Forood said.
The road to the final was by no
means easy for the poised Barnes. She
unluckily faced second-seeded
Barnikow in the quarterfinals.
"It was a shame that 1 had to play
Lauren," the 16th-seeded Barnes said,
adding that she was happy with her first
tournament.
After defeating Barnikow 6-2, 6-4,
Barnes wore down her semifinal oppo
nent, 13th-seeded Margarita Kar
naukhova of Sacramento State, with her
smart and consistent play in a 6-3, 6-2
victory. Even with the finals loss, Barnes
will still be able to further showcase her
talent at the Indoor Championships
next month in Dallas.
"Alice gets to go to Dallas, regardless
of the outcome of that match," Forood
said. "We'll get to see what she can do
against players from around the
country."
Without a doubt, the Stanford
team met or exceeded all expecta
tions in this tournament.
"1 think our team did amazing.
We came out, and we showed peo
ple in our region what we can do,"
Barnikow said. "Other people na
tionally will see this."
Forood was pleased overall with
her team's resilient effort at home.
"We've had some good perfor
mances, especially Alice, who we
hadn't had a chance to see play at
the college competition level yet,"
Forood said. " This has given us a
really good idea of where she fits in.
I'm sure Erin's a little disappointed
with where she is right now, but she
concentrated on school this sum
mer and has taken a little longer to
bounce back this fall."
One aspect of the squad high
lighted by the regional was the
depth of the Cardinal.
"Alice goes to the final, two of us
make quarters, Story wins the back
draw, and in doubles we had quar
ters and winners. I think we might
have done the best overall,"
Barnikow said.
Team depth and endurance
were essential, as most of the Car
dinal players were playing in both
the singles and doubles draws. A
battered Kops-Jones cited her
training as the key to her strength.
The fifth-seeded Cal player list
ed many keys to her victory, in
cluding her focus on every point
and her game plan of hitting hard
to Barnes' forehand. Additionally,
she felt that she had earned respect
with this performance.
Although it was a fairly signifi
cant competition, this tournament
also served multiple purposes for
Stanford.
"We were excited to get to tour
nament play because we've just
been practicing for about a month,"
Barnikow said. "Only a few of us
played the previous tournament
down at the [IT A] Ail-American
[Championship, three weeks ago],
so I think it Was important to get the
competitiveness back."
The regional was the first

chance that all of the Cardinal
freshmen have had to familiarize
themselves with live competition,
so the experience the tournament
at home provided was as impor
tant as winning.
"This is as much as I've played
in a little while because you come
to [the] University and start prac

tice, but you don't play matches for
the first few weeks," Barnes said.
Due to her lack of previous ex
perience, Barnes stated that she
was "pleasantly surprised" with
her play.
Barnes, Barnikow and Bur
dette will travel to Dallas for the In
door Championships on Nov. 8.
