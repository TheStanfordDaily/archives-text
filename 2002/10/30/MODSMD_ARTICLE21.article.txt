# Preseason basketball exactly the way it should be: Ugly vs. Evil
## 
### 
I couldn't have drawn up a better start
to the NBA season than what was de
livered during last Friday night's
Lakers-Kings preseason matchup on
ESPN. Fora meaningless preseason game,
this contest gave so much. A rematch of ar
guably the best Western Conference Final
series of all time, a first encounter between
two bitter foes who have aspirations of du
eling it out for the NBA title, a team look
ing to defend itself against an ambiguous
ly homosexual euphemism and a full
fledged brawl that spilled into the tunnel
under the stands.
To any serious sports fan, what didn't
this game have that you could possibly have
wanted as a beginning to the season? First
and foremost, you had a no-holds-barred

grudge match between
Rick Fox — the talentless,
pretty boy, small forward
husband of Vanessa
Williams, who is quite pos
sibly the least deserving
human being to ever wear
three rings for any reason
— and Doug Christie —
the defensive "scrapper"

who plays I) tighter than odor on fecal mat
ter (my editors won't let me use the real ex
pression in the presence of people with dig
nity) and backs it up with looks that would
scare even Janet Reno's husband.
Fox instigated the light, causing both
players to be ejected, then laid in waiting
for the unsuspecting Christie as he exited

the floor into the tunnel. Fox pounced on
his quarry, engaged him in a headlock,
and mad flailing of limbs and unkind ver
biage ensued. I get goose bumps just writ
ing about it. I only wish 1 had one of those
cool Crocodile Hunter accents to give a
play-by-play recount of the predator vs.
prey struggle.
But while premeditated, infantile vio
lence from grown men, who earn more
than every anger management counselor
put together, is all well and good, this
game featured so much more. Too often
in sporting events, we are bombarded with
shots of chiseled, handsome athletes
whose looks put the average man to
shame. But not in any games featuring this
Sacramento Kings team. Watching Mike

Bibby, Christie, Vlade Divac, Hedo
Turkoglu and Scott Pollard all share the
same floor is like running an ad for unat
tractive people exclaiming, "You too can
be rich and famous!"
I can just imagine Chris Webber and
Peja Stojakavic devising strategies on how
to avoid having to be seen on the town
with the Goon Squad that is the rest of
their team.
"Umm, yeah, sorry guys, it's not that we
don't want to hang out, it's just that Tyra
has an image to keep up for her modeling
career, and being seen with you guys . . .
we 11... you know. No offense, I mean,
there's always surgery, right?"
Most importantly, however, this game
eventually saw evil be defeated at the

hands of a marginally lesser evil. The
Shaq-less Lakers fell at the hands of the
team the Big Arthritis himself had dubbed
the "Sacramento Queens."
Ugly won out against pretty. The
young man with the estranged father tri
umphed over the young man with the im
mense ego. The indicted former Fab Fiver
vanquished the arthritic former Fu-
Schnicken. And the Yugoslavians finally
won something (good for them).
A lot ol questions remain to be an
swered that will ultimately determine the
course of the upcoming NBA season and
which team winds up taking home the
title. VVill the Lakers have the desire to win
