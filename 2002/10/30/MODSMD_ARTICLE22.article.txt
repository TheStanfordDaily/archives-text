### 
BOULDER, Colo. (AP) —
Olympic skier Jeremy Bloom
says he will meet with his football
coach at Colorado to determine
which skiing competitions he
might be able to pursue after
football season.
Bloom, a freshman wide receiv
er and kick returner on the Col
orado football team, recently re
ceived the World Cup lineup and
training schedule. He said Mon
day that he plans to meet with Col
orado coach Gary Barnett this
week to discuss what football oblig
ations he can miss to pursue com
petitive skiing.
"It's just to figure out the sched
ule," Bloom said. "When I can go,
when 1 can get a couple of days here
and there and figure all of that out
so that 1 can have a set basis of
which World Cups 1 can compete
in and which ones 1 can't."
Just how Bloom will fund the
training and the trips is "still an
issue that needs to be taken care
of," he said.
Meanwhile, Bloom says he has
not decided whether he will stay at
Colorado after his freshman sea
son. When lie officially announced
he would fulfill a lifelong dream

and play college football and sever
all endorsement contracts, he left
the door open to possibly playing a
season or two, then leaving to pur
sue skiing.
Bloom did say that he is consid
ering another court appeal to give
him a chance to earn endorsement
money from skiing while still play
ing college football.
On Oct. 10, Boulder District
Court Judge Daniel Hale denied a
motion to reconsider Bloom's re
quest for an injunction against the
NCAA rules preventing him from
accepting skiing endorsements
while playing football.
Bloom, who has a part in the
new Warren Miller extreme ski
movie "Storm" due out next week,
says his choice to play college foot
ball was a good one.
"It's been nothing short of in
credible," Bloom said. "College
football has got to be one of the
best things in the world."
Bloom, who competed in the
freestyle competition at the Salt
Lake City Olympics, has scored
two big-play touchdowns this
season, one on a 75-yard punt
return and the other on a 94-
yard reception.
