## Psychologists pioneer research on terrorism New research center is devoted to studying terrorism psychology 
### MICHAEL MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford may be on the other
side of the country and removed
from the Sept. 1 1 terrorist at
tacks, but that doesn't isolate the
community from their psycholog
ical effects. "Seventeen percent of
the population outside of New
York City reported symptoms of
Sept. 11-related posttraumatic
stress two months after the at
tacks," said a recent report in the
Journal of the American Medical
Association.
Addressing the psychological
effects of terrorism, experts gath
ered this month at a conference in
Palo Alto sponsored in part by the
Stanford Department of Psychol
ogy. The conference was hosted
by the newly established National
Center of Disaster Psychology
and Terrorism at the Pacific
Graduate School of Psychology.
Terrorism is by definition a
psychological act, and victims of
terrorism must learn to under
stand it and cope with it. Phil Zim
bardo, professor of psychology
and president of the American
Psychological Association, Bruce
Bongar, consulting professor of
psychology, and Larry Beutler,
president-elect of clinical emer
gencies and crises in the Ameri
can Psychological Association
founded the new center to answer
some of the many questions that
terrorism raises.
"When there's an act of terror
ism, a small but significant per
centage of the population will be
quite vulnerable [to the psycho
logical effects)," Bongar said. "We
need to know if there are things
we can do to make people more
psychologically resistant to ter
rorism," he said.
The three leading experts on
psychology are in the process of
writing a book on terrorism psy
chology, as the work at the con

ference will be published as the
Oxford Hook on Disaster Psy
chology and Terrorism, contain
ing more than 50 chapters.
The new center is designed to
study all types of terrorism, and
Bongar sees a special need to
study and prepare for bioterror
ism and chemical attacks. The
center has partnered with the
Veterans Affairs Palo Alto
Health Care System and the Na
tional Red Cross to train first re
sponders.
According to Bongar, there
were hundreds of medical per
sonnel at the scene on Sept. 11,
but almost none had any training
relating to the specific effects of
terrorism. In the case of a large
biological or chemical attack, the
first responders around the
country would be strained, as
everyone would have to deal
much more directly with the psy
chological effects of the attacks.
"There aren't a lot of people
with scientific training working in
this field," Bongar said, referring
to how little psychological train
ing most first responders get. The
center wants to first examine the
clinical side of terrorism psychol
ogy through its partnership with
Palo Alto VA, which has expertise
on posttraumatic stress disorder.
"The first goal of the center is
to train mental health profession
als on how to respond to the
needs of the population following
terrorist threats and attacks,"
Bongar said.
Beyond training personnel,
the founders hope that the center
will become the definitive re
search locus on the terrorism psy
chology. Bongar said,"We want
to create a think tank where the
best minds in psychology and so
cial science can visit, brainstorm
and improve the thinking on ter
rorism."
There is no equivalent center
in the U.S., and there is no cen
tralized resource for information
about what should occur before
or after a terrorist attack to miti
gate its psychological dangers.

formation as well as the doctors.
"Our goal is to try to get real in
formation out instead ofpsychob
abble," said Joel Shurkin, a
spokesman for the center.
"Our other goal is to study the
effects of how to live with it,"
Shurkin said. "For example, no
one knows the psychological re
sults on children."
Shurkin hinted at the vacuum

of knowledge concerning terror
ism — from why terrorists behave
as they do to what demographic
groups are most affected by ter
rorism-induced posttraumatic
stress. The conference was seen as
a way to determine what is known
and what needs to be studied.
Ariel Merari, professor of psy
chology at Tel Aviv University,
was the plenary speaker at the
conference. He spoke on the mo
tives behind suicidal terrorism
and hinted at the vast realms of
psychological knowledge yet to be
discovered and researched. He

explained how the caricatures of
suicide bombers as dedicated
martyrs ignore the strong ele
ments of psychological manipula
tion and peer pressure that influ
ence them.
Other speakers described how
terrorists aim their attacks to de
liver psychological blows and how
volcanoes in New Zealand can
give clues to how to set up an ef
fective quick response system.
"The conference was a major
success," Bongar said. "It out
lined what we know and [what we]
don't know."

biological or chemical attack, the
first responders around the
country would be strained, as
everyone would have to deal
much more directly with the psy
chological effects of the attacks.
"There aren't a lot of people
with scientific training working in
this field," Bongar said, referring
to how little psychological train
ing most first responders get. The
center wants to first examine the
clinical side of terrorism psychol
ogy through its partnership with
Palo Alto VA, which has expertise
on posttraumatic stress disorder.
"The first goal of the center is
to train mental health profession
als on how to respond to the
needs of the population following
terrorist threats and attacks,"
Bongar said.
Beyond training personnel,
the founders hope that the center
will become the definitive re
search locus on the terrorism psy
chology. Bongar said,"We want
to create a think tank where the
best minds in psychology and so
cial science can visit, brainstorm
and improve the thinking on ter
rorism."
There is no equivalent center
in the U.S., and there is no cen

about what should occur before
or after a terrorist attack to miti
gate its psychological dangers.

"Our goal is to try to get real in
formation out instead ofpsychob
abble," said Joel Shurkin, a
spokesman for the center.
"Our other goal is to study the
effects of how to live with it,"
Shurkin said. "For example, no
one knows the psychological re
sults on children."
Shurkin hinted at the vacuum

of knowledge concerning terror
ism — from why terrorists behave
as they do to what demographic
groups are most affected by ter
rorism-induced posttraumatic
stress. The conference was seen as
a way to determine what is known
and what needs to be studied.
Ariel Merari, professor of psy
chology at Tel Aviv University,
was the plenary speaker at the
conference. He spoke on the mo
tives behind suicidal terrorism
and hinted at the vast realms of
psychological knowledge yet to be
discovered and researched. He

explained how the caricatures of
suicide bombers as dedicated
martyrs ignore the strong ele
ments of psychological manipula
tion and peer pressure that influ
ence them.
Other speakers described how
terrorists aim their attacks to de
liver psychological blows and how
volcanoes in New Zealand can
give clues to how to set up an ef
fective quick response system.
"The conference was a major
success," Bongar said. "It out
lined what we know and [what we]
don't know."
Stanford may be on the other
side of the country and removed
from the Sept. 1 1 terrorist at
tacks, but that doesn't isolate the
community from their psycholog
ical effects. "Seventeen percent of
the population outside of New
York City reported symptoms of
Sept. 11-related posttraumatic
stress two months after the at
tacks," said a recent report in the
Journal of the American Medical
Association.
Addressing the psychological
effects of terrorism, experts gath
ered this month at a conference in
Palo Alto sponsored in part by the
Stanford Department of Psychol
ogy. The conference was hosted
by the newly established National
Center of Disaster Psychology
and Terrorism at the Pacific
Graduate School of Psychology.
Terrorism is by definition a
psychological act, and victims of
terrorism must learn to under
stand it and cope with it. Phil Zim
bardo, professor of psychology
and president of the American
Psychological Association, Bruce
Bongar, consulting professor of
psychology, and Larry Beutler,
president-elect of clinical emer
gencies and crises in the Ameri
can Psychological Association
founded the new center to answer
some of the many questions that
terrorism raises.
"When there's an act of terror
ism, a small but significant per
centage of the population will be
quite vulnerable [to the psycho
logical effects)," Bongar said. "We
need to know if there are things
we can do to make people more
psychologically resistant to ter
rorism," he said.
The three leading experts on
psychology are in the process of
writing a book on terrorism psy
chology, as the work at the con

ference will be published as the
Oxford Hook on Disaster Psy
chology and Terrorism, contain
ing more than 50 chapters.
The new center is designed to
study all types of terrorism, and
Bongar sees a special need to
study and prepare for bioterror
ism and chemical attacks. The
center has partnered with the
Veterans Affairs Palo Alto
Health Care System and the Na
tional Red Cross to train first re
sponders.
According to Bongar, there
were hundreds of medical per
sonnel at the scene on Sept. 11,
but almost none had any training
relating to the specific effects of
terrorism. In the case of a large
biological or chemical attack, the
first responders around the
country would be strained, as
everyone would have to deal
much more directly with the psy
chological effects of the attacks.
"There aren't a lot of people
