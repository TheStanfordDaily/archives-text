# Davis promotes education, technology

### JOHN SHAPIRO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Speaking at the Tech Net Town
Hall meeting last Tuesday, Cali
fornia Gov. Gray Davis stressed the
links between education and the
future technological success. Ac
cording to its Web site, "Tech Net is
a national network of executives
from the nation's leading technol
ogy companies." According to the
organization's co-founder, John
Doerr, Tech Net has education as a
priority and is "first and foremost
trying to improve public education
in California."
During the meeting, Davis
noted, "I am a great believer that
we all stand on someone else's
shoulders, that the opportunities
we have today are the result of
someone else's investment, sacri
fice and hard work."
He added, "we have an obliga
tion to make such investments in
our children, to give them oppor
tunities we didn't have. That's the
American story: each generation
doing its best to make life better for
the next generation."
This obligation is deeply rooted
in education. But, it is one area
that is not possible to leave un
tended.
"One of the things California
needs to understand is that educa
tion is not what it used to be even
10 years ago," said state senator Liz
Figueroa during an interview after
the meeting.
Figueroa commented that cur
rent educational reform is not
enough. "In one school district, we
have 153 different languages spo
ken," she said. "1 personally feel
that there are a lot of holes that we
are filling, that are problems that
are in fact very huge. I would liter
ally start from scratch on a lot of
primary things."
Still, the effort to improve

schools has not been in vain.
"When 1 took office in the last
year of the 20th century, California
schools were 50th out of 50 or 49th
out 0f50," Davis said. "We are mak
ing great progress. We've invested
in teacher training. We've invested
in more technology and modern
textbooks. The bottom line is that
test scores are up four years in a
row. Children are on the right path.
People are excited about education
and volunteering at schools. We still
have a long way to go, but we've
made great strides in 4 years. We
just have to stay the course."
Both Davis and Figueroa spoke
about the necessity of community
mentorship to promote improved
education. "We have more and
more companies that are doing
[mentoring]," Figueroa said. "We
need more and more of that. It's a

partnership. Educating a child is
educating the entire community."
"Clearly, the best possible result
would be for more California-edu
cated students to go into technolo
gy," Davis said. "We have encour
aged community colleges and Cal
State systems to promote mentor
ship on campus, and they have
greatly increased by a factor of 10
the number of volunteer hours."
Roger Salazar, press sec retary of
the Governor Gray Davis Commit
tee, added that "for many years
now, Silicon Valley has been the
economic engine of California;
technology, along with agriculture,
is what has made this state's econo
my the fifth largest in the world."
That is, if California were to
suddenly separate itself economi
cally from the rest of the United
States, it would have an economy

larger than all but four countries.
In addition, "In 2004, [California]
will pass the UK and become the
4th largest economy in the world,"
Davis said.
The governor also stressed the
importance of investment in tech
nology and intellectual wealth.
"You will not find a place that of
fers more opportunity, provides a
better higher education, or offers
more promise than California," he
said. "This is because California
has more research universities
than anyone else, and they create
intellectual wealth. We have 12.
One other state, Massachusetts,
has seven. No other state has more
than six."
"Fifty years ago, there was no
Silicon Valley. Thirty years ago,
there was no biotech industry. Ten
years ago, there was no internet.
It's amazing how quickly invest
ments pay dividends."
I n regards to technology and in
novation, Davis said, "Technology
is a big piece of the response to a
terrorist attack. The federal gov
ernment is working with the
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory
and a number of companies in the
Valley." Yet, when asked about de
veloping an anti-hijacking system,
Davis said that he didn't have
enough information to answer.
Four new research centers have
been created in California as well.
"One of the investments I'm
proudest of is creating four centers
of science and innovation," Davis
said. "There's nothing of this scale
anywhere in the world."
The Institute of Nanosystems at
UCLA, Institute of Information
Technology at UC-Berkeley, the
Institute of Biotechnology at
UCSF and the Institute of
Telecommunications at UCSD are
the four private research centers
that Davis helped create on public
campuses.
