For any given class, you'll read
hundreds of pages of material.
Finding that one particular note
you highlighted, but don't remem
ber where can be exasperating and
quite a waste of time. The Super-
Pen from Wizcom attempts to
solve that problem.
Shaped like an oversized pen,
the Super Pen features and optical
scanner and LCI) screen. It com
bines the Quick Link II and
Quicktionary, which means it can
scan full lines of printed informa
tion, store it and then upload it to
your computer or personal digital
assistant. This allows taking notes
and having them instantly avail
able for annotation or citation in
papers.
The Super Pen also function as a
translator. Any word in English
scanned is translated on the LCD
screen. The Super Pen includes 15
dictionaries including Spanish,
German, Chinese (simplified and
traditional), Japanese, Korean and
French.
Unfortunately, the Super Pen is
not 100 percent accurate. Often
two or three passes are required to
correctly scan in a line of text. Also,
the recognition phase takes up to

five seconds between lines.
However, the idea is novel, and
Wizcom's line of products contain
the only mobile text scanners avail
able to quickly input information.
The Super Pen is $199 and is avail
able at http://www.wizcomtech.

How many times have you

only to discover you have a meet
ing fora club that same time?
Considering how involved the typ
ical Stanford student is, such a sit
uation is far from unlikely.
Though PDAs have been able to
keep calendars, current models
can do much more.
One gadget worth checking out
is the Toshiba e330 / 335, which is
based on the Windows CE operat

Word and Pocket Excel, allowing
you to edit papers orecon problem
sets on the Pocket PC, and then
synchronize the new data with
your original file on the computer.
There are two options for text
input: handwriting recognition
and onscreen keyboard. The
handwriting recognition inputs
letters one by one and is quite ac
curate.
