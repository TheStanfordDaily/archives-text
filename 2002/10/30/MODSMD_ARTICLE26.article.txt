# Bridging the ’gap between life sciences and technology’
## Students, Profs share research at BCATS

Building computational models of proteins
to understand how they fold. Imaging arteries
to identify atherosclerosis. Aligning genetic se
quences to understand their evolutionary rela
tion. These are just some examples of how
computer technology can solve some of the
most pressing questions in biology.
The emerging field is known as computa
tional biology, and students, professors and in
dustry leaders 112 rom a wide range of disciplines
had the opportunity to share their research
thoughts at a conference called "Biomedical

Computation at Stanford 2002" (BCATS) last
Saturday.
Now in its third year, the conference drew
over 400 attendees from a wide spectrum of
academia and industry. The goal of the sympo
sium was "to get all the people in biocomputa
tion together to talk," according to one of the
lecturers, Michael Brudno, a doctoral student
in computer science.
Brudno's lecture, entitled "Multiple Ge
nomic Sequence Alignment" addressed how
multiple sequence alignments (a series of relat
ed sequences) can improve protein compar
isons. Indeed, his lab has developed algorithms
that allow quicker and better comparisons be

tween proteins, contributing to a greater un
derstanding of protein structure and function.
Brudno's talk was one of 12 during the day.
Most of the speakers were graduate students,
sometimes accompanied by a professor.
Leonard Sibilie, a graduate student in com
puter science working under Prof. Jean-
Claude Latombe, presented "Interactive Simu
lation of the Human Hand," about how artifi
cial intelligence and algorithms were used to
model the structure and movements of the
human hand.
