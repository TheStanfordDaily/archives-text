# Bridging the ’gap between life sciences and technology’
## Students, Profs share research at BCATS 
### AMIT GARG STAFF WRITER 
Building computational models of proteins
to understand how they fold. Imaging arteries
to identify atherosclerosis. Aligning genetic se
quences to understand their evolutionary rela
tion. These are just some examples of how
computer technology can solve some of the
most pressing questions in biology.
The emerging field is known as computa
tional biology, and students, professors and in
dustry leaders 112 rom a wide range of disciplines
had the opportunity to share their research
thoughts at a conference called "Biomedical

Computation at Stanford 2002" (BCATS) last
Saturday.
Now in its third year, the conference drew
over 400 attendees from a wide spectrum of
academia and industry. The goal of the sympo
sium was "to get all the people in biocomputa
tion together to talk," according to one of the
lecturers, Michael Brudno, a doctoral student
in computer science.
Brudno's lecture, entitled "Multiple Ge
nomic Sequence Alignment" addressed how
multiple sequence alignments (a series of relat
ed sequences) can improve protein compar
isons. Indeed, his lab has developed algorithms
that allow quicker and better comparisons be

tween proteins, contributing to a greater un
derstanding of protein structure and function.
Brudno's talk was one of 12 during the day.
Most of the speakers were graduate students,
sometimes accompanied by a professor.
Leonard Sibilie, a graduate student in com
puter science working under Prof. Jean-
Claude Latombe, presented "Interactive Simu
lation of the Human Hand," about how artifi
cial intelligence and algorithms were used to
model the structure and movements of the
human hand.

Visitors could browse posters and ask questions to the presenters to learn
more about computational biology at the BCATS conference last Saturday.
medical informatics working
under Dr. Mark Musen, talked
about "Knowledge-Based Public
Health Surveillance." He demon
strated how rule-based algo
rithms and ontologies (controlled
terminologies) could be applied
towards analyzing the public
health system.
In addition to the scientific
talks, the conference included two
keynote speakers, Dr. Mark Bo
guski, visiting investigator from
the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Re
search Center in Seattle, and Dr.
Isaac Kohane, associate professor
of pediatrics from Harvard Med
ical School and director of the
Children's Hospital Informatics
Program at Boston. Both speakers
discussed the successes and chal
lenges of using technology to solve
biological questions.
There were also two poster ses
sions with a total of 48 posters. Vis
itors could navigate through the
different topics, ask questions and
learn more about the diversity in
the field of computational biology.
Shuo Liu, a graduate student in
medical informatics, presented his
work with Dr. Russ Altman. His re
search is entitled "Alternative

Splicing: Data Storage and Analy
sis" and considers how eukaryotes
(cells with a nucleus) can make dif
ferent proteins by translating the
same gene differently.
Another poster was "Endo
scope calibration and Accurate
Testing for 3D/2D Image Regis
tration," whose primary author is
Michael Bax, a graduate student in
neurosurgery working under Dr.
Ramin Shahidi. Shahidi has been a
pioneer in medical imaging, and
Bax analyzed how endoscopy (ex
amining internal organs) can be
improved.
The wide range of presenta
tions reflected the interdiscipli
nary nature of the field. l)e
-vshruti Pahuja, a master's stu
dent in scientific computing /
computational mathematics,
who was one of the organizers,
said, "We are covering all fields,
from medical devices to imaging
to medical informatics."
A variety of people attended the
conference. Sanders Chong, a se
nior majoring in computer sci
ence, said, "I became interested in
biocomputation last spring after
taking C 5262 [Computational Ge
nomics]. Although I do not fully
understand the biology, this is a
great place to learn more about it."
He added that the variety of re
search presented at the conference
helped "bridge the gap between

life sciences and technology."
Indeed, the "gap between life
sciences and technology" is fuzzy.
"Computational biology" is a
broad term that includes several
overlapping subfields. For exam
ple, informatics deals primarily
with using computers to solve bio
logical or medical questions, while
biotechnology describes how com
panies use technology to synthe
size drugs and genomics focuses
on gene research.
BCATS and other similar con
ferences demonstrate the Univer
sity's effort to integrate computer
science and biology to promote the
growth of a biocomputation com
munity. At the undergraduate
level, the programs in symbolic
systems, human biology and com
puter science allow students to de
sign a concentration in computa
tional biology. At the graduate
level, the Stanford Medical Infor
matics ("enter offers a course in
biomedical informatics.
The largest step to expand
bioinformatics will come next fall
with the inauguration of the $400
million Bio-X program. Bio-X is a
program designed to integrate
cutting-edge research in basic, ap
plied and clinical sciences to allow
biological discoveries. It will likely
capitalize on the emerging tech
nologies and computational power
that were presented at BCATS.

The largest step to expand
bioinformatics will come next fall
with the inauguration of the $400
million Bio-X program. Bio-X is a
program designed to integrate
cutting-edge research in basic, ap

biological discoveries. It will likely
capitalize on the emerging tech

that were presented at BCATS.
Building computational models of proteins
to understand how they fold. Imaging arteries

tion. These are just some examples of how
computer technology can solve some of the
most pressing questions in biology.
The emerging field is known as computa
tional biology, and students, professors and in
dustry leaders 112 rom a wide range of disciplines
had the opportunity to share their research
thoughts at a conference called "Biomedical

Computation at Stanford 2002" (BCATS) last
Saturday.
Now in its third year, the conference drew
over 400 attendees from a wide spectrum of
academia and industry. The goal of the sympo
sium was "to get all the people in biocomputa
tion together to talk," according to one of the
lecturers, Michael Brudno, a doctoral student
in computer science.
Brudno's lecture, entitled "Multiple Ge
nomic Sequence Alignment" addressed how
multiple sequence alignments (a series of relat
ed sequences) can improve protein compar
isons. Indeed, his lab has developed algorithms
that allow quicker and better comparisons be

tween proteins, contributing to a greater un
derstanding of protein structure and function.
Brudno's talk was one of 12 during the day.
Most of the speakers were graduate students,
sometimes accompanied by a professor.
Leonard Sibilie, a graduate student in com
puter science working under Prof. Jean-
Claude Latombe, presented "Interactive Simu
lation of the Human Hand," about how artifi
cial intelligence and algorithms were used to
model the structure and movements of the
human hand.

Visitors could browse posters and ask questions to the presenters to learn
more about computational biology at the BCATS conference last Saturday.
medical informatics working
under Dr. Mark Musen, talked
about "Knowledge-Based Public
Health Surveillance." He demon
strated how rule-based algo
rithms and ontologies (controlled
terminologies) could be applied
towards analyzing the public
health system.
In addition to the scientific
talks, the conference included two
keynote speakers, Dr. Mark Bo
guski, visiting investigator from
the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Re
search Center in Seattle, and Dr.
Isaac Kohane, associate professor
of pediatrics from Harvard Med
ical School and director of the
Children's Hospital Informatics
Program at Boston. Both speakers
discussed the successes and chal
lenges of using technology to solve
biological questions.
There were also two poster ses
sions with a total of 48 posters. Vis
itors could navigate through the
different topics, ask questions and
learn more about the diversity in
the field of computational biology.
Shuo Liu, a graduate student in
medical informatics, presented his
work with Dr. Russ Altman. His re
search is entitled "Alternative

Splicing: Data Storage and Analy
sis" and considers how eukaryotes
(cells with a nucleus) can make dif
ferent proteins by translating the
same gene differently.
Another poster was "Endo
scope calibration and Accurate
Testing for 3D/2D Image Regis
tration," whose primary author is
Michael Bax, a graduate student in
neurosurgery working under Dr.
Ramin Shahidi. Shahidi has been a
pioneer in medical imaging, and
Bax analyzed how endoscopy (ex
amining internal organs) can be
improved.
The wide range of presenta
tions reflected the interdiscipli
nary nature of the field. l)e
-vshruti Pahuja, a master's stu
dent in scientific computing /
computational mathematics,
who was one of the organizers,
said, "We are covering all fields,
from medical devices to imaging
to medical informatics."
A variety of people attended the
conference. Sanders Chong, a se
nior majoring in computer sci
ence, said, "I became interested in
biocomputation last spring after
taking C 5262 [Computational Ge
nomics]. Although I do not fully
understand the biology, this is a
great place to learn more about it."
He added that the variety of re
search presented at the conference
helped "bridge the gap between

life sciences and technology."
Indeed, the "gap between life
sciences and technology" is fuzzy.
"Computational biology" is a
broad term that includes several
overlapping subfields. For exam
ple, informatics deals primarily
with using computers to solve bio
logical or medical questions, while
biotechnology describes how com
panies use technology to synthe
size drugs and genomics focuses
on gene research.
BCATS and other similar con
ferences demonstrate the Univer
sity's effort to integrate computer
science and biology to promote the
growth of a biocomputation com
munity. At the undergraduate
level, the programs in symbolic
systems, human biology and com
puter science allow students to de
sign a concentration in computa
tional biology. At the graduate
