# GOTV brings candidates to campus debate
## Event will feature opponents for 21st state assembly seat and Green gubernatorial candidate 
### WHITNEY SADO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Five candidates for the November elections will be
speaking tonight at Kresge Auditorium in an event
organized by the ASSU as part of its "Get Out the
Vote 2002" campaign. The event will feature a
speech by Green Party gubernatorial candidate
Peter Camejo and a debate between Joe Simitian and
Jim Russell, respectively the incumbent Democratic
and challenging Republican candidates for the 21st
state assembly seat.
Get Out the Vote is designed to ensure that elect
ed officials who represent Stanford are advocating
for student issues, and that government policies re
flect student interests. The program has registered
thousands of students to vote and organized teach
ins regarding some of the issues affecting this year's
elections.
"Traditionally, over the last couple of decades or
so, the ASSU has really made an effort to include
voter programs as part of their campaign," said
ASSU Chief of Staff Hunter Hargraves. "Every year,
there seems to be a major political happening right
before elections. For example, this year, it is the issue
of war with Iraq, and it is important in the view of the
ASSU that youth make their voices heard."
Hargraves organized tonight's event after attend
ing a workshop this summer in conjunction with Cal

ifornia Youth Vote and the University of California
and Cal State schools. This workshop taught Har
graves and two other ASSU members how to better
market voting to university students.
"Compared to public California campuses, Stan
ford lacks the extensive state-supported structure of
networking and external liaisons in order to organize
events like this," Hargraves said. "What it does have
is lots of political organizations that are very socially
aware, and they are a real help in getting out the vote
on campus. We have tag-teamed with other groups as
much as possible."
Such groups include the Asian American Students
Association, which lias arranged for Congressman
Mike Honda to speak at a future date, because he is
unable to attend tonight. In seeking speakers, Uni
versity President John Hennessy and ASSU Presi
dent Monica Henestroza co-signed a letter that was
sent to between 80 and 90 candidates. Every state
wide candidate on the Democratic, Republican and
Green Party tickets — in addition to local candidates
from the 21st and 22nd state assembly districts and
the 12th, 14th and 15th congressional districts — was


GINA HSIEH/The Stanford Daily
contacted.
These districts were highlighted because they
include either the University or neighboring lo
cations where many graduate students live.
Tonight's event will include a candidate
forum in debate style between Simitian and
Russell. Greg Conlon, who is running for state
treasurer on the Republican ticket, will also be
speaking. Sarah Karlinsky, a proponent of
Proposition 46, will represent the referendum's
campaign regarding housing.
One of the evening's highlights will be a 20-
ininute speech by Camejo, who recently spoke
at the anti-war rally in San Francisco and is a
friend of former Green presidential candidate
Ralph Nader.
Freshman Joanna Kao was excited by the
prospect of this program.
"I think that this event offers a great oppor
tunity to inform me of the issues involved in my
first California elections," Kao said. "But I'm also
cautious, because this event won't offer all of the
viewpoints involved, because three of the speak
ers are not being countered by their opponents."
Although not all opinions will be equally rep
resented in tonight's event, the ASSU is also
sponsoring a forum on Sunday to further edu
cate voters about the election.
Joseph Natoli, communications director at
the ASSU, said, " The ASSU decided to make it
a priority to increase voter participation in the
Nov. 5 election. The hope is that through bring
ing candidates to campus and other efforts, stu
dents will get out to the polls on Nov. 5, increas
ing the student voice."
