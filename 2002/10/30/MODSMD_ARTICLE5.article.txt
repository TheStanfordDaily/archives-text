portation services and University

agreement to appear in a town
hall meeting open to all students.

stressing "the important role [the
Senate] plays at the University
and all the valuable work fit does]
for the students."
Wais also took the meeting as
an opportunity to clarify some of
the administration's concerns.
"Stanford is not 'cracking
down' on alcohol use," Wais said.
"We are treating students as
adults and continuing the tradi
tion of holding students account
able for their behavior in and out
of the classroom . . . The fact that
three groups on campus are on
alcohol probation is a reflection
on these groups."
ASSU representatives have
also been approached by the ad
ministration to give their opin
ions on the alcohol issue.
"[ The administration] is look
ing for things to do about some of
the incidents," Rodriguez said.
"They are trying to get the stu
dent perspective on these issues
and to get their voices in."
To this end, an alcohol survey
is going to be circulated to ascer
tain general information about
the impact and use of alcohol on
campus.
"Our goal is to educate first,"

Wais said. "We do our best to
manage if policies are violat
ed .. . Consequences will take
place and have taken
place . . . but we aren't on a witch
hunt. Alcohol is a grave concern
for us."
ASSU President Monica Hen
estroza expressed concern about
impending University budget
cuts.
"Student Affairs' budgets are
often cut first," Henestroza said.

Henestroza suggested that
the ASSU take an active role
with the administration to pre
vent extreme action being
taken against the Office of Stu
dent Activities.
"This year's budget cut was
visible and tangible for Stanford
to see," Wais said. "It is possible
that there will be an 8 percent
greater cut this year, but we are
