# Prop 50 funds water projects
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF 
Come November, California voters will be asked to
approve the largest water bond in history — Proposi
tion 50. Its full name says it all: The Water Quality, Sup
ply and Safe Drinking Water Projects Coastal Wetlands
Purchase and Protection Bonds Initiative 0f2002.
As written, the bond includes:
• $955 million to pay fora range of water
projects — including removing contaminants from
drinking water, building desalination plants to re
move salt from ocean water, expanding river park
ways and protecting the state's canals and dams from
terrorists.
• $825 million to cover costs of CalFed projects —
the joint federal-state effort to restore the Sacramen
to-San Joaquin Delta and meet the water demands for
farmers, cities and the environment — through 2005.
• $725 million to pay for regional projects, such as
reducing Southern California's dependence on water
from the Colorado River.
• $950 million to buy coastal properties and restore
ecosystems in Southern California and the Bay Area.
This amounts to a grand total of $3.44 billion. In
the past six years, large water measures, including
Proposition 204 in 1990 and Proposition 13 in 20(H)
witnessed far-reaching support and resulted in near
ly $3 billion for environmentally friendly water-relat

eel projects.
But the latest water bond might not fare as well on
Election Day. Some critics complain that it would leave
out funding for new dams and reservoirs at the ex
pense of initiatives more strongly favored by environ
mentalists. There would also be a state cost of up to $6.9
billion over 30 years to pay off both the principal and
the $3.46 billion interest costs on the bonds.
Advocates of the bill claim that the funds are nec
essary to protect and improve our water systems.
State Sen. Mike Machado, chairman of the Yes on 50
effort, said the initiative is crucial for Cal-Fed to con
tinue because the program is unlikely to receive fund
ing from other state sources.
