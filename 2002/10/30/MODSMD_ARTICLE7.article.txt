# University Press cuts translations and humanities publications
## Controversial decision draws criticism from Stanford faculty 
### ANTHONY HA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Facing financial difficulties, Stanford
University Press recently enacted several
measures intended to reduce losses, cut
ting both the number of editors working
at the press and the number of books

published. This controversial decision
has drawn criticism from several Stan
ford professors, who argue that the cuts
will hurt the press, ihe University and its
faculty.
According to Geoffrey Burn, managing
editor of Stanford University Press, the
new reduction in publication means that
signing expectations in several areas have
dropped: European translations have
been cut from 10 titles per year to three;
scholarly titles in literature, philosophy,
history and religion have been cut from 38
titles to 35; and regional and general in

terest books have been cut from eight titles
to almost zero.
Burn added that the decreased work
load led the press to consolidate the duties
of its two humanities editors to one posi
tion. Three other permanent positions
were removed, two of them to be replaced
by freelancers.
"Our aim has been to protect the core
of our scholarly program while respond
ing to the accelerating erosion of the mar
ket for scholarly books," Burn said. " 1 his
has been driven in large part by consolida
tion in the retail trade, the implosion of the

superstores, and the significant reduction
in library budgets. Also, in response to the
increasing financial pressures felt by all
universities right now, the press is at
tempting to reduce its potential drain on
Stanford University's resources."
Roland Greene, professor of English
and comparative literature and director of
the Division of Literatures, Cultures and
Languages, said that this decision could
do substantial damage to the press's and
the University's reputation. He, along
with several other colleagues, pointed out
that Stanford University Press is currently

seen as one of the leading figures in pub
lishing scholarly work in the humanities.
"I don't know anybody in the humani
ties who doesn't have serious concerns
about the cuts," he said. "This decision will
damage Stanford's reputation, something
that has considerable value beyond
money. Once it is damaged, it will be very
hard to repair."
He added, "The handful of first-rate
university presses is a very select club to be
long to. It seems short-sighted to get out of
