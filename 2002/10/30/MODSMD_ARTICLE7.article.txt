# University Press cuts translations and humanities publications
## Controversial decision draws criticism from Stanford faculty 
### ANTHONY HA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Facing financial difficulties, Stanford
University Press recently enacted several
measures intended to reduce losses, cut
ting both the number of editors working
at the press and the number of books

published. This controversial decision
has drawn criticism from several Stan
ford professors, who argue that the cuts
will hurt the press, ihe University and its
faculty.
According to Geoffrey Burn, managing
editor of Stanford University Press, the
new reduction in publication means that
signing expectations in several areas have
dropped: European translations have
been cut from 10 titles per year to three;
scholarly titles in literature, philosophy,
history and religion have been cut from 38
titles to 35; and regional and general in

terest books have been cut from eight titles
to almost zero.
Burn added that the decreased work
load led the press to consolidate the duties
of its two humanities editors to one posi
tion. Three other permanent positions
were removed, two of them to be replaced
by freelancers.
"Our aim has been to protect the core
of our scholarly program while respond
ing to the accelerating erosion of the mar
ket for scholarly books," Burn said. " 1 his
has been driven in large part by consolida
tion in the retail trade, the implosion of the

superstores, and the significant reduction
in library budgets. Also, in response to the
increasing financial pressures felt by all
universities right now, the press is at
tempting to reduce its potential drain on
Stanford University's resources."
Roland Greene, professor of English
and comparative literature and director of
the Division of Literatures, Cultures and
Languages, said that this decision could
do substantial damage to the press's and
the University's reputation. He, along
with several other colleagues, pointed out
that Stanford University Press is currently

seen as one of the leading figures in pub
lishing scholarly work in the humanities.
"I don't know anybody in the humani
ties who doesn't have serious concerns
about the cuts," he said. "This decision will
damage Stanford's reputation, something
that has considerable value beyond
money. Once it is damaged, it will be very
hard to repair."
He added, "The handful of first-rate
university presses is a very select club to be
long to. It seems short-sighted to get out of
that club fora quick fix |to the
press's financial woes]."
David PalumlH>-I.iu, professor
of comparative literature and di
rector of the Program in Modern
I bought and Literature and the
Program in Asian American Si tid
ies, agreed.
"Much of the worldwide repu
tation of the [press's] humanities
list rests on precisely those titles
which will be eliminated," he said.
I'he recent cuts to the 80-year
old press, which receives financial
support from the University, come
on the heels of other attempts to
increase revenue.
According to Burn, Stanford
University Press first looked into
following the lead of other univer
sity presses by supporting its
more esoteric titles with the sale of
trade books, but ultimately con
cluded that the market was too
competitive. Eventually, the press
decided to publish professional
works in the fields of business,
law, policy and economics as a
source of revenue.
" These books are not intended
to replace books in our scholarly
program but to pay for them,"
Burn said.
Haun Saussy, professor of com
parative literature and Asian lan
guages, expressed displeasure
with what he saw as a shift in the
press's focus.
"I see nothing wrong with pub
lishing in economics and business
. . . but I bate to see this happen
ing at the expense of the fields in
which Stanford has traditionally
been a leading university publish
er," he said. "It's true that Stan
ford University Press is not purely
and simply eliminating the hu
manities fields — nobody says that
they are — but the shift in person
nel and the reduction in new titles
sends a clear message about prior

ities, and the clanger is that [the
press) will lose its position as a
leading venue for original and ex
ceptional work."
Faculty members were also con
cerned that the reduction in hu
manities titles would also make it
more difficult for younger acade
mics to build a reputation and be
granted tenure.
"Having thriving university
presses is what makes it possible for
the University to have publication
requirements," Greene said, not
ing that junior faculty in the hu
manities need to have published
one book, while senior faculty
members are expected to have
published several. "If we're going

to disinvest in publication on one
hand, then we're going to need to
address the other hand."
As an example of how impor
tant the press has been, Greene de
scribed first hearing of the cuts and
describing the news to five of the
top senior English faculty at Van
derbilt University.
" Three of them said that they
would not be where they are today
without Stanford University
Press," he said. "I think that you
could repeat that scene at other
top universities."
According to an article pub
lished in the Oct. 18 issue of the
Chronicle of Higher Education,
similar cuts at university presses

around the nation are also raising
concerns about the ability ol
younger faculty to seek tenure.
The final major criticism lev
eled at the press by faculty mem
bers was the lack of information
and input that they were given
about the changes. According to
Pal umbo-Li u, who raised this issue
at the Oct. meeting of the Facul
ty Senate, most faculty were only
notified through an e-mail from
Burn sent out after the changes
were made.
"I was and continue to be disap
pointed that there was not more
consultation with humanities fac
ulty, particularly literature faculty,
whose work will be most affected
by the proposed changes," Palum
bo-Liu said.
When asked about this criti
cism, Burn claimed that the press
had met its operational and fidu
ciary obligations towards the fac
ulty, but added, "We do want to
demonstrate our commitment to
the humanities more publicly in
these difficult times. To that end,
we have begun to timetable
meetings with the [press's] Edito
rial Board and individual hu
manities faculty to identify and
respond to the most pressing
needs of humanities researchers
and students."
Speaking on broader concerns
about the changes at the press,
Burn said, "The heart of Stan
ford's program has always been
humanities publishing — and al
ways will be. Last year it accounted
for more than half of our total out
put, and this year will be the same.
"Fora press of our si/e, 35
books a year is a very healthy sign
ing rate. Added to this, we have
about 200 titles already under con
tract, which means we will have
enough material to sustain our
current output for several more
years — by which time our expec
tation is that we will have gotten
close to being financially self-sufli
cient, and will be in a position to re
view our situation."
