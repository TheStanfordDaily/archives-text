[| len ccujse down Victory to the Teacup. I can

THE DATE: WEDNESDAY. OCTOBER 17, 21:05
THE PLACE: THE TEACUP TRANCE,
3098 VICTORY BOULEVARD AT CORBIN, WEST HILLS
The one, the only, the incredible, the hull-as-all-get-out Sander Lamori,
sexiest hunk of burning man-flesh in the greater San Fernando \ alley area and
Agoura I tills combined, is live minutes late lor a very important appointment.
This makes me angry. And when Sander's mad, you better watch out, cause
some one's gonna be sad and you got no doubts.
As ill didn't have enough to deal with tonight, what with Quetzal practically
refusing to sell me my turquoise, and Lexus Boy smacking his lips all over her
neck, and rear-ending that trashy pimpmobileofhis, they're tearing up the road
- ACAIN - in the block right before Corbin. 1 mean, hell. It doesn't matter how
many times you lay down that shitty asphalt, il you don't lix the underbed where
the cracks is at, you're still screwed. So I'm stalled and I have to go around the
block to lind parking. And I'm live minutes late to meet Mandy.
I check that my hairsprav has held, zip up my black leather jacket, and
check out my stunning profile in Zeta's rear-view mirror. Too hot to handle.
Push the parking break down with a satisfying screech, keys in the ass pocket,
door's on the slam and I'm on the scram. I can already feel those pumped-up
power chords coming out of Teacup.
Teacup is the trashiest joint west of North Hollywood, and that's saying a
lot. Mandy and 1 went to great lengths to find a club that would actually let us
bring some smelly old dog in. But the owner at Teacup is some zit-faced thirty
year-old white guv who lives and dies for bad punk rock. We brought Bentham,
my diabolical I lound of the Basset villes, right up under ilic bar last concert, and
Clem didn't even bat one of his mascara-coated lashes. 1 le just went on bobbing
his head to the beat.
Teacup looks just like the kind of place you wouldn't want Sander taking
your baby girl on a date. Windows boarded up, excellent quality grallili art on
the walls, all black inside, a shitty stage and a zillion outlets. Big speakers on the
bar always look like they're about to fall off on those inoshing look in the front
row. Someone always spills beer on the floor. The bathroom's all painted black,
even thejohn and the sink, so you can't see what's going on down there. And
believe me, you don't want to.
I pause on the gum-blackened sidewalk to groove fora moment and check
out my most stylin' moves. The crappy old signboard above the door says Thus
Spake Carathrustra, Tonight at the Teacup.
