## Israeli coalition collapses 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon's broad-based coalition col
lapsed yesterday when Cabinet ministers
from the moderate Labor Party resigned in
a dispute over funding for Jewish settle
ments, threatening to push Israel into a bit
ter election.
The crisis ended an uneasy 20-month
"unity government" formed as a common
front against the Palestinian uprising, and
could sabotage U.S. efforts to win support
fora peace plan.
Sharon told parliament he would contin
ue to lead the country, suggesting he would
try to govern with a narrow coalition of far
right and religious parties rather than call
early elections.
The crisis was precipitated by Sharon's re
jection of Labor Party leader Binyamin Ben-
Eliezer's demands to cut $145 million in
funds for Jewish settlements in the $57 bil
lion 2003 state budget. Compromise pro
posals failed and Ben-Eliezer resigned from
his post as defense minister, followed by the
rest of Labor's Cabinet ministers.
Under Israeli law, the six resignations
only take effect within 48 hours, leaving

room lor last-ditch maneuvers — but politi
cians from both sides predicted Sharon's
broad-based coalition was at an end.
"We must light terror, but this is the
day when we have to present a diplomatic
horizon," Ben-Eliezer said, referring to
peace talks with the Palestinians. "The
prime minister is unable to present a
diplomatic horizon."
Critics accused Ben-Eliezer of partisan
politics, noting that in polls ahead of Labor's
Nov. 19 leadership primary he trails two
more dovish challengers, and leaving the
government over ;i settlement dispute could
boost his standing.
"It's the height of irresponsibility," said
Education Minister Limor Livnat of
Sharon's Likud Party.
Writing in today's I laaretz daily, colum
nist Yoel Marcus said the sudden end of the
uneasy partnership "was a matter of party
politics. Ego versus ego." Marcus wrote that
Sharon would pay the biggest price for the
exit of the moderate Labor Party, because
"Labor's presence in the government in
spired confidence in Sharon's promise of
being ready for painful concessions."
