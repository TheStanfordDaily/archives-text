ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Democra
tic organizers of the public memorial
for Sen. Paul Wellstone apologized
yesterday for its partisan tone, but in
sisted many of the remarks were not
scripted.
"It probably would have been best
not to get into politics and elections in
the way it was done," said Wellstone's
campaign manager, Jeff Blodgett.
But he said he"was as surprised as
anyone" when the memorial shifted
from a series of tearful eulogies into an
affair resembling a political rally.
More than 20,000 people attended
Tuesday night's 3 1/2-hour tribute to
Wellstone, his wife, daughter and live
others killed in a plane crash.
For the lirst two hours, speakers re
membered the victims with poignant
anecdotes. But when Wellstone's friend
and longtime campaign treasurer Rick
Kahn took the stage, he adopted the
late senator's fiery speaking style.
". . . [Help] us win this Senate elec
tion for Paul Wellstone," Kahn said.
