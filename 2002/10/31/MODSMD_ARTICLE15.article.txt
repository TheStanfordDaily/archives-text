## The 						Stanford Daily Vaden succeeds in providing quality health care 
### 
On Oct. 18, the Allene G. Vaden
Health Center was officially dedicat
ed after opening for services last
July. Vaden has replaced the now
demolished Cowell Student Health Center and
is located just south of the former Cowell site.
We believe Vaden represents a tangible mani
festation of laudable progress in the ways health
care services are delivered to Stanford students.
Vaden was designed to support state-of-the
art health care delivery systems, in the same
amount of space that Cowell occupied. The im
provements on Cowell's services are obvious.
For example, a patient at Vaden can make
same-day appointments, be treated by a group
of professionals rather than just one over
worked doctor and receive preventative
medicine and education with treatment. Vaden
staffhave access to an automated patient infor
mation system instead of the old paper-based

Published Since 1891

system. Many of these advances are inexpen
sive for the provider and benefit patients.
From the outset, the financing, design and
construction of Vaden was a highly collaborative
effort between diverse parties, including the
Vaden family, the Office of Development, Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Gene Awakuni,
Vaden Director Ira Friedman, Assistant Director
Jane Meier, architects, landscapers and laborers.
Vaden's first programming event, an exhibit of
healing traditions from cultures represented in
the Stanford community, reflects a commitment
to continue such a synergistic environment.
Vaden's actual function is characterized by a
similar collegiality. Members of Vaden's staff
are redesigning several core processes to pro
vide the most pleasant health care experience
at the lowest possible cost. Frequently, howev
er, these features are not easily perceptible.
Visitors may notice greater privacy and more

immediate access to services, including the
pharmacy. Yet these same visitors may not be
aware of the care taken to provide the patient
greater and more comfortable space.
Equally imperceptible are the adaptations
Vaden staff members have made in response to
an egregiously unfavorable industry environ
ment, one beleaguered by out-of-control costs
and repeated market failures. Vaden was de
signed so that examinations and procedures
can occur in the fewest possible steps. Likewise,
hindrances in communicating patient informa
tion between units have been removed. Both
these features result in uncomplicated, more
efficient processes in which health care services
are delivered. Such features also reduce ad
ministrative costs, which is a problematic area
in nearly every health care organization.
