# THE 						MINISTRY OF TRUTH
## Academics or politics? 
### 
The movement to found an Is
lamic studies program at Stan
ford has received substantial at
tention recently, generally posi
tive and uncritical in nature. However, I
feel that it is necessary to examine the mer
its of such a program.
At present, the establishment of an Is
lamic studies program does not seem to
constitute a logical response to the ideolo
gy's intrinsic importance but rather, sim
ply, to the political fallout of the terror at
tacks of Sept. 11,2001. Indeed, a Daily ed
itorial earlier this month expressing sup
port for the proposed program described
Islam as an "important and timely field."
Timely? The word alone suggests that in
terest in this discipline may be brief and
topical. Perhaps we should also pursue

new programs in "popu
lar" fields.
Formal academic pro
grams should be based
on disciplines that tran
scend our own fleeting
cultural or political mi
lieu. That the movement
to found an Islamic stud
ies program only reached

critical mass in the months after 9/11 casts
doubt upon the validity of a permanent
program.
There are, of course, very credible mo
tivations fora new program. One reason
given for the new program has been the
post-9/11 Hood of students in classes such
as Beginning Arabic and courses related to
the Muslim world.
The Stanford Bulletin lists nine courses
in the Religious Studies Department and
14 classes in the History Department that
make reference to Islam. The Language
Center offers a minor in Middle Eastern
Languages, Literature and Cultures. If
these offerings prove insufficient for stu
dents' demand, then I certainly hope the
curriculum is expanded. If the increased
enrollment in these classes holds, then by
all means, incorporate a program and a
cohesive curriculum. Il is yet to be seen,
however, whether this sudden burst of Is
lamic inquiry will be sustained.
There are also less credible arguments
for the establishment of the program. A
bizarre and troubling rationale set forth
in The Daily editorial is the volume of stu
dents enrolling in classes dealing with
"terrorism." Isn't one of the central pur
poses of an Islamic studies program to di
vorce ;in essentially peaceful religion
from what might be a distorted post-9/11,
terror-tainted conception? Certainly a
growing interest in terrorism should not
serve as justification for an Islamic studies
program.
The editorial asserts that Islam is mis
understood and that a program in its
name would preclude "acts of hate"
against its adherents. The editorial board
is not the only group to espouse a new Is
lamic "understanding," though.

For many months there has been a na
tionwide trend toward understanding
Islam, evidenced by countless books, tele
vision programs and even advertisements.
This phenomenon springs not from
widespread condemnation of the Islamic
religion, but from an effort to obviate it.
My eyes were riveted to cable news in
the months following 9/11. I read vora
ciously and listened attentively to editori
als regarding the terrorist attacks. Seldom,
if ever, did I encounter the ignorant, eth
nocentric malice that so many anticipated.
If anything, I felt inundated by a glut of
pro-Islamic commentary. I still do. Our
overly PC social climate lias made it virtu
ally impossible to say anything bad about
anybody.
Sure, Jerry Falwell may have recently
called Muhammad, Islam's last prophet, a
"terrorist," but his statement was almost
universally condemned, and his apologet
ic retraction received equal coverage. Al
though remarks like Falwell's hardly re
flect the views of many conservatives, they
constitute a symbolic straw man, a conser
vative chimera against which liberals can
righteously protest.
Does and-Islamic sentiment really exist
to the degree that many have feared?
Does Stanford really require a new pro
gram to enlighten its students? The con
ception and administration of an Islamic
studies program would likely siphon re
sources from established programs and
departments such as religious studies, his
tory and anthropology. These conces
sions could compromise the overall quali
ty and relevance of Stanford's course cat
alog. I would strongly entourage mem
bers of the Stanford community to resist
departmental and auricular changes
based on politics rather than genuine in
tellectual initiative.
Let me clarify: My concern is the rela
tionship between politics and curriculum
changes; I have no problem with the im
pulse to understand Islam. Indeed, the
surge in interest in Islam represents for
me the very best in American self-exami
nation and conscience.
When a cadre of (albeit extremist) Mus
lim men killed thousands of Americans,
did we c ategoric ally indict their faith? Did
we cease diplomatic ties with Muslim peo
ples and nations? No. Only days after the
attack, President Bush spoke publicly
about the intrinsic peacefulness of Islam.
Currently, a glance into the windows of
many bookstores reveals a host of books
on understanding Islam.
While the people of so many poor na
tions suffer from misinformation, receiv
ing news only through a perverse propa
ganda filter, our own mainstream media
regularly invites members of Arab and Is
lamic organizations to speak their minds.
I he war on potential ignorance has, it
seems, been a success. While several in

stances of hate mail and vandalism have
been reported by Muslim organizations,
violent altercations have been few and far
between. 1 believe that our national com
mitment to truth and reason has preclud
ed the senseless violence that plagues
some nations.
It would be irrational to object to the
promotion of tolerance and understand
ing of Islam perse. But it would also be ir
rational to initiate an Islamic studies pro
gram in an overreaction to phantom anti-
Islamic sentiment.

For the second week in a row, Craig Albrecht is
probably the least popular gay at Stanford.
