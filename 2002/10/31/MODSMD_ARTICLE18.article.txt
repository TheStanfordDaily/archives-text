Rape article 'openly destroys the
reputation of student 7
We would like to express our extreme
disappointment with The Daily in re
sponse to the 112 ront page article "Junior ar
rested for alleged rape," (Oct. 28). While
we do not in any way condone actions such
as those alleged to have been committed,
we feel that it is extremely irresponsible of
The Daily to print an article that in effect
socially and publicly convicts the accused
without a trial. The Daily, a student-run
news organization, should consider its
image and responsibility to the student
body before it openly destroys the reputa
tion of a student who has not yet been tried
fora terrible incident in which details are
still being investigated.

The Daily should respect privacy,
'demonstrate restraint 7
I am writing in response to the article
that appeared on the front page of Mon
day's Daily ("Junior arrested for alleged
rape"). First of all, the use of the student's
name in the article was in extremely poor
taste and was totally unnecessary. The stu
dent lias not yet been convicted and, re
gardless, deserves to have his privacy re
spected. The placement of the article, too,
was inappropriate. The Daily is not a
tabloid —at least it shouldn't be. It is a stu
dent newspaper that should positively
serve all the students with relevant news.
The issue featured is a private one, and I
would hope, in the future, The Daily would
demonstrate more restraint in such cases.

Lieutenant's comments 'trivialize
seriousness of the crime'
After reading the article about the al
leged rape last Saturday night, I was dis
gusted by the remarks made by Daniel
Karp, Peterson's lawyer, and especially by
Lieutenant Hilary Barton. Just because a
girl invites a guy to her room does not
mean that she is asking to be violated in the
most fundamental way. Shame on the po
lice department for making such a state
ment. It trivializes the seriousness of the
crime by blaming the victim. If we fall into
the oft-trodden path of telling women that
their actions warrant the violation of their
basic human rights, we ignore the man's
basic culpability for his actions. Nothing a
woman does could justify being raped, and
any insinuation that an invitation to a
woman's dorm room absolves the possibil
ity of forced sex, especially by a police offi
cer, is both ludicrous and frightening.

Daily 'insensitive' in portrayal of rape
I am writing in regards to the article ti
tled "Junior arrested for alleged rape"
(Oct. 28). I was very disappointed with the
way The Daily chose to depict this inci
dent. I understand that The Daily is just
ly compelled to present both sides of the
case, but by attempting to be objective,
The Daily appears to be insensitive to the
possibility of a rape. The defense attor
ney's comments were presented so am
biguously that it was hard to follow whose
opinion he represented. These floating

comments bring to our attention infor
mation about rape in general that can be
misconstrued as fact. For example, I am,
curious why The Daily chose to repeat the •
defense attorney's ridiculous comment
that suggests that the situation does not
resemble a rape because the student was
invited into the room. Regardless of the
circumstances of this particular case, it is
absurd for him to imply that someone
being invited into a room discounts the
possibility of rape, and it is irresponsible .
of 1 he Daily to repeat such a claim.
Even if the article was balanced in its pre
sentation of the alleged crime, the true
"news" behind this event remains unreport
ed. I agree with Barton that by publicizing
this event before we know the facts, it can be
detrimental rather than helpful. Thus until
we know the outcome of the trial, the accu
sation remains un-newsworthy.
However, what The Daily can do is to '
bring to light the more crucial issue at
stake here for all of us, which is whether |
rape is a possibility and a common occur- ;
rence on campus. Sure, Dean Wais may -
claim that this is the first reported rape in
seven years, but that doesn't mean that is !
the first one that has occurred. Most cases
go unreported because victims are often j
embarrassed or afraid that they will not be •
believed. And when an article in the paper
seems so dubious, it discourages assaulted i
students from coming forward. Of course !
Stanford should protect the innocent, and J
that may mean either the accuser or the J
accused in this case — but that protection j
could be offered by bringing to light the '
issue of rape in general rather than focus- /
ing in on a crime that has not yet been !
proven. Until we give students an envi- j
ronment in which they feel safe to come J
forward, they will remain silent and so will '
