Rape article 'openly destroys the
reputation of student 7
We would like to express our extreme
disappointment with The Daily in re
sponse to the 112 ront page article "Junior ar
rested for alleged rape," (Oct. 28). While
we do not in any way condone actions such
as those alleged to have been committed,
we feel that it is extremely irresponsible of
The Daily to print an article that in effect
socially and publicly convicts the accused
without a trial. The Daily, a student-run
news organization, should consider its
image and responsibility to the student
body before it openly destroys the reputa
tion of a student who has not yet been tried
fora terrible incident in which details are
still being investigated.

The Daily should respect privacy,
'demonstrate restraint 7
I am writing in response to the article
that appeared on the front page of Mon
day's Daily ("Junior arrested for alleged
rape"). First of all, the use of the student's
name in the article was in extremely poor
taste and was totally unnecessary. The stu
dent lias not yet been convicted and, re
gardless, deserves to have his privacy re
spected. The placement of the article, too,
was inappropriate. The Daily is not a
tabloid —at least it shouldn't be. It is a stu
dent newspaper that should positively
serve all the students with relevant news.
The issue featured is a private one, and I
would hope, in the future, The Daily would
demonstrate more restraint in such cases.

Lieutenant's comments 'trivialize
seriousness of the crime'
After reading the article about the al
leged rape last Saturday night, I was dis
gusted by the remarks made by Daniel
Karp, Peterson's lawyer, and especially by
Lieutenant Hilary Barton. Just because a
girl invites a guy to her room does not
mean that she is asking to be violated in the
most fundamental way. Shame on the po
lice department for making such a state
ment. It trivializes the seriousness of the
crime by blaming the victim. If we fall into
the oft-trodden path of telling women that
their actions warrant the violation of their
basic human rights, we ignore the man's
basic culpability for his actions. Nothing a
woman does could justify being raped, and
any insinuation that an invitation to a
woman's dorm room absolves the possibil
ity of forced sex, especially by a police offi
cer, is both ludicrous and frightening.

Daily 'insensitive' in portrayal of rape
I am writing in regards to the article ti
tled "Junior arrested for alleged rape"
(Oct. 28). I was very disappointed with the
way The Daily chose to depict this inci
dent. I understand that The Daily is just
ly compelled to present both sides of the
case, but by attempting to be objective,
The Daily appears to be insensitive to the
possibility of a rape. The defense attor
ney's comments were presented so am
biguously that it was hard to follow whose
opinion he represented. These floating

comments bring to our attention infor
mation about rape in general that can be
misconstrued as fact. For example, I am,
curious why The Daily chose to repeat the •
defense attorney's ridiculous comment
that suggests that the situation does not
resemble a rape because the student was
invited into the room. Regardless of the
circumstances of this particular case, it is
absurd for him to imply that someone
being invited into a room discounts the
possibility of rape, and it is irresponsible .
of 1 he Daily to repeat such a claim.
Even if the article was balanced in its pre
sentation of the alleged crime, the true
"news" behind this event remains unreport
ed. I agree with Barton that by publicizing
this event before we know the facts, it can be
detrimental rather than helpful. Thus until
we know the outcome of the trial, the accu
sation remains un-newsworthy.
However, what The Daily can do is to '
bring to light the more crucial issue at
stake here for all of us, which is whether |
rape is a possibility and a common occur- ;
rence on campus. Sure, Dean Wais may -
claim that this is the first reported rape in
seven years, but that doesn't mean that is !
the first one that has occurred. Most cases
go unreported because victims are often j
embarrassed or afraid that they will not be •
believed. And when an article in the paper
seems so dubious, it discourages assaulted i
students from coming forward. Of course !
Stanford should protect the innocent, and J
that may mean either the accuser or the J
accused in this case — but that protection j
could be offered by bringing to light the '
issue of rape in general rather than focus- /
ing in on a crime that has not yet been !
proven. Until we give students an envi- j
ronment in which they feel safe to come J
forward, they will remain silent and so will '
the issues at hand.

Why no follow-up on rape story?
We were astonished to see the absence of
any response in The Daily on Tuesday after
Monday's article about the alleged rape.
We were waiting to hear from someone
more informed about the facts, more expe
rienced in dealing with rape and regretted
sex and more knowledgeable about the is
sues. I n the absence of such voices, we guess
it falls to us—just some curious people
with a few questions to pose.
Why, to begin with, is this the first re
ported rape case in seven years at Stan
ford? We've been told by the staff at the
Bridge Counseling Center that it receives
at least one to two calls per quarter, even
more after Exotic Erotic. And these are
just cases reported to the Bridge. How
many rape cases go completely unreport
ed and how many more ambiguous cases
— consent with pressure, regretted sex
— happen every week and are never dis
cussed?
Stanford women are strong and self-re
liant. When we're so eager to voice our
opinions about nearly everything else,
what communal attitudes do we hold that
keep women (and in some cases, perhaps
men) in silence about this issue?
There are so many stereotypes about a
rape victim, about complicity, about de
sire, about pity, and so much pressure,
shame and second-guessing that make it
difficult for victims to speak out. And when
one finally does, do we listen to them, take
them seriously and give them the respect
they deserve?
For instance, in The Daily's article on
Monday, the alleged perpetrator's story
was explained, defended, even sympa
thized with, while the woman remained
completely voiceless. Even labeling these
women "victims" could disempower them.
If it becomes more and more rare for one
who has been violated to stand up and call
the violation wrong, we are only creating a
climate in which it becomes increasingly
OK to take advantage of each other. After
all, if no one protests, do perpetrators
think no one really minds? If no one faces
consequences, do they think they can just
get away with more?
Why do we have a system in which the
objectification of women is normal? Why

don't we affirm males who treat females
with respect; why don't we affirm females
who are attractive total people and not just
give them attention when they are dressed
up on a Friday night? This is not to say an
individual should not be held responsible
for his (or her) actions. However, if a rape
in our community occurs, it is not an iso
lated incident that has nothing to do with
those who were not directly involved. We
are all part of creating the environment in
which rape occurs, and we need to be a
part of changing it.

Student rebuffs arguments for
20-unit cap
The administration's reasons for im
posing a 20-unit cap, at least as repre
sented by yesterday's article, are without
merit ("The 20-unit limit explained,"
Oct. 30). Summarizing from the article,
the administration offers the following
justifications:
1. Grade inflation will permit students
to receive high marks even if the stu
dents' effort is spread thinly over many
classes. The problem is grade inflation,
and the solution is ending grade inflation.
The unit cap should not exist to spare the
University the embarrassment of its bogus
academic standards (hypothetically speak
ing, of course).
2. Taking too many classes interferes
with a holistic educational experience. So
does taking too few. Surely there must be
a few undergraduates among us whose
optimal educational experience consists of
extremely intensive coursework. If a high
ly burdensome courseload turns out to be
too stressful or overbalances a student's
other needs, she is always free to drop or
withdraw from classes, or to learn from the
experience and take a lighter load in the
next quarter.
3. A larger courseload implies that a
student will devote less thought and ef
fort to each course. Not necessarily. Be
yond being untrue on strictly logical
grounds, [Registar Roger] Printup fails to
take into account the unusual resourceful
ness and determination of any student who
would want to take a large number of units
in the first place.
4. "[Without a capl enterprising stu
dents might take more courses to maxi
mize the amount of instruction they re
ceive for their tuition." It takes a very
strange conception of the purpose of a

university to see this as a problem.
5. Increased class enrollment will in
crease costs. Under suspension of the unit
cap, the average class will only experience
marginal growth in its enrollment. Costs
are likely to be minor. Even if the Univer
sity decides to place a surcharge on extra
units, students would at least have the
freedom to decide if taking the extra units
makes them better off.
6. Financial aid is generous; there
fore, students have no need to rush. II
this were really true, the unit constraint
would be totally superfluous. Since that's
obviously not the case, the premise that fi
nancial aid is generous, or even adequate,
falls under doubt.
7. "We really want to help students get
what this great place has to offer, and you
cannot get it if you're taking 25 units a quar
ter." This is roughly the same as saying that
not even one student who wants to take a
large courseload really understands what's
in her best interest. This view is condescend
ing almost to the point of being offensive.
1 am sure there are powerful and legit
imate arguments in favor of a unit cap, but
I have yet to hear them.

Don't call it'PC'
Fora variety of reasons, I am not sure il
I fully agree with Bryan Choi's criticism of
The Daily for its portrayal of Full Moon on
the Quad. Nevertheless, Phil Norton's
parody of Choi's letter mischaracterized
the issue.
Choi was very cautious in his criticism of
The Daily, merely suggesting that the staff
and readers of The Daily should be aware
of the ways in which our actions and choic
es may unwittingly propagate pre-existing
stereotypes. Compare Choi's statement
that "it's irresponsible ... to play into [the
stereotype]" to Norton's phrase, "blatant
anti-lesbian propaganda," a kind of charge
Choi never came close to making.
Moreover, the absence of East Asian
males is relevant because of a pre-existing
stereotype that they lack sexuality. Norton's
attempt to name some other "PC" group to
parody Choi's criticism falls flat, since there
is no such general stereotype about les
bians. To be honest, I think that it would
have been quite appropriate to use even
one photo of a lesbian kiss, instead of none,
out of nine total photos. However, that is
another topic entirely, and I do not feel that
I should judge The Daily's editorial deci
sions with so little information at hand.
The real issue here is the perceived
need to criticize "political correctness." Far

too many times I have heard the charge of
"PC" used to silence any real debate about
current cultural norms and whether there
are still biases against points of view that
are not part of "mainstream culture." 1
would please ask everyone, before brand
ing an action or statement as "PC," to real
ly think about the possibility that some
people might be speaking out because
they find something offensive or discrimi
natory, not out of some desire for political
correctness.
Discrimination will probably never be
entirely eradicated and perhaps being of
fended is not so bad in the scheme of
things, but please consider that your view
of the world might not be the same as oth
ers' views. To you, accommodation of per
spectives outside of the "normal" ones
may seem unnecessary, but toothers, such
accommodation is simply their due.

'Free speech' is not debatable
I have been reading in The Daily the
numerous attacks and the one defense of
poet Amiri Baraka. The most recent attack
was that of Daniel Jacobs who critiqued
Adrienne Hurley's lone defense. What has
not been proven yet or made convincingly
clear is that Baraka's poem or speech con
tained anything that could be identified as
anti-Semitic. The poem does contain a
long list of perpetrators of various atroci
ties, and as Hurley points out, this list in
cludes Nazis. The poem also asks who may
have had foreknowledge of (although not
necessarily collusion in) the recent atrocity
on Sept. 11, 2001.
The parties Baraka identifies include,
among others, George Bush, the CIA
and Israel. Jacobs finds this absurd, since
"all reasonable evidence" is in. Perhaps
he can help the government investiga
tion being launched into the matter,
since it seems to still have more questions
than he does. And the fact that the FBI
and CIA knew more than the govern
ment was willing to act on is now public
knowledge. Is it so absurd that Mossad,
with far superior intelligence resources
in the Middle East than the CIA, would
know more than they?
But that then gets us to the real crux of
the issue. Regardless of the facts, it is not
socially acceptable to discuss whether Is
rael was involved. The CIA and Bush are
fine targets — no one has leapt to their de
fense. But to criticize Israel is to automati
cally be considered "anti-Semitic."
I had always thought that anti-
Semitism was the hatred or stereotyping of

Jews based on their religion or culture.
Now national policy is sacrosanct? No crit
icism of Israel is allowed if it tortures peo
ple, bombs civilians, violates the UN char
ter, or perhaps withholds intelligence? Is
all criticism of Israel worse than any act
that nation commits?
A second phase of the argument of Ja
cobs et al is that because Baraka's words are
anti-Semitic, they constitute "hate" and
therefore should be silenced. This is the
danger: that accusations of "hate" become
rationalizations for censorship.
Finally, let us compare forms of "hate"
speech. When thud Barak spoke on
campus, he bragged about personally ex
ecuting Palestinians. He made it into a
funny story. Where were the complaints
then about his hate, his bigotry and his vi
olence? There were protesters outside
who asked for equal time, but who also
made it clear that Barak had every right
to speak.
That the speech of Baraka.or Barak for
that matter, was "extremely offensive" is
debatable. That free speech, even offen
sive speech, is a right in this country, is not.
