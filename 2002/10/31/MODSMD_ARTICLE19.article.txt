### ALLISON DENCKER 
To be a Siebel Scholar is to be — in the world
of business schools at least — the best of tlie
best. Each year, the deans of America's 1 1 most
prestigious business schools choose five stu
dents from their respective universities to re
ceive this $25,000 scholarship. This year Stan
lord students Eric Bannasch, Jim Edmunds,
Jimmy Price, Sweta Sarnot and Craig Yee were

"We are proud of this year's Siebel scholars
who represent a dynamic and intellectually in
spiring group," said Graduate School of busi
ness Dean Robert L. Joss. "We appreciate
Siebel Systems' support of this program which
recognizes academic excellence and communi
ty leadership."
While Edmunds and Sarnot believe that
their recognition was based mainly on academ
ic performance, it is evident that academic ex
cellence is not all that set the scholarship rec ip

ients apart from the rest. All of the recipients

school," Edmunds explores his interest in edu
cation through the "1 Have A Dream Pro
gram." This program was established to ad
dress poor graduation rates in East Palo Alto
and has since adopted two elementary school
classes, the original class having just graduated
last year. The program is tied to the children
from elementary school through tuition assis
tance in college.
