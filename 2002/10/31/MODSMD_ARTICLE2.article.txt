Kresge Auditorium was alive last night
with candidates for the upcoming No
vember election speaking on issues rang
ing from the state budget deficit to t lie po

ASSU Chiefof Staff Hunter Margraves
opened up the evening by moderating a
debate between incumbent Democrat Joe
Simitian and challenger Republican Jim
Russell, candidates for the 21st State As
sembly seat.
The debate was followed by Republi
can Greg Conlon, candidate for the state
treasury, and Sarah Karlinsky, a propo
nent of Proposition 46, addressing the au
dience. The highlight of the evening was
the finishing talk by the Green Party gu
bernatorial candidate, Peter Miguel
Camejo.
"1 am running in this race for several
reasons ... we need people in Sacramen
to that clearly understand what is hap
pening in the educational arena," Russell
said in his opening remarks.
Simitian subsequently addressed the
crowd. Among the many topics that he
addressed was abortion.
"We need to protect a woman's right to

choose," Simitian said. "There's only one
fully pro-choice candidate in this race —
I'm that candidate."
Hargraves asked the candidates to
comment on the issue of living wage — a
popular issue on campus.
"I don't believe in the notion of a living
wage," Russell said. "Let the market do its
deed [and] wages will rise as demand rises."
Simitian offered an opposing view
point.

"Affordable housing is the only way to
make a truly modest, livable wage," said
Simitian, who voted to increase the mini
mum wage when he was mayor of Palo
Alto.
The candidates then gave their closing
statements.
"I think, lor the most part, if you work
hard you can succeed here," Simitian
