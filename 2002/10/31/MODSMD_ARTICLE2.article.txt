## 
### ALI ALEMOZAFAR STAFF WRITER 
Kresge Auditorium was alive last night
with candidates for the upcoming No
vember election speaking on issues rang
ing from the state budget deficit to t lie po
tential war in Iraq.
ASSU Chiefof Staff Hunter Margraves
opened up the evening by moderating a
debate between incumbent Democrat Joe
Simitian and challenger Republican Jim
Russell, candidates for the 21st State As
sembly seat.
The debate was followed by Republi
can Greg Conlon, candidate for the state
treasury, and Sarah Karlinsky, a propo
nent of Proposition 46, addressing the au
dience. The highlight of the evening was
the finishing talk by the Green Party gu
bernatorial candidate, Peter Miguel
Camejo.
"1 am running in this race for several
reasons ... we need people in Sacramen
to that clearly understand what is hap
pening in the educational arena," Russell
said in his opening remarks.
Simitian subsequently addressed the
crowd. Among the many topics that he
addressed was abortion.
"We need to protect a woman's right to

choose," Simitian said. "There's only one
fully pro-choice candidate in this race —
I'm that candidate."
Hargraves asked the candidates to
comment on the issue of living wage — a
popular issue on campus.
"I don't believe in the notion of a living
wage," Russell said. "Let the market do its
deed [and] wages will rise as demand rises."
Simitian offered an opposing view
point.

"Affordable housing is the only way to
make a truly modest, livable wage," said
Simitian, who voted to increase the mini
mum wage when he was mayor of Palo
Alto.
The candidates then gave their closing
statements.
"I think, lor the most part, if you work
hard you can succeed here," Simitian

said.
"Republicans believe that the
government is not the solution to
all of our problems," Russell said.
"Government has a function to
provide a safety net . . . what
makes an individual succeed is in
dividual initiative."
Conlon, who is running against
incumbent Democrat Phil An
gelides, also addressed the audi
ence.
"The state needs some fiscal re
sponsibility," Conlon said. "1 am
going to spend four years of my life
trying to fix [the budget deficit]."
Further commenting on the
$24 billion budget deficit, Conlon
added that the "Democrats don't

have the political courage to cut
expenses."
Karlinsky was introduced on
stage to give her views on Proposi
tion 46.
"One-third of all renters spend
50 percent of their income on
housing," she said. "Proposition
46 allows for affordable housing."
She offered a personal anec
dote to support her views. Karlin
sky, who was a teacher in the Balti
more, Maryland area, said, "1 was
astounded by the poverty my stu
dents faced."
The final speaker was Camejo,
who walked onto the stage to a
standing ovation.
"Where did all the money go?"
Camejo said. "We went from an $8
billion surplus to a $24 billion
deficit. . . That is hard to do."
According to Camejo, Gov.
Gray Davis lost $32 billion in six

months.
"[Davis] managed the energy
crisis improperly," Camejo added.
Camejo talked to the crowd re
garding his views on the economy.
"What is best for the economy is
for us to switch to renewable ener
gy," he said. "We should tax car
bon . . . it's better to move toward
hydrogen-based energy."
He then offered his views on the
political corruption in the U.S.
today.
"Davis has decriminalized cor
ruption," he said.
Camejo added that Davis never
denied having accepted money in
a government office, which is
against the law.
"[Davis'] slogan is four more
years . . . the Green Party's slogan
for Davis is four to 10 [years in
prison]"
Camejo suggested that people

should vote for the person as op
posed to voting to prevent another
candidate from taking office.
"If you vote for Davis to stop
Simon, you'll vote for Simon to
stop Mussolini," he said.
Camejo gave his views regard
ing same-sex marriage.
"We Greens believe [that] two
left-handed people should be al
lowed to get married," he said.
He concluded his talk by giving
his opinion on the potential war
with Iraq.
"This war is about oil ... the
U.S. wants to control the govern
ments of Iran, Iraq and
Venezuela," he said. "We Greens
think that it was wrong to support
Saddam [Hussein| by arming him
with weapons of mass destruction."
"What [President] Bush is
doing will increase terrorism," he
added.

said.
"Republicans believe that the
government is not the solution to
all of our problems," Russell said.
"Government has a function to
provide a safety net . . . what
makes an individual succeed is in
dividual initiative."
Conlon, who is running against
incumbent Democrat Phil An
gelides, also addressed the audi
ence.
"The state needs some fiscal re
sponsibility," Conlon said. "1 am
going to spend four years of my life
trying to fix [the budget deficit]."
Further commenting on the
$24 billion budget deficit, Conlon
added that the "Democrats don't

have the political courage to cut
expenses."
Karlinsky was introduced on
stage to give her views on Proposi

50 percent of their income on
housing," she said. "Proposition

sky, who was a teacher in the Balti
more, Maryland area, said, "1 was
astounded by the poverty my stu
dents faced."
The final speaker was Camejo,
who walked onto the stage to a
standing ovation.
"Where did all the money go?"
Camejo said. "We went from an $8
billion surplus to a $24 billion
deficit. . . That is hard to do."
According to Camejo, Gov.
Gray Davis lost $32 billion in six

months.
"[Davis] managed the energy
crisis improperly," Camejo added.
Camejo talked to the crowd re
garding his views on the economy.
"What is best for the economy is
for us to switch to renewable ener
gy," he said. "We should tax car
bon . . . it's better to move toward
hydrogen-based energy."
He then offered his views on the
political corruption in the U.S.
today.
"Davis has decriminalized cor
ruption," he said.
Camejo added that Davis never
denied having accepted money in
a government office, which is
against the law.
"[Davis'] slogan is four more
years . . . the Green Party's slogan
for Davis is four to 10 [years in
prison]"
Camejo suggested that people

should vote for the person as op
posed to voting to prevent another
candidate from taking office.
"If you vote for Davis to stop
Simon, you'll vote for Simon to
stop Mussolini," he said.
Camejo gave his views regard
ing same-sex marriage.
"We Greens believe [that] two
left-handed people should be al
lowed to get married," he said.
He concluded his talk by giving
his opinion on the potential war
with Iraq.
"This war is about oil ... the
U.S. wants to control the govern
ments of Iran, Iraq and
Venezuela," he said. "We Greens
think that it was wrong to support
Saddam [Hussein| by arming him
with weapons of mass destruction."
"What [President] Bush is
doing will increase terrorism," he
added.
Kresge Auditorium was alive last night
with candidates for the upcoming No
vember election speaking on issues rang
ing from the state budget deficit to t lie po
tential war in Iraq.
ASSU Chiefof Staff Hunter Margraves
opened up the evening by moderating a
debate between incumbent Democrat Joe
Simitian and challenger Republican Jim
Russell, candidates for the 21st State As
sembly seat.
The debate was followed by Republi
can Greg Conlon, candidate for the state
treasury, and Sarah Karlinsky, a propo
nent of Proposition 46, addressing the au
dience. The highlight of the evening was
the finishing talk by the Green Party gu
bernatorial candidate, Peter Miguel
Camejo.
"1 am running in this race for several
reasons ... we need people in Sacramen
to that clearly understand what is hap
pening in the educational arena," Russell
said in his opening remarks.
Simitian subsequently addressed the
crowd. Among the many topics that he
addressed was abortion.
"We need to protect a woman's right to

choose," Simitian said. "There's only one
fully pro-choice candidate in this race —
I'm that candidate."
Hargraves asked the candidates to
comment on the issue of living wage — a
popular issue on campus.
"I don't believe in the notion of a living
wage," Russell said. "Let the market do its
deed [and] wages will rise as demand rises."
Simitian offered an opposing view
point.

"Affordable housing is the only way to
make a truly modest, livable wage," said
Simitian, who voted to increase the mini
mum wage when he was mayor of Palo
Alto.
The candidates then gave their closing
statements.
