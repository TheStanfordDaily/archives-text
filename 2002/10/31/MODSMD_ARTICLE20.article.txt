# Daily Cal editors and writers protest employment policies
## 
### PATRICK W. HIGGINS U-WIRE (DC BUREAU 
(U-WIRE) WASHINGTON —Four news edi
tors and an undetermined number of writers from
the stalf of The Daily Californian student newspa
per at UC-Berkeley staged a walk-out this week to
protest what they claim are unfair employment
policies that have led to the firing of two editors and
the resignation of five others.
The staff is accusing Editor-in-Chief Rong-Gong
Lin, 11 and Managing Editor Virginia Griffey of im
plementing new and unauthorized changes within
the newsroom that punish editors for late story sub
missions.
Former Assistant Editor Ben Barron, who
walked out on the newspaper on Tuesday, accused
Lin and Griffey of firing editors without consulting
the Senior Editorial Board as per protocol. Barron
also claimed that Lin and Griffey hired their friends
to fill the positions and, in some cases, the replace
ments had no prior newspaper experience.
Lin strongly denied the charges, claiming that
the new policy met with "no objections" from the
staff when it was introduced last Thursday.
In a letter to the reporters of the Daily Cal this
week, four former editors, three who resigned and
one who was allegedly fired, urged public attention
to what they call an "extremely alarming" situation.
"This firing sets a dangerous precedent and
should not be tolerated. Ron and Virginia have
overextended their powers and have shown no re
spect or fairness toward the editors who have dedi
cated much of their time to the Daily Cal," the for
mer editors wrote.
According to Barron, Lin implemented a new
policy last week that required City Editor Leta Shy
and University Editor Millie Lapidario to stay in the
office until the paper went to the press, which could
be 3 a.m. in some cases, whenever an article was
submitted after 9 p.m. on production night.
"Although as an assistant news editor I had nu
merous times turned in to the night desk a brief I
had written and edited myself without the news ed
itor's own editing, Virginia told me after the 9 p.m.
deadline — after an assistant turned a brief into the
night desk before 9 p.m. — that I had to edit it. I
turned in the brief at about 9:03 p.m., but was still
made to stay until 12:30 a.m. as punishment," Shy
wrote in a letter to the Senior Editorial Board, out

lining the situation on Sunday night.
The new policy forced Shy and Lapidario to
spend close to 14 hours a day in the office this week
end — despite their status as full-time students.
"We're students, we have social lives we want to
get out too," Barron said.
Shy and Lapidario challenged the policy, calling
it "counterproductive."
"[The policy] assumes that they are not already
doing all they can to make deadline," the former
editors wrote.
Lin disagrees, saying, "The point of this policy is
t hat when and if a section doesn't make their dead
line, staying here allows them to see what happens
when they are late."
He also pointed out that at any major metropol
itan newspaper, if a reporter misses a deadline, they
are usually fired. Lin said that he understands that
the Daily Cal is a learning paper, so he's tries to be
(lexible, but he stressed the importance of a real
world atmosphere.
Lin asked Shy for her resignation Sunday
night, citing a poor attitude towards Griffey while
forced to stay in the office on Sunday night and
anonymous complaints about her performance.
Lin replaced Shy with Mike Meyers — a friend
that Barron claims has no experience in news re
porting — as City Editor within 24 hours of asking
her to resign.
According to Barron and the other editors, "The
single news editor who has replaced both the Uni
versity and City Editors has only been writing news
stories since January of this year, and has had no
news editing experience."
Lin, calling Barron's allegation "completely un
true" cited Meyer's 10 months of experience as a
City Council beat reporter and his extensive work
in sports reporting.
When Shy refused to resign without a formal
hearing before the Senior Editorial Board, Lin
lired her without consulting any of the writers or
editors she claims, a charge which Lin denies.
"Ron has asked for my letter of resignation. 1 de
cline to submit one. Regardless of Ron's reasons,
which 1 feel are not substantial enough to warrant
my resignation, the structure of The Daily Cali
fornian depends on the right of the Senior Editori
al Board as a whole to make certain decisions," Shy
wrote.
"I never fired her [Shy], she resigned," Lin said.
