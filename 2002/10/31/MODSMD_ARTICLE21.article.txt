## Pac-10 dominance a tradition for Card 
### ERIK SPERLING STAFF WRITER 
The seniors on rival Pacific-10
Conference teams lining up across
from No. 2 Stanford at this Satur
day's Pac-10 Championships have
never known anything but Cardi
nal domination in conference
competition. And when these cur
rent seniors were freshmen, their
senior mentors were probably en
tertaining them with stories of
Stanford victories.
The Cardinal has won the Pac
l()s for the last six years and eight
years out of the last nine. To most
in the cross country world, i(
seems almost a foregone conclu
sion that history will repeat itself
this weekend.
On the sunny and lush grass of
the Brookside Golf Course in
Pasadena, the Cardinal will look
to steamroll the rest of its division.
In 2001, Stanford scored 27
points to easily outpace Arizona
(64) and Arizona State (79). This
year, the only nationally-ranked
Pac-10 teams are No. 17 Arizona
State and No. 19 UCLA.
Moreover, the Cardinal has
performed extremely well in
each of its races this season, con
sistently placing runners on the
top of the podium. At (he Pre-
NCAA Meet in Terre Haute,

Ind., two weekends ago, Stanford
demonstrated (he veracity of its
No. 2 ranking. The team won the
white race by a significant mar
gin, with sophomores Alicia
Craig and Sara Bei and senior
Lauren Fleshman placing 2nd,
3rd and 4th, respectively.
Director of track and field and
cross country Vin Lananna was
guardedly optimistic on the re
sults of the race.
"All of our athletes did a great
job," he said. "Our major objective
was to race on this course in
preparation for the NCAA Cham
pionships here in November, but
it was nice to get the team victory
also. We ran aggressively and
competitively and accomplished
our mission."
The rest of the Pac-10 teams
ran decent but not stellar races at
(he Pre-NCAAs. Arizona and
UCLA placed eighth and ninth,
respectively, in the white race,
while Washington recorded an
1 1 th place finish in the blue race.
In light of this, the Cardinal
looks destined to continue its
Pac-10 reign.
However, the lack of competi
tion does not mean the Stanford
team can afford to rest on its
haunches; this meet represents

the beginning of the champi
onship season, with the NCAA
Championships now less than a
month away.
The Pac-lOs and upcoming
NCAA Western Regionals also
offer runners the last chance to
convince the coaching staff that
they deserve a spot on the nation
als squad. While the top part of
the Cardinal lineup has re
mained relatively steady
throughout the season, Lananna
and women's assistant coach
Delia Evans have played with var
ious combinations of runners for
the final few positions.
In crosscountry, the plat ings of
the top five runners are tallied,
and the team with the lowest score
wins. The sixth and seventh run
ners do not count in the official
team scoring, but are important
nonetheless. Unlike track, where
runners compete on a smooth,
even surface against a handful of
competitors, cross country meets

are characteristically unpre
dictable.
Over 200 runners can toe the
line at a big race like nationals,
and it is easy for runners to trip in
the whirling melee at the start. II
a runner trips, she will find her
self at the very tail of the field, and
will have difficulty passing the sea
of runners separating her from
the front.
A number of other possible
catastrophes can befall an indi
vidual runner, from sustaining
an injury while running over un
even ground, to going out too
hard and collapsing before the
finish line. Consequently, the
sixth and seventh runners serve
as backups should one of the top
five runners falter and decide ties
between two teams.
The last two runners also serve
a more practical role by placing
ahead of other team's scoring run
ners, which increases competitors'
scores. Even small point differ
ences caii be very important, as ev
idenced by Stanford's two-point
victory at last year's Pre-NCAAs.
However, more important
than determining the exact roster

for the nationals squad, the Pac
l()s serve as one last opportunity
to work out team racing tactics be
fore the Western Regionals
(where the team must qualify for
nationals) and NCAAs.
"1 am really enjoying the strate
gy involved in crosscountry," said
senior Malindi Elmore. "For me, it
is really about focusing on what I
can contribute to the team effort,
and I get really excited about the
momentum we have for the cham
pionship portion of the season."

"All of our athletes did a great

was to race on this course in
preparation for the NCAA Cham
pionships here in November, but
it was nice to get the team victory
also. We ran aggressively and
competitively and accomplished
our mission."

Championships now less than a
month away.
The Pac-lOs and upcoming
NCAA Western Regionals also
offer runners the last chance to
convince the coaching staff that
they deserve a spot on the nation
als squad. While the top part of
the Cardinal lineup has re
mained relatively steady
throughout the season, Lananna
and women's assistant coach
Delia Evans have played with var
ious combinations of runners for
the final few positions.
In crosscountry, the plat ings of
the top five runners are tallied,
and the team with the lowest score
wins. The sixth and seventh run
ners do not count in the official
team scoring, but are important
nonetheless. Unlike track, where
runners compete on a smooth,
even surface against a handful of
competitors, cross country meets

are characteristically unpre
dictable.
Over 200 runners can toe the
line at a big race like nationals,
and it is easy for runners to trip in
the whirling melee at the start. II
a runner trips, she will find her
self at the very tail of the field, and
will have difficulty passing the sea
of runners separating her from
the front.
A number of other possible
catastrophes can befall an indi
vidual runner, from sustaining
an injury while running over un
even ground, to going out too
hard and collapsing before the
finish line. Consequently, the
sixth and seventh runners serve
as backups should one of the top
five runners falter and decide ties
between two teams.
The last two runners also serve
a more practical role by placing
ahead of other team's scoring run
ners, which increases competitors'
scores. Even small point differ
ences caii be very important, as ev
idenced by Stanford's two-point
victory at last year's Pre-NCAAs.
However, more important
than determining the exact roster

for the nationals squad, the Pac
l()s serve as one last opportunity
to work out team racing tactics be
fore the Western Regionals
(where the team must qualify for
nationals) and NCAAs.
"1 am really enjoying the strate
gy involved in crosscountry," said
senior Malindi Elmore. "For me, it
is really about focusing on what I
can contribute to the team effort,
and I get really excited about the
momentum we have for the cham
pionship portion of the season."
The seniors on rival Pacific-10
Conference teams lining up across
from No. 2 Stanford at this Satur
day's Pac-10 Championships have
never known anything but Cardi
nal domination in conference
competition. And when these cur
rent seniors were freshmen, their
senior mentors were probably en
tertaining them with stories of
Stanford victories.
The Cardinal has won the Pac
l()s for the last six years and eight
years out of the last nine. To most
in the cross country world, i(
seems almost a foregone conclu
sion that history will repeat itself
this weekend.
On the sunny and lush grass of
the Brookside Golf Course in
Pasadena, the Cardinal will look
to steamroll the rest of its division.
In 2001, Stanford scored 27
points to easily outpace Arizona
(64) and Arizona State (79). This
year, the only nationally-ranked
Pac-10 teams are No. 17 Arizona
State and No. 19 UCLA.
Moreover, the Cardinal has
performed extremely well in
each of its races this season, con
sistently placing runners on the
top of the podium. At (he Pre-
NCAA Meet in Terre Haute,

Ind., two weekends ago, Stanford
demonstrated (he veracity of its
No. 2 ranking. The team won the
white race by a significant mar
gin, with sophomores Alicia
Craig and Sara Bei and senior
Lauren Fleshman placing 2nd,
3rd and 4th, respectively.
