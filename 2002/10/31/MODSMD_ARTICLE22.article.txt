# No. 1 men take aim at conference title
## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's cross coun
try squad begins its championship
competition on Saturday as it seeks
to defend its Pacific-10 Conference
title in Pasadena.
Despite being the top-ranked
team in the nation, the Cardinal
will not have an easy race to claim
its sixth Pac-10 title in seven years.
No. 5 Oregon, No. 25 Arizona State
and Washington are all looking for
an upset this weekend. They know
that at the conference champi
onship, rankings mean nothing.
Stanford's one conference loss
in the last six years came in 1999,
when the then-No. 6 Arizona State
squad beat the No. 2 Cardinal 32-
63. The Cardinal defeated the Sun
Devils at regionals and nationals,
but the conference title had already
been lost.
"We have to go out and control
the race," said Vin Lananna, direc
tor of cross country and track and
field at Stanford. "[ln 1999,] we let
someone else run the race, and we
got beat."
With no fewer than live runners
on the squad considered con
tenders for this year's Pac-10 indi
vidual title, it appears that the Car
dinal will have no problem control
ling the race.
Sophomore Ryan Hall has led
the Cardinal twice this year with
victories at the Stanford Invitation
al on Sept. 28 on the short course
and at the Notre Dame Invitation
al on Oct. 4.
Junior Grant Robison opened
his season with a runner-up finish
at the Pre-NCAA Championships
two weeks ago and returns as the
defending Pac-10 champion.
Juniors Don Sage and Louis Lu
chini return as the Cardinal's top
two finishers from last year's NCAA
Championships and have run well
early this season. Sage and Luchini
placed second and fifth, respective
ly, at Notre Dame and sixth and
seventh, respectively, at the Pre-
NCAAs.
Junior lan Dobson won the long
race this year at the Stanford Invi
tational while running unattached
and placed third at the Pre-NCAAs.
Also adding individual victories
for the Cardinal this season, junior
Adam Tenforde took first at the
season-opening Cal State-Fuller
ton Invitational on Aug. 31, and ju

nior Andrew Hill won the Arizona
State Invitational on Oct. 11.
"Ifoneofour guys wins, I don't
think it will necessarily mean he is
our top runner," Dobson said. "I
don't think this will be an all-out
race from the start. We will proba
bly try to keep the pack together for
a couple miles."
Challenges to the Stanford run
ners for the individual title this
weekend could come from Oregon
senior Jason Hartmann, Arizona
State senior Fasil Bizuneh and
Washington junior Eric Garner.
Hartmann is a two-time Ail-
American in cross country and
claimed fourth in last year's
NCAA 10,000-meter outdoor
track championships. He leads an
Oregon squad considered the
strongest challenger to the Cardi
nal for top team honors at the
conference race.

"The Oregon coach likes to
keep his team quiet," Lananna
said. "We don't really know what
they are going to bring or what
their goals are."
Dobson added, " I think Oregon
is a much better team than people
expected. They have a couple good
guys who could break into our
pack, like Hartmann and [Eric]
Logsdon."
Bizuneh, a returning cross
country All-American, was second
last year at the Pac-10 Champi
onships. He and his teammates are
looking to improve on last year's
runner-up finish.
The dark horse in this year's
conference race is Washington,
which boasts a talented roster seek
ing to earn a bid to the NCAA
Championships at Indiana State in
November.
After displaying his strength

on the track by posting a sub
four-minute mile, Garner is lead
ing a young team of runners who
are looking to challenge for the
team title on Saturday. While
iliey may not be able to unseat the
Cardinal, the Huskies could pos
sibly surprise the competition
with a runner-up finish.
But there is a reason Stanford is
No. 1: The depth and talent on the
squad this year is probably the best
it has ever been. And after de
stroying some of the top teams in
the nation at the Pre-NCAA
Championships, the Cardinal
looks unstoppable.
"I don't worry about the other
teams," Dobson said. "But 1
wouldn't put it past one of them to
have a great day and really chal
lenge ns. I can't see them dictating

the race like we can, though."
"Pac-10 Championships is a
small race, so it's hard to really use
it to prepare for something like the
national championships, which
has 250 or so runners," Lananna
said. "But it's still an important
race, and the goal is always to win
it. We can practice our strategy
and still be focused on winning."

the race like we can, though."
"Pac-10 Championships is a
small race, so it's hard to really use
it to prepare for something like the
national championships, which
has 250 or so runners," Lananna
said. "But it's still an important
race, and the goal is always to win
it. We can practice our strategy
and still be focused on winning."
The Stanford men's cross coun
try squad begins its championship
competition on Saturday as it seeks
to defend its Pacific-10 Conference
title in Pasadena.
Despite being the top-ranked
team in the nation, the Cardinal
will not have an easy race to claim
its sixth Pac-10 title in seven years.
No. 5 Oregon, No. 25 Arizona State
and Washington are all looking for
an upset this weekend. They know
that at the conference champi
onship, rankings mean nothing.
Stanford's one conference loss
in the last six years came in 1999,
when the then-No. 6 Arizona State
squad beat the No. 2 Cardinal 32-
63. The Cardinal defeated the Sun
Devils at regionals and nationals,
but the conference title had already
been lost.
"We have to go out and control
the race," said Vin Lananna, direc
tor of cross country and track and
field at Stanford. "[ln 1999,] we let
someone else run the race, and we
got beat."
With no fewer than live runners
on the squad considered con
tenders for this year's Pac-10 indi
vidual title, it appears that the Car
dinal will have no problem control
ling the race.
Sophomore Ryan Hall has led
the Cardinal twice this year with
victories at the Stanford Invitation
al on Sept. 28 on the short course
and at the Notre Dame Invitation
al on Oct. 4.
Junior Grant Robison opened
his season with a runner-up finish
at the Pre-NCAA Championships
two weeks ago and returns as the
defending Pac-10 champion.
Juniors Don Sage and Louis Lu
chini return as the Cardinal's top
two finishers from last year's NCAA
Championships and have run well
early this season. Sage and Luchini
placed second and fifth, respective
ly, at Notre Dame and sixth and
seventh, respectively, at the Pre-
NCAAs.
Junior lan Dobson won the long
race this year at the Stanford Invi
tational while running unattached
and placed third at the Pre-NCAAs.
Also adding individual victories
for the Cardinal this season, junior
Adam Tenforde took first at the
season-opening Cal State-Fuller
ton Invitational on Aug. 31, and ju

nior Andrew Hill won the Arizona
State Invitational on Oct. 11.
"Ifoneofour guys wins, I don't
think it will necessarily mean he is
our top runner," Dobson said. "I
don't think this will be an all-out
race from the start. We will proba
bly try to keep the pack together for
a couple miles."
Challenges to the Stanford run
ners for the individual title this
weekend could come from Oregon
senior Jason Hartmann, Arizona
State senior Fasil Bizuneh and
Washington junior Eric Garner.
Hartmann is a two-time Ail-
American in cross country and
claimed fourth in last year's
NCAA 10,000-meter outdoor
track championships. He leads an
Oregon squad considered the
strongest challenger to the Cardi
nal for top team honors at the
conference race.

"The Oregon coach likes to
keep his team quiet," Lananna
said. "We don't really know what
they are going to bring or what
their goals are."
Dobson added, " I think Oregon
is a much better team than people
expected. They have a couple good
guys who could break into our
pack, like Hartmann and [Eric]
Logsdon."
Bizuneh, a returning cross
country All-American, was second
last year at the Pac-10 Champi
onships. He and his teammates are
looking to improve on last year's
runner-up finish.
The dark horse in this year's
conference race is Washington,
which boasts a talented roster seek
ing to earn a bid to the NCAA
Championships at Indiana State in
November.
After displaying his strength

on the track by posting a sub
four-minute mile, Garner is lead
ing a young team of runners who
are looking to challenge for the
team title on Saturday. While
iliey may not be able to unseat the
Cardinal, the Huskies could pos
sibly surprise the competition
with a runner-up finish.
But there is a reason Stanford is
No. 1: The depth and talent on the
squad this year is probably the best
it has ever been. And after de
stroying some of the top teams in
the nation at the Pre-NCAA
Championships, the Cardinal
looks unstoppable.
"I don't worry about the other
teams," Dobson said. "But 1
wouldn't put it past one of them to
have a great day and really chal
lenge ns. I can't see them dictating
