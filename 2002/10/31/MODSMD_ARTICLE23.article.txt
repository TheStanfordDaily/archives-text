# Giants' loss leaves a void only food can fill
## 
### 
A terrific World Series just ended. Yeah,
the Giants went down to the swarming
masses of monkeys and ThunderStix,
but they still gave us seven decent
games, five of which were spectacular.
A series like this gets a lot of people excited
about sports again — watching the games on
television, keeping an eye on the paper to check
the morning scores, and talking about the
games at work. So now that baseball has gone
away for the winter, what do we have to watch?
Not much.
Early season basketball? The Nuggets si ill
suck.
Early season hockey? You know it's early
season because the Minnesota Wild are leading

the Northwest division, the
home of my beloved
Avalanche. The Minnesota
Wild!
Here's a real opportunity
for ABC to make a ratings
killing, though. If they com
bine "Girls Gone Wild" with a
hockey game in the fro/en
Midwest tundra, add a few

"Jackass" stunts with the Zamboni machine and
scantily clad coeds and, well, you can just imag
ine the rest.
What else? Midseason football in the parity
tilled NFL? Some good teams and some good
games, but nothing to really write home — or

write in The Daily — about yet.
As you can see, this leaves us without much
to go on. We're in a sports Sahara until the
college football bowl season rolls into town in
December.
And the way things are going for Operation
Cardinal right now, the bowl season isn't going
to offer us much entertainment, either.
Which leaves us with the only real sport cur
rently worth watching — competitive eating.
I'm dead serious. Everybody knows about
the "Six Saltines in 60 Seconds". Two room
mates in my freshman dorm raced each other
one night — one of them tried to drink a gallon
