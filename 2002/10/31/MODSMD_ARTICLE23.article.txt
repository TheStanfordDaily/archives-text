# Giants' loss leaves a void only food can fill
## 
### 
A terrific World Series just ended. Yeah,
the Giants went down to the swarming
masses of monkeys and ThunderStix,
but they still gave us seven decent
games, five of which were spectacular.
A series like this gets a lot of people excited
about sports again — watching the games on
television, keeping an eye on the paper to check
the morning scores, and talking about the
games at work. So now that baseball has gone
away for the winter, what do we have to watch?
Not much.
Early season basketball? The Nuggets si ill
suck.
Early season hockey? You know it's early
season because the Minnesota Wild are leading

the Northwest division, the
home of my beloved
Avalanche. The Minnesota
Wild!
Here's a real opportunity
for ABC to make a ratings
killing, though. If they com
bine "Girls Gone Wild" with a
hockey game in the fro/en
Midwest tundra, add a few

"Jackass" stunts with the Zamboni machine and
scantily clad coeds and, well, you can just imag
ine the rest.
What else? Midseason football in the parity
tilled NFL? Some good teams and some good
games, but nothing to really write home — or

write in The Daily — about yet.
As you can see, this leaves us without much
to go on. We're in a sports Sahara until the
college football bowl season rolls into town in
December.
And the way things are going for Operation
Cardinal right now, the bowl season isn't going
to offer us much entertainment, either.
Which leaves us with the only real sport cur
rently worth watching — competitive eating.
I'm dead serious. Everybody knows about
the "Six Saltines in 60 Seconds". Two room
mates in my freshman dorm raced each other
one night — one of them tried to drink a gallon

of milk before the other could eat
two pounds of baked beans. They
ended up both getting sick in their
room. Classic.
A member of my old draw
group, who will go unnamed for his
own good, once confessed to the
rest of us that he used to eat sticks of
butter like Popsicles when he was a
little kid. After we had the good for
tune to draw into a Row house, we
used to try every week to get him to
eat our CostCo-sized slabs of butter,
but he never fell for it.
But all these amateurs pale in
comparison to the professionals.
They're even getting serious
media coverage — the Food Net
work televises some of t heir match
es, and The New York Times ( The
New York TIMES!!) had an article
about them just yesterday.
It appears that the latest craze
picked up speed this summer at
the Coney Island Fourth of July
hot dog contest when little Takeru
Kobayashi threw down 50 wieners

to win the title for the second
straight year. Now there's a way to
start a conversation: "Did you
know I can eat over 50 wieners in
just under 12 minutes? Care to
dance?"
They actually had to go to the
video replay to see if Mr. Kobayashi
(isn't that a guy's name in " The
Usual Suspects," too? Coincidence?
I think not!) could be credited with
his last half of a hot dog.
Gersh Kuntzman, a New York
Post reporter and so-called "ex
pert" on competitive eating set
tled most of the discussion when
he announced, "I've gone back to
the videotape, and while he did
exhale the last half, he then re-in
haled it through his nostrils. That,
as I said before, is the true mark of
a champion."
Some champion. But lie still has
a ways to go before he's counted
among the ranks of Dale "The
Mouth from the South" Boone,
Ray "The Bison" Medusa and Ed
"Cookie" Jarvis. These guys are
the All Stars, the ones who inspire
fear in the hearts of their competi
tors — and buffet owners —
everywhere.

"The Mouth from the South"
once put down eight pounds of
mayonnaise in eight minutes.
"Cookie" himself owns two world
records, for ice cream and cannoli.
He downed ounces of ice cream
in 12 minutes. Makes that pint of
Ben and Jerry's look pretty small,
doesn't it?
Baseball has left us alone to face
the fall. Football only comes once a
week.
So, to television programmers
everywhere .. . Please! Put more
hockey games on ESPN2. Televise
more championship darts, live
from English pubs. Show us re
runs of the Great Outdoor Games
and the World's Strongest Man
competition. But please, for the
safety of our children and our
kite liens, keep Cookie, The Bison
and The Mouth from the South off
the air.

Matt Babin is a senior majoring in eco
nomics who is convinced he saw The
Mouth from the South stealing tubs of
ice cream out of Flo Mo the other day.
If you have any evidence about this
theft, call campus security or send him
an e-mail at babin@stanford.edu.
