# Women's swim team enters season with strong freshman class
## 
### JESSICA PETERS 
It would hardly be considered the
dream of every coach to go into a season
with a young team. Yet three-fourths of
coach Richard Quick's women swimmers
are 112 reshmen or sophomores, and (he up
coming season just might be a dream
come true.
This year's team returns 11 sopho
mores. Eight athletes belong to the in
coming freshman c lass, which will be cru
cial to the team's success this year.
"The freshman class must come
through for us to be a successful team,
and their history indicates that its
will," says Quick, who this season be
gins his 15th year as head coach of the
women's swimming program. "We're
very excited."
Led by freshmen Kristin Caverly,
Laura Davis and Dana Kirk (whose sister
Tara is a junior on the team), the fresh
man c lass is indeed an impressive group.
Caverly, Davis and Kirk were finalists at

the Senior Nationals, as were fellow 112 resh
men Carly Cieehr and Ashley Daly. Jackie
Goldman and Anna Strohl round out the
incoming recruits.
Comradery among the young swim
mers is helping them adjust to the colle
giate level and rise to the challenge of
competing fora team that Quick said is
"recreating" itself.
"I feel such a bond with my team
mates," Daly said. "I'm going to be think
ing about winning for the team, and I
think that's going to really empower me.
I'm going to do a lot better because our
team is so unified."
The freshman class has high expecta
tions for itself and exhibits a hard work
ethic to be the dominant women's swim
ming program in the country.
"Everyday I get to practice, that's what
I think about: four years' worth of being
the best," Kirk said.
No doubt the upperclassmen are
pleased with the determination shown by
their younger teammates, as they hope to

continue their past successes.
The Cardinal's top returning athlete
is junior Tara Kirk, an NCAA Champion
in the 100- and 200-yard breaststroke
and an American record-holder in the
same events.
Quick expects a big year from sopho
mores l ami Ransom and Amy Wagner,
as well as key contributions from sopho
more Kirsten Gilbert. Sophomore Lacey
Bout well, whom Quick places in a c atego
ry with the elder Kirk, is crucial to Stan
lord's success in the freestyle events â€”
critical events in which the the Cardinal
was weakened by the loss of Jessica Foschi
to graduation last year.
The first meet of the season is this
weekend at Texas, where Stanford will
lace the Longhorns and Southern Cali
fornia, two teams that are perenially
among the top in the nation.
"We haven't raced at all this year, so it's
definitely time to see what we can do,"
