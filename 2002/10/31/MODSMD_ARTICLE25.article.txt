### RACHAEL HANLEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's crew team has a
huge task this weekend as it tries to finish
one and two in the Newport Fall Regatta.
The men are hoping fora strong victory
this week when the Cardinal returns to
head coach Craig Amerkhanian's home
course along Newport Beach, Calif.
The other teams in the field sched
uled to appear at Newport include
Southern California, UCLA and UC-
Davis. California, the defending men's
eight champion and Stanford's primary
opposition, could be a no-show this
weekend due to budgetary restraints,
Amerkhanian said. Cal could not be
reached to confirm its attendance.
"I want to ser if the [Stanford] B boat

can go after the UC-Davis A boat,"
Amerkhanian said. "I want to see Stan
ford as one and two. That's never been
done at Newport before."
Amerkhanian's goal may be a large
undertaking, but one within reach for
the Stanford team, which is coming off a
win in the Head of the American last
weekend.
"I'm going to give the B boat the best
boat we've got and hope that gives them
nine seconds," Amerkhanian said, refer
ring to last weekend's margin between
the Stanford B team and Davis.
One of the greatest challenges for the
Cardinal may be the course itself. The
Newport route winds among moored
boats, buoys and marsh inlets. From start
to finish, the racecourse has one mild
turn and three sharp turns. During the

races, the coxswain will have to steer
around an island and under two bridges.
Even the coxswain map highlights the
complexities of the course, warning,
" Turn 2 is an abrupt turn to port. Many
crews have missed this turn in the past!"
Stanford men's A boat will start first ill
the race. The B boat is likely to be posi
tioned in the middle of the pack, behind A
boats from the other teams. Amerkhan
ian said he is concerned that other boats
will slow the Stanford B boat as it tries to
move up to the Stanford A boat.
"I'm worrying about them being in
traffic," Amerkhanian said. "1 o pass five
boats, that's 10 seconds because it takes
two seconds every time."
The Stanford B team's strategy is to lag-
