# Voters faced with schools-chief choice
## 
### WINSTON LIN 
On Nov. 5, voters will be presented
with a choice between State Senator Jack
O'Conncll and Anaheim School Board
President Kathy Smith for the position of
superintendent of public instruction. The
outcome of the race carries implications
for the entire California education com
munity, including Stanford.
As state schools chief, the superinten
dent is the chief spokesperson for the
needs of public education, runs the state
Department of Education and works with
the educators to improve student acade
mic performance.
"The superintendent is the chief ad
ministrator fora k-12 school budget of 40

billion," said Mike Kirst, Stanford educa
tion professor and former president of
the state Board of Education. "He/she
makes crucial decisions [for] statewide
tests; allocation of grants for reading im
provement; and allocation of grants for
handicapped, gifted, limited-English and
other special-needs children."
Republican candidate O'Conncll is no

stranger to educational policy. He served
almost two decades in the California State
Legislature, worked as chairman of the
Senate Budget Committee's Subcommit
tee on Education, and wrote numerous
education bills iu both the State Assembly
and the Slate Senate.
The lead author of California's class
size-reduction program, O'Connell also
worked to increase teacher salaries and
implemented an incentive program to re
cruit new teachers by providing grants for
college tuition.
His credentials exhibit a working
knowledge of public education. Accord
ing to his Web site, O'Connell received his

bachelor's degree from CSU-
Fullerton and earned his Sec
ondary Teaching Credential from
CSU-Long Beach. I le then taught
high school for several years in San
Luis Obispo, where he grew up.
If elected, O'Connell said his
priorities would be lowering class
size in upper grades, raising
salaries and fixing debilitated
schools.
His Democratic opponent,
Smith, is the co-founder of Group
Resolving Anti-Social Problems, a
not-for-profit corporation dedicat
ed to finding and implementing
solutions to gang-related prob
lems. She is also the co-founder of
the National Coalition for Drug
Policy Change, founded in Febru
ary 1993 at the Hoover Institution
at Stanford.
Although Smith does not have
an official degree from a universi
ty, her educational career includes
being an elementary school

teacher at Sherwood Academy, a
substitute teacher for the Magnolia
School District and a member of
the parent's board at Servite 1 ligh
School.
Smith's online mission state
ment, entitled "Restoring Basics to
California Schools," states that she
plans to "teach the basics to our
children; teach our future teachers
to teach the basics; and return
trade and technology classes to our
schools."
Specifically, she wants to estab
lish retention programs for chil
dren who are not achieving at their
grade levels, provide incentives to
retain good teachers in under
served districts and improve chil
dren's living environment by
working with city governments,
according to her official Web site.
While it may seem that Stanford
students have no direct connection
to this election, the actions of the
superintendent are indeed far
reaching.
1 lunter I largraves, chief of staff
for the ASSU, said, "Because the
[superintendent | office is nonparti
san, Stanford students must take

extra care to ensure that they know
where both Mr. O'Connell and Ms.
Smith stand on funding financial
aid at the statewide level â€” they
can't just look at the party label.
"Furthermore, with California
entering a time of budget woes,
preserving higher education fund
ing and student financial aid pro
grams is perhaps even more im
portant than before."
Anthony Antonio, a professor of
education specializing in higher
education, said, "The opportunity
to attend an institution of higher
learning is a crucial issue. Right
now, many students are unable to
further their learning because the
knowledge of and ability to have
higher education are inadequate.
The superintendent has an impor
tant role in the process of prepar
ing students for their futures."
In his advice to Stanford stu
dent voters, kirst said, "Since the
superintendent job is primarily
implementation, we want some
one who knows about state gov
ernment and how to use money
well at the school and classroom
levels."
