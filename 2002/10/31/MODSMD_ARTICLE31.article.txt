# Tennis freshmen shine at ITA Regionals
## K.C. Corkery and James Pade won the doubles competition and qualified for nationals 
### JAY DAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Three Stanford doubles teams and nine sin
gles entered the Omni Hotels Regional Cham
pionship with the aim of gaining berths to the
Intercollegiate Tennis Association's National
Championships. One would expect the Cardi
nal veterans to achieve this goal, but it was the
freshmen who delivered.
Stanford freshmen K.C. Corkery and
James Pade won the doubles competition at
the regionals, held at Saint Mary's on Tues
day, after beating the No. 2,3, 5 and 10 seeds.
With this victory, their first in a collegiate
tournament, the duo secured a berth in the
national championships, to be held Nov. 7-10
in Dallas.
The 99-player field of the singles competi
tion included top-seeded senior David Martin,
No. 4 senior Scott Lipsky, freshmen K.C. Cork
ery, Jon Wong and James Pade, sophomores
Phil Sheng, Joe Kao and Sam Warburg and se
nior Carter Morris.
The doubles final was all-Cardinal, as Cork
er) and Pade battled fellow teammates Morris
and Warburg. The freshmen came out on top as
they defeated fifth-seeded Morris and Warburg
8-5 to post their fifth win in three days. In ad
vancing to the final, the freshman duo pro
duced an impressive 8-5 upset victory over sec
ond-seeded Ari Strasberg and Alex Vlaski of
Washington.
While no other Stanford competitors
earned berths to the championships at the re
gionals, Martin already has qualified for the
singles competition in Dallas, as has the doubles
team of Lipsky and Martin.
Sheng and Wong were defeated in the third
round of doubles on Monday. This was the first
collegiate tournament for Sheng and Pade.
"We played competitively against every
one," said head coach Dick Gould. "However,
there were some matches we could have put
away with one or two points."
Associate head coach John Whitlinger ex
presses optimism in the team's year outlook.
"It was a good tournament, and it was great
for us to see the whole team in action," Wh
litinger said. "I'm really looking forward to the

upcoming season. This tournament was a
building block. It makes me really anxious to
get into the meat of our schedule. This may
have been the strongest field we've ever faced.
All of the schools had their top players present.
I feel we represented ourselves very well."
The Cardinal was pitted against some of the
top teams in collegiate tennis, including Cal
and Washington.
"The tournament gave us the indication that
Washington, Cal and UCLA are all strong
teams this year," Could said. "They essentially
have their whole teams from last year, with the
possibility of picking up new players for the
spring. On the other hand, we have lost two
players. We have our work cut out for us."
The depth and talent of the Stanford dou
bles players was evident at the regionals, as evi

denced by the all-Cardinal final, and the Stan
ford coaches believe this will pay off especially
well as the season progresses.
"We have a lot of guys that can play doubles
well," Whitlinger said. "That can be an impor
tant point when we get into the heart of the sea
son. I like what I saw in our doubles teams.
There will be a very fine line as to who wins
down the road, and doubles can be a very im
portant part of that."
An equally if not more encouraging indica
tor of the team's potential is the success coming
from its younger members.
"It was encouraging to see the play of fresh
men K.C. Corker) and James fade in a tour
nament," Could said. "They appear to be ready
to give us great firepower and great depth. This
could be the making of a great team."
