# Olympics on the farm?
## Stanford, Bay Area await 2012 Olympic decision 
### ALISON PIERCE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Since 1998, the Bay Area has envisioned hosting
the 2012 Summer Olympics, a plan that would
thrust the Stanford campus into the world's spot
light as a key venue in the Games. After four years of
rigorous activity, the Bay Area Sports Organizing
Committee's bid for the 2012 games — which
would bring several events and the hallowed open
ing and closing ceremonies to Stanford — faces its
day of reckoning Saturday.
The U.S. Olympic Committee will decide this
weekend whether San Francisco or New York will
be the city presented to the International Olympic

Committee in 2005 as the U.S. entry to host the
2012 Games.
With officials mum on the relative merits of the
two finalists' bids, the public is left to speculate about
which factors will decide the fate of their Olympic
dreams. Many have posited that New York has an
edge because of "Sept. 11 sympathy," but others
contend that the Bay Area's more financially practi
cable, "athlete-centric" plan could sway the USOC.
For its part, the USOC has stated that it will pick
the city whose proposal gives it the best chance of
beating out stiff international competition when the
lOC names the 2012 host two years from now.
Another important criterion of the USOC's deci
sion is whether a city's bid leaves anv financial wind-

fall after the Games are over. Historically, the
Olympics have turned a profit only when held in the
United States, a fact that the US()C hopes will help
establish the United States as a serious international
contender for 2012.
Other factors being considered by the USOC
range from the quality of housing at the proposed
athlete villages to how much of the sports infra
structure needed for 2012 is already in place.
According to BASOC, San Francisco has all the
attributes of a winning city and more. First, San
Francisco's game plan is fiscally conservative with a
very low capital investment, leading to projections
of more than $400 million in profit from the Games.
I his contrasts with New York's bid, which has the

largest proposed budget in ()lympic history at an es
timated $3.2 billion, over $1 billion more than
BASOC is planning to spend.
"We have a sound, conservative financial plan to
create an unprecedented legacy for the IOC," said
HASOC Bid Director Bob Stiles. "Besides the exist
ing sports infrastructure, we have all the accommo
dations, all the facilities, and we have the trans
portation infrastructure in place. There is no major
construction to do."
Much of this infrastructure includes the expect
ed use of Stanford's sports and housing facilities, in
cluding a major renovation to Stanford Stadium,
which would be the venue for track and field and

the opening and closing cere
monies.
According to BASOC's bid,
Stanford would also host the soft
ball, archery, swimming, diving
and modern pentathlon competi
tions and serve as an Olympic Vil
lage for media and referees,
though Stanford and BASOC do
not have a specific agreement for
the University's role in place.
"We have a memorandum of
understanding with BASOC toco
operate with them and develop a
plan with use of our facilities but
without specification with ... what
would be required," said Isaac
Stein, the president of the Stanford
Board of Trustees.
Internationally, San Francisco's
image may be one of the strongest
assets that the USOC will have to
leverage. San Francisco will have a
competitive platform showcasing
American beauty instead of Ameri
can power, steering away from
anti-American sentiment abroad.
San Francisco has great diversity in
its neighborhoods, a high-tech
profile, ideal weather and experi
ence hosting major events, accord
ing to BASOC.
"Eighty percent of our venues
exist, we have the best conditions
for athletes, great weather and
great plans," Stiles said. "Particu
larly the weather is very favorable.
We are the world's favorite city."
Stiles refrained from speaking

directly to the advantages that he
believes San Francisco has over
New York, but he is confident in
San Francisco's qualities as a host
city not only for the U.S. bid but
as a competitor on the interna
tional level. That sentiment was
echoed by Anne Cribbs '79, the
CEO of BASOC.
"San Francisco is a diverse city,
and people pretty much believe
I hat around the world," Cribbs told
ihe Associated Press. "1 think peo
ple will leel right at home here.
Like New York, we're a great in
ternational city."
Both cities have had their prob
lems with the bid process so far.
There have been unconfirmed re
ports that the Bay Area is having
difficulties securing land and
venue space, possibly even at Stan
ford. New York is facing vocal op
position from politicians and
neighborhood groups to the pro
posed Olympic stadium in West

Manhattan, Olympic Village in
Queens and a rowing venue in
Flushing Meadows.
But all of the headaches are to
be expected, given the magnitude
of the bids and the significance of
hosting the ()lympic Games.
"It's a long, grueling process,"
American lOC member Anita De-
Frantz said to the Associated Press.
"In fact, I'm surprised they would
still want to do it after going
through all that."
Should San Francisco be select
ed by the USOC on Saturday, the
city would face a formidable chal
lenge leading up to the lOC's deci
sion in 2005, but one that the hard
working staff of BASC )C is eager to
undertake.
"We'd have to begin working
with the USOC to develop our in
ternational campaign," Stiles said.
"It's a big job."
