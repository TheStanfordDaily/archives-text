## Stanford, Bay Area await 2012 Olympic decision 
### ALISON PIERCE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Since 1998, the Bay Area has envisioned hosting
the 2012 Summer Olympics, a plan that would
thrust the Stanford campus into the world's spot
light as a key venue in the Games. After four years of
rigorous activity, the Bay Area Sports Organizing
Committee's bid for the 2012 games — which
would bring several events and the hallowed open
ing and closing ceremonies to Stanford — faces its
day of reckoning Saturday.
The U.S. Olympic Committee will decide this
weekend whether San Francisco or New York will
be the city presented to the International Olympic

Committee in 2005 as the U.S. entry to host the
2012 Games.
With officials mum on the relative merits of the
two finalists' bids, the public is left to speculate about
which factors will decide the fate of their Olympic
dreams. Many have posited that New York has an
edge because of "Sept. 11 sympathy," but others
contend that the Bay Area's more financially practi
cable, "athlete-centric" plan could sway the USOC.
For its part, the USOC has stated that it will pick
the city whose proposal gives it the best chance of
beating out stiff international competition when the
lOC names the 2012 host two years from now.
Another important criterion of the USOC's deci
sion is whether a city's bid leaves anv financial wind-

fall after the Games are over. Historically, the
Olympics have turned a profit only when held in the
United States, a fact that the US()C hopes will help
establish the United States as a serious international
contender for 2012.
Other factors being considered by the USOC
range from the quality of housing at the proposed
athlete villages to how much of the sports infra
structure needed for 2012 is already in place.
According to BASOC, San Francisco has all the
attributes of a winning city and more. First, San
Francisco's game plan is fiscally conservative with a
very low capital investment, leading to projections
of more than $400 million in profit from the Games.
I his contrasts with New York's bid, which has the

largest proposed budget in ()lympic history at an es
timated $3.2 billion, over $1 billion more than
BASOC is planning to spend.
"We have a sound, conservative financial plan to
create an unprecedented legacy for the IOC," said
HASOC Bid Director Bob Stiles. "Besides the exist
ing sports infrastructure, we have all the accommo
dations, all the facilities, and we have the trans
portation infrastructure in place. There is no major
construction to do."
Much of this infrastructure includes the expect
ed use of Stanford's sports and housing facilities, in
cluding a major renovation to Stanford Stadium,
which would be the venue for track and field and
