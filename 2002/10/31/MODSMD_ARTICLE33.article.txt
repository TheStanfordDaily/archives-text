# Community divided over S.F. bid's impact on Farm
## $300 million renovation to Stanford Stadium among proposals in Olympic bid 
### ALEX BLEYLEBEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Two days remain before the United States
Olympics Committee selects the official Ameri
can bid city for the 2012 Summer Games, a de
cision that carries considerable potential conse
quences for Stanford. The campus is a core of
the Bay Area's bid and would host several large
events, including the opening and closing cere
moniesâ€” prompting some to wonder how
campus life would be altered during prepara
tions lo host the Games.
The Stanford campus would showcase the
track and field competitions, the swimming and
diving events, the modern pentathlon, archery,
badminton and softball. In total, about $450
million would be pumped into existing and
temporary facilities, and the school would be
thrust to the forefront of international attention
during two weeks of mid-summer.
While Stanford has already agreed in princi
ple to let the Bay Area Sports Organizing Com
mittee renovate and use several of its facilities, it
has not yet studied in detail what the impact
would be on the campus as a whole, before and
during the Games. Some Stanford community
members have expressed concern about the po
tential disruption of the large-scale construction
projects, but administrators and BASOC offi
cials seem unworried, focusing instead on the

overwhelming benefits that the Olympics could
bring.
"In addition to the subsidized construction
on campus, I can't imagine any better way to put
Stanford on the map than hosting the
Olympics," said Kenneth Garrett "02, who
worked with BASOC as a student representa
tive. "The international renown of the (Mympics
would allow Stanford to showcase its best quali
ties, enabling the University to continue to at
tract the best students and professors from
around the world."
Planners at BASOC and Stanford said that
along with the international recognition associ
ated with the games, Stanford would benefit
from a $300 million overhaul of the football sta
dium, the prestige of playing a role in such a
large international event, and a new high-speed
train service into San Francisco.
BASOC CEO Anne Cribbs '79 said that
Stanford is a fitting place to host a component
of the Olympics because of its well-developed
athletic facilities and its influential interna
tional standing.
"One of the things I love about Stanford
being involved is that Stanford's community has
people from around the world, and the
Olympics seem like a good extension of that,"
she said.
BASC)C, whose bid is competing against New
York City's bid in Saturday's selection process,
has budgeted funding for several major renova
tions on campus to prepare it for the Games if
the Bay Area is selected by the International
Olympic Committee as the host city in 2005.
