# Community divided over S.F. bid's impact on Farm
## $300 million renovation to Stanford Stadium among proposals in Olympic bid 
### ALEX BLEYLEBEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Two days remain before the United States
Olympics Committee selects the official Ameri
can bid city for the 2012 Summer Games, a de
cision that carries considerable potential conse
quences for Stanford. The campus is a core of
the Bay Area's bid and would host several large
events, including the opening and closing cere
monies— prompting some to wonder how
campus life would be altered during prepara
tions lo host the Games.
The Stanford campus would showcase the
track and field competitions, the swimming and
diving events, the modern pentathlon, archery,
badminton and softball. In total, about $450
million would be pumped into existing and
temporary facilities, and the school would be
thrust to the forefront of international attention
during two weeks of mid-summer.
While Stanford has already agreed in princi
ple to let the Bay Area Sports Organizing Com
mittee renovate and use several of its facilities, it
has not yet studied in detail what the impact
would be on the campus as a whole, before and
during the Games. Some Stanford community
members have expressed concern about the po
tential disruption of the large-scale construction
projects, but administrators and BASOC offi
cials seem unworried, focusing instead on the

overwhelming benefits that the Olympics could
bring.
"In addition to the subsidized construction
on campus, I can't imagine any better way to put
Stanford on the map than hosting the
Olympics," said Kenneth Garrett "02, who
worked with BASOC as a student representa
tive. "The international renown of the (Mympics
would allow Stanford to showcase its best quali
ties, enabling the University to continue to at
tract the best students and professors from
around the world."
Planners at BASOC and Stanford said that
along with the international recognition associ
ated with the games, Stanford would benefit
from a $300 million overhaul of the football sta
dium, the prestige of playing a role in such a
large international event, and a new high-speed
train service into San Francisco.
BASOC CEO Anne Cribbs '79 said that
Stanford is a fitting place to host a component
of the Olympics because of its well-developed
athletic facilities and its influential interna
tional standing.
"One of the things I love about Stanford
being involved is that Stanford's community has
people from around the world, and the
Olympics seem like a good extension of that,"
she said.
BASC)C, whose bid is competing against New
York City's bid in Saturday's selection process,
has budgeted funding for several major renova
tions on campus to prepare it for the Games if
the Bay Area is selected by the International
Olympic Committee as the host city in 2005.
BASOC would cover about half the
costs of'a refurbished stadium and
completely fund all other renova
tions and temporary facilities.
Yet, even though Stanford has
agreed to let BASOC use some of
the venues on campus, and
BASOC alone has budgeted close
to $300 million for campus reno
vations, the extent of the agree
ment has still not passed the pre
liminary stages. Despite the speci
ficity of planned renovations on
campus, both Stanford and
BASOC say that they have not yet
thought about their overall impact
on University life.
All those contacted at BASOC
and in the Stanford administration
said that while Stanford has agreed
to lend its facilities to the games, it
is an agreement on principle with
most details still to be worked out.
"This is a great proposal, but
we're 10 years out, and we haven't
been selected yet," said BASOC
Communications Director Tony
Winnicker. "What's important at
this point are the partnerships."
The final site for the Olympics
will be chosen in 2005, and plan
ners say that to make detail-orient
ed commitments before then
would be premature.
"Stanford would change in a
number of wavs, but then it also

wouldn't change that much," Win
nicker said. "The athletic campus
is such a great Olympic park-like
environment as it is .. . A perma
nent footprint on what is already
there would be limited."
Special Assistant to the Presi
dent Jeffrey Wachtel said that
Stanford has had success in the
past hosting large events without
straining the rest of campus, and
he thinks the Olympics can be
managed in the same fashion.
"Anything of that magnitude
will have some effect on the cam
pus, but we participate in the bid
process, and there will be a lot of
work to do [on the agreement] if
the Bay Area is the recipient of the
U.S. bid," he said. "If BASOC gets
the bid, we plan to roll up our
sleeves to work it out with mem
bers of their committee to plan
everything."
Yet others wonder how the
campus can prepare for and host
key events of the Olympic games
without suffering major inconve
niences, and question whether this
can be dismissed as a "detail" to be
worked out later.
"1 think that hosting many of
the major events of the Olympic
games will bring many benefits to
Stanford, both materially and by
adding to our international pres
tige," said sophomore Dana
Schmidt. "But I'm a little worried
about how campus life will be af
fected in the years before then.
Although there is a lot of time left

to plan construction in a way that
minimizes these effects, I find it a
little odd that Stanford has
agreed to this large commitment
seemingly without studying its
possible impact."
The most work needs to be
done on Stanford Stadium, which
would be almost completely re
built in a process lasting several
years, likely forcing the displace
ment of the football team for at
least two seasons. But other reno
vations, like a new temporary
swimming and diving stadium and
heavy security precautions, would
not be insignificant given ihe mag
nitude and popularity of the
Olympics.
"1 would hope there wouldn't
be that much of an inconvenience
on campus leading up to the
event," Winnicker said. "There
would certainly be a lot of activity
in the area leading up to the
event, and then during the ensu
ing games," he said, adding that if
the Bay Area gets the bid, then
Stanford will negotiate an agree
ment that minimizes the impact
on campus.
Sophomore Kian Eiketari also
hoped that the games would not
overshadow Stanford's primary
mission as a scholarly institution.
"It would definitely put our cam
pus on the international map, but
it could detrimentally create the
view that the university is an ath
letic institution and not primarily
an academic one," he said.

swimming and diving stadium and
heavy security precautions, would
not be insignificant given ihe mag
nitude and popularity of the
Olympics.
"1 would hope there wouldn't
be that much of an inconvenience
on campus leading up to the
event," Winnicker said. "There
would certainly be a lot of activity
in the area leading up to the
event, and then during the ensu
ing games," he said, adding that if
the Bay Area gets the bid, then
Stanford will negotiate an agree
ment that minimizes the impact
on campus.
Sophomore Kian Eiketari also
hoped that the games would not
overshadow Stanford's primary
mission as a scholarly institution.
"It would definitely put our cam
pus on the international map, but
it could detrimentally create the
view that the university is an ath
letic institution and not primarily
an academic one," he said.
Two days remain before the United States
Olympics Committee selects the official Ameri
can bid city for the 2012 Summer Games, a de
cision that carries considerable potential conse
quences for Stanford. The campus is a core of
the Bay Area's bid and would host several large
events, including the opening and closing cere
monies— prompting some to wonder how
campus life would be altered during prepara
tions lo host the Games.
The Stanford campus would showcase the
track and field competitions, the swimming and
diving events, the modern pentathlon, archery,
badminton and softball. In total, about $450
million would be pumped into existing and
temporary facilities, and the school would be
thrust to the forefront of international attention
during two weeks of mid-summer.
While Stanford has already agreed in princi
ple to let the Bay Area Sports Organizing Com
mittee renovate and use several of its facilities, it
has not yet studied in detail what the impact
would be on the campus as a whole, before and
during the Games. Some Stanford community
members have expressed concern about the po
tential disruption of the large-scale construction
projects, but administrators and BASOC offi
cials seem unworried, focusing instead on the

overwhelming benefits that the Olympics could
bring.
"In addition to the subsidized construction
on campus, I can't imagine any better way to put
Stanford on the map than hosting the
Olympics," said Kenneth Garrett "02, who
worked with BASOC as a student representa
tive. "The international renown of the (Mympics
would allow Stanford to showcase its best quali
ties, enabling the University to continue to at
tract the best students and professors from
around the world."
Planners at BASOC and Stanford said that
along with the international recognition associ
ated with the games, Stanford would benefit
from a $300 million overhaul of the football sta
dium, the prestige of playing a role in such a
large international event, and a new high-speed
train service into San Francisco.
BASOC CEO Anne Cribbs '79 said that
Stanford is a fitting place to host a component
of the Olympics because of its well-developed
athletic facilities and its influential interna
tional standing.
"One of the things I love about Stanford
being involved is that Stanford's community has
people from around the world, and the
Olympics seem like a good extension of that,"
she said.
BASC)C, whose bid is competing against New
York City's bid in Saturday's selection process,
has budgeted funding for several major renova
tions on campus to prepare it for the Games if
the Bay Area is selected by the International
Olympic Committee as the host city in 2005.
BASOC would cover about half the
costs of'a refurbished stadium and
completely fund all other renova
tions and temporary facilities.
Yet, even though Stanford has
agreed to let BASOC use some of
the venues on campus, and
BASOC alone has budgeted close
to $300 million for campus reno
vations, the extent of the agree
ment has still not passed the pre
liminary stages. Despite the speci
ficity of planned renovations on
campus, both Stanford and
BASOC say that they have not yet
thought about their overall impact
on University life.
All those contacted at BASOC
and in the Stanford administration
said that while Stanford has agreed
to lend its facilities to the games, it
is an agreement on principle with
most details still to be worked out.
"This is a great proposal, but
we're 10 years out, and we haven't
been selected yet," said BASOC
Communications Director Tony
Winnicker. "What's important at
this point are the partnerships."
The final site for the Olympics
will be chosen in 2005, and plan
ners say that to make detail-orient
ed commitments before then
would be premature.
"Stanford would change in a
number of wavs, but then it also

wouldn't change that much," Win
nicker said. "The athletic campus
is such a great Olympic park-like
environment as it is .. . A perma
nent footprint on what is already
there would be limited."
Special Assistant to the Presi
dent Jeffrey Wachtel said that
Stanford has had success in the
past hosting large events without
straining the rest of campus, and
he thinks the Olympics can be
managed in the same fashion.
"Anything of that magnitude
will have some effect on the cam
pus, but we participate in the bid
process, and there will be a lot of
work to do [on the agreement] if
the Bay Area is the recipient of the
U.S. bid," he said. "If BASOC gets
the bid, we plan to roll up our
sleeves to work it out with mem
bers of their committee to plan
everything."
Yet others wonder how the
campus can prepare for and host
key events of the Olympic games
without suffering major inconve
niences, and question whether this
can be dismissed as a "detail" to be
worked out later.
"1 think that hosting many of
the major events of the Olympic
games will bring many benefits to
Stanford, both materially and by
adding to our international pres
tige," said sophomore Dana
Schmidt. "But I'm a little worried
about how campus life will be af
fected in the years before then.
Although there is a lot of time left

to plan construction in a way that
minimizes these effects, I find it a
little odd that Stanford has
agreed to this large commitment
seemingly without studying its
possible impact."
The most work needs to be
done on Stanford Stadium, which
would be almost completely re
built in a process lasting several
years, likely forcing the displace
ment of the football team for at
least two seasons. But other reno
vations, like a new temporary
swimming and diving stadium and
heavy security precautions, would
not be insignificant given ihe mag
nitude and popularity of the
Olympics.
