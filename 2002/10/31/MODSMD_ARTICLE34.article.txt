It's one of the Stanford Department of Ath
letics' favorite statistics to throw out:
If Stanford were a country, it would have fin
ished in the top 20 in the medal standings
among the nations competing at the last three
Summer Olympics.
The 16 gold medals raked in by current and
former Stanford athletes at the 1996 Atlanta
Games would have placed the University in a tie
for fourth with China for the most golds. Stan
lord's 10 golds in Barcelona in 1992 would have
landed it in ninth, and its 19 total medals that
year would have placed the University in 13th
overall.
Stanford sent 34 athletes and coaches to the
Sydney Games in 2000, adding four golds and
six other medals to the University's astounding
running total.
Given its unparalleled Olympic success fora
university, it's not surprising that the Stanford
Athletics Department is brimming with people
eager to see San Francisco's bid for the 2012
Summer Olympics — with its use of the Stan
ford campus as a centerpiece for the Games —
succeed.
"When you think of Olympic Games and the
San Francisco Bay Area, your next thought is

Stanford University," said Stanford women's
swimming coach Richard Quick, who coached
the U.S. Olympic swim teams in 1996and 2000.
"We've had so many Olympians over the years
and had such excellence in our Olympic sports.
It's a natural thought process — San Francisco
Bay Area . . . Olympics . . . Stanford."
I hat's especially true in Quick's discipline.
Over the last four Olympiad, Stanford has pro
duced a number of the Olympic gold medalists
that have become synonymous with American
swimming: Pablo Morales '87, Jenna Johnson
'89, Janet Evans '91, Summer Sanders '92,
Jenny Thompson '95, Catherine Fox '00 and
Misty Hyman '01. Stanford swimmers and
divers have won over 50 gold medals since the
1920 Games in Antwerp.
With the Bay Area Sports Organizing Com
mittee's bid for the 2012 Olympics calling for
the swimming and diving competitions to take
place at Stanford, Quick and the rest of the Car
dinal swimming program are avid supporters of
the movement to bring the Games to t he Farm.
"I'm absolutely convinced that the Olympics
are worth the cost," Quick said. "It would be
great for both the San Francisco Bay Area and
Stanford University. This will be the only time
that people in our lifetime would get to partici
pate in the Olympic Games in this area."
Stanford's ()lympic success has not been lim
ited to the pool — the hardwood on the Maples
Pavilion volleyball and basketball courts has also
produced its fair share of Olympic greats.
