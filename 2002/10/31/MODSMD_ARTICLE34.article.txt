# Stanford boasts long, rich Summer Olympic history
## Resident Olympic athletes and coaches express support for University's involvement in bid 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
It's one of the Stanford Department of Ath
letics' favorite statistics to throw out:
If Stanford were a country, it would have fin
ished in the top 20 in the medal standings
among the nations competing at the last three
Summer Olympics.
The 16 gold medals raked in by current and
former Stanford athletes at the 1996 Atlanta
Games would have placed the University in a tie
for fourth with China for the most golds. Stan
lord's 10 golds in Barcelona in 1992 would have
landed it in ninth, and its 19 total medals that
year would have placed the University in 13th
overall.
Stanford sent 34 athletes and coaches to the
Sydney Games in 2000, adding four golds and
six other medals to the University's astounding
running total.
Given its unparalleled Olympic success fora
university, it's not surprising that the Stanford
Athletics Department is brimming with people
eager to see San Francisco's bid for the 2012
Summer Olympics — with its use of the Stan
ford campus as a centerpiece for the Games —
succeed.
"When you think of Olympic Games and the
San Francisco Bay Area, your next thought is

Stanford University," said Stanford women's
swimming coach Richard Quick, who coached
the U.S. Olympic swim teams in 1996and 2000.
"We've had so many Olympians over the years
and had such excellence in our Olympic sports.
It's a natural thought process — San Francisco
Bay Area . . . Olympics . . . Stanford."
I hat's especially true in Quick's discipline.
Over the last four Olympiad, Stanford has pro
duced a number of the Olympic gold medalists
that have become synonymous with American
swimming: Pablo Morales '87, Jenna Johnson
'89, Janet Evans '91, Summer Sanders '92,
Jenny Thompson '95, Catherine Fox '00 and
Misty Hyman '01. Stanford swimmers and
divers have won over 50 gold medals since the
1920 Games in Antwerp.
With the Bay Area Sports Organizing Com
mittee's bid for the 2012 Olympics calling for
the swimming and diving competitions to take
place at Stanford, Quick and the rest of the Car
dinal swimming program are avid supporters of
the movement to bring the Games to t he Farm.
"I'm absolutely convinced that the Olympics
are worth the cost," Quick said. "It would be
great for both the San Francisco Bay Area and
Stanford University. This will be the only time
that people in our lifetime would get to partici
pate in the Olympic Games in this area."
Stanford's ()lympic success has not been lim
ited to the pool — the hardwood on the Maples
Pavilion volleyball and basketball courts has also
produced its fair share of Olympic greats.
Senior Logan loin, a three-time All-Ameri
can outside hitter on the Stanford volleyball
team, is the latest addition to the
list of Cardinal players who have
donned Team USA jerseys in
Olympic competition. Since Kim
Oden '86 was named Best 11 itter at
the 198cS Seoul Games, several
Stanford players have shined on
the international stage.
Following the Sydney Games in
the fall of 2000, Tom became the
first player to return to NCAA play
after competing in the Olympic
volleyball tournament.
BASOC's plans would have the
volleyball competition in Berkeley
in 2012, but Tom is no less enthu
siastic about Stanford's involve
ment with the push to bring the
Olympics to the Bay Area.
"Stanford has great facilities,
there are great alumni, and there
is a great fan base," Tom said.
"People around here are sports fa
natics. I think there would be
much more of a community feel
ing here than there was in Sydney.

Sydney was great, but I think it
would be amazing here."
Stanford women's basketball
coach Tar a VanDerveer also sees
something amazing in store for the
University should the BASOC bid
succeed. And she has plenty of per
sonal experience to give credence
to her claims — VanDerveer
coached the U.S. women's team at
the 1996 Atlanta Games, leading
the team, which included former
player Jennifer Azzi '90 and Katy
Stediug '90, to the gold medal.
"It would be a lot of work, and
there might be lots of problems,
but there is something special in
seeing world-class athletes per
form," VanDerveer said. "It
would be disruptive to the nor
mal flow and routine at Stanford,
but beyond that, just the opening
ceremonies would be unbeliev
able. Few people ever compete in
the Olympics, and most don't
even ever see them, so it would
be a great opportunity to have
them here."
That the Olympics — and all of
the construction the BASOC bid
calls lor on several of Stanford's

athletic facilities — would catise a
number of inconveniences for
some Cardinal teams is basically a
given. But the prevailing senti
ment in much of the Athletic De
partment, especially among those
with any Olympic experience, is
that there is really no question at
all as to whether the venture would
be worthwhile lor the University.
Such are the feelings expressed
by Stanford baseball coach Mark
Marquess, who coached the U.S.
Olympic baseball team in Seoul.
Marquess' home field, Sunken Di
amond, would be used for the
Olympic Softball competition and
the equestrian event in the mod
ern pentathlon in 2012, but he still
feels that the uniqueness of the op
portunity to host the Games out
weighs most other concerns.
"1 don't know the financial im
pact [of the Games on Stanford],
but t here is a tradeoff with all of the
exposure the Olympics create,"
Marquess said. "It's a once-in-a
lifetime opportunity if it happens,
and that's why Stanford is involved
.. . 1 think Stanford's involvement
would be good. It would be great
for the area and a great honor.
Hopefully, it works out, and the
Bay Area gets the bid."
The USOC's decision between
San Francisco and New York is still
up in the air, and even if the Bay-
Area gets selected, there is a long
road ahead to the Games actually
coming to Stanford. But one
thing's for sure — if it were up to
Stanford's resident Olympians,
the Olympic flame would be shin
ing brightly over the Farm in 2012.
