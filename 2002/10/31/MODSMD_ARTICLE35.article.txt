# S.F. bid calls for brand new Stanford Stadium for 2012
## Stanford Olympic Venues 
### 
Stadium would host cere
monies, track and field
A i the heart of Stanford's involve
ment in the San Francisco bid —
and at the core of the BASOC bid
itself — is the plan to renovate
Stanford Stadium to make it the center
piece of the 2012 Games. The $338 mil
lion plan would replace the 81-year-old,
decaying stadium with one of the world's
most beautiful athletic complexes.
Stanford Stadium would pla) host to the
opening and closing ceremonies and
would also be the venue for the track and
field competition. Given the popularity of
these events, the remodeled stadium would
be the largest venue for the 2012 Games.
"Remodeled" is a fairly loose descrip
tion, however, as few traces of the original
stadium — both in design and in structure
— would remain. The current 85,500-seat
stadium would be replaced with a state-of
the-art complex that would hold 100,000
during the Games.
Of the 100,000 seats in the stadium,
85,500 would be open to the public. Ac
cording to figures in its budget, BASOC
anticipates that 1.4 million spectators
would pass through Stanford Stadium
during the Olympics.
The new stadium would be designed so
that it can have its seating reduced to
around 60,000 before and after the
Olympics, putting to rest any fears that the
Stanford football team is going to be play
ing its home games in front of thousands
of empty seats. The structure of the stadi
um would allow for the additional 40,000
seats to be added back without much diffi
culty for large events that Stanford want
ed to host before and after 2012.
The stadium is also being designed so
that the track used for Olympic competi
tion can be easily removed and reinstalled,
allowing Stanford Stadium to host large
track meets before and after the Games.
The track, which will be built on raised
platforms to keep it close in height to the
stands, will be interchangeable with addi
tional lower rows of seating that could be
easily added for football games to bring
the crowd closer to the field.
Though the Stanford football team
would eventually end up with one of
the nicest college stadiums in the coun
try, it would have to pay a pretty steep
price for it. The Cardinal squad would
be left homeless for at least two seasons
during the initial construction of the
new stadium.
Construction on the stadium would
begin almost immediately after San Fran
cisco was picked by the International
Olympic Committee in the fall of 2005.
Following the conclusion of the 2005 112 oot
ball season, the old Stanford Stadium
would be torn down, and the new one
would begin to take form.
That means that Stanford would have
to find somewhere else to play its football
games in 2006 and possibly in 2007.
There is only speculation at this point as to
where Cardinal home games would be
played, but Spartan Stadium in San Jose

and 3Com Park in San Francisco are the
obvious alternatives.
l he stadium would hold about 60,000
when its initial construction was complet
ed in 2007, then have its capacity in
creased to 100,000 between January and
June 2012.
Following the Olympics, the stadium
would then play host to the opening and
closing ceremonies and the track and field
competition of the Paralympics, which
would take place the last two weeks of Au
gust. The stadium should be ready for the
Stanford football team's 2012 season.
Cobb Track and Angell Field, the home
of Stanford's track and field teams, would
serve as a warmup facility. The track,
which played host to the U.S. Track and
Field Championships this past June,
would be connected to Stanford Stadium
by a tunnel.
A number of support facilities would
be built around the outside of the stadi
um. some of which would be built over
Maloney Field and the practice fields be
hind it.
The Olympic marathon would start
and finish in Stanford Stadium and pro
ceed along a course that includes a long
stretch of Campus Drive and two trips

around the Oval.
The $338 million price tag for the sta
dium makes it the largest expense in terms
of venues in BASOC's bid. The stadium is
also the only Stanford venue that would
require the University to contribute any
financial support.
According to BASOC's budget, Stan
ford would he responsible for $165 mil
lion of the stadium's renovation cost, a fig
ure comparable to what some think it
would cost Stanford to renovate the dete
riorating .stadium itself. I lie budget does
not give a timeline for when the Universi
ty would be expected to contribute its 49-
percent share of the stadium's cost.
Ticket sales at Stanford Stadium over
the course of the Olympics and the Par
alympics would generate over $250 mil
lion according to projections in
BASOC's budget.
The 2012 Olympics would not be the
first major international event to take
place at Stanford Stadium. Soccer games
for the 1984 Los Angeles Games, the 1994
World Cup and the 1999 Women's World
Cup, a historic track meet between the
United States and the Soviet Union in
1962 and Super Bowl XIX in 1985 all took
place in the stadium.

According to BASOC's budget, Stan
ford would he responsible for $165 mil
lion of the stadium's renovation cost, a fig
ure comparable to what some think it
would cost Stanford to renovate the dete
riorating .stadium itself. I lie budget does
not give a timeline for when the Universi
ty would be expected to contribute its 49-
percent share of the stadium's cost.
Ticket sales at Stanford Stadium over
the course of the Olympics and the Par
alympics would generate over $250 mil
lion according to projections in
BASOC's budget.
The 2012 Olympics would not be the
first major international event to take
place at Stanford Stadium. Soccer games
for the 1984 Los Angeles Games, the 1994
World Cup and the 1999 Women's World
Cup, a historic track meet between the
United States and the Soviet Union in
1962 and Super Bowl XIX in 1985 all took
place in the stadium.



Stadium would host cere
monies, track and field
A i the heart of Stanford's involve
ment in the San Francisco bid —
and at the core of the BASOC bid
itself — is the plan to renovate
Stanford Stadium to make it the center
piece of the 2012 Games. The $338 mil
lion plan would replace the 81-year-old,
decaying stadium with one of the world's
most beautiful athletic complexes.
Stanford Stadium would pla) host to the
opening and closing ceremonies and
would also be the venue for the track and
field competition. Given the popularity of
these events, the remodeled stadium would
be the largest venue for the 2012 Games.
"Remodeled" is a fairly loose descrip
tion, however, as few traces of the original
stadium — both in design and in structure
— would remain. The current 85,500-seat
stadium would be replaced with a state-of
the-art complex that would hold 100,000
during the Games.
Of the 100,000 seats in the stadium,
85,500 would be open to the public. Ac
cording to figures in its budget, BASOC
anticipates that 1.4 million spectators
would pass through Stanford Stadium
during the Olympics.
The new stadium would be designed so
that it can have its seating reduced to
around 60,000 before and after the
Olympics, putting to rest any fears that the
Stanford football team is going to be play
ing its home games in front of thousands
of empty seats. The structure of the stadi
um would allow for the additional 40,000
seats to be added back without much diffi
culty for large events that Stanford want
ed to host before and after 2012.
The stadium is also being designed so
that the track used for Olympic competi
tion can be easily removed and reinstalled,
allowing Stanford Stadium to host large
track meets before and after the Games.
The track, which will be built on raised
platforms to keep it close in height to the
stands, will be interchangeable with addi
tional lower rows of seating that could be
easily added for football games to bring
the crowd closer to the field.
Though the Stanford football team
would eventually end up with one of
the nicest college stadiums in the coun
try, it would have to pay a pretty steep
price for it. The Cardinal squad would
be left homeless for at least two seasons
during the initial construction of the
new stadium.
Construction on the stadium would
begin almost immediately after San Fran
cisco was picked by the International
Olympic Committee in the fall of 2005.
Following the conclusion of the 2005 112 oot
ball season, the old Stanford Stadium
would be torn down, and the new one
would begin to take form.
That means that Stanford would have
to find somewhere else to play its football
games in 2006 and possibly in 2007.
There is only speculation at this point as to
where Cardinal home games would be
played, but Spartan Stadium in San Jose

and 3Com Park in San Francisco are the
obvious alternatives.
l he stadium would hold about 60,000
when its initial construction was complet
ed in 2007, then have its capacity in
creased to 100,000 between January and
June 2012.
Following the Olympics, the stadium
would then play host to the opening and
closing ceremonies and the track and field
competition of the Paralympics, which
would take place the last two weeks of Au
gust. The stadium should be ready for the
Stanford football team's 2012 season.
Cobb Track and Angell Field, the home
of Stanford's track and field teams, would
serve as a warmup facility. The track,
which played host to the U.S. Track and
Field Championships this past June,
would be connected to Stanford Stadium
by a tunnel.
A number of support facilities would
be built around the outside of the stadi
um. some of which would be built over
Maloney Field and the practice fields be
hind it.
The Olympic marathon would start
and finish in Stanford Stadium and pro
ceed along a course that includes a long
stretch of Campus Drive and two trips

around the Oval.
The $338 million price tag for the sta
dium makes it the largest expense in terms
of venues in BASOC's bid. The stadium is
also the only Stanford venue that would
require the University to contribute any
financial support.
