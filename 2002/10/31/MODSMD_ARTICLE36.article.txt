# Archery aimed for IM fields
## 
### 
While most of the Olympic venues slated
for Stanford would be clustered togeth
er around Stanford Stadium, the Sand
Hill Fields on the west side of campus
would also see plenty of action during the Games.
The archery competition would lake place on the
West Campus Intramural Fields, where an 8,000-
seat venue would be set up for both the Olympic and
Paralympic Games.
The competition area would he set up on the
north end of the Sand 11 ill Fields near Pasteur Drive.
A practice field would also be set up just to the south.
A large number of supporting facilities, including
changing rooms, media areas, lounges and opera
tion centers, would be set up in the area as well, al
though everything built on the Sand Hill Fields
would be temporary in nature. All of the archery
equipment and other materials used for the venue
would be donated to Bay Area archrry clubs follow
ing the Games.
Though none of the facilities built for the archery
competition would be permanent structures, the
scale of the project is still fairly la ge. Over 7,200
seats at the archery venue would be- >pen to the pub
lic, and the $2 million price tag for the facilities at the
Sand Hill Fields would be more thai covered by the
$3 million in ticket sales that BASOC projects for the
competition in its budget.
The archery venue would require work on the
Sand Hill Fields to begin in January 2012, meaning

that the fields would not be available for winter or
spring quarter intrainurals. The structures at the site
would be built from May to July of that year leading
up to the Games.
