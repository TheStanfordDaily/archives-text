# Top college baseball stadium would become world's top Softball venue
## 
### 
Built in 1931, Sunken Diamond is one of the
oldest sports facilities still in use on the Stan
lorcl campus. The longtime home of Stan
ford baseball has gone through a number of
renovations over the last eight decades, but none of
those compare to the facelift the stadium would re
ceive as the venue for the Olympic soltball competi
tion in 2012 — assuming soltball is still an Olympic
sport in the 2012 Olympics.
Over the summer, soltball was among three sports
— baseball and modern pentathlon were the others
— that the International Olympic Committee's pro
gram commission recommended be removed from
the Games. (iolfand rugby are the sports expected to
replace those three il the lOC votes to remove them at
its meeting in Mexico City next month.
But should Softball still be a medal sport in 2012,
the Bay Area Sports Organizing Committee's bid has
big plans lor turning one of the country's most beau
tiful college baseball stadiums into the world's preem
inent softball facility.
The $2.1 million renovation, which would be com
pleted just belore the Olympics following Stanford's
2012 baseball season, would more than double the
stadium's capacity to 10,000. Currently, Sunken Dia
mond's stands hold 2,113, although grass-seating

areas along the baselines increase its capacity to 4,000.
Stands would be built over the lawn seating along
the full length of the baselines. With the fences being
brought in to 200 feet all the way around the outfield
to go from baseball to softball distances, stands would
also be built on what is currently the back half of the
baseball outfield. Sunken Diamond currently has no
seating in the area behind the fences, which is instead
lined by trees.
With the additional stands, 9,325 seats would be
open to the public for the softball competition, which
would begin July 29 and conclude with the gold
medal game on Aug. 7.
Additional locker rooms, media areas and other
support facilities would be built around the stadium,
between Sunken Diamond and the Smith Family Soft
ball Stadium and on the Artificial Turf Field.
Flie Smith Family Stadium, which opened in 2001,
would be used as a secondary playing field and as a
practice facility. The stadium currently seats 820 with
an overall capacity for 1,500, but additional seating
could allow for over 3,500 softball fans to watch games
at the alternative venue.
Once the softball competition ended, Sunken Dia
mond would also play host to the equestrian section of
the modern pentathlon — again assuming the event

is still on the summer
Games slate in 2012.
As soon as the soft
ball competition was
over, the Sunken Dia
mond field would be
resurfaced for the show
jumping course for the
pentathlon. Tempo
rary stables and other

equestrian facilities would be set up by the Artificial
Turf Field.
The men's pentathlon would take place on Aug. 1 1
across the Stanford Olympic facilities, with the
women's competition following the next day.
The total price tag for all of the work done on

Sunken Diamond would come out to about $2.6 mil
lion, all of which would be paid for by the Organizing
Committee for the Olympic Games. There is no word
on whether Stanford would keep the additional
stands built for Sunken Diamond following the
Olympics.
