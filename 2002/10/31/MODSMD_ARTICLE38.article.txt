# Arena would give Avery a new friend
## 
### 
While the renovations that
would be made to Stanford
Stadium would be large in
scale, the most extreme build
ing project on the Stanford campus for the
2012 Ciames would be the temporary swim
ming arena.
Located on what are currently the Stan
ford football practice fields between Maples
Pavilion and the Artificial Turf Field, the
temporary swimming arena will serve as
the venue for swimming, diving, synchro
nized swimming and the swimming com
ponent of the modern pentathlon.
I he $17 million facility will seat 15,000
spectators around temporary pools that
will be built in several pieces, allowing them
to be moved to another location following
the Olympics.
Hie pools and the seating area in the
arena will be covered using a state-of-the
art fabric structure roof, though the com
plex will still be open on the sides and be

hind the stands. The facility will include a
50-meter pool for the swimming competi
tion and a diving well with all of the needed
platforms and boards.
The swimming competition would take
place during the first week of the Olympics,
while diving and synchronized swimming
would be held during the second week.
Following the Olympics, the arena
would 1 lost the swimming competition for
the Paralympics during the last two weeks
of August in 2012.
The temporary swimming arena would
be taken off the football practice fields once
the Paralympics conclude. The complex
would be built according to a piecewise de
sign so that it could be transported after the
Games to another location. The pools would
be relocated to Treasure Island in San Fran
cisco, where they .would serve as an aquatics
center for underprivileged youth and as a
legacy of the 2012 (iames for the Bay Area.
The adjacent Avery Aquatic Center

would be utilized as a practice and warmup
facility for the temporary arena. Avery has
two world-class 50-meter pools, a 40-meter
pool and a fully furnished diving facility.
However, the 2,500-seat Avery is not large
enough to host the Olympic competition.
The BASOC proposal does not indicate
when construction on the temporary arena
would begin or how long it would be ex
pected to take. 1 lowever, once construction
started, the Stanford football team would
lose the use of its primary practice facilities
until the Olympics were over and the stadi
um was removed, presumably not until
after the 2012 season.
The Organizing Committee for the
Olympic Games would foot the entire price
tag for the temporary swimming arena and
the costs of replacing the practice football
fields once die .facility was.moved. BASOC.
projects over $65 million in ticket sales be
tween the Olympic and Paralympic aquatic
competitions.
