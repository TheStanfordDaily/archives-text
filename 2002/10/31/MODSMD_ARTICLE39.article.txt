# Birdies, guns and swords tabbed for Maples

### 
Maples Pavilion lias played host to con
ference and national tournaments in
basketball, volleyball, gymnastics,
fencing and wrestling, lint, if tlie
2012 Games come to Stanford, Maples will get to
host a couple of events it hasn't seen very often be
fore: badminton and the modern pentathlon.
Requiring approximately $850,000 in renova
tion costs, Maples would be the site of the Olympic
badminton tournament the first week of the
(lames before hosting the shooting and fencing
components of the modern pentathlon during
the Games' closing days.
Maples has already had some experience with
the pentathlon events, having hosted the shoot
ing and the fencing competitions during this past
summer's World Modern Pentathlon Champi
onships held around the Stanford campus.
Athletes in the modern pentathlon must fire
shots from a standing position at a target 10 meters

away, fence against every other competitor, swim
a 200-meter freestyle, complete an equestrian
jumping circuit and run a 3,000-meter cross coun
try course, all in the same day. The modern pen
tathlon is among three events being considered
for elimination from the Summer Games by the
International Olympic Committee next month.
If the competition remains a part of the
Olympics, however, Maples would play host the
shooting and fencing portions of the competition
as it did this summer.
Maples would host the badminton competition
because of its high ceilings and the fact that its air
system can be shut off so as not to interfere with
tlie shuttlecocks. Maples' bouncy floors would
provide an added bonus to one of the fastest mov
ing sports in the world.
Maples' proximity to Stanford Stadium would
also allow the badminton tournament to receive
added attention because of the increased traffic in

the area.
Following the Olympics, Maples would see a
sport its more used to hosting — though in a
much different form than it usually sees — when
the Paralympic volleyball competition takes place
in the arena in late August.
With a number of other venues with support
facilities located around Maples, few other addi
tional facilities would need to be built for the
events taking place in the arena.
The few renovations Maples would require
would not begin until June 2012, and the arena
would be ready for the Stanford women's volley
ball team's 2012 season that fall.
All of the renovations needed in Maples would
be paid for by the Olympic Games Organizing
Committee.
BASOC's budget projects over $5 million in
ticket sales for the badminton, modern pen
tathlon and Paralympic volleyball competitions.
