# Senior leads high schoolers in dialogues on race
## Cross-Cultural Talks 
### ANDREW HENDEL 
In February, senior Nina Sung will launch
a program called Students United for Racial
Equity to sponsor race dialogues for local
high school students. The program will be a
14-week process in which high school stu
dents will go to a two-hour-long meeting
once a week to discuss race issues.
Sung ran the pilot program last spring
with a class of 15 local high school students. In
her c lass, people would discuss loaded issues
such as affirmative action. Students also
talked about race issues in public policy, the
media and higher education.
Sung said she believes there was a need for
such a program because high schools have
limited resources for discussing such topics.
"High school curriculums rarely get to
talk about race," Sung said. "High schools
don't have the time or the manpower to do
this kind of thing."
Because of the importance of race dia
logues, Sung said she felt a need to take her
program nationwide, but for now she will
run the program loc ally.
Currently, Sung is working with the ad
ministrations from local high schools to find a
way to incorporate her program into the
schools' curriculums. Sung is also looking for
other Stanford students who want to get in
volved.
Although many students often go to lead

ership conferences where race issues may be
brought up, Sung said that she founded the
program because daylong leadership or mul
ticultural conferences were not long enough
to fully cover all of the issues.
"1 felt like [short conferences] were really
ineffective because they'd take people away
fora day and then [students] would have all
these great dialogues and then they'd go back
to school and they'd have no sort of follow
up," Sung explained.
"A race dialogue has always been what I
thought would be the most effective way to
have these talks on a prolonged basis," she
added.
Sung said that her background as a mi
nority in a primarily heterogeneous commu
nity in Sacramento influenced her decision to
start the program. As one of the few Asian
students in her neighborhood, she rarely
talked about race until her AP English
teacher got her involved with a race dialogue
program.
"[At Stanford] 1 was constantly thinking
about how important race was becoming to
me in terms of becoming actively anti-racist
and actively doing things," Sung said.
During her junior year, which she spent as
a Peer Health Educator in Junipero, Sung
got a $ 1 000 grant from youth venture, an or
ganization that funds student-created diver-
sity programs, which she spent on
course readers in order to get her
program started.
Sung said that she is interested
in going into the non-profit sector
after graduation. She may file her
program for non-prolit status and
continue the work she has already
started.
The rewards of her project have
kept her actively interested in the
progress.
"One student told me she is
starting a multicultural club based
on my program. People aren't just
forgetting about [my program ] the
next morning. They still remember
it three months later."
