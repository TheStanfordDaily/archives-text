# Stanford boasts highest black student yield rate
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Harvard University lias long been per
ceived as t he standard-setter in attracting the
nation's top black students, but a new study
indicates that Stanford may be quietly out
doing its East Coast rival. Stan lord now has
the highest level of enrollment for admitted
black students among the nation's top
ranked undergraduate programs, accord
ing to a study carried out by The Journal of
Blacks in 1 ligher Education.
Students and admissions officers attribute
Stanford's success to a variety of programs
before, during and after admit weekend,
and to the strong support system fostered by
the University's black community.
The University's yield for admitted black
students in 2002 spiked to (>4.4 percent,
more than 5 percentage points higher than
last year. Harvard's 61.2-percent yield in
2002 was the second highest behind Stan
lord's, marking the first time in 20 years that
1 farvard has slipped from the top spot.
The Office of Undergraduate Admission
reported that there were 295 black admits —
12.5 percent of all students admitted — in
the ( lass 0f2006. Of those who enrolled this
fall, 190 were black, making up 1 1.(5 percent
of the class.
Dean of Admission and Financial Aid
Robin Mamlet said she believes the ranking

reflects the character of the University.
" I think the real story here is that Stanford
is a tremendous place for all students — and
that exceptional, diverse students thrive
here," Manilet said. "I'm delighted to see
that this is so evident to prospective students
and their families."
Christina Wire, associate dean of admis
sion and financial aid, concurred with Mam
let's sentiments.
" The yield for admitted African-Ameri
can students increased this year because we
effectively spread the word that Stanford not
only embraces diversity of all types, hut also
fosters a supportive and engaging environ
ment." Wire said. "The entire Stanford com
munity proactively participated in our out
reach efforts and made important connec
tions with admitted students."
Students, for the most part, agreed that
recent outreach effort s by the University and
special Admit Weekend functions attributed
to the increase of enrolled black students.
Jason Walker, a senior and previous com
munity coordinator for the Black Recruit
ment Orientation Committee, explained
that there are "programs during admit
weekend that focus on making black stu
dents feel comfortable at Stanford."
"Each year BROC organizes a call-a
thon," said Jessica Bcnford. a senior and for-
mer BROC orientation volunteer.
"[Current] students volunteer to
call the new admits. I think this
makes a big difference and more
students come to Admit Weekend
as a result."
Novella Yvette Coleman, a se
nior and president of the Black Pre-
Law Society, explained that BROC
and Admit Weekend events can be
key factors in students' decisions to
enroll.
"Students put a lot of effort and
time each year into making the
black admits feel welcome, from the
time they're accepted to the Univer
sity, during Admit Weekend and
after," she said.
Wire shared similar sentiments.
"We provide travel grants to ad
mitted students of diverse and low
income backgrounds so that they
may experience the University first
hand," she said. "Stanford under
graduates do a wonderful job of
welcoming admitted students to
campus."
Abosede George, a graduate
student in history and the presi
dent of the Stanford African Stu
dents Association, expressed sup
port for the current recruiting ef
forts on campus.
"I am repeatedly impressed by
the recruiting efforts of the Black
Community Services Center, the
Black Graduate Students Associa
tion, the Black Student Union
and other organizations founded
by, and catering mainly to, black
students on campus," George
said.
"It seems to me that there is a
great deal of emphasis placed not
only on improving the experience
of black students that are already
here, but also on reaching out to
prospective students, area high
school students of color, and so on .
.. 1 hope that the University will
continue to move proactively to
wards bringing students of diverse
backgrounds together."
Walker stated that he felt there
are other factors at play that may
have led to Stanford's higher black
enrollment levels.
"There has finally started to be a
rise in black students who are lega
cies," Walker said. "In general, I
think that the black community as
a whole in the United States has
truly begun to realize the impor
tance of attending prestigious uni

versities such as Stanford and the
effect that it can have on our home
communities."
Benford noted that Stanford has
been topping other ranking charts
that may be attracting more black
students.
"Black Enterprise Magazine has
ranked Stanford as the best college
for black students that is not a histor
ically black college," Benford said.
Harvard Director of Admissions
Marlyn McGrath Lewis pointed to
other potential sources of variability
in yield rates that may be affecting
not just Stanford, but colleges across
the nation.
"I think this is strictly a matter
of very stiff, and good, competi
tion," McGrath Lewis said. "I
think, too, the most interesting
angle is the use of so-called merit
scholarships — which we do not
use — by many colleges who are of
course trying to improve diversity,
and attract the best students to
their institutions."
Some students noted that the
issue revolves around more than
just yield levels.
"I don't really feel that the prob
lem lies in minority recruitment,"
Walker said. "[The problem lies] in
the support that is given to minority
students once they are at Stanford.
The support system plays a very
crucial role, and is the telltale factor
that displays how truly committed a
school is to diversity."
Senior Taara Hassan, the BROC
head community coordinator for
last year's Admit Weekend, contem
plated the importance of on-cam
pus advancement toward cultural
and racial understanding.
"Tolerance and having a quota is
not enough, and there is a lot of ef
fort on administration and students'
parts to make sure that those two
are not 'it'," Hassan said. "But the
fact that there is an effort and move
ment says a lot for the initiative of
our school and the people that at
tend Stanford.
"That, in turn, affects whether or
not a black student or student of
color can see themselves living and
studying comfortably at this
school," she continued.
Several students noted that Stan
ford's success in attracting black stu
dents and promoting diversity re
flects progress, but not perfection.
" I do believe I hat Stanford does a
lot more, as far as diversity is con
cerned, than numerous other
schools that I have encountered,
but I also believe that we still have a
long way to go," Walker said.
