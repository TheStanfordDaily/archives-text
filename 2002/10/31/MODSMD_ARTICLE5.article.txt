### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Harvard University lias long been per
ceived as t he standard-setter in attracting the
nation's top black students, but a new study
indicates that Stanford may be quietly out
doing its East Coast rival. Stan lord now has
the highest level of enrollment for admitted
black students among the nation's top
ranked undergraduate programs, accord
ing to a study carried out by The Journal of
Blacks in 1 ligher Education.
Students and admissions officers attribute
Stanford's success to a variety of programs
before, during and after admit weekend,
and to the strong support system fostered by
the University's black community.
The University's yield for admitted black
students in 2002 spiked to (>4.4 percent,
more than 5 percentage points higher than
last year. Harvard's 61.2-percent yield in
2002 was the second highest behind Stan
lord's, marking the first time in 20 years that
1 farvard has slipped from the top spot.
The Office of Undergraduate Admission
reported that there were 295 black admits —
12.5 percent of all students admitted — in
the ( lass 0f2006. Of those who enrolled this
fall, 190 were black, making up 1 1.(5 percent
of the class.
Dean of Admission and Financial Aid
Robin Mamlet said she believes the ranking

reflects the character of the University.
" I think the real story here is that Stanford
is a tremendous place for all students — and
that exceptional, diverse students thrive
here," Manilet said. "I'm delighted to see
that this is so evident to prospective students
and their families."
Christina Wire, associate dean of admis
sion and financial aid, concurred with Mam
let's sentiments.
" The yield for admitted African-Ameri
can students increased this year because we
effectively spread the word that Stanford not
only embraces diversity of all types, hut also
fosters a supportive and engaging environ
ment." Wire said. "The entire Stanford com
munity proactively participated in our out
reach efforts and made important connec
tions with admitted students."
Students, for the most part, agreed that
recent outreach effort s by the University and
special Admit Weekend functions attributed
to the increase of enrolled black students.
Jason Walker, a senior and previous com
munity coordinator for the Black Recruit
ment Orientation Committee, explained
that there are "programs during admit
weekend that focus on making black stu
dents feel comfortable at Stanford."
"Each year BROC organizes a call-a
