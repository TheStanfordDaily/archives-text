## 
### CYNTHIA CHO EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford Hospital workers an
nounced yesterday that they are willing
to go on a one-day strike if their de
mands fora new labor contract are not
met.
"This is a strike vote to show that we
stand together," said Lourdes Arafilef,
unit secretary at the Intensive Care Unit
and a member of the negotiating com
mittee.
Eighty-five percent of the workers
voted in support of a strike.
"Stanford Hospital and Clinics and

Lucile Packard Children's Hospital are
aware of the union action. We are con
tinuing to negotiate in earnest to bring
this process to a successful end — a fair
and equitable contract," said Maria La
Ganga, spokeswoman for Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital and Stan
ford 112 lospital and Clinics.
I he employees' current contract ex
pires on Nov. 4, and negotiations fora
new labor contract are currently under
way. Meetings between Stanford Hospi
tal workers and management are sched
uled for Nov. I and Nov. 4.
"We noticed that the management is
not moving on what is placed on the

table. The issues on the table are: voice
over staffing, job security and fair
wages," Arafilef said.
Arafilef explained the significance of
each of the issues at hand.
"Voice over staffing would allow us to
have a say on how many employees
should be on each floor," Arafilef said.
"Each caregiver should have six to eight
patients, not 12 to 15. When a person has
too many patients, [he or she] cannot
provide quality care."
"By job security, we mean that we want
to ensure that Stanford will not contract
our jobs. If they contract our jobs, it
will also hurt patient care."
"We compared the salaries of
Stanford hospital workers with
those offered by other Hospitals in
the area and discovered that ours
is at the bottom," Arafilef said.
"With such low wages, it is hard to
recruit and retain experienced
and skilled employees."
La Ganga seemed to disagree.
"We will not discuss the details
of the negotiations because we will

do nothing to endanger them.
What we can tell you is that the
hospitals have long paid competi
tive wages overall in an expensive
market, and we will continue to do
so," she said.
While Stanford I lospital work
ers and management have failed
to reach an agreement on a new
labor contract, both parties seem
to concur about what is most im
portant: patient care.
"Patient care is our highest pri
ority," La Ganga said. "That will
never change. As we evaluate all
proposals from the union, we con
tinue to ensure that our patients
receive the highest level of care."
