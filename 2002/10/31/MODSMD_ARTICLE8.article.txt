# Student groups 'trick-or-treat for cans'
## Fraternities, sororities and service organizations collect cans for hunger program 
### CYNTHIA CHO ANTHONY HA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Tonight, members of fraternities,
sororities and service organizations will
be haunting the streets of Palo Alto,
trick-or-treating not for candy but for
canned goods.

An estimated 50 Stanford students
will participate in "Trick-or-treating
for c ans," a collaboration between the
coed business fraternity Alpha Kappa
Psi, the coed service fraternity Alpha
Phi Omega, the sorority Kappa Alpha
Theta, the fraternity Sigma Alpha Kp
silon and the Stanford Circle K.
Flyers requesting canned food were
distributed to about 500 houses in Palo
Alto last Thursday, and participants
will follow up tonight by c anvassing the
area for cans.
Organizers hope to collect thou
sands of pounds of food, which will be

donated to the Ecumenical Hunger
Program of East Palo Alto.
Most ol the groups involved in the
new program have organized llal
loween-themed community service
projects in the past.
According to " hit k-oi-treating for
cans" project coordinator senior |eb
Ory, members of SAE used to run a
haunted house for children but had to
stop due to liability laws regarding
bussing young students.
Members of SAE and Theta have
also trick-or-treated around Palo
Alto for cans, and members of
Stanford Circle K and APO have
performed similar activities on
campus. AKPsi trick-or-treated
with APO two years ago.
Ory, who is also a Haas Public
Service advisory fellow, said
that the current project grew
out of an initial meeting be
tween service groups at the
Haas Center.
"This year, we all realized that
we've been doing the same thing
separately and decided to join
forces," said senior Milica Marge
ta, project director for the Stan
ford Circle K.
Sophomore Diana Lam, a
member of AKPsi's community
service committee, noted that the
fraternity had been searching for
a community service event in the
fall that would involve a lot of its
members.
"Not only [will] it build lip
group cohesiveness, but also we
[will| be helping with some
meaningful community ser
vice," Lam said. "The cans of
food that we collect will be use

ful with the onset of the winter
season.
"Once we found out that the
other groups were thinking
about collaborating on this event,
we decided to participate as well,
thinking that with more people,
we'd be able to cover more
ground and collect more cans."
According to Ory, the collabo
ration with other groups has
been very advantageous and pro
ductive.
"It does not make sense to
have two sets of groups doing the
same project," he said. "Working
with the other groups has been
wonderful because they bring
new enthusiasm and organiza
tional structure to the project. In
the past, SAE never flyered; we
expect a much better turn-out
now that we are patterning with
these other organizations."
Lam agreed, "I think that this
is a great way for groups across
campus to work with each other
and a great way for groups to
find out more about other orga
nizations on campus."
She also said that she antici
pates having a lot of fun tonight.
"That's an important part of
this, too ... to have have fun
with your peers while perform
ing service for the community."
