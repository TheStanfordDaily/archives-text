# Stanford to mark AIDS day a week early
## Scheduled events and activities to create awareness about AIDS and AIDS research 
### JENNIFER TAYLOR 
While the rest of the world will com
memorate the 15th annual World AIDS
Day on Dec. 1, the Stanford community will
do so earlier to avoid scheduling conflicts
and maximize student participation.
Since Dec. 1 falls between the Thanksgiv
ing Day holiday and final exams, the date of
the World AIDS Day observance on campus
has been tentatively scheduled for Nov. 25
and 26.
According to Haas Center Service Fellow
Kevin Medrano, the event is filled with
"news and events to highlight progress

made in the battle against the epidemic â€”
but, at the same time, it's meant to remind
people how much still needs to be done."
Despite the fact that Stanford will com
memorate World AIDS Day earlier than
others, participants and coordinators are
no less excited and hopeful about the
event's impact, and hope to reach many stu

at the Vaden Health Center and chair of the
Stanford Student / Staff World AIDS Day
Committee.
" Though they will, in and of themselves,
probably not directly help people to change
or maintain healthy behaviors, if done with
an educational component, the activities of
an awareness clay can lead to meaningful
discussion and push people who are being
unsafe to think, about their behaviors and

give a sense of dissonance between what
they are doing and what they should be
doing to keep safe," he said.
This will be the 10th year that the Stan
ford community has recognized World
AIDS Day. This year's activities will contin
ue a tradition of predominately student
run, student-planned events. In past years,
the event has included a question-and-an
swer panel of people living with AIDS, an
open-mike night at the CoHo, candlelight
vigils and guest speakers.
"1 don't expect that we, as World AIDS
Day coordinators, can single-handedly
bring about the kinds of changes that affect
ed and unaffected people around the world
could benefit from," said sophomore volun
teer Roopa Mahadevan.
"However, World AIDS Day, at its best,
