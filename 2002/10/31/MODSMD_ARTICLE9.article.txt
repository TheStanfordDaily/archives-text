# Stanford to mark AIDS day a week early
## Scheduled events and activities to create awareness about AIDS and AIDS research 
### JENNIFER TAYLOR 
While the rest of the world will com
memorate the 15th annual World AIDS
Day on Dec. 1, the Stanford community will
do so earlier to avoid scheduling conflicts
and maximize student participation.
Since Dec. 1 falls between the Thanksgiv
ing Day holiday and final exams, the date of
the World AIDS Day observance on campus
has been tentatively scheduled for Nov. 25
and 26.
According to Haas Center Service Fellow
Kevin Medrano, the event is filled with
"news and events to highlight progress

made in the battle against the epidemic —
but, at the same time, it's meant to remind
people how much still needs to be done."
Despite the fact that Stanford will com
memorate World AIDS Day earlier than
others, participants and coordinators are
no less excited and hopeful about the
event's impact, and hope to reach many stu
dents and staff with their planned activities.
"1 do believe awareness days are impor
tant," said Donnovan Yisrael, staff member
at the Vaden Health Center and chair of the
Stanford Student / Staff World AIDS Day
Committee.
" Though they will, in and of themselves,
probably not directly help people to change
or maintain healthy behaviors, if done with
an educational component, the activities of
an awareness clay can lead to meaningful
discussion and push people who are being
unsafe to think, about their behaviors and

give a sense of dissonance between what
they are doing and what they should be
doing to keep safe," he said.
This will be the 10th year that the Stan
ford community has recognized World
AIDS Day. This year's activities will contin
ue a tradition of predominately student
run, student-planned events. In past years,
the event has included a question-and-an
swer panel of people living with AIDS, an
open-mike night at the CoHo, candlelight
vigils and guest speakers.
"1 don't expect that we, as World AIDS
Day coordinators, can single-handedly
bring about the kinds of changes that affect
ed and unaffected people around the world
could benefit from," said sophomore volun
teer Roopa Mahadevan.
"However, World AIDS Day, at its best,
will try to bring more people into
this realm of interest, if not just
create some dialogue about it.
Genuine interest will be the cata
lyst for action," she said.
AIDS cases worldwide contin
ue to grow to astounding num
bers— an estimated 40 million at
the end of 2001 —and ravage
third-world populations, leaving
millions of children as orphans.
And while there is no cure for
AIDS in sight, the epidemic seems
to have lost the attention of the
media in recent years. The goal of
World AIDS Day and many other
awareness campaigns is to remind
the world that the disease has not
gone away or disappeared, and
that it still deserves attention.

Created in 1988 by the World
Summit of Ministers of Health
on Programmes for AIDS Pre
vention, the event has since re
ceived support from the United
Nations, the World Health As
sembly and various govern
ments and individuals across
the globe.
"This year, our goals are to in
clude as much of the Stanford
faculty as possible, to educate
and inform, and most impor
tantly, to encourage people to
think about AIDS consistently —
not just one or two days per
year," said junior Jerry Sim
mons.
The first organizational meet
ing took place last night in Vaden
Health Center, but anyone inter
ested in helping to plan this year's
event is encouraged to contact
