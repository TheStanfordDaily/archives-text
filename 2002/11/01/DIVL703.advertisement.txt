THE PLACE: THE TEACUP TRANCE,
3098 VICTORY BOULEVARD
AT CORBIN, WEST HILLS
I pause on the gum-blackened sidewalk to
groove fora moment and check out inv most
stylin' moves. The crappy old signboard above the door says Thus Spake
Carathrustra, Tonight at the Teacup.
This is going to be better than I ever expected. I'm in a really bad
mood, what with Quetxie and Lexus and the turquoise and the holdup on
Victory, and (larthrustra is one of my favorite prissy punk bands to bag
on. Cara is the drummer's girlfriend and he made them name the band
after her. Man, if that's not whipped, I don't know what is.
I fling the floor open and stride right in. Before my eyes can adjust to
the blacklights and my nose to the nasty smell, I'm in a head lock and down
on my knees begging for air. I tap out for mercy as I roll my head to the
side and see the leather studded Bondage Baby cuffs.
()h, it's Mandy. And oh oh oh, is she pissed.
"Where the hell do you think von were?"
She releases Sander's fragile vocal chords and lets me collapse on the
floor, coughing.
"fezus, Mandy, I had to get some turquoise for the haul drive, /.eta
was smoking at 40. Gimmee a break."
"I've just about had enough of your t t ap."
She makes a half-hearted kick towards Sander s family jewels. I block
it, but just for the spirit of the scuffle. I know bet too well. She'd never
actually stomp on my boys.
Truce, babycakes?"
I try my never-failing Bambi-eyes and sniffle a little. Always charms
the ladies. Admittedly, it has only an oh point five success rate on lesbians,
but you gotta try whatcha gotta try.
She snorts like an elephant on cocaine and stomps her Docs over to the
bar for another beer. 1 swear, that girl dresses like she thinks there's going
to be some kind of holdup at the Circle k and all those not wearing biker
leather and silver spikes from head to toe will be made to swallow a couple
gallons oft he best unleaded. Pisses me off. Site's hard to hide in a stakeout.
But she's also a great bass player and ,i tolei able magician. And we go way
back.
Carathrustra is tuning up onstage. I go into a dive-roll and come up
right next to my favorite red velvet couch, where I settle down next to a
little blonde punkette and move in for the kill. She warbles her lips up to
mine like a diminished chord going up a half-step. Makes you shiver.
Maridy'll be back from the bar in a few seconds, and then the show
begins. And then we get to test out our latest spell — alternate re-tuning
of instruments mid-set — on the hapless Carathrustra. We're pretty
irritated from last night's devastating failure in the San Gabriels— more
on that later — and are out tonight to make some Trouble with a capital
T and that rhymes with I' and that stands for I'iss ()ll! for the innocent and
unsuspecting metal-heads on stage.
Don't name your band alter Niet/sche if you can't stand up to the
libermensch, sweetheart. God may be dead, but Sander Lamori is alive
and kicking.
