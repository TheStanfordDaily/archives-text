Study on new implant device for Alzheimer's
patients yields some hope
A new implant device designed to drain brain llnids and aid in the re
duction of memory loss associated with Alzheimer's has been tested by a
research team led by Gerald Silverberg, professor of neurosurgery at
Stanford's School of Medicine.
Alzheimer's, the most common cause of dementia among elderly peo
ple, has victimized approximately four million people in the U.S.
Poor turnover rates of the brain fluids have been known to cause the
buildup of plaques in the brain that contribute to lapses in memory of
people afflicted with Alzheimer's. This "low-flow" drain, or shunt, is
being tested to drain the brain fluids and increase the turnover rate of
the fluid in the brain.
"In a healthy person, the fluid may turn over three to four times a
day," Silverberg said. "In an Alzheimer's patient, it may drop to once
a day."
The initial study involved implanting the shunt in 12 Alzheimer's pa
tients. Additional research during an 18-month study involving hun
dreds of patients is being planned.
"The likelihood we're going to shunt four million people with
Alzheimer's is very small," said Bill Thies of the Alzheimer's Association.
"We don't know whether it works really. T his is very preliminary data.
However, "The results provide more basis for optimism than 1 would
have predicted," said Dr. William Jagust, director of the Alzheimer's Dis
ease Research Center at the UC-Davis Medical Center in Sacramento.

Gelber becomes Overseas Studies Program's
new faculty associate director
Religious Studies Prof . Hester Gelber has recently accepted a position
as the new faculty associate director with the Overseas Studies Program.
Gelber will be consulting with program directors about needs or con
cerns that they have regarding their individual centers.
"She will be working to recruit Stanford faculty to teach in the pro
gram who bring expertise in needed or desired academic specialties,
as well as commitment to undergraduate education," said Amos Nur,
director of the Overseas Studies Program. "In short, she is bringing
years of the broadest imaginable undergraduate experience at Stan
ford to OSP."
Gelber, who began her career at Stanford in 1978, lectured in the Phi
losophy Department and later the Religious Studies Department. She
has even spent time teaching at Stanford's Oxford Center. Gelber has
also served as a faculty member in Stanford dorms and as chair of two
Faculty Senate committees.
"As chair of the [Committee on Undergraduate Studies] for the past
two years, [Gelber] has had the opportunity to view the academic expe
rience of our undergraduates from a broad perspective," Nur said.
Gelber's position as the new faculty associate director will be effective
immediately.
