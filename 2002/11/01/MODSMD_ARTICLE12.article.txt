## Run-DMC DJ shot to death 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — As one of
the forefathers of rap, with a his
tory ol social activism, Run-
DMC's Jam Master Jay was an
unlikely target for the kind of vi
olence that killed rappers Tupac
Shakur or the Notorious 8.1.G.
He was married with three
kids, and a fixture in the Queens
neighborhood where he grew
up. Yet authorities were search
ing yesterday for the gunman
who killed the 37-year-old disc
jockey with a gunshot to the head
inside his recording studio.
"Jam Master Jay was a long
time family man and one ol the
founders of the group that
knocked down all the doors for
hip-hop, and a dear friend of
mine," said Russell Simmons, the
hip-hop impresario whose broth
er Joe was Jay's bandmate.
"I loved him," said a devastat
ed Simmons. "I will miss him. I le
is irreplaceable."
Chuck I), front man lor rap
pers Public Enemy, agreed with

that sentiment.
"You draw the comparison to
when |olui Eennon was shot," he
said. "It's an enormous loss to the
genre."
The DJ — whose real name
was Jason Mi/ell — was the man
behind the music, working the
i urntables as Joe "Run" Simmons
and Darryl "DMC" M( Daniels
rapped over his hard rock beats
on hits like "Rock Box," "King of
Rock" and their Top 40 cover of
Aerosmith's "Walk This Way."
"lie was family to me," Mc-
Daniels said. "He stuck to the
I rue essence of what a DJ in a hip
hop performance should be. The
whole music industry has lost a
great talent."
He spun and scratched
records on twin turntables simul
taneously, creating a new style
and sound that was copied by
endless disc jockeys. "If Grand
master Flash was the first famous
I>J, J ay had to be the second,"
said Andre Harrell, a Mi/ell con

temporary who now heads Nu
America Music.
While breaking new ground,
Run-DMC made hip-hop com
mercially viable, becoming a plat
inum-selling act that earned a
1987 Grammy nomination.
In a 2001 interview with The
Associated Press, Mi/ell talked
about how some initially said rap
was a passing fad.
"I hated that, because even be
fore we were making records, I
knew it couldn't be a fad because
it was the biggest thing in the
world to me," he said.
Run-DMC created opportuni
ties for untold rappers to follow,
expanding their work into
movies and a line of clothing.
"It's a terrible loss," Adam
Horovitz of the Beast ie Boys,
who joined Run-DMC on a na
tional tour in the mid-1980s. "II
Jam Master Jay and Run-DMC
hadn't looked out for us way back
when, I don't know where we'd
be now."
