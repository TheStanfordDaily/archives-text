# Rifle used in D.C. sniper case linked to killing in Louisiana
## 
### 
(AP) — Police are checking un
solved murders around the nation
for ties to the Washington, D.C.-
area sniper attacks — a task that
took on renewed urgency yester
day as the extraordinary crime
spree's latest leg extended to
Louisiana.
Law enforcement officials said
they had linked the rifle used in
the sniper case to a Sept. 23 killing

in Baton Rouge. Authorities al
ready have laid charges in Alaba
ma and connected two shooting
cases in Washington state, all with
ballistics evidence.
In at least three other stales, po
lite have identified specific mur
der cases they believe could be
linked, but with little real evidence
so far.
The task of determining the

spree's full scope is daunting.
The two men accused in the
capital-area sniper shootings, John
Muhammad and John Lee Malvo,
have lived in or drifted through
many states and spent time in the
(Caribbean.
Beyond the Washington, D.C.,
Alabama and Louisiana cases, po
lice have linked Muhammad to
other seemingly disparate

crimes — an apparent rage killing
at a home and an attack on a syna
gogue, both in Washington state.
The capital-area sniper demand
ed $10 million — a twist that fur
ther expands the range of possible
criminal methods and motives.
"It's difficult because lie could
reasonably be a suspect in just
about anything," said Stanton
Samenow,a psychologist whoeval

nates violent criminals lor the
courts and wrote "Inside the Crim
inal Mind."
Attorney (leneral John Ashcroft
said yesterday that investigators
were also still exploring il other
people took part in the crime
spree.
Police in many states have re
opened old files to check lor ele
ments common will 1 the sniper case.
