CANBERRA, Australia (AP) —
Investigators today released re
sults of Australia's probe into the
devastating Bali bombings, saying
they were carried out by experts
who took pains to kill as many peo
ple as possible.
The degree of coordination in
cluding the vehicle placement re
ally reflected a high degree of
planning and a high degree of ex
pertise," said Graham Ashton,
the federal police officer leading
Australian detectives investigat
ing the blast.
Ashton said the aim of the at
tackers was to maximize casualties.
More than 180 people were
killed in the explosions, which set
off a fierce inferno in the popular
Sari (Hub, reducing it to a tangle of
girders and chart ed wood. Many
of the young revelers who per
ished were so badly burned they
have not yet been identified.
"Those people who lost their
lives at the Sari Club did so very,
very quickly, such was the size of
the blast," Ashton said.
Blasts outside the neighboring
Paddy's Bar and near the U.S.
Consulate in Denpasar were
caused by bombs made from TNT
and likely set off by remote con
trol, Ashton said.
Both Australia and Indonesia
have named al-Qaida and Jemaah
Islamiyah as the main suspects in
the attack.
Australian investigators believe
the blast that devastated the Sari
Club in the Balinese town of Kuta
was caused by the explosive chlo
rate and that it was set off by a
"booster charge" such as TNT.
