## The
						Stanford Daily Band review process must be clear from the outset 
### 
Published Since IX9I

The Athletics Department's decision
not to approve a part of the Stanford
Band's halftime show for last week's
UCLA game prompted an outcry
from Band members â€” and with good reason.
The controversial lines of the Band's script point
ed to the perils of drunk driving and included
the statements: "But more seriously, both Stan
ford and UCLA students, faculty and staff agree
that there is nothing more irresponsible than
recklessly endangering the lives of others," and,
"Because even if it doesn't end your collegiate
athletic career, drinking and driving could end
someone's life." The Band did not mention that
UCLA quarterback Cory Paus was convicted of
drunk-driving charges and, until he was injured
two weeks ago, continued to play football.
We understand that the Athletics Department
needs to approve the material but question the
review process and see an overwhelming need

for the Band and the department to follow con
sistent guidelines for the content of the shows.
For many years, the Band's halftime show has
been reviewed by one or more members of the
Athletics Department. The review process entails
an exchange between the two groups until they
reach a satisfactory compromise. Such review is
necessary because the Band does not represent
only its members, but the Athletics Department
and the University as a whole. Despite all of these
restrictions and responsibilities, the Band has de
veloped its own reputation as a quirky and crazy
group that might sometimes make us feel un
comfortable, but always makes us laugh. The
Band plays a necessary and important role at
Stanford, and we want it to continue entertaining
fans just as it does now, for decades to come.
When the Band cried that it had been cen
sored, it was also being a little dramatic: The ob
jection was to one segment of the show, not the

entire piece. That said, many fans have seen the
Hand perform shows that are equally, if not more
offensive. Why were those shows OK?
For the past two years, Assoc. Athletic Director
Darrin Nelson has seized as the main content re
viewer and liaison with the Band. He said that the
scripts circulate to several people who suggest
changes when the content violates "common decen
cy" or "sportsmanship" or offends "social groups."
He added that it's "impossible" to state what would
be acceptable in eveiy situation. Granted. But the
varying levels of acceptability speak to a larger issue:
Why doesn't the Athletics Department have consis
tent guidelines? By failing to state how the Band's
material is regulated, the Athletics Department is less
credible to students and to the Band.
Understandably, Band members want to re
tain as much autonomy in their shows as possible.
But when they spend hours creating a script only
to have to rewrite it again, even loose guidelines

seem like a good solution.
Guidelines might also eliminate discrepancies
in why the material is perceived offensive. Ac
cording to Band members, they were told that
Pans' drunk-driving charges were old news and
unnecessary in a show. When The Daily asked
Nelson his reasons for rejecting the segment, he
cited several. He refuted the Band's claim that
the script seriously addressed drunk driving, and
he said that because the Band will be on alcohol
probation until the end of the school year, it is
ridiculous for its members to lecture other
schools about alcohol use.
In public sporting events, we understand the
necessity for good taste and maintaining the Uni
versity's elite reputation, but we also believe in
free expression and speech. For the relationship
between the Band and the Athletics Department
to work, clear expectations from both parties
must be outlined and met.
