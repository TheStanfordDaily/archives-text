# THE 						WAY I SEE IT
## Why do we work so hard? 
### 
My brain has turned off. I've
been so busy with midterms
and papers, going to my job
and trying to tliink about what
on earth to say in this column that I really
just don't feel like there's much left in me.
There hasn't been a night this week that 1
have slept for longer than three hours,
and quite frankly, the tiredness and busy
ness and stressed-out-ness is starting to
get on my nerves.
And I know I'm not alone. This school
is nobody's joke. Just when you think
you're loving the fact that you're back on
campus, seeing your friends and liking the
classes you're taking, it hits you. There is
work to do — lot of it.
Professors have no problem assigning
you two books to read, a class presentation
to lead and a 15-page paper to write, with

a map quiz thrown in, all
in one week. All for one
class. To the faculty: Do
you know that we take
more than your class? I
feel like you don't. If you
did know, would you re
ally say things like, "Write
a 10-page paper unpack
ing one of the major
themes from the course

and linking it to evidence from the text.
You must discuss your paper topic, struc
ture and font style with me twice before
you turn it in, or your grade will be re
duced. Paper due in one week."
And don't get me started on problem
sets. Those poor engineers, taking all that
math. Spending so long in their middle-of
the-night study groups wondering what on
earth to do with that third derivative. And
the CS people over in that scary, scary lair.
So I keep asking myself why it is that 1 re
ally do this. Why am I over here running
around for the l)est part of the day like a
mad hen when really there are other places
I could be? Like the beach. I'm fantasizing
about lying on the white sand sipping wine
coolers for hours, just enjoying the vibe. But
instead, I find myself on the Farm, which is
definitely gorgeous, don't get me wrong, ex
cept how am I supposed to realize that,
when I don't even really have time to stop
and look at my surroundings as I try to read
yet another book while walking to class? (()i
at least try to imagine what I would he say
ing or thinking if I had I read it.)
What is the benefit? Let's face it: For
many of us, Stanford is a ticket to success.
Weapply with hopeful hearts and then get
very excited when we get in because ac
ceptance into Stanford means, to a certain
extent, that you have made it, at least this
far. Now, all kinds of honorably altruistic
intentions about helping humanity
notwithstanding, I can definitely say that I
am at this school because I want to he rich
/ powerful / influential in later life, and I
feel like Stanford is a nice stepping stone
on my way there.
This is the thought that keeps me en
rolled when it seems like it's really too

much. This is the thought that makes me
happy at ihe end of the summer, when 1
comeback from the real world and realize
how good we have it here, how tight ev
erybody is, and how I'm another year ( los
er to getting that degree that brings me
another step closer to being able to sustain
the lifestyle that I want.
So imagine my dismay at a recent reve
lation. I work at The Stanford Fund, a
program to raise money for undergradu
ate education through alumni donations.
My job is to call alumni on the phone, chat
with them about Stanford and encourage
them to support the University by giving
money. Many of them do give, especially
in the fall, when the year is fresh and new.
The calling pools are plentiful, ripe with
alumni who are nostalgic about their Farm
years and excited to talk to us callers about
their glory days back in college.
I fowever, there are those who do not do
nate, too. And a lot of the time, it's not be
cause they don't want to — it's because they
can't. 1 hey love the school, they love getting
the calls and everything—they just don't
have the money. They're jobless. They're
broke. They just can't do it. They are Stan
ford grads, and they once went through ex
actly what we're going through now.
Isn't that the worst? What if four years of
sleep deprivation don't really get me very
far after all? Now I'm trying to rationalize it
like, well, it's really not true that everyone at
Stanford has my schedule. Obviously, I'm
the type of person who just likes to — or
feels like she has to — do a lot, and maybe
that will carry through for the rest of my
life,and I'll just find myself immersed in ev
erything I try to do, trying to make as big a
success of it as possible. So maybe it's the
people who did less at school who end up
doing less in life. Then again, maybe it's
not. I mean, how can we really say? I don't
know. But if even after all this the end goal
is still not guaranteed, then what is there to
do? I don't know. I couldn't tell you now
anyway — the clock is ticking away steadily
on the time I have to finish yet another
midterm paper, so I have to go.

years and excited to talk to us callers about
their glory days back in college.
I fowever, there are those who do not do
nate, too. And a lot of the time, it's not be
cause they don't want to — it's because they
can't. 1 hey love the school, they love getting
the calls and everything—they just don't
have the money. They're jobless. They're
broke. They just can't do it. They are Stan
ford grads, and they once went through ex
actly what we're going through now.
Isn't that the worst? What if four years of
sleep deprivation don't really get me very
far after all? Now I'm trying to rationalize it
like, well, it's really not true that everyone at
Stanford has my schedule. Obviously, I'm
the type of person who just likes to — or
feels like she has to — do a lot, and maybe
that will carry through for the rest of my
life,and I'll just find myself immersed in ev
erything I try to do, trying to make as big a
success of it as possible. So maybe it's the
people who did less at school who end up
doing less in life. Then again, maybe it's
not. I mean, how can we really say? I don't
know. But if even after all this the end goal
is still not guaranteed, then what is there to
do? I don't know. I couldn't tell you now
anyway — the clock is ticking away steadily
on the time I have to finish yet another
midterm paper, so I have to go.

My brain has turned off. I've
been so busy with midterms
and papers, going to my job
and trying to tliink about what
on earth to say in this column that I really
just don't feel like there's much left in me.
There hasn't been a night this week that 1
have slept for longer than three hours,
and quite frankly, the tiredness and busy
ness and stressed-out-ness is starting to
get on my nerves.
And I know I'm not alone. This school
is nobody's joke. Just when you think
you're loving the fact that you're back on
campus, seeing your friends and liking the
classes you're taking, it hits you. There is
work to do — lot of it.
Professors have no problem assigning
you two books to read, a class presentation
to lead and a 15-page paper to write, with

a map quiz thrown in, all
in one week. All for one
class. To the faculty: Do
you know that we take
more than your class? I
feel like you don't. If you
did know, would you re
ally say things like, "Write
a 10-page paper unpack
ing one of the major
themes from the course

and linking it to evidence from the text.
You must discuss your paper topic, struc
ture and font style with me twice before
you turn it in, or your grade will be re
duced. Paper due in one week."
And don't get me started on problem
sets. Those poor engineers, taking all that
math. Spending so long in their middle-of
the-night study groups wondering what on
earth to do with that third derivative. And
the CS people over in that scary, scary lair.
So I keep asking myself why it is that 1 re
ally do this. Why am I over here running
around for the l)est part of the day like a
mad hen when really there are other places
I could be? Like the beach. I'm fantasizing
about lying on the white sand sipping wine
coolers for hours, just enjoying the vibe. But
instead, I find myself on the Farm, which is
definitely gorgeous, don't get me wrong, ex
cept how am I supposed to realize that,
when I don't even really have time to stop
and look at my surroundings as I try to read
yet another book while walking to class? (()i
at least try to imagine what I would he say
ing or thinking if I had I read it.)
What is the benefit? Let's face it: For
many of us, Stanford is a ticket to success.
Weapply with hopeful hearts and then get
very excited when we get in because ac
ceptance into Stanford means, to a certain
extent, that you have made it, at least this
far. Now, all kinds of honorably altruistic
intentions about helping humanity
notwithstanding, I can definitely say that I
am at this school because I want to he rich
/ powerful / influential in later life, and I
feel like Stanford is a nice stepping stone
on my way there.
This is the thought that keeps me en
rolled when it seems like it's really too

much. This is the thought that makes me
happy at ihe end of the summer, when 1
comeback from the real world and realize
how good we have it here, how tight ev
erybody is, and how I'm another year ( los
er to getting that degree that brings me
another step closer to being able to sustain
the lifestyle that I want.
So imagine my dismay at a recent reve
lation. I work at The Stanford Fund, a
program to raise money for undergradu
ate education through alumni donations.
My job is to call alumni on the phone, chat
with them about Stanford and encourage
them to support the University by giving
money. Many of them do give, especially
in the fall, when the year is fresh and new.
The calling pools are plentiful, ripe with
alumni who are nostalgic about their Farm
years and excited to talk to us callers about
their glory days back in college.
I fowever, there are those who do not do
