Students should watch
lesser-known films, too
On Sunday I went to watch two films on
campus. At 10 p.m. I saw the Flicks show
ing of "Signs." Memorial Auditorium was
packed with students eager to a see a not
terribly original movie that made the
rounds in multiplexes months ago.
Earlier that day I had seen "Gaza
Strip," a brutally intense look at life for
Palestinians under occupation, as part of
the United Nations Association Film Festi
val. While attendance at C '.übberley Audi
torium was respectable, 1 could probably
count on my two hands the number of un
dergraduates in the audience.
1 recognize the need for students to
unwind from studying with entertaining
films, and the festival could have been
better publicized, but it is still a little dis
appointing that more students do not
take advantage of an opportunity to sec
some of the most powerful and rarely
shown films being made in the world —
for free, no less.
I know that the student body here cares
about issues more substantive than Mel
Gibson's battles with stereotypic ally
shaped aliens, but it would be encourag
ing to see it take a more active role in ex
ploring these issues beyond t he classroom.

'Islamic studies program
is indeed timely'
Craig Albrecht misses the simple point
of creating an Islamic studies program on
campus: that Islam is one of the fastest

growing religions in the world and a grow
ing force in the United States ("Academics
or politics?" Oct. 31).
Europe failed to come to grips with its
rising level of Muslim immigrants. The re
sult is embarrassing election victories for
far-right thorns such as France's jean-
Marie Le Pen and Austria's Joerg Haider.
Studying the foundations and future of
Islam will be critical to understanding our
selves and the United States of the 21st
century. The creation of an Islamic stud
ies program is indeed timely.

Palestinian culpability should
be considered
Mitchell Smith (" 'Free speech' is not
debatable," Letters, Oct. '51) laments that
it is not socially acceptable to criticize Israel
these days. Israel certainly does get her
share of criticism. That is not anti-Semitic.
What is anti-Semitic is the exclusive
criticism that Israel gets without ever con
sidering the culpability of Arafat, the
Palestinian Authority, the terrorist organi
zations living among the Palestinian civil
ian population and the culture of hatred
being taught in the Arab world in the
schools, from the pulpit and from the
state-run media.
Nor is any responsibility ever placed on
the Arab countries such as Iraq, Saudi Ara
bia and Syria that are responsible for the
strife in the Middle East in the first place
and are ideological and financial sponsors
of terrorist organizations around the
world. As lor Mitchell's take on Barak's
story about killing Palestinians — they

happened to be the murderers responsi
ble for the massacre of the Israeli Olympic
team in Munich. Barak did mention that.

SCN could do better
In regards to the [editorial] entitled,
"SCN's hip-hop shows add diversity to
campus scene," (Oct. 28) I would like to
argue t hat better steps can be taken to book
bigger and more popular hip-hop, rap and
R&rß artists on campus, as well as bigger
artists in general. I don't know much about
the logistical constraints under which the
Stanford Concert Network operates. Obvi
ously, SCN is not sitting on a pot of gold
and does not have an easy time getting
artists to come to Stanford, so we must give
them credit for trying. But we should ask
ourselves whether we expect more from
tht' organization in charge of bringing vis
iting artists to Stanford.
Although bringing in smaller hip-hop
artists and rap artists such as Common
and Blackalicious has presented financial
challenges to SCN, I am sure bigger rap,
hip-hop and R&B artists would be re
ceived with excitement and high demand,
and would definitely sell out. Granted that
big artists are costly and probably do not
sec Mem And as an opportune location on
their tour schedule, we must recognize
that many other universities host big
name artists on campus at small venues all
the time.
Obviously, bigger universities such as
North Carolina State or UCI A can bring
