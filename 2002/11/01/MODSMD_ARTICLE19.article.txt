Students should watch
lesser-known films, too
On Sunday I went to watch two films on
campus. At 10 p.m. I saw the Flicks show
ing of "Signs." Memorial Auditorium was
packed with students eager to a see a not
terribly original movie that made the
rounds in multiplexes months ago.
Earlier that day I had seen "Gaza
Strip," a brutally intense look at life for
Palestinians under occupation, as part of
the United Nations Association Film Festi
val. While attendance at C '.übberley Audi
torium was respectable, 1 could probably
count on my two hands the number of un
dergraduates in the audience.
1 recognize the need for students to
unwind from studying with entertaining
films, and the festival could have been
better publicized, but it is still a little dis
appointing that more students do not
take advantage of an opportunity to sec
some of the most powerful and rarely
shown films being made in the world —
for free, no less.
I know that the student body here cares
about issues more substantive than Mel
Gibson's battles with stereotypic ally
shaped aliens, but it would be encourag
ing to see it take a more active role in ex
ploring these issues beyond t he classroom.

'Islamic studies program
is indeed timely'
Craig Albrecht misses the simple point
of creating an Islamic studies program on
campus: that Islam is one of the fastest

growing religions in the world and a grow
ing force in the United States ("Academics
or politics?" Oct. 31).
Europe failed to come to grips with its
rising level of Muslim immigrants. The re
sult is embarrassing election victories for
far-right thorns such as France's jean-
Marie Le Pen and Austria's Joerg Haider.
Studying the foundations and future of
Islam will be critical to understanding our
selves and the United States of the 21st
century. The creation of an Islamic stud
ies program is indeed timely.

Palestinian culpability should
be considered
Mitchell Smith (" 'Free speech' is not
debatable," Letters, Oct. '51) laments that
it is not socially acceptable to criticize Israel
these days. Israel certainly does get her
share of criticism. That is not anti-Semitic.
What is anti-Semitic is the exclusive
criticism that Israel gets without ever con
sidering the culpability of Arafat, the
Palestinian Authority, the terrorist organi
zations living among the Palestinian civil
ian population and the culture of hatred
being taught in the Arab world in the
schools, from the pulpit and from the
state-run media.
Nor is any responsibility ever placed on
the Arab countries such as Iraq, Saudi Ara
bia and Syria that are responsible for the
strife in the Middle East in the first place
and are ideological and financial sponsors
of terrorist organizations around the
world. As lor Mitchell's take on Barak's
story about killing Palestinians — they

happened to be the murderers responsi
ble for the massacre of the Israeli Olympic
team in Munich. Barak did mention that.

SCN could do better
In regards to the [editorial] entitled,
"SCN's hip-hop shows add diversity to
campus scene," (Oct. 28) I would like to
argue t hat better steps can be taken to book
bigger and more popular hip-hop, rap and
R&rß artists on campus, as well as bigger
artists in general. I don't know much about
the logistical constraints under which the
Stanford Concert Network operates. Obvi
ously, SCN is not sitting on a pot of gold
and does not have an easy time getting
artists to come to Stanford, so we must give
them credit for trying. But we should ask
ourselves whether we expect more from
tht' organization in charge of bringing vis
iting artists to Stanford.
Although bringing in smaller hip-hop
artists and rap artists such as Common
and Blackalicious has presented financial
challenges to SCN, I am sure bigger rap,
hip-hop and R&B artists would be re
ceived with excitement and high demand,
and would definitely sell out. Granted that
big artists are costly and probably do not
sec Mem And as an opportune location on
their tour schedule, we must recognize
that many other universities host big
name artists on campus at small venues all
the time.
Obviously, bigger universities such as
North Carolina State or UCI A can bring
in huge artists such as Jay-Z because of big
ger budgets and student bodies. But even
a medium-sized school like Stanford
should be able to host at least two or three
big artists a year on campus.
For example, Dartmouth College in
New 1 lampshire has hosted such artists as
Jurassic 5, Ben Harper, Dave Matthews
Band, Dar Williams, Busta Rhymes,
Wyclef Jean, The Roots, Dispatch, Jack
Johnson, the Indigo Cirls, Strangefolk,
Run DMC, Ziggy Marley, Blues Traveler,
The Temptations, George Clinton and the
P-Funk All Stars, The Steve Miller Band,
Rusted Root and soon. That list is long, it's
diverse, and it's just a straight-up phat list.
Now let's compare that to our list: Vertical
Horizon, Nine Days, Digital Under
ground, John Hooker, Dispatch and
Jack Johnson. And, oh, I almost forgot:
Big Bad Voodoo Daddy. Don't get me
wrong. 1 am a huge fan of some of the
artists on Stanford's list, but let's be realis
tic here — Dartmouth's list makes our list
suck, especially if you like hip hop.
I just think Stanford can do bigger and
better things. SCN says in the FAQ section
of its Web site that "SCN sends out invita
tions to over (50 bands a year. It's quite pos
sible we tried to get your band, but it didn't
work out for whatever reason." 1 don't
know about you, but I am convinced SCN
is doing something wrong here.
Hey, I don't know what to do. Maybe

S( IN should send more than 00 invitations
out. Maybe we should ask the very gener
ous Arrillaga family to pay the artists.
Whatever it is, I am sure something has to
change, because any Stanford student
would love [to attend a show by] those
aforementioned artists.
I have to give SCN credit for the up
coming Nappy Roots show at Mem And,
which 1 am sure will make Big Came
weekend fun after we beat Cal. But until
SCN can get its stuff together and stop
booking the Big Bad VooDoo Daddies of
the world, Busta Rhymes just ain't com
ing, people.

In defense of just war
Without going into the various argu
ments for and against war in Iraq, 1 want
to address Suchitra Sebastian's letter
("'War is not justified for the developed
Western world,"' Oct. 29). Sebastian's bla
tant disregard for history astonishes and
offends me. Sebastian wrote, "War is not
justified for the developed Western world
or for any other country, for that matter. It
is the ultimate violation of human rights
and erodes the very freedom it claims to
fight for." This is, in essence, to assert that
the United States had no business fighting
against I litler's atrocities in World War 11
or engaging in the Civil War on behalf of
eliminating slavery. I'm certainly not as
serting that these were the only motiva

tions lor participation in those conflicts,
but they did contribute a great deal to the
decisions made to engage in them.
I am not suggesting every war is de
fendable, but rather that there are indeed
some causes worth fighting for. I agree
that "it is our collective responsibility to be
passionately committed to, and to speak
out for the 112 undamental rights of all peo
ple everywhere," and it is for this very rea
son that 1 believe that reserving the right
to use force to protect those rights when
there is no other means available is a de
fensible foreign policy for any nation with
said values.
Whether or not that is the case with
Iraq is debatable, and whether or not war
is the right choice in the current situation
is also debatable fora number ofother rea
sons, but it is certainly the case that human
rights are threatened by the current
regime and its demonstrated willingness
to use chemical weapons on its own people
and its enemies.
My point, however, is that it is wrong to
so casually dismiss the theories on just war,
for what good are words in defense of
human rights if one is willing to stand by
and make beautiful statements while
watching thousands of people lose their
lives at the hands of those who have no
qualms about human rights? Ask the Eu
ropeans if they're glad the U.S. intervened
in World War 11, and ask the people of
Sarajevo if they're glad the bombing
stopped, before you deny just war.
