Individuals around the globe
now have the opportunity to bene
fit from the extensive ac ademic re
sources of the world's most highly
regarded universities — all from
the comfort of their own home.
"Conversations on Iraq" is an
online forum presented by the Al
liance for Lifelong Learning,
which is an allied educational in
ternet venture designed by Stan
ford, Oxford and Yale.
Over 5,000 people have regis
tered for the course and are cur
rently participating in online dis
cussions about Iraq. Three Stan

ford faculty members agreed to
contribute to the forum, in addi
tion to one from Oxford and two
from Yale. The forum's modera
tor, Anthony Spires, is a graduate
student in sociology at Yale.
The online forum is a four-day
experience that began on Oct. 29.
The forum is scheduled to run
until this evening.
Charles Hill, a distinguished
fellow in international security
studies at Yale and a research fel
low at Stanford's Hoover Institu
tion, explained his personal goals
for the course.
"I hope that [the forum] will an
swer a lot of questions that people
have around the world," 1 lill said.
"Already, 1 have gone through the
answering process today — there
were questions coming in that
were selected by the organizers of
the course. They were very good
and serious questions. I am very

pleased with it."
lhe professors participating
were asked by their respective uni
versities to take part in the forum.
" I was asked by Yale to be one of
the two people who would partici
pate in this," 1 lill said. "They asked
me, and 1 am happy to do it."
In the forum's first three days,
each of the professors presented
a 15 to 30 minute streaming
video lecture that expressed an
outlook or perspective on the
various current issues surround
ing Iraq. After the video lectures,
participants engaged in online
discussions with fellow course en
rollees and e-mailed professors
with questions.
Ahmad Dallal, an associate pro
fessor of history, explained what
sort of material the different lec
tures in the forum contain.

"There are speakers who are
arguing in support of the war,"
Dallal said. "There are also differ
ent perspectives on it by those
who are opposed to war. We are
approaching it from different
perspectives — some are concen
trating on foreign policy while
others are focusing on the reper
cussions in the Middle hast and
others looking at the implications
for civil liberties or about what
the) think are the dangers of Sad
clam I lussein."
According to Joel Beinin, a pro
fessor of Middle l.ast history, the
forum offers a different perspec
tive on the Iraq debate.
"| It | is designed to expose
people to a broader range of
views than have been provided so
far by the mass media and the
government on the issues related
to a potential war on Iraq,"
Beinin said. "It has been phe
nomenally successful."
Hill concurred with Beinin's
sentiments.
"There is nothing like it," Hill
said. "There is no debate on a
question of this magnitude that in
vokes these three great universi
ties that comes exactly at the time
when people around the world
want to know about it — this has
the ability to reach all around the
world."
Beinin said that he has partici

paled in similar online-style fo
rums before.
"1 designed a Web-based
course on Palestine, Zionism and
die Arab-Israeli Conflict for All
Learn," Beinin said. "So they
knew me and asked me to partici
pate in the Iraq forum."
I fill explained that his past aca
demic experience probably led to
his selection for the course.
"1 have been working on this
matter — with a focus on the Mid
dle East — for years," 11 ill said.
Beinin said that he feels
there is a future for more online
educational forums such as the
Iraq effort.
" I his is an ideal way for people
who are computer literate but
can't get to a face-to-face class on a
regular basis to learn," Beinin
said. "It allows lots of people
spread all over the world to have
access to individuals with expertise
and written materials that would
not otherwise be available."
However, Beinin expressed
that such online forums are by no
means comparable to actually at
tending classes.
"I'm not yet convinced that
taking a course online is a superi
or learning experience than hav
ing a face-to-face interaction with
a well-qualified teacher," Beinin
said. "It's certainly not a superior
teaching experience. I prefer to
see who I am talking to and get
immediate feedback on what I am
trying to convey. But if people
aren't able to do that, this is a vi
able substitute."
