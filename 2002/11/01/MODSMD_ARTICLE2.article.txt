Individuals around the globe
now have the opportunity to bene
fit from the extensive ac ademic re
sources of the world's most highly
regarded universities — all from
the comfort of their own home.
"Conversations on Iraq" is an
online forum presented by the Al
liance for Lifelong Learning,
which is an allied educational in
ternet venture designed by Stan
ford, Oxford and Yale.
Over 5,000 people have regis
tered for the course and are cur
rently participating in online dis
cussions about Iraq. Three Stan

ford faculty members agreed to
contribute to the forum, in addi
tion to one from Oxford and two
from Yale. The forum's modera
tor, Anthony Spires, is a graduate
student in sociology at Yale.
The online forum is a four-day
experience that began on Oct. 29.
The forum is scheduled to run
until this evening.
Charles Hill, a distinguished
fellow in international security
studies at Yale and a research fel
low at Stanford's Hoover Institu
tion, explained his personal goals
for the course.
"I hope that [the forum] will an
swer a lot of questions that people
have around the world," 1 lill said.
"Already, 1 have gone through the
answering process today — there
were questions coming in that
were selected by the organizers of
the course. They were very good
and serious questions. I am very

pleased with it."
lhe professors participating
were asked by their respective uni
versities to take part in the forum.
" I was asked by Yale to be one of
the two people who would partici
pate in this," 1 lill said. "They asked
me, and 1 am happy to do it."
In the forum's first three days,
each of the professors presented
a 15 to 30 minute streaming
video lecture that expressed an
outlook or perspective on the
various current issues surround
ing Iraq. After the video lectures,
participants engaged in online
discussions with fellow course en
rollees and e-mailed professors
with questions.
Ahmad Dallal, an associate pro
fessor of history, explained what
sort of material the different lec
tures in the forum contain.
