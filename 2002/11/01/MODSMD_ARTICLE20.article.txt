# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Female athlete urges fellow students to pump iron, not hot air 
### DEBBIE PARK GUEST COLUMNIST 
After digging around the Department of
Athletics, Physical Education and Recreation
last week for information regarding the
newly "renovated" Arrillaga weight room
and to investigate why some of my beloved
free weights had been removed, 1 left feeling
jaded by the lack of'heartening news.
Hoping to find out that lighter free
weights, namely the 12.5-, 17.5-and 22.5-
pound weights, were on their way to join
the shiny new collection, 1 was appalled to
discover that the decision to eliminate
these weights and to skimp on the rest of
the lower weights was a conscious decision

that was made in the best interest of the
"general population."
As a female who lifts on a regular recre
ational basis, 1 felt as if I had been elimi
nated from the picture and that the deci
sion-makers thought that it was just fine to
do so. 1 was directed to make use of the oh
so-many free weights at I residder, or
what a Daily columnist deemed "Ya-Ya
I.and" in an column a few weeks ago.
After reading the ignorant and misogy
nist point-of-view of a certain individual
who blatantly expressed his opinion that
women carrying boxes of Tampax while
reading and socializing at the gym were
not seriously "health conscious students,"
1 felt it as my duty to do more in this col

uinn than just blow hot air. Students can
gripe and complain all they want about the
athletic facilities here at Stanford â€” but
what are words if nothing comes of them?
So I talked to several students, many of
whom have a lot to say about different as
pects of their fitness activities and the ath
letic facilities on campus. Laurel Stewart,
an avid runner, felt that it was absurd to
say that I residder is adequate for females
but inadequate for more "macho" males.
"The Fishbowl is so cramped that it gets
depressing," she said. "I like to run outside
most of the time, but even if I wanted to run
indoors, there aren't enough treadmills.
There aren't enough free weights, either."
Senior Rat by Chen also felt that the fa

cilities at Stanford were lacking.
"1 understand that we're at Stanford,
and granted, the weather is really nice, but
there is still a need for more cardio equip
ment," she told me.
l he need fora greater range of free
weights runs across gender lines, though.
GregTsien, a sophomore club soccer play
er who lilts regularly, wishes that Arrillaga
had lighter weights so that he would have
the option of increasing the intensity of his
workout in smaller increments.
Hut finally, someone might be doing
something about it. Joey Natoli, the direc
tor of the ASSU Undergraduate Student
Life Committee, is working with the com
mittee to draw up a proposal fora new

student union that may have a new exer
cise facility incorporated into the struc
ture. Also, it doesn't hurt to barrage the
Athletic Department with friendly e-mails,
phone calls and visits. They are quite co
operative and open to student feedback
on programming or requests for specific
pieces of equipment. Being proactive is
key. The University makes decisions based
on the representative student population
and individual voices can make a differ
ence. So don't just be a hot-head. If you
want to pump iron, do something about it.
