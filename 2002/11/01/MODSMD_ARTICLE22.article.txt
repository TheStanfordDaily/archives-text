# Wonderfest seeks to honor scientists
## 
### ALI ALEMOZAFAR STAFF WRITER 
Ever wondered if matter is still a
mystery, how human intelligence
evolved, or if men and women
think differently? These are
among the many topics that the
fourth Wonderfest will explore
this weekend, Nov. 2-3, in room
200 of Sum ford's Teaching Center
in the Science and Engineering
Quad. The festival returns to Stan
find to engage attendees in what
can be characterized as an intellec
tual quest.
Wonderfest is a non-profit edu
cational project created and direct
ed by Tucker Hiatt, a physics
teacher at Branson High School in
Marin County. The festival seeks to
honor late Cornell astronomer
Carl Sagan's belief that "popular
ization of science is successful if, at
first, it does no more than spark the
sense of wonder."
"Scientists have a certain obliga
tion to making their discoveries
known to the public," I liatt said.
The festival will consist of topics
discussed in 90-minute dialogues
hosted by prominent scientists
from Stanford, UC-Santa Cruz,
UC-Berkeley and other institu
tions. Ranging from physics to psy
chology, this year's topics were
specifically selected to address
questions for which there are no
clear answers. The event's format is
designed to be both entertaining
and educational.
"Topics are made to be genuine
and sexy," Hiatt said.
He further added that Won
derfest is distinct from a lecture
series in that each dialogue will
consist of a pair of speakers who
can argue with each other and
the audience.
"One-third of each 90-minute
dialogue will consist of a question
and-answer session," Hiatt said.
Stanford Natural Science Prof.
Richard Zare, one of the event's or

ganizers, gave his input on the
"wonder" behind Wonderfest.
"Who of us hasn't had won
der about the world we live in?"
Zare said. "[Wonderfest| is not
just for the scientist ... it's
meant for everyone."
He elaborated that "science is
not an authority voice, it's a process
of inquiry."
Wonderfest will kick off on
Saturday with a dialogue be
tween Chemistry Prof. John
Brauman and Physics Prof, and
Nobel Laureate Martin Perl on
the topic "Is Matter still a Mys
tery." The two speakers were
specifically chosen to give view
points from different perspec
tives on the question, Zare said.
Saturday's second talk will in
volve William Coleman from the
Electric Power Research Institute
and Stanford Biology Prof.
Crete lien Daily discussing "Can
Conservation Be Profitable?"
Wonderfest\s Carl Sagan Prize
for Science Popularization will
subsequently be awarded to An
drew Fraknoi, chair of the astron
omy department at Foothill Col
lege and educational consultant
for the Astronomical Society of the
Pacific. In honor of his work in
sharing modern astronomy with
the public , Asteroid 4859 has been
named Asteroid Fraknoi by t he As
tronomical Union.
The day's final dialogue will fea
ture Stanford Physics Profs. Savas
Dimopolous and Andrei Linde
conversing on "Where Did the
Universe Come From?"
" The speakers have a handle on
this topic as good as anybody on
this planet," I liatt said.
The Sunday morning portion
of the event will involve UC-Santa
Cruz Anthropology Prof. Diane
Cifford-Gonzalez and Stanford
Anthropology Prof. Richard
Klein, addressing the question
"Do We Know I low 1 luman Intel
ligence Evolved?"

"When docs someone be
come human?" Hiatt said.
"Something really remarkable
happened about 50,000 years
ago . . . but what?"
"The two speakers believe
that they're close to an answer,"
he added.
Computer Science Prof. John
McCarthy, one of the fathers of
artificial intelligence, and Ken
neth Taylor, chair of I he Philoso
phy Department, will then discuss
the future of computing when
they address the question "Are
There Natural Limits to the
Power of Computers?"
l'lie speakers will discuss hard
ware and software issues regarding
the production of faster comput
ers, Hiatt said. As device dimen
sions approach the fundamental
limit, several complicating factors
come into play that innovations in
software may resolve.
"This is where A.I. comes in,"he
added. "Could computers end up

being smarter than we are?"
Ihe dialogue portion of the fes
tival will come to a close with UC-
Santa Cruz Psychology Prof.
Campbell Lea per and UC-Berke
ley Research Psychologist Melissa
Adams discussing "Do Men and
Women Think Differently?"
"Everybody knows the answer,"
Hiatt said jokingly. "The question
is how do they differ [and] how
much of that [difference] is cultural
and biological?"
Aside from the six dialogue ses
sions, this year's Wonderfest will
feature two art exhibitions to
showcase the work of Felice
Frankel, a science photographer
and research associate at MIT, and
Nancy Anderson, a former Stan
ford graduate student whose re
search focuses on transgenic light
and the use of green fluorescent
protein in research.
Wonderfest is sponsored by the
Department of Chemistry at Stan
lord and Branson High School.

fourth Wonderfest will explore
this weekend, Nov. 2-3, in room
200 of Sum ford's Teaching Center
in the Science and Engineering
Quad. The festival returns to Stan
find to engage attendees in what
can be characterized as an intellec
tual quest.
Wonderfest is a non-profit edu
cational project created and direct
ed by Tucker Hiatt, a physics
teacher at Branson High School in
Marin County. The festival seeks to
honor late Cornell astronomer
Carl Sagan's belief that "popular
ization of science is successful if, at
first, it does no more than spark the
sense of wonder."
"Scientists have a certain obliga
tion to making their discoveries
known to the public," I liatt said.
The festival will consist of topics
discussed in 90-minute dialogues
hosted by prominent scientists
from Stanford, UC-Santa Cruz,
UC-Berkeley and other institu
tions. Ranging from physics to psy
chology, this year's topics were
specifically selected to address
questions for which there are no
clear answers. The event's format is
designed to be both entertaining
and educational.
"Topics are made to be genuine
and sexy," Hiatt said.
He further added that Won
derfest is distinct from a lecture
series in that each dialogue will
consist of a pair of speakers who
can argue with each other and
the audience.
"One-third of each 90-minute
dialogue will consist of a question
and-answer session," Hiatt said.
Stanford Natural Science Prof.
Richard Zare, one of the event's or

ganizers, gave his input on the
"wonder" behind Wonderfest.
"Who of us hasn't had won
der about the world we live in?"
Zare said. "[Wonderfest| is not
just for the scientist ... it's
meant for everyone."
He elaborated that "science is
not an authority voice, it's a process
of inquiry."
Wonderfest will kick off on
Saturday with a dialogue be
tween Chemistry Prof. John
Brauman and Physics Prof, and
Nobel Laureate Martin Perl on
the topic "Is Matter still a Mys
tery." The two speakers were
specifically chosen to give view
points from different perspec
tives on the question, Zare said.
Saturday's second talk will in
volve William Coleman from the
Electric Power Research Institute
and Stanford Biology Prof.
Crete lien Daily discussing "Can
Conservation Be Profitable?"
Wonderfest\s Carl Sagan Prize
for Science Popularization will
subsequently be awarded to An
drew Fraknoi, chair of the astron
omy department at Foothill Col
lege and educational consultant
for the Astronomical Society of the
Pacific. In honor of his work in
sharing modern astronomy with
the public , Asteroid 4859 has been
named Asteroid Fraknoi by t he As
tronomical Union.
The day's final dialogue will fea
ture Stanford Physics Profs. Savas
Dimopolous and Andrei Linde
conversing on "Where Did the
Universe Come From?"
" The speakers have a handle on
this topic as good as anybody on
this planet," I liatt said.
The Sunday morning portion
of the event will involve UC-Santa
Cruz Anthropology Prof. Diane
Cifford-Gonzalez and Stanford
Anthropology Prof. Richard
Klein, addressing the question
"Do We Know I low 1 luman Intel
ligence Evolved?"

"When docs someone be
come human?" Hiatt said.
"Something really remarkable
happened about 50,000 years
ago . . . but what?"
"The two speakers believe
that they're close to an answer,"
he added.
Computer Science Prof. John
McCarthy, one of the fathers of
artificial intelligence, and Ken
neth Taylor, chair of I he Philoso
phy Department, will then discuss
the future of computing when
they address the question "Are
There Natural Limits to the
Power of Computers?"
l'lie speakers will discuss hard
ware and software issues regarding
the production of faster comput
ers, Hiatt said. As device dimen
sions approach the fundamental
limit, several complicating factors
come into play that innovations in
software may resolve.
"This is where A.I. comes in,"he
added. "Could computers end up

being smarter than we are?"
Ihe dialogue portion of the fes
tival will come to a close with UC-
Santa Cruz Psychology Prof.
Campbell Lea per and UC-Berke
ley Research Psychologist Melissa
Adams discussing "Do Men and
Women Think Differently?"
"Everybody knows the answer,"
Hiatt said jokingly. "The question
is how do they differ [and] how
much of that [difference] is cultural
and biological?"
Aside from the six dialogue ses
sions, this year's Wonderfest will
feature two art exhibitions to
showcase the work of Felice
Frankel, a science photographer
and research associate at MIT, and
Nancy Anderson, a former Stan
ford graduate student whose re
search focuses on transgenic light
and the use of green fluorescent
protein in research.
Wonderfest is sponsored by the
Department of Chemistry at Stan
lord and Branson High School.
