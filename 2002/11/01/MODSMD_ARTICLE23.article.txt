## Senior inspires as he battles injuries Taylor Ahlgren copes with disappointment and stays positive 
### JIMMY WU EDITORIAL STAFF 
Last season, the players on the
Stanford men's soccer team did
not vote for its leading scorer as

Men's Soccer
vs. California, Tonight, 7:30 p.m.

Most Inspirational Player.
He wasn't even a starter.
As a matter of fact, in four
years, lie lias played in a grand
total of four games.
A promising player coming
out of Card if F, Calif., senior Tay
lor Ahlgren arrived on the Farm
four years ago extremely excited
to start training for his new team.
Unfortunately, his left foot did
not share his enthusiasm.
Healthy throughout his high
school career, Ahlgren received
stunning news before his first
season started. He had a stress
fracture in his left foot.
The injury forced him to red
shirt, but he did not let it discour
age him from getting lil for the
next season.
But over the last four years,
Ahlgren has lived through any
athlete's nightmare, as similar in
juries forced him out of his sec
ond season and have kept him
sidelined during the current
year, his fourth with the team.
Despite all this, Ahlgren has
maintained a positive attitude
about his role on the team.
"1 have come to terms with my
situation and am trying to con
tribute as much as I am comfort
able with as far as being a part of

the team," Ahlgren said. "It is
hard sometimes to watch prac
tices because I would love so
much to be out there, but 1 un
derstand that is not a part of my
role on the team this year."
As much as Taylor wants to
contribute on the field, head
coach Bret Simon and his team
mates admire his resolve and
ability to be a factor off the field.
"[Ahlgren is ] probably the one
person on the team who shows
the most commitment and love
for being on the team," sopho
more forward James Twellman
said. "Without him, we wouldn't
be where we are right now be
cause he does a lot to keep the
team together, even though lie's
not on the field all the time."
Although Simon will not be
able to use Ahlgren as a defensive
substitute tonight against No. 8
California (11-3-1, 4-1-0 Pacific
-10 Conference), the No. 9 Cardi
nal (11-3-1, 2-2-1) knows it can
count on Ahlgren as its No. 1 sup
porter when things get underway
at 7:30 p.m. at Maloney Field.
Teams can readily recruit tal
ent, but it is often hard to find the
enthusiasm and team-oriented
attitude that Ahlgren possesses so
wholeheartedly.
"Watching him through the
whole time he's been injured has
been amazing," junior midfielder
Abe Geiger said. "While he's seen
the least time for practice, his
commitment toward the team is
extraordinary. He maintains
such a positive outlook, and his
contribution off the field has
been quality."
After fracturing his right foot
at the beginning of this season,
Ahlgren has been an invaluable
asset to the team as an assistant
coach. lie makes practices as
often as possible and gives input
about what the team could do to
raise its level of play.
When he suffered a recur
rence of the in jury in his redshirt
freshman year, he was forced to
lose the entire year.
According to Ahlgren, former
head coach Bobby Clark played a
large part in refocusing any neg
ative energy on the senior's part
towards a positive outlook.
"It's hard to cope with setting
goals and being so excited about
achieving them, only to be held
back by physical injuries,"
Ahlgren said. "Bobby Clark said

to me that 1 should hold my head
up high because 1 chose Stanford
as a place to go to school first, and
second as a place to play the
game 1 love. I Ie really helped me
put things into perspective. I re
alized that there isn't anything 1
could have done. I just needed to
make the best of each situation 1
came across."
Things started to look up en
tering Ahlgren's second season,
and for once, his foot held up as
he saw action in four games.
"I loved competing on a daily
basis and making players better
around me," Ahlgren said. "1
couldn't have asked fora better
season individually. I accom
plished my goals of competing at
a high level with the team, staying
healthy, raising the level of the

team by working hard in prac
tices, and being an integral part
of a team that was good enough
to win a national championship."
And now, with another squad
that could potentially challenge
for the NCAA title, he and the
Cardinal head into its rematch
against the Golden Bears with a
lot to prove.
In its past three conference
matchups, Stanford has been un
able to find the back of the net. A 1-
0 loss last week at Cal was among
that stretch. Its recent perfor
mances have dropped Stanford
eight spots in the rankings and to
third place in the I'ac-10 standings.
Despite these setbacks, Simon
believes his team will step it up
this weekend.
"1 think the team remains con

fident," Simon said. "Playing at
home this weekend, having in
jured players back, combined
with hard work will put us over
the hump."
The Cardinal will most likely
have attacking senior defender
Todd Dunivant back closer to full
strength, and All-American se
nior forward Roger Levesque,
who was held out of training this
week, hopes to increase his effec
tiveness on the field.
With those two back, the Car
dinal will have a full lineup for
the first time in weeks.
As has been the case for three
years, the team is still without
Ahlgren in uniform, but either
way, lie will be the first one to
congratulate the team on a well
fought match tonight.

out of Card if F, Calif., senior Tay
lor Ahlgren arrived on the Farm
four years ago extremely excited
to start training for his new team.
Unfortunately, his left foot did
not share his enthusiasm.
Healthy throughout his high
school career, Ahlgren received
stunning news before his first
season started. He had a stress
fracture in his left foot.
The injury forced him to red
shirt, but he did not let it discour
age him from getting lil for the
next season.
But over the last four years,
Ahlgren has lived through any
athlete's nightmare, as similar in
juries forced him out of his sec
ond season and have kept him
sidelined during the current
year, his fourth with the team.
Despite all this, Ahlgren has
maintained a positive attitude
about his role on the team.
"1 have come to terms with my
situation and am trying to con
tribute as much as I am comfort
able with as far as being a part of

the team," Ahlgren said. "It is
hard sometimes to watch prac
tices because I would love so
much to be out there, but 1 un
derstand that is not a part of my
role on the team this year."
As much as Taylor wants to
contribute on the field, head
coach Bret Simon and his team
mates admire his resolve and
ability to be a factor off the field.
"[Ahlgren is ] probably the one
person on the team who shows
the most commitment and love
for being on the team," sopho
more forward James Twellman
said. "Without him, we wouldn't
be where we are right now be
cause he does a lot to keep the
team together, even though lie's
not on the field all the time."
Although Simon will not be
able to use Ahlgren as a defensive
substitute tonight against No. 8
California (11-3-1, 4-1-0 Pacific
-10 Conference), the No. 9 Cardi
nal (11-3-1, 2-2-1) knows it can
count on Ahlgren as its No. 1 sup
porter when things get underway
at 7:30 p.m. at Maloney Field.
Teams can readily recruit tal
ent, but it is often hard to find the
enthusiasm and team-oriented
attitude that Ahlgren possesses so
wholeheartedly.
"Watching him through the
whole time he's been injured has
been amazing," junior midfielder
Abe Geiger said. "While he's seen
the least time for practice, his
commitment toward the team is
extraordinary. He maintains
such a positive outlook, and his
contribution off the field has
been quality."
After fracturing his right foot
at the beginning of this season,
Ahlgren has been an invaluable
asset to the team as an assistant
coach. lie makes practices as
often as possible and gives input
about what the team could do to
raise its level of play.
When he suffered a recur
rence of the in jury in his redshirt
freshman year, he was forced to
lose the entire year.
According to Ahlgren, former
head coach Bobby Clark played a
large part in refocusing any neg
ative energy on the senior's part
towards a positive outlook.
"It's hard to cope with setting
goals and being so excited about
achieving them, only to be held
back by physical injuries,"
Ahlgren said. "Bobby Clark said

to me that 1 should hold my head
up high because 1 chose Stanford
as a place to go to school first, and
second as a place to play the
game 1 love. I Ie really helped me
put things into perspective. I re
alized that there isn't anything 1
could have done. I just needed to
make the best of each situation 1
came across."
Things started to look up en
tering Ahlgren's second season,
and for once, his foot held up as
he saw action in four games.
"I loved competing on a daily
basis and making players better
around me," Ahlgren said. "1
couldn't have asked fora better
season individually. I accom
plished my goals of competing at
a high level with the team, staying
healthy, raising the level of the

team by working hard in prac
tices, and being an integral part
of a team that was good enough
to win a national championship."
And now, with another squad
that could potentially challenge
for the NCAA title, he and the
Cardinal head into its rematch
against the Golden Bears with a
lot to prove.
In its past three conference
matchups, Stanford has been un
able to find the back of the net. A 1-
0 loss last week at Cal was among
that stretch. Its recent perfor
mances have dropped Stanford
eight spots in the rankings and to
third place in the I'ac-10 standings.
Despite these setbacks, Simon
believes his team will step it up
this weekend.
"1 think the team remains con

fident," Simon said. "Playing at
home this weekend, having in
jured players back, combined
with hard work will put us over
the hump."
The Cardinal will most likely
have attacking senior defender
Todd Dunivant back closer to full
strength, and All-American se
nior forward Roger Levesque,
who was held out of training this
week, hopes to increase his effec
tiveness on the field.
With those two back, the Car
dinal will have a full lineup for
the first time in weeks.
As has been the case for three
years, the team is still without
Ahlgren in uniform, but either
way, lie will be the first one to
congratulate the team on a well
fought match tonight.
