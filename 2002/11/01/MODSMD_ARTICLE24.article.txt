# Field hockey seniors fight Cal
## 
### SPENCER PORTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I heir names are Mae, Mya,
Chi, Diesel, Lola and Finn, and
they are leading the Stanford
field hockey team into its biggest
game of the season tomorrow.

Field Hockey
vs. California, Saturday, 1:00 p.m.

Seniors Christina Williams,
Amanda Billmyer, Ami it Chima,
Tysie Sawyer, Lauren Steward
and Li/. Ott will be playing their
lasi collegiate season game this
weekend, and they are ready for it.
The game is also the last sea
son game for their coach, Sheryl
"Choch" Johnson, who will be
stepping down this year after 18
years in the head coaching posi
tion.
And the game decides who will
win the Northern Pacific Athletic
Conference season champi

onship. And it's senior day as well
for the team.
And the game is against Cal.
For these six seniors, it is the cul
mination of four years of hard work.
"It's going to be an exciting
game," Billmyer said. "We get ex
cited for it, [Cal] gets excited for
it. Because of the atmosphere and
the crowd, it's important for us to
play smart and not to get distract
ed. We've seen [Cal] for four
years in a row now, [so] it's im
portant for our class to set the
tone early and to set the example
for us as a team."
Billmyer has had an incredible
year for Stanford and is a good
candidate to be named NorPac
Offensive Player of the Year, with
her team-high eight goals. She
has a total of 17 points on the
year, which ties her with Chima
for the team lead and is one shy of
the career-high 18 points she had
during her sophomore cam
paign. She won NorPac Offensive

Player of the Week honors earlier
in the season alter her first career
hat trick in a game against Saint
Louis.
The seniors also commented
on the crowd I hat is likely lo show
up at the big game. Field hockey
games are usually attended by a
loyal 150 or so fans, but tomor
row's game is sure to draw at
least twice that number, with a
good deal more emotion in the
stands as well.
"At Cal, the crowd is usually
bad, but this year it was surpris
ingly calm," Billmyer said. "We
expect them to send many heck
lers down here."
Chima was also quirk to com
ment on the presence of hecklers
at the game. While she is in favor
of fans supporting the Cardinal,
she advises students to "heckle
with class."

is the fact that all six seniors will
have family in attendance for the
game and will have a special cer
emony before the game honoring
their commitment and impact on
the program.
Put that ceremony is in die
back of the seniors' minds head
ing into the important contest
with the Bears.
"It takes away focus from the
game," Williams said.
"We've always played [the
Bears] on their senior clay,"
Billmyer said. "[But] we are all so
ready to play Cal that we haven't
really thought about senior day."
Chima and the rest of the se
niors echoed these statements, as

they are all ready to take on Cal.
They play tomorrow at 1:()() p.m.
at tlie Artificial Turf Field. Stan
ford is currently one game back
of Cal leading up to the final
game.
Stanford has not fared well re
cently against Cal; in its last 17 Nor-
Pac games, the Cardinal has only
lost three times, all to California.
In a scene eerily reciprocal to
this year, Stanford was ahead one
game in the standings with one
game to play last year, a contest at
Cal. The Cardinal lost, becoming
NorPac: co-champions. Stanford
eventually lost to Cal again in the
NorPac tournament finals.
The Cardinal seniors, in what
may very well be their last game
against the Golden Bears, are
looking to go out on top, for their
coach, lor their team, but, ulti
mately, for themselves.

For these six seniors, it is the cul
mination of four years of hard work.
"It's going to be an exciting
game," Billmyer said. "We get ex
cited for it, [Cal] gets excited for
it. Because of the atmosphere and
the crowd, it's important for us to
play smart and not to get distract
ed. We've seen [Cal] for four
years in a row now, [so] it's im
portant for our class to set the
tone early and to set the example
for us as a team."
Billmyer has had an incredible
year for Stanford and is a good
candidate to be named NorPac
Offensive Player of the Year, with
her team-high eight goals. She
has a total of 17 points on the
year, which ties her with Chima
for the team lead and is one shy of
the career-high 18 points she had
during her sophomore cam
paign. She won NorPac Offensive

Player of the Week honors earlier
in the season alter her first career
hat trick in a game against Saint
Louis.
The seniors also commented
on the crowd I hat is likely lo show
up at the big game. Field hockey
games are usually attended by a
loyal 150 or so fans, but tomor
row's game is sure to draw at
least twice that number, with a
good deal more emotion in the
stands as well.
"At Cal, the crowd is usually
bad, but this year it was surpris
ingly calm," Billmyer said. "We
expect them to send many heck
lers down here."
Chima was also quirk to com
ment on the presence of hecklers
at the game. While she is in favor
of fans supporting the Cardinal,
she advises students to "heckle
with class."

is the fact that all six seniors will
have family in attendance for the
game and will have a special cer
emony before the game honoring
their commitment and impact on
the program.
Put that ceremony is in die
back of the seniors' minds head
ing into the important contest
with the Bears.
"It takes away focus from the
game," Williams said.
"We've always played [the
Bears] on their senior clay,"
Billmyer said. "[But] we are all so
ready to play Cal that we haven't
really thought about senior day."
Chima and the rest of the se
niors echoed these statements, as

they are all ready to take on Cal.
They play tomorrow at 1:()() p.m.
at tlie Artificial Turf Field. Stan
ford is currently one game back
of Cal leading up to the final
game.
Stanford has not fared well re
cently against Cal; in its last 17 Nor-
Pac games, the Cardinal has only
lost three times, all to California.
In a scene eerily reciprocal to
this year, Stanford was ahead one
game in the standings with one
game to play last year, a contest at
Cal. The Cardinal lost, becoming
NorPac: co-champions. Stanford
eventually lost to Cal again in the
NorPac tournament finals.
The Cardinal seniors, in what
may very well be their last game
against the Golden Bears, are
looking to go out on top, for their
coach, lor their team, but, ulti
mately, for themselves.
