The Ducks' recent skid lias
dropped them from national con
tention and jeopardized their
chances of winning the I'ac-10 for
the second straight year.
"1 think there's always a path [to
the Rose Bowl)," Oregon head
coach Mike Bellotti said. '"It would
depend on us winning out."
But for the Ducks, a win against
the Cardinal is about more than
salvaging their season after two
painful defeats. It's about revenge.
Last season, Stanford rolled
into Autzen Stadium, put up 49
points and escaped with a shock
ing win against then-No. 5 Ore
gon. It was the Ducks' lone loss of

the year and ended the nation's
longest home winning streak (23
games). More painfully for the Eu
gene faithful, ii kept ()regon out of
the national championship game.
In other words, Oregon just
might have a little hit of a score to
settle with Stanford.
Stanford is also coming offa dis

Pasadena last weekend, the Cardi

Redshirt freshman quarter
back Kyle Matter, who managed
only 75 yards on 10-of-22 passing
against the Bruins, is expected to
start once again for the Cardinal,
as junior Chris Lewis continues
to be sidelined by a shoulder in
jury suffered against Arizona on
Oct. 19.
Fortunately for Stanford, the
defense has played decently in re
cent weeks, and the running at
tack, led by resurgent senior tail
back Kerry Carter, continues to

Running back Kerry Carter carries the ball against UCLA last week. The senior
will need to help the Stanford offense grind out the clock against Oregon to
morrow if the Cardinal hopes to slow the Ducks' high-octane attack.
