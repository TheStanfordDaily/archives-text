The Ducks' recent skid lias
dropped them from national con
tention and jeopardized their
chances of winning the I'ac-10 for
the second straight year.
"1 think there's always a path [to
the Rose Bowl)," Oregon head
coach Mike Bellotti said. '"It would
depend on us winning out."
But for the Ducks, a win against
the Cardinal is about more than
salvaging their season after two
painful defeats. It's about revenge.
Last season, Stanford rolled
into Autzen Stadium, put up 49
points and escaped with a shock
ing win against then-No. 5 Ore
gon. It was the Ducks' lone loss of

the year and ended the nation's
longest home winning streak (23
games). More painfully for the Eu
gene faithful, ii kept ()regon out of
the national championship game.
In other words, Oregon just
might have a little hit of a score to
settle with Stanford.
