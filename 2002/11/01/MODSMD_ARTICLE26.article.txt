# In praise of the greatest sport of all time
## 
### 
Do you want to participate in a game
this weekend that combines intensi
ty, athleticism, style, grace and en
durance? Well then, I've got two
words lor you, and they sure as hell aren't
"water polo": BEER PONG.
For those of you that think of beer pong as
a mere beer game, along the lines of quarters
01 card games such askings, I am here to drop
knowledge on why, in my humble opinion,
beer pong is the epitome of sport, with all of
the aforementioned qualities.

Oh yeah, it's also got beer,
and a whole lot of it (and I'm
not going to spout off some
cheesedick line like "Save
water, drink beer" to stress
how much I like beer. It
would just trivialize it).
If you have never heard of
beer pong, 1 guess all I have
to say is, get out of the library

and stop working on your ( '.hem problem set
that's due in 10 days. There's more to college

than just working yourself to death in some
cubicle in Green. If there was ever a time for
spurts of binge drinking, it's now, so enjoy it
while it lasts.
With that out of the way, I will now contin
ue to impart wisdom on all of you ignorant
folk who don't know 01 respect the wonder
that is beer pong or who perhaps have it con
fused with its bastard cousin Beirut.
The simplest way to differentiate be-


Mac Levine
tween the two is that in Beirut,
you throw the ping pong ball,
whereas in beer pong, you try to
hit the ball with paddles into
your opponent's cups — you
only throw (and it has to be with
your weak hand) after the other
team sinks a shot.
I don't have enough space to
really explain all of the rules, but
it's actually pretty simple, and that
is where the true genius of the
game lies.
There are two combatants on
each side, aiming at a bowling-pin
style pyramid of six cups filled with
beer. You have to hit the ball with
an arc that gets the ball above your
head, and if you sink a cup, your
opponents have to drink that full
cup of beer and that cup is re
moved from the pyramid; if you
hit but don't sink a cup and the ball
is returned before bouncing twice,
then the point continues, and
whoever loses has to drink half a
beer. If the point continues and
another cup is hit, then it is "two
on" and two halves must be drunk

at the point's conclusion — and so
on and so on.
I'm not doing the game justice
at all with (his quick gloss-over of
the rules, and it's true that almost
every college campus (and even
dilferent fraternities within a sin
gle campus) has its own variation
of the rules. For example, some di
vide the cups into two groups in
the corners of the table, rather
than in a pyramid at the center of
the table's baseline.
But, wait, didn't we invent the
computer or Silicon Valley or
something like that? Can't we just
say we invented beer pong, too?
I hope I explained the game
well enough that each reader has a
broad enough understanding of
beer pong to get by. It truly is a
great game.
Strategy is beyond key, and
teamwork takes weeks, if not
months or even years, to fully de
velop. If you find the right part
ner, it's like Joe Montana scram
bling around in his heyday,
knowing that Jerry Rice would
eventually save him and come
back to the ball. A sort of telepa
thy arises.
Anyone can get lucky, sink a few
shots and win a game, lint the real

test is holding the table, since beer
pong is like streetball — winner
stays on.
Remember though, that in each
game, you're drinking a not-in
signilicant amount of beer. And
after a lew games, you definitely
start feeling the effects.
After a couple of games, the
pyramid of cups isn't as stationary
as it used to be. It's not so easy to
lunge lor that "save" shot, which
bounces towards the side of the
table. Meanwhile, chugging that
cup after the other guy sinks one
isn't st) easy anymore (as an aside,
the term "puke-and-rally" must
have been made with a series ol
beet pong games in mind).
But this is when the true t liam
pions step up. Two minutes left in
the fourth quarter. Two outs in the
bottom ol the ninth. You've played
five straight games, winning them
all. Both sides are now down it)
one cup each.
You're eyes are bloodshot, and
they're closing so quickly that you
can barely keep them open. Your
inner stomach must look like a
washing machine, whirling
around so violently. You can't leel
your legs, like the dork in "Can't
I lardly Wait."

But the music is blasting, your
just-as-intoxicated friends are
cheering and that girl you want to
hook up with is standing in the
corner pretending not to watch,
but really with her eyes glued on
the beer pong warrior that you
have become.
The other team's shot hits your
cup, and the ball bounces off at an
odd angle towards the middle of
the table. You pull together all of
your strength, lunge forward and
put the game-winning shot away,
slamming ii with astounding force
past both your opponents.
Your teammate is ecstatic,
and the two of you embrace.
You're bombed, your team wins,
the crowd goes wild and you get
the girl.
Isn't that what sports is all
about?
