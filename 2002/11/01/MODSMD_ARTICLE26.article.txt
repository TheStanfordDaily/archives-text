# In praise of the greatest sport of all time

Do you want to participate in a game
this weekend that combines intensi
ty, athleticism, style, grace and en
durance? Well then, I've got two
words lor you, and they sure as hell aren't
"water polo": BEER PONG.
For those of you that think of beer pong as
a mere beer game, along the lines of quarters
01 card games such askings, I am here to drop
knowledge on why, in my humble opinion,
beer pong is the epitome of sport, with all of
the aforementioned qualities.

Oh yeah, it's also got beer,
and a whole lot of it (and I'm
not going to spout off some
cheesedick line like "Save
water, drink beer" to stress
how much I like beer. It
would just trivialize it).
If you have never heard of
beer pong, 1 guess all I have
to say is, get out of the library

and stop working on your ( '.hem problem set
that's due in 10 days. There's more to college

than just working yourself to death in some
cubicle in Green. If there was ever a time for
spurts of binge drinking, it's now, so enjoy it
while it lasts.
With that out of the way, I will now contin
ue to impart wisdom on all of you ignorant
folk who don't know 01 respect the wonder
that is beer pong or who perhaps have it con
fused with its bastard cousin Beirut.
The simplest way to differentiate be-
