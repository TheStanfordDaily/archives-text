I he Cardinal brings a 15-1-0 record
into the weekend. (lurrently ridinga streak
of seven consecutive wins, all shutouts, and
having out scored its conference opponents
by ;i combined score of 10-0, Stanford is the
clear favorite in tomorrow afternoon's Big
(lame al 1:()() p.m. at (lal's Coldmati Field.
l'lie (lardinal picked up even more mo
mentum last weekend as it took two wins
on the road from Washington and Wash
ington State. Not only were the victories
important lot Stanford, but they were also

important for its top striker, junior Marcie
Ward, who found the back of the net again
altera brief dry spell in the contests against
Oregon and Oregon State the previous
weekend.
" I believe you can't gauge ast riker's per
formance just on the number of goals they
score," coach Paul Sapsford said. "But
strikers have that belief themselves that
they have to score goals. It's always good
fora striker's confidence to put one in the
net. Marcie, in particular, was impressive
against Washington. We're delighted with
her performance."
Cal, on the other hand, comes into this
weekend's contest after a tough road trip to
Washington last weekend, where it was
handed two losses that brought its record
to 9-6-1.
But even given the Cardinal's skill, the
Colden Bears could present a challenge
with their physical play. Last year's game, a
2-1 Stanford home victory, was a game full
of tough play, fouls and yellow c ards. The
Cardinal travels across the bay expecting

more of the same tomorrow.
"Yes, we're expecting a physical game,"
Sapsford said. " They'll be out for the big
game, trying to make it difficult for us.
They're well organized by their coach, and
it will be difficult to break them down. It'll
be a close game; they always are. We're ex
pecting the same sort of game as we got
from Washington State. [ The Cougars]
were very physical, and we'll be expecting
the same ibis weekend."'
Senior striker Kelsey (larlson was a little
less diplomatic.
" They are always out to get us," Carlson
said. " They hate us."
And while the Colden Bears may be
Stanford's biggest rivals in other sports, the
soccer team looks at them as just another
game, one piece of a much bigger puzzle.
"We definitely like to beat them," Carl
son said, "but I think the rivalry is more on
their side."
