I he Cardinal brings a 15-1-0 record
into the weekend. (lurrently ridinga streak
of seven consecutive wins, all shutouts, and
having out scored its conference opponents
by ;i combined score of 10-0, Stanford is the
clear favorite in tomorrow afternoon's Big
(lame al 1:()() p.m. at (lal's Coldmati Field.
l'lie (lardinal picked up even more mo
mentum last weekend as it took two wins
on the road from Washington and Wash
ington State. Not only were the victories
important lot Stanford, but they were also

important for its top striker, junior Marcie
Ward, who found the back of the net again
altera brief dry spell in the contests against
Oregon and Oregon State the previous
weekend.
" I believe you can't gauge ast riker's per
formance just on the number of goals they
score," coach Paul Sapsford said. "But
strikers have that belief themselves that
they have to score goals. It's always good
fora striker's confidence to put one in the
net. Marcie, in particular, was impressive
against Washington. We're delighted with
her performance."
Cal, on the other hand, comes into this
weekend's contest after a tough road trip to
Washington last weekend, where it was
handed two losses that brought its record
to 9-6-1.
But even given the Cardinal's skill, the
Colden Bears could present a challenge
with their physical play. Last year's game, a
2-1 Stanford home victory, was a game full
of tough play, fouls and yellow c ards. The
Cardinal travels across the bay expecting

more of the same tomorrow.
"Yes, we're expecting a physical game,"
Sapsford said. " They'll be out for the big
game, trying to make it difficult for us.
They're well organized by their coach, and
it will be difficult to break them down. It'll
be a close game; they always are. We're ex
pecting the same sort of game as we got
from Washington State. [ The Cougars]
were very physical, and we'll be expecting
the same ibis weekend."'
Senior striker Kelsey (larlson was a little
less diplomatic.
" They are always out to get us," Carlson
said. " They hate us."
And while the Colden Bears may be
Stanford's biggest rivals in other sports, the
soccer team looks at them as just another
game, one piece of a much bigger puzzle.
"We definitely like to beat them," Carl
son said, "but I think the rivalry is more on
their side."
Senior midfielder Callie Withers added:

Senior midfielder Marcia Wallis, shown above, will try to help the No. 1 Cardinal women's
soccer team keep the heat on the California defense in tomorrow's game in Berkeley.
"1 would say Cal gets up for it more
than we do. 112 would say it's just an
other game, just another chance
for us to play our game. Personal
ly, 1 don't feel a huge rivalry, and I
don't know if our team does. I'd
say we have a bigger rivalry with
Santa Clara."
Nevertheless, the Cardinal cer
tainly isn't going to the East Bay
underestimating its opponent nor
the importance of the game. With
three conference games remain
ing in the season, the Cardinal
finds itself atop the Pacific-10 ('con
ference standings.
Two wins in its final three
games — the Cardinal laces Ari
zona and Arizona State at home

next weekend — can clinch a
share of the conference title and
an automatic postseason berth lor
the Stanford squad.
"I think, player for player, we are
the better team," Carlson s;iid. "But
playing on their home turf [where
the Bears are 7-1-0] for pride, they'll
be looking for something."
That something — a confer
ence win over the Cardinal — is
something that no team in the l'ac
-10 has been able to find yet. In fact,
no team has yet to sc ore a goal on
the squad in conference play,
thanks to solid defensive play and
spectacular goalkeeping by red
shirt sophomore Nicole Barnhart.
"1 think we match up well
against [Cal], and we're very much
looking forward to the game,"
Sapsfbrd said. "But I think this
team can match up well against
anyone."

at California, Saturday, 1:00 p.m.

I he Cardinal brings a 15-1-0 record
into the weekend. (lurrently ridinga streak
of seven consecutive wins, all shutouts, and
having out scored its conference opponents
by ;i combined score of 10-0, Stanford is the
clear favorite in tomorrow afternoon's Big
(lame al 1:()() p.m. at (lal's Coldmati Field.
l'lie (lardinal picked up even more mo
mentum last weekend as it took two wins
on the road from Washington and Wash
ington State. Not only were the victories
important lot Stanford, but they were also

important for its top striker, junior Marcie
Ward, who found the back of the net again
altera brief dry spell in the contests against
Oregon and Oregon State the previous
weekend.
" I believe you can't gauge ast riker's per
formance just on the number of goals they
score," coach Paul Sapsford said. "But
strikers have that belief themselves that
they have to score goals. It's always good
fora striker's confidence to put one in the
net. Marcie, in particular, was impressive
against Washington. We're delighted with
her performance."
Cal, on the other hand, comes into this
weekend's contest after a tough road trip to
Washington last weekend, where it was
handed two losses that brought its record
to 9-6-1.
But even given the Cardinal's skill, the
Colden Bears could present a challenge
with their physical play. Last year's game, a
2-1 Stanford home victory, was a game full
of tough play, fouls and yellow c ards. The
Cardinal travels across the bay expecting

more of the same tomorrow.
"Yes, we're expecting a physical game,"
Sapsford said. " They'll be out for the big
game, trying to make it difficult for us.
They're well organized by their coach, and
it will be difficult to break them down. It'll
be a close game; they always are. We're ex
pecting the same sort of game as we got
from Washington State. [ The Cougars]
were very physical, and we'll be expecting
the same ibis weekend."'
Senior striker Kelsey (larlson was a little
less diplomatic.
" They are always out to get us," Carlson
said. " They hate us."
And while the Colden Bears may be
Stanford's biggest rivals in other sports, the
soccer team looks at them as just another
game, one piece of a much bigger puzzle.
"We definitely like to beat them," Carl
son said, "but I think the rivalry is more on
their side."
Senior midfielder Callie Withers added:

Senior midfielder Marcia Wallis, shown above, will try to help the No. 1 Cardinal women's
soccer team keep the heat on the California defense in tomorrow's game in Berkeley.
"1 would say Cal gets up for it more
than we do. 112 would say it's just an
other game, just another chance
for us to play our game. Personal
ly, 1 don't feel a huge rivalry, and I
don't know if our team does. I'd
