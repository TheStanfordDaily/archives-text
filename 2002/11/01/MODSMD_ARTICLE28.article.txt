# Baseball not out of the woods just yet
## 
### 
Remember when base
ball was reeling? Re
member all the rants
and raves regarding
steroids and revenue sharing?
Remember the talk of taxes, the
tied All-Star game and tills over
the fate of Ted Williams' body?
While two classic pennant
races, the thrill of twilight World
Series c lashes and a new cast of
unlikely October heroes have all
but cryogenically frozen those
summer nightmares, baseball's
troubles endure.
I don't mean to bring you
down off your high—Angels
fans feel free to stop reading this
column now — but there are
portentous dark clouds ahead,
prepared to rain on baseball's
proverbial parade.
Baseball's next potential blow
looms larger than the two-head
ed monsters of Donald Fehrand

Bud Selig,
Schilling and
Johnson and
Darren and
Dusty Baker.
Baseball's next
potential blow is
of global pro
portions. Liter
ally.
Lost among

the endless labor disputes and
strike dates this summer, the In
ternational Olympic Committee
reared its sleazy, scandalous head
once more, this time proposing to
drop baseball and softball, as well
as the modern pentathlon, from
the Summer Olympics beginning
in 2008.
As golf and rugby are consid
ered for addition, newly-elected
lOC president Jacques Rogge
has stressed that adding any new
sports would now require elimi
nating others.
Stanford head baseball coach
Mark Marquess, who has sent 20
Stanford players to the US na
tional team over the last 19 years
and led Team USA to the gold
medal when baseball was a
demonstration sport at the Seoul
Olympics in 1988, broke it down
to me quite simply.
"It's all financial," Marquess'
said. "They want the best players,
and they're not getting the best
players."
Basically, the Olympics wants
to be able to market the very best
athletes in each sport, and Major
League Baseball, unlike profes
sional basketball and hockey, has
not made it feasible for its players
to participate.
Without delving too deep into
the issue of whether or not the

Olympics should include profes
sional athletes (minor league
players made up l earn USA in
2000), 1 think the amateur aspect
was the beauty of Olympic hock
ey and basketball before breaks
during the NHL season and the
Dream Team came into being.
Whether or not Major League
Baseball should make similar
concessions, I've got several other
problems with the lO(''s propos
al, not the least ol which is the fact
that these are the same Summer
Olympics that include rhythmic
gymnastics and trampoline as
events. Twirling ribbons attached
to sticks! I could just stop there.
But seriously, how can the
lOC] retain events such as these
and eliminate a sport such as
baseball that is growing in popu
larity and has been a successful
event since it was officially adopt
ed as a medal event in 1992 along
with Softball?
Why can't baseball, softball,
golf and rugby coexist? While
construction costs for baseball
and softball venues might be one
legitimate factor, the proposal to
eliminate baseball could not pos
sibly be clue to poor attendance.
Lven without t he absolute best
professionals competing, baseball
ranked in the top five in atten
dance in Sydney and drew large
crowds four years prior in Atlanta
as well. Does the panel not realize
that the paltry attendance at
Montreal's Olympic Stadium
during the MLB season has ab
solutely no bearing on the 112 uture
success of C)lympic baseball?
Imagine the Olympics in San
Francisco in 2012 without base
ball and softball, with Pacific Bell
Park being used as a rugby field.
Sickening, isn't it? Beijing with
out baseball in 2008 would be
tragic as well.
I his isn't an issue of keeping a
sport so that the United States can
win another gold medal. In fact,
the competition lias been tremen
dous in recent years. More im
portantly, the elimination of
Olympic baseball would have
negative implications for the fu
ture globalization of the sport.
"It would be unfortunate for
t lie sport worldwide," Marquess
said. "1 think there has been a big
growth in baseball. The quality of
play has increased, and it would
be a shame | lor the lOC to elimi
nate baseball]."
As baseball's top executives
continue to lobby their case, an
lOC executive panel will decide
baseball's Olympic fate later this
month. Only then will we see if
baseball's future is entirely bright.

tragic as well.

Remember when base
ball was reeling? Re
member all the rants
and raves regarding
steroids and revenue sharing?
Remember the talk of taxes, the
tied All-Star game and tills over
the fate of Ted Williams' body?
While two classic pennant
races, the thrill of twilight World
Series c lashes and a new cast of
unlikely October heroes have all
but cryogenically frozen those
summer nightmares, baseball's
troubles endure.
I don't mean to bring you
down off your high—Angels
fans feel free to stop reading this
column now — but there are
portentous dark clouds ahead,
prepared to rain on baseball's
proverbial parade.
Baseball's next potential blow
looms larger than the two-head
ed monsters of Donald Fehrand

Bud Selig,
Schilling and
Johnson and
Darren and
Dusty Baker.
Baseball's next
potential blow is
of global pro
portions. Liter
ally.
Lost among

the endless labor disputes and
strike dates this summer, the In
ternational Olympic Committee
reared its sleazy, scandalous head
once more, this time proposing to
drop baseball and softball, as well
as the modern pentathlon, from
the Summer Olympics beginning
in 2008.
As golf and rugby are consid
ered for addition, newly-elected
lOC president Jacques Rogge
has stressed that adding any new
sports would now require elimi
nating others.
Stanford head baseball coach
Mark Marquess, who has sent 20
Stanford players to the US na
tional team over the last 19 years
and led Team USA to the gold
medal when baseball was a
demonstration sport at the Seoul
Olympics in 1988, broke it down
to me quite simply.
"It's all financial," Marquess'
said. "They want the best players,
and they're not getting the best
players."
Basically, the Olympics wants
to be able to market the very best
athletes in each sport, and Major
League Baseball, unlike profes
sional basketball and hockey, has
not made it feasible for its players
to participate.
Without delving too deep into
the issue of whether or not the

Olympics should include profes
sional athletes (minor league
players made up l earn USA in
2000), 1 think the amateur aspect
was the beauty of Olympic hock
ey and basketball before breaks
during the NHL season and the
Dream Team came into being.
Whether or not Major League
Baseball should make similar
concessions, I've got several other
problems with the lO(''s propos
al, not the least ol which is the fact
that these are the same Summer
Olympics that include rhythmic
gymnastics and trampoline as
events. Twirling ribbons attached
to sticks! I could just stop there.
But seriously, how can the
lOC] retain events such as these
and eliminate a sport such as
baseball that is growing in popu
larity and has been a successful
event since it was officially adopt
ed as a medal event in 1992 along
with Softball?
Why can't baseball, softball,
golf and rugby coexist? While
construction costs for baseball
and softball venues might be one
legitimate factor, the proposal to
eliminate baseball could not pos
sibly be clue to poor attendance.
Lven without t he absolute best
professionals competing, baseball
ranked in the top five in atten
dance in Sydney and drew large
crowds four years prior in Atlanta
as well. Does the panel not realize
that the paltry attendance at
Montreal's Olympic Stadium
during the MLB season has ab
solutely no bearing on the 112 uture
success of C)lympic baseball?
