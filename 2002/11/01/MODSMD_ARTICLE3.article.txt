# Atty. General race heats up
## 
### MIKEY LEE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Bill Lockyer and Dick Ackerman are the two
major-party candidates squaring off in the race for
California's attorney general. Lockyer, the Democ
ratic incumbent, seeks a second term in which he
hopes to continue building on the work he did dur
ing his first term. Ackerman, a Republican state sen
ator from Orange County, is vying for the position,
claiming that Lockyer has been doing nothing to
combat corruption.
California's attorney general works through the
California Department of Justice to ensure that state

laws "are uniformly and adequately enforced" ac
cording to the California Constitution. Other re
sponsibilities of the position include establishing and
managing programs that are aimed at protecting the
people of California from activities that are fraudu
lent or illegal.
Lockyer, 61, earned his bachelor's degree at UC-
Berkeley, a teaching credential from Cal State Uni
versity in I layward and a law degree from University
of Pacific's McGeorge School of Law. 1 le served as a
state senator for Hi years before he was elected attor
ney general in 1998.
Hiscampaign focus has been on
civil, consumer and environmen
tal rights. ()neof the main issues in
Lockyer's campaign is using DNA
technology to solve crimes and
stop criminals. Lockyer also
played a role in last year's antitrust
case against Microsoft, in which
another ruling is supposed to be
given today.
Ackerman, 59, considers many
of Lockyer's moves a result of mis
placed priorities, he said in last
Sunday's issue of the San Francis
co (Ihronicle.
"There are two types of attor
ney generals," Ackerman said.
"There are activists who go out
and try to do things, and those
who are more traditional and stay
within the restraints the Constitu
tion describes. 1 would follow the
charge of the Constitution."
Ackerman earned his bache
lor's degree and law degree from
UC-Berkeley. He has been an at
torney in private practice since
1968 and has served in the State
Legislature since 1995.
Ackerman, whose campaign
foc us is on experienced leadership
to light crime and "weed corrup
tion out of state government," said
that he thinks Lockyer — who has

already talked of making a bid for
the governor of California in
2006 — is serving his own political
interests rather than that of the
people. Ackerman also accuses
Lockyer of "looking the other
way" regarding Gov. Gray Davis'
fundraising practices.
"I thought being called an ac
tivist was a compliment," Locky
er countered in the Chronicle.
"What's the opposite of ac
tivist — inactive?"
The term for attorney general
is four years, and since 1990, there
has been a two-term limit set on
the statewide offices of governor,
lieutenant governor, controller,
secretary of state, treasurer, super
intendent of public instruction
and insurance commissioner —
positions that will all be voted
upon next Tuesday.
Other candidates running for
attorney general include Diane
Beall Templin of the American In
dependent Party, Glen Freeman
Mowrer of the Green Party and Ed
Kuwatch of the Libertarian Party.
