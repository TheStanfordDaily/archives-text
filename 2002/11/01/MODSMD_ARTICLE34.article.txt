from the Stanford women's volley
ball team's match against top
ranked Southern California on
Oct. 4 that have haunted the Car
dinal players for the last four
weeks.

The seven match points that
the Cardinal women let slip by in
their 24-22 fifth-game loss in that
marathon contest would probably
be hard enough to forget on their
own. But the Stanford coaches
have done plenty to keep the
painful memories of that fateful
night in Maples Pavilion fresh in
the minds of their players, as the
team heads into tomorrow's all
important rematch with the No. I
Trojans (18-0, 11-0 Pacific-10
Conference) in Los Angeles.
"We've watched that fifth
game [against USC] on video like
a hundred times," said freshman

setter Katie Coldhahn, who has
split time lately with regular
starter junior Anna Robinson.
"We've learned what we have to
do if we're in that situation
again, and it's given ns the drive
to try to go out there and beat up
on them."
But before the No. 0 Cardinal
(19-3, 9-2) gets it chance for re
venge against the Trojans, it will
have to deal with struggling —
but always dangerous at home —
No. IS UCLA(I2-9, 5-6) tonight.
1 he Bruins are coining off a
pair of losses to Washington and
No. 17 Washington State last
weekend that dropped them into
a three-way tie for fourth in the
Pac-10, a full six games back of
USC, and to a dismal 3-8 on the
road for the season.
I lowever, UCLA is a perfect 4-
0 at Pauley Pavilion this year, and
with the NCAA tournament
hopes of the longtime power
house Bruins teetering, Stanford
is expecting a big effort from the
Westwood squad.
"UCLA is clearly good enough
that it's a match we have to focus
on," Stanford coach John Dun

ning said. "We're preparing for
them [Thursday], and we're
preparing for them [Friday]. We'll
prepare for USC when we get
there [on Saturday]."
I he Cardinal, clearly reeling
from its loss to USC the previous
night, fought off the Bruins 3-1 in
a sloppy match on Oct. 5 at
Maples, but Stanford expects it
will need a much better effort
tonight to pick up its fourth
straight win over UCLA.
"We can't overlook UCLA be
cause they're a much better team
at home," Goldhahn said. "We'll
have USC in the back of our
minds, but UCLA is the first focus
for now."
Saturday's night match will pit
two of the most powerful teams in
the country against each other in
a match that is probably a must
win for the Cardinal il it is going
to retain its Pac-10 title. A win
would also help Stanford's
chance of earning one of the top
four seeds for the NCAA tourna
ment, which brings with it home
court advantage all the way up to
the Final Four.
The Trojans lead the confer

ence and rank third in (lu- nation
in kills. I"he Cardinal leads the
conference and ranks second in
the nation in hitting percentage.
(No. 2 I lawaii, which Stanford will
lace next weekend, leads die na
tion in both categories.)
I he teams are also 1-2 in the
conference in blocking, though
Stanford has a decisive H. 7.1 to
2.97 block |>ei game advantage
over USC
I he Cardinal's block, which
ranks second in the nation as well,
will be key in slowing the Trojans'
ferocious attack. Stanford junior
middles Jenn Harvey and Sara
McGee are the top blockers in the
Pat-10, with Harvey's 1.54 blocks
per game putting her second in
the NCAA.
"|The Trojans] have got good
hitters all over the place, so we've
got to be disciplined on the block
and hit our spots," McGee said.
Content with the improvement
he has seen in his team's defense,
which has been the Cardinal's
focus in practice for much of the
season, Dunning has turned his
attention back to sharpening the
team's offense.

All-American outside hitters
senior Logan Tom and sopho
more Ogonna Nnamani already
rank fourth and sixth in the Pao
10 in kills, respectively, combin
ing for 8.()1 per game. But Dun
ning is looking to spruce things
up in the Cardinal s attack while
polishing the team's few remain

ing rusty spots.
"We're looking at our rotations
to see where there are weaknesses
and where we've been giving up
streaks of points," Dunning said.
"We're adding different plays and
different formations, because
we've been working hard and im
proving on our defense all season."

The seven match points that
the Cardinal women let slip by in
their 24-22 fifth-game loss in that
marathon contest would probably
be hard enough to forget on their
own. But the Stanford coaches
have done plenty to keep the
painful memories of that fateful
night in Maples Pavilion fresh in
the minds of their players, as the
team heads into tomorrow's all
important rematch with the No. I
Trojans (18-0, 11-0 Pacific-10
Conference) in Los Angeles.
"We've watched that fifth
game [against USC] on video like
a hundred times," said freshman

setter Katie Coldhahn, who has
split time lately with regular
starter junior Anna Robinson.
"We've learned what we have to
do if we're in that situation
again, and it's given ns the drive
to try to go out there and beat up
on them."
But before the No. 0 Cardinal
(19-3, 9-2) gets it chance for re
venge against the Trojans, it will
have to deal with struggling —
but always dangerous at home —
No. IS UCLA(I2-9, 5-6) tonight.
1 he Bruins are coining off a
pair of losses to Washington and
No. 17 Washington State last
weekend that dropped them into
a three-way tie for fourth in the
Pac-10, a full six games back of
USC, and to a dismal 3-8 on the
road for the season.
I lowever, UCLA is a perfect 4-
0 at Pauley Pavilion this year, and
with the NCAA tournament
hopes of the longtime power
house Bruins teetering, Stanford
is expecting a big effort from the
Westwood squad.
"UCLA is clearly good enough
that it's a match we have to focus
on," Stanford coach John Dun

ning said. "We're preparing for
them [Thursday], and we're
preparing for them [Friday]. We'll
prepare for USC when we get
there [on Saturday]."
I he Cardinal, clearly reeling
from its loss to USC the previous
night, fought off the Bruins 3-1 in
a sloppy match on Oct. 5 at
Maples, but Stanford expects it
will need a much better effort
tonight to pick up its fourth
straight win over UCLA.
"We can't overlook UCLA be
cause they're a much better team
at home," Goldhahn said. "We'll
have USC in the back of our
minds, but UCLA is the first focus
for now."
Saturday's night match will pit
two of the most powerful teams in
the country against each other in
a match that is probably a must
win for the Cardinal il it is going
to retain its Pac-10 title. A win
would also help Stanford's
chance of earning one of the top
four seeds for the NCAA tourna
ment, which brings with it home
court advantage all the way up to
the Final Four.
The Trojans lead the confer

ence and rank third in (lu- nation
in kills. I"he Cardinal leads the
conference and ranks second in
the nation in hitting percentage.
(No. 2 I lawaii, which Stanford will
lace next weekend, leads die na
tion in both categories.)
I he teams are also 1-2 in the
conference in blocking, though
Stanford has a decisive H. 7.1 to
2.97 block |>ei game advantage
over USC
I he Cardinal's block, which
ranks second in the nation as well,
will be key in slowing the Trojans'
ferocious attack. Stanford junior
middles Jenn Harvey and Sara
McGee are the top blockers in the
Pat-10, with Harvey's 1.54 blocks
per game putting her second in
the NCAA.
"|The Trojans] have got good
hitters all over the place, so we've
got to be disciplined on the block
and hit our spots," McGee said.
Content with the improvement
he has seen in his team's defense,
which has been the Cardinal's
focus in practice for much of the
season, Dunning has turned his
attention back to sharpening the
team's offense.
