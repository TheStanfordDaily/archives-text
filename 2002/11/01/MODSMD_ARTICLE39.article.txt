# 'Ring': Scary as shit despite plot holes
## 
### CHRIS LEE 
Sometimes, a movie defies the impossi
ble and becomes more than the sum of its
parts. "The King," an American adaptation
of a cult Japanese horror film, doesn't
seem too impressive on paper. For one, it's
directed by Gore Verbinski, who was be
hind such unexciting snoozers as "Mouse
Hunt" and"The Mexican." That Verbins
ki would aspire to make a film in the hor
ror genre is admirable, but his "style" is a
drag at times. One look at the opening
scene of "The Ring," a pale and stale imita
tion of "Scream's" intro, and you'll get the
picture. Verbinski is just good enough not
to mess up ;i movie while managing to
leave it completely devoid of personality.
Everything seems to have been done be
fore in Verbinski's world, and it's probably
this bland dependability that makes
Dreamworks keep coming back to him.
Ehren Kruger's screenplay, mean
while, is a compromise of sorts. 1 won't talk
about the film's plot holes, which are nu
merous. More annoying is that the script
itself also feels secondhand at times —
overt cliches are avoided, but what we
often get is dialogue that still feels pre
dictable and unexciting.
The immediately pleasing object of in
terest is gorgeous Naomi Watts, whose at
tention-getting performance in last year's
mindbender "Mullholland Drive" was ob
viously no fluke. Watts doesn't have to flex
too many acting muscles here — this is a
horror movie we're talking about — but
it's her presence and scorching good looks
that keep you around until the film finally
gets moving.
And move it does. This may have start
ed out as a negative review, but frankly,
dear reader, this movie scared the shit out
of me. The premise is intriguing: some
how there has come into existence a mys
terious tape of psychedelic imagery that

kills anyone who
watches it. It
works like this:
Watch the tape
and immediately

afterwards you get a phone call telling you
you've got seven days to live. One week
later, you're dead. Watts plays a single
M.I.L.F. whose niece was a victim of the
tape. When she watches the tape herself,
she's got no choice but to get to the bottom
of it before it claims her life as well. In the
process, her ex-lover (Martin Henderson)
and young son (David Dorfman, a lost
Culkin brother) also see the video and get
caught up in the mess.
Where the movie goes with this is any
one's guess, making it both frustrating and
exciting to watch. There are so many plot
elements that we soon realize no amount of
explanation can possibly justify everything.
A dramatic backstory involving a disturbed
little girl and her dysfunctional parents
doesn't begin to fill in the holes. What
makes the movie scary is that we have no
idea what the rules are, or the reasons why
things happen — it's a cheap gimmick on
the filmmakers' part, but is very effectively
played out. And just when it all appears to
end in a pat, if flawed, resolution, the movie
can't resist adding a final sequence that
throws all safety out the window.
Kudos to the actors for keeping me in
terested with their minimal characteriza
tions; Watts and Henderson ground the
audience with their realism. And despite
my railing on Verbinski earlier, there are
some eerily haunting sequences captured
here (including the scariest rampaging
horse scene in recent memory) that make
you think that someday he might actually
dare to develop a style of his own. In the
end, "The Ring" is one of those movies that
actually delivers; don't think about it too
hard (believe me, you probably won't want
to) and just enjoy the ride.


Kids are scary. Especially creepy tweaked-out little girls covered in sweat, staring at the floor
