In an effort to "cater to Stanford's diverse musical
interests," Stanford Concert Network has enlisted six
honorary Kentucky Colonels to headline the annual
Big Came concert on Nov. 23. These colonels have no
ties to RFC or the military: They are the Nappy Roots,
a down-home, southern-fried rap sextet from West
ern Kentucky whose MTV-friendly hits "Awnaw" and
"Po' Folks" have propelled their latest album to plat
inum status.
Oh yeah, and Kentucky Gov. Paul Patton named
them Kentucky Colonels on Sept. 16, a day he declared
"Nappy Roots Day" as his administration partnered
with the rappers to commemorate the Kentucky Edu
cational Excellence Program.
