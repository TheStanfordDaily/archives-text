# 'Abandon' any hope for this weak
## Psycho thriller 
### JENNIE KIM 
In "Abandon," Katie Burke (Katie
Holmes) is your typical over-achieving,
stressed-out college senior. She's facing
an incomplete honors thesis, finals, grad
uation and a competitive post-college job
market. As if that weren't enough (and of
course it isn't), she's also being stalked by
her old boyfriend, Embry, an intense stu
dent composer who vanished mysteri
ously two years ago and was presumed
dead. Don't you just hate when that hap
pens?
The real tragedy of "Abandon" is what
it could have been. Written and directed
by Stephen Gaghan (Oscar winner for
"Traffic"), it's marked by his signature
touch — lots of blue-tinged lighting,
multi-layered storylines and scenes deft
ly scattered back and forth. Visually en
gaging, the depressing, East Coast col
lege setting is never named, but has an
imposing gray stone facade, lots of wind
ing dark tunnels over still water and li
brary stacks that are scarier than Green's
south side after dark.
Yet what "Abandon" gains in style, it
lacks in the substance, namely a halfway
believable storyline and decently devel
oped characters, which made "Traffic" so
successful. Holmes is passable here in her
latest role, playing the youngest looking
23-year-old in the world. To be fair, the
script gives her little to work with, which
may explain why she never comes close
to achieving her "Wonder Boys" lumi
nosity.
Charlie Hunnam, so good in TV's
"Undeclared" and "Queer as Folk," does
as much as he can as Embry, but neither
he nor Benjamin Bratt's character, De
tective Wade Handler, have any palpable

chemistry
with Holmes.

relationships
with these
men are farci
cal; It is never
explained
what lies at the

root of her undying love for Embrv, a
wannabe artist and trust fund baby with
ADD, social anxiety and violent tenden
cies. Sure, he's hot, but wake up, girl —
he's creepy! You could chalk it up to gen
eral masochism, but even more puzzling
is her romance with Handler, a recover
ing alcoholic with "unusually kind eyes"
who says things like, "Ah . . . Steam heat
— the best kind."
On the upside, the yawning gaps in
plot development left me plenty of time
to ponder Bratt's remarkably wide, chis
eled jaw: Sexy or freakish? I settled some
where in between on 'striking.'
Throughout "Abandon," I felt as
though the movie would work much bet
ter as a dramatic mystery rather than the
"psychological thriller" it's being touted
as. There is not enough suspense, fear or
even simple visceral gore to satisfy the
thrill-seeking viewer. The intent is there,
but the process is all wrong.
All of the inconsistencies in the plot are
supposed to be resolved by the film's sur
prise ending. This is where the crap really
hits the fan. Ever since "The Sixth Sense,"
it seems as though a dramatic plot twist is
now a requisite element for an artsy scary
movie. Filmmakers don't seem to realize
that this technique only works if the plot
doesn't suck. "Abandon's" ending is too
unbelievable to be effective. Instead, it
only highlights its weakness as a thriller.
