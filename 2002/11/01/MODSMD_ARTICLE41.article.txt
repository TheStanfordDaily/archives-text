### JESSICA JOEFFE 
"The Truth about Charlie" \
is Jonathan Deinme's vision
of what the 1963 thriller
"Charade" would look like
through the multi-colored
lenses of political correctness.
Set in Paris, it tells the story of
Regina Lambert (Thandie
Newton), her husband (a du-

bious fop named Charles Lambert), a mot
ley crew of international bandits and the
Parisian police force, whose predatory com
mandant has a remarkable penchant for
wearing fingerless leather gloves. Baking
somewhere on a Club Med beach, Regina
has just decided that three months of mar
riage are more than sufficient and she wants
out. Unfortunately, Charles beats her to it.
On a business trip to Switzerland, he is mur
dered and flung off a train, conveniently
leaving their ravaged apartment in Paris
and the unraveling of his sordid past for the
missus to deal with.
It turns out she knows nothing about her
husband, especially not about his collection
of fake passports and aliases, or that their
lifestyle was funded with money stolen from
the U.S. government. Naturally, all this
money's still around somewhere, and every
one wants to get their sweaty little mitts 011 it
before someone else does. Hut the real mess
starts with Marky Mark Wahlberg — wear
ing a darling beret/mock turtleneck en
semble and an occasional baguette wedged
under his arm — suddenly popping up
everywhere Regina goes. He bats his stubby
eyelashes at her, offers his six-packed help,
but he too has a proclivity to change his
identity every 10 minutes. Poor Regina is
completely confused: Does she really know
any of the men she so hopelessly falls for?
The original, which featured the unbeat
able sass and chemistry of Cary Grant and
Audrey Hepburn, was an elegant little para
ble about trust encased in a deliriously

wicked script. From the
Hitchcockian credits through

the final shootout, the film was all

about style. Lots of it. Hep
burn never takes off her
dainty kitten heels, Kelly
bag or brightly orange
coat, even as she is being
pursued at break-neck
speed through the
Parisian streets by an t

assortment of greedy fellows
Charles Lang's cinematogra-

phy in "Charade" echoes
this: His camera dances

around its subjects
smoothly and lightly, to

ensure we're not taking

my of it too seriously
md that there are

few things more
important than

good ripostes, the
right dress, and

filter-less Gitanes.
None of this
holds up in the current
version. To fill Grant's
shoes with Wahlberg's

pigeon-toed stompers is
beyond comprehension, and

while Ms. Newton's not quite insuf-

ferable, she's just banal. The real
mistake, however, was to pair down
the script to remove any element of
logic or consistence from it, in favor of
zany, cutting-edge camera work. The
final result is so sophomoric that
even Tim Robbins' performance

turns out lackluster.
Why Demme had the audacity
to take a near perfect work like

"Charade" and churn out an abused
version in"The Truth About Charlie"
is anyone's guess, so instead of con
templating the answer, save your eight
bucks and rent the original.



Newton sports a stylish handbaq;
Wahlberg sports a beret.
