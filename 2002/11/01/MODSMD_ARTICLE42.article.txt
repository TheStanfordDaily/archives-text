# Guests in your house: Phantom Planet is doing the panic
## 
### MIKEY LEE 
Sam Farrar leaned against a tour bus out
side the Continental Hotel in Buffalo, NY,
cell phone pressed against his ear. A long
way from his native Southern California, he
and the rest of his band had just finished up
their own headlining tour. That evening,
they would begin touring with Elvis Costel
lo, an artist whom the band claims as one of
its biggest influences.
"It'll be different," said Farrar, the band's
bassist. "There are obviously people who
want to see us play in smaller clubs that
don't sell out, but we'll he opening for Elvis,
which is pretty awesome."
Before drummer Jason Schwartzman
played Max Fischer in the cult classic "Rush
more," he kept the beat fora little-known
band called Phantom Planet. With the re
lease of their hit-single "California," which
was featured in the movie "Orange Coun
ty," the band has gained a large following.
MTV added "California" to its rotation after
it won MTV.com's Viewer's Pick Video.
While some of their serious fans may not
like how Schwartzman tends to be the initial
focus of Phantom Planet, the band was, in
fact, his creation. Schwartzman met gui
tarist Darren Robinson through Robinson's
cousin. Lead vocalist Alex Greenwald went
to the same elementary school as Schwartz
man, and guitarist Jacques Brautbar met
Schwartzman in a music store. Bassist Far
rar was Brautbar's high school friend.
"We all kinda grew up around the [Los
Angeles] area," Farrar said. "We all went to
high schools in the same general area, and
we all lived pretty close to each other. As for
[Schwartzman], people may sometimes
think we're not very credible because we
have actors in this band, but if you come to
our shows, you can see the love we have for
each other and the love we have for music."
Schwartzman isn't the only movie star in
the band. Frontman Greenwald played a

tic sounds strategically
put together to stand as a
masterpiece. It is pro
duced by Tchad Blake
(Sheryl Crow and Pearl
Jam) and Mitchell
Froom (Paul McCartney
and Elvis Costello).
"We got really lucky
that we got in contact
with them," Farrar said.
"The story is actually
that [Froom's] daughter
likes our band and that's
how [we met with him].
The first day, all we did
was play music for each
other. After playing for
awhile, it made so much
sense. [Froom] is such a
shy little nerd like we
are. It felt really easy.
[ Blake] is such an audio
engineer. He is so stu
pidly good. He's the
type of guy that'd show
up in Africa with mics in
his ears recording dif
ferent sounds, you
know?"
Phantom Planet joins
the geek-rock circuit
with added flair and a
knack for the unexpect
ed.
"I guess we all grew

role in last year's "Donnie Darko," which co
starred Drew Barrymoreand Noah Wyle, to
name a few.
"Alex is obviously our leader," Farrar
said. "We need a leader in a band with five
people and he's got incredible taste. He
brings in an idea and we all just start fucking
with it."
fhe sound of Phantom Planet's new re
lease, "The Guest," is a cornucopia of eclec-

up listening to the oldies, Nirvana, Pearl
Jam and the stuff you'd expect," Farrar said.
"Obviously Weezer.. .They made it cool to
be a nerd. But with the album, we kind of
built it from the ground up, which was real
ly cool. There are some tracks that are very
experimental."
The band's next album, which Farrar
said should be due out by February or
March if they find a good producer, will

probably keep its experimental streak.
"We all love hip hop, punk and funk."
Farrar said. "[Greenwald] has been getting
us into that. We've also been listening to
some English Beat, and we'd like to play
some stuff that has not necessarily a ska
sound, but maybe more like a reggae feel.
We don't like to stay the same, and we def
initely won't use the same producer twice
just because we want to try out different

sounds."
And where does Farrar hope the band is
in a year?
"Sitting outside the Continental Hotel in
Buffalo with twice as many people at our
show, maybe," Farrar said. "Traveling the
world and playing music, for sure. 1 hope
we're doing the same shit, maybe with more
people coining to see us. That'd be nice.
That and another record (laughs)."


Phantom Planet features members of varying good
looks â€” from devishly handsome to utterly geeky.
