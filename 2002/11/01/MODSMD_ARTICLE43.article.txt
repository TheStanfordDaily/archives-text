# 'I-Spy' one crappy movie
## By HART GILULA 
### 
"I-Spy" is not a horrendous travesty
of a movie. That being said, it is not a
good movie either. "I-Spy" is simply
your standard manufactured Holly
wood garbage. Fresh on the heels of
this summer's astounding flop "The
Adventures of Pluto Nash," Eddie
Murphy stars with Owen Wilson in this
film adaptation of the 1960s "I-Spy"
TV series.
Wilson plays Special Agent Alex
Scott, a discombobulated employee of
the Bureau of National Security (BNS).
When odious arms dealer Arnold Gun
dars (Malcolm McDowell) steals the
"Switchblade," a state-of-the-art, pro
totypal reconnaissance aircraft, BNS
charges Alex with the plane's recovery.
Unfortunately for Alex, BNS hires
the unbearably obnoxious boxer Kelly
Robinson (Murphy), to act as a civilian
front while Alex infiltrates the home of
the boxing-obsessed Gundars.
Agent Rachel Wright (Famke
Janssen) joins the two on their es

capades. Fans of "Office Space" will
recognize Lumbergh (Gary Cole) as
the ridiculous faux-Latin BNS agent,
Carlos. The film's soporific stunt se
quences fail to impress, and the pedes
trian comedy bits elicited only mild
chuckles from a largely adolescent au
dience. Even the fail-safe knee-to-the
groin failed to amuse in this cliched as
sembly of seemingly unrelated gags.
The root of the problem, of course,
is the script, written by Marianne Wib
berley, Cormac Wibberley, Jay Scher
ickand David Ronn. Apparently it now
takes at least four writers to develop a
passable script. If you're dying to see
more hilarious Scherick-Ronn films, be
sure to rent "Serving Sara."
I expected much better results with
the efforts of four experienced scribes.
Oddly enough, these very efforts
plague the script instead of enhancing
it. All of the film's humor feels very ef
fortful. Did it really take four brains to
devise Kelly's clever BNS retort? Oh, 1
get it! Instead of Bureau of National
Security, it's "Bitch that Needs some

Slapping!" Dammit, THAT is comedy.
1 haven't seen humor like this since
Chris Tucker's "But you one crazy-ass
bitch!" line in "Rush Hour 2." There
sure is nothing like a good, original
bitch joke. OK, so the movie isn't funny
— at least it's got awesome stunts and
breathtaking action sequences, right?
Unfortunately for those of us who
like well-choreographed action se
quences, there aren't any in "I-Spy." I
felt consistently let down at the end of
big chases, which all felt annoyingly
unfinished.
Director Betty Thomas ("28 Days"
and "Dr. Doolittle") composes very sta
tic shots that lend an even more stilted
quality to the comedy. She doesn't
even use any of the hot whip pans or
computer-composited transitions that
we've come to expect from today's ac
tion fare. The movie's poster has better
style than the film it advertises.
Folks, you don't need to be a
crooked-nosed secret spy to put the
clues together: DON'T SEE "I-SPY."


We have
no idea
what to make
of this scene.
A motorcycle?
Tuxedos?
Whatever.
