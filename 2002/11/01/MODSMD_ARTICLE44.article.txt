# Dredg's 'El Cielo' — new soul metal messiah?
## 
### KARAN MAHAJAN 
You're sitting at your computer,
listening to this album and think-

ing "woo-holy-ravioli-hoo.
You get online, enter
"dredg" into that übiqui-f
tous Google task-bar that®
is your undoing and a

bunch of wholly un-important
magazines (read: indie) scroll down
in textual frenzy, telling you excit
edly that "Dredg's El Cielo is the
best album of the year."' You yawn
and click through to the hallowed
portals of Rollingstone.com where
an effective search for that same
band draws a blank.
So you've caught a band in the
ether between anonymity and
greatness and recognizing it will
only strengthen your hypothesis
that you're a lot cooler than the
mainstream-pop-pushing-posers
of Rolling Stone, Spin or NME ever
will be.
In fact, all that stands ljetween
"Dredg" and"the next great rock
phenomenon" is certification from
major critics and radio because the
band's first Interscope release "El
Cielo" is undoubtedly an awesome
art-rock album.
Be warned, though. Like this ar
ticle, the album also tends to be
over-indulgent and excessive —
but then again, who cares? It is a
well known fact that when rockstars
go all out for serious artistic cre
ations, they either come off as
lemon-headed bozos like the U2 of
the Pop-era, or they become so
g(xldamn ironic that they end up
actually mocking art. "El Cielo," on
the other hand, collates atmos
phere, sinking sensuality and unex
pected song structures into an in-

somniacal master
piece. The sound
is dreamy with
metal choruses.

Dredg
El Cielo

Unlike many
artists who wear
their pseudo-elec
tronic affiliations
like a badge, the
digital enhance
ments employed
by this Bay Area
act are organic
and inconspicu
ous.
The songs cre
ate a storybook
dynamic. They
feature sudden
pace-changes, an
ambience that
would make Pink
Floyd proud and
they surge at any
given moment
into a Defton-ish
digital bath. Vo
calist Gavin Haves

projects his voice like a more mas
culine Chris Martin and never uses
the effort of his enterprise to be
come the distraught screaming
mad man that many metal singers
are.
On such a concept album, how
ever, describing individual songs is
an exercise in triviality. The only
potential "hit" is the opening song,
"Same Ol' Road," which takes off
with helicopter-esque drumming
effects. Soon after, Haves shifts

from soft to manic and the power
chords careen over the dewy Brit
pop in a distinctly hard-rock mo
ment.
"Sanzene," meanwhile, is really
a compact epic that discharges with
a tripartite "Paranoid Android"
style attack and the cliched refrain;
"hold on," sounds prophetic
among the aggressive guitar whirl
of the chorus. The lyrics, sadly,
leave much to be desired.
That aside, it is perhaps the final

tune on this album, "The Canyon
Behind Her," that is a befitting
summation of the album's virtues.
It begins as a Robert Miles techno
tune, then enters speed-guitar
purgatory, plays a rehashed ver
sion of Nirvana's "Endless Name
less" and finally dampens out in a
choral dirge. Someone takes a
breath, forgets to exhale and the
album is abruptly over.
All through, Dredg's unex
pected time changes are flawless,

as is the seamless blend of vari
ous instruments. Also, you've got
to love them for having an un
pronounceable and unabashedly
sucky name. It's the stuff that
legends are made off: bad
names, good music and unlimit
ed ambition. And really, when
Hayes repeats, "Does anybody
feel this way?" at the end of the
album, it is a purely rhetorical
question — because anyone
who's heard them will.

a compact epic that discharges with
a tripartite "Paranoid Android"
style attack and the cliched refrain;
"hold on," sounds prophetic
among the aggressive guitar whirl
of the chorus. The lyrics, sadly,
leave much to be desired.
That aside, it is perhaps the final

tune on this album, "The Canyon
Behind Her," that is a befitting
summation of the album's virtues.
It begins as a Robert Miles techno
tune, then enters speed-guitar
purgatory, plays a rehashed ver
sion of Nirvana's "Endless Name
less" and finally dampens out in a
choral dirge. Someone takes a
breath, forgets to exhale and the
album is abruptly over.
All through, Dredg's unex
pected time changes are flawless,

as is the seamless blend of vari
ous instruments. Also, you've got
to love them for having an un
pronounceable and unabashedly
sucky name. It's the stuff that
legends are made off: bad
names, good music and unlimit
ed ambition. And really, when
Hayes repeats, "Does anybody
feel this way?" at the end of the
album, it is a purely rhetorical
question — because anyone
who's heard them will.
