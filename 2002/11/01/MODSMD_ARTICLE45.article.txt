# 'Ben Folds Live'
## The 						lovely tale of a man and his piano 
### JONATHAN BEARD 
I don't remember exactly
where I was when 1 first heard
Prince's "I Love U, but 1 Don't
Trust U Anymore." Or Billy
Joel's tender yet cynical "And So
It Goes." But I do remember the
first time 1 heard Elton John's
"Your Song" sung live, as a sparse
and beautiful piano /vocal duet
with Billy Joel on their Face to
Face tour. All of these songs are
now well rooted in my musical
lexicon for one simple reason: the
simplistic power of the piano
and-vocal-only arrangement.
And there's nothing quite as
memorable as hearing such
music performed live, if it's done
well. It is for this reason that the
new Ben Folds CD is so damn po
tent.
Titled "Ben Folds Live" (on
the album cover the L in "Live" is
an F flipped upside down, get it?),
this album sizzles with Folds' tal
ent, energy and wit. He is a beau
tiful piano player, highlighted
here more than ever since it's
only him and his baby grand. His
voice is in good form, and many
of the songs benefit from the live
and musically naked setting. "Zak
and Sara" sounds driven and
fresh, like vintage Elton or Billy
from their hungry days in the
'70s. Folds does a cover of "Tim

Ben Folds
Ben Folds Live

Dancer" to which I could easily
hear Elton say, "Shit — that boy is
good." And the version of Ben
Folds Five classic "Brick" includ
ed is perhaps the most heart
breakingly anguished and stun
ning rendition I've ever heard.
This album is appealing on so
many levels. For Ben Folds
novices who have never owned
any of his CDs, this album serves
as a valid introduction to his ma
terial. For longtime fans, the
record casts many old favorites in
a new light.
There are then those people
who, like my roommate, have al
ways been a little turned off by
the "Ben Folds Five sound," i.e.
the slight bombast of a pianist
perhaps trying to compensate
fora lack of guitarist in the
group. On "Ben Folds Live," the
playing field is leveled — it's all
about the piano now, baby! The
results are raw, impressive and
oh so delectable. Some of these
songs moved me far more than
they ever had before — in short,
they are now almost as memo
rable as hearing Billy and Elton
live together.



Despite captivating
piano skills, Folds
still suffers onslaught
! of receding hairline.
