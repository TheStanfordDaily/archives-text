# Stanford alumnus singer/ songwriter releases debut
## 
### TOM WHITNAH 
With her debut album "Waking Hour," Stanford
alumnus Vienna Teng manages to do what few pop
ular singer / songwriters have done successfully: She
has created an album that is instantly enchanting to
most tastes, yet gets better with each listening. While
"Waking Hour's" lush vocals and beautiful piano
centric melodies are often compared to those of Tori
Amos and Sarah McLachlan, "Waking Hour" still
has a voice and style distinct from any female artist 1
have heard.
Her poignant, personal lyrics, dazzling vocals
and stunningly formed songs dissipate any suspi
cion that "Waking Hour" is just another debut
album from one more disposable singer/song
writer. Though her compositions and lyrics have not
yet reached the complexity of those by someone like
Tori Amos, Teng's musical maturity is still astound
ing for an artist with only one album to date. The im
mense talent displayed on this album seems less un
expected after realizing that Teng has been com
posing since age six and first began writing and per
forming some of the songs for "Waking Hour" in
1995.
Every song on Teng's debut release proves to be
both purposeful and memorable. While hearing just
one song could generally pique the interest of any
one who is interested in new musical artists, it was
not until I listened to the entire album straight
through that I realized what a consistently grand
album "Waking Hour" is. After going to 10 of her
shows and constantly listening to her album (and en
gaging in other admittedly groupie-esque behav
ior), I am impressed by how striking I still find each
of the 13 tracks on this album every time I play them.
Though her debut album does a wonderful job of
capturing the power and elegance of her songs,
Teng's live local performances are where she truly
shines brightest. While the engineering and pro
duction on "Waking Hour" are a far cry from the

overproduced rep
etition of much of
the pop music on
the radio, the
beautifully sparse
elegance of her live
solo performances

reveals that certain tracks on the album could have
benefited from a little less FM-Friendly engineering.
After hearing her first single "Gravity" or her
painfully moving "Between" played live at a local
coffee house or art gallery, every single person who
I have brought to one of her shows has become a
convert to the cult of Teng, and 1 would expect the
same for just about anyone else exposed to this
amazing new musical artist.
Teng will be playing 12 shows in and around the
Peninsula during November including a free show at
Border's on University Ave. on Sunday Nov. 10 at
4:00 p.m. Most shows are either free or have a small
cover charge. More information and mp3s can be
obtained from her Web site at www.\'iennateng.com.
