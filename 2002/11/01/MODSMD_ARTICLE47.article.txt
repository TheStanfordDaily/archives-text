This week, Roxy answers several
queries from her adoring readers.
Names have been changed to pro

Dear Roxy,
My boyfriend, like most boyfriends,
has no trouble getting excited over the
new Victoria's Secret catalog. However,
last weekend when I brought him lingerie
shopping with me, he squirmed the whole
time and couldn't wait to leave the Stan
ford Mall. What gives?
— Totally Humiliated Over
Negligee-liating Guy
THONG, let me be the first to con
gratulate you on your confidence and
courage. It takes quite a woman to be
so assertive in taking action to im
prove her sex life. The fact that your
boyfriend is squeamish does not re
flect on you at all, and, though his re
sponse might seem peculiar, it is not
unexpected.
You're probably thinking, what
sort of sexless fool wouldn't want to
handpick his lady's silky undergar
ments? If your boyfriend is like most
men, I'm sure he's not complaining
about your underwear when the two
of you are alone. Nonetheless, taking
him to the Stanford Mall on the
weekend might not have been the
wisest idea.

For one thing, on weekends the
mall tends to be overrun with local
high school girls and, even worse,
their middle-aged mothers. With
that in mind, you can understand
how it might be uncomfortable for
your boyfriend to point out how
peachy your ass would look in that
lacy silver Calvin Klein thong when
there are seven other women in
close proximity. And how's he sup
posed to envision grabbing your ass
in that thong when the woman
carefully inspecting the same thong
for herself looks like Chris Farley
with lipstick? All you ladies should
understand how unsettling it is to
see a fellow female in the Bloom
ingdale's lingerie section eyeing a
piece of intimate wear that she real
ly shouldn't be eyeing.
That being said, don't give up! Be
a good example: Take him shop
ping for men's underwear and be
quite clear about what you find sexy
and what you expect from him. If
you ask me, he should be thrilled to
high heaven that you offered him
the same opportunity and the least
he can do at that point is be recep
tive to your opinions.
Dear Roxy,
I am a screamer and can't help it. My
partner complains about the neighbors
next door hearing our nightly spectacles
and frankly, the griping is getting to me
and making sex less enjoyable since I'm
always so conscious of this. Why should I

have to keep my mouth shut anyway?
— Your Earnest, Loyal Protegee
YELP, who says you need to keep
your mouth shut? Certainly not I! As
suming that your partner isn't acting
out of legitimate concern for disturb
ing the neighbors, there are a couple
of ways you can remedy the situation.
As it turns out, many people can't
fully experience sexual pleasure if
they don't have some sort of release
mechanism, which in your case
seems to be screaming. That said, if
the noise is really that much of an
issue, consider another physical re
lease. Roxy prefers light biting and
scratching, which has the nice bonus
of leaving a very distinctive pattern
on the backs of her conquests.
If that doesn't seem like a realistic
solution, consider a little nasty talk
during sex. This will distract you
from screaming too loudly and will
allow you to get your lurid thoughts
out of your mind. Be careful,
though. Many a night have been
spoiled by two people whose ideas of
dirty talk differ drastically. It might
be a bit awkward if you expected
your partner to say, "Honey, being
inside you is pure heaven," but in
stead he says, "Whore, get on your
knees now and suck me like the slut
you are!"
