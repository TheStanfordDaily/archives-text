SAN FRANCISCO (AP)
â€” A tiger attacked a kinder
gartner at a school assembly
Friday, sending the 6-year
old boy to a hospital.
The tiger was being led
out of an auditorium at
Baymonte Christian School
by its trainer when it sud
denly lurched over a row of
seats and grabbed the boy
by the head in its jaws,
Scotts Valley Police Capt.
Harry Bidleman said. The
tiger was on a leash, he said,
and children had been kept
clear of the animal during
the assembly.
Principal Steve Patterson
was sitting one row behind
the boy and wrestled him
away from the declawed an
imal, said school spokesman
Jenny Paul.
The boy was airlifted to
Stanford Medical Center,
where he was in guarded
condition. He was admitted
for observation, would un
dergo a CT scan Friday to
find any head injuries not
immediately apparent. He
would then get stitches to a
laceration on his head,
spokesman Robert Dicks
said. Scotts Valley is about
60 miles south of San Fran
cisco and about 30 miles

south of Stanford.
Fhe tiger was in the cus
tody of Zoo to You Wildlife
Education Inc., the compa
ny that brought it to the
school, Bidleman said. Po
lice planned to coordinate
any possible investigation
with Santa Cruz County An
imal Services and the state
Department of Fish and
Game.
"It sounds more acciden
tal than criminal, but there
could be some overseeing
bodies that would want this
completely investigated," he
said.
Paul said the 1-year-old
tiger was brought to the
school as a reward for chil
dren who had sold 10 or
more magazine subscrip
tijns. About 150 students,
from kindergarten through
eighth grade, attended the
assembly, Paul said.
Zoo to You did not im
mediately return a message
asking for comment.
"He was here last year
when he was a little cub. It
was his second visit here,"
Paul said.
