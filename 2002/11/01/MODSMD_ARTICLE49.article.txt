# More than just 'Popular,' nerd-rock allstars Nada Surf

### 
Most people, when asked to describe Nada
Surf, respond, "Huh? Nada what?" A rare few
reply something like this: "Uh, I remember
that song 'Popular.' I think the chorus goes,
'I'm head of the class/ I'm popular/ I'm a quar

terback/ I'm popular...' Is tliat it? Well, they
sound kind of like Weezer."
lliis answer, although much improved
from "Nada what?", saddens a true Nada
Suit aficionado, because "Popular," al
though initially, well, popular, is unquestion
ably the worst song on "High / Low," Nada
Surfs only full-length album (released in the

U.S. in 1996). And
while the bancN
does sound typi-if

innovative and fun
in its own right.

"Popular" was the first sin
gle off their debut album, and
was originally well received by
both critics and the average
Joe. However, like Weezer's
"Sweater Song," it depends on
novelty and attitude for its ap
peal. In fact, "Popular's" novel
format — basically, monotonic
speech detailing a "teenage
guide to popularity" inter
spersed with a lulling chorus of
"I'm popular" —is all it has
going for it. The rest of the
album's songs are vocally and
instrumentally interesting in
Ways that "Popular" can't be
because of its throwaway nov-

elty. The album's intro, "Deeper Well," has a
solid punk l)eat with gritty guitar and crash
ing drums. "Sleep" starts off slow, with a
tinny drum beat, lulling lyrics and a chorus
that simply repeats "I want you to kiss me,"
but when it finally takes off with guitar and
energetic vocals, it would make even the
most reserved listener sing along and head

bang until her glasses fell
off. "Stalemate," with its
lighter sound and Beach
Boys rhythm, is another
good sing-alone, with con-

templative but somehow still upbeat lyrics
like "It's not safe in a safe/When do we admit
it's not safe?" The album's final song, "Zen
Brain," is slower than the other songs on the
album and strikes a brooding chord with its
melodic sound and thoughtful lyrics: "You
wait for summer /And then you wait for win
ter/But there's a total lack of splendor." All
the songs on the album, excluding "Popu
lar," naturally burrow like maggots into the
listener's mind, so singing along is almost
guaranteed, long as one is alone in the car/
room.
Nada Surf is definitely worth a listen, es
pecially if you're into emo pop punk. They
were one of many bands experimenting
with the emo genre in the mid-90s, but
their imaginative lyrical and formatrhoices
single them out as a band to explore. They
haven't gotten much play and they deserve
more recognition, so it's time for you, the
listener who is nobly willing to experiment
with unproven bands, to try them out, even
after all these years. Their new album, "Let
Go," will be released January 2003 in the
U.S., but "High/Low" is available now in a
store near you.
