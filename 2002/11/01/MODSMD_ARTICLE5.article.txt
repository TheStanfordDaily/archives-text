SC IN announced yesterday. Group sales are already un
derway, and tic kets w ill be available to the public at $18

"We're really excited about [the show]," said SCN
Publicity Manager Traci Tsai. "We feel like this is a
good showcase of our efforts to bring different kinds of
music to campus."
SCN Director Eric Blackerby
added, "[The Nappy Roots are]
going to bring hip hop that's on
the radio, so everybody knows it,
and people will be able to partici
pate. It's going to be a fun show.
It's a big name, which makes peo
ple feel excited."
Tsai said SCN hopes to sell out
the 1,700-seat Memorial Auditori
um, a goal that some feel is ambi
tious in light of the slow ticket sales
for past hip-hop acts at Stanford like
Blackaliciousand Remedy. But Tsai
pointed out that Blackalicious'
album was not selling nearly as well
as the Nappy Roots' current
"Watamelon, Chicken, and Critz"
when the Northern California duo
played on campus.
"We feel very confident saying
even if you don't know who they
are, if you hear one of their songs,
you'll know it,"l sai said, adding
that the catchiness of the group's
books attracts many listeners who
don't consider themselves hip
hop fans.
"We're looking at a group at the
height of its popularity and rising,
and they're much more main
stream than any other hip-hop act
that's been brought to Stanford,"
Blackerby said.

The group developed its sound
while at Western Kentucky Univer
sity in the late 19905, inspiringade
voted regional underground fol
lowing and eventually generating
enough buzz to attract the attention
of Atlantic Records.
Despite the Nappy Roots' bur
geoning fame, the group's mem
bers don't have the usual trappings
of rap stardom â€” lyrics like "Ain't
about thuggin'/ It ain't about luis
tlin' / It's about seeing your kids go
without strugglin' " sum up their
down-to-earth philosophy.
" They're definitely country boys,
but.they've got a guy from Oak
land," Blackerby said. " They've got
a down-south sound, but at the
same time it's got a pop influence.
It's something people can dance to."
Sophomore Chris Bravman said
he was looking forward to the show.
"Last year [SCN] had some no
name people (Remedy and -Ith Av
enue Jones) that I had never heard
of," he said. "I'm not a huge fan [of
Nappy Roots] or anything, but I like
their music."
The concert's timing is intended
t(>all< >w Big Cianle specialors time t<)
return to campus and grab dinner
before heading to the show.
"It gives students an outlet for all the
excitement of Big (Jame weekend,"
Blackerby said.
Tsai said S( IN will likely book an
opening act for the show, but has
not signed anyone yet.
