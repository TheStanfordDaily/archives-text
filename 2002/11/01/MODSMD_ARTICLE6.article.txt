# Tour guides and visitors share experiences at Stanford
## Knowing hidden facts, guides serve as University's face 
### JESSICA WANG 
At the forefront of Stanford's
public image is a group of stu
dent tour guides who are often
seen walking around campus
closely followed by camera-tot
ing tourists and prospective
freshmen carrying red folders.
These tour guides divulge little
known facts about the campus
and its fascinating history to the
visitors eager to learn more
about the University.
Student tour guides undergo
a rigorous application process to
qualify for their positions. Guides
take part in comprehensive train
ing to build skills in tour diplo
macy and customer service. They
are also given a binder of infor
mation and are expected to keep
up-to-date on current campus is
sues and developments so that
they are equipped to answer visi
tors' questions.
Andrea Paz Frost, manager
of Visitor Information Ser
vices, said tour guides play a
significant role in representing
the University.
"Guides are encouraged to
use their training, factual infor
mation they have been given,
along with their personal expe
rience and that of their peers, to
present a balanced and ulti
mately positive overview of the

school, and the many opportu
nities available to students," Paz
Frost said.
On the wall of the Visitor
Information Services office is
the "Wall of Myth" that out
lines common myths and
urban legends about campus
history and provides accurate
information regarding these
myths. For example, one of the
myths that is debunked on the
wall is that the black squirrels
on campus were genetically
engineered by Stanford. In ac
tuality, the black squirrel is
quite common in other places
around the United States.
Guides also go through exer
cises to better understand the
sensitivities and expectations of
the various types of visitors that
come to campus.
Frost explains that "a
prospective student might seek
more detailed information on
undergraduate life so we offer
tours with that detail available,
[while] a tourist can get campus
history, information about the
surrounding area, and an
overview of student life on our
general tour."
According to senior Jackie
fang, the most popular ques
tion for tour guides, especially
from prospective freshmen, is
"flow did you get into Stan
ford?" Each tour guide handles
the question differently.
"Some provide statistics of av
erage SAI' scores, [and | some like

Oval and the front of the Main Quad two years ago. Each year, about
150,000 visitors make their way to campus.
to state that there is not cookie-cut
way of getting into Stanford,"
Tang said. "We like to emphasize
that academics definitely come first
here, but that there are other fac
tors that admissions looks at, such
as extracurriculars."
Tours open to the public are of
fered twice a day at 1 1 a.m. and
3:15 p.m. The basic tour starts at
Memorial Auditorium, visits the
Oval, the Stanford Engineering
Quad, the Main Quad and Memo
rial Church and the libraries, and
ends at White Plaza.
'Hie tours omit walking through
dorms, for security reasons, and
classrooms, because tours take
place during class hours.

The most popular tourist attrac
tions are Hoover lower, with
about 50,000 visitors that go up to
its platform each year, and Memo
rial Church. Tang loves taking vis
itors to Memorial Church because
"it's just beautiful, and I love seeing
people's enjoyment as they walk
around inside."
There are also special golf cart,
residence hall and prospective-un
dergraduate tours that cover dif
ferent areas of campus including
dormitories, Salvatierra Way, the
Red Barn, the Cantor Arts Center
and the athletic facilities.
Junior Dana Mauriello pointed
out that walking backwards, a re
quirement for Stanford tour guides,
can sometimes be challenging.
"We walk backwards. There are
many bollards on campus — they
are very easy to walk into . . .
