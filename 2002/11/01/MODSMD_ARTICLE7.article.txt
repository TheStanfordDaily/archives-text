### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU 
They wear baseball hats, sun
hats and straw hats; they carry
Nikons, disposable cameras and
tripods. Their pocketbooks and
backpacks are stuffed with Stan
lord goodies: fold-up maps with
Marguerite stops highlighted,
Rodin postcards and t-sliirts
emblazoned with the Universi
ty's name.
Each year, approximately
150,000 visitors drive clown Palm
Drive to take a look at the Farm.
I heir reasons for touring are as
varied as their countries and states
of origin.
They come to meet professors,
admire the architecture and scout
out the school on behalf of
teenage family members. While
some stay for days, others remain
just long enough to climb Hoover
Tower, pick up a Jamba Juice
smoothie and hit the road again.
Cinematographer Jack
Nowazynski and surreal artist Jay
Allison drove to Stanford from
Los Angeles just to meet Senior
Lecturer in I listory Katherine jol

"It's so incredible to see such
a mix of intelligent life and
beauty," Allison said. "We're
used to fake beauty. This stuff is
the real McCoy."

Shanghai, China came to see
Stanford because of its stellar aca
demic reputation:
"I'm incredibly honored to be
here," said the' husband, a retired
engineer. "Stanford is one of the
great universities. It's a very big
name back in China. We came to
learn more about its educational
system and compare it to the uni

Aspiring architect William
Bryant rode his motorcycle from
San Francisco to have a look at the
new buildings going up around
campus. He'd visited the school
briefly on one other occasion. A
San Francisco resident originally
from Long Island, Bryant was
amazed to seethe vast open areas:
"I'm used to things being a lot
more crowded back Fast." he said.
"I can't get over how many public
spaces there are that aren't filled.
This place seems really empty."
Bryant didn't follow tin* typical
tourist's agenda during his two
hours at Stanford. He wandered
