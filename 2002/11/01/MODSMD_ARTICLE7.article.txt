### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU 
They wear baseball hats, sun
hats and straw hats; they carry
Nikons, disposable cameras and
tripods. Their pocketbooks and
backpacks are stuffed with Stan
lord goodies: fold-up maps with
Marguerite stops highlighted,
Rodin postcards and t-sliirts
emblazoned with the Universi
ty's name.
Each year, approximately
150,000 visitors drive clown Palm
Drive to take a look at the Farm.
I heir reasons for touring are as
varied as their countries and states
of origin.
They come to meet professors,
admire the architecture and scout
out the school on behalf of
teenage family members. While
some stay for days, others remain
just long enough to climb Hoover
Tower, pick up a Jamba Juice
smoothie and hit the road again.
Cinematographer Jack
Nowazynski and surreal artist Jay
Allison drove to Stanford from
Los Angeles just to meet Senior
Lecturer in I listory Katherine jol
lnck. Neither one of them had
been to Stanford before.
"We read the new book 'Exile
and Identity'on the 1939 deport
ation of Polish c ivilians to the USSR
and were absolutely dying to meet
the author," Allison said. "We

couldn't believe it when Prof. fol
luc k agreed to show us around."
When asked to describe her
first impressions of the University,
Allison went straight to the point:
"I've seen the Oval, the Cantor
Arts Center and Hoover lower,
and all I can say is, 'Wow.'"
"It's so incredible to see such
a mix of intelligent life and
beauty," Allison said. "We're
used to fake beauty. This stuff is
the real McCoy."
An elderly couple from
Shanghai, China came to see
Stanford because of its stellar aca
demic reputation:
"I'm incredibly honored to be
here," said the' husband, a retired
engineer. "Stanford is one of the
great universities. It's a very big
name back in China. We came to
learn more about its educational
system and compare it to the uni
versities back home."
Aspiring architect William
Bryant rode his motorcycle from
San Francisco to have a look at the
new buildings going up around
campus. He'd visited the school
briefly on one other occasion. A
San Francisco resident originally
from Long Island, Bryant was
amazed to seethe vast open areas:
"I'm used to things being a lot
more crowded back Fast." he said.
"I can't get over how many public
spaces there are that aren't filled.
This place seems really empty."
Bryant didn't follow tin* typical
tourist's agenda during his two
hours at Stanford. He wandered
around and studied the school pure
ly from an architectural standpoint.
Dan Murdock, a Massachusetts
native who recently moved to Like
Tahoe, chose Stanford as a spot to
meet up with his friend Eric Ikau
niks. Ikauniks works in I long Kong
and was stopping in California on
his way to the Fast Coast. Both were
shocked at the school's emptiness.
"Where is everybody?" Ikauniks
asked. "Isn't there some Harvard
Square sort of deal around here?
Shouldn't there be people camped
out protesting tiiebombing in Iraq?"
Murdock said he'd done busi
ness with Stanford graduates and
was eager to see the birthplace of the
technological boom.

"I'm also kind of interested in
finding out what you guys had to
do with the technology bust," Mur
dock joked.
A family of four from Salt Lake
City came with their 13-year-old son
for an early college tour. The father
called the campus "spectacular."
"We've just seen Cal and now
here we are at Stanford," t lie mother
said. "I keep telling my son that col
lege is just around the corner, and it's
never too soon to start looking."
Florence La got, an 18-year-old
student from Antibes, France, took
theCaltrain 112 rom San Francisco last
spring to spend a day at Stanford.
Lagot has no plans to come to an
American university; she came to
see a school she'd heard was the
prettiest in the United States.
"I just can't get over this place!"
she exclaimed. "It looks just like a
summer camp!"
