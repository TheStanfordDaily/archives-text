### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Graduate students no longer have to worry
about the woes of writing formal letters or leaving
numerous voicemaU messages if they want to get in
touch with the usually busy top-level officials with
in the University's administration.
If graduate students have questions or con
cerns, they now have die opportunity to talk lace
to-face with University President John I lennessy
and Provost John Etc hemendy over dinner.
The idea of a program to allow graduate stu
dents to eat with the president and provost was first
conceived of by Etchemendy.
"I enjoy talking to students — both graduate
and undergraduate," Etchemendy said. "So in my
first year as provost, I asked Jim Montoya, former
vice provost for student affairs, whether we could

set up regular (linnet's with graduate students."
Etchemendy said iliat he regularly eats in un
dergraduate dorms across campus and wanted to
allow for the same experience at the graduate level.
Christine Griffith, the coordinator of the pro
gram and associate dean of graduate student life,
explained what graduate students can expect
when the president or the provost pays them a din
ner-time visit.
"It's an informal dinner and conversation be
tween the president or provost and graduate stu
dents," Griffith said. "Students express interest via
e-mail to me. A representative of"the Graduate Stu
dent Council and 1 read all the e-mails — we strive
to ensure participation by both women and men
and representation from all seven schools."
Etchemendy also emphasized the informal na
ture of the dinner-time exchanges.
"We have Stanford catering provide a simple
dinner, and we sit around the Buttery — similar to
a dorm lounge — at Rains and talk," Etchemendy
said. "First everyone introduces themselves, and
then the graduate students ask any questions they
want to ask.
"Usually the discussion ranges widely from

graduate student concerns to Stanford finances to
politics and so forth," he continued.
Griffith said that she thinks the dinners will help
connect the Stanford community.
"My hope is that il helps to foster a continuing
dialogue between the president or provost and the
graduate student community," (iriflith said. "1 be
lieve the format contributes to a meaningful con
versation as students identify in advance the topics
they'd like to discuss."
Mark Phillips, a graduate student in materials
science and engineering who has served as a host
for several of the dinners, explained what the
evening with the University officials is like from the
students' perspective.
"The dinners started with brief introductions
from the students explaining which department
they work in and where they live," Phillips said.
"The president and provost spent a while dis
cussing their role in the University. Then the [pres
ident and provost] answered questions as they
arose."
Phillips said that often the questions regarded
