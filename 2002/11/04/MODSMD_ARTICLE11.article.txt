### ERICA SIMMONS 
Approximately HO students met in White
IMa/.a Friday afternoon fora teach-in about
the Free Trade Area of the Americas Agree
ment currently being negotiated in Quito,
Ecuador. The event featured speeches from
three Stanford students, all of 'whom said they
were opposed to the agreement.
The FTAA Agreement aims to lower tariffs,
quotas and other restrictions on trade between
the countries of North and South America. Pro
ponents of the treaty argue that it will reduce
poverty by improving national economies
throughout Latin America, the United States and
Canada. But critics claim that it will Ixniefit most
ly large corporations and will lead to the loss of

jobs for many workers.
While government officials, protected by
thousands of police in riot gear, have been ne
gotiating tlu* agreement inside a luxury hotel in
the Ecuadorian capital, Ecuadorian citi/ens
have marc hed in protest on the streets outside.
The largest protest was on Wednesday, when
police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at about
500 students and workers. Opponents of the
IT AA held related demonstrations in Portland,
Ore. and Montreal on Thursday, the latter
drawing an estimated 10,000.
According to Angad lihalla, a coordinator for
the Stanford Labor Action ('.oalition, the teach-in
at Stanford was an ac t of solidarity with protesters
on both continents. A group of concerned stu
dents, with support from the Stanford l-abor Ac
tion Coalition and M EChA, organized the rally in
response to the events of the previous clays.
"This rally shows that Stanford students are
not apathetic about serious c hanges in the global
system of trade," senior Jonathan Neril said.
Neril spoke first, concentrating on how the

I I AA will ailed international agriculture. Ile
argued that I lit* United Stales' large subsidies
to domestic farmers prevent free trade Iroin
being lair.
"Foreign agricultural producers simply can
not compete when U.S. producers sell their
products lor ;i fraction ol the c<»st of production."
Lolita Roibal, representing MlXihA, linused
011 the IT.Ws consequences l<»r the Hay Area
and the Stanford community.
She said that the I I .VA's greatest local threat is
to "low-wage people of color who lose tlicit jobs
when companies move south to pa\ others even
lower wages."
She also voiced concern about the poten
tial lor countries to lose authority in regulat
ing industry, citing lawsuits that corporations
have filed against environmental laws under
(lhapler I I of the current North Atlantic Iree
Trade Association.
"Anv environmental laws that infringe on
corporations' ability to make
profits are at risk," she said.
Bhalla, the final speaker, reiter
ated the agreement's importance
for the Stanford community.
"We live in what will be the
FTAA," he said. "It's affecting [stu
dents] and will affect the workers
on this campus."
Bhalla encouraged students to
learn about the FTAA and called for
those interested to form a campus
movement to address the issue in
the future.
The speakers all expressed
hope that the teach-in would in
crease campus awareness, de
spite the small number of stu

dents in attendance.
"All we need is a small group of
people to get this going," Roibal
said.
Students in attendance also
felt that members of the Stanford
community should pay more at
tention to free-trade issues.
Senior Malavika Mohanan, a
member of Stanford Students for
Free Trade, said, "I think it's un
fortunate that so few people real
ly know about the FTAA."
Christie Brawner, a senior who
studied in Ecuador for five months
last year, agreed.
"If I hadn't been in South Amer
ica, then I probably wouldn't have
heard about the FTAA or known
what it was," she said. "But it's im
portant to learn about it, because
otherwise you can't participate or
effect any kind of change."
