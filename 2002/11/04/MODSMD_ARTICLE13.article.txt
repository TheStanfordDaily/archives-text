# Group of 12 Stanford students compete in a 199-mile relay
## Racing against the clock 
### ALVIN CHIN 
In the early morning of Oct. 20, junior
Darin Nee woke up to the full moon, ran
three miles uphill fora vertical gain of 1,500
feet, and afterwards climbed into a van, ready
to cheer on the next runner. He and 11 other
Stanford students ran the grueling 199-mile
Providian Relay Race from Calistoga to Santa
Cruz, Calif.
"Not only did we get to run through some
of the most beautiful parts of Northern Cali
fornia, we pushed ourselves to the max and
enjoyed every minute of it . . . Well, almost
every minute," said junior Mike Scraffbrd.
I he annual Providian relay brings more
than 300 teams from all over the country, but
most are from California. The relay passes
through 3(i cities and is divided into 30 legs.
Each runner is tasked for three legs that range
from three to nine miles each and vary in ter
rain and incline.
The runners traveled through Calistoga,
across the Colden Cate Bridge at midnight
under a full moon, through San Francisco and
Silicon Valley to Santa Cruz.
Members of the Stanford team, calling
themselves the "Robber Barons," said thev

found the experience quite intense.
"The 10th leg goes up a steep climb and
then through a ranch, and the fog was so thick
that it made any kind of headlight useless,"
said junior Darcy Dugan.
"Half the time, 1 had no idea where I was
or where I was going. It was pretty surreal,"
she added.
Scraflord said he felt the relay was fatigu
ing, but the team effort helped him get
through the hardest parts.
"1 was really not happy about having to run
a third leg after getting an hour of sleep, but
seeing the rest of the team come in exhausted
after giving their all got me going," he said.
When not running, the participants were
hard at work in the active van managing the
current runner.
l he team was responsible for making sure
the runner was on course, supplying water,
preparing the next runner to go and keeping
accurate leg times.
Meanwhile, the second van had to travel 40
miles to the next van exchange and pick up food.
The runners inside tried to sleep, but time
passed quickly, and over the 24 hours of the
relay, the participants each slept only two hours.
Of the 300-plus teams that participated in

the relay, the Robber Barons finished 13th. In
the coed division, the team placed third.
The Robber Barons' time from start to fin
ish of 23:58:18 makes them one of seven coed
teams in the history of the course to complete
the race in under 24 hours.
All 12 members of the team were familiar
with distance running, including experience
on cross-country or triathlon teams. Several
runners on the team trained at a high altitude
when they spent the summer in an archaeolo
gy program in Peru.
For all the runners, though, practice was
generally a less organized matter, with indi
viduals training on their own or in small
groups of runners.
"YVe had good intentions to train together,
but our busy schedules got in the way," said
junior Ryan Taylor. "However, we trained a
lot individually."
Scraffbrd explained the team's rationale
for participating in what he said he believes is
an arduous relay.
"Running 200 miles in one day isn't for
everyone, but it sounded like a crazy, immod
erate thing to do," he said. "So, as Stanford
students never satisfied with relaxing, we had
to do it!"
