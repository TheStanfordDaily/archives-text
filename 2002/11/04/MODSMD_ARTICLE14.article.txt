## Earthquake shakes Alaskan wilderness 
### 
ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AT) â€”
A major earthquake rocked a
sparsely populated area of interi
or Alaska early yesterday after
noon, triggering an automatic
shutdown of the trans-Alaska oil
pipeline and cracking highways
and roads.
The magnitude 7.9 quake, cen
tered 90 miles south of Fairbanks,
was strongly lelt in Anchorage
about 270 miles to the south. It hit
at 1:13 p.m. Alaska Standard
lime, said Bruce Turner of the
West ('.oast and Alaska Tsunami
Warning (Center.
The state patrol said no injuries
were immediately reported.
"It shook lor a good 30 sec
onds," Turner said. It did not gen
erate a tsunami, he said.
The quake triggered the trans-
Alaska pipeline's automatic detec
tion system, said Mike Heatwole,
Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.
spokesman. Operators then man
ually shut the pipeline clown
shortly after 2 p.m.

I leatwole said helicopters were
Hying the length of the 800-mile
pipeline and ground crews are
physically inspecting lor damage.
None had been detected by late af
ternoon.
The earthquake occurred on
the Denali Fault and had a shallow
depth, said John Tahr, geophysi
cistat the U.S. Geological Survey's
National Earthquake Information
Center in Golden, Colo. Shallow
earthquakes generally are felt
over a wider area.
"We expected this would have
surface rupture that geologists
could see on the ground and
study," he said.
Troopers responded to several
reports of damaged roads in the
area, including a 3-foot crack
opened up in the main road be
tween Fairbanks and Anchorage,
said Lt. Lee Farmer.
"Anybody with one of those
lowriders out of Anchorage prob
ably doesn't want to head that
way," Farmer said.
