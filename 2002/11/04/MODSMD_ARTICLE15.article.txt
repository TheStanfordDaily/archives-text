# Bush supports Coleman
## Minnesota Republican receives presidential backing against Walter Mondale 
### 
ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) â€” President
Bush paid solemn tribute yesterday to Sen.
Paul Wellstone, the Democrat killed last
month in a plane crash, but (ought to derail
Walter Mondale'sbid to succeed Wellstone,
telling Minnesotans that Republican Noun
Coleman is the state's future.
"Believe me when 1 say, we need fresh
air in the United States Senate," Bush said,
an apparent reference to the fact that Mon
dale already served in that body, from
1964-1976. " The future of Minnesota rests
with Norm Coleman."
In an extraordinary departure from his
standard stump speech. Bush opened his
remarks by saying Minnesotans were going
through "a traumatic time" following Well
stone's death.
"After all, just nine days ago, you lost a
principled senator along with his wife and
daughter and five other fellow Americans,"
Bush said. "Paul Wellstone was respected
by all who worked with him, he'll be missed
by all who knew him.
"Now a vote is coming on in the middle

of a state that is mourning," Bush said.
"And even though your stale is still in
mourning, I'm here to remind people 112 rom
all political parties that you have a duty to
vote."
Democrat-turned-Republican (Cole
man, basking in the presence of a presi
dent who has raised millions of dollars lor
him, pledged to thousands of GOP ac
tivists in a sports arena: "Give me your
support, give me the next twodaysofyour
life, and 1 will give you six years of the
kind of leadership that will make you
very, very proud."
Jim Manley, a spokesman for Mondale,
said Bush's salute to Wellstone was "ap
preciated, and they're nice words." But,
lie said, "The irony is that Norm Goleman
ran a campaign of malicious half-truths
trying to malign Wellstone." Mondale's
"experience and record of unparalleled
achievement" makes him the most quali
fied candidate for Wellstone'sjob, Manley
said.
Bush was greeted at the arena by signs
hearing Mondale's nickname, "Fritz."
The White I louse was tightlipped about
its political plans for Minnesota just after
Wellstone died, but officials said yesterday
that Bush intended all along to return to
the state if Goleman thought it would help.
