Stanford may sometimes seem like a self
contained vacuum, but the outcome of this
year's statewide general election will un
doubtedly affect the campus community,
lo help you cast your vote in tomorrow's election,
The Daily's editorial board offers the following en
dorsements of certain contests. For more informa
tion, check out easyvoter.org or calvoter.org.
PROP. 46, HOUSING BOND: YES
One doesn't have to look farther than the
Stanford campus to experience the rising cost
of housing in California, where many workers
struggle to afford homes in the Bay Area. The
median home price in California in Septem
ber cost $323,310, a price tag that fewer than
one-third of Californians can afford. We en
dorse a yes vote on Proposition 46, which
would provide $2.1 billion for affordable
housing for seniors and low-income families,
emergency shelters fos battered women and
shelters with social services for the homeless.
PROP. 47, EDUCATION FACILITIES BOND: YES
Proposition 47 authorizes the sale of slightly
over $13 billion in bonds to pay for large-scale
improvements in California public schools, in
cluding the CSU and UC systems. Such im
provements include building repairs and staff
and faculty salary increases. We endorse a yes
vote on Prop. 47. The proposed benefits of the
bond sales accrue to the public in the form of an
educated workforce able to promote economic
expansion, and hence public financing is ap
propriate. The opponents, the taxpayer advo
cates, have suggested no alternative financing
options and offer largely hackneyed and equiv
ocal arguments to the proposition.
PROP. 48, COURT CONSOLIDATION: YES
Proposition 48 amends the California State
Constitution by deleting all references to mu
nicipal courts. In 1998, Proposition 220 ap
proved the consolidation of superior and mu
nicipal trial courts into unified superior courts.
We endorse a yes vote on Prop. 48 because the
California State Constitution needs to be updat
ed to work in accordance with the approval of
Prop. 220. Further, the institution of Prop. 48
will cost tax payers nothing.
PROP. 49, AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS: NO
Proposition 49 would require the state to
spend up to $550 million each year on before
and after school programs. We endorse a no
vote on Prop. 49 because, in tough budget
times, the spending mandated may result in in

creased budget cuts from other important areas
that impact children like health care, child pro
tection and social services.
PROP. 50, WATER QUALITY: YES
Proposition 50 will devote $3.44 million to
protecting coastal wetlands (marshes), safe
drinking water projects, the CALFED Bay-Delta
Program (which is important for Northern Cali
fornia farmers and residents) and other water
projects. We endorse a yes vote on Prop. 50 be
cause the bond would ensure safe drinking water
supplies to keep up with California's burgeoning
population. Numerous public health and envi
ronmental groups have all endorsed the bond.
PROP. 51, TRANSPORTATION: NO
Proposition 51 would put 30 percent of the
sales tax on motor vehicles (about $910 million
next year) into a new special fund. That money
could be used only on transportation purposes
listed in the proposition, including many specif
ic projects. Most of the money would be spent
on rail and bus transit systems and on highway
and street improvements.
We endorse a yes vote on Prop. 51 because
this measure will reserve nearly $1 billion in tax
money each year for specific purposes — in
cluding 45 "pork barrel projects" — which
could not be changed by the Suite Legislature
even in a budget crisis. Prop. 51 would take
money away from services like children's health
care and Cal Grant college scholarships for
needy students and use it to build projects like a
golf cart path at the Leisure World retirement
community in Orange County and a rail line to
an Indian casino in Palm Springs.
PROP. 52, ELECTION DAY VOTER
REGISTRATION: YES
Proposition 52 would allow all eligible citi
zens to register to vote on the same day as the
election. Opponents argue that the chances
for voter fraud are too large of a risk in Cali
fornia. However, the proposition requires
proof of residence. Further, to combat issues
like voter fraud, the measure creates stiffer
penalties. We endorse a yes vote on Prop. 52
because it increases the opportunity for ev
eryone — including absentminded students
who forgot to register either here or at home
— to participate in democracy.
GOVERNOR: PETER MIGUEL CAMEJO,
GREEN
The governor is the chief executive officer of
California and oversees most state departments

and agencies, appoints judges, approves or re
jects new state laws, presents an annual state
budget to the State Legislature and manages
state resources during emergencies.
In evaluating the two major party candi
dates, Democrat Gray Davis and Republican
Bill Simon, we question the integrity of both
candidates and would not teel comfortable ask
ing either of them to lead California during the
next four years. Camejo, on the other hand,
wants to work hard to fight corruption in Cali
fornia and has a sound platform, which in
cludes a greater use of renewable energy
sources, a fair living wage law and ending racial
profiling by police and the criminal justice sys
tem. Camejo was also the only gubernatorial
candidate who took time out of his campaign
schedule to come speak at Stanford.
SECRETARY OF STATE: KEVIN SHELLEY,
DEMOCRAT
The secretary of state runs statewide elections,
keeps campaign records, issues official docu
ments relating to corporations and trademarks
and runs the state archives. Although all candi
dates for the position agree that California's sys
tem of voting needs reform, most support either
impractical initiatives or offer only vague expla
nations of how they would implement changes.
Democrat Kevin Shelley, the current state assem
bly majority leader, communicates the soundest
platform and is the only candidate with a proven
record of concrete service similar to that required
of the secretary of state. Shelley's experience in
voting reform and corporate and government
accountability, combined with his extensive polit
ical network within California, makes him the
best choice for secretary of suite.
STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL: BILL LOCKYER,
DEMOCRAT
The attorney general is the main law en
forcement officer of California. The position
makes sure that laws are enforced the same way
across the state, runs the California Department
of Justice, serves as a legal adviser to state offi
cials and state agencies and oversees sheriffs,
district attorneys and other law enforcement
agencies.
After evaluating the five candidates running
for this position, we have decided to endorse
Lockyer because of his continued commitment
to work with local law enforcement to expand
the use of DNA technology in the identification
of rapists and murders and his promise to in
vestigate illegal price gouging by Enron and
other energy companies.
Other candidates take political stances that
seem too extreme. American Independent can-

didate Diane Beall Templin's asserts that she
would like to "restore Biblical and Constitutional
principles to law enforcement," and we feel that
might blur the line between church and state.
Further, we feel that Lockyer's platform seems
much more solution-oriented than other candi
dates' platforms.
STATE ASSEMBLY: JOE SIMITIAN, DEMOCRAT
The Suite Assembly member for District 21
represents about 423,400 constituents in the Bay
Area. During his first term in the State Legisla
ture, Simitian, a Palo Alto Democrat, proved
himself as a strong and reliable voice for his con
stituents. Furthermore, we feel that Simitian's
priorities match well with those of the University.
He is devoted to education, at both the primary
and university levels, and has shown a commit
ment to issues facing the Stanford community
through his work on the General Use Permit.
STATE CONTROLLER: STEVE WE STL Y,
DEMOCRAT
The state controller serves as the state's book
keeper. He or she oversees state spending, man
ages money due to California, conducts audits
of state operations and sits on several boards.
Democrat Steve VVestly supports issues like af
fordable housing, the environment and public
education. He has taught at Stanford's Business
School and wants to stop "government waste
and create good, new jobs." His main oppo
nent, a state assemblyman, is too fiscally conser
vative, which could be dangerous for California.
STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC
INSTRUCTION: JACK O'CONNELL
This person acts as the spokesman for educa
tion in California and works to improve it. Jack
O'Connell, an educator with 20 years of experi
ence, is the obvious choice for this position. He
wants to reduce class sizes and recruit more qual
ified teachers. His opponent, Anaheim school
board member Kathy Smith, has proposals that
are vague and not necessary for California right
now: She wants to "teach the Golden Rule" and
bring back "a daily moment of silence."
U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES/ DISTRICT
14: ANNA ESHOO, DEMOCRAT
The race for District 14 of the U.S. House will
decide who will represent the district, including
the Stanford area, in the U.S. House of Repre
sentatives in Washington, D.C.
Anna Eshoo is our clear choice to represent
