# 21 AND STILL CLUELESS
## Remembering race 
### 
It is not without a certain relish, I
think, that the conservative right calls
men like Harry Belafonte "racist." On
Oct. 8, while being interviewed on a
San Diego radio station, Belafonte likened
Colin Powell to a "house slave." He was re
sponding to host Ted Leitner's question on
Bush's policy towards Iraq and whether he
felt that Powell should take a stronger
stance against the possible war. Belafonte

has since repeated his re
marks on the national
stage, most notably on
"Larry King Live," and
extended his criticisms to
Condolezza Rice.
You can almost feel the
flare of their nostrils as
conservative commenta
tors attack Belafonte. They

smell blood. Aha, they think, we no longer
have to hide our white-on-black racism, be
cause now we have black-on-black racism.
Hidden amongst their bad "Banana Boat"
jokes is a dirty little dark pleasure: Finally,
they're not the bad guys anymore.
I sort of understand where it comes
from. White men, and not just the conser
vatives, kind of have the short end of the
stick right now. They have to tiptoe
around political correctness knowing that
if they take one wrong step, they'll be la
beled racists.
They've had to scramble for street cred
ibility by counting up their friends of color.
Even the ones who are genuinely commit
ted to traditionally leftist issues constantly
have to justify themselves; to admit that
their skin color dulls their sensitivity, vet

still they feel our pain.
I almost feel sorry for white men. In a
world where everybody else has color, they
have none. In a world where everybody
else has gender, they have none. I am an
Asian / American-woman-feminist-straight
ally-daughter-friend-lover-writer-citizen of
the world. What are they? White and male.
They think they have no culture (forget
ting rock and roll, forgetting dirty dancing,
forgetting science fiction, forgetting base
ball, forgetting summer nights in classic
cars). They think they have no color (for
getting beige, forgetting bronze, forgetting
pink, forgetting cream, forgetting baby
blue eyes, forgetting cornsilk hair). They
are the norm. They are the unmarked cat
egory. They are invisible.
It must be so bland to live without mem
ory. They've been so blinded by colorblind
ness that they don't even know they exist.
And so, to hide from the shame of having
no heritage (forgetting patriotism, forget
ting the frontier), many white conservatives
condemn history altogether. They say we
exist in a vacuum (forgetting slavery, for
getting a hundred years of oppression).
They say we start afresh from the moment
of our birth (forgetting discrimination, for
getting poverty, forgetting our mothers
and fathers). And so, it's not OK to talk
about race. Race shouldn't be part of civi
lized discourse, they say. They think that
they are colorblind.
Well, I'm going to let you on to some
thing. White is a color, too. And white men
aren't automatically the bad guys. I know,
