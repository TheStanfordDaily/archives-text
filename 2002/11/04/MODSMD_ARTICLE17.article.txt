# 21 AND STILL CLUELESS
## Remembering race 
### 
It is not without a certain relish, I
think, that the conservative right calls
men like Harry Belafonte "racist." On
Oct. 8, while being interviewed on a
San Diego radio station, Belafonte likened
Colin Powell to a "house slave." He was re
sponding to host Ted Leitner's question on
Bush's policy towards Iraq and whether he
felt that Powell should take a stronger
stance against the possible war. Belafonte

has since repeated his re
marks on the national
stage, most notably on
"Larry King Live," and
extended his criticisms to
Condolezza Rice.
You can almost feel the
flare of their nostrils as
conservative commenta
tors attack Belafonte. They

smell blood. Aha, they think, we no longer
have to hide our white-on-black racism, be
cause now we have black-on-black racism.
Hidden amongst their bad "Banana Boat"
jokes is a dirty little dark pleasure: Finally,
they're not the bad guys anymore.
I sort of understand where it comes
from. White men, and not just the conser
vatives, kind of have the short end of the
stick right now. They have to tiptoe
around political correctness knowing that
if they take one wrong step, they'll be la
beled racists.
They've had to scramble for street cred
ibility by counting up their friends of color.
Even the ones who are genuinely commit
ted to traditionally leftist issues constantly
have to justify themselves; to admit that
their skin color dulls their sensitivity, vet

still they feel our pain.
I almost feel sorry for white men. In a
world where everybody else has color, they
have none. In a world where everybody
else has gender, they have none. I am an
Asian / American-woman-feminist-straight
ally-daughter-friend-lover-writer-citizen of
the world. What are they? White and male.
They think they have no culture (forget
ting rock and roll, forgetting dirty dancing,
forgetting science fiction, forgetting base
ball, forgetting summer nights in classic
cars). They think they have no color (for
getting beige, forgetting bronze, forgetting
pink, forgetting cream, forgetting baby
blue eyes, forgetting cornsilk hair). They
are the norm. They are the unmarked cat
egory. They are invisible.
It must be so bland to live without mem
ory. They've been so blinded by colorblind
ness that they don't even know they exist.
And so, to hide from the shame of having
no heritage (forgetting patriotism, forget
ting the frontier), many white conservatives
condemn history altogether. They say we
exist in a vacuum (forgetting slavery, for
getting a hundred years of oppression).
They say we start afresh from the moment
of our birth (forgetting discrimination, for
getting poverty, forgetting our mothers
and fathers). And so, it's not OK to talk
about race. Race shouldn't be part of civi
lized discourse, they say. They think that
they are colorblind.
Well, I'm going to let you on to some
thing. White is a color, too. And white men
aren't automatically the bad guys. I know,


Lillian Ho
sometimes we make you feel that way, and
as a woman of color, 1 apologize. But until
you recognize that race matters, especially
your own, you work for the enemy. You
work for Them. You work for the people
who secretly hate us because we have her
itage, and they don't; who think that we
aren't as good as them but won't say it in the
open. So instead they say that we live in a
world based on "merit."
I think a lot of people of color (non
white) buy in to the colorblindness rhetoric,
too. We want to forget that we look differ
ent, that we are different; that we aren't
white. We want to succeed on the basis of
our merit. So we cringe when we pass the
minority activists being loud and proud,
when all we want to is to live quietly; we get
CommunicAsians in the mail, but we don't
read it; we have never been to El Centro or
the BCSC; we look up to Colin and Condi,
and we say to ourselves, "They made it.
That means we can, too."
But I would ask us to ask ourselves, we

students of color (white included), what are
we forgetting when we pursue merit in
stead of heritage? What have Colin and
Condi forgotten? I'm not saying that every
black leader needs to toe the line of liberal
discontent. What I am saying is that memo
ry can be very instructive.
When Harry Belafonte urges Powell
and Rice to "show some moral backbone,
show some courage, show some commit
ment to principles that are far higher
than those being espoused by their boss,"
he's drawing upon a profound and
deeply powerful idea. I fe's telling them to
look very carefully at what being black
means to them and to see if that squares
with what Bush represents.
Maybe it does and maybe it doesn't. I'll
be the last to say that the conservative right
is inherently racist, or that non-whites can't
be Republicans and still be true to their
color. But don't let anyone tell you that it's
not okay to talk about race.
Some things are best forgotten. Race
isn't one of them.

black leader needs to toe the line of liberal

ry can be very instructive.
When Harry Belafonte urges Powell
and Rice to "show some moral backbone,
show some courage, show some commit
ment to principles that are far higher
than those being espoused by their boss,"
he's drawing upon a profound and
deeply powerful idea. I fe's telling them to
look very carefully at what being black
means to them and to see if that squares
with what Bush represents.
Maybe it does and maybe it doesn't. I'll
be the last to say that the conservative right
is inherently racist, or that non-whites can't
be Republicans and still be true to their
color. But don't let anyone tell you that it's
not okay to talk about race.
Some things are best forgotten. Race
isn't one of them.

It is not without a certain relish, I
think, that the conservative right calls
men like Harry Belafonte "racist." On
Oct. 8, while being interviewed on a
San Diego radio station, Belafonte likened
Colin Powell to a "house slave." He was re
sponding to host Ted Leitner's question on
Bush's policy towards Iraq and whether he
felt that Powell should take a stronger
stance against the possible war. Belafonte

has since repeated his re
marks on the national
stage, most notably on
"Larry King Live," and
extended his criticisms to
Condolezza Rice.
You can almost feel the
flare of their nostrils as
conservative commenta
tors attack Belafonte. They

smell blood. Aha, they think, we no longer
have to hide our white-on-black racism, be
cause now we have black-on-black racism.
Hidden amongst their bad "Banana Boat"
jokes is a dirty little dark pleasure: Finally,
they're not the bad guys anymore.
I sort of understand where it comes
from. White men, and not just the conser
vatives, kind of have the short end of the
stick right now. They have to tiptoe
around political correctness knowing that
if they take one wrong step, they'll be la
beled racists.
They've had to scramble for street cred
ibility by counting up their friends of color.
Even the ones who are genuinely commit
ted to traditionally leftist issues constantly
have to justify themselves; to admit that
their skin color dulls their sensitivity, vet

still they feel our pain.
I almost feel sorry for white men. In a
world where everybody else has color, they
have none. In a world where everybody
else has gender, they have none. I am an
Asian / American-woman-feminist-straight
ally-daughter-friend-lover-writer-citizen of
the world. What are they? White and male.
They think they have no culture (forget
ting rock and roll, forgetting dirty dancing,
forgetting science fiction, forgetting base
ball, forgetting summer nights in classic
cars). They think they have no color (for
getting beige, forgetting bronze, forgetting
pink, forgetting cream, forgetting baby
blue eyes, forgetting cornsilk hair). They
are the norm. They are the unmarked cat
egory. They are invisible.
It must be so bland to live without mem
ory. They've been so blinded by colorblind
ness that they don't even know they exist.
And so, to hide from the shame of having
no heritage (forgetting patriotism, forget
ting the frontier), many white conservatives
condemn history altogether. They say we
exist in a vacuum (forgetting slavery, for
getting a hundred years of oppression).
They say we start afresh from the moment
of our birth (forgetting discrimination, for
getting poverty, forgetting our mothers
and fathers). And so, it's not OK to talk
about race. Race shouldn't be part of civi
lized discourse, they say. They think that
they are colorblind.
Well, I'm going to let you on to some
thing. White is a color, too. And white men
aren't automatically the bad guys. I know,


Lillian Ho
sometimes we make you feel that way, and
as a woman of color, 1 apologize. But until
you recognize that race matters, especially
your own, you work for the enemy. You
work for Them. You work for the people
who secretly hate us because we have her
itage, and they don't; who think that we
aren't as good as them but won't say it in the
open. So instead they say that we live in a
world based on "merit."
I think a lot of people of color (non
white) buy in to the colorblindness rhetoric,
too. We want to forget that we look differ
ent, that we are different; that we aren't
white. We want to succeed on the basis of
our merit. So we cringe when we pass the
minority activists being loud and proud,
when all we want to is to live quietly; we get
CommunicAsians in the mail, but we don't
read it; we have never been to El Centro or
the BCSC; we look up to Colin and Condi,
and we say to ourselves, "They made it.
That means we can, too."
But I would ask us to ask ourselves, we

students of color (white included), what are
we forgetting when we pursue merit in
stead of heritage? What have Colin and
Condi forgotten? I'm not saying that every
black leader needs to toe the line of liberal
discontent. What I am saying is that memo
