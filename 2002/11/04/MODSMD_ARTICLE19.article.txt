'Mossad warned both CIA and FBI' of
possible attacks
In his Oct. 31 letter to the editor,
Mitc hell Smith expresses frustration that
criticism of Israel is labeled anti-Semitic.
True, criticism of Israel is not inherently
anti-Semitic, but when criticism of Israel
contrasts facts and overlooks the crimes of
other countries, then it can become anti-
Semitic. Ironically, Smith's criticism does
precisely that.
Smith suggests that Israel's intelli
gence agency, Mossad, knew beforehand

of the Sept. I 1 attacks, and yet withheld
lite information.
However, this suggestion was directly
refuted over a year ago by the London
Sunday Telegraph. Even if Smith's allega
tions were true, Mossad had a responsibil
ity to Israel and not to America. Singling
out Israel unfairly overlooks America's
own intelligence failures and al-Qaida's
terrorist assaults. More dangerously, criti
cizing Israel denies what Mossad did do to
prevent the attacks.
On Sept. 16, 2001, The Telegraph ran
an article titled "Israeli security issued ur

gent warning to CIA." The article stated
that in August 2001, Mossad warned both
the CIA and the FBI that Osama bin
Laden's "large-scale terrorist attacks on
highly visible targets on the American
mainland were imminent."
The LA. Times substantiated the re
port, riling anonymous U.S. officials who
confirmed that they did receive Mossad's
early warnings. (Sept. 20, 2001, "Officials
fold of' Major Assault' Flans").
Smith laments, "Regardless of the facts,
it is not socially acceptable to discuss
whether Israel was involved (in producing
Sept. 11 attacks]." In light of the facts, no,
it is not acceptable. It is anti-Semitic.

Moore's new movie is 'deeply moving'
On Friday night, I went to go see
Michael Moore's new movie, "Bowling
For Columbine" at the Aquarius Theatre
in I'alo Alto. Several times throughout the
movie 1 was brought to tears and fre
quently laughed out loud. In short, I was
deeply moved by this film, which sheds
new and recycled light on the plight of
gun control in our country and searches
for the driving force behind violent crime.
The Aquarius was packed — not an
open seat in the entire theatre. When the
movie was over and the lights came on, I
looked around to see the other teary-eyed
folks with whom I had shared the surpris

ingly enlightening experience. I was
shocked to realize that 1 was one of the few
young people in attendance.
When 1 think about the issues that
were addressed in this movie, I wished
that more young people had chosen to
spend their Friday night learning at the
same time that they were being enter
tained. Fortunately, movies play several
times per day, so there are many oppor
tunities to partake.
The last few years have been a disturb
ing time in our country and the rest of the
world. There has been more violence and
hatred than 1 have been exposed to previ
ously. As a nation we've seen a dramatic
rise in school shootings, we've been taken
on a ride through Sept. 11 and the after
math, and more recently we have been
shocked by the sniper in Washington D C.
and a possible war in Iraq. I believe that
this film provides a fantastic basis for stu
dent and community discussions about
what we can do to make our world a more
peaceful place. I don't know about you,
but it seems like it would feel much better
to unite on seeking solutions, rather than
being forced together out of fear of stand
ing alone.
