## Oregon exacts revenge with 41-14 win 
### MATT LONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
hUCiKNL, Ore. — Fhe Oregon Ducks had
lost two straight at their usually impenetrable
lord ess of Ant/.en Stadium. They quickly made
sure it wasn't three Saturday, as the Ducks flew
by Stanford in the first quarter on their way to
a 41-14 vic tory that felt like pure revenge for
the Cardinal's Rose Bowl-spoiling win at
Autzen last season.

Football
Saturday: No. 19 Oregon 41, Stanford 1A

The No. 19 Ducks (7-2, 3-2 Pacific-10 Con
ference) reached (he end zone on their first
four offensive possessions, and Stanford (2-0,
1-3) did everything wrong on both sides of the
ball in the game's opening period, amassing
minus-15 yards in total offense while allowing
Oregon to have its way with its defense.
The blowout continues what lias been a 112 rus
trating season fora Stanford squad that began
with hopes of Offensive glory under new head
coach Buddy Teevens, who came from Florida
preaching the "fun 'n' gun" offense. It finalizes
what was already inevitable, that the Cardinal
will not go to a bowl game or have a winning
season.
"We were struggling all season, and today
was just a microcosm of that," junior wide re
ceiver Luke Powell said.
At no time were Powell's sentiments more
evident than the lirst quarter, when all of Stan
ford's shortcomings burst to the surface.
First came defensive breakdowns. The Car
dinal gave up 101 yards rushing in the first
quarter, including 70 to'lerrence Whitehead,
who was starting his first collegiate game in
place of injured star Onterrio Smith. The true
freshman played a great game, but against
Stanford's horrific run defense, it looked like
writer / director Kevin Smith could have
amassed as much as Whitehead's 132 yards.
Next came mental mistakes. After Oregon
drove 04 yards to the Cardinal 6-yard line off
the opening kickoff, Stanford's red zone de
fense clamped down and stopped Whitehead
short of the goal line to bring up a fourth down.
But Stanford redshirt freshman Michael
Craven hit Whitehead long alter the play was

whistled dead, drawing a personal foul and
handing the Ducks seven points instead of
three.
Then there were special teams mishaps,
too. In a play that duplicated several others
this season, junior center Drew Caylor gave
punter Frit johnson an errant snap that
rolled 32 yards to the Stanford 3-yard line.
Oregon quarterback Jason File scored two
plays later, and ()regon's victory was secured
with a four-tou< hdown lead just 15 minutes
into the contest.
Most importantly, offensive ineptitude left
Stanford helpless to launch a comeback. The
Cardinal did not earn a lirst down until well
into the second quarter and finished the game
with only 173 yards in total offense — including

just 92 yards in the air. In the game's key open
ing minutes, receivers Powell and sophomore
Teyo Johnson dropped third-down passes.
With the game virtually decided in the first
hall, all Stanford could do was focus on im
provement and preventing the score from
reaching embarrassing heights.
"We wanted to try and just disregard the
scoreboard and play like we know we can play,"
said redshirt freshman quarterback Kyle Mat
ter, who started his second straight game in
place of the injured Chris Lewis.
Matter managed only 71 yards on 9-for-I9
passing, which brings his two week total to 1-40
yards.

Sophomore cornerbacks Stanley Wilson and Leigh Torrence bring down an Oregon receiver during
Saturday's 41-14 blowout loss. The loss dropped Stanford's record to 2-6.
Stanford's situation went from
bad to worse in its opening drive
of the second half. Though the
10-minute scoring drive ended
in a 2-yard touchdown pass to
Johnson — making the score 38-
14 — the Cardinal lost Matter
early in the drive with an injury
to his right forearm. Matter left
the game after suffering a sack
and did not return, though x
rays were negative.
In his place, Ryan Eklund en
tered the game. The seldom-used
sophomore did throw for the
meaningless touchdown, but fin
ished 3-for-9 with 21 yards and an
interception.
Fortunately for the Cardinal,
Matter's injury is not expected to
hold him out of practice.
The Ducks seemed set on
reestablishing themselves after
consecutive losses that likely ended
their hopes fora conference
crown, and relished the chance to
play the vulnerable Cardinal. They
showed no signs of giving Stanford
any room to breathe, as coach Mike
Rellotti mercilessly called for an
onsides kick even after taking a 28-
point lead.

"It was a great effort in the first
half, a workman-like effort in the
second," Bellotti said. "It's much
more fun to sit here and talk about
this after a win, making ourselves
bowl eligible and ensuring a win
ning season."
Meanwhile, Stanford's only
goal for the remainder of the sea
son is to beat either Southern Cal
ifornia, Oregon State or California
to earn three wins and avoid fin
ishing with its worst record since
1983's one-win squad.
