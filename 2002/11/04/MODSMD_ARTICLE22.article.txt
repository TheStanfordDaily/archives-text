Women's Soccer
Saturday: No. 1 Stanford 2, California 1

Alter Saturday's 2-1 victory in Berkeley, the
Cardinal's magic number is just one.
I he game started off with a ferocious attack
by the Golden Bears, one that resulted in a
score lot the home team just two minutes into
the contest. Gal's Brittany Kirk took control of
a loose ball and lobbed it in over the Cardinal
back line to senior striker Laura Schott, who
was able to direct the ball just between Stan
ford's keeper and the post.
"We pinpointed Laura Schott as a danger
ous player before the game," Stanli>rd co-coach
Paul Sapsfbrd said. "We talked about how to

prevent her from getting in behind us, but she
got in behind us, and she scored."
It was the first goal allowed by the Cardinal
in conference pla) this season and just the
fourth goal allowed all year.
(Cal kept up the pressure early in the first hall
with speed on the wings and good runs from
Schott and Ireslunan striker Tracey llamm,
who had a lew chances but was stopped by red
shirt sophomore keeper Nicole Barnhart.

with organized attacks of"its own.

a blind shot at the near post," Wal
lis said.
After the game, VVallis spoke of
the importance of getting that first
goal after falling behind for only
the second time this season.
"It was a position we hadn't
really been in," VVallis said. "We
had to make sure to stay com
posed. We wanted to keep fight
ing, and we wanted to put them
under pressure. And as soon as
we could, we wanted to get a
quick goal back and settle down

a little bit."
The team was able to settle
clown a little more just 10 minutes
later when Wallis notched her sec -
ond goal of the afternoon with a
tremendous individual effort.
After taking a pass in open
space from freshman striker Jen
nifer Farenbaugh, Wallis fired a
shot at the keeper only to see ii de
flected away. Her second try de
flected off a Cal defender, while
the third and final shot found the
back of the net.
"Jenny hit an amazing ball, and
I tried to place it around the keep
er but she got a hand on it," Wallis
said. "Then I tried to place it
around the defender, but hit the

defender. Finally she was out of
the play too, and I had an open
goal and hit it."
Wallis credited the actions of
one of her teammates for the
tremendous amount of space she
had, for the goal.
"Marcie [Ward] made a great
run across the field and dragged
two defenders with her which
opened up the hole for me," Wal
lis said.
It was an observation that was
echoed by Cal's head coach, Kevin
Boyd.
"All three of their forwards
(Carlson, Ward and Wallis) made
dangerous, fast diagonal runs
through the seams in our de

fense," Boyd said. "We weren't
picking them up very well. That's
what decided the game in the first
half."
With little action after halftime,
the game was decided by the end
of the first period. Both defenses
picked up their play and allowed
very few opportunities in the sec
ond half.
"It wasn't a very pretty game,"
Sapsford said. "It was a battle. It's
always good to go to an away
venue and get a result â€” a good
result."
l he Cardinal will look for good
results at home this weekend when
it hosts Arizona and Arizona State
in its last Pac-10 matches.
