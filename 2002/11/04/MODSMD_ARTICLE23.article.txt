EUGENE, Ore. â€”The Stan
ford football team came up short
at Autzen Stadium on Saturday
against No. 19 Oregon, suffer
ing another blowout loss. Yet,
when the Cardinal returns
home this weekend to face
Southern California,* it just
might miss the Ducks' home
field.
"It was a very impressive at
mosphere," head coach Buddy
Teevens said of his first game at
Autzen Stadium. "I told our
players, ' This is what college
football is all about.' "
Oregon remodeled its 40-
year-old stadium this offseason,
sprucing things up and adding
extra seating and luxury boxes.
The stadium, which has always
been renowned for its noisiness,
now packs over 50,000 fans into
an atmosphere than remains in
timate and, well, loud.
Teevens commented that "it
kind of took me back a little bit,"
referring to his days as an assis
tant coach in the football-crazed
SEC. "They're all kind of loud,
wild and so forth."
The Cardinal players also ex
pressed their affinity for the set
ting, even in defeat.
"The crowd, the noise, I feel
like that's an exciting environ
ment to play in," sophomore
safety Oshiomogho Atogwe
said.
Part of what makes Autzen
such a special place to play is its
old-school design. The stands
are practically on top of the
field, and bleacher seats rise up
in a single-bowl design that re

seinbles classic edifices like
Notre Dame Sladiuin.
"The venue itself, just the
structure, everything is focused
down on tlie field," Teevens
said. "I just really like the layout,
the fact that it's so close."
The stands at Autzen are only
20 yards or so removed from the
boundaries of the playing field,
something that stands in stark
contrast to Stanford Stadium.
There is no track that circles the
edge of the sidelines and most
certainly no chain-link fences
between the fans and the action.
Nor, for that matter, in a
54,000 seat structure that sells
out every weekend, are there
any dirty tarps covering an ex
panse of unfilled seats in the
end zone. In fact, the Ducks
oversold their capacity by
packing 56,4' Hi fans in to see
Saturday's game.
"That's what you dream of as
a football player," Atogwe said.
"A loud crowd, a packed house,
yon just want to play your best."
One of (he advantages of a
tightly packed c apacity crowd is
the obstacle it poses for the other
team. In practice last week,
Stanford spent time preparing
for the crowd noise that they
would face in Oregon.
"It's a real hostile environ
ment to come into," redshirt
freshman quarterback Kyle
Matter said. "When they get
up on you like they did, it's a
real hard place to make a
comeback in."
Teevens added, "The guys
on tlie sidelines are screaming
and yelling, [and] there are
