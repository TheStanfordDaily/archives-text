Men's Soccer
Friday: No. 9 Stanford 0, No. 8 California 0

Friday's ()-() result between the No.
9 Cardinal (11-3-2, 2-2-2 Pacific-10
Conference) and archrival No. 8 Cali
fornia (1 I -3-2, 4-1 -1) proved to be yet
another disappointing offensive show
ing for Stanford.
"It was a great college game," said
Stanford coach Bret Simon. "Cal
played great and we played great too.
However, I don't know who's got the
voodoo doll and is stabbing us in the

foot, keeping us from scoring goals.
We're not scoring, but I think we're
playing well enough to score goals, but
it's just not happening right now."
After scoring 32 goals in its first 12
games en route to a great 11-1 start,
the men's soccer squad has lately been
struggling to put the ball into the back
of the net.
Over the past few weeks, both se
nior defender Todd Dunivant and se
nior forward Roger Levesque, two key
offensive playmakers for the Cardinal,
had been in and out of training
nursing injuries. Both returned to
the lineup on Friday in good
health status for the first time in a
month.
Their effect on Stanford's play
was evident as the Cardinal was
able to generate some golden scor
ing opportunities.
Stanford began the game with
clear control of ball movement on
the field, leading to several early
shots, including one by Dunivant
that clanged off the post in the
sixth minute.
There was no doubt that Stan
ford wanted to break out of its
slump badly as the Cardinal won
most eve 17 50-50 ball. The Stan
ford defense did an exceptional
job shutting the Cal offense down,
limiting the Golden Bears to one
shot in the first half.
Stanford almost lost control of
the game in the second half,
though, as Cal's offense was able to
wake up from its slumber and pro
duce six shots, including a few near
the end of the second half that had
the home crowd breathing large
sighs of relief as the shots just
missed the Cardinal's net.
In the first 10-minute overtime,
Stanford was able to regain control
and found itself with its best
chance of the entire game when
forward Roger Levesque was
taken down just outside of the
penalty box.
Dunivant, who played as a mid
fielder at times, took a well-placed
left-footed shot and curled it around
the wall of defenders well enough to
bring the fans to their feet.
Cal goalkeeper Josh Saunders

had other plans as he made the
save of the game, one of five for
him on the night, knocking the ball
out of trouble with his out
stretched arms.
"I don't think there are too
many goalkeepers in the country
like Josh," Cal coach Kevin Grimes
said. "If he's not the best goalkeep
er in the country, somebody has
got to tell me who is. It's great to
have him on our side; he's been
solid as a rock, he earned another
shutout tonight; he was Man of the
Match for sure."
In the second overtime, Stan

ford had another quality opportu
nity as 6-foot-4 defender Taylor
Graham was able to leap over the
Cal defense fora header, but
knocked it just over the goal, lead
ing to the clean sheet on both sides
to end the match.
Despite continuing one of its
longest winless streaks in recent
memory, Stanford is still in fairly
good shape in the conference
standings.
With No. 2 UCLA's 2-1 upset
home loss to unranked Washing
ton, the Cardinal is in third place
with eight points, behind Cal's

leading 13 points and the Bruins'
second-place 10 points. But Stan
ford will not be able to climb back
to the top of the conference on its
own.
"We'll obviously need some
help," Simon said, assessing his
team's chances for winning the
Pac-10. "We played well enough
tonight to win any of the games in
the Pac-10. All the teams are close,
so it's hard to tell. I think any of the
teams are capable of beating each
other. Tonight was the first game
in which we've had a team close to
full health on the field."
