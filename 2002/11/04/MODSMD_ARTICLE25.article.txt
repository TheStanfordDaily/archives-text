# Won & Co. look for strong fall finish

### ZACH JONES STAFF WRITER 
To the casual observer, it
probably comes as a sur
prise. Ron Won's play this
year for the Stanford men's
golf team has been the epit
ome of consistency, and yet
you might not have seen it
coming.

Looking at Won's statis
tics from a year ago, one
might have overlooked him
coming into this season. Par
ticipating it) eight of 12
events for the year, Won
recorded only one top-25
finish. Although he played
well throughout the season,
the Irvine, Calif., native was
overshadowed by current
seniors |im Seki and All-
American IMiilip Rowe.
This year has been a com
pletely different story. In his
senior season, Won has
been one of the most steady
players on the team, notch
ing (bur top-15 finishes in as
many tournaments. His
stroke average of 72.0 is sec -
ond only to Seki and is over
two shots better than his
own mark from a year ago.

Think it's a surprise? If
preparation leads to suc
cess, Won's solid play won't
end anytime soon. In some
ways, he's been preparing
for half of his lifetime.
Competitive golf was a way
of life by age 12.
"I played a lot of [South
ern California PCA] tourna
ments," Won said. "I started
winning some of those and
gaining confidence."
He won so many that he
was honored as the SCPCA
Player of the Year in 1994.
And then again in 1995 and
1997.
Even now, Won attribut
es much of his current suc
cess to his junior golf days.
"I think a lot of it has to
do with experience," Won
said. "I played a ton of
[American Junior Coif Asso
ciation | tournaments. 1 trav
eled all over the place, and,
as a result, I know what it's
like to be at tournaments."
Still think his play is a sur
prise? As a senior in high
school, Won shot a 00 at the
1999 CIF/SCCA State
Championship to break
Tiger Woods' record at the
event by one stroke.

goals oriented toward the team.
"Personally I hope 1 can continue
to contribute to the team as much
as possible," Won said.
This week, the Cardinal will
need Won's contributions as it
tries to finish up the fall season on
a positive note at the Prestige at
PGA West. The 54-hole event will
take place at the La Quinta Moun
tain Golf Resort in La Quinta,
Calif., today and tomorrow.
"Last year's event was a huge
success, and we have a great field
returning this year," head coach
Jeff Mitchell said. "This year's
tournament represents the very
best in college golf and in academ
ic excellence. It is a great showcase
event about everything college
sports are about."
When it travels to Southern
California, Stanford will have to
contend with several teams
ranked in the nation's top 25.
Highlighting the competition will
be No. (i Texas Christian and No.
9 UCLA.
In addition, No. 21 Washing
ton will try to defend its title from
last year's Prestige. Playing all
three rounds under par, the
Huskies carded an 844 for the
event, edging Colorado and
Kansas by five strokes.
In the individual competition,
Vanderbilt's Brandt Snedekei will
look to make a run at the title. The
senior from Nashville is possibly
the country's hottest golfer at the
moment. Ranked second national
ly by Golfweek, Snedeker has won

each of his last three events, in
cluding his most recent victory at
the (iOca-(lola 1 ennessee I ourna
ment of Champions.
In the final event before the
winter offseason, Mitchell will rely
on a veteran lineup made up of
four seniors and a freshman. Seki
leads the way and will look to con
dude the fall with a strong show
ing in La Quinta. Seki is ranked
10th in the nation, and he is com
ing off a sixth-place finish at last
week's Nelson Invitational.
Senior Del de VVindt will also
head soul 11 with (he Cardinal this
week. De Windt will look to build
on a 1-under-par final round last
week. Freshman Kyle Gentry will
play in his third collegiate event
after carding a season-low round
of 7:5 last weekend. Rounding out
the Cardinal squad is senior
George Downing. Though Down
ing did not compete as part of the
team last week, his individual total
of 220 tied him for 37th place, just
a stroke back of De Windt.
After (he Prestige, the Cardinal
will take some time off to regroup
and prepare for the spring tour
nament season.
Although Stanford has strug
gled a hit in the early going, histo
ry is on the side of the Cardinal.
Despite tough showings during
the middle of last season, the team
performed well down the stretch,
notching consecutive second
place finishes at the U.S. Intercol
legiate and Pacific-10 Champi
onships.
"It seems like we've always had
a little bit of a rough start," Won
said. "But we've come through at

know we can do."

goals oriented toward the team.
"Personally I hope 1 can continue
to contribute to the team as much
as possible," Won said.
This week, the Cardinal will
need Won's contributions as it
tries to finish up the fall season on
a positive note at the Prestige at
PGA West. The 54-hole event will
take place at the La Quinta Moun
tain Golf Resort in La Quinta,
Calif., today and tomorrow.
"Last year's event was a huge
success, and we have a great field
returning this year," head coach
Jeff Mitchell said. "This year's
tournament represents the very
best in college golf and in academ
ic excellence. It is a great showcase
event about everything college
sports are about."
When it travels to Southern
California, Stanford will have to
contend with several teams
ranked in the nation's top 25.
Highlighting the competition will
be No. (i Texas Christian and No.
9 UCLA.
In addition, No. 21 Washing
ton will try to defend its title from
last year's Prestige. Playing all
three rounds under par, the
Huskies carded an 844 for the
event, edging Colorado and
Kansas by five strokes.
In the individual competition,
Vanderbilt's Brandt Snedekei will
look to make a run at the title. The
senior from Nashville is possibly
the country's hottest golfer at the
moment. Ranked second national
ly by Golfweek, Snedeker has won

each of his last three events, in
cluding his most recent victory at
the (iOca-(lola 1 ennessee I ourna
ment of Champions.
In the final event before the
winter offseason, Mitchell will rely
on a veteran lineup made up of
four seniors and a freshman. Seki
leads the way and will look to con
dude the fall with a strong show
ing in La Quinta. Seki is ranked
10th in the nation, and he is com
ing off a sixth-place finish at last
week's Nelson Invitational.
Senior Del de VVindt will also
head soul 11 with (he Cardinal this
week. De Windt will look to build
on a 1-under-par final round last
week. Freshman Kyle Gentry will
play in his third collegiate event
after carding a season-low round
of 7:5 last weekend. Rounding out
the Cardinal squad is senior
George Downing. Though Down
ing did not compete as part of the
team last week, his individual total
of 220 tied him for 37th place, just
a stroke back of De Windt.
After (he Prestige, the Cardinal
will take some time off to regroup
and prepare for the spring tour
nament season.
Although Stanford has strug
gled a hit in the early going, histo
ry is on the side of the Cardinal.
Despite tough showings during
the middle of last season, the team
performed well down the stretch,
notching consecutive second
place finishes at the U.S. Intercol
legiate and Pacific-10 Champi
onships.
"It seems like we've always had
a little bit of a rough start," Won
said. "But we've come through at
the end, and it's something that we
know we can do."
To the casual observer, it
probably comes as a sur
prise. Ron Won's play this
year for the Stanford men's
golf team has been the epit
ome of consistency, and yet
you might not have seen it
coming.

Looking at Won's statis
tics from a year ago, one
might have overlooked him
coming into this season. Par
ticipating it) eight of 12
events for the year, Won
recorded only one top-25
finish. Although he played
well throughout the season,
the Irvine, Calif., native was
overshadowed by current
seniors |im Seki and All-
American IMiilip Rowe.
This year has been a com
pletely different story. In his
senior season, Won has
been one of the most steady
players on the team, notch
ing (bur top-15 finishes in as
many tournaments. His
stroke average of 72.0 is sec -
ond only to Seki and is over
two shots better than his
own mark from a year ago.

Think it's a surprise? If
preparation leads to suc
cess, Won's solid play won't
end anytime soon. In some
ways, he's been preparing
for half of his lifetime.
Competitive golf was a way
of life by age 12.
"I played a lot of [South
ern California PCA] tourna
ments," Won said. "I started
winning some of those and
gaining confidence."
He won so many that he
was honored as the SCPCA
Player of the Year in 1994.
And then again in 1995 and
1997.
Even now, Won attribut
es much of his current suc
cess to his junior golf days.
"I think a lot of it has to
do with experience," Won
said. "I played a ton of
