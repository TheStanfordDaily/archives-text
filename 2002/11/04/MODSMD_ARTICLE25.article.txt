### ZACH JONES STAFF WRITER 
To the casual observer, it
probably comes as a sur
prise. Ron Won's play this
year for the Stanford men's
golf team has been the epit
ome of consistency, and yet
you might not have seen it
coming.

today and tomorrow

Looking at Won's statis
tics from a year ago, one
might have overlooked him
coming into this season. Par
ticipating it) eight of 12
events for the year, Won
recorded only one top-25
finish. Although he played
well throughout the season,
the Irvine, Calif., native was
overshadowed by current
seniors |im Seki and All-
American IMiilip Rowe.
This year has been a com
pletely different story. In his
senior season, Won has
been one of the most steady
players on the team, notch
ing (bur top-15 finishes in as
many tournaments. His
stroke average of 72.0 is sec -
ond only to Seki and is over
two shots better than his
own mark from a year ago.

Think it's a surprise? If
preparation leads to suc
cess, Won's solid play won't
end anytime soon. In some
ways, he's been preparing
for half of his lifetime.
Competitive golf was a way
of life by age 12.
"I played a lot of [South
ern California PCA] tourna
ments," Won said. "I started
winning some of those and
gaining confidence."
He won so many that he
was honored as the SCPCA
Player of the Year in 1994.
And then again in 1995 and
1997.
Even now, Won attribut
es much of his current suc
cess to his junior golf days.
"I think a lot of it has to
do with experience," Won
said. "I played a ton of
[American Junior Coif Asso
ciation | tournaments. 1 trav
eled all over the place, and,
as a result, I know what it's
like to be at tournaments."
Still think his play is a sur
prise? As a senior in high
school, Won shot a 00 at the
1999 CIF/SCCA State
Championship to break
Tiger Woods' record at the
event by one stroke.
Kven with all this success,
Won continues to keep his
