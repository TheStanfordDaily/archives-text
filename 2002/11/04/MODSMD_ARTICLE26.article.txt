Saturday: California 2, Stanford 1

On Saturday, Fedderson
scored in sudden-death overtime
at iS():'JO, clinching sole possession
of the NorPac title for the Colden
Bears.
The Cardinal walked into Sat
urday's contest one game behind
the Bears with one game to play.
A win would have meant dual
possession of the season title with
Cal and a possible number one
seed in the upcoming NorPac:
tournament.
However, in a scene reminis
cent of last season, the Golden
Bears won the last conference
game to stun the Cardinal and
take t he title.
"I thought we played awe
some today," Stanford coach Sh
eryl Johnson said. "We had our
chances to put some balls in. It's
just a matter of time before those
shots are going to start falling.
It's time for us to put some wins
on the board in the NorPac
Tournament and get back to the
NCAAs."
Saturday's game was the last
regular season game for Johnson,
who will be retiring at the end of
I his year to pursue a career in pri
vate investigation. She was hon
ored in a pregame ceremony that
recognized her IS years of head

coaching on the Farm.
Joining in the pregame cere
monies were the six Stanford se
niors, also playing their last regu
lar season game.
But it was Cal that was riding
high on emotions early in the
game when just before halftime,
Cal's Pooja Mehta shot the ball to
the back of the net at 1.
Stanford came back in the sec
ond half, when senior offensive
standout Amanda Bilhnyer scored
on an assist by Lindsay Frickson at
()M:34. With the goal, Billmyer fin
ished the regular season as the

team points leader with 19 and the
team goals leader with nine. I he
marks are both career highs for
her as well.
With the goal, the game was sent
to sudden-death overtime, which is
when Fedderson struck. Taking a
ball in front of the net, Fedderson
struck a soft shot that tolled to
Mehta, who swung and missed the
ball. The unintended lake juked
Stanford goalkeeper Ana
Kralovec, who could only watch
the ball ( toss the goal line.
"It was a very physical game,
and I was really proud of how our

team stayed strong and fought
until the end," Billmyer said.
With the loss, Stanford will be
the No. l 2 seed in the Western Divi
sion of the NorPac tournament
and will play Davidson (7-12) this
Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in the Nor-
Pac playoffs. Stanford will play host
to the eight-team tournament.
"We're really prepared going
into the NorPac Championships,"
Billmyer said. "1 don't think that
this loss is going to deter our team
at all in our quest for the tourna
ment title. Our team is just going
to want it more now."
