# Eshoo likely to win 14th
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Democrat Anna Eshoo has rep
resented Stanford and the rest of
the 14th Congressional District in
the U.S. House of Representatives
for 10 years. On Tuesday she is
once again up for re-election. As
an incumbent in a predominantly
Democratic district, even her op
ponents admit that her seat seams
relatively safe. She has raised 14
times the amount of money her
leading opponent has and sits in a
district which is 4(5 percent Demo
crat and 30 percent Republicans
by registration.
Her Republican opponent, Joe
Nixon, a first-time candidate, ad
mits that the scales are not in his
favor, but he says, "Stranger
things have happened."
Eshoo addresses student apathy
The two candidates visited

Stanford last night in a forum
sponsored by the ASSU's "Get
Out The Vote 2002" campaign
that drew about 25 students.
Eshoo, the prime draw for the
forum, spoke on student apathy
and the issues she thought stu
dents should care about.
"The 10,000-pound gorilla
in the room is that fewer people
are participating," she said.
"You need to know what we do
[in Congress] and what it means
to you."
Eshoo credited Stanford's get
out-the-vote efforts for helping

her get elected 10 years ago. I'he
issues today are more pressing
than ever, she noted.
"Every person in this country
is needed to be engaged in this,"
she said.
Nixon spoke more specifically
about the issues in his campaign,
from the economy to fiscal waste.
"The job market is deterio
rating," he said. "If you are
troubled by corporate account
ability, you would be surprised
how little accountability there is

in tlu* federal government."
In between the two candidates'
presentations, Margot Harrigan, a
Los Altos school board member,
gave a speech in favor of Proposi
tion 17, a school improvement
bond measure.
Student visas, the living wage
and airport security screeners came
up during the question and answer
section of the forum.
Kshoo explained her support for
streamlined international student
visas and her disagreement with
Senator Dianne Feinstein over a
student-visa moratorium Feinstein
proposed.
Nixon explained his economic
opposition to a living wage on the
basis that it hurts the poorest work
ers who are left unemployed.
In an attempt to elicit applause
from the sparse crowd, Eshoo
asked, "How does John Ashcroft
come into being?" She explained,
"1 believe he is going against civil
liberties day in and day out."
"Kvery time I cast a vote, I think
about the future. You are the fu
ture," Eshoo concluded.
Nixon finished with a plea for
individual responsibility.
"Individual responsibility is
what Republicans are all about
and that's what Silicon Valley
technology can support," lie said.
Candidates explain their
platforms
l lie two candidates said they
have different views of what the im
portant issues are for Silicon Valley
and Stanford voters. Nixon said he
sees the issues in the race as nar
rowly defined around the war on
terrorism, specifically around
Fshoo's votes against spending for
military hardware and against giv
ing President Bush authorization to
use force in Iraq.
"Voting for the [Democratic
sponsored] Spratt Amendment [re
quiring U.N. approval for military
action] shows Eshoo hasn't got a clue
how to negotiate," Nixon said. "I'm
against war with Iraq, too. But the
reason you have military strength is
so you don't have to use it."
Eshoo, in an Oct. 17 League of

Women Voters debate, highlighted
the economy, prescription-drug
benefits and the environment as
three of her most important issues.
"I am proud to stand before the
people of this district," she said in a
recent interview.
Eshoo said she is proud of writ
ing bills that presidents from both
parties have signed in support of
high technology, helping underin
sured and uninsured women and
helping with pediatric drug cover
age. She has worked on many ini
tiatives, "from the environment, to
health care, to biotechnology, all di
rected to the betterment of people's
lives," she said.
Eshoo said her most important
recent vote in Congress was against
giving President Bush authoriza
tion to use force in Iraq.
"We need to win the war on ter
rorism," she said. "It has everything
to do with your future and young
people. This is a war not only for
our country, but for democracy.
"We must cooperate with coun
tries around the world to break up
al-Qaida cells. This is one of the rea
sons I voted against [the President's
war resolution]. The resolution em
phasizes preemption over deter
rence and unilateralism over multi
lateralism. It will get directly in the
way of our war on terror."
Nixon wants to make a cam
paign issue out of Eshoo's vote
against the war, military spending
and the proposed Department of
Homeland Security.
"Eshoo has been totally catatonic
on national security," he said.
According to Nixon, a vote for
him sends a message to Washing
ton that the people of Silicon Val
ley fully support President Bush's
war on terrorism.
Andrew Carver, the Libertarian
candidate for the 14th Congres
sional District and a doctoral stu
dent in economics at Stanford, has a
different perception. He wants to
frame the election not for or against
war, but as a broader question on
the role of government.
" I think a lot of people are social
ly liberal and fiscally conservative,"
he said. "There's a marketing prob
lem on behalf of the Republican
Party with too much baggage 112 rom
the religious right."
Carver also sees war as a non
issue in this district. He considers

(lie Republican l'arty as too eager to
go to war with Iraq. "That [terror
ists are waging war against democ
racy] is propaganda thrown out by
the president," he said. "The idea
that [Sept. 11] is an attack on free
dom. that's silly."
Race not hotly contested
The house race in the 14th dis
trict has sparked little debate.
"It's really not a race many peo
ple care about," Carver said, "be
cause Anna Kshoo wins with about
70 percent of the vote each year."
But Nixon maintains hope,
handing out campaign literature
and shaking audience members'
hands.
"Winning is not impossible,"
Nixon said. "People in this dis
trict are listening."
Still, Nixon acknowledged that
he is at a disadvantage. 1 le decided
to run because no one has chal
lenged Kshoo on the issue of mili
tary hardware expenditures.
"Which would you rather do,"
he asked, "go to Afghanistan
swimming or with aircraft-carrier
battlegroups?"
Media coverage for the race has
been slim. "The Palo Alto Daily
News has barely covered it," said
Carver, who noticed just how hard
it was to get his message out.
The Silicon Valley-Washington
connection
Both major candidates agree on
certain issues. Both are pro-choice
and support stem-cell research.
And both of their platforms use Sil
icon Valley technology to improve
the world and the local economy at
the same time.
Eshoo emphasized her support
lor bills that connect Silicon Valley
to the rest of the nation. She has
worked on bills on Internet privacy,
tax cuts for research and develop
ment and broadband tax incentives.
In last night's forum, she called
fora doubling in the budget for
basic research.
"We are a better people as a re
sult of doubling the National Insti
tutes of Health budget, and we
need to do the same with basic re
search," she said.
Eshoo serves on the House En
ergy and Commerce Committee
and the Subcommittee on
Telecom m u nications, a mo n g

others. Her position on these
committees allows her to influ
ence legislation that directly re
lates to her home district, as she
noted it is extremely hard to in
troduce legislation in committees
on which she does not sit.
Nixon said he sees slightly
more unconventional ways to
apply Silicon Valley technology
to the war on terrorism, defend
ing the country and helping the
local economy at the same time.
He said he considers the dan
ger of nuclear materials on cargo
ships pressing.
"We need to have systems
where [cargo ships] are scanned
at the port of origin," he said.
"This is a huge vulnerability, and
it's going to require a huge
amount of technology. It could be
a source of recovery [for Silicon
Valley], especially if the con
gressperson was aware of it."
Nixon also sees a potential rev
olution in congressional elec
tions. At the Oct. 17 debate, he
challenged Eshoo to a five-hour

debate with lie detectors.
"Almost nobody's career would
survive having lie detectors used in
campaigns," Nixon said. If elected,
Nixon would also place a Webcam
in his office so that people could see
what goes on behind closed doors.
"[()thers in Congress] can't stand
that idea," he said. And the profu
sion of technology would be boon to
the local economy, he added.
Challengers have trouble
raising money
Both Nixon and Carver said
they see their major disadvantage
as having less money than Eshoo,
the incumbent, who has raised
over $700,000 according to the
Center for Responsive Politics.
Carver chalked this up to special
interest groups.
"It hit home to me how unable I
was to get my voice out there. The
only way [to raise money] is to make
implicit promises with special inter
est groups," he said.
He notes how this experience
has made him become more of a

supporter oi campaign finance
reform legislation.
Nixon, in contrast, finds tlie
new McCain-Feingold campaign
finance law — which Eshoo voted
for — repugnant.
"Next Wednesday, when the
law goes into effect, bureaucrats
can decide what is legal and ille
gal to say," he said. "Any candi
date is going to have to have a
full-time lawyer on his staff. It
creates far more barriers to entry
than it eliminates."
Nixon: 'If you don't love
paperwork, vote for me'
Campaign-finance legislation
is just one layer of bureaucracy
that Nixon would aim to elimi
nate if elected.
"1 have 30 years experience in
business cutting waste, fraud and
abuse. The federal government
has been terrible in adopting Sili
con Valley technology because
most federal employees are De
mocrats. If you don't love paper
work," Nixon said, "vote for me."
