# Eshoo likely to win 14th
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Democrat Anna Eshoo has rep
resented Stanford and the rest of
the 14th Congressional District in
the U.S. House of Representatives
for 10 years. On Tuesday she is
once again up for re-election. As
an incumbent in a predominantly
Democratic district, even her op
ponents admit that her seat seams
relatively safe. She has raised 14
times the amount of money her
leading opponent has and sits in a
district which is 4(5 percent Demo
crat and 30 percent Republicans
by registration.
Her Republican opponent, Joe
Nixon, a first-time candidate, ad
mits that the scales are not in his
favor, but he says, "Stranger
things have happened."
Eshoo addresses student apathy
The two candidates visited

Stanford last night in a forum
sponsored by the ASSU's "Get
Out The Vote 2002" campaign
that drew about 25 students.
Eshoo, the prime draw for the
forum, spoke on student apathy
and the issues she thought stu
dents should care about.
"The 10,000-pound gorilla
in the room is that fewer people
are participating," she said.
"You need to know what we do
[in Congress] and what it means
to you."
Eshoo credited Stanford's get
out-the-vote efforts for helping

her get elected 10 years ago. I'he
issues today are more pressing
than ever, she noted.
"Every person in this country
is needed to be engaged in this,"
she said.
Nixon spoke more specifically
about the issues in his campaign,
from the economy to fiscal waste.
"The job market is deterio
rating," he said. "If you are
troubled by corporate account
ability, you would be surprised
how little accountability there is
