# Hospital workers plan one-day strike
## Union delivers strike notification to hospital management 
### ERIC ELDON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At noon last Friday, union
workers at the Stanford Hospital
and the Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital gave notice to hospital
administrators that they will hold
a one-day strike on Nov. 13 to ad
vocate for higher wages and im
proved working conditions if ne
gotiations fora new contract are
not finalized by the end of the day
today.
The current contract, which ex
pires today, has been in negotia
tion between union SEIU Local
715 representatives and the hospi
tal administration since early Oc
tober. Workers voted to authorize
the strike last Wednesday.
"We are continuing to negotiate

with the union and will continue to
negotiate throughout this entire
process," hospital spokesperson
Maria La Ganga told the San Jose
Mercury News this Saturday. "We
hope that our valued SEIU-repre
sented employees do not walk off
their jobs, but we want to empha
size that patient care is our num
ber-one priority."
Union representative Isobel
White said that the union plans to
file unfair labor practice charges
against the hospital today.
In a union press release last Fri
day, workers stated that they "will
strike for quality patient care iI ex
ecutives do not agree to stop bar
gaining in bad faith and agree to
health care standards that have
been accepted at over 60 other
hospitals in the Bay Area."
Ana Esquivel, a certified nurse
assistant at the Children's Hospi
tal, stated in the release that "in
negotiations, we have been
proposing steps to improve pa
tient care by allowing workers to
have a voice in stalling, lint the
management has refused to even
consider our proposals."
Proposed steps include the for
mation of a committee on patient
care made up of equal numbers of
managers and workers, which
would address other workers' con
cerns also brought up during the
negotiations, such as the poor'work
er-retention rate and chronic 1111-
clerstaHing currently experienced
at the hospitals.
Union representatives said
that the stalling problem is so
acute that it lias begun to harm

basic patient tare.
"We recently had a bain who
scratched herself until she pulled
out her colostomy tube," Ksquiv
el said. "This happened because
stalldidn't have time to comfort
her, and she grew restless. She
was bleeding .ill over hersell be
fore anyone noticed."
Anna Miunfbrcl, co-coordina
tor for the Stanford I .abor Action
(Coalition, said 11 i;it the group will
be supporting the workers dur
ing their negotiations.
"We'll be supporting hospital
workers as they come out of the final
day of their negotiations with the
University in a candlelight vigil,"
she said. "We want to show the
workers and the [University) ad
ministration that the University
should be accountable for all of its
employees."
