# Almost 500 juniors, 100 seniors undeclared
## Registrar calls late declaration a 'chronic problem' 
### MARK DOMINIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
In anticipation of the beginning
of registration for winter quarter
courses, the Registrar's Office has
placed holds on the records of all
undeclared juniors and seniors.
"This may come as a surprise
to some on campus, but I think
that the Registrar's Office has
been a little too generous in lis
tening to reasons why students
haven't declared their majors

yet," said Roger Printup, Univer
sity registrar.
As of the end of the third week
of fall quarter this year, 492 juniors
— nearly a third of the junior
class — and 89 seniors were unde
clared. Although there are fewer
juniors undeclared this year than
last, the number of undeclared se
niors represents a significant in
crease over last year.
"This has been a chronic prob
lem at Stanford," Printup said. "It
is about right that at the beginning
of fall quarter half of the junior
class is undeclared."
"There are numerous reasons
why people haven't declared by
the beginning of their junior
year," said Susan Zare, student af
fairs officer at the Undergraduate
Advising Center.
"One is procrastination. But
there are also some students who
are searching for their major.
They really haven't come to a dec i
sion. Some majors require more
time to declare. If students have a
long declaration process, they may
be doing it, but they aren't official
ly declared," she continued.
Zare said that over the course
of the past few years, the Under
graduate Advising Center has
been working to encourage stu
dents to declare a major by the
end of their sophomore year.
"Students have become con
scious over time of declaring by
the end of their sophomore year,
but it didn't have any statistical
impact," Zare said.
Mary I liminkool, one of the ju
nior class presidents, said that she
and the ASSU are working to help
juniors declare majors by the end
of this quarter.
"We're having an event on Nov.

20 with the CDC and the UAC
which is sponsored by the class
presidents," she said. "It's called
'Plan Your Life Night.' We are
pushing the class to declare a majc >i
before the end of the quarter."
" This is definitely a problem,"
she continued. "Declaration can
take up to a couple of weeks, and
we hope that at the Nov. 20 event
people will sit down and declare
right there."
Printup said that he believes it is
better for the student academically
to have declared a major by the time
he or she is in the second halfof his
or her career as an undergraduate.
"I'm on a committee that re
views students in academic clilli
culty," he said. "It is so common
that students in academic difficul
ty haven't declared a major, or that
if they've declared a major, it is
clearly not one that they are going
to pusue — it's a fictional major.
" These students are not get
ting any advising, and they are in
academic difficulty. These stu
dents are the students who
should be advised .... It's not
just that I'm the Registrar and I
like all the data in nice neat boxes
and zeros in certain boxes — this
is better for the students," Print
up continued.
