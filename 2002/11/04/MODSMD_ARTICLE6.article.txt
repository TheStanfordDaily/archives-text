# New York wins Olympic bid
## 
### ALISON PIERCE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Volunteers, supporters
and Olympians from the Bay
Area watched in dismay as
the United States Olympic
Committee selected New
York over San Francisco to
be the United States candi-

date city to host the 2012 Olympic Games.
After a hopeful ceremony in San Francisco's City
Hall, USOC President Marty Mankamyer made the
announcement via live satellite TV from Colorado
Springs, Colo. It was as if the grand rotunda of City
Hall itself sighed. The disappointment was absolute
fora city that had just lost the World Series and had
worked tremendously hard on what it thought was
a perfect Olympic bid.
New York took 59.2 percent of the 123 USOC
board member's votes. The USOC's goal was to
choose the city that would most likely beat out stiff
international competition among cities like Paris,
Moscow and Rome, which will also be competing
for the International Olympic Committee's final
vote in 2005.
Anne Cribbs, president and CEO of the Bay Area
Sports Organizing Committee, sat beside San Fran
cisco Mayor Willie Brown at the ceremony in Col
orado Springs. Moments before both committees
were to give their hour-long presentations to the
USOC board, Cribbs and the BASOC committee
were told that a budget surplus for San Francisco's
Olympic bid would not be factored in to the USOC]
decision. This was a major component of BASOC's
platform that suddenly turned out to be a detri
ment to its bid.

"Of course we're deeply disappointed," Cribbs
said. "But at the same time, we're very, very proud.
Proud of the overwhelming community support for
our bid, and most of all, proud of our people. 1
wouldn't have done anything different. I just hope
that all the volunteers and organizers are celebrat
ing their big accomplishment right now."
Another possible drawback to BASOC's bid in
the critical eyes of USOC members was that the
planned venues were spread too far apart. The
city's "Ring of Gold" venue plan split the events be
tween four Bay Area locations: San Francisco, Oak
land, Palo Alto and San Jose / Santa Clara. All but
two events were within 32 miles of the proposed
Olympic Village at Moff'ett Field.
In contrast, New York's venue plan, called
"Olympic X," placed all venues but one within 20
miles of its projected Olympic Village in Queens.
Many, however, think that' Sept. 11 sympathy'had
something to do with the USOC] decision.
"New York is a spectacular city internationally and
transcends borders," said Gavin Newsom, a candi
date for San Francisco City Supervisor. "It is recog
nized around the world, especially in the specter of
tragic events of Sept. 11.
"[Sept. 11] had to have played a significant part in
the USOC decision; every person on that committee
was affected by Sept. 11. I think our bid was the bet
ter bid if it weren't for that," he continued.
Many of the I(i Bay Area Olympians who had
come to show their support for San Francisco broke
into tears at the announcement of New York's win.
"I really thought that we would get it," said Jim
Hines, 1968 gold medalist in the 1000-meter dash.
"It's a sad thing. I'm very sad about it. I was plan-

ning on going into coaching but
now ... it would have been an
other dream."
Ted Murphy, an Olympian in
1996 and 2000 for rowing, helped
plan the bid along the way.
"We have so many Olympians
in the Bay Area," he said. "This bid
was lor the athletes. That's why we

thought we would be the number
one choice."
Alter the Hags and posters came
clown in City Hall and the hun
dreds of disappointed supporters
went home, Bay Area organizers
said they still remain hopeful.
"I can tell you today that our
Olympic ambitions didn't die,"
said Daphne Mayer, BASOC's
press relations manager.
"The Bay Area and the
Olympics are too obvious a
match," she continued.
