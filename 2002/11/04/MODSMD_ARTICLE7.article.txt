### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Emphasizing educational ac
countability while fending off criti
cism over the state's energy prob
lems, California Gov. Gray Davis has
worked hard to build a lead in his
campaign for re-election.
Davis, a Democrat, graduated
from Stanford in 1964 with a degree

in history and went on to study law at
Columbia, from which lie graduated
in 1967.
Prior to his governorship, Davis
occupied numerous posts in Califor
nia, including lieutenant governor,
controller and state assembly mem
ber. He also is a Vietnam veteran
who held the rank of Captain and
earned the Bronze Star for meritori
ous service.

secretary for the Davis campaign,

siiicl that Davis is currently enjoy
ing a lead that the campaign mem
bers believe will translate into an
election-day victory.
"Our campaign is going very
well — in a number of the public
polls we are 7-10 points ahead,"
Sanchez said. "We are heading
into the weekend doing a massive
get-out-the-vote eflbrt, with direct
mail and thousands of phone calls.
"For the past month, the gover
nor has been going to rallies and
energizing voters," Sanchez con
tinued. "He has even done some
canvassing himself, such as phon
ing possible voters — things like
that get the campaign workers in
volved, and it is a lot of fun."
One of the tougher issues
Davis is working on this cam
paign is to separate himself from
the state-wide power outages that
attracted national media atten
tion in early 2001.
"Davis is completely incompe
tent as a governor," said a student
who wished to remain anony
mous. "I hate to burst the bubble
of mv fellow liberal students here,

but Davis totally screwed over Cal
ifornia. We had no energy, but we
were still paying a lot for it. What is
the point of that?"
Though the blackouts might be
the top concern for some voters
when reflecting on Davis' tenure in
office, the Davis campaign has tried
to emphasize its successes in other
areas over the past four years.
"Schools are more accountable,"
Davis said in a press release. "Teach
ers are better trained. Acc)llege edu
cation is more accessible. And here
are the most important numbers —
test scores are up four years in a row.
We're building a brighter future for
our kids. We're turning the corner
on education. And we can't afford to
turn back now."
Sanchez, seconded the gover
nor's commitment to ensuring the
well-being of the state.
" There are prescription drugs
for seniors and more than a mil
lion children who did not have in
surance when the governor start
ed that have it now," Sanchez said.
"He is protecting a woman's
right to c hoose and taking land
mark steps to protect the envi
ronment .... The governor has
put a lot of money toward urban
parks to beautify urban areas."
Sanchez emphasized that the

Davis administration has been able
to accomplish a lot in light of the
lack of money it had to work with.
"[Davis] protected funds for
seniors, schooling and the envi
ronment," Sanchez said. "These
are things he has done in spite of
a budget deficit."
Sanchez also offered his inter
pretation of the incident in Los
Angeles where the Green Party
candidate Peter Camejo was not
allowed into a Los Angeles
rimes-sponsored debate be
tween Davis and Simon.
"The L.A. Times' criteria, based
on a presidential commission re
port, fora minority party to be
considered was that they must
have at least 15 percent of voters to
be in debate," Sanchez said. "The
unfortunate thing was [Simon] was
using Peter Camejo as a campaign
prop, and that is all there is to it.
"It is clear Simon's intentions
were less than honorable — his
thinking is that Camejo will siphon
oil votes from Davis. I don't think
voters fall for those kinds of tricks."
I he Davis campaign reported
that the governor will be Hying
around the state today and to
morrow in order to "rally the
troops" in the final hours before
the election.
