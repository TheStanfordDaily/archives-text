## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
In an upset that took many in the
political world by surprise, Bill
Simon defeated his opponent
Richard Riordan in the gubernator
ial primary to become the Republi
can Party candidate for governor of
California. Now Simon, a 51-year
old financier and philanthropist
from Pacific Palisades, is poised to

mount a challenge (o Democratic in
cumbent Gray Davis.
After graduating from law school
at Boston College, Simon served as
an assistant U.S. attorney under
Rudolph Giuliani, who is now for
mer mayor of New York.
In 1988, Simon co-founded a pri
vate investment firm entitled
William E. Simon & Sons, lie was
chairman of the non-profit organi
zation Covenant House of California
and currently serves as vice-chair
man of Catholic Charities of Los An
geles.
In his "Blueprint to Renew the


Knight Ridder/Tribune
California Dream" platform,
Simon urges fiscal responsibility,
educational improvements and
state-wide renewal of infrastruc
ture and resource management.
Simon has pledged to pass tax
cuts, balance tlie state budget, se
cure local government revenues
from state seizure and require
state-mandated projects to be
backed financially by the state to
revitalize the economy.
"Gray Davis inherited a record
budget surplus — $8 billion dol
lars— and managed to misman
age it into a record $23.(3 billion
deficit," Simon said in a press re
lease. "And now he's trying to in
crease our taxes to bail himself
out of the mess he created."
"Gray Davis didn't plan to fail, he
failed to plan," Simon continued.
Simon, according to his plat
form, intends to improve educa
tion by increasing local district
control over school policy by less
ening state oversight, reducing
school district and classroom
sizes, and expanding charter
school programs.

flis plans also include seeking
to rebuild California by repairing
the transportation system, ensur
ing adequate water supplies across
the state, and gaining greater en
ergy leverage by seeking alterna
tive source of power, renegotiating
power contracts and promoting ef
ficient energy usage.
Damon Vangelis, MBA '02
and a Simon press deputy, ex
plained that despite any "turbu
lence" the campaign has experi
enced, "we are coming in fora
smooth landing."
"[Simon] is campaigning up
and down the state," Vangelis
said, "lie will be in San Diego
with Jack Kemp. Jack Kemp has
the reputation for cleaning up
the campaign financing mess in
our country — Davis is the epit
ome of those abuses by putting
up false ads smearing a good
man."
Vangelis described Simon's
mix of private and public experi
ence as a strength rather than a
weakness.
"Davis' whole career has been
in public affairs," Vangelis said.
"Simon brings to the governor's
office a great perspective on what
the private sector can do and
bring — and what the public sec

tor can do — to try and bring
people together to work on real
solutions to lix the problems fac
ing the state."
I le explained that Simon tried
to invite Camejo to the I.os Ange
les I imes debate, against the
wishes of the Davis campaign.
"Simon is good friends with
the Creen Party candidate —
both agree there is a mess in
Sacramento," Vangelis said.
"When the guest lists were
submitted to the Los Angeles
Times and the Davis people
heard [Camejo] would be there,
they threatened to withdraw
from the debate . . . The Los An
geles I imes was in the unfortu
nate position of censoring—
telling us they could not bring
[Camejo] — to ensure that the
debate would take place."
Vangelis said that he felt the
final results on Election Day will
favor Simon.
"I think when voters in the
final stretch focus on the cam
paign — with 25 percent now un
decided— they will decide if
they are better oil now than they
were four years ago," Vangelis
said. Simon has a good strong vi
sion for California with ideas to
get us moving ahead again."
