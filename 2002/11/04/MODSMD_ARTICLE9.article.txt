# Camejo promotes justice as Green Party candidate
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
In an attempt to get its agenda on the
politcal radar, the Green Party is present
ing Peter Camejo as its candidate for the
2002 California governor's race.
Camejo is a first generation Venezue
lan-American who "has fought for social
and environmental justice since his
teens," according to his campaign Web
site. He studied math and history as an
undergraduate at UC- Berkeley.
Tyler Snortum-Phelps, Camejo's

campaign manager, explained what sets
Camejo and his party apart from his op
ponents in the gubernatorial race.
"We have always represented a party
of people," Snortum-Phelps said. "[We
are] fighting for people's issues while the
Democrats and Republicans represent
corporate issues — this is a campaign to
get those issues out there.
"Peter feels that running for gover
nor is the way to do that — he feels he
would make a great governor with his
business experience," Snortum-
Phelps continued.
Among other issues, Camejo supports
ending energy-industry "bailouts," estab-

lishing living-wage laws, ending the
death penalty, having run-off elec
tions in statewide races, ending
racial profiling, protecting old
growth trees, initiating universal
health care and strengthening pub
lit education by guaranteeing equal
access to facilities and increasing
teacher pay.
Throughout the race, he has
stressed his lack of involvement with
spec ial interests.
"My platform is what makes me
better than Simon or Davis," Came
jo said in a press release. "That I'm
not associated with money, not in
lluenced by money, makes me the
best candidate."

The Green Party campaign
strives to underscore the problems
with California's current political
and scx:ial policy.
"There is a real crisis in terms
of the environment and the econ
omy," Snortum-Phelps said. "So
many things have been misman
aged by the Democratic govern
ment — you really have to give
the Democrats (he blame. That is
(he point of our campaign — we
are finding amazing interest and
resonance among Californians
for these ideas."
Some students said they were
pleased that the Green Party is ap
proaching the issues from a differ
ent angle.
"I think the Green Party is rabid,
and they don't play the game of pol
itics," said Nimmy Omer, a sopho
more. "But I don't think there are

enough other people out there who
are also sick of politics to make them
a valid choice."
According to Snortum-Phelps,
Camejo has repeatedly tried to
upset the two-party domination
of the governor's race.
In one example of his determi
nation to upset the current sys
tem, he asked to be allowed to at
tend a debate on Oct. 6 between
Democratic incumbent Gray
Davis and Republican challenger
Bill Simon — sponsored by The
Los Angeles Times. Subsequent
ly, the event was almost canceled
when Camejo attempted to at
tend it.
"Governor Davis basically shut
him out and had a temper
tantrum," Snortum-Phelps said.
"We asked if we could have
[Camejo] present in the building

so he could have access to media
afterward — Peter had an invita
tion. By [shutting Camejo out],
Davis gave huge media attention
to the campaign —we had 60
press interviews that day."
Snortuin-Phelps said he be
lieves that Davis is running for
governor "by hiding."
"[Davis will] tell you what bills
he voted for," Snortum-Philips
said. "But he'll never say 'this is
my principle — I stand for it
once and for all.' That is the pur
pose of the Green Party —we
have principles that we stand by,
and we don't change them if they
aren't popular.
"Davis strategizesabout how to
win and changes his positions
based on polls and contributors.
Republicans do it too, but Davis
has made it into an art form."
