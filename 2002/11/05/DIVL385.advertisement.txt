Rachel Maddow, D.Phil, graduated from Stanford in 1994 (Public Policy, Honors
Program in Ethics in Society). As a John Gardner Fellow, Maddow worked at the
AIDS Legal Referral Panel in San Francisco, and with Bay Area activist groups
ACT UP, Empty the Shelters, and the Women's AIDS Network. Maddow was
selected for both Scholarships in 1995, and obtained her doctorate in Politics at
Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. In Britain, she was general manager of the AIDS
Treatment Project, the UK's first community-based HIV/AIDS treatment advocacy
organization. A nationally-recognized expert on the issue of HIV/AIDS in prisons,
Maddow now works as a consultant on HIV/AIDS in prison issues for the National
Minority AIDS Council, the ACLU National Prison Project, and other advocacy
organizations. Her recent work organizing opposition to "worst-case scenarios' in
HIV/AIDS in prisons policies helped end Mississippi's longstanding exclusion of
HIV-positive prisoners from prison programs.
