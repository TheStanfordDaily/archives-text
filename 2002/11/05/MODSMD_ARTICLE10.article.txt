## Bush, Dems campaign in key elections 
### 
(AP) — President Bush barnstormed
through four battleground states yesterday in a
final appeal for Republicans in Congress who
will vote to make tax cuts permanent and con
linn conservativejudges. Democrats worked for
a strong voter turnout to tilt key races their way.
"We'll see what the voters and the Good
Lord has in store tomorrow," said Republican
gubernatorial candidate Mark Sanford in
South Carolina, summing up the hopes — and
anxiety — of candidates everywhere.
While Bush and the Democrats focused
their energies on dozens of races, Minnesota
Senate rivals Walter F. Mondale and Norm
Coleman staged the final debate of the cam
paign season. They were partially upstaged by
the governor's appointment of an interim re
placement for the late Sen. Paul Wellstone.
111 (he 1 louse, where all 435 seats are at stake
today, Democrats need a gain of seven to win
control. But it was the Republicans who sound
ed upbeat — suggesting they could even defy
historical trends and pick up a seat or two at
Bush's midterm. "To be on the edge of break
ing that historical trend is a significant accom
plishment," said White House press secretary
Ari Fleischer.
I he Senate is divided 49-49, with two inde
pendents, and the battle for control hinged on
six or eight races judged as tossups or nearly so
in the late polls.
South Dakota was home to one, pitting De
mocratic Sen. Tim Johnson against GOP Rep
John Thune. Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle, the state's other senator, worked to
preserve Johnson's Senate tenure — and his
own grip on power as leader of the Democrat

ic majority.
In Minnesota, Mondale and Coleman vied
for Wellstone's seat in their only debate of a
one-week campaign.
Mondale, 74, took the offensive early. "Yon
have a campaign here that is a poster child for
what is wrong in politics," he said to Coleman,
seated a few leet away. "You've taken not thou
sands, but millions of dollars from the special
interests, from the Enrons."
"Mr. Vice President, let me say very, very,
very respectfully, when we talk about special in
terest and support from corporate America,
that's been your world," Coleman rebutted.
"That's the world in which you've lived, serving
on boards of Cargill" and other firms, he said.
The two men debated as Gov. Jesse Ventura

was announcing his selection of Dean Barkley,
an independent, as interim replacement lor
YVellstone. Wellstonedied late last month in the
crash of a small plane.
Bush, his approval ratings over 60 percent,
worked his way from lowa to Missouri,
Arkansas and Texas, the end of an intense ef
fort to elect Republican governors and mem
bers of the 1 louse and Senate.
"I'll be voting in (1 raw lord, Texas, tomorrow
morning," the president said in Cedar Rapids,
lowa. "I'm not undecided."
As he has at do/ens of rallies, he stressed the
importance ol the war on terrorism, criticized
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and renewed
his call fora Department of Homeland Securi
ty built to his specifications.
