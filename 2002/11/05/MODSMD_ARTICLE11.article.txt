WAS IIINGTON (AP) â€” U.S.
forces killed a top associate of
Osama bin Laden in Yemen in a
missile strike yesterday, expanding
the war on terror with America's
first overt attack on suspected al-
Qaida operatives outside of
Afghanistan, a U.S. official said.
Qaed Salim Sinan al-Harethi
was one of several al-Qaida mem
bers traveling by car in northwest
Yemen when a Hellfire missile
struck it Sunday, killing him and
live others. The ollicial, speaking
on the condition of anonymity,
said the attack was believed to have
been conducted by a CIA airc raft,
possibly a missile-carrying Preda
tor drone.
The official Yemeni news
agency, local tribesmen and the
U.S. official confirmed the strike
killed al-Harethi. Witnesses said
they saw an aircraft, possibly a heli
copter, in the area. I lellfirescan also
be launched by attack helicopters.
The others killed were believed
to be low-level operatives. The at
tack occurred in the northern
province of Marib, about 100
miles east of Yemen's capital of
San'a, where al-Qaida is consid
ered active.
U.S. counterterrorism officials
have said al-Harethi, also known
as Abu Ali, was al-Qaida's chief O
perative in Yemen and a top target
of U.S. anti-terrorism efforts. An
associate of bin Laden since the
early 1990s in Sudan, al-1 farethi is
a suspect in the bombing of the de
stroyer USS Cole in Aden, Yemen,

on Oct. 12,2000.
The CIA declined comment.
Yesterday, Defense Secretary
Donald H. Rumsfeld told a Penta
gon press conference, "It would be
a very good thing if he were out of
business."
A Yemeni official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said, "Au
thorities have been monitoring
this particular car fora while and
we believe those men belonged to
the al-Qaida terror network."
Many al-Qaida operatives flee
ing the U.S.-led war on
Afghanistan have joined comrades
in Yemen. After the United States
detected growth in al-Qaida pres
ence there this spring, hundreds
of U.S. troops deployed to Dji
bouti, the liny African nation lac
ing Yemen across the Gulf of
Aden, officials said. The Marine
amphibious assault ship Nassau
recently replaced the USS Belleau
Wood in the waters between the
two nations.
Inside Yemen, U.S.-trained
Yemeni troops deployed to sus
pected al-Qaida hotbeds in August.
Besides al-I larethi, at least one
more Yemeni al-Qaida operative
linked to the Cole attack, Moham
mad 1 lamdi al-Ahdal, is thought to
be in Yemen, U.S. officials say.
Also believed to be in Yemen are
Shaykh Dabwan and Suwaid, de
scribed as al-Qaida operatives who
plan and provide support to terror
operations, and an al-Qaida com
munications expert known as Miq
dad, said a U.S. defense official.
