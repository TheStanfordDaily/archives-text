Stanford may sometimes seem like a sell
contained vacuum, but the outcome of this
year's statewide general election will un
doubtedly affect the campus community,
lb help you cast your vote in tomorrow's election,
The Daily's editorial board offers the following en
dorsements of certain contests. For more informa
tion, check out easyvoter.org or calvoter.org.
PROP. 46, HOUSING BOND: YES
One doesn't have to look farther than the
Stanford campus to experience the rising cost
of housing in California, where many workers
struggle to afford homes in the Bay Area. The
median home price in California in Septem
ber cost $323,310, a price tag that fewer than
one-third of Californians can afford. We en
dorse a yes vote on Proposition 46, which would
provide $2.1 billion for affordable housing for
seniors and low-income families, emergency
shelters for battered women and shelters with
social services for the homeless.
PROP. 47, EDUCATION FACILITIES BOND: YES
Proposition 47 authorizes the sale of slightly
over $13 billion in bonds to pay for large-scale
improvements in California public schools, in
cluding the CSU and UC systems. Such im
provements include building repairs and staff
and faculty salary increases. We endorse a yes
vote on Prop. 47. The proposed benefits of the
bond sales accrue to the public in the form of an
educated workforce able to promote economic
expansion, and hence public financing is ap
propriate. The opponents, the taxpayer advo
cates, have suggested no alternative financing
options and offer largely hackneyed and equiv
ocal arguments to the proposition.
PROP. 48, COURT CONSOLIDATION: YES
Proposition 48 amends the California State
Constitution by deleting all references to munic
ipal courts. In 1998, Proposition 220 approved
the consolidation of superior and municipal trial
courts into unified superior courts. We endorse a
yes vote on Prop. 48 because the California State
Constitution needs to be updated to work in ac
cordance with the approval of Prop. 220. Fur
ther, the institution of Prop. 48 will cost tax pay
ers nothing.
PROP. 49, AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS: NO
Proposition 49 would require the state to
spend up to $550 million each year on before
and after school programs. We endorse a no
vote on Prop. 49 because, in tough budget
times, the spending mandated may result in in

creased budget cuts from other important areas
that impact children like health care, child pro
tection and social services.
PROP. 50, WATER QUALITY: YES
Proposition 50 will devote $3.44 million to pro
tecting coastal wetlands (marshes), safe drinking
water projects, the CALFED Bay-Delta Program
(which is important for Northern California
farmers and residents) and other water projects.
We endorse a yes vote on Prop. 50 because the
bond would ensure safe drinking water supplies
to keep up with California's burgeoning popula
tion. Numerous public health and environmental
groups have all endorsed the bond.
PROP. 51, TRANSPORTATION: NO
Proposition 51 would put 30 percent of the
sales tax on motor vehicles (about $910 million
next year) into a new special fund. That money
could be used only on transportation purposes
listed in the proposition, including many specif
ic projects. Most of the money would be spent
on rail and bus transit systems and on highway
and street improvements.
We endorse a no vote on Prop. 51 because this
measure will reserve nearly $ 1 billion in tax money
each year for specific purposes — including 45
"pork barrel projects" — which could not be
changed by the State Legislature even in a budget
crisis. Prop. 51 would take money away from ser
vices like children's health care and Cal Grant col
lege scholarships for needy students and use it to
build projects like a golf cart path at the Leisure
World retirement community in Orange County
and a rail line to an Indian casino in Palm Springs.
PROP. 52, ELECTION DAY VOTER
REGISTRATION: YES
Proposition 52 would allow all eligible citi
zens to register to vote on the same clay as the
election. Opponents argue that the chances
for voter fraud are too large of a risk in Cali
fornia. However, the proposition requires
proof of residence. Further, to combat issues
like voter fraud, the measure creates stiffer
penalties. We endorse a yes vote on Prop. 52
because it increases the opportunity for ev
eryone — including absentminded students
who forgot to register either here or at home
— to participate in democracy.
GOVERNOR: PETER MIGUEL CAMEJO,
GREEN
Ihe governor is the chief executive officer of
California and oversees most state departments
and agencies, appoints judges, approves or re

jects new state laws, presents an annual state
budget to the State Legislature and manages
state resources during emergencies.
In evaluating the two major party candidates,
Democrat Gray Davis and Republican Bill Simon,
we question the integrity of both candidates and
would not feel comfortable asking either of them
to lead California during the next four years.
Camejo, on the other hand, wants to work hard to
fight corruption in California and has a sound
platform, which includes a greater use of renew
able energy sources, a fair living wage law and end
ing racial profiling by police and the criminal jus
tice system. Camejo was also the only gubernatori
al candidate who took time out of his campaign
schedule to come speak at Stanford.
SECRETARY OF STATE: KEVIN SHELLEY,
DEMOCRAT
The secretary of state runs statewide elections,
keeps campaign records, issues official docu
ments relating to corporations and trademarks
and runs the state archives. Although all candi
dates for the position agree that California's sys
tem of voting needs reform, most support either
impractical initiatives or offer only vague expla
nations of how they would implement changes.
Democrat Kevin Shelley, the current state assem
bly majority leader, communicates the soundest
platform and is the only candidate with a proven
record of concrete service similar to that required
of the secretary of state. Shelley's experience in
voting reform and corporate and government
accountability, combined with his extensive polit
ical network within California, makes him the
best choice for secretary of state.
STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL: BILL LOCKYER,
DEMOCRAT
The attorney general is the main law en
forcement officer of California. The position
makes sure that laws are enforced the same way
across the state, runs the California Department
of Justice, serves as a legal adviser to state offi
cials and state agencies and oversees sheriffs,
district attorneys and other law enforcement
agencies.
After evaluating the five candidates running
for this position, we have decided to endorse
Lockyer because of his continued commitment
to work with local law enforcement to expand
the use of I)NA technology in the identification
of rapists and murders and his promise to in
vestigate illegal price gouging by Enron and
other energy companies.
Other candidates take political stances that
seem too extreme. American Independent can
didate Diane Beall Templin's asserts that she

I liis ediiori.il represents the views of the members of The Daily's editorial board. The board consists of The Daily's editor in chief, managing editor for daily special sections, two opinio
editors and three community members at-large. Signed columns and contributions are the view of the writer and do not necessarily represent the view of the editorial board.

would like to "restore Biblical and Constitutional
principles to law enforcement," and we feel that
might blur the line between church and state.
Further, we feel that Lockyer's platform seems
much more solution-oriented than other candi
dates' platforms.
STATE ASSEMBLY: JOE SIMITIAN, DEMOCRAT
The State Assembly member for District 21
represents about 423,400 constituents in the Bay
Area. During his first term in the State Legisla
ture, Simitian, a Palo Alto Democrat, proved
himself as a strong and reliable voice for his con
stituents. Furthermore, we feel that Simitian's
priorities match well with those of the University.
He is devoted to education, at both the primary
and university levels, and has shown a commit
ment to issues facing the Stanford community
through his work on the General Use Permit.
STATE CONTROLLER: STEVE WESTLY, DEMO
CRAT
I he state controller serves as the state's book
keeper. He or she oversees state spending, man
ages money due to California, conducts audits of
state operations and sits on several boards.
Democrat Steve Westly supports issues like af
fordable housing, the environment and public
education. He has taught at Stanford's Business
School and wants to stop "government waste and
create good, new jobs." His main opponent, a
state assemblyman, is too fiscally conservative,
which could be dangerous for California.
STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC IN
STRUCTION: JACK O'CONNELL
This person acts as the spokesman for ed
ucation in California and works to improve
it. Jack O'Connell, an educator with 20 years
of experience, is the obvious choice for this
position. He wants to reduce class sizes and
recruit more qualified teachers. His oppo
nent, Anaheim school board member Kathy
Smith, has proposals that are vague and not
necessary for California right now: She
wants to "teach the Golden Rule" and bring
back "a daily moment of silence."
U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, DISTRICT
14: ANNA ESHOO, DEMOCRAT
The race for District 14 of the U.S. House will
decide who will represent the district, including
the Stanford area, in the U.S. House of Represen
tatives in Washington, D.C.
Anna Eshoo is our clear
choice to represent the Stan
ford area for another two years.
Throughout her time in
Congress, Eshoo has shown a
commitment in helping the
Stanford community. Most re
cently, she worked with gradu
ate students work on a health
care policy. Eshoo's Republican
opponent, Joe Nixon, is pri
marily running on a campaign
denouncing Eshoo for voting
against President Bush's resolu
tion to authorize a war against
Iraq. Many in the Stanford
community would disagree
with this stance, anyway.
