# TALES FROM UNDERCLASS
## Good times, bad times 
### 
People often ask me "What's it like
being a columnist for The Daily?"
(Well, people don't generally ask
me this, because I make it loud and
clear to those around me how hard it is to
be one).
Believe it or not, there are downsides to
being a columnist. I'm always worried that
I'm going to hit a dud. One week, I just

won't be able to turn it on,
and I'll let everyone
down. I worry about re
vealing too much, like
telling a story about some
one I know who doesn't
want it told, and then
souring the relationship.
Or my friends will all start
worrying about what they

tell me for fear it'll turn into column fodder.
Or telling a story about myself that
shouldn't be i?i the wild and permanently
affec ting how people view me.
My week starts on a I tiesday. By then, the
pain of writing last week's column is merely
a distant memory, and lots of random peo
ple are coming up to me and telling me how
much they enjoyed reading it. This is in
credibly cool. I love getting feedback from
my readers — it's that approval that keeps
me writing publicly. I'm never quite sure
what to say to these random people other
than "thanks." Don't get me wrong— I sin
cerely mean it. So if you've talked to me and
felt put off, don't worry. I really do love hear
ing from y'all. I'm only a picldly freshman
columnist fora piddly college newspaper; I
don't have THAT big of a head VET.

Wednesday is still pretty good. My Sat
urday evening column deadline is still a
long way away, and there's enough of a
constant stream of compliments about
Tuesday's column making me feel like
there's no way I could do any wrong.
By Thursday I'm starting to worry about
what to write about and the realization has
set in that I've added a virtual two-unit
course to my schedule with the addition of
this stupid column that makes me sign away
my publication rights and doesn't even pay
me. It's usually around now that I think
about quitting Then I see a copy of my col
umn on someone's door, and I remember
that I really love writing, and that one was
so good that I reward myself by putting off
thinking of a topic until tomorrow.
Fridayl Today I get to bitch about not
having a topic and consider using the"I
have no topic and have a column due to
morrow" topic (I'm saving that one for
when I have a six to eight page paper due
the next day, as opposed to this week's three
to four page one). Perhaps I sit down and
start my column. In all probability I do
something terribly neurotic instead, like or
ganizing my MP3s. At some point during
the day, my RA will beg me not to write any
thing bad about him — lie's a little para
noid. ()ther ()terans keep asking for shout
outs, and some of them deserve it. I'm
thinking as a way to help pay for late night
pizzas; I should start taking paid advertise
ments in this column. Shout outs to Mor
gan, my reluctant editor, Minna, my reluc-


David Blackman
Hint sounding hoard, Nina, my re
luctant muse, Sarah and Sarah, my
wholesome groupies (Can you be
lieve I have groupies? Wholesome
ones at that ?).
In reality, all my writing gets
done at some point on Saturday.
This is when all my weird writing
quirks come out. II I'm writing in
my room, 1 need to be using my
laptop, on my bed, lying prone.
And I can't be wearing jeans; I
need to be wearing O.K. scrubs
("Oh, are they?" "Rushmore" is a
great movie) on my legs. Music
choice is also key — needs to be
something that won't irritate me,
doesn't require too much mental
ellort and is somewhat calming. II
I'm outside . . . well, I'm going to
be heading to my room once I re
alize how terribly trite and con
nived it is to be sitting outside with
a co{fee cup and my laptop.
The only thing that would com
plete the image of the young, strug
gling writer is a black clamshell
Powerbook (like the one (larrie has
on "Sex in the City" — speaking of
which, every week I consider writ
ing about courtship at the Farm
and am then reminded by my edi
tor that the only restriction on my
column is "stay away from dating."
So I figure I can talk about meet
ing members of the opposite gen
der, and sex, but nothing in be
tween. Let's just say there's mate
rial to work with in this area. So
by Saturday night (Sunday

morning), I have my 5,000
words. Not that I'm happy with
any of them, or even my topic.
Sunday consists of editing my
column by doubling the length of
it, then cutting out all the original
text and significantly changing
the topic and resubmitting it to
my editor.
Monday night I copy edit. This
is usually the first time my words
get to see a spell checker. Also the
first time I put any thought into a
title or a byline. See, I love long li
lies. The Daily gives me three to
lour words. I like titles like "This
Column Has No Point OR How I
learned to stop worrying and write
stream of consciousness." My byline
is supposed to be witty and funny,
but since I don't even think about it
until I've finished butchering my
column down to the 5,000-charac
ter limit and am feeling rhetorically
drained, it's usually a painful pro
cess. Minor edits at The Daily, re
moval of cuss words, and I have a
seven-hour reprieve before my
week starts again.
()h yeah, and at some point dur
ing the week, I go to class, do my
homework, hang out with my
friends and eat.
I've tried to write columns that
everyone can relate to, I'm sorry
if this one doesn't work. Don't
worry, next week I'll talk about
my goals for the next four years
or maybe laundry. Yeah. Laun
dry sounds like a good topic.

learned to stop worrying and write
stream of consciousness." My byline
is supposed to be witty and funny,
but since I don't even think about it
until I've finished butchering my
column down to the 5,000-charac
ter limit and am feeling rhetorically
drained, it's usually a painful pro
cess. Minor edits at The Daily, re
moval of cuss words, and I have a
seven-hour reprieve before my
week starts again.
()h yeah, and at some point dur
ing the week, I go to class, do my
homework, hang out with my
friends and eat.
I've tried to write columns that
everyone can relate to, I'm sorry
if this one doesn't work. Don't
worry, next week I'll talk about
my goals for the next four years
or maybe laundry. Yeah. Laun
dry sounds like a good topic.

People often ask me "What's it like
being a columnist for The Daily?"
(Well, people don't generally ask
me this, because I make it loud and
clear to those around me how hard it is to
be one).
Believe it or not, there are downsides to
being a columnist. I'm always worried that
I'm going to hit a dud. One week, I just

won't be able to turn it on,
and I'll let everyone
down. I worry about re
vealing too much, like
telling a story about some
one I know who doesn't
want it told, and then
souring the relationship.
Or my friends will all start
worrying about what they

tell me for fear it'll turn into column fodder.
Or telling a story about myself that
shouldn't be i?i the wild and permanently
affec ting how people view me.
My week starts on a I tiesday. By then, the
pain of writing last week's column is merely
a distant memory, and lots of random peo
ple are coming up to me and telling me how
much they enjoyed reading it. This is in
credibly cool. I love getting feedback from
my readers — it's that approval that keeps
me writing publicly. I'm never quite sure
what to say to these random people other
than "thanks." Don't get me wrong— I sin
cerely mean it. So if you've talked to me and
felt put off, don't worry. I really do love hear
ing from y'all. I'm only a picldly freshman
columnist fora piddly college newspaper; I
don't have THAT big of a head VET.

Wednesday is still pretty good. My Sat
urday evening column deadline is still a
long way away, and there's enough of a
constant stream of compliments about
Tuesday's column making me feel like
there's no way I could do any wrong.
By Thursday I'm starting to worry about
what to write about and the realization has
set in that I've added a virtual two-unit
course to my schedule with the addition of
this stupid column that makes me sign away
my publication rights and doesn't even pay
me. It's usually around now that I think
about quitting Then I see a copy of my col
umn on someone's door, and I remember
that I really love writing, and that one was
so good that I reward myself by putting off
thinking of a topic until tomorrow.
Fridayl Today I get to bitch about not
having a topic and consider using the"I
have no topic and have a column due to
morrow" topic (I'm saving that one for
when I have a six to eight page paper due
the next day, as opposed to this week's three
to four page one). Perhaps I sit down and
start my column. In all probability I do
something terribly neurotic instead, like or
ganizing my MP3s. At some point during
the day, my RA will beg me not to write any
thing bad about him — lie's a little para
noid. ()ther ()terans keep asking for shout
outs, and some of them deserve it. I'm
thinking as a way to help pay for late night
pizzas; I should start taking paid advertise
ments in this column. Shout outs to Mor
gan, my reluctant editor, Minna, my reluc-


David Blackman
Hint sounding hoard, Nina, my re
luctant muse, Sarah and Sarah, my
wholesome groupies (Can you be
lieve I have groupies? Wholesome
ones at that ?).
In reality, all my writing gets
done at some point on Saturday.
This is when all my weird writing
quirks come out. II I'm writing in
my room, 1 need to be using my
laptop, on my bed, lying prone.
And I can't be wearing jeans; I
need to be wearing O.K. scrubs
("Oh, are they?" "Rushmore" is a
great movie) on my legs. Music
choice is also key — needs to be
something that won't irritate me,
doesn't require too much mental
ellort and is somewhat calming. II
I'm outside . . . well, I'm going to
be heading to my room once I re
alize how terribly trite and con
nived it is to be sitting outside with
a co{fee cup and my laptop.
The only thing that would com
plete the image of the young, strug
gling writer is a black clamshell
Powerbook (like the one (larrie has
on "Sex in the City" — speaking of
which, every week I consider writ
ing about courtship at the Farm
and am then reminded by my edi
tor that the only restriction on my
column is "stay away from dating."
So I figure I can talk about meet
ing members of the opposite gen
der, and sex, but nothing in be
tween. Let's just say there's mate
rial to work with in this area. So
by Saturday night (Sunday

morning), I have my 5,000
words. Not that I'm happy with
any of them, or even my topic.
Sunday consists of editing my
column by doubling the length of
it, then cutting out all the original
text and significantly changing
the topic and resubmitting it to
my editor.
Monday night I copy edit. This
is usually the first time my words
get to see a spell checker. Also the
first time I put any thought into a
title or a byline. See, I love long li
lies. The Daily gives me three to
lour words. I like titles like "This
Column Has No Point OR How I
learned to stop worrying and write
stream of consciousness." My byline
is supposed to be witty and funny,
but since I don't even think about it
