# TALES FROM UNDERCLASS
## Good times, bad times 
### 
People often ask me "What's it like
being a columnist for The Daily?"
(Well, people don't generally ask
me this, because I make it loud and
clear to those around me how hard it is to
be one).
Believe it or not, there are downsides to
being a columnist. I'm always worried that
I'm going to hit a dud. One week, I just

won't be able to turn it on,
and I'll let everyone
down. I worry about re
vealing too much, like
telling a story about some
one I know who doesn't
want it told, and then
souring the relationship.
Or my friends will all start
worrying about what they

tell me for fear it'll turn into column fodder.
Or telling a story about myself that
shouldn't be i?i the wild and permanently
affec ting how people view me.
My week starts on a I tiesday. By then, the
pain of writing last week's column is merely
a distant memory, and lots of random peo
ple are coming up to me and telling me how
much they enjoyed reading it. This is in
credibly cool. I love getting feedback from
my readers — it's that approval that keeps
me writing publicly. I'm never quite sure
what to say to these random people other
than "thanks." Don't get me wrong— I sin
cerely mean it. So if you've talked to me and
felt put off, don't worry. I really do love hear
ing from y'all. I'm only a picldly freshman
columnist fora piddly college newspaper; I
don't have THAT big of a head VET.

Wednesday is still pretty good. My Sat
urday evening column deadline is still a
long way away, and there's enough of a
constant stream of compliments about
Tuesday's column making me feel like
there's no way I could do any wrong.
By Thursday I'm starting to worry about
what to write about and the realization has
set in that I've added a virtual two-unit
course to my schedule with the addition of
this stupid column that makes me sign away
my publication rights and doesn't even pay
me. It's usually around now that I think
about quitting Then I see a copy of my col
umn on someone's door, and I remember
that I really love writing, and that one was
so good that I reward myself by putting off
thinking of a topic until tomorrow.
Fridayl Today I get to bitch about not
having a topic and consider using the"I
have no topic and have a column due to
morrow" topic (I'm saving that one for
when I have a six to eight page paper due
the next day, as opposed to this week's three
to four page one). Perhaps I sit down and
start my column. In all probability I do
something terribly neurotic instead, like or
ganizing my MP3s. At some point during
the day, my RA will beg me not to write any
thing bad about him — lie's a little para
noid. ()ther ()terans keep asking for shout
outs, and some of them deserve it. I'm
thinking as a way to help pay for late night
pizzas; I should start taking paid advertise
ments in this column. Shout outs to Mor
gan, my reluctant editor, Minna, my reluc-
