Race has 'nothing to do with' decisions
concerning the possible war
In her column ("Remembering race,"
Nov. 4) Lillian Ho reiterates Harry Bela
fonte's implication that Colin Powell and
Condoleezza Rice should take a stronger
stand against the war on Iraq because of
their race. Belafonte goes so far as to call
the secretary of state a "house slave." Ho
later suggests that Rice and Powell
should ask themselves if what "being
black means to them . . . squares with
what Bush represents."
If being of African descent for either
of these people relates to their opinion
on Iraq then by all means let them con
sider it, but to label Powell a slave simply
because he embraces a divergent view
point is counter to the ideal of diversity
that the left endeavors to embrace. What
Powell has presented is a difference of
opinion. Belafonte is implying that it is
not appropriate fora man with Powell's
skin color to support the war. Personally,
my skin color had nothing to do with my
decision on the possibility of war with
Iraq. I considered national security is
sues, my own feelings on the ethics of a
proactive strategy of international secu
rity, and the history of Iraq and its re
sponse to U.N. directives.
I would hope that Powell and Belafonte
considered all of these factors, and if they
did as well consider what their ethnic his
tory meant to their internal debate on the
subject, there is nothing to be criticized in
that. But to suggest a defect in Mr. Powell
or Ms. Rice, because they arrived at an op
posite conclusion, is wrong. It seems that it
is consistently very easy for the left to em
brace diversity in all institutions, but to re

ject diversity of ideas.
Ho has also demonstrated an igno
rance of the reality of being "white." "In a
world where everybody else has color,
they have none. In a world where every
body else has gender, they have none."
First and foremost Ho, white is a skin
color. There is nothing cultural about
having white skin. The term white is just
as racist and useless as attempting to
lump together a Chinese individual and a
Korean individual as "yellows," a Ja
maican individual and a Ghanan individ
ual as "blacks." Those who are consid
ered whites hail from diverse meaningful
ethnic backgrounds (Italian, German,
Russian, French, Irish, British, Slavic,
Croat, Polish, etc). These backgrounds
can add meaning to a "white" individual's
life, but having white skin does not.
"Whites" often do not "hide from the
shame of having no heritage," but have it
denied and cheapened when their her
itage is ignored in favor of a lump term
based solely on their skin color.
Ho correctly says that "I'll be the last
to say that [. . . ] non-whites can't be Re
publicans and still be true to their color."
But Belafonte has not said this. The de
cision to go to war should weigh intellec
tual, ethical, moral and religious factors.
It would be foolish to believe that Powell
or Rice did not give the decision their ut
most consideration.
It denigrates their intellect to suggest
that a rational decision on their part should
be overridden by their inherent member
ship in an ethnic group. It is an insult to
their intellectual validity to suggest that they
are "slaves" to President Bush. Belafonte
would be better served promulgating argu
ments against the war that relate to the Unit-

Ed States' international policy. In doing so
he could promote active debate. Instead he
has sold out his own intellectual integrity
and left us with nothing to ponder.

Endorsements 'seem to ignore the current
budget crisis'
I commend The Daily editorial staff for
endorsing someone other than Gray Davis
and Bill Simon for governor. However,
the endorsements on this year's proposi
tions leave much to question and seem to
ignore the current budget crisis.
The Daily's endorsements of nearly $20
billion in new bonds demonstrates the
same lack of fiscal conscience and disci
pline that the Davis administration, State
Assembly and State Senate have displayed
over the past four years. If approved, the
propositions endorsed by The Daily
would add somewhere in the neighbor
hood of $1 billion in additional bond pay
ments to a state budget that is already over
$20 billion in the red.
While I agree that these propositions
address important issues, the state simply
cannot afford them until it overcomes the
( in rent budget crisis.

Endorsements should be made earlier
As a Californian voting in my first elec
tion, I was happy to see The Daily's en-
dorsements of candidates and po
sitions on ballot measures lor the
November election. However, I
sent in my absentee ballot three
days ago, and while I read the
voter information packet, The
Daily's "election in a nutshell" cov
erage would have been much
more useful had it been published
last week. 1 applaud The Daily for
its election coverage over the past
week, but the endorsements are
helpful when given earlier in con
junction with absentee voting, a
method fairly popular among col
lege students.

It's not 'absurd to suppose
Mossad had information about
the Sept. 11 attacks'
When I first considered writing
a letter to The Daily with the
premise that criticism of the na
tional behavior of Israel does not
itself constitute anti-Semitism, I
hesitated. 1 thought this was too
obvious an assertion to make.
Surely people don't need remind
ing of this. Apparently, 112 rom her
response to my initial letter, Lisa
Singer does ('"Mossad warned
both CIA and FBI' of possible at
tacks," Nov. 4).
Had Singer taken the time to
read both my letter and the one 1

responded to, she would have
seen that my point about Mossad
is that it is not absurd to suppose,
as Amii i Baraka does in his poem
in question, that it had informa
tion about the Sept. 1 1 attacks lie
lore it occurred. Singer has pro
vided citations to support this,
and I thank her for that. Whether
or not Mossad knew more than it
revealed to the U.S. or to the
London Telegraph is hidden in
the inner sanctums of high secu
rity apparatus.
Singer also asserts that critical
analysis of Mossad or Israel some
how prevents criticism of the fail
ure of U.S. intelligence or the cul
pability of al-Qaida as primary sus
pects. It certainly does not, but it
does bring up a dynamic typical of
defenders of Israel: the "But they.
.." argument.
Whenever Israel is criticized,
the argument is given, as in Sheree
Roth's letter ("Palestinian culpabil
ity should be considered," Nov. 1)
that the actions taken by Israel
must be judged in light of the
wrongs suffered by her at the
hands of Arabs. If it is pointed out
that Israeli snipers have targeted
noncombatants, the argument
comes back, "But Palestinians first.
.." or "Arabs first..."
History tells us a great deal
about this struggle, but it does
not justify atrocities. An action
must be judged on its own terms:
Is it moral, is it fair, is it legal? And
no one should be excused from
t his examination.
But according to Singer that ex
amination is itself now forbidden i!
it involves Israel. 1 low convenient.

And how repulsive to anyone who
cherishes freedom.

'The Civil War did not free a
single African-American
from slavery'
I would like to respond to Andrea
Everett's letter to the editor, ("In de
fense of just war," Nov. 1). Everett
says that "it is wrong to so casually
dismiss the theories on just war."
Like many others, Everett brings up
iwo "just wars." They are of course
WWII and the American Civil
War. Let's examine the mantra,
"history is written by the victors." My
history classes never taught me of
people winning "unjust wars," ex
cept possibly the Cuban Revolu
tion and the Vietnam War.
There is a very small probabil
ity that it is only coincidence that
these are the only wars in which
the U.S. has not been the victor.
Being personally related to those
people who were supposedly
freed by "engaging in the Civil
War on behalf of eliminating slav
ery," I would like to express my
opinion on this particular issue.
In my opinion, the Civil War did
not free a single African-Ameri
can from slavery.
Slavery did not end because a
war started, slavery ended be
cause a war ended. And I contend
that it was not the ending of the
Civil War that ended slavery in the
U.S., but the ending of a war
against humanity. This war

against humanity was brought to
America with the first African
slaves, and ended only in name on
June 19, 1865 when the African
slaves in Texas were finally set
"free," 2 1/2 years after the Eman
cipation Proclamation was issued.
Everett says that "there are in
deed some causes worth lighting
for." I couldn't agree more. 1 say
those causes worth lighting for are:
the ending of war now and the pre
vention of all future war. I would
also like to point out that Everett
gives a short list of hypocritical rea
sons for dropping more bombs on
Iraqi people. 1 find such typical lists
veiy disturbing. They wallow to
wards the ultimate hypocrisy, one
which "just war" thinkers don't
seem to see: that a war against Iraq
will give Americans "security" and
free an oppressed people. Remov
ing the white wash, this simply
amounts to saying that killing peo
ple saves lives. I fail to see the justice.

is consistently very easy for the left to em
brace diversity in all institutions, but to re

ject diversity of ideas.
Ho has also demonstrated an igno
rance of the reality of being "white." "In a
world where everybody else has color,
they have none. In a world where every
body else has gender, they have none."
First and foremost Ho, white is a skin
color. There is nothing cultural about
having white skin. The term white is just
as racist and useless as attempting to
lump together a Chinese individual and a
Korean individual as "yellows," a Ja
maican individual and a Ghanan individ
ual as "blacks." Those who are consid
ered whites hail from diverse meaningful
ethnic backgrounds (Italian, German,
Russian, French, Irish, British, Slavic,
Croat, Polish, etc). These backgrounds
can add meaning to a "white" individual's
life, but having white skin does not.
"Whites" often do not "hide from the
shame of having no heritage," but have it
denied and cheapened when their her
itage is ignored in favor of a lump term
based solely on their skin color.
Ho correctly says that "I'll be the last
to say that [. . . ] non-whites can't be Re
publicans and still be true to their color."
But Belafonte has not said this. The de
cision to go to war should weigh intellec
tual, ethical, moral and religious factors.
It would be foolish to believe that Powell
or Rice did not give the decision their ut
most consideration.
It denigrates their intellect to suggest
that a rational decision on their part should
be overridden by their inherent member
ship in an ethnic group. It is an insult to
their intellectual validity to suggest that they
are "slaves" to President Bush. Belafonte
would be better served promulgating argu
ments against the war that relate to the Unit-

Ed States' international policy. In doing so
he could promote active debate. Instead he
has sold out his own intellectual integrity
and left us with nothing to ponder.

Endorsements 'seem to ignore the current
budget crisis'
I commend The Daily editorial staff for
endorsing someone other than Gray Davis
and Bill Simon for governor. However,
the endorsements on this year's proposi
tions leave much to question and seem to
ignore the current budget crisis.
The Daily's endorsements of nearly $20
billion in new bonds demonstrates the
same lack of fiscal conscience and disci
pline that the Davis administration, State
Assembly and State Senate have displayed
over the past four years. If approved, the
propositions endorsed by The Daily
would add somewhere in the neighbor
hood of $1 billion in additional bond pay
ments to a state budget that is already over
$20 billion in the red.
While I agree that these propositions
address important issues, the state simply
cannot afford them until it overcomes the
( in rent budget crisis.

It's not 'absurd to suppose
Mossad had information about
the Sept. 11 attacks'
When I first considered writing
a letter to The Daily with the
premise that criticism of the na
tional behavior of Israel does not
itself constitute anti-Semitism, I
hesitated. 1 thought this was too
obvious an assertion to make.
Surely people don't need remind
ing of this. Apparently, 112 rom her
response to my initial letter, Lisa
Singer does ('"Mossad warned
both CIA and FBI' of possible at
tacks," Nov. 4).
Had Singer taken the time to
read both my letter and the one 1

responded to, she would have
seen that my point about Mossad
is that it is not absurd to suppose,
as Amii i Baraka does in his poem
in question, that it had informa
tion about the Sept. 1 1 attacks lie
lore it occurred. Singer has pro
vided citations to support this,
and I thank her for that. Whether
or not Mossad knew more than it
revealed to the U.S. or to the
London Telegraph is hidden in
the inner sanctums of high secu
rity apparatus.
Singer also asserts that critical
analysis of Mossad or Israel some
how prevents criticism of the fail
ure of U.S. intelligence or the cul
pability of al-Qaida as primary sus
pects. It certainly does not, but it
does bring up a dynamic typical of
defenders of Israel: the "But they.
.." argument.
Whenever Israel is criticized,
the argument is given, as in Sheree
Roth's letter ("Palestinian culpabil
ity should be considered," Nov. 1)
that the actions taken by Israel
must be judged in light of the
wrongs suffered by her at the
hands of Arabs. If it is pointed out
that Israeli snipers have targeted
noncombatants, the argument
comes back, "But Palestinians first.
.." or "Arabs first..."
History tells us a great deal
about this struggle, but it does
not justify atrocities. An action
must be judged on its own terms:
Is it moral, is it fair, is it legal? And
no one should be excused from
t his examination.
But according to Singer that ex
amination is itself now forbidden i!
it involves Israel. 1 low convenient.

And how repulsive to anyone who
cherishes freedom.

'The Civil War did not free a
single African-American
from slavery'
I would like to respond to Andrea
Everett's letter to the editor, ("In de
fense of just war," Nov. 1). Everett
says that "it is wrong to so casually
dismiss the theories on just war."
Like many others, Everett brings up
iwo "just wars." They are of course
WWII and the American Civil
War. Let's examine the mantra,
"history is written by the victors." My
history classes never taught me of
people winning "unjust wars," ex
cept possibly the Cuban Revolu
tion and the Vietnam War.
There is a very small probabil
ity that it is only coincidence that
these are the only wars in which
the U.S. has not been the victor.
Being personally related to those
people who were supposedly
freed by "engaging in the Civil
War on behalf of eliminating slav
ery," I would like to express my
opinion on this particular issue.
In my opinion, the Civil War did
not free a single African-Ameri
can from slavery.
Slavery did not end because a
war started, slavery ended be
cause a war ended. And I contend
that it was not the ending of the
Civil War that ended slavery in the
U.S., but the ending of a war
against humanity. This war

against humanity was brought to
America with the first African
slaves, and ended only in name on
June 19, 1865 when the African
slaves in Texas were finally set
"free," 2 1/2 years after the Eman
cipation Proclamation was issued.
Everett says that "there are in
deed some causes worth lighting
for." I couldn't agree more. 1 say
those causes worth lighting for are:
the ending of war now and the pre
vention of all future war. I would
also like to point out that Everett
gives a short list of hypocritical rea
sons for dropping more bombs on
Iraqi people. 1 find such typical lists
veiy disturbing. They wallow to
wards the ultimate hypocrisy, one
which "just war" thinkers don't
seem to see: that a war against Iraq
will give Americans "security" and
free an oppressed people. Remov
ing the white wash, this simply
amounts to saying that killing peo
ple saves lives. I fail to see the justice.

Race has 'nothing to do with' decisions
concerning the possible war
In her column ("Remembering race,"
Nov. 4) Lillian Ho reiterates Harry Bela
fonte's implication that Colin Powell and
Condoleezza Rice should take a stronger
stand against the war on Iraq because of
their race. Belafonte goes so far as to call
the secretary of state a "house slave." Ho
later suggests that Rice and Powell
should ask themselves if what "being
black means to them . . . squares with
what Bush represents."
If being of African descent for either
of these people relates to their opinion
on Iraq then by all means let them con
sider it, but to label Powell a slave simply
because he embraces a divergent view
point is counter to the ideal of diversity
that the left endeavors to embrace. What
Powell has presented is a difference of
opinion. Belafonte is implying that it is
not appropriate fora man with Powell's
skin color to support the war. Personally,
my skin color had nothing to do with my
decision on the possibility of war with
Iraq. I considered national security is
sues, my own feelings on the ethics of a
proactive strategy of international secu
rity, and the history of Iraq and its re
sponse to U.N. directives.
I would hope that Powell and Belafonte
considered all of these factors, and if they
did as well consider what their ethnic his
tory meant to their internal debate on the
subject, there is nothing to be criticized in
that. But to suggest a defect in Mr. Powell
or Ms. Rice, because they arrived at an op
posite conclusion, is wrong. It seems that it
is consistently very easy for the left to em
brace diversity in all institutions, but to re

ject diversity of ideas.

It denigrates their intellect to suggest
that a rational decision on their part should
be overridden by their inherent member
ship in an ethnic group. It is an insult to
their intellectual validity to suggest that they
are "slaves" to President Bush. Belafonte
would be better served promulgating argu
ments against the war that relate to the Unit-

Ed States' international policy. In doing so
he could promote active debate. Instead he
has sold out his own intellectual integrity
and left us with nothing to ponder.

Endorsements 'seem to ignore the current
budget crisis'
I commend The Daily editorial staff for
endorsing someone other than Gray Davis
and Bill Simon for governor. However,
the endorsements on this year's proposi
tions leave much to question and seem to
ignore the current budget crisis.
The Daily's endorsements of nearly $20
billion in new bonds demonstrates the
same lack of fiscal conscience and disci
pline that the Davis administration, State
Assembly and State Senate have displayed
over the past four years. If approved, the
propositions endorsed by The Daily
would add somewhere in the neighbor
hood of $1 billion in additional bond pay
ments to a state budget that is already over
$20 billion in the red.
While I agree that these propositions
address important issues, the state simply
cannot afford them until it overcomes the
( in rent budget crisis.

Endorsements should be made earlier
As a Californian voting in my first elec
tion, I was happy to see The Daily's en-
dorsements of candidates and po
sitions on ballot measures lor the
November election. However, I
sent in my absentee ballot three
days ago, and while I read the
voter information packet, The
Daily's "election in a nutshell" cov
erage would have been much
more useful had it been published
last week. 1 applaud The Daily for
its election coverage over the past
week, but the endorsements are
helpful when given earlier in con
junction with absentee voting, a
method fairly popular among col
lege students.

It's not 'absurd to suppose
Mossad had information about
the Sept. 11 attacks'
When I first considered writing
a letter to The Daily with the
premise that criticism of the na
tional behavior of Israel does not
itself constitute anti-Semitism, I
hesitated. 1 thought this was too
obvious an assertion to make.
Surely people don't need remind
ing of this. Apparently, 112 rom her
response to my initial letter, Lisa
Singer does ('"Mossad warned
both CIA and FBI' of possible at
tacks," Nov. 4).
Had Singer taken the time to
read both my letter and the one 1

responded to, she would have
seen that my point about Mossad
is that it is not absurd to suppose,
as Amii i Baraka does in his poem
in question, that it had informa
tion about the Sept. 1 1 attacks lie
lore it occurred. Singer has pro
vided citations to support this,
and I thank her for that. Whether
or not Mossad knew more than it
revealed to the U.S. or to the
London Telegraph is hidden in
the inner sanctums of high secu
rity apparatus.
Singer also asserts that critical
analysis of Mossad or Israel some
how prevents criticism of the fail
ure of U.S. intelligence or the cul
pability of al-Qaida as primary sus
pects. It certainly does not, but it
does bring up a dynamic typical of
defenders of Israel: the "But they.
.." argument.
Whenever Israel is criticized,
the argument is given, as in Sheree
Roth's letter ("Palestinian culpabil
ity should be considered," Nov. 1)
that the actions taken by Israel
must be judged in light of the
wrongs suffered by her at the
hands of Arabs. If it is pointed out
that Israeli snipers have targeted
noncombatants, the argument
comes back, "But Palestinians first.
.." or "Arabs first..."
History tells us a great deal
about this struggle, but it does
not justify atrocities. An action
must be judged on its own terms:
Is it moral, is it fair, is it legal? And
no one should be excused from
t his examination.
But according to Singer that ex
amination is itself now forbidden i!
it involves Israel. 1 low convenient.

And how repulsive to anyone who
cherishes freedom.

'The Civil War did not free a
single African-American
from slavery'
I would like to respond to Andrea
Everett's letter to the editor, ("In de
fense of just war," Nov. 1). Everett
says that "it is wrong to so casually
dismiss the theories on just war."
Like many others, Everett brings up
iwo "just wars." They are of course
WWII and the American Civil
War. Let's examine the mantra,
"history is written by the victors." My
history classes never taught me of
people winning "unjust wars," ex
cept possibly the Cuban Revolu
tion and the Vietnam War.
There is a very small probabil
ity that it is only coincidence that
these are the only wars in which
the U.S. has not been the victor.
Being personally related to those
people who were supposedly
freed by "engaging in the Civil
War on behalf of eliminating slav
ery," I would like to express my
opinion on this particular issue.
In my opinion, the Civil War did
not free a single African-Ameri
can from slavery.
Slavery did not end because a
war started, slavery ended be
cause a war ended. And I contend
that it was not the ending of the
Civil War that ended slavery in the
U.S., but the ending of a war
against humanity. This war

against humanity was brought to
America with the first African
slaves, and ended only in name on
June 19, 1865 when the African
slaves in Texas were finally set
"free," 2 1/2 years after the Eman
cipation Proclamation was issued.
Everett says that "there are in
deed some causes worth lighting
for." I couldn't agree more. 1 say
those causes worth lighting for are:
the ending of war now and the pre
vention of all future war. I would
also like to point out that Everett
gives a short list of hypocritical rea
sons for dropping more bombs on
Iraqi people. 1 find such typical lists
veiy disturbing. They wallow to
wards the ultimate hypocrisy, one
which "just war" thinkers don't
seem to see: that a war against Iraq
will give Americans "security" and
free an oppressed people. Remov
ing the white wash, this simply
amounts to saying that killing peo
ple saves lives. I fail to see the justice.

Race has 'nothing to do with' decisions
concerning the possible war
In her column ("Remembering race,"
Nov. 4) Lillian Ho reiterates Harry Bela
fonte's implication that Colin Powell and
Condoleezza Rice should take a stronger
stand against the war on Iraq because of
their race. Belafonte goes so far as to call
the secretary of state a "house slave." Ho
later suggests that Rice and Powell
should ask themselves if what "being
black means to them . . . squares with
what Bush represents."
If being of African descent for either
of these people relates to their opinion
on Iraq then by all means let them con
sider it, but to label Powell a slave simply
because he embraces a divergent view
point is counter to the ideal of diversity
that the left endeavors to embrace. What
Powell has presented is a difference of
opinion. Belafonte is implying that it is
not appropriate fora man with Powell's
skin color to support the war. Personally,
my skin color had nothing to do with my
decision on the possibility of war with
Iraq. I considered national security is
sues, my own feelings on the ethics of a
proactive strategy of international secu
rity, and the history of Iraq and its re
sponse to U.N. directives.
I would hope that Powell and Belafonte
considered all of these factors, and if they
did as well consider what their ethnic his
tory meant to their internal debate on the
subject, there is nothing to be criticized in
that. But to suggest a defect in Mr. Powell
or Ms. Rice, because they arrived at an op
posite conclusion, is wrong. It seems that it
is consistently very easy for the left to em
brace diversity in all institutions, but to re

ject diversity of ideas.
Ho has also demonstrated an igno
rance of the reality of being "white." "In a
world where everybody else has color,
they have none. In a world where every
body else has gender, they have none."
First and foremost Ho, white is a skin
color. There is nothing cultural about
having white skin. The term white is just
as racist and useless as attempting to
lump together a Chinese individual and a
Korean individual as "yellows," a Ja
maican individual and a Ghanan individ
ual as "blacks." Those who are consid
ered whites hail from diverse meaningful
ethnic backgrounds (Italian, German,
Russian, French, Irish, British, Slavic,
Croat, Polish, etc). These backgrounds
can add meaning to a "white" individual's
life, but having white skin does not.
"Whites" often do not "hide from the
shame of having no heritage," but have it
denied and cheapened when their her
itage is ignored in favor of a lump term
based solely on their skin color.
Ho correctly says that "I'll be the last
to say that [. . . ] non-whites can't be Re
publicans and still be true to their color."
But Belafonte has not said this. The de
cision to go to war should weigh intellec
tual, ethical, moral and religious factors.
It would be foolish to believe that Powell
or Rice did not give the decision their ut
most consideration.
It denigrates their intellect to suggest
that a rational decision on their part should
be overridden by their inherent member
ship in an ethnic group. It is an insult to
their intellectual validity to suggest that they
are "slaves" to President Bush. Belafonte
would be better served promulgating argu
ments against the war that relate to the Unit-

Ed States' international policy. In doing so
