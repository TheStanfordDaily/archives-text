Race has 'nothing to do with' decisions
concerning the possible war
In her column ("Remembering race,"
Nov. 4) Lillian Ho reiterates Harry Bela
fonte's implication that Colin Powell and
Condoleezza Rice should take a stronger
stand against the war on Iraq because of
their race. Belafonte goes so far as to call
the secretary of state a "house slave." Ho
later suggests that Rice and Powell
should ask themselves if what "being
black means to them . . . squares with
what Bush represents."
If being of African descent for either
of these people relates to their opinion
on Iraq then by all means let them con
sider it, but to label Powell a slave simply
because he embraces a divergent view
point is counter to the ideal of diversity
that the left endeavors to embrace. What
Powell has presented is a difference of
opinion. Belafonte is implying that it is
not appropriate fora man with Powell's
skin color to support the war. Personally,
my skin color had nothing to do with my
decision on the possibility of war with
Iraq. I considered national security is
sues, my own feelings on the ethics of a
proactive strategy of international secu
rity, and the history of Iraq and its re
sponse to U.N. directives.
I would hope that Powell and Belafonte
considered all of these factors, and if they
did as well consider what their ethnic his
tory meant to their internal debate on the
subject, there is nothing to be criticized in
that. But to suggest a defect in Mr. Powell
or Ms. Rice, because they arrived at an op
posite conclusion, is wrong. It seems that it
is consistently very easy for the left to em
brace diversity in all institutions, but to re

ject diversity of ideas.
Ho has also demonstrated an igno
rance of the reality of being "white." "In a
world where everybody else has color,
they have none. In a world where every
body else has gender, they have none."
First and foremost Ho, white is a skin
color. There is nothing cultural about
having white skin. The term white is just
as racist and useless as attempting to
lump together a Chinese individual and a
Korean individual as "yellows," a Ja
maican individual and a Ghanan individ
ual as "blacks." Those who are consid
ered whites hail from diverse meaningful
ethnic backgrounds (Italian, German,
Russian, French, Irish, British, Slavic,
Croat, Polish, etc). These backgrounds
can add meaning to a "white" individual's
life, but having white skin does not.
"Whites" often do not "hide from the
shame of having no heritage," but have it
denied and cheapened when their her
itage is ignored in favor of a lump term
based solely on their skin color.
Ho correctly says that "I'll be the last
to say that [. . . ] non-whites can't be Re
publicans and still be true to their color."
But Belafonte has not said this. The de
cision to go to war should weigh intellec
tual, ethical, moral and religious factors.
It would be foolish to believe that Powell
or Rice did not give the decision their ut
most consideration.
It denigrates their intellect to suggest
that a rational decision on their part should
be overridden by their inherent member
ship in an ethnic group. It is an insult to
their intellectual validity to suggest that they
are "slaves" to President Bush. Belafonte
would be better served promulgating argu
ments against the war that relate to the Unit-

Ed States' international policy. In doing so
he could promote active debate. Instead he
has sold out his own intellectual integrity
and left us with nothing to ponder.

Endorsements 'seem to ignore the current
budget crisis'
I commend The Daily editorial staff for
endorsing someone other than Gray Davis
and Bill Simon for governor. However,
the endorsements on this year's proposi
tions leave much to question and seem to
ignore the current budget crisis.
The Daily's endorsements of nearly $20
billion in new bonds demonstrates the
same lack of fiscal conscience and disci
pline that the Davis administration, State
Assembly and State Senate have displayed
over the past four years. If approved, the
propositions endorsed by The Daily
would add somewhere in the neighbor
hood of $1 billion in additional bond pay
ments to a state budget that is already over
$20 billion in the red.
While I agree that these propositions
address important issues, the state simply
cannot afford them until it overcomes the
( in rent budget crisis.
