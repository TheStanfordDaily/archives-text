clude establishing and managing programs

Her Republican opponent, Joe Nixon, a
first-time candidate, admits that the scales are
not in his favor, but he says, "Stranger things
have happened."
The two candidates said they have different
views of what the important issues are for Silicon

the issues in the race as narrowly defined around
the war on terrorism, specifically around Eshoo's
votes against spending for military hardware
and against giving President Bush authorization
to use force in Iraq.
"Voting for the [Democratic sponsored]
Spratt Amendment [requiring U.N. approval for
military action] shows Eshoo hasn't got a clue
how to negotiate," Nixon said. "I'm against war
with Iraq, too. But the reason you have military
strength is so you don't have to use it."
Eshoo, in an Oct. 17 League of Women Vot
ers debate, highlighted the economy, prescrip
tion-tlrug benefits and the environment as three
of her most important issues.
Eshoo said she is proud of writing bills that
presidents from both parties have signed in sup
port of high technology, helping underinsured
and uninsured women and helping with pedi
atric drug coverage. She has worked on many
initiatives, "from the environment, to health
care, to biotechnology, all directed to the better
ment of people's lives," she said.

for California's attorney general. Lockyer, the
Democratic incumbent, seeks a second term in
which he hopes to continue building on the
work he did during his first term. Ackerman, a
Republican state senator from Orange County,
is vying for the position, claiming that Lockyer
has been doing nothing to combat corruption.
California's attorney general works through
the California Department of Justice to ensure
that state laws "are uniformly and adequately
enforced" according to the California Consti
tution. Other responsibilities of the position in
clude establishing and managing programs

Democratic district, even her opponents admit
that her seat seams relatively safe. She has
raised 14 times the amount of money her lead
ing opponent has and sits in a district which is
46 percent Democrat and 30 percent Republi
cans by registration.
Her Republican opponent, Joe Nixon, a
first-time candidate, admits that the scales are
not in his favor, but he says, "Stranger things
have happened."
The two candidates said they have different
views of what the important issues are for Silicon
Valley and Stanford voters. Nixon said he sees
the issues in the race as narrowly defined around
the war on terrorism, specifically around Eshoo's
votes against spending for military hardware
and against giving President Bush authorization
to use force in Iraq.
"Voting for the [Democratic sponsored]
Spratt Amendment [requiring U.N. approval for
military action] shows Eshoo hasn't got a clue
how to negotiate," Nixon said. "I'm against war
with Iraq, too. But the reason you have military
strength is so you don't have to use it."
Eshoo, in an Oct. 17 League of Women Vot
ers debate, highlighted the economy, prescrip
tion-tlrug benefits and the environment as three
of her most important issues.
Eshoo said she is proud of writing bills that
presidents from both parties have signed in sup
port of high technology, helping underinsured
and uninsured women and helping with pedi
atric drug coverage. She has worked on many
initiatives, "from the environment, to health
care, to biotechnology, all directed to the better

The two candidates said they have different
views of what the important issues are for Silicon
Valley and Stanford voters. Nixon said he sees
the issues in the race as narrowly defined around
the war on terrorism, specifically around Eshoo's
votes against spending for military hardware
and against giving President Bush authorization
to use force in Iraq.
"Voting for the [Democratic sponsored]
Spratt Amendment [requiring U.N. approval for
military action] shows Eshoo hasn't got a clue
how to negotiate," Nixon said. "I'm against war
with Iraq, too. But the reason you have military
strength is so you don't have to use it."
Eshoo, in an Oct. 17 League of Women Vot
ers debate, highlighted the economy, prescrip
tion-tlrug benefits and the environment as three
of her most important issues.
Eshoo said she is proud of writing bills that
presidents from both parties have signed in sup
port of high technology, helping underinsured
and uninsured women and helping with pedi
atric drug coverage. She has worked on many
initiatives, "from the environment, to health
care, to biotechnology, all directed to the better
ment of people's lives," she said.
