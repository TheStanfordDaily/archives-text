Davis lias worked hard to build a
lead in his campaign for re
election.
Davis, a Democrat, graduated
from Stanford in 1964 with a de
gree iu history and went on to
study law at Columbia, from
which he graduated in 1%7.
Prior to his governorship,
I )avis <K < upied numerous posts in
California, including lieutenant
governor, controller and state as
sembly member. I Ic also is a Viet
nam veteran who held the rank of
Captain and earned the Bronze
Star for met itorious service.

One of the tougher issues
Davis is working on this cam
paign is to separate himself
from the state-wide power out

ages that attracted national
media attention in early 2001.
Though the blackouts might
be the top concern for some vot
ers when reflecting on Davis'
tenure in office, the Davis cam
paign has tried to emphasize its
successes in other areas over the
past four years.
"Schools are more account
able," Davis said in a press release.
" Teachers are better t rained. A col
lege education is more accessible.
And here are the most important
numbers — test scores are up four
years in a row.
"We're building a brighter
future for our kids. We're turn
ing the corner on education.
And we can't afford to turn back
now."
Sanchez seconded the gover
nor's commitment to ensuring
the well-being of the state.
" There are prescription chugs
for seniors and more than a mil
lion children who did not have
insurance when the governor
started that have it now,"
Sanchez said.
