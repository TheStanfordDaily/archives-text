hi an at
tempt to get its
agenda on the
political radar,
the Green
Party is pre
senting Peter
Camejo as its
candidate for
the 2002 Cali-

fornia governor's race.
Camejo is a first generation
Venezuelan-American who "has
fought lor social and environ
mental justice since his teens,"
according to his campaign Web
site. I le studied math and histo
ry as an undergraduate at UC-
Berkeley.
I'yler Snortum-Phelps, Came
jo's campaign manager, explained
what sets Camejo and his party
apart from his opponents in the
gubernatorial rat e.
"We have always represented a
party of people," Snortum-Phelps
said. "|YVe are| lighting for peo
ple's issues while the Democrats
and Republicans represent corpo
rate issues — this is a campaign to

get those issues out there.
"Peter feels that running for
governor is the way to do that —
he feels he would make a great
governor with his business expe
rience," Snortum-Phelps contin
ued.
Among other issues, Camejo
supports ending energy-indus
try "bailouts," establishing liv
ing-wage laws, ending the death
penalty, having run-off elec
tions in statewide races, end
ing racial profiling, protecting
old-growth trees, initiating
universal health care and
strengthening public educa
tion by guaranteeing equal ac
cess to facilities and increasing
teacher pay.
Throughout the race, he has
stressed his lack of involvement
with special interests.
"My platform is what makes
me better than Simon or Davis,"
Camejo said in a press release.
" That I'm not associated with
money, not influenced by
money, makes me the best can
didate."
