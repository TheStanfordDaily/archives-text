### 
In an upset
that took
many in the
political world
by surprise,
Bill Simon de
feated his op
pon en t
Richard Rior
dan in the gu-

bernatorial primary to become
the Republican Party candidate
for governor of California. Now
Simon, a 51-year-old financier
and philanthropist from Pacific
Palisades, is poised to mount a
challenge to Democratic incum
bent Gray Davis.
After graduating from law
school at Boston College, Simon

vice-chairman of Catholic Chari

ties of Los Angeles.
In his "Blueprint to Renew

Simon urges fiscal responsibility,
educational improvements and
state-wide renewal of infrastruc
ture and resource management.
Simon has pledged to pass tax
cuts, balance the state budget, se
cure local government revenues
from state seizure and require
state-mandated projects to be
backed financially by the state to
revitalize the economy.
"Gray Davis inherited a record
budget surplus — $8 billion dol
lars — and managed to misman
age it into a record $23.6 billion
deficit," Simon said in a press re
lease. "And now he's trying to in
crease our taxes to bail himself
out of the mess he created."
Simon, according to his plat
form, intends to improve educa
tion by increasing local district
control over school policy by
lessening state oversight, reduc
ing school district and class
room sizes, and expanding
charter school programs.
