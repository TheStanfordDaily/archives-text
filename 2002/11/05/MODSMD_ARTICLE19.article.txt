### JESSICA PETERS 
According to the women's swim team's
captain, junior Tara Kirk, the duel meet in
Texas last weekend was a "see what we can
do meet." Now that the Cardinal has re
turned home with two wins to its credit, it has
become clear that it can do quite a lot.

Friday and Saturday: No. 2 Stanford 184, No. 7
Texas 169; Stanford 190, No. 8 USC 163

The competition marked the 15th con
secutive dual meet victory for the Cardinal
women. Stanford defeated No. 7Te>tks 184-
169 and triumphed over No. 8 USC- 190-
163. USC also fell to Texas 177-176.
One of the highlights of the meet was
Kirk's victory in the 100-yard breaststroke,
an event in which Kirk is undefeated in her
collegiate career. She finished the race with a
time of 1 minute, 0.69 seconds, just ahead of
her freshman teammate Kristin Caverly
(1:02.84).
In the 200-yard medley relay, Kirk also
turned in a solid race with her teammates,
junior Megan Baumgartner, sophomore
Sarah Jones and freshman Dana Kirk, as the
group placed second.
Caverly had a weekend full of significant ac
complishments, not the least of which was win
ning the 200 individual medley in 2:00.73.

She also claimed four second-place finishes,
including runner-up marks in the 100-yard
breaststroke and the 100-yard backstroke.
Sophomore Lacey Boutwell, who Stanford
women's swimming coach Richard Quick had
counted on to strengthen the Cardinal's com
petitiveness in the freestyle events, definitely
made a contribution to the team victory.
Boutwell finished first in the 200-yard
freestyle with a time of 1:49.04 and third in
the 50-yard tree, clocking in at 23.46 seconds.
Boutwell also teamed up with Dana Kirk,
sophomore Tami Ransom and Jones to take
third in the 400-yard individual medley.
Boutwell received some help in the
freestyle events from fellow sophomore
Evins Cameron, who recorded a time of
16:53.30 in the 1,650-yard free to capture
third place. Although Texas captured wins in
all four medley relays and USC's swimmers
put pressure on the Cardinal in the freestyle
events, neither team could hold off the Stan
lord swimmers after two days of competition.
1 'he Cardinal divers also had an impressive
weekend in Texas. Platform diving helped
give Stanford its first victory of the year.
Senior McKenze Murphy, a three-time
Ail-American whose diving this year had
been inconsistent with her ability until recent
practices, charted 410.45 points in her tri
umphant first-place finish on the platform.
"It may have been the best performance
I've seen from McKenze in over a year," div
ing coach Rick Schavone said.
Schavone was also pleased with the per
formances of all three divers â€” Murphy,
sophomore Ashlee Rosenthal and freshman
