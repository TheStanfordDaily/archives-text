### ERIC ELDON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford students held a can
dlelight vigil outside of the Stan
ford I lospital last night to support
hospital workers negotiating their
expiring contract with the hospital
administration.
As hospital security guards and
local news camera crews stood by,
members of the Stanford Labor
Action Coalition and other cam
pus student groups chanted
phrases like "Ain't no power like
the power of the students cuz the
power of the students won't
stop — say WHAT?"
Last Friday, hospital workers
delivered a notice to the adminis
tration that they will hold a one
day strike oil Nov. 1 •? to advocate
for higher wages and improved
conditions.
As the previous contract ex
pired last night, inside the hospi
tal, union Local 715 representa
tives and administration officials
continued to seek a compromise
on a new contract.

"Our desire at the Stanford
Hospital and the Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital is to negotiate
as long as possible to ensure a fair
and equitable contract," said
Maria LaGanga, spokesperson for
the hospital administration. "Pa
tient care is our highest priority,
and we will allow nothing to com
promise that."
Union representative Isobel
White said, "We don't know what
will happen next. Workers on the
negotiating committee are disap
pointed that in a fall lull of negoti
ations, management has made so
little progress towards addressing
their patient care concerns."
At the vigil last night, Clara
Webb, co-coordinator of the Stan
lord Labor Action Coalition, said
"Stanford workers are lighting for
the same rights that we believe
should be included in a code of
conduct that would apply to all
workers at Stanford."
At noon yesterday, workers'
