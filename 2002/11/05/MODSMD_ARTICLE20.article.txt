The No. 1 Stanford men's cross
country team makes winning look too
easy. Il simply packs its runners in the
front of the race and then pounds out
eight hard kilometers of running as its
competitors drop off one by one.
Men's Cross Country

Saturday: 1. Stanford 19; 2. Oregon 51; 3,
Arizona St. 85

And that's exactly what the Cardinal
did again last weekend, as, for the third
straight year, Stanford captured the Pa
cific-10 Conference team and individ
ual titles.
There was never any doubt that
Stanford was in control at the Pac-10
Championships in Pasadena on Satur
day. The only question left after the
Cardinal made a powerful move
around the fifth kilometer was by how
much the squad would win.
The Cardinal placed seven runners
in the top nine, scoring only 19 points to
easily defeat No. 5 Oregon. Junior
Grant Robison successfully defended
his Pac-10 tide, covering the 8,000-
meter course in 23 minutes, 27 seconds.
"The squad and all the individuals did
a remarkable job," said Vin Lananna, di
rector of cross country and track and
field. "We expected to win the race, and
there is confidence and excitement with
that. But you still have to execute it,
which I thought we did with great poise."

Following Robison to the finish line
were juniors lan Dobson and Don Sage.
Dobson pushed the pace in the final
2,000 meters and claimed second place
in 23:30. Sage out-kicked Oregon star
Jason 1 lartmann to place third in 23:36.
Rounding out the scoring for the
Cardinal were junior Adam Tenforde
(6th, 23:51) and freshman Neil Davis
(7th, 23:58).
The course was comprised of four
2,000-meter loops on the Brookside (iolf
Course next to the Rose Bowl. The Stan
ford runners sat back for the first lap but
then picked up the pace for the second. At
about 5,000 meters, Robison, Dobson and
Sage surged again to thin out the front
pack and take the 1 -2-3 sweep of the race.

"The pace went out a bit slower,
which I think benefited me," Davis said.
"I just tried to stick with the lead pack as
long as possible. It's really an amazing
experience being a scoring runner at
Pac-lOs on this team."
Lananna added, " The course was re
ally good and allowed our runners to
run fast. We haven't done much real
race preparation. Hut they all ran really
well, probably better than I was expect
ing. I think we are light where we need
to be going into the [NCAA] Champi
onships."
