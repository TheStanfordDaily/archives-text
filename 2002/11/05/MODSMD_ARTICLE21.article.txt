It may have seemed like little could make die Stanford
women's volleyball team forget about its devastating five
game loss to Southern California at home on Oct. 4 —
after all, the Cardinal had blown seven match points in
the loss. But a five-game win over USC in Saturday's re
match in Los Angeles may have just done the trick.
Women's Volleyball

Friday: No. 4 Stanford def. No. 19 UCLA 30-25, 30-27, 30-22
Saturday: Stanford def. No. 2 USC 30-26, 16-30, 26-30, 30-28,
16-14

The Cardinal (21-3, 11-2 Pacific-10 Conference)
ended the Trojans' (19-1, 12-1) undefeated season and
their reign at the top of the rankings with a 30-26,16-30,
26-30,30-28, 16-14 win in front of a standing-room only
crowd of 2,115 at the Lyon Center. Stanford also blew
past No. 19 UCLA (13-10,6-7) in three games on Friday.
The win knocked USC down a spot to No. 2 in this
week's rankings and launched Stanford from No. 6 to
No. 4. It also brought the Cardinal to within a game of
the Trojans at the top of the Pac-10 standings and re
vived Stanford's hopes of hosting one of the four region
al in the NCAA tournament.
"After the match up here, we had this feeling about
[Saturday's] match," sophomore outside hitter
Ogonna Nnamani said. "We had other matches before
then, but we had such a vivid picture of what we want
ed it to be like. Everyone rose to the occasion. When
you look to build confidence, you need evidence, and
we've got that now."
Senior outside hitter Logan Tom earned her first
Pac-10 Player of the Week nod of the season, the eighth
of her career, with a team-high 42 kills, 32 digs and
three aces over the weekend. Tom joins Natalie
Williams of UCLA as the only Pac-10 players ever to re
ceive the award eight times.
"1 like the pressure moments more, so I played better
this weekend," Tom said. "That's what the past has
shown me — it'sjust how I respond to stuff. I'd rather see
the stats spread out more."
Tom did the brunt of the damage against the Trojans
on Saturday, running off a match-high 28 kills while hit
ting at a .329 clip to help the Cardinal offset the six USC
players that finished with double-digit kill totals.
The Trojans ended up outhitting the Cardinal .257 to
.212 and out killing Stanford 89-70, mostly as a result of
the Cardinal's disastrous 30-16 second-game loss.
But the Cardinal's conference-leading blocking game
did its thing again, picking up 17 bl<xks in the match, in
cluding three late in the fourth game that brought Stan
ford back from the brink of extinction.
Down 2-1 in the match and 25-20 in the fourth game,
Stanford got a huge block solo by senior outside hitter
Lindsey Yamasaki, who had replaced senior Ashley Ivy
on the right side in the first game. A block solo by junior
setter Anna Robinson and a block by Robinson and ju
nior middle blocker Sara McGee complemented three
late kills from Tom to carry Stanford to a 30-28 win to
force a fifth game.

Junior Jenn Harvey goes up against Oregon State two weeks ago. Har
vey and the Cardinal defeated No. 1 9 UCLA and No. 2 USC in Los An
geles last weekend. It was the Women of Troy's first loss of the season.
"Eventually in every match
we've played, our block has ended
up doing more damage the longer
we play," Stanlord coach John
Dunning said. "Lindsey's block in
game four changed the match.
Within the next three or four plays,
the momentum very quickly
changed from that one play."
The Cardinal found itself down
12-10 in the decisive game, but
kills by Tom and Yamasaki swung
the final frame to Stanford. Nna
mani's 12th kill of the match
sealed a 16-14 win and the match
for the Cardinal.
Yamasaki and freshman libero

C lourtney Schultz eac:h chipped in
14 digs as Stanford matched USC
with NO in the match, a triumph
Ibr the Cardinal, which has been
trying to get its defense up to par
all season.
"'Hie last time we played [USC],
we were l< treed to realize we weren't
playing good enough defense,"
Dunning said. "That's most of what

we've practiced since then, and de
lense is probably what was the dif
ference in the match [on Friday]."
On Friday, UCLA wasn't really
able to keep up with the Cardinal
Ibr much of the match, but a big de
fensive effort by the Bruins
wreaked havoc on Stanford in the
stat box.
The Cardinal held the Bruins

to a paltry .095 hitting percent
age in the match, but a big dig
ging effort by UCLA led Stanford
to hit just .174, its lowest mark in
a winning match all season. The
Bruins outdug the Cardinal 73-
59 on the night.
"It didn't feel like we hit that
low," lorn said. "They're a good
defensive team, but it didn't feel

like that."
Tom didn't seem too fazed early
on, picking up seven of her match
high 14 kills in Stanford's 30-25
opening-game win.
After holding oil a late rally
from (he Bruins in taking the sec
ond game 30-27, Stanford cruised
to an easy 30-22 win in the third to
seal the victory.

McGee added 11 kills and was
one of four Stanford players with
four blocks in the match, as the Car
dinal outblocked the Bruins 13-7.
Stanford faces a long week
ahead of it as it hosts No. 16 Arizona
on Thursday and No. 23 Arizona
State on Friday before trying to
knock off the new No. 1 team,
Hawaii, in I lonolulu on Sunday.
