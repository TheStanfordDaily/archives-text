It may have seemed like little could make die Stanford
women's volleyball team forget about its devastating five
game loss to Southern California at home on Oct. 4 —
after all, the Cardinal had blown seven match points in
the loss. But a five-game win over USC in Saturday's re
match in Los Angeles may have just done the trick.
Women's Volleyball

Friday: No. 4 Stanford def. No. 19 UCLA 30-25, 30-27, 30-22
Saturday: Stanford def. No. 2 USC 30-26, 16-30, 26-30, 30-28,
16-14

The Cardinal (21-3, 11-2 Pacific-10 Conference)
ended the Trojans' (19-1, 12-1) undefeated season and
their reign at the top of the rankings with a 30-26,16-30,
26-30,30-28, 16-14 win in front of a standing-room only
crowd of 2,115 at the Lyon Center. Stanford also blew
past No. 19 UCLA (13-10,6-7) in three games on Friday.
The win knocked USC down a spot to No. 2 in this
week's rankings and launched Stanford from No. 6 to
No. 4. It also brought the Cardinal to within a game of
the Trojans at the top of the Pac-10 standings and re
vived Stanford's hopes of hosting one of the four region
al in the NCAA tournament.
"After the match up here, we had this feeling about
[Saturday's] match," sophomore outside hitter
Ogonna Nnamani said. "We had other matches before
then, but we had such a vivid picture of what we want
ed it to be like. Everyone rose to the occasion. When
you look to build confidence, you need evidence, and
we've got that now."
Senior outside hitter Logan Tom earned her first
Pac-10 Player of the Week nod of the season, the eighth
of her career, with a team-high 42 kills, 32 digs and
three aces over the weekend. Tom joins Natalie
Williams of UCLA as the only Pac-10 players ever to re
ceive the award eight times.
"1 like the pressure moments more, so I played better
this weekend," Tom said. "That's what the past has
shown me — it'sjust how I respond to stuff. I'd rather see
the stats spread out more."
Tom did the brunt of the damage against the Trojans
on Saturday, running off a match-high 28 kills while hit
ting at a .329 clip to help the Cardinal offset the six USC
players that finished with double-digit kill totals.
The Trojans ended up outhitting the Cardinal .257 to
.212 and out killing Stanford 89-70, mostly as a result of
the Cardinal's disastrous 30-16 second-game loss.
But the Cardinal's conference-leading blocking game
did its thing again, picking up 17 bl<xks in the match, in
cluding three late in the fourth game that brought Stan
ford back from the brink of extinction.
Down 2-1 in the match and 25-20 in the fourth game,
Stanford got a huge block solo by senior outside hitter
Lindsey Yamasaki, who had replaced senior Ashley Ivy
on the right side in the first game. A block solo by junior
setter Anna Robinson and a block by Robinson and ju
nior middle blocker Sara McGee complemented three
late kills from Tom to carry Stanford to a 30-28 win to
force a fifth game.
