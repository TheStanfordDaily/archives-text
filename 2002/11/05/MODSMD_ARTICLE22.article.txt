# Women's cross country leaves Pac-10s with title
## 
### ERIK SPERLING STAFF WRITER 
In the world of multimillionaire profes
sional sports, athletes give quotes like " I real
ly wanted to give 110 percent for the team
today," while simultaneously scribbling the
details of a contract renegotiation behind
their back.
In cross country running, the same selfless
dedication to the team comes through in the
athletes' quotes, but in this case, the truth is
more than skin deep.
For example, after finishing ninth ;it the
Pre-NCAA meet, senior Malindi Elmore was
asked about her race. I ler response included
a brief sentence on how excited she was about
her finish, but it was quickly followed by, "For
me, it's really about how I can foc us on con-

trilniting to the team."
This team approach has worked very well
for the No. 2 Cardinal so far, and it once
again helped Stanford prevail at the Pacilic
-10 Championships last weekend at the
BrooksideColK lonrse in Pasadena. Hie win
marked the seventh consecutive year that the
Cardinal has won the conference title.
The( '.ardinal scored 23 points to comfort
ably defeat Arizona State (59) and Washing
ton (79). Stanford is now undefeated
through six races.
The ('.ardinal was led In sophomore Sara
Bei, who notched lut fourth indi
vidual race win of the season. Bei
covered the 0,000-metcrcourse in a
time of 19 minutes, 48 seconds.
I hroughout the year, the trio of
Bei, senior Lauren Fleshman and
sophomore Alicia Craig have been
inseparable at the front of the field,
and this race was no exception.
Fleshman finished a few steps be
hind Bei in 19:50, while Craig fin
ished 4th in 21:10. Elmore (T»tli,
20:25) and senior Erin Sullivan
(I 1 tli, 21:14) rounded out the scor
ing lor the (lardinal.
"Our team is exceptionally
strong this year," Fleshman said.
"Our team is loaded with seniors
who take pride in the fact that we
haven't lost a Pac-10 title since be
fore we were recruited, and we are
stocked with young talent who are
eager to contribute to raising the
bar even higher.
"We wanted to demonstrate
how important it is to us to bring a
title home not only for | Stanford],
but for the women that set the stan
dard for us years before."
The Pac-10 meet has a much
different feel than some of the
larger invitationals. In an impor
tant invitational where MO or more
teams are racing, a slow opening
mile can result in being caught be
hind literally hundreds of run
ners. But since the field at Pac-lOs
is limited to 70 runners — seven
on each team — t he athletes can af
ford to start the race at a more con
servative pace.
"It worked out perfectly in
Pasadena," Bei said. "We were able
to go out conservatively and control
the race by being in the lead from
the beginning."
Bei, a former high school na
tional champion, has taken the col
legiate cross country world by
storm. After a solid freshman year,
she has stepped up considerably
this year, taking victories at the Cal
State-Fullerton Invitational on
Aug. SI, the 6,000-meter event at
the Stanford Invitational in Sep
tember, the Notre Dame Invita
tional on C)ct, 4 and now the Pac-10
(championships.
As is the norm for the Stanford

runners, Bei's primary goal for the
season is that the team stands on the
top step of the podium at N(l\As.
But at some point, no amount of
encouragement during training
runs or races can substitute for each
runner racing as well as she can.
" I lie main objective is to win as a
team," Bei said. "But a crosscoun
try team wins by the sum of individ
ual efforts. We each have to be ac

countable to each other and do our
part. For me, that means 1 need to
be a contender at the NGAAs.
"At the beginning of the sum
mer, I decided that it was my goal to
win the NCAAs, and in doing so,
lead our team to a victory."
Stanford has next weekend off
before racing in the NCAA Western
Regional at the Stanford Golf
Course on Nov. 16.

ford to start the race at a more con
servative pace.
"It worked out perfectly in
Pasadena," Bei said. "We were able
to go out conservatively and control
the race by being in the lead from
the beginning."
Bei, a former high school na
tional champion, has taken the col
legiate cross country world by
storm. After a solid freshman year,
she has stepped up considerably
this year, taking victories at the Cal
State-Fullerton Invitational on
Aug. SI, the 6,000-meter event at
the Stanford Invitational in Sep
tember, the Notre Dame Invita
tional on C)ct, 4 and now the Pac-10
(championships.
As is the norm for the Stanford

runners, Bei's primary goal for the
season is that the team stands on the
top step of the podium at N(l\As.
But at some point, no amount of
encouragement during training
runs or races can substitute for each
runner racing as well as she can.
" I lie main objective is to win as a
team," Bei said. "But a crosscoun
try team wins by the sum of individ
ual efforts. We each have to be ac

countable to each other and do our
part. For me, that means 1 need to
be a contender at the NGAAs.
"At the beginning of the sum
mer, I decided that it was my goal to
win the NCAAs, and in doing so,
lead our team to a victory."
Stanford has next weekend off
before racing in the NCAA Western
Regional at the Stanford Golf
Course on Nov. 16.

The Stanford women's cross country team captured its seventh straight Pac
-10 title last weekend with a first-place finish at the Pac-10 Championships in
Pasadena.
In the world of multimillionaire profes
sional sports, athletes give quotes like " I real
ly wanted to give 110 percent for the team
today," while simultaneously scribbling the
details of a contract renegotiation behind
their back.
In cross country running, the same selfless
dedication to the team comes through in the
athletes' quotes, but in this case, the truth is
more than skin deep.
For example, after finishing ninth ;it the
Pre-NCAA meet, senior Malindi Elmore was
asked about her race. I ler response included
a brief sentence on how excited she was about
her finish, but it was quickly followed by, "For
me, it's really about how I can foc us on con-

Women's Cross Country

Saturday: 1. Stanford 23; 2. Arizona St. 59; 3
Washington 79

trilniting to the team."
This team approach has worked very well
for the No. 2 Cardinal so far, and it once
again helped Stanford prevail at the Pacilic
-10 Championships last weekend at the
BrooksideColK lonrse in Pasadena. Hie win
marked the seventh consecutive year that the
Cardinal has won the conference title.
The( '.ardinal scored 23 points to comfort
ably defeat Arizona State (59) and Washing
ton (79). Stanford is now undefeated
through six races.
The ('.ardinal was led In sophomore Sara
Bei, who notched lut fourth indi
vidual race win of the season. Bei
covered the 0,000-metcrcourse in a
time of 19 minutes, 48 seconds.
I hroughout the year, the trio of
Bei, senior Lauren Fleshman and
sophomore Alicia Craig have been
inseparable at the front of the field,
and this race was no exception.
Fleshman finished a few steps be
hind Bei in 19:50, while Craig fin
ished 4th in 21:10. Elmore (T»tli,
20:25) and senior Erin Sullivan
(I 1 tli, 21:14) rounded out the scor
ing lor the (lardinal.
"Our team is exceptionally
strong this year," Fleshman said.
"Our team is loaded with seniors
who take pride in the fact that we
haven't lost a Pac-10 title since be
fore we were recruited, and we are
stocked with young talent who are
eager to contribute to raising the
bar even higher.
"We wanted to demonstrate
how important it is to us to bring a
title home not only for | Stanford],
but for the women that set the stan
dard for us years before."
The Pac-10 meet has a much
different feel than some of the
larger invitationals. In an impor
tant invitational where MO or more
teams are racing, a slow opening
mile can result in being caught be
hind literally hundreds of run
ners. But since the field at Pac-lOs
is limited to 70 runners — seven
on each team — t he athletes can af
ford to start the race at a more con
servative pace.
"It worked out perfectly in
Pasadena," Bei said. "We were able
to go out conservatively and control
the race by being in the lead from
the beginning."
