# Ode to the (un)wise media

One of the truly great things about
sports media, whether it Ik- print,
radio or television, is the free li
cense it provides to make woeful
ly exaggerated comments with no need for
accuracy or factual basis. It's the defining
characteristic that sets the sports commenta
tor at a level far above his lowly regular news
peers on the journalistic hierarchy. Not only
is the use of blanket superlative expressions
accepted, but it is encouraged and hand
somely rewarded.
Take for instance the halftime tribute that
took place at the Stanford / Arizona football
game a few weeks ago. I lie stadium an
nouncer launched into a five-minute tribute
to a former Stanford quarterback who ap
parcntly made quite a name for himself'run
ning the new T-formation oflense installed
by the coach. The name of both the quarter
back and the coach at the time escape me,

/
and with good cause.
Though I 'm sure they were
great fellas who were inno
vative and successful, the)
really aren't all that memo
rable in the annals of col
lege football history.
Hut the true sports
media personality does not
let a triviality such as this

deter him from capturing his subject in the
most dramatic, alluring light possible, and
the stadium announcer on this day was up
to the task and then some. Not only did he
mention old what s-his-name as one of the
greatest college quarterbacks to ever play
the position, but he went on to declare that
"the decision by coach [insert name here| to
use [insert other name herej as his quarter*
