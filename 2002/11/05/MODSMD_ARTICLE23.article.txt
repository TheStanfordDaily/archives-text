# Ode to the (un)wise media

One of the truly great things about
sports media, whether it Ik- print,
radio or television, is the free li
cense it provides to make woeful
ly exaggerated comments with no need for
accuracy or factual basis. It's the defining
characteristic that sets the sports commenta
tor at a level far above his lowly regular news
peers on the journalistic hierarchy. Not only
is the use of blanket superlative expressions
accepted, but it is encouraged and hand
somely rewarded.
Take for instance the halftime tribute that
took place at the Stanford / Arizona football
game a few weeks ago. I lie stadium an
nouncer launched into a five-minute tribute
to a former Stanford quarterback who ap
parcntly made quite a name for himself'run
ning the new T-formation oflense installed
by the coach. The name of both the quarter
back and the coach at the time escape me,

/
and with good cause.
Though I 'm sure they were
great fellas who were inno
vative and successful, the)
really aren't all that memo
rable in the annals of col
lege football history.
Hut the true sports
media personality does not
let a triviality such as this

deter him from capturing his subject in the
most dramatic, alluring light possible, and
the stadium announcer on this day was up
to the task and then some. Not only did he
mention old what s-his-name as one of the
greatest college quarterbacks to ever play
the position, but he went on to declare that
"the decision by coach [insert name here| to
use [insert other name herej as his quarter*


s Ryan Stewart
back in the new offense was, with
out question, the single most im
portant decision by any coach in
the history of football."
Those words were actually stat
ed. In public. In a non-joking man
ner. Now, even though I hate to go
against the word of the omniscient
public-address announcer, I think I
could probably rack my brain and
come up with a question or two as to
whether or not that actually was the
single most important decision in
football history.
But did I raise my voice and
shout down the announcement?
Did I march up to the announcer
booth and demand to see evidence
to back up this claim? Did I sum
mon up the guts to initiate conver
sation with the cute girl that caught
me staring at her in the second
quarter? The answer to all three is
no, and the reason is simple. When
it comes to information we hear
from the sporting media, much like
with the opposite sex, we take their
signals to be time-tested facts that
cannot and should not be disputed,
like gravity.
This is why Jim Nantz has a job.
We sit entranced as he uses that sub
tle golden voice and boyish charis
ma, and we nod in agreement when
he informs us that The Masters golf
tournament is "a tradition unlike
any other."
When you think about it, it's
really not. It's a golf tournament.
At a fancy country club in Geor
gia where they don't allow
women (By the way, why would
guys pay thousands of dollars to
hang out at a place where they
don't allow women? You can do
that for free in prison). They do it
every year, around the same time
of the year, just like all the other
golf tournaments.
Now mass cult suit ides â€” that
would be a tradition unlike any
other. Or the annual Mike Tyson
Women and Earlobes Fun-Strava
ganza. That would certainly at
least be up thereon the list. But the
Masters, that's like a lot of other
things. Yet when Jim Nantz tells
me it's unlike any other, I don't
question him.

This is also why John Madden
makes $5 million a year. Fora f<x>t
ball expert, Madden will rarely, if
ever, give you information that you
do not already have. He just says it
in an exaggerated and seemingly
informed way which leaves you
pondering how deep and insightful
his commentary is.
For example, when he rattles off
a comment like, "The single most
important thing the offense needs
to do is score touchdowns." This is
information we already have. The
networks do not need to whore out
their advertising time to the An
heuser-Busch family in order to
fund such scientific break
throughs, but they do, and we tune
in for more. Because until a sports
broadcaster says it, how can we be
sure it's true?
It's even okay fora sports an
nouncer to draw out the scope of
his subject to make it seem that
much more impressive than it re
ally is. Like saying that Emmitt
Smith has rushed for more yards
than any human being since the
dawn of time. Okay granted, it
may be true, but did we really
need to bring Cro-Magnon man
into the debate? Perhaps they jus
tified it by referring to Genesis
2:13 which states "And on the
22nd day, God said, 'Let there be
a sophisticated statistical tracking
system tlialt shall recordeth rush
ing yards.' "
It is all too unfortunate that other
genres of news do not have the same
dramatic license granted the sports
media. 1 bet ABC never would have
tried to replace fed Koppel's
Nighdine with Letterman if Teddy
K had the same privilege as his co
horts on Monday Night Football.
" Tonight, on Nightline, the sin
gle most important development
since the dawn of man. The United
States Postal Service, in a move that
will, without question, have dire
global economic ramifications,
raised the price of first-class postage
by three cents. I'his story and much
more, right after a word from our
sponsor, Anheuser-Busch."

Ryan Stewart is a senior majoring in eco
nomics, and he is, without question, tak
ing J nil advantage of the fact that he can
make completely factless and unjustified
statement's in his columns. He can he
