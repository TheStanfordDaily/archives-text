Editors Note: This article is the sixth in a weekly series investi
gating the relationship between the Stanford community and the
potential war in Iraq.

The potential military conflict with Iraq will likely be a
lop issue lor Stan lord students at poll booths today. 1 low
ever, although the debate about war against Iraq has the
potential to be a deciding factor in several campaign
races, a low voter turnout may keep the Iraq issue from
factoring into the election results as heavily as it might
have otherwise.
An overwhelming majority — approximately 75 per
cent — of the 25 people approached by The Daily about
how Iraq would affect their voting said they did not in
tend to participate at all in this year's elections.
Sophomore Jon Chou explained that he has been too
caught up with school to be involved.
"I don't know enough about the issues to vote this
year," Chou said.
Numerous students said they agreed that their busy
schedules have inhibited their participation.
"1 want to vote," said Jason I lom, a sophomore. "But
I unfortunately missed the registration deadline."
1 lowever, out of the minority of Stanford community
members who said they were planning to vote, most
agree that the prospect of a war against Iraq has been a
crucial consideration.
"Of course the prospect of going to war with Iraq will
ailed my voting," said Deena Skolnick, a senior. "This is
an important issue to me, especially because it has major
repercussions lor life in the U.S. and around the world.
This is something that 1 believe needs to be a key issue in
this year's campaigns, and I am going to vote for the c an
didates who share my views.
