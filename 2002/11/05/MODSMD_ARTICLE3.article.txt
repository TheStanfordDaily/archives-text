# Voters cast ballots with Iraq in mind
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Editors Note: This article is the sixth in a weekly series investi
gating the relationship between the Stanford community and the
potential war in Iraq.

The potential military conflict with Iraq will likely be a
lop issue lor Stan lord students at poll booths today. 1 low
ever, although the debate about war against Iraq has the
potential to be a deciding factor in several campaign
races, a low voter turnout may keep the Iraq issue from
factoring into the election results as heavily as it might
have otherwise.
An overwhelming majority — approximately 75 per
cent — of the 25 people approached by The Daily about
how Iraq would affect their voting said they did not in
tend to participate at all in this year's elections.
Sophomore Jon Chou explained that he has been too
caught up with school to be involved.
"I don't know enough about the issues to vote this
year," Chou said.
Numerous students said they agreed that their busy
schedules have inhibited their participation.
"1 want to vote," said Jason I lom, a sophomore. "But
I unfortunately missed the registration deadline."
1 lowever, out of the minority of Stanford community
members who said they were planning to vote, most
agree that the prospect of a war against Iraq has been a
crucial consideration.
"Of course the prospect of going to war with Iraq will
ailed my voting," said Deena Skolnick, a senior. "This is
an important issue to me, especially because it has major
repercussions lor life in the U.S. and around the world.
This is something that 1 believe needs to be a key issue in
this year's campaigns, and I am going to vote for the c an
didates who share my views.
"Additionally, it makes me
more likely to vote than 1 would he
otherwise, because this is such a
crucial issue for all of our lives,"
she added.
Ross Perlin, a sophomore, said
that "in any case when possible I
am voting for candidates who op
pose the war in Iraq. The war re
flects the worst tendencies in
American governance, in imperi
alist excess, and will only end in
trouble."
For some, the choice is more
complex than just who shares their
views.
"1 voted for candidates who
were anti-war, or more likely to be
anti-war," said Kniily Pew, a ju
nior. "But I also voted for candi
dates who had a chance to win. I
fear that if the anti-war movement
backs too many small-time inde
pendent candidates, the votes for
peace may be split."
Other students explained that
they have been wrestling with in
decision over the various Iraq ar
guments.
"While instinctively I am
against war in almost all situa
tions, the situation in Iraq has put
me in a sort of quandary," said
Juliet Frerking, a sophomore. "I
feel strongly that the U.S. has yet
to explore all the differing av
enues of deterrence and, per
haps, the Bush administration
has been goaded into bellicose ac
tions due to the more militaristic
members of the staff. . .The
U.S. has a certain responsibility
as the sole superpower to consid
er the long-range implications of
its actions."
Though not completely sure
about whether or not to go to war,
Frerking emphasized that uncer
tainty is no reason to not partici
pate in elections.
"I think that the worst response
to the situation in Iraq is for citi
zens not to vote," Frerking said.
"To simply become disheartened
and disinterested in the political
process effectively forfeits our
right to hold our elected officials
responsible."
Calvin Miaw, senior and co-co
ordinator of the Stanford Com
munity for Peace and Justice, said
that his group has been vocal
about the war issue.
"We oppose pre-emptive mili
tary strikes," Miaw said. "I'm not
sure how the issue will affect voter
turnout. Certainly many individu
als have felt disempowered by
their congressional representa
tives' lack of response to their voic
es, but I'm not sure if that will af
fect turnout."
Josh Benson, a senior and edi
tor of the Stanford Progressive, ex
plained that the newspaper has
not taken an official position on
Iraq.
"In general, we think our
[paper's] presence on campus in
creases the salience of politics —
makes political issues more rele
vant," Benson said. "Hopefully
that gets people thinking about
these issues enough that they'll go
the polls on Tuesday. We definite
ly timed our first issue of the year
to come out right before the elec
tion — it was distributed this
weekend."
Stanford student government
has been strongly involved with
voting on campus, according to
its participants, even though it
has not taken any specific stances
on issues.

" I'he ASSU is motivating and
helping individuals to vote," said
Bo Cowgill, a senior and ASSU
senate chair. "We have staffed
voter registration tables and held
non-partisan events to help in
form students about the upcom
ing candidates and major issues."
ASSU President Monica Hcn
estroza seconded Cowgill's sen
timents.
"[The ASSU's] efforts are di
rected to making sure that Stan
ford students realize that they can
make a difference at the polls, and
that it is therefore important that
they exercise their right to vote,"
I lenestroza said.
(lowgill said he thought that the
war with Iraq is likely to encourage
students to vote.
"There are a lot of extremely
passionate voices speaking on the
subject," Cowgill said. "They want
to be heard."
Students said that certain
races — such as the gubernatorial
challenge between Cray Davis, Bill
Simon and third party
candidates — are not likely to be
influenced by the Iracj question.
I lowever, one particular race in
which the balance may ride on
Iraq is the local campaign for the
14th Congressional District in the
U.S. I louse of Representatives.
Joe Nixon, a Republican candi
date for the Congress seal, has crit
icized Democratic incumbent
Anna Eshoo and her lac k of sup
port for President Bush's war res
olution regarding Iraq.
"Eshoo has been totally cataton
ic on national security," Nixon said
at an ASSU "Get Out The Vote
2002" event last Sunday evening.
Eshoo had a reply ready for
Nixon.
"The resolution emphasizes
preemption over deterrence and
unilateralism over multilateral
ism," Eshoo said at the forum. "It
will get directly in the way of our
war on terror."
Although students registered in
Stanford's district are voting in
only one campaign where Iraq is a
prominent issue, students regis
tered in other districts across the
nation are voting, through absen
tee ballots, on rac es with key senate
and house seats at stake, in these
races, issues surrounding Iraq
weigh more heavily.
Shanto Iyengar, a professor of
communication, explained how
the political parties' media cam
paigns may affect the public's im
pressions of their stances on the
war.
"All sorts of media campaigns
are being run by all sorts of candi
dates," Iyengar said. "The 'sup
port the president' message is
quite prominent in key congres
sional races where it is being used
against Democrats. In general, the
Republicans have positioned
themselves as the party that is
tough on terrorism and regimes
that foster terrorism."
Iyengar said that while an indi
vidual may uphold a specific posi
tion on the Iraq issue, how the Iraq
issue lines up in the voter's hierar
chy of concerns may be more deci
sive in the end.
"Voters who think [attacking]
Iraq is the number one issue will
likely vote Republican," Iyengar
said. "Those who think the econ
omy is the overriding issue will
likely vote Democratic.
"During the Gulf War, Bush
Sr.'s popularity was at 90
percent — following the war,
after a couple months of being hit
by the 'it's the economy, stupid'
slogan, his popularity was around
40 percent."

The potential military conflict with Iraq will likely be a
lop issue lor Stan lord students at poll booths today. 1 low
ever, although the debate about war against Iraq has the
potential to be a deciding factor in several campaign
races, a low voter turnout may keep the Iraq issue from
factoring into the election results as heavily as it might
have otherwise.
An overwhelming majority — approximately 75 per
cent — of the 25 people approached by The Daily about
how Iraq would affect their voting said they did not in
tend to participate at all in this year's elections.
Sophomore Jon Chou explained that he has been too
caught up with school to be involved.
"I don't know enough about the issues to vote this
year," Chou said.
Numerous students said they agreed that their busy
schedules have inhibited their participation.
"1 want to vote," said Jason I lom, a sophomore. "But
I unfortunately missed the registration deadline."
1 lowever, out of the minority of Stanford community
members who said they were planning to vote, most
agree that the prospect of a war against Iraq has been a
crucial consideration.
"Of course the prospect of going to war with Iraq will
ailed my voting," said Deena Skolnick, a senior. "This is
an important issue to me, especially because it has major
repercussions lor life in the U.S. and around the world.
This is something that 1 believe needs to be a key issue in
this year's campaigns, and I am going to vote for the c an

"Additionally, it makes me
more likely to vote than 1 would he
otherwise, because this is such a
crucial issue for all of our lives,"
she added.
Ross Perlin, a sophomore, said
that "in any case when possible I
am voting for candidates who op
pose the war in Iraq. The war re
flects the worst tendencies in
American governance, in imperi
alist excess, and will only end in
trouble."
For some, the choice is more
complex than just who shares their
views.
"1 voted for candidates who
were anti-war, or more likely to be
anti-war," said Kniily Pew, a ju
nior. "But I also voted for candi
dates who had a chance to win. I
fear that if the anti-war movement
backs too many small-time inde
pendent candidates, the votes for
peace may be split."
Other students explained that
they have been wrestling with in
decision over the various Iraq ar
guments.
"While instinctively I am
against war in almost all situa
tions, the situation in Iraq has put
me in a sort of quandary," said
Juliet Frerking, a sophomore. "I
feel strongly that the U.S. has yet
to explore all the differing av
enues of deterrence and, per
haps, the Bush administration
has been goaded into bellicose ac
tions due to the more militaristic
members of the staff. . .The
U.S. has a certain responsibility
as the sole superpower to consid
er the long-range implications of
its actions."
Though not completely sure
about whether or not to go to war,
Frerking emphasized that uncer
tainty is no reason to not partici
pate in elections.
"I think that the worst response
to the situation in Iraq is for citi
zens not to vote," Frerking said.
"To simply become disheartened

responsible."
Calvin Miaw, senior and co-co

Josh Benson, a senior and edi

not taken an official position on
Iraq.
"In general, we think our
[paper's] presence on campus in

that gets people thinking about

I lowever, one particular race in
which the balance may ride on
Iraq is the local campaign for the
14th Congressional District in the
U.S. I louse of Representatives.
Joe Nixon, a Republican candi

Anna Eshoo and her lac k of sup

at an ASSU "Get Out The Vote

Eshoo had a reply ready for
Nixon.
"The resolution emphasizes

Although students registered in
Stanford's district are voting in
only one campaign where Iraq is a
prominent issue, students regis

nation are voting, through absen

races, issues surrounding Iraq
weigh more heavily.
Shanto Iyengar, a professor of

Although students registered in
Stanford's district are voting in
only one campaign where Iraq is a
prominent issue, students regis
tered in other districts across the
nation are voting, through absen
tee ballots, on rac es with key senate

races, issues surrounding Iraq
weigh more heavily.
Shanto Iyengar, a professor of
communication, explained how
the political parties' media cam
paigns may affect the public's im
pressions of their stances on the
war.
"All sorts of media campaigns
are being run by all sorts of candi
dates," Iyengar said. "The 'sup
port the president' message is
quite prominent in key congres
sional races where it is being used
against Democrats. In general, the
Republicans have positioned
themselves as the party that is
tough on terrorism and regimes
that foster terrorism."
Iyengar said that while an indi
vidual may uphold a specific posi
tion on the Iraq issue, how the Iraq
issue lines up in the voter's hierar
chy of concerns may be more deci
sive in the end.
"Voters who think [attacking]
Iraq is the number one issue will
likely vote Republican," Iyengar
said. "Those who think the econ
omy is the overriding issue will
likely vote Democratic.
"During the Gulf War, Bush
Sr.'s popularity was at 90
percent — following the war,
after a couple months of being hit
by the 'it's the economy, stupid'
slogan, his popularity was around
40 percent."
