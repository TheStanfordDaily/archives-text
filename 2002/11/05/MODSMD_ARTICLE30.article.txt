I he Stanford crew team fin
ished strong on Sunday at the
Newport Autumn Rowing Festival
in Newport Reach, Calif. 1 he var
sity men concluded their (all sea
son with first- and third-place fin
ishes, and the novice women raced
for the first time, placing eighth
out of 20 teams.

Crew
Saturday: Lightweight women finish
first; Novice women finish eighth; Var
sity men finish first
The Stanford lightweight
women also showed their mettle in
the Women's Open Eight catego
ry, coming in first among light
weight boats and 12 boats overall.
According to men's head coach
(Iraig Amerkhanian, the team was
just as focused as most profession
al rowers last weekend. After a
seven-hour road trip which start
ed at 6 a.m. on Saturday, the low
ers rigged the boats within 10
minutes and had a 12-mile prac
tice row.
"What was great about this
weekend was how Stanford trav
eled," Amerkhanian said.
On Sunday morning, the
men's and women's races,
scheduled for 8 a.m., were de

layed for almost two hours by
heavy fog. Amerkhanian de
scribed the wait as similar lo a
rain delay in baseball.
"They're chomping on the bit
to go and it's like, 'No, guys, you
have to wait another half-hour, an
other hall-hour, another hall
bom," he said.
The fog delay also contributed
to changes in the racecourse con
dition as the races began with the
outgoing tide.
"It wasn't quite as fast as we would
have liked," Amerkhanian said.
rhe lightweight women, howev
er, took advantage of the time delav.
"ft was great because they got to
sleep in a little bit longer," said
women's lightweight coach A1
Acosta. "They slept in the vans."
After the fog dissipated, the
men were the first to test the New
port waters. Stanford A led the
field with UC-Davis 15 seconds be
hind and Stanford Bin the middle
of the 23-boat pack. During the
course of the race, Stanford A in
creased its distance from Davis
while Stanford B worked through
the field.
l'he final times for the top three
were Stanford A, 14 minutes 40
seconds; Davis A, 14:57; and Stan
ford B 15:85.
"Davis rowed a spirited race,"
Amerkhanian said. "4'hey showed
their measure. I hey showed their

tenacity.
Starting tor the first time in the
Newport Women's Open Kight di
vision, the lightweights also had a
successful race.
" This is the first time we've
raced in this event in the varsity
event," Acosta said."()ur coxswain
steered a really good course, and
we were just lucky nobody got in
our way as she went around
turns."
The race was not without prob
lems however, as the lightweights
discovered that the cox box was
not reading any stroke rates a cou
ple of minutes before the race
started.
"Our cox box wasn't working,
so our stroke had to set a consis
tent pace, about a 28 [strokes per
minute]," said six-seat (lady
kintner. " There was a little an
nouncement from the stern,
'Guys, follow Kristina [Peterson,
the stroke].' "
But Kintner said that the most
memorable moment was a call by
coxswain Marcela Delgado for the
new rowers in the bow.
"Marcela, the coxswain, called a
power 10 for the freshmen, and
the boat picked up like you
wouldn't believe," Kintner said. "1
think I even smiled, I was so proud
of them."
Acosta said that the goal for the
boat was to close the gap between

the California lightweights, which
had beaten Stanford last weekend.
Cal was three places, or about 40
seconds, ahead at the start, but by
the final stretch of the race, the
Cardinal had caught up to the
Golden Bears.
" They caught them just as they
crossed the finish line," Acosta
said. "Our bow was overlapping
their stern."
Stanford finished behind UC-

Irvine with a time of 18:36, al
most 30 seconds ahead of the Cal
lightweights.
Later in the day, the Stanford
women's novice team tested its
new rowing skills for the first
time. Starting fourth in a field of
20, the novice achieved its goal of
not being passed from behind.
The novice finished eighth over
all with a time of 19:37, 23 sec
onds behind Davis.

Novice coach Carrie Davis said
that she was pleased by the Cardi
nal's performance. In the same
race, the novice lightweights fin
ished 19th with a time of 21:13.
The novice will race again in two
weeks at the Blair Island Fall Re
gatta in San Mateo, Calif .
The Newport regatta was the
last liill race for both lightweight
and men's teams. They will re
sume racing in the spring.

The Stanford lightweight
women also showed their mettle in
the Women's Open Eight catego
ry, coming in first among light
weight boats and 12 boats overall.
According to men's head coach
(Iraig Amerkhanian, the team was
just as focused as most profession
al rowers last weekend. After a
seven-hour road trip which start
ed at 6 a.m. on Saturday, the low
ers rigged the boats within 10
minutes and had a 12-mile prac
tice row.
"What was great about this
weekend was how Stanford trav
eled," Amerkhanian said.
On Sunday morning, the
men's and women's races,
scheduled for 8 a.m., were de

layed for almost two hours by
heavy fog. Amerkhanian de
scribed the wait as similar lo a
rain delay in baseball.
"They're chomping on the bit
to go and it's like, 'No, guys, you
have to wait another half-hour, an
other hall-hour, another hall
bom," he said.
The fog delay also contributed
to changes in the racecourse con
dition as the races began with the
outgoing tide.
"It wasn't quite as fast as we would
have liked," Amerkhanian said.
rhe lightweight women, howev
er, took advantage of the time delav.
"ft was great because they got to
sleep in a little bit longer," said
women's lightweight coach A1
Acosta. "They slept in the vans."
After the fog dissipated, the
men were the first to test the New
port waters. Stanford A led the
field with UC-Davis 15 seconds be
hind and Stanford Bin the middle
of the 23-boat pack. During the
course of the race, Stanford A in
creased its distance from Davis
while Stanford B worked through
the field.
l'he final times for the top three
were Stanford A, 14 minutes 40
seconds; Davis A, 14:57; and Stan
ford B 15:85.
"Davis rowed a spirited race,"
Amerkhanian said. "4'hey showed
their measure. I hey showed their

tenacity.
Starting tor the first time in the
Newport Women's Open Kight di
vision, the lightweights also had a
successful race.
" This is the first time we've
raced in this event in the varsity
event," Acosta said."()ur coxswain
steered a really good course, and
we were just lucky nobody got in
our way as she went around
turns."
The race was not without prob
lems however, as the lightweights
discovered that the cox box was
not reading any stroke rates a cou
ple of minutes before the race
started.
"Our cox box wasn't working,
so our stroke had to set a consis
tent pace, about a 28 [strokes per
minute]," said six-seat (lady
kintner. " There was a little an
nouncement from the stern,
'Guys, follow Kristina [Peterson,
the stroke].' "
But Kintner said that the most
memorable moment was a call by
coxswain Marcela Delgado for the
new rowers in the bow.
"Marcela, the coxswain, called a
power 10 for the freshmen, and
the boat picked up like you
wouldn't believe," Kintner said. "1
think I even smiled, I was so proud
of them."
Acosta said that the goal for the
boat was to close the gap between

the California lightweights, which
had beaten Stanford last weekend.
Cal was three places, or about 40
seconds, ahead at the start, but by
the final stretch of the race, the
Cardinal had caught up to the
Golden Bears.
" They caught them just as they
crossed the finish line," Acosta
said. "Our bow was overlapping
their stern."
Stanford finished behind UC-

Irvine with a time of 18:36, al
most 30 seconds ahead of the Cal
lightweights.
