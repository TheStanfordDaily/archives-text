Between 3,000
and 4,000 Stanford
community mem
bers are expected to
head to the polls
a. 1 1 ! a.

today, according to
the ASSU. Stanford voters will help deter
mine California's next governor, as well as
representation in the U.S. House of Repre
sentatives and California State Assembly and
whether several ballot initiatives will be put
into effect.
For voters registered in one of Stanford's
precincts, polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8
p.m. today. Students will vote in one of eight
on-campus locations — in El Centro Chi
cano, Escondido Elementary School, Faisan,
Slavianskii Dom, Terra and Wilbur Hall for
undergraduates and in El Centro Chicano,
Escondido Elementary School, Quillen
Lounge and Rains Commons for graduate
students — depending on what residence
I hey live in this year. The ASSU has e-mailed
students a list of voting locations and has also
distributed the list in dining halls. The bal
lots in all of the Stanford voting locations will
be identical.
Approximately 7,000 to 8,000 Stanford
community members, including students,
faculty and staff, are registered in a Stan
ford precinct, estimated sophomore
Hunter Hargraves, an ASSU executive cab
inet member who has run the student gov
ernment's Get Out the Vote 2002 cam
paign. Hargraves said the number was
based on Santa Clara County Registrar of
Voters statistics from the beginning of the
school year indicating that between 6,000
and 6,500 voters were registered in a Stan
ford precinct.
The ASSU predicts that about half of Stan
ford's registered voters will get to the polls
today.
"Because it's an off-year election with no

president on the ballot and a lot of the races
viewed as noncompetitive, 1 personally would
be happy [if] 3,000 or 4,000 voted," liar
graves said.
In (he past weeks, several candidates —
including (ireen Party gubernatorial candi
date Peter Camejo, 14th Congressional Dis
trict candidates to the U.S. I louse of Repre
sentatives incumbent Democrat Anna Kshoo
and Republican challenger Joe Nixon, and

California State Assembly incumbent Demo
crat Joe Simitian — have appeared on cam
pus to discuss relevant campaign issues with
die Stanford community.
Many students who are residents of other
districts have also already voted using absen
tee ballots, and there is also a substantial con
tingent of Stanford students who are not reg
istered to vote, in many cases because they
missed the registration deadline.
