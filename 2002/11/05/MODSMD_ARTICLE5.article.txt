# LGBT-CRC hosts vigil for slain transgender teen
## Over 50 students gather to pay tribute to Gwen Araujo 
### KATHERINE WANG 
Candles and incense were lit as a
packed room of 50 students gathered at
the LGBT Community Resource Cen
ter last night to hold a vigil in memorial
of Gwen Aran jo's tragic death.
Araujo was an East Bay transgen
der female who was murdered and
found in a shallow grave after being
declared missing almost a month ago.
"This is a way for us to deal with a
death so c lose to us," said Caitlin Kali
nowski, who organized the event with
Leif Cranberg and Aika Swai and in
partnership with the LGBT-CRC.
At the LGBT-CRC, members of the
Stanford community read poems in
honor of the 17-year-old, and ex
pressed their sadness, frustration and
anger at the crime. Students lined up
quietly to light a wall of candles be
hind a framed picture of Araujo smil
ing happily with her niece.
Kalinowski hoped that this event
would unite people of all sexual orien
tations within the Stanford communi
ty and "bring together people that
don't normally spend time together in
the same space."
Aran jo's death has sparked a re
newed interest in transgender issues
within the Stanford community. The
University's transgender community
is relatively small, since there are very
few students on campus who openly
identify with being transgender. As a

result, there is not a lot of awareness
about transgender issues.
The lack of education on transgen
der issues on campus is a concern lor
Kalinowski. She said that for Stanford
transgender students, some of which
include her close friends, "fear [of as
sault] is a big issue."
Kalinowski's apprehension is not
unwarranted as Araujo was from
Newark, a city across the bay from
Stanford.

Kalinowski also said that although
the Stanford community is accepting
of people of various sexual orienta
tions, many are unfamiliar with "per
ceived gender disparities" in trans
gender people, and this could possibly
lead to a similar "transphobic"
tragedy to occur within the University
community. Kalinowski stressed the
difference between orientation and
gender, emphasizing that gender has
to do with "your look," whether it be

masculine or feminine.
Although the event served to com
memorate Aran jo's life, many in atten
dance, such as sophomore Ronak Ka
padia, felt that, nationally, enough at
tention has not been paid to this crime
because "Araujo is not Matthew Shep
ard," a Caucasian, male, gay teenager
who was killed three years ago.
" The vigil is not enough," kapadia
said. "The important thing is who will
remember tomorrow."
