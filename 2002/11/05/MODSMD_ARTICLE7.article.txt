After graduating from Stan
ford, Aaron Persky hiked from
Palo Alto to Washington, D.C., to
raise money for the Red Cross
African Famine Relief Campaign.
For four straight years, he partici
pated in the California AIDS Ride,
cycling from San Francisco to Los
Angeles. But now IVrsky finds
himself in a different kind of
race — one for the Santa Clara
Superior (lourt Judge (Mlice 1().
1 lie Superior (lourt decides all
criminal cases in the county, as
well as any civil case above small
claims. It has original jurisdiction
over all cases based on state law.
Persky's opponent in the race is
Ron M. Del Pozzo, a Santa Clara
County Deputy District Attorney
who specializes in prosecuting vio
lent felons. Del Pozzo has received
the Phillip Burton Award for Out
standing Community Service, and
is an active supporter of Next
Door Battered Women's Shelter,
Firefighter Toys for Tots and Sec
ond I larvest Food Bank.
Del Pozzo said that one of his
priorities if elected would be "to
work in our community to keep
juveniles out of the criminal jus
tice system by emphasizing educa
tion, juvenile detention reform,
restorative justice and role-model
programs, especially for high-risk
youths."
Also among Del Pozzo's stated
stances are his preference for
tough sentences against violent
criminals, child molesters and cor
porate defrauders, and his oppo
sition to crowding jails with non
violent drug offenders and the
mentally ill.
1 le was the leading vote-getter
in the March primary election,
and is endorsed by Congress

members Zoe Lofgren and Mike
Honda, Hi police and lire organi
zations and the AFL-CIO.
Persky's primary endorse
ments come from the San Jose
Mercury News and the Santa
Clara Bar Association, with addi
tional support coming from the
Palo Alto Daily News and former
San Jose Mayor Susan Hammer.
A native San Franciscan, Per
sky came to Stanford in 1980 and
spent his freshman year in Eu
calipto. 1 le was the captain of the
lacrosse team fora year, and
wrote music columns for The
Daily. Also, as head of the Stan
ford Concert Network, Persky
brought the Grateful Dead to
Frost Amphitheater.
Persky, a former international
relations student, said that the ed
ucation in international relations
and international policy studies he
received at Stanford was a major
factor in his career trajectory.
He is currently working as a
criminal prosecutor in the Santa
Clara District Attorney's office,
prosecuting primarily perpetra
tors of hate crimes and sexually vi
olent predators. He is also on the
executive committee of the Sup
port Network for battered Women
and is also a board member of the
Santa Clara County Network fora
Hate-Free Community.
If he is elected to the court, one
of Persky's goals would be to in
crease the use of technology in the
courtroom.
"Integrating technology in the
courtroom, such as correspond
ing with jurors through e-mail
and incorporating video confer
encing for lawyers, would help to
grind out some of the inefficien
cies in the court system and save
everyone time and money," he
said.
