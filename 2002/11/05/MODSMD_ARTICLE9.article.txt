Capital Group Companies, Inc.
Morris, who wrote 33 award-winning books, is also recognized as one
of America's most gifted authors. 1 le received the National Book Award

for fiction in 1980 for the novel "Plains Song: For Female Voices."
Students upset with closing of Yost open kitchen
The Sunday morning closing of the Yost 1 louse kitchen lias sparked
a wave of intra-dorm e-mails and complaints to dining services. The
house is meeting with Dining Services today to find alternative services
for residents.
Students are complaining that the kitchen was unfairly closed with
out warning because the two kitchen managers felt it was too messy.
Yost and Murray are the only two houses on campus that are run by
Dining Services but have an open kitchen run by kitchen managers.
Last year, the Yost kitchen was temporarily shut down by the health in
spection service.
Evan Cooper, a Yost resident, said it was unfortunate that the first
indication of a problem was the e-mail that the kitchen managers sent
to the house telling them they were closing the kitchen. He said that
part of the problem was due to the lack of communication between the
house and the kitchen managers.
"They don't like their job, and it shows," he said. "But, the good
thing is that Dining Services seems to want to see the problem fixed."
Yost kitchen manager Jenique Meekins declined to comment until
after today's 6 p.m. meeting on the issue.
Susan Stryker speaks in conjunction with film class
Renowned transgender scholar and activist Susan Stryker will speak
tomorrow about the Kimberley Pierce film "Boys Don't Cry" and her
role in the Guggenheim "Brandon" project. The speech was planned
in conjunction with the feminist studies class "Girls on Film," which
studies women in films ranging from "Clueless" to"Buffy the Vampire
Slayer."
Stryker, who is the director of the GLBT Historical Society and
a columnist for Planet Out, received her Ph.D. at UC-Berkeley and
is the author of several books and studies concerning gender and
sexuality.
Patricia Pender, who teaches the film class at Stanford and orga
nized the event, said that the recent murder of Bay Area transgender
youth Gwen Araujo has brought many transgender issues to light.
Araujo's story is strikingly similar to the true story of Brandon Teena
portrayed in "Boys Don't Cry." The LGBT-CRC is holding a vigil fol
lowing Stryker's lecture in order to address the issues that have
spurred in the queer community.
"At the time of this crisis, I can imagine a lot of students feel con
fused and unsafe," Pender said. "We are lucky to have [Susan] come
and speak at this time."
