It wouldn't be clear to every firm that a man
with an M.F. A.in poetry was the right choice to
head an automated block trading unit. Or that a
designer of solar-powered race cars was the
right woman to help launch a new venture in
computational chemistry. But after we talked to
them, it was clear to us.
The D. E. Shaw group is an investment and
technology development firm. Since 1988 we've
grown into a number of closely related entities
with more than US $3 billion in aggregate capi
tal by hiring smart people from a wide range of
backgrounds and letting them implement—and
manage—what they invent. A robotics guru.
A nationally ranked blackjack player. A demo
litions expert. An operatic mezzo-soprano.
And a lot of people who are just exceptionally
strong in CS, EE, math, and finance.
The firm currently has openings in quantitative
analysis, software development, trading, busi
ness development, accounting, finance, and
investor relations. We're looking for creative
but pragmatic people, articulate, curious, and
driven. Our working environment is intense
but surprisingly casual. We provide unusual
opportunities for growth. And we compensate
extraordinary people extraordinarily well.
The D. E. Shaw group will host an information
session on Thursday, November 7 at 7 PM in
Room 104 of the William Gates Computer
Building. On-campus interviews will take
place November 8. To apply for an interview,
log on to www.stanford.edu/dept/CDC/
stiidents/register.htmlby October 18 or send
a resume and a cover letter stating your
GPA and standardized test scores to
oncampiis@deshaw.com by October 28.
