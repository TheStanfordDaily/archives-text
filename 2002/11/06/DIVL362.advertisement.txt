EPISODE VI:
Here's the deal, straight from the jockey, fve been
1 trying to perform a certain operation that requires a
Ie® e " t °112 WW °112 magical kind. Energy
I I for... let'sjust call it an operation, okay* It's not that far
OL I off. Anyway, the magical maneuvers in which! dabble
hike their power from natural sources. Just like
everything else does. The power we use accumulates
itself in deposits we call "nodes" . ..
So fm in iwed of some major poti<er. And as you can imagine, the greater !j)s Angeles
area is low on iwtural resources. Just like we've used up all our water, and air, and u'ho knows
u'hat the liell else, the magir sources around here rati get low. Or kind oj nasty. All gummed
up. I don't even knou< wluit kind of negative resonances come out of them these days. Most
people use artificial node generators these days hut I don't have the rash to shell out on that kind
of equipment. I needed a node distant from my normal urban stomping grounds. Which, for
those less clued in, wrndd luive been a major problem . .

Bui I've got nodes in different area codes, il you know what 1 mean. I ve got
friends in powerful places, a vehicle with a working transmission (most of the lime)
and a spectacular knowledge of Southern California geography. I am not limited
to the damn Pico and Olympic nodes, or even those at Ventura and Fallbrook. I
was prepared to do a little traveling to attain the desired goal. I m always willing to
travel fora goal, if you know what I mean.
We were heading to distant lands and untapped sources. It was the only way
to ifo. So it wasn't out of the (tuestion that we should attempt to perform a massive
power transfer. Am I right? I'm right. I'm always tight. You shouldn't even have to
pause before you answer this question.
So me (sex-god of the San Fernando Valley, in case you had any doubts) my
ever-loyal basset hound Bentham (actually a reincarnation of some wacked-out
utilitarian guy whose body is mummified in a college in England, preventing his
soul from attaining peace. All you cryogeniccryptoids, think twice, unless you want
to come back to Earth as Sander's pet Shih Tzu. I'm not kidding.) and my bass
player pal and cohort in crime Mandible (Mancly to those who love her) take the
Zetamobile up into the San Gabriels. Nice steep mountain range not too far from
Sander's home turf.
So after about two hours driving, we're sitting pretty in these Cali hills, and
we've assembled all the necessary equipment. We're dressed to impress the cosmic
forces in black leather. We've got all the diagrams done in chalk real nice and neat,
the air is clear and the stars are shining. Basically, it's the perfect setup and it ain't
gonna let up.
Except it does. Something went wrong. Bad wrong. One of the corner stones
exploded right ofTthe diagram. All this nasty smoke. No power diverted into the
objects we wanted it in. No success. A complete failure, and the smoke is still in my
lungs making me cough like some Emily Bronte consumption patient. And as if
that wasn't bad enough, the nodes will be sensitized to our presence now, in a bad
way, and reluctant to emit power. Which screws me over, and Mandy too.
So she wants to know what's up. Well, there's one little problem. I know exactly
what's up, and there's no way I'm telling her.
