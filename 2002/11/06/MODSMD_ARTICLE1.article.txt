ELECTIONS/3

Amidst voting complications in San Francis
co, an unexpected early lead in the polls by Re
publican challenger Bill Simon and a strong
Republican showing in races across the nation,
Democrat Gray Davis was narrowly re-elected
as California's governor yesterday night.
Meanwhile, Democrat Cruz Bustamante
defeated Republican opponent Bruce
McPherson to retain the lieutenant gover
norship.
Many felt Davis' margin of victory was rela
tively slim, particularly given his incumbent
status in a traditionally Democratic-leaning
state.
Poll results reported Davis at 47 percent,
Simon at 43 percent and Green Party candi
date Peter Camejo at 5 percent with 70 percent
of precincts having reported as of 12 a.m.
today. The lieutenant governor results listed
Bustamante at 49 percent and McPherson at
42 percent.
Simon underscored the close nature of the
gubernatorial election in his resignation
speech.
"I am very proud of the race that we have
run," Simon said. "The margin looks very very
tight—but it doesn't look like the numbers are
going to be there for us this time."
Davis addressed campaign volunteers and
supporters in Los Angeles shortly after Simon
offered his resignation.
"You are the heroes of tonight's election,

Tomorrow:

and I will always be grateful to you," Davis said.
Democrats on campus said they were
pleased with the election results.
"I think that [Davis] does have inadequa
cies, but there are a lot of positive things about
him that people do not necessarily see,"
Heather Hargreaves, a senior and president of
the Stanford Democrats. "I also think having a
Democratic governor helps the Democratic
legislature."
Josh Benson, a senior and editor-in-chief
of the Stanford Progressive, explained that
"it is good to have a Democrat in charge of
state government — I would only hope it
would be a Democrat more to my political
liking—but he is much better than the polit
ical alternative."
Despite Simon's defeat, Republican stu
dents said they were also satisfied with the
results.
"We were very impressed by Simon's show
ing," said Joe Fairbanks, a sophomore and
president of the Stanford College Republi
cans. "None of us realistically expected him to
win; we expected Davis' margin of victory to be
far bigger than it was. It goes to show that peo
ple don't trust Davis."
Will Hudson, a sophomore and the Stan
ford College Republicans' chief financial offi
cer, concurred with Fairbanks' views.
"The message is pretty strong that — re
gardless of the fact that Simon will probably
not be the next governor — there are a signif-

icant number of voters who do not
like Davis and do not like what he
has done to the suite," Hudson said.
"Davis has been plagued with cor
ruption and economic downturn. I
think [voters] are looking for anoth
er answer because they haven't got
ten any from the current adminis
tration."
Adam Edwards, a graduate stu
dent in applied physics and a Green
Party member, felt Camejo ran a
successful campaign.
"He was good at his speeches,"
Edwards said. "I was hoping fora
higher percentage of votes for the
Green Party. [5 percent] is not bad,
but it could be better."
Tyler Snortum-Phelps, Came
jo's campaign manager, explained
that the election results will be im
portant for the future of the Green
Party.
"We are delighted," Snortum-
Phelps said. "The media will focus

on the overall numbers, but they
are missing the tremendous gains
that we made in this campaign .. .
The Green Party has grown by
leaps and bounds.
"We are really on the map now;
it makes us the definite third party
force in California."
Though Davis managed to win
in the end, the first precinct reports
showed Simon ahead of Davis by 2
percent. For two hours after Cali
fornia polling booths closed, Simon
unexpectedly continued to main
tain his initial numerical lead.
Alexander Kendall, a junior and
the Stanford Democrats' communi
cations director, said he did not
think anything of Simon's early
lead.
"I actually was not very wor
ried," Kendall said. "I was talking to
a 112 riend of mine at the Davis head
quarters — those early returns are
central valley votes, which is t he bas
tion of conservative votes. [Davis
was] doing very well by only trailing
by a point [at that time]."
During the elections process yes
terday, news outlets reported that

thousands of San Francisco resi
dents were temporarily not able to
vote because local precinct locations
ran out of paper ballots.
"It is absurd that we cannot have
enough ballots for everyone,"
Kendall said. "It is an insult to our
democracy."
Edwards agreed with Kendall's
sentiments regarding the ballot
shortages.
"I am sure something like that
just affects pretty much [all candi
dates] equally, but I think the whole
voting system is pretty absurd," Ed
wards said. "It is made to be com
plicated when it could be made so
much simpler."
While Democrats said they were
excited by Davis' gubernatorial vic
tory, some of them were more con
cerned with the nationwide Demo
cratic seat losses in the U.S. House
of Representatives and the U.S.
Senate.
"I'd say the mood is pretty
somber here," Kendall said. "The
Republicans controlling every
branch of government is not some
thing we would like to see."
