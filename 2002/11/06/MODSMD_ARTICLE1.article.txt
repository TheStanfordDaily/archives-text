Amidst voting complications in San Francis
co, an unexpected early lead in the polls by Re
publican challenger Bill Simon and a strong
Republican showing in races across the nation,
Democrat Gray Davis was narrowly re-elected
as California's governor yesterday night.
Meanwhile, Democrat Cruz Bustamante
defeated Republican opponent Bruce
McPherson to retain the lieutenant gover
norship.
Many felt Davis' margin of victory was rela
tively slim, particularly given his incumbent
status in a traditionally Democratic-leaning
state.
Poll results reported Davis at 47 percent,
Simon at 43 percent and Green Party candi
date Peter Camejo at 5 percent with 70 percent
of precincts having reported as of 12 a.m.
today. The lieutenant governor results listed
Bustamante at 49 percent and McPherson at
42 percent.
Simon underscored the close nature of the
gubernatorial election in his resignation
speech.
"I am very proud of the race that we have
run," Simon said. "The margin looks very very
tight—but it doesn't look like the numbers are
going to be there for us this time."
Davis addressed campaign volunteers and
supporters in Los Angeles shortly after Simon
offered his resignation.
"You are the heroes of tonight's election,

Tomorrow:

and I will always be grateful to you," Davis said.
Democrats on campus said they were
pleased with the election results.
"I think that [Davis] does have inadequa
cies, but there are a lot of positive things about
him that people do not necessarily see,"
Heather Hargreaves, a senior and president of
the Stanford Democrats. "I also think having a
Democratic governor helps the Democratic
legislature."
Josh Benson, a senior and editor-in-chief
of the Stanford Progressive, explained that
"it is good to have a Democrat in charge of
state government — I would only hope it
would be a Democrat more to my political
liking—but he is much better than the polit
ical alternative."
Despite Simon's defeat, Republican stu
dents said they were also satisfied with the
results.
"We were very impressed by Simon's show
ing," said Joe Fairbanks, a sophomore and
president of the Stanford College Republi
cans. "None of us realistically expected him to
win; we expected Davis' margin of victory to be
far bigger than it was. It goes to show that peo
ple don't trust Davis."
Will Hudson, a sophomore and the Stan
ford College Republicans' chief financial offi
cer, concurred with Fairbanks' views.
"The message is pretty strong that — re
gardless of the fact that Simon will probably
not be the next governor — there are a signif-
