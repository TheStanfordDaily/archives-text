# Eshoo defeats Nixon in local race
## 
### MICHELLE KELLER EDITORIAL STAFF 
As the polls closed today, constituents in District 14,
located between San Francisco and San Jose, voted in
cumbent Democrat Anna Eshoo to the 1 louse of Rep
resentatives with a sweeping majority vote of 69 per
cent. The results come with little surprise, given that
Eshoo had raised over $700,000 — roughly 14 times
the amount raised by her opponent, Republican Joe
Nixon — and has held the office for the past 10 years.
"It's a great honor," she said in an interview last
night. "I'm thrilled to have the support of our con
stituents."
Eshoo's priorities in the 2002 campaign focused pri
marily on family issues, including education and health
care for children. Eshoo also prioritized helping to
promote a "robust economy" in her campaign—an
important issue in a district that includes influential Sil
icon Valley technology firms.
"The biggest issue right now is the state of the econ
omy," Eshoo explained. "The sad case is that our cur
rent administration doesn't have an economic team.
I'm going to work like hell to make sure that that
changes and that we have more of a focus on how we
can help the economy.
"People really need [Congress's support and legisla
tion] right now .. . They're really hurting," she added.

Senior Heather Hargreaves, chair of the Stanford
Democrats, expressed enthusiasm about the results of
the congressional race and said she is looking forward
to speaking with Eshoo in the future.
"I'm really happy to see that she won re-election,"
Hargreaves said. "Anna has been a great supporter of
the Stanford Democrats in the past."
An issue that also carries much weight at the mo
ment is the current war against Iraq. Eshoo is a co
sponsor of House Resolution 4660, which created the
Department of National Homeland Security, and she
issued a statement in June saying she is "[looking] for
ward to working with [her] colleagues to implement a
sound strategy that provides better security of our bor
ders and better protection of our nation."
Nixon took only 28 percent of the vote in the district.
Most of his issues in the campaign focused on his dis
agreements with Eshoo's stances on government pro
grams and the war on Iraq.
"Anna's knee-jerk response to every problem is to
tax, spend and hardly even worry about whether the
big-government program is doing anything good or
not," he stated in his campaign Web site.
Nixon strongly focused on national defense, ex
pressing strong support for President Bush's views on
the Iraq conflict. Nixon's loss was most likely due to the
fact that District 14 has a majority of Democratic con
stituents and that Eshoo was the clear-cut favorite.
