## The 						Stanford Daily Bay Area bid for the Olympics had its flaws 
### 
This past weekend, people throughout
the Bay Area watched dejectedly as the
United States Olympic Committee se
lected New York over San Francisco to be the
United States' candidate city to host the 2012
Olympic Games. If the USOC had chosen San
Francisco instead, many of the Olympic events,
including the opening and closing ceremonies,
would have been held on the Stanford campus,
according to the Bay Area Sports Organizing
Committee's proposal.
While we think it would he very special if
Stanford and the Bay Area hosted the
Olympics, especially given Stanford's rich ath
letic tradition, BASOC's bid had its faults, par
ticularly when describing the effects the
Olympics would have on the Stanford campus.
One main reason why holding the
Olympics in the Bay Area, specifically at
Stanford, would be extra special is Stanford's

impressive tradition of producing stellar
Olympians. So many Olympians have graced
the Farm that if Stanford were a country, it
would have finished in the top 20 in the
medal standings among nations competing
at the last three Summer Olympics.
Another promising component of BASOC's
bid was that it projected over $400 million in
profit for the Games. For many cities through
out the world, the Olympics has done more
economic harm than good; Montreal is a per
fect example. Even Sydney is still trying to re
cover from the 2000 Olympic Games.
Unfortunately, moments before BASOC
presented its bid to the USOC board, it was
told that the budget surplus proposed in the
bid would not be a factor in the USOC's deci
sion. If BASOC plans to enter a bid for the
2016 Olympics, we hope it will continue to ex
amine the economic effects the Olympics

would have on the Bay Area.
Despite these benefits, BASOC's propos
al had its shortcomings in its relation to
Stanford. While BASOC's bid proposed to
renovate a number of Stanford facilities —
including Stanford Stadium, Sunken Dia
mond and Maples Pavilion — much of the
planning was done with little input from
Stanford administrators. Although the Uni
versity had a memorandum of understand
ing with BASOC that Stanford facilities
could be used for the Olympics, Stanford
did not agree to any of the specifics out
lined in the BASOC proposal.
Some of BASOC's plans did not even repre
sent the University's interests. For example,
BASOC wanted to renovate Stanford Stadium
into a 100,000-seat athletics complex that
would have housed the Olympics' opening
and closing ceremonies and track and field

team wouldn't have to play in front of thou
sands of empty seats — the proposed complex
did not mesh with the University's desire to
make the stadium more fan-friendly, which
would include moving the seating area closer
to the field.
We applaud University administrators for
not agreeing to any of BASOC's plans until
they made sure the proposal would benefit
the University in the long term. In addition
to the use of Stanford's facilities, administra
tors need to make sure that a possible
Olympics at Stanford will not negatively af
fect other aspects of the University, including
student life, academic and security concerns.
We urge BASOC to seek greater input from
the Stanford community before it creates a
likely bid for the 2016 Olympics.
