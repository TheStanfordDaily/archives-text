# MEMORY YIELDS
## Stanford's 'social' contract 
### 
So it's Wednesday morning again, and
we are basking in the afterglow of an
other contentious election. With the
political divisions currently wracking the
country and the ensuing close votes in
every district, Comedy Central's Election
Night coverage was probably about as ac
curate as ABC's. Will Bush get the oppor
tunity to avenge 41 ? Is the secret to the re
vitalization of the left simply to kill off its
senators? Has Florida been voted off of the
island? Chances are it'll take at least anoth
er weekend of Reno-counts to determine
the answer to these and other important
political questions.
But, certainly, watching Peter Jennings
pratde for 72 hours isn't going to cut it.
After all, these are only midterm elections.
Regardless of what happens, the nation is

condemned to two more
years of Texas eu
phemisms, and Jon Stew
art will continue to pros
per. So, what are you
doing this weekend?
Chances are, if you're
at Stanford, not much.
As astute Daily readers,
you should know that the
past weeks have brought a

bevy of articles on the status of the social life
here on the Farm. You know that Sigma
Chi, Kappa Sig and Theta Delt, as well as
the Stanford Band, are all on alcohol pro
bation. You know that this past Friday you
were faced with the Naderite lesser-of-two
evilisms in Toyon vs. Soto. And you know
that this is not a good year to be a freshman.
Personally, we believe that Phil Norton's
letter (Oct. 30) raises some serious issues by
pointing out the guilty-until-proven-inno
cent nature of the alcohol probations. Cer
tainly, something is wrong when half of
Stanford's housed fraternities find them
selves on alcohol probation. Hopefully, the
two sides will come to an understanding,
the alcohol probations will pass, and cam
pus social life can get back to normal.
But, what are we to do until then?
We would like to issue a challenge to
Stanford's housed fraternities: Make your
selves useful. You received prime real es
tate on campus on the theory that you were
going to provide service to the community.
While we concede that you do more com
munity service than the average house, you
aren't doing much for social life at Stanford
anymore. We feel that your previous com
mitment to social life at Stanford legit
imized your housed status. This year you
appear to have lost this commitment. In
order to justify your continued housing,
you need to take back the initiative.
One proposal to fulfill this contract, dry
parties, has been a subject of recent debate.
In his letter to The Daily (Oct. 30), Paul
Hayne, former social manager at Theta
Delt, responded to this idea by saying,"()h,
and nonalcoholic parties? Come on, grand
ma, get your head out of the sand." 1 low
ever, earlier in the same letter, I layne quot-

Ed Chris Diedrich as saying, "people don't
get drunk at fiat parties: You wait fora half
hour fora foamy cup ofbeer." Anyone who
has ever been to a hat party knows that
Diedrich's quote is right on. Although, at
first glance, Hayne's quote seems equally
valid, the two claims are mutually exclusive.
Either students get drunk at frat parties,
and not by tossing back shots at a preparty
in someone's dormroom, or, as Diedrich
says, alcohol is not essential, and thus dry
parties should be equally successful.
Hayne pointed out quite correctly that
our cultural schizophrenia about alcohol is
a national problem crushing the fresh
men's sex lives locally. Furthermore, the
administration and alumni's refusal to sup
port any event that might have alcohol at it
makes them look ridiculous. The Daily arti
cle "Dry Campus?" (Oct. 28) quoted Associ
ate Dean of Students Marcus Graves as say
ing that the crackdown is because "the risk
is so high." How high? Twelve to 15 alco
hol-related deaths on college campuses
every year, according to Graves.
Is a portion of a fraction of a percent
high? Do 15 deaths, none at Stanford, out
of literally thousands of students merit this
draconian response? The answer is yes.
The University has deep pockets, and it is
worried about the legal liability it could face
when something alcohol-related does hap
pen to a minor at Stanford. But it should
just admit that, and thus move the conver
sation into more constructive avenues, such
as active discussions with fraternities as to
how to reduce liability at parties, rather
than the übiquitous alcohol probation.
As for the fraternities, why not try the
dry party? You could even advertise the
type of EANABS that will be available for
mixing. We and our trusty flasks would cer
tainly attend, say, a Coca-Cola-themed
party in honor of the great actor, Mr. J.
Daniels (| is for.. .Jeff). This would shift the
liability fiom the fraternity to the individu
al who brings the alcohol.
Or, at other universities, Greek orga
nizations sponsor a wide variety of non
party activities. These range from after
noon concerts to three-on-three basket
ball tournaments, or even the odd mud
wrestling event.
We believe that the Stanford Greek men
will rally behind the banner of fun. We are
sure that they are capable of thinking of
nonalcoholic events with widespread ap
peal, such as Kappa Sig's Foam Party last
year. And we are confident that they are in
terested in dispelling their assuredly unjust
reputation as people that can only enjoy
themselves while intoxicated, because, after
all, that would be incredibly lame, which we
all know that Stanford fraternities are any
thing but.

We would like to issue a challenge to
Stanford's housed fraternities: Make your
selves useful. You received prime real es
tate on campus on the theory that you were
going to provide service to the community.
While we concede that you do more com
munity service than the average house, you
aren't doing much for social life at Stanford
anymore. We feel that your previous com
mitment to social life at Stanford legit
imized your housed status. This year you
appear to have lost this commitment. In
order to justify your continued housing,
you need to take back the initiative.
One proposal to fulfill this contract, dry
parties, has been a subject of recent debate.
In his letter to The Daily (Oct. 30), Paul
Hayne, former social manager at Theta
Delt, responded to this idea by saying,"()h,
and nonalcoholic parties? Come on, grand
ma, get your head out of the sand." 1 low
ever, earlier in the same letter, I layne quot-

Ed Chris Diedrich as saying, "people don't
get drunk at fiat parties: You wait fora half
hour fora foamy cup ofbeer." Anyone who
has ever been to a hat party knows that
Diedrich's quote is right on. Although, at
first glance, Hayne's quote seems equally
valid, the two claims are mutually exclusive.
Either students get drunk at frat parties,
and not by tossing back shots at a preparty
in someone's dormroom, or, as Diedrich
says, alcohol is not essential, and thus dry
parties should be equally successful.
Hayne pointed out quite correctly that
our cultural schizophrenia about alcohol is
a national problem crushing the fresh
men's sex lives locally. Furthermore, the
administration and alumni's refusal to sup
port any event that might have alcohol at it
makes them look ridiculous. The Daily arti
cle "Dry Campus?" (Oct. 28) quoted Associ
ate Dean of Students Marcus Graves as say
ing that the crackdown is because "the risk
is so high." How high? Twelve to 15 alco
hol-related deaths on college campuses
every year, according to Graves.
Is a portion of a fraction of a percent
high? Do 15 deaths, none at Stanford, out
of literally thousands of students merit this
draconian response? The answer is yes.
The University has deep pockets, and it is
worried about the legal liability it could face
when something alcohol-related does hap
pen to a minor at Stanford. But it should
just admit that, and thus move the conver
sation into more constructive avenues, such
as active discussions with fraternities as to
how to reduce liability at parties, rather
than the übiquitous alcohol probation.
As for the fraternities, why not try the
dry party? You could even advertise the
type of EANABS that will be available for
mixing. We and our trusty flasks would cer
tainly attend, say, a Coca-Cola-themed
party in honor of the great actor, Mr. J.
Daniels (| is for.. .Jeff). This would shift the
liability fiom the fraternity to the individu
al who brings the alcohol.
Or, at other universities, Greek orga
nizations sponsor a wide variety of non
party activities. These range from after
noon concerts to three-on-three basket
ball tournaments, or even the odd mud
wrestling event.
We believe that the Stanford Greek men
will rally behind the banner of fun. We are
sure that they are capable of thinking of
nonalcoholic events with widespread ap
peal, such as Kappa Sig's Foam Party last
year. And we are confident that they are in
terested in dispelling their assuredly unjust
reputation as people that can only enjoy
themselves while intoxicated, because, after
all, that would be incredibly lame, which we
all know that Stanford fraternities are any
thing but.

So it's Wednesday morning again, and
we are basking in the afterglow of an
other contentious election. With the
political divisions currently wracking the
country and the ensuing close votes in
every district, Comedy Central's Election
Night coverage was probably about as ac
curate as ABC's. Will Bush get the oppor
tunity to avenge 41 ? Is the secret to the re
vitalization of the left simply to kill off its
senators? Has Florida been voted off of the
island? Chances are it'll take at least anoth
er weekend of Reno-counts to determine
the answer to these and other important
political questions.
But, certainly, watching Peter Jennings
pratde for 72 hours isn't going to cut it.
After all, these are only midterm elections.
Regardless of what happens, the nation is

condemned to two more
years of Texas eu
phemisms, and Jon Stew
art will continue to pros
per. So, what are you
doing this weekend?
Chances are, if you're
at Stanford, not much.
As astute Daily readers,
you should know that the
past weeks have brought a

bevy of articles on the status of the social life
here on the Farm. You know that Sigma
Chi, Kappa Sig and Theta Delt, as well as
the Stanford Band, are all on alcohol pro
bation. You know that this past Friday you
were faced with the Naderite lesser-of-two
evilisms in Toyon vs. Soto. And you know
that this is not a good year to be a freshman.
Personally, we believe that Phil Norton's
letter (Oct. 30) raises some serious issues by
pointing out the guilty-until-proven-inno
cent nature of the alcohol probations. Cer
tainly, something is wrong when half of
Stanford's housed fraternities find them
selves on alcohol probation. Hopefully, the
two sides will come to an understanding,
the alcohol probations will pass, and cam
pus social life can get back to normal.
But, what are we to do until then?
