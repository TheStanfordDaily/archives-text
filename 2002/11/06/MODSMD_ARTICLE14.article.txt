Daily endorsements 'ignore the
conservative viewpoint 7
I feel that The Daily is acting somewhat ir
responsibly in its endorsements of candi
dates and propositions in the recent election.
By putting forth strongly left-wing opinions
across the board. The Daily chooses to ig
nore the conservative viewpoint. Fora pub
lication which receives a widespread outcry
when any issues of diversity are "over
looked" (for example, the uproar over the
omission of any lesbian kiss scenes from the
coverage of Full Moon even despite the in
clusion of a photo of two male students kiss
ing), it seems that The Daily is shirking its
duty to present the viewpoints of all its stu
dents. When the voice of a university so fo
cused on diversity as ours is content to pre
sent only one side of political issues, it adds
fuel to the argument that Stanford will
fight for racial and gender diversity, but is
more than satisfied to neglect diversity of
political opinion.
Although 1 understand the importance
of The Daily as the voice of one of the more
liberal universities in America, I believe t hat
The Daily has chosen to consider and print
all ideas and opinions only so long as those
views come from the liberal side of the po
litical spectrum. Due to this oversight, 1 be
lieve that Hie Daily should draw more at
tention to the beliefs of the sizable minority
of more right-wing students at Stanford. In
a day and age where tolerance of all ethnic
ities and sexual preferences is the doctrine,
we attend a school where political diversity
is almost ati afterthought. More than 90
percent of the faculty fall into the left side of
the political sphere. In this case, the con
servative minority is being silenced, and 1
for one would appreciate it if this oversight
was corrected. I doubt this will get printed,
but it will only add hiel to my argument that

it's becoming harder and harder to get con
servative opinion into the media.

SCN tries to 'offer something for everyone'
The Stanford Concert Network would
like to take a minute to respond to Spencer
Cahill's critique of the Stanford music scene
("SCN could do better," Nov. 1). SCN takes
seriously the opinions of each student on
campus, and we are especially sensitive to
Cahill's concern that SCN bring a greater di
versity of artists to campus. Cahill's request
that SCN bring more big-name hip-hop
groups to campus did seem a bit odd on the
clay after SCN broke its Big Game show with
Nappy Roots, but nonetheless, it's a point
well-taken. However, Cahill's comparison of
SCN's accomplishments with that of Dart
mouth is unfair. Cahill compares SCN's ros
ter ofbig name artists with that of Dart mouth,
yet he doesn't note that Dartmouth's list
stretches back to 1988, while Stanford's list
only goes back to 1998, and doesn't even in
clude all the performers of the last few years.
If you include those previous 10 years,
along with the missing shows, SCN has
brought an impressive array of artists to
campus: Beck, Phish, Vertical Horizon,
Dispatch, Jack Johnson, Violet Femmes,
MXPX, Cake, Phil Lesh, Dar Williams, Bela
Fleck, They Might Be Giants and a fair
amount of hip-hop artists including De La
Soul, the Roots, Common, 4th Avenue
Jones, Blackalicious, Sir-Mix-Alot, Digital
Underground and now Nappy Roots.
Over the course of those years, SCN has
also worked with student groups to to bring
live editions of Love Line and Politically In
correct. It should be noted that SCN was
basically nonexistent during the early- and

mid-'9os when budget problems left the or
ganization with little or no funding. So SCN
has accomplished those shows in really only
half the amount of years it took Dartmouth
to amass their impressive history.
What Dartmouth has done is com
mendable, but it has to be remembered
that SCN's mission on this campus is dif
ferent than that of other college groups.
SCN is, and has always been, committed to
fostering the on-campus music scene at
Stanford, working with campus groups to
produce parties and serving as a conduit
between on-campus bands and groups
looking for performers. It has always been
the philosophy of SCN to try and serve as
much of the student body as possible
through small, medium and big shows,
rather than just put on one large show a
year that couldn't possibly satisfy all of
Stanford's diverse musical tastes.
Cahill s argues that SCN "can do bigger
and better things." We couldn't agree
more, and it's something we're working to
do. SCN will continue to put on shows in
Memorial Auditorium and Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium, and we are always receptive to
ideas for artists or new types of shows. Hut
we also hope students understand the
unique position Stanford is in â€” not only
are we located in between two major mar
ket cities, but the University's prohibition of
off-campus production companies means
they can t put on their own shows on cam
pus, as they do at UCB and SJSU.
So for the time being, yes, Busta Rhymes
will have to wait, and no, Dave Matthews
won't be playing the Stanford campus, but
hopefully SCN will continue to succeed in
booking a wide array of musical acts that
offer something for everyone.
