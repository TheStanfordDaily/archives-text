## Team Hoover paces Cardinal 
### MIA ASHTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford alumnus and former
U.S. President Herbert Hoover
would have been proud of the sail
ing team that took his name this
past weekend, as the Cardinal's
"Team Hoover" placed a solid
fourth overall at the Annual Jean
Shenk Team Race Regatta. He
might also have appreciated the
emphasis on brain over brawn —
the team-racing event emphasized
a unique style of competition that
necessitated cooperative strategy
between boats and a firm knowl
edge of sailing rules.
The event, which attracts several
highly respected teams from across
the nation, is team-oriented as three
doublehanded boats sail against one
another in each race. This year, as
Ail-Americans, world champions
and national champions comprised
the pack of opponents, the regatta
proved quite challenging. In fact,
Olympian and former Cardinal
coach Steve Bourdow was present

and guided his current team to take
first at the event.
Of the two Stanford teams pre
sent at the regatta, the top finisher
took fourth overall. Impressively,
the Cardinal went undefeated in
the entire first day of sailing, out
doing competitors from Southern
California, UC-Irvine, Santa Clara
and California. The performance
earned Stanford a berth in the
championship fleet on the follow
ing day ofcompetition and the dis
tinction of being the only college
team to do so.
"Team Hoover" was composed
of four crews and skippers, includ
ing senior Ted Conrads with
sophomore Lucy Horton, senior
Dave Kenny with freshman Anna
Vu, senior Matt Hooks with junior
Diana Ly, and junior Dave Phillips
with junior Sonja Bebber.
Sophomore Jeff Allen with
sophomore Ali Salatti, and fresh
man Brian Haines with junior Ash
ley Frush composed the Cardinal's
second team, which also included
assistant coach Brent Harrill. The

group finished seventh overall.
This weekend's event, like the
previous week's Women's Fall Pa
cific Coast Championships, pre
pared the Cardinal for the Col
lege Sailing National Champi
onships, to be held this June in
Detroit. As Stanford failed to
qualify for the Team Racing disci
pline at nationals last year, races
like "Shenk" are an important
focus for the team this season.
The team hopes that experience
gained at team-orientecl tourna
ments during the fall season will
have beneficial effects on the Car
dinal's performance in the spring,
and Harrill has confidence in
Stanford's ability in that area.
"We are clearly the deepest
Team Racing team on the West
Coast," he said.
Time to perfect such skills, how
ever, is running out, as the North /
South Championships will close
out the fall season in two weeks.
After that, Cardinal sailors won't
have the opportunity to prove
their depth until the spring.

In the meantime, however,
Haines will sail at the Men's Single
handed Nationals to be hosted by
Rice in Houston this weekend.
The Cardinal also sailed at
home this weekend, placing sec

ond overall at the annual Stanford
Invite regatta. Five doublehanded
teams competed in light wind con
ditions that made maneuvering
challenging. Even so, Stanford's A
and B-Divisions both sailed solidly.

Freshman Liz Rountree with
sophomore crew Alan Anderson,
and sophomore Andy Mesherwith
freshman crew Megan Heinen
placed second in A-Division and B-
Division, respectively.
