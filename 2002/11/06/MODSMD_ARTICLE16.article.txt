# Golf struggles at Prestige
## 
### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This fall has been a tough one for the
Stanford men's golf team, and yesterday's
1 lth-place finish at The Prestige at PGA
West did nothing to reverse that theme.
After a third-place finish at the Windon
Memorial to start the season, the squad lost
its way over its next two events.
An 1 lth-place showing at the Club
Glove Intercollegiate was followed by a
16th-place performance at the Alister
Mackenzie Invitational during the first two
weeks of October. The Cardinal stumbled
into the Nelson Invitational the weekend of
Oct. 25 only able to tie for seventh place on
its home golf course, just a year after a run
ner-up finish in the same event.
Nonetheless, coach Jeff Mitchell was op
timistic going into this week's Prestige in La
Quinta, Calif.
"If we can put together a solid perfor
mance, I think we'll be in a good frame of
mind going into the [winter]," Mitchell had
said before the event.
As usual, senior Jim Seki led the Cardi
nal out of the gates on Monday. Despite
battling back trouble for most of the year,
Seki has had a remarkable fall, notching
three top-10 finishes in four tourna
ments. His 69 on Monday put him in a tie
for third place after one round of play in
La Quinta.
After playing well in the final round of
the Nelson, senior Del de Windt continued
to build momentum with an even-par 72 in
his opening round.
This, however, was all the support that
Seki would receive from his teammates.
After recording top-15 finishes in all four
tournaments this year, senior Ron Won

fired an opening-round 76 to land in a tie
for 49th place.
Senior George Downing and freshman
Kyle Gentry rounded out the first-round
scoring for the Cardinal by each carding a
9-over-par 81.
The Cardinal's total of 298 on Monday
placed the squad in a tie for eighth place
overall with Yale, continuing a discourag
ing first-round trend.
Although the Cardinal was still in the
middle of the 18-team field on Monday
night, its 10-over-par score gave away 14
strokes to the tournament leaders from No.
6 Texas Christian. After 18 holes of play,
Stanford was effectively eliminated from
contention for the team crown.
Rounding out the top five were UC-
Irvine (-2), Pacific (4-3), UCLA (+4) and
Washington (+4).
After a second round of 300, the Cardi
nal needed a miracle to finish well in the
event.
It didn't happen.
Although Seki continued his solid play,
the rest of the team failed to follow suit. He
fired a second-round 71 and followed it
with a 72 in his final 18 holes to lock up a
fourth-place finish. His fourth top-10 finish
of the season already eclipsed his total of
three from a year ago and stands to boost
his current No. 10 national ranking.
Won finished below 15th place for the
first time this year, carding a final-round 76
to land in a three-way tie for 45th place
overall.
After a strong start, de Windt struggled
through his next two rounds, finishing with
an 81 and a three-round total of 231, good
enough for only 62nd place.

Senior Jim Seki fights his way out of a sand trap. Despite the
Cardinal's disappointing team performance at The Prestige,
Seki continued his outstanding play, finishing fourth overall.
This marked Seki's fourth top-10 finish of the season.
Gentry followed the opposite
path to finish just one stroke be
hind tie Windt. After a disappoint
ing opening round, Gentry picked
up his play and finished with a
third-round 72, the best showing
ol Ins young college career.
Downing was never able to re

cover from his opening round,
concluding the event in 85th place.
Overall, the Cardinal was disap
pointed by its play.
"We can't just go out and expect
to win," Won said. "We've got to
slowly work our way back up."
The team will have plenty of
time for extra work during the
coming offseason. Stanford won't
hit the links again until the Taylor
Made Intercollegiate Feb. 12
through Feb. 14 in Hilo, Hawaii.
