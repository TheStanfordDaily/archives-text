freshmen making their collegiate debuts,
beating four top-10 seeds in the 64-team
draw en route to capturing their first career
collegiate title.
"1 was really impressed with K.C. and
James at regionals," said head coach Dick
Gould, "and I think they can do well nation
ally as well."
Corkery and Pade ultimately won the re
gionals and secured the automatic berth by
surviving an all-Stanford final that saw the
duo pitted against senior Carter Morris and
sophomore Sam Warburg.
Corkery and Pade upset the fifth-seeded
team of Cardinal elders 8-5, giving them a
great opportunity to showcase their talent
on a national centerstage this weekend.
The nationals signal an end to a fall sea
son in which the Cardinal put on an im
pressive all-around performance, display
ing astounding depth with a formidable
crop of young talent emerging to go along
with the proven top-guns of Martin and
Lipsky.
A good showing this weekend would also
help set the tone for the spring season, which
begins Jan. 17 when the Cardinal will com
pete in the National Collegiate Tennis Clas
sic in Las Vegas.
According to Gould, the team is prepared
for its final test of the fall.
"We had a good week of practice this
week," Gould said. "We have to get everyone
to play as much as they can so this is a great
opportunity."
