# Digestive athletics and the Beer Mile
## 
### 
The letter I found
slipped under my door
in the midst of my resi
dents' board bills was a
simple piece of notebook paper,
folded in thirds and taped shut.
There was a picture of a koala
bear pasted onto the front.
"The perfect column" it said
on the front.
I ley, it's not often that I get
actual letters in response to

these things, so
I opened it up.
And while I'm
going to say it's
not perfect, the
contents en
closed therein
are pretty
damn good —
good enough

to be reproduced here in their
entirety.
So sit back, relax and enjoy:
Yon wrote last week about
competitive eating. Fifty hot
dogs ... so what? One hun
dred ounces of ice cream . . .
who cares? If you really want to
see competitive digestive ath
letics at its finest, you need to
listen to my story — the story of
the Beer Mile."
(At this point 1 was a little wor
ried that this letter was like the
video in"The Ring" — that the
"Beer Mile" would come to kill
me by the end of the week. In fact,
I'm still not sure that it won't.)
There were seven of us, the
letter continued, who descend
ed upon the track that cold and
starry night — five athletes and
two stunningly beautiful cheer
leaders who we had convinced
to clear the empty cans and
place out new ones while we ran.
Mostly they just laughed at us
and called us stupid. But never
mind that.
In Lane 1 we had the clear fa
vorite, Ike "Apache" Whitaker.
Ike isn't even in college anymore,
but that didn't stop him from
showing up and talking all kinds
ofsmack. In Lane 2 was the dark
horse candidate, Shrelvis. He
was quiet as he toed the line, ap
parently visualizing his victory.
Lane 3 held my roommate, Steve
"Butterbean" Prefontaine, while
I, Cool Rubin, stood confident in
Lane 4. To my right in the final
lane was Roo "Doo-Rag" Nichol
son, a converted extreme moun
tain biker.
The premise of the beer mile
is easy. It combines the two ac
tivities of drinking beer and
running a mile. A participant
drinks a beer, then runs a 400-
meter lap of the track. Four rep
etitions equals four beers, and
one mile. Fastest time wins. Sim
ple enough, you say?
That's what we thought, as

well. And, with a salvo of alu
minum pop tops, we began the
competition. The first beer was
gone in about 15 seconds, and
all five runners were off on the
track at a blistering pace. All
came back to the starting zone
after the first leg after just 1:20,
a pace that would prove difficult
to keep up.
The first lap, you see, is easy.
You've only had one beer, and
if you can get a quick, good
burp out of the way in the first
100 meters, you're golden. You
almost don't even feel it.
In Lap 2, things get a little
complicated. You get back to
the line where your lovely
friends have a beer waiting for
you. But you want to breathe —
you don't really want to drink.
Nevertheless, this is serious
competition, so pound you do
as you attempt to build a lead on
your opponents.
Apache threw his second can
down before the two-minute
mark and was off again. Butter
bean followed on his heels, with
me right after him as we left
Shrelvis and Doo-Rag back
amongst the hops.
Lap 3 is what really separates
the men from the boys. Apache
(now calling himself "The Au
thority") built on his lead as he
finished his third beer just as the
three of us (Shrelvis, Butter
bean and myself) came back to
the line.
"Finishing the third lap,"
Butterbean said after the race,
"your whole stomach feels like a
beer can that some four-year
old is just shaking the hell out of.
And you're just waiting for it to
explode all over the place."
We didn't have to wait long.
We had narrowed the gap on
"The Authority" and finished
Lap 3 before he finished his
last beer.
"Hey, guys," Butterbean
said, "he's slowing down!"
"Butterbean!" yelled
Shrelvis. "We're all slowing
down!" He wasn't joking. My
beer was still full. You know how
hard it is to pound cold beer
when you're winded? Stop
laughing and try it sometime,
sucker.
Butterbean realized the truth
and started laughing. Bad deci
sion with a stomach full of beer.
The laugh turned into a Techni
color yawn in about six seconds.
Doo-rag pulled up to the line
just in time to see the damage as
his fourth and final beer stood in
a pool of, well, you know, on the
track.
"What the hell?!?" he said.
"No, no ... no way. Stop the


Matt Babin
clock. I'm not drinking that beer.
That beer has vomit all over it."
Hull)' Hot-Pants, one of our
cheerleaders, ran out with a new
beer for the competitor. Butter
bean, now doomed to the penalty
lap (required of all who lose their
cookies during the race) finished

his beer and set off behind
Shrelvis.
As we left, The Authority fin
ished. He was the clear winner, at
8:57. Shrelvis was just behind at
9:23, Butterbean at 10:42, and my
self, Cool Rubin, at 11:16. Doo-
Rag took a l)N F, having apparent
ly lost his game after Butterbean's
"Death from Above" on his beer.
We turned to the ladies in the
stands, looking for respect, admi
ration and encouragement.

"That was absolutely the most
painful thing 1 have ever watched
in my life," said one of them.
"It was disgusting," said the
other.
Well, there you have it. But you
see, we're not turned oil by state
ments like that. No, that only in
creases our will power to train
harder for the next matchup. The
beer mile, you see, much like the
triathlon, is more than the sum of
its parts.

Don't believe me? Train. Drink.
Run. And if you can't find anybody
to take you on, give me a call. I'll
beer mile with you.
1 lien the letter ended, with a
phone number. Will 1 call it? We'll
see. I think I need a little bit more
training first.

nomics who swears he doesn't know

you don't really want to drink.
Nevertheless, this is serious
competition, so pound you do
as you attempt to build a lead on
your opponents.
Apache threw his second can
down before the two-minute
mark and was off again. Butter
bean followed on his heels, with
me right after him as we left
Shrelvis and Doo-Rag back
amongst the hops.
Lap 3 is what really separates
the men from the boys. Apache
(now calling himself "The Au
thority") built on his lead as he
finished his third beer just as the
three of us (Shrelvis, Butter
bean and myself) came back to
the line.
"Finishing the third lap,"
Butterbean said after the race,
"your whole stomach feels like a
beer can that some four-year
old is just shaking the hell out of.
And you're just waiting for it to
explode all over the place."
We didn't have to wait long.
We had narrowed the gap on
"The Authority" and finished
Lap 3 before he finished his
last beer.
"Hey, guys," Butterbean
said, "he's slowing down!"
"Butterbean!" yelled
Shrelvis. "We're all slowing
down!" He wasn't joking. My
beer was still full. You know how
hard it is to pound cold beer
when you're winded? Stop
laughing and try it sometime,
sucker.
Butterbean realized the truth
and started laughing. Bad deci
sion with a stomach full of beer.
The laugh turned into a Techni
color yawn in about six seconds.
Doo-rag pulled up to the line
just in time to see the damage as
his fourth and final beer stood in
a pool of, well, you know, on the
track.
"What the hell?!?" he said.
"No, no ... no way. Stop the


Matt Babin
clock. I'm not drinking that beer.
That beer has vomit all over it."
Hull)' Hot-Pants, one of our
cheerleaders, ran out with a new
beer for the competitor. Butter
bean, now doomed to the penalty
lap (required of all who lose their
cookies during the race) finished

his beer and set off behind
Shrelvis.
As we left, The Authority fin
ished. He was the clear winner, at
8:57. Shrelvis was just behind at
9:23, Butterbean at 10:42, and my
self, Cool Rubin, at 11:16. Doo-
Rag took a l)N F, having apparent
ly lost his game after Butterbean's
"Death from Above" on his beer.
We turned to the ladies in the
stands, looking for respect, admi
ration and encouragement.

"That was absolutely the most
painful thing 1 have ever watched
in my life," said one of them.
"It was disgusting," said the
other.
Well, there you have it. But you
see, we're not turned oil by state
ments like that. No, that only in
creases our will power to train
harder for the next matchup. The
beer mile, you see, much like the
triathlon, is more than the sum of
its parts.

Don't believe me? Train. Drink.
Run. And if you can't find anybody
to take you on, give me a call. I'll
beer mile with you.
1 lien the letter ended, with a
phone number. Will 1 call it? We'll
see. I think I need a little bit more
training first.

The letter I found
slipped under my door
in the midst of my resi
dents' board bills was a
simple piece of notebook paper,
folded in thirds and taped shut.
There was a picture of a koala
bear pasted onto the front.
"The perfect column" it said
on the front.
I ley, it's not often that I get
actual letters in response to

these things, so
I opened it up.
And while I'm
going to say it's
not perfect, the
contents en

are pretty
damn good —
good enough

to be reproduced here in their

So sit back, relax and enjoy:

who cares? If you really want to
see competitive digestive ath
letics at its finest, you need to
listen to my story — the story of
the Beer Mile."
(At this point 1 was a little wor
ried that this letter was like the
video in"The Ring" — that the
"Beer Mile" would come to kill
me by the end of the week. In fact,
I'm still not sure that it won't.)
There were seven of us, the
letter continued, who descend
ed upon the track that cold and
starry night — five athletes and
two stunningly beautiful cheer
leaders who we had convinced
to clear the empty cans and
place out new ones while we ran.
Mostly they just laughed at us
and called us stupid. But never
mind that.
In Lane 1 we had the clear fa
vorite, Ike "Apache" Whitaker.
Ike isn't even in college anymore,
but that didn't stop him from
showing up and talking all kinds
ofsmack. In Lane 2 was the dark
horse candidate, Shrelvis. He
was quiet as he toed the line, ap
parently visualizing his victory.
Lane 3 held my roommate, Steve
"Butterbean" Prefontaine, while
I, Cool Rubin, stood confident in
Lane 4. To my right in the final
lane was Roo "Doo-Rag" Nichol
son, a converted extreme moun
tain biker.
The premise of the beer mile
is easy. It combines the two ac
tivities of drinking beer and
running a mile. A participant
drinks a beer, then runs a 400-
meter lap of the track. Four rep
etitions equals four beers, and
one mile. Fastest time wins. Sim
ple enough, you say?
That's what we thought, as

well. And, with a salvo of alu
minum pop tops, we began the
competition. The first beer was
gone in about 15 seconds, and
all five runners were off on the
track at a blistering pace. All
came back to the starting zone
after the first leg after just 1:20,
a pace that would prove difficult
to keep up.
The first lap, you see, is easy.
You've only had one beer, and
if you can get a quick, good
burp out of the way in the first
100 meters, you're golden. You
almost don't even feel it.
In Lap 2, things get a little
complicated. You get back to
the line where your lovely
friends have a beer waiting for
you. But you want to breathe —
you don't really want to drink.
Nevertheless, this is serious
competition, so pound you do
as you attempt to build a lead on
your opponents.
