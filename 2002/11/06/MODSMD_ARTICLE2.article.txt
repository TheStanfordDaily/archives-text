# Five state props pass
## 
### CORINA YEN 
Stanford students and other
California residents came out to
vote yesterday on seven state
propositions, numbered 46
through 52. Propositions that
passed will provide for projects
such as housing and emergency
shelter, education facilities, after
school programs and water quali
ty. Proposition 52, which would
have permitted Election Day voter
registration, and Proposition 51,
which would have set aside fund
ing for several transportation pro
jects, were defeated.
Proposition 52
Proposition 52, which had 41
percent of the vote as of midnight,
would have allowed legally eligible
persons to register to vote the day
of the election with either a valid
California Driver's License or two
proofs of residence.
Students from out of state are

required to register again in Cali
fornia in order to vote instate elec
tions for office and ballot initia
tives. Proposition 52 was aimed at
facilitating voting for those who
find registering 15 days in advance
a hassle, such as out-of-state stu
dents and those who turn 18 near
the date of the election.
Despite the proposition's fail
ure, its advocates still remain
proud of the campaign and opti
mistic for the future.
Proposition 46
Proposition 40, which had gar
nered 58 percent of the vote as of
midnight, supports various hous
ing programs by allowing the state
to sell $2.1 billion in bonds. A fund
will be created to provide for pro
jects such as shelters for battered
women, housing for senior citizens
and low-income families, homeless
shelters with social services, and

emergency shelters.
Propositions 47 and 49
Proposition 47, which had 59
percent of the vote as of midnight,
allows the state to sell $13.05 bil
lion in bonds to fund construction
of new education facilities to re
lieve overcrowding and repair
older buildings in K-12 schools,
community colleges and state uni
versities.
Also addressing education,
Proposition 49 — which was
backed by actor Arnold
Schwarzenegger and had 56 per
cent of the vote as of midnight —
increases state-grant funds avail
able to before- and after-school
programs, providing tutoring,
homework assistance and educa
tional enrichment.
Supporters claim that this will
help reduce gang activity, drug
use and juvenile incarceration
while protecting kids and improv
ing grades. Those opposed said it

limited options for balancing the
budget in hard economic times
and thus takes money away from
more critical needs.
Other propositions
Proposition 50, which had 55
percent of the vote as of midnight,
authorizes the sale of $3.44 billion
in bonds for water quality, water
supply projects, safe drinking
water projects, and coastal land ac
quisition and protection.
Proposition 51, which had 42
percent of the vote as of midnight,
would have allowed 30 percent of
General Fund revenues from the
sales tax on the lease and sale of
motor vehicles to be open to use
exclusively for state and local
transportation-related purposes,
such as road and highway repair
and public transportation. Argu
ments against said it would in
crease budget deficits, tying up
spending on special interest pro
jects during a multi-billion-dollar
state budget problem.
Proposition 48, with 73 percent
of the vote as of midnight, had the
largest number of affirmative
votes of the state propositions.
