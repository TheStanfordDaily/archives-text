# Five state props pass
## 
### CORINA YEN 
Stanford students and other
California residents came out to
vote yesterday on seven state
propositions, numbered 46
through 52. Propositions that
passed will provide for projects
such as housing and emergency
shelter, education facilities, after
school programs and water quali
ty. Proposition 52, which would
have permitted Election Day voter
registration, and Proposition 51,
which would have set aside fund
ing for several transportation pro
jects, were defeated.
Proposition 52
Proposition 52, which had 41
percent of the vote as of midnight,
would have allowed legally eligible
persons to register to vote the day
of the election with either a valid
California Driver's License or two
proofs of residence.
Students from out of state are

required to register again in Cali
fornia in order to vote instate elec
tions for office and ballot initia
tives. Proposition 52 was aimed at
facilitating voting for those who
find registering 15 days in advance
a hassle, such as out-of-state stu
dents and those who turn 18 near
the date of the election.
Despite the proposition's fail
ure, its advocates still remain
proud of the campaign and opti
mistic for the future.
Proposition 46
Proposition 40, which had gar
nered 58 percent of the vote as of
midnight, supports various hous
ing programs by allowing the state
to sell $2.1 billion in bonds. A fund
will be created to provide for pro
jects such as shelters for battered
women, housing for senior citizens
and low-income families, homeless
shelters with social services, and
