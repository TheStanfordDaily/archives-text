## Vitascan technology sees your body in 3D New scanner utilizes electron beam tomography 
### BRONWYN BARNETT 
VITASCAN, a mobile imaging
center that uses the only FDA-ap
proved technology to detect heart
disease and cancer, is presenting
its devices at the Palo Alto Elks
Lodge this week.
VITASCAN uses an Electron
Beam Tomography scanner,
proven to detect early stages of
diseases that are often missed by
traditional computed tomogra
phy (CT) scans and other diag
nostic methods.
Due to the high cost of devel
oping the machines — approxi
mately $2.1 million each — there
are only 107 EBT scanners in the
United States, and there are only
two mobile units in California, ac
cording to Vitascan's CEO, Dan

Parker. Two stationary units in
San Francisco and Walnut Creek
have served the Bay Area in the
past.
"What we're trying to do is
bring the technology to the com
munities so that people don't
have to go to the hospital," Park
er said.
Coronary artery disease, the
blockage of heart arteries that
leads to a restriction of blood Mow,
is responsible for over 40 percent
of all deaths in the United States.
It is estimated that half of those
with heart disease do not even
know they have it.
"This may well be the best and
strongest predictor of heart at
tacks," said Dr. C. Alan Brown, a
fellow of the American College of
Cardiologists and a practicing
cardiologist at the Santa Barbara
Cottage Hospital. Brown is the
cardiac medical director of VI
TASCAN and a strong supporter
of EBT scanners for early detec
