## Vitascan technology sees your body in 3D New scanner utilizes electron beam tomography 
### BRONWYN BARNETT 
VITASCAN, a mobile imaging
center that uses the only FDA-ap
proved technology to detect heart
disease and cancer, is presenting
its devices at the Palo Alto Elks
Lodge this week.
VITASCAN uses an Electron
Beam Tomography scanner,
proven to detect early stages of
diseases that are often missed by
traditional computed tomogra
phy (CT) scans and other diag
nostic methods.
Due to the high cost of devel
oping the machines — approxi
mately $2.1 million each — there
are only 107 EBT scanners in the
United States, and there are only
two mobile units in California, ac
cording to Vitascan's CEO, Dan

Parker. Two stationary units in
San Francisco and Walnut Creek
have served the Bay Area in the
past.
"What we're trying to do is
bring the technology to the com
munities so that people don't
have to go to the hospital," Park
er said.
Coronary artery disease, the
blockage of heart arteries that
leads to a restriction of blood Mow,
is responsible for over 40 percent
of all deaths in the United States.
It is estimated that half of those
with heart disease do not even
know they have it.
"This may well be the best and
strongest predictor of heart at
tacks," said Dr. C. Alan Brown, a
fellow of the American College of
Cardiologists and a practicing
cardiologist at the Santa Barbara
Cottage Hospital. Brown is the
cardiac medical director of VI
TASCAN and a strong supporter
of EBT scanners for early detec

tion of heart disease.
"We used to think that heart at
tacks were caused by a large
buildup of calcium, which nar
rowed down the arteries," Brown
said. He cited new studies show
ing that 75 percent of heart at
tacks are the result of only mild
blockage that is often missed by
GT scans and stress tests.
Matthew Budoff, M.D., assis
tant professor of medicine at
UCLA, said that the use of EBT
scanners is not nearly as common
as cardiologists would like. Brown
and Budoff say this is because
many general practitioners do
not realize that most heart attacks
are caused by relatively small
amounts of blockage.
Brown also cited cholesterol as
a commonly used, but inadequate
indicator of cardiovascular
health. "Half the people who
make it to the hospital with a
heart attack have normal choles
terol levels," he said.
Unlike CT machines, EBT

scanners are electronic, which
makes them up to five times as
fast. "You get a much clearer pic
ture of heart arteries," Brown
said. The procedure also takes
less time than a CT scan, so the
patient is exposed to less radia
tion — about one tenth the
amount.
A full body scan takes less than
10 minutes. The patient remains
clothed, holds his breath as the
scanner passes over and takes a se
ries of pictures of internal organs.
The resulting three-dimen
sional image reveals the amount
of blockage inside the heart arter
ies or any potentially cancerous
tumors. The data is mailed from
the mobile unit to VITASCAN's
office in Santa Barbara where a
radiologist and cardiologist, both
board-certified, interpret the
data. The results are mailed to the
patient within 10 days.
Brown said that the three-di
mensional images are excellent
for encouraging lifestyle changes.
"Nothing is as powerful a motiva
tor as sitting down at a computer
with a patient and showing them
a giant, hulking mass of plaque in
their heart," he said. Patients are

provided with a CD-ROM con
taining their pictures to take
home.
A coronary calcium screening
costs $550, and a full body scan is
$995, part of which may be cov
ered by insurance. Doctors and
patients say it is well worth the ex
pense, for heart disease detection
as well as cancer detection.
Trudy Real, 72, of Ventura,
Calif., had a full body scan be
cause she was concerned about
her family's history of heart prob
lems. She said, "1 just laid down
and held my arms over my head
fora few minutes. It was no big
deal."
The scanner results showed
that while Real's heart was
healthy, there was an abnormality
in her lung, which turned out to
be cancerous.
Her doctors have told her that
because of the early detection, the
cancer was prevented from
spreading further, and her treat
ment has been more effective.
Real said, "I'm so grateful that
I went. I would really like to en
courage people to spend the
money and have it done. It was re
ally a lifesaver for me."

scanners are electronic, which
makes them up to five times as
fast. "You get a much clearer pic
ture of heart arteries," Brown
said. The procedure also takes
less time than a CT scan, so the
patient is exposed to less radia
tion — about one tenth the
amount.
A full body scan takes less than
10 minutes. The patient remains
clothed, holds his breath as the
scanner passes over and takes a se
ries of pictures of internal organs.
The resulting three-dimen
sional image reveals the amount
of blockage inside the heart arter
ies or any potentially cancerous
tumors. The data is mailed from
the mobile unit to VITASCAN's
office in Santa Barbara where a
radiologist and cardiologist, both
board-certified, interpret the
data. The results are mailed to the
patient within 10 days.
Brown said that the three-di
mensional images are excellent
for encouraging lifestyle changes.
"Nothing is as powerful a motiva
tor as sitting down at a computer
with a patient and showing them
a giant, hulking mass of plaque in
their heart," he said. Patients are

provided with a CD-ROM con
taining their pictures to take
home.
A coronary calcium screening
costs $550, and a full body scan is
$995, part of which may be cov
ered by insurance. Doctors and
patients say it is well worth the ex
pense, for heart disease detection
as well as cancer detection.
Trudy Real, 72, of Ventura,
Calif., had a full body scan be
cause she was concerned about
her family's history of heart prob
lems. She said, "1 just laid down
and held my arms over my head
fora few minutes. It was no big
deal."
The scanner results showed
that while Real's heart was
healthy, there was an abnormality
in her lung, which turned out to
be cancerous.
Her doctors have told her that
because of the early detection, the
cancer was prevented from
spreading further, and her treat
ment has been more effective.
Real said, "I'm so grateful that
I went. I would really like to en
courage people to spend the
money and have it done. It was re

VITASCAN, a mobile imaging
center that uses the only FDA-ap
proved technology to detect heart
disease and cancer, is presenting
its devices at the Palo Alto Elks
Lodge this week.
VITASCAN uses an Electron
Beam Tomography scanner,
proven to detect early stages of
diseases that are often missed by
traditional computed tomogra
phy (CT) scans and other diag
nostic methods.
Due to the high cost of devel
oping the machines — approxi
mately $2.1 million each — there
are only 107 EBT scanners in the
United States, and there are only
two mobile units in California, ac
cording to Vitascan's CEO, Dan

Parker. Two stationary units in
San Francisco and Walnut Creek
have served the Bay Area in the
past.
"What we're trying to do is
bring the technology to the com
munities so that people don't
have to go to the hospital," Park
er said.
Coronary artery disease, the
blockage of heart arteries that
leads to a restriction of blood Mow,
is responsible for over 40 percent
of all deaths in the United States.
It is estimated that half of those
with heart disease do not even
know they have it.
"This may well be the best and
strongest predictor of heart at
tacks," said Dr. C. Alan Brown, a
fellow of the American College of
Cardiologists and a practicing
cardiologist at the Santa Barbara
Cottage Hospital. Brown is the
cardiac medical director of VI
TASCAN and a strong supporter
of EBT scanners for early detec

tion of heart disease.
"We used to think that heart at
tacks were caused by a large
buildup of calcium, which nar
rowed down the arteries," Brown
said. He cited new studies show
ing that 75 percent of heart at
tacks are the result of only mild
blockage that is often missed by
GT scans and stress tests.
Matthew Budoff, M.D., assis
tant professor of medicine at
UCLA, said that the use of EBT
scanners is not nearly as common
as cardiologists would like. Brown
and Budoff say this is because
many general practitioners do
not realize that most heart attacks
are caused by relatively small
amounts of blockage.
Brown also cited cholesterol as
a commonly used, but inadequate
indicator of cardiovascular
health. "Half the people who
make it to the hospital with a
heart attack have normal choles
terol levels," he said.
Unlike CT machines, EBT

scanners are electronic, which
makes them up to five times as
fast. "You get a much clearer pic

said. The procedure also takes
