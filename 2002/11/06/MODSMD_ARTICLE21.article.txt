# Failing your classes? Blame your enzyme
## 
### AMIT GARG STAFF WRITER 
Imagine you are in the middle
of your midterm and suddenly
cannot remember that crucial fact
that would have saved you.
Chances are an enzyme in your
brain might have actually "erased"
the information. UCLA scientists
studying memory in mice found
an enzyme called I*l*l that works to
clear the brain of useless informa
tion. Rats with blocked or un
blocked PPI learned at the same
rate, but those rats with blocked
PPI did not forget things as quick
ly as those with unblocked PPI.
The researchers have not yet stud
ied I*l* 1 in humans, but believe it
might lead to a better understand
ing of memory-destructive dis
eases such as Alzheimer's.

For years, scientists have hy
pothesized that there is a black
hole in the center of the Milky

Way. This year, an international
team of astronomers pho
tographed a star at speeds close to
1 1 million miles per hour, barely
17 light years away from the cen
ter. The astronomers have been
tracking this star for nearly a
decade and its orbit lits that of a
black hole. The scientists concede
that only an event horizon, which
occurs when an object is engulfed
by a black hole, would truly con
firm that a black hole exists in the
center of the Milky Way.
The latest craze in toning mus
cles is the "super slow" workout.
Developed in 1982, the workout
consists of two 20-minute sessions a
week during which participants do
five repetitions of muscle toning ex
ercises at six different weight ma
chines. Critics say that at this pace
and with almost no rest, muscles
will start to quake and the stomach
becomes queasy. The Journal of
Sports Medicine and Physical Fit

ness found that beginners had 50
percent more muscle growth than
those using other weight training
methods. I lowever, only two of the
147 participants in the study chose
to continue the program.
Last month, Nature published
evidence showing that the compu
tational models developed by
Stanford's Pande Lab behave like
real proteins. The research group,
known as Folding@Home, tries to
understand how proteins fold in
order to understand their func
tions. Since calculating folding tra
jectories is computationally expen

sive, the group uses distributed
computing, which means data in
the form of a screensaver is sent to
researchers around the world.
The server collects the results and
allows the scientists to analyze the
data that would previously have
taken years to obtain, through
standard computational methods.
Lithium has joined the list of
elements classified as supercon
ducters. Superconductors allow
energy transfer with minimal re
sistance and are ideal for long-dis
tance transmissions. Japanese
physicists at Osaka and Tokyo
found that lithium can acquire
these properties if subjected to
pressures in excess of 30 gigapas
cals, which is 300,000 times more
than normal atmospheric pres
sure. American scientists have also
observed the same phenomena in
dense lithium.
Is computer music just about
playing MP3s? Think again.
Charles Nichols at the University
of Montana has developed a virtu
al violin that allows musicians to
create slight differences in sound
with very subtle arm movements.
The v√üow is a fiber glass rod riding
in a channel and connected to a vi
olin-shaped base. Attached to it are
sensors and cables that capture
slight fiddling movements. Nichols
is now developing a counterpart
string and body and hopes to have
a complete virtual violin in the
next few years.
