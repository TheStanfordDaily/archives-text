# PC makers hardwire security to raise trust
## 
### 
SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — To
thwart hackers and lbster online
commerce, the next generation of
computers will almost certainly
cede some control to software firms,
Hollywood and other outsiders.
That could break a long-stand
ing tenet of computing: that PC
owners ultimately control data on
their own machines.
Microsoft calls its technology
"Palladium." Intel dubs it "La-
Grande." An industry group that
includes these companies, IBM,
Hewlett-Packard and 170 others
terms it "trusted computing."
Though the initiatives have
technical differences, they share
the goal of hardwiring security into
silicon and related software —a
leap beyond today's less-secure
mechanisms, which are coded into
programs to protect data.
"This is a fundamentally new
approach as opposed to taking a
software-only, Band-Aid ap
proach," said Narendar Sahgal, a
software planning manager at
Intel.
The efforts would help protect
movies and other digital content
from piracy and even personal
copying, and critics see few benefits
for consumers.
"I don't think the kind of trust
worthiness they seek to deliver is at
all desirable," said Ross Anderson,
a security researcher at Cambridge
University. "It's not security for
me. It's security for them."
The companies and content
providers behind the initiative
claim that by protecting data from
external attacks and unlawful trad
ing they'll be able to unlock the po
tential of computing itself.
The key is creating a realm in
computing where each bit of com
munication — an e-mail, an online
purchase, a check of a database, the
reading of a document — can be
achieved only by interacting with
secured, uniquely identified hard
ware through "trusted agents."
Each agent would enforce poli
cies set by senders, recipients, copy

right holders or a combination that
would decide how the content can
be used.
In this realm, Hollywood could
safely release its works. The health
care and financial industries could
communicate with clients without
fear of leaks.
And ordinary users could rest
assured that critical information
won't be stolen or wrecked by the
virus du jour or hackers.
"There are certain transactions
and certain businesses where you
need to understand and trust the
device you're talking to," said Scott
Dinsdale, executive vice president
of digital strategy for the Motion
Picture Association of America.
Developers of the new technolo
gy say they're just building trusted
platforms, not setting any policies
lor using them.
All emphasize that specific tasks
— such as managing digital rights
— can be built on top of their tech
nologies but are not part of the ini
tiatives.
Peter Biddle, Microsoft's prod
uct manager for Palladium, said it
would not empower copyright
holders to reach into consumers'
computers and make "untrusted"
documents — such as music files —
disappear.
In fact, he said, users could use
Palladium to protect content from
scans and hacks by copyright hold
ers, who have lately employed in
trusive methods in a bid to curb
piracy.
Computers with the new capa
bilities are not expected for several
years, but critics say the details re
leased so far do not bode well for
open computing.
Trustworthiness would be
achieved by giving users two choic
es: trusted and untrusted. On a
computer running in untrusted
mode, information would be
shared just as it has been for the
past 20 years. It's also still vulnera
ble to attack.
The trusted realm, however,
would be immune from such at

tack. Data and memory would be
contained in a virtual vault. Keys
would be held by a chip that lets in
only trusted software.
Content creators could write
and enforce rules that determine
whether a file could, for instance,
be distributed or printed. They
could prohibit untrusted machines
from accessing a trusted docu
ment.
Palladium, LaGrande and oth
ers are being designed to enforce
existing rules and ones devised in
the future.
Scott Charney, Microsoft's chief
security strategist, said users and
providers will set the rules—just as
they do today. The difference, he
said, is that the new technologies
will create a secure environment

for enforcing those rules.
Critics fear, however, that it will
be the end user who might end up
being trusted I he least in the brave
new world of trusted computing.
Creators of trusted programs
could resort to draconian tactics to
ensure their policies are enforced,
Anderson said.
Programs found to be illegally
copied could be rendered useless
remotely. Sensitive e-mail, which
might be useful in investigations,
could vanish. And e-books could
be subjected to virtual book
burnings.
Industry pioneer David P.
Reed, formerly the chief scientist at
Lotus Development Corp., called

the initiatives "booby traps."
"I'm personally angry and dis
gusted that. . . companies that
grew up because of the personal
computer revolution, which em
powered users, are now acting to
harm the users," Reed said.
Supporters, however, argue that
the new architecture will create
more opportunities than it limits, as
more and more consumers and
content providers tiy things they
now avoid because of insecurity.
Biddle said laws and regula
tions that now protect sensitive
documents from shredding also
should bar the destruction of e
mail or other computer-generated
material.
Moreover, users will continue
to have control, because they can
always choose not run the security
features, Charney and other trust
ed-computing supporters say.
But those who refuse risk limit
ing choices, just as people who
refuse to buy the Windows operat
ing system are closed out of a com
puting world dominated by Mi
crosoft, Anderson said.
Seth Schoen, staff technologist
at the Electronic Frontier Founda
tion, said incompatibility is the
biggest threat posted by the trust
ed-computing initiatives.
"I don't think anyone can ab
solutely compel you to do any
thing in particular," he said.
"What they can do is create an in
compatibility or refuse to deal
with you unless you meet a par
ticular condition."
Charney promised that Mi
crosoft will not misuse the tech
nology.
"Listen to what we say and
watch what we do. Actions speak
louder than words," Charney said.
"And then if we're saying 'X' but
doing 'Y,' not only will we lose trust
but our brand is hurt and we lose
market share."
