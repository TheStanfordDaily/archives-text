# Surfing for beaches:
## Activism goes online 
### 
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)
— California's 1,100-mile coast
has a new watchdog: a retired
tech mogul with a helicopter and
a digital camera who is posting
detailed photos on the Internet
of every inch of oceanfront, from
the redwood-studded cliffs of the
north to the rows of mansions
crowding the south.
Ken Adelman's two-week-old
Internet site, the California
Coastal Records Project, already
attracts thousands of viewers
daily and is being called one of
the biggest technological ad
vances ever for environmental
activism.
"You can click and see bull
dozers on the beach," said Sierra
Club coastal director Mark Mas
sara. "You can see funky home
made seawalls and coastal re
source degradation."
Property rights defenders
worry the images will encourage
vigilantes and spur desktop
"bounty hunting" for land use vi
olations.
Since March, Adelman and his
wife, Gabrielle, a helicopter
pilot, have flown nearly all of the
state's shoreline, shooting high
resolution digital pictures every
three seconds — more than
10,000 — each capturing 500
feet of oceanfront.
The Web database eventually
will total about 13,000 images, an
unprecedented record of the
coast as it exists in 2002.
Adelman, 39, planned to pho
tograph one final stretch this
week between Eureka and Bode
ga Bay. He said he would re
shoot the busier stretches of coast
over time to reveal the changes.
"It's more than taking pic
tures," said Adelman, who
founded TGV Software and Net
work Alchemy and sold them to
Cisco Systems and Nokia during
the tech boom of the 19905. "It's

making them available to the
public.
"The development interests
control the development by con
trolling the information. It's
hard to argue with a picture.
We're taking the truth to the
public."
Environmental groups have
taken notice of the project's de
tail.
Massara has been on the
phone daily with California
Coastal Commission enforce
ment officers pointing out prop
erty owners' violations of state
law.
Commission spokeswoman
Sarah Christie said staffers are al
ready using the Web site, and
Coastal Commissioner Shirley S.
Dettloff called it a "wonderful
tool" for decision-makers.
"Many times we get a project
well described in staff reports
and then get grainy photos,"
Dettloff said. "Now we can go on
line ... and take a look at the pro
ject, not only in itself, but in rela
tionship to surrounding areas."
Attorney Harold Johnson,
representing the Sacramento
based Pacific Legal Foundation,
a legal arm for private property
rights, fears Adelman's photo
database may lead the commis
sion into "a new era of detail-ob
sessed dictation to property
owners."
"They've had a sort of tenden
cy of wanting to be microman
agers over the years. If this pro
ject sets off another round of that
kind of activity, I think there's
going to be a lot of distress over
that," he said.
Massara waves oil the threat,
saying if coastal property owners
"aren't in violation of the law
they have nothing to worry
about."
Paul Hawken, a California
based tech entrepreneur and
author of business and ecology
books, called Adelman's project
a breakthrough that would re
make government planning and
land ownership regulations.
"In 10 years you will be able to
go to the Web as an individual and
click on a region, a place, a beach,
an island, a forest, a delta a river, a
trail head, whatever, a city. Then
you'll be able to hit a button where
you can go to animated form and
see the change over time," he said.
