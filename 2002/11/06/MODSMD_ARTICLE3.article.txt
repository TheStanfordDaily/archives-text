# ASSU reveals $350,000 surplus
## 
### ELIZABETH MADJLESSI STAFF WRITER 
At last night's meeting, the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate an
nounced that it had a potential
$350,000 surplus in the special fee
budget, posing a question for the
Senate as to how the unexpected
windfall could best be utilized.
Every year, Stanford groups
request special fees to fund their
various programs. The ASSU es
sentially taxes undergraduate and
graduate students and distributes
the proceeds to the groups.
"[Some students] get a refund
of their special fee," said Senate
Chair Bo Cowgill, a senior. "The
options are either to take this
money away from the student
groups, or initially to take too
much money from students to
create a special-fee buffer ac
count to insulate the system from
refund requests or to compen
sate candidates for being left off
the ballot."
The ASSU uses the latter ap
proach, and there is currently be
tween $500,000 and $600,000 in

the account created for this pur
pose. Over the last few months, a
model was developed which indi
cates that there only needs to be
$200,000 available to make com
pensations.
"Five hundred thousand dol
lars is too much money, according
to the analysis," Cowgill said.
"Based on simulations of how
many students ask for with
drawals, $200,000 is safe . . . The
Graduate Student Council calcu
lated the refund rate without tak
ing into account how graduate
and undergraduate students dif
fer in their refund patterns."
ASSU Vice President Nick Ro
driguez, a junior, said, "This
$300,000 can be used conserva
tively as a return to students year
by-year, or as a windfall just to
spend."
Cowgill indicated that a refund
for students is unlikely, as there
may be incentive to leave the sur
plus in an account to gain interest
and serve the ASSU endowment.
"One idea is to buy something
big and useful, like an online
banking system or a new student

union," Cowgill said. "Other op
tions would be ceasing to charge
the extra fee, but even if the fund
doesn't grow, there is $350,000
extra not going to good use."
Senate Appropriations Co-
Chair Josh Schipp, a sophomore,
said, "Since graduate students
also paid into this surplus, the
funds should go towards some
thing that benefits both groups."
At the meeting, Rodriguez also
updated the Senate on the
progress of University President
John Hennessy's agreement to at
tend a town hall meeting this
quarter, with a date to be an
nounced next week, as well as
Provost John Etchemendy's dec i
sion to host a similar event winter
quarter.
Surveys are being posted which
will allow dorm representatives to
gauge student sentiments toward
the topics Hennessy should cover
at the meeting, the University's al
cohol policy and the best locations
in San Francisco for Marguerite
transportation to pick students up
at 1 a.m. on Saturdays and Sun
days during winter quarter.
