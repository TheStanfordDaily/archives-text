# Seniors struggle with job market
## 
### JULIE TUNG 
Editors Note: This article is the first in a
three-part series investigating the impact
of the economy on seniors plans for after
graduation.

Despite complaints from seniors
that the struggling economy has
made jobs in the technical and busi
ness sectors nearly impossible to
come by, most students have found
that taking a proactive role in the job
search and looking at more diverse
options has compensated for dwin
dling hiring projections.
According to a September survey
by the National Association of Col
leges and Employers, companies
plan to hire 3.6 percent fewer col
lege graduates than they did in
2001-2002.
By region, the West experienced
the brunt of the decline, projecting
15.7 percent fewer hirings of college
graduates than last year. Outlooks
for the Northeast and the South are
only somewhat less discouraging,
with decreases of 8.1 and 1.5 per
cent, respectively. ()nly the Midwest
predicts an increase in college hir

ing, at 11.2 percent more hires than
the previous year.
"I see some students overreact
ing to the employment situation,
but others are just realizing that they
have to work at this and be willing to
go out and find out what companies
are out there," said Lance (-hoy, di
rector of the Career Development
Center.
Active recruiting by employers
has diminished dramatically in the
last several years. Stanford's career
fair last month showcased approxi
mately 200 companies, in contrast
to on-campus recruitment efforts
two years ago, when the fair boasted
close to 400 companies. In addition,
the majority of companies still re
cruiting are hiring for fewer posi
tions, Choy said.
Technical and financial indus
tries have been hit the hardest, with
hiring predictions for engineering
firms and financial services compa
nies both down by about 11 percent,
according to the NACE.
"It's tougher, but it's definitely
not an impossible job market out
there," said Darren Lewis, a coter
minal student in computer science.

"Students are just having to work
harder to find those jobs, since com
panies aren't coming out to the stu
dents as much anymore."
However, not all sectors are ex
periencing the same cutbacks, ('hoy
cites national security and defense,
public service and the biotech in
dustry as areas of continued growth.
To better market themselves,
students seem to be spending more
lime researching their options and
looking into company back
grounds. More students are coming
into the CDC office, using the li
brary resources and accessing the
CDC Web site, Choy said.
Also, many are considering niche
companies that might not have as
much prestige but perhaps have
more opportunity for growth or
other redeeming factors.
"Students are realizing that there
are other companies out there, ones
they wouldn't have considered be
fore," Choy said. "And they're look
ing al areas other than just invest
ment banking and consulting,
which isn't necessarily a bad thing."
In the waning job market, in
ternships have become more crucial
than ever. A suney conducted by
NACE of more than 450 companies
across the nation ranked intern
ships as the number-one college re
cruitment method. Employee refer
rals and career and job fairs fol
lowed closely behind.
"Some companies have shut
down their college hiring but still
have their internship programs
open," Choy said.
After graduation, many students
are entering internship programs in
hopes that the internship will result
in an ofler of full employment, or
that at least they will gain valuable
skills for future opportunities.
" Internships are a great way fora
company to get to know the student
and for the student to get to know
the company," said sophomore Ar
turo Garcia, Jr., a peer counselor at
the CDC. "It also puts the student
on an inside track when the full
time job search begins."
For Eileen Chao, a senior double

majoring in economics and commu
nication, interning has certainly
paid off. While her postgraduate
plans are not yet fixed, she already
lias an employment offer from the
company where she interned last
summer. Chao attributes much of
her success to her avid involvement
in extracurricular pursuits.
"I think that what's really impor
tant is going into activities and being
a leader in those activities; it's actual
ly a lot like what you do in high
school to get into college," Chao said.
"But it's more focused. You have to
figure out what you want to do first."
Hie CDC also emphasizes the
importance of networking in thejob
search.
"I am seeing students get more
savvy about the need for network
ing with alumni," said Laura
Dominguez-Chan, a career coun
selor at die CDC. "For example, see
if any alumni from the debate team
or swim team are in a field you may
also have an interest in and contact
that individual to ask questions
about their experience in the field."
Graduate education has also be
come an increasingly popular alter
native to entering the tight job mar
ket. In fact, across the nation, law

school applications last year spiked
by 17.4 percent for fall 2002 en
trance, according to the Law School
Admission Council. Graduate pro
grams in every discipline have seen
marked upsurges in applicant pools.
"1 wasn't sure if I wanted to
coterm last year, but I looked at how
bad the job market was at the time,

and that was definitely a factor in my
decision," Lewis said.
However, despite dramatic in
creases in applications to graduate
school in the past few years, there
are actually about 100 fewer Stan
lord students and alumni who ap
plied to graduate school in October
this year than there were in 2001.

CDC Web site, Choy said.
Also, many are considering niche
companies that might not have as
much prestige but perhaps have
more opportunity for growth or
other redeeming factors.
"Students are realizing that there
are other companies out there, ones
they wouldn't have considered be
fore," Choy said. "And they're look
ing al areas other than just invest
ment banking and consulting,
which isn't necessarily a bad thing."
In the waning job market, in
ternships have become more crucial
than ever. A suney conducted by
NACE of more than 450 companies
across the nation ranked intern
ships as the number-one college re
cruitment method. Employee refer
rals and career and job fairs fol
lowed closely behind.
"Some companies have shut
down their college hiring but still
have their internship programs
open," Choy said.
After graduation, many students
are entering internship programs in
hopes that the internship will result
in an ofler of full employment, or
that at least they will gain valuable
skills for future opportunities.
" Internships are a great way fora
company to get to know the student
and for the student to get to know
the company," said sophomore Ar
turo Garcia, Jr., a peer counselor at
the CDC. "It also puts the student
on an inside track when the full
time job search begins."
For Eileen Chao, a senior double

majoring in economics and commu
nication, interning has certainly
paid off. While her postgraduate
plans are not yet fixed, she already
lias an employment offer from the
company where she interned last
summer. Chao attributes much of
her success to her avid involvement
in extracurricular pursuits.
"I think that what's really impor
tant is going into activities and being
a leader in those activities; it's actual
ly a lot like what you do in high
school to get into college," Chao said.
"But it's more focused. You have to
figure out what you want to do first."
Hie CDC also emphasizes the
importance of networking in thejob
search.
"I am seeing students get more
savvy about the need for network
ing with alumni," said Laura
Dominguez-Chan, a career coun
selor at die CDC. "For example, see
if any alumni from the debate team
or swim team are in a field you may
also have an interest in and contact
that individual to ask questions
about their experience in the field."
Graduate education has also be
come an increasingly popular alter
native to entering the tight job mar
ket. In fact, across the nation, law

school applications last year spiked
by 17.4 percent for fall 2002 en
trance, according to the Law School
Admission Council. Graduate pro
grams in every discipline have seen
marked upsurges in applicant pools.
"1 wasn't sure if I wanted to
coterm last year, but I looked at how
bad the job market was at the time,

and that was definitely a factor in my
decision," Lewis said.
However, despite dramatic in
creases in applications to graduate
school in the past few years, there
are actually about 100 fewer Stan
lord students and alumni who ap
plied to graduate school in October
this year than there were in 2001.
Editors Note: This article is the first in a
three-part series investigating the impact
of the economy on seniors plans for after
graduation.

Despite complaints from seniors
that the struggling economy has
made jobs in the technical and busi
ness sectors nearly impossible to
come by, most students have found
that taking a proactive role in the job
search and looking at more diverse
options has compensated for dwin
dling hiring projections.
According to a September survey
by the National Association of Col
leges and Employers, companies
plan to hire 3.6 percent fewer col
lege graduates than they did in
2001-2002.
By region, the West experienced
the brunt of the decline, projecting
15.7 percent fewer hirings of college
graduates than last year. Outlooks
for the Northeast and the South are
only somewhat less discouraging,
with decreases of 8.1 and 1.5 per
cent, respectively. ()nly the Midwest
predicts an increase in college hir

ing, at 11.2 percent more hires than
the previous year.
"I see some students overreact
ing to the employment situation,
but others are just realizing that they
have to work at this and be willing to
go out and find out what companies
are out there," said Lance (-hoy, di
rector of the Career Development
Center.
Active recruiting by employers
has diminished dramatically in the
last several years. Stanford's career
fair last month showcased approxi
mately 200 companies, in contrast
to on-campus recruitment efforts
two years ago, when the fair boasted
close to 400 companies. In addition,
the majority of companies still re
cruiting are hiring for fewer posi
tions, Choy said.
Technical and financial indus
tries have been hit the hardest, with
hiring predictions for engineering
firms and financial services compa
nies both down by about 11 percent,
according to the NACE.
"It's tougher, but it's definitely
not an impossible job market out
there," said Darren Lewis, a coter
minal student in computer science.

"Students are just having to work
harder to find those jobs, since com
panies aren't coming out to the stu
dents as much anymore."
However, not all sectors are ex
periencing the same cutbacks, ('hoy
cites national security and defense,
public service and the biotech in
dustry as areas of continued growth.
To better market themselves,
students seem to be spending more
lime researching their options and
looking into company back
grounds. More students are coming
into the CDC office, using the li
brary resources and accessing the
CDC Web site, Choy said.
Also, many are considering niche
companies that might not have as
