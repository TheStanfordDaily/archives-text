# Seniors struggle with job market
## 
### JULIE TUNG 
Editors Note: This article is the first in a
three-part series investigating the impact
of the economy on seniors plans for after
graduation.

Despite complaints from seniors
that the struggling economy has
made jobs in the technical and busi
ness sectors nearly impossible to
come by, most students have found
that taking a proactive role in the job
search and looking at more diverse
options has compensated for dwin
dling hiring projections.
According to a September survey
by the National Association of Col
leges and Employers, companies
plan to hire 3.6 percent fewer col
lege graduates than they did in
2001-2002.
By region, the West experienced
the brunt of the decline, projecting
15.7 percent fewer hirings of college
graduates than last year. Outlooks
for the Northeast and the South are
only somewhat less discouraging,
with decreases of 8.1 and 1.5 per
cent, respectively. ()nly the Midwest
predicts an increase in college hir

ing, at 11.2 percent more hires than
the previous year.
"I see some students overreact
ing to the employment situation,
but others are just realizing that they
have to work at this and be willing to
go out and find out what companies
are out there," said Lance (-hoy, di
rector of the Career Development
Center.
Active recruiting by employers
has diminished dramatically in the
last several years. Stanford's career
fair last month showcased approxi
mately 200 companies, in contrast
to on-campus recruitment efforts
two years ago, when the fair boasted
close to 400 companies. In addition,
the majority of companies still re
cruiting are hiring for fewer posi
tions, Choy said.
Technical and financial indus
tries have been hit the hardest, with
hiring predictions for engineering
firms and financial services compa
nies both down by about 11 percent,
according to the NACE.
"It's tougher, but it's definitely
not an impossible job market out
there," said Darren Lewis, a coter
minal student in computer science.

"Students are just having to work
harder to find those jobs, since com
panies aren't coming out to the stu
dents as much anymore."
However, not all sectors are ex
periencing the same cutbacks, ('hoy
cites national security and defense,
public service and the biotech in
dustry as areas of continued growth.
To better market themselves,
students seem to be spending more
lime researching their options and
looking into company back
grounds. More students are coming
into the CDC office, using the li
brary resources and accessing the
CDC Web site, Choy said.
Also, many are considering niche
companies that might not have as
much prestige but perhaps have
more opportunity for growth or
other redeeming factors.
"Students are realizing that there
are other companies out there, ones
they wouldn't have considered be
fore," Choy said. "And they're look
ing al areas other than just invest
ment banking and consulting,
which isn't necessarily a bad thing."
