# Mausoleum Party joins deceased
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF 
For the first time in over 10 years,
Halloween passed by without Stan
lord's annual Mausoleum Party, a
University tradition in which stu
dents don ghoulish garb and dance
near the final resting place of Jane
and Leland Stanford. Contrary to
rumor, a change in the priorities of
the Stanford Alumni Association —
not a lack of funding — was re
sponsible for the party's demise.
In previous years, the Mau
soleum Party was organized by the
Stanford Student Alumni Net
work, the student branch of the
SAA. In August 2001, STAN's exis
tence came to an end due to low
participation and a shift in the
SAA's resources. Later that sum
mer, the SAA announced that it
would withdraw its financial and
stalf support of the party.
" Hie SAA Student Programs De
partment wants to develop pro
grams that foster more student
alumni interaction and network
ing," said Victor Madrigal, SAA di
rector of student programs. "Events
like Full Moon on the Quad and the
Mausoleum Party do not help our
department meet that need. Few
students ever realized that we were

responsible for organizing these two
events — I don't think it mattered to
them who organized the events."
The SAA notified ASSU officers
and key Student Affairs staff of its
decision in August 2001. While the
organization of Full Moon on the
Quad was taken on by the senior
class officers, the planning and
funding lor the Mausoleum Party
was left behind.
"Because Full Moon took place
so late in the year (10 days before
Halloween), the senior class officers
had to make a choice between tak
ing over the planning of Full Moon
or of the Mausoleum Party," said
Senior Class President James Alva.
"We felt that Full Moon was target
ed more towards seniors, so we

chose to organize that."
The officers formed a student
group to fund Full Moon in future
years, and they hope that it will per
form the same function for the
Mausoleum Party.The officers also
arranged for six buses to transport
seniors to the Castro district of San
Francisco for Halloween festivities.
"Castro was a lot of fun — defi
nitely a unique experience," said se
nior Chris Golman. "I am really
glad that the senior class Was able to
arrange the buses for us to go. The
Mausoleum Party has gone on for
the last three years, so it was cool to
do something different."
Freshmen expressed disap
pointment that they missed out on
the University tradition.

"My friends from Berkeley told
me not to miss the Mausoleum
Party," said freshman Jennie
Broder. "And we didn't even have
one this year. Halloween felt pretty
uneventful."
Madrigal has hopes for the re
sumption of the Mausoleum Party
in the future.
"In the long run, student leader
ship and sponsorship of the Mau
soleum Party will net an event that
is probably more responsive to the
social and entertainment needs of
the student body," he said. "This
year's Full Moon on the Quad is a
perfect example of what I mean —
students building a coalition, rally
ing around a social interest and see
ing it through to fruition."

Stanford students dance at the University's annual Mausoleum Party two years ago. The party was organized in past
years by the Stanford Student Alumni Network, but a shift in priorities at the Stanford Alumni Association, STAN's
parent group, led to its cancellation this year.
