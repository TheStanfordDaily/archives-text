# GOP takes the Senate
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Re
publicans narrowly seized control of
the Senate early this morning, oust
ing Democrats in Georgia and Mis
souri and giving President Bush's
legislative agenda a major boost in
the next Congress.
By winning their 50th seat in
Missouri, the GOP was ensured
control of the chamber next year be
cause Vice President Dick Cheney
will cast tie-breaking votes.
Democrats t(x)k just one seat
from Republicans when Arkansas
Attorney General Mark Pryor, the
son of former Sen. David Pryor, de
feated incumbent Sen. Tim
Hutchinson.
In Georgia, Republican Rep.
Saxby Chambliss defeated moder
ate first-term Democratic Sen. Max
Cleland, a triple amputee from the
Vietnam War, after chiding him for
opposing President Bush's plan for
creating a new Department of
Homeland Security.
The GOP also could take control
of the lame-duck session of the cur
rent Congress, which convenes
next week to tackle unfinished bud
get business and perhaps other leg
islation because of Rep. Jim Talent's
victory in Missouri.
Talent could be quickly sworn
into office after defeating Democra

tic Sen. Jean Carnahan. She was ap
pointed to the seat after her hus
band, Mel Carnahan, was elected in
2000, three weeks after he was killed
in a plane crash. That would give the
GOP at least 50 seats in Senate re
turning next week — enough for
control because of Cheney.
Rep. John Sununu was victori
ous for the GOP in New Hamp
shire, retaining a Republican-held
seat that Democrats had high hopes
of winning. He defeated Democrat
ic Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, despite a
lack of help from many conserva
tives bitter over his primary defeat
of Republican Sen. Bob Smith.
In Colorado, incumbent Repub
lican Sen. Wayne Allard field off
lobbyist and former U.S. Attorney
Tom Stickland in a rematch of their
race six years ago.
The triumph came on a night
that began with Democrats clinging
to a one-seat margin, and it meant
they will have to relinquish the ma
jority they have held since Vermont
Sen. James Jeffords abandoned the
GOP in June 2001.
With at least 47 senators, De
mocrats will still be able to use fili
busters — procedural delays — to
kill Republican initiatives because
such roadblocks need only 41 votes
to succeed.
