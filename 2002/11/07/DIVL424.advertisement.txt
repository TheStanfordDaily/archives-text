Haussmann Or
The Distinction
by author Paul LaFarge
Thursday, November 7, 2002 • 7pm

When one thinks of Paris, the
images that come to mind
are of grandeur, grace and
sophistication: sweeping, tree
lined boulevards, and the Opera
House. But Paris was once as
cramped and dingy as the rest of
medieval Europe, and the man
credited with cleaning it up (or
ruining its charm, as some still see
it) is Baron Georges-Eugene
Haussmann, who served as
prefect of the Seine from 1853 to
1869. LaFarge (The Artist of the
Missing) pays homage to this
mystifying personage in his
tremendous novel, which is every
bit as grand, gracious and sophis
ticated as Paris itself. LaFarge,
posing as translator (he even
includes a "Note to
the English Edition"), neatly
integrates geographical and cul
tural references into the tale, mak
ing this as much an enlightening
history of Paris as it is a tragic,
affecting love story.
