Just avenge the CU mauling and
beat the Oklahoma Sooners for
all to be right in Huskerland.
18 use
Can the 'Canes repeat? Can the Sooners make it two out of the last three? Who will win the Heisman?
How many polygons does a Butkus Award winner get? Where is Berkeley? The answers to these
(No. No. Look to Texas. Thousands. Take 1-80 west and follow the signs.) and other pressing ques
tions can be found in this year's College Football Top 25 poll:
JB ma
VV,
Must turn off "Injuries" for the
thin Trojans to succeed. Con
trolling the playbook is crucial
with USC's quarterback.
19 BOISE STATE
Say hello to the first "Houston
Bowl" winner. Increased frame
rates show that this year these
boys are on their way up.
20 AUBURN
1 CAL
So they went 1-10 last year. Big deal. Serious time spent in the Blue Chip Recruiting Mode has
made this team into a rough bunch on the gridiron. That combined with a new Power I forma
tion adds an unexpected threat for this turn-around team.
MIAMI (FL)
,iSiE
FLORIDA STATE
mm
How good is this team? Eight or
nine of their starters should be
in NFL GameDay"next year. The
'Canes may have the toughest
schedule in football, with games
against the Florida Gators,
Tennessee Volunteers, Virginia
Tech Hokies and Florida State
Seminoles. About the only qual
ity teams not on their schedule
are in the NFL.
3 OKLAHOMA
New Hot Routes can put the
2000 NCAA champs right back
at the top. Which means almost
as much to this Oklahoma
Sooner team as beating their
heated rival, the Nebraska
Cornhuskers. But, kicking game
may be a chink in the armor.
4 COLORADO
Will the Buffs defend their Big
12 crown using the wishbone?
The flexbone? The full house?
Only the coach controlling the
playbook knows for sure.
5 TENNESSEE
New high-low tackling may
allow the Volunteers to field
their toughest defense in years.
And defense wins champi
onships. The question is: will
their offense underachieve? A
0-0 game doesn't go down in
the win column.
6 TEXAS
Can their quarterback capture the
Heisman Trophy against what
may be the toughest conference
in Division I football? Can the
defense come up Texas big? Not
even our highly evolved artificial
intelligence can answer that one.

11 WASHINGTON STATE
A strong passing offense makes
them a team to beat. Explosive
gameplay makes this perennial
Pac 10 little brother into a legit
imate head-turner. WAZZU is
ready to play with the big boys.
12 ALABAMA
Old coach sacked in Career
Mode. Team should improve.
21 SOUTH CAROLINA
Same coach. Same expectations.
Same potential: Nothing but a
national championship will do.
8 FLORIDA

Lots of excitement building for
" ' 'Cocks this year. Volatile offense
I could be a threat with the addition
I of a full-house formation.
New coach. Same expectations.
Same potential: Nothing but a
national championship will do.
9 UCLA
The Crimson Tide not only has
the polygons but also the offen
sive line to outmuscle anyone
in college football. Not to men
tion an impressive amount of
depth in the backfield. If that's
not enough, new high-low tack
ling gives their defense the bite
it needed. Roll, Tide, roll.
13 OREGON
Blue Chip recruiting made the
loss of their 2001 Heisman can
didate easier to stomach. A new
wishbone offense could help the
2002 Ducks rain on just about
anyone's parade.
22 MARSHALL
A weak schedule equals strong
wins. Will Keith lackson, in
GameBreaker's booth, call them
"rumbling" or "bumbling"?
23 TEXAS A&M
Several players converted to
defense. Too bad they're in the
country's toughest conference.
24 LOUISVILLE
Gamebreakers on both sides of
the ball. Look for the Louisville
Cardinals to go to their Wing T
offense for big points.
25 PENN STATE
Look for the Bruins to utilize a
sensational receiving core and
Hot Routes to vie for a nation
al championship. Then expect
the Bruins to vie for a champi
onship all over again in the
NCAA" Final Four* 2003 edition.
10 UNIV. OF TOLEDO
A great run in Career Mode gets
these overachievers a major BCS
Bowl bid and a Top 10 finish.
And their coach the chance to
take over a major college pow
erhouse. Enjoy that animated
contract, coach.
14 OHIO STATE n
More control over the running spPPWT
game puts them at the top of

Big 10 Conference title first, HHP,. JmHH
which won't be easy, but defi- Same classic CGI uniforms. Same
nitely a possibility for the Ohio classic spot in polls.
State Buckeyes.
15 WASHINGTON
Unproven defense must come
through for a Rose Bowl berth.
Tigers are looking to claw their
way to another SEC title.
Louisiana State University's
pass- and run-blocking is top
notch this year.
