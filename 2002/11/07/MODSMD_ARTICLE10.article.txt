### ANNA GALAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Renowned transgender scholar, writer and
activist Susan Stryker spoke yesterday afternoon
to over 60 people in Margaret Jacks I lall re
garding anti-transgender violence. The forum,
which was held in conjunction with the feminist
studies class "Girls on Film," addressed many of
the current issues of fear and violence that have
been brought about by t lie recent murder of Bay
Area teen Gwen Araujo.
Stryker, who is the executive director of the
GLBT Historical Society in San Francisco,
stressed the need for discussion and education in
order to bring about positive change.
"I am horrified this has happened," Stryker
said, in reference to Araujo's murder. "But 1
don't think we'll come up with an easy solution
without a drastic cultural change. 1 don't see the
problem disappearing anytime soon."
Stanford's LGBT-CRC hosted a vigil Monday
night to honor Araujo, a 17-year-old from
Newark, Calif. Araujo, who was biologically a boy
but who lived as a girl, was beaten and strangled
to death when attackers discovered her gender.
Trisha Pender, who teaches the film class and
organized the event, said that she felt Stryker's

visit could help raise awareness of important is
sues and help answer difficult questions.
"We were really lucky to have [Susan] come
speak at this time," she said. "We have a respon
sibility to try and combat [incidents of violence]
and keep talking about them."
The class, which studies the portrayal of girls
in mass media and society, studies films ranging
from "Clueless" to "Buffy the Vampire Slayer."
Stryker spoke briefly on the film "Boys Don't
Cry," and her role on the Guggenheim's "Bran
don" Project. The film and museum piece tell
the true story of Brandon Teena, a transgender
teen who was murdered in Nebraska.
"Her visit was fantastic," said sophomore
Carly Schuster, a student in Pender's class. "It
was unbelievable. I he best part was being able to
communicate with Susan and have an open dia
logue about the issues facing the community."
Stryker asked the audience to come up with
what they thought to be the origins of hatred and
fear, probing for the roots of anger and violence.
She believes that anti-transgender violence is
rooted in homophobia and misogyny.
"There is no way to answer the question 'who
am I'without subjecting oneself to gendered lan
guage," Stryker said. "There's always the need to
answer to the masculine or feminine pronoun."

Stryker lectured on what she considered to be
the three components of self — body, social role
and stx ial identity — and how that didn't always
coincide with the views of society.
"The culture tends to believe gender is the
symbol of bodily sex," she said.

Susan Stryker spoke to a crowd of 60 students yes
terday about anti-transgender violence. She said
that while there has been a lot of progress in that
area, the problem will not disappear anytime
soon.
Stryker, who has been involved
in queer and transgender politics
for over 10 years, said that despite
the incidences of violence, "there
has been a lot of progress."
"I'm doing things that weren't
possible 10 years ago," said Stryker,
who transitioned during her last
year getting a doctorate at UC-
Berkeley.
"I've had the opportunity to
study, learn and think about these
issues," she said. "As a historian, I
like to see myself as giving these in
tellectual tools to the community."
