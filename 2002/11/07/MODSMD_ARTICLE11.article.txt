### SARAH LUSTBADER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Due to the record turnout and unprecedent
ed violence at this year's Halloween celebration in
the Castro, San Francisco police are considering
instituting new restrictions for next year, includ
ing an alcohol ban. This potential ban found little
support among Stanford students, many of
whom attended the festival last Thursday night.

"There were over 300,000 people there. 300
police officers were sen! out there to control the
crowd, and tlicy made about 30 arrests," said Sgt.
Nick Rubinooi'the Mission District police station.
"In the whole scheme of tilings, it went off'pretty
well. Unfortunately, a few events marred the
[evening]."
According to the San Francisco Chronicle,
four stabbings were reported, one leaving a vic
tim in critical condition at San Francisco General

Hospital.
Rubino cited "large amounts of people and
drinking" as the two main factors that con
tributed to the violence.
("apt. Greg Corrales cited another reason for
the violence.
"At some point, there are not enough police in
the Police Department to police this thing. That's
one thing the administration is going to have to
take a hard look at," he told The Chronicle.
Despite the violence, many Stanford students
felt secure at the Castro.
"1 definitely felt safe. There were policemen
everywhere," sophomore 1 112 anna As rat said.
Others expressed concern clue to the size of
the crowd.
"It was the most dense crowd I had ever seen
at the Castro," said Sean Fenton, class of 2002,
who has spent Halloween in the Castro for the
past three years. "1 never knew who was pushing
me or if it was a friend's hand on my shoulder."
"There was never any pushing in the past,"
said senior David Selinger, who has been to the
Castro several times. "There was always room to
move."
Police are considering ways to ensure safety at
next year's event.
"Right now, it's considered a spontaneous
event. No one entity takes responsibility for it,"
Rubino said. "Maybe next year [the event] will
take place in a blocked-ofl'area that is non-alco
holic, and will charge admission. That will put
people in a different mindset."
Rubino emphasized the role that alcohol
played in the violence that erupted this past Hal
loween.
