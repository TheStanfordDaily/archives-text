# Tempers flare as students denied to '8 Mile'
## 
### HELEN KIM EDITORIAL STAFF 
At around 7:30 p.m. last night,
over 100 students, some of whom
had been waiting for several hours,
were denied admittance into a
sneak preview of "8 Mile" at Cub
berley Auditorium. The students
held tickets to the show, but (he tick
ets did not guarantee admission.
Their growing frustration
turned into outrage when they
were met with what many consid
ered to be abrasive and unfair treat
ment by FLiCKS and Axe Commit
tee staff.
Earlier this week, students eager
to watch "8 Mile" raced to grab tick

ets online and in-person at White
Plaza.
While the tickets read, "Seating
is limited / Arrive early. Admission
not guaranteed," several students
wondered why Fl jCKS had distrib
uted so many extra tickets.
"It was pretty ridiculous that
FLiCKS distributed 150 more tick
ets than capacity could allow, espe
cially knowing how interested so
many students were in going to see
the movie," said sophomore Mar
lene Dominguez.
According to Kyle Alisharan,
projects director for SSE, distribut
ing extra tickets is a normal proce
dure for sneak previews.
"Knowing this would be a popu

lar movie, the FLiCKS staff was
purposely conservative in the num
ber of passes made available," he
said. "On average, judging from
past sneak previews, both those
hosted by FLiCKS and other cam
pus groups such as the Stanford
Film Society, only around 50 per
cent of distributed passes get used.
FLiCKS ambitiously estimated an
SO percent turnout over the typical
50 percent turnout lor sneaks, and
therefore made 500 passes available
to till the 400 seats in Cubberley."
Students also complained about
unprofessional conduct by FLiCKS
staff during last night's screening.
"Even outside of Cubberley last
night, [a FLiCKS employee] went

up to his friends and said, 'Oh, you
have tickets, come in,' " senior
Michael Stat said. "Of course, in a
crowd of people who all have tick
ets, that kind of attitude would
cause a lot of anger and frustration.
Some students asked him why he
was favoring some people over oth
ers, and he just turned away. His at
titude was designed to provoke stu
dents to become angry."
Some students who had not
been allowed into the theater tried
to enter the building through open
windows and back doors, only to be
stopped by police who had arrived
onto the scene at around 8 p.m.
"My friend tried to climb
through an unlocked window, but
a cop said to us, 'You know what,
don't even try, because we have
armed guards at every single door
inside leading into the auditorium,'
" Stat said.
Senior Jerry Torres, who stood
in front of the entrance to Cubber
ley hoping to replace someone who
walked out of the theater, ex
pressed disapproval regarding
management conduct.
"A couple people came out of
Cubberley Auditorium, and we

wanted to replace their empty seats,
but they wouldn't even let us in,"
Torres said. "We asked them why
and they said, ' Just because.' I think
it's because of their insolence that
they decided not to allow student
replacements, when others could be
enjoying the benefit of the movie.
"The head of security, I think he
worked for the Axe committeee
and was a retired sheriff, said to us,
There's no way in hell you're get
ting in.' Other kids were knocking
on the door and causing a ruckus
because they were frustrated. The
students were being playful, and
both students and FIiCKS and the
Axe Committee were frustrated,
but this man was being really abra
sive and unhelpful."
