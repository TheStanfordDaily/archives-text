WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush
and his party savored sweeping midterm elec
tion victories yesterday and began sketching an
agenda fora new, Republican-controlled Con
gress. 1 be leader ol defeated House Democ
rats, Rep. Dick Gephardt, signaled be would
step down.
"I'm excited to be able to be on offense," said
Republican Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the
once and future Senate majority leader. 1 fesaid
G( )1' priorities will includea new 1 fomeland Se
curity Department as well as targeted tax cuts to
help the economy. I le added that Bush's judi
cial nominees could expect speedier review.
Republicans were assured of 51 seats in the
new Senate, a gain of two. Democrats had 47

remained in doubt, in Louisiana, where Demo
cratic Sen. Mary Landrieu will face Republican
Suzanne Terrell in a December runoff.

Senior aides, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Gephardt intended to declare
today that he would not seek a fifth term as

House Democratic leader. The 61-year-old

the White I louse in 2004, but it was not known
whether he would discuss his presidential am
bitions when he made his announcement.
I lis decision not to seek a new term in lead

ership came at the end of a day in which two
members of the rank and file urged him to step
aside. And it triggered a race between the sec
ond-ranking and third-ranking members of
the leadership, Reps. Nancy Pelosi of (California
