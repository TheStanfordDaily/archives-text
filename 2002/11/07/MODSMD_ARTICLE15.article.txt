### 
NANCY, France (AP) — A lire on an
overnight train in eastern France filled a sleeping
car with deadly smoke early yesterday, killing 12
people — including live Americans from the
same family — and driving panicked passengers
to smash windows and jump to safety.
l'he train, like others in Furope, had no
smoke detectors even though cigarette smok
ing is allowed in designated cars.
Fatal rail accidents are rare in France, where

trains are known for speed, safety and efficien
cy. Accidents, however, are not unknown in Fu
rope: A high-speed train derailed in Germany
in 1998, killing 101 people.
Yesterday's blaze, which also injured nine
people, was initially blamed on an electrical
short-circuit. But the French rail authority
SNCF said that was premature and the cause
was under investigation.
The owner of the sleeping car, German na

tional railroad Deutsche Bahn, said the fire ap
parently started in the compartment of a train
attendant. Smoke was blamed for the deaths.
The lire began shortly after 2 a.m. as the
train with 150 passengers passed through the
c ity of Nancy on its way to Munich, Germany,
according to SNCF. The train had left Paris
three hours earlier.
An accountant from North Branford, Conn,
and four members of his family were killed.
