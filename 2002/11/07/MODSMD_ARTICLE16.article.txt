# U.S. urges U.N. vote on Iraq resolution

### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) —
The United States pushed fora
quick U.N. vote yesterday on a re
vised Iraq resolution which threat
ens Saddam Hussein with "serious
consequences," while trying to
ease concerns about setting off a
new war.
But after eight weeks of inten
sive wrangling in the Security
Council, and some major conces
sions by the Bush administration,
Prance and Russia are still not
satisfied.
French President Jacques
Chirac called Russia's Vladimir
Putin yesterday to discuss the
new text and both agreed that
"ambiguities" that could be used
to trigger an attack on Iraq must
be removed, Chirac's spokes
woman said.
Nonetheless, both leaders saw
"many improvements" in the new
U.S. proposal, Colonna said.
U.S. Ambassador John Negro
ponte said the United States in
tends to put the draft resolution to
a vote on Friday and "deserves
consensus support."
If the resolution is adopted on
Friday, Iraq would have seven
days to accept the terms. U.N.
chief weapons inspector Hans
Blix said an advance team would
be in Baghdad within 10 days of
its acceptance.
Inspectors would have 45 days
to actually begin work, and would
have to report to the council 60
days later on Iraq's performance.

While the revised draft offers
concessions to critics, including a
greater role for the Security Coun
cil, it still meets the Bush adminis
tration's key demands: toughen
ing inspections, threatening Iraq
with "serious consequences," and
freeing the United States to take
military action against Iraq if in
spectors say it isn't complying.
At the same time, it gives Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein "a final
opportunity" to cooperate with
weapons inspectors, holds out the
possibility of lifting 12-year-old
sanctions imposed after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait and reaf
firms the country's sovereignty.
Negroponte officially intro
duced the new text at a closed
door council meeting, where Blix
and other members noted several
problems. "We'll see if we can find
some way to accommodate the
concern that other delegations ex
pressed and the points that Dr.
Blix made," Negroponte said.
But the U.S. administration said
that it was now in the endgame and
that the new text offered Iraq an
opportunity to avoid war.
The Security Council scheduled
another round of negotiations
today, and Singapore's U.N. Am
bassador Kishore Mahbubani said
"it's very clear that we are moving
closer and closer to consensus."
But whether the United States,
and its co-sponsor Britain, can get
all 15 council members on board
remains to be seen.
