## The 						Stanford Daily 20-unit cap should keep students' needs in mind 
### 
Published Since 1891

In an article in last Wednesday's Daily,
University Registrar Roger Printup
and Associate Director for Freshman
Advising Dandre DeSandies spoke
about Stanford's reasoning behind enforc
ing a 20-unit limit on courses taken by un
dergraduates. Basically, the administrators
claimed that the unit cap is in place to ben
efit students — to prevent students from
spreading themselves too thin or overex
erting themselves by taking too many
courses. We feel that this reasoning is inac
curate and masks the University's real mo
tivation behind enforcing a 20-unit cap: an

economic one.
If Stanford students are intelligent and
responsible enough to attend this institu
tion, they surely have enough common
sense to allocate their time carefully. A stu
dent's goal is to maximize the benefit he or
she gets from classes. The number of cours
es that students choose to take is usually mo
tivated by several factors, including the
amount of time they are willing to spend on
school work and the number of outside
commitments they have.
Many students, if given the chance,
would take more than 20 units in order to

save money by graduating early. But under
the current policy, most cannot. Some stu
dents are even deterred from studying unit
intensive majors such as computer science
in favor of smaller majors that can be com
pleted in less time, so that they can graduate
in fewer than four years.
And this, in fact, more closely relates to
Stanford's decision to impose a unit cap. If
every Stanford student was allowed to take
an infinite number of units, the University
would suffer financially.
A Stanford undergraduate education
costs the same amount for every undergrad-

uate, regardless of the number of classes
taken. By granting permission to take more
than 20 units to every student, Stanford
would in essence be discounting the "price"
of each individual class.
This is, of course, a valid concern on the
part of the University as a private institu
tion. However, for those students who suffer
financially from the imposition of the 20-
unit cap, we hope that the Registrar's office
can be more flexible, by allowing exceptions
on a case-by-case basis. While Stanford has
the right not to be taken advantage of by its
students, students also have that right.
